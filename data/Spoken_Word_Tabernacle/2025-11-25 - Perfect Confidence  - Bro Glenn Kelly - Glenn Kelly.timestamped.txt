[0:00] the nation from place to place. All
[0:02] kinds of signs and wonders that showed
[0:04] up right at the end time and yet the
[0:07] church set days it was pretty good. I I
[0:11] believe I may go to another night. See
[0:13] what'll take place at the next meeting.
[0:14] That's not the thing to do. What we need
[0:17] when we see God moving in our midst is
[0:19] to get down to business with it. PRAY
[0:22] AND CROWD AND [screaming] DO ALL that we
[0:24] know how to do.
[0:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let the gospel in this last days
[0:29] attract our attention.
[0:31] Bible promised that this gospel would
[0:34] just become so each day like in the days
[0:36] of Luther he taught sanctific or
[0:38] justification become minority when it
[0:41] come to the westerly Methodist age
[0:42] through sanctification. Then when they
[0:45] settle down to a church and that was all
[0:47] it was to it. God raised up Pentecost
[0:49] and now it's got to the place that
[0:51] Pentecost is becoming farmland and
[0:53] different. God moves right on that. He
[0:56] won't stop at all.
[0:57] &gt;&gt; He goes right on. The children of Israel
[0:59] followed a pillar of fire.
[1:01] &gt;&gt; And every time that fire stopped, they
[1:03] stopped with it.
[1:05] &gt;&gt; And if they didn't move, they was left
[1:06] in the wilderness. They had to move
[1:08] where the fire moved. That's the way
[1:10] God's church always does. It moves with
[1:12] the fire.
[1:14] &gt;&gt; When
[1:16] Martin Luther saw the fire, the first
[1:19] reformation, he come out of the Catholic
[1:21] Church and he built his denomination
[1:24] under it. The fire moved into
[1:26] sanctification. He's already organized
[1:28] under that and couldn't do it go any
[1:30] further. Methodists took it. They
[1:32] organized under that. They couldn't go
[1:34] no farther. Pentecost come and tuck it
[1:36] from them. Now, if we don't watch, the
[1:38] fire will move right on again. Let's
[1:41] stay under the fire. Worship under the
[1:43] fire. Worshiping the power of the
[1:45] spirit, believing God's word, laying
[1:47] aside every weight.
[1:48] &gt;&gt; AND EVERY SIN THAT DOES EASILY beset us.
[1:51] And what is sin? Unbelief.
[1:54] He that believeth not is condemned
[1:56] already. They're just two sin. One, two
[1:59] things in the world. One is faith and
[2:01] the other is unbelief.
[2:03] Committing adultery, smoking, drinking,
[2:05] that's not sin. That's the attributes of
[2:07] sin. You do that because you're not a
[2:10] believer. A believer doesn't do those
[2:12] things. You either believe or do not
[2:14] believe. There's three classes of people
[2:17] usually tends a meeting anywhere. And
[2:20] that's
[2:21] unbelievers
[2:23] make believers and real believers. And
[2:25] there always that crowd everywhere. And
[2:29] now what we want to do is be real
[2:31] believers. Draw our heart into this
[2:33] word. Let the word be the word of God be
[2:37] the final decision of every one of us.
[2:40] &gt;&gt; You owe it to me. You ought to me as a
[2:42] minister. If you ever see anything
[2:45] that's going on in the meeting that's
[2:47] not exactly with the scripture, then you
[2:49] owe to me to come tell me. It's right
[2:52] you do. I believe that God does things
[2:54] that's not wrote in the Bible. I believe
[2:56] that God's God. He can do what he wishes
[2:58] to. But as long as I know it's staying
[3:00] right in that cover there and know that
[3:02] God made a promise, I feel assured with
[3:05] that.
[3:05] &gt;&gt; As long as I can have that, I'll be
[3:08] satisfied with whatever anything else.
[3:11] Nothing else will satisfy me like that.
[3:13] As long as I can stay right with that.
[3:16] Now, the only way to find out what Jesus
[3:19] is today is to go back and find what he
[3:22] was yesterday. If he's the same
[3:24] yesterday, today, and forever. Is that
[3:25] logical? Is that sensible? Well, now
[3:29] let's go back then. I was reading here a
[3:31] few moments ago in St. John the the 12th
[3:34] chapter, I believe it was. Yes, sir.
[3:36] 12th chapter, 20 21st verse. Now, let's
[3:39] go back at the first book of St. John. I
[3:41] want you to study with me and through
[3:43] the week so we won't stay too long. I
[3:47] guess you heard that go off just saying
[3:48] that was my watch. I have an alarm watch
[3:50] from Switzerland and I think when I was
[3:53] setting up I I had that alarm set but I
[3:55] haven't got started yet. So I just had
[3:57] to turn it off.
[4:00] Now Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[4:03] today and forever. Let's turn back to
[4:05] the first chapter of St. John and find
[4:08] out if you read a book and it said Mary
[4:10] and John lived happily ever after. Who
[4:13] is Mary and John? You'll never know till
[4:15] you go back to the first of the book and
[4:16] read the book through. If the Bible says
[4:18] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[4:21] and forever, the only way we'll ever
[4:23] know what he was, what he should be
[4:26] today, we'll have to go back to see what
[4:28] he was yesterday. Is that right?
[4:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:32] &gt;&gt; Now, let's find out. We get St. John 1.
[4:35] We'll just quote some scriptures. I want
[4:37] you to read it. I'm going to go over a
[4:39] few chapters in it tonight. Tomorrow
[4:41] night, pick up some more and so forth as
[4:43] we go along the way. The Holy Spirit
[4:45] will lead. But let's find out what he
[4:47] was yesterday. Then if we can see
[4:50] exactly what he was yesterday and see
[4:53] him come into our midst and do the same
[4:55] thing today,
[4:56] every sick person in your life get up
[4:58] and thank God and walk out. Say it's all
[5:00] over. Hallelujah.
[5:01] &gt;&gt; Now remember before we get to it, divine
[5:04] healing is not some magic word that
[5:07] someone says over you. Divine healing,
[5:10] every sick person in here is already
[5:13] healed in the sight of God. He was
[5:16] wounded for our transgression. You say,
[5:18] "Brother Brand, what do you mean by
[5:20] that?" All right.
[5:37] &gt;&gt; [music]
[5:53] [music]
[6:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you.

[7:36] upstanding tonight. Amen. Even as we
[7:39] commit the service into the hands of the
[7:41] Lord with a word of prayer. Amen.

[7:49] grateful Lord to be in your presence
[7:50] tonight. Lord, we just bless your name.

[27:33] Okay. So,
[27:35] okay. Yeah. So, Brother Polycap, then
[27:38] after that, Sister Rebecca
[28:08] May God bless you.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; I have a testimony
[28:18] &gt;&gt; that God did in the life of a pastor.
[28:22] Fernando Zata.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; It's Pastor Fernando Zat.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; He's in Virginia.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; His father was a pastor in Africa.
[28:35] &gt;&gt; He was hospitalized.
[28:41] He has something in his throat in the
[28:42] inside
[28:48] &gt;&gt; and there was a nurse who was treating
[28:50] him
[28:57] and they did a decision to take
[28:59] something out
[29:05] and the nurse noticed that she failed.
[29:12] And they had to transfer the brother
[29:13] into a different hospital
[29:18] because he suffered for three days in
[29:21] the hospital.
[29:26] He was trying to um reach his father
[29:29] who's pastor to pray for him
[29:37] but he could not. So there was a desire
[29:39] in his heart that was telling him to
[29:41] call brother Polycar.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; Then he called me.
[29:57] He told me I am not well. I tried to
[30:00] reach my father but I could not. But God
[30:02] plac in my heart to call you so you can
[30:04] pray for me.
[30:20] So I told him let let us pray even if
[30:23] they have to transfer you or bring you
[30:25] to another hospital.
[30:27] But my prayer is for God to touch you
[30:29] before you arrive to the transfer.
[30:48] The surgery wasn't successful. Then the
[30:51] doctor say, "We're going to see in the
[30:52] morning. I'm going call a colleague
[30:54] that's in the same line of work to see
[30:56] if we can try again.
[31:08] And in the morning they came and they
[31:11] were trying to see how they can transfer
[31:13] the way they needed to transfer.
[31:28] And the doctor was speaking to their
[31:31] colleagues saying that uh that they've
[31:32] done a lot of errors. So he didn't know
[31:35] how to go about it.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; After the diagnosis and everything that
[31:48] they've done, they noticed there was
[31:49] something that was very big.
[32:07] When they looked at the diagnosis and
[32:10] the picture and the person themselves,
[32:12] when the colleagues came, they started
[32:15] um congratulating the doctor for the
[32:17] works that he's done.
[32:28] So they started telling their the doctor
[32:30] that committed a lot of errors that when
[32:32] we're looking at it, we don't see
[32:34] anything. We don't know why you
[32:35] contacted us.
[32:53] And the doctor was confused and didn't
[32:55] understand how with every errors that
[32:58] he's done and they state that he left
[33:00] the client that the next day the client
[33:02] is all healed and all.
[33:21] And when that happened, they noticed
[33:23] that they couldn't do anything from the
[33:25] exterior, touching the throat or
[33:27] anything because they noticed that God
[33:29] had already healed the man.
[33:37] And that's why we're glorifying the
[33:39] Lord. And the brother told me to give
[33:40] the testimony. That's why I came to give
[33:42] the testimony.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; May God bless you all. [applause]
[33:58] What's up, Rebecca? I'm going to ask
[34:01] brother John to thank the Lord for our
[34:03] testimonies.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; God bless y'all. Um, so a couple
[34:06] weekends ago after Yok's wedding, my
[34:09] husband and I went to spend some time
[34:11] with his mom in Alabama and we went uh
[34:14] mudding or jeeping and um he has a bar
[34:17] in the front of it that was already kind
[34:19] of bent upward some, but we were going
[34:22] on the trails. It got bent up more into
[34:25] the deep and it we got stuck. Couldn't
[34:28] turn, couldn't go anywhere. And so I was
[34:32] I got out the deep and I'm like telling
[34:34] myself try not to panic because we got
[34:36] to get home that the next day, Sunday.
[34:39] So I'm like I calmed down instantly. I'm
[34:42] like I'm not going to panic. So, um, I
[34:46] just started singing and praying and
[34:48] claiming the Lord was going to get us
[34:50] out of there somehow. So, um, less than
[34:53] 20 or 30 minutes later, we had another
[34:55] party of jeep, eight jeeps, eight come
[34:58] up behind us on the trail and they all
[35:02] were, most of them were mechanics and
[35:05] they all came up the trail behind where
[35:07] we were stuck at and helped us get the
[35:09] bar out. Within like an hour, they had
[35:12] pulled it the bar off and straightened
[35:14] it more than it had been before and we
[35:17] were able to get out of that trail and
[35:20] and get on home safely. So,
[35:24] [applause]
[35:28] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. We thank the Lord for
[35:30] the wonderful testimonies tonight. Amen.
[35:32] So, Brother John, we will pray for the
[35:36] tithes and then the offerings as well.
[35:38] Amen.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:40] I want to thank the Lord. Also, um we
[35:43] got a neighbor that's elderly and um her
[35:48] daughter's reporting that she she went
[35:50] through surgery yesterday and
[35:51] everything's coming out just fine. So,
[35:54] Amen. Amen. So, let's uh let's just

[53:56] brother Brian there. Not a visitor. God
[54:00] bless you with the family. Your daughter
[54:02] I I won't even [laughter]
[54:05] she's part of the family. Amen. And I
[54:08] see my sister back there. God richly
[54:10] bless you and welcome to spoken word
[54:12] tabernacle. Amen. I do not know the name
[54:15] but you're not a visitor. you are family
[54:18] members so feel at home. Uh usually we
[54:21] preach and our Wednesdays are convention
[54:24] but today we got a Tuesday. Say it
[54:26] again.
[54:29] Say it again.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Sister who?
[54:35] Sister Faith. God bless you. Sister
[54:37] Faith. Good to see you. I know you.
[54:40] [laughter]
[54:42] God bless you. Welcome again to Spoken
[54:45] Word. Amen. Oh, praise the Lord. Good to
[54:47] see you in the midweek service. So,
[54:50] welcome. And you you at home. You're not
[54:52] a visitor. You've been here before. God
[54:54] richly bless you. Amen. Glory to God. Uh
[54:58] usually on Wednesday, this is when we
[55:00] have our convention. But today is
[55:02] Tuesday, so it's a special service and
[55:05] it's a thanksgiving week. So, we have a
[55:08] lot to thank God.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; So, before we even ask him when we start
[55:11] praying, there is a lot we can thank him
[55:13] because it's the Thanksgiving week.
[55:15] Let's take some time and then express
[55:17] our gratitude unto the Lord because he
[55:20] want to hear somebody to just tell him
[55:23] thank you because God has been so so so
[55:26] good to us. Amen. You clear with the two
[55:30] Josephs. When you see all those things
[55:32] climb coming up clear like that in the
[55:34] scripture, it just blow your mind how
[55:37] the holy scripture were written in a
[55:39] certain way. And God is a rich God.
[55:43] Amen.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; You understand this now? I went through
[55:47] quote and scripture and everything. God
[55:49] is a rich God who humble himself and
[55:53] became poor so that through his poverty
[55:56] we may become rich.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; There is two choices. Either you let the
[56:02] beaten of Jesus go like that or you take
[56:05] advantage of him. He was wounded. He was
[56:08] bruised so that we can get healing.
[56:12] Amen.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; So he was not just bruised like that. Uh
[56:16] so let's go ahead. If he was already
[56:18] bruised and the devil did what he was
[56:19] supposed to do, it is our responsibility
[56:21] to do what we are supposed to do to reap
[56:24] the benefit of what he got there. Amen.
[56:27] Other than that you make the atonement
[56:29] of non effect. The atonement it looks
[56:31] like somebody went and suffer for
[56:33] nothing and the children are still in
[56:35] pain and they are suffering and they
[56:38] they are they are in distress. No, no,
[56:40] no. the atonement went so we can get
[56:42] some rescue,
[56:44] &gt;&gt; a rescue, a real help in the time of
[56:46] trouble. Amen. Glory to God. So we have
[56:50] a 30 minute. Brother Glenn will uh uh
[56:55] exhort for 30 minutes, preach for 30
[56:57] minutes and right after that we get on a
[57:00] prayer and we start our praying. Amen.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Okay. So let's go with only believer.
[57:08] Brother Glenn is not a visitor.
[57:11] Amen. I need to save the veteran
[57:16] or make them preach all the time. No, we
[57:19] need to save the strength.
[57:22] Amen.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Doing [music] a lot for the kingdom of
[57:25] God. Only believe.
[57:27] Oh,
[57:30] believe
[57:35] all
[57:41] [music]
[57:43] [singing] things are possible. [music]

[59:41] Huh? Look what God is doing around here.
[59:45] I tell you, we serve a mighty God, a
[59:47] wonderful God, a great God. I tell you,
[59:51] sometimes I wonder, you know, why he had
[59:54] me preach behind a masterpiece like
[59:57] Sunday morning. [laughter] Let's give
[1:00:00] him a clap of it, huh? Come on now. from
[1:00:03] fresh from the mighty throne of God. Is
[1:00:06] that right? Hallelujah. Get him his
[1:00:09] bouquets now. Right. Hallelujah. You
[1:00:12] know, he speaks of what we go through
[1:00:14] and brother Seth and brother Robert and
[1:00:16] the other brothers and you saints and
[1:00:18] musicians, but you don't know what he go
[1:00:21] through. I tell you, you won't know the
[1:00:22] fullness until we get on the other side.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let us pray. Lord God, we
[1:00:28] thank you for your grace, your mercy. We
[1:00:30] thank you, Father, for an opportunity,
[1:00:32] Lord God, just to come before your
[1:00:34] precious children, Lord God. We come,
[1:00:36] Lord God, binding every demon force in
[1:00:39] the name of Jesus Christ that would try
[1:00:41] to trouble the minds of your children on
[1:00:44] tonight, Father, because you've given us
[1:00:46] a great opportunity, not to pray from
[1:00:49] home, Lord God, but to be here in thy
[1:00:51] presence, Lord God, in the tabernacle,
[1:00:54] Lord God. So we thank you Lord God for
[1:00:56] those that are looking in that are
[1:00:58] desire to be here but grant them
[1:01:00] traveling mercy Lord God and bless them
[1:01:02] and strengthen them also now Father we
[1:01:05] look unto the hill to where our strength
[1:01:07] and our help cometh from and our help
[1:01:09] cometh from you. So we thank you for all
[1:01:12] that you're going to do, Lord God. And
[1:01:14] we we speak, Lord God, the word for our
[1:01:16] sister Lorel, Lord God, touch your body
[1:01:19] where where she's at and all the other
[1:01:21] saints. Father, we thank you. And by
[1:01:23] faith, remember your five-fold ministry,
[1:01:26] your universal bride. We thank you in
[1:01:28] Jesus name we pray. Amen. And amen.
[1:01:32] While you're standing, let's turn to
[1:01:33] Hebrews
[1:01:35] and let's look at uh chapter 4. Hebrews
[1:01:39] chapter 4.
[1:01:41] Y'all just pull with me now. I got my
[1:01:43] timer on over here. So we we in good
[1:01:46] shape. Okay. [laughter]
[1:01:50] Hallelujah. Once you have Hebrews 4
[1:01:52] verse 16, you have it. Say amen.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:58] It says, "Let us therefore come boldly
[1:02:01] unto the throne of grace." He said that
[1:02:03] ye may obtain mercy and find grace to to
[1:02:07] help in the time of what need. Is that
[1:02:11] right? You may be seated that you can
[1:02:13] find. We're talking about a little
[1:02:14] thought here that we just was um
[1:02:17] bringing here tonight. You know, perfect
[1:02:20] confidence.
[1:02:22] Perfect confidence. You know, this can
[1:02:24] only be preached to the bride. This can
[1:02:27] only be preached to the message of the
[1:02:29] hour. This is only could be preached. Is
[1:02:31] that right? Because we know perfect
[1:02:34] means what? It's finished, right? It's
[1:02:36] finished. It's complete. Is that right?
[1:02:38] We're finished. We're complete inside of
[1:02:41] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Is
[1:02:43] that right? And so we know when we got
[1:02:46] that's why we read that scripture,
[1:02:47] honey, say Joshua because confidence
[1:02:50] mean what? Boldly, right? We can come to
[1:02:52] the T with boldness. Is that right? We
[1:02:55] don't have to back up nothing from the
[1:02:57] devil. Is that right? This is the hour
[1:02:59] of all promises. Is that right? This is
[1:03:02] the hour. He say this is the season. He
[1:03:05] said in Ecclesiastics 3, there is a
[1:03:07] what? A season, right? For everything.
[1:03:12] Is that right?
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; So this is the season. Is that right?
[1:03:16] For everything. Is that right? We don't
[1:03:19] have to wait for win or summer and fall.
[1:03:21] This is the season for everything.
[1:03:24] That's why we read that scripture says
[1:03:26] what? You can go to God when you need
[1:03:29] anything right now. Is that right?
[1:03:31] That's what HE'S SAYING. THAT'S WHY YOU
[1:03:33] CAN GO BOLDLY to the throne. Is that
[1:03:35] right? Because in the Old Testament, it
[1:03:38] was just a ritual. It was just a form.
[1:03:40] They had to go to the throne every year.
[1:03:43] Is that right?
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; So the high priest, he had to present a
[1:03:47] sacrifice for himself and then he went
[1:03:49] in there. Is that right?
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; I heard the prophet of God said they was
[1:03:53] jealous of him. We going to read some
[1:03:54] quotes in a minute. So just bear with
[1:03:56] me. We got our time and we going to let
[1:03:58] him have his way. Is that right? We're
[1:04:00] going to pound the devil in the head
[1:04:02] tonight. Is that right? We just lay the
[1:04:05] ground because when we get on prayer, we
[1:04:07] going on offense. Is that right? We're
[1:04:10] not backing up from nothing. We claiming
[1:04:12] everything because this is the hour.
[1:04:15] Brother Brandon said when Jesus met John
[1:04:17] at the river, is that right? And John
[1:04:20] said, "Uh, I needed to be baptized of
[1:04:22] you. Is that right?" He said, "No.
[1:04:24] Uh-uh. You I need for you to be baptized
[1:04:27] of me." Why? because he said all
[1:04:30] scriptures must be fulfilled. Brother
[1:04:33] Brandham said EVERY SCRIPTURE IN THAT
[1:04:36] Bible will be fulfilled in this age that
[1:04:40] we in. We can go through the throne of
[1:04:43] boldness. WHAT? WITH BOLDNESS. IS THAT
[1:04:45] RIGHT? WITH CONFIDENCE. That's right.
[1:04:47] Knowing that we going to get what we
[1:04:49] asked for.
[1:04:51] [cheering]
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Have your way, Lord.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "Look what we say. Help us,
[1:04:56] Lord. We come in there. We're talking
[1:04:58] about
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; boldness, confidence. We don't have to
[1:05:03] back up with anything.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; This thing is so simple. It's Oh, I'm
[1:05:07] like the pastor now. Huh, Levi? It's
[1:05:09] loaded. Is that right? Ah,
[1:05:13] it's loaded. You need to get into this
[1:05:16] message. Get in your quiet time with
[1:05:18] this message. Boy, if I would had it
[1:05:20] when I was your age, man, I'd be running
[1:05:22] all around tearing the devil's kingdom
[1:05:25] down. Is that right?
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; TEAR IT DOWN BECAUSE WE GOT HIS ANSWER.
[1:05:30] WHY? Uh he brought us the boldness to go
[1:05:33] because we got the perfect word from the
[1:05:35] perfect person. We come from God. UH WE
[1:05:38] GO BACK TO GOD. Uh in the beginning was
[1:05:40] the what? The word. The word WAS GOD.
[1:05:44] THE WORD WAS with God. The word was made
[1:05:46] flesh. UH NOW IS DWELLING among us.
[1:05:51] YE ARE GODS. YE ARE MESSIAHS.
[1:05:55] We come from God. WE GO BACK TO GOD.
[1:05:57] WE'RE NOT LOSING the one. WE'RE GOING TO
[1:06:00] BRING THEM ALL IN.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Look what he says here.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; This from the message 11355.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Huh. Paragraph 42.
[1:06:16] Listen to this.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Ah.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; If you
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; want to go back a little further,
[1:06:25] Just as far as historical,
[1:06:28] we could see the word. Now look how
[1:06:31] brother Brandham caught the mind of God.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; He said we could see the word in the
[1:06:37] beginning was the word.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; But what is a word? A word is a is a
[1:06:44] thought what? Manifested.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Let it sink in. It's a thought
[1:06:50] manifested. It's not the letter. The
[1:06:52] letter kill them. The spirit giveth
[1:06:54] life. Is that right?
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; We got mighty testimonies to show that
[1:06:59] our God is not dead, but he's what? He's
[1:07:02] alive. Is that right?
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; We don't have to back up from any
[1:07:06] sickness. We thank God for the doctors.
[1:07:08] We thank God for the hospitals. We thank
[1:07:10] God for the nurses. We thank God for the
[1:07:13] equipment. But once the doctors say they
[1:07:16] can't do no more, you got to what? I
[1:07:18] look unto the hill to where my strength
[1:07:21] and my help come from. Jehovah Gyra. Is
[1:07:24] that right? [applause and cheering]
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Jehovah Raire,
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; the Lord God. Uh a heal of all thy
[1:07:32] disease. This is not just an intellect.
[1:07:35] This is a life. We live by this now. Is
[1:07:38] that right? This is our life, saints. Uh
[1:07:41] we're not backing up. Is that right?
[1:07:43] This is the hour. We won't need healing
[1:07:46] and deliverance, finances, AND THE LORD
[1:07:48] DROPPED DOWN WHAT? Sunday morning to
[1:07:50] show us there's nothing wrong being
[1:07:52] rich. Is that right? Hallelujah.
[1:07:55] The perfect God gives us confidence to
[1:07:59] ask the things that we need.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Because he's a perfect word. Uh
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; he JUST DIDN'T SPEAK IT just to be
[1:08:08] speaking it.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Let me keep going. Look what he said.
[1:08:12] Help me Lord. He says, "A word is a
[1:08:14] thought manifest."
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; A thought spoken forth.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; God first he what? Proceedth.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; PRECEDED MEAN GOD COULD NOT EVEN SPEAK
[1:08:26] his own word unless HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT
[1:08:29] BEFORE HE SPOKE IT.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; He had to UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WAS ABOUT
[1:08:35] TO SAY BECAUSE WHEN IT WENT FORTH, HE
[1:08:38] KNOW THAT IT HAD TO MANIFEST WHAT HE
[1:08:40] SAID.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes sir.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Perceived
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; that's knowing.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Huh? He's saying it's he perceived the
[1:08:51] thought and he spoke it
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; and it became a word
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; and the word became became material.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Look at first let's look at first John
[1:09:03] five and 14. I know I want to get these
[1:09:06] scriptures before we moving good by the
[1:09:08] grace of God. First John five and let's
[1:09:12] look at verse I mean I tell you what
[1:09:14] let's start at verse uh 13. Start at
[1:09:18] verse uh 13. First John 5 and 13. These
[1:09:21] things have I written un unto you.
[1:09:24] Believe on the what? The name of the son
[1:09:26] of God. That ye know that ye have what?
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; You believe it.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; He's saying there no YOU KNOW IT.
[1:09:37] IT'S A DIFFERENT WHEN you move from
[1:09:39] believing to knowing. When you
[1:09:41] believeing TO KNOWING, FAITH COME BY
[1:09:43] HEARING, HEARING THE WORD OF GOD. WHEN
[1:09:45] YOU HEAR THE WORD OF GOD, IT WILL BE A
[1:09:48] PERFORMANCE. IS THAT RIGHT? IT WILL BE A
[1:09:50] PERFORMANCE BECAUSE YOU HEARD FROM GOD.
[1:09:52] YOU HEARD FROM YOUR THEOPHONY.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; We move from believing to knowing now.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Huh? When you know something,
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; IT'S BEEN REVEALED TO YOU. PETER, who
[1:10:05] did thou say that I am?
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Huh? Who do thou say that I am? Some say
[1:10:10] you Elijah. Some say you John the
[1:10:12] Baptist. Some say you Jeremiah. Some say
[1:10:14] you one of the prophets. Who do thou say
[1:10:17] that I am? Thou art the what? The
[1:10:19] Christ, the son of the living God. Uh
[1:10:22] brings the word to life. Is that right?
[1:10:24] He is now God in the flesh. Is that
[1:10:27] right? Huh? What' it say, pastor? You
[1:10:30] couldn't preach that. Let's set THE
[1:10:32] RECORD STRAIGHT. HUH? Let's set the
[1:10:35] record straight uh about this Holy
[1:10:38] Ghost. Is that right? How they going to
[1:10:41] identify this Holy Ghost? Is that right?
[1:10:43] My battle out there in the world is
[1:10:46] salvation. I've preached salvation.
[1:10:49] Salvation versus religion. My battle is
[1:10:52] against religion. All the years, that's
[1:10:54] what we're fighting against, right? We
[1:10:56] wrestle not against what?
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood, but against what?
[1:11:00] principalities and powers and wickedness
[1:11:03] and rulers in high places. They're going
[1:11:05] to say they don't God doesn't use
[1:11:07] prophets anymore. Is that right? Huh?
[1:11:09] Then they had to come and bring us a
[1:11:11] word, right? And they try to fight
[1:11:13] against the scripture, brother Polycar.
[1:11:15] They try to use what? Hebrew 1. Is that
[1:11:18] right? They try to use Hebrew 1. He says
[1:11:20] in diverse times, is that right? God
[1:11:23] spoke through the prophets. Is that
[1:11:25] right? But in diverse time, he said they
[1:11:28] say now these kind of things you going
[1:11:31] to fight against. Huh? The the you
[1:11:33] getting ready to move into some big
[1:11:35] battles now. Huh? That word is not just
[1:11:38] coming. He said store it up.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Store it up.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; God sent you a servant that's not
[1:11:44] afraid. He loved God. He loved his
[1:11:46] message. He love his people.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; This is what they come and say, "God
[1:11:51] don't use prophets no more." Huh? And
[1:11:53] they get around in it. He said, "Now
[1:11:55] they speak to who?" Jesus Christ. Is
[1:11:57] that right? I said, "I got a question
[1:11:59] for you, my brother. This is what it
[1:12:01] mean." And they said, "Yeah." He's take
[1:12:03] the Hebrew one. He said, "In diverse
[1:12:05] times, is that right?" I said, "Is Adam
[1:12:07] a prophet?" Huh? He was a son and a
[1:12:10] prophet. Was Moses a prophet? Son of son
[1:12:13] of God and a prophet. Son of man and a
[1:12:15] prophet. Was Ezekiel a prophet? Is that
[1:12:18] right? Was all these Daniel a prophet?
[1:12:20] He said, "Yeah." Each one of them saw
[1:12:22] him what way, pastor? One saw him in the
[1:12:24] wheel, in the middle of the wheel. Is
[1:12:26] that right? One saw him in THE BURNING
[1:12:28] BUSH. IS THAT RIGHT? One saw. How are we
[1:12:31] seen them? We've seen them by the word
[1:12:33] through Malachi 4. IS THAT RIGHT? LUKE
[1:12:36] 17:30, REVELATIONS 10:7, GOD HAD TO
[1:12:40] STILL USE THE PROPHET. BUT THEN they say
[1:12:42] now his son Jesus Christ. Now it's not
[1:12:45] just prophet OF GOD. IT'S GOD WHO HAVE
[1:12:47] BECOME the prophet. Is that right?
[1:12:49] because he's the Christ. Peter testified
[1:12:52] WHO THOU ARE. THOU are the Christ, the
[1:12:55] son of the living God. Is that right?
[1:12:58] The bride, the natural bride, I mean
[1:13:00] natural Israel and spiritual Israel,
[1:13:02] which is the bride of Jesus Christ is
[1:13:04] only GOING TO ACCEPT THE PROPHET.
[1:13:07] [cheering]
[1:13:09] [applause]
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; HUH? That's what GIVE ME BOLDNESS. IS
[1:13:15] THAT RIGHT? TO BE ABLE TO STAND OUT
[1:13:17] THERE AND GO THROUGH THE THRONE OF GOD
[1:13:20] NOT BELIEVING BUT KNOWING.
[1:13:22] [cheering and applause]
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; You know what you got.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; That's not anyone that came down.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; That was God.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; GOD IN SPIRIT FORM
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; told us about that old dollar on the
[1:13:41] back of the dollar. I'm just letting him
[1:13:42] have his way. He got around there with
[1:13:44] that dollar. What do they say? Great
[1:13:46] seal. Was that [snorts] right, pastor?
[1:13:48] And he got over there and they tried to
[1:13:50] tell us when we grew up that was
[1:13:51] Illuminati, man. That's Illuminati. That
[1:13:54] eye over there. Yeah, Illuminati. Right,
[1:13:56] buddy? Had to blast that devil up the
[1:13:58] other night in one institution.
[1:14:00] Illuminati, brother. That's a pyramid,
[1:14:03] right?
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; And the pyramid wasn't finished until
[1:14:06] Malachi 4 came. Luke 17:30, Revelations
[1:14:10] 10:7. Because Paul said, "We preach what
[1:14:13] Paul preached. We preached what Paul
[1:14:16] preached and more." Is that right? And
[1:14:18] more.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Huh? We ain't taking away from Paul. We
[1:14:22] just the bride of Jesus Christ. Is that
[1:14:24] right? God is unfolding everything in
[1:14:27] this hour here now. Go to the throne
[1:14:30] boldly. You know, Brother Brandham said
[1:14:32] he loved about about the uh uh uh
[1:14:35] discernment. He said he loved
[1:14:37] discernment, pastor. He said he wanted
[1:14:38] to come around there. He said, but you
[1:14:40] know what he always wanted? He said he
[1:14:42] wanted he loved that scripture in
[1:14:44] Joshua.
[1:14:46] Moon stand still. He said he appreciated
[1:14:50] it, but he wanted more faith in the
[1:14:54] word.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; That's where he wanted it. He wanted it
[1:14:58] in the word. But because of the people
[1:15:00] in the time, he said to do what? He said
[1:15:04] you if you can get the people to believe
[1:15:10] [cheering]
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; I believe that he had to move them out
[1:15:14] of Pentecost
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; and they only was going to receive his
[1:15:17] signs.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; HUH?
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; THIS GENERATION SEEKETH after what?
[1:15:22] Signs. So he gave him a three pull three
[1:15:26] pull pull of grace. Is that right?
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Disernment. He got over there. What?
[1:15:32] praying for the sick, then discernment,
[1:15:34] right? And then the opening of the word
[1:15:36] of the seven seal. Is that right? It was
[1:15:39] grace being extended to them. We got
[1:15:41] confidence because we don't not we don't
[1:15:43] just believe, we know.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; We know.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Let me keep going.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Let me keep going.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; He said, look, he says, now God first
[1:15:55] proceeded that the thought and he spoke
[1:15:58] it and it became a word. He says, "And
[1:16:01] the and the word became what?"
[1:16:03] Materialized.
[1:16:04] He says, "Now, so everything that God
[1:16:07] has spoke in his word received into the
[1:16:10] right channel."
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; See, it's got to be received in the
[1:16:14] right channel. We getting somewhere in a
[1:16:17] minute because you got to understand uh
[1:16:20] faith come by hearing, hearing the word
[1:16:22] of God. Somewhere your channels getting
[1:16:24] clogged up. Is that right? Because this
[1:16:27] is the hour that what? All things are
[1:16:30] possible. Is that right?
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; The impossible is for the impossible is
[1:16:35] possible. It's no such thing as the
[1:16:38] impossible for the believer because we
[1:16:41] can go boldly to the throne of mercy and
[1:16:44] grace. Is that right? Because the veil
[1:16:47] is ripped when he shed his blood on
[1:16:49] Calvary. Only one could go back there
[1:16:52] one time is was the high priest. Now we
[1:16:55] have a high priest oursel. Is that
[1:16:57] right? cannot be touched by the feelings
[1:17:00] of our infirmities. So when you rip the
[1:17:02] veil, [screaming]
[1:17:06] prophet God said the weakest prayer
[1:17:09] warrior can defeat the devil anywhere,
[1:17:13] anytime, any place, on any ground. Uh
[1:17:17] come on, we got to and boost that prayer
[1:17:19] life, saints.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; One of the most powerful weapons God
[1:17:23] gave us. Hallelujah.
[1:17:27] We moving. We moving. We going to bust
[1:17:29] the devil in the head tonight. Huh?
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Somebody going to break through.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Huh? Somebody breaking through tonight.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Was that right?
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now look in the paragraph 43,
[1:17:40] he says. So everything that God has
[1:17:42] spoken in his word received into the
[1:17:45] right channel." He says, "Will
[1:17:48] materialize."
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid to ask them. It will
[1:17:55] materialize.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; If you ask the things according to his
[1:18:01] deed, what that scripture, what did we
[1:18:03] say over there? He said, look, let me
[1:18:05] finish reading. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:18:07] Jesus. Let me go on and finish reading
[1:18:09] in five.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now look, I get to going. I
[1:18:13] know I ain't got much time. Y'all pray
[1:18:15] for me. I'm trying to stay in the middle
[1:18:16] of the road. If not, the wife will get
[1:18:18] me when I get home." He said, "Now
[1:18:19] look." He said, look, he he he said he
[1:18:23] said in verse 13, he said, "These things
[1:18:25] have I written unto you that believe on
[1:18:28] the name of the son of God, that ye may
[1:18:30] what?" Know that ye have what?
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Eternal life. He says, "And that ye that
[1:18:36] ye may believe on the name of the son of
[1:18:38] God."
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; He says, "And this is the what?
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Confidence."
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the confidence that we
[1:18:45] have in him
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; that if we ask anything
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; according to his will
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; and he what hear us is that right he
[1:18:58] hear us he says and if we what know we
[1:19:04] know that he hear us whatsoever we ask
[1:19:08] we know is that right that's what give
[1:19:11] you the confidence is Because you know
[1:19:14] uh you know WHO YOU ARE. YOU KNOW where
[1:19:17] you come from. You know your father hear
[1:19:19] you all the time. You know these things.
[1:19:22] Uh we're not believing. WE KNOW we on
[1:19:25] the offense man. We have to be on the
[1:19:27] defense.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Confidence in the almighty God.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Why? We can only one have confidence.
[1:19:37] Why? Because everything is complete.
[1:19:39] We're in the seventh church age. Is that
[1:19:41] right? It is finished. I want you to It
[1:19:44] is finished. Had to come and he had to.
[1:19:47] That's why in this hour here now, saints
[1:19:49] son, don't be fooled by Satan's bluff.
[1:19:52] Is that right? He's a good adversary. We
[1:19:54] know that. But you got to but you got to
[1:19:57] understand God has gave us a sure word
[1:20:00] of promise.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now look verse 15. And if you
[1:20:05] know and if you know that you hear us
[1:20:08] whatsoever we ask, we know that we have
[1:20:12] the what petitions that we desire of
[1:20:15] him. Anything that you could request and
[1:20:18] you get it from God, we know God is
[1:20:20] going to do what? Bring it to his
[1:20:22] children because we asking according to
[1:20:24] his will. Come on now. Look at all these
[1:20:26] testimonies here. You know what they
[1:20:28] got, Sister Sharon? When you was on that
[1:20:30] trip, huh? I felt some of them devils
[1:20:33] didn't believe it. Huh? But that's why
[1:20:35] God allowed you to show that video up
[1:20:37] there. Is that right? God knows
[1:20:39] everything. Uh he came for you to
[1:20:42] testify. Uh when we [snorts] got over
[1:20:44] there, I was telling I was telling
[1:20:46] brother Steve was a lady that I mean a
[1:20:48] gentleman. He fly planes. He'd been
[1:20:50] flying pains planes for 50 years. Uh and
[1:20:53] I said, "Lord, I'm going to ask this man
[1:20:55] something." And when I saw him there at
[1:20:56] the institution, he was there all by
[1:20:59] himself. That I said, "That's the Lord
[1:21:00] there. That's my opportunity right
[1:21:02] there, Brother Robert." He looked around
[1:21:04] in there and I said, "I got a question
[1:21:06] for you." I said, "Do y'all see those um
[1:21:08] um um um lights and stuff up in there?"
[1:21:11] He said, "Yeah." He said, "They got what
[1:21:14] they call Blackhawks."
[1:21:16] He said, "Uned States Air Force got a
[1:21:18] group of pilots they call Blackhawks."
[1:21:20] And when they call them Blackhawks, he
[1:21:22] said they get up there and they fly. I'm
[1:21:24] going to show you the grace God gave
[1:21:26] you. He said, "When they go up there and
[1:21:27] they fly, but they can't take pictures.
[1:21:30] They won't let them take pictures of
[1:21:32] them. You understand?
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Cuz we know they're investigating
[1:21:36] angels. That's right.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; You see, they but they can't. So when
[1:21:40] you brought that there at that level,
[1:21:43] we're talking about prayer tonight,
[1:21:45] right? Remember her testimony? She
[1:21:47] prayed and asked God and went to God and
[1:21:50] made a vow to God and God let you sing
[1:21:53] that supernatural. Is that right? Come
[1:21:55] on now, brother Robin. You needed a
[1:21:58] vehicle. Is that right? We just read go
[1:22:00] to the throne boldly in the time of what
[1:22:03] need. Is that right? We need it. Is that
[1:22:06] right? We needing the finances. Is that
[1:22:08] right? For build this building. Is that
[1:22:10] right? God has been supplying the
[1:22:12] finances for build that building. Is
[1:22:15] that right? Come on now. We got our own
[1:22:18] testimony right there in the midst of
[1:22:20] us. Is that right? Look at the other
[1:22:22] things. God is providing all the things
[1:22:24] of our need. Is that right? He said,
[1:22:26] "You never
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; never never seen the righteous forsaken
[1:22:31] or I see the what? Begging for bread."
[1:22:33] Is that right? Not his bride. Is that
[1:22:36] right? God came down and also gave us a
[1:22:39] word. There's nothing wrong with having
[1:22:40] those riches. You need the riches.
[1:22:42] Someone level of faith is there. Pray.
[1:22:45] Isn't that right?
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Pray and God will get it to you. Is that
[1:22:48] right? Because it's according to what
[1:22:50] his need. You don't have to wait until
[1:22:52] the season. This is the season. Is that
[1:22:55] right? This is the season. This is the
[1:22:58] season to be blessed. He have commanded
[1:23:00] us. He have commissioned us to bless
[1:23:02] you. Is that right? This is the hour for
[1:23:05] it. Uh-huh.

[1:23:26] yourself uh catch a hold of that
[1:23:29] scripture. It's twofold in that
[1:23:31] scripture.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Let me keep going. We going to bust this
[1:23:39] devil up tonight. Help me, Lord. He
[1:23:41] says, "So everything that God has spoken
[1:23:43] his word, receive into the right channel
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; will materialize the word for whatever
[1:23:49] whatever the promise behind it."
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Right. Huh? It is. God will do it.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; He is obligated to do it.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "Then if ye abide in me and my
[1:24:08] word abide in you, then you have as God
[1:24:12] in the word in you." You see, then you
[1:24:15] have God.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; If the word abide in you, you have who?
[1:24:20] God. Amen.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Okay. We consist the body, spirit, and
[1:24:25] soul.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; And the sew is a seed.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; The seed is the word of God.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Father, I'm glad you hid it from the
[1:24:33] wise and imprudent,
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; but you reveal it to us predestinated
[1:24:39] babes. Is that right? Hallelujah.
[1:24:44] You can't lose, saints. You can't lose.
[1:24:47] Okay, you're getting in the channel. You
[1:24:50] got to get out of that wrong channel of
[1:24:52] unbelief hanging around with carnal
[1:24:54] thoughts. Let's keep going. He said
[1:24:57] because now look, he says and believe
[1:24:59] the word. He said just as you believe
[1:25:03] God because it is God and it is
[1:25:07] inseparable.
[1:25:08] Then if you have God's word in you, you
[1:25:11] have God's life in you.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. And listen what we saying. Thank
[1:25:16] you, Jesus. He says it'll have to come.
[1:25:19] Wait, you have God in you. And whatever
[1:25:23] God's word speaks forth out of you,
[1:25:26] it'll have to come to pass just like it
[1:25:29] was spoke from from God.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; You see, that's what Joshua did. Is that
[1:25:34] right? He told Joshua, "My servant Moses
[1:25:37] is dead." Is that right? The Lord showed
[1:25:40] us Sunday morning. Is that right? the
[1:25:42] father, the man, the father that came or
[1:25:44] the man that gave them the talents, he
[1:25:47] went off. Is that right? Hallelujah.
[1:25:49] Then we saw the quote that that was God,
[1:25:52] right? And God now was bringing it back
[1:25:54] on the what? On the church. Is that
[1:25:56] right?
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; When the capstone came down, he's not
[1:25:59] the cornerstone. He's the capstone now.
[1:26:02] And when the capstone came down, uh
[1:26:04] Jesus said, uh, when you seen me, you
[1:26:07] seen the father. Jesus said, "You see
[1:26:09] me, you seen my body. My body and I are
[1:26:11] what? One. Is that right? We're
[1:26:14] connecting now. Is that right? We got
[1:26:16] the same virtues in there. You got the
[1:26:18] same virtue. You got faith. Come on now.
[1:26:20] We just read that. We just read that
[1:26:22] quote. If you got the seed in you, you
[1:26:24] got the word in you. You got God in you.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; You got faith. Is that right? Huh?
[1:26:29] Somebody come to you and ask you for
[1:26:31] prayer. Is that right? Because you got
[1:26:33] what in you? You got virtue in you.
[1:26:34] Right. You got the virtue in you. You
[1:26:37] can't the virtue of God in you. So you
[1:26:39] speak with boldness. Is that right?
[1:26:41] Because you know what's inside of you.
[1:26:43] You got knowledge. Is that right? You
[1:26:45] got knowledge of the word. Is that
[1:26:47] right? You got temperance. Is that
[1:26:49] right? You know how to handle the word.
[1:26:51] Is that right? He's teaching us faith,
[1:26:53] virtue, knowledge, temperance. What?
[1:26:56] Godliness, brotherly kindness. In
[1:26:58] between. Then we got what? The capstone.
[1:27:00] Is that right? We're in the hour.
[1:27:02] Everything is working by faith. It's
[1:27:05] working by love now. [applause]
[1:27:09] No man can't call him the Christ,
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; but by only the Holy Ghost.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is back on the scene.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is speaking for you. The
[1:27:18] Holy Ghost going to use you. That's why
[1:27:20] he said you got five, you got two, and
[1:27:23] you got one. Is that right? And you got
[1:27:25] those talents. Those talents is for a
[1:27:27] purpose. Is that right? Every part of
[1:27:30] this bride of Christ, you have been
[1:27:32] called for a work and for a service. Is
[1:27:35] that right?
[1:27:37] Hallelujah. Let me keep going. Jesus
[1:27:39] said, "Whatever whatever you ask in my
[1:27:41] father's name," he said, "Will I do it?"
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; He said, "Did you ever realize what that
[1:27:45] means?"
[1:27:47] [screaming]
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Look what's getting ready to come. Do
[1:27:52] you realize what that mean?
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Look what he said. He said, "Did you
[1:27:57] ever realize what that mean? You realize
[1:28:00] if we go before God
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; it's just the same as Jesus asking
[1:28:10] himself.
[1:28:19] [applause]
[1:28:19] [cheering]
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "Father,
[1:28:22] I know you always hear me.
[1:28:29] Huh?
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Say, "Father,
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; you think the devil like this kind of
[1:28:33] preaching out there when I go in them
[1:28:34] institutions?" No. And I don't care. I
[1:28:36] got no use for him.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; I got no use for the devil. I've been
[1:28:40] waiting for this pastor.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Just like Just like brother Martin said.
[1:28:44] Huh? Just like brother Martin said,
[1:28:46] "I've been waiting for y'all energy.
[1:28:48] I've been waiting for your energy. I've
[1:28:49] been waiting for y'all energy. I've been
[1:28:51] waiting for this energy. Is that right?"
[1:28:53] Huh? He said Jacob said, "Give me my
[1:28:56] mountain." Is that right?
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Give me my promise inside mine. GIVE IT
[1:29:02] TO me now. This is the season. Give me
[1:29:04] my promise inside. [cheering]
[1:29:08] [applause]
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Every promises is yours.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Let me keep reading. I get to preach. I
[1:29:14] forgot. I ain't got 30 minutes. Help me,
[1:29:16] Lord. He said, look, he says it's just
[1:29:19] the same as Jesus himself praying.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Just the same as Jesus praying. It isn't
[1:29:24] me praying anymore.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; It's not you praying anymore.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; It's Christ praying through you now.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the apostles in the book of
[1:29:36] Acts.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; It was the acts of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:40] through the apostles.
[1:29:42] [cheering and applause]
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; We got confidence. Why? Because they got
[1:29:45] thrown they get thrown off when he say
[1:29:47] the Holy Ghost was not yet given yet.
[1:29:50] And some people saying that the Holy
[1:29:52] Ghost was there. Huh? It twisted their
[1:29:54] minds up, brother. The spirit of Elijah
[1:29:57] was on John the Baptist. It was the Holy
[1:29:59] Ghost, but it was this anointing is the
[1:30:01] anointing of Elijah.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had a different
[1:30:07] anointing.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; It was a covenant anointing. God had to
[1:30:14] use that body. That's exactly right.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; It had to be of fullness for the
[1:30:21] fullness to come in the seven church
[1:30:23] ages.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; WE GOT THE FULLNESS OF THE WORD. WE GOT
[1:30:29] GOD HERE HIMSELF DWELLING INSIDE OF YOU
[1:30:32] BECAUSE THE WORD IS THERE.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; The devil won't come near this.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; He won't come near this confidence.
[1:30:44] perfect confidence cuz we got a perfect
[1:30:47] word.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Look what he says.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now help me Lord if I come in
[1:30:53] his name and he recognized his name."
[1:30:57] And Jesus said, "Whatever you ask in the
[1:30:59] father's name," he says, "I do that." He
[1:31:01] says, "Then go to the father in Jesus
[1:31:04] name."
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; It isn't it isn't me praying anymore.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; It's Jesus.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; It's his spirit praying through me.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Come on now. We going to bust it. That's
[1:31:13] why I'm telling you. We going to bust
[1:31:15] them up tonight.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; We going to bust him up tonight.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; These young children got to see you. Is
[1:31:20] that right?
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; One member of Rohia, she probably didn't
[1:31:24] believe when Peter was locked up.
[1:31:26] Brother Pastor, they was in a prayer
[1:31:28] meeting that night.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Huh? When Peter was locked up, they done
[1:31:31] chopped off John the Baptist head. Peter
[1:31:33] was next. Is that right? But Peter time
[1:31:35] wasn't there yet. So they was in there
[1:31:37] in the prayer meeting. Is that right?
[1:31:39] and wrote her maybe she didn't believe.
[1:31:40] She a little girl like one of these
[1:31:42] children didn't believe. Is that right?
[1:31:44] And we going to pray into Peter. And
[1:31:46] somebody Benjamin, you came over and you
[1:31:48] said, "Keep praying, baby. We going to
[1:31:50] get Peter out of there." Huh? Keep
[1:31:52] praying. We going to get Peter out of
[1:31:55] there. Is that right? Keep praying. We
[1:31:57] going to get Peter out of there. Is that
[1:31:59] right? Maybe she the one didn't believe,
[1:32:02] but she had to go open the door. Is that
[1:32:04] right? She knew that prayer worked. Now
[1:32:07] you couldn't take it from her because it
[1:32:09] was none of prayer. It was Christ
[1:32:12] praying through them. Is that right?
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; We went from the throne to the throne.
[1:32:16] From the holy to from the holy to the
[1:32:19] holiness. Is that right? First we came
[1:32:22] through justification, sanctification,
[1:32:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Uh then he
[1:32:26] takes us into what? The holiness of
[1:32:28] holy. Right. Once the veil air is
[1:32:30] ripped. Is that right? After [snorts]
[1:32:32] you got your adoption, your adoption
[1:32:34] bring your position. It places you. It
[1:32:37] positions you. Is that right? Then once
[1:32:39] you now you knew what happened on
[1:32:41] Calvary, we know what happened on
[1:32:43] Calvary. Jesus ripped the veil. Uh now
[1:32:46] we were able to go to the holiness of
[1:32:48] holies. Is that right? Because Jesus
[1:32:51] died on the cross for you and I came
[1:32:54] down. What happened? We needed a kinsman
[1:32:57] redeemer. In the garden it fell. Uh down
[1:32:59] there in the garden, you Adam and Eve
[1:33:02] what? Lost the what? The They lost the
[1:33:04] rights to the to the deed. Is that
[1:33:06] right? The abstract title deed. They
[1:33:09] lost the right to the abstract title
[1:33:11] deed. Uh but they went back to God. Is
[1:33:14] that right? Adam was put on the outside
[1:33:17] of the garden. But what do we need? We
[1:33:19] needed a kinsman redeemer. Everybody
[1:33:22] needed a kinsman redeemer. We were born
[1:33:24] in sin, shaped in iniquity, coming to
[1:33:26] the world speaking lies. We got
[1:33:28] confidence because we know it wasn't a
[1:33:30] fruit that was in the garden. Is that
[1:33:32] right? We got boldness. We can go to the
[1:33:35] throne because we know what happened
[1:33:37] there. Is that right? We got boldness.
[1:33:39] We know about the trinity. Is that
[1:33:41] right? We know how to lead someone to
[1:33:44] salvation. Is that right? We know what
[1:33:46] truly repentance is. Is that right? A
[1:33:49] godless sorrow brings a godly repentance
[1:33:51] that he doesn't have to repent of no
[1:33:54] more. Is that right? Then we know what
[1:33:56] sanctify is. Is is that right?
[1:33:58] Sanctified by the washing of the water
[1:34:00] of the word. Why? Because we had a
[1:34:02] perfect word that came in through
[1:34:04] Lutheran. Is that right? Luther
[1:34:06] justified him. Is that right? We had a
[1:34:08] word that come through Luther that would
[1:34:10] justify us. We got perfect confidence
[1:34:13] when we're leading someone through
[1:34:15] justification. Then we got over there
[1:34:17] sanctification. We had they had a
[1:34:19] perfect word in their time when Wesley
[1:34:21] was there on the scene. It was a perfect
[1:34:23] word. Is that right? Then now we came in
[1:34:26] the end. Where did we came in towards
[1:34:28] the end? The Pentecostal came. Oh my. Is
[1:34:30] that it? Ah, let me wind it up. Help me,
[1:34:33] Lord. He said, "Look, look is here.
[1:34:38] I'mma jump to the spot right here." He
[1:34:40] said, "Look." He says, "So then,"
[1:34:43] he says, "It can't." He says, "And I
[1:34:46] received." Help me, Lord. He says his
[1:34:49] spirit praying through me and then I got
[1:34:53] to receive what I asked for
[1:34:57] because he said it.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; He said it and it's God's own word.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; It can not do anything else but produce
[1:35:11] just what it said. Amen.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; So then we believe that we and this is
[1:35:19] the confidence we have in God that we
[1:35:24] get what we ask for for he is God
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; and cannot take back his word. He's got
[1:35:33] to stay with his word. God bless you
[1:35:36] saints.
[1:35:38] [applause]
[1:35:45] Hallelujah.
[1:35:49] Pastoral.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And amen. Confidence.

[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; As you play softly
[1:39:57] in second king chapter 19,
[1:40:01] I'm going to read.
[1:40:05] Hallelujah.
[1:40:07] I'm going to start by verse 8.
[1:40:10] 2 Kings chapter 19 verse 8.
[1:40:15] The Bible say so Rab Shak
[1:40:21] which was an officer to the king of
[1:40:23] Assyrian sent to attack Jerusalem in the
[1:40:27] time of Hezekiah.
[1:40:29] The Bible say Rab Shake returned and
[1:40:32] found the king of Assyria waring against
[1:40:35] Limbna
[1:40:37] for he had heard that he [music] was
[1:40:39] departed from Lakish.
[1:40:42] And when he heard say of Tiraa, king of
[1:40:45] Ethiopia,
[1:40:47] behold, he come out to fight against
[1:40:49] thee, he sent [music] messenger against
[1:40:54] un again unto Hezekiah, saying,
[1:40:59] Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah, king of
[1:41:02] Judah, saying, [music] Let not thy God
[1:41:06] in whom thou trusted deceived.
[1:41:09] Can God deceive somebody?
[1:41:11] No, he says, "Saying Jerusalem shall not
[1:41:15] be delivered into the hand of the king
[1:41:17] of Assyria. Behold, thou has heard what
[1:41:20] the kings of Assyria have done to all
[1:41:23] lands by destroying them utterly,
[1:41:27] and shalt thou be delivered?
[1:41:30] Have the gods of the nations delivered
[1:41:32] them which my father have destroyed as
[1:41:36] Goen, as Heron, as Raz, and the children
[1:41:40] of Eden, which were in Telasa.
[1:41:44] Where is the king of Hamoth, and the
[1:41:46] king of Arpad, and the king of the city
[1:41:49] of Sepharim, and Hina, and Ava? And
[1:41:54] Hezekiah received the letter of the hand
[1:41:58] of the messenger and read it. And
[1:42:02] Hezekiah went up into the house of the
[1:42:05] Lord. So he received a bad news,
[1:42:09] a threat coming through a letter and the
[1:42:13] Bible say he went into the house of the
[1:42:15] Lord. Today we're not praying from home.
[1:42:18] We went, we came into the house of the
[1:42:20] Lord. The Bible say that Hezekiah went
[1:42:23] up into the house of the Lord and spread
[1:42:26] it before the Lord. He took the letter.
[1:42:30] He took the bad report. He took the the
[1:42:32] the the the
[1:42:34] threat that came through the messenger.
[1:42:37] He didn't call anyone. He didn't call
[1:42:40] anybody to explain the cause of what was
[1:42:43] going on. The Bible says that he went
[1:42:46] into the house of the Lord. And when he
[1:42:48] went into the house of the Lord, he
[1:42:50] spread the letter before the Lord. I
[1:42:54] don't know what's going on in your life,
[1:42:56] but you came into the house of the Lord.
[1:42:59] Whatever you have need of tonight, let's
[1:43:02] spread it. Not before a pastor, not
[1:43:05] before the deacon, not before one
[1:43:07] another, but let's spread it before the
[1:43:10] Lord like Hezekiah did. The Bible say he
[1:43:13] went up into the house of the Lord and
[1:43:15] [music] spread it before the Lord. And
[1:43:17] Hezekiah prayed before the Lord, and
[1:43:20] say, "Oh Lord, God of Israel, which
[1:43:23] dwelleth [music]
[1:43:24] between the Caribbeans,
[1:43:27] thou art the God, even thy Lord of all
[1:43:31] the kingdom of the earth, that has made
[1:43:33] heaven [music] and earth a worship. Lord
[1:43:36] bow down thine ear and hear open Lord
[1:43:40] thine eyes and see hear the words of
[1:43:43] Sarimb which has which has sent him to
[1:43:46] reproach the living God of a truth Lord
[1:43:50] the king of Assyria has destroyed the
[1:43:52] nations of the land. In other word the
[1:43:55] report [music] that came part of it is
[1:43:57] true. It is true people died with
[1:44:00] diabetes. It is true people died with
[1:44:03] cancer. It is true people die with heart
[1:44:06] problem with kidney issue but that is
[1:44:10] not the end. Let's bring it before the
[1:44:13] Lord and let's spread it in the house of
[1:44:15] the Lord. The Bible continue he says the
[1:44:19] Bible continue and say and have cast
[1:44:22] their god into the fire for they were no
[1:44:25] gods but the work of man's hand wood and
[1:44:28] stone therefore they have destroyed
[1:44:30] them. In other word, if those nation
[1:44:32] fell, they fell because the god that
[1:44:35] they worship were ado. But we are not
[1:44:38] worshiping an adult god. We are
[1:44:40] worshiping the true and the living God.
[1:44:43] Verse 19, the Bible say, "Now therefore,
[1:44:45] oh Lord God, I beseech thee, save thy
[1:44:49] eyes out of his hand, [music] that all
[1:44:51] the kingdom of the earth may know that
[1:44:54] thou art the Lord God, even [music] thou
[1:44:57] only." Then Isaiah the son of Amos sent
[1:45:01] to Hezekiah saying, "Thou saith the Lord
[1:45:04] God of Israel, that which thou had
[1:45:07] prayed to me against Sarib, king of
[1:45:10] Assyria, I have heard."
[1:45:14] He prayed in [music] the temple and God
[1:45:16] sent a prophet from somewhere to tell
[1:45:19] him that whatever you were doing in the
[1:45:21] temple in the church that night whatever
[1:45:24] you were doing the request that you
[1:45:26] brought and spread [music] before me I
[1:45:28] have heard your prayer we don't want to
[1:45:30] leave this church with our request let's
[1:45:33] bring our letter let's bring our burden
[1:45:35] let's bring our problem let's spread
[1:45:37] that before the Lord tonight
[1:45:40] but before we started it's a weeks of
[1:45:42] thanksgiving Let's all lift up our
[1:45:44] hands, our voices first. Lift up your
[1:45:47] hand if you can and let's thank [music]
[1:45:49] God first for everything that he have
[1:45:53] done for you. Throughout this entire
[1:45:55] year, you could have been dead. Accident
[1:45:59] after accident, you're still alive.
[1:46:02] Consult after consult, you're still
[1:46:04] there. Going from different places, God
[1:46:08] is still there for you. You thought
[1:46:10] you're not going to make it here. you
[1:46:12] almost toward the end. Bill behind after
[1:46:16] Bill behind. Still you alive. Still we
[1:46:19] have food. Still we have a place that we
[1:46:22] can call a home. Let's lift up our
[1:46:24] voices and pray unto the Lord. Heavenly
[1:46:27] Father, Lord, we are approaching you
[1:46:30] humbly tonight. Father, first of all,
[1:46:33] thanking you for the word that you
[1:46:34] [music] have given us tonight to use
[1:46:36] your servant to speak to us and to
[1:46:39] remind us a word of faith so that we
[1:46:42] know that when we are approaching you,
[1:46:44] we are approaching boldly the throne of
[1:46:46] grace. Not with our own Lord, Father,
[1:46:49] righteousness, but with the
[1:46:51] righteousness that you reap on the cross
[1:46:53] for us, Lord. Father, we want to worship
[1:46:56] you first and we want to also thank you,
[1:46:59] Father. Thank [music] you for everything
[1:47:01] that you have done to us in this church.
[1:47:04] Thank you for everything that you have
[1:47:06] done to each family of this church.
[1:47:09] Visible and invisible audience Lord.
[1:47:13] Father, thank you for the building
[1:47:14] project because every single step we can
[1:47:18] see your hand, the mighty hand of
[1:47:20] Jehovah being displayed in a
[1:47:22] supernatural and miraculous way. Lord,
[1:47:25] father, it's absolutely impossible for
[1:47:28] us to be able to tackle such a big job
[1:47:31] without having a big God that is alive
[1:47:34] and that is working in the midst of his
[1:47:36] children. Father, many time we were
[1:47:38] sick. Many time we were affected by the
[1:47:41] weather, but not one time did we go to
[1:47:44] the grave. Father, every single time you
[1:47:47] showed up, you come and you touch our
[1:47:49] body, you strengthen us, Lord. Father,
[1:47:52] through prayer, through medicine, or
[1:47:54] whichever way you chose, Lord, Father,
[1:47:56] to bring healing. But we can testify
[1:47:58] tonight and thank you for every single
[1:48:01] healing you brought on our way. Healing
[1:48:03] off our our spouse, healing off our
[1:48:06] children, healing off my brother,

[1:48:19] they don't know [music] what to do with
[1:48:20] this government shutdown. But by your
[1:48:23] grace and your love, Father, you have
[1:48:25] granted out to us a job, a stable job

[1:48:52] us the Holy Spirit posing in our soul,
[1:48:55] in our body, in our mind. Father, every
[1:48:58] single day we can testify of the
[1:49:01] leadership of the Holy Spirit. We can
[1:49:03] see how you open the word, Lord, and
[1:49:05] recognize that this is not the work of a
[1:49:08] man, but this is the supernatural work
[1:49:10] of the Holy Spirit. Lord, thank you for
[1:49:13] being there in every service. Thank you,
[1:49:15] Lord, Father, for musician that you have

[1:49:29] of the kingdom. Thank you for a natural
[1:49:31] family. Thank you, oh God, Father, for
[1:49:34] being able to have a sound man in the
[1:49:36] midst of a chaos that is going on, Lord,
[1:49:39] Father, with this world. Father, wars
[1:49:41] and all kind of trouble left and right.
[1:49:43] But by your grace, Lord, Father, you
[1:49:45] keeping our mind sane and centered
[1:49:48] toward Calvary. Father, if we continue,
[1:49:51] Lord, Father, to number the things that
[1:49:53] you have done to us. Even when we are
[1:49:55] even unconscious, sleeping on our bed,
[1:49:58] Father, you are still there protecting
[1:50:00] us. Whenever we have a need, you always
[1:50:02] been Jehovah Jara. You [music] have been
[1:50:04] always Jehovah Rafa. You have been
[1:50:07] always El Shadai, the one that give us
[1:50:09] strength. Father and Lord, you have
[1:50:11] given us again such a great opportunity
[1:50:14] to be able to come into your house like
[1:50:16] Hezekiah and to spread Lord Father the
[1:50:19] letter, the burden before you. Father,
[1:50:22] we want to thank you for everything.
[1:50:24] Thank you [music] Lord Father for the
[1:50:25] marriages in the church. Thank you
[1:50:27] father for the deliverance that we see
[1:50:29] in the family. Thank you oh God for the
[1:50:32] transformation we see in the life of the
[1:50:34] young man, the young sisters and the
[1:50:36] children. Thank you Lord Father for
[1:50:38] touching Lord testimonies after
[1:50:40] testimonies almost every services even
[1:50:43] Lord Father beyond this corner we
[1:50:45] [music] hear testimonies of things that
[1:50:47] you're doing in the life of your
[1:50:49] children father we want to appreciate
[1:50:51] you [music] we want to thank you we want
[1:50:53] to express our gratitude from the bottom
[1:50:55] of our heart and to tell you Lord Father
[1:50:58] thank you for everything that you have
[1:51:01] been doing for us in the name of Jesus
[1:51:03] Christ we are approaching you.
[1:51:06] Hallelujah Lord brother. Amen. Thank you
[1:51:10] Jesus. The Bible says that God does not
[1:51:14] hear sinners. We know that we are not
[1:51:16] sinners. We are people that have been
[1:51:19] saved already by grace by the grace of
[1:51:21] God. The Bible says in the book of
[1:51:24] Jeremiah 33:3,
[1:51:26] the Bible say, "Call unto me and I will
[1:51:29] answer thee and show thee great great
[1:51:32] and mighty things which thou knowest
[1:51:34] not." But before we approach him, we
[1:51:36] want to make sure if there was anywhere
[1:51:38] [music] that we grieve the Holy Spirit
[1:51:40] somehow on our walk. We did something
[1:51:43] that we are not even aware of or maybe
[1:51:45] we stumble someone by the [music] things
[1:51:48] that we have done. We don't want
[1:51:50] anything to be an interference between
[1:51:52] us and our maker. We want to make sure
[1:51:55] [music] that whatever was done, even
[1:51:57] that which we don't remember,
[1:51:59] we want to remove any condemnation from
[1:52:02] our heart. So that when we approach God
[1:52:04] like we have been taught tonight,
[1:52:06] approach him with all boldness, knowing
[1:52:09] that our hearts are clean and that
[1:52:11] everything was put under the blood. So
[1:52:14] let's go ahead and express our
[1:52:15] repentance tonight and put everything
[1:52:17] under the blood. So we make sure nothing
[1:52:20] is going to be blocking us because there
[1:52:22] is no fellowship without the shedding of
[1:52:24] the blood. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are
[1:52:27] approaching you again, Father. Lord
[1:52:29] asking you to forgive us for everything
[1:52:32] that we grieve the Holy Spirit. Father,
[1:52:35] anything that we have done in our mind,
[1:52:38] Father, in our word, in our action, in
[1:52:41] our reaction, any meditation that was
[1:52:44] not pleasing unto any, Lord, Father,
[1:52:46] negligence in our Christian walk, Lord,
[1:52:49] Father, anything Lord Father, that we
[1:52:51] could have done and stumble someone,
[1:52:54] Lord, Father, without even being aware
[1:52:56] of, Father, anywhere, Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:52:59] that we didn't reflect you the way we
[1:53:02] were supposed to reflect you, Lord.
[1:53:04] Father, we are coming Lord as we rub the
[1:53:06] shoulder with the world asking you to
[1:53:09] forgive us Lord. Father, forgive your
[1:53:11] children. Forgive the congregation.
[1:53:13] Forgive Lord Father each one of us
[1:53:15] tonight and those Lord that have joined
[1:53:17] us with prayer online Lord. Father, I
[1:53:20] pray that the blood of the lamb may come
[1:53:23] down, Lord. Father, and sanctify our
[1:53:26] body, sanctify our spirit, sanctify our
[1:53:30] soul, sanctify our homes, Lord. Sanctify
[1:53:33] each person here, sanctify those that
[1:53:36] are streaming, Lord. Father, may your
[1:53:38] blood not only sanctify, but may the
[1:53:41] blood cover us, Lord, and wash us up
[1:53:43] completely so that we can be seen under
[1:53:46] the blood, Lord. Father, you the God
[1:53:48] that forgive every transgression, every
[1:53:51] iniquity, Lord, things that we know
[1:53:53] better not to do. And sometime we find
[1:53:56] ourselves caught up, Lord. Father, in
[1:53:58] the time of pressure that we do them,
[1:54:00] Lord, Father, we ask you to forgive us,
[1:54:02] Lord. Father, may you remove anything
[1:54:05] Lord, any word, Lord, Father, any
[1:54:07] thought, Father, any meditation, any
[1:54:10] action that have been recorded in the
[1:54:12] air, Father, your prophet told us that
[1:54:14] it takes only the blood of the lamb to
[1:54:17] wipe everything, Lord. May your blood
[1:54:19] come tonight, Lord. Father, and cleans
[1:54:21] our life completely, so that nothing can
[1:54:24] stand between us and you but the blood
[1:54:27] of the lamb. Because when you look at us
[1:54:29] through the blood, Father, we have been
[1:54:31] seen Surely pure Lord Father as the
[1:54:35] righteousness of Christ is upon us Lord.
[1:54:38] That's why we wait on one another asking
[1:54:40] you to forgive us Lord. We don't want
[1:54:42] anything to be a hindrance to our prayer
[1:54:45] tonight. We don't want oh Father any sin
[1:54:48] Lord Father be a hindrance to the prayer
[1:54:50] or the blessing of someone or the person
[1:54:53] next to us Lord. But father may you
[1:54:55] remove everything even that which we
[1:54:57] don't remember we can't recall now like
[1:55:00] David spoke one time of presumptious sin
[1:55:03] father forgive us for anything remove it
[1:55:06] completely so that lord father our heart
[1:55:09] can be lord father feel free and
[1:55:11] lightened lord father in your presence
[1:55:14] knowing lord father that we are
[1:55:15] approaching a father a father who is our
[1:55:18] maker who is our creator and our husband
[1:55:21] lord father we asking you tonight Lord
[1:55:24] May you forgive us father in the name of
[1:55:27] Jesus Christ Jesus precious name. Glory
[1:55:31] to God. Hallelujah.
[1:55:34] Continue to pray again.
[1:55:38] Amen.
[1:55:40] Thank you Jesus.
[1:56:07] continue to pray.
[1:56:15] Make sure everything is under
[1:56:23] this opportunity like this. in the
[1:56:25] praises.
[1:56:42] We know that his presence is here
[1:56:44] already.
[1:56:47] We have invited him is in this place.
[1:56:50] Let's express our worship tonight. If we
[1:56:54] were created,
[1:56:57] we were created to worship God because
[1:57:00] God is an object of worship.
[1:57:03] Let's express our heart tonight unto him
[1:57:07] and tell him what we know about him.
[1:57:10] What we know by revelation of who he is
[1:57:13] for us.
[1:57:16] Let's make love to him.

[1:57:29] Father, you spoke in your word
[1:57:32] that you are seeking those worship that
[1:57:35] will worship you in the spirit and in
[1:57:38] the truth.

[1:57:42] is the message of the hour. You have
[1:57:44] given us your spirit and your presence
[1:57:46] is already here. That's why we didn't
[1:57:49] want to invite you because You were
[1:57:51] already welcome into this place Lord
[1:57:54] because Lord Father we don't want to
[1:57:56] pray only with understanding but we want
[1:57:59] to pray into the spirit Lord so that the
[1:58:02] spirit can take over and express things
[1:58:05] in the better way than Lord father which
[1:58:07] we can express with our own mind. Lord,
[1:58:11] we worship you because you are God and
[1:58:14] there is no God that is like you and
[1:58:17] your name is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:58:20] Father, you're the one that have created
[1:58:23] everything and there is nothing that
[1:58:26] existed without you being the creator
[1:58:28] Lord. Father, you are the word that was
[1:58:32] the logos that came out of God. Because

[1:58:40] word was God and that word was made
[1:58:42] flesh and you express yourself in human

[2:00:11] adoration from your children. Lord,

[2:00:16] hell. You're the one that overcome
[2:00:18] [singing]

[2:02:06] honor, to receive praise, to receive
[2:02:10] glory. And there is no one like you,
[2:02:13] Father. The God of Jacob, the God of
[2:02:17] Israel, the God of Abraham, the God of
[2:02:21] the prophet, the God of William Marion
[2:02:23] brother.
[2:02:27] Your name is Jesus.
[2:02:31] What a beautiful name it is.

[2:02:42] Thank you, Lord.
[2:02:46] Hallelujah.
[2:02:54] Thank you Jesus.
[2:02:58] Receive all the worship
[2:03:01] from your children tonight
[2:03:08] as you have given us this privilege to
[2:03:11] approach you to pour our heart and to
[2:03:14] express Lord Father to communicate to
[2:03:17] commune with you tonight.
[2:03:20] Father, we want to spread every burden
[2:03:24] that we have before you.
[2:03:28] You're the husband of the bride. You're
[2:03:31] the one that took all responsibility
[2:03:35] and the government set up stand upon
[2:03:38] your should
[2:03:42] where you are whether you sitting or
[2:03:45] kneeling or standing.
[2:03:47] Take this time and talk to him about
[2:03:50] your problem. Hezekiah has his problem.
[2:03:55] He went into the house of the Lord. He
[2:03:58] spread his problem before the king.
[2:04:01] before the Lord, before the living and
[2:04:03] the true God. And God answered him and
[2:04:07] brought him deliverance. God is still
[2:04:09] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:04:13] Now, it's your time to ask because he
[2:04:15] say, "Ask and it shall be given to you."
[2:04:18] He spoke to us that he's the rich God.
[2:04:22] He's the God that can supply our every
[2:04:24] need according to his riches in glory.
[2:04:28] Whether it's a [music] spiritual need,
[2:04:30] whether it's financial need, whether
[2:04:33] it's a material need, whether it's a
[2:04:35] physical need, whatever need it is, this
[2:04:39] is your time to express yourself and to
[2:04:41] talk to your maker and ask him what you
[2:04:44] want. Ask him boldly. Ask him
[2:04:48] abundantly.
[2:04:50] Ask him because He's the God
[2:04:53] that answers prayer. And before we even
[2:04:56] speak, he already heard and he knows.
[2:04:59] But he want to hear. He loves to hear
[2:05:01] his children because our prayer David
[2:05:04] say [music] it is his delight. God want
[2:05:07] to hear you talking to him. Lift up your
[2:05:10] voice and speak to him tonight.
[2:05:35] Father
[2:05:37] as you [music] spoke to us to come
[2:05:39] boldly before you in the name of Jesus
[2:05:43] Christ are we coming before you Lord
[2:05:46] because you spoke to us that when we
[2:05:48] come in that name it is exactly like you
[2:05:52] yourself speaking and praying father
[2:05:56] Lord Lord, there is no beautiful name,
[2:05:59] no name that is above all name but that
[2:06:02] name and we are entering in with our
[2:06:06] request in that name in the name of
[2:06:08] Jesus Christ. Father, you call us to a
[2:06:13] great work. The hour is [music] very
[2:06:15] late and the history of the nation is
[2:06:19] just about to close. [music] And father,
[2:06:23] it doesn't take the wisdom of a man
[2:06:26] because the wisdom of a man proved
[2:06:28] completely to fail. Man have been into
[2:06:32] the tree of the knowledge of good and
[2:06:34] evil and brought death into the human
[2:06:37] race and death has been the sentence.
[2:06:40] And even the anointing that is Lord
[2:06:42] Father going upon the world now is an
[2:06:46] anointing of death. But father heaven
[2:06:49] was turned loose. Lord, you pour down
[2:06:52] yourself in the fullness of your word.
[2:06:55] And you have given us, Lord, Father,
[2:06:57] such a great responsibility as 11 worker
[2:07:00] hours, Lord, in the time when you just
[2:07:04] getting ready to turn back to the Jews,
[2:07:06] Lord. And father looking at the
[2:07:08] seriousness Lord of the task we want to
[2:07:11] always come before you to humble oursel
[2:07:14] before your presence to ask you Lord
[2:07:17] Father to come and to refill us like you
[2:07:20] did the disciple Lord because without
[2:07:22] you we cannot do anything Lord Father
[2:07:25] there is not ability in us but that
[2:07:28] which you have placed in us for the work
[2:07:30] of this hour Lord [music] that's why
[2:07:32] Lord Father we are opening lifting up
[2:07:35] our cup tonight Lord asking you, oh God,
[2:07:38] that you open the windows of heaven
[2:07:40] again. May you pour down your spirit
[2:07:43] again and refill us with your holy
[2:07:45] spirit so that Lord Father, our cup can
[2:07:49] run over, Lord, and we can be able to
[2:07:52] help somebody, Lord. Father, fill us
[2:07:54] with your wisdom. Fill us, Lord, Father,
[2:07:57] because Lord Jesus Christ, we don't want
[2:07:59] to do this work and interject the human
[2:08:02] element, Lord. Father, they thought that
[2:08:04] the reasoning of a man brought death to
[2:08:07] human race, Lord. But Father, we want to
[2:08:10] be completely surrendered unto the
[2:08:12] leadership of the Holy Spirit as you
[2:08:15] spoke through Brother Brham that you are
[2:08:17] the one that surrender him Lord unto
[2:08:19] you, Lord. Father, may you surrender me.
[2:08:22] May you surrender spoken word. [music]
[2:08:25] May you surrender every family present
[2:08:27] here. May you surrender those that are
[2:08:29] online, Father, to you, Lord. Father may
[2:08:32] we leave everything that is contrary to
[2:08:35] your word. Every sin that Lord Father
[2:08:38] easily beset us. Any Lord Father weight
[2:08:41] that we carrying up Lord. Father may you
[2:08:44] cut them loose tonight Lord by the power
[2:08:47] of the Holy Spirit.
[2:08:50] Lord we pray that you come down and fill
[2:08:53] our body, fill our spirit, fill our
[2:08:56] soul, fill every cell of our body with
[2:09:00] your presence, Lord. Father, your
[2:09:02] prophet [music] say that this body are
[2:09:05] made by cosmic light. But he spoke he
[2:09:08] said that if cosmic light can be pushes
[2:09:11] and eternal light can enter in father
[2:09:14] things will begin to take place Lord.
[2:09:17] Lord, that's what we asking in the name
[2:09:19] of Jesus Christ. Father, that eternal
[2:09:22] light, the light of God, the pillar of
[2:09:25] fire may come down tonight, Lord.
[2:09:28] Father, every young man present tonight.
[2:09:31] Father, MAY THE BAPTISM OF FIRE COME
[2:09:34] DOWN AND BURN EVERYTHING THAT IS
[2:09:36] CONTRARY to your word that is not like
[2:09:39] your divine nature. Anything Lord, any
[2:09:42] curses as you spoke on Sunday from our
[2:09:45] families Lord, any trait, Lord, any
[2:09:49] weaknesses that the devil continue to
[2:09:51] use all the time to bring your CHILDREN
[2:09:54] DOWN, FATHER, BURN THEM UP BY THE POWER
[2:09:56] OF THE Holy Spirit and the Holy Fire of
[2:10:00] God [music] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:10:03] Lord, may your light quicken the
[2:10:05] predestinated seed tonight. [music] May
[2:10:08] you fill my family. May you feel my
[2:10:10] children. May you fill every young man
[2:10:13] here. May you come down Lord Father Lord
[2:10:16] and penetrate every avenue, every aspect
[2:10:19] of our life, any room, Lord, Father, of
[2:10:23] our houses, Lord. Come,
[2:10:26] come and feel
[2:10:31] because you spoke in your word that it's
[2:10:33] [music] not by might, it's not by power,
[2:10:37] but it takes the Holy Spirit. Lord, we
[2:10:40] learned from a long time that Lord,
[2:10:42] [music] Father, we cannot do anything on
[2:10:44] ourself. That's why we asking you to
[2:10:47] come and move me aside. Be the pastor of
[2:10:50] this church. Be the [music] deacon of
[2:10:52] this church. Be the trustee of this
[2:10:55] church. Be the musician of this church.
[2:10:58] Be the treasurer of this church. Be the
[2:11:01] song leader of this church. Be the
[2:11:04] congregation of this church. Visible and
[2:11:07] invisible. Be the technician in this
[2:11:09] church. So that everything, everybody
[2:11:13] can be Lord anointed by your spirit
[2:11:16] Lord. and not only anointed but filled
[2:11:18] by your spirit. Father, Lord Jesus
[2:11:21] Christ, I recall on the day of
[2:11:23] Pentecost, there was 120 people that
[2:11:27] gathered together in the upper room, not
[2:11:29] one of them left the building without
[2:11:32] the Holy Ghost. Father I pray that
[2:11:34] tonight Lord as we coming into your
[2:11:37] presence we can ask many things but the
[2:11:40] most important things Lord I'm asking
[2:11:42] for myself and for this church Lord
[2:11:45] father for the children the young men so
[2:11:48] father is for you to come down and fill
[2:11:51] like in the day of Pentecost we fill us
[2:11:53] with your Holy Spirit fill those Lord
[2:11:56] Father that don't have it fill them
[2:11:58] completely until Lord Father they cup
[2:12:01] run over until Lord Father will be a
[2:12:04] church where young men are directed by
[2:12:06] [music] the Holy Spirit. Young sisters
[2:12:09] are directed by the Holy Spirit. Where
[2:12:11] the ties of the world will be completely
[2:12:13] removed, completely cut off. Lord Father
[2:12:16] [music] removed completely taken off
[2:12:19] from the young man. That worldliness can
[2:12:21] remove can be the grip of worldliness
[2:12:24] can completely be away from us Lord. But
[2:12:27] Lord father so wherever where they going
[2:12:29] in the school in the university in our
[2:12:33] work we may reflect you. We may be Lord
[2:12:37] [music] father that living a piece
[2:12:39] because the word with the dynamic is
[2:12:43] what is needed [music] Lord. Father you
[2:12:45] say that you sent your word and your
[2:12:47] word will now return to you for it. And
[2:12:50] father the word is coming every time.
[2:12:52] And Lord Father we trust in you. We are
[2:12:55] asking for a [music] rain tonight
[2:12:58] to water. Water Lord Father. Water the
[2:13:02] families. Water Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:13:05] Because when your presence enter in Lord
[2:13:08] Father, not only will it quicken the
[2:13:10] body, not only will it quicken the
[2:13:13] predestinated seed, but even the body
[2:13:16] will be quickened so that high blood
[2:13:18] pressure will leave. [music]
[2:13:20] So that high cholesterol will leave so
[2:13:23] that allergies will begin to depart. So
[2:13:26] that any trouble, any malfunctioning of
[2:13:29] the body can be corrected by the
[2:13:32] supernatural presence of the living
[2:13:34] [music] God in a supernatural temple
[2:13:36] that has been redeemed by the blood of
[2:13:38] the lamb. Oh God, help us.
