it felt as if someone was taking a na knife and just soaring at my teeth and I couldn't go to sleep but eventually I did fall asleep with the pain and I was thinking I have a dentist but it's too late to call him so I fell asleep and at 3:00 I woke up oh my goodness it was so bad I I felt literally like I was about to cry and I said Lord if I could just get like a painkiller or some numbing spray to just get the pain away because it's too much I can't sleep and nothing interferes with my sleep so I said Lord I'm a dentist but then yoked woke up and said yoked you have a dentist only a dentist what else do you have and I said Lord this pain even though it is bursting through my mouth so badly I'm going to speak that this pain will go away and I will testify in church tomorrow night and the pain Rose worse than ever like the boy with the fits it was bad and I said Lord I still I'm claiming it I'm claiming it since I don't know how I don't know when but that pain left and I was sound

foolishness I'm I'm going to give you one it's in Jas a secret believer 1955 if you need more you tell me I will load it in the morning as much as you want Amen brother Bram said the patient then this is in paragraph 21 in the middle he said the patient then that the evil has gone out of the patient the cancer is dead for a few days they feel fine like the Cataract tumor or whatever it may be they feel fine for a few days and and then the first thing you know it begin to swell swell and then if the patient is not truly instructed in another place if I'm not mistaken he say thought if the patient is not really instructed in the word of God they shall lose their healing as sure as anything because they get sick and get twice as bad as they ever was and and that is the best sign you have ever had that you are here so when you pray for a to fake and the to fake increase exactly it's a best sign that the devil got a hit and that devil need to go amen amen glory to God Amen so keep on chewing on the word of God continue to stay in the word continue to meditate and everything will be all right I'm not preaching tonight I'm getting a little break but I have uh Brothers around brother

show by raising your hand if you have a need you can show by raising your hand let's bow our hearts Heavenly Father we come to you tonight because we believe you made us to be Believers father you saved us by grace through faith and this faith is not of our own but it is a gift of God lord there's something that you placed in us to believe the prophet calls it the seed The Germ seed of eternal life Lord we did not apply for that we did not ask for that but you gave us by grace and tonight we are exercising our faith we are raising our hands to you believing what you already did for us upon the cross of Calvary we thank you Father for the testimonies that we have heard tonight and the testimonies oh God that are yet to come Lord we thank you Father even for the requests that are being raised this time this hour that you are more than able to deliver each and every one of them the prophet says Lord if you were here in your Corporal body you would not be able to save anyone but you would simply say I've already done it for you on Calvary we thank you Lord for what you did for us we are committing now this service into your hands may you take the lips of Cl Lord may you take father a man that is of a flesh may you anoint him Lord that you may be able to minister to your people we are commuting each and everyone that is here in The Invisible and invisible audience into your hands in Jesus Christ name we pray amen God bless you you may have your seats like to greet you in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen uh trusting that you are all doing being find by the grace of God I greet you in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ the name that is above every name that the whole family on Earth the whole family on in heaven is named Jesus it's higher than the name that is in the white house it's higher than any name that can be named anything that can be named is under the name of Jesus whether they call it cancer whether they call it blood pressure whether they call it anything that can be named is under the name of Jesus praise be to God so happy to be in church with you tonight uh this is our second home and we always uh appreciate when we come back here somebody would say brother Aaron uh uh do you can you give me uh your pastor's number brother Steve said I wish he was so because he has a good report I don't correct them but if he had a bad report I would correct them quickly say no he's not my pastor you see s success is many fathers but failure is an orphan if you do well everyone wants to be associated with you if I do well even somebody that doesn't know me say I know brother that he's a good friend of mine so that that's what we say about brother Steven somebody said do you know brother Steven oh yeah he's a good very Co close friend of mine and indeed he is shall We Stand and read the the scripture tonight let's read from Psalms chapter 78 verse 40 Psalms I love the Psalms brother Bram would read a Psalm every service because he said the Bible says in hyms Psalms and spiritual songs in Ephesians I believe it is so he would um he would read a Psalm every Serv so let's uh go Psalm 78 verse 40 if you have it you can show by raising your hand if you are in the Old Testament you you are in the right direction how often did they provoke him in the wilderness and grieve him in the desert yeah they turn their back back and tempted God and limited the Holy One of Israel you may have your seat praise be to God Hallelujah the prophet says there's only one sin and that sin is unbelief everything else drinking and smoking is attributes of sin but unbelief is the only sin that the prophet says we can point that this is sin so everything else smoking drinking adultery those are attributes of sin and here the Bible says that they limited the Holy One of Israel praise be to God so tonight for a title we want to talk about rapturing faith overcomes all our limitations rapturing Faith overcomes all our limitations praise be to God just felt led to speak tonight on faith noticing that brother Steven was you know laboring preaching on faith so we decided to write on that solid foundation if you are a um if you are a pilot or if uh you are a sailor you have to understand how winds operate so they are headwinds those that blow towards your face you know towards your your face if you are sailing or if you're flying they slow you down so if if if you know a one hour Journey can be like one hour 30 minutes depending on how bad the tail winds are that's right and you use a lot of fuel that's I mean the head winds but they also Tailwinds those that blow in your direction yes and if you're a good pilot if you're a good sailor you have to learn how to ride in those Tailwinds and they make your journey easy and faster amen so when you find tail Wings you ride on them amen so so so brother Steven laid a very good foundation I said I'm going to ride on these Tailwinds amen we're going to be writing on these Tailwinds that's how the ministry Works Paul says I planted Apollo's water but God causes it to grow praise be to God it's not a onean job it's not a one congregation job it's for the entire body of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and the only one to be glorified at the end of the day is Jesus Christ when the true word is preached only Jesus Christ comes out of it amen glory to God yes sir and a real servant yes my brother knows who he is amen and he knows who he is not amen amen glory to God when they asked John art thou the Christ he says I am not he that's it but who are you I am the voice I'm the voice crying in the wilderness he knew who he was not and he knew who he was yes my brother praise be to God yes sir that's exactly you know when we approach the prophet we know who he is not but we know who he is amen amen it's not enough to know what the who he is not you have to know who he is hallelujah so the Bible says here that they grieved the Holy One and they limited him so the sin that God found with this church that's is that they limited him in other words God wanted to do do the mighty Works God wanted to manifest himself in their midst but they limited him by their unbelief they limited him by their understanding or maybe by their lack of understanding they limited him by their lack of Revelation so he could not fully display his power and because of that he was very with them and the Bible says they troubled him imagine troubling God hallelujah yes the Bible says here it says how of they provoked him in the wilderness and grieved him that's right verse 42 they remembered not his hand that's right nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy right how he had wrought his signs in Egypt and his wonders in the field of of Zan right amen one verse says that they they were asking can God lavish a table in the wilderness and God could read their thoughts that's right praise be to God so when we have Lake of faith we limit God in our life Hallelujah sometimes we limit God because of our background that's right sometimes we limit God because of our denomination our way of looking at things God does not want to be limited God in the beginning was El Elohim he was the self-existing one the word Lord is L in Hebrew which means Lord Yahweh you know but there's another Lord which is Master like when a wife would say my Lord to her husband she's saying Master she's not saying Yahweh she's saying master although in English is the same Lord but he wanted to reveal himself sir he had a desire in the big part of his mind he wanted to reveal himself but in order for him to reveal himself they had to be people for him to reveal himself too so he created things and he created people hallelujah although we know that we existed with him before the foundation of the world right but he desire to show his power he had a desire to show his healing he had a desire to show that he is a God of Peace but his biggest problem Through the Ages that's right is not finding the people to reveiew himself to he's not finding people to show his healing is not finding people to show that he is Jehovah CH pension companies they run programs what they call Unclaimed benefits they have a lot of money where people were working and contributing but they can't find beneficiaries so they have to go through the radios they have to put in in newspapers because they want people to receive their benefits and I believe that's what God has been doing throughout the ages who can I find so that I can display my power who can I find so that I can show my Works who can I find so that I can show myself that I am Jehovah [Applause] [Music] Gyra and each and every person that God worked with there was a level that he could reach to and that was the problem because God would work with Moses up until a certain point where Moses would just be become wroth and he throws away the tablets so God could not do much because he was limited in Moses that's right hallelujah praise be to God so there was a limit to every person that God ever worked with until God said I am going to make myself into flesh and then nobody can limit me I can do whatever I want [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah God Hebrews chapter 4:1 let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest so God gives a promise and he wants to fulfill This Promise verse two it says For unto us was the Gospel preached as as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it because they had no faith the word of God had no effect in their life and they were not able to enter into God's rest because they did not accept the word with faith they were hooked to their Egyptian Creeds and traditions they are hooked to their own denominational ideas of how God should do things that's why they would say to Moses there were carrots in Egypt there was gamore in Egypt there were French fries in Egypt they wanted things the Egyptian way but God but Moses wanted to do things God's own ways and let me tell you something this evening God is not satisfied by any other way that is not his way God only accept his ways God only accepts his choice God will never accept anything that is not his choice sir because if he does that then that means he is no longer Sovereign but for him to be God he has to be an infinite Sovereign and because he's Sovereign he makes his own choice without consulting nobody [Applause] hallelujah praise be to God some of us will think maybe if only God would would have done something this way maybe if only God would have chosen this way if only God could have chosen somebody who is not brother brandham guess what God does what he wants that's the first principle that you have to know about God God does what he [Applause] wants and he does not need means approval he is not a politician because he does not campaign for office he does not campaign for power he exists in his own power and he lives in his own Glory therefore he does not live by means approval or acceptance God is the truth God is right even if everyone else says that is wrong but he is right because he is God amen amen that's why he never changes amen because he is God if he changes then he ceases to be God that's why we do not change the gospel that we preach Hallelujah we preach the same things that Paul preached we preach the same things that brother Bram preached because God does not change God does not subtract he adds his light Moses said thou sht not commit adultery but Jesus Christ said if you look at a woman to last he was adding light so if you see someone leaving the message and they go to drinking it means that that wasn't the Holy Spirit leading them because God does not take light he adds light Genesis 18:3 and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh why did Sarah laugh you see that Spirit limiting the Holy One saying shall I of short bear a child which I am old and God says is anything too hard for the Lord at the time I appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son amen praise be to God so it it it displeased God that Sarah doubted that God was able to do the supernatural in his life and God said why did Sarah laugh you know brother BR when he was on the discernment light line if somebody will begin to doubt he would feel it says I feel it I feel that doubt it would bump against him like that that's how God feels when we doubt his promises but tonight I want to show you by the grace of God that we are entering into the realm of rapturing faith and when we enter into the realm of rapturing Faith all things are possible when we enter in the realm of rapturing faith we are not bound by this camp or that camp or this camp we believe all things are possible [Applause] Hallelujah Hall the devil wants to limit the church they want to limit the church to speaking in tongues only they is speaking in tongues plus as much as the Lord of my God shall reveal Satan wants to limit God to just you know conduct or order that is fine but we don't stop there the devil throughout the ages he knows once I limit the faith that I have bound the Holy Spirit but before we can go in the rapture we must come to a place where we believe that God can do all things and when we say God can do all things it's not a statement out of vanity or you know the way the lud dians would would would say it say all things are possible therefore I'm going to speak 800 rolls-royces no it's govern by the character of God because faith is a revelation of the will of God so you will never ask something that is contrary to the will of God praise be to God so rapturing Faith takes away the limits because remember when Adam fell we were subject to limits that's right we were subject to gravitation our limit that's exactly right amen we were subject to a lot of things and the Bible says that the earnest creature is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God so the restoration of the kingdom it begins with taking away the limits so that we can have the abstract title deed of the book of redemption do you see this church so it starts in the realm of the spirit where we believe that we have Liberty through Jesus [Music] Christ Matthew chapter uh 13 verse uh 58 yes sir the Bible says and he did not he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief in other words when God when Jesus went to capam in a place that he grew up he wanted to do many many mighty works because he was God he loves to display his power but here the Bible saying that he was limited because of the people's unbelief that's right am that's why he said who unto you CH who unto you capam if the mighty works that were done in you were done in Sodom it could have been standing this day amen Luke 18:8 the Bible says I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find a denomination shall he find a camp shall we find a group of people just in a uniform shall we find faith upon the Earth so what Jesus is looking for is Faith and if you look at it Jesus never healed anyone he says your faith has healed you your faith has healed you your faith is what heals you so Jesus cannot operate outside of what your the faith that you have but the problem that we have is that in this generation we have everything except Faith that's why that's why people want to associate in groups because they don't have faith or if I if I I live in Jeffersonville I think I will make it if you have faith you don't need to go to Jeffersonville if you have faith you believe wherever you are that Jesus Christ you are the same [Applause] God hallelujah someone says you know what if I if I can listen if something is revealed to you I understand like something was revealed to the woman if I can touch His Garment that was a revelation for that time but not everyone needs to do that I don't need to go to Jerusalem to see an empty tomb to believe that Jesus Christ raised from the dead if I do that that shows I don't have faith that's exactly right that's why people have a camp that's right because they want something physical that they can hold on to preach my brother preach I have this gun that I got that brother used to hunt with those things are fine but that is not where your your faith should be based on amen amen faith is a revelation amen of what God is amen and what God is doing faith is a revelation amen amen amen glory someone says brother I have got faith says if you have faith then you don't need to be in the prayer line in the first place because if you have faith you believe wherever you are that God can heal you yes my brother Hallelujah yes sir when the son of men comes will he find faith upon the Earth glory to God that's why people spend their money to God places right if only I can see this man of God I believe he can help me Jesus Christ already paid for everything on Calvary amen amen the only thing that you need to do is to accept what he did for you amen on Calvary amen praise be to God Amen but that simple Faith the devil is taking it away from us that's exactly right the prophet says in God keeps his word Along come this new issue the Oneness right they started baptizing in Jesus name that was all right that's in the Bible but what happened you made an issue out of it and where are you tonight on the sidelines too because you didn't hold the torch light you organized and put a period after that and that settled it brother talks a lot about Oneness that's right when God review something yes sir instead of people to put a comma and say God will review much more that's the problem they built a denomination around that that's right and when they built a denomination around that that's it they organized and when they organized they put a limit they put a period right because a period is a full stop they put a period to say God this is what God has done full stop and when they do that the prophet says show me any any group that ever organized and came back again no says when you organize you die right there that's it why because you you put a limit on God that's it and you go back to Psalm chapter 78 they limited the Holy One of Israel that's right amen praise be to God amen so the moment you put a Creed you have limited God that's it Jesus could have the Holy Spirit without measure because he was the word without measure amen amen amen hallelujah amen Jesus Christ believed without measure because he had the faith without measure because he was the word without measure amen amen amen amen that's why the church is in a very poor condition that's exactly because we have joined ourselves with camps that's it with Creeds that's it and dogmas that's it and you know opinions right when we are supposed to believe the whole word of God amen amen yes my brother yes sir preach I'm going to go very slow tonight go ahead my 2 Corinthians chapter 3:1 17 Hallelujah now the spirit now the Lord is that Spirit right and way the spirit of the Lord is is there is Liberty Amen in other words where God's spirit is there is no limit amen amen am amen there is no limit to say we only believe this no where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty if somebody wants to stand up and shout they can stand up and shout if someone wants to say Amen they can say Amen you you are free in the house of God amen amen amen if an evangelist comes you say Amen right if a teacher comes you say amen amen if a preacher comes you say amen amen because the spirit of the Lord brings Liberty that's exactly right but the reason why people die uhhuh is because they say all I want is evangelism God has to speak to me this way only when you do that you will never go anywhere with God that's right because you are putting a limit to what God can do amen maybe God can speak through a teing that's right Hallelujah right we should never put a full stop to what God can do whatever gifts he gives us we say Amen to that Amen to that Amen to that amen amen all of us amen we are going into rapturing Faith yes my brother and rapturing Faith goes above denominations it goes above men's ideas right because the prophet says rapturing faith is in them books and the tapes amen capturing faith is the faith of God amen amen Revelations 4 One the prophet says and that's the same thing every denomination and the Pentecostal denomination is God today right they see those denominations die just as quickly as they denominate right now as an individual you can denominate yourself that's exactly right when you say you know what I'm not going to listen to this that's it you can sit in church and halfway through the sermon you say if the pastor starts talking about this I'm not going to listen to that you denominate yourself there that's it and then you limit the measure of your Holy Spirit in your life because you have denominated yourself there that's it but if you come to church with an open attitude amen and say Lord whatever you say I will say Amen whatever you review I say Amen whatever you say I'll say amen amen amen amen but the devil works over time that's right say once once once he talks about that I'm not going to listen to that I'll just take this I won't listen to that and you denominate yourself right there and that's where exactly you dash and you go into prayer and say Lord I'm looking for a breakthrough you never get a breakthrough until you find where you left Jesus remember it was it was Mary who denied the supernatural birth at the Feast of Pentecost when they were the Feast of Pentecost she said to Jesus Christ your father and as were looking for shoe amen and the prophet says that's when she denied the supernatural birth amen and the prophet says the church they left him at the Feast of Pentecost because Mary is not the Royal seed she is the shark that holds the seed and Pentecost was not the seed Pentecost was the shark that was hacking the seat amen but the seat is the red word of the hour yes my brother yes my brother because the shark is to pull away that's right the shark will dry out and pull away that's right but the seed is is harvested into the Garner yes my brother because remember when Eve was created by God she was called Adam right because she was a part of Adam that's right but after the fall she became Eve right which means a mother of what all living amen that was a Blasphemous name she was supposed to be called Adam that's right but because of the Fall she received a Blasphemous name that's ex and the church she was the church was called Jesus amen and they were baptized in the name of Jesus Amen but at n year R that's right she received the Blasphemous name Hallelujah pre they were called I I wish we were not on live stream the prophet calls them lodes Hallelujah yes sir denominational names that was not the name of the church that's right the name of the church is [Music] Jesus the only has one Church brother and that church is a mystical body that's right glory to God if you see a church that was founded by a man it's not the Church of Jesus Christ that's it how can you find how can you found something that you are born inh how can you found your dear how can you found your your family how can you say I I I'm the found of my family when you were born in that family I mean Common Sense will tell you that you cannot found your family because you were born in that family if you were born in that family it means that you are not the first one you were born of your father so if you are born in the church if you are born in the word you cannot say I'm the founder of that church how can you found it if you were born in that church that's a Blasphemous [Music] name glory to God hallelujah yes so the Church of God is called Mrs Jesus amen amen amen yes sir now Christ is the head is the head of this yes sir Christ is the head of this Messianic Kingdom uhhuh now the word kingdom is two words right it's king and domain kingom so we are born into a kingdom it's not a democracy sir it's a kingdom that's why we don't have power to change what was written that's why we don't have power to change the dress code that's why because it's a kingdom it's not a democracy preach preach because there's a king and he is his domain am and all of us are servants in this Kingdom that's right let me read what brother BR says glory to God and you cannot organize a kingdom of which Christ is the head amen you cannot denominate a kingdom amen which is which Christ is the head because Christ is King amen amen amen hallelujah amen Christ is King Amen brother Braham says many people want Jesus to be their savior that's right but not many people want the want him to be their lord right but Christ wants to be the Lord in your life amen because he is a king amen because a king has to have a domain amen amen amen and the difference between a a kingdom and a democracy is in a democracy it's people who decide that's exactly right people who elect representatives uhuh but in a kingdom the instructions they come from the King yes sir and because they come from a king they are not negotiable no sir because it's a kingdom amen amen So when you say oh we are sitting down as a church we've decided now Brothers can wear shorts that is not a kingdom no no that is your own decision that's right because a kingdom the word comes from the King amen amen amen but one thing I I like about this kingdom is yes sir yes sir we are not servants we are sons in the Kingdom of Goden we are also Kings and reigning with him and he is the king of kings he's the Lord of lords amen but we are also Kings with him amen amen amen amen glory to God I was in the Middle East one time yes sir so they have what they call emirati so there's a king over Dubai there's a king over rasal K there's a king over Abu Dhabi so each one has a a domain but there's a king of United Arab Emirates so that's how the kingdom of God is God will give you your domain you are a king of this domain you a king of that but he is over over all the King of Kings amen amen amen amen amen yes sir so because we are in a kingdom we cannot denominate a kingdom no sir because the king wants to have unlimited preeminence yes my brother now the the word preeminence means God wants to have total control and total Liberty amen amen hallelujah amen because for him to be a king he has to have preeminence yes my brother yes my brother yes sir glory to God but the prophet says people want him to be their savior uhhuh but they don't want him to be L that's the problem they want to tell God what to do uhh they want to tell God where to stop uhh they still want to wear their high heeled shoes 20 in preach my brother preach my brother Hallelujah somebody was saying I thought the service was good now he has started stay right there Hallelujah my brother I wasn't planning on speaking on this I saw an an article in New York Times of all places and they were saying how of all the things we don't understand why women are still wearing heels no they said stilettos I don't know what that is says because they were designed to attract men right that's exactly right it says they were designed for two things one to attract men go ahead two to give confidence to a woman I said if you have the Holy Ghost why would you need Confidence from a shoe preach preach if you have the Holy Spirit you don't need Confidence from a shoe shoes or no shoes I believe God ah hallelujah praise be to God pray and you know what the doctor said they said stilos they destroy women's backbone and brother Braham says motherhood is the backbone of the church so so stilos in a type they destroy the backbone of the church they destroy [Music] motherhood remember that dream in the spoken word that woman wanted to walk in the highway with high heeled shoes and says you cannot walk there with those shoes says oh I can do it after five steps she fell down that's right because the shoes were too high for the highway that's exactly but my sister we are going into rapturing Faith amen amen hallelujah why should you gain confidence from keeping 50 Ines of beard that doesn't make you a man preach my brother preach I'm not saying I'm not saying it's a sin there's nothing wrong with keeping your beard PR but I'm saying you don't need to give to get the fashion to to get Confidence from like you know like a Hamas or a Taliban Warrior you just be a son of God [Applause] God that doesn't make you a man what makes you a man is your knees it's not your beard it's your knees am sister if you're looking for a man don't look at his beard look at his knes preach my brother my don't look at tattoos if you if you have confidence in yourself why should you drw tattoos on your body right anyway let me let me let me let me continue my brother preach faith that was once delivered the prophet say some people want to limit that Faith to a Creed some want to limit to a denomination they so here we only believe in speaking in tongues Hey listen God has many more things to to to review to his church amen am but but I say this upon the authority of God's word there is no limit to the faith of God Amen that he left for his church amen because he said all things are possible to them that believe it's not limited amen amen that's what the prophet says amen he says imagine a mouse right eating the Garners of Egypt sparingly says oh I'm going to finish these Gunners you can never finish those Gunners of Egypt there is no limit to God's power amen amen the only limit that we have is the one that we put upon ourselves that's exactly right a greater than Solomon is here the prophet says brother yes sir if he isn't he is just a bunch of Creeds some people limit God to Creeds uhuh we might not be able to walk where Jesus did to sh to shout Down the Walls of Jericho I might not be able to walk like Enoch did and take a little straw and go over home with him without death but I will never stand in the way of somebody that believes that amen amen amen if somebody believes that God can heal them while they swimming at home say Amen to that amen alone if somebody believes that God can heal them as they sitting in the bench Amen to that Hallelujah there's no limit to what God can do there were four brothers in the Bible four friends yes my brother and these were good friends they had a friend if you know four is the number of redemption and there the fifth one who who has he are sick with the py right he was paralyzed and then they wanted to see Jesus and they went to where Jesus Christ was doing uh question and answers it was probably maybe it was Brother Kelly's house and people were throned people were everywhere it was packed but they had a friend who was crippled and they wanted him to see Jesus that's right you know you know what go ahead my brother friends that take you to Jesus are the best friends friends that take you to church are the best friends yes my brother Hallelujah a friend that will take you to church is the best friend yes my brother preach but a friend if he's always taking you to some other things then that's not a good friend but these four friends they were real good friends they they they packed him they packed him and I'll say something they probably dealt with him for many many years maybe sometimes when they were going in the aerplane they would put him in a wheo chair maybe sometimes they would carry him on the back they were they always had all these problems but you know what they said we're going to find a permanent solution and the permanent solution to our friend is to take him to Jesus and tonight Jesus Christ is the permanent solution the permanent solution is to come to church sometimes we try to witer our problems sometimes we try to pick them around just come to the word just come to the word and say Pastor I don't know what to do here what how how how can I handle this when you come to the word you get a permanent solution so these friends they realize this issue this friend is going to be a constant problem the only thing we need to do is to bring him to Jesus so when they got there in Hunter Brother kill's house it was packed and you know everyone people were sitting outside somewhere in the driveway and ah what can we do they couldn't knock they couldn't you know it was there were ashers there that were controlling the crowd and you know people they couldn't do any nothing this man is crippled they couldn't press their way in they said you know what we're going to take the the roof off someone said Ah that's an expensive roof brother Kelly is not going to be happy if we take her off his roof pre my brother said for the sake of this brother to receive Jesus we going to do it anyhow whatever can help a brother let's do it any and they took the roof off and you know you know the fires that s started ringing there was commotion and they lowered him down and Jesus said I've never seen such Faith this is good faith the faith that takes away the roof the faith that takes away the limit Hallelujah there's no limit to this faith I like this kind of [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Faith it's not a a religious faith I'm going to the prayer line I'm going to watch my step I'm goingon to wear a nice dress because tomorrow I'm going on prayer line no no no no no this was a a rugged Faith going through the ceiling just coming straight to church like the Mexican woman she was holding a dead baby and brother says brother Jack go and pray for him for her she will not recognize us she says I'm not going to stop I'm just going to call through the crowd and the deacons were there they tried to stop it she could not stop brother Roberts was there said no sister you can't do that wait for your turn she says I am going anyhow Hallelujah a dead baby she was holding a dead baby on this hand and she was wrestling the Deon on the other hand Hallelujah and the prophet says Oh Brother ESP know that there's commotion there brother we cannot hold nobody can hold we have tried everyone in church nobody can hold it not even brother Roberts can hold it but she had to get to Jesus and the Holy Ghost saw that says I like this kind of Faith there is no limit to this faith brother BR who said wait a minute my brother there's something that is happening you are seeing a vision Hallelujah you are seeing a baby smiling Hallelujah says bring the woman here she has touched the high priest Hallelujah do you believe tonight that Jesus Christ is the same today today and forever if you still want to be a gentleman then you haven't started God wants you to be desperate Hallelujah when you are really really ready for it you become [Applause] desperate before the before the deacons open the church you are already outside you are calling the deacons can you please open the church I want to go in and pray that's the kind of faith that Jesus Christ is looking for not what we have in these last days somebody miss church for 3 weeks oh the the Pastor said something that I didn't like so I'm not going to church I'm going to punish the [Applause] pastor unbelief does not hinder God it destroys the unbeliever Imagine sleeping we used to do it when we were kids oh mama mama beat me today I'm not going to eat and you go to bed starving you'll be shivering with hunger in bed because of immaturity hallelujah oh come on church just say mama I know you love me Mama I'm hungry then Mama go feed you glory be to God let us go and to Perfection let us go on to [Applause] maturity amen that's what we used to do when we were kids if if my my older brother would make a mistake or maybe it'd go in the blankets without taking a shower I make sure when Mom is passing out would flip the so that she can see that she the brother is wrong immaturity oh Pastor how did you handle that case I want to understand why what does that have to do with you if he shall T until I [Music] come Hallelujah the the prophet one time he went to Cincinnati Zoo I was over I was in Indiana God bless you friends thank youall I was in Indiana recently so it's next to Cincinnati so he took his family Brothers It's good to take your family out once in a while and the sisters [Applause] [Applause] say I can show you many quotes where brother Branham was out with his family he was in Mount rashar with his family he was here he was at C not with his family don't just go don't just go with Brothers alone take your family with you don't be a self-existing [Applause] one Hallelujah dwell with your [Applause] family Hallelujah I know the sisters will buy me lunch after this [Applause] service so the prophet was in Cincinnati Zoo and he says I saw the most pitiful sight in all the world it was a egole which was caged a a Heavenly bird that was limited in faith don't go to Gastonia don't visit this place the spirit of jeroboam God God ripped 10 he took he gave him 10 kingdoms 10 Kings and he says listen I've given you 10 you'll be happy said oh if people will go up to Jerusalem and sacrifice oh maybe they they'll join that church of ram of Solomon so you know what I'm I'm going to have my own Camp then he built altars that's exactly right says Ah don't go to Jerusalem you can worship here don't go to question and answers just just just hang around let's we can have barbecue here we can sacrifice here hallelujah catched eagles they live in a in a cage you know something about birds that live in a cage they make a a lot of noise and they have a lot of food because they are caged Hallelujah I am going to chalk it cat the E cat the birds they make a lot of noise that's why many people who are depressed they are very prolific on social media that's science that's not me that's science Hallelujah anyway let me let's continue while this group down right here has got 2,000 years at the river you FR is the prophet says that the church bound the holy ghost at at Euphrates for 2,000 years by creating dogmas that's the Feast of trumpets but it says but now the holy ghost that teaching rain the Mur is coming to remove all the Creeds that the Holy Ghost may be released in the church you can never have a genuine Holy Spirit without a genuine word because the holy spirit is the spirit of the [Applause] [Music] word how can you have con toas without corn Hallelujah because it comes from from from corn right the holy spirit is the word in spirit form so the prophet says the evidence of the Holy Ghost is believing the word because you cannot deny the word the prophet says Christ cannot deny his own word he cannot deny himself so when you Che the word out you are taking the Holy Spirit out of the church because the Holy Spirit feeds upon the word and one of the signs that one I said one of the signs that somebody is has the spirit of God they feed upon the word there's no way how can you there's no way because the Holy Spirit feeds upon the word so if you want to see whether you have the Holy Spirit see what you're feeding on look at your diet that tells you who you are Hallelujah theol Spirit does not feed on someone says Netflix it's not me someone says Netflix from the from the back there I don't know what that is but they saying the Holy Ghost does not feed on that someone said HBO what is that the Holy Spirit does not feed on that am amen oh someone said Hulu the Holy Spirit does not fit on Hulu it fits on the [Applause] word I'm just repeating what the people are [Applause] saying hallelujah you know I don't know if I told you I was in the hospital with my wife when we were a baby so before they every 4 hours they coming they saying we checking the viral said what is viral I'm from Africa

Hallelujah if you are reading your Bible that's a good viral if you are praying that's a a good vital if you are listening to the tapes that's a good vital that's a sign that you are [Applause] leaving if you go into a home you can just see the vital signs that the dve is fled from this house the love has left this house because all the viral signs will be down there is no language like honey love honey punch there's no sweetness everybody's always [Music] busy everybody's always wrong I'm the only one who is [Music] [Applause] Right fishing from the sea of forgetfulness and put it in the microwave [Applause] I mean we have archaeologists they dig up the [Applause] fores in 1993 on 6 December at 5:00 p.m. you promised me ice cream and you didn't buy it but you will never remember one quote that was preached on [Applause] Sunday you see how the devil is using your [Applause] memory [Applause] Hallelujah remember the good things that was done to you remember the good things that he did for you and thank God for the good things say h honey I love you for what you did for me honey I love you for what you did for me that's what Christ does for the [Music] church the Bible says that a merry heart it makes you know it makes this the soul feel good you know thank God for the good things you see it's like in America it's the richest country right the largest economy they say but the people are miserable because they're not grateful for what they have they're always cursing the government oh we want this we want that but we when we come from Africa we say oh my oh my oh that's that's a good burger wow oh this pizza is really good Oho oh my chipotle sauce is really nice oh oh we are having a good time but the America the Americans are complaining oh if the government could do this be grateful for what the good things that are coming in your life count your blessings name them one by one when you go home tonight tell your husband the best things that you like about him tell your wife the best things that you like about [Applause] her Hallelujah we are talking about rapturing faith I don't like faith that is only in church I like faith that operates everywhere at at home at school ah come on Church the spoken word is not for this church only when you are at home the spoken word still works when you are at school the spoken word works when you a to work the spoken word works we are not Catholics who do their religion on Sunday in a cathedral we do our religion every [Applause] day that's why we don't wear uniforms because our robe is the Rob of righteousness Hallelujah you know back home we have churches that wear uniform so when when when they want to fight I'm going to take off my uniform I'm coming back but a Christian never takes their uniform you have it all the time Hallelujah no matter what happens you remain a Christian [Music] hallelujah oh my and when you are in Christ Jesus by the baptism of the Holy Ghost every gift of God belongs in the church amen amen we don't want one gift in the church where you have one brother just preaching all the meetings there's only one man who had the worldwide Ministry that was brother Bram all of us we compliment one another we want all the gifts in the B now notice again now that's his threefold purpose yes sir to restore back Eden bring back which was lost that was the only thing out of order all the rest of the things was in order so the prophet says that Jesus Christ wants to rest restore back Faith uh hidden condition again I have to rush here because I've got many slides and I'm going to close pretty soon the prophet says says in in perfect faith and so when a man lives by faith right and he walks by faith I mean substance Faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ amen amen then now you are getting into bright Bri material I mean I could preach two hours on bright material says bright material not not Pentecostal material but bright material see see you are getting into rapturing condition now for the Rapture to take place there has to be a condition the church has to be in a certain condition right for a woman to give birth she has to be in a certain condition that's exactly right and the Rapture can never happen unless we come into Rapture condition and the prophet says it's it's when we live by faith until we walk unconscious of it in the book of Acts when they were praying for for Peter somebody knocked on the door and they said maybe it's his angel they were unconscious of it they it it was normal for them to say I think maybe it's an angel today if you say it people think you are you're going nuts why because we have lost the the faith that was once delivered to the Saints but the prophet is saying we walk by faith unconsciously until it becomes a condition you are just in a rapture you are just walking until anytime you can just disappear anytime you can just disappear that's the condition that Elijah was in that's why the kept on the Centurion he said Lord he said Elijah if we if I go to the king you may disappear I Mayan not find you again because we know your condition you can just appear and disappear you can just you say Phillip could be walking and disappears and starts witnessing to an Ethiopian unic and he reappears again in Samaria and it was unconscious it was not a headline oh Believers Believers portal oh this happened this this brother oh he disappeared no it was just unconscious stepen says I see Christ standing on the right hand of God I see Angels it becomes unconscious for someone to say brother Aaron I was praying yesterday I the Lord showed me a vision about this this oh we say let's pray that's we want to thank God you know it's it becomes simple and unconscious that's it but it's breaking news oh last month someone spoke in tongues friends we are not yet there we are not yet there we have to come to a Rapture [Applause] condition and he says in B and that's the condition I think the church will be just in before the coming of the Lord so the Rapture will just go right on amen amen that's what the church needs to be a regular routine of following the scripture and the plans of godall Enoch was just doing his Daily Business Like The Prophet can I have five minutes he he was not in church when the fish was created it was just a a routine and ordinary life it was a condition that they were in am and Banks woods and liar we said well how about we go and tell that joas woman jeah sness woman lady you know we we received you know conversion she was good to us and the prophet says that pleased the Holy Spirit and because of that when they were fishing says little fish I give you your life in the name of Jesus Amen it was a Rapture condition that's the time was not right but the condition was good that's it was not in a prayer line it was Brothers fishing it was not in church it was Brothers fishing somewhere in Gastonia it was brother Bram in Colorado he was not in Tucson he was not in Jeffersonville he was in the mountains hunting it was brother Bram in the woods hunting for squirrels that cost less than $10 if you combine the cost of six squirel to today it would cost you less than $10 but he was going about his daily life he was in the forest he says I I started to see myself becoming young and I saw my my wife before me from the time when we got married it was a condition that he was getting into and I want to say this friends as I'm as I'm closing the Rapture is a condition the Rapture is a process and that process means that we have to come to our place it's not a condition where you are being forced to come to church you are being forced to pay your tith that is not the condition of the Rapture Israel has recognized the place she said we are going to defend ourself even if we have to stand alone it we will stand defending our promise our land it she Israel is in the condition to receive Moses and Elijah and the church has to be in the condition Hallelujah to receive Jesus Christ in the clouds it's not a a fighting and fasting Condition it's not fighting over Doctrine if if somebody wants to believe something say that's all right my brother somebody somebody said to me you know Aon I wanted to tell you I'm leaving the message I said brother if you found something better out there God bless you my brother you remain a Christian as for me I'll just stay with the message that's the best that I know amen we are not a c it's up to you if you find if you found a light that is higher than this God bless your heart my brother as for me I'm going to stay with this light it's a Rapture [Applause] condition Hallelujah friends rapturing faith it overcomes all limitations the prophet says that if a plane goes past the sound barrier is unlimited what it can do and it says if the church could only go past the sin barrier past the denominational barrier past the Creed barrier past the flesh barrier it's unlimited brother Bram says he says Albert Einstein he says if only he would apply what he was studying to the spirit he says if you can get in contact with something you can have unlimited energy it says if only he could apply it in the spirit that if we could surrender ourself and get hold of something then we would tap into the unlimited the realm of the unlimited where all things are possible where Paul say the angel yes sir whose I am stood with me t night that's right and he says no one is going to perish it only remain in the boat it that was a condition my brother my sister they were not arguing about what is the best barbecue in in in in Charlotte they were in a certain condition I am falling short of that condition and I want God to help me to come to that place to come to that place where even even when you are praying for food on the table they such an atmosphere you can almost want to crash there is such a holy spirit atmosphere one time someone got converted by seeing brother Bram walking that's right the the condition can be so good when he was in deran South Africa Hallelujah people were weeping from 20 miles away because of the atmosphere that was there and he says brother brother Roy borders and brother assment they don't know why they were weeping it's because he was meeting with me up there they could be such an condition and atmosphere in the church that even before a sermon is preached the young people receive the Holy Spirit I believe that tonight with all of my heart that God can do itth he can do it for you he can do it for you he can do it for this church we can stand upon our feet [Applause] friends I want to be in that condition the condition of the Rapture I want to walk in that path amen H Hallelujah somebody say in the footsteps of Elohim I want to be in that condition you know there were people that were sent to arrest Jesus when they came to arrest him they could not hold him that's exactly right the Bible says they came back and they said why didn't you arrest him says never a man SP like this man there was an atmosphere around him that they could not get hold of him there's a scripture where they were taking stones to Stone Jesus but the Bible says he went through their midest they could not Stone him that's right because there was a certain atmosphere the prophet says sometimes I I can forget my knife at home and I just believe and I see it in my pocket it's a condition my brother bless you Church brother Sten amen amen amen amen amen wonderful praise be to the name of the Lord let's give the Lord again a big clap offer amen amen you can see clearly how the holy SP spirit is working and you know who spoke to you you know what you're doing you know what you know that I don't know and God through the discernment of the word has ambushed you and told you where the problem is amen this is not game this is the word doing its own job amen am amen remember I told you if you don't know and the preacher don't know you and he doesn't leave with you and he come on this pulpit and he say something that you know exactly that you are doing you don't need any more Vision because that's the highest form that God can speak to you in other word God is talking to you directly he you don't have to stand and here that save the Lord that's our Pentecostal understanding God is talking to you directly about your life about your home about the immaturity and God want you to be in the place where he predestinated you to be God want you to reach that place amen I keep repeating almost every Sunday I say we are Ruth is resting there is a condition that rof need to be before she can be United with boas you now going to get in this Rapture just playing games amen God is coming to pick up something that look like him amen we have Calvinism in this message that have taken the grace of God overboard where people continue to do what they're doing and they say oh we will all make it by grace we will go to Heaven by Grace oh brother oh Grace it's only Grace who will make us there no one is worthy to be you are fooling yourself amen Grace send the word Grace send the Savior Grace open the seals when the Capstone is coming he says Grace so everything even brother brandham came to us by Grace it is the grace of God that sent Elijah the prophet so I don't know which Grace you are talking about right Grace is God coming tonight and speaking to you God could have left you to continue what you're doing and get in trouble but his grace he's sending someone because if it's me sometime you might say he knows my condition or maybe because I did something that's why he's saying that now it's not brother Steven it is somebody who's coming from samels who's speaking things directly and I know what he's talking about amen amen church God wants you to reach that higher level on Sunday we gave you the quote brother brandham say that it would take a perfect Faith to run the perfect word perfectly amen this message need a perfect Faith amen so that the message can be fully efficient in our life if not we're using the wrong pipe and we just getting ready to bust because what we have doesn't match the level of what God sent us but the good news in you God already predestinated you that pipe is there it's just clogged amen we just need to remove things away from God we need to take everything and put them behind God we need to take God and give him the preeminence and give him the first place so that whatever we do is secondary and let the things of God be first until if they tell you we need to read the Bible or we have to visit somebody you will tell that person I will see you later I need to read my Bible but what we do when we have to visit somebody we will take the Bible and push it aside and we will spend our time and what the devil will do he will hold you in that conversation five 6 7 hours until you leave there you knocked out and you don't even have a chance to read that Bible and sometime you get in the conversation that you were not even supposed to get into it you're talking about this one you're talking about this one and things that doesn't even help you amen amen check your father son check where you are with God when they bring the things of God where are you at what is your interest what is your heart Desiring when they talk about let's go to church when when they talk about let's go to a meeting when they talk about let's go to question and answer when they talk about let's pray when they talk about read your cood book read your Bible read your uh Church ages where are you at is he water dropping on the duck back where we speak and he just entered this ear and goes there and it doesn't affect you you don't care well he's going to repeat the same thing okay read the 70s here read read this read is or is something in you pricking you like I might not be able to read the church ages but while I'm working let me put on and turn on a tape and listen to a sermon or maybe while I'm sitting here and I don't have sleep instead of playing on the computer on my phone let me turn on to a message and listen to it or let me sit down and read one one or two pages and I bet you if you read one page then tomorrow you read the second before you know it you will see something kicking many times we want to pray we don't feel like praying and it's usually the devil and as soon as you make a decision you say I'm going to sit and start praying before you know it you will feel like whatever the tiredness or or the fatigue or whatever was attacking you is over and you break through because that's the way things are if you don't start somewhere amen you're going to find yourself in trouble friends amen we live living our daily life but our daily life is seasoned it's mixed with our faith amen when we working we're thinking about the Lord am when we we cooking we are thinking about the Lord before we sleep we are meditating on the Lord that's how King nabuchadnezzar had a dream the Bible say he was thinking he was meditating about the future and God came and give him a dream what do you meditate on Amen what what do we need to push you amen Billy Paul dying doesn't do anything to you coid didn't change your desire toward God uh Israel over there didn't change your desire what else do you want God to do amen you waiting for California now because Billy Paul now is off the scene so maybe you are still waiting for California to go down and that's when you're going to wake up let me tell you something if what is happening in Israel is not waking you up if Billy Paul going home is not waking you up if everything that is happening in this world is not waking you up I'm doubting if California goes down if you're going to wake up because you already created a habit you are immune to the things of God you are no longer sensitive to what God is doing you are more prone to meeting to Fellowship to meet people at the restaurant 10 hours 7 hours talking and you find and until the conscience look like our conscience is sealed what happened God doesn't want you in that God wants you to be in the condition of the Rapture God is coming the Rapture is coming Jesus is coming God wants you to be in the condition that when he comes you won't be caught off guard if he find you cooking you ready to go because you are in the condition if you were taking a shower you ready to go because you are in the condition if you driving the car he he comes there you go from there because you are in the condition if you in school he was going to pick you in school if you at work he's going to pick you there if you're sleeping he's going to pick you wherever you are even if you in the grave like Billy Paul when he call Billy Paul will answer because he went in the condition amen Church wake up wake up God want you to ride in a higher plane let's pray Heavenly Father Lord once again we approach you again humbly father tonight thanking you for your grace thanking you for your love thanking you for your mercy and for speaking to us in a powerful way tonight [Music] Lord father what else can we say when we see everything that is happening all around us Lord the world is falling apart the people of the world are completely insane father they can shoot their people like deer and father we leaving our home and we come back in our home we are even forgetting to say thank you when other people left their home and r in the middle of the highway they were shot like deer and that was the end of it they didn't know that was their last day they didn't know they're not going to wake up anymore they didn't know that was the end of it some were caught in the middle of a party dancing and they were killed right there and Lord we became so insens itive until we see these things and we waiting for the next breaking news to continue to entertain this world while you preparing your bread father I pray that you stir again the mind and the conscience of the children so that Lord father each one will meditate in their lives and spend some quality time with you to examine ourself to see where we are what are we doing in this message are we pleasing Our Father are we pleasing our friend are we pleasing our families or are we waiting for an opportunity to get out but Lord may you give a deep Revelation may you stir up the mind of the people so that we can come to ourself like the prodigal son and realize that the state that we got into it is pretty bad we don't want to be found Lord father eating the swans food but Lord May tonight be a sermon that can stop somebody and turn him around to see that the direction he's going is not good that the condition that he is in is not not an adequate condition for the Rapture so that we can amend our life Lord and make sure that we are in the Faith Lord may you strengthen brother Aeron may you bless him and bless the church Lord and father give us travel Mercy as we go into our respective place and may our heart continue to beat together with your spirit so that we can stay consecrated and if you ter father we
