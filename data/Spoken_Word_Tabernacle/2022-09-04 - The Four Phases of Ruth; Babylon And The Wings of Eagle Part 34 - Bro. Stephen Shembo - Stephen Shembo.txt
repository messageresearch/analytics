restoring her kidneys after 12 years [Applause] amen amen [Applause] we were we were um preparing to pray back there and and he goes you know we kind of talked to god and and asked him um that she would have a very difficult time trying to raise a baby on dialysis so he's fixing her kidneys so we know what's next amen [Music] we're gonna have an addition to the church amen let's keep praying i have always been crazy about this couple and i don't i don't know why but i feel like they're very special amen i call him my chief musician so he is just so good so good amen so also i don't recall how long ago it was um sister kayla had asked um for the church to pray for healing for one of her co-workers of mrs pam and uh there was uh brain tumor issues well she went back to the doctor on thursday and came back clear they couldn't find anything so god is so good amen praise the lord amen so let's see i want to also praise god for some birthdays uh i believe sister olga's was this past week amen amen praise the lord i believe sister destinies was yesterday was it yesterday or yeah amen praise the lord and i i don't know exactly which day but if you all remember brother sebastian from the other church he is also having a birthday he's 80. so we want to praise the lord for that he is a precious brother amen praise the lord so i have a couple of prayer requests the first one is for a sister susie in texas she's suffering pretty bad with some covid and it's affecting her health pretty pretty bad so we they're friends of um brother i'm seth so we want to remember her and and and i guess everybody there because it's you need help when you're bad like that so and also um sister kayla says her co-workers dad his name is dean he has had heart surgery and now the doctors are saying that he is in kidney failure so let's remember mr dean there as well amen i'm going to ask brother sam to come up if he doesn't mind i'll leave these here if he likes to lay hands on the prayers when they're coming up let's remember each other please amen every day three times a day remember three times a day thank you my brother god bless you let's pray lord jesus is with grateful hearts that we come to this building to assemble ourselves together with one mind lord one heart one accord leaving all the cures of the world outside the doors we've come lord to gather in your presence father which lord we know that's beyond the inner veil when you're in your presence were in the shekinah glory right by the ark of mercy lord god lord and we see the high priest sprinkling the blood upon the mercy seat and lord we're just reminded lord god of how that you placed our sin into the sea of forgetfulness and so we come into your courts with thanksgiving into your gates with praise father and lord god we're so thankful lord for the report of our dear sister costs and we just look lord jesus forward to the day we're a complete delivering where she's holding a baby in her arms father we believe the vision lord god our hearts are with brothers seth lord god and our precious sister and lord jesus christ we're so grateful for the grace that they bestow on this church lord and we pray lord jesus christ that you'll minister to these uh precious sisters lord that has the uh the covet out in texas and that whole group of people lord god because covet can be very vicious and we just pray lord god that you'll continue to bless our lord god and bless all the the congregation out there and also remembering this co-worker dean father lord jesus there's nothing too hard for our god lord jesus we're still holding up teresa's cousin in prayer sandy as she battles so many afflictions in the flesh but praying also and remembering your soul lord and father every soul here would have an unspoken request that they're praying about lord i've got lost children lord and i see the coming so near and it weighs so heavy in my heart i remember the prophet when he was ministering souls and in prison now and he said i pray that i'm wrong i pray that this isn't so he said i've got lost children but lord now here we are 50 some years of advance from that lord god and i've got children lord that aren't in the way and i know you don't have grandchildren father but lord jesus i know there's nothing nothing too hard for our god and lord jesus if he was able to have abraham to believe that if he was the take of his life all his son's own life because of the promise he knew that you'd be able to raise him from the dead and lord god we stand here tonight and today this afternoon with the faith of abraham and we're believing your promises and as our father abraham against hope he believed in hope and so lord we hold the vision of all of our children saved sanctified filled with the holy ghost lord jesus christ and lord god allow our lives to so shine before them that they'll see our good works and glorify our father which is in heaven and lord we're so thankful for this congregation and the praise that's offered up to you we pray it's acceptable to you bless the remainder of the service the specials the songs and the offering lord god may be given

well thank you very much edition what a singing word is shouting amen i wonder what will be like in heaven when we get there amen glory to god we greet you all in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ everybody happy today tomorrow is labor day i already know about it amen so relax there is no rushing and no children going to school tomorrow no washing dishes no cooking whatever it is amen tomorrow is labor day we relax everybody happy how many are up to date with the sermon let me see your hand you cannot keep having your hand down every day amen glory to god how many are reading the cod book and the church ages i run across the 70 weeks and i can't touch them because you have not gotten there yet if i go on there some of you will be completely lost so you need to hurry up with your reading and start catching up quickly so whenever it's ready you dig into the 70 weeks you soak the information then when i come in we are soaring like eagles amen remember one question a day one question a day so by the end of the month you should have 30 questions you will see what it's going to do to you you wonder where i know what i know because i'm reading brother branham amen we're not like catholic where we have a different books i have the same bible you have we have the same author of the bible and we have the same message and everybody is he is free to go search dig and find out what the lord is saying amen glory be to the name of the lord now this is a hard one how many read daniel 2 and daniel 7 praise be the name of the lord whoever didn't do it i'm sorry but i'm not responsible for you if you get lost i am not coming back again to keep reading the scripture because you are slowing us down amen i will continue to move you're going to catch a home and go home and read it amen amen i gave you the message earlier i don't know what time it was just read two chapters because i know what it is if you know the background of the story it makes me it makes everything easier to move on but when i say do you know this you don't even know what i'm talking about so it's even hard for me to go i want you to be grounded in the scripture that's one of the biggest errors that was done in the message people were grounded in the quote and didn't know the scripture that's pretty bad amen the quote that recording came from the scripture amen so you need to know the scripture and then back it up with the quote then the message is clear for you amen our question and answer will be on september the 24th lord's willing the children day that we need to talk to them and pray will be october 1st lord's willing and uh brother david asked me if we can make a group uh like a what's-up group for the entire church where we can drop in the the announcement because some of them got flyers and stuff like that which is hard to send through a text but he's going to turn the comment off so nobody say thank you thank you thank you and we have a hundred thank you coming up and nobody can sleep and and somebody cannot sleep at night so we're gonna turn the comment off completely and he will try to work if the um if he can put a link where you have your question and answer you can go click on the link and put your question and answer or if we need a head count or something like that are you okay with that or not i told him i want to get a feel from the church amen so let me see your hand if you okay okay i have almost a majority here brother david so you got a green light we can go ahead and start it on amen remember you got your comment send it on the side we're gonna turn it off amen it is strictly for announcement we don't want any video being posted there about what you seen on tick tock don't post it there even if it's good it's a good quote don't post it there go to the youth group chat and all the chats that we have there you can post today amen amen okay before somebody else put something on tick tock i thought it's gonna inspire somebody so don't put it this is just for announcement everybody okay that's the easiest way to go with it so let's go to our scripture this morning you need to have your bible you need to have your bible and you need to really stay alert everybody okay let me ask you this again how many look at the seals i told you to review the seals and i gave you even the link you reviewed them if you did in review it is on your own responsibility except if you know it everybody okay trust me i would never face crust with your blood in my hand amen sometimes i ask people i say is everything okay they say it's okay and i know it's not okay and when you're telling me you're okay i pull back and i push the break and i'm waiting for you till the day you're gonna tell me it's not okay because i can't force my savior only knock at the door if you open then he can get in if you do not open i will just close so when i ask you is everything okay you don't know what i saw some of your trouble i already seen them a long time ago i'm just quiet and waiting because i'm dealing with a hard wall of pride where it's difficult for somebody to acknowledge when they're wrong i have to push i have to push i have to push i have to push and i have to sit until you open up then i will tell you i say in months so and so two years ago the lord already showed me that this is your problem this is what you need to do but i'm dealing with a lot of shelter you know what a shelter is do you know what a shelter is do you know when jesus was talking to the woman anywhere she began to discuss about religion how can you discuss religion you approach it anybody okay if she knew that the messiah you the jew we samaritan we worship if you knew all of that why you didn't change your life [Music] everybody okay if you already know about the messiah your life should not be the way you're living that's exactly a lot of message believers [Music] when you talk to them they will impress you the sales this this this and then we were in the convention and stuff you just keep watching them but your life is not nothing reflecting nothing of the message of the hour you're not reflecting the message you are completely like a man on the street the way you're treating your family the way you're treating your wife the way you're treating people completely doesn't even reflect the message at all but if i come right straight you pull the wall to show me that you have been in the message 20 years i will push my break and just keep waiting when you drop down then i'll pick you up and say i already knew this five years ago let's go to daniel chapter two i hope somebody got my message don't try to solve your problem yourself solve your problem according to the world according to the message of the hour that's why sometimes you are send me a question and you see i'm lingering because i want to see the mind of god on your question and then suddenly you will see a quote coming up like a whirlwind and exactly what the person asked me for and then i pulled the code and i gave it to you in other words i'm telling you this is the prescription that god gave us through the messenger for you to overcome this as simple as it looks like take it swallow it everything will be okay the problem is many of us are like neyman [Music] can i say it can i say it many of us are like naiman when you tell them what to do you already have a preconceived pentecostal idea [Music] everybody okay if i tell you go fast two weeks you're gonna do it because that's what you want that's what pentecostal usually do when they got a problem they run too fast who told you too fast who told you to do it my body said amen there who told you to faster you go fasting when the lord told you who told you to go pray five times a day who told you to do it amen it is as simple as believing this is the victory that overcome of the world which is our that simple faith that's why when the disciple came they say lord increase our faith do you know what god say he said if you have a faith like what in other words they were looking at big faith now i got a big faith now mountain move jesus said say you don't understand that small faith that you see there can move that big mountain that you see there your biggest problem that you see there can be removed by a small little faith like this can can can deliver you easily but the problem is when we tell you go down to jordan 7 time no because td jakes told you joel austin told you whoever pentecostal you are listening towards you you need to go in a mountain you're going to find a snake there who send you to the mountain you're not a prophet brother brother even himself the lord told him he said you are not the prophet like the old one you need to be a prophet in suit in sheep clothing [Music] let's go to daniel chapter 31 chapter 2 uh verse 31 thank you you will keep spinning spinning spinning wasting your time and one of this day you will regret all the time that you are spinning wasting you have a problem no oh i'm okay okay continue to be okay i'm going to sleep when the when your boss asked me i say i asked him i asked her she told me she's okay 31 sometimes i wonder if you know what a pastor means he's still young i don't know where that one comes from he's still too young he need more experience wait 31 you are king so if you read this at home you find now you are king so and behold a great image you might be seated stay alert please you feel like you're sleeping you just wake up there you stand there so maybe you work at night to understand it but don't let me say sleepy here okay all right you o king soul and behold a great image everybody should know be acquainted with this image amen this great image this is very it's a little bit deep so let me go slowly so i don't lose you okay we don't have pressure this great image or this gay great statue or adult whatever you wanted this great image whose brightness was excellent amen stood before you and the form thereof was terrible you ready this image head was a fine gold so the head of this image is made of gold you're going to wonder how we're going to move this and go through the serpent see then come up everybody okay so that's why i say stay alert this image head was of fine gold its breast and its arm of silver so the breast and the arm are silver amen and it's barely and its ties are of breath the belly and the tie are of brass so we got one two three there amen and it's leg of iron the legs there's two of them are of iron how many arms do we have we okay okay karma it's feet part of it water and part of it how many feet do we have part water and what it's feet what do we need the feet you start getting it you start getting it where was sleep roof sleeping is it okay now is that blending if you are lost you just do this okay lost the feet we talk about the feet the roof sleeping on the feet of boas when we talk about revelation 10 when the engine came down he had feet like pillars of fire everybody okay now okay blessed be the name of the lord verse 34 you saw it till that a stone so right here we have one we have two we have three we have four we have five so this image is not really four like the people put it it's five hey buddy okay okay you saw it till that stone was cut out without water it doesn't have nothing to do with human if a stone is cut with hand it's a human effort amen there is no human input here anybody okay it's cut without hand which smote the image upon its water so that stone never targeted the head that was the stone of david the stone of david have to go straight to the head of goliath but not this one this one doesn't target the breast of the arm it doesn't target the belly all the time it doesn't target the leg it targets only the feet what does he do when he targets the feet when he hit the feet what happened to the image in other words the the the strength of this image because goliath they hit him one shot and they drop him down but this image also have a specific spot that if you hit it you don't have to worry about any other spot but that's part of his defeat do you see why i need helm everybody okay and he hit the feet that were in iron and clay and broke them to water then a cascade begin like they're taking a building in downtown and pulling that down have you seen that before it's like boom and then you see the building going down then was the iron the clay the brass the silver the gold broken to water how can you hit something at the feet everybody okay and it's breaking everything in pieces we can go even get a brass we have an eagle there outside there okay go take a stone and hit that ego if you will see that ego coming up in pieces so it's a different stone amen it is not your stone on the outside here everybody okay and that stone have to hit only one target and the whole image no matter the material [Music] it doesn't matter the strength of the material it's bringing everything down in pieces everybody okay and became that stone and and those pieces became like the shaft do you know what the shaft is the shack the seeds shall not air with the shack another word for the shark is the shaft [Music] so these pieces become like so there will be something be reacting like a shack when this stone is hitting right here like the chef of the summer water where are we at where are we going we okay so we we're here we are dealing with the shack on the water anybody okay you need to have your bible please i know what i'm talking about everybody okay and the wind carried them away the wind means something that no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great water you know when we say mountain we're talking about this the mountain doesn't look like this you're talking about this so the stone has is growing up [Music] we okay okay everybody okay he became like a great mountain and filled water you remember the lever and and the brazen altar one was square and the other one was a circle one represented the globe and the other one have the four corners this mountain is filling the earth which is round but the mountain is filling on them in the middle of it did you get it or did i lose you did i lose you we okay so the earth which is like around like a ball is filled with a mountain so we got a pyramid in the middle of a circle you see now so when a struck a move into the pyramid with a circle we okay blessed be the name of the lord oh my god 36 this is the dream and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king this is the interpretation your king are a king of kings who is that king nebuchadnezzar he is a king of kings but we know the king of kings why is this one also king of kings and this is daniel the prophet telling nebuchadnezzar you're the king of kings okay he say for the god of heaven has given you a kingdom power and strength and glory and wherever the children of men dwell the beast of the field and the file of the heaven has he given into your hand and has made you ruler over them all you are the head of water so the head of god is the babylonian kingdom everybody here the babylonian kingdom under king nebuchadnezzar we okay now verse 39 and after you shall rise another kingdom inferior so the strength is everybody okay so as you move from here the strength is getting water so if the strength is decreasing everybody okay as we're moving down which one is the weakest point [Music] we okay okay another inferior to you and another third kingdom of brass which shall be rule which shall bear rule over the earth and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron anybody okay for as much as i on breaking pieces and subdue all the things strange now this iron here can break all of this anybody okay but if you strike it when it's mixed with clay it breaks everything what a paradox anybody okay the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron for as much as iron breaks in pieces and subdue all things and as iron that breaks all these shall he break in pieces and bruise and whereas you saw the feet and water i'm not going to get into those details part of porter's clay and part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but they shall be in it even though it's divided they shall be in it of the strength of the iron for as much as you saw the iron mixed with merry claim and as the toe of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly water and whereas you sow iron mixed with merry clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of man human alliances but they shall not cleave one to another hypocritical friendship full of it in a message iron and clay everybody okay even as iron is not mixed with water everybody okay so far verse 44 and in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but he shall break in pieces so that stone is a kingdom that stone itself it's a kingdom amen anybody okay he shall break in pieces and consume all this kingdom and it shall stand forever for as much as you saw the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that he broke in pieces that stone came out of a mountain and it became a mountain [Music] the stone was in a mountain they removed it from a mountain but the stone itself is a mountain [Music] we okay everybody okay this is a mountain anybody okay when you cut this stone right here this stone will come out of a mountain but when the stone come out of a mountain it is also a mountain this is the mountain everybody okay but when you cut this mountain there is a stone that come out but that stone itself is also a mountain did you get what i'm saying this is a pyramid when you cut the stone the stone that came out is also a pyramid we okay now praise god verse 45 for as much as you saw the stone was cut out of a mountain without hand and that he broke in pieces the eye on the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great god has made known to the king the word shall come to pass hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sure everybody okay let's go to daniel chapter seven this is daniel chapter 2. can i have another one thank you if you dare you can say amen praise god verse one listen very carefully daniel chapter two this is daniel chapter seven the bible says in the first year of belt saser king of babylon thank you man it is still the king of babylon everybody okay daniel had a dream but it's not nebuchadnezzar anymore we okay daniel had a dream and vision upon his head upon and vision of his head upon his bed everybody okay then he wrote the dream and told the son of the mother in other words he summarized it daniel spoke and said i saw in my vision by night and behold the four winds of heaven strove upon the water so we see here i have to go this way because this is very deep we see here that there is a sea everybody okay and this sea of course is filled with water anybody care and for some reason four winds everybody okay come the wind what is the wind everybody okay the four winds come and trouble they see in other words the water that was peaceful is now trouble completely and when the water is agitated and troubled something begins to happen what is happening are we okay what is happening let's pray so i can soar heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning father thanking you for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father once again we are approaching you in all humility recognizing and knowing that we are human being very limited lord father on our ability and depending on the great and mighty and powerful god whose name is the lord jesus christ father may you move us completely out of the way may you come lord father and speak to us in a powerful way father remove every demonic spirit that always trouble the people making them sleepy or trying to cause something that will move the people from the sanctuary or stay away from the service father i pray in the name of jesus christ that you bring your mighty powerful hand of deliverance and break this yoke of the devil away from your children and give them freedom and liberty and may the spirit of revelation enlighten their soul lord as we commit everything unto the hand sealing the devil completely out in jesus precious name amen verse three and four beasts came up from the sea diverse one from another in other words the beast never came but after the water was troubled by the wind anybody care so the traveling of the water by the wind calls four beats to come and every beast is different from another one that's what the scriptures say all right verse five well verse four the first beast you're following me the first beast the bible says that the first beast was like a lion the first beast is like a lion everybody okay and had the eagle's wings this lion has eagle's wings everybody okay how many wings does this ego have everybody okay now when he came out daniel said i beheld till the wings thereof were plucked so at the beginning this creature everybody okay this beast is a lion with egoings everybody okay at the beginning it is a lion mixed with the eagle's wings ever here but as he progressed everybody here the wings of the ego will be removed we okay now this beast will turn into a simple lion are we okay verse uh to four i beheld till the wings thereof were plugged and it was lifted up from the water so when they removed the wings of the ego everybody care something happened to this lion this lion who was uh a four-footed beast stood up are you following me so he stood now after the wings are removed everybody okay so as long as the wings are there [Music] everybody the lion on cameras we okay let me continue and he was lift up from the earth and made stand upon the feet as a water so this lion stood like a man what are you trying to say i'm saying what the bible says everybody okay karma and the water was water when he stood like a man he received a heart of a man in other words he received a human heart everybody here so at the beginning he was just a beast anybody here with a heart of a beast are we okay right here it is a heart of a beast anybody care but as he progresses everybody care this beast will be given a human heart what does it mean to be given a human heart in other words he will move from being just a beast it's going to incarnate [Music] amen [Music] we okay that incarnation will never happen only after the wings are taken off any questions job two verse five you already got a message everybody okay verse five and behold another water beast we're dealing with beast beast beast you see that terminology another beast a second number two like a water like a bear and he raised up itself on one side and he had three water the second one is like a bear and he has water a rib a rib a rib a rib you know whatever it is huh you know what a ribbit you know what they did with the rib at the beginning are you okay now let's continue okay they have three ribs in the mouth and in between the teeth of him and they said that study to it they told the beast eras devour water so it's a destroying beast it's a beast that i have been given power to kill everybody okay everybody okay how many reviewed the seals do you see why it was important to review the seals now you some of you are lost i'm not responsible buddy anybody okay job two verse six after disability and lo another like a water like a leopard i cannot move quickly the way you want me to the one like a leopard which head upon the back of it how many water of water we don't know what that foul is it is just four wings of water we don't know what that foul is but we know the first one is pure it's an ego everybody okay fouls and the beast head also what four heads fourth of a foul and he also have four heads amen four heads and dominion was given to it after this i saw in the night vision and behold the uh fourth beast number four everybody okay and four beasts uh four b the fourth beast dreadful and water it looks like water what does it look like it is dreadful and terrible what has dreadful and terrible means here i have an idea it's a lion here it's a bear i know what a bear is here it's a leopard i know what a leopard mean this one dreadful terrible what is dreadful terrible to you it might be something like this to somebody else is something like this to somebody else it's a dinosaur to somebody else it's uh it's aware to somebody else is a tiger i don't know what dreadful and whatever it is so let's just say what the bible say everybody clear so this beast we don't know question man how we know dreadful terrible that's what the scripture says let's stick with the scripture anybody okay he ain't strong exceedingly and he had water great water i have a little description i have iron teeth so is it a dinosaur with iron teeth is it a tiger with iron teeth is it an elephant with iron teeth we don't know you okay and he devoured and broke in water and stamped the residue with water remember in the dream of naboo kanezo the first kingdom was like what he breaks everything amen you remember and this one is a beast that have eye on teeth which breaks everything we okay now okay and he was diverse in other words he was different from all the beasts nothing looked like it amen that was before it and he had water ten horns so if you ask the first beast brother stephen i say lie on the eagles wing the second bear the third leopard the fourth we don't know how we look like all that we know is iron teeth and ten horn period that's it everybody okay job to verse 16. [Music] the double says i come near to one of them that stood by and i asked him the truth of all this so he told me and made me know the interpretation of the thing so daniel went to the one that was showing him the vision and he said let me ask you a question what is all of this and the angel explained to daniel everybody okay verse 17 these great beasts which are four are for water so at the first they are kings if you stuck here you'll be in trouble everybody okay they are kings everybody okay we know nebuchadnezzar was also a king we know darius was a king if you read josh bababo you know what i'm saying by the riots in the book of daniel these great beasts which are four or four kings which shall erase out of the water so the rising from the sea is the rising from the earth we okay now but the rise only after the war there are trouble we okay verse 18 but the scent of the most high shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever even forever and water now it is not the most high god but it's the scent of the most high or when we were dealing with the image of nebuchadnezzar it was a stone but here it is a people everybody okay over here it is a stone but over there it is a people everybody okay verse uh 19 then i will know the truth of the fall beast which was diverse from all the other exceeding dreadful who's thief where of iron and his nail of water another description the nail are of water you see how you need to read your bible everybody okay daniella's brass which the devourer pieces stamped the residue with its feet and of the ten horns that were uh in his head and of uh the other which came up and before whom three fell even of the horn that had eyes and a mouth that spoke very great things whose look was more start than his fellow everybody okay daniel says i understand what you displayed to me and the explanation about the three beasts but i have a question mr angel tell me more about this fourth beast here i want to know more about it everybody okay daniel was more interested to know about the last beast anybody okay according to the first interpretation every animal is a water a king job to verse 23. so i can run quickly does he say the fourth beast shall be the fourth water so not only are they kings but they are water that's why you need to be very careful when you're listening to brother brother upon the earth which shall be diverse from our kingdom and shall devour the whole earth and shall throw it down and break breaking pieces everybody okay and the ten horns out of this kingdom are 10 watts everybody okay now so we begin to understand here that when they give the explanation to daniel they don't tell him really how the beast look like they just tell him this is another kingdom that's all remember in daniel 12 they locked the thunder from daniel because daniel wanted to know the tandem they say it doesn't belong to you leave it alone just keep moving your way everybody okay so so far we don't know this beast how we look like all we know we have iron teeth ten horns and nails this is a kingdom a kingdom a kingdom a kingdom a king a king a king a king everybody okay let's go to revelation 18 then we move on lord help me if you dare you can say amen verse 1 and after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying babylon i thought babylon was already destroyed [Music] i thought babylon already fell by the middle pigeon what is babylon doing at the end huh what is babylon doing at the end babylon is falling the great babylon the great is fallen is fallen and become the habitation of water so when you go in babylon you are entering the habitation of devils if today you go to the place that is babylon and you enter there you are entering yourself in a territory of devils you need to be very careful with your friendship my friend invited me to the church my friend invited me to the church oh i have to go to my friend's birthday [Music] and the hold of every water fowl spirit and a cage of every water and hateful water [Applause] [Music] you see what what a place hatred for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her water so this baby don't have a wine that everybody's drinking from it this is not your one at the abc anybody here and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchant of the earth are works which through the abundance of her delicacies there is a lot here going on and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of here so she is a woman babylon is a woman amen come out of her my people that should be not partaker of her water so sin is in her and that you receive not her water plague job to verse seven how much she has glorify herself she's a woman and live deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she said in her heart a seat a what she's a queen and i'm no water and shall see no water jump to verse 16 and saying alas alas the great city that was clothed with water if you watch verse 16 this city of babylon is close we find lennon i want you to stay close with me clove we find learning come on everybody okay and then purple [Music] and then water and then water gold right purple scarlet and deck with gold and with water precious stone and pearl right here we can preach till the end of the year [Music] everybody okay everybody okay now remember brother branham say scripture does not play with water whatever is in the record it's there for the anointed us to do what it's there forever so there is nothing in the bible that is there for game amen amen my subject this morning is the four faces of roof babylon and the wings of ego everybody okay babylon and the wings of ego stay alert we're gonna travel differently now everybody okay we are still in the trashing floor you found it right there amen with roof and we also dealing with the parable of the 10th virgin where we are emphasizing on the second oil and we stared at last sunday that's the reason why we went through the trail of the serpent because the trail of the serpent is the beginning of sin because eve unlocked the nature that was locked by god eve opened the door to sin eve opened the door to the corner nature brother branham says this he says there is god's seed under innocence in the garden of eden not knowing all at all that they were naked and the reveal of the water there them from water so sin was already there in the garden of eden because sin originated from heaven you remember and sin came down on the earth but both of them were there from sin so the corner act of eve open the door to the sin into the world [Music] everybody okay so far when we go into our tabernacle language we are very very very deep now into the holiest everybody okay we found out that the tabernacle have three steps justification in the other court sanctification in the holy and then the baptism of the holy spirit which is in the holiest everybody okay according to ezekiel under justification you receive a new heart under sanctification you receive a new spirit and under the baptism of the holy spirit you receive the spirit of god open with me first john chapter 5 hallelujah glory to god if you dare you can say amen first john chapter 5 verse 6 pages are still turning if you dare you can say amen the bible say this is he that came by water the first element here is water everybody okay karma or not by water and by water the second element is blood i promise to you one day that i will get to this even who jesus christ not by water only but by water and water in other words both of them are important anybody care you cannot have water and stop right there everybody care jesus himself have to go by water and the blood but do we stop there let's continue and it is the water are we okay it is the water so the third element is water everybody okay so right now we have the water we have the blood and we have the water and the bible said that jesus came by water but not water only but he also came by water but not only blood only but we know in the river of jordan what happened to him the spirit of god got into him in other words there are three steps [Applause] [Music] up here and there are three compartments in the tabernacle everybody okay so far i'm blending saint john before we take off anybody okay because the spirit is truth and it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth verse seven for there are how many there be a record where so we have heaven glory to god and we have also earth in heaven how many do we have so we have one we have two and we have three we need to know them the bible says they are three double record in heaven the who the father and the second one is who the word in the beginning was the and the word was with and the word was it's the son the only begotten of the father the father give birth to his son emmanuel everybody okay the word kama and the water and the holy ghost you trinitarian in the message churches listen to your scripture for they are pruitt they bear record in heaven number one the father number two the word number three the holy ghost and these three are water everybody okay not on the earth in heaven that's why he said feel it when you see me you see man because me and my father we are any question praise be the name of the lord all these three are water so when you talk about the father you talk about the holy ghost when you talk about the holy ghost you're talking about the word when you're talking about the word you talking about the father that's why in the beginning was the and the word was with and the word was how can people be in trinity with a bible written like this what else do you want let's continue verse eight and there are three double witness in water so in the earth we have three one two and three everybody okay glory to god the water and the water and the water so we have the water we have the blood and we have the water not in heaven on the earth everybody okay and these three three are green in water they are not one everybody okay in heaven these three are one but in the earth they are not one they agree in one everybody okay everybody okay yes sir but the john brother is married to sister eddie brother john paul and sister eddie are won okay brother john paul is a friend to brother mickey but brother john porter and brother mickey are not one they agree [Music] anybody okay they only agree as brother in christ in one we okay william marion branham we know that the blood the bible says in hebrew 12 that word for jesus also that he must sanctify the people with his water so the blood speaks of sanctification everybody okay when you go back in the tabernacle you will find out that under justification we have water baptism everybody okay and in the whole yes we have water the spirit of god anybody okay brother branham says this he says that first john 5 7 there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word which is the son and the holy ghost these three are they are three that bear record enough the water the blood and the spirit and these three agree in water you cannot have the father without the son you cannot have the holy ghost without having both the father and the son but you can be justified without being and you can be sanctified without receiving water they are green in water but father son and holy ghost are water you can be in one court other court justified by faith believing you can be in another court clean up from the life of sin and sanctify but you can miss the baptism of the holy ghost baby in other words if you have the father you don't have to worry about the sun the sun is already new the holy ghost is already on new if you get the word you don't have to worry about the father ever here but on the earth it's a problem you can have the water don't stop there you need to keep moving because if you don't move you cannot have this automatically [Music] this one is a combo but here this is a combo when you say sandwich everything is in it everybody here everybody here over here you got bread you got tomato you got your chicken everything together but over here you are still at walmart the chicken is over there the bread is over there the mayonnaise is over there they buy the milk is over there they owe me a green one but they are not one yet any question my friend glory to god [Music] brother branham says this he says there are three double record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost these three are water and there are three different record on earth that's the water the blood the spirit and they are green water the first three are one the second three are earthly which are green in water you cannot have the father without the sun you cannot have the sun without the having the water but you can have the water without the blood and the blood without the water through our edges has proved this to be true water blood spirit water and water and water which take away from the water so that you can be born again everybody okay so far everybody okay so far why did you bring this in the tabernacle why we're still awake in the 10-hour uh parable of the foolish virgin and the wise virgin in verse 3r6 the bible says that at midnight which we know what it means there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh going out to the water the cry presented the oncoming bridegroom anybody here did the christ say anything else about the blood groom he only spoke about water the bright groom is coming did the cry say go take a shower did the christ say trim your lamp did the christ say wake up [Music] everybody the cry only spoke about the bridegroom everybody care and i don't want the cry is a person it's a bright group in other words they cry speak of christ which is our broad group everybody here but when they cry came out everybody here and hit the virgin you okay they cry unlock a sequence of events everybody here when the virgin heard that the bridegroom cometh everybody okay they didn't turn around and say you know what the bridegroom is coming everybody here when they heard the message about here they repeated the message in another language but here the message was no longer a shout out but it becomes an action in your life [Music] can i continue can i continue the bible says after they did they come they said go here to meet him what happened to the virgin they did water [Music] number one they did water cannot continue come out number two they did water do you know what trimming means cleaning up sanctification sanctification ever here they trim the lamp which means they were water sanctification ever here and the third one was what they need to search if they have there everybody okay so they shout when he hit the virgin they shout toward them everybody here that you need to wake up everybody here but if you look at the shout he only said the bridegroom cometh but the bridegroom cometh when he enter in the ear of a virgin it means that i got a world cup not only do i need to wake up i gotta clean up and not only do i need to clean up i gotta watch if i have the second one [Music] yes sir here everybody okay erasing doesn't guarantee you to meet the bridegroom can i continue because five virgins arose the bible cannot continue the bible say how many drug generals how many virgins arose how many virgins keep them how many had the holy ghost not all of them we okay so you can arrows it's not a guarantee anybody okay you can trim your lamp it's not a guarantee you can arrows it is not a guarantee you can trim your lamp it is not a guarantee they only agree in one but they are not one but here they're only a green one you can arrows you're not a guarantee to go in the rupture can create sanctified united guaranteed to go in the rupture the absolute guarantee is water [Music] everybody here when you have the oil he automatically means that you were justified that you were sanctified that's why god see you with the holy ghost did i lose somebody that's why it's very important don't stop where you are you need to make sure you got the second one the message came to produce the order brother branham we okay what about them said they are three that bear record in heaven in earth the word of the blood and water there are three different record in heaven the father the son and the holy ghost these three are water but the other one they are not one but they agree as water you can't have the father without having the son you can't have the sun without having the father's sun and water because they are what they are what inseparable but you can be justified without being water you arose but you have not cleaned your lamp yet and you can be sanctified without water in other words you can trim your lamp but you don't have the second oil yet can you check that prison oh my god i don't know where i am amen you can be sanctified but you don't have the water you can be clean live a pure life and have a form of godliness and denying the power of healing and speaking in tongues and great friends of god and every one of them in there there is your water who had water in the water what did they have everybody okay so the five words virgin have rapture in faith and the rapture in faith was in the second oil everybody okay believing all water and water and water and water and these five cut out of the remnant was water be careful where you are you don't need me to tell you where you are in the tabernacle you already know where you are you go yourself walk in the tabernacle and you check if you have the holy ghost or not if you are under the water remember you need to get the blood if you under the blood you need to go all the way to the spirit in other words if you arrows don't stop there make sure you have trim your lamp if you trim your lamp you must make sure you have the second oil because with that the second oil there is absolutely no way you can get into the rupture everybody okay so far let me change gear and remind you this brother branham said all this code and our process and all these things and ism today by god's grace every one of them written in water where he has its water but there it's just got water remember it's just another name in other words it's just another manifestation but it's the same thing but you watch the working of the spirit in that day and watch how it's working today you shall see it's water so don't get caught up with name don't get caught up with the phone watch the working of the spirit in it in our scripture reading this morning glory to god we found that in the book of daniel we okay that we have two separate uh chapter there we have daniel chapter two on the one side and we have daniel chapter seven on the other side when we talk about daniel under on daniel chapter 2 we found out that the kingdom were divided into five the first one is the babylonian over there the second one is the middle persian that's why it's two armor the middle and the persian we okay that's why it's two armed everybody here and the third one is the greece until we got the rome and the other one everybody okay now we found out that on daniel chapter 7 something happened first to the sea the sea was calm and the sea was was filled with water and suddenly there arose uh uh four wins that came in and daniel 7 and daniel 2 are just the same thing in another form everybody okay everybody okay so far pharaoh saw a dream he saw a dream which were represented with seven years of of corn and then he saw a second dream which was seven what cow both of those dreams were just one drink they were saying the same thing but they were using two different form the first one was using the wheat everybody here and the second one uses a beast everybody here so the wheat plant and the beast goes together everybody here because remember jesus said that he was the corn of wheat and jesus said except the corn of which fall into the ground and abide alone and jesus have to fall down and when he was erected he came back on the day of pentecost as a wit and the width begin to go to moving the loot the castle and the blade and pentecost the shark and the water one is picking off the church edges and one is picking off the water the seals relax i'm gonna get there brother branham says this he said like in daniel when he saw a certain nation a certain nation rise up it will be maybe a bear holding a ring you know what it means now in his side in symbol then he see another power raise up a goat he represents something then he sees another power raise up and he was a leopard with so many heads you represent a certain water now you understand why brother branham said that then he saw another one rise up a great lion with water and stomped the residue that represented different power all together one was a kingdom of nebuchadnezzar and another type of a dream daniel saw a vision you okay nebuchadnezzar dream a dream but daniel interpreted his dream and was correctly with what what are you trying to say amen nebuchadnezzar saw the vision of the kingdom of the gentile in the natural aspect everybody here according to the dream of nebuchadnezzar they when daniel came in daniel told him that you know what everything you saw is four kings it's four kingdoms amen you are babylon they will come another kingdom after you then they will come another kingdom after you so politically speaking god gave the king the natural aspect of what happened in the world everybody okay but when god talked to his prophet amen he doesn't give the prophet only the natural aspect god gave the prophet the spirit behind every kingdom everybody here in other words daniel saw the spiritual aspect of the vision or the anointing amen behind the nation because everybody got a spirit and every mission brother branham say have a spirit but here if you see something moving a certain way there is a spirit behind it if you see putin acting the way he's acting it is not really putin there is a spirit behind putin that is making him behave the way he behave and there is a spirit behind by then that meant by them behave a certain way every nation has a spirit what you see in the natural sense is putin is attacking ukraine that's naturally but spiritually it means something else naturally what do you see is a kingdom like gold a kingdom like silver a kingdom like iron but what is gold meaning spiritually speaking that god is a lion that silver is a bear but here the brass is a leopard so the power that is moving in the kingdom is a different power spiritually speaking what are you trying to say we found out that this tree the sea filled with water got four wings that came in and the four winds began to blow i know somebody will laugh ever here i said the young kid i mean the children will be looking at that and then and everybody who was sleeping was like wake up everybody okay so the four weeks begin to blow what is a wind brother branham says this he said the four winds in the bible means water and water like in jobs time you remember winds came down and took the sun you know what it means it means water so when they say in the scripture that the four winds are hitting the sea in other words it's spirit following me that are bringing wall and trouble when you see putin attacking it's a wind that is growing that's a bible prophetic language in a natural language it is war in the spiritual language it's a window because it's disturbing the water are we okay do you follow me glory to god brother branham say now the angel was standing on the four corners of the earth holding the water what as winds means in the bible any new bible interpreter here wings means water and water and water brother branham gave one scripture here a bad job do we have another scripture if you remember when ezekiel was brought to the valley of the valley of of the dry bones every bones were scattered we know the story god came and said son of man which had this born lives he said you know it god said prophesy when he prophesied the bond came together that was it god said prophesied the second time then he prophesied then the sinew came up nothing they were still dead then god said professor when he professor the flesh came up but they were still dead they were no life god said now you need to prophesy for the life where is the life coming from stay alert the bible says this in ezekiel 37 then he said unto me prophesy unto the water are we okay i'm going slowly you need to stay alert okay prophesy unto the water if you want to give life to somebody why do you prophesy about the wind and we know the witch means war strife or what so the life of these people were taken off by a wall [Music] let's go slowly we okay tomorrow is labor day let me also label okay this is the labor of the lord let me label okay okay thank you the bible says that prophesy son of man say to you singular does say the lord god come from the water we sin in daniel that the four winds travel the water everybody okay and we found out that the lives of these people were hidden by the four winds the bible says four weeks do what and breathe upon the water the slain means they were water they were killed underwater the weeds blew war everybody okay and the wall came and killed the people and the wind carried there everybody okay that's why god said hey hey i know where the lives are go talk to the four wings tell the four wings to bring them back [Music] everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay that's why you hear when war happened people are dying the winds are picking up people [Music] you need a prophet buddy you need this message everybody okay he says that breathe upon the slender the man what so i prophesied as he commanded me and brief and breath came unto into them and they lived and stood up upon the water in exceeding water it was an army that went to war and died everybody okay so the four winds shooting on the water it is the war that is troubling the water what is the water let's pick up until my friend can pick it up everybody okay in revelation 17 the bible says he says unto me the water which that source where the horse is there are water and water and water and water so when the four winds are blowing here they are bringing wall among the people everybody okay so when you see king nabukanesa invading going through war and taking this country and taking this country and taking this country in spiritually speaking it is the wind that are blowing and they are disturbing the people when you see putin taking ukraine it is a wind that is blowing i have your putting right here in the scripture but i can't touch him today unless your boss tell me to say it i can trust him right here in the scripture everybody okay everybody okay so far so what i'm trying to say is this power ever here a rose by the wall between the nation the conquest ever here begin to rise a power so one king will rise and for some reason he will attack his neighbor and take the country and attack this neighbor and take the ca until he become king of king he's dominating everybody his power arose by the troubling of the world everybody okay so far blessed be the name of the lord everybody okay so far god gracious the devil the devil amen now when we look at this over here we found out that it takes war to bring a kingdom ever here and the second one that came came by world to take babylon i'm going to show you that in a scripture and the other one that came came by word to take another one it is always war that brings the succession because the wind are blowing right there it is power that always come by wall [Music] everybody okay did i lose somebody where are you going my brother when we look at daniel 7 the first beast we know look like a lion with a wings like an eagle the second it's a bear with three ribs on his mouth the third is the grecian empire and the alexander the great you need the coach you see me he got the fouls this fourth one is the roman empire which is the eastern roman and the western roman i'm not gonna go in detail because i won't get what i'm trying to get amen but the problem is when we look we don't know how it looks like this one is an iron this one is a bear this one is a looper this one looked like what daniel could not open that up we want to know how does he look let's go to revelation chapter 13 [Music] i'm trying to rush my friend open revelation 30. [Music] this message is so good this message is so wonderful this message is so yummy and juicy [Music] it tastes very good [Music] it's the capstone it's the love of god who can separate me from the love of god from the message of the hour [Music] you think it's me translating the scripture it's not me the boss is there not me it is the boss i'm only telling you what he tells me it's christ revelation chapter 13 you there we want to see how does this beast look because remember daniel wanted to know the time that they say it doesn't belong to you they turn they out for the water end time you go to sleep so the vision of daniel have some missing end some known clarity revelation chapter 13 verse one remember this beast have what iron teeth and water and the nail has water let's go to first one and i stood upon the sand of the sea and i saw a water remember the is the beast the beast at the beginning and the beast at the end give me time as we're chasing that the beast rise up out of the water stop these beasts here were rising up from water from water and this one is coming up from water everybody okay now let's see this beast coming up from the sea having water and stop here this beast came from the sea amen and he has how many horns now john begin to zoom in and begin to be precise and feeling delusion [Music] because john have the revelation of the seven pandas in other words john begin to tell us more clearly that it's not only ten horns he also have seven heads we okay seven heads and ten horns and upon these horns water he added again he said it's not just horn like that these horns are connected to tenkron lord have mercy everybody okay and upon his head the water the man must blasphemy let me leave it there because it's another sermon i'm trying to stay on top job two verse two and the beast we just saw so according to first one john and daniel are almost the same except that dania give us a little bit more detail but john we want clarity this is the end time anybody clear verse two and the beast which i saw was like a water everybody okay everybody okay now this look like water [Music] i thought the lord was here let's continue he looks like a leopard camera and his feet at the feet of the water do you see a bear here so it's a leopard plus a bear can i continue can i continue that's why the stone that comes from the mountain doesn't have to go to the level he doesn't have to go to the bed [Music] come on come on back here come on back here come on back here i'm sorry buddy i'm just enjoying myself i don't have i don't have hobbies where i go to enjoy i don't go to the night club let me enjoy in church [Music] [Applause] in other words leave me alone leave me alone i'm enjoying myself leave me alone [Music] not all the time you're wasting time leave me alone when somebody is enjoying in the night club they don't tell him he's wasting time all right so let me also wasting mother and enjoy myself anybody okay ah let me also eat delicious just like the dance over there i can also dance here so leave me alone okay everybody okay and his manifest the mouth of water do you see the lion there so it's a combination of leopard and water and water everybody okay his mouth like the mouth of a lion let me stop there i'm gonna come back later so we found out that this beast now john give us a clarity [Music] that this beast is not just terrible an amazing beast he have details the detail is it's a leopard and he has pot like bear and he hair part like lion but this beast have nothing to have the ego [Music] are we okay are we okay are we okay in other words the fourth beast is a mixture of the forerunners of the predecessors but here that's why when the stone come [Music] the stone wanna destroy the whole image but if you target the lion the bear will [Music] [Applause] will run away they don't have to wait until they all put themselves together [Applause] but here another word god putting the devil in sandwich putting everything together and then he hit one time the egyptian that you see today you shall never see them anymore [Applause] how great is our god he knows what he's doing my friend [Music] everybody okay so far my god so now we understand that this peace look like that [Music] everybody okay now in other words this beast is beast number one plus number two plus number three equal number four [Music] everybody okay but there is something brother branham says here he said daniel you that the marking down daniel 7. daniel saw the same vision 800 years before this saw the vision he saw those beasts now one from water in the water of the gentile ruling and here they are john seeing it at the end of the gentile ruling all water represented in what the message perfectly in line with the bible [Music] the same old water demon that possessed each water of the roman came through the water and so forth on down through the gentle dispensation has come right down and all met up in water so when you hit that one beast [Music] you are consuming everything because babylon have become the cage of all unclean spirits all unclean blood hateful all of them are burned all up in one place remember revelation 18 you remember revelation 18 glory to god he says who is he all those leopard lion all the dragon how many knows the dragon is the dragon represent who let's stay there let's continue first ever here now if you look at the particularity of the first beast we okay we found out that the first beast having an ego's wing anybody care and at the beginning he have an ego wings with a heart of a beast but later on the wings of the ego were removed when he was removed ever here then the beast stood like a man and he became human everybody okay and we know that the beginning of this kingdom the bible says that daniel told king nebuchadnezzar that king nebuchadnezzar the head of god was you so nebuchadnezzar was the head of gold and the power behind nebuchadnezzar ever here was a lion with an eagle wings everybody here but there is something strange about nebuchadnezzar let's look at the scripture the bible says in jeremiah 27 and now have i given all this land into the hand of who nebuchadnezzar the king of who my wife [Music] if i said brother branham said then you would say where is the scripture i give you the scripture so now can that's how i was true let me continue anybody okay can i add something nebuchadnezzar work with daniel [Music] he works with a prophet his kingdom was a kingdom that was connected with a prophet [Music] when nebuchadnezzar had trouble they said god come meet that daniel that daniel that came from the land of judah dania come here this is my dream and daniel will look and say this is what it means this is what it means this is what he meant and he finished he turned around he goes back daniel was employee in the government of nebuchadnezzar if you don't know that raise your hand it is written in your bible when they give them a test because they stuck straight with the message of the hour god gave them wisdom above everybody and when they went to the test the eog of the state they have so many points higher point compared to all the children it is written in your bible and they give them big position in the government it was a government that was controlled by godly people [Music] glory to god this is why you need to read your bible [Music] can i continue god says this he said and the beast of the field ever give him also to the water and all nations shall serve him come on and serve water come on and serve water so nebuchadnezzar got three kings in him are we okay are we okay with nebuchadnezzar you must [Music] i was about to tell you yesterday that make sure you eat good and you sleep well i was about to send the text because i knew what was coming everybody here so don't come here i'm hungry quickly eat good eat fufu in the morning everybody okay everybody okay all right nebuchadnezzar himself nabukuneza then his son then his grandson anybody here how many kings do we have after him then come the medal fusion everybody here then come the greek with alexander then come the roman anybody care so we got three four five uh three four five and six and down the road you're gonna see a seven on the feet everybody okay everybody okay did i lose you okay he says that you shall serve him serve his son serve his son's son until the very time of this land come and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him and it shall come to pass this is god speaking that the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of babylon that nice that nation will not punish [Music] say who with the water and with the water and with the water until i have to consume them by water you don't obey nebuchadnezzar i'll kill you let me continue the bible says in ii chronicle 36 and them that had escaped from the sword carry he away to whom where they were servant to him nebuchadnezzar and to his water it's plural because its son and grandson until the rain off the water in other words nebuchadnezzar will go from here his son his grandson and after that the king them the what bear comes and pulls the kingdom and there is a reason why you have to be a bear to destroy babylon i'm gonna drop a little seed but i won't touch it even if you pull okay what is the emblem of russia stop there let me go back here let me let me let me go back that's enough that's enough right stop pushing the brake push the brake leave it alone leave it alone leave it alone okay leave it alone who destroyed babylon the first time who do you think would destroy babylon this message this message this message is the truth [Applause] this message is that safe the lord [Applause] [Music] why did not why did russia pick up the bed see when brother branham said prince you don't understand please keep quiet please keep quiet be humble be humble say god i don't understand but i believe your prophet [Music] how can you explain a virgin circumcision [Music] how can a virgin have a baby glory to god my god i am not even where i'm going [Music] you okay glory to god he said jesus he said to fulfill the word of the lord by demand for fool until the land has enjoyed water the problem is with the sabbath of the land remember we are deep in the holiest we are very deep in the holy spirit god prolly israel give the land 70 seven years let the land have a sabbath they didn't listen he said no problem i have a servant nebuchadnezzar pick them up seven years give us all the land the land because the earth also is groaning for the manifestation go to roman 8 for as long as she lay desolate the land she keep water to fulfill water three score is called means 20 years please call means 60. please score 60 and 10 means water so we found out that the reign of nebuchadnezzar will be followed by the water the middle persian everybody okay so nebuchadnezzar according to the prophecy according to the vision is an ironer everybody okay and that lion have ego wings everybody here and as long as the ego wins a day can i continue the lion remain lying they lie as long as the eagle wings are there the lion cannot play [Music] the lion is blocked do you remember caneza one time he was up he tried to be a big shot do you remember god sent daniel and put a whooping on nebuchadnezzar and guess what he made nebuchadnezzar go in the field and eat grass like an ox until nebuchadnezzar came back and said i recognize you to be the king of heaven you the god of heaven because the eagle which was there he was maintaining the lion [Music] but there will come a time when the ego wins will be when he spread out to them delight on them can i continue open daniel chapter 5 [Music] my god sorry my friend sorry my friend this is a uh uh uh an airplane for fight so what i'm doing in the air i'm going like this it's a flight airplane do you know how he comes and goes and goes up this way and flip like this that's a flight airplane the devil is trouble now because i'm flipping this way [Music] you don't know how many attack i'm receiving throughout the week because of this [Music] do you know how you don't know how much i'm fighting through the week because of this now i'm sleeping [Music] if you look this way i'll do this let's go to daniel chapter five glory to god glory to god oh my god [Music] daniel chapter 5 if you dare you can say amen [Music] you're there somebody's already getting it somebody's already getting it somebody's already looking at verse one belthazar okay let me clarify the first king was who then he will be followed by water and the third one will be water and the third one that's where the middle will kill and the middle came to kill under belthazar so there must be a king missing between the two because there is two kings do you remember he must be the son of nebuchadnezzar and the grandson of damn mechanism it said the grandson that the mission that the fusion uh the middle president will come and kill and they killed beltaza so there must be a king missing keep your finger right here keep your finger right here go to second king oh god help me the time [Music] go to second king chapter 25 second king chapter 25 if you dare you can say amen king chapter 25 verse 27 it is the last chapter of second king 25 it's the last chapter of second king verse 27. if you there you can say amen and he came to pass in the seventh and thirtieth years of captivity of the captivity of jehoiakim king of judah remember daniel came from judah in the 12th month on the 7th and 12th 20th day of the mount that who evil merodak king of water in the year that he begin to do water did lift up the head of jehoiachin king of judah out of water so after nabuchadnezzar the one that followed him was evil merudick and the one that followed evil merodak was beltaza everybody okay now let's go to daniel 5. so we clear that up we cannot leave any shadow now no more game everybody okay it's a message of precision [Music] that's why brother branham when he gives the discernment precision it's no more game he's gone get the trouble brother i'm saying my gun have to be shooting booze he said god created you like that so that he doesn't play a game with even compromising i mean a small edge he must be all the time bullseye because it's a message of perfection bertasa the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lord and he did what remember in revelation uh 18 they drank wine of the fornication the wine of babylon have a problem let's see what the one is going to do to beltaza when he drug one before the thousand watch verse two beltaza while he did what not when he eat the meat but the wine it's the one of babylon when he tasted the wine he commanded to bring the golden and silver vessel which his father water when they say father doesn't mean he was born from him because when god met jacob he said your father abraham abraham was not the direct father of jacob okay he was a grandfather so you need to understand that language just to lock those questions yes okay the vessel of your father nebuchadnezzar has taken out of the temple which was in water so there was something about this wine that as soon as the one got there it directed this man to go play with the staff of god what was in this wine everybody here which in jerusalem that the king and these princes his wife and his what concubine might drink there in the holy vessels of god when somebody get inside they kill him then they brought the golden vessel that were taken out of the temple of the house of god which was in jerusalem and the king and his princes his wife and his conqueror drunk in them they drank wine and did water the god of water enough water enough water enough what do you see those elements do you see those elements do you see those elements you see those pieces and of water and of water so they took the sphinx of god and profaned them where is daniel where is daniel because nebuchadnezzar didn't do this this one did it but where is the prophet now judgment comes but here a hand come you can read it at home and write men and men they take her who fears him everybody look they don't know what it means they begin to tremble judgment come everybody here they call the magician the astrologer what does many many take a move first it means nobody knows what to chase anybody okay job two verse ten now the queen the mother the queen was not dead in that crazy thing the queen by reason of the word of the king and the lord in other words people begin to go outside my god something is happening the king is trouble and the mother listen and say what is going on the mother went where they were having party in their clubhouse everybody okay they found their club and they would start playing and having party no that was they played the the worldly club okay they have a nightclub in the palace everybody here and they quit by the reason of the word of the king and his lord came into the banquet house and the queen spoke and said o king live forever let not your thought be trouble no let your countenance be changed there is a man in your kingdom everybody okay in whom the spirit of the holy gods and the days in the days of your father light and understanding and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods was found in him whom the king nebuchadnezzar remember your father the king i said your father made master of the magician astrologer cardin's and soof said for as much as an excellent spirit and knowledge and understanding interpreting of dreams and showing of heart sentence look at the quality of daniel and deserving the doubt we're found in the same daniel whom the king named hoop now let daniel be called and he will show the water why is this king not associated with daniel watch daniel was so famous that all astrology field daniel he was the top of all the magicians everybody knew daniel [Music] everybody okay but let's look at this king if he knows daniel jump to verse 13. then was daniel brought in before the who and the king spoke and said to who are you that daniel how can you be born and daniel is there and you don't know daniel how there was a pharaoh that rose that did not know [Music] how can you be there and don't know of joseph when prophecy is about to be fulfilled they will blend even the one that you think cannot be blind everybody okay how can daniel be there joseph was already dead but this one daniel is alive but when he look at dania he said is you daniel in other words the wings of the ego [Music] can i continue the wings of the ego has been water there is no more influence of the ego in the kingdom now the kingdom is going wild the middle pigeons are coming in [Music] everybody okay he said are you that daniel which are the church of the children of captivity of judah whom the king my water if the king was your father where were you all this time which the king my father brought out of water where were you of this time jump to verse 30. jump to verse 30 daniel interpret the vision in that night you there was beltaza the king of water they child indeed what they kill him verse 31 and derails the water the median took the water being about three score in water everybody okay so when he died the bear came and slew him and took the kingdom now they bear begin to reign everybody okay so far so this kingdom we understand it now started with a lion and a uh and an ego mixed together but when the wings of the ego is pulled off then he moved down from being a beast he entered a human being a human heart is given to the spirit in other words somebody who's human will receive that anointing in flesh everybody okay everybody okay let me go we remember that this beast there is a difference between tehran and zone you remember they all are wild beasts let me save this because of the time i gotta move on everybody okay when we look at the seven churches everybody okay brother bronham says that as the antichrist went four remember the kingdom of four four how many anticlasts four horses we have the white the red the black and the pair four remember when we look at this there were how many the fourth one was the water push the break everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay you good joy everybody okay on the on his beast of ministry god said full of water we have the zone and the tehran are fighting together everybody okay four beasts four holes right there both of them fighting within the vicinity of the church [Music] the water are trouble the people of the church are trouble are you following me the water of the sea are troubled by the four winds there is a combat between god and the devil among the people they seized trouble among the churches we okay [Music] every time the beast rode on his rose the antichrist hold on on his walls on his beast to announce his ministry god send water also and he was on that to announce and what because when the enemy comes like her the spirit of the lord does water so when the enemy went out as an antichrist god sent a certain power to do water he went out to us a red horse another caller another power another ministry god sent another one after him to combat him to do whatever because they are troubling the water if you watch this fine i'm gonna sword everybody here we found that the first horseradish was a white one and he covered the three churches everybody okay and god sent a lion [Music] you don't have time that's my problem god sent the water then god then the antiques come in the red horse god send the knox then the antichrist came also in the black horse god sent luther he said luther wesley and also pentecostal [Music] okay brother bottom said the reformers down through the edges come the face of water their reform as has been seized water and water calves and on down to what that's why i put him there everybody okay but the fourth one is number one plus plus green view there [Music] the antichrist is on the perils a water a horse is a beast that represented power why it's politic national power it's religious power it's demon power it's all kind of power done water tree powers united water all mixed up in color that is water and the name is water that speaks of the water politics death religion death demonic death because satan is the king of politics the fourth beast is number one number two number three the fourth horse radar is number one number two number three mixed together everybody okay so far glory to god now when god saw that god have to send another power because it's in the edge of laodicea and god said what them everybody okay everybody okay the babylonian kingdom started with water and it has water our kingdom started with water and it's ending up with water why can i continue when we start to lift the gentler oh god help me can i raise this lord help me oh my god when we start with the gender we found out that the gentiles started with nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar who was a king a servant of god he was associated with dania and daniel was a prophet amen and his kingdom was both a lion mixed with ego wings everybody okay now we found out that in the church ages the first anointing god sand is a lion everybody here and the lion was in the edge of paul everybody okay go go watch again this hills and the power was a prophet everybody okay and then down the road at the end we found an ego ever here a flying ego with branham everybody here and then branham also is a prophet everybody okay so far where are you taking me branham take us from laodicea all the way to the broad age but throughout the first seal we okay when the first ones right they all show up something happened in 325 they gave him a crown [Music] when nebuchadnezzar started he was a lion with ego wings after a while the eagle wings will be plugged off and he will remain a lion but with a human heart with a human water in other words he will incarnate a human being amen everybody okay let's see what happened in the first seal the bible by the bottom say he start out to conquer notice he had water because the bible says when he went later on they gave him a crown brother branham said he was the white horse rather i'm speaking of here a ball and a crown was giving him water not at the beginning he had no crown to start with but the crown was water leather he was given a water three of them three on one that was 300 years in the nazi council anybody okay let me skip this for the sake of time now when nicolette anticlass is finally is finally he's incarnate in a what then he's what brother branham said when he received the crown is when the spirit was incarnate into a man and he was in 325 which was no longer in the age of paul everybody here he was the first age was ephesus and then smyrna and then pergamus a pergamus is when the antichrist was incarnate and he see vikrant everybody okay in nebuchadnezzar no problem in evil merodic no problem in beltaza that's when the lion didn't have the wings of ego and incarnation happened incarnation in the third step incarnation in the third step any question [Music] sorry my friend i'm just flipping the airplane okay okay he said when he incarnate his crown when he started off he was a nasty nicolette and spirit in the church he is a water you can crown a spirit you have to put him in a human being then you crown him in other words the spirit that started as a horse got a human heart [Music] remember here but 300 years old he become a water and they did water so he became a human being called the purple in other words the purple is the antichrist spirit and connected in a man belchazza was the lion spirit and connected in a man three step three steps did i lose you glory to god everybody okay and in the titanian age everybody okay as soon as the spirit incarnate the age that started italian we found jezebel the woman the beast at the beginning and the beast at the end after this an immoral woman after it is incarnated in a pope it was a devil here the devil incarnated pope and what follow is an immoral woman do you remember the church last sunday do you remember the chart it is saturn certain move to the beast [Music] and the beast moved to a woman and the woman will give a cane which is a religious man amen and a king will begin also the daughters amen this immoral jezebel according to the age of tartarian we saw it last last sunday the bible says i will cast her in the bed and then that commit adultery with her amen into a great tribulation and he said i will kill her water everybody okay so there is a children of jezebel a can which is a man religious you have a beast you have satan we already have that antichrist everybody here we have a pope which is a religious man we have a jezebel in the church age with her children we are missing this guy did i lose you i'm gonna stop here because it's too much everybody okay where are you going where are you going that's why paul say i am jealous of you you the church because i want to present you as a water as a chess virgin to who by but i feel less water began water through water where is the serpent we saw the serpent at the beginning and we know that in the beginning we know that in the beginning the serpent was a beast in the garden of eden but at the end the serpent is water we already seen the purple incarnated and he is also water let me jump this and not stop you ready the beginning is water and the beginning is water and after the business follow up and after woman follow up and after came forward but in here we find that nebuchadnezzar started like a lion with ego when you take the ego it's incarnation when paul started with the church no problem in the church you remember but when they kill paul after my departure after my departure after the wings are [Music] taken everybody okay everybody okay they will come water and guess what later on a man was incarnated everybody care everybody okay so far the anointing that was with paul was a lion anointing for the entire age everybody okay everybody okay in other words the entire age was under a lion but babylon is also a lion everybody okay to control the lion you need the ego wings everybody okay everybody okay so the eagle wings must be always present anybody okay in order to control the lion if you take the eagle wings off the lion is incarnated in a human being [Music] everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay but here the age the believer were only under the anointing of a lion everybody okay the prophet was a message the messenger was a prophet but the age was a lion everybody okay so when the prophet goes out everybody okay the age remain and the lion all they can do is fight but they cannot control babylon are you following me they can continue to fight with a lion anointing but babylon is already free [Music] the neglect and spirit begin to work and he moved until he became the throne of satan go through the church ages you're gonna see that amen because eden is now open remember the last words rather his name was what the tree of death was there if the tree of death is there in the church ages we must have the tree of life open revelation too and i stop here i can't take you where i want it to be because it's now if i take you i'm gonna take him on two hours we gotta stop and let you chew throughout the week everybody okay go to revelation chapter two and then i'll end okay so this is a different it's uh it's an airfly airplane for fight so the landing is also different okay my friend all right so keep everything you got a helmet and everything because we can flip okay verse one to the angel of the church of water which church is it the church the first church the name is ephesus which is power okay job to verse 7 the reward of the people from ephesus he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the water to him the water will i give to eat of water [Music] of water the water we are back again at the beginning now in the church we have the tree of life he's back again and the tree of what the knowledge of good and evil the two trees are back again that's why paul said i feel because what happened in eden is coming back again in the church everybody okay now everybody okay now so in order to control babylon you need to have the eagle wings but the only god wins for the edge in emphasis that was the messenger the top they were under other prophets like agabus and the other one but they were not at the caliber of paul because paul was the messenger so paul being the messenger remember paul saw the antichrist and he said i see what happened in eden it's about to happen now now i'm fearing because i'm trying everything i can to keep the church virgin to present you to jesus christ but i know after my departure when they plug the winds of the ego everybody okay babylon will be again water will be free let me stop here we will continue where am i going to stop the age of ephesus have they lie on anointing amen the prophetic powerful anointing was on power when paul is removed the prophet that remained a man they are not strong enough to fight babylon then babylon progress multiply and take the church and darkness begin to get an entity and jezebel is sitting in the church because the wings of the ego has been watered but in the last age cannot continue can i continue they are knocking of the edge is an eagle anointing everybody okay and the messenger is an ego you can take the messenger away but the illegal anointing [Applause] is still controlling babylon hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's why in revelation 10 when he's coming down [Music] ever here he's controlling babylon because it's what in other words even power according to paul if i go away i'm afraid but according to william marion pranam i must decrease so that he can watch him and even if he drove the pillar of fire the unknown is still there the wings of the ego are still protecting and covering babylon let's stand my friend let's stand my friend [Applause] glory to god everybody here the edge is under the ingo wings there's nothing babylon will do that's why brother branham said we have the devil answer you can leave this message it doesn't do anything you can create a built-in move you won't do anything the election will not be deceived [Applause] the elect will not be deceived because the knowledge is under the equal anointing [Applause] buddy listen to me go home replay this go over again so next time because i'm gonna use the same airplane i have to shoot with it everybody okay and you're gonna see what he does with the ego wings let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly father this morning lord thanking you for your grace often we have the master himself that is right in the midst of us and that's no wonder you can say fear not little brother because you knew what you put in this brand babylon can continue to rather but we are not of this world we don't even belong in laodicea we are all the way in the broad age now we are separated like in goshen where everything is under control father may you help your children if there is nobody here or someone that have not gotten the second oil yet that maybe was stuck [Music] in the water or stuck by the blood but lord never the spirit father may you be merciful unto them that you can move them to that third stage where they can have the oil because without the soil it is not the festoid it is the second oil it is the oil of christ it is the oil of wisdom it is the oil of mystery and it's that all that can control babylon even though the prophet is no longer on the scene father we are not like those of paul and you even say lord father that we're not really going back to that because we are more than poor we have paul plus the capstone prophetic ministry further appropriate to break the image completely in every form the capstone will destroy it because you prove that you waited until the enemy can be combined into one beast so that you can destroy him one time and further we are in the edge that the enemies combine into one horseradish and father you send the capstone ministry because you knew that that is the prescription that would take care of the devil in all form of aspect father may you open the revelation to your children may they realize that seriousness of the hour and may those that are struggling even just to come to church father be merciful to them shake their way shake their eyes shake their heart from defeats of the world from whatever is showing them away from the church [Music] because the hour is late and father may you continue with your children continue to unfold your word continue to keep them consecrated continue to let them lord go back and read this scripture read daniel read all these things lord so that you can afford them more than what we can see here lord father we ask you everything and we thank you may you touch the sick and those that are suffering and if somebody came with a need father may you give it to them according to the bead lord in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you church we love you thank you for the sacrifice god bless you great job [Music] [Applause] [Music] am [Music] uh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] lord me lord we love you y'all can be just [Music] you [Music] you [Music] bye [Music]
