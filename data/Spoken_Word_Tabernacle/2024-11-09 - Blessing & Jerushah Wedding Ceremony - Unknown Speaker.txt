brother blessing you stand right here and look at the sister amen it's a day of rejoicing so there is no formality here just be free you want to shout you shout you want to Laugh You Laugh You Want To Praise You praise God amen glory to God I'm just waiting for the lights so I can see you both better amen we greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and on behalf of the families and the church we welcome you to this marriage ceremony joining brother blessing atle and sister jerusha fby soon to be changing I will now invite you to the reading of the scripture but before we read let's thank the author of the book Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly again father this evening thanking you for your grace for your love for your Mercy because it's your grace and your love and your mercy that it provided everything that we can see tonight Lord and Lord we are very limited to our own ability and your Prophet taught us to master the human element Lord may you come and move me completely out of the way may you be the one uniting and blessing Lord father this couple be the beginning and the ending of this ceremony as we commit everything unto thy hand in the name name of Jesus Christ amen amen my reading will be in Genesis chapter 1 and verse one the Bible says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word amen you say how can you read such a short scripture and talk about marriage amen the Bible says in the beginning so it's a specific time a specific period of time we don't have to guess whether it's in the end or before the beginning but we know clearly that it's in the beginning and the Bible says in the beginning God singular created the Heaven and Earth this great being here we call him God and What attracted my attention is God is singular and he's the one creating everything if you look at him he look like a light that's right because the Bible says in second Timothy chapter 6 verse1 15 that which in his term he shall show who is the blessed and the only pented the king of kings and Lord of lords who only has immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach whom no man has seen nor can see to whom be honor and power Everlasting amen amen so the beginning give me a connection to another scripture in the Book of John 1 verse one the Bible says in John chap 1 verse one in the beginning again was the word okay now it's no longer God it's the word and the Bible says and the Word was with God if we stop right there it looks like it's two person we got the word and we got God but that's not the case the Bible continue that in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so the word and God are the same the very same person God who was invisible now is manifested in the light called the word of God or the Theologian use the terminology a theophany or the logos are we together praise God so what I noticed is this God is singular the Bible didn't say Gods the Bible say God the Bible didn't say words the Bible say word it's singular amen and throughout Genesis this God begin to create and the Bible say and God say singular and God made singular and God called singular everything God singular but when we look at what he was creating it doesn't look singular amen we see one being but when he's creating two things appears why is he creating everything by pairs brother Branham says in the message marriage and divorce preached in 1965 in February the 21st in the morning paragraph 91 brother brandham says if Jesus say go back to the beginning there was only one pair of anything on Earth there was one Adam one Eve they were joined together by God Alone one female horse one male one female parrot one male at the beginning as he told us to go back there was only one pair of everything in the beginning a single God when he created two things male female that's right when you look at this zebra two zebra but it's one God he oh Israel the Lord your God is one God but when that God create two elephant when he creates two pigs when he create two tur do everything is two why is he single in appearance but everything he's making is double amen amen Paul in the Book of Romans chapter 1 verse 20 says that for the invisible things or the invisible qualities of him of God from the creation of the world are clearly seen and being understood by the things which are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse so Paul is saying that everything that God created is only expressing God in other word if you don't understand this God look at the things that he's created and when you look at everything that he's creating it's double male and female when you turn around it's one entity God or you call him the word or you call him the logos or you call him the theophany but it's still one being why is one being expressing himself in double beings amen amen until when he was about to destroy the anti Delian world he T Noah he said I'm trying to preserve the species by the way you preserve them bring them two by two so that when everything is destroyed the new world that is coming on will have an expression of two and two and the and the scripture say everything that he was creating the say and he was good and he was good and he was good the first day and he was good the second day and he was good the third day and he was good the fourth day and he was good the fifth day until the sixth day amen and if you search the scripture from the first day to the sixth day God always said let let there be let there be let there be let there be but on the sixth day a strange statement escape this God in Genesis 1 verse 26 the Bible say and God say let us Oh I thought that this God is one being I thought that this God is single I thought that this God is only one light but God when he was creating the zebra he never never say let us that's right when he was creating the chicken he never say let us when he was creating the monkey he never say let us he say Let There be let there be let there be but when you look at the expression of his work everything is male female male female then on the sixth day he changed his terminology he said let us oh God here oh Israel the Lord your God is one God but God is saying let us he said let us make man so God was not alone that's right because he didn't say let me make men he said let us so there was someone that's right that was with God and hidden in God and that was creating with God are we together I'm just reading the Bible amen he said let us make men in our image not in my image oh so this light that look like one light is not really one light inside that light it's us and the Bible say let make let us make men in our image that's right amen so everybody stop whoever was cleaning the dishes drop the dishes finally we're going to see an expression of this God finally we're going to see a species that will look exactly like the one that was creating everything okay since it's one light so we assume that when his reflection comes up it's going to be one individual because he didn't say let's create men in plural he said let's create men one m a n one so you see it's one person surprisingly the Bible says and God say let us make man in our image after our likeness in other word whatever is going to be created will look exactly like God that's right or will look exactly like the one who's creating that's right let's see how it looks the Bible say and let them have Domin over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping things that creepeth upon the Earth so God singular created man singular in his own image in the image of God created he him singular male and female create Ed he them now we begin to understand let us that God was not alone because his perfect reflection upon the Earth came also as a pair a pair of a male and a female and that was the image of God and it was the likeness of God in other word God is male and female can I have a witness are we together so God is never single I'm letting that soak in my friend amen I'm reading the Holy Scripture he created man not one person he created double person male and female in the Book of Genesis 5 verse one the Bible say this is the book of the generations of Adam in the day that God created man in the likeness of God made he him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam so when you say Adam is not a name for only a man reading the Bible my friend when you say Adam don't be surprised that two individual appears amen the Bible didn't say Adams but Adam singular so when they say God it doesn't mean one God because according to the scripture 1 + 1 equal one that's why in The Book of Revelation when John was taken up to heaven the Bible say and one sat on the throne the Bible never say and one man sat on the throne verify your Bible the Bible say one sat on the throne go ahead why one why not one man because in the Book of Revelation chapter 3 the Bible said to him that Overcomers shall sit with me on my Throne so God is not the only one sitting on the throne he's sitting with somebody God is male and female God have a bride God have a wife the wife of the Lamb that's why the Bible say the wife of the Lamb Behold The Marriage of the Lamb has come even God have a marriage it's called The Marriage of the Lamb that lamb is not an animal because when John look at him he said Behold the Lamb of God he was a human being amen amen so what I'm trying to say is God is male and female amen the Bible says in the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 4:4 in whom the God of this world has Blended the minds of them which believe not L the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them so the image of God is Christ yes and Man was created in the image of God yes I'm reading the Bible my friend amen amen so the man that was created was a Christ male and female because God himself is male and female amen when God uh concluded the sixth day God never say it is good but he used something different in Genesis 1 verse uh 31 the Bible say and God s everything that he had made and behold he was very good no longer good very good everything double male female his own reflection male female then God say he was very good if you notice no marriage ceremony was initiated in Genesis 1 ahead I let you soak in my friend because they were already connected they were already United they only have one name both male and female they were they could not be separated God created them hook together so when God call Adam it's Adam and Eve coming together when go when God say blessing the break my soon is going to be blessing and someone call [Applause] blessing are we together in Genesis chapter 2 something happened now in verse 7 the bible says and the Lord God form man of the Dust of the ground and breathe into his nostal the breath of life and Man became a living soul Verse 18 and the Lord God say it is not good for the first time when he created everything it is good it is good it is good at the end he say it is very good for the first time God say it is not good what happened why is it not good let the scripture answer and the Lord God say it is not good that man should be alone in Genesis when he created man he was male and female in Genesis 1 but in Genesis 2 when God formed man from the dust of the earth men came up as one individual it was no longer a reflection of God he was no longer the image and the likess of God because the image and the likeness of God from the Animal Kingdom all the way to the human species it's always male and female but now we found one male am no female and God himself who created Adam look he say wait a minute something doesn't look right in Genesis 1 it was a union in the spirit because God is a spirit so Adam and Eve were spiritual being but in Genesis 2 they were no longer spiritual being he was natural being but he appeared to be only one a male and God look he say it is no longer good that Adam remain alone in other word Adam is no longer reflecting me the way I want it to be reflected amen so God found a solution he said you know what I will make him a help me to him to save time amen he put Adam under a general anesthesia amen and never took another ground never never took another piece of dust he went to the very body of Adam and preform a surgery and pull a rib and from that rib God created or form a woman amen and God brought the woman back again to man then at that point what was manifested in flesh sir begin to again reflect what was Heaven in other word marriage on this Earth is only a reflection of the true image of God Amen when you bring a woman and unite her with a man we actually bringing both entities both species both male and emale and female back again to the original position am amen so now today brother blessing you really going to reflect God Amen so marriage is only a bond that unite us back again to our original image and through marriage then we can reflect God because God created everything pair God is male and female and his children brother blessing you're going to be today male and female are we together Paul says this this is the reason he says this in the book of Ephesians he said this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church brother Bram says this in the mar uh in the message the marriage of the lamb in 1962 paragraph 63 brother brandham say I like to think of weddings I have had the privilege of marrying quite a few people and I think when I bring a young man like brother blessing and a young woman like sister jerusha down to the Altar and see them come down through the church just like they did and she pray that's his brother Bram just say Amen because she does look pretty my daughters looks pretty because these are the daughters of the king he said pretty with her wedding garment on and the veil over her face and hanging down and the bridegroom straight dress beautiful I'm reading brother Bram amen and Young and full of vigor as they walk down down there in their very best of life and take that marriage vow I think there is something sweet about it there is something sacred because that it reminds me that there will be another great wedding someday when Christ Brad will come walking down the corridors of Glory so what is happening here it's only a reflection of Heaven amen God is giving you a test here so what my prayer is for you to be one for you to be in True Fellowship until no one can tell who is who and when we say blessings it's going to be two people dear beloved we are gathered here in the sight of God and in the face of this company to join together this and this woman in holy matrimony which is commanded by St Paul to be honorable
