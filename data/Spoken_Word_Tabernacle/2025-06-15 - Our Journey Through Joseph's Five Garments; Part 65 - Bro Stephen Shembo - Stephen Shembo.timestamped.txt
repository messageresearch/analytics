[0:06] to Benny. It's just a little bitty
[0:08] thing. And so I take her on a honeymoon
[0:11] is on a hunting trip too, you know. So
[0:13] So I thought that'd be a good thing to
[0:15] do. And so I took her up and the I wrote
[0:18] to Mr. Denton, the ranger, was going up
[0:21] on Hurricane Mountain, and I said, "Mr.
[0:23] Denton, I'm coming up. I want to hunt
[0:25] some bear with you this fall." And he
[0:27] said, "Okay, Billy, come on up." So he
[0:29] said, "I'll be up there on a certain
[0:30] certain date." Well, wife and I got

[0:52] alert." Is that right, brother Fred? I
[0:54] went and told hundreds of people that
[0:55] night over in Vermont. I said, "Is there
[0:58] a trap set for me? I'm going to see it.

[10:09] Good morning, Lord. We thank you, Lord.
[10:11] We thank you for this beautiful day
[10:13] you've given us, Lord.
[10:15] We thank you, Lord, for the message
[10:17] you've given us, Lord. This is our
[10:19] chariot, Lord. is this word, Lord. And
[10:22] we thank you, Father. We thank you for
[10:26] the ticket, Lord, that we can ride our
[10:29] way to heaven, Lord God, on this word,
[10:32] Lord. Let us be determined, Lord. No
[10:36] turning back, but just moving forward
[10:39] with you, Lord. Turning every corner
[10:41] that you place before us, Lord. We thank
[10:44] you, Father, today because it's Father's
[10:47] Day here, Lord. And we just want to give
[10:50] credit, Lord, to you, Lord God. I don't
[10:53] have a scripture specifically to read
[10:55] about fathers, Lord, because I feel like
[10:58] the whole word is our example, Lord God.
[11:02] You're our father, Lord. You're Jehovah
[11:04] Gyra, Lord, our provider.
[11:07] You've taught us, Lord, how to be good
[11:09] fathers, Lord. You've taught us how to
[11:11] be good husbands, Lord God, and how to
[11:14] be good Christians, Lord. We want to be
[11:17] the best that we can for our father,
[11:19] Lord.
[11:21] So we ask for our portion of daily bread
[11:23] once again this morning, Father, for
[11:26] this day. Bless our pastor, Lord, as he
[11:31] prepares to bring the word.
[11:34] Bless the songs, Lord, as we prepare to
[11:36] till the soil, Lord, for the seed to
[11:38] fall into it, Lord. We thank you,
[11:41] Father. Bless our musicians. Bless our
[11:43] singers, Lord. Bless our technicians as
[11:46] well, Lord God, that everything run just
[11:49] perfectly smooth for you this morning,
[11:51] Lord. For that's our goal, Lord, to be
[11:53] pleasing to you. You have given us so
[11:56] much, Lord, to be thankful for, Lord
[11:58] God. And we don't we don't want to take
[12:01] it for granted, Lord. And we want to be
[12:03] careful that we give you all the glory
[12:05] for everything that you do in our lives,
[12:07] Lord. You're so good to us, Lord God.
[12:09] There's just no way, no way to fully
[12:12] express it, Lord. If we had 10,000
[12:15] tongues, Lord, we couldn't say enough
[12:18] about the goodness in our lives that
[12:19] you've provided, Lord, and the mercy,
[12:21] Lord. We all did dumb stuff, Lord,
[12:25] before we came to this message and did
[12:27] some stupid things in our lives, Lord
[12:29] God, and just you'd think we'd have been
[12:32] the worst
[12:34] person never to become a Christian,
[12:36] Lord. But you changed all that, Lord
[12:38] God.
[12:40] We thought we were good church members,
[12:41] Lord, and good message believers even,
[12:43] Lord. But we come to find out, Lord,
[12:45] that you had more for us, Lord God. And
[12:48] you had to pull us away, Lord God.
[12:51] And look what you've done now, Lord.
[12:54] This is this is your credit, Lord. This
[12:57] little assembly, Lord, of believers
[12:59] here, Lord God. The love here, Lord, is
[13:02] just tremendous.
[13:04] And we thank you, Father.
[13:07] So we ask you bless the fathers today,
[13:09] Lord. Bless the families, Lord, that are
[13:12] here. Bless those that are streaming,
[13:14] Lord God. Let the anointing be strong
[13:17] for our pastor this morning, Lord God.
[13:19] And unhindered, Lord, that nothing
[13:21] blocks that word from coming forth. We
[13:24] thank you, Lord. We want to give you all
[13:27] the credit this morning, Lord God. And
[13:28] just ask that you would bless this
[13:30] service, Lord. For we give it back to
[13:32] you, Lord, in the precious name of Jesus
[13:34] Christ. Amen. And amen. Amen. Let's give
[13:38] him a clap offering this morning.
[13:41] You turn around and greet your neighbor
[13:43] and say, "Happy Father's Day." And we're
[13:45] just going to enjoy ourselves and sing a
[13:47] little bit this morning.
[13:50] Amen.

[23:18] it? Ye are God's. Oh my goodness. I do
[23:23] have some uh praise reports this
[23:25] morning. And we just received one prayer
[23:27] request. I've got two prayer requests.
[23:29] Uh, let me wet the whistle here and
[23:31] we'll read it and uh probably get
[23:33] brother Michael Lomach to come up and
[23:34] pray if he doesn't mind this morning.
[23:40] Happy steak day. Isn't that right,
[23:42] fathers?
[23:44] I just about I'm just about ready,
[23:45] brother. I got to read a few things just
[23:47] about.
[23:49] Yeah, this is not TV dinner day for the
[23:52] fathers. This is Longhorn steak day.
[23:59] See, I knew I'd get one.
[24:03] So, Brother Greg handed me a praise
[24:05] report this morning, and he said, "Like
[24:07] John Ryan,
[24:09] I want to thank the Lord for restoring
[24:11] my sight to 2020."
[24:14] Amen.
[24:16] Praise God. Amen.
[24:21] I I'm going to be honest with y'all. I
[24:23] have never met another brother who
[24:25] believes more in the spoken word and
[24:28] following through on it than Brother
[24:30] Greg. Amen. He is not scared to declare

[25:18] home to Georgia. Um, if y'all recall a
[25:20] while back, we were praying over over
[25:22] his grandfather and um well, he had

[25:54] had to go back home, so she's not
[25:56] feeling well. So, let's remember her,
[25:59] Brother Michael.
[26:01] And uh I'm sure we all have

[46:39] Youngsman meeting. Brother Robert, I'm

[46:43] confirmed to me the date and then next
[46:46] Sunday we will announce it for courtship
[46:48] part two by God's grace. And remember
[46:51] question and answer in July the 19th. I
[46:55] believe everyone is up to date with the
[46:57] sermon. I believe you're reading your
[47:00] Bible twice a day. You're reading your
[47:02] cood, your church ages, your 70 weeks of
[47:05] tenure. the seal's adoption or somebody
[47:08] is listening to the message of the hour.
[47:10] I cannot forget that by God's grace. If
[47:12] I do, brother Charles, you remind me.
[47:14] So, I'll make sure the church we stay up
[47:17] to date with that one. Amen. So, Lord's
[47:20] willing question and answer July the
[47:22] 19th and the merit couple meeting. I'm
[47:24] waiting for a response from the
[47:26] facility. I'm trying to shoot it for
[47:29] August or September. I'm trying to give
[47:32] you ample time. I don't want to do it
[47:34] too quick because sometime you might
[47:36] have something that is already prepared
[47:38] or you already have maybe a trip or
[47:41] something that is going on. So I usually
[47:43] give like two month or three months so
[47:45] you have ample time to make arrangements
[47:48] so no one misses it and say I was not
[47:50] aware. So once I get the date from the
[47:53] hotel facility, I will send the date in
[47:55] the group chat. So manage to respond
[47:58] quickly so we can seal the date and then
[48:01] we know what to do. And it's going to be
[48:03] part seven. I will see the couple
[48:06] question that they put compare uh in
[48:08] regard to the previous subject. But I
[48:10] want to start with finances and get
[48:13] finances in the marriages. Amen. We need
[48:16] to clear all the trouble in the
[48:18] marriages. We don't want any problem
[48:20] because the devil attack those area. I
[48:22] told you three area. The first one I
[48:24] deal with it here. The second one we
[48:26] already dealt with it. And the third one
[48:29] is finances because that's the probably
[48:32] one of the worst one. And if it's not
[48:35] working fine, it's a trouble. I don't
[48:37] want to leak everything right now
[48:38] because you will take me to a different
[48:40] direction. I already know how you act in
[48:42] this church. So
[48:45] I won't leak anything. So just pray for
[48:47] me. But I'm shooting for August and
[48:50] September. We work in coordination with
[48:52] the deacon and we come up with uh uh a
[48:56] decision. As far as the building goes,
[48:58] you already seen the entire fellowship
[49:00] hall has been dropped over there. That's
[49:03] uh
[49:12] how we did it. I don't know
[49:16] because they were not supposed to bring
[49:19] the material without us paying that off.
[49:23] [Applause]
[49:31] And the amazing part what we were
[49:34] keeping for the fellowship hall is what
[49:36] we use up over there.
[49:40] Jesus will do it. So they call me they
[49:42] say we need the last payment. I was like
[49:45] okay okay the Lord will provide.
[49:50] So now the will bear
[49:53] of meal and oil
[49:56] is very low but God is available.
[50:03] Amen.
[50:05] Amen.
[50:08] Amen.
[50:10] I hope somebody's learning how to live
[50:15] because the tendency we have to wait to
[50:17] receive everything before we actuh.
[50:21] You start moving.
[50:24] I don't want to get ahead of the sermon.
[50:26] You start moving first and God will
[50:29] begin to fill in
[50:34] the best deal. The best deal we can get
[50:37] for the foundation of the fellowship
[50:40] hall is $67,000.
[50:43] We don't have it.
[50:46] I'm already announcing you. We don't
[50:48] have it. God has it. But God has it.
[50:53] Am I going to stop working? No.
[50:56] [Applause]
[50:58] Every little penny I'm getting from the
[51:00] talent. Amen. And I called the me and I
[51:03] said, "Listen, we a small church. We
[51:05] just started. Can we cut and chop these
[51:08] things down? I will teach you on
[51:10] finances how to do that. And he say yes,
[51:13] we can do it.
[51:16] So instead of waiting, whatever I get,
[51:19] whatever I get and we keep moving. And I
[51:24] guarantee you there is only one thing
[51:25] that's going to stop this project is the
[51:27] coming of the Lord.
[51:30] [Applause]
[51:33] If the Lord have not come back yet, no
[51:36] devil.
[51:41] [Applause]
[51:48] We will make it all the way to the end.
[51:51] Oh, glory to God. So, keep praying what
[51:55] you see there. We are waiting for
[51:57] inspector to go through the inspection
[51:59] and once they finish then we continue
[52:02] doing what we got. We got few stop the
[52:04] inspector have to come and check and
[52:05] make sure the screw is here whatever is
[52:07] here. So just keep praying. We got to go
[52:10] through what we got to go because we
[52:11] need to obey the state. That's right.
[52:13] When it come to the fence of the state.
[52:15] Amen. I sent you a message in the uh in
[52:19] the group chat. I believe you got those
[52:21] quotes right. Uh maybe somebody was
[52:23] alarmed that uh who are they going to
[52:25] put in the hand of the devil? We're not
[52:27] going to put no one in the hand of the
[52:28] devil.
[52:30] But it's good to know those things.
[52:33] Amen. Because the church doesn't operate
[52:36] as individual.
[52:39] Amen.
[52:41] The church operate as a body.
[52:44] That's why when you have wedding, you're
[52:46] not alone. That's it. We all come up in
[52:49] weddings because it's everybody. When
[52:52] you suffer, we all get there. When you
[52:55] have a loss, we all come together. And
[52:58] when you sin, we also come together.
[53:01] Amen.
[53:02] Amen. Let me start it back again. When
[53:06] you rejoice, we will rejoice with you.
[53:08] When you suffer, we will suffer with
[53:10] you. When you get out of the line, we
[53:12] won't leave you go out of line
[53:15] because you belong to us.
[53:18] We will stand with you and we will come
[53:20] to rescue you whether you are a preacher
[53:25] or not because sometime it's like okay
[53:28] if you a musician if you a deacon you do
[53:31] something then you're going to get
[53:32] punished. No even if you sit on the pew
[53:35] even if you never say amen. Amen. If you
[53:38] do something wrong, we come after you
[53:42] to rescue you and to kick the devil out
[53:45] because we want to pick you up. We don't
[53:48] want to lose you. We want to go with you
[53:49] into the rapture because you are part of
[53:52] us. In other words, whatever you do will
[53:56] affect us.
[53:58] Your happiness will be our happiness.
[54:01] Your success will be our success and
[54:03] your failure is going to be our failure.
[54:06] So whenever you do something, if we come
[54:08] around, don't be frustrated. We just
[54:10] want to rescue you and kick the devil
[54:13] out because you belong to us. You are
[54:15] part of us. So just remember, whether
[54:17] you're a musician, whether you're a
[54:19] churchy, whether you're a deacon,
[54:20] whatever you do in school, whatever you
[54:22] do at work, whatever you do when no one
[54:24] is there, if your brother sees you, he's
[54:27] under responsibility to talk to you. If
[54:30] your sister sees you, your sister is
[54:31] under responsibility to talk to you. And
[54:34] if you suffer, your brother is under
[54:36] responsibility to come and help you. If
[54:38] you in need, you are under
[54:40] responsibility to support one another,
[54:42] to help one another. You cannot see your
[54:44] brother suffering and then you sit
[54:46] there, you say, "I'm going to pray for
[54:47] you." No, you need to go to the brother
[54:49] and say, "What are you suffering? Is
[54:51] there anything we can help you with?"
[54:53] And if it's in your mean to help him,
[54:55] help the person. If God give you a
[54:58] little bit more the money, help your
[54:59] brother because we are part of the same
[55:02] family. Amen. So never be ashamed to
[55:05] say, "Brother Steven, I don't have food
[55:06] at home." Yes, sir.
[55:09] [Music]
[55:10] Never be ashamed to say that I'm
[55:12] struggling in this area. We are all
[55:14] together in this thing. And as a matter
[55:18] of fact, Amen.
[55:20] My name is in the book of life.
[55:24] So you won't go in the rapture without
[55:26] me. Yes.
[55:32] As far as you think you are already
[55:35] close to the Lord, you don't go to the
[55:37] rapture without me.
[55:39] So you better make things right with me.
[55:42] So we can go in the rapture
[55:46] because you ain't going because my name
[55:48] is there.
[55:50] Are we together? Are we together? So
[55:53] remember whatever you do it's all of us.
[55:56] Amen. Amen. When we say okay this this
[55:59] person is engaged here you're not the
[56:02] only one rejoicing. The whole church is
[56:04] rejoicing. Brother so and so graduated.
[56:06] The whole church is rejoicing. So if you
[56:09] are have trouble Samaria the whole
[56:12] church have a right to ask where is
[56:14] sister so and so. Where is brother so
[56:17] and so? Don't say uh that's my private.
[56:18] Uh uh uh there's no private li you part
[56:20] of us here and we need to know where you
[56:22] are. We need to know what happened to
[56:24] you. We need to know why you don't come
[56:27] to church.
[56:29] [Applause]
[56:30] Amen.
[56:32] Are we together? So love one another,
[56:35] support one another, stand for one
[56:37] another, protect one another.
[56:39] [Applause]
[56:43] If they say something bad about you, the
[56:45] first thing I rescue you first and then
[56:48] I begin to deal with the devil.
[56:52] That's the truth. Are we together? I'm
[56:55] not going to be there to help the devil
[56:57] destroy you.
[57:00] Amen.
[57:02] Thank you, Lord. Then the devil, listen,
[57:04] this is family issue. You're not part of
[57:07] our family. So I cannot talk to you
[57:10] about my sister or my brother. You leave
[57:13] the premises first.
[57:16] Then I will talk with my own sister and
[57:19] with my own brother without you being
[57:21] present.
[57:25] [Applause]
[57:26] Are we together? So are you going to do
[57:29] very good today to give me time? You

[58:05] scripture.
[58:11] You watch over me. I watch over you.
[58:16] That's why it's good to stay in the
[58:18] neighborhood where Christians are.
[58:23] That's my brother. So that when you're
[58:26] trying to get into the nightclub, you
[58:27] will see Sister Kayla walking around.
[58:30] You say, "Sister Kayla is it's
[58:32] protection.

[58:38] don't care about his brother. If you ask
[58:40] him he say I don't know what about my
[58:42] brother. Stay within the vicinity where

[59:00] call you and say
[59:07] I know that I want my private life. I'm
[59:10] going to go far away from the people.
[59:14] When you die over there, it would take
[59:17] me time to drive on a highway before we
[59:20] rescue you.
[59:23] Amen, brother. Have I said something?
[59:25] [Laughter]

[59:31] what are you going to do?
[59:33] If you're closer to me, I will just come
[59:35] and pick you up. I said I said if you're
[59:38] far away in the bushes there, then good
[59:40] luck.
[59:43] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. It is a blessing
[59:47] to have a Christian family.
[59:50] Yes, it is.
[59:51] [Music]
[59:53] You don't know what it does for me to
[59:55] just sit with you and just fellowship.
[59:57] It is relaxing my mind. It's relaxing.
[1:00:00] It's telling me I'm in the I have people
[1:00:03] that I can talk. They think like me.
[1:00:06] Because the world is insane.
[1:00:10] So don't never take for granted one
[1:00:13] another sitting around you. You need one
[1:00:16] another.
[1:00:17] Amen. We need one. Even a smile would
[1:00:21] touch somebody
[1:00:23] and change their life.
[1:00:26] People are looking for people to just
[1:00:28] tell them what they're going through
[1:00:31] just to just
[1:00:33] express and release the tension.
[1:00:38] So be that person that come and talk to
[1:00:41] me and we will pray together. Yes. And
[1:00:43] we will remain here.
[1:00:47] Not on Facebook. No sir. Not on
[1:00:49] Instagram.
[1:00:51] Are we together?
[1:00:54] Leave the fellow alone. We need to know
[1:00:56] that he's around here. Amen. So let's
[1:01:00] pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[1:01:02] approaching you humbly this morning.
[1:01:05] Father, we thank you for your grace,
[1:01:07] your love, your mercy, and for
[1:01:08] everything you have been doing. You you
[1:01:11] have been doing in our lives, Lord.
[1:01:13] Father, thank you for your presence and
[1:01:14] thank you for a wonderful family, Lord.

[1:01:19] like precious faith that we can come
[1:01:21] together sit and fellowship about the
[1:01:23] things of the kingdom. Lord this is as
[1:01:26] far as I can go with the ability you
[1:01:28] have given me. But when it comes to Lord
[1:01:30] father ministering to your children I am
[1:01:33] completely unable. He take the
[1:01:35] supernatural action of the Holy Spirit
[1:01:38] in me through the gift you have placed
[1:01:40] in our life and also in the congregation
[1:01:42] so that you'll be the one speaking, the
[1:01:44] one hearing, the one interpreting, the
[1:01:46] one feeling, touching and Lord Father,
[1:01:49] the God who is all in all. Lord, we
[1:01:52] rebuke every attack from the work of
[1:01:54] darkness away from this place. Lord,
[1:01:56] Father, may you help us as we entering,
[1:01:59] Lord, Father, your word in the name of
[1:02:01] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Let's go to
[1:02:04] Jeremiah 29 verse 11.
[1:02:09] So when I post something, make sure you
[1:02:12] look at and don't glance, but read it
[1:02:16] carefully because I post them on
[1:02:18] purpose.
[1:02:22] If not, you have to wait three months
[1:02:23] for me to explain you something because
[1:02:26] our question and answer is three months.
[1:02:27] So when I find something in the message,
[1:02:29] automatically I'm sharing with you. The
[1:02:32] quote I sent this morning, I heard it
[1:02:34] last night. I say, "Oh, new things." I
[1:02:36] just say, "There we go. I'm sharing with
[1:02:38] you." So, don't be the one who's gonna
[1:02:40] do two, three weeks before you look at
[1:02:42] the message that was sent and then you
[1:02:44] say, "Oh, I did it." No, no, no, no, no,
[1:02:45] no, no. Please check your message.
[1:02:49] What about if we need a prayer request
[1:02:52] and we send a prayer request and you
[1:02:54] watch the message after 5 days. So, your
[1:02:57] brother is suffering and you don't even
[1:03:00] know that somebody's suffering in
[1:03:01] church. So create a habit. I'm working.
[1:03:04] I work. I pull teeth and go and check
[1:03:06] the message. I pull teeth and go check
[1:03:08] the message. Feel do a feeling and check
[1:03:11] the that's my life because I want to
[1:03:12] know make sure I'm vigilant to see what
[1:03:16] is going on. Who's suffering? Who need
[1:03:18] me before you know it? You catch
[1:03:19] something and you intervene. Amen. And
[1:03:21] you say, "Brother Stephen, how do you do
[1:03:22] this thing?" It's a discipline.
[1:03:25] Jeremiah 29 verse 11. It's a father's
[1:03:29] day. Many restaurant are booked. So,
[1:03:34] uh,
[1:03:36] don't be too quick to go outside. You're
[1:03:37] gonna wait outside in a restaurant for a
[1:03:39] long time before they call you. So, get
[1:03:43] it.
[1:03:45] You can read between the line, right?
[1:03:48] Okay. Praise God.
[1:03:50] You will rush ahead and sit down like
[1:03:52] this. Okay. Uh, Jeremiah 29 verse 11.
[1:03:57] For I know
[1:03:59] the thoughts that I think toward you.
[1:04:01] This is God, says the Lord. Thoughts of
[1:04:04] peace and not of evil to give you an
[1:04:08] expected end. We clear. Let's go to John
[1:04:12] chapter nine.
[1:04:15] Oh, glory to God.
[1:04:18] I was thinking yesterday, I say, how am
[1:04:20] I going to come out from this and go
[1:04:22] back to the calf?
[1:04:25] Amen.
[1:04:26] And then we we surface back up to the
[1:04:29] house of Portifer. Oh God. John chapter
[1:04:32] nine. If you there you can say amen.
[1:04:34] Amen. And as Jesus passed by sister
[1:04:38] that's distinct will adjust again. As
[1:04:41] Jesus passed by he saw a man which was
[1:04:45] blind from birth. You might be seated.
[1:04:49] This man was not blind
[1:04:53] after birth. My subject this morning is
[1:04:58] our life journey through Joseph 5
[1:05:01] garment.
[1:05:02] Amen. Amen. Part 65.
[1:05:07] Amen. Thank God for the theme.
[1:05:12] Our theme today
[1:05:14] is divine purpose.
[1:05:19] Amen. Amen.
[1:05:23] The prayer
[1:05:28] of Bum
[1:05:33] and the prayer
[1:05:37] of Paul.
[1:05:48] Verse one. And as Jesus passed by, he
[1:05:52] saw a man which was blind from his
[1:05:54] birth. There is a reason why the the the
[1:05:57] Bible is telling us he's blind from
[1:06:00] birth. Amen. He came out blind. It's not
[1:06:04] that he was seeing and then something
[1:06:06] happened to him and then he became
[1:06:08] blind. Uh-uh. No, no, no, no. Blind from
[1:06:10] birth. Are we together? Amen.
[1:06:17] All right.
[1:06:19] Uh,
[1:06:21] Brother Tony,
[1:06:23] Sister Christie,
[1:06:25] and uh, Sister D's mother, I don't
[1:06:29] remember her name now, are part of
[1:06:31] Spoken Word Tabernacle.
[1:06:34] They are legally members of Spoken Word
[1:06:37] Tabernacle. I just want to announce to
[1:06:39] you
[1:06:44] [Applause]
[1:06:47] We clear now. So I don't know how those
[1:06:50] wave were coming up. So the boss just
[1:06:53] got me like, "Hey, go ahead and uh clear
[1:06:56] that up." Amen.
[1:06:58] So I'm very sensitive. Amen. Verse two.
[1:07:01] Verse two. And his disciple asked him,
[1:07:05] saying, "Master, who did sin?
[1:07:10] This man." How can the man see he was
[1:07:12] born blind?
[1:07:15] Amen. Do you see some certain things we
[1:07:18] come up with? The man was born blind. So
[1:07:22] how did he sin? So he sin in eternity.
[1:07:28] In the in the loss of his father.
[1:07:32] You're going to come up with new
[1:07:33] doctrines.
[1:07:38] Amen. Who did sin? this man or his
[1:07:41] parent that he was born what? Blind. For
[1:07:46] you to understand why they keep saying
[1:07:48] born blind, born blind, jump to verse uh
[1:07:52] 32 and then we will come back in verse
[1:07:54] three.
[1:07:56] Job to verse 32.
[1:07:59] If you there we can say amen. Amen.
[1:08:03] You there my brother? Amen. All right.
[1:08:05] The Bible say since the world began Was
[1:08:10] he not Was it not heard that any man
[1:08:13] open the eyes of one that was born what?
[1:08:16] Blind. So from the foundation of the
[1:08:19] world according to the Jewish history,
[1:08:22] people were blind and they were their
[1:08:25] eyes got open but no one was born blind
[1:08:32] and then got healed.
[1:08:35] You can be blind after you already were
[1:08:39] seeing things or whatever.
[1:08:42] But to have a born blind to see since
[1:08:46] the foundation of the world, this boy
[1:08:48] was the first case.
[1:08:51] Now your story have changed. Wow. So
[1:08:53] this boy is a special. He's the one that
[1:08:57] broke the record.
[1:08:59] He's the one that broke the circle.
[1:09:03] No one else. In other words, the boy
[1:09:05] could talk about, "Lord, you open the
[1:09:07] eyes of the blind." And somebody would
[1:09:09] say, "But we understand those blind were
[1:09:12] not born blind." But he didn't have any
[1:09:15] scripture he can go grab for somebody
[1:09:18] who was healed before
[1:09:20] and that was born blind. But God started
[1:09:24] somewhere. Amen. So your situation maybe
[1:09:27] no one else ever experience what you're
[1:09:29] experiencing. It doesn't mean you don't
[1:09:32] have a right to ask God for it. Amen.
[1:09:35] God will always start somewhere. Amen.
[1:09:38] Glory to God. We clear now? Amen. We
[1:09:40] understand clear. So let's go back to
[1:09:43] chapter two verse two.
[1:09:46] He said, "And his disciple asked him
[1:09:48] saying, "Master, who did sin? This man
[1:09:52] or his parent that he was born what?"
[1:09:54] Right? Verse three, Jesus answered,
[1:09:57] "Neither has this man seen, nor his
[1:10:01] parent, but
[1:10:05] that the work of God should be made
[1:10:09] what? Manifest in him." I know you will
[1:10:12] have a hard time answering me in this
[1:10:14] question. So, who was the origin of this
[1:10:17] problem?
[1:10:19] God. Amen. Amen.
[1:10:24] Amen.
[1:10:25] God just answer that this boy, it's not
[1:10:29] about sin.
[1:10:31] It's not about his parents sin. It's not
[1:10:33] about his sin. But in other word, what
[1:10:36] the boy is suffering, follow me. If I
[1:10:39] can get where I'm trying to get, has
[1:10:41] nothing to do with what the boy did or
[1:10:45] what the family did. It's all in the
[1:10:48] hand of God.
[1:10:50] Amen. Amen. So you mean God put a
[1:10:54] sickness on this boy? Push the brake.
[1:11:01] Please, let's read. I don't I don't want
[1:11:03] that. Look. Uh let's read. Jesus
[1:11:06] answered, "Neither has this father what?
[1:11:09] Don't blame his parent." Amen. Amen.
[1:11:14] Neither has this man sin nor his wife.
[1:11:16] His parents. But that the works of the
[1:11:20] of God should be made manifest in what?
[1:11:23] So who should we blame? God.
[1:11:31] Some of you are
[1:11:34] this sickness
[1:11:38] was God's purpose.
[1:11:41] Amen.
[1:11:44] So that God can use this sickness.
[1:11:48] [Applause]
[1:11:50] to glorify himself.
[1:11:56] Did you get it from your father? No.
[1:12:02] So why did God pick me to be the one
[1:12:04] suffering?
[1:12:06] Jesus. Yes, sir. Why did he let
[1:12:09] everybody else see?
[1:12:13] And according to the election when the
[1:12:15] when the pool of people were going on
[1:12:17] God
[1:12:19] [Applause]
[1:12:21] only me please take that one. Ah God
[1:12:23] saying
[1:12:27] hallelujah. No no no no no. Look at the
[1:12:29] other one. Lord in I mean in the future
[1:12:31] he will cause you trouble. Say you
[1:12:34] why me?
[1:12:37] Lord. What is the purpose behind this?
[1:12:40] What are you trying to achieve with
[1:12:42] this?
[1:12:45] Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. And God
[1:12:47] took him and put him
[1:12:50] start praying.
[1:12:54] Father, in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:12:56] Lord, touch this boy.
[1:12:59] Amen. There is a time.
[1:13:03] Amen. Amen. Ah, come on. Ah.
[1:13:11] Let's start our sermon because the way
[1:13:13] you moving I told you to be good. The
[1:13:15] Bible says in the book of Ecclesiastes
[1:13:18] chapter 3 verse one to everything there
[1:13:21] is water season and a water a time to
[1:13:24] every water purpose under the heaven. So
[1:13:26] we understand that our prayer answer
[1:13:29] goes with those three elements. Amen. We
[1:13:32] understand that clearly now. It goes
[1:13:34] with a season. It goes with the time and
[1:13:36] it goes with what? The purpose God knew
[1:13:39] there will come a time yesterday that
[1:13:42] this boy will be healed
[1:13:45] and when the time come God made it that
[1:13:49] Jesus have to pass that's it brother by
[1:13:53] that avenue
[1:13:55] that's right brother
[1:13:58] why didn't Jesus see this boy all along
[1:14:01] because he was not the time yet
[1:14:03] he was not the season yet that's it are
[1:14:07] we together. But when the time comes,
[1:14:09] where was the devil? Come on, brother.
[1:14:13] Amen. To make this boy sick and say,
[1:14:16] "Stay at home."
[1:14:18] Where was the devil? The devil got so
[1:14:21] used
[1:14:22] to him being begging and the devil say,
[1:14:25] "You know what? That one already have a
[1:14:27] complex." That's right. Leave him there.
[1:14:31] And the boy got used to enjoy his life
[1:14:36] with infirmity.
[1:14:38] Lord,
[1:14:41] amen.
[1:14:44] Thank you, Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:14:47] In other words, that boy learned to
[1:14:49] smile even though he's blind. That's
[1:14:52] right.
[1:14:54] Because we think we only smile when we
[1:14:56] have eyes. But that one learn to smile
[1:14:59] when he doesn't have eyes. In other
[1:15:02] words, you don't know when he's really
[1:15:03] suffering. Right. That's right.
[1:15:07] Because his joy now doesn't depend on
[1:15:11] what you call joy.
[1:15:14] He doesn't even see your world. He's
[1:15:17] enjoying himself in his own world.
[1:15:21] He developed a life of his own.
[1:15:27] In other words, the definition of
[1:15:29] happiness to you is different than the
[1:15:32] the definition of happiness to that boy.
[1:15:36] That boy going and begging because he
[1:15:38] was a beggar. That's what the Bible say.
[1:15:40] You know that. The Bible say that was
[1:15:43] the boy that was blind and begging.
[1:15:44] That's what the scripture say. So that
[1:15:46] boy when he begs and they give him a
[1:15:49] penny, he's so happy,
[1:15:52] more happy than you who have two eyes.
[1:15:56] Wow.
[1:15:58] We clear my friend. Amen. We clear my
[1:16:00] friend. Amen. So when we dealing with
[1:16:03] our prayer on earth right here, we find
[1:16:06] that our prayer goes with time. It goes
[1:16:09] with season and it also goes with
[1:16:11] purpose under heaven. We clear and this
[1:16:15] is the quote that we have been stuck for
[1:16:17] probably couple month right here.
[1:16:20] Brother Brham says here that I ask him
[1:16:22] God for something. Sometime God shake
[1:16:26] his hand and he says what? No. So God
[1:16:28] doesn't say no all the time. Amen.
[1:16:32] Sometime it's sometime because sometime
[1:16:35] he says yes. The problem is the no. We
[1:16:39] clear. Brother Brandham say I just
[1:16:41] rejoice so much about that as I can if
[1:16:44] he says what? Yes. Brother Brandham said
[1:16:47] because we ought to we always ought to
[1:16:49] ask that will be done because the nos if
[1:16:53] that is his will
[1:16:55] it's a whole lot better than his yeses
[1:16:58] if it's his will to do it. In other word
[1:17:01] when the no of God is the will of God
[1:17:04] for your life that no is far better than
[1:17:08] if God would have say yes because the
[1:17:12] yes at that time will be God's
[1:17:14] permissive will. That's right.
[1:17:19] God answers prayer.
[1:17:22] Every prayer God answers. He answer it
[1:17:25] by a yes or by a no. Amen. But if God
[1:17:31] come to the place to says no.
[1:17:35] This no is better than the yes. This yes
[1:17:39] is different than this yes. Amen.
[1:17:44] Are we together? Amen. This yes is
[1:17:46] according to the will of God. But this
[1:17:49] yes is something contrary to the will of
[1:17:52] God. That's right. That's why the no is
[1:17:54] better than the yes. That's right. Are
[1:17:57] we together? And if you push too hard,
[1:18:00] God will give you yes.
[1:18:02] Like Hezekiah
[1:18:05] and then you enter the permissive will
[1:18:07] of God and not his perfect will. Amen.
[1:18:13] Are we together? Amen. The point here is
[1:18:16] we want to make sure we are in his will.
[1:18:19] Amen. That's right. That's the key right
[1:18:22] there. Amen. Why? Because his will goes
[1:18:27] with his purpose.
[1:18:31] According to Ephesians 1, we will leave
[1:18:33] the airport soon, my friend. According
[1:18:35] to Ephesians 1:1, the Bible say, "In
[1:18:39] whom also we have obtained inheritance,
[1:18:42] being predestinated according to the
[1:18:45] purpose of him who does what?" Who
[1:18:47] workketh all things after the counsel of
[1:18:50] what? His own will. So the will of God
[1:18:52] is connected to his purpose. Amen. We
[1:18:55] clear on that one. And the purpose of
[1:18:58] God is powerful.
[1:19:00] Amen. Amen. Amen. In other word, because
[1:19:04] there is nothing that will beat God
[1:19:06] purpose. We already went through that.
[1:19:08] And the Bible says that God will
[1:19:10] orchestrate everything. He will work
[1:19:12] everything in your life to make sure it
[1:19:15] matches his purpose. So the purpose of
[1:19:18] God is powerful. There is no demon, no
[1:19:21] sickness, nothing will stop you from the
[1:19:23] purpose of God. Are we together? And the
[1:19:26] purpose of God is the best idea of God
[1:19:30] for you. Amen.
[1:19:33] Let me start it again. My friend, the
[1:19:36] purpose of God is the best idea God have
[1:19:39] for you.
[1:19:41] God purpose for your life is always the
[1:19:44] best.
[1:19:48] The Lord gave me this quote when I was
[1:19:50] in the office, so I was not able to add
[1:19:53] it up here, but I'm going to read it.
[1:19:54] It's in uh the message, Christ is
[1:19:57] revealed in his own word. In 1965 on
[1:20:01] August the 22nd in the morning,
[1:20:04] paragraph 36, brother Brham says this.
[1:20:08] And there was a certain man, a certain
[1:20:11] person said to me, they talked to
[1:20:13] brother Brandham. He says, I believe you
[1:20:16] are an antichrist.
[1:20:19] My God. Wow. Are we together?
[1:20:23] Are we together? Amen. Verse 37. Brother
[1:20:26] Brandham replied. Brother Brandham say I
[1:20:28] said if thou will be pleasing to my
[1:20:32] Lord. Remember Esther Brother Brham say
[1:20:36] if thou will be pleasing to my Lord that
[1:20:39] is what I want to be.
[1:20:44] [Laughter]
[1:20:47] I want to be whatever he want me to be.
[1:20:52] Amen. Brother Brandham say if God
[1:20:55] purpose for me to be an antichrist I
[1:20:57] will take it.
[1:21:00] Because his decision is the best.
[1:21:08] It's a t-bone steak with a bone in the
[1:21:11] middle. Are we together? Brother say I
[1:21:15] love him and if he should cast me into
[1:21:18] hell
[1:21:20] I still will love him.
[1:21:24] If I go with the same spirit I have now,
[1:21:28] he looked at me kind of strange
[1:21:34] because Job said, "Though he slay me,
[1:21:38] yet I trust me."
[1:21:41] That's why Shadrach and Mishak Abenego
[1:21:43] say even if he doesn't deliver us if we
[1:21:46] were predestinated to be burned in the
[1:21:49] stake to be eaten by a lion we will take
[1:21:53] it because his purpose is the best.
[1:21:56] Amen. I hope we are together. Amen.
[1:22:01] Are we together? Amen. Brother Brandham
[1:22:03] continue. He says this. Therefore,
[1:22:07] whatever the will of God is, let God's
[1:22:10] will be done. Amen. Whether I am happy
[1:22:15] with it or not,
[1:22:17] help me Lord. Amen.
[1:22:21] Amen. If you don't mind, I will put this
[1:22:23] in the church group chat. Brother Pam
[1:22:25] say whether I'm happy with it or not,
[1:22:28] let his will be done. Amen. Because when
[1:22:32] Jesus was looking at the cross, he
[1:22:34] almost wanted to dodge. But when Jesus
[1:22:37] saw the joy that was before Jesus
[1:22:40] changed his mind, say, "Nevertheless,
[1:22:43] not my will." Because after the cross
[1:22:47] come exaltation. After the cross, Jesus
[1:22:50] sat at the right hand. After the cross,
[1:22:53] Jesus received a name that is above
[1:22:55] every name. Amen.
[1:22:57] After the cross, he can go get the book
[1:23:00] of redemption. After the cross, the
[1:23:02] seals can be all broken. After the
[1:23:05] cross, he can save me and you. After the
[1:23:08] cross, God can baptize human being.
[1:23:11] After the cross, there is no devil that
[1:23:14] can play again with us. After the cross,
[1:23:17] death has been conquered. The grave has
[1:23:20] been conquered. So when he look at the
[1:23:23] joy before he say let me take it because
[1:23:27] there is a purpose.
[1:23:30] Amen.
[1:23:34] Are we together? Are we together? We are
[1:23:37] training you. Yes sir. The Bible says
[1:23:40] when he look at the joy before he
[1:23:43] despised the shame. That's what the
[1:23:46] Bible say because the shame was they
[1:23:48] going to put him naked.
[1:23:50] So the devil was showing him like I'm
[1:23:53] going to post you on Facebook and I'm
[1:23:55] going to post you naked. But when Jesus
[1:23:58] look at the joy, he said go ahead and
[1:24:00] put the posting because what I'm going
[1:24:03] to receive is more than that.
[1:24:07] Go ahead and destroy whatever you want
[1:24:09] to destroy. In other words, this Siri
[1:24:13] help you bring all your trial to
[1:24:16] nothing.
[1:24:19] Exactly right.
[1:24:22] I hope we are together. Amen. Do you
[1:24:25] know the word despise means what?
[1:24:28] It's disgusting something.
[1:24:31] So the demon of shame came and say
[1:24:36] look what I'm going to do to you. When
[1:24:39] Jesus look at the picture, he say
[1:24:43] amen. In other words, go ahead and do
[1:24:45] it.
[1:24:47] Go ahead and do it. I don't even have
[1:24:49] time to listen to you because what is
[1:24:51] coming before the whole earth will
[1:24:54] belong to me. Every kingdom will be
[1:24:57] mine. I'm going to bring everything back
[1:25:00] to order. The new Jerusalem sir, the new
[1:25:04] heaven and earth, the 144,000. Paul,
[1:25:07] brother, Brandham, all of that, all of
[1:25:09] us were locked up right there.
[1:25:12] [Music]
[1:25:15] And if Jesus never went to the cross, he
[1:25:19] would not have been peace. That's it,
[1:25:21] brother. But he was the second Adam, so
[1:25:24] it was important for him to be peace so
[1:25:26] we can come out.
[1:25:29] [Applause]
[1:25:31] [Music]
[1:25:33] In other words, the devil was trying to
[1:25:35] block his own wife. Amen. That's right.
[1:25:38] [Applause]
[1:25:40] Jesus say, "I cannot be myself." God is
[1:25:43] male and female. I need my wife out so I
[1:25:47] can fellowship with her. But the only
[1:25:49] way to bring my wife out, the only way
[1:25:52] to receive my husband or my wife, I need
[1:25:55] to go through the cross.
[1:25:58] [Music]
[1:25:59] [Applause]
[1:26:01] The only way to receive the marriage of
[1:26:03] the lamb, his marriage was connected to
[1:26:07] Calvary. Without Calvary, no marriage.
[1:26:12] I hope we are together my friend.
[1:26:16] Brother Brown, I'm saying
[1:26:19] therefore whatever the will of God is,
[1:26:23] let God's will be done. Whether I am
[1:26:26] happy with it or not, I want to live so
[1:26:30] he will be pleased with what I do.
[1:26:34] Therefore, check your objective. Yes,
[1:26:36] Lord. Amen. And your motive by that you
[1:26:40] know whether you love God or not what if
[1:26:44] he say you serve me if I'm going to cast
[1:26:47] you to hell I love him anyhow.
[1:26:51] [Music]
[1:26:53] Are we together? So when we pray we
[1:26:56] always want to be like Esther. We want
[1:26:59] the will of God to be done for our life.
[1:27:01] Amen. Why is it important for the will
[1:27:04] of God? The Bible says in Philippian 4:E
[1:27:08] 19 that but my God shall do what? Supply
[1:27:13] supply what? All your need. Some need
[1:27:16] all your need.
[1:27:19] But God will supply our water. All your
[1:27:21] need. I know you read this so much and
[1:27:23] you don't even have faith about this
[1:27:25] because of your trial.
[1:27:27] You say it verbally, but in your heart
[1:27:29] you say, "I'm just I know the Lord will
[1:27:31] provide all my need, but in your heart,
[1:27:33] I'm still struggling.
[1:27:36] [Laughter]
[1:27:38] My God shall supply all your need." How?
[1:27:41] According to his riches and glory by
[1:27:44] Christ Jesus. If you notice the word
[1:27:47] used there is the need.
[1:27:50] Are we together? And brother Brandham
[1:27:52] say I'm so glad that he supplier our
[1:27:56] what? Every need. He promised he will do
[1:27:59] that. That's the promise right there.
[1:28:02] Now he never promised that he will
[1:28:04] supply our want.
[1:28:14] But he was our what that he will supply.
[1:28:18] And I'm so glad of that because there is
[1:28:21] many time that we want things that is
[1:28:24] not good for us.
[1:28:27] [Music]
[1:28:32] My friend, did you sleep good today? Let
[1:28:34] me read it again. My friend, brother
[1:28:36] Brandham said, "God never promised that
[1:28:39] he will supply your want."
[1:28:43] Amen. But he says he will supply our
[1:28:46] what? Our needs. And I'm so glad that of
[1:28:49] that because there are many times that
[1:28:51] we want things that are not good for us.
[1:28:54] Amen. That's why his nose are better.
[1:28:59] Amen. There is a difference between a
[1:29:03] need and a want.
[1:29:09] A need is what is essential.
[1:29:13] What is necessary?
[1:29:16] Bare necessity.
[1:29:19] What is essential for your survival?
[1:29:23] Having food is a need.
[1:29:26] Having clothes is a need. But a want is
[1:29:30] something we need to improve our quality
[1:29:33] of life. Time right there, brother.
[1:29:36] Amen. You can have a phone and you can
[1:29:40] also have a phone.
[1:29:43] Your one phone might be a need, but
[1:29:46] another phone is a want
[1:29:50] because you're not really looking for a
[1:29:52] phone, but you're looking for a certain
[1:29:55] brand to show off. Your phone is no
[1:29:59] longer a need. It become a want. And if
[1:30:02] that want has a wrong objective, God
[1:30:05] won't give it to you.
[1:30:08] I hope we are together my friend. Amen.
[1:30:15] Let me continue. Brother Brandham says
[1:30:17] this in the message the world is falling
[1:30:19] apart. He said God promised to do what?
[1:30:23] Supply our needs, not our wants.
[1:30:26] We are always wanting something.
[1:30:30] The want means your desires.
[1:30:34] I'm getting somewhere, my friend. He
[1:30:36] says we are always wanting for
[1:30:38] something. Amen. Amen. If a 2 years old
[1:30:41] come and say Lord give me a wife, what
[1:30:44] is he going to do with a wife?
[1:30:51] It's a want.
[1:30:53] But it's not a need. But when he grows
[1:30:56] up,
[1:30:58] hallelujah. When it's time, when it's
[1:31:02] the season, when he grows up, do you
[1:31:05] follow me? The want will be in morph
[1:31:09] transform into the need.
[1:31:13] [Music]
[1:31:14] Amen. Brother says this. He says we are
[1:31:19] always wanting something, but we want it
[1:31:22] how? In our own way. You say, well, I
[1:31:24] want that. Yeah. Well, Lord, send us
[1:31:27] this and send us that. God knows our
[1:31:30] needs.
[1:31:32] That is water. Exactly. Right. He knows
[1:31:35] water. Our need. What if your little boy
[1:31:38] seen you shaving with a straight razor
[1:31:42] and he say, "Daddy, I want that razor."
[1:31:45] You know better than to give that child
[1:31:47] a what? That razor to begin with. He
[1:31:50] doesn't even have a bill.
[1:31:54] [Applause]
[1:31:55] So what is the purpose of a razor? Amen.
[1:31:58] Lord, I want you to give me a jet plane.
[1:32:02] What are you going to do with a jet
[1:32:03] plane?
[1:32:06] You will put it on Instagram so
[1:32:08] everybody knows. God won't give it to
[1:32:11] you. It is not a need. It is a want. Are
[1:32:16] we together? Are we together? Amen. But
[1:32:19] if you become a multi- big businessman
[1:32:23] that you need to travel back and forth
[1:32:25] and you say, "God, I have a
[1:32:27] multi-billion business. I need the jets.
[1:32:30] I won't wait at the airport." Then that
[1:32:32] point, correct?
[1:32:35] It is no longer a want. It become a
[1:32:38] necessity based on where you are with
[1:32:41] God. Amen. The razor is important based
[1:32:46] on the edge. Amen. Amen. If you reach
[1:32:49] the normal age, then God can give you
[1:32:51] the result. Amen. But if you don't,
[1:32:56] if your Christian life reach a certain
[1:32:59] level, then God will give you what you
[1:33:01] want. But if your life is not
[1:33:04] straightened first yet, God cannot give
[1:33:07] you certain things because they will
[1:33:10] take you back to the world.
[1:33:12] [Music]
[1:33:14] Amen.
[1:33:16] Father, give me $2 million. You don't
[1:33:19] even come to church.
[1:33:21] You don't even pray.
[1:33:23] You are even struggling with sir. And if
[1:33:26] God give you $2 million, what are you
[1:33:28] going to do with it? We will see you. I
[1:33:32] mean, total lost on the highway. You
[1:33:34] will become the best big shot. But if we
[1:33:37] need a fellowship hall,
[1:33:40] if we need a building and it's a
[1:33:43] necessity for the church to have it at
[1:33:46] that point where God will supply his
[1:33:50] need according to his riches of glory
[1:33:54] because we need it.
[1:33:57] Yes, he will. Are we together? So when
[1:34:01] you pray, check your motives.
[1:34:04] Check your objective. What I'm asking
[1:34:06] now, do I really need it? If you need
[1:34:09] it, stick your faith right there. Then
[1:34:11] God is under obligation to give it to
[1:34:14] you.
[1:34:15] [Applause]
[1:34:17] Are we together? Are we together?
[1:34:21] Brother Brandham say you know better
[1:34:23] than that. Well, what if daddy what if
[1:34:27] he say daddy I seen you doing it. Well,
[1:34:30] that is what different. You are an
[1:34:32] adult. You know how to use the what? the
[1:34:34] razor. You are an adult. You accumulated
[1:34:37] the what? Intelligence to know how to
[1:34:40] use the razor. Then God will give it to
[1:34:43] you because in your beard, in your in
[1:34:45] your chin right here, we can see beard
[1:34:47] coming up. Then God say it is time for
[1:34:50] him to have a razor. You want a razor,
[1:34:52] you don't have any beard.
[1:34:55] And God knows exactly what's going to
[1:34:57] happen. Yes, sir. So try to shave
[1:34:59] without having a beard with a razor.
[1:35:01] Then it's going to be a disaster. Amen.
[1:35:03] Was it good thing? And they will call
[1:35:05] your father a stupid man. So God doesn't
[1:35:08] want to be called stupid.
[1:35:11] God want to be called responsible. So
[1:35:13] God knows your need and the time
[1:35:16] necessary and appropriate time and
[1:35:19] season to give you what you want. Are we
[1:35:22] together? Amen. Are we together? Amen.
[1:35:24] Are we together? Amen. So it's always
[1:35:27] good to pray according to the will of
[1:35:30] God. according to the purpose of God. In
[1:35:33] other words, if God would have answered
[1:35:37] all our prayer, we say yes, it will be a
[1:35:41] disaster.
[1:35:43] Lord, we will see horses flying
[1:35:47] because a child say Lord I want to see a
[1:35:50] flying horse
[1:35:53] and God created a flying horse and
[1:35:56] somebody will come there he say I heard
[1:35:58] about dinosaur all the time father can
[1:36:00] you create one so we can see and
[1:36:02] tomorrow we all are running away because
[1:36:04] dinosaur are chasing people so if God
[1:36:07] will answer all our prayer it will be a
[1:36:10] disaster
[1:36:12] that's Why the nose of God are better?
[1:36:15] [Music]
[1:36:22] Are we together? When God says no, it's
[1:36:25] always a blessing.
[1:36:29] In disgustment,
[1:36:32] the no of God bring you blessing. Amen.
[1:36:38] [Applause]
[1:36:39] [Music]
[1:36:41] I'm going to say it again. I know some
[1:36:43] of you are struggling. Den know God for
[1:36:46] your life is actually an opportunity for
[1:36:49] God to bless you.
[1:36:52] [Music]
[1:36:57] Open your Bible.
[1:36:59] I told you to do good. Very good. But
[1:37:03] you still lose.
[1:37:05] slowing me down. Let's go to number 22.
[1:37:09] Let's look at the know of God.
[1:37:15] Uh glory to God.
[1:37:19] A child will see people with a cell
[1:37:21] phone and he will come, he say, "Mama,
[1:37:23] can I have a cell phone, too?"
[1:37:26] It's a want.
[1:37:30] He's he's 5 years old. What is he going
[1:37:32] to do with a cell phone?
[1:37:33] something. You leave him on YouTube, he
[1:37:35] start clicking this, click this, and
[1:37:37] finally and the devil is waiting for him
[1:37:39] on YouTube. Yes, he is. It's a want.
[1:37:43] It's not needed. Amen. Amen. That's
[1:37:47] true, brother. Amen. When you in high
[1:37:49] school, you begin to check on your
[1:37:51] siblings and then they say you need a
[1:37:53] cell phone. Now it's a need. Correct.
[1:37:57] That's exactly the truth. All my friend
[1:37:59] have cell phone. What are they doing on
[1:38:01] cell phone? in pornography.
[1:38:07] Are we together?
[1:38:09] Ah, let's go to number 22. If you there,
[1:38:12] you can say amen. Let's soar a little
[1:38:14] bit with this and see the nose of God.
[1:38:17] If you do good here, then we soar. Amen.
[1:38:20] The Bible says, "And the children of
[1:38:22] Israel set forward and pitch in the
[1:38:25] plains of Moab on this side of on this
[1:38:29] side Jordan on this side Jordan by the
[1:38:33] river by uh by Jericho." Amen. And
[1:38:37] Beacon
[1:38:41] of Zippo saw all that Israel has done to
[1:38:45] the Amorite.
[1:38:46] Now before this thing started we need to
[1:38:51] understand something here God before he
[1:38:54] came closer to Moab
[1:38:57] now Moab were not hidden
[1:39:00] they were the children of Lot and
[1:39:03] brother Brandham say they worshiped the
[1:39:05] same God of Israel that's why they had a
[1:39:09] prophet by the name of Bam who was
[1:39:11] talking to God the same way God was
[1:39:14] talking to Moses
[1:39:16] Bam was a prophet. Moses was a prophet.
[1:39:19] And God would talk to Moses. And when
[1:39:21] Balam call God, God will go also and
[1:39:24] talk to Bum.
[1:39:26] Are we together? So they were not
[1:39:28] hidden. My friend, are we together? Now
[1:39:32] before Israel reached Moab, God told
[1:39:36] Israel this. He says in the book of
[1:39:38] Deuteronomy 2:9, "And the Lord say unto
[1:39:42] me, distress not Moabitete,
[1:39:46] neither content with them where in
[1:39:48] battle, for I would not give thee of
[1:39:51] their land for a possession, because I
[1:39:54] have given R unto the children of Lot
[1:39:57] for a what? Possession." So God already
[1:40:00] forbade Israel not to engage in a war
[1:40:05] with Moab because Moab was considered a
[1:40:07] brother. That's right. He say Moab
[1:40:11] already received a possession that I
[1:40:13] gave it to him. So that land doesn't
[1:40:15] belong to you. So when Israel is
[1:40:18] approaching, Israel was not approaching
[1:40:20] Moab for war.
[1:40:23] We clear on that one. Amen. But when
[1:40:26] Israel arrived on Moab,
[1:40:29] Uhhuh. look at how Moab is reacting.
[1:40:32] Uhhuh. Chapter verse two. And Beacon of
[1:40:36] Zipper saw all that Israel has done to
[1:40:39] the Amorite.
[1:40:41] And Moab was so afraid, not knowing
[1:40:45] Israel already got a commandment.
[1:40:48] So the way they killed the Amorite, they
[1:40:50] will destroy it. No, no, no. You were
[1:40:51] not part of that purpose.
[1:40:54] Are we together? The Bible says because
[1:40:58] they were very many because they were
[1:41:00] many and Moab was distressed because of
[1:41:03] the children of Israel. Are we together?
[1:41:05] Amen. So they themselves caused their
[1:41:08] own problem.
[1:41:10] Israel was not coming for fight. They
[1:41:12] were just afraid and they say you know
[1:41:14] what we need to prepare to attack.
[1:41:17] Israel was not attacking. I'm going
[1:41:20] somewhere. It is a fight you didn't
[1:41:22] start.
[1:41:24] Right. Right. I'm going somewhere. You
[1:41:27] didn't start. It was somebody who have
[1:41:29] been intimidating
[1:41:31] by by what God is doing in your life.
[1:41:37] God is accomplishing so many things in
[1:41:39] your life and then somebody begin to get
[1:41:42] scared. God is accomplishing so many
[1:41:46] things in the church and it cause a
[1:41:48] problem with another church. Amen. Amen.
[1:41:52] Amen. Are we together? But you didn't do
[1:41:55] anything. You were just leaving your
[1:41:58] life and somebody else became jealous
[1:42:02] that ah why is going you didn't start
[1:42:04] the fight to begin with. Are you
[1:42:07] following me? I'm trying to show you the
[1:42:09] nose of God. Why is he good for you? Are
[1:42:12] we together? Verse four. And Moab said
[1:42:15] to the elder of Midian, "Now shall this
[1:42:19] company leak up all uh uh that uh lick
[1:42:23] up all that are around us, as the ox
[1:42:26] leak up the grass of the field." And
[1:42:28] Bellac the son of Zippo was king of the
[1:42:31] Moabat at that time. Verse 5, he sent
[1:42:36] messenger therefore to Bellam the son of
[1:42:39] Pior
[1:42:41] to Pet which is by the river of the land
[1:42:44] of the children of his people to call
[1:42:46] him saying behold there is a people come
[1:42:51] out of Egypt. God delivered them from
[1:42:53] the world. Amen. Behold they cover the
[1:42:56] face of the earth. There are so many.
[1:42:59] They are growing so many. They are
[1:43:01] prospering and they bad opposite to me.
[1:43:05] They came to pitch the revival right
[1:43:08] close to me.
[1:43:10] Amen. I'm already the one in this area.
[1:43:15] They come on my spot.
[1:43:19] Amen.
[1:43:22] Amen. Verse six. Come now, therefore, I
[1:43:26] pray you curse me this people.
[1:43:31] Let's continue my friend for they are
[1:43:34] too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall
[1:43:37] prevail that we may smite them. In other
[1:43:40] words, the curse will neutralize Israel.
[1:43:43] So when Israel engage in the battle,
[1:43:46] they will lose the battle because they
[1:43:47] are fighting under a curse. Follow me my
[1:43:50] friend. He says, "Perhaps I shall
[1:43:52] prevail that we may smite them and that
[1:43:55] I may drive them out of the land."
[1:43:57] Israel was only passing by. For I know
[1:44:01] that he whom you bless. What a gift is
[1:44:06] how? Blessed.
[1:44:08] And he whom you curse is how? Curse. So
[1:44:11] whatever comes from the mouth of Bam
[1:44:14] happened.
[1:44:18] If Bam say you curse, forget it. It's
[1:44:20] going to happen. If he say you bless,
[1:44:22] it's going to happen. And they took such
[1:44:25] a prophet
[1:44:27] to come against Israel. Follow me my
[1:44:30] friend. Why the nose of God is a
[1:44:32] blessing for your life. Are we together?
[1:44:35] Amen. Are we together? Amen. Okay. The
[1:44:38] Bible says, the Bible says in verse uh
[1:44:41] 7, and the elders of Moab and the elders
[1:44:44] of Midian departed with the reward of
[1:44:47] divination in their hand. In other
[1:44:50] words, they took some money. Amen. And
[1:44:53] they came like a denomination. You go to
[1:44:56] the prophet to prophesy for you for
[1:44:59] $1,000. So they are prophecy of $1,000,
[1:45:02] prophecy of $200. I've seen that in
[1:45:05] denomination.
[1:45:06] It become like a divination. They're
[1:45:09] using God as a divination.
[1:45:12] Amen. Are we together? And then in the
[1:45:14] and they came to Bam and spoke to him
[1:45:17] the words of Baleac. Verse eight. And he
[1:45:20] said to them, "Lord, here this night,
[1:45:23] and I will bring you word again, as the
[1:45:26] Lord shall speak to me." And the princes
[1:45:28] of Moab abboard with Bam.
[1:45:31] So Bellam went and pray.
[1:45:35] Look at the prayer. This man is gifted,
[1:45:37] my friend. And God came down.
[1:45:42] Follow me, my friend. Verse N. And God
[1:45:45] came to Bum,
[1:45:47] not Moses, right? No. Amen. I don't know
[1:45:52] if you're understanding me. Moses is
[1:45:54] with the camp of Israel.
[1:45:57] But the camp of Moab have also a
[1:46:00] prophet. But God is dealing with both.
[1:46:04] And brother Brandham say Moab represent
[1:46:07] denomination.
[1:46:10] So do not be intimidating
[1:46:12] when denomination
[1:46:15] have miracle. Amen.
[1:46:18] I don't know if we are together.
[1:46:22] Amen. That's why some of message
[1:46:25] believer are shook up and they begin to
[1:46:28] listen to denominational preacher
[1:46:30] because over there they are really
[1:46:32] having revival. It is the same God but
[1:46:36] the covenant are different.
[1:46:39] They are Moab but we are Israel. We are
[1:46:43] the chosen one.
[1:46:46] I hope you understanding me. Amen. You
[1:46:49] who get on YouTube
[1:46:52] and are ready to miss church here to go
[1:46:55] to a denominational church for a gift of
[1:46:59] healing
[1:47:00] and then you come back to the message
[1:47:02] church.
[1:47:04] You're going to go under Bam. We want to
[1:47:07] stay under Moses.
[1:47:11] [Applause]
[1:47:14] As Moses has two son, so also I gave you
[1:47:19] two son. Our modern Moses is William
[1:47:22] May.
[1:47:26] We want to stay under the prophet. Amen.
[1:47:29] Amen.
[1:47:31] Brother Steven, do they have miracle of
[1:47:34] counsel? Because the Bible say many will
[1:47:37] come in that day and say Lord Lord have
[1:47:40] we not prophesy in your name? Have we
[1:47:43] not cast our devil in your name? And God
[1:47:45] will say I never knew you. But it was
[1:47:48] God doing that. But he never have a
[1:47:52] personal intimate
[1:47:54] relationship.
[1:47:56] Adam knew Eve. In other words, you are
[1:47:59] not my wife.
[1:48:07] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[1:48:10] Amen. We are talking about the prayer of
[1:48:12] Bumus.
[1:48:16] Are we together? Amen. It's a shame how
[1:48:19] you see message believer looking. Oh,
[1:48:21] they are powerful. They having revival.
[1:48:24] They having revival with women wearing
[1:48:27] short dresses. Women showing their
[1:48:30] bodies. That's not God.
[1:48:34] That is denomination.
[1:48:36] There is a difference between Moab and
[1:48:39] Israel. Over there, the women are loose.
[1:48:42] Over here, the women are noble. They are
[1:48:45] respectable. They are honorable people.
[1:48:48] They are people we treat with dignity.
[1:48:52] [Music]
[1:48:58] Amen. Amen.
[1:49:01] Wonderful. Sister Zadi got a voice.
[1:49:04] Sister Yok got a voice. Brother Angelo
[1:49:07] got a voice. They also have voices.
[1:49:11] And sometime they can even outshine you.
[1:49:14] But look at the way they dress. The P
[1:49:18] that are cut like this.
[1:49:22] Singing for the Lord.
[1:49:25] Are we together? Are we together? Amen.
[1:49:28] Are we together? Amen. And then they got
[1:49:31] jealous of us.
[1:49:35] They say this brandite
[1:49:38] need to be wiped away.
[1:49:41] We are not brandite. We are true
[1:49:44] Christians. True Christian following
[1:49:46] brother Brham as he show us Jesus
[1:49:49] Christ.
[1:49:55] Because Paul say follow me as I follow
[1:49:59] Christ. We are following brother
[1:50:01] Brandham because brother Brandham point
[1:50:03] us to Jesus Christ.
[1:50:08] Lord
[1:50:10] [Applause]
[1:50:11] are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[1:50:14] Amen. Are we together? Amen. And brother
[1:50:16] say every time the two meet there is a
[1:50:19] clash.
[1:50:24] Amen.
[1:50:26] I can even enter deeper even among
[1:50:30] message believer among message churches.
[1:50:33] We have moreites.
[1:50:40] [Applause]
[1:50:44] Are we together? Not everybody that is
[1:50:47] in the message is in the message.
[1:50:51] [Applause]
[1:50:54] Not everybody that is in among the
[1:50:57] message rank is in the message. Only the
[1:51:00] bride is in the message. Amen.
[1:51:04] Are we together? Are we together? Where
[1:51:07] are we at, my friend?
[1:51:10] Hallelujah. You see the prayer of bum.
[1:51:13] Verse seven. Verse seven. Verse seven.
[1:51:16] No, verse eight. Verse eight. And he
[1:51:20] said to them, "Lord, right?" Verse 9,
[1:51:24] "And God came to Bum and said,
[1:51:28] "Oh, a denominational preacher preacher
[1:51:31] pray. He told you God spoke to me." Of
[1:51:33] course,
[1:51:36] I don't have any problem. I won't say
[1:51:38] you're not God. No, God can speak to
[1:51:40] you. But God also speak to me. It's a
[1:51:43] matter of which camp are you.
[1:51:48] Are we together? Church, I'm helping
[1:51:50] you. Especially young people. Are we
[1:51:52] together? Don't be intimidated, my
[1:51:54] friend. He says, "And God came to Bellam
[1:51:58] and say, what man are these with you?"
[1:52:02] And Bam said to God, "Belac the son of
[1:52:04] Zippo, king of Moab, has sent me, has
[1:52:07] sent to me, saying, Behold, there is a
[1:52:10] people come out of Egypt, which cover
[1:52:12] the face of the earth. Come now, curse
[1:52:15] me them. Perhaps I shall be able to
[1:52:18] overcome them and drive them out. And
[1:52:20] God said to Bam. So Bam brought the
[1:52:24] petition.
[1:52:26] He gave the prayer request. The prayer
[1:52:28] request came from Balam uh from Bailac.
[1:52:32] And he was given to the preacher and the
[1:52:34] preacher went to God and say we have a
[1:52:36] prayer request. God say what is the
[1:52:38] prayer request? We want you to curse
[1:52:40] Israel.
[1:52:43] Can I continue? So, do you want Oh, God
[1:52:45] answer every prayer.
[1:52:49] Uh-oh. Come on. God answer how many
[1:52:51] prayer? Every prayer. Do you want that
[1:52:53] prayer to be answered by yes or no?
[1:52:58] Now you begin to understand.
[1:53:01] Amen. Come on, man. You want God to say
[1:53:04] yes to that prayer?
[1:53:09] Are we there? Amen. Are we there? Amen.
[1:53:12] Verse uh uh uh 12. And God said to Bam,
[1:53:17] you shall not go with them. In other
[1:53:20] words, God says what? Yes or no? Follow
[1:53:23] me, my friend.
[1:53:26] First prayer of BM.
[1:53:29] Amen. What was the answer?
[1:53:32] And they know is better for Israel.
[1:53:36] [Music]
[1:53:37] I hope you begin to understand. So the
[1:53:39] nose of God is your blessing.
[1:53:44] We're getting somewhere, my friend.
[1:53:46] We're getting somewhere, my friend. I'm
[1:53:47] going to help you up. Even those who
[1:53:50] curse you today, you will know. Those
[1:53:53] who wishes you a bad luck.
[1:53:58] Those who say let his tire be broken up
[1:54:01] on the highway, today you going to have
[1:54:03] your answer.
[1:54:07] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. And God say
[1:54:10] verse 12, you shall not go with them.
[1:54:14] You shall not curse the people for they
[1:54:17] are how? So the purpose of God is clear.
[1:54:22] Israel is a blessed people. In other
[1:54:25] words, no curse, no curse. Amen. Can
[1:54:29] operate for Israelless. Israel is
[1:54:32] already sanctioned for blessed. You
[1:54:36] cannot reverse it.
[1:54:39] [Applause]
[1:54:40] [Music]
[1:54:42] You don't understand my friend. This
[1:54:44] Israel had weaknesses.
[1:54:47] They had trouble sir. But when God look
[1:54:50] they are blessed despite the problem,
[1:54:54] [Applause]
[1:55:00] [Music]
[1:55:02] despite the struggling,
[1:55:04] they are still blessed because
[1:55:08] when you were born, your birth, your
[1:55:11] pregnancy was already a victory.
[1:55:15] [Applause]
[1:55:20] For you to be even conceived, you were
[1:55:23] on the wall.
[1:55:25] [Applause]
[1:55:30] You were fighting with your brothers and
[1:55:32] sisters and you overcame all of them.
[1:55:40] Are we together? Are we together? So
[1:55:42] when your pregnancy came out positive,
[1:55:45] it is a victory. In other words,
[1:55:47] somebody won the battle. One in a
[1:55:50] million.
[1:55:53] [Applause]
[1:55:55] Are we together? Are we together? But
[1:55:58] still everybody is on the limbo. Is he
[1:56:02] going to make it to the pregnancy or
[1:56:03] not? So when you are born in a hospital
[1:56:08] and they slap you and you begin to cry,
[1:56:12] it is a shout of an overcoming.
[1:56:20] [Applause]
[1:56:22] I don't know if you together. In other
[1:56:25] word,
[1:56:29] every one of you here entered this earth
[1:56:32] after victory. So you came as an
[1:56:35] overcomer.
[1:56:45] Are we together? Are we together? If you
[1:56:49] overcame when you were unconscious,
[1:56:51] how much more when you are now
[1:56:54] conscious?
[1:57:00] No. Tell somebody, the one who was born
[1:57:03] was an overcomer. I entered this world
[1:57:06] as a champion.
[1:57:08] And if I already overcome there, I'm
[1:57:11] going to overcome every obstacle, every
[1:57:14] problem, every trial, every difficulty,
[1:57:18] I will overcome.
[1:57:21] [Applause]
[1:57:32] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[1:57:34] together? Never walk with your head down
[1:57:37] like this. I am born in this world. I
[1:57:40] already fought a battle. I came as a
[1:57:43] winner. I came with a band-aid.
[1:57:48] Amen.
[1:57:50] I'm a winner. I'm a winner. And if I'm a
[1:57:54] winner now, I will be a winner. I will
[1:57:57] behave like a winner. I will talk like a
[1:58:00] winner.
[1:58:01] [Music]
[1:58:03] Amen.
[1:58:06] Amen.
[1:58:08] In other words, you are a blessed
[1:58:10] people.
[1:58:14] [Applause]
[1:58:18] Are we together?
[1:58:20] Are we together?
[1:58:23] Don't curse Israel because Israel is
[1:58:27] blessed.
[1:58:28] [Music]
[1:58:32] The prayer of Bam.
[1:58:35] Where are we at, my friend? 13. Verse
[1:58:37] 13. And Bam rose up in the morning and
[1:58:41] said to the princes of Bale, get you
[1:58:44] into your land, for the Lord refuses
[1:58:48] to give me leave to go what? So the
[1:58:51] answer was yes or no. Bam did very good.
[1:58:55] Yes.
[1:58:57] I'm not going to go with you. God says
[1:58:59] no.
[1:59:01] We clear. Amen. Job to verse 16. And
[1:59:05] they came to Bum.
[1:59:07] When they reach Bellac, Bellac say go
[1:59:09] back to him.
[1:59:12] Go increase a little bit be the reward,
[1:59:14] the bonus.
[1:59:19] Tell him if he prays that prayer, I'm
[1:59:23] going to take care of him. Verse 16. And
[1:59:25] they came to Bellam and said to him,
[1:59:27] "Thus say Bellac the son of Zippo, let
[1:59:30] nothing, I pray you, hinder you for
[1:59:33] coming to me, for I will promote you
[1:59:37] to very great honor." I'm reading the
[1:59:39] Bible. And I will do whatsoever you say
[1:59:42] to me. Come, therefore, I pray you, and
[1:59:45] curse me these people.
[1:59:50] Are we together? And Bam answer and say
[1:59:53] to the servant of Balac, "If Bailac will
[1:59:56] give me his house full of silver and
[1:59:58] gold, I cannot go beyond the word of my
[2:00:01] God of the Lord my God."
[2:00:04] The Lord who? My God. So God was the God
[2:00:07] of Bam.
[2:00:08] [Applause]
[2:00:10] H But he was the God of Israel.
[2:00:13] Are we together now? Are we together
[2:00:15] now? He said, "I will not go beyond the
[2:00:18] word of the Lord, my God, to do less or
[2:00:20] what?" Or more. It sounds like it's
[2:00:22] good, right? So, he just told them that
[2:00:24] no matter how much you give it to me, I
[2:00:26] won't do it. What do you do? You will
[2:00:28] tell them go back. But let's see if he
[2:00:31] really mean what he says.
[2:00:34] Verse uh uh that was 18. Verse 19. Now
[2:00:38] therefore I pray you Terry Oh I thought
[2:00:42] you not going to
[2:00:44] Terry you also here this night that our
[2:00:47] men know what the Lord will say to be
[2:00:50] what
[2:00:53] a hypocrite
[2:00:58] what he says in his mouth is not what he
[2:01:00] meant in his heart.
[2:01:04] Are we together? Are we together? God
[2:01:08] already says no.
[2:01:10] Now you change again. You say, you know
[2:01:12] what? Let me go ahead and pray again to
[2:01:14] the Lord to see what God will say.
[2:01:18] Does God change his mind?
[2:01:21] God already said this people is blessed.
[2:01:24] In other words, somebody is pushing to
[2:01:27] reverse the opposition in God
[2:01:31] so that you can be cursed. Do you want
[2:01:34] God to hear that prayer? No, watch my
[2:01:36] friend. Amen. Are we there? Amen. Verse
[2:01:40] 20. And God came to balance. God came
[2:01:43] down again.
[2:01:47] You see, you see God speak to me. Eh,
[2:01:50] when I pray, God come down. Come, come
[2:01:52] here to our church.
[2:01:57] Mega church. Are we together? Amen. And
[2:02:00] God came down to Bum at night and said
[2:02:03] to him, "If the man come to call you,
[2:02:07] rise up and go with them." Uh, it looks
[2:02:10] like God have changed.
[2:02:13] H please follow me. Rise up and go with
[2:02:15] them. But yet the word which I shall say
[2:02:19] to you, that shall you what? Since you
[2:02:22] are insisting, you
[2:02:25] look at my board my friend. The first
[2:02:27] answer was what? BM push. Now the noise
[2:02:31] is moving toward water. So you are
[2:02:33] entering which wheel?
[2:02:36] [Music]
[2:02:38] Are we together now? We clear now. Amen.
[2:02:40] He said go with them. Watch. Watch. You
[2:02:44] need to know the scripture. Verse 21. As
[2:02:47] soon as God said that, Bam say praise
[2:02:50] the Lord. Now I got a yes from the Lord.
[2:02:52] I'm in the will of the Lord. I'm going
[2:02:54] to go ahead and do. You already know
[2:02:56] what the prophet say
[2:02:58] and you trying to pray against what the
[2:03:00] prophet said. The prophet say under no
[2:03:03] circumstances
[2:03:08] a believer should marry an unbeliever.
[2:03:10] You come up you say Lord please he's a
[2:03:13] good boy. He can change and be in the
[2:03:15] message and God say yes.
[2:03:22] Welcome for trouble.
[2:03:27] Are we together? Are we together?
[2:03:29] Because you didn't want to abide with
[2:03:31] his will. His will was a protection.
[2:03:35] Follow me, my friend.
[2:03:37] And Bam rose up in the morning. Ah. And
[2:03:41] do what? Saddle his hand. And went with
[2:03:43] the princes of Moab. Praise the Lord.
[2:03:45] Bam. I thought you told us that God say
[2:03:48] no. No, no, no, no, no. I got a
[2:03:49] different answer. The Lord spoke to me
[2:03:50] this morning and he said yes. Oh, I'm on
[2:03:54] my way to Canaan land. No Canaan land.
[2:03:56] You on the way to hell.
[2:04:00] Are we together? Are we together? Verse
[2:04:03] 22. Watch. As soon as Bellam enter on
[2:04:07] the road. Verse 22. And God's angel. Oh,
[2:04:11] I thought God told him to do that. Young
[2:04:13] people, I hope you are. You are you are
[2:04:15] following me. God told him go do it. As
[2:04:18] soon as he start doing it, God got
[2:04:20] upset. Amen. Amen.
[2:04:24] I'm reading the Bible.
[2:04:26] God, why are you getting upset? Because
[2:04:29] originally I told you no.
[2:04:33] Are you following me? And God's anger
[2:04:36] was how?
[2:04:38] Because he went. Who told him to go? So
[2:04:43] why is God getting upset?
[2:04:46] Are we together? Amen. He says he went
[2:04:50] and the angel of the Lord stood in the
[2:04:52] way for a friend.
[2:04:56] The angel of the Lord stood how? So who
[2:04:59] is now your enemy?
[2:05:02] So when you going in the permissive will
[2:05:05] God became your enemy. Now
[2:05:09] please I'm reading the Bible. You want
[2:05:12] to turn God into your enemy? Go his
[2:05:14] permissive way. Now God become the
[2:05:16] enemy.
[2:05:19] Amen. Amen. And the angel of the Lord
[2:05:21] stood in the way for a what? Adversary
[2:05:23] against him. Now he was riding upon his
[2:05:26] ass and his two servant were how with
[2:05:29] him. You know the whole story. Now how
[2:05:31] he get and the and the asses seize and
[2:05:34] then move away and move away and he
[2:05:36] begin to beat the beast and everything.
[2:05:38] You know the story, right? Job to verse
[2:05:40] 31 so we can save time. Then the Lord
[2:05:43] opened the eyes of Benam, and he saw the
[2:05:46] angel of the Lord standing in the way,
[2:05:49] and he sword John in his hand, and he
[2:05:53] bowed down his head and fell flat to his
[2:05:55] face. And the angel of the Lord said to
[2:05:58] him, "Wherefore have you smit in your
[2:06:00] eyes these three times? Behold, I went
[2:06:03] out to withstand you." The same God that
[2:06:06] said, "Don't go." He's saying, "Go back
[2:06:09] over there." Amen.
[2:06:11] withstand you because your way is how
[2:06:15] good perverse perform. So the way of
[2:06:18] Bellam is a perverse way. The permissive
[2:06:21] will is a perverse way.
[2:06:24] I'm going slowly, my friend. Amen. Amen.
[2:06:27] Amen. A perverse way. A perverse before
[2:06:30] me. Are we together? Amen. Are we
[2:06:33] together? And they saw me and I turned
[2:06:37] and I turned from me. Sorry. and turned
[2:06:40] from me this three time unless she had
[2:06:43] turned from me. Surely now also I had
[2:06:46] slain you and save her. In other words,
[2:06:48] I was about to kill you right there. You
[2:06:51] want God to kill you?
[2:06:53] Get out of the perfect will, my friend.
[2:06:56] In other words, leave his word
[2:06:59] and then God is the one whooping you.
[2:07:01] Now, are we together? Amen. Verse 34.
[2:07:04] And Bam said to the angel, "Follow me,
[2:07:06] my friend, of the Lord, I have seen,
[2:07:11] for I knew not that you stood in the way
[2:07:13] against me." Now therefore, if he
[2:07:17] displeased me, look, he's saying, if he
[2:07:19] displeases you, God just told you your
[2:07:21] way are perverse. And you are saying if
[2:07:24] he displeases, he already been
[2:07:25] displeasing God and you are saying if he
[2:07:28] displeases you, so he's still not
[2:07:31] convinced. I'm going slowly, my friend.
[2:07:35] He's still not. He's just speaking. Uh
[2:07:37] uh if he if he displeases you, I told
[2:07:40] you I'm coming as an adversary. Your way
[2:07:42] is perverse and you are telling me if he
[2:07:44] displeases you.
[2:07:46] Watch what he's saying. If he displeases
[2:07:49] you,
[2:07:50] where am I? If he displeases you, Amen.
[2:07:53] I will be I will get me what? Do you
[2:07:56] know what he's saying? He say, well, you
[2:07:59] know what? If if you didn't like it, I'm
[2:08:01] going back. I won't go anymore. Watch
[2:08:04] again if he really meant it. Are we
[2:08:06] there? Verse 35. And the angel of the
[2:08:10] Lord said to Bam, "Go with them."
[2:08:15] Come on, man.
[2:08:17] Come on, man.
[2:08:19] If you are normal man, will you go
[2:08:22] again?
[2:08:24] Because you told me to go. You want to
[2:08:26] kill me. Now you saying again to go and
[2:08:28] watch BM.
[2:08:32] Are we there?
[2:08:34] Go with them, but only the words that I
[2:08:37] speak to you that you you shall speak.
[2:08:40] So, Bam did what? Went with the princes
[2:08:43] of Ba.
[2:08:44] Did he really mean to go back? Because
[2:08:48] behind him there is a million dollar
[2:08:50] that they told him they're going to pay
[2:08:53] him. So, he's looking at how rich he's
[2:08:55] going to be. So, God, if there is a
[2:08:58] possibility, let me go. Israel have not
[2:09:01] done anything. Follow me my friend.
[2:09:04] Israel is minding their business. Israel
[2:09:07] is sleeping doing their thing. Do you
[2:09:10] follow me? They don't know even what
[2:09:12] happened over there that someone want to
[2:09:14] curse them. But somebody is going to
[2:09:17] prayer. So a curse can strike Israel.
[2:09:24] We clear my friend. We clear. Chapter
[2:09:26] 23. Let's go my friend. If I have to
[2:09:30] stop here, no problem. Chapter 23. Let's
[2:09:32] go. Verse one. And Bam said to Bac,
[2:09:35] "Build me how many altar?" Seven altar.
[2:09:38] Do you know that they knew how to
[2:09:39] worship God?
[2:09:41] Seven altar and prepare me what? Seven
[2:09:44] oxes and water. Seven. Same sacrifice
[2:09:47] are Israel.
[2:09:49] Denomination. Same thing. In other
[2:09:52] words, if you test them by the altar, we
[2:09:54] look the same. We are using the same
[2:09:57] Bible.
[2:10:01] The same King James I'm preaching here
[2:10:03] is the same Bible they're preaching over
[2:10:05] there. But the interpretation
[2:10:09] is different. We have the absolute
[2:10:13] perfect vindicated interpretation of the
[2:10:17] Bible.
[2:10:20] Are we together? Are we together? Verse
[2:10:24] two. And Bellac did as Bam has spoken.
[2:10:27] And Bella and Bam offer on every altar a
[2:10:30] water bac and a water and a ra. Brother
[2:10:33] say he was speaking about the coming of
[2:10:34] Christ. Are we together? And bam said to
[2:10:37] bail stand by your burnt offering and I
[2:10:40] will go perapse
[2:10:44] the Lord will come to me and whatsoever
[2:10:46] he show me I will tell you. And he went
[2:10:49] to a water high place. In other words,
[2:10:51] let's go to prayer now. All right.
[2:10:55] And they are trying to pray what?
[2:10:59] A curse toward what? And if ever God
[2:11:04] approved that prayer, what happened to
[2:11:06] Israel?
[2:11:09] The nose of God. Blessed are
[2:11:13] we together. Amen. Now Bam goes to pray.
[2:11:17] You think God won't come back? Come
[2:11:19] down. Watch verse four. And God met BM.
[2:11:23] What a gift.
[2:11:25] Amen.
[2:11:27] Amen. Denomination, they're doing bad
[2:11:30] things and God still heal them and they
[2:11:32] still having miracle. So if what they
[2:11:34] doing is bad, why is God letting them
[2:11:36] have a miracle, a Pentecostal
[2:11:38] understanding,
[2:11:40] if you base that by miracle, you're
[2:11:42] going to go to hell? Because Judah cast
[2:11:45] out devils.
[2:11:47] Yes sir.
[2:11:49] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[2:11:52] Amen. Verse 34. And God met Bellum and
[2:11:55] said to him,
[2:11:57] I have prepared seven altar and have
[2:11:59] offered up every altar a bullock and in
[2:12:02] other way I done everything correctly.
[2:12:05] And the Lord put a word in Balem mouth
[2:12:08] and say return to Bale and that shall
[2:12:11] you speak.
[2:12:13] In other words, the Lord answered the
[2:12:16] prayer.
[2:12:17] Yes, he did. Amen. Amen. But he's
[2:12:20] answering the prayer by putting
[2:12:21] something in the mouth. So when Bella
[2:12:25] Bam is coming up under the anointing,
[2:12:28] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Bam say great.
[2:12:32] Praise the Lord. Finally, we got the
[2:12:34] anointing. Go ahead and start the
[2:12:36] cursing.
[2:12:39] You ready? Are you ready? Amen. Are you
[2:12:42] ready? Amen. Verse seven. And he took up
[2:12:45] his parable and say, "Belac,
[2:12:48] the king of Moab has brought me from
[2:12:51] Aaron out of the mountain of the east,
[2:12:54] saying, Come and curse me, Jacob,
[2:12:57] and come defy Israel. How shall I
[2:13:00] curse?" Oh,
[2:13:04] amen.
[2:13:05] Whom God has not cursed.
[2:13:09] Amen.
[2:13:12] I believe Barack got a heart attack.
[2:13:20] Are we together? Are we together?
[2:13:23] Because God stopped answering that
[2:13:26] prayer. But God did not only stop
[2:13:29] answering the prayer, but God used that
[2:13:32] opportunity to begin to bless Israel.
[2:13:37] [Applause]
[2:13:39] I hope you are understanding me. I hope
[2:13:41] we are together. The Bible says this my
[2:13:44] friend in the book of Deuteron
[2:13:46] Deuteronomy 23. Nevertheless, the Lord
[2:13:49] that God what? Would not hearken unto
[2:13:51] Baum. In other words, God told Bam what?
[2:13:54] No. H would not hearken unto Balam. But
[2:13:58] the Lord thy God did what? Turn the
[2:14:00] curse into a what? A blessing unto me.
[2:14:03] Because the Lord thy God loved thee.
[2:14:07] So every curses was now turned into
[2:14:10] what?
[2:14:14] Are we together? Let's watch the
[2:14:16] blessing.
[2:14:18] How shall I curse whom God has not
[2:14:20] cursed? Or how shall I defy whom the
[2:14:24] Lord has not what? Defy. From the top of
[2:14:27] the rock I see him and from the hill I
[2:14:31] behold him. Lord the people shall dwell
[2:14:34] how? Alone. They are not denomination
[2:14:37] and shall not be reckoned among what the
[2:14:40] nation. They are not among the
[2:14:42] denomination.
[2:14:45] Are we together?
[2:14:47] Who can count the dust of Jacob and the
[2:14:51] number of the fourth part of Israel? Let
[2:14:54] me die the death of the righteous
[2:14:59] and lest and let my last hand be like
[2:15:02] what? In other words, who is righteous?
[2:15:04] Amen. Israel is righteous. Amen. Israel
[2:15:09] is righteous. And Benac said to him to
[2:15:12] Bam. What have you done to me?
[2:15:16] I took you to do what? Bless my name.
[2:15:19] And behold, you have what? What?
[2:15:22] [Music]
[2:15:23] Hallelujah.
[2:15:25] So the nose of God turn into a blessing
[2:15:28] to Israel because God knows a better for
[2:15:32] your life. I hope we are together. Are
[2:15:35] we together? Amen. Are we together?
[2:15:38] Amen. Job to verse uh 13.
[2:15:42] And Belac said to him, "Come." This is
[2:15:45] the first prayer. He say, "Come." Amen.
[2:15:50] I pray you with me to another place.
[2:15:54] From where you may see them, you shall
[2:15:57] see but the water utmost part of them
[2:16:00] and shall not see them all and curse
[2:16:03] them and curse me them from there. And
[2:16:06] brother Brandham said the word utmost
[2:16:09] means the rotten part.
[2:16:12] In other words, come and let me show you
[2:16:14] the weaknesses, the error, what is going
[2:16:18] on in their life that are not still
[2:16:20] right so you can curse them from there.
[2:16:26] Amen. Are we together? Brother Brandham
[2:16:28] say he fell to see the present serpent.
[2:16:32] And the smitting rock that was right
[2:16:34] there. Moab did not have that. Are we
[2:16:38] together? Are we together? Amen. Verse
[2:16:41] uh 14. And he brought him into the field
[2:16:45] of Zofim to the top of Pisgah and built
[2:16:48] how many altars? Seven altars. And offer
[2:16:50] a bullock and a ram on what? every
[2:16:53] altar. And he said to Bam, "Stand here
[2:16:55] by your burnt offering while I meet the
[2:16:58] Lord Yonder." He go back again to pray.
[2:17:04] And the Lord met Pam. Oh my God.
[2:17:09] And put a word in his mouth and say, "Go
[2:17:11] again to Beleg and say this." What do
[2:17:15] you say? Are you there? Are you there?
[2:17:18] Amen. Go to verse 18. He took up his
[2:17:21] parable and say, "Rise up, Bellac, and
[2:17:24] hear and hearken to me, you son of
[2:17:26] Zippor." God is not a man
[2:17:34] that he should lie. Are we together? Are
[2:17:37] we together? Amen. And neither the what?
[2:17:40] Son of man. That he should what? Repent.
[2:17:43] He cannot change. Has he said he shall
[2:17:45] he not uh uh uh shall he not do it? Or
[2:17:48] has he spoken? Shall he not make good?
[2:17:50] In other words, you are still going
[2:17:52] against the purpose of God. Yes. Yes.
[2:17:54] Amen. You can't curse these people. Are
[2:17:57] we together? Amen. Behold, I receive
[2:18:00] what commandment to bless. And he has
[2:18:02] what? Blessed. And I cannot do what?
[2:18:05] Reverse it. He has not beheld
[2:18:09] iniquity in Jacob.
[2:18:12] Now the prayer is even
[2:18:16] I don't even see any fault.
[2:18:19] You took me to see their folk
[2:18:22] but now when I look at them I don't see
[2:18:24] anything.
[2:18:29] L
[2:18:30] [Applause]
[2:18:32] why brother Brandham say because of the
[2:18:34] smitten serpent because the smitten
[2:18:37] serpent was a top of Calvary because
[2:18:40] Jesus say as Moses lift up the serpent
[2:18:44] so the son of man will be lifted up. So
[2:18:47] when God come, he sees Calvary in spoken
[2:18:50] word.
[2:18:52] He say I don't see any problem with
[2:18:54] them.
[2:18:56] I hope you are understanding me. And
[2:18:59] because I don't see any problem, I can't
[2:19:01] go back like that. I need to bless them.
[2:19:08] Are we together? Are we together? Amen.
[2:19:11] Are we together? Amen. He says
[2:19:14] he says beheld. I'll be verse 21. He has
[2:19:18] not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither
[2:19:20] has he seen what? Perverseness of
[2:19:22] Israel. The perverseness was with uh him
[2:19:24] over there, not with Israel. The Lord
[2:19:27] his God is with him
[2:19:30] as much as he speak over there. But God
[2:19:33] truly is with Israel.
[2:19:36] And the shout
[2:19:40] of the what is what among them. So
[2:19:44] Israel and Moab were different because
[2:19:48] Israel have the shout
[2:19:51] of the king.
[2:19:53] [Applause]
[2:19:58] [Music]
[2:20:02] Yes sir. Because the Lord himself shall
[2:20:06] descend with a what? And brother
[2:20:09] Brandham said the shout is the message.
[2:20:12] So the difference between denomination
[2:20:15] and ask is the message.
[2:20:22] Hallelujah. They got the Bible. We got
[2:20:25] the Bible. But we got the message. They
[2:20:28] don't have the message. And the message
[2:20:30] is the shout not of a prophet but the
[2:20:34] shout of who? That's why when the sword
[2:20:38] came he said the sword of who? Which was
[2:20:42] the sh of the blood?
[2:20:44] [Applause]
[2:20:46] [Music]
[2:20:48] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[2:20:52] together? So now you need to see clearly
[2:20:56] the difference between us and
[2:20:58] denomination. You don't need to copy
[2:21:00] them.
[2:21:02] They need to copy us.
[2:21:05] You don't need to copy their preaching.
[2:21:07] You don't need to copy their singing.
[2:21:10] You sing and let them follow you because
[2:21:14] you got more than them. You got what
[2:21:17] they don't have.
[2:21:23] Are we there? Amen. Are we there? Amen.
[2:21:26] Verse 22. God brought them how? Out of
[2:21:30] Egypt.
[2:21:32] God took them from the world. And uh uh
[2:21:36] he has as he were the strength of a
[2:21:38] what? The unicorn.
[2:21:40] He didn't stop the blessing. The
[2:21:42] anointing is still flowing. Amen. Verse
[2:21:46] uh 23. Surely surely there is water.
[2:21:53] [Applause]
[2:21:55] There is water. No.
[2:21:57] No what? Enchantment. No enchantment
[2:22:00] against who? Jacob. Do you know the word
[2:22:03] enchantment means what? No witchcraft.
[2:22:07] No sorcery. No sorcery against Jacob. So
[2:22:11] as a message believer, no witchcraft
[2:22:15] will operate in this church.
[2:22:20] [Music]
[2:22:23] [Applause]
[2:22:28] Let me say it here. Let me say it here.
[2:22:32] The witchcraft from America, the
[2:22:35] witchcraft from Africa, the witchcraft
[2:22:38] from Europe, from South America, from
[2:22:41] Australia, no witchcraft will operate
[2:22:44] here.
[2:22:46] [Applause]
[2:22:54] In other words, you should not be
[2:22:56] intimidated
[2:22:58] by anyone who wishes you a bad luck.
[2:23:04] [Applause]
[2:23:07] Can you put your seat belt? The Bible
[2:23:09] says this in Proverb 26 26 verse two.
[2:23:13] The Bible says what as the bird Uhhuh.
[2:23:16] by water by wandering as the water
[2:23:19] swallowed by by water by water by
[2:23:22] flying. So the curse causeless
[2:23:25] shall not come. In other words, if
[2:23:27] somebody curse you without any cause, go
[2:23:31] to sleep.
[2:23:32] [Applause]
[2:23:33] [Music]
[2:23:37] Brother, I didn't do you anything wrong.
[2:23:40] Sister, I didn't do anything wrong. Go
[2:23:42] ahead and curse.
[2:23:45] go to Asheville and curse me.
[2:23:49] It will not happen.
[2:23:51] [Applause]
[2:23:55] And as a matter of fact, God is the same
[2:23:59] yesterday, today, and what? Forever. If
[2:24:02] the curse was changed into blessing over
[2:24:05] there in the first Exodus, in the second
[2:24:09] Exodus, in the third Exodus, your curses
[2:24:16] Amen.
[2:24:18] Glory.
[2:24:21] He's going over there. He will see what
[2:24:23] will happen in his life. He will see
[2:24:25] what he happened to his family. Nothing
[2:24:28] will happen to my family.
[2:24:32] Nothing will happen. And every curse
[2:24:35] will go back to you.
[2:24:39] No sorcery against Jacob.
[2:24:41] Don't think you are under a curse. You
[2:24:43] are a blessed peopleless people.
[2:24:47] A blessed people doesn't mean you don't
[2:24:50] have weaknesses.
[2:24:52] Because Elijah was a man of light
[2:24:54] passion. But when he pray, God
[2:24:57] understand
[2:24:59] God when he look at you, he doesn't see
[2:25:00] iniquity.
[2:25:02] [Music]
[2:25:07] My friend, if Israel
[2:25:10] knew what was going on, if Israel had
[2:25:14] the revelation of what was coming up in
[2:25:17] that mountain
[2:25:19] [Applause]
[2:25:23] because sometime those revelation goes
[2:25:26] to the devil.
[2:25:30] You didn't get me well. Job did not know
[2:25:34] that there was a hedge around him. It
[2:25:38] was the devil that knew.
[2:25:42] The devil say you put a hedgeh. But Job
[2:25:45] did not know that he was first.
[2:25:52] [Music]
[2:25:56] What I'm trying to say is the thing you
[2:25:59] guys got used to it. Yes, sir. the
[2:26:01] message. You got used to it. You don't
[2:26:03] know the power of it. The devil knows
[2:26:06] it.
[2:26:07] [Applause]
[2:26:16] The sermon, the sermon you getting used
[2:26:19] here that you don't even want to review.
[2:26:22] The devil knows the power of it.
[2:26:27] You got used to, brother Steven. You got
[2:26:30] used to brother Kelly and you don't
[2:26:32] understand the power that is coming
[2:26:35] here.
[2:26:39] But the enemy is looking and knows
[2:26:42] better that don't touch that church.
[2:26:46] It's a hard potato.
[2:26:52] Let me leave that church. Don't touch
[2:26:55] that believer.
[2:26:57] He's a hot potato. The revelation he's
[2:27:00] receiving now is powerful.
[2:27:03] [Applause]
[2:27:06] [Music]
[2:27:06] [Applause]
[2:27:13] If you ask Israel, if you ask Israel,
[2:27:16] what is that? He say, "Ah, that was the
[2:27:19] serpent of Moses." You didn't know the
[2:27:21] story? Yeah. When we were coming in
[2:27:23] Exodus, that serpent was when our father
[2:27:26] look and they say, "No." But they didn't
[2:27:28] know that that serpent when the devil
[2:27:30] looking
[2:27:35] because Calvary is more powerful than a
[2:27:37] story.
[2:27:40] The cross of Calvary, the blood,
[2:27:44] the blood is more powerful because no
[2:27:48] devil can cross the blood.
[2:27:52] [Music]
[2:27:54] [Applause]
[2:27:55] [Music]
[2:28:00] In other words, in other word, whoever
[2:28:03] is wishes you a bad luck,
[2:28:06] they actually blessing you.
[2:28:12] Because we have a promise.
[2:28:14] He puts up his table in the presence
[2:28:19] [Music]
[2:28:20] of my friend of my friend of my who? So
[2:28:25] leave the enemy alone.
[2:28:27] [Music]
[2:28:29] He will watch the anointing upon me and
[2:28:31] my cup will overflow.
[2:28:42] Glory, glory, glory. I have six minutes
[2:28:44] left. I have not started Paul.
[2:28:48] Where are we at my friend? Where are we
[2:28:51] at? We on 22. I have not started Paul.
[2:28:53] If I can, Sister Adasa, you call this
[2:28:55] the prayer of Bum.
[2:28:57] Because Jesus prayed three times. Yes.
[2:29:00] Yes, he did. And Bam. This is the second
[2:29:02] time. We will see how many time also he
[2:29:04] prayed. And I will show you how many
[2:29:06] times Paul prayed. Yes, he did. And then
[2:29:10] you're going to see how it's flowing.
[2:29:12] Jesus. Amen. Are we together? Are we
[2:29:15] together? Amen. Are we together? Never
[2:29:17] get used to this message. It's a
[2:29:20] dangerous game.
[2:29:22] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. If you get
[2:29:26] to a church where when you go to that
[2:29:29] church, it becomes routine. It's a
[2:29:31] problem.
[2:29:37] You who are following me online, I know
[2:29:39] you got used to your comfort zone. If
[2:29:42] you are sitting in the Mesa church and
[2:29:44] it becomes like a routine like a
[2:29:47] Catholic or a Baptist church, you need
[2:29:51] to come out. Every day in church, there
[2:29:54] must be a revival
[2:30:02] because God is in the midst of us.
[2:30:08] Glory to God.
[2:30:11] Because getting used make things boring.
[2:30:18] [Applause]
[2:30:20] But when you come, God open up. When you
[2:30:22] come, God open up. When you come, God
[2:30:24] open up. The next thing you want to go
[2:30:26] quickly to church because I'm ready for
[2:30:29] the next. And as you eating, you
[2:30:32] growing. As you eating, you growing.
[2:30:34] Getting closer to your theophony.
[2:30:40] Thank you.
[2:30:43] Are we together? Are we together? Amen.
[2:30:45] I don't think I can start even Paul.
[2:30:50] Let's finish with BM, my friend. Buckle
[2:30:52] up. I'm heading to the airport. Verse
[2:30:55] 23. Surely there is no what? Enchantment
[2:30:59] against who? Jacob. Remember, I have not
[2:31:01] touched the boy that was born blind
[2:31:05] because we need to deal with that. And
[2:31:07] and I'm going to combine him with Paul,
[2:31:08] Lord willing. He says, "Surely there is
[2:31:11] no what?" Enchantment against who?
[2:31:13] Jacob. Neither is there any water?
[2:31:16] Divination.
[2:31:19] So when you go into the mall,
[2:31:23] you see the lady that look like a witch
[2:31:26] with a crystal ball, just pass your way,
[2:31:29] don't even mind her because there's
[2:31:32] nothing that lady will do. Do you know
[2:31:34] what we do? We get there. Uh-huh. No,
[2:31:36] no, no, no, no, no, no, no. She need to
[2:31:38] know who I am. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[2:31:43] Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I don't know if you
[2:31:46] understand. I don't know if you
[2:31:48] understand. I was told. So, don't come
[2:31:50] after church to ask me. I was told that
[2:31:54] there are airplane in the United States
[2:31:56] when they passes your neighborhood, they
[2:31:59] can cut power. That's right.
[2:32:03] You heard it.
[2:32:05] When they passes your neighborhood, they
[2:32:07] can cut electricity.
[2:32:11] So you get in the blind, in the dark,
[2:32:13] and they can destroy you.
[2:32:16] So a Christian is like that airplane.
[2:32:19] When I am getting somewhere, I'm cutting
[2:32:22] electricity.
[2:32:24] [Applause]
[2:32:25] [Music]
[2:32:28] [Applause]
[2:32:31] I don't know if you understanding all
[2:32:34] the fuses box of the devil begin to pop
[2:32:37] up because I'm there
[2:32:40] [Applause]
[2:32:42] because the greater is he that is in me
[2:32:45] than he that is in the word. My power is
[2:32:48] greater.
[2:32:50] [Music]
[2:32:56] People think when I speak and I look at
[2:32:58] people like this, they think I'm proud.
[2:33:00] No, it's not proud. I know who I am.
[2:33:04] I cannot talk to you and put my head
[2:33:06] like this and like this.
[2:33:08] God, yes, my brother. I don't care how
[2:33:11] many years you've been. Even if you've
[2:33:12] been the ancient of day, that's your
[2:33:14] problem.
[2:33:16] I will respect you. But I'm looking at
[2:33:18] you.
[2:33:20] Because even God cannot change his
[2:33:24] purpose for me.
[2:33:27] Even God himself. That's why when God
[2:33:31] want to wipe Israel, Moses say, "Wait,
[2:33:35] look at your book. My name is there. God
[2:33:38] remove my name.
[2:33:40] God remove my name. Show me that you a
[2:33:44] man. God remove my name.
[2:33:47] God scratch his heart. Say this boy here
[2:33:51] because Moses knew no one can change it.
[2:33:55] Even God himself cannot change it. If
[2:33:58] God cannot change, what will the devil
[2:34:01] do?
[2:34:05] [Applause]
[2:34:13] Church, you need to know who you are. No
[2:34:16] witchcraft,
[2:34:17] no sorcery, no curse.
[2:34:24] Hallelujah.
[2:34:26] [Applause]
[2:34:32] [Music]
[2:34:37] Where are we at my friend? On 23. He
[2:34:40] says, "Surely there is no what? Against
[2:34:44] Jacob. There is there
[2:34:46] neither is there any what? Divination
[2:34:49] against Israel. According to this time,
[2:34:51] it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel
[2:34:55] what God has what." In other words, look
[2:34:57] what God has done. Are we together? Are
[2:35:00] we together? Verse 24. Behold, the
[2:35:04] people shall rise up. He continue. Yes
[2:35:06] sir. As a great water.
[2:35:11] Yes sir. In other words, Bellam, you
[2:35:14] want to poke the blessing for me.
[2:35:21] He said the people shall rise up like
[2:35:23] what? Great lion and lift himself up
[2:35:25] like a what? He shall not lie down until
[2:35:30] he eat of what? To pray. Yes, sir. In
[2:35:33] other words, Israel doesn't rest if he
[2:35:36] has not catched his prey. In other
[2:35:39] words, when Israel sees the pray,
[2:35:41] brother Robert, Israel, when he engage,
[2:35:44] he won't rest. In other word, the bride,
[2:35:48] when she saw a promise, when she engage,
[2:35:52] she doesn't go back until she get that
[2:35:55] promise.
[2:35:58] She won't sleep until she get it.
[2:36:03] Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. Where are
[2:36:07] we at, my friend? And drink the blood of
[2:36:10] what? The slain. Hallelujah. They drink
[2:36:14] the blood of what? The slain.
[2:36:19] And the son of man came and say, "Except
[2:36:22] a man
[2:36:24] drink. Drink what? Blood.
[2:36:27] Drink what? Blood. And eat what? Yes. So
[2:36:32] when you have the son of man, you are
[2:36:34] doing what? Eating the flesh and water.
[2:36:37] And Israel is a people that eat flesh
[2:36:40] and water. And when I get the message of
[2:36:43] Yahweh,
[2:36:44] I eat the flesh.
[2:36:49] It's the mechanic and the dynamic.
[2:36:52] [Applause]
[2:36:54] I'm not just listening to the tape, but
[2:36:56] the God of the tape is also entering me.
[2:37:01] s
[2:37:03] because life is in the blood. The life
[2:37:06] of the message is also coming.
[2:37:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:37:12] Where are we at, my friend? Verse 25.
[2:37:15] Verse uh 25. And Bac said to Bellam,
[2:37:19] "Neither
[2:37:22] curse them at all, nor what? Bless the
[2:37:25] in other words, stop.
[2:37:31] I told you to curse, you bless. So now I
[2:37:34] don't even want you to bless them. Leave
[2:37:36] the blessing. Leave the curses. Stop
[2:37:38] right there.
[2:37:42] [Music]
[2:37:49] So it's not overflow yet. He have to run
[2:37:52] over. In other words, God have to give
[2:37:54] you beyond.
[2:38:05] There is a traffic in the airport. Bear
[2:38:07] with me. I'm circling. Okay, bear with
[2:38:10] me. Flight attendant. Where are we at,
[2:38:12] my friend? Verse 26. Verse what? 26.
[2:38:15] Verse 26. But B uh verse uh 26. Let's
[2:38:20] keep jump to verse 27.
[2:38:22] And Bac said to Bam, "Come, I pray you,
[2:38:26] I will bring you to another place."
[2:38:29] Perhaps it how many times now? Three.
[2:38:32] Which time now? Three. through his
[2:38:34] perfection. Are we together? Remember
[2:38:37] Jesus three bam is praying three and we
[2:38:40] going to finish to another place.
[2:38:42] Perhaps he will please God that you may
[2:38:45] curse them from there. Are we together?
[2:38:49] Amen. Are we together? Amen.
[2:38:52] And Belac brought Bellam to the top of
[2:38:54] Por that looks toward Gerimoth Jesimon.
[2:38:58] And Bam said to Bale, "Build me seven
[2:39:00] altar here." They don't get tired. and
[2:39:03] prepare me seven bulocks. How many
[2:39:05] bulocks have you lost?
[2:39:08] Fasting, fasting, fasting, fasting,
[2:39:09] fasting. Amen. And seven ram. And Belac
[2:39:13] did as Bam had say and offer up a bulock
[2:39:17] and a ram of every. So this man is
[2:39:19] determined to curse Israel. And God is
[2:39:22] determined to bless Israel.
[2:39:26] Conflict between God and Satan. Yes,
[2:39:28] sir. Are we together? Are we together?
[2:39:31] Job to verse uh chapter 24 then we
[2:39:34] finish here. Verse one, the Bible say,
[2:39:36] "And when Bam saw that he pleased the
[2:39:39] Lord to bless Israel, he went not."
[2:39:43] Somebody begin to learn a lesson as the
[2:39:46] other time to seek for enchantment, but
[2:39:48] he set his face toward the wilderness.
[2:39:51] And Bellam lift up his eyes, and he saw
[2:39:54] Israel abiding in his tent according to
[2:39:58] their tribe. And the spirit of God came
[2:40:01] upon him.
[2:40:03] The anointing drop again. Amen. Amen.
[2:40:06] Amen. Amen. And he took up his parable.
[2:40:09] And now the one started. Yes sir. Amen.
[2:40:12] Amen. Amen. And say Bam.
[2:40:16] The son of pe has said the man whose
[2:40:19] eyes are open has said he has said which
[2:40:23] heard the words of God which saw the
[2:40:25] vision of the almighty felling into
[2:40:27] trance but having his eyes what it's a
[2:40:30] definition of a prophet. A prophet can
[2:40:32] have his eyes open but he sees vision.
[2:40:35] Verse six uh verse uh five. How goodly
[2:40:40] are your tents?
[2:40:43] They told you to curse you start again.
[2:40:45] Right. How goodly are your tent to Jacob
[2:40:49] and your tabernacles, O Israel, as the
[2:40:52] valleys are they spread forth as garden
[2:40:56] by the riverside as the trees of la of
[2:41:00] uh of a line uh I mean alos which the
[2:41:05] Lord has planted as the cedar trees
[2:41:08] beside the water. He shall pour the
[2:41:11] water out of the bucket, and his seed
[2:41:14] shall be in many waters, and his king
[2:41:16] shall be higher than a
[2:41:20] Malachite.
[2:41:21] And his kingdom shall be exalted, God
[2:41:24] brought him forth out of Egypt, and he
[2:41:27] has heard the strength of a unicorn. He
[2:41:30] shall eat up the nation, his enemy, and
[2:41:33] shall break their bone and piece them
[2:41:38] through with his what?
[2:41:41] He couch, he lay down as a lion and as a
[2:41:45] great lion, who shall stir him up.
[2:41:48] Blessed is he that bless you.
[2:41:51] And curse
[2:41:55] in the face of the enemy. Curse. Do you
[2:41:58] know in your face dunk? They're coming
[2:42:01] in front of you and they dunk it. So
[2:42:03] they dunking in your face. He say curse
[2:42:06] is he that curses you. And Benac anger
[2:42:09] was kindled against Bellam and he
[2:42:12] smought his hand together.
[2:42:15] And Belac said to Bam, I called you to
[2:42:18] curse my enemy. And behold, you have all
[2:42:21] together blessed him how many time?
[2:42:26] Wow.
[2:42:32] But God must give you exceedingly
[2:42:36] and abundantly.
[2:42:38] Does the blessing shop? Watch verse 11.
[2:42:43] Therefore flee you now to your place. In
[2:42:45] other words, go. Leave now. In other
[2:42:48] words, bell. Leave.
[2:42:51] Leave. Go.
[2:42:53] Amen. Go to your place. I thought to
[2:42:56] promote you to great honor, but lo, the
[2:43:00] Lord has kept you from honor. And Belam
[2:43:03] said to be spoken not also to your
[2:43:06] messenger which you sent to me, saying,
[2:43:09] if would give me his house full of
[2:43:12] silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the
[2:43:15] commandment of the Lord to do either
[2:43:17] good or bad of my own man. But what the
[2:43:20] Lord say, that will I speak. And now
[2:43:22] behold, in other word, in addition,
[2:43:27] before I go to my home, in addition, now
[2:43:29] behold, I go to my people. Come
[2:43:32] therefore and I will advertise you.
[2:43:36] Let me give you some advertisement now
[2:43:38] about Israel again and let me advertise
[2:43:41] you what this people Israel shall do to
[2:43:44] your people in the last day. In other
[2:43:48] words, before I go, there is a bonus.
[2:43:50] Amen.
[2:43:54] Are we together? Verse 15. And he took
[2:43:57] up a parable and said, Bam, the son of
[2:44:00] Bor has said, the man whose eyes are
[2:44:03] open has said, he has said, which heard
[2:44:06] the word of God, and know the knowledge
[2:44:09] of the Almighty, falling into a trance,
[2:44:11] but having his eyes open, shall I shall
[2:44:14] see him, but not now. I shall do what?
[2:44:18] Behold him. Now, Bam got into the last
[2:44:21] revelation.
[2:44:23] Watch the bonus. I shall behold him, but
[2:44:26] not what? In other words, he's coming.
[2:44:29] Who is coming but not near? There shall
[2:44:32] come a what? A storm. Out of what?
[2:44:35] Jacob.
[2:44:37] And a s shall rise out of what? Israel.
[2:44:41] And shall smat the corner of Moab and
[2:44:45] destroy the children of what? In other
[2:44:47] words, you know what? The Messiah is
[2:44:50] coming
[2:44:52] [Applause]
[2:44:54] and he will rule Israel and he will
[2:44:56] destroy your land. No weapon formed
[2:44:59] against you,
[2:45:01] shall prosper,
[2:45:03] no weapon, my friend. No weapon formed
[2:45:06] against you shall prosper. What is the
[2:45:08] last conclusion? David say, "Help me, oh
[2:45:11] Lord, my God, and save me according to
[2:45:13] thy mercy, that they may know that this
[2:45:16] is your hand, that thy Lord has done
[2:45:19] it." Let them do what? Curse. But you do
[2:45:22] what? Bless. When they arise, let them
[2:45:25] be what? Shame. But let thy servant do
[2:45:28] what? Let my adversary be clothed with
[2:45:31] shame. And let them cover themselves
[2:45:33] with their own what? Diffusion. As what?
[2:45:37] No weapon formed against you will
[2:45:39] prosper. The nos of God are better than
[2:45:43] his yeses. The nos of God block the
[2:45:46] prayer of your enemy and turn them into
[2:45:49] your blessing. Let's stop here. God
[2:45:52] bless you. Let's stand. Brother John.
[2:45:58] Hallelujah. She said I call this the
[2:46:00] prayer of Bellam.
[2:46:02] Amen. And Lord willing next week we pick
[2:46:05] up Paul.
[2:46:07] Amen. Remember three times prayer, three
[2:46:11] times blessed. Amen. Until he brought
[2:46:14] forth the prophecy of the Messiah.
[2:46:16] Hallelujah. God purpose for our life is
[2:46:19] the best. Amen. You are not anyone.
[2:46:23] Amen. You are children of the almighty
[2:46:25] God.
[2:46:27] When we pray, always seek for his will.
[2:46:30] His will is powerful and his will is the
[2:46:33] best. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord,
[2:46:37] we are approaching you again humbly this
[2:46:39] afternoon. Father, we thank you for your
[2:46:41] grace, your love, your mercy, for
[2:46:43] opening our eyes so that now we can see
[2:46:47] clearly what we are into it and what you
[2:46:50] brought us into it. What a blessing. And
[2:46:53] I pray Lord Father that each one of us
[2:46:56] that we realize the greatness of what
[2:46:59] you put in our hand which is the message
[2:47:01] of this hour Lord. Father we commit the
[2:47:04] remaining of the service unto that hand.
[2:47:07] Bless the water of baptism Lord and
[2:47:09] continue with us throughout the week. If
[2:47:11] that Terry again may we meet again Lord
