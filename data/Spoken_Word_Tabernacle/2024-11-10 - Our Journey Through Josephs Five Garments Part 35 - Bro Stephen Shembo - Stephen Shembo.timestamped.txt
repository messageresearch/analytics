[25:09] now he's in the hospital I believe is
[25:11] that correct and the urgency behind this
[25:14] prayer request is that he takes care of

[25:21] you know to ask the Lord to move on this
[25:24] one quickly um not only for his benefit
[25:27] and in God's glory that recovery but for
[25:29] his mom's sake as

[57:25] everything you have been doing for us
[57:27] Lord this is as far as I can go as human
[57:30] being with the ability that you have
[57:33] given me but when it comes to speak to
[57:36] your people to interpret your word it is
[57:39] not a work of a man it takes only the
[57:41] Holy Spirit to do it Lord may you be the
[57:44] one Speaking the one listening the one
[57:48] hearing the one interpreting the one
[57:51] translating Lord father May me and the
[57:54] audience move completely out of the way
[57:56] but may your blessing come down in a
[57:59] special way upon this church we seal the
[58:01] devil completely out in his army father
[58:04] May the Holy Spirit and the elect Angel
[58:07] only stay in this building Lord to
[58:10] minister to your children we commit
[58:12] everything unto their hand in the name
[58:14] of Jesus Christ amen Psalm 82 verse one
[58:21] the Bible says that God now we clear
[58:24] with this scripture now
[58:26] stands in the congregation of the mighty
[58:30] you might be
[58:31] seated and he God you remember last
[58:35] Sunday he's the judge amen he God judges
[58:40] among the
[58:42] gods so God is among
[58:46] Gods amen remember on on the short
[58:50] sermon that we have on uh on the wedding
[58:53] day we found out that when he comes to
[58:55] the term that God have to make men he
[58:57] say let
[58:59] us not let me make Men Let us make men
[59:04] in our own
[59:08] image
[59:10] amen are you the one starting I was
[59:12] trying to move on Amen we know that
[59:15] there was a light and I gave you the
[59:17] scripture in Timothy and in Psalm
[59:20] 1004 the bible say that God cover
[59:22] himself with light as a garment amen
[59:26] when this light was speaking in Genesis
[59:29] this light only say God say God singular
[59:33] say and he didn't say little God he say
[59:36] God like this and God sa and God made
[59:40] and God called and everything amen and
[59:43] everything that was creating was not in
[59:46] the image of God because an elephant
[59:50] doesn't look like God Amen animal don't
[59:54] look like God that's why I'm say God
[59:57] doesn't even enter animal that's what he
[59:59] said if you need a coat you see me my
[1:00:01] friend that's what he said God doesn't
[1:00:02] look like a
[1:00:04] bird the Holy Spirit took on the form
[1:00:07] like a bird amen but God is not a bird
[1:00:12] God look like
[1:00:14] this he looks like a human being amen
[1:00:18] amen so when he was creating everything
[1:00:20] he said God say God say God say Let
[1:00:23] There be this this but when he comes to
[1:00:25] man because man was a complete
[1:00:28] reflection of God man was made in the
[1:00:31] image and the likeness of God because
[1:00:34] when he was creating everything was male
[1:00:36] and female male and female but when it
[1:00:39] comes to man he said let
[1:00:42] us break it down so at that point we
[1:00:45] understand that God the God that was
[1:00:47] creating was not alone that's right he
[1:00:51] was not a him but a US
[1:00:56] you want to read it in the Bible or we
[1:00:58] so this God was a as so there was God
[1:01:03] and somebody else but the Bible say in
[1:01:06] the beginning was the
[1:01:09] word amen and the Word was with God and
[1:01:14] the Word was
[1:01:16] God so the ass is not only God but the
[1:01:20] as is also the
[1:01:22] word amen and everything that existed
[1:01:26] was created by this being but this being
[1:01:30] was not alone he was us and he created a
[1:01:34] man in his own image and man came up as
[1:01:38] a male and what meaning that in this
[1:01:41] entity of
[1:01:43] us we also have a male and a female and
[1:01:49] both of them are
[1:01:51] God yes sir the male God is right here
[1:01:56] it's the man Jesus Christ and the female
[1:02:00] God because it's a
[1:02:02] multiplication are called the
[1:02:05] gods and because he was the creation
[1:02:09] started by this entity right here that's
[1:02:12] why children of God have the ability to
[1:02:18] create amen so God Is Not the Only
[1:02:22] Creator God and his children create
[1:02:28] [Applause]
[1:02:30] amen amen amen a baby a baby a girl has
[1:02:37] the ability of a
[1:02:41] mother even though she's a baby
[1:02:44] everything that Mama has is already
[1:02:46] there but he still dormant he only take
[1:02:50] the process of time until he reach a
[1:02:53] certain maturity then mama will be
[1:02:57] expressed that's the same thing that
[1:02:59] happened to you you are
[1:03:03] gods and all he was taking was time in
[1:03:07] the process of time when time will come
[1:03:10] the godship in you will Express itself
[1:03:15] that's why Jesus said when you say to
[1:03:17] this mountain not him but when you say
[1:03:21] because
[1:03:24] you our
[1:03:32] gods are we together are we together
[1:03:35] you're doing good right now so I'm so
[1:03:38] happy let's go to verse seven my friend
[1:03:41] glory to God Amen if you thereare you
[1:03:44] can say amen amen jum to verse six I'm

[1:09:26] Luke
[1:09:28] 15:1 if you dare you can say amen amen
[1:09:32] the Bible say and he
[1:09:34] said a certain man has two sons you
[1:09:37] remember this now now we are clear with
[1:09:40] who are these two sons right what is the
[1:09:43] first
[1:09:44] one the Jews
[1:09:48] Israel we already established this my
[1:09:50] friend and the second one is what
[1:09:52] Gentiles gentiles
[1:09:55] amen this is where he's pulling his brde
[1:09:59] amen two sons Israel is the
[1:10:03] elder it's written in verse 31 and this
[1:10:07] is the younger that's how the scripture
[1:10:10] called them amen amen in other words
[1:10:13] it's going to be born later on the Bible
[1:10:16] says a certain man had two sons amen and
[1:10:22] the younger of them say to his father
[1:10:26] father give me the portion of good that
[1:10:29] falls to me amen remember father is not
[1:10:33] dead yet right this boy is asking for
[1:10:36] inheritance before death amen because
[1:10:41] normally the father must die I already
[1:10:43] gave you the scripture we went through
[1:10:45] this you only receive the will is
[1:10:47] enforced only at the death of the one
[1:10:50] who made the will that's what Paul say
[1:10:52] but this boy doesn't wait for the death
[1:10:55] no
[1:10:55] and we describe him as the Roman
[1:10:59] Centurion you remember that one you
[1:11:02] remember they don't wait for the Gentile
[1:11:04] time and the SAR phenician woman amen
[1:11:08] they didn't wait for Jesus to die and go
[1:11:10] to the
[1:11:11] Gentile to receive what they needed when
[1:11:15] Jesus was alive they approached Jesus
[1:11:17] Christ and Jesus say I'm not sent to you
[1:11:20] I'm sent to Israel that's not their
[1:11:22] problem they poke the door they open
[1:11:25] open the door and got what they needed
[1:11:27] and both of them receed something
[1:11:29] without a
[1:11:32] touch both of them Jesus never lay on
[1:11:35] anyone never lay hand on anyone he came
[1:11:38] by the spoken word and Jesus said that
[1:11:41] top of faith is never in
[1:11:45] Israel amen and the younger one which is
[1:11:48] a top of the Gentile right here is
[1:11:50] asking for an inheritance before even
[1:11:53] father is dead and we know that
[1:11:56] according to the to the book of
[1:11:58] Deuteronomy the Elder only get a double
[1:12:01] portion you remember that one I gave you
[1:12:03] the scripture last Sunday and the
[1:12:05] younger one get a third amen the Bible
[1:12:08] says amen verse 12 and the younger of
[1:12:12] them said to his father father give me a
[1:12:15] portion of the goods that fall to me and
[1:12:19] he divided to them his what living so
[1:12:22] the remaining of the living remember he
[1:12:25] belongs to the elder
[1:12:28] brother we clear he belongs to the Jews
[1:12:32] but watch what's going to happen amen
[1:12:34] verse 13 and not many days after after
[1:12:38] the younger son gather all together and
[1:12:42] took his journey into a what a far
[1:12:45] country he went into a far
[1:12:49] country let me make sure I got the
[1:12:52] scripture correct
[1:12:55] he went into a far country
[1:12:59] amen so he was far
[1:13:03] away from the
[1:13:05] father
[1:13:08] amen so the one who was closer to the
[1:13:12] father is the elder the son was far away
[1:13:16] and over there he got himself in trouble
[1:13:19] verse uh 13 and not many days after that
[1:13:23] the younger son gathered all together
[1:13:26] and took his journey into a far country
[1:13:29] and there wasted his substance with
[1:13:33] riers living and we found out that he
[1:13:36] was among
[1:13:37] harlots it's written in the Bible right
[1:13:39] there my friend if you jump down down to
[1:13:42] verse uh I'm trying to do this to save
[1:13:45] somebody so we can pick you up before I
[1:13:48] go I move far amen it is uh written um
[1:13:55] verse
[1:13:56] 30 yes verse 30 it's right there on
[1:13:59] verse 30 he destroy his inheritance with
[1:14:02] the Harlot amen now Backle up and let's
[1:14:05] go amen glory to God the Bible says this
[1:14:09] in the book of Exodus 4: 22 and thou
[1:14:14] shall say unto Pharaoh amen thus sayth
[1:14:17] the Lord Israel is my son we clear even
[1:14:23] my who my firstborn so the firstborn are
[1:14:26] the Jews and brother Bram in the
[1:14:28] revelation of Jesus Christ he say what
[1:14:32] from the Jews come on which are what the
[1:14:35] oldest the oldest and the what the first
[1:14:38] the first chosen of God through the
[1:14:41] cross come the blessing back to what the
[1:14:43] Gentiles so the cross took the blessing
[1:14:46] of the Jews and bring that back to the
[1:14:48] Gentile as we saw Jacob crossing the
[1:14:51] hand before the children of Joseph and
[1:14:54] brother brother say to get the bread
[1:14:57] blessing come through the cross from the
[1:14:59] Jew to the Gentile rejected they
[1:15:02] rejected the cross therefore he got the
[1:15:06] Gentile bread everybody clear so far and
[1:15:09] then in Ephesians chapter 2: 10 the
[1:15:13] Bible say for we are his workmanship you
[1:15:16] understand this now created in Christ
[1:15:20] not by Christ not outside of Christ we
[1:15:24] were created in Christ am remember at
[1:15:28] the beginning we were already in the
[1:15:31] eyes right here somebody also live with
[1:15:34] God in Christ are we together he said
[1:15:38] unto good
[1:15:40] works which God has before ordained that
[1:15:44] we should walk in them this work you
[1:15:48] don't do anything to
[1:15:50] them amen these work are ordained or
[1:15:54] pred destinated for you you
[1:15:57] automatically will do it all it takes is
[1:16:00] for that record to be activated amen all
[1:16:05] it takes for a young girls is for her to
[1:16:07] reach a
[1:16:08] teenage then the package that was in her
[1:16:11] begin to
[1:16:13] unfold amen are we together that package
[1:16:16] was there until the time of
[1:16:20] love we already went to this in the
[1:16:22] hotel my friend and when the time come
[1:16:25] then everything is triggered and then
[1:16:27] the system begin to work are we together
[1:16:31] Paul continue he say which he has
[1:16:34] ordained that we should walk in them
[1:16:37] according to John 15:1 16 the Bible say
[1:16:42] ye have not chosen
[1:16:45] me but I have chosen you and ordain you
[1:16:52] that ye should go and bring forth what
[1:16:55] fruit so these fruits are
[1:16:57] ordained that your fruit should What
[1:17:00] Remain that whatsoever he ask of the
[1:17:03] father in my name he may do What give it
[1:17:07] to you what you ask of the
[1:17:12] father I'm reading the Bible what you
[1:17:15] ask where of the father in what in my
[1:17:18] name it belongs to who to you it belongs
[1:17:22] to you he may give it to you and Paul
[1:17:25] continue in verse 11 he said wherefore
[1:17:28] remember that ye being in time P to who
[1:17:32] gentille In the Flesh remember In the
[1:17:35] Flesh amen who are called on
[1:17:39] circumcision by that which is called the
[1:17:41] circumcision in the flesh made by what
[1:17:44] because the Jews were circumstan and not
[1:17:47] the Gentile verse 12 that at that time
[1:17:51] ye were without Christ we were far away
[1:17:54] being alien in another country far away
[1:17:58] from the Commonwealth of Israel come on
[1:18:01] and stranger from the Covenant of
[1:18:04] Promise having no hope like the younger
[1:18:08] child and with God in the world but now
[1:18:13] in Christ Jesus ye who sometime were
[1:18:17] where far off remember the younger boy
[1:18:19] went to a far away country are we
[1:18:23] together we who are some come far off
[1:18:26] and made nigh by the blood of who Christ
[1:18:30] so it takes the blood to bring us back
[1:18:32] again to God are we together glory to
[1:18:36] God brother Bram says this in the deity
[1:18:39] of Jesus Christ he said now there is a
[1:18:43] picture of the Gentile Church coming
[1:18:45] into Christ because we were once aliens
[1:18:50] away from God only the Jews was the one
[1:18:54] to be saved but we being dead in Christ
[1:18:59] take on what Abraham's seed and our air
[1:19:02] according to the promise and Christ got
[1:19:05] a gentile bre that is exactly right so
[1:19:09] this father doesn't deal with one child
[1:19:12] but he's dealing with two sons one are
[1:19:15] the Jews and the other one are the
[1:19:17] gentille Paul in Romans 3: 29 and 30
[1:19:22] says is is he the god of the Jews
[1:19:26] only is he not also the of the Gentile
[1:19:30] and Paul answer he say yes of the
[1:19:33] Gentile also seeing it is one
[1:19:37] Goden which shall justify the
[1:19:39] circumcision the Jews by faith and the
[1:19:43] uncircumcision the Gentile through faith
[1:19:47] are we together but the problem is this
[1:19:50] in Roman
[1:19:51] 9:30 Paul say what shall we say
[1:19:56] then that the Gentile which follow not
[1:20:00] after righteousness we were not looking
[1:20:03] for God we were running away from God we
[1:20:06] were running away from the father we
[1:20:08] pack everything and went away from the
[1:20:10] father and live a promiscous life amen
[1:20:15] which follow not after righteousness
[1:20:18] have attain to righteousness in other
[1:20:20] word the one who was not even caring for
[1:20:23] it Hallelujah
[1:20:25] the one who was not even looking for it
[1:20:27] is the one who found
[1:20:29] [Applause]
[1:20:31] it don't worry my friend he says which
[1:20:35] follow not after righteousness have
[1:20:38] attend to what righteousness even the
[1:20:41] righteousness which is of what faith so
[1:20:44] the way we attain in righteousness is by
[1:20:47] faith are we together hold on my friend
[1:20:51] but
[1:20:53] Israel which follow after the law of
[1:20:57] righteousness they had the law they were
[1:20:59] living by the law the old the son that
[1:21:02] say that I follow all your
[1:21:05] commandment jum to the Bible so we can
[1:21:08] get this clear my friend jum to verse 29
[1:21:12] the Bible say and he answered say to his
[1:21:14] father what L these many years do I what
[1:21:18] serve thee who was serving God the Jews
[1:21:20] or the Gentiles the Jews okay neither
[1:21:23] transgress I at any
[1:21:26] time your commandment and yet you never
[1:21:30] gave me a kid that I may make Mary with
[1:21:33] my friends keep that in mind amen
[1:21:36] remember even the Rich Young Ruler he
[1:21:39] follow everything to the letter but he
[1:21:41] miss eternal
[1:21:43] life amen why did he miss eternal life
[1:21:47] the Bible says that Israel which follow
[1:21:50] after the law of righteousness has not
[1:21:53] attained to the law of righteousness
[1:21:56] wherefore in other word
[1:21:58] why because they s it not by what faith
[1:22:03] but as he were a what by The Works of
[1:22:05] the law for they stumble and The
[1:22:08] Stumbling what stone Israel thought with
[1:22:11] what they doing they will be entitled to
[1:22:14] receive
[1:22:16] righteousness let's go to the Book of
[1:22:18] Romans keep your finger where we are
[1:22:20] let's go to Romans so we can drive this
[1:22:22] my friend we moving very good it's going
[1:22:25] to kill the
[1:22:29] legalistic amen let's go to Roman 4 my
[1:22:33] friend it's a
[1:22:35] B52 amen after a while you will begin to
[1:22:38] hear bomb dropping left and right amen
[1:22:42] Roman 4 if you dare you can say amen
[1:22:44] amen Roman 4 let's start by verse two
[1:22:47] the Bible say for if we clear If Abraham
[1:22:53] were just jusy by
[1:22:57] works he has wherefore to do what to
[1:23:00] glory in other word he can glory and say
[1:23:02] you know what I did this that's the
[1:23:04] reason why I got this amen I work over
[1:23:08] time that's the reason why I got a pay
[1:23:11] so my pay goes with over time the more I
[1:23:15] work the more I get paid amen If Abraham
[1:23:19] receive it that way he would have
[1:23:21] Glory the Bible says for Abraham were
[1:23:26] just for If Abraham were justified by
[1:23:29] works he has wherefore whereof to Glory
[1:23:33] but not before who God God doesn't want
[1:23:36] you to Glory before

[1:23:44] scripture Abraham beli God not did
[1:23:49] something for God sir he was based on
[1:23:52] faith amen Abraham just
[1:23:56] believe not do anything just believe
[1:23:59] only believe he believe God Amen and he
[1:24:05] was counted to him for what righteous so
[1:24:08] as soon as he believ God Associated
[1:24:12] righteousness with Abraham so that Faith
[1:24:15] doesn't have anything about what you
[1:24:17] have done that's why the Bible say
[1:24:20] before the children were born even have
[1:24:23] not done good good and evil God say I
[1:24:26] love
[1:24:27] Jacob and when Jacob came he was doing
[1:24:31] bad
[1:24:33] works so if you go by words you're going
[1:24:36] to disqualify Jacob and qualify Esau but
[1:24:41] God was not looking at Works he was
[1:24:43] looking at
[1:24:46] Faith are we together are we together
[1:24:50] verse four now to him that works amen
[1:24:54] Amen to him that clock in and out to him
[1:24:57] that work is the reward not Recon of
[1:25:01] what gra but of what if you work they

[1:25:12] work God doesn't want it like that amen
[1:25:17] God give it to you when you didn't do
[1:25:20] anything amen so that everything you
[1:25:22] receive is Grace
[1:25:25] but not on work
[1:25:27] amen are we together amen are we
[1:25:30] together there is nothing that the young
[1:25:32] man have done to deserve a best robe
[1:25:36] actually he messed up he took the
[1:25:39] inheritance of the father and destroy it
[1:25:42] he deserved the bad robe but Grace
[1:25:45] provided the best
[1:25:48] robe so that child can never boast that
[1:25:52] I was a good child and that the reason

[1:30:10] must present myself as the
[1:30:13] justifier the justifier was a reserve to

[2:10:15] lat the Bible say and they shout and the
[2:10:19] voice of the trumpet and and the voice
[2:10:22] of the Archangel and the Trump of God
[2:10:24] brother Bram said Jesus does all
[2:10:28] three when he's coming down so when he's
[2:10:31] coming down he must give the
[2:10:35] message the voice of the arang and also
[2:10:38] the wedding Ser even though it will take

[2:12:07] the marriage there is a period of time
[2:12:11] hallah but the shout is already
