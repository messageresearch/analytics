he's the one who sucked it before amen good to see you back and good to see everybody back i know it was mother's day's and stars have to move around but they're back in order praise god amen everybody happy everybody caught up on the service you catch it pretty good i'm sorry i tried but somebody was pulling in a different direction so lord's willing will try to get how do you get sanctified amen so don't miss anything this is very important because this is where many of the message believers are stuck right there and they don't understand and it's a very big change because it's different than justification justification you justify you still remain sinner on the outside on your outlook you're still struggling but on the inside you already justify you receive a new heart but sanctification will change you completely until somebody can tell that this is a different person but yet it's not the holy ghost yet but it's the holy ghost working on you but it's not the holy it's not the feeling yet but it's still the work of the holy ghost trying to push you into the feeling amen blessed be the name of the lord tonight it's brother team hate on preaching who doesn't know brother tim hayton here almost everybody knows brother tim hayton he's pastoring here he was a deacon with us in living word he was a minister and he was a pastor before me so he's a brother he's home i told him i said brother team hate on you home you preach like home and you also pull like so you know how to pull right i don't have to teach you that amen so let's sing only believe and we call brother tim hayton and he's gonna take his liberty amen continue to pray one for another the days are a little bit difficult things are difficult business running difficult god's price going higher but we have a promise of the spoken word we have a god that knows how to take care of his children in the times of need there is nothing to panic god have everything under control amen so either you can look at the promises of god or you can keep looking at the god's price going higher one will give you blood pressure and will give you depression the other one will give you peace and god will take care of it amen brother branham said there is no virtue in worry worry will cause sickness there is no virtue so keep believing on the lord on the lord jesus christ regardless of what is happening god will take care of his children amen if we sit together here and we fellowship we can bring testimonies after testimonies of the things that the lord is doing amen we thought this is not going to work it worked we thought this is locked it worked all over so we see god every day and he's still there they're very present help in times of trouble amen only believe only believe all believe all things are possible only [Music] only believe all things are possible on the belief lord i believe i believe yes [Music] yes yes lord i believe and all things i sing it like this oh lord i received yes lord i received and all things are possible lord i received yes lord i received yes lord i received and all things [Music] play that softly let's just bow our heads father lord we approach you this evening we realize lord that we're not coming to in the presence of just a king but we're coming into the presence lord of the king of kings the songs of zion lord has been sung and it's it's we've worshipped you and we've we've opened a way for you to come now and you to take your word and minister and lord i i know i can't do that tonight i stand helpless so i'm here moving myself aside my mind is laying everything aside and i'm asking you lord to come tonight and take over these lips of clay to take over the thoughts lord the body the soul the spirit everything that i am may you take it over and may you speak lip to ear i still believe that you lord are that kind of god that you're still in the business of speaking lift to ear to those who love you and those who have been called according to your purpose lord as we heard your prophets say one time lord he said lord may you get into your word and to the speaker into the here and we'll know then lord that we will have heard from you so now lord we committed into your hands we asked the lord if we any of us have done anything father that would hinder you that would we as a sinner a trespasser iniquity we ask that it just be placed under the blood in jesus christ's name we ask it amen amen god bless you it's certainly good to see you and good man it's good to see some old familiar faces i told brother robert falbe i said i feel like i have come home tonight i feel like it's a homecoming for me you you don't realize how much i think of many of you uh that we have fellowship together through the years but god has allowed us and permitted us to go our separate ways but that's only for a time and a season because it won't be too much longer i really believe with all of my heart that eternity is just around the corner you know we've been we've been saying that for a number of years now we've been preaching it and believing it but somebody is going to fulfill it somebody's going to take a body change somebody is going to become everything that the word said she is supposed to become right no man can make you become that word i cannot make you become the word but christ himself who spoke the word it was through the lips of a prophet right but it was not the prophet himself that was doing the speaking it was god coming through human lips and breaking the word down to a place that it can change your mortal body i believe that with all of my heart i want to move into something quickly i don't want to take too much of your time many of you has worked and so i know what it's like being a pastor and seeing people's faces when they start getting tired but i believe for just a few minutes if we can move into the spirit realm i believe that time can can can cease for just maybe about 30 or 45 minutes to an hour and we'll just see how the lord will lead us one one verse of scripture and then i will let you be seated matthew 28 and 14. it's a little series that i've been in for some time now but there's been a few things that's just come out of it uh we'll read this and then i'll let you be seated matthew 28 and 14 these scriptures are becoming more real to me than ever before it says for many are called but few are chosen heavenly father lord now we have read your word and the rest now lord is up to you as you walked with the two lord and you and you broke the bread to them lord they recognized that you were with them now lord as you break the bread to us tonight may we realize that you are in our midst in jesus christ's name we ask it amen god bless you may be seated my wife sends her greetings she was going to come with me but you know she's she plays either the organ and the piano and and the pianist was down tonight with back trouble so she filled in at her at the post of duty but she does send her greetings and we bring greetings from agape tabernacle so i believe that we're one body we might be in different locations but the bible says that by one spirit not by one doctrine now but by one spirit are we all baptized into one body can you say amen to that and that is the the spirit of the lord jesus christ if i could take something tonight out of this little this little um scripture reading we've read the text but what we need tonight is we need the holy spirit to give us the context of the text can you say amen but i want to take a title of absolute truth versus relative truth and if i could give it a subtitle tonight i would like to call it running without a message absolute truth versus relative truth and tie and give it a subtitle of running without a message and we i believe we can look at this the scriptures i was talking to your pastor in the back and it's amazing to see how two men don't talk to each other for six months and then when you get to talking you're preaching right down the same line but it's not just happening here and it's not just happening in hickory but it's happening all over the world because the holy spirit is taking back charge of his church again god's true with men god if if i or brother shango does not stay submitted to the holy spirit i expect god to step us aside and put men in place that will get the job done why because we must be eunuchs we cannot plan plant our own ideology we cannot plant our own theology but it must be the pure unadulterated word of god and that because my idea will not change you brother shango's idea will not change you even brother branham's idea will not change you but the word itself delivered through men who have been submitted that's what's going to create a change in every son and daughter of god i did i told the church a while back i said i did not die for your sins i did not shed my blood for you and i do not own you i said but i will not have your blood on my hands because i'm going to tell you the truth if i have to preach to the four walls why because god is going to have a bride he's going to have an elect group of people and i found out that if you're a real son and daughter of god you might mess up you might fall flat on your face but you cannot have the word of god preached too hard to you are you with me now i believe that the spirit of god is identifying the very minute and the very second in which we're living the very hour in which we're living and i i want to look tonight i want to read maybe some scriptures in matthew 22 and this is where we're going to pull this from absolute truth versus relative truth matthew 22 and verse starting at verse 8 and we'll finish up on 14 and then we'll look at this little subject and here in just a moment i want to define absolute and relative and you'll see where we're going with this verse 8 says then he saith to his servants the wedding is ready so man didn't set this wedding are you with me now no no no prophet no pastor no teacher no apostle set the wedding this was god himself is the one that set the wedding and he said the wedding is ready but they which were bidden were not what found worthy now that puts the ministry in there as well as the laity because god is not a respecter of persons now watch this because some made an excuse some had their own idea of it some had their own version there was more places now at the table maybe you don't think this way but i believe that the last seat hasn't come in and i don't necessarily believe it's sitting in a message church it might be the prostitute on the street it might be the drug addict that's in rehab it might be the drunkard on the street it might be somebody sitting in a denominational church why because god knows those that are his see god's through with the me and my for and no more attitude i don't know who is and who ain't i'm just going to cast the net and if they're on the street we need to be willing to witness into them you know what's happened we become so elevated in our doctrine we become so elevated in our teaching that we thought we knew something but come to find out we don't i listen the older i get i know very little anymore what i do know is i know him and him alone and what he reveals to me that's going to produce all my ideas ain't going to produce nothing all my ideas is going to get people tangled up i can't even keep my own self straight at times i'm depending upon the holy spirit to lead me he said when he the spirit of truth is come he will lead you into all truth what is truth the truth is the person of jesus christ in the form of the holy spirit today i asked the church i said somebody tell me what the message is [Music] well i received the word for my day i said which word whose version of the message are you going to receive you've got this version you've got this doctrine i said if what we believe does not produce the life of jesus christ we have the wrong message oh yes i said we have the wrong message listen young people doctrine ain't gonna save you doctrine ain't gonna fill you with the holy ghost brother branham said it like this he said in order for paul to get the holy ghost he said he had to lay aside every bit of his teaching i asked the church i said have you received the holy ghost since you believed that the seventh seal was open have you received the holy ghost since you believed that god sent a prophet see we don't get to bypass any of these things god does not change this prescription he never will change his prescription the word which is the light reveals the unbelief in our lives and we either have to line up or we ain't gonna make it listen it's not based on what you believe but it's based on who you know are you with me if you don't know to know him as life not to know the word because you can know the word from here brother branham said you can learn this message that we're trying to teach you can have it locked into here but if it don't ever produce something it's it's another seed is what it is oh hallelujah what says she said go you therefore into the highways [Music] oh my and as many as you shall find bid them to the marriage in other words they ain't given a specific invitation but it's the whosoever will oh hallelujah whosoever will you know what i will not re i will not separate the message from this because this and the message are one that's our problem because we have separated it from this we've been able to interject man's ideas into it and it's caused confusion it's called shipwrecks it's caused people to backslide but if we'll preach this in the unadulterated form it will reproduce the life of jesus christ every single time oh hallelujah i might not make it but it ain't gonna be because i'm not preaching the truth hallelujah listen so those servants went out into the highways and they gathered together as many as they found i like this both good and bad both good and bad oh hallelujah both good and bad and the wedding was furnished with guests hallelujah and when the king now watch this came in to see the guest there was a man he saw there a man which had not owned a wedding garment if i could say it this way that man heard the same message he quoted the prophet's quote but he thought he had a better idea of it and you know what he found himself speechless in the midst of the king oh hallelujah listen it wasn't just like he wandered up he heard the invitation as well but he found a better way and he thought he could get in except god's provided way and it will not work god's provided way ain't my way god's provided way is not your way god's providing way wasn't even brother branham's way god's providing way was his own way hallelujah are you with me now he was found and he was come to bed but he came his own way now watch this god and he said unto him friend he never called him a heathen he never caught him a heart of it he said friend you heard the same message but you put your own interpretation to it listen if you're a son and daughter of god you don't mean me to interpret the word of god listen how many times have you heard a sermon that brother brandon priest said you did not understand it why even though he was a divine revealer of the word there's only one that could break a revelation to you and that's the one that birthed you that's the one that chose you that's the one that called you to be a son and daughter of god it takes god himself that delivered the message to a prophet to break the same word to you or it's not the same message hallelujah how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless then the king said unto the servants oh hallelujah bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth for many are called in other words many had invitation to the wedding supper but there was just a handful that's been chosen to sit at the king's table because he could look down through the stream of time you know why you can say i've been chosen you looked he looked down through the stream of time and he watched when the unadulterated word was presented to you he's seen your reaction to it and therefore he said irregardless of your mistakes oh hallelujah irregardless of your failures irregardless of your iniquities when you know you shouldn't have done it but you did it anyway i have chosen you i have called many but i have chosen you oh you know what we're in the same place that the disciples were when jesus turned he gave his word in john 66 66 in mark chapter 10 or luke chapter 10 it said he the harvest was plenteous right it was ready and he said he appointed some but they were not called they were not chosen to it why because in john 6 when he gave them the hard sayings they turned and walked away and then he turns to look at the one he's chosen he said i have chosen 12 of you and one of you is a devil that's where we're at right now god already knows who you are but he's got to reveal to you who you are because you've got to stand in this hour they ain't no man can decide this for you your pastor don't get to decide this for you it's you and god and god alone you can argue with me all you want to on marriage and divorce you can argue with me all you want to on the seals but if god don't come and bring you revelation you've got pure intellect and it will take you straight to the gates of hell but he said i will build my church up on a revelation and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it hallelujah he's building it up on christ in you not christ justin a prophet but christ in you the hope of glory hallelujah oh hallelujah maybe i'm just getting too old or i'm getting too bold but i don't have nothing to lose i don't care about being the most popular preacher and i ain't after money cause i ain't in it for the money and i ain't after another woman god gave me the woman that i need i mean it because he called me chose me to it and because he first loved me now i don't have a choice but to sound the trumpet why not because i want to not because listen i don't care what people think of me anymore i just want to know are you pleased with me lord oh hallelujah yes sir hallelujah you know what we've done we've cared too long who thought about what about us i don't care what you think about me i told the church i said i'm not here to please you at agape tabernacle i don't care what you think about me i wanna if it skins me let it skin me if it skins you let it skin you but let the word of god be word of god coming to adoption coming to adoption it's not the big sins anymore it's those little bitty things it's husbands can i get real serious now it's husbands do you love your wife are you hearing me that the way christ loved the church and can give yours i told listen i don't know why i'm here but we're going here now i told the brothers in the church i said don't even ask your wife to get in order unless you in order first you got brothers that run around and they're so revelated and they don't even know how to treat that queen that god gave them behind close to shame on us being if we want to don't care about what you know about marriage and divorce i don't care what you know about the seals i don't care you know that he was revelation 10 7. he was malachi he was revelation 3 14. he was malachi 4 5-6 paul said though i understand all mysteries and i have not the love of god glory to god this is the gospel you know what the devil has done for years can i tell you what the devil's done for years he's hitting our churches under doctrine he's hit in our churches under teaching men's ideas he's head oh my you know what happens but god says i've had enough i'm coming down to your doorstep who do men say that i am well some say that you're a zionist son say you're jesus he said but who did you say oh hallelujah it's personal revelation who do you say that i the son of man i told the church i said i refuse to keep god at the pulpit anymore there is no holy priesthood we're all holy over all sinners listen to this now an absolute is defined as complete and total not limited in any way having unlimited power free from imperfection free from being governed by men's ideas or the characteristic of a ruler or authority or a group of men do you realize you can sit in church and be a one man or one woman breathing denomination not in a mess brother bam said the message would never denominate but he never said those devils wouldn't worm their way into our churches brother jason rorke he's a minister at the church he said something i use and i hang on to he says you know what we've done for years he said we've had favorite quotes and he said we've used them like a concealed carry weapon he called it a concealed carry quote when somebody says something bam we quoted off the hip pam i got you bam i got you maybe you ain't got nobody you know who it's going to be that makes it it's going to be the nobodies it's going to be the nobodies and the preachers and the laity [Music] oh hallelujah it's completely from constitutional or other restraint it's standing alone without being modified oh god don't need my interpretation to it he don't need your interpretation to it he interprets his own word by bringing it to pass he said there's gonna be a bride and right now because she's moving to adoption are you hearing me the word is bringing you and i to adoption it's beginning to scrutinize what we watch it's beginning to scrutinize our very thoughts it's beginning to scrutinize how we think about one another [Music] maybe i'm crazy but this is what i believe now watch this it's being self-sufficient and free of external references or relationships see this thing ain't no buddy system it's been a buddy system for quite some time we still got a few preachers i'm just going to be honest it carries that same spirit that they think oh well worry i'm sorry you ain't hit you know who's it that little housewife that thinks she's nothing that that that little that little teenager it's got the holy ghost and god do i even have it am i i'm struggling to even believe if i've been born again god says hang on a little bit i'm going to show you something there brother boom said there is no big eyes and there are no little used we are all equal on the same playing field oh hallelujah so when we think of an absolute it's constant the supreme court of the land when they make a ruling it stands most the time it never gets changed why because it's of the highest order it's an absolute of the land think about a traffic light it's an absolute it turns red and traffic's flowing from the other side and you try to go through it what happens you find out real quick that it is an absolute a bullet leaving a gun is an absolute ain't nothing can turn it back why because it's going to hit its target see and understand that an absolute carries penalties with it now watch this when you look at relative or if i could use the other word relational the only definition i found in the very definition says it's not an absolute an absolute stands alone but a relative it's not independent or absolute watch this now when we look at relational and i want to bring this home here for just a minute the word relational means relating to using or being a method of organizing data into a database so that is perceived by the end user as a set of tables so if i could say it this way it's a method by which information is put to together so a person can use it that is not an absolute because a set of tables when a new discovery is made it can be changed i said it can be changed but not with an absolute you know why because somebody could come along and provide a better method it's relative it's not an absolute so absolute truth i want you to understand is by revelation it stands alone it's independent he told peter he said no man has told you this but my father which is in heaven hath revealed this to you and upon this will i build my church oh hallelujah a relative or relational truth of a cassette this way is a study of spiritual things from a formal or an intellectual perspective and a gathering or collection or a collection of ideas so a person can use it for their benefit and when i need it to fit me again i'll change it again to make it fit my under brother branham said we can never bring god down to our understanding of the new birth he said we have to come up to god's understanding of the new birth in order to get it are you with me we can never bring god down but we got to come up to god and the only way that you and i can come up it must be he is the one that drawing he paul said it is the goodness of god that leadeth thee to repentance you can't even repent except god calls you to repentance when i seen this relation or relative truth i said jail that's like assimilating doctrines assimilating quotes and data and going through and collecting these pieces and putting it together and drawing a picture but the problem is i see a lot of times it just don't produce god when brother brown come on the scene he preached he preached the message it produced jesus christ and if your belief in my belief i told the church i said you say i believe doctrine i believe this i believe this i said if your life could be played out in a movie after you said that i said would we see the life of god being on this place if not it's just a belief it's an idea and you might as well be a catholic you might as well be a lutheran setting in a message church see the message isn't what i'm coming to find out the message that i thought was the message wasn't the message listen some say well the word is my absolute some says the message is my absolute some says the bible is my absolute some people say well brother branham is my absolute and i say to that that's only partial truth because if it's not revealed to you somewhere along the line something's going to come in on you i said something's going to come in on you and now you're going to change it to fit your condition instead of letting god come to the condition and change it i said if somebody can convince you into it somebody will convince you out of it i'm not looking for proof because if i find proof god somebody else will give me a better proof i'm looking for revelation from god himself because when he gives it no man can take that from me matthew 24 listen to this and except those days should be shortened there should be no flesh saved but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened now watch this but if any man shall say unto you lord christ is here christ is in my doctrine are there you got to go hear this brother you got to go to this camp you gotta go to this meeting no you just gotta find him in your word you find god where you're looking for him i'm not against any of those things but why can't you find god here if you're looking for some preacher to bring god to you oh my god i'll let that preacher go away then if any man shall say unto you lord hear us christ are there he says believe it not oh hallelujah for there shall arise the false christ and false prophets and shall grow show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible i said if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect listen somebody is not going to deceive me with trinitarianism not going to deceive me with three gods are you with me now somebody is not going to see me because they say it's not true and turn away from him but where the deception lies i said where the deception lies how can two preachers take the same message and the same quote and make it say two entirely different things the deception is not coming out there but the deception is right in our own churches it don't matter to me anymore god has opened my eyes and i see it according to the scriptures the deception is not out there but the deception is right amongst us and the only way you're going to discern what's going on is you're going to have to have the holy ghost and if you don't have the oil you better get it you better not hang on to something because you believe x and i believe this a lot of people has believed this and a lot of people has believed that but do they have the real this and do they have the real that which is the life of god himself [Applause] behold i have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chambers come over here brother and this don't even have to be ministry this can be one lent you know let me tell you what i see let me show you what the lord showed me if what they're showing you don't line up with the word see many people know this real well but i'm finding not too many people know this very well believe it not verse 27 as far as the lightning cometh out of the east and shining even into the west so shall also the coming of the son of man be for wherever the carcass is watch there will the eagles be gathered together where is he saying where the carcass is we're the real food of god he said if it were possible [Music] where did satan come down in in the guard he came down in god's creation and brought the first deception he didn't give eve some different word he changed one word of the act he changed one word of the original word to the church of that day and when it did it produced death that's the reason you're sick today that's the reason you're having struggles today because one word was changed listen deception comes not apart from the word but it tries to come through the word i'm going to read you a quote we know this i've got so much i'm going to try to skim over it but you're making it real easy tonight to just get out of the way when brother branham talks about the church knowing who she is listen to what he said there's four things and i told the church i said there's four parts to this quote and we got to look at all four parts of it well when she recognizes who she is she'll become an invincible army that's only part of it listen to what he says right here he said he knows that if the people get the true revelation first of the true church that's number one and number two is and what she is and what she stands for you know what god's doing he's doing every one of us like he did with elijah in the bible he's making you stand alone with him first and you feel like you're the only one that's seeing it he's you oil ain't nobody everybody else is turned away but i'm the only one god says quit crying i've got a whole bunch more that ain't turned back yet but i had to get you to stand with me alone it's not a buddy system it's between you and god and god alone and when you stand then all of a sudden now you're fit to fight because you're not going to depend upon somebody else and the other brother sees it another brother sees it and then we begin to leak up as the army of god god back in flesh again and we're not going to be swayed by every wind of doctrine but we're going to have spirit and truth you can have the truth but you could your churches can be devoid of the spirit of god and it's still dead even though every service the truth is being preached the right quotes the right scripture but he told the woman at the well he said you don't even know what you're worshiping she quoted him moses message but she did not have revelation of it he said they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army said if they hears the third part get a true revelation of the two spirits of the two spirits working within the framework of the christian church i told the agape tabernacle i said let your pastor bring this home this morning i said we've got to discern the two spirits working within the framework of the church [Applause] i said the church oh i can see where you're off but i can't ever see where i'm [Music] off you know what i told agape tabernacle i said i don't have all the answers and i'm not afraid to tell you i don't have all the answers that keeps me out of i said but i'll tell you one i'm in contact with the one who's got them all i said whatever you have need of your pull i said god will give a man an answer and he don't even have a clue what he's doing why because it's god coming to his wife a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church watch this and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit i'm sorry but there is no more ride in the fence post anymore it's not between you and some gifted preacher anymore well i just don't want to hurt the feelings i told the church i said i'd rather hurt you i said if you can get mad at me it get mad enough for me to examine and see if i'm telling you the truth i said don't be stuck here swallowing what i preached to you every sunday you need to be home reading your bible you need to be home listening to the message for yourself to make sure i'm preaching you the truth listen that's how the devil has been able to get into our churches for so long because we have all including the preachers been too lazy and we cannot recognize when the devil comes in because we don't know the word of god by the spirit of god [Applause] you don't ever have to ask me back if you don't want to listen to this when god found gideon he found gideon hiding you know why he found him hiding he found this little quaking believer and he said if god be with us then where are all the miracles at listen i'm not going to take the time because i don't want to take your time but i want to just address this he said did not the lord so he was asking god he wasn't asking the prophet now he wasn't asking the preacher he wasn't asking the pastor he wasn't asking a missionary apostle or a minor prophet he was asking god to himself he said if it be the lord that brought us up from egypt he said but now the lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hand of the midianites and because he asked god personally i said because he asked god personally god came to him and began to talk to him oh hallelujah and god begins to talk to him a little bit and he tells him it's just surely i will be with thee and thou shall smite the midianites as one listen gideon had what he had been taught of moses's message are you with me now do you realize when the pharisees argue with jesus you realize they were quoting moses's message to him where do you think they got their traditions from it wasn't some made up something but the affairs we pharisees they had a collective the history says it was eclectic ideas in other words they took moses's message and they began to mix other things within it and it produced their own relative religion but when god in flesh stepped back on the scene they would come to him quoting moses's message but god would say but i say unto you and if it wasn't saving for the cause of fornication this is the only reason and that same spirit will stand today and argue with the word face to face why because we all want our we have all gone astray hallelujah gideon built an altar and called it jehovah shalom god of peace who removes fear verse 25 says and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto him watch this take thy father's block even the second bullock of seven years old and throw down the altar of baal that thy father the one who knew moses and cut down the grove that is by it the reason for gideon having a relative or a relational truth and not an absolute it was because of his father that come before him his father was trying to worship jehovah and belle at the same time and the bible says that a double-minded man is unstable in all not some but in all of his ways gideon had been taught a relative or relational truth not and it took contact with god himself to give him an absolute if you ever meet him it'll make you tear down every altar in your life that's not right it will it'll make you examine everything that you do and you know what it'll do it'll allow the two spirits you know what allow you to identify the two spirits working within your mind oh my i ain't worried about you i'm worried about me you know immediately what we do i was preaching in the church just some time back and i was preaching and under discernment i could hear certain names that was being popped up because people was applying i said stop what you're doing don't you do that i said i'm not preaching against men but i'm preaching against the spirit that's god and then defiled us listen moses had knowledge that he was a deliverer but when he tried it on his own it killed one egyptian but when he met the pillar of fire when he met the one that told his mama see it was second-handed religion for moses at one time moses you're a proper child god's called you deliver and he walks out with his chest stuck out and he kills one egyptian and then the people come back and said who are you are you going to tell us what to do you who can and he said he knew that he was discovered listen but one one thirty second span of time in the presence of god changed that man that's what produced the deliverer and if the bride of jesus christ ever gets produced it's going to be not because she's laying in the revel in the presence of some man's revelation but it's because she's going to be laying in the presence of the soe and the spirit of god [Music] malachi 4 5 and 6 there's three parts to it i the lord will send unto you elijah the prophet we've been able to identify the lord we've able to identify the elijah but you got to identify the you [Music] you have to identify the you you have to allow the spirit of god to put you in that scripture verse if not it's relational truth it's relative truth and when somebody can come along they'll they'll convince you and change you right out of it are you with me now oh my what about paul man well you talking about somebody intelligent you're talking about somebody that knew moses's message that could quote it from front to back that would tie everybody up in knots and oh wow we can't compete with that what are we going to do with that and then paul when he met the pillar of fire he said for i was alive without the law once he said but when the commandment came sin revived and i died and the commandment which was ordained to life he said i found it to be unto what death oh my it wasn't what he thought it was when the revelation come and that's the way it is with every son with every daughter of god a lot of times when it comes it come and it wasn't what we thought it was we thought the table has been full for years well i believe the message and i believe this doctrine and this camp was grazed up and this camp was raised up and this camp was right up well i'm the one that's got the balance you've got to hear what i've got to say you know what brother branham said that's the reason the church with god spewed her out she would no longer be the mouthpiece of god why because her own ideas was being given utterance it wasn't allowing god himself to utter the truth that's the reason brother branham said she'll be the final voice to the final age under her prophet messenger [Music] let me ask you a question what are you following tonight are you following brother branham come on now [Music] was elisha following elijah it looked like he was in the beginning he poured hands on elijah right he heard every word that he said but there come a point in time when he said i want what you have are you with me if you don't ever hunger and thirst after what the prophet had what you've got is dead intellect are you with me now elijah said you've asked a hard thing he said but if you see me when i go he said you can have the double portion listen there was all kinds of other voices that come out brother kelly and they begin to try to sidetrack him hey don't you know this about the messenger don't you know your messenger is going up today listen god takes the scriptures and identifies today in the hour and we're living in why because it's the two spirits still living today and just as sure as the enemies working amongst us don't worry the spirit of god is one step ahead of the enemy why because he is the master chess player he's already got the devil checkmated don't you know that your master's going up don't you know this about the prophet don't you know this he said i know be still and be quiet he was no longer following a man but he was following the word that comes straight out of a prophet's mouth are you hearing me when he got over there watch what he had to do he had to take off his own intellect now picked up the same spirit that was on the prophet in other words he had to die to what he thought was right he had to die what he thought somebody else was right he had to die to proper theology he couldn't listen to any other voice why he was not listening to the voice of the man but the spirit of god spoke to him through a man and he said i'm going all the way he watched when elijah went up when the mantle fell down he walked over like this and he picked up the man on notice he never said where is elijah but he said where is the god of elijah see he had the revelation of what it's about and the bible says that he smoked the jordan and the same god that was with elijah was the same god that was with that prophet now and the bible said that the jordan opened oh my when he come across jordan those same ones that was looking at a man says where is elijah they said pre-adventure god left him on a mountain somewhere said let us go find him he said don't go but they wouldn't listen to the word of the hour they had to go find their own way they had to go look for their own idea and watch this he was waiting on them when they come back across he said did i not tell you not to go they could not recognize that god had transitioned his spirit just like they could not recognize when it was in the temple and the holiest of holies moved to a place built by hands to a tabernacle that was not built by hands it was by virgin birth they could not recognize it hallelujah oh my i am not following a man i hear the voice of a man when i press play but i am fully following the words of god almighty himself and it's taken me all the way to the end are you with me [Applause] oh hallelujah let me just let me touch on this and i want to skip down this do you realize that when the people wanted a king it was not according to the word of god god gave him a prophet god gave him his word to live by but they said no we are the one that wants a king we still got the spirit of kings that tries to set himself up in the message oh come on now listen you know what i'm finding when things like this are preached i look at people and i watch them go finally somebody had enough courage to say it oh there's problems in the message but it ain't been the message and it ain't been the prophet it's been what men has interjected into it to make it and you know whose fault it is it's been the ministry's fault and it's been the laity's fault for not holding men accountable to the truth the bible says in the i don't know if it was the ephesians or the galatians i believe it was or maybe if thessalonica but they searched the scriptures daily and they found them to be liars why because they had the same spirit of god revealing the truth to them telling them what was true when they chose saul now i want you i'm not gonna you can go home and read first and second samuel i've been first in second samuel now for two months preaching out of it i just can't i ask god i god said let me see what's going on today and i don't want just to quote lord i said but i want you to show me where it's at in the bible show it to me in the bible i want to see it for myself right here i don't have any problem taking brother graham's word but i want to see it according to this are you with me and so what you see with saul he had a connection to jehovah but he did not have a relationship with jehovah his connection to jehovah was through a prophet he did not have an absolute truth but it had a relative or a relational truth because when the words come to him through a prophet and said kill all all the amalekites because it was relational and not absolute then he began to change the word and then when god sent the prophet back and said what is this noise that i hear in my ears he said i have done all that he argued with god's prophet why because it was not absolute it was relative truth [Music] and then he blames the people [Music] that's in the bible go read it for yourself well the people kept back what they thought was best for you god wasn't holding the people accountable he said so i told you to do this you were the leader of them and you didn't do it you know how he pulled the people into himself amen here you can do it better than me he cut a sacrifice up and he said all that don't follow saul and samuel let them be like this beast he put fear upon the people and he drew the now watch that tactic is only going to last so long because now when the enemy come in like a flood when the philistines god allowed it that way when the philistines come up against him now he's afraid and the people have scattered from him and now what he does he goes and takes the place of a prophet are you with me and he goes out and offers a sacrifice and samuel comes to him because samuel didn't come when he wanted him to are you with me now he didn't come when he wanted him to but when he showed up he said because he was delayed i went watch what he said i forced jesus he forced something he should not have done he should have left it alone and waited on god to do the job he had a relative or a relational truth but it was through a prophet but now david on the other hand are you with me before god ever sent samuel to anoint him he already had a relationship on the back side of the desert now if you notice when the people chose they chose saul god gave them their choice and he anointed that man with a vile or a judgment of oil but when it comes to david the bible says he anointed him with a horn which represents the power and when the enemy come in god sent his choice in the battle he listen oh my listen saul tried to put his relative or relational truth upon god's servant and the bible says he has saved or attempted to go and he started off with that doctrine and he said i don't think this will fit he said because i have not tested it because i have not tried it he said i will tell you what i have tried i was on the backside of a desert and one of a lion and a bear coming after my father's sheep and he delivered him into my hands he still had the words of a prophet but he had a relationship with jehovah himself and that was the difference oh my god you say oh that's for the preachers oh no that's for everybody that is for everybody but you know what saul wasn't lost [Music] you realize that when you know why he had a connection to god through a prophet but not god himself because when god removed the prophet out of his life he could not get a hold of god are you with me and the bible says he went and consulted a witch oh guess what god did to him who do you see oh i see god he said oh that's that's samuel do you realize when the prophet came back to him he couldn't tell him anything different than what he already told him he said why are you disturbing me seeing that you are an enemy of god you didn't kill it when you had a chance listen if brother branham would come back today he couldn't say any more than what he's already said because you know why if we ain't going to listen to him now we wouldn't listen to him if he was standing in the flesh [Applause] you say well where's that at brother branham said you say oh if jesus was where he said no your attitude now would determine what it was if he was standing in the flesh then are you with me now i ain't mad at nobody but the devil i love everybody but listen i'm if god allows me not within myself but as the revelation comes i god has raised you and i both up you may not be a preacher but god has raised you up to tear the devil's kingdom down are you with me oh my he ate with the prophet he communed with the prophet he talked with the prophet he had all these things but when it come down to the acid test there was no revelation oh my god let me just skip on down it's a getting late and i need to uh i need to bring this brother man says now i admit that people study too much and go too far ahead and try to think too hard and sometimes have mental breakdowns on the count of studying about the lord he says you must quit that he said you don't have to do that he said the only thing you have to do is fall in love with him and just go right on loving him i think many people have been in love with the prophet i love the prophet if he was here you know what i'll be doing i got questions i want answered i'd be on the list to get an interview i ain't lying to you i told the church i said don't worry i ain't leaving the message and i ain't leaving what he said but i'm leaving every man-made idea of it behind are you with me because as i hear the voice that voice is bringing instruction and it's telling me what to do it's telling me how how how i need to live my life and how we need to get prepared for a rapture how what we need to do to get prepared brother branham says when she and the invisible union of the bride of christ he said when she goes to dropping herself back in line with the word he said watch the scriptures then he said there will be a message that will sweep out and catch her he said when she begins to have a revival oh i like that one because it chokes the days the revival's over with i told the church i said if you think revival's over that's because you're dead already because listen we're the spirit of god there's liberty you know what we need we need some more old-fashioned pentecostal experiences again and brother branham said you can learn this message that we're trying to teach are you with me now we can be educated into it but when you say the word pentecost people seize up like you stuck a whole lemon in their mouth because they don't understand what it is without pithy because you can't even see the message of the hour you know why people don't want gifts in the church because they don't want the sin being called out brother listen people says brother branham god said god brother said brother they say brother branham said that god put the gifts on the shelf he never said that i did a study on it he never said that he said i'm longing for a day when the love of god can come into the church and it just takes care of the problem but he said those five ministering gifts the fivefold ministry and the nine spiritual gifts was put into the church to keep it clean until the coming of the lord [Music] somebody says and i'm spiritual gifts ain't here i say i'm sorry you're lying you know why and i don't say this i don't know why god has let me experience it but i have experienced every single one of them not trying to but at different points in my life in the last 15 years it's happened without asking so now that's like you telling me there ain't no such thing as chicken and you ain't never ate it but i have the word is primary but when people will not hear the word take take another gift well brother branham put him on the shelf after the word come no he didn't no he didn't men put him on the shelf men stuck him in the corner somewhere oh wow i told brother stephen in a study i said i have had to have a spiritual detox in the last five years because god has begun to change what i thought i knew and if you ain't willing to lay down everything that you know and start all over again i just wonder amen it's not trying to push into something or make yourself something that you're not just go ahead and let god push you in the way he wants to just yield yourself commit yourself and walk on happy singing and rejoicing he said the bible said that all things work together for the good of them that love him so just be sure that you love him he says and that's the only thing you have to old brother tim i got to know is about the seals no you don't you just got to know him and you just got to be in love with him that's the only thing that matters because he will teach you what you see we we majored for 20 30 40 50 years on what we did know or what we didn't know but i'm coming to find out what i thought a lot of people know they didn't really know in the first place are you with me they may have had good knowledge paul said though i understand all mysteries though i can quote it frontwards and backwards but i do not have the love of god he said it is because you know what somewhere when that voice stops sounding then that doctrine is going to stop sounding but if it was ever the spirit of god it'll live on in the hearts of a son and a daughter of god see when it's relational or relative you can change it to fit your feelings and can fit your ideas oh my let me give you one more place and a quote and i'll i'll go on i want to touch on this oh i got too much let me just roll down here i want you to think about this absalom for just a moment here when absalom he thought he could do a better job than david and he probably had some better ideas he probably had better ways to rule the kingdom than david did but the problem was he hadn't been chosen i said he hadn't been chosen to be a king and the bible said he had no seat after him but in the king's dell he reared up his own pillar or his own message or his own doctrine in his own idea and do you know god let that go along for a while because you know what he was doing when that happened he was revealing who had it and who didn't he revealed who was going after the real king i told the church i said don't thank you just because you believe god sent a prophet that you're going to sit at the wedding supper uh not going to happen i said the devil believes the same things in tremble don't tell me don't if he believes that there's one god then he triples don't tell me he don't believe the seventh seal is open don't tell me he don't believe that god sent a prophet don't tell me he don't believe all the scriptures he just can't make it work but he believes it all why do you think he's trying to discredit it that's why he wants to discredit because if he can discredit it takes the power right out of you you want you want this brother branham said it like this he said if those egyptians could ever got the rod out of the hand of moses he said they'd have them whip he said and if he could ever get the deity out of the name of jesus christ he said he'll have the church whip don't tell me he won't try to discredit the word and if he can't make you disbelieve it he'll make you run over too far to the other side where you believe what i believe i got the truth and you don't have it i'm done with that nonsense i ain't afraid to say i don't know a whole lot but i know him and what i do know these revealed to me i know it and you can't take it from me but now catch this let me just phrase it without reading the scriptures for the sake of time but when joe had killed absalom okay there were two men if i could say it this way there were two messengers right one was named kushai and the other one was named a high mass now joab says cush i i want you to come i want you to take a message to the king a high mass when he come up he said can i take it he said you're not running with good tidings today are you with me now maybe you've heard this before but i've seen this and i got kind of excited and and so he says he says kusha i want you to take the message i want you to take this message to the king now notice he wasn't taking the message to the people and he wasn't taking the message to another preacher he was taking the message back to the king listen to me now and so kush i or a high mass he hears the exact same words that joab spoke to kushai he heard he was in the presence and physically he heard the same exact words that joab gave to cushi and so cushion you know he's not the swiftest runner he's not the fast but he's just plodding along and uh-hum ass he's he's got full of zeal he's all excited he said joab can can i run he said why do you want to run saying you don't have a message but i'm here i'm fighting he said let me take the message and he said well run you're not going to listen so run on anyway and because he was so full of zeal he overran cushi and the watchman was standing in the gate and all of a sudden david is standing there in the water david was standing at the gate and a watchman tells david he said look i see a runner and he said me think it's it's the running of a high mass david said he's a good man with good tidings in other words he's going to bring me a good message oh my now listen to me now and when he gets there he falls down oh long live the king that's that's i'm just going to say in my own language destroyed all your enemies and i can see david saying yeah i know that he killed the bear he killed the lion he killed goliath he told me that he would make my enemies my footstool he's just listening but he was wanting something very specific very specific do you have the revelation a high mass that i am looking for that's the reason the bible says study to show thyself approve a workman not unto man but unto god he was looking for a very specific revelation and now as he's coming in the watchman says oh i see another runner he says it looks like cushion he said oh he's another good man with tidings and he comes running in and if you'll go back and look their salutations are real similar go look at it go look at it they're real similar all he had to do was repeat what he heard joab say but when david said what am i looking for he said i don't know he said i heard a great comet i heard a great noise i heard a voice i heard a shout but i don't know what it means watch david just looked at him and he said stand aside and now he's standing and waiting for kasha to come and kushai comes in and he gives a similar greeting and he says what about absalom see he actually heard the message he actually got the interpretation he said is absalom he said let all of thy enemies which is what a high mass said god's killed you and he said let all of thy enemies be as this young man one was running with a message and the other one was running with out a message one had relative truth and the other one had absolute truth let me read you a quote before i leave here both ministry and laity must make sure that we're running with a message it does not matter what i believe if time tarries and i get an old man and i come down to where i have excelled my last earthly breath it is not going to matter what i believe about the message when i cross the river what's going to matter is do i know him in the power of it do you realize up until job got in the condition that he was in you wonder why you go bad through bad things well you wonder why we fall down and mess up and seem like we can't ever get up you we wonder these things you know why because many times up until that point we just have a relational truth we just have relative truth see job did all the right things he offered the sacrifices to burn offering in case my kids did this he had all the basics covered but there was something that was missing and god had to take him down to the valley of the shadow of death and then when he brought him down then he brought him an absolute and he could stand now and he answered his own question at that point he didn't need a lahu to answer it elihu he didn't need his friends to answer and because god himself came down and he answered his question and then he could stand apart from any human advice and he could say i know that my redeemer liveth and though the skin worms devour this body with these eyes what eyes the eyes it was going to rot in the ground he said with these eyes i shall see him why he already see him in a spirit realm he said there'll be two in the field and i'll take one and i'll leave one there'll be two in the same message the same bed of doctrine he said but i'll take one and i'll leave one why because they've been predestinated they've been for dane before the foundation of the world to say amen to every word of god hallelujah [Applause] well i see the shingle i like the pictures you got in the church because that's the way i've got it in mine well where's the picture i told the church i said listen i got the picture in my office i believe the picture but you know what you can have the pictures up and still not believe it you have the picture of them still not believe it we're doing some decorating in my church i got a picture of the hoffman head of christ there and i got one over here of christ in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks because it's christ in every single one of us jesus was the first angel heavenly and he was the seventh angel heavenly and as he sounded his message through each age that earthly portion on the earth picked the message up and sounded it and then the ministry under paul timothy and all of them sounded the exact same message are you with me and then the laity caught the revelation and picked it up christ in them and they lived it why it wasn't one over the other god called me into offices but it was christ in all of them are you with me the hope of glory brother branham said what jeffersonville needs he says it's thousands of lived lives he said that's the thunder that shakes the devil my belief does not shake the devil but when the word takes on flesh again [Applause] [Music] oh i like it the seven sons of skeva well paul preached this message it'll work for me i didn't work for paul because paul had to get a revelation of it first are you with me now he commanded the seven devils to come out of that individual and he said the the the message that paul's preaches the jesus that paul's preaches i command you to do it and that devil turned and said paul i know and jesus i know and brother branham i know but who are you you think because we believe something it backs the devil up uh uh no no no it didn't back him up it didn't back them up that the disciples walked with jesus but what backed him up was when peter are you with me and john come walking down to the gate beautiful because now what they'd heard was finally in them now in other words they just didn't wasn't in the message but the message came on the inside of them and when they come down to the gate beautiful he looked down now remember the same man that run like a scared animal a scared rabbit and cursed and denied the lord jesus three times now can walking down in boldness and he said man listen let me tell you something i don't got no money silver and gold have i none but not such as brother branham's god but not such as jesus god he said but such as i have give out thee he said rise up and walk in the name of jesus christ that's what backed the devil up because the revelation took on flesh [Applause] hallelujah i said the revelation of the word finally took on flesh somewhere along the line it's got to move from the prophet to the prophecy that was spoken one of the most overlooked scriptures in the message to me now that's just my personal opinion you can take it or leave it like it or lump it it don't matter to me but one of the most overlooked scriptures that was described the prophet's ministry was genesis 24 he did not come to reveal himself the scripture revealed who he was but he come to reveal and pick up a bride for his maker [Applause] oh you can find the message in that someone after the gifts she had some damsels that went out with her some of them been writing the word instead of listening to the word and causing them to fall in love with isaac they've been falling in love with eliezer and the whole time he's been trying to tell them who their mate really is [Music] you say that's no that's not taking him out of his position [Music] jesus said there was not a greater prophet than john the baptist but then that great prophet turns and says i must decrease so that he the person himself can increase look this message is a person this message is a person this message is not ideology and theology and doctrine and teaching that only tries to draw a picture to get you to see the person but it takes no man knows the things of god save the spirit of god the spirit of man knows the things of man but with the spirit of god this message reveals the person of jesus christ to you as the individual and joins you in an invisible union i'm trying to quit you realize what started in the first church age right still going on in the last church age you know what i hear preachers argue over things that brother brain said because it looks like there's discrepancies forgive me i don't lost too much weight my clothes is trying to fall off of me and i ain't bought more so for overlooked me from pulling up my pants but listen i hear brothers and there's some standing on this side over here and says well brother brandon said we're in the bright age well ain't no such thing as a bright age we're in the laodicean church age and they look at each other and they about hate each other over those what appears to be a conflict and i was thinking about that the one day and it was just like the lord come down and said when has there never not been a bright age see terminology can make you become a denomination brother branham said the difference between denomination and not being one he said it 25 to 27 times he said it's when you put a period at the end of it versus a comma i believe this this period or i believe this this comet if if there's going to be a period i'm going to let jesus christ put the period one one place i will put the period he's the same yesterday today and forever period into question but watch this now as paul preached his message the revelation went down to the elect and it caught him up that's the reason paul could write we are seated in christ jesus in heavenly ages he never used the terminology bright age but he said i want to present you a chaste virgin which is a bride back to christ so the revelation in paul's age caught them up above the spirit of the age and put them in a bright age and i can look and i say you're right and you're right and you're both wrong they're both quoting the same quotes but they're running without message if you cannot see if you cannot see people's rights all around you even in the churches people still fighting for my right if you cannot see gross darkness upon the people that's laodicea or laodicea trust still around us but when the revelation of the word picks you up laodicea is still going on but now you're like paul said you're seated in hallelujah you're seated in christ jesus in heavenly places no man gave it to you no man can take it away from you [Music] and i just went ah it's too simple both statements is right because you're looking at him and he's looking at you y'all looking at each other cross-siding because y'all carrying the spirit of denomination it's wrong you know that we're in little c you know that bride h that's what happened men take that and they'll be elevated so yeah brother i believe that you that brother over you know what he believes i told the church i said if you ain't never asked somebody really what they believe i said that's gossip if you wasn't a witness to it that's sulfuric acid in the church listen i don't know how to be me but me and get myself out of the way i told you i'm finding the actual message [Applause] because i've found when you read a quote i asked the preachers in my church i said let me ask you all a question i said when you read a quote i said are you putting brother branham before the people i said are you putting jesus christ before the people because if you put brother brandon before the people it'll produce a following or a movement but it will not produce life because he preached the word i said brothers if you preach that same quote it's no longer reading anymore but if you read it in the inspiration god lifts it off of the page because it was his word in the beginning he lifts it off the page and it will still reproduce do you know what i believe that many things that brother brandon preached from 63 to 65 wasn't even back then because we wasn't born yet if it was it had been over with mercy might be over with for some but it ain't over just yet listen i gotta quit let me read you this quote listen to this complaint of god revelations 2 14 nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love he said to understand this you must realize that the spirit is not speaking to the original saints of ephesus alone remember the first three horse riders was wrapped up in one which was the antichrist spirit writing all the way to the end whatever spirit was in the first church age carried over into the second church age to the third church age to the fourth to the fifth down to the seventh church age i am not in laodicea but my body feels the effect of laodicea my body still gets aggravated when somebody cuts me off interstate 85 or 40 why because my mind is still trapped in laodicea my flesh is still trapped and you know what you shouldn't cut me off you know why because i think i have a right to be there i'm just honest hey i ain't afraid to tell myself listen you know i'll tell you this and just as a testimony and i'm gonna read this quote and i'm gonna get out of here but listen i i was listening or my wife was listening to a book by a nominal christian man and it was mark canton is his name it's a pretty good book if you want to read it listen to it you say oh it ain't the message but you know what i find the message is the truth there were certain things there was certain things that was revealed through the prophet but if you go back and look he tied up all the loose ends so whatever was truth before he could do nothing but repeat what always already laid out are you with me now okay before you know some people oh you listen to something listen if i listen to something else and it's a word of god and it changed me i'm okay with that but i was listening my wife said tim this is honey this is a good book you need to listen to it it's called unoffendable unoffendable and i was listening to it and i thought man this is scripture i'm gonna get me a sermon out of this one and i began to listen to it and the second time through it i said i don't listen this no more i don't want to listen to this anymore because god was telling me you're offended i thought me offended i don't hold nothing against nobody he said yes you're offended at your wife and she's offended at you and i went huh not me he said yes you are the man i told the brothers of the church i said when you out of order and your home's out of order i said you demand you demand you guilty and so i began to meditate on it three four days and i thought well lord i don't know what am i offended or what she offended at me and so we both were sick i don't know if we had whatever variant they call it who knows what's next but i think we had one of them you know and so at least it's what google describes as a symptom somebody tries to go to google to prove this message right or wrong that's the craziest thing i have ever seen wikipedia do you not realize that you yourself can edit wikipedia give me a break but anyway so i'm listening to this and and we're home and we're sick and i'm streaming and brother jason o'rourke is preaching at the church and fabulous message and and he says can we come can we me and brother ben the two deacons of church he said can we come by and pray for you after you and your wife after service i said well brother i said look we've been trying to stay home and shelter so we just don't if it is that we don't want to make anybody sick because we was feeling rough and um he insisted and after the third time he said i already think i've already been around i said well if you ain't afraid come on so he comes by and we sit down and he's sitting in a pew over here we got an old church pew my wife we've decorated and sit in the house and then brother brother was set in a rocker and i was sitting here and amy was sitting there and we were looking at each other and and they began to talk the spirit of god came into my living room and we took each other by the hand as they got up and they put hands on us and they was praying for us as you know husband and wife and pastor in the leadership of the church and asking god to touch her body and i began to pray from my wife in a way that i had never done it and when i did and the prayer was through i looked up and she looked at me and there was a recognition in both of our eyes and after they left i said did you feel that she said i did i said what was between you and i was gone it's gone and she said it is well for two years that nobody knew about except her and me and the doctor inside of her throat she had a border that was growing and she would swallow and she would feel it and then it grew it was getting bigger and bigger to the point to where she didn't have to swallow she could just feel it pressing and she told me and it's really easy to pray for somebody when when you ain't mad at them and when you ain't offended at them and you ain't holding something against them and so she told me about it and i just i put my hand over on her back we was like five minutes from church i just said lord you're still the same one that when women would come up in the prayer of the prophet's prayer line and you would cause the border to disappear from women's throat that's all i said we went on to church and and the brother brother dwayne jackson from from brother joe greens was preaching fabulous service and he was preaching for us and at the end of the service i just began to testify about god taking the offense out of my life towards my wife and hers towards me and she was on the organ and i said sweetheart would you mind if we pray for you and she said no so she comes down and i said i want the ministers i said no if you're a believer these signs shall follow them that believe see i said i'm not confining it to the ministry anymore i said i've got as much confidence in the housewife's prayer as i do the preacher's prayer and i said i want all y'all to come and lay hands on her and of course the ministers gathered and put their hands in everybody one behind the other and when the last one put their hands on each other i was getting ready to say let's pray if you know my wife she's a white woman she don't express too much but i was getting ready to turn and when i did i watched her bow under the spirit of god and the entire church began to scream as the spirit of god came down into that building and we couldn't do nothing but worship for 20 minutes no but we just praised god into this we was worshiping in our own way and when we got through she said can i testify my wife don't testify in church i said sure women have been given a bad rap in the message we put women ought we put all women as bad women and i thought that's just some man's idea of it the good ones are the best ones but anyway i won't i won't get on that but so she said within three seconds of everybody laying their hands on me she said i swallowed and it disappeared what was it it wasn't doctoring it wasn't quotes but it was letting the word come into my heart and her heart to repent and then openly repent before the church and i told the church i said if i have ever been offended at you i apologize because i don't want nothing standing between me and god working anymore do you realize that when the bride when she's waiting on the groom to go away to prepare a place you know what she's doing while she's waiting history says that she's making blankets meant and doing all this stuff in preparation and said she's mending broken relationships while she's waiting on her groom to come back brother brahm said if you have an ought it will keep you out that one was free listen to what he says he said the message is to the entire age which lasted about 120 years its message then is to all generations in that span now history keeps repeating itself in the generations of israel we see the revival in one generation only to see the fire spading in the next in the third generation embers may be glowing slightly but in the fourth there may be no vestige whatsoever of the original flame did they still have the word they sure did oh hallelujah then god lights the fire again where in the fourth generation when man has laid out everything he can lay out and teach everything he can teach and it's not produced nothing and it takes the fire of god and hides it under all of the refuse all of the the stuff that's not exactly right and it's just maybe an ember think about this and this what excited me if it's the fourth generation where god re-lights the fire [Music] i got to thinking about it since the time of the prophet there was my father one generation there's me and my brothers and sisters is the second generation there's my children which the third generation and now i have grandchildren and you know what i'm seeing everywhere start to happen it's repeating itself again god is bringing fire back you know why i said god don't let me get so old that i can't ever feel the fire of god let me get closer and closer to the altar of god there's going to be children of a fourth watch revival you know why because it was in the fourth watch when jesus himself come walking out upon the darkest hour brother brahm says when it looks like the messenger and the message has been defeated then god himself comes out see you don't need to defend nothing why because god himself is now in the process of re-lighting the fire young people don't you worry if you're less than 50 you can have a revival but it's not going to be around man's ideas it's not going to be around doctrine it's the spirit of god the holy ghost in you taking you back to the original word with the original inspiration back to the faith that was once delivered to the saints why because he's going to reproduce another bride brother branham seen the bride and she got out a step and then he seen a church in between but then he seen another bride every kindred nation and tongue come around and she got out of step and watched he screamed get back in line get back in step that's what the holy spirit's saying get back in line with the original word with the original inspiration because i'm going to have a bride she's going to be without spot she's going to be without blemish she's going to be a perfect holy one because she is flesh of my flesh she is born in my bones she is who i am and i am who she is god bless you come brother hallelujah amen you good my brother you did probably better than me [Laughter] amen let's give the lord a hand again [Applause] hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord you know i was talking to uh to a parent one day and then the parent was explaining me what was going on between uh his child one of his child and his mother and then i caught it i say what is happening really the child is not trying to disrespect the mother i say that's not the case it's appearing like that but it's not the case i say what happened is the child got so much ammunition do you hear me this child have opened up to a different word about here and the child swallowed the message differently than before because the child was in the message but now the child moves under a different ministry and the message is made real to the child now and once a message is made real like that they don't tolerate sin anymore they will shoot at that quickly amen and old folks will look and say brother i just want to let you know that uh maybe you need to watch what you're doing that's an old person a child that got the revelation of the message they just move straight they say this is not what brother brown i'm saying brother brown i'm saying this and this is wrong straight ahead and it might appear offensive do you get what i'm saying do you get what i'm saying but really the child is not mad at anybody it's just they realize where they were and what they struggle with and what they went through and now when that word is charging it causes something that looks like a rebellion but it's not really rebellion it's they just got tired of everything they've seen all along until they understood that this message was so simple and the message was jesus christ himself manifested in this end time everybody care about here and if you don't understand the child you can miss him anybody care you might think he's against the parent or since these children begin to read the cod the they're kind of hard-headed they're not hard-headed anybody here they're just receiving the engrafted word so clear and as a revelation that they don't tolerate anything anymore amen the key is there this message is right this message is the very person of jesus christ anybody care but you need to have a revelation of that message for you to stand because people grew up in this message they are no longer in this message people preach this message they're no longer in this message anybody here people were deacon where trustees were all kind of stuff in this message they're all backsliding because they run without a message because they thought they have the message they had the religion part of it the intellectual part of it but they missed the revelation but once you get this message a true revelation of the message there is nothing in this life that you can compare with it amen i told somebody i said the more i read brother branham the more i love the bible he said the person that make me love the bible more i never seen a preacher that makes me love the bible so much like brother branham and now when i read the bible it's a complete new book i see this i see this i see this i see this i see i see things all over so when you say preach the bible where were you preaching all this time we were preaching the bible anybody here we were already preaching the bible you just missed the revelation amen like the messenger that came they said what did you hear i heard noise i heard this i heard this and then it we draw a lot of doctrine left and right this doctrine this doctrine destruction and before you know it the fire is gone but you won't kill the revival of god because you this message was a true revival brother branham say watch every one of them after three years they denominate he said but watch this one it says been 15 years you cannot amen the person was just hidden and let men do the show and around the show they run the show they run the show when the time of the show is finished now he's shaking everything and reconfirming back that this message was the person of jesus christ he was sent to prepare you to meet the lord jesus christ amen amen so now nobody can separate you from it hallelujah because you got a revelation of the message you meet the person of the message it's a different story amen like philip asked the eunuch he said what do you read do you understand what you read he was reading the prophet but he did not understand the prophet and the prophet and he looks and the way isaiah described jesus christ the eunuch thought that isaiah was talking about himself hallelujah the way brother branham described and demonstrated this message you will think brother branham was talking about himself that's why he turned around he said listen you're not feeding on the word of man the voice is brother branham but that message is the unfailing body word of the son of man and philip took the same scripture that the eunuch thought that phil that isaiah was talking about himself and he pulled jesus christ out of that scripture and he saw that jesus christ was wrapped up in isaiah he just needed a revelation and when he needed a revelation do you know what happened god took the ministry off that was it and the eunuch left and went you can never change the eunuch anymore amen the way remember he came to jerusalem to worship amen but thou eunic was a different unique than every other time that he came to jerusalem because now the scriptures are made manifested they can see that hey this is not a man no this is a vessel that the yo that the lord used to bring a channel of inspiration and through that we're feeding on the word of god and we're moving forward amen that's why you need your personal revelation for this message and then this message nobody will push you to listen to the tape nobody will push you to read the sermon you yourself somebody new will be talking about go ahead and push that you don't have nobody to tell you to push play that person will tell you to push play amen and when you push play you begin to listen to that same sermon that you listen before that you heard people preach before but when you listen to it it seems like this is something different no it was already laying there amen but it's no more interpretation of man anymore it is the holy spirit himself working right there amen so we thank god for the message of the hour and brother tim that was wonderful god richly bless you amen amen hallelujah hallelujah the absolute the absolute the bible is the absolute i don't have any problem with that and i believe it but the absolute interpretation of the bible is the message of the hour and that absolute have to leave both the bible and the message and become a true revelation into you then nobody will shake you away anybody care nobody will shake you away they can give you all kind of video all kind of stuff it would never shake your way somebody gave me a video trying to make me doubt the message and i listen i listen i listen i listen i finish and that person asks me say what do you think about it i say nothing he said really i said nothing he said that's powerful i say nothing i say it didn't do anything to me [Music] hell but here matter of fact he helped me use more ammunition against it amen hallelujah hallelujah this message is beautiful amen we want to have the absolute not a relative what the brother was laboring is trying to show you that we already got the absolute but the ministry has been playing with the absolute and manipulating the word and that caused the fire brother branham say when man when you don't repeat what the messengers say the revival dies but when you go back to the pure word to the absolute not what somebody else interpreted not this camp that camp this camp but we go back to the pure message and when it's laid out automatically the pillar of fire will follow the ark of the covenant once you put the ark back in the tabernacle you don't sit there and call the pillar of fire you say peter of fire come to the tabernacle no the pillar of fire was just waiting they put the table of the show break they put the candle stick when once they brought the ark and put it right there the pillar of fire automatically step into the building and when he got there the ministry took the hand off now he was the holy spirit through the entire congregation ministering and doing his own thing amen blessed be the name of the lord let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you humbly father tonight again and thanking you for your grace for your love and your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us father we thank you because after going through a lot of shaking and everything that we thought was chaos now we begin to realize that it's not a chaos it is the rising king that is rising with power and further keeping your own way and demonstrating to your children that the era of man the era of calvinism the era of armenianism the era of any deviation is gone now it's back to the pure world when your children are gonna be so confined into the word and so in tune and intimate with that word until that word will become flesh and we're gonna see a living episode true thunders lord father people that are radiating the message with their life until if somebody never read a book or never probably listen to a call to a message tape when they see a believer they can tell that this person is different do we still have this kind of species on earth after everything that is going on lord when we walk outside we see women almost completely naked we see man going bare chest we see craziness and perversion and everything that is unfitted for your children to be even living on this world but father by your grace you still also thundering in a different way where in the midst of this darkness father you are shining a brighter light that people can turn around even in a walmart or sam's club or in the mall and they can turn around and see somebody that is showing the pure holiness of god lord father because of this message lord we thank you for what you're doing and we thank you lord father for how you rising up lord father your father you are kindling that again lord to take that elect seed and to prepare us back again to meet you into the air lord we are committing this congregation unto the hand father may you protect each one of us and give us travel mercy lord and may you strengthen brother team hate and lord and help him lord father with the work and the labor you gave it to him so that he can continue to label more and more and bring the people again lord father closer unto thee we thank you for everything if there is anybody that i have a need or needed a touch in the body father may you remember them and touch them lord if there is somebody that is struggle with a specific need or something going on in their life that they need an immediate attention from thee father may you remember them lord may you come down again you that heal sister emmy may you touch and heal your children and granted unto them lord the desire of the heart we humbly ask it lord father and commit everything unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen brother john come on [Music] let's sing one verse mine eyes have seen the glowy [Music] he is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] glory glory [Music] glory [Music] is [Music] seen him
