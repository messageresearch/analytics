[26:31] hey man
[26:35] sorry i don't want to take up too much
[26:36] time but i've been meaning to give this
[26:38] testimony for a while i wasn't going to
[26:40] i was just going to let it go but
[26:42] my drive here i was listening to worship
[26:44] music and i was just crying the whole
[26:45] drive
[26:46] um
[26:53] um
[26:54] so i know at this point everybody here
[26:56] knows zach thanks to my dad
[26:58] um
[26:59] but um i met him a couple months ago
[27:02] in june and um getting to know him and
[27:06] visiting his church his church really
[27:07] like
[27:08] emphasizes receiving the new birth and
[27:11] you know um i kind of
[27:14] assumed i had it
[27:15] i went to a camp in a in 2014
[27:19] and had an experience there and um i
[27:21] always thought that was like kind of
[27:23] referenced that day as the day that i'd
[27:25] gotten saved um
[27:27] but you know within the last two years
[27:30] nope
[27:31] and so
[27:33] um
[27:34] so um
[27:36] his family kind of
[27:37] um
[27:38] told me you know have you heard about
[27:40] this new camp in south carolina that um
[27:42] it's their first year um brother brother
[27:45] burley's camp and says first year doing
[27:47] it um i'd i've never been to camps i'm
[27:50] not one to put myself out there and go
[27:51] to camps or visit other churches um but
[27:54] this year i decided to go out of my
[27:55] comfort zone
[27:57] and you know see what happens because
[27:59] the last couple months um
[28:01] i've been very very sensitive to the
[28:03] word and i think god had been working on
[28:05] my heart the last six months
[28:07] and
[28:09] so i figured
[28:10] this might be exactly what i need
[28:12] so i went to the camp and the first
[28:15] night i believe it was brother um
[28:18] jason watkins that had preached the
[28:19] first night and as soon as i walked in
[28:22] there i could feel in the atmosphere you
[28:24] know that god was there and i knew some
[28:26] like i'm i was not going to leave that
[28:27] camp the same person
[28:30] and i didn't want to either
[28:31] so i prayed that you know with
[28:33] everything
[28:35] zach had been encouraging me with and
[28:37] you know he had been praying for me that
[28:39] i would receive the new birth
[28:42] as well so
[28:44] um throughout the camp the services were
[28:46] amazing the music was amazing and so
[28:48] that saturday night we walked in and i
[28:50] decided i had been praying
[28:53] god i i'm not leaving this building or
[28:55] this service tonight until i have it
[28:57] excuse me
[28:58] so um
[29:00] they announced there was going to be a
[29:01] prayer line and i decided i was going to
[29:03] be the first person in that prayer line
[29:05] and
[29:07] so i
[29:08] two hours went by just straight praying
[29:11] and crying and exhaust you know being
[29:13] exhausted just wanting to receive it and
[29:17] by the end of the service i knew like i
[29:18] had had it
[29:20] i had received a new birth and um i i
[29:22] still had been wondering why the last
[29:24] six months i was so sensitive to the
[29:27] word into preaching and even in here
[29:30] excuse me um
[29:32] and
[29:33] brother john andes was preaching and
[29:35] said that if that has been happening god
[29:37] will
[29:38] will bring in these labor contractions
[29:40] in your heart
[29:42] and even if it's through a course of a
[29:44] few days or weeks or months he's getting
[29:46] you closer and closer to receiving to to
[29:48] opening your heart to receiving the new
[29:50] birth and it just occurred to me that
[29:52] the last six months that i was so
[29:54] sensitive were those labor contractions
[29:57] getting me ready for that night that i
[29:59] received it so that's i just wanted to
[30:01] give that testimony
[30:02] [Laughter]
[30:06] [Applause]
[30:08] amen
[30:11] praise the lord amen
[30:14] yes sir
[30:15] yes sir
[30:22] this week tomorrow
[30:25] to twip up
[30:41] [Music]
[30:50] even though the pastor prayed last
[30:52] wednesday if you may receive a prayer
[30:55] success
[30:56] i would like for you all to pray to pray
[30:59] with our sisters
[31:03] i would like that the assembly may think
[31:05] of us in your prayers
[31:08] [Music]
[31:11] because we are leaving for about a whole
[31:13] week
[31:16] reports
[31:26] because when my wife was still living we
[31:28] had already made arrangement that we
[31:31] were supposed to go as a family to
[31:32] orlando florida florida
[31:34] uh

[31:40] anniversary because every thanksgiving
[31:42] is her birthday please
[31:59] so this 25th will be her 50th would have
[32:02] been her 50th birthday her jubilee
[32:05] [Music]

[32:24] brethren we wanted to celebrate her 50th
[32:27] birthday even though she's not here we
[32:29] will still memory commemorate
[32:32] the that day for her

[52:11] right and everything that had breath
[52:13] praise the lord
[52:14] hallelujah genesis
[52:17] 22
[52:18] and we'll read the
[52:20] 16 and 17th verse
[52:23] he says and said by
[52:25] myself have i sworn say the lord for
[52:29] because thou has done this thing and has
[52:32] not held thy son thy only son that is
[52:37] that in blessing i will bless thee and
[52:40] in multiplying i will multiply thy seed
[52:44] as the stars of the heaven and as the
[52:46] saiyans which is upon the sea sure and
[52:49] thy seed shall possess the gate of his
[52:53] enemy
[52:54] now we want you to keep that in mind
[52:56] we're going to go to galatians he was
[52:58] three
[53:03] and then we have
[53:05] three more passages the scriptures and
[53:07] then you can be
[53:08] uh seated
[53:10] appreciate your patience
[53:12] uh galatians 3 and 29
[53:15] says and if ye be crisis
[53:17] then are ye abraham's seed and heirs
[53:21] according to the promise
[53:23] and over to the next uh chapter
[53:26] four
[53:27] and verse 23
[53:29] it says
[53:31] be he who was of the
[53:33] but he who was of the bond woman was
[53:36] born after the flesh
[53:37] but he of the free woman
[53:40] by was by promise
[53:42] may the lord add a blessing to the
[53:43] reading of his word you may be seated
[53:46] just a little thought here we got the
[53:48] inspiration from um
[53:51] the uh scriptures uh i mean the messages
[53:54] possessing the gates of his enemy
[53:57] but it's after the trial
[54:00] after the trial
[54:01] you know we we're going to read
[54:03] something but the lord is going to take
[54:05] us to another level this morning
[54:07] because you didn't come to hear from a
[54:08] man you came to hear from him
[54:11] no one can call god set the audience
[54:13] this morning so he know what each and
[54:15] every one of us need the anointing is
[54:18] sweet brother john god is doing the
[54:20] things the devil don't like that it
[54:23] don't matter how good you can teach it
[54:24] no matter how good you can preach no
[54:26] matter if the anointing is not right
[54:28] when you walk out here you still have to
[54:31] fight these demons so we're talking
[54:33] about giving him the praises giving him
[54:36] the honor giving him the glory
[54:38] continue to go higher saints we're going
[54:40] to walk right on out of here just like
[54:43] enoch did is that right
[54:46] god bless you
[54:48] i try to do my best and
[54:50] stay slow i know we got the uh
[54:52] interpreter back there but y'all pray
[54:54] with me
[54:55] now we know that abraham had a promise
[54:58] but it was two seeds is that right
[55:00] it was a natural seed is that right and
[55:03] it was the royal seed it was a spiritual
[55:05] seed it was the faith seed and that's
[55:08] what i'm looking in this hour here now
[55:10] so don't think it's so far-fetched what
[55:13] the pastor the anointing that's on him
[55:15] to bring you to this level is that right
[55:18] this is the hour this is for it is that
[55:21] right this is going home time this is
[55:23] rapturing time um god have saved the
[55:26] best for last is that right he's telling
[55:29] us some is just seeing the messenger in
[55:31] the natural is that right all they see
[55:34] him is in the flesh but now paul said i
[55:37] pray without ceasing that you coming to
[55:40] the knowledge and the revelation and the
[55:42] wisdom and the understanding of our love
[55:44] the lord and savior jesus christ is that
[55:47] right the anointing that came in the
[55:49] last age was anointing of christ is that
[55:52] right christ was there then because
[55:55] christ identified him the difference in
[55:57] his age here now we got the signs we got
[56:01] the wonders we got things working with
[56:03] us is that right we're just in the
[56:05] beginning same son so god is going to be
[56:08] dealing with you in mighty ways but you
[56:10] got to humble yourself had the last time
[56:13] we was here and i saw the holy spirit
[56:15] was talking about it wednesday night we
[56:18] was talking about a faith
[56:20] that worketh by love
[56:22] and that was the incentive they worked
[56:24] together and that faith is i mean that
[56:27] love is not the affiliated love it's the
[56:30] agape love he's no one can call him the
[56:33] christ only but by the what by the holy
[56:37] ghost is that right so we're going to
[56:39] show you this morning we're going to
[56:41] knock everything out that the devil is
[56:43] trying to hinder that's why god thank
[56:45] you brother pray with me preach with me
[56:48] that's why we're talking about in this
[56:50] hour here now god send a message by a
[56:53] messenger malachi 4 luke 17 30 luke 17
[56:58] 30 and what did he say in revelation 19
[57:01] his name was william marion branham is
[57:04] that right he was the only messenger
[57:06] that has seven letters and three names
[57:09] is that right perfection and completion
[57:17] we're talking about now living a
[57:19] victorious life
[57:21] we know abraham abraham was tried
[57:24] abraham he was tested is that right but
[57:27] he staggered not at the promises of god
[57:30] he knew that he could not god could not
[57:32] fail once god said something is that
[57:35] right so now we're talking about saying
[57:37] hold on every promise in the scriptures

[1:02:21] what we're getting now the word of the
[1:02:23] lord
[1:02:24] and saying this shall not be thy air but
[1:02:27] he that shall come forth out of thy own
[1:02:30] bowel shall be thy ass now remember he
[1:02:33] already told me it's going to be two
[1:02:35] right abraham abram caught the
[1:02:37] revelation it's not what's going to be
[1:02:40] isaac that was going to be another seed
[1:02:42] is that right let us keep going he said
[1:02:45] now look but but he brought him forth
[1:02:49] abroad and said look now toward the
[1:02:51] heaven and tell the stars if thou be
[1:02:54] able to number them and he said unto him
[1:02:57] so shall thy seed be
[1:03:00] and he believed in who
[1:03:03] in the lord and he counted it
[1:03:05] for for righteousness remember the holy
[1:03:08] spirit was just telling us how that
[1:03:10] faith work he believed that because he
[1:03:12] heard the god's word he received god's
[1:03:15] word and then second he had to do what

[1:03:43] some things to you that the prophet said
[1:03:46] he said now look

[1:03:50] the enemy after the trial

[1:04:05] promise that you're seized
[1:04:07] because you believe my word and
[1:04:10] regardless of what the circumstances
[1:04:12] your seed shall possess the gate of its
[1:04:14] enemy you understand
[1:04:17] the condition
[1:04:18] something that you're struggling with
[1:04:20] has nothing to do with the conclusion in
[1:04:23] the promised word what god promised us
[1:04:26] is that right
[1:04:27] it's come to strengthen you it's come to
[1:04:30] move you closer to getting out of here
[1:04:31] is that right oh death where's thy
[1:04:34] saying what are we worrying about the
[1:04:35] devil for he's no good he's a defeated
[1:04:38] enemy is that right the blood of jesus
[1:04:41] christ we will share that on calvary the
[1:04:44] atonement paid for it see that's what
[1:04:46] happened to bellamy barack when he got
[1:04:49] around i'm just preaching now that's
[1:04:50] what happened to bellamy bettack when he
[1:04:52] got around in there he wanted to curse
[1:04:55] god's children and when he got there he
[1:04:57] wanted to curse god's children he got
[1:04:59] the word from god that's exactly right
[1:05:01] brother he's trying to do it he know
[1:05:04] being a prophet he couldn't move past
[1:05:06] the word of god so when he come down in
[1:05:09] there he's trying to persuade that try
[1:05:11] to persuade him because he's seen us
[1:05:13] growing in numbers so you know that
[1:05:15] you're growing you're maturing so the
[1:05:18] battle is getting heated up but that's
[1:05:20] all right when the enemy come in like a
[1:05:23] florida he would lift up a mighty
[1:05:25] standing against them huh
[1:05:28] he wanted to move he wanted to mess with
[1:05:31] god's people but he know he couldn't he
[1:05:34] said what
[1:05:35] balaam even testified himself but you
[1:05:38] know you can't curse what god is
[1:05:40] blessing is that right he can't curse
[1:05:43] you god has blessed you god chose you
[1:05:46] god called you god finishing the word he
[1:05:50] called you as overcomers in this age
[1:05:54] hallelujah
[1:05:59] huh
[1:06:00] we never switched that devil we getting
[1:06:02] ready to knock him out somebody's going
[1:06:04] to get set free somebody's going to get
[1:06:06] their salvation this morning i'm
[1:06:08] singleton good to see you huh hallelujah
[1:06:13] look what he says

[1:06:16] he says that that
[1:06:17] possession
[1:06:18] help me lord
[1:06:20] he said the word and regardless of the
[1:06:22] circumstances
[1:06:23] your seed shall possess the gate of its
[1:06:26] enemy i don't have no board so you got
[1:06:28] to bear with me he said why every enemy
[1:06:31] that come up
[1:06:33] against abraham see
[1:06:35] the enemy of two old abraham didn't
[1:06:38] listen to him is that right
[1:06:40] because abraham had to be a type in the
[1:06:42] scriptures for us bride is that right
[1:06:45] he was going to show us that god had to
[1:06:47] change this body now he was going to
[1:06:50] change this body back into a young man
[1:06:53] again is that right he's staggering not
[1:06:55] at the promises of god so abraham knew
[1:06:58] that god said it as he told him over in
[1:07:01] genesis 15 he believed it he's standing
[1:07:04] on it and he's waiting for it to come to
[1:07:06] pass if it didn't come to pass that day
[1:07:09] the next day would be even greater and
[1:07:11] the next day would be even greater and
[1:07:13] the next day would be even greater why
[1:07:16] because god cannot lie is that right
[1:07:19] hallelujah
[1:07:22] look what he says
[1:07:24] he says then the two where he started
[1:07:26] the devil couldn't move him off of being
[1:07:28] too old he said he still stayed right
[1:07:31] true to that promise
[1:07:33] he said now no man that possesses that
[1:07:36] faith
[1:07:37] still will take now will take god's word
[1:07:41] regardless of the circumstances
[1:07:44] you see
[1:07:45] because now because he says give
[1:07:48] remember the world was framed by the
[1:07:50] word of god and so now he says now if
[1:07:53] you cannot do that getting ready to hit
[1:07:56] you if you cannot do that then you're
[1:07:59] not
[1:08:00] abraham

[1:08:21] you want to see
[1:08:22] you're not just of royal blood just to
[1:08:24] say you're of royal blood
[1:08:27] huh

[1:08:31] were in the mind of god before the
[1:08:34] foundation of the world our origin comes
[1:08:37] from heaven don't look at what you're
[1:08:39] struggling with don't look at your
[1:08:41] condition your origin is from heaven we
[1:08:45] come from god we go back to god we feel
[1:08:48] thank god for what he did we looking for
[1:08:51] the rapture to come but we having a good
[1:08:53] time right now is that right in the
[1:08:56] world of god because the word is being

[1:09:29] he said now remember there's always a
[1:09:30] mixed multitude
[1:09:32] huh does it make small truth why i think
[1:09:34] the holy spirit put up there about with
[1:09:36] uh brother branham you got the cardinal
[1:09:38] minded the spiritual minded and you got
[1:09:40] division
[1:09:42] huh
[1:09:43] because all some of them see it's just a
[1:09:45] man
[1:09:46] see they got to realize it's twofold if
[1:09:48] he say they came in with a man with uh
[1:09:51] uh daniel right when they worship daniel
[1:09:53] they're gonna leave out with a man what
[1:09:55] works in the pope is that right
[1:09:57] you got two spirits in the message too
[1:09:59] is that right there's always two c's you
[1:10:02] got the sons of god which come from god
[1:10:04] and the spirit of god and you got the
[1:10:06] sons of the prophet is that right and
[1:10:08] who's ever streamlined and go tell them
[1:10:10] yeah you said it because god gave me
[1:10:12] grace to set it you know why he gave me
[1:10:13] grace to say it because he's told us
[1:10:16] he's assigned us to earnestly contend
[1:10:18] for the faith that was once delivered
[1:10:20] unto the saints is that right you're
[1:10:22] trying to twist the word you're trying
[1:10:24] to take away the five-fold ministry
[1:10:26] you're trying to mess around with the
[1:10:28] ministry that god has put here it's
[1:10:30] jesus christ and all he's doing is
[1:10:33] getting the pastors getting himself out
[1:10:34] of the way and let god use the gift that
[1:10:37] he saved for the end time is that right
[1:10:40] he said father why do we buy him we're
[1:10:43] not bothering anyone we're just
[1:10:45] spreading our love is that right he said
[1:10:47] father when they came down from that
[1:10:49] transfiguration he took faith hope and
[1:10:52] charity up there when it came down from
[1:10:54] now transfiguration he said father
[1:10:57] they're casting out devils in that name
[1:10:59] they hear the sick in thy name he said
[1:11:01] well if they're not against you well let
[1:11:04] me do what let them be
[1:11:07] huh
[1:11:08] hallelujah
[1:11:10] jump on the bear wagon
[1:11:16] religious demons
[1:11:18] oh my
[1:11:19] see i'm telling you now we was in that
[1:11:22] prison y'all need to go to the jails in
[1:11:23] the prison that's why i tell when i say
[1:11:25] brother abel when i first came here i
[1:11:27] said pray for me i need a lot of prayer
[1:11:29] because when i came i'm used to just
[1:11:31] laying it out there hitting them demons
[1:11:33] because if a man leave out if a man
[1:11:34] leaves out of that jail or that prison
[1:11:36] if he don't get the holy ghost before he
[1:11:38] leaves there he may not make it back he
[1:11:40] may not get the grace of god delivered
[1:11:42] it to him at that time so this is no
[1:11:44] time to be playing with the devil that
[1:11:47] god told us everything shall be done
[1:11:49] everything everything shall be crossed
[1:11:51] every eye shall be dot everything that's
[1:11:53] hidden is going to be uncovered is that
[1:11:55] right god's bringing a word and
[1:11:57] revealing his word and what revealing
[1:12:00] hidden and revealing his simplicity is
[1:12:02] that right and it's hid the same way
[1:12:05] hidden in simplicity and revealing it
[1:12:08] the same way it's going right over their
[1:12:10] heads is that right
[1:12:12] you got to make a decision it's it's
[1:12:14] checking it up time saints huh we're
[1:12:17] looking for greater things to come they
[1:12:19] say the rapture going to take place
[1:12:20] we're looking for the rapture only thing
[1:12:22] going in the rapture is perfect love in
[1:12:24] the pure unadulterated word is that
[1:12:27] right
[1:12:28] hallelujah
[1:12:30] look what he said
[1:12:32] oh help us he said now
[1:12:34] he said now you can do that
[1:12:37] he says that's the faith that abraham
[1:12:40] had his seat amen
[1:12:43] oh boy
[1:12:44] he said now the promise of abraham was
[1:12:48] that his seat
[1:12:50] now
[1:12:51] his royal seat
[1:12:53] that's us
[1:12:54] see there's the royal seat
[1:12:57] he said that came help me lord his royal
[1:12:59] seed as i told you a while ago and this
[1:13:03] seal that he give abraham was a seal of
[1:13:07] promise
[1:13:08] he says and the royal seed according to
[1:13:10] ephesians 4 and 30 what
[1:13:13] grieve not what the holy spirit of god
[1:13:17] which by you are what sealed until the
[1:13:20] day of your redemption
[1:13:22] he said now
[1:13:23] is the sealed by the holy ghost
[1:13:26] after they stood the test
[1:13:29] see
[1:13:30] they tried to now you think of it
[1:13:33] many think
[1:13:35] they got the holy ghost
[1:13:38] many claim to have the holy ghost
[1:13:41] he said but many can show many evidence
[1:13:43] and signs of it but still
[1:13:46] if it can't say if it can't stay
[1:13:50] with this word
[1:13:53] it's not the holy ghost
[1:13:55] [Music]
[1:13:58] self-examination
[1:14:00] huh
[1:14:01] the holy ghost is not going to dwell in
[1:14:03] any any kind of temple
[1:14:05] the spirit of god is not going to dwell
[1:14:07] there
[1:14:08] i don't care what you can get out there
[1:14:10] and manufacture and fake this and fake
[1:14:12] that but if you can't receive the
[1:14:14] message for your day
[1:14:16] now it is not just receiving it it's the
[1:14:19] manifestation of the word for your day
[1:14:22] these signs shall follow them that
[1:14:25] believe see that's what happened with
[1:14:27] balaam and baylor the difference when
[1:14:29] they came in remember balaam i mean bay
[1:14:32] back he called them some demons
[1:14:35] is that right those princesses those
[1:14:38] princesses were chief demons they were
[1:14:41] kings they were rulers they were leaders
[1:14:45] god told us in his end time we wrestle
[1:14:48] not against flesh and blood but against
[1:14:50] principalities and powers and wickedness
[1:14:53] and rulers we're at in high places this
[1:14:56] is an organized army of satan but you
[1:15:00] know what there's no weapons gonna fall
[1:15:03] against and prosper against his end-time
[1:15:06] message because god came and turned over
[1:15:09] every hidden thing that satan had then
[1:15:12] that religious demon is that right
[1:15:14] he would give us the first seal the
[1:15:16] second seal the third seal and the
[1:15:18] fourth seal is that right look at the
[1:15:20] grace that's been extended enough it was
[1:15:23] no more right as that to the fourth
[1:15:26] huh
[1:15:27] god extended his grace he saved all this
[1:15:30] this this until this time because he
[1:15:33] know he had a seed
[1:15:35] in this age here
[1:15:36] he has some
[1:15:38] we had someone that he has chosen to go
[1:15:42] and finish this plan of redemption the
[1:15:45] holy ghost came so that you can become
[1:15:48] one with god
[1:15:49] you can become partnership with god
[1:15:51] again you can finish this redemptive
[1:15:54] plan of work with god is that right we
[1:15:57] will let me keep reading i don't want to
[1:15:59] get
[1:16:00] too far
[1:16:01] ahead i want you to see this by god's
[1:16:03] grace if he help me
[1:16:05] he said now look
[1:16:07] he says many of them they got think they
[1:16:09] got the holy ghost many claim to have
[1:16:11] the holy ghost he says many can can show
[1:16:13] many evidence in the signs but it's
[1:16:15] still if you can't stay with the word
[1:16:17] it's not the holy ghost he says you
[1:16:18] believe every word then you are sealed
[1:16:21] after the test
[1:16:23] see how simple it is
[1:16:25] huh see how simple it is
[1:16:27] see sin is what just unbelief
[1:16:30] he said god said man should not live by
[1:16:32] bread alone but by what every word that
[1:16:35] proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord
[1:16:36] is that right all of it has to do with
[1:16:39] god said it i believe it that's it close
[1:16:41] the book dance shout praise the lord go
[1:16:43] about rejoicing at what the lord said
[1:16:46] look at here he said now look he says
[1:16:48] when when we believe every promise in
[1:16:50] the word see then we are sealed by the
[1:16:53] spirit to confirm the promise
[1:16:56] he says no that's why he said what put
[1:16:58] on the whole armor of god when you put
[1:17:00] on the whole arm of god so that you may
[1:17:03] be able to do what withstand the devil's
[1:17:06] trickery in this end time
[1:17:09] and the word of god is the word of god
[1:17:11] that god has sent this hour here which
[1:17:14] is anointed by the spirit of god when
[1:17:17] the spirit of god anoints the message of
[1:17:20] the hour satan recognizes it and he know
[1:17:23] he can't touch it
[1:17:25] so when he come down and put on the
[1:17:26] helmet of what salvation is that right
[1:17:30] put on the breastplate of what
[1:17:32] righteousness is that right put on the
[1:17:34] shield of what faith going to learn with
[1:17:38] what truth is that right put a
[1:17:40] preparation of the what gospel of peace

[1:18:02] not being reached your prayer is being
[1:18:05] reached your prayer is accomplishing
[1:18:07] what it accomplished it's just by faith
[1:18:10] you got to realize every time he said
[1:18:12] god said what you're buying on earth i
[1:18:14] was abing in heaven what you loose on
[1:18:16] earth shall be loose in heaven you have
[1:18:19] been given the authority saints huh
[1:18:22] against satan's kingdom so we're
[1:18:24] fighting a defeated enemy is that right
[1:18:28] he's afraid of you when you walk in the
[1:18:31] place you recognize the anointing that's
[1:18:33] on you what he don't want you to do is
[1:18:36] speak the word if you speak the word
[1:18:39] it's going to accomplish what it's going
[1:18:41] to accomplish is that right well that's
[1:18:44] just a family that testimony with that
[1:18:46] lady with that baby is that right huh
[1:18:48] that was god using you because he
[1:18:51] vindicates his word

[1:19:05] he says then you are sealed after the
[1:19:07] test when you we believe every promise
[1:19:09] in the word
[1:19:10] then we are sealed by the spirit he said
[1:19:12] to confirm the promise he says that's
[1:19:15] what
[1:19:15] it's what abraham the way he did it
[1:19:19] then the only the thin only
[1:19:22] have we the right
[1:19:24] to possess the gates of the enemy

[1:21:59] looking for no woman let me tell you
[1:22:01] around there now but when you get around
[1:22:03] in there and you start talking about
[1:22:09] men talk you go in the barber shop
[1:22:11] around a bunch of men huh talking about
[1:22:14] women gossip oh oh
[1:22:17] you get around in there right and he
[1:22:20] went in that barber shop and he started
[1:22:22] praising the lord i can see i can see i
[1:22:25] can see and you know they was mocking
[1:22:27] him is that right he said the man had
[1:22:29] the razor in his hand and right in the
[1:22:31] chair it says eyes popped open is that
[1:22:34] right his eyes popped open he said he
[1:22:36] ran out the out the barber's chair and
[1:22:39] ran down the street and start praising
[1:22:41] the lord giving god the glory you don't
[1:22:44] have to be ashamed of when you're
[1:22:46] waiting on deliverance from something
[1:22:48] just keep testifying keep testifying
[1:22:51] keep testifying keep testifying keep
[1:22:55] testifying
[1:23:01] sure the challenge is going to be there
[1:23:03] so it's going to be there but god gave
[1:23:05] you a promise if god said it is going to
[1:23:08] happen in his time he said look he said
[1:23:12] now
[1:23:13] and then we are sealed by the spirit to
[1:23:16] confirm the promise
[1:23:18] he says that's what abraham
[1:23:20] then and then only we had the right to
[1:23:23] possess the gate of our enemy he said
[1:23:26] you cannot do it until you
[1:23:29] reverse you become that seat
[1:23:36] let it sink in
[1:23:39] let it sink in
[1:23:41] baby we might want to mute this i want
[1:23:44] nobody out there that's the uh
[1:23:46] for the gospel
[1:23:48] see you you say you must be what born
[1:23:51] again
[1:23:52] born again that means you had to come
[1:23:54] from god
[1:23:55] to go from god
[1:23:57] that seed inside of you had to be
[1:24:00] germinated seed it has to have a life
[1:24:03] there inside
[1:24:05] that life has to be there and god put
[1:24:08] that there what before the foundation of
[1:24:11] the world
[1:24:12] see that's why balaam couldn't do
[1:24:14] nothing to israel
[1:24:17] because they forgot about the brazen
[1:24:19] serpent that was there in the wilderness
[1:24:21] they forgot about the atonement that god
[1:24:24] had made for israel sure they didn't
[1:24:26] know israel got in the mess sure they
[1:24:28] were doing things they wasn't supposed
[1:24:30] to be doing but god did what he slew a
[1:24:33] lamb of god before the foundation of the
[1:24:37] world
[1:24:38] you can always look to the cross look to
[1:24:41] the cross look into the hill to where my
[1:24:43] strength and my help come from at the
[1:24:46] cross at the cross where i first saw the
[1:24:49] life and the burdens of my
[1:24:52] world away and was there by what faith
[1:24:55] and i received my what sight and now i'm
[1:24:58] what happy win
[1:25:07] all the day
[1:25:08] why
[1:25:10] because
[1:25:11] your salvation has already been paid for
[1:25:14] when he asks you paul asked him have you
[1:25:17] received the holy ghost since you
[1:25:18] believed he wasn't de-christianizing
[1:25:21] anyone he wasn't taking anything away
[1:25:24] from him jesus already paid for that
[1:25:27] huh he just as you have ye received the
[1:25:30] holy ghost since you believe see that's
[1:25:34] baptist doctrine is that right
[1:25:36] he said no we have not yet what heard of
[1:25:39] any holy ghost then they told me they
[1:25:41] had to get what re-baptized
[1:25:44] those that haven't been baptized you
[1:25:46] have to repent
[1:25:47] be baptized every one of you in the name
[1:25:50] of jesus christ for the remission of
[1:25:52] your sins ye shall receive the gift of
[1:25:54] the holy ghost it's a promise unto you
[1:25:57] and your children you're not going to
[1:25:59] get out of here without the holy ghost
[1:26:00] is that right i heard the pastor when he
[1:26:02] came up last time we ministered he went
[1:26:04] to romans 5 and 5. and he was just
[1:26:07] showing him there so we got to
[1:26:09] understand why did the lord put that on
[1:26:12] on his heart because he was showing us
[1:26:14] now that the love of god the only love
[1:26:18] that you're going to be able to produce
[1:26:20] that works with your faith it has to be
[1:26:22] the baptism of the holy ghost is that
[1:26:25] right it got to be
[1:26:27] hallelujah help me lord see where we at
[1:26:30] he said now look
[1:26:33] he says now
[1:26:34] he says now
[1:26:36] now you notice here we're talking about
[1:26:38] natural seats we're talking about
[1:26:40] abraham abraham abraham and they were
[1:26:43] there they were the natural seed of god
[1:26:46] abraham was a powerful man propheter in
[1:26:48] his time but abraham was up there of the
[1:26:51] natural seed is that right let's look at
[1:26:54] now daniel i'm just going to come as
[1:26:56] they come to me look at daniel daniel
[1:26:58] was a prophet is that right but daniel
[1:27:01] was a powerful man and he would stood
[1:27:03] the test is that right he possessed the
[1:27:06] gates of his enemy after the trial is
[1:27:09] that right
[1:27:10] we want to possess the gates of the
[1:27:12] enemy but you're going to have your
[1:27:14] tests you're going to have your trials
[1:27:17] and abraham and i mean in daniel he
[1:27:19] would stood it with the lion's den is
[1:27:21] that right so when they put him in there
[1:27:23] and that lions then then daniel they
[1:27:26] tried to make a decree they made a law
[1:27:29] see they're going to start making laws
[1:27:31] against us to bring pressure against us
[1:27:34] i heard the holy spirit say wednesday
[1:27:36] night you have to understand that the
[1:27:39] catholic church is already in position
[1:27:42] they're already there it's just a matter
[1:27:44] of time our three leading financial
[1:27:48] institutions in america has to report to
[1:27:51] the pope once a year they're getting
[1:27:54] these things lined up the prophet of god
[1:27:56] already told us these things who have
[1:27:58] believed our report
[1:28:00] and to whom has the arm the power of the
[1:28:03] lord been revealed to you only get the
[1:28:05] revealing comes to you when you believe
[1:28:08] all the word and the only one can unfold
[1:28:11] it to you the only one can grant you the
[1:28:13] holy ghost is god he knows if you really
[1:28:16] believe all the word so daniel what
[1:28:18] stood the test is that right how about
[1:28:20] shadrach meshach and abednego is that
[1:28:23] right
[1:28:24] they was mighty men of god they're our
[1:28:27] brothers we're going to see them we're
[1:28:29] going to ask daniel what happened in the
[1:28:32] lions then when we see him ah

[1:28:52] of you children they know that it's a
[1:28:54] different character they know it's a
[1:28:56] different anointing they recognize as
[1:28:58] something different even your dress code

[1:38:10] he did not have his salvation
[1:38:12] but he had all those other things great
[1:38:15] riches and things and he kept the 10
[1:38:18] commandments
[1:38:20] but when he saw jesus he saw a character
[1:38:24] that he did not have
[1:38:27] you young ladies
[1:38:29] don't be conformed to the world your
[1:38:32] father said
[1:38:33] be ye not conformed to this world but be
[1:38:37] what transformed by the renewing of your
[1:38:40] mind
[1:38:41] is that paul said i beseech you brethren
[1:38:46] by the way by the mercies of god
[1:38:49] never forget the mercies of god
[1:38:52] that's been extended to us someone out
[1:38:55] there we are not to conform to the world
[1:38:58] they see something different inside of
[1:39:01] you that they're thirsting for we got
[1:39:04] the goods because we know every human
[1:39:07] being was created to be in the image of
[1:39:10] god
[1:39:11] when they were there to be in the image
[1:39:13] of god
[1:39:14] so we know that they're really thirsting
[1:39:16] for god
[1:39:18] now we're just looking for that open
[1:39:20] door to tell them about jesus to tell
[1:39:23] them about the goodness of the lord i
[1:39:25] heard brother brown even say oh do all
[1:39:28] that you can for someone out there
[1:39:30] because don't let them come down to hell
[1:39:33] don't let them you don't want them to go
[1:39:35] to that place so we doing all we can is
[1:39:39] just to so souls can we can become salty
[1:39:42] so they can desire what we have saints
[1:39:46] what you're getting now god is just
[1:39:48] unfolding the mysteries into his special
[1:39:50] bride because you're hungry and
[1:39:52] thirsting and the scripture has to be
[1:39:54] fulfilled is that right so the
[1:39:57] difference between balaam and balak
[1:40:00] bellam what he had balaam was jealous
[1:40:03] because moses was the messenger on the
[1:40:06] scene at the time but moses had the
[1:40:09] signs and wonders following them they
[1:40:12] had the vindication the vindication has
[1:40:15] to be here so when those that last time
[1:40:18] we were here we were saying they were
[1:40:20] bowing down at their feet of faith that
[1:40:23] worketh by love
[1:40:25] with that love that has been working
[1:40:27] they ran they bowed down at their feet
[1:40:29] they humbled yourself but what god is
[1:40:31] calling for us to do in this age not to
[1:40:34] run and bow down at a man's feet or not
[1:40:37] to do it in that type of work but he
[1:40:39] want us once we receive the holy spirit
[1:40:42] it's your character it's a lived life is
[1:40:45] what he's requiring from us in this time
[1:40:48] now so you don't have to worry if you
[1:40:51] stumble if you stumble here if you
[1:40:53] stumble there but what you have to
[1:40:55] realize you can always look unto the
[1:40:59] cross
[1:41:00] remember what the blood of jesus christ
[1:41:03] have done for you that's why he put up
[1:41:05] that brazen serpent for israel in the
[1:41:08] wilderness so they can always look and
[1:41:10] believe on the cross it was a type is
[1:41:13] that right it was a type of over there
[1:41:15] when abraham when his test came when he
[1:41:18] had to slew isaac and even after 25
[1:41:21] years and god told him to go through
[1:41:23] isaac which god don't tell us to do
[1:41:25] those things anymore but god he had the
[1:41:28] slew isaac but he was but it was a type
[1:41:31] of him going to that mountain as christ
[1:41:34] going to calvary for you and i as we
[1:41:37] were in the mind of him before the
[1:41:39] foundation of the world we were at
[1:41:41] calvary also so we have to understand
[1:41:44] what god is bringing us into now to
[1:41:47] finish the plan of redemption always
[1:41:50] looking for that lost soul no matter
[1:41:52] where you're at you're out there we know
[1:41:54] where we come from we know where we're
[1:41:57] going we know we're going in the rapture
[1:41:59] is that right
[1:42:00] god promised it according to the
[1:42:02] scriptures let me keep reading i want
[1:42:04] you to see this here help me lord
[1:42:08] he said now look
[1:42:11] but he told them
[1:42:13] verse 6
[1:42:14] be strong
[1:42:16] and be of a good courage
[1:42:19] for unto this people shall thou divine
[1:42:22] for an inheritance the land which i
[1:42:24] swear unto thee
[1:42:25] father to give verse 8
[1:42:29] he said this book
[1:42:31] of the law shall not depart out of thy
[1:42:33] mouth
[1:42:34] but thou shall what
[1:42:36] meditate
[1:42:37] therein day
[1:42:38] and night and thou mayest do what
[1:42:41] observe doing according to that is
[1:42:44] written therein for then thou shalt make
[1:42:47] thy way what
[1:42:49] you want to know why some of you
[1:42:50] struggling
[1:42:51] what is it that you're not doing
[1:42:54] god god promised that you should you
[1:42:56] could ask abundantly also if you're not
[1:42:59] asking in a selfish motive you can also
[1:43:01] you can get why aren't you prospering
[1:43:04] you see if god now is is that the
[1:43:06] perfect willing for you did you ask god
[1:43:09] he i send a quote to a brother one time
[1:43:11] and i was saying you want to see a real
[1:43:12] christian that's successful a real
[1:43:15] christian that's a housewife a worker no
[1:43:18] matter what they are they'll always seek
[1:43:21] christ
[1:43:22] first so then if it doesn't work
[1:43:27] lord
[1:43:28] now you gave me this
[1:43:30] that's why the last time when we was
[1:43:32] here
[1:43:32] remember the widow woman
[1:43:34] when a child dies she went to
[1:43:36] elijah is that right
[1:43:39] [Music]
[1:43:42] he said that's what she said
[1:43:45] you get by his grace
[1:43:47] but he knew
[1:43:49] a woman still want a child being a
[1:43:52] mother is a female she want a child
[1:43:56] but if you really down inside you want
[1:43:58] that child
[1:44:00] is that right start getting things ready
[1:44:03] get the crib ready go buy the clothes on
[1:44:07] if you get a little later in years go
[1:44:10] buy twins buy something for twins
[1:44:12] is that right
[1:44:14] lose the frightful because why because
[1:44:17] god's promised you that you should not
[1:44:20] be unfruitful or burned
[1:44:24] you got right bring it to god
[1:44:26] she went
[1:44:28] she ran

[1:53:13] people
[1:53:14] huh you're trying to force something on
[1:53:16] people that's not proven doc
[1:53:18] and he looked at me and that's when he
[1:53:20] backed up why
[1:53:21] because they know
[1:53:23] i thought about samson and delilah
[1:53:25] anything
[1:53:27] that is persistent that's not according
[1:53:30] to the words
[1:53:31] it's the sequel
[1:53:37] you gotta you got you gotta you you you
[1:53:40] you got to understand what's going on
[1:53:42] don't be afraid
[1:53:43] why because the prophet of god told me
[1:53:47] this was going to happen before it
[1:53:49] happened and he gave me the solution he
[1:53:52] said you gotta know before you can have
[1:53:54] a cure you gotta know the cause is that
[1:53:57] right he know because it is sinful life
[1:54:00] america and the world have dropped their
[1:54:03] moral stand nuts and there's no coming
[1:54:06] back for them but he told us what's the
[1:54:08] solution he said it's all under the what
[1:54:11] the blood
[1:54:13] put it up under the blood
[1:54:15] the blood today is the baptism of the
[1:54:18] holy ghost saints the life is in the
[1:54:21] blood and you can look them in their
[1:54:24] eyes is that right because you're the
[1:54:26] apple of god's eye
[1:54:28] god is going to keep and keep an eye out
[1:54:30] for his apple is that right you don't
[1:54:32] have to receive anything that doesn't
[1:54:34] line up with the word of god let me keep
[1:54:37] going hallelujah
[1:54:40] look what he says
[1:54:41] he says now who redeemeth he said who
[1:54:44] healeth all thy diseases
[1:54:47] all dies diseases don't you let nobody
[1:54:50] try to say you afflict you with anything
[1:54:53] and they come with you speak the word
[1:54:56] you can get hit sick you can get sick
[1:54:58] and get healed you can get sick again
[1:55:00] but you keep claiming the blood of jesus
[1:55:03] christ
[1:55:04] and what god has done for you don't ever
[1:55:07] back up because you got a scripture
[1:55:08] right there you say lord in psalms 103
[1:55:13] you say you are the lord god that you
[1:55:16] heal of all thy diseases and you can't
[1:55:19] move until i speak it and lord i spoke
[1:55:23] the word and now you're the healer it's
[1:55:26] your faith lord
[1:55:29] let me look what he says he says now
[1:55:33] help me lord he says who
[1:55:35] who redeemed thy life from what
[1:55:40] how many of us was out there living that
[1:55:42] sinful life
[1:55:44] huh
[1:55:46] and the lord watched on me he said i
[1:55:48] watched over you even when you was yet
[1:55:51] in your sins
[1:55:54] you see you gotta you gotta stand with
[1:55:56] staying the test
[1:55:57] okay because your test is coming
[1:56:00] little children you go to school
[1:56:02] teachers say you got a test on friday

[1:56:06] do your homework
[1:56:10] you ain't doing your homework you didn't
[1:56:11] study see everybody get around any way
[1:56:14] you could get around the boy you try to

[1:56:33] things he says who satisfy thy mouth
[1:56:36] with what
[1:56:37] good things so that thy youth is what
[1:56:41] renewed like eagles so that's why when
[1:56:44] the holy spirit was telling the pastor
[1:56:46] he says what blessings come from our
[1:56:49] mouths
[1:56:50] not curses
[1:56:51] blessings come from our mouth you know
[1:56:54] when the lord you know you got to know

[1:57:24] and i told him i said yeah
[1:57:26] the lord told me i gotta go
[1:57:28] we had to leave our house
[1:57:31] had a little moved into a small place
[1:57:33] moved to the northeast
[1:57:35] up in pennsylvania
[1:57:37] he said i said yeah i gotta go
[1:57:40] we went there
[1:57:42] i don't know we got about three
[1:57:43] different pictures there
[1:57:45] i don't know if you can see that real
[1:57:47] good but to see the gentleman in the
[1:57:48] white shirt
[1:57:51] stand up about y'alls
[1:57:53] that was brother charles
[1:57:55] that's who the lord had sent me after
[1:57:58] and we stayed up there for five years
[1:58:01] that's his father that's his uncle
[1:58:03] sister sarah is not here
[1:58:05] and we had a little pool in there i
[1:58:07] don't know if that one david show you
[1:58:08] where we're baptizing them at
[1:58:13] and we're baptized you know where that
[1:58:14] little trough was at
[1:58:16] that was right in my front room
[1:58:19] that old door as soon as that door right
[1:58:20] there you go outside as soon as you come
[1:58:22] in the door you're in the front room
[1:58:25] and we were right there we put that
[1:58:26] trough in there we filled it up with
[1:58:28] water
[1:58:29] and we went up there for four or five
[1:58:31] years had to stay for five years i
[1:58:33] didn't know brother charles was there
[1:58:34] but i know the lord was sending me
[1:58:37] and so you got to understand god will
[1:58:40] test you
[1:58:41] god will tried you but he will not
[1:58:43] forget the faithful and we went up there
[1:58:46] and we were baptizing them and we worked
[1:58:49] there and when we sat there i never
[1:58:51] forget we went to that business brother
[1:58:52] charles was just sitting there by
[1:58:54] himself and something pricked my heart
[1:58:56] when i first saw him
[1:58:58] but i'm showing you every god is going
[1:59:00] to try and test you and you don't know
[1:59:03] where he'll send you in
[1:59:04] but he'll send you
[1:59:06] that's the club that's my time
[1:59:08] i don't know if you have time to show
[1:59:10] those other ones david but uh
[1:59:12] can you see it clear
[1:59:14] i mean that's brother charles on the
[1:59:15] right i said the white that's me and the
[1:59:17] white shirt that's brother charles on
[1:59:18] the right side
[1:59:22] we're getting that wrong but i say that
[1:59:24] and so when we came back
[1:59:27] he was a young fella
[1:59:29] and he was a young face still a young
[1:59:30] fellow to me when he came back there
[1:59:34] and and
[1:59:35] oh boy
[1:59:37] i didn't realize i realized it been that
[1:59:39] long
[1:59:39] but uh
[1:59:41] i'm glad i had a chance to show that
[1:59:43] but you know
[1:59:44] i say that because
[1:59:47] every test
[1:59:50] but it's a testimony
[1:59:52] that comes after that test
[1:59:56] if god send you to do something
[1:59:59] god will vindicate it
[2:00:01] and that was the difference with moses
[2:00:03] and with balaam and balak
[2:00:06] moses had god with him and god was
[2:00:09] vindicating that he was with him
[2:00:11] and so that's the reason why
[2:00:14] if you down in her soul
[2:00:16] there's always a burning desire for
[2:00:18] those lost souls that's there with that
[2:00:20] true believer
[2:00:22] now true believer no matter what
[2:00:25] something and god put a seed inside of
[2:00:27] you and if you just pray and whatever he
[2:00:31] whatever he sent you here to do but one
[2:00:33] of the things he sent all of us to do is
[2:00:36] to become co-workers with him and we
[2:00:38] finish this plan of redemption
[2:00:40] boy i'll tell you before i before
[2:00:43] let's turn to um
[2:00:44] uh first peter
[2:00:47] let's turn to first peter
[2:00:48] and
[2:00:51] god help me chapter two
[2:00:56] first peter
[2:01:00] chapter two
[2:01:01] in musicians you can come forward
[2:01:04] he says
[2:01:06] unto you therefore
[2:01:08] which believe he
[2:01:11] is precious
[2:01:13] he says amen did i get
[2:01:15] am i right okay verse nine i'm sorry
[2:01:17] verse nine
[2:01:19] first peter chapter two verse nine but
[2:01:20] you are a chosen generation
[2:01:24] a royal priesthood
[2:01:26] a holy nation
[2:01:29] a peculiar people
[2:01:32] he says that ye
[2:01:33] should show forth one
[2:01:36] of who
[2:01:38] who have what
[2:01:41] out of what
[2:01:42] into his what
[2:01:47] i tell you saints
[2:01:49] those praises
[2:01:50] and that's what the holy spirit is
[2:01:52] ministering through the pastor
[2:01:54] is words of blessing sweet and bitter
[2:01:56] water cannot come out of the same fount
[2:02:00] the royal seed
[2:02:03] everyone in the natural seed
[2:02:05] had to die
[2:02:08] but the royal seized
[2:02:10] you're the royal sea i'm not even worthy

[2:02:14] before you
[2:02:17] you have been bought that's right
[2:02:19] brother abel you have been bought
[2:02:22] by the blood of god
[2:02:26] that's right brother the blood of god
[2:02:29] and it even came down because he no man
[2:02:33] was worthy
[2:02:35] the angels wanted to come
[2:02:38] but he said no
[2:02:41] i can't send an angel after you
[2:02:46] i gotta come myself
[2:02:52] he got in the body created that seed
[2:02:55] and

[2:03:00] leave my what holy one my holy one
[2:03:03] should not seek corruption and whether i
[2:03:05] will not leave them where in hell is
[2:03:07] that right leave his body in hell you
[2:03:10] can go to psalms 16 10 16 and verse 10 i
[2:03:13] think he worked it in there
[2:03:16] he said i wasn't going to do it
[2:03:19] so when christ came
[2:03:22] got in that body
[2:03:24] he formed that seed
[2:03:27] he knew all of our infirmities
[2:03:30] he know what each and every one of us is
[2:03:32] going through
[2:03:35] but we you are the royal seed of abraham
[2:03:39] you don't have to claim nothing
[2:03:44] they had to die in the old testament
[2:03:46] mighty men of god
[2:03:50] conquered what god sent them to do
[2:03:53] but it was two seas abraham caught the
[2:03:55] revelation
[2:03:57] when god told him to look in the skies
[2:03:59] see the stars
[2:04:03] he knew it was going to be a royal scene
[2:04:05] a faith seed that had to
[2:04:08] come but this seed all we have to do is
[2:04:11] walk in it

[2:07:16] simple but powerful
[2:07:18] [Music]
[2:07:19] you can set someone free
[2:07:24] that's right brother your words
[2:07:27] if you go on into the message i don't
[2:07:29] have time to go no but if you look going
[2:07:31] and go back and looking at possessing
[2:07:33] the gates of the enemy after your trial
[2:07:36] after your test
[2:07:40] you don't pass it well it's coming again
[2:07:44] don't pass it it's coming again
[2:07:47] see there's two seeds
[2:07:50] remember we're always the sun remember
[2:07:52] when we put on the royal garments
[2:07:56] they talked about the prophecy i
[2:07:58] remember the lord had the pastor work
[2:07:59] that with the royal garments
[2:08:02] in those royal garments
[2:08:04] when they started with hillary but it
[2:08:05] wasn't hillary
[2:08:07] but it was uh a harris
[2:08:10] and she had on her royal garments
[2:08:13] and was here in the royal garments we
[2:08:15] know that the prophecy was being
[2:08:17] fulfilled
[2:08:20] but what the lord showed me when brother
[2:08:22] branham also said
[2:08:24] when this message of adoption it was two
[2:08:27] sons
[2:08:29] and one of his brother was always a son
[2:08:31] but one of them got the royal garment
[2:08:33] because he was obedient until the word
[2:08:35] of god
[2:08:38] he had just as right as the father
[2:08:41] but what that show me now it was time
[2:08:44] for us to step up and be all put on our
[2:08:46] royal garments
[2:08:50] we're living below our standards
[2:08:53] start moving into what god has given us

[2:09:18] somebody

[2:09:23] that faith is no longer your faith
[2:09:27] it's his faith he's working it through
[2:09:30] you let us bow our heads
[2:09:32] [Music]
