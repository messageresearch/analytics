you know may be seated i was just thinking on the way to church this evening the craziness with the the gas shortage because of a virus i don't know how many of you are aware of exactly what happened but someone had a virus somewhere that they led into the network of the of the company and that virus spread throughout their entire network and and brought the network down and caused you know the flow of gas and and everything we're dealing with but i was thinking about it on the way to church and brother braham talked about a virus a root of bitterness being like a virus in the body of believers and i thought about how a root of bitterness will get into one person and if you don't recognize that virus that virus can spread and it can spread throughout the whole body of believers and then you know all it takes is activating that virus and it could it could shut everything down so i was just thinking that i'm like let no root of bitterness be in the church rather replace it with the holy spirit let that holy spirit come in as a virus spread throughout the body of believers and that we can just you know be all in unity and love one another but i was just thinking that it's just something small and if satan can slip it in then it'll cause it'll cause a pandemic so we just want to be sure that we we love one another and that that holy ghost is is here and flowing and i believe it is i believe it is so we're thankful for that this evening does anyone have a special on their heart this evening brother robert and sister shannon amen god bless you all i've had this special in my heart for about two weeks and i keep putting it off and someday i had to repent said lord i should not be putting it off i just want to sing it for his glory something was preached two weeks ago and it reminded me of our position as kings and priests in this end time and how we have to intercede for our loved ones [Music] i also want to do mine please i just want to give the lord a lot of praise today i was feeling really um not really discouraged but just such a heaviness i'm trying to get some work done i was working at the church and it was just so heavy to start but i got going and uh my mind went back on last sunday's service and um as i began to think about that i really felt a strong presence coming to the building and it was the presence of the lord and was he just i just began to weep and worship him and like he was just standing right there you know it was just such an experience just thank god for encouraging couraging us that way praise god the cry went out and the destroyers gathered in each one with his weapon in his hand [Music] to slay both young and old destroyers the command had come for judgment now to fall [Music] but from the heart of god came forth a cry [Music] to the one in white linen that stood by [Music] go through the host before the judgment strikes and find the ones with my very life see only those who sigh and cry redeemers at the end of time see lonely priests and kings of god seal only those who intercede pleading lord preserve thy seed in time of wrath o lord remember mercy only those who sigh and cry for they are the lamb's wife they have the mind of christ [Music] moses cried o lord if you'll forgive o take my life so that they might lift [Music] for their sakes i would be cast away interceding for the people every day the soul yet prayed o man of god have mercy [Music] consider now my life and the fifty [Music] i know that you have called and judgment it did fall oh let my life be [Music] the precious oh man of god

everything he's the head of man the head of the women have the head of the church he's above every principalities and power amen and that's the lamb of god the lord jesus christ blessed be the name of the lord we appreciate everybody tonight pressing on with that virus amen it was a natural virus now it's no longer a natural virus it's now an electronic virus everything the devil can to keep us away from the presence of the lord he will but may god grant his grace and his blessings upon you because you could have stayed home and say you know what i need to preserve my guys amen we preserve the gods for work not for church are you there if somebody is not feeling a little bit all right they can go to work but if they're not feeling a little bit all right oh no i'm not going to church the first thing that comes the one that suffered is church amen amen i'm not leaving my home fine oh i need to go grab something at walmart you're going let's go to church no it's raining ah it's monday you go to work it's raining it's a big storm on sunday morning no church one of these days the ecumenical council will help you up they will close that church and you're going to stay home all you want and you're going to regret for not having given the lamb of god a lot to be of your sacrifice just as an offering for him because he bore your shame he died for you he paid the price he watched over you he doesn't even slumber no sleep why are you dipping asleep the lord is there watching many people passed away with this coffee you are still alive amen let's offer our life unto the lamb because he belongs to him he is the owner amen you never know what can happen in the next minute right you never know where death can meet you and that would be the last thing that's right you might say i'm going to wait to do this i'm going to wait to do this and before you know it you'll make her nature amen so while you still have strength power opportunity open your door and make it a sacrifice unto the lamb amen blessed be the name of the lord if you don't fight they're not going to make things easy for you they're trying to make things harder so if you don't want to fight you're going to find yourself dead amen don't worry i hope i've finished what i have to finish today from sunday that you will see what happened to the window of jezebel remember jezebel painted her face we checked that one out we are still on the jezebel tying her head we're dealing with the hair now the grace that is under uh the headship when you get to jezebel on the window that window can kill you it is only for emergency purpose you will see that on sunday if we reach to the point where we finish here so remember on sunday if uh to the best of my understanding brother mike it's gonna be the building fund yes sir so the trustee confirm it it's checked amen again we have uh a precious elder inside here it's hard for me standing here with an elder such as brother gerard hughes brother we appreciate you church trust me i'm trying my best to get him so one of this day the lord willing you're going to see him standing here and me sitting in the back then we can glean some wisdom from the elders amen but we appreciate him standing and fellowshipping with us tonight and he's very very welcome this is home brother use god which will bless you from the sacrifice do you know how long he have to drive to come here did he spare his gaza you see how god can bring just one person and then you all find yourself lord where is the gate to hell i'm ready to go but thank god for grace amen blessed be the name of the lord let's go to our scripture tonight we're going to pick up where we stop on sunday and you understand to stay under the proper head because there is a grace there is an equipment that is loaded there amen and that equipment is handy you need it when in extreme situation if not we can make it amen but thank god for predestination i have to bring this example one by one so you anchored ready you remember jesus gave a test a parable in the scripture he says there's there were two men that were building houses but one of them had to dig until he reached the rock he have to dig so sometimes we gotta dig into the world the message has been digged from the bible it was hidden esther chapter eight you already know this but i want to make a point there so we move on if you're there you can say amen esther chapter eight verse one on that day did king a hazardous give the house of heaven the jew's enemy to esther we already explained you this the house of amen that power that was coming everything was under the jurisdiction of esther which is the top of the brother we already demonstrated to you esther is the bride and mordecai is brother brother the seven ninja who's working with the bride and bringing the bride all the way to the presence of the king amen he said the house of the jew of heaven the jews enemy to esther the queen and mordecai came before the king for esther had told what he was to her and the king took off his ring remember that ring was the one heyman wrote and hold the letter and seal it and once that ring goes there it is irrevocable amen but let's see to whom god is gonna our king a hazaris or god he's gonna give darien and the king took off his ring the wing of the king which he had taken from heaven temporarily and gave it to esther why he didn't give it to esther the power of the headship the power of the headship that ring is given to modica you remember zorobel he's a signet amen that ring is given to the messenger he's the one that have the ring if he says something the king automatically will have to approve because the approval the seal of the king is with him if he writes something he put a seal it's going to pass but it's given to the head because remember mordecai was the legal guardian to forfest esther didn't have his father mother they all died so she was under the jurisdiction of monica amen so our old natural family that we were born under we are now reborn by the bread into the blood by the son of god who free us from our old nature now are being born you wonder the jurisdiction of malachi 4. amen and there is a grace that goes under malachi 4. you got to stay under the amen let's go to verse uh let's go to verse seven then king then the king a hazaris said to esther after she pleaded the queen and tomorrow they caught the jews behold i have given esther the house of heaven and him they have hanged upon the carlos because he laid his hand upon the jews we know what the jews are in the new testament they are the children of god paul explained to us who a true jew is verse 8 write you also for the jews as he likes you in other words as he wishes you whatever you wanted you write it amen in the in the king's name you see where the power comes from under the headship of the king and the headship of monika now monica can say something in the king's name with the signal and it will be approved and seal it with the king's ring for the writing which is written in the king's name and sealed with the king's ring may no man do water so once they seal it it is completed amen verse 9 then were the king's crab called at that time in the third month you might be seated that is the month seven and the three and twentieth day thereof it was written according to all that esther commanded who's writing makes sense to all that mordechai commanded to the jews and to the lieutenants and the deputies and the rulers of the provinces which are from india to ethiopia a hundred and twenty and seven provinces to every province according to the riding thereof and to every people after the water that's why they have to translate the message in many languages so he can be carried away amen every language and to the jews according to the writing according to the water language the seal was given to mordecai because he's the head and that still have a power in a difficult situation like the one a man already got permission to destroy the jews they had the right to reverse that situation if you stay under the proper headship amen let's go to matthew chapter 10. the headship the hair of a woman what a mystery what a mystery no one the brother brother i'm saying go home and study amen if somebody's really really catch it it seems like we are preaching marriage and divorce have you caught that have you got it since we started our headship go take the tape of marriage and divorce and put it and go back to 33 34 35 it's like we're preaching marriage and divorce matthew chapter 10 verse 5. if you're there you can say amen these 12 jesus sent forth and commanded them saying god not into the way of water number one the gentile gentile one gentile amen kama and into any city of the samaritan enter you not number two the samaritan how many time have you heard brother brown i'm telling you jew gentile samaritan jew gentiles and he never gave you a scripture you thought he was lying amen enter you not verse six but go rather to the lordship of the house of water your coat is ready next time somebody say where is that in the scripture you know where it is the gentile the samaritan and the jew three classes brother branham keep repeating them it is in the scripture the message is perfectly in line with the scripture amen but the key here is jesus told the disciple don't go here anybody here do not go there ever here the only door that is open right now is the door of the jew it is that safe the lord let's go to chapter 15. that says the lord in other words if a gentile want to come in do they have an acceptance if a samaritan want to come in do they have an access let's see what proper headship does amen you will really appreciate the message if it was not for this message we will be cornered in denomination and doomed to the slaughter 15 verse 21 if you dare you can say amen then jesus went from there and departed into the coast of water and water are those israelites okay it's not empty territory for israel and behold a woman of canaan came out of the same coast and cry to him saying have mercy on me o lord you son of water why did he do why did she call son of david because the door that was opened was water israel son of david so she's using the jewish law okay she didn't know you must show your id amen and cried to him saying have mercy on me o lord you son of david my daughter is grievously fixed with the devil but he answered her not why that woman was a sorrow phoenician anybody clear the door is not open to the gentile lock the woman could turn around and say you know what there's no need for me to do anything let me go ahead amen but he answered her not a word and his disciple came and besought him saying send her away for she cries after so somebody was persistent even though the door is closed to the gentile still that person is persistent because they understood the head amen but he answer and say i am not sent back to the lordship of the house of water in other words the only available door right now is only the jewish door so there is nothing i can do for this woman because she's not a jew amen i'm just reading a scripture verse 25 then can she and do water and worship him saying water was that the time of the gentile yet [Music] but that woman pushed that door out like abraham and say lord remember lot the first time say my lord and he got in trouble by the second time when lord said lord then an anointing drop amen when she said she worshiped and said my lord then even though it's not the time there is a power and appropriation then comes here and worship him saying lord help me oh so this is working so now because he worshipped jesus jesus is going to tell her now i understand sweetheart come on now and tell me what is going on let's see what's happening amen but he answer and say it is not meat it's not fitting to take the children bread the children were israel and to cast it to her in other words you were dug i cannot take again what belonged to the children and give it to you i already told you that this door is only to the jewish people amen even if the message call you a buzzard because of the life you are living don't go out stay with the message even if the message rebuke you stand with the message this is a proof to show who is predestinated if you back off you were not meant for it [Applause] brother branham is hard on the system right one of his wire hard on the sister sister stand with the message as hard as it seems to be stand with the message [Applause] hallelujah and she said truth in other words what you say is right truth lord yet the dogs who gave her the resolution who told her that yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table what an aspiration in other words your door is closed but remember there is a grace that usually owes out underneath the table i am not looking for the door i can get that small club of grace that's all i need to make it to my destination hallelujah hallelujah all i need is a crumb of grace just tell the crimes just a little dropping the priest on brother kelly just that last job that's all i need to take me to heaven hallelujah oh truth lord yet dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table then jesus answered and said to her oh woman great is your water what faith open a gentile door before the time your faith be it to you even as you water in other words whatever you wanted whatever that woman had in her mind no matter the difficulty no matter the situation no matter how big the issue is whatever was inserted that grace was sufficient to grant her request amen and her daughter was made all from that very hour everybody clear so far let's go to luke chapter 7 then we pray blessed be the name of the lord understanding proper headsheet that had sheep might be tough sometime but you stay with it because grace will always come there remember on sunday that's why david said let me fall in the hand of god if he want to slay me let me fall in his hand then his mercy something will come out there and rescue me from his hand amen and matter of fact if you're in the hand of god nobody can pluck you out you see david you see david in other words put me there and i'm gonna see who's gonna pluck me out of there luke chapter 7 verse 1. you there you can say amen now when he had ended all his saying in the audience of the people he entered into capernaum and a certain centurion servant who was dear to him was sick and ready to die and when he heard faith of jesus he sent to him the elders of the jew remember the door was the door to him so this one understands a little bit he said hey let me get the jews and bring my request to the jew and let the jew goes and the jew can enter and they can bring on my request because the door is the door to the jew amen he sent him the elders of the jew beseeching in other words begging him that he would come and heal his servant and when they came to jesus they besought him instantly they are pleading saying that he was worthy for whom he should do this in other words this person is worthy hallelujah for he loves our nation like ruth remember your people will be my people remember rahab i want to go with you i don't want to die here he loves our nation and he has built us a welcome he even built a church he's not just like any other gentile that is up there that is still worshiping adult this one is a proselyte to the god of israel he is part of our commonwealth amen then jesus went with them if you notice jesus never refused because they used the jew to insert the petition amen then jesus went with them and when he was now not far from the house the house of who of the centurion a house of a gentile he's bringing the jews but going to the gentile but the gentiles have a lock amen the centurion said who now friends we don't know who they are to him saying to him lord not son of david lord trouble not yourself for i am not what the jews said he was worthy but when he's approaching he said i am not worthy hallelujah i am not worthy that you should enter under my water i am a gentile the gentle door is closed you only came for the lordship of the house of israel i am not worthy for you to enter here i don't want to deviate to your program but i'm looking for something amen wherefore neither thought i myself worthy to do what are not even worthy to come to you our door is closed amen to come to you but say in a word and my servant shall be healed for i also am a man set under water i understand headship [Applause] [Music] in the scripture i understand hardship i understand authority and because i understand authority i understand what is going on amen for i am a man set under authority having under me water soldiers and i say to one go and he goes and to another calm and he comes and to my servant do this and he does this when jesus heard these things amen he marvel at him and turn him about and say to the people that follow water i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in water was it the time of the gentile he can pull the door open amen and they that were sent returning to the house found the servant hole that had been watered when every hope seems to be closed if you understand proper headship a door of mercy a door of grace can be opened just to rescue the predestination let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us father in this time when girls become a problem lord you have provided that for us so that we can make it to church father not only make it to church but your presence is here to answer lord father our need and father to feed your sheep lord if there is anything that we did in our life that might be a hindrance to our blessings father we ask that you forgive us lord may you remember this request of sister priscilla unto the hand may father you touch it and lord grant the request according to its need lord father may you bless us and may the devil be completely sealed out of this place may only the holy spirit and the angels of the lord minister to your children tonight and those that are streaming lord move me completely out of the way lord and father speak to your children and bless our soul strengthen our body lord father enlighten our faith more and more into the depths of christ as we humbly ask it in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you you've already been seated we're going to continue where we left off on sunday we're on part 36. everybody clear so far we established by the understanding of the hair of a woman the headship we found that the headship of the entire bride the the headship of everything was crushed which is the chief shepherd or the chief pastor then for every age according to the gentile dispensation there is seven columns upon which the wisdom of god set and a column remember and a column represented a man which shows the seventh messenger through every seven church ages and they have the door to the entrance into the blood and those seven messengers brother branham said that every messenger was a pastor to his church that was the head of the church ages amen then after the messenger come the local pastor which should be under the messenger of his age then under that local pastor who is following the messenger who is following christ should be the husband and the father or the legal guardian amen and we found out that with the headship goes a special grace that we demonstrated on sunday in the life of abraham lincoln when that boy was declared guilty but a pardon could be issued regardless of the decision of the court the boy rejected and he was fired and killed and the supreme court said pardon is a pardon only when it's received as a pardon amen but to receive as a pardon you must recognize and understand the proper head shift there is a special grace and that special grace bring a special bring a special pardon amen when we say a special grace and a special pardon this grace here is not a door to disgrace amen because it's very easy when the door of grace is open that somebody bring it as a disgrace let's go to genesis chapter 12. before you know it somebody will say hey i'm the head i can do this i can do this so you miss grace it is a grace that comes under emergency when everything is tight whenever thing is completely gone all hope are gone no more mercy everything is gone it comes in tight situation under emergency and it usually comes simple amen genesis chapter 12 if you're there you can say amen verse 10 and there was a famine in the land a tight situation happened to abraham anybody clear and abram went down into egypt he left the promised land a child of god and elect of god under pressure because of the touch situation left the promised land and went outside into the world to sojourn the day in other words to stay there temporarily for the famine was grievous in the land it's a test and he moved out and he came to pass when he was come near to enter into egypt that he said to sarah his wife behold now and know that you are a fair woman to look upon that beauty was on the face we're going to see that later on therefore it shall come to pass when the egyptians shall see you that they shall say this is his wife and they will kill me but they will save you alive or all these manipulations all these uh preparation of lies happen because somebody moved out of a position amen say i pray you you are my sister that he may be well remember i have a certain percentage of truth amendment that he may be well with me for your sake and my soul shall live because of you and it came to pass that when abraham was coming to egypt the egyptian beheld the woman that she was fair job told us what i fear is what happened to me amen the priest is also a pharaoh saw her and commanded her before pharaoh and the woman was taken in pharaoh's house and he treated abraham well for his sake and he had ship and oxen and he asses and men servants and made servants and she asses and camel prospering under a lie amen and the lord did water even though abraham is found in a tight corner amen he already messed up he already brought open a door to a spirit of life to his home even under that circumstances the promise of the covenant of god still stands sure amen the head of abraham responded and the lord plagued pharaoh and his house with great pledge because of who sarah abraham's wife and pharaoh called abraham and said to him what is this that you have done to me why did you not tell me that she was your wife why said you she is my sister so i might have taken her to me as a wife now therefore behold your wife take care and yo and go your way god protected sarah despite the error of abraham everybody so far go to genesis chapter 20. amen it's a special grace but it's not a door for disgrace amen genesis chapter 20. if you dare you can say amen i believe abraham learned from this mistake and he would not do that again amen and abraham journeyed from there toward the south country and dwell between kaddish and shu and sergeant in guerra and abraham said to who the second time again you thought he learned say to sarah his wife she is my sister and i'll be malek who so abimelech was a king as a king he was the head anybody in front of me of his country when the head move out opposition this is what happened an abimelech king of geralt said and took sarah but god came to abimelech in a dream by night and said to him be all you are but what god still come down to protect what a love for the woman which you have taken for she is a man's wife somebody else my wife in other words she's married but abimelech had not come near to work so god protected sarah right at the edge abraham already gave sarah out amen and had not come near here and he said lord will you slay also a water so the nation of abimelech was a water let's see what's going on amen say he not to me she is my sister and she even she herself said he is my brother in other words they both agreed to lie when ananias and sapphira did this god kill both of that's them but in the case of abraham god is lingering [Music] it's a grace not a door to disgrace amen he is my brother in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have i done this verse 6 and god said to him in the dream yeah in other words god confirmed the heart of ability he said yes i know that you did this in the integrity of your heart for i also did whatever look at grace blocking protecting sarah i withheld you from sinning against me therefore allow i not to touch her now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a worker you don't play with prophets amen for he is the prophet and he shall pray for you and you shall leave and if you restore her not know you that you shall surely do what you and all that are therefore abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and throwed all these things in their ears and the men were so refrained greatly afraid then abhimarra called abraham and said to him what have you done to us and what have i offended you that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great water you have done deeds to me that ought not to be done you behave like like a sinner amen and air and abimelech said to abraham what saw you that you have done this thing amen in other words what is the reason why you did this tell me a little bit you come you lied to us now are we in trouble i just want to understand what happened why did you do this to me let's hear what abraham says amen this is where we sin many times amen and abraham said because i no benefit of that because i thought surely the fear of god is not in this this nation was a nation that was how i thought you look at me bad i touched you were angry to me i thought you didn't like me i thought and then you open the door and do something wrong presume i'm in the presumption amen that's why david said forgive me for presumption see amen you adventure without proof without authority amen i thought you were the fear of god is not in this place and they will slay me for my wife's sake and yet indeed she is my sister the little percentage she is the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife now the explanation is clear but you already told lie ever clear job to verse 17. so abraham prayed to god that god healed who so abhi malek was already sick god struck abimelech let me continue to hear abimelech and he's worked he was already married and still looking for another woman and got in trouble and his wife and his mad servant and they bought water not only was god angry to abimelech but god locked the seed of abimelech in case sarah is touched like will not function look how great it is for the lord has first closed up all the water warmth of the house of who because of sarah abraham walker when the head of the nation sinned amen that sin propagates all over amen it is a grace but it's not a great disgrace brother branham if you have time please explain matthew 10 verse 41 i would like you to know what is a prophet he wrote jesus said whosoever receive a prophet in the name of a prophet receive the water a prophet rewards there is something loaded under that ministry a prophet reward is to be friend with them whosoever receive a righteous man in the name of a righteous man receive a righteous men's reward is that right and if they want to know what a prophet reward is is to be friend to the prophet see that is a reward he is your friend like the sunumat woman it might come handy sometime sometimes you're gonna find yourself in a tight corner and if you under a correct head under the proper message of your time if grace was granted to the messenger you have a right to claim that grace blessed be the name of the lord if this woman and i who never have seen each other in our lives if the holy spirit will reveal what the woman therefore what the woman is there for you know it shall have to be supernatural then if you believe it is a work you shall receive a worker if you call this message a devil if you disgrace the message you're going to receive the devil reward amen if you believe it is god you shall receive god's reward it is the way you approach a gift how many believe this message is from god may god grant you god's reward amen now here is the woman we are not the same age first time we have ever met never met you in my life know nothing about you and if god will reveal the secret in your heart to me then i shall have to come it shall have to come through some power but up to you too if you say it's the devil in other words when i'm discerning amen when god is giving me inspiration if you blaspheme against that then you get his reward you say it's god you shall get his reward so there is two rewards either you get the devil reward or you get god's reward amen we already read this let me skip this brother branham said the thing surprises me is the grace of god i have exhausted his mercy many times but i never can exhaust his grace and i'm so glad of that everybody clear so far where was he abraham blacks leader a little lion shasta is that right oh no there are no little white lies they are either black lives or they are not lies at all the man is sitting out there telling a pine blank lie saying that was his sister when he was his wife beating around the bush and backslid because he left the promised land and here was a righteous man standing before god and say lord you know my heart but i shall not hear your prayer abimelech take her back and let him pray for you he is my weapon i shall hear him not you yeah a best leader liar but that is my prophet hallelujah that's truth that is the bible now don't go plum too far over here on the calvinistic side wants in grace always in grace because you shall get in water don't get this as an open door to commit sin because an emergency grace is open to you that emergency grace you don't prepare for it you are trapped into something then god come down to rescue you hallelujah but i don't think just because you've done something wrong that you are gone forever you are a child of god you are born of the spirit of god you are sons and daughters of god and the fruits will bear record of itself there you are amen that's why paul in romans 6 said that what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abandon god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein in other words once you serve the worship and once purge have no more desire for sin but you can find yourself in a difficult situation where you are pushed under pressure to make a wrong judgment to get to a wrong option to go to a wrong door if you are predestinated then a special grace will be released to rescue you from that situation everybody here so far amen on sunday we talked about adam and eve we explained abraham and sarah we explained moses standing in the gap you saw that we spent moses and the letter of divorcement which paul was granted also the permission and brother branham came under the crowd and said for those that follow him amen that follow his message that have been messed up here is grace that came up amen blessed be the name of the lord we explain you joshua in the battle when the situation was tight joshua spoke to the son and god answered because he was in the line of duty now let's go on six with david and the shoe brain everybody clear so far look in the town and matthew 12 verse 1 at that time jesus went the water the day of the sabbath in other words nobody's supposed to work through the cone and his disciples were hungry the law in the old testament says that if you hungry in israel if you passing through a field you have a right to enter that field and eat but don't pack anything home amen even if it doesn't belong to you if you're hungry you enter somebody else's field get the fruit eat the only thing don't pack it home what a god that provided things amen and his disciples were hungry and begin to plug the ear of god and to eat so the problem is not displacing and eating the problem is the sabbath day but when the pharisees saw it they say unto him behold that disciple do that which not allow food to do upon the water so they should be starving but he said unto them have ye not read what david did when he was working and they that were with him david was anointed by the prophet samuel as king of israel david was god anointed and saul was rejected in other words a new head of israel according to god was david but david was not alone he had people that were following him are you there so when david got in trouble into a that situation that he was hungry him and the people that follow him what happened how he entered into the house of who and did it the worker was devi the priest david was a prophet and a king not a priest and the showbread was only given to the priest but something opened the door that david entered there pulled the bread eat and nothing happened to david how he entered into the house of god and did eat the show bread which was not loveful for who this is jesus talking this is god telling you that what david did was not right which was not lawful for him to eat neither for what so it was not only good for david but for the people under david amen for them which were with him but only for the water so david was not a priest door closed the people that followed him were not preached door closed they in a type situation amen oh have you not read in the lord how that on the sabbath day the word over here the priests were justified and david was guilty over here the priests also are guilty have you not read in the lord how that on the sabbath day the priests in the temple do work profane the sabbath and i welcome a special grace was given to the priest that even if it's sabbath day he can do work and nothing happened to him amen a special grace was given to david that even though he's not qualified to eat the shortbread because he's under emergency he's followed by soul god open a grace not only for him but for the people that are following him that's why brother branham said for those that follow me and paul said follow me as i follow christ when paul gets a reward that's why brother branham said if those of paul entered my nose my center [Applause] hallelujah the priest on the sabbath day they also prophet the summer look at this case here brother branham if a man has been married and what i told you it's like i'm preaching marriage and divorce and divorce isn't that lawful see so many now i'm not saying nothing against the people just that is on the people's mind this is what i'm talking sure they are working the rapture people use not to think so much about that it was not so much of it but now it is just plastered the world it just plastered the world and the people read these things in the and people who elected out there is coming in to look at it and they see it and they are working brother branham is saying that the time of the coming of the lord is joy near the rapture is at hand and the elect of god has found themselves in some difficult time situation that they don't know how to get out of it now they look at the scripture and it looks like the scripture is condemning them yet something in them is yearning for god it looks like grace is finished for them it looks like their situation of marriage have cornered them to the point that they qualify to go to hell now they're coming to brother branham to ask questions and understanding the proper head of brother brother as a messenger of the age as the correct head of the edge he must give an answer remember on sunday the daughter of zeloped do you remember them they went to moses they say our father was not in the company of quran in other words we were not part of rejecting the message we never questioned your authority moses we never rejected your message we stood by you we have a situation moses went back to god and god opened the door and granted to those daughters what they need that's why stay with the message respect the message cherish the message accept the message and the grace of god that brought this message will always lead you to [Applause] i wish the whole church was here amen they want to know that is the reason i want to answer it but branham is not answering this for the serpentine he's answering this for the what for the elect amen now as an elect approaches an answer must be given to amen they want to know that's the reason i want to answer it just as with much sense to it as i can give it to you brother branham now answers no he continued reading the the question has been married and divorced and then remarried a woman who has also been married and divorced and then married to him and they and these two married in god's side are they married in god's side how can both of both or one of them be in the rapture i'm going to explain you this the man was married a man divorced the woman was married divorced they already troubled both of them then they met together and they're married the curse is easy because you can break this marriage and everybody goes free but in their cases they already have children you gets more complicated if you separate this marriage where are the kids gonna go because the kids the woman is under adultery married two men again living under adultery their kids and the adultery if you split this to say go back go back what about the children they are born under adultery how can we rescue such a situation that's why you need a proper head amen brother brandon help us how now brother branham mentioned i don't know this is the message of the head i don't know i could not tell you the question is can they be in the water why are they asking that because they look they find that based on the scripture there is no way we can be in the rapture because we already messed up we messed up and we messed up again divorce each one of them divorced each one of them has a living companion then they're married again both of them married again now is that woman still alive yes is the man still alive yes oh my god if they were dead no problem so you you're free they're still alive and sometimes they take longer before they die hallelujah brother branham say a crow lives longer he lives longer you wear that you say lord let him die so so so i can marry they don't die that's why young people before you get married make sure you pray are you there the woman has a living husband the man a living one and now they got children and so forth and want to come to water when they look at their situation it's like the devil is telling me them don't even fool to go to church you better stay at home because you will never go to heaven but something in them like the sorrow phoenician woman that tag is is kind of pulling amen can they go in the rapture that shall be up to the heavenly father i could not answer that see i saw one thing look how the prophet cornered them i saw one thing the bible say that they shall be called enough brother branham is condemning them as a messenger amen he's not going to condone or compromise amen jesus never said that the woman was not caught in adultery he never said that because the evidence is there and the word always will correct the error so brother branham must acknowledge that first of all they are due [Music] are you there this message if you don't understand that just pray accept it and move forward it is not complicated amen the bible says that they shall be called an adulterer and the bible said also an adulterer will work not enter in the kingdom of in other words the man that put the question say oh my god that's exactly what i was thinking the man that we thought is gonna tell us something he's cornering us amen that is all that i can say about here remember the sorrow venetian woman when she approached jesus jesus called her first as a dog but she have to accept have to accept the category god put her under if god said you are a dog don't call yourself something and say yes master i accept the dog do you understand so brother branham is telling them that you are doomed according to the scripture there is no way you can get to heaven yes lord accepted amen that's all i can say i know that just kills me i'm preaching marriage and divorce almost if you take these three three sermons and the one following you will see all marriage and divorce preaching amen that just kills me to say that but i can't say but what the water i must stay with water i cannot compromise i must tell you the truth that you are doomed that's the first phase watch william marion branham pulling the emergency bullet now you want to read it you want to see that you want to see the emergency bullet watch that he continued i'm not advising you please let me just give you a little scripture i thought he condemned them please please don't if you are living happy with your this is 64. he have not preached marriage and divorce here but somebody is pushing amen if you are happy with your husband living happy with your wife please remain what which authority are you using brother brother with you just for because i told you that don't leave them leader the complexity is the children when brother brother gave the scripture it looks like both of them need to separate them but the kids are locked where are they going to go they're trying to live godly amen brother branham now he's saying no no no no stay there because of the kids which scripture do you have brother brother amen don't leave them lead the children without a home and things like that god has made the restitutions in places for people that did things water you remember jesus said emergency bullet of david when he was what you see the scripture how it's used now you see now when david when he was hungry he enter into the temple of god and eat the shoe bread which is only lawful for the priest and found work the priest also blasphemed the sabbath upon the sabbath day and i found water and a greater than the sabbath was there let's just leave it up to god and go ahead and just leave that way just leave for water there might be a chance of you getting water you see that that's why when he preached marriage and divorce he said he forgave you like they give moses a permission they give paulie permission they also give me a permission only thing teach your children not to do that again but that's for you that's because you are an elective you gotta be rescued there might be a chance of you getting in dog two wrongs will never righten you just go on and live the way you are if you are happy together you might have the wrong companion if i i shall say this one thing if you got the wrong companion in this wife in this life you shall never have it in the other all wrong will be water it's a tough situation hang on with the husband when we go to the rapture you're gonna understand who you are supposed to marry are you there are you there we saw on sunday david and the three choices when god told him to to to choose one of them david never chose any he said let me fall in the hand of god now let's go with david and nathan and look at what's going on in second samuel chapter 11 verse 2 we good and it came to pass in the evening todd we know this that david rose from office bed and walked up on the roof of the king's house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself by shiva and the woman was very beautiful to look on when the scripture said beautiful they always say look on look on look on look on look on and you're gonna see why jezebel painted her face amen and david sent an inquirer after the woman and once said it is this is not this bathsheba in other words they warn him just like the other time when he won a number he's a job warning he seems like david have a problem with hard-headed amen the daughter of helium the wife of uriah at the high time and david sent messenger and took her and she came in unto him and he lay with her and she was purified from her uncleanness and she returned onto her house everybody so far second samuel chapter 12 nathan came the woman got pregnant nathan came and give a parable he says there was a rich man you know the parable and the poor man and this is what happened and david anger kindled he didn't know what he was watch what's going on amen and david's anger was greatly kinder against the water who was the man okay and he said to nathan as the lord of the lord the man who is the man that has done these things that surely what who was david the king of israel the head of israel he consented for his own death the first penalty of this man is death anybody clear verse six and he shall restore the water the lamb how many times if he killed one he he he's gonna have four of his family killed we understand okay where was daddy he shall restore the lamb thoughtful because he did things and because he had no pity and david verse 13 nathan turned around he said you know the man it is you and david verse 13 and david said unto nathan i have sinned against the law and nathan say unto david the lord also has put away that that shall not work god erased the first one he left this the son that was born from that adultery died emon died absalom died i don't know four amen david was supposed also to die message of grace david said the man will pay for his life that dog prophet the head of the agent that's all prophet them eyes narrow down brother branham now is looking at the scene and he says when david was so angry the prophet luke and david said he doesn't understand what he's doing he's condemning himself and because the prophet was the prophet of the age nathan the prophet reached out to his bed and pulled the emergency bullet quickly for david them eyes narrowed down he said devin surely you shall not die watch what quick the spirit struck the prophet self-device life when david pronounced judgment an anointing came and told me quickly save death itself does it quickly and let them use the bullet and say oh you're not going to die watch dress go out to work work with the spirit struck the prophet save david's life grace surely you shall not die but the sword will not leave your house till it's totally purged your heart for you are the rich man oh it was a different then wasn't it what saved david when his own judgment say the man will die he shall pay to the other most and he shall pay for it with his life then and the prophets say surely what you shall not you shall not die david grace has saved you he was graced to death that saved him oh my if he had not been for grace where would we all be it's certainly right it's that right certainly when david already pronounced himself dead grace stepping and watch you dabbing from there amen it's a grace under the head only nathan have that bullet because he's the messenger to the age let's look at the lever and the passover are you there still a few minutes and then ii chronicle chapter 30 verse 17 and there were many in the congregation that were not israel they were trying to put things in order in the book of the chronicle they must eat the passover when they want to eat the passover many people were still unclaimed they were not sanctified what are we going to do because israel is trying to correct its way into uh toward god and there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified therefore the levite had the charge of the killing of the passover for everyone that was not clean to sanctify them unto the lord so the leaver took charge to make sure the people are clean for a multitude of the people even many of ephraim and manasseh issachar and zebulun had not cleaned themselves yet you follow me did they eat the water otherwise then it was written normally they were not supposed to take the lord's supper you follow me but they look at the circumstances and they take time that was there they say allow the people to go ahead and get it yes brother kevin look at this grace yet the day is the passover otherwise then it was written but hezekiah who was hezekiah the head prayed for them saying the good luck do what remember when a woman take a power under her father her father have a right to disallow the vow and god will do what pardon when a husband a wife taken foul the husband has a right to cancel that and the god will do what hezekiah use that partner because they don't know what to do they're in the tax situation the people are in the city consensus where they are they must honor the passover he said lord forgive them their heart they try to make things right but the situation is tight just come on up lord pound on everyone that prepare his work the condition is here you got a minute from your heart amen in other words the mistake you find yourself in is by ignorance the mistake you found yourself in is something that you were under pressure like the man he could not stand before the bullet brother branham said that's why he run the mistake is under pressure you don't mean it's not iniquity to prepare prepare his heart to seek god the lord god of his father though he be not what according to the purification of the sanctuary and the lord did what to whom and did what they took the passover without being totally clean because they had to use an emergency bullet say god you know their heart they're just trying the best that they can they're struggling but please help them god say i understand there's a kaya let them take it hallelujah jesus said the adulterous woman we already explained this jesus said the fifth of the cross the fifth of the cross was there you know the story the other fifth was mocking jesus he looked he said wait a minute you cannot mock this man me and you we are guilty we did things that were wrong but not this man but just what he said he turned around he said lord do whatever can i have a crumb of mercy father i'm already doomed in few minutes i'm gonna die because the roman will come pack experience to me break my legs i will die but please before i go would you please have a club maybe a small grace maybe that small bullet and when jesus was dying he was dying as a sinner and the peanut of fire already left him that's why he was crying my father my father well why have that forsaken me even in that stage jesus kept a bullet in his pocket amen when he was at the last time he looked he said wait a minute this is a predestinated seat he said no wonder i kept a bullet he pulled the bullet he said today me and you we're going into water normally normally a man that was safe in that time should be baptized because john the baptist already introduced baptism but at the cross it's an emergency case there is no way to get involved baptized so right where you are just take follow me get it this way don't open and open the door upgrade amen [Applause] hallelujah recognizing the head jesus christ by recognizing the head even in that agony there was still a bullet to save somebody and bypass the world of baptism and get him to heaven hallelujah because there was no time brother branham said to get that man prepared again and go to the water baptism that time was he's he's in the death in the hospital he gotta die we cannot take him from the from the icu and put him in the water right there going to heaven hallelujah paul and othnesimos let's go to pharlemon then we're going to finish i have seven minutes left according to my time amen let's go to phalemon taliman if you go to second team until you finish you're going to go to tardis after tardis falling on just to help somebody get it quickly amen you there if you don't know where it is go to second timothy if you found timothy first second after second timothy status after titus it's parliament that's why you need to train yourself in a scripture amen funny moment everybody there verse uh there is only one verse there one chapter there let's go to verse 10. as a background phallemon had a slave that slave was called on azimus and that slave ran away from his master and probably he he stole something or what and run away then when he ran away he went away from his master in rome or something he met paul and paul preached the gospel and the man got converted now in in the way of correcting his life paul told him go back to your master just like hagar disrespecting sarah the angel of the lord said go back stay home and respect sarah amen so paul said go ahead and go back over there but the master is probably angry because you stole something and you ran away so paul now as the messenger is pulling a bullet to help on the zimmers go back to his normal estate clear now verse 10 i beseech you he's talking to falima who was the owner i beseech you for my [Music] was on a zemo's son to paul he was son in the gospel now paul uses my son he's loading his bullet pretty good he said philemon i'm sending somebody but that person is my son i beseech you for my son onesimus whom i have begotten in my water in other words i got him to the lord and he's born again while i'm in prison he's my son in the gospel which in time passed was to you whatever he was not useful to you anymore you already doomed with he i mean him to your presence he's doomed if he alimon probably found him he can kill him doom who in time passed was to you i'm profitable but now profitable to who to you and who he associated him remember moses when israel got in trouble moses said to the lord before you killed if you don't forgive them kill me take my name out of the book of life he knew his name was in the book of life god won't take it take my name out and then god repented so paul is saying if i send on the symbols it's going to be tough for him let me use my signet let me use the ring of the king and let me put that connect that to honesty must so when he sees that ring is telling him something amen which in time passed was to you unprofitable but now profitable to you and me whom i have sent again you therefore do what receive him that is my own water whom i would have returned with me that in your stead he might have ministered to me in the bonds of the gospel normally he's a good boy now i should have kept him with me so that we can preach the gospel with him but i am sending him back to you he's youthful in other words amen but verse 14 without your mind will not not do nothing i cannot do something like this without telling anybody amen that your benefit should not be as aware of necessity but water i don't want you to do this as a duty i want i'm i'm calling to your heart for you to understand i want this to come from your own heart or the pharma amen for perhaps he therefore departed for a water that you should receive him for what paul is telling philemon this prisoner could have depart from you forever so god allowed him to go like that because god wanted him to serve you for the whole life but god sent in on azimus a wrong spirit so for god to preserve your worker he allowed him to go so that me paul can handle him clean him up for you prepare him correctly and bring him to you so that at this point he's going to remain faithful to you all the way to death sometimes some have to go and get prepared and come back radically hallelujah for perhaps he therefore departed for a season that you should receive him forever not now as a worker but above a servant a brother beloved especially to me look how he's bringing a orders but how much more to you buff in flesh and in the water now he's not just your servant he believes the same god like you so in a different way he's also your brother so you can sit down and fellowship with him the things that you were not supposed to fellowship with him before amen if you can't meet there for a while look how moses is inserting himself if you can't meet there for a partner receive him as what i'm pulling now paul is now putting himself out like philemon go ahead and refuse me you know what i did for you right you know how i save you you know how i preach you the gospel you know how i handle you so treat me bad if you can amen if you can't meet there for a partner receive him as myself if he had done what wrong you or all you water anything put that on my water this is the spirit of christ the door of all the symbols to the house of philemon was closed but paul under the anointing of christ is approaching saying if there is anything they did father lay those charge on me i died there the cross for them i took their penalty put that on me go ahead and kill me strip me at the cross put me naked over there in the cross but at least let this one pass amen if he has wronged you i owe you anything put that on my account i paul have written it with my own work the signet of mordecai i put myself i want to see how you're going to refuse this amen i'm writing this with my own hand i will do what do you think philemon had the gut to tell paul go ahead and pay me my money back do you think so paul will tell him that if i preach you the gospel your your belonging you ought to share with me so you actually owe me because i'm working as a tent maker i don't want to get that amen apple have written it with my own hand i won't repay it i'll beat i do not say to you how you owe me what what for how you owe me even your own normally you will you you belong to me i didn't claim you that now for what you owe me remember put that on there in other words let's cancel the card let's cancel that i cancel yours you cancel the one i send you right so zero zero get him amen brother let me have joy of you in the water refresh my power in the lord having confidence in your work remember the man that was approaching abraham lincoln he said i know you don't want to condone the death of a man amen paul say i know your obedience in other words you're going to do what i'm telling you to do amen having confidence in your opinion i wrote to you knowing that you will also do more than what watch verse 22 how he kills him but meanwhile prepared me also a water mother factor i will come to visit you to make sure you treat him pretty good what do you think honestly will do what do you think amen brother branham one time was with sister media amen and media under pressure joseph did something media was chasing joseph coming up there really slap it slap him what about he said what is going on with me that got upset slap the door the angel of god said i didn't like that go tell sister meda i didn't like him but the boss was there when you were doing that when you fasted me each day

perfect will of god that's a permissive [Music] heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace father for your love and for your mercy father thank you for this emergency grace because many times we have made a mistake ignorantly sometimes we know but we are pushing a hard corner where we don't know what to do and we have to react underneath under many difficulties where we have to come out from a certain situation but god you have opened up this world you have opened up this revelation that there is always a grace for the people that are following you that are following god father god from other ways for this day that are under this ministry of malachi 4 where you send your prophet lord father lord jesus christ and you open up against the windows of heaven and make you touch every product may [Music] there is power in our position there is grace in our position there is blessing in our opposition lord like abraham he was one man he would fight first lord and father overcame them but every time he left his position he was afraid of one king by the lord jesus christ they will cherish our position if we are a woman let's stay in our position as a woman if we are by man let's stand on our position as a man if we as daughter or a son let's stand on our position if we are different let's stand on our position if we are trusting a treasurer a pastor let everybody stand in their position wrong cherish [Music] this world cannot be only worthy but make them find it very good in our heart that our sister will surrender to the word of god to the headship of the world and understand that they are not like the women [Music] [Applause] [Music] i rebuke every demonic dominating female spiritual creatures father free your children free lord father every demonic spirit that took the man out of their place when you put them back to their place current democracy welcome to trouble father bring us closer to you lord for the glory of your honor there is no way you can bring a message such as like this without providing a proper great story to help us lord father live that which was focused on father made that grace regretted to each one of us that we might live by the lord jesus christ and manifest you according god father to the purpose of your own will lord we ever ask you that commit them unto the hand that you protect them and you give them trouble mercy lord as they go into their respective place father continue to minister to them lord father fight for them lord father step between them and the work of the devil finally fight for them in the battle of the man lord where the devil of the devil will try to buffet them we commit them unto the hand lord and ask it in the name of jesus christ in the name of jesus christ amen bless you church we love you [Music] amen [Music] you can keep playing that and keep playing them and sisters that's not that's not to say that you don't have a part you know god placed you there in the family to be the backbone and i don't know i haven't dealt with screaming kids yet but i know if the lord tarries i will and i know i'm not going to be able to handle that well but i know my wife will because that's what she was built for so when she's in her place and i'm in my place and that'll put the kids in place and everything will be in god's perfect will and plan but when the woman comes out of her place and the man comes out of this place it's just it's a mess so it's not that the woman doesn't have a place if she's not the head she still has to be the backbone of the family just a matter of being in your place and allowing god to use you god's grace [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Laughter] [Music] one more time [Music] [Music] [Music] your dismiss this evening may god be with you that is
