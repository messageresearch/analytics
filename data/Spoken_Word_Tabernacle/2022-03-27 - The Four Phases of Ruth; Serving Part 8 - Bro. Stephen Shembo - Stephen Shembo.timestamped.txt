[58:13] members so our family members god richly
[58:16] bless you amen
[58:19] joshua chapter 2
[58:23] verse 9.
[58:26] you know the story right
[58:28] very familiar it's a rahab
[58:34] and she said to the man to the spies
[58:38] the spies came into jericho
[58:41] and for some reason
[58:43] this young woman
[58:44] have taken a risk
[58:48] she took the spies and hide them
[58:52] and the king already knew and they even
[58:55] sent soldier to her home
[58:57] so she taken a risk
[59:00] why is she taking this risk
[59:03] why
[59:04] amen
[59:06] and she said to the man
[59:09] i know
[59:11] that the lord
[59:13] has given you this land the land
[59:18] how does she know
[59:22] how
[59:24] how does she know
[59:30] jump to verse 14 and then we're going to
[59:31] come back
[59:33] and the man answer here our life for
[59:36] yours if you either not this our
[59:38] business and it shall be when the lord
[59:40] has given us the land
[59:45] despise the lord
[59:46] it shall be it's like something in the
[59:48] future
[59:50] but for rahab
[59:52] she knows that it's a done deal
[59:58] she knows that husband is already there
[1:00:02] you might be seated
[1:00:04] i'm gonna drive that in you
[1:00:07] [Music]
[1:00:13] you want to stay single
[1:00:15] and go under depression
[1:00:17] and i have to stay all night praying
[1:00:20] no you're going to get married
[1:00:22] [Applause]
[1:00:24] [Laughter]
[1:00:30] that's exactly what it is
[1:00:33] amen
[1:00:34] gonna stay there i'm okay i'm okay at
[1:00:36] the night you crying
[1:00:42] and when the husband come oh i was
[1:00:44] saying lord i don't want to go in heaven
[1:00:46] like this
[1:00:51] oh my god let's go to verse 9.
[1:00:55] oh my and she said to the man
[1:00:58] i know
[1:00:59] that the lord has given you the land
[1:01:02] how do you know
[1:01:04] who told you
[1:01:06] so somebody have faith
[1:01:11] don't worry you're going to say amen
[1:01:13] down the road
[1:01:14] so rahab
[1:01:18] had faith
[1:01:22] she had the substance
[1:01:24] that the deal was already done
[1:01:27] amen
[1:01:29] come on and that your terror is falling
[1:01:33] upon us
[1:01:36] and that all the inhabitants of the land
[1:01:39] fent because of you
[1:01:42] in other way these are yeah you don't
[1:01:44] know who you are
[1:01:46] we are already down here
[1:01:49] amen
[1:01:50] and israel probably is preparing for the
[1:01:52] battle lord jesus when i go to the
[1:01:55] battle of jericho i don't want to die
[1:02:01] amen
[1:02:02] verse 10
[1:02:04] for we so not only rehab
[1:02:08] but the entire city of jericho
[1:02:11] we
[1:02:12] have heard
[1:02:13] how the lord dried up the water of the
[1:02:17] red sea
[1:02:19] so the news was not only given to rehab
[1:02:22] alone
[1:02:23] everybody heard the news
[1:02:27] but how did they respond to the news
[1:02:30] they heard
[1:02:31] is what determines what kind the seed is
[1:02:36] laying in you
[1:02:39] you can all hear the message in this
[1:02:42] church
[1:02:43] you can all hear about the covenants and
[1:02:46] the armenian and everything
[1:02:48] but the way you react to the sermon
[1:02:53] amen
[1:02:54] is only telling me the seed that you
[1:02:57] have inside
[1:02:59] somebody can hear the message
[1:03:01] intellectually
[1:03:02] and despite how many times we can preach
[1:03:05] about something they still don't want to
[1:03:07] change
[1:03:08] anybody here but the same
[1:03:11] in the same church someone else is there
[1:03:14] when they hear the message
[1:03:16] that message is doing something unto
[1:03:19] them
[1:03:20] anybody care
[1:03:22] she said we everybody i'm not the only
[1:03:24] one everybody here right anybody care
[1:03:28] for we have heard how the lord dried up
[1:03:32] the water of the red sea for you in
[1:03:35] other words we heard how you cross the
[1:03:38] red sea
[1:03:40] and
[1:03:41] the red sea
[1:03:42] i will get to this down the road
[1:03:45] the red sea
[1:03:47] brother branham speaks
[1:03:50] and explained that it was water baptism
[1:03:57] because israel was baptized in the red
[1:04:00] scene
[1:04:03] paul said that
[1:04:05] do you know that paul said that
[1:04:08] somebody is looking at me like this
[1:04:10] keep your finger right there
[1:04:12] let's go to
[1:04:15] first corinthians chapter 10. i don't
[1:04:17] want you to say brother steven say
[1:04:24] if you begin to read the bible daily
[1:04:27] in a in a diligent way your life will be
[1:04:30] easy
[1:04:34] because my way i have to grant you in
[1:04:36] the scripture and in the message of the
[1:04:39] hour so if you listen to the message and
[1:04:41] you read your bible you're making
[1:04:43] yourself
[1:04:46] an easy work
[1:04:48] are you there
[1:04:49] let's go to verse 10.
[1:04:51] chapter 10 verse 1.
[1:04:52] i was not intended probably to read this
[1:04:54] but we would deal with this down the
[1:04:56] road moreover brethren i would not that
[1:04:59] you should be ignorant
[1:05:01] because if i don't show you this
[1:05:02] somebody will get stuck into that and
[1:05:04] forget the whole sermon
[1:05:07] yeah and the devil will keep you there
[1:05:08] wait wait wait wait where and you think
[1:05:10] you and and you're missing everything
[1:05:12] else
[1:05:13] how that all our father were under the
[1:05:16] cloud everybody seen that
[1:05:18] and all passed through the water
[1:05:21] everybody seen that
[1:05:22] and we're all water
[1:05:25] to what
[1:05:27] moses in the cloud and in the water
[1:05:30] let's go back now to our joshua
[1:05:33] any question
[1:05:34] anymore so what a baptism
[1:05:38] the red sea speaks of what
[1:05:41] this is coming from
[1:05:42] rahab
[1:05:44] amen
[1:05:46] we have heard how that the lord joined
[1:05:48] up the water
[1:05:50] the water
[1:05:51] the water baptism of the red sea for you
[1:05:56] come on
[1:05:57] when you came out of egypt
[1:06:00] she also speaking about the coming out
[1:06:05] the coming out
[1:06:07] of the exodus
[1:06:10] and this coming out was under the
[1:06:13] sacrificial number
[1:06:18] everybody okay
[1:06:19] which was the brazen altar
[1:06:25] now you can read the bible differently
[1:06:27] now
[1:06:30] i was telling somebody
[1:06:32] this morning i say
[1:06:34] when we preach the way we preach
[1:06:38] you should not start with your old
[1:06:40] thinking
[1:06:42] hey mark here the material you're
[1:06:44] getting
[1:06:46] is the tool that now you can begin to
[1:06:49] use for your entire life
[1:06:53] you can read your life and work
[1:06:55] differently
[1:06:56] you can read people at walmart
[1:06:58] differently but just with the tool that
[1:07:00] you have

[1:07:15] that
[1:07:16] there is math going on quickly
[1:07:19] but you don't know you're using math
[1:07:22] because you learn math now you know how
[1:07:24] to use it and it becomes a life
[1:07:29] hallelujah
[1:07:31] when you came out of egypt everybody
[1:07:35] and what you did
[1:07:37] to the two kings of the amorite
[1:07:40] that were on the other side of water
[1:07:43] this is before they cross jordan
[1:07:48] hey mark here this is before they cross

[1:07:54] which is death remember elisha and
[1:07:57] elijah have to cross jordan
[1:07:59] and enter to the promised land to
[1:08:01] receive the spirit
[1:08:03] before they cross jordan there is a
[1:08:06] killing that happened
[1:08:12] am i reading a different bible there is
[1:08:14] a killing of certain kings

[1:08:21] certain
[1:08:22] kings

[1:09:00] quick
[1:09:04] the language of the tabernacle
[1:09:08] at the opening of the seventh seal
[1:09:11] the bible become anew
[1:09:15] that's why you miss a sermon you put
[1:09:17] yourself in trouble

[1:10:14] did melt neither did there remain any
[1:10:18] more courage in any man because of you
[1:10:23] so rahab is talking to the two spies
[1:10:28] remember paul and silas have to go into
[1:10:31] the prison

[1:11:33] was an expression
[1:11:37] of
[1:11:38] her faith
[1:11:40] anybody care
[1:11:41] that's why brother branham preacher
[1:11:43] message works his water
[1:11:46] works equal
[1:11:49] faith express
[1:11:52] everybody here
[1:11:53] in other words the definition of work is
[1:11:56] the expression of faith
[1:12:00] the life that you leave
[1:12:05] the deed that you do the work that you
[1:12:09] do
[1:12:10] the action that you do in your life or
[1:12:13] on social media
[1:12:16] is only an expression of your faith
[1:12:20] what you put up on social media is
[1:12:24] showing us the letter of your faith
[1:12:28] what you're putting up on facebook
[1:12:31] on instagram on whatsapp it's showing us
[1:12:35] where you are in your faith
[1:12:41] you don't do it by any chance
[1:12:44] there is a spirit driving you to put up
[1:12:47] something on whatsapp
[1:12:49] you cannot believe
[1:12:51] that a woman should not wear paint
[1:12:54] but on your whatsapp you are posting
[1:12:57] women wearing paints
[1:13:00] you bringing a confusion a mixed message

[1:24:18] the bible
[1:24:23] hallelujah
[1:24:24] oh my god
[1:24:26] and deliver our life from water
[1:24:30] death
[1:24:31] i don't want to die

[1:24:38] our life
[1:24:40] for yours
[1:24:42] what
[1:24:42] enough if you order not this our

[1:25:14] what pressure did rahab have
[1:25:17] that this man have to swear
[1:25:19] anybody care

[1:25:22] when we come into the land
[1:25:25] you shall burn this line of water
[1:25:30] though your sin be red asda
[1:25:34] you remember the tabernacle
[1:25:37] the scarlet
[1:25:38] color because red through red is what
[1:25:42] their house of rahab was already read by
[1:25:46] sin
[1:25:47] it was a house of prostitution
[1:25:50] so they have to put red outside
[1:25:52] so when joshua is coming when he's
[1:25:55] looking at the red skullet
[1:25:58] through the red
[1:25:59] everybody in that house is white
[1:26:04] when their death angel is coming on
[1:26:07] jericho

[1:26:32] and yo
[1:26:33] and all your father has hold home to you
[1:26:39] everybody okay
[1:26:41] and it shall be that whosoever shall go
[1:26:44] out of the door of yours
[1:26:48] i thought he was a house of prostitution
[1:26:53] ever here
[1:26:54] out of your house into the street
[1:26:57] everybody clear
[1:26:59] his blood
[1:27:00] shall be upon his head
[1:27:03] and we will be guiltless of whosoever
[1:27:06] shall be with you in the house
[1:27:09] his blood shall be on our head if any
[1:27:13] hand be upon him
[1:27:15] eternally
[1:27:22] justification
[1:27:24] sanctification
[1:27:26] baptism of the holy spirit
[1:27:28] all three in rahab let's go to hebrew
[1:27:31] 11.
[1:27:35] we already preached the message
[1:27:37] the whole sermon is already preached
[1:27:42] amen
[1:27:44] hallelujah exodus chapter uh hebrew
[1:27:48] chapter 11
[1:27:52] verse 31
[1:27:55] i told you that rahab has faith right
[1:27:58] so if you were doubting in your heart
[1:28:01] i'm going to help you up
[1:28:04] okay
[1:28:05] if you have a question
[1:28:06] anybody care
[1:28:08] remember no sleeping
[1:28:11] your time of grace is gone the deacon
[1:28:14] pulled the sword
[1:28:17] anybody care
[1:28:18] sorry
[1:28:19] if you feel like you're going to do it
[1:28:21] you sit on the back so they can punch
[1:28:22] you quickly on the back and nobody will
[1:28:24] see
[1:28:25] that's the correct way to do it but if
[1:28:27] you sit on the front that's your problem
[1:28:29] don't say they embarrass me you sit on
[1:28:32] the back anybody here
[1:28:34] hebrew chapter 11.
[1:28:36] that's your pastor verse 31
[1:28:39] you there
[1:28:40] buy water by faith the who
[1:28:45] the whole lord will have perished not by
[1:28:49] water
[1:28:50] faith so rehab again edible
[1:28:53] head water
[1:28:55] any question
[1:28:57] by faith
[1:28:59] rahab the harlot
[1:29:01] perish not with them that believe not
[1:29:06] so those people heard
[1:29:08] everybody here but they did not believe
[1:29:12] so the only one that believed was rehab
[1:29:17] so rahab had faith
[1:29:20] is he clear now
[1:29:22] that belief not so if somebody did not
[1:29:24] believe someone else did believe and the
[1:29:27] one who believed was rahab kama when she
[1:29:30] received the spies with water
[1:29:36] where did that peace came from
[1:29:38] when we are justified then we make
[1:29:44] everybody okay
[1:29:45] so rahab was justified
[1:29:54] brother stephen this is a deduction
[1:29:58] is it a deduction
[1:30:00] let's go to james chapter 2.
[1:30:07] anybody care
[1:30:09] james chapter 2
[1:30:11] verse 22. if you're there you can say
[1:30:13] amen remember last time
[1:30:17] see you have
[1:30:18] faith paul
[1:30:21] says she's justified by what
[1:30:23] faith
[1:30:25] see you have faith wrote or working
[1:30:29] with his work james's
[1:30:31] phd in work and by work
[1:30:35] was faith made water
[1:30:37] remember last sunday
[1:30:39] and the scripture was fulfilled which
[1:30:41] say
[1:30:42] abraham believed god you know the
[1:30:45] calvinist
[1:30:46] and he was imputed to him for
[1:30:49] righteousness and he was called the
[1:30:51] friend of god
[1:30:52] anybody here
[1:30:54] you see then how that by works
[1:30:57] a man is water
[1:30:59] justified and not by faith only
[1:31:03] they both said missed
[1:31:07] anybody care
[1:31:08] likewise also was not who
[1:31:13] am i reading a different bible rail have
[1:31:16] the water
[1:31:18] the whole lot do what
[1:31:23] everybody okay so rahab was
[1:31:26] water yes
[1:31:30] she was justified that's why she could
[1:31:33] speak about the water
[1:31:35] that's why she could speak about the
[1:31:37] sacrificial lamb and her work was
[1:31:40] showing that she's already in the holy
[1:31:42] place
[1:31:43] because now she's acting
[1:31:46] against her own
[1:31:48] will
[1:31:49] against her own country
[1:31:52] against her own nature
[1:31:56] anybody care she's doing things that
[1:31:58] normally she should not have done
[1:32:01] but something is driving her anybody
[1:32:03] care
[1:32:04] rehab the whole lot
[1:32:06] justified by works
[1:32:09] we okay now she was already justified
[1:32:13] when she had received the messenger
[1:32:16] i thought they were spies
[1:32:18] now they were
[1:32:20] you see now
[1:32:22] i thought they were spies
[1:32:24] you called them spies in the old
[1:32:25] testament
[1:32:26] but they were
[1:32:28] they were angels
[1:32:32] you thought they are sending spies no
[1:32:35] they were sending
[1:32:37] it was joshua the holy ghost that i was
[1:32:39] sending
[1:32:44] everybody here messenger and then send
[1:32:47] them out another
[1:32:49] another way everybody care
[1:32:52] for us the body without the spirit is
[1:32:55] dead so faith without work is water
[1:32:59] let's go to ruth chapter 2 and then we
[1:33:01] pray
[1:33:06] alleluia
[1:33:10] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:33:13] you go to roof chapter 2 and you pulse
[1:33:16] there rehab had faith
[1:33:19] according to hebrew she was justified
[1:33:22] according to james
[1:33:24] but
[1:33:25] despite her other court and the holy
[1:33:28] place she was still in jericho it took
[1:33:31] the token
[1:33:33] ever here to take her completely out of
[1:33:36] jericho and wipe all her past so the
[1:33:40] token took her up
[1:33:42] and burned jericho destroy and burn the
[1:33:45] snake completely removed the snake her
[1:33:48] deed was nothing but the expression of
[1:33:51] her faith because works is fresh his
[1:33:54] faith expressed everything now let's
[1:33:57] pray heavenly father lord we are
[1:33:59] approaching you humbly again father this
[1:34:02] morning thanking you for your grace
[1:34:04] for your love your mercy father and for
[1:34:06] everything you have been doing for us
[1:34:09] lord we have done
[1:34:10] what any man that you given the ability
[1:34:13] to do can do
[1:34:14] father but when it comes to feeding your
[1:34:17] children interpreting and ministering
[1:34:20] and giving a revelation you only take a
[1:34:23] supernatural action of the holy spirit
[1:34:26] lord may you move me completely out of
[1:34:28] the way may you come and speak to your
[1:34:30] children and bless them be the alpha and
[1:34:33] the omega of this service we seal the
[1:34:35] devil completely out and paralyze every
[1:34:38] demonic forces of the work of darkness
[1:34:41] father completely away from this place
[1:34:44] in the name of jesus christ
[1:34:46] amen
[1:34:48] last sunday we stopped
[1:34:50] at the marriage in the other court you
[1:34:53] remember that
[1:34:54] and brother branham say as long because
[1:34:57] the father of the young men say that he
[1:35:00] was he repented he was baptized but he
[1:35:03] behaved you the bad behavior from the
[1:35:06] family was still there
[1:35:08] why because the snake is still there
[1:35:10] remember when you baptize when you are
[1:35:12] repented on the justification the snake
[1:35:15] the bad habit is still there anybody
[1:35:17] clear so that's why brother branham said
[1:35:20] as long as that boy
[1:35:22] did not receive the holy ghost
[1:35:24] do not let him marry because he's going
[1:35:27] to be hell to somebody else
[1:35:29] some of you did not know this kind of
[1:35:31] stuff and some jump into marriage
[1:35:34] that's why you struggle a lot
[1:35:36] but now where you are stand up stop what
[1:35:39] you are doing and move forward into the

[1:37:05] something very painful
[1:37:10] anybody okay
[1:37:11] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:37:14] that shall make a candlestick of pure
[1:37:17] gold
[1:37:18] of beaten work

[1:37:55] everybody okay
[1:37:57] so the quote i wanted to give you last
[1:37:59] sunday
[1:38:00] was that brother branham same question
[1:38:02] and answer
[1:38:04] what had happened to that woman
[1:38:07] he said the same thing would have
[1:38:10] she had kept messing around
[1:38:13] without receiving the holy ghost
[1:38:16] playing in church
[1:38:18] 20 years in the message 15 years in the
[1:38:20] message born in a message sending a
[1:38:22] message all this kind of stuff
[1:38:25] just like that woman over yonder today
[1:38:28] that called me and wanted to marry the
[1:38:31] man
[1:38:32] and leave her own husband and marry the
[1:38:34] man
[1:38:36] she had come in such a place
[1:38:39] maybe one time being in contact with god
[1:38:42] but had been lasting after the things of
[1:38:45] the world
[1:38:47] never progresses and i ask her and say
[1:38:50] have you received the holy ghost
[1:38:53] she said
[1:38:54] not yet but i am water
[1:38:57] i am seeking it i said you get the holy
[1:39:01] ghost first
[1:39:05] and he the holy ghost
[1:39:07] will tell you what husband to have
[1:39:13] anybody here
[1:39:15] the choices that you make in life
[1:39:19] and back here
[1:39:20] is only a diagnosis of what you have on
[1:39:24] your inside
[1:39:26] because a man filled with the holy
[1:39:29] spirit or a woman filled with the holy
[1:39:31] spirit make choices differently
[1:39:35] and certain choices that you make when
[1:39:38] you buy your chosen
[1:39:40] when you buy your dresses
[1:39:43] when you buy your stuff are only
[1:39:46] expressing the level of your spiritual
[1:39:49] life
[1:39:50] anybody care
[1:39:52] so this morning we are talking about the
[1:39:55] four faces of roof
[1:39:57] you there on the camera
[1:39:59] yes sir the four faces of roof
[1:40:02] roof
[1:40:03] serving
[1:40:04] we talk about roof grace roof tabernacle
[1:40:08] roof justification roof under looter
[1:40:11] roof at the water baptist roof air the
[1:40:13] brazen altar now you understand all of
[1:40:15] that now we're on roof
[1:40:17] serving
[1:40:19] when we spoke about the tabernacle
[1:40:22] brother branham says this is just a
[1:40:23] reminder that in the old testament
[1:40:27] being a top of the new the works of the
[1:40:30] inward courts three courts
[1:40:32] of the tabernacle was a beautiful
[1:40:35] picture of god's plan of salvation for
[1:40:38] his man kind
[1:40:41] then when we started we found out that
[1:40:44] ruth has four faces
[1:40:46] brother branham say that from four
[1:40:49] different phases of roof
[1:40:51] i gather wrote here
[1:40:53] roof deciding
[1:40:55] making her decision we went through that
[1:40:57] roof serving
[1:40:59] roof resting
[1:41:00] roof rewarded
[1:41:02] roof making the decision
[1:41:05] roof after she made her decision in
[1:41:07] other words she completed the first step
[1:41:10] she plateau on the first step
[1:41:14] then roof is now serving
[1:41:16] then roof when she plateau on serving
[1:41:20] roof then is resting and when she
[1:41:23] plateau on resting then roof is what
[1:41:27] rewarded everybody here so far
[1:41:30] now when we go back in our tabernacle
[1:41:34] if you come and you look at this you'll
[1:41:36] be completely lost
[1:41:38] that's why you need to keep up with the
[1:41:39] sermon ever here
[1:41:42] now we found out that when roof came
[1:41:44] she entered by the gate
[1:41:47] you know what that gates mean
[1:41:49] and then through the gate she went
[1:41:51] through the present altar
[1:41:53] everybody remember
[1:41:55] and from the brazen altar she move on to
[1:41:58] the water baptism into the level
[1:42:01] everybody okay so far
[1:42:03] then we put roof under justification
[1:42:07] everybody okay
[1:42:09] you okay put your seatbelt i'm just
[1:42:11] maneuvering in the airport everybody
[1:42:15] roof deciding or roof under
[1:42:17] justification and brother branham says
[1:42:21] that and the justification was under
[1:42:23] luther
[1:42:26] everybody okay
[1:42:27] sanctification was wesley
[1:42:30] and the baptism of the holy spirit we
[1:42:33] know our messenger
[1:42:34] everybody here
[1:42:36] and last sunday we found out that luther
[1:42:38] have a big baby called calvin
[1:42:43] everybody okay
[1:42:44] and wesley has a big baby called
[1:42:47] armenians
[1:42:49] everybody here so far
[1:42:51] everybody okay so far so when we started
[1:42:54] we went to roof deciding
[1:42:56] by repenting and water baptism or roof
[1:43:00] under justification
[1:43:02] or roof on the looter
[1:43:05] or roof under cavern
[1:43:09] hey buddy okay
[1:43:10] now we are in roof serving
[1:43:13] in other words roof under sanctification
[1:43:17] or roof under wesley or roof under
[1:43:20] armenian
[1:43:24] everybody okay so far
[1:43:25] brother branham says this
[1:43:27] that we talk of that kingsman redemon
[1:43:31] which we found out was crust
[1:43:34] top it up with here with roof roof
[1:43:38] deciding
[1:43:40] roof serving
[1:43:41] roof resting
[1:43:43] deciding was justification you already
[1:43:46] know that
[1:43:48] serving kama
[1:43:50] making herself water
[1:43:53] so roof surfing according to brother
[1:43:55] branham
[1:43:59] means roof
[1:44:02] is making herself ready
[1:44:09] because what branham said that it's like
[1:44:12] a glass
[1:44:13] that was dropped in numerically
[1:44:16] he said when you pick up the glasses
[1:44:18] justification but the glass is dirty
[1:44:21] about here but when you clean the glass
[1:44:24] it's sanctification and sanctification
[1:44:26] means to clean every care and set aside
[1:44:30] for what
[1:44:32] sanctification means to clean
[1:44:36] and set aside
[1:44:38] for service
[1:44:40] every care
[1:44:41] for service that's why sanctification is
[1:44:45] making herself ready in other words roof
[1:44:49] preparing herself
[1:44:54] everybody here
[1:44:55] something dropped here
[1:44:57] roof decided
[1:45:00] everybody okay but roof have to serve
[1:45:05] you can decide on the husband
[1:45:11] everybody okay but you gotta learn how
[1:45:14] to serve
[1:45:16] or you gotta prepare yourself
[1:45:19] or make yourself ready for that marriage
[1:45:25] everybody okay you gotta know how to
[1:45:27] watch this season
[1:45:29] you gotta know how to clean up a house
[1:45:32] you gotta know how to take care of your
[1:45:34] little brother and sister
[1:45:37] everybody okay you gotta know how to fix
[1:45:40] your bedroom
[1:45:41] you gotta know how to spend your money
[1:45:45] you gotta know how to buy groceries
[1:45:48] you gotta know how to pay bills
[1:45:51] you gotta prepare yourself make yourself
[1:45:54] ready
[1:45:57] for the oncoming harassment
[1:46:02] everybody okay
[1:46:04] don't trust in credit card
[1:46:07] they can block it for you
[1:46:10] if it's no outside amazon can deliver
[1:46:13] when it snows
[1:46:15] everybody
[1:46:16] so making herself ready sanctification
[1:46:20] resting was with the holy spirit
[1:46:23] until the wedding supper come
[1:46:26] how beautiful
[1:46:29] the church come through john wesley
[1:46:32] martin luther justification
[1:46:35] john wesley sanctification pentecostal
[1:46:38] baptism of the holy spirit now resting
[1:46:41] everybody
[1:46:42] waiting for the coming of god
[1:46:44] a roof rewarded everybody cares so far
[1:46:47] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:46:50] brother branham if you notice here
[1:46:55] the step
[1:46:57] of justification
[1:47:00] if you did it correctly
[1:47:02] you remember
[1:47:03] sincerely
[1:47:05] this step automatically
[1:47:08] will move you into sanctification
[1:47:13] anybody care anybody
[1:47:15] because justification make way
[1:47:18] for sanctification in other words when
[1:47:20] justification is plateau
[1:47:24] when you finish your step of
[1:47:26] justification
[1:47:27] automatically it will open the door for
[1:47:30] sanctification
[1:47:32] because between
[1:47:34] before you enter the other court you
[1:47:36] have the gate
[1:47:39] everybody okay
[1:47:41] that gate is who
[1:47:44] you already know that
[1:47:46] and before you enter the holy place you
[1:47:49] have water
[1:47:50] the door
[1:47:52] and that door is who
[1:47:56] and before you enter the holy place you
[1:47:58] have the veil
[1:48:00] and that fail is who
[1:48:05] anybody here
[1:48:06] so if they crashed that open the gate
[1:48:12] do you follow me
[1:48:14] the holy spirit that opened your gate
[1:48:17] unto justification
[1:48:19] is the same christ that will
[1:48:21] automatically open the gate unto
[1:48:25] sanctification and it's the same christ
[1:48:27] that will open the gate also unto the
[1:48:30] baptism of the holy spirit you just have
[1:48:33] to make sure what you did that the gate
[1:48:36] is correct
[1:48:42] everybody okay so far
[1:48:44] brother paul saying hebrew 10 that
[1:48:47] heaven therefore brethren
[1:48:50] boldness to enter into the water
[1:48:53] holiest the third one by the blood of
[1:48:57] jesus christ
[1:48:59] by a new and living way which he has
[1:49:02] consecrated for us through the water
[1:49:06] that is to say to his water
[1:49:09] so when they were preaching jesus christ
[1:49:12] do you know what came out of it
[1:49:15] water and water
[1:49:16] and water
[1:49:18] which was talking about somebody giving
[1:49:20] birth
[1:49:21] the birth by a man
[1:49:25] a man giving birth
[1:49:31] the birth of a man is always on the side
[1:49:38] the breath of adam happened by the river
[1:49:45] you burn off a woman you're in trouble
[1:49:48] but when you burn off a man it's a
[1:49:50] different story
[1:49:57] everybody okay so far
[1:49:59] so there when you get to the ver which
[1:50:02] is the flesh this is where the birth
[1:50:04] conversion
[1:50:06] conversion
[1:50:08] the new birth happen
[1:50:12] pentecostal confuse this
[1:50:15] they say you give your heart to jesus
[1:50:16] christ you got the holy ghost no have
[1:50:18] you received the holy ghost since you
[1:50:21] believe
[1:50:23] here so the gate is crushed the door is
[1:50:28] crushed the veil is crushed the same
[1:50:31] christ automatically we bring you into
[1:50:34] something amen
[1:50:35] amen but if you've been in the message
[1:50:38] so long without the holy ghost you need
[1:50:41] to check your experience
[1:50:44] maybe you are in the message what you
[1:50:47] are because you were born in the message
[1:50:50] and you think by being born in a message
[1:50:53] and dressing like message people and
[1:50:55] acting like the people in the message
[1:50:57] you have the holy ghost you don't have
[1:51:00] the holy ghost even if you are born in a
[1:51:02] message and you never wear a paint and
[1:51:05] they never pierce your ear and
[1:51:08] everything look clean like the rich
[1:51:10] young ruler you must have a day that you
[1:51:14] settle you and jesus christ
[1:51:17] you must have a day that you give your
[1:51:19] heart
[1:51:20] because your birth in the message was a
[1:51:23] mess
[1:51:26] you were born in a message by sex
[1:51:30] the nature that you were born in a
[1:51:32] message is a wrong nature
[1:51:34] even though everything that you do is
[1:51:37] correct by religion you need to take
[1:51:40] your heart and give it to the lord once
[1:51:43] you do that automatically
[1:51:47] it will open the door to your
[1:51:49] sanctification
[1:51:50] nobody taught rahab what to do
[1:51:55] there were no preacher over there
[1:51:57] telling her now it's time for you to be
[1:52:00] moving
[1:52:01] when she saw the jews automatically she
[1:52:04] moved
[1:52:05] and by moving she was justified by her
[1:52:09] action
[1:52:13] everybody okay so far
[1:52:17] hallelujah so now we are entering roof
[1:52:21] surfing
[1:52:23] roof surfing
[1:52:25] means that roof now have moved from down
[1:52:28] here
[1:52:29] can i repeat it again
[1:52:30] roof is no longer under justification
[1:52:33] she's no longer in the deciding point
[1:52:36] she already passed the president she
[1:52:38] already passed the left she already
[1:52:40] passed luther she already passed calvin
[1:52:43] now roof is moving up
[1:52:46] into the roof serving into the holy
[1:52:49] place
[1:52:50] now the circle now is in a holy place
[1:52:58] be the name of the lord
[1:53:00] roof now
[1:53:01] serving in the holy place
[1:53:04] everybody so far
[1:53:06] brother branham says this in the holy
[1:53:08] place
[1:53:10] he
[1:53:10] says first she had to decide
[1:53:14] whether she was going to go into this
[1:53:17] land or not
[1:53:18] with naomi she had to make a water
[1:53:22] do you know when jericho was taken off
[1:53:26] and rahab and her family came out

[1:53:40] and do you know she got married in which
[1:53:42] tribe
[1:53:44] why a man of judah love her
[1:53:51] if you need a scripture you let me know
[1:53:54] because the genealogy of jesus christ is
[1:53:57] talking about the land of judah that's
[1:54:00] why rahab is there rahab was the mother
[1:54:03] of boras
[1:54:07] anybody care why only a man of judah
[1:54:10] have to marry rehab

[1:54:27] remember the tribe of judah was right
[1:54:30] here
[1:54:31] remember the tribe of judah was right
[1:54:33] here so that's why rahab have to enter
[1:54:36] by judah and by entering on judah not

[1:59:54] the lord has testified against me and
[1:59:57] the almighty have done what
[1:59:59] so as they were coming
[2:00:03] here things were not as pleasant as
[2:00:06] rooftop
[2:00:10] you enter a different zone
[2:00:13] so when you see things begin to change
[2:00:15] after you give your heart to the lord
[2:00:20] you get in the congregation everything
[2:00:22] good everybody is hugging you oh praise
[2:00:24] the lord it's good sister we need to
[2:00:27] comfort the sister and suddenly you will
[2:00:29] see one of the sister become mean to you
[2:00:34] don't worry you're only changing the
[2:00:36] stages
[2:00:38] don't look at that sister
[2:00:40] don't get distracted
[2:00:42] because she might be in the other court
[2:00:45] or she might be in the camp
[2:00:47] and the devil begin to use her to make
[2:00:50] you uncomfortable
[2:00:54] pray for her
[2:00:56] don't hate her it is a signal that you
[2:01:00] are flipping the article from the other
[2:01:03] court into the holy place
[2:01:10] everybody okay
[2:01:12] so now when somebody get mad on you you
[2:01:14] know what to do right
[2:01:15] you get to your work you say praise the
[2:01:18] lord i receive the lord jesus christ now
[2:01:21] my heart feels so clean you're going to
[2:01:23] work you thought everything will be good
[2:01:25] at work as soon as you get to work it
[2:01:28] looks like things change
[2:01:31] you talk to somebody
[2:01:32] i don't want to talk to you
[2:01:34] he said what have i done
[2:01:37] is there any problem
[2:01:42] you wonder you said what happened it
[2:01:44] looks like what i did that the altar is
[2:01:47] breaking everything
[2:01:49] like hell is turn loose
[2:01:53] we thought it's gonna be easy when i get
[2:01:56] there we will see a beautiful
[2:01:59] house me and naomi go sit no
[2:02:03] roof serving
[2:02:07] are we okay
[2:02:08] if you're not taught this thing
[2:02:11] you're gonna be in trouble
[2:02:13] and then you get caught up with who
[2:02:15] hates you and thinks and then you get
[2:02:17] discouraged and when you get discouraged
[2:02:20] it looks like since i start getting
[2:02:22] serious with the lord everything became
[2:02:24] it's not working good it is a good sign
[2:02:30] it is a very good sign that you going
[2:02:33] you are in the right direction
[2:02:36] because the devil is trying to prove you
[2:02:39] that the decision you made is wrong
[2:02:42] so you need to go back
[2:02:47] because entering justification is gonna
[2:02:50] begin to deal with the snake
[2:02:54] you begin to master the snake
[2:02:57] and the devil doesn't like it
[2:02:59] he wants you in a justified state when
[2:03:02] you are hypocrite
[2:03:06] when you do things wrong and you go and
[2:03:09] you repent and tomorrow you go back and
[2:03:10] you do it the same way
[2:03:24] lord help me
[2:03:25] where are we at barefooted
[2:03:28] camera gleaming behind the reaper
[2:03:32] you gotta clean
[2:03:35] not any kind of way
[2:03:37] you cannot go before the reaper
[2:03:43] this book
[2:03:46] this book is so loaded
[2:03:49] it's so loaded
[2:03:50] you have to be behind
[2:04:01] [Music]
[2:04:04] so once you enter sanctification
[2:04:08] you must stay tight
[2:04:11] and following the movement of the reaper
[2:04:15] because you need strength
[2:04:17] you need food
[2:04:20] the devil is fighting you
[2:04:23] and the reaper is there to make the food
[2:04:26] fall
[2:04:27] [Music]
[2:04:32] are you okay
[2:04:34] do you follow me the reaper has a job to
[2:04:37] make sure to send the encouragement
[2:04:41] don't worry god is with you he will
[2:04:43] start the work on you we will finish it
[2:04:46] until the day of jesus christ
[2:04:52] so when you stay cut in church
[2:04:54] the reaper will continue to bring food
[2:04:57] that's why you come to church tired you
[2:05:00] leave church and you feel like you
[2:05:01] strong again
[2:05:02] because you just pick up something from
[2:05:04] the reaper

[2:31:36] demsel that came back with naomi out of

[2:31:59] after the reaper among the chief
[2:32:03] so she came
[2:32:04] and has continued everybody care
[2:32:08] even from morning until now and she
[2:32:11] terry a litter in the house
[2:32:16] now
[2:32:18] let's drop this so i'm gonna probably
[2:32:20] let you here
[2:32:22] everybody here
[2:32:24] if you remember who was the husband of
[2:32:26] ruth
[2:32:28] marlon
[2:32:29] the bible says in ruth chapter one
[2:32:32] that marlon and gee and killian died
[2:32:36] also both of them and the woman was left
[2:32:39] of her two son and her husband
[2:32:42] anybody care
[2:32:44] the death of marlon was necessary for
[2:32:47] ruth
[2:32:49] follow me very carefully
[2:32:51] the death of marlon
[2:32:54] the death of malone
[2:32:57] was important
[2:33:01] everybody here
[2:33:02] very important vip it have to happen
[2:33:06] anybody care
[2:33:08] because paul says in romans 7
[2:33:11] that for the woman which has a husband
[2:33:13] is bound to the lord to her husband so
[2:33:17] long as she lives
[2:33:19] this husband here is your nature
[2:33:25] that you were born with
[2:33:29] everybody here
[2:33:31] whether you were born with the parent in
[2:33:34] the message or not
[2:33:38] you all were born by sex
[2:33:42] so if you born with a parenting message
[2:33:46] automatically you have a snack in you
[2:33:50] as pure as your parents are
[2:33:53] and who that is born of a prostitute
[2:33:57] is not different than you
[2:34:04] the only grace you have
[2:34:06] is your parents are already in the
[2:34:09] message and they are saving you a lot of
[2:34:11] trouble
[2:34:13] versus somebody who's born under a
[2:34:15] prostitute
[2:34:18] everybody okay so far everybody good so
[2:34:20] far
[2:34:21] blessed be the name of god so that first
[2:34:23] nature must die
[2:34:27] that's your first husband
[2:34:28] and paul said but if the husband be dead
[2:34:31] she's lose from the law of her husband
[2:34:34] she's not bound to anything anymore now
[2:34:36] you're free
[2:34:37] and while her husband leaveth she and
[2:34:40] she's being married to another man she
[2:34:43] shall be called water
[2:34:44] how many adulterers do we have
[2:34:46] spiritually in the message
[2:34:48] because you were born in a message you
[2:34:49] think you need to go to the holiest
[2:34:54] you want the holy ghost but you don't
[2:34:56] want to get rid of that nature
[2:34:58] you still have the nature of the things
[2:35:00] of the world and you want the holy ghost
[2:35:02] to come on top of it
[2:35:04] that's why it doesn't happen that's why
[2:35:07] all this time you cannot get the holy
[2:35:09] ghost
[2:35:11] sometimes you thought you got in it
[2:35:13] because you got under an anointed of a
[2:35:16] good sermon and afterwards your life
[2:35:19] proved again that you didn't have it
[2:35:20] because your habit is still the same
[2:35:23] but i thought over there i felt
[2:35:25] something you go home you still behaving
[2:35:27] the same way you missed it because you
[2:35:29] don't want to let your husband go
[2:35:32] anybody okay so far
[2:35:34] now
[2:35:35] but if her husband
[2:35:37] your husband is a devilish clean
[2:35:42] husband because you're born in a message
[2:35:44] he's dirty but he's clean a little bit
[2:35:49] by
[2:35:52] religion he's a stinky husband
[2:35:56] that you are putting perfume on it
[2:36:00] to make him smell good
[2:36:02] but after the perfume is gone
[2:36:05] the stench should come back again
[2:36:08] you gotta take him out of you and put
[2:36:11] him in the garbage can
[2:36:15] hey but here while her husband leaves
[2:36:18] her she'll be married to another man she
[2:36:20] shall be called an adulteress
[2:36:22] but if her husband be dead
[2:36:24] she is what
[2:36:26] and so that she is not adulterous does
[2:36:29] she be married to another
[2:36:31] so the death of marlon is very important
[2:36:36] everybody okay
[2:36:38] but
[2:36:39] you ready keep your seatbelt
[2:36:42] the death of felimelec
[2:36:46] the death of killian
[2:36:48] stay closely with me
[2:36:50] the death of marlon
[2:36:53] was not the cause
[2:36:56] that moved now me back home
[2:37:02] it was necessary
[2:37:06] but it didn't move now me
[2:37:09] what moved naomi
[2:37:14] everybody okay
[2:37:16] then she arose
[2:37:18] with her daughters in law that's in my
[2:37:20] return from the country of moab
[2:37:24] why
[2:37:25] aha
[2:37:26] for
[2:37:28] seawater
[2:37:32] she heard
[2:37:33] in the country of moab
[2:37:36] like rahab
[2:37:38] how that the lord
[2:37:40] has visited his people in giving them
[2:37:44] water
[2:37:45] move that allowed me to go back
[2:37:49] was the news about the bread
[2:38:00] you want to go home
[2:38:03] ever here
[2:38:04] the death is necessary it is important
[2:38:09] but it didn't move it's what moved was
[2:38:12] the news
[2:38:14] about water
[2:38:22] give me few minutes
[2:38:24] i'm gonna stop somewhere
[2:38:26] okay hallelujah i can't even touch the
[2:38:30] candlestick
[2:38:31] anybody here
[2:38:33] in roof one verse 22
[2:38:36] the bible said naomi returned
[2:38:39] and roofed the moabites
[2:38:41] her daughter-in-law with her which
[2:38:44] returned out of the country of moab orpa
[2:38:47] is gone
[2:38:48] and they came to bethlehem
[2:38:51] everybody okay
[2:38:53] in the water
[2:38:54] of water
[2:38:56] water
[2:38:58] body water
[2:39:01] when they left
[2:39:03] and they enter bethlehem
[2:39:14] they enter in the beginning
[2:39:19] of water
[2:39:26] everybody okay
[2:39:28] tighten up pretty good
[2:39:31] harvest
[2:39:32] everybody clear
[2:39:34] means the seed
[2:39:48] the seed died
[2:39:50] they were watering the seed
[2:39:53] and the seeds showed up
[2:39:56] and you shouldn't go
[2:39:58] taser bled
[2:40:00] and shack
[2:40:04] and the sun
[2:40:05] at that time is changing the temperature
[2:40:09] you remember the changing of the
[2:40:11] temperature of the sun you remember last
[2:40:13] sunday
[2:40:14] then at the beginning of harvest the
[2:40:17] life have left the shack
[2:40:21] their entire life is now in the grain
[2:40:25] that's why they can take the ground and
[2:40:29] make bread
[2:40:33] [Music]
[2:40:36] another word
[2:40:38] in other words
[2:40:41] are we okay
[2:40:42] another word
[2:40:43] when the husband died
[2:40:51] and they were still in more web
[2:40:55] it was the planting season
[2:41:09] the death of the husband
[2:41:12] is explained by power
[2:41:18] remember in the old testament
[2:41:21] we got moses
[2:41:24] and who
[2:41:28] we got paul and who
[2:41:36] everybody okay
[2:41:37] and we got moses again
[2:41:40] and elijah going back to the jews
[2:41:43] and the one who's speaking
[2:41:45] about the death of the husband is who
[2:41:54] and which season
[2:42:01] are we okay
[2:42:03] are we okay
[2:42:04] if i lose you raise your hand
[2:42:08] praise god
[2:42:09] let me start again
[2:42:12] we have a delay at the airport
[2:42:14] there is a traffic so bear with me as
[2:42:16] i'm turning around the airport
[2:42:19] i'm trying to land
[2:42:21] everybody okay so far
[2:42:24] when they got to bethlehem it was a
[2:42:27] harvest
[2:42:28] so meaning that the crop were already
[2:42:31] planted
[2:42:33] and the crop already grew
[2:42:35] and when they grew the crop became
[2:42:37] mature now they can take the crop and
[2:42:40] make bread
[2:42:41] so when they heard the news the crop
[2:42:43] were already planted
[2:42:45] but during the time of the planting
[2:42:48] naomi and roof were still in moab
[2:42:53] and the death of the husband must happen
[2:42:56] the gospel of paul must happen over
[2:43:00] there
[2:43:02] everybody here
[2:43:03] you okay
[2:43:04] you okay
[2:43:06] let me help you up again
[2:43:10] the barley season was the bread season
[2:43:14] the season when fresh bread was being
[2:43:17] served
[2:43:18] and the church in this
[2:43:22] last day
[2:43:24] not the day of the paul
[2:43:27] in the last day
[2:43:29] in the last day through the 2000 year
[2:43:33] of pagan teaching
[2:43:35] has come in the water
[2:43:38] everybody here
[2:43:40] there is a planting season
[2:43:43] and a harvest season
[2:43:47] at the planting season your husband must
[2:43:50] die
[2:43:53] i'm going slowly
[2:43:54] i told you it's tough
[2:43:56] nobody care
[2:43:58] and the freshness of life
[2:44:00] new bread
[2:44:02] honey out of water
[2:44:04] honey crust
[2:44:07] in other words that bread
[2:44:10] has honey
[2:44:12] so when you eat
[2:44:13] it's a sweet bread
[2:44:18] when the book was handed to john
[2:44:21] by the mighty angel that put one foot on
[2:44:25] the sea one foot on the ground and
[2:44:27] raised his other when when john ate the
[2:44:30] book it was what
[2:44:32] like water

[2:44:48] i am the bread of life
[2:44:51] your father did eat manna and i did but
[2:44:55] i am the bread of life that come down
[2:44:57] from heaven out of heaven if any man
[2:45:00] eats the bread he shall
[2:45:02] and the church in the last day here is
[2:45:05] brought right down at water
[2:45:07] so burnley or harvest season
[2:45:10] is the end time
[2:45:16] because at the end time we are dealing
[2:45:19] with the fruit
[2:45:21] when you plant
[2:45:22] you planting a
[2:45:24] wheat
[2:45:26] everybody here at the end of harvest
[2:45:30] you're receiving a wheat
[2:45:32] that looks exactly
[2:45:35] like the wheat that was planted
[2:45:40] everybody here so they're planting have
[2:45:43] wheat
[2:45:45] we okay
[2:45:46] and the harvest has wheat
[2:45:53] head wheat
[2:45:58] and the harvest has wheat
[2:46:01] that's why brother branham say i preach
[2:46:04] like
[2:46:09] malachi 4 come
[2:46:11] to turn the heart of the children back
[2:46:14] to the original
[2:46:16] wit
[2:46:18] back to the origin of faith
[2:46:21] the faith i have is exactly the fifth
[2:46:24] that started over there
[2:46:27] week to week
[2:46:29] in between it's something different
[2:46:33] it is just a journey
[2:46:36] everybody okay now
[2:46:38] everybody okay now
[2:46:39] did i lose anybody
[2:46:44] hallelujah
[2:46:45] where are we going
[2:46:47] anybody clear
[2:46:49] there is a principle
[2:46:52] that goes with harvest
[2:46:55] so if you have a problem
[2:46:58] now get this and it's going to solve
[2:47:00] your trouble
[2:47:01] you ready now
[2:47:04] in john chapter 4 verse 35 jesus said
[2:47:08] say not ye they are yet for month and
[2:47:11] then cometh the what
[2:47:14] behold i say unto you lift up your eyes
[2:47:17] and look on there
[2:47:20] plural for they are
[2:47:22] white
[2:47:23] already to what
[2:47:25] if the other word the grain are mature
[2:47:28] you cannot make bread
[2:47:30] with a shack because when you open the
[2:47:33] shack the seed is not formed yet it
[2:47:35] looks like the seed but the seed is
[2:47:37] formed within the shack
[2:47:39] but here you have to take the seed and
[2:47:42] make the bread out of it so naomi heard
[2:47:45] the news that there is bread in other
[2:47:47] words it is the time of the seed
[2:47:50] the seed have already matured but the
[2:47:52] husband are already dead
[2:47:54] they were waiting for the time of the
[2:47:57] harvest so they can begin to go
[2:48:02] everybody okay
[2:48:04] and there and he that does what
[2:48:08] refresh receive his water
[2:48:11] and gather fruit unto water
[2:48:14] and he the what
[2:48:16] and he that repeats may water
[2:48:19] so there is one that's sauce
[2:48:30] oh my god
[2:48:33] the principal of a farmer
[2:48:36] there is a somewhere
[2:48:41] or a planter
[2:48:46] with a sowing season
[2:48:48] and there is a reaper
[2:48:53] amen which is in the harvest
[2:48:58] everybody okay so far
[2:49:00] number one
[2:49:01] and naomi and ruth went not at the
[2:49:04] sowing season but at the season of the
[2:49:09] half of the reapers not the planter but
[2:49:12] the reapers but the plant have seed
[2:49:16] and the reaper also have seen
[2:49:20] the reaper is getting the seed that was
[2:49:23] planted by
[2:49:25] the
[2:49:26] sower
[2:49:28] the sower plant
[2:49:30] and he leaves
[2:49:31] and the reaper comes and recuperates the
[2:49:35] seed that the sower places so whatsoever
[2:49:40] one
[2:49:42] rebirth both of them
[2:49:46] both of them in the rapture
[2:49:52] so one of this day brother branham will
[2:49:55] go to call
[2:49:57] and say brother park
[2:50:03] we made it
[2:50:05] we made it

[2:52:27] of farming
[2:52:28] jesus said

[2:53:42] yes
[2:53:43] everyone can everybody care
[2:53:45] these laborers are
[2:53:48] workers
[2:53:51] but remember he's the lord of what
[2:53:55] harvest and harvest we don't have sowers
[2:54:01] we have
[2:54:02] reapers
[2:54:04] anybody here these laborers of the lord
[2:54:09] of harvest
[2:54:12] you ready
[2:54:14] our place in hierarchy
[2:54:19] all in category
[2:54:26] everybody
[2:54:27] they are all
[2:54:28] workers
[2:54:30] but they have different levels
[2:54:34] [Music]
[2:54:36] anybody here
[2:54:37] the chief
[2:54:39] among all the laborers
[2:54:45] is called
[2:54:47] the chief reaper
[2:54:53] he is the
[2:54:55] supervisor
[2:54:58] he is the boss
[2:55:00] not the owner
[2:55:02] the boss
[2:55:03] that supervised every reaper
[2:55:10] do you follow me
[2:55:11] under him
[2:55:13] you have
[2:55:15] others reapers
[2:55:20] everybody here
[2:55:21] are laborers
[2:55:23] and under those reapers you have
[2:55:27] maintenance
[2:55:30] are women
[2:55:33] servant
[2:55:43] you okay now
[2:55:44] let me drop my point
[2:55:46] when roof
[2:55:48] went
[2:55:49] into
[2:55:50] the field
[2:55:52] the gps told her
[2:55:54] to go to a certain spot when she went to
[2:55:57] the spot she went into the field that
[2:55:59] belongs to boaz
[2:56:02] but boaz was not there
[2:56:08] everybody okay
[2:56:09] everybody okay
[2:56:11] boaz was absent
[2:56:13] [Music]
[2:56:16] and boras left his field
[2:56:19] in under the hand
[2:56:22] of the chief
[2:56:24] reaper
[2:56:27] do you have your bible open a roof too
[2:56:30] look at roof too
[2:56:32] because
[2:56:33] i don't want you to look like i'm
[2:56:35] reading something different
[2:56:39] are you there
[2:56:40] verse 5 then said boaz to his water
[2:56:45] few people
[2:56:47] to his waters
[2:56:49] that was
[2:56:51] set over there
[2:56:54] that's the chief reaper
[2:56:56] that's the supervisor that's the manager
[2:56:59] that's the boss
[2:57:01] everybody here
[2:57:03] he says to him who is this worker
[2:57:07] so
[2:57:08] when boaz has a question
[2:57:11] about his field
[2:57:12] [Music]
[2:57:18] he doesn't go to anybody
[2:57:23] he doesn't go to any reapers
[2:57:26] he goes to the chief
[2:57:29] reaper
[2:57:30] the reaper that is on top of all the
[2:57:33] requests
[2:57:34] and say who is this
[2:57:37] damsel
[2:57:40] now that chief reaper begin to speak
[2:57:48] in other words when roof came
[2:57:51] in the field roof met the chief ripper
[2:58:00] everybody okay
[2:58:01] the chief reaper is the one that gives
[2:58:04] you permission
[2:58:11] because he's a steward
[2:58:16] he's the one that have the masters good
[2:58:23] like nds
[2:58:25] of damascus
[2:58:28] the things of the master belong to him
[2:58:31] everybody okay
[2:58:33] so roof and the chip reaper spoke
[2:58:36] when boaz was not there
[2:58:39] that's why when boaz is coming back he
[2:58:42] goes straight to the chief bleeper he
[2:58:45] said a war is over there
[2:58:52] so the chief reaper have to give answer
[2:58:57] your presence
[2:58:58] must be judged
[2:59:01] by the word
[2:59:02] of the chief reaper
[2:59:08] [Applause]
[2:59:12] that's why you heard paul saying that
[2:59:14] you will be judged by my gospel
[2:59:21] [Music]

[2:59:25] brother branham
[2:59:27] are you going there where is jesus
[2:59:30] christ i want to see jesus christ they
[2:59:33] thought brother branham they said no

[3:00:31] i'm dealing with the seed
[3:00:33] the one who had the seed
[3:00:35] is he gonna be judged they say yes
[3:00:39] he's gonna be judged he said it's god's
[3:00:42] of power
[3:00:43] anthem
[3:00:45] because paul have deceived
[3:00:47] mine also
[3:00:49] with your marion branham will also enter

[3:01:30] you don't serve any kind of way
[3:01:33] when you come
[3:01:35] you must come to the chief reaper
[3:01:39] because the chief reaper has a report
[3:01:42] to give
[3:01:43] to the owner the lord of the harvest
