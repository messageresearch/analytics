Hallelujah on April the 8th Lord's willing I have asked every Tech and every musician and all of them responded so that's the reason why I'm coming up with this final decision we will have our music part two it's gonna be Saturday April 8th at four o'clock here in the church how many heard me say that Saturday at four o'clock amen amen glory to God so that would be music part two so we went with music part one part one already for those that were there give you a proper calibration for any music including the music that has that are coming from message believers you remember that not only the people outside even those in the message you need to check what kind of music they're singing you don't want to hear all kind of stuff everybody okay glory to God don't worry something is coming up pretty good amen amen you heard sister Olga already here right you know what happened to the family right not only to her family but to the church family everybody okay after 11 years of separation when I was preaching about the curtains of the Tabernacle the next curtain had 11 Cubit and I want to dealt with number 11 but the boss took me into a different route 11 have a significance I keep it secret for right now but there is a reason why your husband have to be here 11 years amen so brother Manhattan I know people already clap but I want you to stand so that everybody would know you and will see you sister Olga you can stand here welcome to spoken word Tabernacle thank you thank you thank you very much you might be seated 11 years raising children in this country is easy and raising boys Mama raising boys is that easy upon the sovereignty of the local church and the supreme authority of the local church this is a token from your pastor come again congratulations thank you very much amen I love my church and I love the people of my church I want to do everything I can to make them happy amen if you want to back it up or come with me the sovereignty the supremacy of the local church I have a quote for that one in other words stay there sister just enjoy everybody okay glory be to the name of the Lord our next question and answer will be on April 15th that will be here at the church everybody clear I believe I got everything covered so far and there is one more we appreciate everybody that is following us on streaming online some of them are very consistent they like part of this church so God richly bless you welcome this morning and we welcome you also to spoken word Tabernacle and I want to clarify something when I say I'm preaching this for this church what do I really mean amen brother Branham says this glory to God he says now a way we try to follow here at the Tabernacle is the only place in the world that I go and I do what preach Doctrine everybody okay he's here at the Tabernacle because this is our church and we preach Doctrine here to keep the people lying now add a man in their churches they preach whatever they believe and they are my brothers and we might different a little bit but we still brother just the same but here in the Tabernacle we preach what we think is scriptural Doctrine everybody okay I have ministered I have opened the entire congregation to be listening to what I preach here everybody okay the entire congregation they're not even in America they're listening to what I'm preaching here that's the decision of the shepherd but we have a lot of Minister I talked to them they'll send me asking me question a lot of ministers that are following and As I Grew in this message by the grace of God I come across a lot of Doctrine not that I went in different churches but sometimes when I talk to people and I can catch a Doctrine and a Doctrine and a Doctrine in the doctrine amen so every church is Sovereign so sometimes there are things that I will be preaching here I'm gonna go through the scripture and through the message of the hour but he must Shake somebody else Doctrine somewhere that is streaming so I want to respect their Church uh Authority or Supremacy that's the reason why I usually refer that I'm preaching to this church but if you are receiving it as the word of God there is no problem at all because what I preach doesn't come from myself I usually started from the scripture and I back it up with the message of the hour amen so if my Doctrine here which is the message of the hour is a little bit different view than what another Minister sees there that's the reason why I usually say this is for discharge amen but in all respect you're more than welcome to take the code take the scripture because after all we are the Bride of Jesus Christ and the gift is for the perfecting of the descent amen the entire blood so if he blesses you praise the Lord but I want to just respect the local church right there and make sure if what you're preaching people you follow your pastor but I'm responsible for this church but more than welcome welcome welcome welcome and we're good to have you online on board thank you very much and welcome in spoken word Tabernacle amen so when I say I'm preaching to this church I'm just going to be cautious about other ministers having a different point of view in their Doctrine compared to what I'm bringing here everybody okay so welcome online thank you very much to have you on board let's stand and go to our scripture glory to God Hallelujah I was so happy with the question and answer yesterday if you were not there we already established what we believe here so do not bring again tape stuff and discussion and stuff we don't have time for that we gave you scripture we gave you code and we nail it and I'm gonna add five more quotes everybody okay and then we move on we already preach about church order December 3rd Church order in February we spoke about music how to calibrate music we will go with part two we went through our position here there is even something that I'm letting someone to ask the question I already got the vaccine for it so whoever will ask the question then I will pull it out amen and it will answer some some of the stuff that are going around amen glory to God let's go to Genesis chapter 38. this church is so relaxing again last Sunday we were unable to touch what I wanted to touch this is a very difficult subject amen it is very very difficult any puzzle ministers and Pastor on this subject so I want you to follow me carefully because a lot of Souls have been blocked because of this and they don't know what to do and it can cause somebody to commit suicide if you don't know what you're doing but today nobody will commit suicide we will take you off from where you are and free you completely because you will know the truth and the truth will set you everybody okay God is not the author of confusion God never the author of confusion so it's a very very difficult subject stay up and follow me carefully everybody okay Genesis chapter 38 if you dare you can say Amen I'm going to start by verse 11. the same scripture we read then say Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law remain a widow you know now what he means at your father's house till Sheila my son be grown for he said lest perhaps he die also as his breath indeed and Tema went and dwelled in her father's house so Judah want to play tricks on this woman thinking maybe she's a witch killing my children I don't want the third one to die you need to stay away everybody okay in in the process of time you might be seated you know why you stand for the scripture right you saw you remember yesterday right okay and in the process of time the daughter of shua judah's wife died and was comforted and went up to the to his ships here to timna he and his friend ARA the adolomite and he was told Tamar saying behold your father-in-law goes up to timna to share his ship everybody clear and she put her widows garment off from her and cover her with a veil and wrap herself and sat in an open place where is which is by the way to Tim now for she saw that Sheila was grown and she was getting she was uh and she was not given to him as a wife in other words my husband is grown up I was supposed to be married but it looks like I perceived something is wrong when Judah saw her he thought her to be a harlot but she was not a Harlow she was her daughter-in-law because she had covered her face and he turned to her by the way and say God too I pray you let me come into you for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law everybody clear there and she said what will you give me that you may come into me and he said I will send you a kid from The Flock and she said will you give me a pledge in other words Judah didn't have his wallet until you send it and he said what pledge shall I give you and she said your Signet you know what he means and your bracelet plural you know what he means and your stuff that is in your hand and he gave it her and he came into her and she conceived by him if you notice Judah didn't give these things before the ACT Amina after the ACT hey everybody okay He Did It Before the woman want to make sure that I must receive my payment everybody okay before we move further into business I want to make sure you know what you're doing and Judah check and he realized he does have his wallet and the woman said no problem if you don't have a wallet I don't have any problem amen why didn't this woman say you don't have a wallet go ahead and go back because she was not a true prostitute because the Bible says that a prostitute receive salary everybody okay she was not a true president she was playing like a prostitute in other words it is not money that I'm looking for I am not looking for money amen but I want you everybody okay and for some reason Judah could not say you know what I don't have money let me just let it go Judah said no no no no no no no no no let me give a place say what do you want to pledge Judah look nothing he said you see there look he say what my he said this yes can I have that one Judah pull it up and say he said that's okay say no you see what you're handling on the hand there woman they say hey you have a choice either you give it or you continue on the highway everybody okay Judah said you know what let me give it and she said you see the two bracelets here that say Jesus love me we already went to men do not put bracelet everybody okay you see the bracelet right here he says so what the president I already gave you two he said no in the mouth of two air witness I wanna go to through here give it to yes how many both of them Judah the woman turkey said praise the Lord now follow me what is going on what's going on with Judah why he didn't borrow from his friend why interesting job to verse 24. if you dare you can say amen glory to God hallelujah and he came to pass about three months everything is gone that he was told Judah I'm skipping saying temar your daughter-in-law has played the Harlow and also behold she is with a child by water hold on not only did she play the Harlot because you can play the Harlot and go back and never get pregnant but for some reason this time just water she got pregnant why did it happen like that who arranged this thing was Judah in contact with all the OB GYN in the land how did he know stuff who was putting this thing together he looked bad so it happened just like that amen I'm letting you think through and Judah said bring her forth and let her be water burned when she was brought forth she sent to her father-in-law saying by the man whose these are before you execute the judgment I want you to consider one thing I want you to consider who you're trying to judge [Music] I want you to consider who you're trying to burn because Judah wanted to burn her watch out who you trying to burn there are people that cannot be burned [Applause] unburnable in other words we cannot be burned by hair no the Lake of Fire because the Lake of Fire is the second death the second death have no power in US you remember that he said Judah considered before you send me to the Lake of Fire everybody okay you need to know who I am when things were happening you didn't know me but now I need to open my identity so you know who I am and when you know who I am then I'm gonna sit down and begin to drink Coca-Cola waiting for you to put judgment on me if you can you have not coded it entering in the presence of the king means death [Applause] and terrim and look at the king and say pronounce judgment if you can everybody okay everybody okay a glory to God Amen discern I pray you who are these Signet and bracelet and stuff in hand three amen and Judah acknowledged them he didn't acknowledge the woman everybody okay he acknowledged his stuff that went to the woman [Music] so the woman spent some time with the staff of Judah I'm just reading the same scripture you're reading three months amen and he just brought Judah backward belongs to him and when Judah deserved not the woman what belongs to him and he was in the hand of tema he understood which seed was inside tema the evidence was Pro who was telling which seed is in because they didn't have DNA in that time this is the perfect DNA everybody good glory to God verse 26 and Judah acknowledged them and say she has been more how can she be more righteous deceptor of righteousness come from Judah she has been more righteous than I because that I gave her not to Sheila my son and he knew her again no more everybody okay now what follows and he came to pass in the time of her travel that behold twins were in heaven and he came to pass that she traveled that the one pulled out his hand the Midwife took and bound upon his hand they Scarlet thread saying this came out first everybody okay and he came to pass as he drew back his hand that behold his brother came out these are teaching deep here say how have you broken forth we're not going to get into this this bridge be upon you therefore his name was called what for us so Grandpa everybody okay fairies and his Brotherhood Zara or children of supposing Grandpa you know that right and mama but truly grandpa is Judah amen and mama is a daughter-in-law everybody okay a relationship between a father in law and a daughter-in-law that relationship is called incest in other words it is not lawful it's bad it happened and it didn't just happen he produced fruit what are we going to do to those fruit if it just happened we go to the president altar ask forgiveness forgive me forgive me don't do it no more you keep on your Highway 85 North you keep 85 South never know more no problem good but didn't stop there we got a problem that is permanent every time you look at that Chad it reminds you something that happened everybody okay when you saw when Judah saw fairies and uh Sarah coming up he just shook his head everybody okay it is something that constantly troubled Judah now put yourself in the shoes of these children are you following me it's very hard everybody okay what am I gonna do my father is the father-in-law to my mother why am I Born like this everybody okay where are we gonna put these children can they be Christian verse 30. and afterward came out his brother that had the Scarlet thread upon his hand and his name was called who so according to Genesis we found out that Zera and Pharisees came from an unlawful a bad Union nobody want to have a union like this but let's see the family of Jesus Christ we okay now are we okay okay I have to go slow because if I pull too strong I'm gonna lose somebody

a very good woman and everything good she also everybody okay now what I say by Rocking the Boat all these words was done without the blood of Jesus Christ you didn't get me this seed were pushed into the congregation of Israel without the blood of Jesus Christ I'm gonna say it again these women were put in the congregation of Israel and they're the old Covenant and the old covenant could never bring things to perfection [Applause] how can they enter with something that cannot make them perfect everybody okay so when you talk about Tema there is a bad connotation if you talk about rehab there is a bad connotation if you talk about roof no no no no that's a gentile woman if you talk about Bathsheba that's a bad woman her husband was in war look what she did everybody okay and then when you talk about Jesus the Bible said in John 4 8 40 41 but now you're seek to kill me a man that has taught you the truth which I have heard of who God this did not Abraham ye do the work of your father then say they to him to Jesus Christ we be not born of water even Jesus had the bad name everybody okay because according to the Jews the pregnancy that they say was virgin they say no you feelings nobody here nobody a virgin woman being pregnant you are fooling nobody there Joseph and Mary was doing something they did something that's why you were born of fornication and they took that tattle and they put on Jesus Christ so when Jesus Christ want to talk about the things of God they have that gun after a while they say you fornicated children shut up amen everybody okay let's go to the book of Acts that's what we do to people [Applause] that's what we do to people let's see who is a child of God let's see who can I help you up can I help you up Ishmael was the Seed of Abraham do you see him there why is he not there if you take the DNA of Ishmael you go with it into Lab Corp you pull it out you check Abraham and Ishmael they match 120 percent everybody okay everybody okay but they're not here and Abraham have even six more songs by Keturah do you see them over there so why can they remove the children of Abraham and bring children that were born from a father-in-law and a daughter-in-law everybody okay let's go to act 20 Act 13. Lord help me help me help me father everybody okay at the 13 if you dare you can say Amen verse 39 and by him Jesus Christ all that beliefs are Justified from water all things is there anything God cannot justify you I don't know if you get me this happened in the blood of bulls and goats but Jesus Christ when you get into him whatever was in you he can justify you from water [Music] do you know what justify mean you already know in this church it means that you water use your microphone my brother it means what life you've never done it before you've never done it to begin with from which you could not be justified by the law of who Moses so where the Lord stop where they lock the law had a threshold when he goes to its threshold the law is blocked then Grace take over from there and push you toward the end everybody okay everybody okay was Grace in the Old Testament slow down don't answer verse 40 be aware therefore lest that come upon you which is spoken in the prophet behold you this person and wonder and perish for I work a work in your days in your days a work with you which you shall be which you shall in Noize believe through a door a man declare it to you Paul is saying be careful there is a prophecy that say no matter what God is doing amen they can do it to you but you won't believe it I'm afraid because I'm pushing the gospel by you pushing that back I'm trying to check are you some of these people fulfilling that prophecy we okay verse 42 and when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue the Gentile besought that this word might be preached to them the next water so the Jews remember yesterday they received Jesus Christ they were supposed to receive the Messiah when they went out they Jetta yes digital the Gentile came after Paul they said brother come yeah what you preach is different than these Jewish people here that we hear all the time is there a possibility next Sunday and next Saturday you can come again and we want to hear some of this stuff everybody okay what was in those gentiles that love Paul and the Jews born with Paul are rejecting Paul what's going on are we okay job to verse 43 now when the congregation was broken up many of the Jews and religious prosely you see that followed who Paul and Barnabas who's speaking to them persuaded them to continue in the grace of God and the next Sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of who God but when the Jews so demountited they were filled with water envy and spoke against those things which were spoken by who contradicting and blaspheming they begin to contradict the message of power they begin to blaspheme the message of Paul because Paul is drawing many followers everybody okay what happened verse 45 and when uh verse 46 then Paul and Barnabas watchbold and say it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you you judge yourself how Unworthy of water everlasting life law we turn to the hook gentle for so has the Lord commended us saying I have set you to be a light of the Gentile that you should be for salvation to the end of the Earth watch verse 48 and when the Gentile heard this they were how glad Karma and the glorified the word they glorified the message of the hour [Applause] they didn't glorify Paul but the message of Paul they glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were water today to water eternal life did water believe what did they believe because they were ordained [Applause] to eternal life why do you believe this message why are you here this morning why you didn't stay in that church back there [Music] who are you following are you following me who are you following [Applause] who are you following the message of the hour because you are predestinated you were wired [Applause] everybody okay let's go to Roman nine buddy glory to God amen amen amen glory to God amen many many men Romans 9 verse 10. if you dare you can say Amen and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by what one in other words no adultery by one who Isaac so all these babies will be children of God because they were conceived by one husband one wife let's go even by Our Father who Isaac for the children being not yet what born need to have having done any good or whatever evil what do you have to do what do you have to do to go to hell amen amen that the purpose of God according to what election my stand not of water works but of him he was said to her the Elder Shall Serve the who younger as it is written Jacob ever loved but he so ever even though Esau was born from one father one mother the same as Jacob [Music] everybody okay let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father thanking you for your grace for your love for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we are committing this service unto their hand may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to your children we thank you for this time Lord in Jesus precious name amen my subject this morning follow me carefully is the four phases of roof the theophany and the seed of Grace the theophany and the seed Grace this seed is Grace you can never separate this seed from the grace everybody okay if you have that seed you already have Grace because Grace always is coupled with that seed Grace and that seed are won when that seed is formed Grace is mixed together with that seed everybody okay everybody okay glory to God we are alternating moving back and forth between roof chapter three and roof chapter four because the roof enter Israel but she still cannot get into the congregation of Israel why because roof was a moabite everybody okay there was something by the birth of roof everybody okay that block roof from entering the congregation of Israel that thing that was blocking roof happened because of his birth he was born in a wrong country she was born in a wrong country in a wrong nation and with wrong parent and because of that she was black to enter the congregation of Israel so now Ruth chapter 3 and roof chapter 4 are now working together everybody okay to break the hindrance of roof everybody okay and to open the way so that regardless of the breath of roof everybody okay regardless of the country of origin regardless of what hindrance is there roof must enter the congregation everybody okay when she entered then she's entitled to be United in the body amen and produce a baby baby in the Tabernacle we are alternating between the holiest and the changing of Dimension so what is going on today pastor when we spoke about the seed we found out that when God create his seed from a different line then line the temporary line remember yesterday we come out as a tabernacle of three part everybody okay we got the body we got our spirit and then we got the soul and in the soul in this tent in this Tabernacle inside the soul everybody okay there is something there that lays there and that thing is called the predestinated seed of God we already went through this you know that amen and we found out that this seed contain your whole identity everybody okay whatever you want today was already in daced hey everybody okay everything here is temporal everybody okay but this seed here is always eternal this seed never have a beginning and the seed never have an end as we saw last week brother Branham said remember you your eyes your stature whatever you want you were in his thinking at the beginning and the only thing that you are is expression that expression is called water word so that seed is a word everybody okay if you were there yesterday it makes your life really really happy everybody okay and that seed is the word and after he taught it he spoke it and here you are if it is not if he was not in his thinking there is no way enough for you to ever be there for he is the one that give water eternal life amen so if the seed is the word God himself is the word in other words by the seed we are automatically part of God everybody okay this is where we stop last Sunday we found in Luke chapter 8 verse 11 the Bible says that the seed is water the word of God and according to Matthew 13 the Bible said the field is the world and the good water see we're not good is God the god seed or the waters Children of the Kingdom so not only is the word a seed we also we are seed everybody okay John 12 verse 24 says Jesus said verily verily I say unto you except the water corn of we Jesus himself call himself a corn of wheat in other words crushed easy seed The Book of Romans chapter 4 verse 16 say therefore it is of water faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to who all the sea if you notice the Bible didn't say all the seeds everybody okay the promise must be to all the seed instead of putting s the Bible leave it singular so those seed are part of a seed [Applause] are we okay are we okay we'll be all right not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of who Abraham who is the father of us oh Roman nine because they are the Seed of Abraham neither because they are the Seed of Abraham or their children but in Isaac Shadow see if you notice against singular because that is they which are the children of the water flesh the Jews they are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the water seed if you notice seed is still singular glory to God Lord help me Galatians 3 verse 16. now to Abraham and his seeds singular where the promises made he said not and to water seeds that's not what he said as of what many but as of who won and that seed which is who Christ everybody okay galatian 33 verse 28 there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither born nor free there is neither Mel nor female for year or how one in who Christ Jesus everybody okay so when we talk about God cross the seed that seed is a singular seed but inside that seed there is many seed and all the seeds are represented in one everybody okay Paul says this he says if ye beware Christ amen then Yahoo Abraham and has according to water I promise in other words if you are in Christ Jesus then automatically you are the Seed of Abraham in other word crust remember yesterday as a seed has seed amen amen and we being in Christ we become part of the seed of God everybody okay praise be to the name of God this is what brother Branham says brother Branham saying now he says that he has chosen us where in him in who Jesus before the water foundation of the world that means that we were right there with him in his mind remember yesterday and what thoughts and thoughts of God before the water foundation of the world that give an eternal quality to who because Christ abideth forever whoever was in Christ also a bad day forever we are only pieces of God everybody okay let's continue we'll be okay if you are a Christian now what kind of Christian a genuine water predestinated sea you was in God before there was a you you always was where in God the germ remember yesterday of your life which is a water attribute of oh God which was his water so the seed remember yesterday we call it a thought we call it the word we call it an attribute but it's not your thought they thought like your thought it is a thought that is real everybody okay brother Branham say The Germ of your life which is an attribute of God which was his water don't so we are taught we are attribute we adjourn where are you going pastor glory to God William Marion Branham now we're going to get off from the airport what did he do he cleaned out the Blackness remember yesterday you remember yesterday we remember yesterday According to second Corinthians the Bible said God who shine delight at the beginning Shine the Light of the Gospel in our why in our heart because that is where the soul is and why is he Charming the light because damn in the saw there is bury a predestinated seed of God everybody okay brother say he cleaned out all the Blackness like the beginning and made it all what why why there was a seed doing what laying there every destinated seed that was it was God taught before the foundation of the world get it right here now you there you there notice that word cannot deny itself then it is how satisfying all it is the desire it is the desire of what William Marion Branham what made you desired in the first place why do you test for God foreign why you don't like the devil why you don't like the devil everybody okay do you feel you are the one liking God glory to God because Dan India so there was a water we Destiny which was water eternal life so before you receive eternal life you already have eternal life [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay brother Branham is saying that this seed here this predestinated seed is a germ amen because every seed inside the seed there is a life everybody okay that's why if you take a cone you put it in the ground it will grow as long as it stay here on the pulpit it will never go but it doesn't mean it's dead there is a life that is sleeping everybody okay everybody okay so before eternal life come to you everybody okay you must have eternal life [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay because God I'm when God created him Adam was both water and God himself was water and if God is male God must have a female [Applause] everybody okay God created man in his own in his father he created him how and God himself is how [Applause] everybody okay

already chosen you were programmed for salvation everybody okay let's go to Matthew 13. Lord help me Lord help me glory to God glory to God Matthew 13. if you dare you can say Amen you there verse 10. everybody okay who uh and the disciple came Jesus was talking to people using parable and the disciple look they say the way he's talking to them is different than the way he talked to us they say you know what don't disturb him you don't want to embarrass him in front of the people you wait when we go back over there when we return the home then you ask him a question why were you talking like this in front of people everybody okay and the disciple came and said to him why speak you to them in water parables he answered and said to them because it is given to you to know the water Mysteries to know the water is a mystery a problem how many Mysteries there let me leave it alone to know the Water Mystery of the kingdom of water heaven but to them it is not water so to know the mystery you must have something in you for you to know the mystery in other words you must have a mystery decoder that no matter how God is speaking somebody in you is interpreting whatever God is speaking to your own language to your own understanding any sad teacher [Applause] everybody okay can I continue verse 12 for whosoever has to him shall be what given and he shall have more abundantly but whoever has not from him shall be taken away even what he had listen carefully therefore everybody okay speak I to them in water because what they say they sing see not the first verb is to see how do you see in other words they are looking like this but they don't see it doesn't mean they are blind everybody okay everybody okay this seeing see not and doing water hearing and they're here no there is two verb there one is to see another one is water here here and the gospel uses these two things the gospel come not in word only healing but in demonstration seeing everybody okay everybody okay everybody good today seeing see not and hearing the hill not needed to the water understand there is a third thing understand glory to God what does it mean brother Stephen the first verse is see the second is here by the third is water you can see but you don't see you can hear but you really don't hear but even if you see and hear do you really understand everybody okay let's see what is going on first now uh 14 and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says by hearing you shall do what here and you shall not wow understand you can hear the sound you can hear the word but you don't understand what is really going on let's continue verse 14 they shall not understand and seeing you shall see and shall not water perceived so understanding and perception goes together everybody okay everybody okay seeing you must perceive hearing you must understand the seeing the understanding and the perception must be coupled together you ready now verse 15. for these peoples what the heart if you notice the Bible started with the eyes amen and the Bible moved from the eyes to the now the Bible is not touching the eye nor the ears but it's touching the water I thought the heart was a pump that pump blood what does the heart have to do with seeing and water because our hearing goes to our brain there is uh uh uh I mean a Nerf the 12 cranial nerve our sin goes there with the optic nerve so here what is this what is going on in here but brother Branham we already went through this explain to us that in the heart is the occupation of the Soul we already know that and inside the soul we see that there is a water thank you we okay now we okay he says verse 15 for this people's heart is what goes and their ears are dull of water hearing and the eyes they have done what clothes less at any time watch carefully they should water see with the water ice and water here with the water here and should what understand with that oh stop that understanding is where how does the heart understand who is understanding in the heart it is the seed that is in the soul the real you that was before the foundation of the Lord the word need to understand because the gospel is a trumpet when he sound the seed that is there put the ear like this say what is this looted what time is it the time of lutein the seed goes and snooze the alarm and it goes back when the gospel sound he said which church are you with now pentecosta [Music] everybody okay and one day they said God sent us a prophet [Applause] the seed woke up like this yeah say say it again repeat it again everybody okay repeat it again what did that preacher say and the preacher comes back again God send us a prophet by the name of William Marion Prana according to Revelation 10 Luke 17 30 Malachi 4. the seed Walk Up and Shake hand and say here I am [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay let's go and should understand with their water hot and should be how converted so conversion happened where and conversion will happen when the seed understand that's the new birth [Applause] that's why brother Branham said the new birth is a personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay and understand with their heart and should be how converted and I should do what heal them verse 16 but blessed are your water ice for the sea and your ears for the daughter here so to heal you must have something that will make you heal that will make you perceive that will decode the message of Yahweh and that thing have the love of the truth it is a female love [Applause] that is looking for the man love and wanted to unite you have an invisible Union anybody everybody okay brother Branham say a real seed of God is an absorbent for the spirit our denomination is water all unbelief is water and when the Holy Spirit come into the [Applause] Son of God [Applause] he give birth to a God and the God was the word that always was blessing you that was in God before the foundation of the world that's why the Bible say ye are God [Applause] amen glory to
