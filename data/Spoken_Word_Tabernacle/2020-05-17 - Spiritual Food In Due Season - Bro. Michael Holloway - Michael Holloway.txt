go back god help us friend our churches are losing their identification that's quickly now hard to go to son what's the action of those disciples scared they know Jesus was the truth but you see it was against the popper idea the popper religion of the hour the most victus relation sarah pharisees sadducees it was so forth their Klux Klan's and denominations they were they were against that heresy but Jesus was the identified word and Jesus is the holy ghost and spirit a little while the world saved me I'm wearing you shall see me not the body there was any God that poll in the church to call souls like he did then obedient I always do that which is pleasing to my father which one of you can cues me of seeing in other words sin is unbelief what has the word said about me that I haven't done show me what the word say that I do it I didn't do which one can accuse me which one come a your fingers only you say that I haven't fulfilled my father's word oh when the Pentecostal church gets to that spot who can accuse me if I believe Oh Christians be identified not as a hawk but an eagle that Hawk is soft he'll come down you never see eagle doing that he'll never do that he wants his own food out of the blue God's prepared him so I can see it he is fresh manna not something is dead in the Hebrews for they cross through the waters they eat try to eat dead man it had become stagnant it had it had we go tails in it you know what we need it's contaminated rotten Magus is in it why would I eat a food that have been dead years ago it might be in form and shape but it isn't fresh we got to get food every generation do so does the eagle look for that food and regeneration as we're in our journey notice now let us take some people again let's take some of the Old Testament prophets see what they did let's look first it's Stephens how Stephens in the midst of that Sanhedrin Council when that council brought him out there that create assembly of believers are supposed to be believers brought him up and tried to condemn him why he said you stiff necks uncircumcised in heart years you always resist the Holy Ghost that's that eternal life as your father's did it back get her through the prophets are you doing it today and they hashed a pony with her teeth they didn't want to hear that here's the gift sir Creed is against her denomination and they stoned the man to death he raised his hands up the torch heavens to us he heavens open and Jesus standing right side Wow he had the resurrection quickening power any that took him into the bows Jesus noticed quickly now look at Philip down there and a great revival having a revival Court have been garrison for any minute while if we had to go big cooperation amongst the churches and everything tellers having a great revival and the quickening power of God spoke to Behcet's Stevens may have said this you're having a great revival but I got one man of what she talked to and Stevens obedient no matter what it is how much criticism Oh Stevens you can't leave but I can God said so and he went out into the desert and out there he found this uni and what happened he said has if thou believest with all thine heart that Jesus is the Son of God I'll baptize him when he baptized him oh he was quickened by this quick new power to leave a revival of thousands of people to go out into the desert to one man Oh that'd be against all reasons see why these 10,000 won't you hear but there's one won't amount there see and the quickening power sit into God's providing place hallelujah man and women it'll make you stand to your feet it'll make you do the things that God wants you to do I don't care what somebody else says about the neighbors say well that person's lost her mind pray all alright they're either Bible I don't care what they say it's what God called you to do yeah that's right oh they say we can't have these ovations Pentecostal revival oh yes we can't do you can have it in yourself and you are the majority in God no matter what the rest of them think notice after in obedience this is close now after obeying God to his word when he fulfilled his mission that quickening power he received at Pentecost caught him away quick and his body miles and miles away he was taken in the spirit and was found over in another country somewhere quickening power of love and if we be Pentecostals that same power that raised up Jesus from the dead if if dwells in your mortal bodies all right Joris let's take another name of this quick new power there was a man way long ago by the name of Enoch when you think come on with something come along and say well that we have go back to the old school or this that the other Enoch walked with God whatever God said he never missed one word he walked with God what was it he was the son of God he wasn't evil and then called to that day and wouldn't come time he was so full of that quickening power if ever he walked 500 years or more before God and not one time had he missed his word not one time did he misbehave himself not one time did you but kept the testimony everything that God told he knew he wasn't done it no argument about he just wasn't done it no matter what anybody else thought he wasn't done it why he was full of that quickening power and when it comes time for the old man to die God is sitting on the ladder he walked up who he quickened him and took his mortal body up in a rapture hey that's that quickly power look at Elijah after his work was finished on earth he was so full that quickening power he condemned them Jackie Kennedy haircuts in his day he told Jezebel what he thought of her he told em preachers and priests one was right wrong and they didn't believe me but he condemned them painted face women taste so bad and he's so full of that quickly power to nothing to harm me God had been even my Hitler's stuck Enoch set him aside and he was so full of freakin power come time to die other Jordan both nothing he just walk or sit down a chair talking the who sold full of that quickening power he become a true genuine son of God notice he had a successor in his name was Elijah and Elijah had a double potion that's quick enough see he had a double potion of it now he preached for about eight years or he's got eighty years old he took sick and down now you didn't get to go home like Elijah did see both are they're in the church some Saints going some resting but notice when Elijah was taken up in the rapture then Elijah went to sleep and God pull acquit me power look at his prophecy just before he died now let me show you I don't care if you're her dad or where you're at that quickly power routines years and years after his death his meaning rotted away the skin worms did eat it up but they were packing a dead man one day Tony middleman bones that there was much quickening power that actually may come back to life again raising up from the dead because that quickening power there was a bone that sane of God never left he stayed on those bones all remember we are flesh of his flesh bone of his bones if we are his bride death won't bother that quickening power on though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God I don't want to say not a hope for an old man like me knowing I see my aunt and I understand as 56 years old you're kind of proclaim this but I know that in me nothing good that I have nothing I've done but in me is that quickening power it quickened me one day for the things of the world the eternal life all the things that's happened I've seen visions foretold things liver failure I spoke in other tongues I promise on I've done those things for the Spirit of God the talk to me that's quickly power I know that Sunday Larry neighbors living now and Sunday would he come these bones shall rise again do they fear me in the seat burn up where you ought to that quitting power is eternal I feel Easter right now yes sir I've had it for years it's in me it's in you if you the strain that raised Jesus from the dead dwells in your heart embodies its quicken you for the things of the world to the Word of God oh it's quicken you from this life - likely true you were once dead in sin and trespasses house now all being quickened together to set in play heavenly places with Christ Jesus feasting on manna from above seeing the hand of God made manifested prove the promise of this day as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man they were eating drinking married give it in married and as it was in the days of lot so will it be in the hours that the Son of Man will be revealed on earth not son of God the more son of man come back as the prophetic message for the last day when it evil will be flying not the line melt the Alex in the sacrifice age see every time a religious power went forth to meet the challenge of the political power of the world when the line raised at the religious power it went to meet the Roman power and then when it come to sacrifice our the ox went because he's a sacrifice piece to the Lord then come the Reformers down through the church ages from the face of a man and their reformers have been since Luther Wesley hall calvin own down down Pentecostal age but in the last message it went forth there come a flying eagle it's eagle time reveal time the Word of God made manifest the Word of God proved oh sure all came to this baptism of the Holy Spirit come in and believe it with all your heart God ophelia lookie here now we find now

father has given me will come to me ha the last oh my Easter while we're right in Easter when he raised we raise with him he sent the abstract that we hold it as the baptism of the Holy Ghost he is alive forevermore the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13:8 proves that he's the same hismus psyche undaunted once believed in what is a messiah what is the Messiah Messiah is Anointed One and now if he was the Messiah being the Anointed One or that day to fulfill the Word of God to be the Redeemer in the Anointed One and God raised up [Music] [Music] [Music] for the promise one more time on Jordans for Kanan and I am bound for the promise [Applause] [Music] this aim company is happy to be in church this morning praise the Lord happy Easter Happy Easter I'm glad to be able to have church on Easter and I just want to mention that I try to sing songs that we all know and that we all have heard before so I trust I trust you all into these songs if not I apologize and you can always go on google and type in the names of the songs and they'll bring the lyrics up on Google and then you could sing along sing along as well as I said I try to try sing ones we know I like the one we're just saying I was listening to a tape the other day and brother branham was uh was singing this song and I remember he's saying it quite a bit and it uh it encouraged me because even not even just regarding this this time that we're in now but just in everyday life all the time Satan will just try to discourage us and when brother Bram started singing this song I just I was encouraged cuz despite what goes on you know we're bound for the promised land and we keep our eyes on the prize like that story brother branham told of the the boy riding the bike they asked how he made it across the law and how he made it across the board without falling off and he said he kept his eyes on the end and he just rode straight and if we could just do that we'll stay encouraged and we'll stay blessed every day despite what Satan throws our way so anyway let's I just wanted to read a scripture here with it being Easter morning this is John 11 chapter 25 it says Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us now this I'm so grateful for the sacrifice of the Lord it's just uh powerheads this morning as and as I always do I'll just invite you all to pray with me pray along with me but we'll just open up in prayer this morning Lord we love you and thank you for everything that you do there we thank you for the your sacrifice stored on the cross though we want to remember it this morning Easter morning Lord we want to remember the price that you paid Lord for our sins Lord we know back in in the Bible Time Lord when somebody was to commit a sin they would have to sacrifice an innocent and lamb in their place Lord but until your son came until you came in the flesh Lord and you gave your heart you gave your soul you gave your your everything Lord and you paid the price on that cross Lord so that we could have our sins paid for Lord an innocent sacrifice thorn we just want to thank you for that and back in the old time when they could when they kill the lamb in the place of their sin Lord it would it would take the sin away Lord but the it wouldn't be forgotten Lord but your sacrifice that you gave Lord not only took the sin away Lord but you put it in the sea of forgetfulness Lord he forgot you forgot about it Lord you justified us Lord there and we know we're unworthy Lord but because you deemed us worthy Lord you chose us and we just want to thank you for that Lord we love you Lord we appreciate you with all our hearts Lord may we not disgrace your sacrifice though we know that as your prophet said there's no longer sin anymore because you paid the price of sin on the cross Lord now it's unbelief Lord and we see ourselves Lord if we can believe on the sacrifice that you made Lord and apply it to our lives Lord we know that there is grace for us there's mercy for us with so many times Lord when we go back to sinful things Lord we just throw that sacrifice out Lord we ignore it because truly if we believed in it Lord we wouldn't do those things but Lord we just ask that you forgive us for our unbelief floor because that's what it is just like that man that received a pardon a pardon and brother Brandon told the story and and even though he had the pardon he didn't accept it as a pardon Lord and I believe it's similar to your sacrifice Lord you paid the price for our sin Lord but we still have to accept it and we have to apply it to our lives Lord forgive us for our unbelief Lord forgive us for where we struggle Lord and grow cold Lord it's not our desire but our desire in our heart is to live strong Lord lord I pray that you just touched us this morning Lord be in this service we pray Lord we love you and thank you for all things jesus name amen amen brother Mikey a couple announcements in praise Lord Church just wanted to make a few announcements first I wanted to just announce to the church that were streaming from a new location this morning last week where they was kind enough to open up his home to us but brother Paul has made an offer to us to use the fellowship hall and word of truth assembly here in Newton North Carolina and so so we're going to probably be using this as our home base at least for this time until God opens an opportunity for us to assemble together again at some location or the rapture comes first whichever takes place but but for the time being while we're doing streaming services we're gonna probably continue to use this location so I just want you to be being prayer for that and also be praying to bless brother Paul Stewart for his kindness to offers this location because it seems like it's gonna provide a good space and a good location for us to do that secondly I wanted to say that we're using a different platform this morning we're actually using YouTube live and this is a part of our effort to to streaming services we started out with GoToMeeting and there were some good things about us some things that weren't working so well but we're gonna try a different platform hopefully bringing a better streaming experience for the saints who are watching at home and and also we want to make the comment that we are new to this we do have some talented people brother Natan brother David who who have a lot more knowledge about these things and I do that's how we're able to get going this morning but if anybody has any advice any knowledge in these areas something that you can offer just feel free to contact one of the brothers and just let us know if there's anything that you could add to - in terms of knowledge that would improve this process and also in the past we go to meeting it was understand an opportunity to chat to comment and place things up understand that there was times people were saying a man is some kind of things about the message which we certainly appreciate that but but also there's a a chat option on YouTube live but I think if I understand correctly you have to sign in using a gmail account in order to use that feature so for those of you who are screaming if you do want to continue to post chats and things won't model messages being streamed that others might be able to see and benefit from just notice you got to go to Gmail assign and in order to be able to to do that and so so with that being said let's see if there's anything else that I need to cover at this time seems like I was missing one more thing if it comes back to me when I come back out to preach Minister will we'll address it at a time somebody was one more thing I can't think of it right top of my head but anyway I wanted to share those comments or remarks before we continue with a service and and so again I appreciate everybody for joining us happy Easter morning to you and god bless you back to my label [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and he [Applause] but yes thank you for for its glory mates in the heaven shine Church I was you missing it one more time oh yes he knew for it was he is glory makes in the heavens shine we were so [Music] [Music] I'm grateful for that thank you though he chose us

[Music] girls trampled on the ground [Music] and she took the fall and thought of us church that's that's powerful to think that when he when he was on the cross we were on his mind thank you seated on the throne [Music] with many Krauts Jesus under thee [Music] with many crowns [Music] [Music] [Music] because [Music] I should sing that again as brother Mike [Music] [Applause] just because Amen as a sound amen it's coming through do it okay amen praise the Lord Churchill praise the Lord again just bear with us we we're time just making sure tended everything is working correctly amen again appreciate brother Abel's help with us on the song service again this morning as well brother Brian and brother Maurice on the instruments amen and we've got about got about nine president congregation so I think we're under the state legal requirements amen trying to do our best with that as well but I'm not gonna prolong the time again I appreciate everybody I said with join us streaming and and this one again to wish you a happy Resurrection morning amen because the resurrection is really the chief Cornerstone of what this is all about brother Branham said it wasn't so much that he died for us and was so much that he was born of a virgin he said there were many nights babies born he said there were many good men that died he said but what made the difference was never had a man resurrected and sort of Resurrection morn is what makes this even that much more special for us but I'm not gonna prolong the time if you have your Bibles I fight to determine the book of Romans chapter 4 the book of Romans chapter 4 and we're going to look at verse 17 Romans 4:17 and I'll set this over here get that out of my way and before we read his word we're gonna bow for a word of Prayer dear Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your grace thank you for what you've done for us but thank you for the life your death and Lord in your resurrection and Lord that resurrection means so much to us and Lord even now we're even hunger in Lord for a greater experience of that resurrection lord help us to put aside our thoughts to put aside our our worries bears we're mortals in this life things that are too that's not a sin Oh Lord it would be a sin if we never let those things that concern us become so great in our lives Lord that they shadow over the word we don't want that this morning the Lord the word is shining in this hour may it shine in our hearts may it bring forth life an expression of what you desired to do in this Iowa law justice service help us to relax here help those that are streaming Lord to put aside the manner of household things that might be around them that we're trying to distract may we all concentrate on your presence and may your presence come down in the homes as well as it does here and it's in this building today and God may you give us a revelation that become so real to our heart Lord made even quicken our mortal bodies Lord we thank you and we extra grace and all things and Jesus Christ name Amen amen if you have your Bibles I'm invite to return me to the book of Romans chapter 4 Romans chapter 4 and we're gonna look at verse 17 Romans 4:17 and and it reads this it says as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and called it those things which be not as though they were portents hope believed in hope talking about Abraham now who against hope believed in hope that he had become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall deceive be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he's taken out the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he promised not like this whatever God promised Abraham was persuaded that he was also able to perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness and I was not rooting for his sake alone that it was imputed to him in other words it was able to impute something to that man the scripture is saying Paul is saying is he's not the only man that can be the benefit of this same righteousness if God could imputed to him under the law under bulls and goats I should say how much more could he imputed unto us under the blood of Christ he said it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed but it but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses that's Calvary and was raised again for our justification that was that Easter morning let's bow our heads once again Heavenly Father we thank you for the reading of your work and Lord out of sex that she would take this time use the gift that you placed within me speak to your church help us Lord for we need you this morning in Jesus Christ's name we accident amen amen may be seated amen we'll see you at home again greet you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I like to this morning continue on where we left off last week with the message God's great achievement McCall is part two all still in the same series that we've been dealing in Norfolk route of Christ a mystery but this morning we want to take a little bit different angle and we want a background of course what we preached last week before we get into this morning service but we actually want to deal with it this morning in the way of the resurrection and in our scripture reading it says and being now we can faith this is from verse 19 chapter 4 verse 19 Paul writes here he Abraham Sitter not his own body now dead but is about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb it says he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but strong and faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded what he had promised what God had promised he God was able also to perform and therefore it was imputed unto him for righteousness so Abraham's faith in God's Word actually was counted to him or imputed to him for righteousness verse 23 says now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed I love this it's a promise it shall being period a bit of them said as a condition of this it says if we believe on Him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead so all we need to have is impute the same faith that Abraham had that was to believe what God promised him if you and I could believe what God promised us the same righteousness and there was imputed Abraham that same right season again for our justification how was that body raised look at Acts chapter 4 verse 10 scripture says being known until oh listen to you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom he crucified because of those Jews whom God raised from the dead so Christ the man headed for the dead that's the power that God is using to raise this body here in time now once you watch this so that body was raised by the power of God so today I want to talk about God's achievement because as holy as that body was as anointed that that body was as righteous that Jesus Christ was it still took God to raise that body so you and I will not achieve our goal by our righteousness we won't by our works it's going to take the grace of God and the power of God to confirm his power to raise this body as the word is promised for this day it won't be our achievement no more than Christ's success was his achievement his achievement was by the father operating inside the Sun and our team is gonna be about Christ operating inside the Brian I want you to watch this I want you to watch this last week we described how it was actually God's achievement and it was and we described what an achievement actually was an achievement as we described last week it was to successfully execute a goal a predetermined goal or objective that has been successfully fulfilled and last week we used the example of a man designed to be a millionaire and we said the bid be a million that was the desire that the man would have but even though he desired to be a millionaire I said if he would actually stumble into the money perhaps maybe about inheritance for my rich relative you didn't know about or maybe he might actually be in some type of accident or something and there was some predetermined goal and a plan to that goal first and to successfully execute the plan would define achievement but now the man might be blessed if somebody left him a million dollars or he got it by insurance or have you got it it might not be an achievement he might like it he got the money that's good but in order for it to be an achievement we've got to recognize there's got to be a goal established first and then when a person can successfully achieved the goal of their established then you can declare that to be an achievement and so we want to talk about God's achieving because God actually had a goal in mind before the foundation of the world and in order for to be God's great achievement God has to successfully by his own power by his own ability accomplish that goal so I wanted us look at the little things here God's achievement God had a goal and if God had a goal he had a vision and the vision was before the foundation of the world as we recognized by the message of the hour so what exactly was God's goal if we can see what God's goal was then we can evaluate what he has done and then we can determine whether or not he was successful in his achievement if you can see the goal and then you can see the results that you could say whether or not he was successful first of all God's goal or Bible tells us was a mystery and I say it with mystery because there was something that was hidden from the foundation of world but we recognize for the rest of the that it was revealed or promised to be revealed the last days in the seven seals brother Bentham says distant Christ of mystery God revealed about this about this achievement or his goal that God had in Christ of mystery brother BAM says this now God's great mystery he had before the world began how back in the back part of God's mind there was something listening that he was trying and going to achieve that's why I call this God's grace achievement because whatever to goal was did God had in a back part of his mind brother BEM said not only was he gonna try to he said but being God he can call those things that are not as though they were God had promised by his word I'm not gonna just try to achieve this goal thus saith the Lord I shall achieve this goal but we had to first recognize what that goal was and the secret was not going to be something that God was going to achieve what a man was gonna achieve or the church was gonna achieve but it was something that God was going to achieve and brother Branham said God had to started to do it because he said he knew knowing man and on all things beginning man is not capable ramsett of keeping a covenant he said so in order for God to achieve this goal he had to make the covenant unconditional it's not based upon what you do our revelation has to come quickened that our success is based upon what he's done and if we can see our success based upon his works then it takes the fear out of it because even in our failures we recognize God allows it for a purpose but he's still going to be glorified in the end because his promise that would be so God the Bible said he had a motive in doing it in other words he had a reason behind his goal and his motive was in order to let himself be expressed as so as we measure gaza achievement we had to measure on a basis of the reveal where the hour and a reveal say it were said his achievement was going to be in order that he might be expressed so his achievement would be the expression of himself now watching brother BAM says continue on Christ of mystery but a bam says the entire Bible is an expression of one goal had one purpose that he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible and all the acts of the believers in the Bible listen brother BAM says has been in tight so he said even though the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had brother Brown said these expressions that we see in the Old Testament in particular in many places in the Bible for the best that they have been in type listen and expressing what God's goal is so we read the Old Testament we see all these types of see all these shadows and yes they express God David express God Moses express God am Express God nature Express God we see God expressed in so many ways but brother BAM said these expressions were types of expressing what God's great goal really is so in his last day we have to be able to catch the real revelation not just the types but what was the fame behind the type that God really was after I want you to watch this and so with God in all things even the earth he created him for a purpose because express himself Christ misra God revealed but a bam says and all the accident believers in Harbor listen has been type expressing with God's holy us but now in this last day he has revealed it and he shows it so in our generation not only has God had this miss for his mind of what his ultimate goal he was trying to achieve was he had types but in this day he's not trying to express her type he's trying to express the fullness of what he had in a back part of his mind and it was revealed in the seals but I want you to watch this the seals actually had a two-fold manner to it in this sense even though the seals have been revealed revelation has a two-fold magnitude and it was just like Abraham when a Bible says Abraham was justified by faith that justification the Bible express had a two-fold manner to it brother branham priest of message one time call works is faith expressed and he said that Abraham he said Paul talked about Abraham being justified by faith but then he also said James looked at a James and they valid ID in the scriptures but it wasn't a battle between two men in that day it was actually two men having the same revelation from God but one talked about what God saw in Abraham and one talk about what man had an X on Abraham so even though God had revealed his word by the letter or by the spoken word to Abraham and when abraham believed it god saw his heart and imputed righteousness to him and said Abraham that you're justified by your faith yet death probable that same Bible said he was justified by believing in Romans chapter 4 that same Bible in Genesis 22 said that same God come down again and said Abraham now you're justified by your works and that's what James was preaching James and preaching however have acted at the garden about what he believed and with the overseers yes there's a revelation that comes by the open of the word but that's just part of the revelation we also now have to step into the manifestation with the reveal and that brings the revelation it's a full maturity not just a preaching of it but when there's a man that to believe it and act on what's been preached so I'll mention that the hour came to the opening of the word yes it's been open to us but now there's got to be a people like Abraham that can receive what's been open and actually act on what God has revealed and Abraham did it alone it wasn't savers job the ecto-1 abraham believed it wasn't the philistines job deck whatever him leave it was Abraham's job to act on what God had revealed to them and if we're a part of this message as individuals it's our job to act though what is God revealing to you now I want you to watch this twofold manner first the word is revealed by faith but then that faith has to move into a realm where it can manifest itself it works the same faith was expressed in the heart and there was expressed to the heart has been expressed expressed in the body in the actions so the second part we saw was God manifested and sort of misrata seals had the same two full manifestation first the opening of the revelation we heard it preached and we could say amen to that but now we're moving into a different season it's not just what's been preached it's what now is being made manifest now once you watch this like we said last week I was a fifty five God said that I'll not allow my word to return to me vol God will send that word to the earth by somebody but then there's got to be somebody to receive that what's been sent or you follow me now let me keep moving for fourth so God's great goal was to express himself and brother banister all the believers in the Bible has been in Tights Adam was a type he spreads God Abraham was a type he's pressed God wasn't was a type he's Prince God David was a type he expressed God or you follow me all these wood types but they only represented shadows of a greater one to come all were expressions but all were types of shadows but there was one that was coming that wasn't going to be a type of shadow see these types of shadows were only sign they were pointing to something else to come it's kind of like a brochure you know I'm not want to travel a whole lot you know people that travel a lot of exotic places and usually ones that maybe do a little bit not do financially but but I wouldn't mind sometime maybe traveling but you know you see some of these travel brochures and and and I've looked at these things that people have these timeshares and whatnot and they give you a book in it they say you know anywhere in the world you just flip the book and you can look at a Jamaica and you can look at the blue waters down in the Bahamas and then maybe you can look at the Niagara Falls and you can with all these places to go and the pictures are beautiful you're not betting the Grand Canyon and I've always seen picture of the Grand Canyon is a little child I said if I ever get a chance I want to go to Grand Canyon what about eight years ago I had a chance to go out to Arizona it's been several days and I was in Flagstaff and I said I found out Flagstaff was an hour-and-a-half drive from the Grand Canyon's I said I'm not getting this close without going to the Grand Canyon so I booked the extra day of my trip so that I took care of fishing business we were able to go out there and rather the Grand Canyon now I want to say this all these pictures were types the picture said this is what the Grand Canyon looked like I said wow look at the beautiful skies and look at the layers of colors in those rocks I said wow that's beautiful I want to go to the Grand Canyon and I got to the Grand Canyon out Halos pictures if he wanted to put him aside those photographs were types they represented the Grand Canyon but the Grand Canyon was so much greater than could ever be put in the photograph and that's the way God is God manifested himself in the old testament and types but when the real thing came in Jesus Christ who was not a type he was the fullness that with all those types represented he was so much greater David couldn't stand beside him John couldn't stand beside him Moses could have stammers how to rap he was so much greater and God's expression his full expression it's so much greater than any type and I want you to watch this so God wanted to express himself but a ma'am said express himself and types throughout the Bible he said but there was something greater that God wanted to express even greater than the types we could look at all those great men and all those great heroes what we call the faith but they were not the fullness of really what God had in his heart if you look at the matter of the book of Hebrews chapter on verse three you have to turn never read it to you real quick just to save time and Hebrews 1:1 it says God who in syndra times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the father's by the prophets now I want you to watch this it was God and the prophet speaking so those prophets were actually expressing God they were types but they were literally expressing attributes of God there was a king like him Abraham was a father like him are you follow me all these had types that they could express because it was God in them but it still was only a type now I want you watch this verse 2 and it says in and has entire and it has in his last days spoken to us not by the prophets but by his son whom he has appointed to be heir of all things there was no son or no property Old Testament that was a point of be the heir all things are you follow me there was only one that was appointed be there all things and that was when the anti-type come and that was Jesus Christ I would get a little ahead of myself even though they were wonderful anointed man and they were typed they were not appointed to be heirs but the Bride of Christ she is not a type she is the Ana type just like her Lord and she has been appointed in the world to come to be heir of all things I want you to watch this whom we apart of me err all things but whom also he made the world's who being in the brightness of his glory listen and Christ was the Express image of his person when you saw Christ you saw God not in part but all that God was was being expressed inside of that body are you follow me that's what Christ was so at the end of the Old Testament there was a climax of God's expression no more types but the fullness of what God was was walking on two feet upon the earth that's what was taking place in Christ not types any more like nature and moons and stars that could express them in the profits that could express them but one person one body in which God could express himself in his fullness now back in the message Christ a mystery God revealed but the brand it begins to bring this expression down in a real clear form now once you watch out a prophet words this he says therefore if any Trinitarian would just let yourself loose for a minute you can see that Father Son and the Holy Ghost is not three gods it's three attributes of the same God see its expression so when God said he wanted to express himself God desired to express himself his fullness and in the Fatherhood we find God express himself as a pillar of fire as a low cost and that logos was not God in part but it was God in his fullness and that was the first attribute of the Godhead and then we saw that that same Godhead was not a different person but now comes down as the Sun as a different attribute which means a different manifestation expressing the same person but the brother said it was like a man on a stage changing the mass he was one character but every time you went behind the scenes when he came back out he had a different mass but it was the same person and he said the trend of terrorists couldn't catch that so every time God changed his expression they thought it had to be a different person but brother Brown said it was not a different person it was the same person only changing his expression or the form of his expression and once you watch this he said its three attributes of the same God see its expression father he was though he wanted to be a father he was a father he was a son remem said and he is the Holy Ghost and the father a Holy Ghost is the same spirit don't you see don't you get it he said not three gods the devil has told you them things that try to make an idolatry out of you see it's one God expressed in three attributes so the father was the fullness of God the son was the fullness of God and when we use that title Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the same as the father so he has to be also the fullness of God and so when God put the Holy Ghost in the church what came down into the church it was God and his greatness coming down into his people with the promise that one day I will Stephanies people not in part but in my fullness of my glory that's the promise to the church and it's a promise for the endtime people now I want to take my time with this I want you to watch this so it was God revealed in the father the first attribute the fullness of God God revealed in the Sun and man still the second attribute but still the fullness of God and now God revealed the day in the Holy Ghost living in the people not less than God but still the fullness of God in the form of the Holy Ghost not in part but bringing God into perfection three expressions of the same person you see this hard for the the nominal church just except that the same as it was for the Jews to accept when Christ said I and the father was one they said we can accept you as a prophet we can accept you as a man with the healing ministry we can accept all these things I said before he said not for the works we don't stole you for that but for expressing a revelation that you and God are one that's more than our churches can handle and in his day is the same thing of the Gentiles when you really begin to get down to a God has accomplished and in the bride in his hour is hard for the nominal church world to accept that I want you to watch this so in the second person Christ the fullness of the godhead now in the last days in the bride he wants to express listen the same thing my brother BAM said Christ mr. got revealed I want to coast just a little bit so that even the people listen on the tape would get the idea he said that can see he said it would take me around the clock just with one of these subjects but I hope I'm making the clear enough that you can see what I'm coming to he said God expressed in Christ listen who was both Father Son and Holy Ghost the fullness of the Godhead bodily what he's trying to say when you got God in his fullness you've got the fullness of the Godhead or you follow me so in Christ he's not a second person he's a man with the fullness of one person living in him he said now the complete fullness of the Godhead bodily dwell in his church so that same father son Holy Ghost that manifested in Christ one God three attributes he said the same God is now I moved to the church I want to take my time with this he said God dwells in the full complete fullness of the Godhead bodily dwell in his church their preeminence 'as you said her brother Mike if he dwells in a church why are we not seeing the force express because then order to express his fullness he's got to have somebody that surrenders in there bonus reminisce mean there's nothing higher than that we had preached on this a couple weeks ago up in Conover and was showing that preeminence was a position and the position of preeminence is when Christ becomes the head when Christ becomes the head of a person's life not just something that new on Sundays not just something to do a couple of times a week but when everything your life centers around that one person how you talk how you act how you live how you fellowship how you conduct yourself with other people when your life centers around that and brother Malik said Christ become the center of all of your life then he has preeminence now he is the head because he's a center of all you say doing think the corners are message of the hour now wants to watch this that's preeminence all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was is poured into the believers and we'll see that in manifestation once Christ has the preeminence in this body called the bride I want you to watch this now by launches we can do works but anointed Judas did works that's why by anointings we find a Baptist God healings we've got healings by anointing that raise the dead about knowing sin we raise the dead but I'm not talking about anointings in that fashion because the prophets had the anointings to raise dead but I'm talking about moving beyond just a type or expression I'm talking about the fullness of what that expression means that God himself now once you watch this so now what all this brother might you say you had an Easter message what does always have to do with Easter Easter represented God's achievement as I said it wasn't Christ that raised himself from the dead but the Bible said that the God that raised Jesus from the dead so God created a body God feel the body and then God raised the body and the bride is no different God has created the body God has filled that body and in his last days God has resurrected that body and that's what I want to focus on this morning I want to talk about how God has been expressed in a meeting in my body and how God has resurrected that body I want you to watch this for the message of rises on the Sun but the brem says not today we have it tuberculosis listen an Easter seal people who sends a message out to one another and support this great fun or drive for the doctors medical science to work upon something to or to help the tuberculosis they are they are sealed he said what we call an Easter seal he said when we send message one to another he said but when we received the message now listen to the Prophet he's talking in tights but I want you to catch what he says but when we received the message he said the seal is broken because the seal has got a message a message bound on the inside so in every age God has broken a seal why because every age brother brems had had a seal because behind the seal was the message for that age and when God broke the seal the message of free age caught the message of the revelation and took it to the people but once the seal has been broken it releases whatever the mystery was or the message behind that seal if I were to send you will see a brother David I said you will see a brother Abel I might say something different but they haven't been able I appreciate your song service I might say brother David I appreciate your help on the equipment and yet both of them are still there the same envelope they look the same the sealing outsides are saying but the message is based upon the one that is directed to and when that person opens that seal he sees what was on my heart regarding him and what was on God Horsell garden in stage it's greater than what's on God heart regarding your age and God has broken the seventh seal mystery to you and I and I job is to take that she'll let when God has opened that seal and see what the message was he had on the other side and then like Abraham would have believed that message but I want you to watch this brem says it now the true Easter seal he said on this sunrise was broken he's speaking of two thousand years ago after Calvary and the secret listen the secret of life after death was revealed before that time we didn't know now I want you to compare what happened 2,000 years ago to what's happening now the mystery of God according to revelations 10 7 listen has been revealed and it reveals something that prior to that still being broken we did not know and brother Brandon said me and had often wondered even Jobe said what happens to a man had to die shall he be like a tree shall he live again Joe being a prophet by being a prophet it was sealed a mystery like of the death but brother after the resurrection it was no more mystery we saw how a man can live just like you live but man can walk just like you walk a man can eat just like you and I eat and that man could actually die like every other man ain't going a grave but three days later that makes I walk out again that it never happened through the history of the Bible they had been body changes they have been resurrections in terms of a man falling down and getting up but never a man going in there and be in the three days and coming back out alive again like he did you said brother Mike you said Lazarus came up again I said last word back down that was not the same kind of death those that had raised before that from the dead every one of them had to go back to the grind to death they come out of well Jesus Christ had a different resurrection he said I live and I shall never die anymore it was a different kind of resurrection it showed that a man that had lived had conquered death him the grave and the power same to the brow said stains trinitario powers had no longer hole upon him and the bride is going to experience that while she's alive or two feet walking her she's gonna have a quick attendees that's gonna have a victory over Satan and that's will have no power over Satan will have no hold on her but she's gotta believe the message now behind that seal that said you are the people and you are in that age are you follow me but we can hear this message and we can save and we believe certain things about it but brother Bama said I don't think we had the sincerity about what we're confessing we haven't come to the revelation of it actually what God has revealed and has accomplished in his age you said accomplish brother Mike what was the brother branham oh he was the example of what a man redeemed in Christ can look like I want to hold it you say was a prophet he sure was he was a son of man - on a man in ministry but people get mixed up and adopted son versus a son of man some of his anointing was son of man some of his anointing was a doctor son and people get those two things mixed up I'm not trying to be a son of man but the seals have a real to me I'm living to age and what is my expectation to be an adopted son and anything shorter in the same shows I haven't come to the revelation of what was sealed behind that message that was the message this is the age of the adoption I want to keep going you said brother Michael Thor was in Asia rapture the rapture is the manifesto of that adopted body because if you look at Romans 8 is said that the sons of God that should be manifested say I received the redemption of their mortal bodies that's a body change or you follow me the sons of God his age we're looking for a body change let me keep reading program said the secret of life and death was revealed before that time we didn't know the world group groped in darkness he says group around me and suspicion listen theories that was amongst man's heart traditions made up now I want you to catch the prophets in here they knew that there were God but they had ideas of their own in terms of who he was and what was his mystery they couldn't catch his mystery was expression and I want to say this that expression was God wanted to express himself even in the message I find that that thought is still a mystery God doesn't want you brother Brian to express him you can't God doesn't want brother Mike to express him I cannot there's only one that can express God and that's where the brem said when he interprets his word and brother Bram said no man has the right to interpret his word is subject to no private interpretation he said God is his own interpreter so if God's gonna express himself in brother Mike there's only one way this mystery can happen is God has to step into brother Mike and then God has to express himself in brother Mike or you follow me and under the seal it just told us and particularly how God wants to express himself in brother Mike are you following I want you to keep going he said and said they had theories in their heart traditions made of man worship idols they worship the Sun they worship all kinds of God he said all kinds of people that made claims he said they all went into the grave and they stayed in the grave Muhammad said he's gonna resurrect the live and never died no more and they've been waiting over a thousand years and he's still changing horses wait for word happy didn't take Christ that long Christ said in less than three days our res again why because the Bible said in David said that he'll not suffer his Holy One to see corruption and but I'm said corruption sets in and said in 2 hours it didn't take him three days to confirm his word he made the promise and unless the three days God confirmed the man was true in what he said and the show did that other person's false there's stay away for a resurrection and it hadn't come yet and it won't happen until our third millennium is over and there's a great resurrection and he arises to be judged as a liar for claiming he was something that he was not but brother Graham said Christ was different he made a claim of who he was and he proved who he was and the Brian and his resurrection we've been making a claim that we're at different people we've been making a claim that our message is different now it's time for the bride to change her season and she has to express or manifest what she's claimed to be I want you to watch this but the Bremen says the real steel had been broken and the one who once lived as we lived died as we will die was risen from the dead he said water morning never one like it never a morning like as you follow me in that history of the world he said secret was made known that he was both action now listen he had proven Lazarus he was the resurrection but now he's proved he's the life brother Brahim said he had proved he was a resurrection but now he proved his resurrection and life now I want you to get this what do you mean life for the my car he was a life without in that death could not hold Moses was a life those trees that they got life he was a different life he was little a man expressing the life of God what'd he get Ember the mic the mystery behind the seal was that God was able to express himself in man not in types but the person himself and what is the message the hour came to bring us back to that original revelation Paul preaches no longer I that liveth listen to me Christ in me we can't change our bodies we can be kind to our brother psychology can teach you that we can learn to go to church on Sundays and pay our tithe tradition can teach you that we can even learn their brother Brennan's of Prophet scripture can explain that that's none of that is expression are you follow me but the mystery of the Resurrection showed that a man that said that he was God in flesh I come from God listen Church I go back to God and he did it a man that could say destroy this temple and in three days I'll raise it up again he didn't just make the promise he did it I want you to catch this the same man that made those promises and did it said as I live listen he made another promise you shall live also if he lived by an endless life and that endless life was able to express God in the way they did he said I'm making another promise it's not up to you to achieve it you didn't make the promise I'm making the promise and if I could back up that promise does it not have the power to back up that promise you see Abraham when he heard God's promise even when his body was dead he didn't say well maybe I misunderstood maybe I don't have the real understand the revelation of what he meant he looked at the promise and said he would not have said it to me if he couldn't do it that's how we had to see the message this message would not have been preached to you this message God would not have preached it to me this message God would not have sent it to this world if he didn't have every intention to achieve what he preached not in some phones in every phone not one letter not one word not one iota can pass away until God has achieved everything that he preached and that was the faith of Abraham and the Bible said that we must had to fade the Abraham and that was the mind of Christ when brother Branham said he wasn't a great he had one scripture thou should not suffer that hold of RC corruption he said he knew that God had to achieve a resurrection because he may have promised and he said we've got more than one scripture we got a retired head of a Bible that points to this last day to stand up and say God you promised and we're the age and we're the people and Lord I'm expecting you to fulfill that promise are you seeing where we're standing we're the seeds of Abraham with the truth of Abraham by a new birth in Jesus Christ and that same faith by a new birth where the brother said pushing you to faith Abraham had it puts on you the faith of Christ had pushing you the faith that God had when God said let there be he didn't doubt for one minute what was going to happen I want you to watch I'm gonna close you in a minute but I'm trying to show you something Christ's resurrection what it represented to you and I it showed that there was an endless life that once dwelt in flesh and that same in his life God promised that he was going to give to another people and our job is not to be two believers look as a message that makes us a theologian that makes us nozzle about the word but God didn't call us to be a theologian but he did call you to know what you believe we should understand why we believe this message that's why we move when things begin to shake laughs something in you said Lord I can't let this message go I got to keep moving why something he was yearning for the expression of that resurrection the disciples expressed healing they expressed preachers but out of their Pentecost they express the resurrection you see a resurrection Jesus Christ that I have made you witnesses what does it mean I made you witnesses not just go back and tell me what I did when you walk with me three and a half years he said but I rose again and you had to be a witness a witness means you have your old testimony of the facts nobody had to tell me I've got my old testimony of what took place and I was not there in this body 2,000 years ago but brother brown said I was there is dead body 2000 years ago and when that body rolls where the family said I rose with it and when it died I got with it and so therefore I can't be judged of our sins but able because I was judged in that body and that's got to be a personal revelation and so when that body rose if that body listen church is dead body was justified and it's raising even with all the sins of the world dumped on it my sins your sins if God by the resurrection to make that body so white that it can stand in a white throne judgment and judge every sinner because he was kind of righteousness and if I died with that body brother Brian and I resurrected with that body gets this when I stand to the right throne judgment I'll stand in the same righteous wife because the Bible said what he was was imputed unto me I didn't earn it I just believed by the message that is my rights by divine inheritance and in a mystery our brother Graham said instead an inalienable right which means of God promised it to you sister nothing can take it away not even yourself shall I believe him to God no way yeah because God made the promise and it's his promise he's protecting natural righteousness for Sailor mr. and Abraham mister why did God accept him anyway it wasn't those people he was protected it was a promise he made to a man and God promised Christ he's gonna give him a bride and before the finest world brother Brian God promised you he will give you a new body and then some promise he's protecting but do we actually believe in the promise then if we do live for the promise how do those disciples believed the promise they stayed in the up room - they got it their actions showed they were expecting something to take place what I'm afraid of sometimes looking on a message I look at lots of people the David I wonder what to expect I'm watching lives how they're acting and I'm saying what are you expecting I'm watching my life what am I expecting if I see that the prompt the promise was that before the going home the bride Christ will come back according to second Thessalonians chapter one Christ will come back to be glorified in his Saints but the Bremen said not in part but he steps out of heaven in the fullness of his glory to be manifested in his fullness I've got a message I'm working on that his fullness was not just faith that's an attribute of divine nature not just patience that's the attribute of divine nature not just temperance and godliness or in brotherly kindness those are attributes of divine nature but our age is supposed to express a capstone the capstone is love and love is God himself all the love that God had in him was manifested in Christ when he died for the sins of the world and all the love of God that was in Christ it's not only made manifest in us I'm not looking to manifest part of his divine nature I'm looking for God in the fullness of a divine nature or you follow me because I see what was open behind that seal in God said brother Mike this is what I'm calling you to and I see right away I don't have the ability but his mortal flesh and blood to get there Abraham with his body and said my buddy's dead well guess what our bodies a day but the Bram said God didn't redeem or when you received the Holy Spirit your body was not redeemed your soul was redeem this body still dead Paul said I wrestled with this body or if Richard man that I am but I and this age have a confidence the same promise that said he can change my nature said he can also change my body and I'm looking for my nature to match that capstone of love and by the that nature that power will also quicken this mortal body let me get on because I'm taking too long let me get on turn it a little bit occurs if you have your Bibles Leviticus 23 I'm gonna hit a couple things I don't let you go I'm just trying to show us Church what was the significance of that resurrection and what the denominations to loss Paul when he preached to the Galatians when Paul preached to the Corinthians and Paul preaches you know other churches he hid this fact Paul total Galatians that they actually were preaching a different gospel God told the Corinthians they were preaching different Christ or you follow me what was he trying to say he was trying to say the original revelation of the church was revealed on the day of Pentecost and when you see how that Holy Ghost operated in that church there was a book of Acts written behind it so Paul was trying to tell them the churches you're still calling on the name but you're not living the life that the name represents so that made them preach the different not be an imitation of Christ my life would not be an imitation of Christ our lives will not be Laozi what we believe but our life would be that same life that resurrected again in you and modern-day witnesses that that resurrection happened 2,000 years ago brother BAM said how by approving a new resurrection in his day this is where I want to close our life has to be to be translated in the bride before we leave to be like email to fulfill the type we have to have a testimony Enoch had a testimony that he pleased God how by expressing God to that generation and before we have a body changed we've got to have the testimony left behind that in this generation what did God do in your life went into a mind he expressed himself in you in this generation and in order to know if he's achieved that you got to know what that expression is and as much as I love this message it's more than saying I believe this message and that's what both of my hungers for you said but my own healing I've had him my ministry a number of them you know had to go around to everybody what they are but you pray for people people get healed last time we were up and I believe it was Virginia we had a service and they were sitting office time before that I'm sorry wasn't last month was month before that there was seven people came up we have prayer form morning service same prayer pray for one pray for each one of them in game the same promise same prayer st. promise but one of the sisters that came up we had prayer where she came back to me at the service and said when I got back to my seat God had already healed me of what I came up a prayerful because it was something of pain she could feel in my body or you follow me now why didn't everyone of them come back you see Scripture how you follow me but she came back and she said thank you for praying for me when I don't take no credit for that I'm just an instrument like all your to do the same thing but the point I'm making is this healings is not what I'm asked to do I love to see more healings preaching I'm not there's many of my there that I wouldn't want to preach after their preachers but preaching is not what I'm after those things are expressions but that's not expression I'm after after the expression that the word has promised for my age and when I look at brother Mike compared to that I don't want to lower that level I want to keep it right with God placed it and let my face at God and move me up move me up move me up or you follow me now I want you to watch this and we get ready to close Leviticus 23 verse 9 but I barely use this in the message of rising the Sun and it says and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when ye be coming to the land which I give unto you and shall reap the harvest thereof then ye shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest unto the priest now of course he's talking about harvest time but partner if interrupting the scripture reading but God brought a thought back to me to get him in this moment and I just want to share it why someone thing he shared it to people let the church on the screaming to forgive me if ignoring the camera I got faces he looking at me God spoke about I believe it was him I believe it was him this morning he said God and you does not make him weaker if I were to take water and pour it in Pepsi Cola oh I take the cue me Pepsi Cola and pour it in the water that's a better example Pepsi gets weaker in the water becomes one but the water dilutes the effect of the Pepsi or whatever so do you pour in it but God's not so God's power is greater than you or I when God pours his power into a man's heart he doesn't dilute his power by mixing with the man the man has to die in order that God might be greater so God in me does not weaken God but listen but me and God strengthens me or you follow me when God comes in to me he doesn't get any weaker but when I get into Christ I get stronger and that's got to be a revelation we're in Christ and the life of Christ doesn't get weaker but you in that life is making you the more you eat this word it should be making you stronger now I want you to watch this and the harbor's thereof then shall you bring a sheaf of produce of your harvest into the cheap up to the pipe freeze now when they bring it to the priest those who may not be streaming the wave sheaf offering I brother Stengel he could really do just as it is but I'm oh I'm oh highlight it maybe one day he'll preaching and you'll get the other side of it the restaurant looks like the rest of it but with the wave sheaf there was a feel out there and I'm just going to use it internally understand let's say 200 acres maybe the man might have 400 they had more land maybe to work with then we have Randy cities but on all these acres I want you to watch this he might had acres and all those acres they were thousands upon thousands of heads of wheat and that farmer had to watch that crop to whole crop to see which head comes to maturity first that mean it's ready to be harvested which means if the first one comes to maturity then that tells you what season you're living in you know even harvest time why because there's something ready to be harvested and so when you find that first hair that comes of maturity that has the ripeness you want that has the health you are not there's a little limp or a little little stubble looking you don't pick that one you let that you let you just cut that down and throw it away because this it's ready burn but you find one that's healthy that looks like the original crop that went into the ground you said now that's what I planted and that's what I've been waiting for and so according to this prophecy without ready of Leviticus I'm going to read the rest of it but a Branham use it as a type or a shadow to point to the real fulfillment of the prophecy and price was the real fulfillment want you to watch this now when that man plucks that head of wheat he goes to the priest as this is the first fruit of maturity at all my work this farming season this is what I plant and this is what I've been waiting on and then a high priest examines it and then he blesses it and then he weighs it before God they said God we thank you for giving this man this crop we thank you for bringing his farm to maturity and we thank you for the rest of his head coming to the same position may I bless the entire crop you come to the same position and what God did in Christ when Christ compete in the book of Acts before those disciples before Pentecost why did he have to come back talk to them because he had to prove that resurrection was successful and God has accepted him as a resurrection and then God lifted up that Christ right in front of disciples listen in front of them and waved it over the disciples and you see what I deal with this man you shall have the same life do you receive what he had he was the wave sheaf and every believer the trench ages had to have a portion of that same life brother BAM said Oh what happened the church back slid or went to sleep in two traditions in the nomination how the Catholic Church tried to kill off a true believer of that original faith in the Dark Ages they tried to them out but brother man said they couldn't stomp out life even though the life was brought into Catholicism the believers like Luther in joining listen the Catholic Church a real believe in the leg seed in a denominational Church but because he was an Alexei he had a measure of their life and the church could not hold him but listen just as their first wave sheaf let me finish me my scripture Prince did I'm if I'm finished about done and the Bible says then you shall bring the sheaf of the first fruits to your harvest unto the and ye shall waved the Sheep before the Lord he says to be accepted for you now listen this wave sheaf is in the hand of the priest who has the right to go before God and God has accepted it on your behalf was being presented now I don't want you to miss this when Christ rose from the dead and God raised him up before the disciples God was saying I'm accepting him on your behalf you're going to be this not by your efforts but by my blessing that crop was going to be the same thing not by his effort the we wouldn't saying oh I gotta be like that we let me be like that we let me be like that we the weak didn't even really realize what was going on but the power of the one that was sending the blessing had the ability listen to achieve something to make the other weak come to the same position I want you to watch this when Christ was way brother Bram said on Pentecost that life that was in that way she came back and brought four more sons of God that had the same life he had and I want you to watch this because he was accepted for you listen and on the morrow after the Sabbath Dupree share waving never the messing he noticed when he waved it he didn't wave it on the Sabbath that would be the seventh day he said on tomorrow the next day after the Sabbath which means the Sunday or the eighth day professor do you notice that Christ resurrected on the eighth day not the seventh day show that it was an endless life could eight represents eternity or you follow me and so now we find that Christ being resurrected on the eighth day live it to die no more and brother BAM said now that was a type or showing what God was going to do in his last day because at the seven church ages guess what the church had drifted away from the original life but God had a promise in the Bible that in the last days I shall restore and the same way that the full word was waved over that first church because they were like Christ in the day when the church drifts awful is beating down bucket after Christ said the third day listen to me he said it'll rise again well arise again his body this time not the first corporal body this time it would be a spiritual body in our age what did God do that same son of me that lived listen two thousand years ago that same life came back into another son of man and that same life living son of man doing the same works doing the same science showing that by that resurrection the life had gone it had been blocked by the nominations but brother BAM said the denominations could not hold it after three days or three Church ages Luther's age was his age the Pentecostal age and after the third day at the you and I have been called out of Pentecost we weren't called out to go back into another search for we will call that to be the marination wave she who's she it's Christ man and where was Christ being revealed is the message of the hour and this message for almost over fifty years has been waves around the world what is God saying you have within you a potential to be this it's not gonna be your achievement it's not gonna be my achievement is your achievement it's gonna be the achievement of Almighty God not our power no by my but by my spirit I'm gonna cheese this great thing it's by grace he does it grace grace the capstone came we're going to manifest the capstone by His grace why is they predestinated unconditional covenant to the elect of Almighty God and brother BAM said if you've got their seed in his wave she's being waved over you he said you're growing you're growing cuz something's in you to respond to it by the blessings of God every time you wave that thing there's a blessing in it and it's making all those those other crop come to the same position what position did he come to a manifest a son of God showing us how God could express himself in one man so much so Billy policy only wins her room we could table to him before he got to ask profits i i'm not have those kind of discernment of visions so because back it up a little bit but he had this that the first son hey Lily Paul said he would say son he said I know before I pray what he's gonna do why because I do it according to his word and he always hears my prayer what did the first son do when he calls for Lazarus he was not worried with him that doesn't come up resurrection he knew who he was he knew the promise was and he said God always hear my prayer why why did God always hear his prayer listen Church I want to say this I'm trying to close in Christ there was no condemnation he knew who God never been sent in perfect faith he had a perfect confidence because he knew what God made him to be he said now the true believer can't we have confidence in what God in this hour has made us to be not what you feel like you are not next to what you feel like what by the word what has God made you to be and brother Bram said and if this condemnation in your heart something know that you've done that you ought not to do that's contrary to their word he said just go and get that thing right there's no fear in your heart the Bible told us in Saint John the first job Lee was chapter 5 that if we had no condemnation we had this confidence that he hears us because there's nothing between you and God you see what the BRABUS calling us to you see what the message is calling us to not just a congregate and be a synagogue around a common idea or a common theology but there's a people that literally have to bear witness of this resurrected life because it's been restored in last day and way to the church not brother Branham wave but Christ in the manifestation of the worthy our being waited by a prophets message it what is the fire for trying to do we're just trying to wave that same message not change they're not adding to it and I tell you where brother Branham was wrong and where you should not believe everything you see it but I I got in revelation to tell you what parts you can believe what parsec a belief nonsense the wave seat has been weighed it's been vindicated and I believe what he preached and there's another man don't believe it all we'll let him go his way that's fine we don't condemn the man you follow me but we keep marching and I'm not talking about then I know some UI filling some your mind drift a certain way I'm talking I'm talking about people who are actually walking to say they believe this message and no doubt preaching at certain treasures morning quoting the Prophet but at the same time my quoting the Prophet I tell you well let me tell you where this fold is wrong don't believe that quote believe this quote now I'm not saying I'm clearer and clearer and clearer that that word he preaches nothing but this word being interpreted or you follow me and I ain't even finished with this wave sheaf yet but I'm gonna say this and I'ma close I'm gonna say this in close we've got to have the same faith Abraham had when gob Abraham the Bible said Abraham looked and believed and when he believed he became what he believed once that word found good ground and Abraham the word can now manifest itself God expressed in Abraham and when this message finds good ground I pray everybody listening this morning but as resurrection morning I pray in our hearts we all have good ground to believe this message and be simple just like Mary God be it unto me according to thy word and where I see I'm falling short don't be too hard not to get on your knees and say God forgive me I don't doubt your promise but where I'm falling short forgive me and then let me forgive others and with that kind of grace in your heart they say now God may you perform in me that which you promised Abraham but he was down there in Greer when he wanted to get his wife restored the shore was predestination election Abraham was the one out of order but in order to keep his promise God went down and told that man you bless him so yeah but he did me wrong he said but that's my profit that's my son he's walking under a promise now Abraham gets punished but Babel said you do some wrong God's gonna punish you but it has nothing to do with the Covenant of promise he made you so if we have things that's wrong it doesn't break the promise it doesn't break the Covenant but it will hinder you and your walk until you get those things right we're an hour that's be ever more sincere we don't have one thing to fear about Koroma last thought I'm gonna give you a time closer I thought about that this morning I said god I got a promise 10,000 might fall him out one 2x4 once I have 10,000 the left hand I don't quarter just write this now but it should not come down me that's a promise you said brother Mike I mean let can't get sick no I didn't say that I said God might allow it to get sick but if I get sick guess what I got another promise by your stripes I'm healed you say brother Mike Corona Cain killing like God might call it like home he's gonna have to call you home sorry you don't go by body change God has to call you home wait Oh Dean even if I go by the grave I got another promise he should call it and I'll come up again Korona death has no power over a believers I'm trying to express to you not to fear it because they can do no more to you that God will allow it that's the faith of the elect same could do no more the job then God would allow it so if it knocks at your door if it gets a hole then God allowed it for a reason still don't interfere because no matter how it passes by every situation in David can bring you've got a promise let's walk in there promise how many thank God for resurrection morning Hank me thank God for a resurrection message now let's thank God for a resurrected life not in that Christ not in that son of God but in this son of God in your mortal bodies our heads dear Heavenly Father Lord we want to thank you this morning for resurrected life for witnessing already your resurrection innocence of believers for coming out under the shout in Lord I believe the brights right now was marching into a divorce the voice for the resurrection before you said that voice was V in her the call to sleep in Saints from the grave what I prayed the message this morning was simple enough that we can catch it Lord has been the resurrection when that resurrection happened happened in a change of dispensation and when this resurrection has happened it's changed a dispensation you said you know Lauren called church but you're not called a bride and you said miss Iowa in the Rising Sun that God called the bride into a bride age mister bride coming to Christ Lord I don't know how else to put it it's not man living anymore there's got to be Christ in man and Lord I've spoken it as plainly as an Ohio but God my words are just that if there's not one to come behind it I'm maxing God first that you forgive us forgive me of our sins Lord made those at our home Lord made the Bible four-year-old God not before the TV or the video or higher of their streaming not before preacher but Lord made the Bible for the resurrected son of God back in the form of the Holy Ghost Lord me now you interpret your word in our presence Lord of this sick amongst us our acts in the name of Jesus Christ we don't have been present lay hands Lord and your name may you heal them Lord you've already done the healing Lord I ask only that you anoint them with the faith to receive what's already been done Lord if they need the Holy Ghost or more of the Holy Ghost or rededication whatever they need to take their lives close to God may each one of us right now with our horse and head bow said Lord may you take me higher Lord may you give me grace to know how to surrender that I might be able to yield all I have to you that in our God and our bodies into my body you might give express yourself even now in a greater way God let us not fear the enemy let us not fear death let us not fear anything Lord for thou has conquered death held a grave and in that name Lord you've given us the same victory Lord we thank you I actually grace upon the bride around the world Lord it's checking the stand in these last hours Lord we don't know how much time we left but I don't believe it's very much more Lord Lord may you promise to God you promise there's certain things you were doing this hour god I'm accidental God according to your promise let us see those things may manifest and let us believe with all of our heart Lord we commit this day in the service in your hands not just as a memorial the world represents Easter as a memorial just something to look back on an event in this past but Lord we're not looking at a past event our memorial is not history God our moral is to recognize an event that's taking place resurrection of Jesus Christ in your bride body in this last day granted Lord we thank you and we commit all things in your hand and we accidentally Jesus Christ may may the bride save me amen amen mercy brother Abel by saying amen but the same thing he said about the coronavirus we believe that for every sickness every disease cancer yeah nothing nothing can stand and nothing can bring a believer down even if you go to the doctor and he says oh well you have cancer we know that that God could use that as a doorway to get us out and our confession should still remain positive no matter what the symptoms are that we're healed because that's what the scripture says that's that's the promise word for us so despite what the symptoms may say you know we're still healed because in the end of the day even if that cancer took your life you received your healing in heaven on the other side so despite what the sickness is despite with diseases like you brother Mike said about the coronavirus all that we know the truth we know the word we read the back of the book we know we win nothing can come and in effect the believer I that's what I believe and I believe that's right along with what brother Mike was saying so we're gonna we're gonna do this song who's actually requested to close on this song
