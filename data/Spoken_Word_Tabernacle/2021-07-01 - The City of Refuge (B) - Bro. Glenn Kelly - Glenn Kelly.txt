you remember the service this coming sunday i wanna accept the lord direct me differently but lord's willing we wanna we already prepare you on how the woman was created and the weakness of the body of the woman the mystery behind it and last sunday we talked about the the the last veil and how god gave the clothing in order to conceal the shape to conceal the woman to close the body and then to avoid any lust coming up so lord is willing this sunday to what i'm looking on the radar we should land on a high heel amen so you pray for me except the lord tells me something different but it's there i wanted to bring that on sunday when everybody is here it makes a difference when everybody's here amen so lord is willing you pray for the service and i pray that the lord will let you catch the revelation and you're going to see so whenever you want to buy your shoes you're just going to look at the shoes and you come up with your own conclusion whether this is suitable for me or this is not a suitable for me instead of me telling you it's going to be two millimeter three millimeter five millimeter six millimeter then we back again to the law amen the problem is not here the problem is high here not here it is high here amen but how high is the hill that's the problem so if we go to high high you is the hill we're going to be standing there with a measure tape which we're not going to do that amen so we want you to grasp the concept and see why the prophet was against it once you get it then you're going to understand what is going on and the lord willing everything will be clear so we must soar a little bit touch proverbs 7 which you already know in detail touch first peter again and touch timothy then we go straight to isaiah 3 where it's leading so if you are behind on the sermon make sure you catch up because you're going to be lost amen if you ride on target we will be soaring easily and moving back and forth if not you're going to give me a double job to go back again and rehearse and make sure nobody's left behind amen so lord's willing depending on what they will be doing tomorrow if everything is completed tomorrow which i don't want to talk about it because it's on youtube if everything is completed tomorrow just beyond the loop you might receive a text from brother david will send a text and let you know that we might need help on saturday morning to put up certain things that i don't want to say on youtube so you know you have any questions ask the deacon ask the trustee they can give you plain detail ask brother greg who'll tell you what's going on up there so lord's willing just be on the loop you might receive a text if everything goes fine tomorrow it tells you what we expect on saturday we need some help and we can put up stuff and by the grace of god we're going to move to the next step and see how quick we can get into that building amen we appreciate all your prayer everything that you're doing so remember us in prayer we want to soar and be able to stop fellowshipping there and then continue with everything uh in the future so brother kelly's here i'm not going to take a lot of time so pull on the gift of

up every sorcery devil that's been trying to trouble your people lord god because we know it's a revival going on within your bride so we give you praise we give you honor we give you glory and by faith we claim it all done in jesus name we pray amen and amen hey thank you musicians maybe you know an interpreter i'll try to remember that you're back there today hallelujah let's go to proverbs 18 nothing new we just want god to anoint what he's given us grace to look into we know it's wednesday and we won't keep you by the grace of god just pray with us we got a timer here so we we we're mindful of all those things um proverbs 18 and verse 10 once you have it say amen said the name of the lord is a strong tower and the righteous run into it and it's safe you may be seated and we know we want you to turn to um the numbers no not numbers go to joshua first go to joshua uh 20 and then we'll read this and then we'll give you the thought and we'll let the lord come in and and just have his way hallelujah minister joining then by the grace of god we're looking for once you have it say amen look at joshua 20 and and for the sake of time let's start at verse uh seven verse seven it says and they appointed kadus in galilee in mount nephilia and shechem in mount ephraim and kurja arba which is hebron in the mountain of judah and on the other side of jordan by jericho eastwood they assigned bizarre in the wilderness upon the plane out of the tribe of reuben and raymath and gilead out of the tribe of gads says in golan in base son out of the tribe of manassas says now these were the cities appointed for all the children of israel and for the stranger that so joined among them that whosoever kill of any person and unawares might flee hither and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood until he stood before the congregation may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word you know brother branham worked this in letting off the pressure he went in letting off the pressure but we know we're going to look at it a a little different but it's in that same message we're going to work with tonight the city of refuge we're going to look at the city of refuge because you know in letting off the pressure of time we thank god for a vindicated prophet in the end time because we know it's part of the scriptures it is being part of the scriptures all the scriptures is being fulfilled so you know we know we've been working with those demon forces and down and messages down in the soul but we asked them god gave us grace to just look into this little thought here tonight there's a city of refuge but you know let's look at all this pressure that's upon us now it's a lot of pressure in the world there's pressure on people from left to right left coming and going satan is trying to throw every fiery dart that he can after god's children so we know that people are raging and fussing and moving in the wrong way in the wrong spirits because they have to understand why god is doing what he's doing is that right god is moving because they they even know that it's getting near the end time the sinner know that is in time they're doing more drinking they're doing more drugging they're doing more whoring they're doing more with all the things that stealing and they're doing more partying they're doing all these things to the flesh because they know we don't have long to get out of here is that right so we know that winners are revival the bride knows that it's a revival going on because it's going on within her so when that revival is going on is also a devil is rising up is that right but jesus promised to us that he would never leave us or forsake us is that right so we just want to look at this city these cities of refuge and we want you to look at it we don't won't plan to be long but we want you to understand that it is a place of refuge is that right and we know we are in that place of refuge is that right we know we as believers you know about repentance is that right we remember i know remember the last thing when brother chad said and that he when he finished up he also threw in that this is was what this is a message of reconciliation is that right so that means we know that god has sent us after lost souls is that right so now that's why you're being taught the way you're being taught but god has also told us that now the pastor is here god has given us a gift is that right that to fulfill his scripture to fulfill because he said that you had to have a fivefold ministry he said you had to have an apostle you had a prophet a pastor a teacher and an evangelist is that right different ministries so now god for what for the perfecting for the maturing of the saints is that right in this end time so we can't just have just the tapes is that right and some wants to come in here and think that we're being uh kind of aggressive because we're speaking against those things no we are earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the saints is that right so that's why you have your pastor coming led by the holy ghost that's we doing what restored restoring god said he promised i shall restore what the palmer worm the cankerworm the caterpillar the locusts have eaten up is that right so we know what the catholic church on what the methodist but the lutheran what's the pentecostal is that right this is the pentecostal age but we have the pentecostal experience is that right god came and exposed and showed us it was not just the restoration of the gift is that right but it was the opening of the word is that right on the world on the road of emmaus jesus came in what broke the scriptures to them he didn't just break the scriptures to him he broke it with understanding is that right so now you can move so when your understanding comes your confidence comes like brother bruce spoke last week confidence is that right then your confidence comes is that right and your faith is a what faith is a revelation is that right when i return to the earth shall i find what faith on the earth so we just want to lay this foundation because it's a mess going on out there now but what are we doing we are sighing and crying for the condition of this land is that right because one of our loved ones one of our brothers one of our sisters are among the children of disobedience is that right don't never give up on nothing they are not disobedient they are among the children of disobedience because god says we are sons and daughters of the most high god and we're moving in the authority under the baptism of the holy ghost we know when you're going and seeking a soul they must do what repent is that right now who don't know about repentance we know that right and then they have to be what justified is that right after they are justified if they have to be sanctified if they didn't fill with the holy ghost is that right now god we have an order that god has given us to go out and win those souls you have to have a burning desire you have to have a burning desire down in your soul for a lost soul let us come that's why somebody's getting stagnated oh god get ready to ambush you you're getting stagnated because you're not going out telling what you are receiving is that right if you go out and you tell it you believe it is that right you can't cast to catch a fish unless you cast the net or cast to ride and it got to be the kind of what bait that they like is that right so you have to listen listen to what they're talking about you're in the workforce it has to be a love of faith that's working by love you can i am not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ that's why the whole world needs jesus look what he says he says now a refuge is a shelter it's a protection from danger now all these cities there was up on a hill i won't have time to get into all that you got to go because there's a lot in this so we're just going to guess god to give us grace to hit those high points those cities was up on the hill but remember moses first says god gave them moses the right to three cities refuge cities but when joshua and them now and got into that in the heritage and to the land god gave him three more cities on the west side is that right he had three on the east side had three on the west side we're going to find out tonight if you're really in christ huh this is self-examining time those were just not cities these were cities with particular names these cities meant something that god went in there that's why we need cities of refuge is that right we know the city of refuge to us is our high priestess who jesus christ is that right but this was the land cities the lands of the leviticus is that right they had to be a priest to be in this land okay hallelujah glory be to god he said now these are the shelter protection of a place and and here i want you to look at and let me go to the scriptures first let's go to romans 8 then i'll read to you what the prophet said so you can see by his grace and his mercy where he's getting it from by god's grace he says now we have to realize things that we're in a war we're in a real war and as the word continue to unfold unless you are born again i don't order another spirit you won't be you're no match for the devil i'm no match for the devil none of us no match for the devil but jesus christ is is that right he's given us the authority now to live a victorious life we are not to be living a down beat up life even through our transgressions we'll do what rejoice because we have promises from god is that right hallelujah look what he said romans 8 and 1. he says a familiar scripture there is therefore now what no condemnation to them that we're at walk not after the war but after the war no condemnation new can bring any charge against god's elect nobody can bring any charge against godzilla hallelujah i'm trying to remember you brother caleb hallelujah look what we got here he said now look drop down to verse 34. he says who is he that condemneth it is christ that died see ye rather that that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also make a direct intercession for us so you see christ's faith living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away now what is what is with us we have the resurrected christ living with us see he said i'll be with you and inside of you until the end of the world so last time when we were here that's why we don't have time to fuss we don't have time to go back and forth the lord showed us he's blinding them he's making them think that they have something just as much as we have okay but god's doing it you want to keep your blindness on and stay focused to what god sent us to do that's all we're here to do so god is now what he's doing he's cleaning up some of you may try to accuse him with the uh uh the pastor some of them tried to accuse us as being a legalistic thing no no no no no no no joshua the ministry of zoster and zerubbabel was given the order remember when akan and them got into the land and god said what it came to design a babylonian garment he was designed to covenant that thing in his heart that's why i was saying you gotta where there's no desire there's no temptation you gotta cash down every imagination that try to exalt itself against the word of god that's why david said i keep the lord before me at all times i meditate on thy word day and night more children he's building something here god's bringing us into something see though see the law was others the law was just a school master he kept us until now we're moving into the grace of god that's been extended to us in this end time so it was all by predestination for our knowledge so children god and you may not appear to be anything you may be appeared to be struggling but don't worry about it you're going to be just like him when he comes is that right hallelujah that's what we're going to have and look verse 35 he says who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation huh no distress no see that's what he's trying to tell him or persecution or famine or nerkiness or pearls or sir or sword see who shall separate us see nothing can separate us from the love of god because now why because the ephesus age they fell from their first love is that right but in this age god restored his people back to his first love so you love the word you love to hear the word that's why god have you sitting here now he saved the best for last is that right so you don't have to worry about anything he said what shall i hide from abraham nothing because i know that he will keep my commandment and raise his children according to my word and ain't that what he's saying you are the royal seed of abraham you got god's blood you were saved by god's blood you are redeemed by god's blood who can bring any charge against who ah who chose you god chose you you are god's elector no weapons conformed against you comprised who who can counsel god who got to oversay god who could change the mind of god only one ken is his bride is that right only one candace's pride no one else [Music] a refuge he said look what he's saying he was singing that song turn the psalm this just come to me turn to um psalms 55 i think it was let me turn back to them he was singing that song help me lord i got to catch it how when it comes yeah i'm not like the mother preachers i got to catch it when he dropped it help me lord he says 50 51 i'm sorry psalms 51. if you look at psalms 51 he was saying look david was saying here i'll start at verse 7. he said purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean wash me and i shall be whiter than snow he says make me to hear what ah we're going to show you when we get to them cities hallelujah thank you jesus he said look watch me he said make me through here joy and goodness he says that the bones with thou has broken may work rejoice glory be to god look what we're saying now he says hide thy face from my sins and blot out my iniquities he says do what create in me a clean heart oh god and renew a right spirit in me he said cast me not away thy presence and take not thy holy spirit away from me why restore unto me the joy of what my salvation our city of refuge saints we tell them about our jesus when you talk about your jesus when you come up here don't come up here and give a dry testimony why are you giving a drive testimony it's joy what the lord has done for you the lord has saved me the lord i watched over another day the lord gets to glory the lord there's happiness in this life it's joy in this life it's goodness in this life he sent you a wha even said that's a gift a pastor that will not be moved is that right the devil have no space in here saints love thy god with all thy heart and all thy mind and all thy soul and all thy strength look what he says hallelujah thank you jesus look at this here why verse 12 again restore unto me the joy of thy salvation uphold me with thy what free spirit so allah may what then i will i teach transgressors thy ways see why he's doing it it's not just a song it's not just something he's doing is restoring you so we can fight the good fight of faith earnestly contend for the faith in the end time if you see someone that's struggling in school little children or daddy or mama huh something going on in the house or somebody's fussing or whatever they don't want to be that way they don't want to be that way that's the devil that's all he's doing he's he's putting pressure on people he's putting the pressure on him but he's restoring us but let me finish reading it hallelujah he said then will i teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be what converted unto thee man let me tell you something the lord is good look how graceful he is he's not just he just didn't pick you just to sit you down if you just grab all the teaching the teaching is places you the teaching positions you but you can get cold and starchy without the gospel it's got to be in the form of rain in the latter rain this is not just an intellectual conception you are getting the mind of god huh that was hidden before the foundation of the world saints huh god have saved the best for last we're not here to be transformed to the world we want the world to be transformed to a christian is that right it's not that what paul said he when he came to king agrippa when he came to junior gripper king agrippa said paul you almost convinced me to be a christian paul said not just you king of griffith but all of y'all we desire no one to be lost is that right this is a joyous life brother visitor this is a joyous life brother a joyous life hallelujah i wish y'all wish the lord would have grabbed to hold me a long time ago brother greg hallelu yeah that's why i ain't saying this you brothers that was brother steve brother polly car and all you brother mike and all you brothers that was ready brother killer all y'all that was raised up you young brother raised up in this message my god my god how much grace has been extended to you you thank god that you didn't have to go through some of those things that god has kept you from the almighty god you thank god for your parents you thank god for them for them being obedient to the word of the lord is that right we had struggles too but i'll tell you then we had them praying mothers praying granddaddy praying grand mama we have praying parents brother look what he says hallelujah get a little warm up here let me tell you something i said right the devil still know he in trouble because we ambushed him tonight so he thought i was coming another way he got ambushed hallelujah look what he say here he said so we can deliver deliver me from from blood guilt and this oh god thou god of my salvation and my tongue shall sing what of thy word righteousness is that right hallelujah enter his gates with what thanksgiving look what he says hallelujah let me read something some what the prophet said because i had somebody had a spirit the other week i'm telling you the devil been fighting how the spirit could come the other week say oh yes pharisees spirit i said yeah okay uh-huh yeah yeah i ain't got time with him no no no i ain't got time first with him god don't give me my answer i ain't got time first with you no more i'll pray for you and i love you look what he says here brother branham talked about this here he said you're seeing what the people need he said and now not to stand before you just saying not to stand before some congregation but he was just letting you know that we as ministers we just don't come just to be preaching and when you come because you come for the need to help god's people there's god to give us something this is not a show he says see the name of the lord is a what a strong tower a tower also is a refuge a tower also is a pulpit so the word of the lord come from the pupil is from god from this throne from his throne to this throne to your throne that's god's order this is not a show he's building a spiritual house saints and you are the one that he chose to be victorious in this life the city of refuge we're going to see what the prophets say about this city of refuge hallelujah he said what is he saying all this together this tension is built up it's just tension built up around here tension on people you say something people people money got them running gambling got them running pornography got them running thinking got them running but just tension these jobs is just working these forces with less people the job's got pressure on it's just pressure but satan is the prince of this world it's satan that's putting the pressure on the people it's satan that's putting the pressure on your father it's satan that's putting the pressure on your mother it's satan that's putting the pressure on your guardian it's satan is trying to put the pressure on the ministry but when you get down and you pray is that right when you get down and you pray you get on offense of prayer when you get on an offensive prayer you start praying thanking god for his grace thanking god for his mercy then you start binding up the sorcery demons sprouting up the lust demons biting up the religious demons you start binding them up sending them back to where they come from you shake satan's force his kingdom hallelujah look what he says now he says there's tension of the devil over the whole world but what is the answer for the world jesus christ that's exactly right jesus christ is the place of refuge jesus christ is the city of refuge is that right we're working this message says this is still the message letting off the pressure the prophet of god preached this five times but this here we want you to see what is going on so you'll understand you got to really fight in prayer it's just like the pastor said he said when you get your conduct in order oh you're going to find out that conducting order you remember when the holy spirit ministered that we were in the back of god's mind before the foundation of the world that's in conduct and order well when are we talking about all those um demon forces that was in them pigs and swine where'd they go them demon forces that was in them pigs in them swine they're in people now they're in people that's in your word conducting order is that right and so we have to understand now when you pray there's 200 million demon plus demons loose there's going to be a challenge to praying sometimes that's in that conducting order so you got to understand don't let anyone try to pull you away from your time with the lord is that right because if you if you don't spend your time with the lord like you're supposed to he's going to spank you that's all he's not going to lose you he's going to spank you just like a father would do a child is that right when they become disobedience so we have to understand that god has called us for a work a labor in love he said put on the whole what armor of god so that we may be able to do what withstand the wilds the trickeries of the devils in the end time see how merciful he is to us he told him over in the corinthians you know the corinthians always wanted to major on the minor they want to major on the gifts is that right so they want to make so god could only tell them the weapons of our warfare are not what car nor is that right but mighty through god that's all he could tell them but when he came to ephesus he told him what the weapons were is that right so he held he can give this a little more now he's pulled his bride aside brother greg and he's opening up the whole heart to his bride is that right jesus was the fullness of god so we are looking in this hour here now into the word of god the fullness of the word of god don't be ashamed of the gospel saints you will not fail god cannot fail god did not choose you to fail what the devil is doing as the holy ghost been saying he's trying to make you feel bad about your nose he's trying to make you feel bad about your ears he's trying to make you feel bad about the color of your skin he's trying to make you feel bad about the way you shake he's trying to make you feel bad about your height but god don't make no mistakes is that right huh god don't make no mistake sir you don't have to with them you know where the fella they used to pick at me too i used to want to grow an afro when i was in the world you know and my hair wasn't groping right about that high and so you know they used to pick at you they call you t.w.a you know what t.w.a was in the world teeny weeny afro and so they would just pick the world as cruel you know what and you got to put up with them you got to put up with them is that right you can't get pulled on their side then one day god gave me a word brother you know what he told me you better be careful god made me and god don't like you picking at his children huh it's best for you just to say nothing at all so god give you a word of wisdom isn't that what he said it's best for you to hang a chain in the middle stone around your neck and cast yourself in the sea then to touch one of god's children you're in trouble huh hallelujah the world is cruel the crew don't don't don't let the world don't try to pull yourself into the world don't try to get caught up with the world don't try to dress like the world the world wanted the world seeing something in you huh he sees something to you that he won then that brother branham said when a young rich ruler what did he have humble steve he had religion is that right he had religion he said when he saw jesus i'm gonna slow down a little bit brother when he got around in there and the young rich ruler he saw jesus and jesus came and he ran to him and he said what must i do to be saved he said he fell down on it said all your goods give the money to the poor he said he walked away sad and he walked away sad but see how close it was it would have deceived the very elect if it was possible the only one knew that he had religion was jesus the other one started he had salvation he was on his way to heaven but that's what we were warned against now is those religious demons but brother branham said what it was was he saw a character in jesus that he knew he did not have he's looking at the character that's in his bride that he did not have you see so that's what satan is trying to pull you in by the flesh is that right it's that character saints you look at you ain't got to answer the devil every time you say something huh you got to answer you look at him sometime look at him and when he went to fuss and he asked you something oh brother i don't know yeah yeah i don't know brother you answer him truthfully see he can't handle the truth jesus said i am the way i am the truth and i am the life no man no man can come to the father unless they come through me jesus is the answer here's the place of refuge he said now in the world no they know that they're wrong he says i'm going to read this anyway so you know what the prophet said he says and he couldn't stop nowhere see let me see says if he done something accidentally i'll start let me go up if you're writing it down is that paragraph 56 on um letting off the pressure it says now in the old testament there was a time when a man could build up pressure way back there and that was when he done something wrong if he showed innocent blood then he was on the run see because as soon as that man that he killed or the wrong he did that man he did the wrong to some of his people would hunt him until they found him and they killed him it was a tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye see he had no place to stop he says if he'd done something accidentally he says and then if you want to write it down you can go over to deuteronomy i mean numbers 35 and also in 20 i'm trying to for the sake of time i'm trying not to turn all those scriptures he says he could not stop nowhere he was the future ted he didn't know what to do he said a very type of today he said i think that's what's causing so much pressure we're on the run that's what the matter with the world knowing they're wrong knowing knowing that the coming of the lord is at hand see now this is the prophet they know the coming of the lord is at hand we know that they're thirsting for who god we know we got the goods we don't believe we're the one that got the goods for him don't be ashamed of your gospel he said well you are ashamed because you're not sure that's the only way you got to be sure you got to be no you know that you are the elect of god you know that god have chosen you you know these things you have god watching of you all heaven is watching over us heaven and earth jesus christ is not only with you he's inside of you is that right so we got to get all we're trying to get them do is what is to christ is that right you they can't make their self bride no way you can make their self bright but we can get them into christ is that right because we have to remember what's going to happen they said well brother where they going to be at on the throne where are they going to be at i think some are going to make it be in heaven but they're going to be out there they're not going to be on the throne with us we're the pride we're going to be sitting on the throne you see this serious thing so that's why we can tell them about christ we can tell them about the goodness of the lord we can tell them about the blood or what jesus christ has done for us on calvary because we are pressing our way on that's why he said restore the joy now the word is being restored now so by the word being restored your joy is to be restored also nobody wants to be drawn into a dead religion wouldn't be sure about that hallelujah let me keep reading he said now it's the type of what's causing so much pressure we're on the one that's what's the matter with the world knowing they're wrong knowing the coming of the lord is at hand and the pressure is building up it says and there on the run rose roadhouse gambling dens luxury sin immorality decay anything that you name to give what to give bit he said listen to a tv a dirty joke anything get vent they're on the run there's something fixing to happen he says they know it and they're drinking and they're drinking themselves to death with pleasure and everything else on the run he says they know there's something fixing to happen the world speaks of it we know that something is fixing to happen the world may be blown up before daylight every nation is under tension every nation is under tension because some knucklehead can push the button at any time is that right that's why they're going to run around people are being deceived is that right if you look at it you you look at the um i'm obama ahab he he agreed i typed him with a hat he wasn't running nothing he was a jelly back when they get around in there you got to understand when you turn to when when you look at this situation that we're in now we have to realize our number one i mean israel or allies he agrees to the number one enemy he signed and agreed for them to get atomic weapons is that right so you have to understand and pay attention to what god is doing right now you got on the supreme court there's no more protestants all you got is basically jews seven jews and i think the two are catholics i'm not sure i mean uh two are jews i think the others are catholics but anyway on the supreme courts you've got majority catholic votes on there now they're right here in the midst the things that the prophet told us it's not coming it's here now it's right in the midst and you god fought so much of you the prophet of god says america need more missionaries than any place in the world and god has put you in heaven never with the sinner you are right in the midst of it they're all around you come on saints god have put you here then put you in africa he didn't put you in the islands he didn't put you somewhere else he put you here for earnestly content for the faith of god look what he says hallelujah he says no matter just she says one time let me skip that for the grace for the sake of time because we want to get to those refuge he said now look in old testament god seeing in some of some of this trouble was as god was seeing some of this trouble was accidentally he knew it was accidentally so if you're innocent and not guilty god makes a way for you that's why it's people i've seen them locked up that's a terrible thing to be locked up there was one brother i won't say name but it was a situation before they locked the institutions down because the kovic he had been locked up at the time going on eight years and he was on death row they was going to execute him and he kept telling him he was innocent and they found out he was innocent and he was innocent the grace of god but i tell you and he knew god blessed him and richly blessed him and every time someone coming in he would always remind them pray for me keep me up in prayer think about those people that you work around those people that you see how many of y'all that they've come to you and said pray for me keep me up in prayer they recognizing something that the young rich ruler recognized they recognize there's something inside of you they recognizing that you have a spirit of character about you they recognize that you can get in touch with god for them they recognizing that you are maybe labor for hours for them they recognize you hun brother polycarp hallelujah brother they recognizing that that prayer will do what that you can break through is that right we have a high preach that cannot be touched by the what the feelings of our infirmities is that right jesus is the answer for the world today seeing this in these cities of refuge these were high priests but they just went but stood in the gap for them is that right but jesus came to our high priesthood at melchizedek he made a way that we can do what go on through is that right let's go over to hebrews for a minute hebrews 6 and we get into the cities hebrews 6. look what the look what christ if that's what brother branham was talking about in that hidden life when you go in that hidden life in that message ahead in life you're a hidden in life you are now no condemnation you are now in christ jesus and when you can go in there and you can live that life every day but what's happening is the reason why we're up and down and i'm guilty at times too the devil catch you when you ain't prayed up you see that's when it gets you when you ain't prayed up he coming he recognized that so we have to understand sometimes that lord if it takes just five minutes stop lord have mercy on me god i had to rush up out of here with my child i had to go over here lord and the mercy came up father but you know i always meet with you have mercy on me father and god i have mercy on you at that time is that right because he know your heart look what he says let's say hebrew what was the sixth hallelujah for the sake of time let's look at these uh let's look at verse 17 hebrews 6 and 17 it says wearing god willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the what immobility of his what counsel confirmed it by what by an oath you don't have to worry about anything anything you read in that bible and god said it he will not change it there's a promise you can hold on to it if god said it so we don't say it proudly but we can go boldly to the throne of god god you said you said you never leave or forsake me you said you take the promises to god right back to god you don't go to god as a beggar you are sons and daughters of the most high god is that right you come lifting him up you address him as the majesty you adjust him as the excellent one you adjust him as the almighty god you address him as king of kings you address him as lord of the lord you address him as the almighty he's the one hey that's our god that's our god look what he says hallelujah he said look in verse 18 he said that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for what refugees give us a place a refuge he said look to lay hold upon the hope set before us you see that he gave you a place to know that divides justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost giving us the earnest we know that we got a place waiting on us a heavenly place eternal life is that right hallelujah look what he's saying save the prophet messenger for old sinner like me that was down in the world huh they were hitting me i was hidden hidden in the sinful world and god had us there hiding in our raunchy lives is that right look what he did huh but we all gracious merciful god knew deep down inside is that right we was like a lily is that right huh like a lady coming through the married class is that right they thought we was gonna the devil thought he had us the devil thought he had us beat he thought he had us in drugging he finally had us in drinking he finally had us in smoking he thought he had us in hormones had he had thought he had us in pornography he thought he had us stealing he thought he had us doing those unrighteous things but what he didn't know brother steve what he didn't know that god of god before before the foundation of the realm he already made a layout for his children prophecy look what he says he said look he made a refuge version verse 19 which hope we have as an anchor of our what soul glory be to god both sure and steadfast and which enter into that which within the world the veil he said who ripped it christ did is that right it's not like the high priest that was there in the old testament we have a high priest is that right that came as melchizedek we've followed christ he's made a way where you can go into behind the veil yourself and you can live there you can stay there you can stay in that life increase your prayer life watch it increase it he said look he says with the forerunner is for us enter even jesus made in high priests forever after order of melchizedek before we lose our time now let's look at these cities of refuge let's turn back to joshua hallelujah he said now look these cities that he had there was refuge in these refuge cities they had particular names but i'ma read something to you what the prophet said and the reason why he said what he said and then we're gonna look in there and then he says i'm gonna jump a little bit here for the sake of time he said this is uh chapter uh 82 and letting off the pressure 5 13 62 if you want to go back in and and check it because i'ma pick it up and some of you uh visually i see a couple of visitors in there you don't know about the the prophet of god he's god's sending a prophet in this age but we have any questions we'll we'll talk to you about it hallelujah it says now if you wanted to to do right i'm so glad tonight to tell you that there is a city of refuge that's jesus christ if you don't want to do wrong the enemy is after you then there is a way of escape and that escape is jesus christ now you see why i just sing that song sister jesus is the answer for the world today above them there's no other jesus is the way huh he says now look he said there is a place and i'm not saying let me stop i'm not just talking about jesus the man because jesus was the son of god and he was god jesus was the son of god and he was god and sinners and visitors here tonight for you to get into christ you have to repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost it's a promise unto you and your children and those that are called afar off god bless you says that god bless you hallelujah hallelujah thank you jesus good to see you hallelujah the red city of refuge he says now there is a place you can come and let off the scene see don't get out in the world and cuss nobody out don't get mad if they'll get flustered don't get the argument because the devil will catch you right at that weak point he want to put you in like pressure you and pressure you until you blow up okay but if you're in christ jesus if you're in him or you prayed up if you're praying and reading your bible every day praying and reading your bible and the pastor didn't put pressure on you and the conduct an order just read one every day you know some of you younger generations you know when when i started work we didn't have computers we had paper everything was paper and i do paper and boy i hated them computing you see why i got that paper up here don't you he said i hate them computers sitting around in there i thank god for my wife though because she'll be helping me along the way i'm learning but we get over that you know the lady told me at work she said you do one thing every time you come to work on the computer one thing she said that's five things you learn in a week that's 20 things you learned in a month i looked at i said thank god for the wisdom and that's how i learned to work those computers but we came when we came when we get started out in the workforce it was nothing but paper huh so now you know why your young children y'all got it good hallelujah where's we had helped me lord he said now look the first thing look what the prophet of god is saying he's telling you about in this city of refuge now to get in this city of refuge when this man comes to christ this place of refuge when a man come in the old testament the first thing he had to come upon is his own free will remember he told the deacons not to bring billy paul up he said don't do that he said come into the office let me talk to you he said okay i understand y'all want billy paul to come in he said but don't ever do that again he said let billy paul come on his own let him come got to do it that's why we're telling you the gifts are good there's nothing wrong with the gifts when you have the gifts gifts operating but don't put the gift unless you have the giver unless the gift can be backed by the scriptures the gift got to be backed by the scriptures is that right because satan gives you something too people are being prosperous under these prosperous gospels out here is that right they're being prosperous that's why i said you got to understand the devil always come in and want to try things you know what i saw at that wedding you know what i saw at that wedding sister i saw at that wedding you know what i saw the hand of god i saw some of your family members your loved ones that you praying for that don't agree with this message but they when they came they recognized nobody could have set that up with god [Music] only god could have set that up so the enemy will always come in and try to pick and point at things but you got to keep your mind on what god is doing look at it through god's look at things through the mind of god so we have to understand that's why we were saying it and the prophet of god said people are going through things people are doing things but they don't want to do it if you go and conduct an order you can see some people wanting to get away from stubborn spirits is that right they don't want to be in that stubborn spirit remember saul all he said was god sent the what a evil spirit uh evil spirit on saul but now when you're going in the property god said but that spirit was stubbornness so he had religion and stubbornness when you battle in a religion in a stubborn spirit don't rebuke it just love it and pray for it and watch god do the work for you because you don't know what's really down in there that's another lesson let me get on these cities of refuge let me get on these cities of refugees before my wife get me home and tell me i didn't finish he said now look he said now look the first thing come to he said you have to come on a free more will got to be free more will he said and that's the way you have to come to christ he said another thing you must be satisfied are you satisfied ah they say you must be satisfied you're there you got to be grateful that you're here the grace of god that got you here he says now you don't especially some of you come from your native countries you come from your home country don't get caught up in america i'm homegrown born in america you can't even send me to africa you don't want me in africa i was growing here god put me here for a reason but let me tell you something god put you here too america is a spirit i can't go to africa and be in africa i can't go to japan to be a japanese i can't go to china to be a chinese but every last one of them could come to america and be american see americans of spirit you got to be careful you don't get caught up in the way is that right you'll be grateful that you're here and thank god for it and don't worry about getting caught up in their ways is that right rapping and all that foolishness everybody got a rap is that right we had rap too we got rap too back in our day then ain't nothing new up under the sun what does it say brother billy billy billy fulfilling banana phantom fulfilling means fulfilling their leg it's nothing new under the sun don't worry about it brother trying to interpret that don't worry about it i'm just saying that he said no luck he said look he said he said now look they put him out you must willfully you it says now you can't hang around and you and he said listen to this another thing you must be satisfied while you're there you can't you can't hang around every day trying no marrying no player we're gonna get to these cities but i'm laying this out for you so you we can nail it with the scriptures he said now when you come to christ you can't look back to the world the bible said he he that puts his hands on the plow and turns to look back is not worthy of plowing now there is where so many so-called christians make their mistake see they act like they're going to plow but the first thing comes along they blow up about it now look and the other thing he says there's no complaining if you complain you are outside you are put outside the city of refuge if you start complaining see the grace you're getting here these cities the refuge okay this tatus mount nephilia it means it means sacred place when you make it to the city of refuge you're trying to get to a safe place because somebody's killing you somebody's after you so we're talking about this here it's a sacred place a sanctuary see it's holy our refuge is jesus christ that's cadis shekham at mount ephraim it's the shoulder jesus said and over he told us in isaiah 9 he shall be the counselor the prince of peace lord of the lord he shall be the government he should carry the what the government upon his shoulders huh that's shechem we're talking about hebrew hebron is in judah now these were the cities of refuge on the west side of jordan remember there was vote for jordan you had to die out to yourself you can't come in your own way of thinking you're trying to get to this city of refuge that's why he says in christ there is no condemnation we walk not out to the flesh but after the spirit hebrew hebrew mean what fellowship is fellowship is called to fellowship with christ to have fellowship but then the prophet that god said he sent the holy ghost why so we could be in power in prayer so we can have fellowship with god so we can become one with god so we can finish the plan of redemption is that right so we don't know where that last soul is hallelujah uh give me five minutes you don't mind hallelujah he say look now the city's the refuge he says down hebron in judah was that fellowship with jesus christ on the east side of jordan it was bizarre it was in the plain of moab it meant fortification fortified jesus is the stronghold to all those that trust him he deserved defense city being fortified and then when you got up in this city he says now what rayman gilead it's in the tribe of god it was uh it meant exalt it means high up we shall exalt him if i if i if i be lifted up from the earth then i'll draw all men unto me is that right hallelujah he says look god has exhorted our lord with a mighty hand it says now then go line goal line it says there was also now these remember these were leviticus cities the levites and so these were priests and once you got in there in that priest you had a boundary you was a prisoner but you was a prisoner at large you was in a place where you can still be there and recuperate you can come to a place where god can you can be restored again you can be your joy of the lord can be restored god has brought you in a place where you can exalt him up on high you don't have to be ashamed of them he has given us an unadulterated word he has broken the seals for each and every one of us and saved the best for last is that right he have combated every teaching in every age he has brought a teaching in the truth is that right so now through all the prayer through the uh of gifts through his signs through his wonders but now he's unfolding his mysteries to you now by him unfolding these things we're going to confound the work of the devil so it's going to get to the point and god is going to use you in a mighty way but he has to get all this foolishness when there's a revival where does the revival of the trash come up to the top is that right yeah the trash got to get out of here he told zerubbabel he told joshua don't finish don't put your spirit back up until you're finished getting all the foolishness out of here so it's best to just come on and repent and if you're struggling with something just buying that demon up every day until god come and deliver you hallelujah let me look at this one here in beijing this is golden position you can come forth this is golden in beijing in the in the half tribe of bonashes it says these were also leviticus cities it says what does that mean it means joy exalt the joy of the lord is my strength and that's why when you know you have your salvation nothing can steal your joy look what he's done to us turn this turn to psalms 103. and we're going to stop on this look how beautiful it is thanks we got to understand that the lord jesus has brought us into this into this marvelous walk in this end time so that you can demonstrate the character of christ we are on a reconciliation mission saints is always about winning souls look what he says psalms 103 it says blessed the lord o my soul and all that is what is within me bless his wife the name of the lord is a strong tower and the righteous run into it and are safe he said bless the lord o my soul and forget not what all his benefits not some of his benefits all of his benefits he says who forgiveth all thy one iniquity hill of all i want here what kind of disease all of your disease is that right one day maybe you're still taking the tire now but that's okay god works through medicine god works through doctors god works through hospitals he used that to keep you clean but one day you know what you're just going to take the plain old gospel and your gospel is going to heal you is that right you won't have to go to the medicine cabinet no more because the scripture will come to life i'm the lord thy god that healeth all of thy diseases let us stand below heads hallelujah something soft sister hallelujah god hallelujah hedge bowels eyes closed someone perhaps know that they need their salvation they don't have their salvation you can just raise your
