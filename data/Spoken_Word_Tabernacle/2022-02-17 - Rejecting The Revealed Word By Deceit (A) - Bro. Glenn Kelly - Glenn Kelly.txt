tonight somebody seems like they're tired from work tired amen okay blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah good to see everybody tonight and we appreciate everyone that prays on you know there is a lot going on but guy god's grace we hear amen brother greg mentioned something and i was uh we were chatting on my way coming here and the court came back to me brother branham says this in the angel of the covenant if you need that coat you see me he said now that was the pillar of fire made manifest here on earth following the will of god now tonight after 1900 years we have that same pillar of fire in our midst you bought a picture of it a while ago i say it with reverence scientifically proven this is the key now brother random say if i would die this very night if i brother branham if i would die this very night now that pillar of fire has nothing to do with me amen so the pillar of fire never left with brother branham amen when moses left that pillar of fire was still there and he turned into a person which was the captain of the host because the characteristic remained the same when joshua met him and when moses met him they did the same thing telling you it's the same god only in more faith amen brother branham said if i would die this very night that pillar of fire has nothing to do with me i'm just a man that pillar of fire is in the church not only with me it is with every one of you it is all of us do you believe it amen there is another one where brother branham said that whatever god does with a messenger of the age it's an example to every believer of that age it's like a wave shift that have been given up and when you see that you know exactly what god is calling for amen so don't leave below your privilege blessed be the name of the lord everybody up to date with the sermon everybody already left the land of moab amen or somebody's still there maybe by marriage not yet we'll shake again the boat pretty good and make sure nobody says in the message because they were born in the message or because they were they got married in the message or the friend was in a message you need the solid anchor amen that is beyond that amen beyond your family relationship that is above your family relationship because your true family is the one that's going to go there amen whoever will not be there you're not going to see them anymore maybe they came from a different world maybe the underneath world like judah and they have to go back amen amen blessed be the name of the lord that just the word and it's a fact amen remember keep everything simple and we'll continue to rock the boat until we make sure you examine yourself and you know that you are in the faith that you are in the holy of holies amen don't get fooled if you don't have it you don't have it be the walk in the water without the holy ghost today if somebody walk in the water we give him the holy ghost right judah preached the gospel without the holy ghost and all the disciples preach the gospel without the holy ghost am i saying something different because the veil was closed and jesus could only bring them to the holy place that's why jesus justified them and jesus sanctified them in john 17 17 where the bible say you are sanctified with my word that's as far as jesus have to stop because he was not glorified yet but when he died and jesus rose again and they took judah out everybody then jesus began to call them children go look at the scripture because now those are the children of god then those can go to the pentecost where they enter the holy of holies then the holy spirit comes and still the same disciple amen so now we don't have to wait because the veil has been rent the hell has been went in the tabernacle and it also has been went up so your prayer can go straight and reach the throne of god amen so remember keep examining yourself don't fool yourself if you don't have it you don't have it amen and if you don't have it you got to get serious with god amen continue to pray with one another brother sean martin sent me a mail for his uh tenth meeting it's a faith uh it's a fifth tabernacle usually it's like a spring meeting something like that and it's gonna be from april the 27th to may 1st so i will give it to the deacon back there if anybody is interested in going there and if you want to go there and support the meeting and everything just talk to one of the deacons we keep everything here amen so remember if you want probably brother robert can remind me we can just as we get closer just give the announcement one more time because he send it to us amen how many knows by the sean martin he preached for us in a hotel he's a wonderful service a wonderful minister and we had a wonderful service so remember if you want to go there there is like some instruction on how to make your reservation and everything talk to the deacon we give you the information and you make sure you support the meeting amen if you can and you can go there it's good to support one another because he drove all the way there came down here with his family to support us when we were right at the beginning amen so if there is a chance go ahead and support the meeting amen all right we will call brother kelly he's the one ministering for us tonight pull on the gift of the lord and may lord the lord have his own way amen brother chip do we need to remind people of building fun okay so this coming sunday please remember building fun we still have a lot to do amen let's go we only believe [Music] all things are possible [Music] [Music] believe [Music] lord i believe lord i believe [Music] lord [Music] i believe [Music] lord i mean [Music] [Applause] yes [Music] [Music] hallelujah let us pray lord god we thank you for your grace your mercy lord jesus we thank you lord god for an opportunity once again lord god to come before a precious bride lord jesus father we look unto the hill to where our strength and our health cometh from so we know it comes from you lord jesus father because lord god we all gather here tonight father to hear from you you saw this day before the foundation of the world lord god thank you for receiving the songs of zion blessing musicians lord god and remember all those that are live streaming that had a desire and wanted to be here lord god but for some reason wasn't able to make it but lord god we pray and stand in the gap for those lord god brother michael and his wife lord jesus and those that are traveling on the highways lord god continue to watch over them lord jesus we ask you lord god remember the sick remember to shut in father continue to strengthen them in their families lord god so father we come here tonight lord god getting yourself out of the way lord jesus we come here in the name of the lord jesus christ if we come in any other name you're not able to back us you don't have to back us lord jesus so lord we bind up every spirit thank you for receiving the songs of zion on tonight father we thank you now lord god we need your anointing to come lord god and whatever you need to do tonight save souls heal the sick lord god deliver someone meet someone's financial need lord god let them know lord god that they're in your presence and when they're in your presence to salvation in your presence it's healing in your presence it's deliverance in your presence it's glory in your presence it's joy in your presence oh when they walk out of here let them say that not our hearts burned within us as you spoke to all of us along the way we give you praise we give you honor we give you glory and by faith we claim it all done in jesus name we pray amen and amen hallelujah amen i tell you i don't know why the pastors keep wanting this spare tire up here huh maybe i ought to go to a donut if i turn into a donut you think it stopped bothering me huh ah hallelujah you know it's an honor each time you get up here and you say lord you just want him say something to be able to help his people you know tonight so we won't prolong the time we want to go through as much as we can it's a thought that was thought i wanted to say but that's not what the lord wanted me to say tonight so i better stick with the boss let's go to genesis 3 once you have it say amen and it says genesis 3 and 1 says noun the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman ye have god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the tree may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest she die he said and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for god knoweth do it know that in the day he eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as god's knowing good and evil may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated i know it's wednesday night but we still going to knock the devil out ah they gonna know that's right brother said we're gonna knock him out huh because we got a word in his hour we got a word in this hour to beat the devil anywhere anytime any place on any ground okay so we have to own them we're playing churches over with is that right every promise is ours we're going to get in every soul that's out there we're going to bring them back is that right because the lord is now moving in and out we see times is winding up we see prophecies and things are being fulfilled in this hour here now oh and what a message sunday morning huh my my my my mind that's just the beginning of it hum brother robert do you see the grace how merciful our god is how graceful our god is how he did when bo asked bo as you know what he had both as no he had a special bullet didn't he both know that he could go to his god right that's why it's a message of grace if you don't see grace in this message sit down go to the altar now you can go to your private place and ask god to unfold it for you is that right it's all about the grace of god [Music] whoa motorbike wasn't even supposed to be in there huh brother sam hammond knight wasn't even supposed to be in there huh brother gray hallelujah but what we're looking at here tonight i got a rejecting the revealed word by deceit the revealed word by deceit see so we're going to understand now we're going to extend the mercy and grace that god put in us you know i got the inspiration of from satan's eating i was looking into satan's eating but the one thing that kept pricking my heart you know when brother branham was saying some things and about this age and and about it about the times even from the beginning eve didn't really want to be that like that she didn't wanted satan to see her with with the words is that right he came with trickery is that right he knew he he'll come with everything but one part of the word he'll leave it out is that right so we have to understand in this hour now who you are where you come from and why you are here is that right you already know that you are in the origin of god is that right you was there before the word came out is that right he said you were in the mind of god he said let there be what light is that right now the word that was in the mind of god became light is that right now you are that light you are now the manifested word that god is bringing into this age into this hour hallelujah if i don't if i don't get to all of it that's okay i'm gonna go the way he wants to go so you have to realize that satan he's a deceiver he's a deceiver but he's good he's a good adversary so we're going to find out from the beginning what sorcery how did brother branham say that the whole world is going to be deceived by sorcery is that right the scripture says over in revelation 18 that the whole world is going to respect the sea by what sorcery is that right so satan just doesn't come with sin and make it look bad is that right we know he doesn't come that way we know that in this hour here now and that a drunker they know where they're going if they die that way a drug addict they know where they're going if they die that way a prostitute know where she's going when they can say he too now huh when he or she is going to now if they leave here in that hour they know where they're going is that right but was the ones that think they're serving god we're coming out this simple but deep we're going to show you that's why he said we wrestle not against flesh and blood but form to come with eve with the word is that right he came with even with the word twisting the word he always perverted he's a pervert he's always changing the word up on somebody that's why they're coming in this hour here now it's disturbing the message up is that right you gotta imagine some of you can't imagine what's going out from here it's not just leaving locally it's going internationally so it's moving internationally so we're knocking every demon down that thought it was hidden because the word of god said he's giving us a promise is that right everything that is hidden he's going to root it up is that right he's going to uncover everything that this devil planted and what everything are precious brothers but it wasn't that what father son holy ghost everything that the reaper sold to the organized system is that right we're going to root it up it was acts 2 38 is that right that was a revelation of the word is that right we're going to move let me read some things to you because i'm telling you something you're living and satan's eating but in this satan's eating we're in laodicea but we're not of the world is that right we're on a total different mission that's why the lord has given us revelation of that tabernacle now that tabernacle that is giving us the revelation of now none moses never his generation he saw it one way is that right even though he got it from god but he saw it that way those that are lutheran lutheran saw it in their time is that right all those justifications just but they didn't even have the full revelation of justification that we have is that right they had the portion for that age they could still smoke a pipe he could still drink beer and still they're making it is that right some got stuck on that there saints but we're moving i'm telling you we're moving into something we're going to move rapture right on out of here this rapture can take place any day now everything is in place saints we got to understand they saying these things that we got we don't need god promised it and i thank god for him you're here because he put a seed inside of you to thirst for it [Music] yeah satan is in trouble i know good we're warring against his kingdom his religious kingdom we're going to tear down by the word of god because you can now go into the holiness of holy the veil's been ripped there's no playing when i tell you when the lord showed me that where paul moved at huh altar of innocence my god my god my god when you go in that project you come out of that private closet now i'm telling you now it's such a different anointing now you're not moving with something that you believe you know now god heard your prayers you know now he's moving for you god saved the best for last huh you could go in there for i don't want to get ahead of myself let me read this hallelujah yes he come look what he said i wanted to speak something to bring to enlighten the promises of god of this age he says not something that somebody else was in some other day he said them things are all right but we all refer to those things but i thought i would try to bring something to your mind if the scriptures that would enlighten you to know make you a better soldier on the field how are we getting somewhere he said now look because why you know you're a soldier you're a soldier of the cross we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principality and powers and wickedness and rulers in high places stop listening to the lies of the devil jesus christ took care of it on calvary when he shed his blood for each and every one of us is that right hallelujah at the cross at the cross where i first saw the light and the burdens of my heart rolled away it was there by faith i received my sight now i'm what i'm happy [Applause] let me tell you now look what he said he said now he said that wasn't like you said he said to no make you a better soldier in the field that you're fighting in that you're fighting it now to learn the tactics of the enemy so that you can block everything before it gets to you huh we're getting somewhere why did he give you the helmet of salvation is that right first way you're going to come and come into what your mind is that right huh but you don't listen to it don't even listen to his foolishness if it's not the word of god then you don't listen to it it's not just to show saints you stay in those texts i mean you stay in those conducting orders you stay in those church ages you stay in those seals um god is moving you into something you're going to find out there's nothing going to come out of you but the word is that right you're going to understand satan's tactics you're going to recognize how he's trying to come against you hallelujah you're in a real war spiritual war hallelujah he said now look he says that's the main thing to learn to keep the punches off of you see as much as you can okay he said now look he said there has been he said now let us look now there's not a day that's been like this day i don't believe there ever was a day that i've ever read in history that's been greater the greater days of persecution when the children of god was put to death on every hand but to see the deceitfulness see back in that time if you was a christian and you got over there and then they were so annoying it and they were so in love with god god at that time for them to stand for the word of god because they was a christian they would put in the lion's den or somewhere they were slaughtering but they felt nothing because the anointing of the lord was there to allow them to do those things we saying that's why the last time we was here we talked about preparation moses says them they couldn't move into what god called them to do until the anointing came on them david could not move until god told him to do until the anointing came on him they could not sham guard couldn't do what god was he was sick and tired of the devil taking their crops he could not move until the anointing came down on him the letter killer but the spirit given life we're talking about now about this holy ghost this holy ghost is real that's why he said when the when the holy ghost had a pastor talking about what the intellectual side is that right and then he talked about the uh um side with the pentecostal is that right some judgment said you received the word you received the word and then you got the holy ghost because you're walking in the end time message no no no no no no no no brother brian i'm saying why the power comes then you receive the word that's the sign of the holy ghost then being there say everything that he said huh we got to understand now he sent what those seals to fill every gap we're going to read something about this intellectual demon we're going to read something about these religious demons just bear witness tonight he's not because when the holy ghost tell you you're in the outer court justification nobody's de-christianizing you he's only trying to show you where you're at is that right huh and then they couldn't go anywhere when when marion had the leprosy and they put the leprosy on it for seven days they couldn't go nowhere is that right because she had the leprosy we can't go nowhere if any y'all still in justification how are we gonna move we can't leave you we're not gonna lose the world your family [Music] let us think in when sanctification comes huh say by the washing of the water of the world when that comes in he's only showing you where you're at so you can catch up and there they come with the what someday they got the baptism of the holy ghost is that right and still living like the devil stop lying on god the holy ghost is power power to walk right power to talk right power delivery right power to think right power to sing right power to do right it's power [Applause] it's all about the power of god now dwelling inside of someone huh but he can't dwell in an unclean vessel he won't do it hallelujah anyhow help me lord he said look but to see but to see the deceitfulness of the enemy we've never had a day like this we're now living in you see he says it's the most cunning deceitful day and and when i see that it brings this that christian has to be more on his toes today than ever was in any age huh satan coming to knock you out let me give you a scripture let's look at the first peter in one look what he says for the sake of time lord look at verse one i tell you what we'll start at verse three we're talking about the c4h once you have it say amen first peter chapter one and let's start at verse three blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundance what mercy have have been gotten us again into a what lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from
