[15:10] testimony on their heart this evening
[15:12] they would like to share brother
[15:15] [Music]
[15:20] [Applause]
[15:21] um god bless y'all
[15:25] i have a testimony like on monday early
[15:28] in the morning when my dad was about to
[15:29] go to work
[15:31] on his way to work there were he was
[15:35] it was a red light and a car came behind
[15:38] him
[15:38] as the red light was turning to green a
[15:41] car came behind him and after that hit
[15:43] him from the back
[15:44] the shock made him somewhat unbalanced
[15:48] but he hold it on to the break
[15:51] and he had to go to the hospital for a
[15:53] checkup so it's kind of like a testimony
[15:55] and a prayer request
[15:57] so i want to thank god for saving him
[16:01] and protecting him through that time and
[16:03] that accident
[16:04] and right now he still has a little bit
[16:07] of
[16:07] headache every now and then and still
[16:09] feels a bit of pain so i asked if y'all
[16:11] could
[16:12] remember him in your prayers
[16:15] amen
[16:21] does anybody else have a testimony this
[16:23] evening
[16:24] does anybody have a prayer request
[16:28] i have a prayer request on the way to uh
[16:30] on the way to church tonight we are
[16:32] going down 321 and we passed a car that
[16:35] i don't know if there was an accident i
[16:36] think there was another car involved so
[16:38] i think there was an accident but the
[16:39] car went up into a guard rail
[16:41] and the whole front end was destroyed
[16:43] and by the time we passed
[16:45] there was no one in the car and there
[16:46] was no ambulance on the scene so i'm
[16:48] sure whoever was in the car was was
[16:50] taken by the ambulance to the hospital
[16:51] so we'll just remember that in prayer
[16:54] anybody else have a prayer request
[17:00] okay brother lemon and sister gene and
[17:02] then also brother greg
[17:04] wanted me to announce that joe green at

[17:14] this year they're not going to be

[17:17] church this year so if you
[17:19] need an address to the church i don't
[17:21] know if brother greg has it or if you
[17:23] want to see one of the deacons we can
[17:25] we can get the address over to one of

[30:12] amen i i really had a special and uh
[30:15] i hope that didn't take all my time but
[30:17] um
[30:19] as the prophet was given that
[30:22] vision of the mamba the lord had told
[30:25] him that he needed a
[30:27] greater consecration he needed to be
[30:30] more sincere and that has been my heart
[30:34] the past two weeks and i'll just would i
[30:36] like to share this song
[30:38] with you please
[30:47] it's called a new consecration
[31:03] i hear the call
[31:09] calling me
[31:12] to my father's house where there's a
[31:15] place
[31:16] prepared for me
[31:20] like a lost son i wandered in the world
[31:24] of sin
[31:26] but his love beckons me
[31:30] to return to him
[31:34] and this is god's call
[31:38] to a new consecration
[31:44] i'm cold to a deeper dedication
[31:51] i'm called to be one with my theophany
[31:58] and to live eternally in my glorified
[32:03] body
[32:05] [Music]
[32:08] i mean i'm gonna pick up the beat oh
[32:11] i'm seeing things
[32:17] that i lack
[32:20] as you shine your light i'm searching
[32:23] diligently to find them back
[32:28] every virtue must be in me when you come
[32:34] for i'm called into the full statue
[32:38] of a perfect man
[32:42] and this is god's call
[32:47] to a new consecration
[32:52] i'm called to a deeper dedication
[32:59] i'm called to be one with my theophany
[33:06] and to live eternally in my glorified
[33:11] body
[33:13] [Music]
[33:15] i'm moving out
[33:19] into higher realms
[33:22] with great expectation for the
[33:25] supernatural
[33:27] to take place
[33:30] the time has come for this
[33:36] reality when
[33:38] the impossible must be manifested in
[33:43] me and this is
[33:47] god's call to a new consecration
[33:54] and i'm called to a deeper dedication
[34:02] i'm called to be one with

[38:00] hallelujah amen
[38:04] amen everybody happy tonight
[38:09] ready for the word did you kick the
[38:12] mamba down
[38:14] remember he's not going to do anything
[38:17] except
[38:18] god gave him the permission
[38:21] amen if he didn't get a permission there
[38:24] is
[38:24] nothing nothing not even deaf life
[38:28] nothing amen i had a question
[38:32] because the last verse we used was uh
[38:35] roman
[38:36] where the bible says nothing so
[38:40] i'm persuaded that nothing shall
[38:43] separate us and i say death what is
[38:47] separation death separation death
[38:49] separation death
[38:50] i was trying to drive a point there is a
[38:53] death
[38:54] physical that happened in the body
[38:56] physical
[38:57] amen and the devil will not touch you
[39:01] if the lord have not finished with you
[39:04] as long as the lord
[39:05] has a plan and a purpose on this earth
[39:07] you will not die even if they take you
[39:09] put you on a hot pot bowling you with
[39:13] oil like they did uh john the revelator
[39:16] they could not kill him because he was
[39:18] not time yet amen
[39:20] they took jesus push him all the way to
[39:22] the cliff could not do anything the
[39:24] bible say he walked
[39:25] pass through them and nobody could touch
[39:27] him until
[39:29] the time happened amen so not only
[39:32] that we have a security for a few
[39:35] a physical death we also have security
[39:39] in our spiritual soul when you are born
[39:43] again
[39:44] make sense now now nothing
[39:47] can separate you from the love of
[39:50] god the love of god the capstone
[39:54] crust in your heart there is nothing
[39:57] that can separate you from the love of
[39:59] god nothing can bring you
[40:01] death again to your soul no matter
[40:05] tribulation peril famine hunger
[40:08] whatever the devil is going to do there
[40:11] will not be
[40:12] anything that can come to your soul and
[40:15] separate you from your maker
[40:16] nothing amen brother branham found
[40:19] himself
[40:20] cornered his child dying over there
[40:23] his wife dying over there but i'm saying
[40:26] all everything that the devil was
[40:28] telling me was true
[40:30] but down deep in the soul something rose
[40:33] up he said he could not tell me
[40:35] that christ does not exist because i saw
[40:38] him
[40:38] that one nothing can separate you amen
[40:42] so security in the body security also in
[40:46] the
[40:46] soul amen we sang about the mamba
[40:50] the mamba remember when we talk about
[40:52] the feast of the seven days
[40:54] amen you remember the pavement was made
[40:57] out of red
[40:59] i hope somebody listened to that sermon
[41:01] again it was made out of red
[41:03] black white which were the three horse
[41:06] rather
[41:07] and the other color was blue which was
[41:10] the color of the breath of the mamba
[41:12] they were in the pavement amen
[41:15] that's where the seven fist was going on
[41:18] but the pavement is something
[41:20] that is under your feet whatever is
[41:22] under your feet
[41:23] you can kick him down you can throw upon
[41:26] it amen
[41:27] the way like i said the way the book of
[41:29] esther is written it's like the book of
[41:31] revelation
[41:33] if you go to revelation chapter 2 and
[41:35] chapter 3
[41:36] it speaks about the seven church ages it
[41:39] tells you about the seven messenger the
[41:41] seventh star
[41:42] and everything and all the name of the
[41:44] seven church ages but if you go to
[41:46] revelation
[41:47] 14 it's speaking also of the seven
[41:50] church ages
[41:52] but he put an emphasis on the three last
[41:54] angels
[41:55] you remember one have the gospel of
[41:57] righteousness
[41:59] the other one was luther wesley and then
[42:01] the third one was
[42:03] william marion branham so when you deal
[42:06] with the book of revelation
[42:08] you got to take revelation 2 and
[42:10] revelation 3 you put it together then
[42:12] you go grab revelation
[42:14] 14 then you put it there then you go
[42:16] grab revelation 6
[42:18] then you put the seals together then you
[42:20] go grab the trumpet
[42:22] and you bring it there then you go grab
[42:24] everything and before you know it
[42:25] you will see the full image coming out
[42:28] like this
[42:29] if the lord terry one of this day we're
[42:31] gonna line all of them up the seals
[42:33] and the church edges and uh and the
[42:35] seventh week of daniel
[42:37] and go all the way and you're gonna see
[42:38] it's like a beautiful story of
[42:40] redemption up and down
[42:42] up and down all the way to the new
[42:44] jerusalem and you're going to see it
[42:46] amen
[42:47] so when you look at esther on chapter
[42:49] one there is a feast of seven days
[42:51] that is your seven church ages but he
[42:53] also gives you a clue of the seventh
[42:55] chamberlain
[42:56] which are the seventh spirit that work
[42:58] that came in the constellation
[43:00] so now when you go it gives you again a
[43:02] feast of three days
[43:03] which is the three step again which is
[43:05] luther
[43:06] wesley pentecost but a man was killed on
[43:09] the fourth
[43:10] day go read the book of esther
[43:14] go read it again over amen
[43:18] esther fasted for three days the first
[43:20] day
[43:21] the second day the third day was the
[43:23] first banquet
[43:25] amen then esther requested a second
[43:28] banquet which is the
[43:30] fourth day amen it is the white horse
[43:33] rider
[43:33] the red horse rider the black one
[43:37] then the fourth one there is three four
[43:40] messenger that kills the tree
[43:42] and there are also four messengers that
[43:45] restore the life
[43:47] go read the restoration of the bad tree
[43:49] church you need a gig in the word
[43:52] amen how many are reading the c.o.d
[43:56] if you don't you're going to get lost
[43:58] because i'm shooting up
[44:00] amen make sure you stay tight with the
[44:03] message if not
[44:04] you will wonder we already finished with
[44:06] the black dog territory
[44:08] we are soaring into the air like ego
[44:10] amen
[44:11] so it's time to rise up and to kick him
[44:14] down
[44:14] everybody clear so far if it's a jargon
[44:18] shoot me a text then we can handle it
[44:20] tonight we have brother kelly
[44:22] who's going to be preaching for us
[44:24] brother kelly is one of our local

[48:16] let's look at verse one we read the
[48:18] first three verses
[48:22] and i say amen okay
[48:25] i therefore the prisoner
[48:29] of the lord see that was a commandment
[48:31] to paul
[48:32] he was a prisoner he said beseech you
[48:35] that ye
[48:35] walk worthy of vocation wherewith
[48:39] ye are called it says with all
[48:43] loneliness and meekness
[48:45] with long-suffering forbearing one
[48:47] another in love
[48:50] endeavoring see diligently to keep the
[48:53] unity
[48:54] of the spirit in the bond of peace
[48:58] may the lord have a blessing to the
[48:59] reading of his word you may be seated
[49:02] you know here we we got the inspiration
[49:05] i tell you i was going to
[49:07] i i i wanted to look at another area but
[49:10] i tell you as the pastor always say he's
[49:13] the boss
[49:14] you know so i couldn't get away from
[49:16] this so it's like a long sunday school
[49:18] lesson so don't
[49:19] don't worry about it i got my timer set
[49:20] here we're not going to
[49:22] keep you alone by the grace of god but
[49:23] we want him to have his way okay
[49:27] and you know we got the inspiration
[49:30] from the uniting
[49:33] time in sign
[49:37] in the unity of one god into one church
[49:42] and uniting with the word and spirit is
[49:44] our topic
[49:45] is uniting with the word in the spirit
[49:48] see so when we look here in
[49:52] ephesians you know we're talking about
[49:55] believers paul was speaking to believers
[49:57] here
[49:58] and with these believers what we're
[50:00] saying now he's showing us
[50:02] how the way that we should walk
[50:05] but everything that we should be led by
[50:07] should be led by the holy spirit
[50:10] he's showing us that you know we should
[50:12] be united with one with the spirit in
[50:15] his time now
[50:17] you know it's it's united time it's the
[50:20] end time
[50:21] the science is all around us it's a
[50:24] joyous time
[50:25] it's a glorious time for the believer
[50:28] things
[50:29] you know we're going to read some things
[50:30] tonight the last time we were here
[50:32] you know we were talking about the
[50:34] cities of refuge
[50:36] and we were showing you those refugees
[50:38] had specific names
[50:40] and for you to get in that city we know
[50:42] that you
[50:43] there's no condemnation who those that
[50:46] are in christ
[50:46] jesus is that right so we know at that
[50:49] time
[50:50] all of us the joy of the lord is our
[50:52] strength is that right
[50:54] restore unto me the joy of our salvation
[50:57] so we're going to show you we should be
[50:59] the happiest people here
[51:01] in the land because we are united with
[51:04] the
[51:04] almighty god is that right we are
[51:07] co-workers is that right
[51:09] that's what we are looking at being
[51:11] connected with god
[51:13] in this hour here now and that's why
[51:16] when you had
[51:17] the holy spirit had to pass the minister
[51:20] you know he said some
[51:21] sunday says some have trouble being what
[51:24] born again
[51:24] is that right so you're having trouble
[51:27] truly being born again
[51:29] then you need to get the understanding
[51:31] why you can get it
[51:32] see repentance is a gift to you right
[51:35] now
[51:37] repent this is granted unto you a godly
[51:40] sorrow
[51:41] being a godly repentance that you don't
[51:43] have to be repented of anymore
[51:45] the only way the only one can unite to
[51:48] with god is god he's the only one that
[51:51] can unite you with himself
[51:53] is that right so we want to read so we
[51:56] have a lot here tonight by the grace of
[51:58] god but
[51:59] when the time would go off then the lord
[52:01] tell us to stop
[52:02] we'll stop but just be prayerful with us
[52:04] be mindful with us we know it's a
[52:06] wednesday night

[52:10] around but we want you to give us a
[52:12] spiritual ear tonight

[52:34] you can't use the
[52:35] mind let the holy spirit bring it to you
[52:37] is that right huh
[52:39] hallelujah he said now look he said now
[52:42] you know
[52:43] god made man to be an achiever
[52:47] we should never be living a low life we
[52:50] should always live a victorious life
[52:53] is that right brother steve i didn't
[52:56] take it lightly
[52:57] about that fly you know why because let
[53:00] me tell you i've been looking for this

[53:03] huh this isn't but a 8.88
[53:07] watch that i got from walmart is that
[53:09] right
[53:10] but i used to work in this watch because
[53:12] i didn't want to wear my good watch to
[53:14] work
[53:14] so i wanted to wear this watch it and i
[53:17] found this watch i said i didn't find it
[53:19] the lord brought it to me is that right
[53:22] when i looked in there it was in one of
[53:23] my pants pockets
[53:25] i don't know if god put it there or not
[53:27] but i know i prayed and i'd ask god for
[53:29] this watch and hear that
[53:31] huh so i tell you the lord is good you
[53:34] give him thanks i tell you
[53:36] he's a miraculous god okay
[53:39] and he's a miraculous guy and benjamin
[53:42] you hold on is that right
[53:44] because your mama god's going to perform
[53:46] a miraculous work on your mama is that
[53:48] right
[53:49] we standing we got to believe this way
[53:52] now it's no
[53:53] tomorrow we believe when the omnipotent
[53:55] meet the omnipotent
[53:57] the miraculous have to happen
[54:00] we putting god's word to test now
[54:03] there's no tomorrow this is the last
[54:05] stage saints
[54:06] that's why jesus talked about more of
[54:08] his second coming
[54:09] it's the science united time of the
[54:12] end time it's the signs that god has
[54:15] given us
[54:16] hallelujah help us lord he said now you
[54:19] know god has made man to
[54:21] chief that's what man was made for and
[54:24] all down through life
[54:25] he was trying to achieve something and
[54:28] his achievement the reason he tries that
[54:31] is because he was so designed to do so
[54:34] god designed him to be an achiever
[54:36] god did not design you to be a loser god
[54:39] denied them not to design you
[54:41] to be defeated we have to go to trials
[54:44] we have to go to tests
[54:45] but he told labor abraham what you shall
[54:48] possess
[54:49] the gates of the enemy after the trial
[54:52] we all got to be tried and tested is
[54:54] that right
[54:55] but god foreknew he put you in laodicea
[54:59] because he knew that you were going to
[55:01] forsake
[55:02] the test is that right he knew it saying
[55:08] god made him that way he said but the
[55:11] trouble of it is
[55:12] in his achievement he tries to do
[55:15] something within himself
[55:18] he said there's where he makes his
[55:20] mistake and he gets in trouble
[55:23] you see so we're talking about brother
[55:26] robert
[55:26] kicking the devil out we exposing his
[55:29] tactics tonight is that right
[55:32] you got to understand your enemy we
[55:35] wrestle not against flesh and blood
[55:37] but against principalities and powers
[55:39] and wickedness and rulers
[55:40] in high places but god has given you
[55:43] what he said put on the whole armor of
[55:45] god
[55:45] so the human baby with the wild be able
[55:47] to withstand
[55:49] the wilds and the trickeries of the
[55:51] devil in his end time is that right
[55:54] god told us we will not be deceased is
[55:56] that right
[55:57] so that shouldn't be a concern even in
[56:00] your thoughts
[56:01] because you say we will not be deceived
[56:06] hallelujah yeah we're going to ambush
[56:09] you tonight
[56:10] he said now look oh brother i gotta
[56:12] remember your back there brother keller
[56:14] help me lord he said there he says now
[56:17] in the beginning of genesis see
[56:19] he says he says now god on the highest
[56:23] life
[56:24] is man which is the image of god
[56:30] you are the highly image of god
[56:34] god has chose you to be his image in
[56:36] this end time
[56:38] you're going to find out why they're
[56:39] getting this word when they're getting
[56:42] this word the mysteries being unfolded
[56:44] it shouldn't be any question to anyone
[56:46] any longer
[56:47] because god came and showed us what is
[56:50] that it was there to increase your faith
[56:52] in this end time hour
[56:59] he says and in this life man begin to
[57:02] achieve
[57:03] things but when when he
[57:06] begin to leave god out of the picture
[57:09] the last time we was here we told you
[57:12] that
[57:12] even brother branham quoted he said you
[57:16] will if you
[57:16] always address god
[57:20] and go to god before anything you do
[57:23] you will always be successful
[57:26] [Music]
[57:28] he's giving us the instructions but we
[57:31] getting to get them moving and want to
[57:33] move in our own way
[57:35] in our own self-esteem i asked god for
[57:40] this year to give me
[57:41] words to get down in the soul we need
[57:44] some
[57:44] soul food noun is that right because
[57:47] people are being deceived
[57:50] when the god came he told your body
[57:53] spirit and soul we consist of is that
[57:55] right
[57:56] the five senses he gave us to contact
[57:59] this earth
[58:00] with sea taste fill and smell is that
[58:04] right
[58:04] and then for the free more will this is
[58:08] what he's talking about here
[58:10] some of you think it's the holy spirit
[58:12] and it's not the holy spirit
[58:14] it's your spirit that's telling you to
[58:16] go do things
[58:18] the holy spirit will line up with the
[58:20] scriptures
[58:23] [Applause]
[58:26] in their spirit memory reasoning
[58:30] conscious affection those are the
[58:32] avenues that satan
[58:34] can move and trick you on
[58:38] huh we're in a war a spiritual war
[58:42] that's why over in ezekiel he said he
[58:45] had to give you another spirit
[58:47] to tolerate yourself is that right
[58:52] we're talking about a war we're talking
[58:55] about exposing these things
[58:57] that satan is trying to trick the
[58:58] elected bride with
[59:00] but as we first came in here the devil
[59:02] ain't coming up in here
[59:04] he might as well forget about it why
[59:06] because this is the almighty god's
[59:08] church
[59:09] and this is the king the holy ghost runs
[59:11] this
[59:12] church the holy ghost runs his people
[59:15] the holy ghost is in charge of this the
[59:17] spirit of god
[59:19] we are uniting with the spirit of god
[59:23] [Applause]
[59:23] [Music]
[59:27] see look what he says he says now
[59:31] he made he says now and when
[59:34] we find let me go ahead god don't say
[59:37] and then
[59:38] in this life man begin to achieve things
[59:42] but when he did it he began to leave god
[59:44] out of the picture
[59:45] he began to have a selfish motive and
[59:48] when he did that
[59:49] he began to think of something for what
[59:55] [Applause]
[59:58] himself
[1:00:05] tonight you'll be set free in that area
[1:00:08] huh
[1:00:08] you can praise and you can rejoice okay
[1:00:12] the joy of the lord you never let the
[1:00:14] devil steal your joy
[1:00:16] if you seek god first seek ye first the
[1:00:19] kingdom of god
[1:00:20] and his righteousness and all other
[1:00:22] things will be added unto you
[1:00:25] the critic says he says now
[1:00:29] he says and we find that it isn't long
[1:00:32] until he had corrupt the
[1:00:35] the very planet that god had put him on
[1:00:40] he had in such a condition till even his
[1:00:43] creator grieved
[1:00:45] him at his heart that he had ever made
[1:00:48] amen
[1:00:49] and you can imagine how god felt
[1:00:52] when he seen the very creature that he
[1:00:56] made in his image
[1:00:57] and give him domain and how that he made
[1:01:00] and made him to do something for him
[1:01:04] and yet he returned all of his strength
[1:01:08] and his power over to the selfish
[1:01:10] desires and achievements
[1:01:14] sound like god won't address that
[1:01:16] selfish demon tonight from somewhere
[1:01:19] huh we don't know where it is
[1:01:22] he's in charge that's what he did with
[1:01:25] samson
[1:01:25] when he looked at samson is that right
[1:01:27] when he looked at eve is that right
[1:01:29] it hurt the father it hurt god when he
[1:01:32] seen him walking around their images
[1:01:34] when they see those that's walking
[1:01:36] around trouble with
[1:01:38] drug demons trouble with alcohol demons
[1:01:41] trouble with lust demons trouble with
[1:01:43] pornography demons
[1:01:45] trouble with lesbian demons trouble with
[1:01:47] homosexual demons
[1:01:49] trouble with heroin demons trouble with
[1:01:51] these demons
[1:01:52] trouble with gambling demons hit some of
[1:01:55] his children
[1:01:56] locked up out there and traveling with
[1:01:58] those demons they just don't realize yet
[1:02:01] that they are not children of
[1:02:03] disobedience
[1:02:04] they are challenged and daughters of the
[1:02:07] most high god
[1:02:09] they are just are among the children of
[1:02:12] disobedience
[1:02:13] and god send the gospel the gospel word
[1:02:16] to do what
[1:02:17] to set them free
[1:02:22] hallelujah he says and then
[1:02:26] we find it isn't too long after this
[1:02:28] great lesson that god taught the man
[1:02:31] during the time by destroying the entire
[1:02:33] world
[1:02:34] is that it just seemed like that man
[1:02:37] can't learn
[1:02:38] ah you see what god the holy spirit told
[1:02:42] us
[1:02:43] you see what your brother if he's
[1:02:45] prospering he told cain
[1:02:47] cain even because you came out first
[1:02:51] if you do what you brother do i won't
[1:02:54] even put you over him
[1:02:57] but he couldn't do it
[1:03:01] he's telling you it's the the is he the
[1:03:04] faith
[1:03:04] or the doubt it's a faith that's working
[1:03:07] by love now
[1:03:09] they get around in there that's why god
[1:03:11] is bringing
[1:03:12] his elect loved the word they love the
[1:03:15] mysteries
[1:03:17] let me keep going hallelujah help me
[1:03:19] lord
[1:03:21] he says then he says and his children
[1:03:25] only through the hard way we find that
[1:03:28] even in our children we have to
[1:03:30] punish them many times serve to make
[1:03:33] them
[1:03:33] understand it just seems like that a man
[1:03:36] is just in himself a total failure to
[1:03:40] begin with
[1:03:40] see that's why the lord said train up a
[1:03:42] child in a way that he should go
[1:03:45] when he grow old he won't depart from it
[1:03:48] see some children you can use the words
[1:03:50] of wisdom
[1:03:51] and they'll straighten up and some of
[1:03:53] them you've got to whip them on the
[1:03:54] behind
[1:03:55] is that right you just got to do it
[1:03:57] sometimes
[1:03:58] and some of them some parents today got
[1:04:01] problem doing that
[1:04:02] they're letting the child tell them what
[1:04:04] to do huh
[1:04:06] yeah the children telling them what to
[1:04:08] do in this hour here now
[1:04:10] you know how you're going to handle he
[1:04:12] that is faithful with little will be
[1:04:13] faithful as much
[1:04:16] if you can't spanking when it's time to
[1:04:17] get spanking how you going to have a
[1:04:19] thus say to the lord
[1:04:26] he said now look he says
[1:04:30] he says when when we lost his
[1:04:32] relationship with god
[1:04:35] he become a unit of his own he didn't
[1:04:38] depend on god no more
[1:04:40] see and when god had taught him the
[1:04:43] lesson
[1:04:44] of what it was to try to do something
[1:04:47] within himself
[1:04:48] that his works would all come to naught
[1:04:51] see it's not going to amount to nothing
[1:04:53] anyway see they thinking this out here
[1:04:56] now
[1:04:57] material things is a prosperous thing no
[1:05:00] it's not
[1:05:00] all the time
[1:05:04] you got to examine your your motive and
[1:05:06] your exactly exact
[1:05:08] objection with the lord you can't fool
[1:05:11] god
[1:05:11] i can't fool god none of us can fool god
[1:05:15] god understands the heart god pour the
[1:05:17] reigns on the heart
[1:05:19] god tries the heart he made us all
[1:05:25] what do you do you can you want to be
[1:05:28] free
[1:05:29] you want to be free all you have to do
[1:05:31] is accept the truth
[1:05:32] the truth is what makes you free
[1:05:36] [Applause]
[1:05:39] don't sit up there with your heart our
[1:05:41] heart somebody and
[1:05:42] god's going this way i had no intentions
[1:05:44] on going this way
[1:05:46] he said look what he said he said god
[1:05:50] and when god taught him the lesson he
[1:05:52] said himself that his works he would
[1:05:54] come
[1:05:54] come to naught immediately we find them
[1:05:57] again going right down to achieve again
[1:06:00] he says in the bible said that they
[1:06:02] built them a tower
[1:06:03] and they were going to climb up into the
[1:06:05] heavens to get
[1:06:06] up into heaven without coming the way
[1:06:09] god had planned
[1:06:10] for them to come you see then god has to
[1:06:14] provide a way
[1:06:15] how are you going to be successful going
[1:06:17] against the lord
[1:06:19] huh no way
[1:06:23] look what he told him he says that man
[1:06:26] can achieve better when they are united
[1:06:29] together
[1:06:30] you see what i'm saying but we are
[1:06:33] united together
[1:06:34] god's order is a pastor he got
[1:06:38] deacons he got trustees he got
[1:06:41] treasurers
[1:06:42] he got song leaders he has musicians
[1:06:45] you see if this old clock here this
[1:06:48] whole watch here
[1:06:50] and one thing is out of order
[1:06:59] yes sir you can put on a pastor
[1:07:04] you can weigh him down now when we come
[1:07:07] here for the word god
[1:07:08] who can pour your beacon when it's time
[1:07:11] for him to go
[1:07:12] pray for somebody or visit the sick god
[1:07:15] is that right when your trustees has
[1:07:17] things to do
[1:07:18] but when you're musicians if you're out
[1:07:20] of place if this watch is not
[1:07:22] if something inside of it is running not
[1:07:25] right it's going to bring things out of
[1:07:27] order it will
[1:07:28] not keep the right time
[1:07:31] [Music]
[1:07:33] got too much going on this is god it's
[1:07:35] god's work
[1:07:36] it's god's work god's sympathy
[1:07:40] god sent you there god showed you this
[1:07:42] sunday
[1:07:43] you're not leaving here until he's
[1:07:44] finished with you huh he's got a purpose
[1:07:47] for us all
[1:07:52] look what he says he says when you got
[1:07:55] he said now look
[1:07:57] you're denying it together he says now
[1:07:59] you take one man by himself
[1:08:01] his power is limited to one man he said
[1:08:04] two men
[1:08:05] his twice the strength for men
[1:08:09] he makes them four times the strength
[1:08:11] god wants us to be one
[1:08:14] god made man when when we should be one
[1:08:18] our motives should be won
[1:08:22] they was up in the upper room is that
[1:08:24] right their motive
[1:08:25] and their objective was one is that
[1:08:28] right
[1:08:29] it was to do the will of the lord
[1:08:31] because they know
[1:08:32] if they came down here without what
[1:08:35] brother robert
[1:08:36] being united with god
[1:08:39] is that right oh death would come at
[1:08:42] them
[1:08:42] those jews would kill them they would
[1:08:44] persecute them
[1:08:45] they could not come out of there being
[1:08:48] in one with god
[1:08:49] you have to be one with god that's why
[1:08:52] the holy spirit was telling you
[1:08:54] young men young women you when you got
[1:08:57] friends out there pray for them please
[1:09:00] for them
[1:09:01] that they be a christian first before

[1:09:07] this is the order of god being united
[1:09:11] with god
[1:09:12] being united with the word of god
[1:09:16] look what he says he says god made
[1:09:20] them he said he said god made man
[1:09:23] that we should be one and our motives
[1:09:25] should be won
[1:09:26] our objectives should be won our
[1:09:29] achievements should be won
[1:09:30] he's just designed that way that's what
[1:09:34] he said

[1:09:50] there
[1:09:51] why because the end time signs
[1:09:54] is that right they're not why it's
[1:09:57] because
[1:09:58] they have no desire to do the will of
[1:10:01] god
[1:10:02] their desire was to go back to their
[1:10:04] unrighteous
[1:10:05] filthy living
[1:10:08] [Applause]
[1:10:10] he said be transformed i beseech
[1:10:14] you brothers be he transformed he said
[1:10:17] be ye not conform

[1:10:25] mind your spirit and soul works together
[1:10:29] is that right
[1:10:32] we getting it that's why we said those
[1:10:35] avenues
[1:10:36] those five avenues that you get into
[1:10:40] your spiritual realm
[1:10:41] that's self-will that's according to
[1:10:45] your will
[1:10:46] you can't blame nobody else
[1:10:49] because we have the word and we got all
[1:10:51] heaven back in us
[1:10:53] so we got to understand you got the lord
[1:10:56] lean not to your own understanding
[1:11:00] we got to understand god has given us of
[1:11:02] thus

[1:12:56] year and he opened that letter that
[1:12:58] letters
[1:12:59] he testified that jesus christ was the
[1:13:02] messiah
[1:13:04] and listen to that now they thought he
[1:13:06] was out of his mind
[1:13:08] that he was out of his mind but look at
[1:13:11] us
[1:13:11] we know that anyone that professed that
[1:13:15] they're in their right mind
[1:13:18] he said a self-driving car is that right

[1:14:17] brother greg was telling me about over
[1:14:19] there in uh syria
[1:14:20] was it that they are rushing them want
[1:14:22] to go over there and want to

[1:14:49] one a falling away
[1:14:51] from the what truth falling away from
[1:14:53] the truth gotta come
[1:14:55] first is that right first remember
[1:14:58] israel for israel when titus overtook
[1:15:02] jerusalem first the jews had to reject
[1:15:05] the word is that right
[1:15:08] now so you have to understand then
[1:15:11] after they rejected the word then the
[1:15:14] national then the military force
[1:15:16] move in is that right and after the
[1:15:19] military force they come

[1:15:34] brother out of falling away they had to
[1:15:37] move away from us

[1:16:04] let me examine the king of the prophets
[1:16:08] the lord jesus the day that we are
[1:16:10] living in is so much greater than when
[1:16:12] he was here
[1:16:14] he spoke more of his second coming
[1:16:18] than he did of his going away
[1:16:21] he says search the scriptures he says
[1:16:24] before he's going away
[1:16:26] he prophesies of things that would take
[1:16:29] place
[1:16:29] in this day he must be they said he must
[1:16:33] be crucified
[1:16:34] he knew he would rise from the grave
[1:16:38] on the third day there was no power
[1:16:42] to break that prophecy hallelujah
[1:16:46] living he love me dying he saved me
[1:16:50] bury he carried my sins far away
[1:16:53] rising he justified hallelujah
[1:16:57] is that right brother singapore
[1:17:00] hallelujah
[1:17:02] what are we talking about his question
[1:17:04] was not
[1:17:05] whether he would be crucified he would
[1:17:07] he would rise again
[1:17:09] or whether he would ascend on high or
[1:17:11] whether that wasn't his question
[1:17:13] he would send back because why he would
[1:17:16] send back the holy ghost is that right
[1:17:18] so you and i can be united with him
[1:17:21] again
[1:17:22] that's what we're talking about united
[1:17:24] times in the end time
[1:17:26] we're being united with the holy ghost
[1:17:29] the holy ghost
[1:17:30] and us are becoming one is that right
[1:17:32] and with god
[1:17:33] we are co-workers with him he would send
[1:17:36] back the holy ghost
[1:17:37] his question was would there be any
[1:17:40] faith
[1:17:41] on the earth at his second coming
[1:17:44] will he find people who believes the end
[1:17:48] time necessary
[1:17:50] and standing on the word let me keep
[1:17:52] going hallelujah
[1:17:55] look what he said he says now the end
[1:17:58] time
[1:18:00] sign he says they plan it he says god
[1:18:03] let me turn this in he says in all the
[1:18:06] time
[1:18:06] these things are going on the spirit of
[1:18:09] the living god
[1:18:10] is constantly striving with the flesh
[1:18:14] trying to get man away from his own
[1:18:17] achievements
[1:18:18] [Music]
[1:18:20] they see his family everything around
[1:18:22] them are failing
[1:18:23] and they still won't turn to god he says
[1:18:26] look
[1:18:27] he says trying to get man away from his
[1:18:30] own achievement trying to get man away
[1:18:32] from his own
[1:18:33] selfish motives he says then an
[1:18:36] objective
[1:18:36] a to a plan which god has laid down
[1:18:40] god has laid in pain the footsteps of
[1:18:42] the righteous is ordered of the lord
[1:18:45] he said and as long as a man works work
[1:18:48] his own plan
[1:18:50] he will be a failure
[1:18:58] why do you think your pastor in other
[1:19:00] words are successful
[1:19:02] is because they're not working their
[1:19:06] plan
[1:19:08] they're following the order of god's
[1:19:10] plan
[1:19:12] and then when they achieve it they give
[1:19:14] god the praise
[1:19:16] they give god the glory they give god
[1:19:18] the thanks
[1:19:19] and god gets the blessings god gets the
[1:19:22] testimonies
[1:19:27] he said look he says now and a man
[1:19:31] can only achieve right when he comes
[1:19:33] back
[1:19:34] with the right objective and motive
[1:19:37] and that is according to god's plan
[1:19:40] for him any other foundation
[1:19:45] is sinking sad
[1:19:48] he said upon this rock i'll build my
[1:19:51] church
[1:19:52] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:19:54] against it
[1:19:56] he built his church upon the revelation
[1:19:59] of the word
[1:20:00] that god has brought the revelation of
[1:20:03] who jesus
[1:20:04] christ is is that right that's the only
[1:20:07] way a man
[1:20:08] when you're going to be born again to be
[1:20:11] born again
[1:20:12] god's got to bring to you the revelation
[1:20:15] of jesus christ
[1:20:17] in jesus christ he's the son of god and
[1:20:20] he's
[1:20:20] god he was the son of god and god he was
[1:20:23] the heart
[1:20:24] he was the mind he was the soul of god
[1:20:27] and he came and he walked on this earth
[1:20:30] and
[1:20:30] children we all are children of god
[1:20:34] he was the example as a son to show us
[1:20:37] that he would live a victorious life if
[1:20:40] you're obedient
[1:20:42] unto the word of god that's what god's
[1:20:45] brought him here
[1:20:46] for to tear down the kingdom
[1:20:50] in the ways of satan hallelujah
[1:20:53] i better keep going we got a long way to
[1:20:56] go
[1:20:57] look what he says he says now
[1:21:00] he says satan he said we fight out and
[1:21:03] that
[1:21:04] they tried they tried to unite and then
[1:21:06] and become one person
[1:21:08] but in this united did that
[1:21:11] time he said it was under what a
[1:21:14] political power
[1:21:16] the uniting now is under political power
[1:21:20] everything is united any companies these
[1:21:23] little companies that didn't make it
[1:21:25] through the pandemic you see in the
[1:21:27] little ones
[1:21:28] that are still hanging on there well
[1:21:31] you got to read between the lines
[1:21:33] sometimes what god and what god is
[1:21:36] allowing them to do
[1:21:37] is the signs of the time is that right
[1:21:41] remember the pope he met with um chase
[1:21:44] banks
[1:21:45] he met with bank uh bank america and the
[1:21:47] other finance the top
[1:21:49] three financial groups in america
[1:21:51] challenged me and go see if not what
[1:21:53] i'll tell you is true
[1:21:54] they had to report to him once a year
[1:21:57] now see
[1:21:58] about these finances you have to
[1:22:00] understand
[1:22:01] when now the signs of the time when they
[1:22:03] first come
[1:22:04] they have to line up what with the
[1:22:06] prophecies is that right
[1:22:08] we know america got a debt that we
[1:22:11] cannot be paid it's not going to be paid
[1:22:13] unless the catholic church as the
[1:22:14] prophet said come in and pay off our
[1:22:17] debt
[1:22:17] so you have to understand saints and
[1:22:20] that where
[1:22:20] where god has brought you on his end
[1:22:23] time
[1:22:24] he see promise i'll never leave you or
[1:22:27] forsake you
[1:22:28] you've never seen the righteous forsaken
[1:22:31] or his seed
[1:22:32] begging for bread stop leaning to your
[1:22:35] own
[1:22:36] understanding let god
[1:22:40] have his way let god
[1:22:43] move look what he said in unity
[1:22:48] he said and finally he says when you
[1:22:51] find
[1:22:52] unity amongst people like that
[1:22:55] they do great things just look over the
[1:22:57] world
[1:22:58] when people unify themselves together
[1:23:00] yet
[1:23:01] under the wrong plan
[1:23:04] they'll do great things now they build
[1:23:06] the tower
[1:23:08] see modern science can't do that even
[1:23:10] today
[1:23:11] they have one mind one soul one purpose
[1:23:15] one motive one objective that's to build
[1:23:18] a tower
[1:23:18] so high to god if he ever took the
[1:23:21] notion
[1:23:22] and run right them right up into the
[1:23:25] heavens
[1:23:26] he said now look he couldn't keep them
[1:23:28] from doing that
[1:23:29] as they thought we find out they that
[1:23:32] they organize themselves together
[1:23:36] and we find them again completely what
[1:23:40] out of the will of god god already told
[1:23:44] him he wasn't going to destroy it by
[1:23:45] water again
[1:23:47] so you have to understand it because
[1:23:50] these
[1:23:50] minds now the prophet of god said it was
[1:23:53] a type of like jacob's ladder is that
[1:23:56] right
[1:23:57] he was a type of jacob ladder trying to
[1:23:59] go up in that ladder
[1:24:01] but what did he do he saved it for 2021
[1:24:05] is that right
[1:24:06] when he sent malachi 4. revelation 10
[1:24:09] 7 when the angel of god he was ascending
[1:24:13] and descending ascending and descending
[1:24:16] he's bringing the revelation
[1:24:17] down in the word down to his messengers
[1:24:20] in the end time they say come on we
[1:24:23] ought to be
[1:24:24] a glorious church in this house the most
[1:24:27] happiest church
[1:24:28] in this hour
[1:24:34] that's right hallelujah that scares the
[1:24:37] devil
[1:24:42] they ain't gonna steal my joy he ain't
[1:24:44] gonna steal my joy
[1:24:46] i know where he brought me from to god
[1:24:48] be the glory
[1:24:49] i thank god for all this word that he's
[1:24:52] unfolding
[1:24:55] he said now he said and there isn't
[1:24:58] a beautiful picture this day is that
[1:25:01] when men
[1:25:02] are trying to unite together we should
[1:25:05] we should be united but they're uniting
[1:25:09] what the wrong system did you ever
[1:25:11] notice how the devil patterns
[1:25:13] of these things he said now you look he
[1:25:16] said remember russia
[1:25:18] i'm not going to read all that i'm going
[1:25:19] to quote some other remember russia
[1:25:21] the prophet of god said that russia was
[1:25:24] trying to type as pentecost is that
[1:25:27] right
[1:25:28] he's just trying to bring them under one
[1:25:29] order to bring
[1:25:31] everything to them he said but he was
[1:25:33] typing it from the scriptures
[1:25:35] in pentecost when he scattered them
[1:25:37] abroad is that right
[1:25:38] and they brought everything that they
[1:25:40] had to defeat their of the apostles
[1:25:43] and distributed so no one would be
[1:25:45] lacking
[1:25:46] but the prophet of god said so that the
[1:25:48] word can go forward
[1:25:50] he had nowhere to go backwards to they
[1:25:54] only had to keep moving forward
[1:25:57] is that right kick the devil out
[1:26:04] look what he says he keeps going help us
[1:26:07] lord
[1:26:08] he said jacob's ladder he said look
[1:26:12] he said did you ever think the
[1:26:14] protestants
[1:26:15] under the federation of the church no
[1:26:17] let me jump up here
[1:26:19] he said now look say you look at the
[1:26:21] united nations
[1:26:23] see united nations is trying to they had
[1:26:26] them for years is that right
[1:26:28] they've always been uniting under man's
[1:26:31] way
[1:26:32] instead of according to the way of the
[1:26:34] lord so a man had to understand
[1:26:37] what god is doing in his hour here and
[1:26:40] now and is that right
[1:26:41] he's uniting and the end time signs
[1:26:45] is right before us is that right we have
[1:26:47] to
[1:26:48] understand that we're here now saints
[1:26:51] let me keep reading help me lord he said
[1:26:53] did you ever think
[1:26:54] other than you in trying to make all the
[1:26:56] nations one great big brotherhood
[1:26:58] he says under a united power see one
[1:27:01] great brotherhood
[1:27:02] when elijah came when malachi 4 came
[1:27:05] it was also brotherly love time is that
[1:27:07] right he was coming and he was bringing
[1:27:09] them
[1:27:10] that's what the pastor was talking about
[1:27:11] when you started typing in the church
[1:27:13] agent
[1:27:13] you started typing in the seals even
[1:27:16] though they had all that false teaching
[1:27:18] in that false doctrine and lutheran age
[1:27:20] but god always had
[1:27:21] a word to override that false teaching
[1:27:24] in every age
[1:27:25] he always brought some light to every
[1:27:28] age
[1:27:29] in wesley's age he brought some light in
[1:27:32] wesley's age and
[1:27:33] in pentecostal age he's always brought
[1:27:36] some light
[1:27:37] for the believer in each age
[1:27:41] he said now look united states is all
[1:27:44] right but it's under the wrong thing
[1:27:46] satan controls all the nations the
[1:27:48] scripture says satan is the ruler of the
[1:27:50] earth
[1:27:51] when when he's taking jesus up up into a
[1:27:54] high
[1:27:55] a high place he said now look let me let
[1:27:58] me turn
[1:27:59] the scriptures let's turn to uh
[1:28:02] matthew three
[1:28:03] [Music]
[1:28:06] i gotta jump on it when it could when it
[1:28:08] come if
[1:28:09] i know i talked about the tower of babel
[1:28:11] if you're writing your notes down that's
[1:28:13] in genesis
[1:28:14] 11. if you're going in the tower of
[1:28:16] babel
[1:28:17] sometimes god unites god god united in
[1:28:20] groups
[1:28:21] god uniting individuals and god who
[1:28:24] when god is united we want to be trying
[1:28:26] to show you here
[1:28:27] the movement of god when the holy spirit
[1:28:29] unites with a man
[1:28:31] that's what we're looking at he says now
[1:28:33] you have to understand
[1:28:35] matthew 3 he said look at one of the
[1:28:37] greatest uniting of all times is that
[1:28:39] right
[1:28:40] he said god does nothing and look at
[1:28:42] matthew chapter 3
[1:28:43] and verse 13 matthew 3 and verse 13
[1:28:47] he says then come of jesus from galilee
[1:28:49] to jordan unto john to be baptized of
[1:28:51] him but john forbade him saying
[1:28:53] i have needed to be baptized of thee and
[1:28:55] come as thou to me
[1:28:57] why because remember the scripture says
[1:29:00] god do nothing unless it's first he
[1:29:02] revealed his secrets into his prophets
[1:29:04] is that right
[1:29:05] so john recognized it john saw the
[1:29:07] uniting sign
[1:29:09] it was uniting time but the sign was
[1:29:11] only given to john
[1:29:13] john was the messenger then john forbade
[1:29:15] him saying
[1:29:16] i have need to be baptized of thee and
[1:29:18] cometh down to me
[1:29:20] he says in jesus answering and said him
[1:29:22] suffer it to be
[1:29:24] so now for thus it becometh unto us to
[1:29:27] do what
[1:29:27] fulfill our righteousness remember every
[1:29:29] lamb every sacrifice
[1:29:31] had to be clean is that right we had to
[1:29:33] be justified we had to be sanctified
[1:29:35] we had to be filled with the holy ghost
[1:29:37] son then god showed us it was what the
[1:29:39] adoption time now right
[1:29:41] we're moving forth saints that word that
[1:29:44] power
[1:29:44] is already inside of you god has stored
[1:29:47] it in you
[1:29:48] before the foundation of the world speak
[1:29:50] the word

[1:29:54] your objective you've got to be driven
[1:29:56] by love and this hour here now

[1:30:00] him in the book of ephesians when he
[1:30:02] told him first he said you fell from
[1:30:04] your first love
[1:30:05] when you fell from your first love you
[1:30:07] fell away from the word

[1:30:17] he didn't like the mysteries anymore
[1:30:19] the world is pulling on you he said i
[1:30:21] said have no fellowship with the world
[1:30:24] become one with god let the holy spirit
[1:30:26] unite to
[1:30:27] reunite you once again with the word of
[1:30:31] god
[1:30:31] let me keep going hallelujah look god he
[1:30:35] says suffer
[1:30:35] he said he suffered him and jesus when
[1:30:38] he was baptized
[1:30:39] went straight up out of the water and
[1:30:42] then lo
[1:30:42] the heavens were opened unto him and he
[1:30:45] saw what

[1:33:51] let me keep going look what he says he
[1:33:54] says russia
[1:33:55] want to type the pentecost i'ma drop
[1:33:57] down here for the sake of time
[1:33:59] he said did you ever think of the
[1:34:01] protestants
[1:34:02] he says i'm still at 12 21 58
[1:34:05] i'm a chapter 42. he said did you ever
[1:34:08] think
[1:34:08] of the protestant church under the
[1:34:10] federation of churches
[1:34:12] is trying to force all these little
[1:34:14] churches out
[1:34:15] and it will happen that you'll not be
[1:34:17] able to go to church
[1:34:18] unless you belong to the union of
[1:34:21] churches
[1:34:22] see you're nineteen time when the
[1:34:24] organizations
[1:34:25] that's why you keep hearing the prophets
[1:34:27] say i mean the pastors say
[1:34:29] it's a new book when those seals came
[1:34:31] open
[1:34:32] those guns he tied in all the loose ends
[1:34:36] it was elijah that came in in elisha in
[1:34:39] the old testament
[1:34:40] it was the light of john the baptist the
[1:34:42] spirit on them
[1:34:44] and then there when it came in the new
[1:34:46] testament
[1:34:47] it was when brother branham came it was
[1:34:49] the spirit of elijah but it was the
[1:34:52] anointing that christ
[1:34:53] it was christ in the holy ghost form
[1:34:56] back on the scene again
[1:35:00] this is christ he's the only one can
[1:35:02] break the seals
[1:35:04] he's the only one can descend in these
[1:35:06] sins
[1:35:07] is that right he said behold i send you
[1:35:10] what elijah the prophet before the great
[1:35:13] and dreadful day
[1:35:15] the coming of the lord that's why you

[1:35:23] man
[1:35:24] we're preaching what the anointed christ
[1:35:27] is that right
[1:35:28] is that the messenger had to come for
[1:35:31] this age
[1:35:33] i get a double portion because when you
[1:35:35] mention i get an
[1:35:36] opportunity he's not god we're not
[1:35:40] making him god

[1:36:09] elijah elisha john the baptist
[1:36:12] william branham over in revelations 11
[1:36:16] and the spirit of elijah had to come and
[1:36:19] win the spirit of elijah
[1:36:21] look at the sign over in genesis 18
[1:36:24] this sign was never shown to the
[1:36:26] gentiles he was discerning

[1:38:07] is to achieve but under the wrong plan
[1:38:10] it's under his own plan but he has no
[1:38:14] original he has to take something that
[1:38:17] god
[1:38:17] has did and then perverted it on
[1:38:20] righteousness
[1:38:21] he tried to pervert it or convert it

[1:40:40] clergy they don't read it right
[1:40:42] it's just like it was it was then
[1:40:45] they didn't think that it was time see
[1:40:48] but we know it's time
[1:40:51] uniting signs of the time
[1:40:55] be sure that you got the baptism of the
[1:40:58] holy ghost

[1:41:19] everybody's not bride
[1:41:21] but we can tell them about the saving
[1:41:23] grace of the lord jesus christ
[1:41:28] that's why the pastor said first go out
[1:41:31] and share the gospel
[1:41:32] every uniting time every believer
[1:41:36] is to tell someone about salvation every
[1:41:39] believer
[1:41:41] being like an evangelist go and tell
[1:41:43] them about
[1:41:44] the good news of the gospel i am not
[1:41:47] ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ
[1:41:49] for this is the power of god
[1:41:51] unto whom those that are saved
[1:41:54] look what he says he says now help me
[1:41:57] lord

[1:42:01] he said they thought it's just like it
[1:42:03] was then
[1:42:04] and they didn't think that it was time
[1:42:07] he said they thought that they were
[1:42:08] living pretty peaceful then and so they
[1:42:11] wasn't looking for no messiah
[1:42:13] and jesus has just said he's coming
[1:42:16] would be

[1:42:48] these mysteries
[1:42:49] that was hidden there is that right

[1:46:06] entered into the house
[1:46:07] and putting his hands on him and saying
[1:46:09] come brother saul the lord
[1:46:11] even jesus that appeared unto thee in
[1:46:14] the way
[1:46:14] then came and sent me that thou mightest
[1:46:17] received thy sight
[1:46:18] and be filled with the holy ghost and
[1:46:20] immediately
[1:46:21] and immediately from his eyes it became
[1:46:24] scales
[1:46:25] there had been scales he says and he
[1:46:28] received sight
[1:46:29] for with and arose and was baptized and
[1:46:32] when
[1:46:33] he had received me he was strengthened
[1:46:35] then was saw
[1:46:36] certain days with the disciples but at
[1:46:40] the marcus look what he did at the
[1:46:42] straight way
[1:46:43] he preached through christ in the
[1:46:45] synagogues
[1:46:46] that he is the son of god but all that
[1:46:50] heard him
[1:46:51] were amazed and said is it not that does
[1:46:53] he
[1:46:54] destroy them which called on this name
[1:46:57] in jerusalem
[1:46:58] came hither and intent he might bring
[1:47:01] them down
[1:47:02] unto the chief priests but saul
[1:47:05] increased the more in what
[1:47:07] strength and confound and the jews which
[1:47:10] dwelt at the mattress
[1:47:11] proving that this is the very christ let
[1:47:14] me tell you that you see what it did
[1:47:16] we don't have to get slack up when
[1:47:18] persecution comes
[1:47:20] when god comes when the anointing sign
[1:47:22] came
[1:47:23] it came to paul paul saw the voice and

[2:05:10] if we keep living the way we were living
[2:05:13] before

[2:05:17] we were doing
[2:05:20] and just continuing with the trend of
[2:05:22] this world
[2:05:24] we're gonna miss god amen
[2:05:27] when do you wanna live for god
[2:05:34] branham says that we were designed to
[2:05:36] achieve things

[2:05:41] amen and every time we do things for our
[2:05:45] own
[2:05:46] motives and objectives whatever we do
[2:05:49] we are doomed for failure amen
[2:05:53] and brother kelly read the quote here
[2:05:55] where brother branham said man still
[2:05:57] doesn't learn
[2:05:59] how many failure did we have in our
[2:06:02] lives
[2:06:03] how many times we did things and he
[2:06:05] failed
[2:06:07] and why did he fail because we were
[2:06:10] leaning
[2:06:10] upon our own understanding
[2:06:14] over and over and over
[2:06:17] and over and we keep doing the same
[2:06:19] thing over and over
[2:06:21] amen brother kelly spoke about the clock
[2:06:26] here
[2:06:27] amen and he explained that if
[2:06:30] one thing is out of order amen
[2:06:34] you are causing trouble to the whole
[2:06:36] clock

[2:06:58] and show you that i gotta do this
[2:06:59] i gotta do this i gotta do this
[2:07:01] therefore i cannot be in church tonight
[2:07:06] amen i can prove you and give you all my
[2:07:09] schedule and show you that
[2:07:10] i must miss church to it
[2:07:14] amen we don't understand those things
[2:07:18] if you don't give god preeminence
[2:07:21] if you don't want to put your car in
[2:07:23] neutral
[2:07:25] if you don't want to stop the way you
[2:07:27] were living before
[2:07:29] and pull a break and believe the
[2:07:33] supernatural
[2:07:35] that god you designed me as a god
[2:07:39] you created me like a god you
[2:07:42] made me as a son of god and i have lived
[2:07:46] this
[2:07:46] life for so long depending
[2:07:50] and planning on things according to my
[2:07:53] intellect i'm reaching a point
[2:07:56] that i'm gonna live by faith amen
[2:07:59] because if you have responsibility here
[2:08:02] in the church
[2:08:03] to be a musician and you put your
[2:08:06] own life first
[2:08:08] [Music]
[2:08:10] do you follow me and your responsibility
[2:08:13] is struggling because you don't want to
[2:08:16] be there
[2:08:19] you're not going to answer to me you're
[2:08:22] gonna answer it to god
[2:08:24] do you hear me if you care
[2:08:27] you better sit on a chair than taking a
[2:08:31] responsibility
[2:08:32] and you can't make it amen if you are a
[2:08:35] deacon
[2:08:36] and you have a responsibility and your
[2:08:39] clock is not ticking the way
[2:08:41] it's supposed to be because you have a
[2:08:44] reason you have a job you have to do
[2:08:45] this you have to do this
[2:08:47] and you are forgetting one thing god
[2:08:50] can give you another sleep
[2:08:53] within four hours amen
[2:08:57] you can sleep three hours and you can
[2:09:00] feel like somebody who slept eight hours
[2:09:03] amen if you give him the preeminence i'm
[2:09:06] not saying
[2:09:07] you don't have to sleep but if you are
[2:09:09] trusted and there are stuff that a
[2:09:11] trustee need to do
[2:09:13] and you are not up to your
[2:09:15] responsibility if you're a treasurer
[2:09:18] if you're supposed to be in church on
[2:09:20] wednesday if you're supposed to be on
[2:09:22] church on sunday
[2:09:24] and you let everything take over
[2:09:27] because you always have a reason
[2:09:31] to justify what you're doing to justify
[2:09:35] not coming to church
[2:09:36] to justify missing church to justify
[2:09:40] not being able to drive one on this day
[2:09:45] you won't have to do that but you're
