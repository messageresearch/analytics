[0:06] paragraph 98 909
[0:14] God took or made his first decision to
[0:18] have communion with men says
[0:22] he did under the blood of the sacrifice
[0:28] that's the reason why he had to go to
[0:31] Jerusalem
[0:36] you recall when people in the Old
[0:38] Testament had trouble they had to make
[0:40] their way to Jerusalem amen amen
[0:49] God will only meet men under the blood
[0:54] a lot of foreign
[1:14] [Applause]
[1:58] speaking about marriage he said first
[2:01] there is a decision that have to take
[2:03] place then there is an engagement
[2:05] followed by the marriage ceremony
[2:12] [Music]
[2:24] in this hour is
[2:41] this is the only time you can make a
[2:44] decision in this life for your future
[2:46] life Las Vegas
[2:54] you must make a decision now for your
[2:57] future life nothing foreign
[3:28] foreign
[4:05] they first stated that this is my only
[4:08] beloved Son
[4:10] affection this is where I put my all
[4:13] confidence
[4:19] Peter probably was seeking for a place
[4:25] everybody was making their way to
[4:28] Jerusalem
[4:31] but now God gave them another Precision
[4:35] of a place of world
[4:37] [Music]
[4:46] the place of worship he is
[4:56] nothing else but Jesus Christ
[4:59] hallelujah amen
[5:02] blessed be the name of the Lord
[5:06] in the invasion of the United States
[5:12] paragraph 2 30. I'm just going to drink
[5:16] something
[5:17] brother
[5:20] the decision you see
[5:23] he started together with a decision
[5:27] what brother Branham was showing here
[5:33] in your life where you gotta make a
[5:35] decision
[5:44] in the beginning when God created
[5:50] the scripture says that there was a
[5:53] morning and the evening
[6:01] the Bible said there was an evening and
[6:04] the morning start with the morning and
[6:08] then the evening
[6:10] I don't know if you have the same
[6:12] scriptures
[6:13] but there was a purpose why he had to be
[6:16] rich
[6:18] and I'm gonna show you that purpose now
[6:25] in the morning
[6:30] and
[6:35] on the seventh day God rested
[6:39] continues
[6:41] never continue to work
[6:45] today he didn't rest because he was
[6:47] tired
[6:53] was because everything was completed and
[6:57] perfect
[6:59] so he was looking at the lights
[7:09] and to look at his children Adam and Eve
[7:13] and God saw that everything was perfect
[7:16] that's the reason why he rested
[7:20] but let me tell you something you
[7:22] Christians
[7:24] you don't have to work your head off you
[7:26] knock out the Repose you have to also
[7:29] rest in your life
[7:31] so when are you going to rest
[7:34] into the world
[7:49] you need to check what have God already
[7:51] spoke in his word
[7:56] decision because by the brand I'm saying
[7:58] God doesn't change
[8:02] from the beginning he already took him
[8:06] his decision was his word Allah
[8:11] when you rest upon the word of God
[8:15] they will happen
[8:17] I'm going to show you something
[8:27] you know the Book of Joshua is a book
[8:29] filled with conquests
[8:32] War upon territories
[8:37] it's a book that shows or demonstrate
[8:40] the power of God
[8:41] the military power
[8:44] the military force
[8:48] Our God was backing up the army of
[8:51] Israel Joshua
[8:57] [Music]
[9:07] [Music]
[9:46] God already delivered into the hand the
[9:50] amorites
[9:51] okay okay
[9:53] let me back up a little bit
[9:58] remember I told you there was first and
[10:01] evening then the moon
[10:05] when Jesus was preaching all over the
[10:08] land
[10:11] you will notice that he always give food
[10:14] at the evening
[10:17] Jesus was not applying bread in the
[10:19] evening
[10:27] he had 400 prophets
[10:31] glory to God
[10:34] he gave them the time
[10:40] this is when the fire okay
[10:43] and the fire came down in days
[10:51] messages
[10:55] the Bible says this
[10:59] in the Book of Proverbs
[11:02] Lafayette
[11:05] says that the end of something is better
[11:09] than each beginning

[12:35] Soleil Sun
[12:39] light son arrested
[12:46] and then to the Moon also
[12:50] he also stopped the moon
[12:53] why did he stop the moon
[12:56] let me explain you this
[13:07] but the war was still going on

[27:36] testimony man
[27:38] um I'm trying to be within 15 minutes
[27:41] amen
[27:42] amen I mean I
[27:45] the reason why this song touched my
[27:47] heart so much was uh was it two two
[27:50] nights ago I was working
[27:52] and then this song came up and then I
[27:55] was singing
[27:56] singing in the car singing singing and
[28:00] then when I got to
[28:02] the the line that said do Satan rages
[28:06] something happened
[28:08] um visibility became very poor and it
[28:12] was very dark and then I was almost
[28:15] hearing um the middle pavement
[28:18] but um
[28:20] but that the Lord helped me to move
[28:23] quickly away from it but then I had
[28:25] oncoming vehicles
[28:30] but the Lord took me out of that
[28:33] amen and amen and and as soon as that
[28:37] happened the song became louder and
[28:39] louder so we got the power in the name
[28:42] of Jesus
[28:43] amen
[28:45] amen
[28:46] I just want to share with you tonight
[28:48] um
[28:49] a short word can we be outstanding amen
[28:55] it is it is a scripture that we all are
[28:59] familiar with Revelations chapter 3
[29:04] verse 14.
[29:07] amen
[29:11] Revelations chapter 3 verse 14.
[29:15] and unto the angel of the Church of the
[29:17] auditions right
[29:19] these things said the amen
[29:23] the faithful
[29:25] and true Witness
[29:27] the beginning of the creation of God
[29:31] shall we pray father in the name of
[29:33] Jesus we come to you tonight Lord father
[29:36] I don't have any word Lord Jesus but you
[29:39] have the word to feed us Lord father
[29:41] take me aside Lord and speak your word
[29:44] to our hearts Lord Jesus o God we thank
[29:47] you we bless you in Jesus Christ and we
[29:49] pray amen
[29:51] amen
[29:52] my my subject tonight is identification
[29:57] who am I
[29:59] amen
[30:03] I don't want to say who are you the
[30:05] question is who am I it is personal
[30:10] it is personal
[30:12] it is a personal revelation in this last
[30:15] days
[30:16] amen
[30:18] identification who am I
[30:20] amen
[30:23] foreign
[30:27] Revelations
[30:31] chapter 3 verse 15. he said I Know Thy
[30:35] works
[30:37] now before that
[30:38] um in 14 he said um
[30:41] this thing said the amen
[30:44] the faithful
[30:46] and true Witness
[30:48] and I know somewhere in Revelations he
[30:50] calls his wife faithful
[30:55] so whatever Christ is
[30:58] his wife is
[31:00] the faithful
[31:02] and the true witness not just a witness
[31:05] but a true witness we can have a false
[31:09] witness we can have false Witnesses of
[31:12] the word
[31:13] we are allowed this year we have false
[31:16] Witnesses of the word but this is the
[31:18] true witness and in our this year we
[31:21] also have true Witnesses
[31:25] and through witness the beginning of the
[31:28] creation of God I Know Thy works that
[31:32] thou art neither cold nor heart
[31:36] I would that were cold or hot
[31:40] amen
[31:44] this is the spirit in loudicia I I I
[31:47] can't talk too much about it we've heard
[31:50] it over and over again the spirit of
[31:53] laodicea is such that we have one side
[31:56] two extremes
[31:58] and you can't really tell where this one
[32:00] is
[32:02] so the challenge tonight to us is who
[32:06] are you are you a believer of the
[32:07] message
[32:10] are you a believer of the message
[32:14] who am I am I identified with what the
[32:18] Lord has given to us the true witness
[32:20] are you identified with what the Lord
[32:24] has given to you you know sometimes
[32:27] let's look at this we have the head
[32:31] coming down to us
[32:33] so when somebody's speaking against
[32:35] their head I begin to have headache
[32:39] when someone is attacking the head I
[32:43] begin to have headache
[32:45] why because my head is there
[32:48] I am identified when somebody is
[32:50] speaking against the message when
[32:52] somebody's attacking the cloud I am
[32:54] having headache
[33:00] because you attacked my head I feel it
[33:02] here whatever happens in the spiritual
[33:05] happens in the natural
[33:09] amen
[33:10] so the question is who am I when
[33:13] somebody's speaking against the word
[33:16] that you believe and you can stay in
[33:18] that company my question is who are you
[33:23] [Applause]
[33:27] when somebody is living a life
[33:29] that is contrary to what the message is
[33:32] saying the question is who are you what
[33:35] is the spirit that is in you
[33:38] because the spirit in you will surely
[33:40] come out
[33:41] it is a spirit that is in you that will
[33:44] drive your actions it is a spirit that
[33:47] is in you that will move your body
[33:51] because your spirit inside must come out
[33:55] amen
[33:57] he said so then 16 so that because Thou
[34:01] Art look warm
[34:03] and neither cold or hot I will spill
[34:06] thee out of my mouth
[34:09] because thou say it I am rich
[34:13] an increase with Goods
[34:15] and have need of nothing
[34:18] and know us not that thou art wretched
[34:21] and miserable
[34:23] and poor and blind
[34:26] and naked
[34:28] let's go to Acts chapter 19.
[34:34] amen
[34:36] let's just wind down with this drinking
[34:38] man
[34:40] Acts chapter 19 from verse 8.
[34:48] Acts 19 verse 8.
[34:51] and he went into the synagogue
[34:54] and speak broadly
[34:56] for the space of three months
[34:59] disputing
[35:01] and persuading the things concerning the
[35:05] kingdom of God
[35:06] but when divers were hardened
[35:10] and believe not
[35:12] but speak evil
[35:14] of that way before the multitude
[35:18] he departed from them
[35:20] and separated the disciples
[35:24] he separated the disciples
[35:27] Paul was preaching
[35:30] and he had people speaking evil about
[35:32] the word
[35:33] speaking evil about the message of Paul
[35:37] Paul couldn't stand it he has to
[35:39] separate those who believe the word
[35:43] something in you is going to cause a
[35:46] total suppression from unbelief
[35:51] amen so the question is who are you
[35:55] can you stay
[35:58] in that group can you stay amongst
[36:02] people who speak against the word
[36:07] but when divers were hardened and
[36:09] believe not but speak evil of that way
[36:11] before the multitude he departed from
[36:14] them and separated the disciples
[36:17] disputing daily in the school of front
[36:19] tiredness
[36:22] and this continued by the space of two
[36:24] years
[36:25] so that all their witch dwell in Asia
[36:27] heard the word
[36:29] all them that dwelled in Asia heard the
[36:32] word of the Lord Jesus both Jews and
[36:35] Greeks
[36:36] now let's go here verse 11.
[36:39] and God wrote special Miracles by the
[36:43] hands of Paul now God was doing these
[36:46] Miracles because of the message of Paul
[36:50] because the message must come with
[36:52] Vindication because my problem said that
[36:54] is the gospel the gospel doesn't just
[36:57] come in word form but it comes with the
[36:59] manifestations amen
[37:01] amen amen so while Paul was speaking the
[37:05] word
[37:06] you you have proposition coming against
[37:09] him but God was vindicating the word
[37:12] with signs and wonders
[37:15] he said so that from his body were
[37:18] brought unto the sick
[37:20] handkerchiefs
[37:21] or airplanes and the diseases departed
[37:26] from them
[37:27] and the evil spirits went out of them
[37:31] amen
[37:32] then setting of The vagable Juice
[37:36] now Vagabond that's the spirit that
[37:39] doesn't have a resting place
[37:43] you are neither hot nor cold
[37:46] we can't find your place we can find
[37:49] where you stand do you believe the
[37:51] message
[37:53] are you holding on to the message
[37:56] amen amen
[37:58] amen then sudden of the Vagabond Jews
[38:01] Exorcist magicians
[38:04] took upon them to call over them which
[38:07] had evil spirits the name of the Lord
[38:10] Jesus
[38:11] saying
[38:13] we are judge you by Jesus whom poor
[38:18] preaching
[38:23] Jesus whom Paul preached
[38:27] where is their stand
[38:29] I see a lukewarm Spirit here
[38:32] Jesus who come preached but I know when
[38:36] the disciples when I I asked Brad Kelly
[38:39] was was talking about Peter and John
[38:41] when they went they said
[38:44] I have I don't have silver not gold but
[38:48] as I have I give to you he said in the
[38:51] name of the Lord Jesus so it is not a
[38:54] personal talk

[39:02] quote what Jesus is saying to the man
[39:04] that is sitting there who needs healing

[39:31] that
[39:32] brother Brown said this so I'm doing
[39:34] that
[39:35] what is the objective of the message
[39:39] the objective of the message is to see
[39:41] people walking
[39:43] and when we are looking for the message
[39:44] we are seeing people
[39:46] amen when you identify with a message
[39:50] amen we will see you as a message yes
[39:53] amen when they begin to close the church
[39:56] doors when they begin to bring the
[39:58] message books and they are looking for
[40:00] the message we are going to see people
[40:02] walking
[40:05] amen we are going to see people walking
[40:09] Hallelujah that is objective of the
[40:12] message
[40:13] that is my identity
[40:18] the word is my identity
[40:21] amen
[40:25] I said 14 and there were seven sons of
[40:30] one skiver
[40:31] I was just taking thinking about these
[40:33] seven sons
[40:35] it's just pointing me to the seventh age
[40:41] seven sons of one skiver
[40:43] and these are religious people
[40:47] a Jew and chief of the priests
[40:52] their sons of the chief of the priests
[40:59] Pharisee amen
[41:01] they know the scriptures
[41:04] they'll come to you and tell you what
[41:06] brother Brown said is not true
[41:09] that is the spirit of laodicia
[41:13] amen that is the spirit of lordicia amen
[41:17] I have some quotes I'm going to read
[41:19] where problem talks about that amen
[41:21] I'm trying to rush
[41:23] amen amen and there were seven signs of
[41:27] one skiver a Jew and chief of the priest
[41:30] which did so
[41:32] they were the ones that were trying to
[41:34] you know copy what Paul was doing
[41:38] they're trying to imitate Paul
[41:40] impersonators
[41:43] they want to do exactly what Paul was
[41:45] doing but they never believed what Paul
[41:47] was preaching
[41:50] they never believe what Paul was
[41:52] preaching but they wanted to impersonate
[41:54] what Paul was doing
[41:57] people watch this message they look at
[42:00] brother Abraham's miracles
[42:02] and and they're like wow but they can't
[42:04] take the word
[42:07] amen when you are in this message
[42:09] because of the Miracles of brother
[42:11] Abraham a time will come you're gonna
[42:13] leave
[42:20] and the evil spirits answered and said
[42:24] Jesus I know
[42:26] Paul I know but who are you
[42:35] it becomes personal
[42:38] who are you what is your identity are
[42:42] you the walking message
[42:44] or we have to look at you and still be
[42:47] referring to the prophet
[42:51] amen
[42:52] when I look at you I must see the
[42:54] message
[42:55] because the message you are spoken and
[42:57] must put on flesh
[43:00] Amen in a spirit form in my spirit of
[43:03] Flesh
[43:04] amen
[43:05] who are you
[43:07] the religious demons in this last age
[43:10] will be asking you who are you
[43:12] when you are in the midst of people that
[43:15] are living lives contrary to the word
[43:18] contrary to the true word those demons
[43:21] will ask you who are you because you
[43:24] don't know which side you are
[43:28] why don't you put your makeup
[43:30] why don't you put on her here
[43:33] because my check doesn't do that
[43:40] amen
[43:42] amen
[43:44] and the evil spirit answered and said
[43:46] Jesus I know
[43:48] and Paul I know but who are you
[43:53] and the man in whom the evil spirit was
[43:55] lived on them and overcame them and
[44:00] prevailed against them so that they fled
[44:02] out they fled out of that house naked
[44:07] and wounded
[44:09] I was just looking at naked
[44:12] amen
[44:14] that's how the spirit is going to expose
[44:17] you when you are not identified with the
[44:20] true word of your age
[44:24] amen
[44:26] amen as I said I'm not going to take too
[44:29] long amen I'm just going to read a
[44:31] letter from the prophet amen
[44:33] amen
[44:39] help me Lord amen
[44:41] foreign
[44:47] amen
[44:59] amen
[45:01] so we read from the message and his
[45:03] exposition of the seven Church ages he
[45:06] said they knew the righteous life that
[45:09] accompanied the bearing of that name
[45:11] for whosoever nameth the name of the
[45:14] Lord let him depart from sin
[45:17] say Be You holy ye that the vessels of
[45:21] the Lord
[45:22] thou shall not bear the name of the Lord
[45:24] that God in vain
[45:27] so this Ephesians were Christians
[45:31] amen
[45:33] they brought a name and that name was
[45:35] Christ
[45:37] who was the spirit of God within them
[45:40] and which was one of the threefold names
[45:42] of their lord
[45:44] amen
[45:48] I continue with the same message
[45:51] um
[45:52] that's in the audition Church it said
[45:55] yes the land is full of corner
[45:57] impersonators
[45:59] in that last day they will try to
[46:01] imitate that Prophet messenger the seven
[46:04] sons of Giver tried to imitate Paul
[46:08] Simon the Sorcerer tried to imitate
[46:10] Peter
[46:11] their impersonations will be Connor
[46:14] they won't be able to produce what the
[46:17] true Prophet produces when he says the
[46:21] Revival is over they will go around
[46:23] claiming a great revelation
[46:26] that's what the people have is exactly
[46:28] right and God is going to do bigger and
[46:31] more wonderful things among the people
[46:33] and the people will fall for it they say
[46:36] false prophets will claim that the
[46:39] messenger of the last day is not a
[46:41] theologian so he ought not to be hurt
[46:44] they won't be able to produce what the
[46:47] messenger can they won't be Vindicated
[46:49] by God as that last day Prophet is but
[46:53] with their great swelling words
[46:56] and with the weight of their worldwide
[46:58] notoriety they want the people not to
[47:02] hear that man
[47:04] and they will say he teaches wrong
[47:07] they are running exactly true to their
[47:09] fathers their Pharisees who were of the
[47:13] devil for they claim that both John and
[47:15] Jesus taught error
[47:18] that's the spirit of laodicea
[47:20] amen
[47:22] those Spirits cannot take the word but
[47:25] they want to impersonate
[47:28] the Miracles
[47:30] amen
[47:31] now I want to read this message
[47:34] identification preaching 1964. he said
[47:38] our character moves us to the image of
[47:40] what we are our character of life does
[47:44] in US you see our character is modeled
[47:48] by what's on the inside of us and our
[47:51] outside only expresses what's on the
[47:54] inside what we are how we walk no matter
[47:58] what we say our life speaks louder than
[48:01] our words does
[48:02] amen if we must say I am a believer in
[48:05] God and I'll say well do you believe all
[48:07] the Bible Well I don't know then you see
[48:11] your lips
[48:13] your your very life is speaking louder
[48:16] then than what your words will be amen
[48:20] amen if you say I'm a Christian I do not
[48:23] believe in I do not believe all that God
[48:26] said is true
[48:28] then leave any kind of a life
[48:30] after that see
[48:32] your life speaks louder than what your
[48:35] testimony does
[48:36] [Music]
[48:38] amen amen said our character is molded
[48:41] the same message is molded in there by
[48:44] the light that is in us the light that
[48:47] is in you know to your character
[48:50] brother
[48:51] yes sir if you are in a wrong place what
[48:55] is in you that is moving you to that
[48:58] place
[48:59] amen something must be in you that is
[49:01] connected to the wrong environment right
[49:03] yes
[49:05] but no he said let me give you a more
[49:08] pitiful sight
[49:09] is to see men and women who were made in
[49:12] the image of God to bear his character
[49:15] yet housed into things
[49:18] and housed in by the traps of this world
[49:23] we are being trapped by worldly desires
[49:27] amen
[49:29] amen amen amen
[49:32] I'm trying to hurry up with time amen
[49:34] amen let's read this Romans 8. amen
[49:38] Romans 8 11. yes
[49:43] I wouldn't want to take too much time
[49:44] man Romans 8 11 it's a popular scripture
[49:47] amen
[49:50] he said but if the spirit
[49:54] I'm closing it's just short but if the
[49:56] spirit of him
[49:58] that raised up Jesus from the dead
[50:01] dwell in you
[50:03] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[50:08] shall also Quicken your mother bodies
[50:11] by his spirit that dwelled in you
[50:16] amen
[50:18] I mean I I've just been blessed by
[50:22] the word coming to us
[50:24] as brother Kelly was preaching on
[50:27] Wednesday when the word comes it becomes
[50:29] my
[50:32] amen it was so interesting that morning
[50:35] I was meditating on the same thing and
[50:38] and that thing was running through my
[50:40] mind and when we came to church brother
[50:42] Kelly dropped the same thing
[50:44] when the world comes it now becomes mine
[50:47] amen so the Lord was has been opening so
[50:51] much to us
[50:53] and and we've come to realize that we
[50:56] must meet Christ in every form that he
[51:00] comes in
[51:02] almonds it is so important yes
[51:06] yes you must meet Christ
[51:08] as the word coming down on Sunset
[51:11] Mountain it has a specific fulfillment
[51:14] in the life of the believer
[51:18] amen amen because Abraham had to make
[51:21] God in several forms
[51:25] Abraham meeting God in a vision didn't
[51:28] change his body
[51:30] Abraham's seen God in a dream didn't
[51:32] change his body huh
[51:35] God must come
[51:37] and turn his back
[51:42] amen he must come and turn his back
[51:46] the prophet said when you are a child of
[51:48] God God is due to bound to reveal every
[51:52] secret to you
[51:55] there is nothing
[51:57] that has been exposed in this message or
[52:00] has been unveiled in this message that
[52:02] you say it doesn't belong to you
[52:05] every detail of Christ belongs to the
[52:08] bride amen amen amen amen amen
[52:14] so in closing
[52:16] this is a message
[52:18] identification he said now
[52:21] I hope that don't interfere with nothing
[52:25] said you see
[52:26] and I wouldn't want to say nothing
[52:28] contrary to what you've been taught
[52:32] I don't want to say nothing contrary to
[52:34] what you've been taught
[52:36] I'm reading from the prophet
[52:39] but just so that you would understand
[52:42] what I'm trying to get to here
[52:45] a reflection
[52:48] you've got to be identified
[52:51] and if you are
[52:53] and if you were in God's thinking at the
[52:55] beginning see
[52:57] and what's his reflection here on Earth
[53:01] you will bear a record of the heavenly
[53:05] and as he brought record of the Heavenly
[53:08] also and when he raised up from the
[53:11] grave and was given a body we when we
[53:15] raise up we have a body like his own
[53:18] glorious body amen amen
[53:21] amen the resurrection is sure
[53:26] the prophet said the resurrection is
[53:28] sure
[53:30] amen it's a guarantee
[53:34] and we have the earnest of it now
[53:37] as the Holy Ghost comes in and
[53:40] identifies us as God's redeemed person
[53:43] amen
[53:45] when you receive the Holy Ghost you've
[53:48] sealed to the journeys over
[53:51] amen
[53:54] that is your talking that you hold that
[53:58] shows that your fear has been paid
[54:01] [Applause]
[54:03] the fear has been paid our Resurrection
[54:06] is a guarantee amen he said you are a
[54:10] redeemed character
[54:12] Satan has no business with you none
[54:15] whatever just pick up your talking and
[54:18] show him my healing is paid for my trip
[54:22] to glory is paid for amen
[54:25] as talking as what you used to write on
[54:29] a bus line or an airplane
[54:31] your ticket is your talking so see
[54:35] take your talking
[54:38] the problem said you are redeemed
[54:42] amen
[54:43] the blessing
[54:45] the Holy Spirit and if Satan tries to
[54:48] push something on you just show this
[54:53] amen that's your identification amen he
[54:58] said you're identified in the
[54:59] resurrection of Christ you identified in
[55:02] his death when you die you identify in
[55:06] his resurrection
[55:07] and by that it identifies you that you
[55:12] were with him before the foundation of
[55:15] the world because you are redeemed
[55:17] he said that's brought back
[55:19] all the father has given me will come
[55:23] and no man can come unless he the father
[55:28] has given hallelujah amen amen that's a
[55:33] short message for tonight amen amen

[56:24] lead amen this is the last one who is
[56:27] going to be speaking tonight

[57:42] the world
[57:43] uh I I don't intend to to preach for
[57:47] long this evening I think the ministers
[57:50] have done a wonderful job
[57:52] and I'm just gonna
[57:54] um just say a few things agree to the
[57:56] church and then we'll take it from there
[57:59] if we can bow our heads
[58:01] Heavenly Father we thank you Lord Jesus
[58:03] this evening Lord just fellowshipping
[58:06] together under the reviewed word of the
[58:08] hour Lord you say behold how good and
[58:11] how pleasant it is for the Brethren to
[58:14] dwell together in unity Lord is you say
[58:17] it's like the anointing that flowed from
[58:19] the head of Aaron Down To His Garment
[58:21] it's like the Jew on Mount Hermon father
[58:24] you said surely you will command a
[58:27] blessing Lord may you bless the church
[58:29] may you bless your children when you
[58:31] bless your your daughters who have come
[58:33] Lord to Fellowship under the reviewed
[58:36] word of the hour for where the carcass
[58:38] is there shall the Eagles be gathered we
[58:41] thank you for the carcass of the word
[58:43] that you have given us in these last
[58:45] days we commit this time into your hands
[58:47] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[58:52] let's read Zechariah Chapter
[58:55] 12 verse 10.
[58:58] and I will pour out upon the House of
[59:01] David and upon the inhabitants of
[59:03] Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and
[59:06] supplication and they shall look upon me
[59:08] whom they have pierced and they shall
[59:11] mourn for him as one morning for his
[59:14] only son and shall be in bitterness for
[59:17] him is one that is in bitterness of his
[59:20] firstborn you may have your seats just
[59:24] for a little inspiration I've never
[59:25] preached this anywhere it's just a
[59:28] thought that dropped in my heart when
[59:29] brother Steve said I should greet the
[59:31] church so it's uh the parallel
[59:34] of the seventh trumpet and the seventh
[59:37] seal
[59:40] now that's that is not complicated
[59:45] the message is not complicated
[59:48] it was preached by a man with great
[59:50] seven
[59:51] who came from the Southern Hills of
[59:53] Kentucky
[59:54] who was eating cornbread
[59:57] Hallelujah and he was hunting raccoons
[1:00:00] and shooting squirrels so the message is
[1:00:03] simple yes my brother Hallelujah yes
[1:00:06] don't be intimidated by the title the
[1:00:09] message is very simple yes my brother
[1:00:11] Hallelujah so if you know the seventh
[1:00:14] the trumpet yes sir then you know the
[1:00:16] seven the seal because the seventh
[1:00:18] trumpet is equal to the seventh seal
[1:00:21] that's right Hallelujah yes ma'am what
[1:00:24] is the seventh the trumpet it's God
[1:00:27] you're revealing himself to the Jews sir
[1:00:29] yes sir but it does not come in flesh he
[1:00:32] comes to a prophet and the prophet is
[1:00:35] Moses in the light chart that's right
[1:00:37] Hallelujah yes sir I wondered all my
[1:00:39] life out of millions of Jews in Israel
[1:00:42] why only 144 000 receive the Holy Ghost
[1:00:47] they were expecting a messiah to come in
[1:00:51] flesh they're expecting a messiah to
[1:00:54] come with nails cut hands but he comes
[1:00:58] behind a son of man that is the son of
[1:01:01] man revealing the son of man
[1:01:04] praise be to God that's your seventh to
[1:01:08] trumpet my friends my brother Hallelujah
[1:01:11] yes sir praise be together and the
[1:01:14] prophet says in the Feast of trumpets
[1:01:16] that the trumpets are to the Jews what
[1:01:19] the seals are to the Gentiles that's
[1:01:21] right Hallelujah so God takes a Godless
[1:01:25] from Israel hallelujah how many knows
[1:01:28] that Jesus Christ is Joseph
[1:01:30] and how did Joseph reveal himself to the
[1:01:33] to his brothers he dismissed his gentle
[1:01:37] bride that's right Hallelujah because he
[1:01:40] wants to show himself to his brothers
[1:01:42] and he took his brothers and he shot him
[1:01:47] the sign of circumcision he showed him
[1:01:50] his Casa and they worked for him they
[1:01:54] realized that they saw their brother yes
[1:01:57] so here Zechariah is saying that when he
[1:02:00] shall come that's right every tribe
[1:02:02] shall be
[1:02:03] morning for him like someone who is
[1:02:07] mourning for his only child when Jesus
[1:02:09] Christ reveals himself to Israel praise
[1:02:13] be to God now the prophet teaches us
[1:02:15] here
[1:02:16] that you know the Jews they have seven
[1:02:19] feasts how many knows that what's God
[1:02:22] deals with Israel through the feast you
[1:02:24] have passed over and live in bread first
[1:02:26] fruit and Pentecost and that's in the
[1:02:28] spring and in the Foy of the trumpets
[1:02:31] atonement and Tabernacles now
[1:02:34] Tabernacles is the Millennium but before
[1:02:36] Tabernacles there is a feast of
[1:02:38] atonement now the Feast of atonement
[1:02:41] they call it Yom Kippur it's the holiest
[1:02:44] Feast of the Jews Hallelujah if you
[1:02:48] don't observe Yom Kippur you are cut off
[1:02:51] from Israel praise be to God but the
[1:02:54] prophet says on the Feast of atonement
[1:02:57] they are not going to slay a lamp they
[1:03:00] are not going to slay a bullock because
[1:03:03] the Bullock is the slain at Passover
[1:03:06] Hallelujah but the Feast of Tabernacles
[1:03:09] the prophet says it's a feast of
[1:03:11] mourning they are recognizing the true
[1:03:14] atonement
[1:03:16] praise be to God
[1:03:18] Hallelujah so that is the seventh

[1:10:40] she spoke in tongues and said the spirit
[1:10:42] of Elijah and Moses is going to minister

[1:11:22] with Paul in that portion of heaven was
[1:11:25] closed and coluba came and his portion
[1:11:28] was closer now the only Heaven that is
[1:11:31] open

[1:14:08] glory glory to God
[1:14:12] [Applause]
[1:14:16] did you stumble when they say the
[1:14:18] portion of Heaven is closed
[1:14:22] did you stumble it's a portion of Heaven
[1:14:25] that belongs to the bride
[1:14:27] [Applause]
[1:14:29] that's what I meant in other words the
[1:14:32] Bride of Jesus Christ have a number
[1:14:35] and in every age God opened the door and
[1:14:39] pour a number like for instance in
[1:14:42] Ephesus God knows that I will post 6
[1:14:45] million when six million finish God
[1:14:47] closes
[1:14:48] then he opened another door and he suck
[1:14:51] his children and God closes so the last
[1:14:54] door for the Gentile
[1:14:58] blood that is left Israel now and God is
[1:15:02] just calling his children home sucking
[1:15:05] his electron in other words the only
[1:15:08] available atonement oh blood is under
[1:15:12] this message
[1:15:14] [Applause]
[1:15:18] and once God finishes and closes then
[1:15:22] God turned back to the Jewish people
[1:15:24] whoever is left is the foolish virgin
[1:15:28] they go under a different compartment in
[1:15:31] heaven but not the comportment of the
[1:15:33] bread we are the VIP we are the Bride of
[1:15:38] the Lamb we are him we came from his
[1:15:42] side we are the wife of the Lamb because
[1:15:46] the marriage of the Lamb have come and
[1:15:48] his brother had made herself
[1:15:52] glory to God
[1:15:53] [Applause]
[1:15:54] [Music]
[1:15:56] [Applause]
[1:16:06] I don't know what to do
[1:16:10] I just have to say that to stabilize
[1:16:12] somebody who was probably uh uh uh
[1:16:16] what's struggling when they say that the
[1:16:19] only door of Heaven
[1:16:20] the heaven of the Bride the bride has a
[1:16:23] place like the Old Testament when they
[1:16:26] were dying they were going in the bosom
[1:16:28] of Abraham it's written in the Bible so
[1:16:31] if you die you don't see Abraham
[1:16:33] something is wrong with you
[1:16:34] you must make sure you are where Abraham
[1:16:37] is so when the lamb is screaming on the
[1:16:40] cross
[1:16:42] then he can get there and pull you out
[1:16:45] from there
[1:16:52] do you know the last one to close the
[1:16:55] door of Abraham it was a thief
[1:17:00] come on
[1:17:02] everybody okay he didn't go to the water
[1:17:05] baptism
[1:17:09] they therefore thought he's gonna
[1:17:10] crucify his life
[1:17:13] but the devil positioned him wrong
[1:17:16] [Applause]
[1:17:19] so sometimes the devil put you in the
[1:17:22] corner and think that is where he's
[1:17:24] going to crucify you he's not going to
[1:17:26] crucify you he just positioned you on
[1:17:29] the right spot
[1:17:31] because that's the place you're gonna
[1:17:33] enter Heaven
[1:17:36] who would doubt somebody who got to
[1:17:38] Paradise on the cross
[1:17:43] it doesn't matter where the devil can
[1:17:45] put you God will find you
[1:17:47] [Applause]
[1:17:55] glory to God I was telling somebody I
[1:17:58] say when they say the thief of the Cross
[1:18:00] we miss the trouble
[1:18:01] we don't understand that pretty good
[1:18:03] when they say the thief if you go steal
[1:18:07] something are they gonna kill you
[1:18:10] but those Thief were condemned to death
[1:18:14] so they were not really Thief just fifth
[1:18:17] they were criminals to the highest level
[1:18:22] until the state decided that there is no
[1:18:26] way somebody like this can leave
[1:18:30] they need to send them to the firing
[1:18:33] squad
[1:18:34] but right there the firing squad
[1:18:37] [Music]
[1:18:40] everybody okay somebody just spoke
[1:18:44] and say Lord
[1:18:48] the Bible says no one can call Jesus
[1:18:54] except by their
[1:18:57] can you speak loud
[1:18:58] [Applause]
[1:19:00] are you afraid the Bible said no one can
[1:19:04] call Jesus
[1:19:06] except by water
[1:19:08] so who spoke through that Thief
[1:19:10] [Applause]
[1:19:17] have you ever thought about it
[1:19:20] have you ever thought about it
[1:19:23] what can you speak that would touch the
[1:19:25] Heart of Jesus and Jesus turned around
[1:19:27] he said wait a minute
[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:19:30] today
[1:19:33] you and me we're going to the same place
[1:19:37] [Applause]
[1:19:41] he said Lord remember me and Jesus
[1:19:44] didn't go straight to Abraham
[1:19:47] Jesus went to the souls in prison and he
[1:19:51] left that person go so when he knocked
[1:19:54] at the clock on the door Abraham opened
[1:19:56] the door he said who are you he said I
[1:19:59] am a thief
[1:20:01] Abraham said how can the fifth come here
[1:20:03] he said I don't know sir you ask him
[1:20:07] he told me to be here
[1:20:09] if you have any problem to ask me wait
[1:20:13] for my attorney
[1:20:15] he has my case
[1:20:17] [Applause]
[1:20:20] Abraham could not make it to heaven
[1:20:23] without that person
[1:20:25] [Applause]
[1:20:30] I am stretching you
[1:20:33] in my language they call thatness
[1:20:37] [Applause]
[1:20:39] [Music]
[1:20:42] we got too much Pentecostal study too
[1:20:46] much Pentecostal thinking
[1:20:51] God is a human being
[1:20:55] God is a man
[1:20:57] he's Jesus Christ when you talk to him
[1:21:00] in 2023 talk to him like a man
[1:21:03] he understands you he understands what
[1:21:06] you're going through he's not a strange
[1:21:09] God like Buddha who doesn't understand
[1:21:10] what I went through
[1:21:14] brother Robert whoever start this thing
[1:21:17] here

[1:21:22] wine and the bread and enter into 23. I
[1:21:25] don't think we can make it to the water
[1:21:28] amen let's stand
[1:21:35] [Laughter]
[1:21:38] oh my God I wish we had more time
[1:21:46] amen amen amen

[1:21:57] the last day of the year make an effort
[1:22:00] to be in church
[1:22:02] make it special
[1:22:04] to show God that I'm grateful for
[1:22:06] everything that you have done
[1:22:08] we are alive we made it
[1:22:11] who would have thought when we were in
[1:22:13] kovid 19.
[1:22:16] amen
[1:22:18] oh my God
[1:22:20] let's go to First Corinthians
[1:22:22] chapter 11.
[1:22:25] glory to God
[1:22:28] a wonderful wonderful I'm sorry those
[1:22:31] that online the first video stop at a
[1:22:33] certain time so we started the second
[1:22:35] one we tried to combine both of them
[1:22:38] brother Enoch later on we can put it
[1:22:40] together and put one sermon
[1:22:43] amen
[1:22:44] First Corinthians chapter 11
[1:22:46] verse 20.
[1:22:51] um
[1:22:54] um I calculated all of them but they
[1:22:56] keep going over time
[1:23:01] amen
[1:23:04] glory to God
[1:23:05] if you're there you can say a man let's
[1:23:08] go to verse 20.
[1:23:10] the Bible says when you come together
[1:23:13] therefore into one place
[1:23:15] this is not to eat the Lord's Supper in
[1:23:19] other words we can we're not coming to a
[1:23:21] restaurant where we're sitting because
[1:23:23] we're hungry and we're trying to eat
[1:23:25] food we're not coming because we're
[1:23:27] hungry or we we are hungering for
[1:23:29] something that's not the reason why
[1:23:31] we're coming we're coming as a
[1:23:33] commandment of the Lord the Bible says
[1:23:36] in verse 21 for in eating
[1:23:39] everyone taketh before other his own
[1:23:43] supper and one is hungry and another is
[1:23:47] drunken in other words you're coming
[1:23:49] wrong if you want to eat you eat at home
[1:23:51] but when you come here we're trying to
[1:23:53] do something
[1:23:54] verse 22 Paul say what have ye not
[1:23:58] houses to eat
[1:23:59] and to drinking or despise ye the Church
[1:24:03] of God
[1:24:05] and shame them that have not
[1:24:08] what shall I say to you shall I Praise
[1:24:10] You In This I praise you not in other
[1:24:13] words you don't come here to eat or to
[1:24:15] drink we do that at home we're coming
[1:24:17] here for something else even though it's
[1:24:19] called the Lord supper it's not really a
[1:24:22] natural supper but you have a meaningful
[1:24:24] Christian
[1:24:25] the Bible says in verse 23 for I have
[1:24:28] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:24:32] delivered unto you so what Paul is
[1:24:36] saying here is not something he came up
[1:24:38] with it
[1:24:40] it's not a figment of his imagination
[1:24:42] that he came up and then is that I mean
[1:24:44] instituted something in the church
[1:24:46] so the instruction to the Lord's Supper
[1:24:48] it's a Commandment that came from God
[1:24:51] it's a revelation that was unfolded to
[1:24:53] God because God himself gave communion
[1:24:57] to Abraham in the person of Melchizedek
[1:25:00] he gave him wine and bread
[1:25:02] amen so it's not something that comes
[1:25:05] from human being verse 23 for I receive
[1:25:08] of the Lord that which also are
[1:25:10] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[1:25:13] the Same not in which he was betrayed
[1:25:15] took bread
[1:25:17] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:25:20] and say take it this this is my body
[1:25:25] which is broken for you this do in
[1:25:29] remembrance of me so it's a commandment
[1:25:31] of God to do this to remember him
[1:25:34] brother Bradham say he was in the first
[1:25:36] atonement when Israel was living the
[1:25:38] land of Egypt they have to take the
[1:25:41] bread and break it and eat it and
[1:25:43] brother Branham say watching the old
[1:25:45] atonement that bread kept them 40 years
[1:25:48] walking and kept even their clothing
[1:25:51] and if an anti-tap a shadow can do that
[1:25:55] to human being how much what we have the
[1:25:58] Lamb of God the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:01] amen he says after the man the same
[1:26:04] manner also he took the cup when he had
[1:26:08] stopped saying this cup is the New
[1:26:12] Testament in my blood this du this do ye
[1:26:17] as often as ye drink it in remembrance
[1:26:21] of me amen for as often as you eat this
[1:26:26] bread verse 26 and drink this cup ye do
[1:26:29] show the Lord's death till he come we
[1:26:34] know they're coming
[1:26:36] wherefore whatsoever shall eat this
[1:26:39] bread and drink this cup of the Lord

[1:31:33] approach and to partake of the bread and
[1:31:36] the wine the only thing Lord that can do
[1:31:39] it is the blood of the Lamb that's why

[1:53:02] 13 and verse 1 now before the Feast of
[1:53:05] the Passover when Jesus knew that his
[1:53:08] hour
[1:53:09] tomorrow we got service at 11 o'clock uh
[1:53:12] at 12 o'clock not at 11 o'clock so I'm
[1:53:15] saying that so you're not under pressure
[1:53:18] amen
[1:53:19] now before the Feast of the Passover
[1:53:22] when Jesus knew that his hour was come
[1:53:25] that he should depart out of this world
[1:53:28] unto the father having loved his own not
[1:53:32] everybody
[1:53:33] which were in the world he loved them
[1:53:36] unto the end watch this and supper being
[1:53:41] ended
[1:53:42] just with the way we did it we just
[1:53:45] ended the supper supper been ended the
[1:53:48] devil having put having now put into the
[1:53:51] heart of Judas is carried someone's son
[1:53:53] to betray him Jesus knowing that the
[1:53:56] father has given all things into his
[1:53:58] hand and that he was come from God and
[1:54:01] went to God he risen from supper which
[1:54:04] we just finished
[1:54:06] so we coupling supper with the washing
[1:54:09] of the feet amen Jesus did it himself
[1:54:14] he runs it from supper and laid aside
[1:54:17] His Garment and took a towel and girded
[1:54:20] himself after that he poureth water into
[1:54:24] a basin and began to wash the disciples
[1:54:28] feet and to wipe them with the tower
[1:54:31] wherewith he was girded why do we do
[1:54:35] this
[1:54:36] why do we have to do this
[1:54:38] if it's a commandment we gotta do it
[1:54:41] if the people are not doing it they are
[1:54:44] breaking a commandment of God Amen
[1:54:47] then cometh he to summon Peter and Peter
[1:54:51] say unto him Lord does not wash my feet
[1:54:54] Jesus answered and say unto him what I
[1:54:57] do that no is not now but Thou shalt
[1:55:00] know Hereafter Peter say unto him Thou
[1:55:03] shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered
[1:55:06] him if I wash thee not that has no part
[1:55:09] with me you see how serious this is
[1:55:13] someone it might sound like something
[1:55:15] simple but Jesus said if I don't do it
[1:55:18] you don't have any part with me amen
[1:55:20] Simon Peter say unto him Lord not my
[1:55:24] feet only but also my hands and my head
[1:55:27] Jesus said to him he that is washed
[1:55:30] needed not safe to wash his feet because
[1:55:32] that's where you're walking around but
[1:55:34] he's clean every wheat and ye are clean
[1:55:37] but not all for he knew who should
[1:55:40] betray him therefore say he ye are not
[1:55:43] all clean so after he had washed their
[1:55:46] feet he had taken His Garment and was
[1:55:49] set down again he say unto them know ye
[1:55:52] what I have done to you ye call me
[1:55:56] master and Lord and you say well in
[1:55:58] other words it's true that I'm a master
[1:56:00] and I'm the Lord
[1:56:02] for so I am
[1:56:03] verse 14 if I then your Lord and Master
[1:56:08] have washed your feet ye also ought to
[1:56:12] wash one another's feet
[1:56:16] that's a commandment from the Lord
[1:56:18] so we doing it because God says so
[1:56:22] verse 15 for I have given you an example
[1:56:27] Jesus didn't look at their feet how they
[1:56:29] are or make sure their feet are clean
[1:56:32] before he touched them
[1:56:34] amen he washed all of them one person
[1:56:37] washing all of him
[1:56:39] it's an example verse 15 he said for I
[1:56:41] have given you an example
[1:56:44] that ye should do regardless of your
[1:56:47] sanitation you should do
[1:56:50] as I have done to you
