through my list we got two sisters again tonight I thought they have a family here so they came to visit their family from Europe from Sweden I thought they came visit their family and sometime when you come and maybe a wedding or something going on then you will seek for an address of a church around to go through but that was not the case they actually has been streaming us for years my God and they took a flight from Sweden all the way to the United States just to be in this church so they were here on Sunday and they also came they even learn how to pick up a uber and come here so if you here you don't know how to come to church on Sunday something is wrong if you're staying at home something is wrong because somebody's coming from Sweden and learn how to book a hotel come here take a uber didn't ask anybody and come all the way to service and they staying they are even here tonight hallelujah amen hallelu and tomorrow they will be leaving straight back again to Sweden my God they don't even have a church where they are and they are streaming spoken word Tabernacle so my sister God richly bless you and God will remember you as the Queen of Sheba as you go back may you greet

are and Lord [Music] dear [Music] I all [Music] are God bless you this evening greet you in the lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen it's such a privilege to be with you again uh always get excited when I see my phone I get a text from brother shimo saying are you available to come and so I was not available uh well by the time I responded last week other arrangements were in place and so he said we have the following Wednesday and so uh uh it's it's really a privileged to be with you I was thinking I don't know how many years ago it was when we first made contact and begin to Fellowship but um I see brother Ike here tonight all the way down from Michigan I believe it is and his wife and uh so brother we're family here amen and and and you're a part of us amen and uh we're just uh rehearsing what we're about to enjoy when eternity resumes amen and so um we the you know the the word of the Lord and the spirit of the Lord has Liberty amen and so we always feel that and uh I'm sorry my wife couldn't come with me tonight and and sing um but she's home with the our little daughter there uh Alysa and uh maybe looking in on the service tonight but uh bring greetings from her our pastor brother Josh Bennett uh the associate ministers that y'all wear out when they come here to preach I told someone the other day I said I'm going to brother shimbo Wednesday night I said I've got to start hydrating right now and start exercising and building myself up for what I know is going to happen so um and they they understand what I'm talking about so we really appreciate that and appreciate the goodness of the Lord and to hear we have two sisters here from the country of Sweden may the Lord bless you and uh you know you realize you you feel very small when you when you come into a service like this as a guest Minister especially and you realize God has ordained amen every facet of this service and I'm only a very small piece of it but I want to be yielded so he can have his way this evening and minister to every need in our midst that's that's the God we serve so let's turn in our Bibles tonight to Matthew 24 um I I never come up here feeling like i' I've got a message fully prepared it seems like God gives me pieces and then he puts the pieces together as the service goes on but um uh we'll read here in Matthew 24 uh beginning at verse 37 and uh I believe the title tonight would be common the cause and the Cure that's it amen let's ask the Lord's blessings over the reading of his word just before we read that tonight Heavenly Father we do give you thanks Lord that we could come this evening and gather Worship You Lord and for your presence to come among us as you promised and we pray now Lord that you'll break the bread of life to our hearts take the words from the pages Lord and Quicken them may they become revealed and expressed Lord from our very being we realize Lord that's why you sent your word yes Lord was for it to find bedding ground Lord and for it to manifest in our lives and so we're all here tonight Lord because we want your word to have a greater preeminence and Lord to dissolve everything in our lives that is not you Lord that you can be uh expressed in a greater way and so we believe tonight father God that the holy spirit is preeminent and we'll take every contrary Spirit under its control amen and may every sickness every symptom now Lord Jesus give place to the Holy Spirit as your children have come tonight Lord not to hear from a man but to hear from you Lord and God we're claiming the victory for the service and believing for every need to be met every promise to be fulfilled Lord and for what is needed to be now ministered to your children we ask you Lord to to be the preeminent one and to be pleased father we ask with all that is said and done Lord bind me Father God from speaking myself but Lord give Liberty and unction of the Holy Spirit father God for you to speak and have your way we thank you for it and ask it in the mighty and matchless name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen amen Matthew 24 we'll read uh verses beginning at verse 37 but as the days of Noah were so shall also the coming of the son of man be amen for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of men be then shall two be in the field the one shall be taken the other left two women shall be G grinding at the Mill the one shall be taken and the other left watch therefore for ye know not what hour your lord doth come but know this that if the good man of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore be ye also ready amen for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh all right who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household to give them meat in due season blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing amen verily I say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his Goods but and if that evil servant if that evil servant shall say in his heart my Lord delayeth his C coming and shall begin to Smite his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunken the Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he lookth not for him and in an hour that he is not aware of and shall cut him aunder and appoint him his portion with the Hypocrites and there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth may the Lord bless the reading of his word as you're seated tonight we'll refer to some other places in the scripture yes sir but this will give us a good starting point amen amen I I believe I can say tonight that common is one of the greatest enemies to the Church of the Living God that's exactly right and uh you know we we all have lived long enough to experience the what can happen yes sir when things become common that's exactly right you know uh it could be something as simple as a car you know when it's new or when it's new to you uh it's shiny it's got the new car smell the tires are fresh and everything about it and you know you you are just looking for a good reason to get in that car and drive somewhere you know and because it's it's new it's fresh and and you appreciate it amen you know you're going to get a lot of good use out of it but but just give that car a few months or a few years and the tires get worn down and you're having to make the payments and do the maintenance and all those things on it and and you'll be thinking man I I just need a new car you know I'm tired of this thing I'm tired of that rattle I'm tired of that shake I'm tired of that knock I'm tired of this and I'm tired of that you know and you think I I I I'm going I'm not even done paying for this thing but I'm ready to trade it in on something you know that's new that's fresh because you know and and and and the new car may not even be better but you're at least going to be excited about it and you're going to be enthused about it brother I I'm going to tell you a secret tonight that'll save you a whole lot of money go ahead my brother take that old raggedy beat up car that you're sick and tired of and just go out one Saturday morning amen before the kids get up and before the sun gets up way high in the sky before the phone starts ringing and all these distractions come and take that same car and give it a good wash that's it that's it give it a good vacuum and out spray it full of eror fresh yes some Tire wax it Tire polish it yes sir Shine the tires on it that's right clean the car up give it some tender love and care and attention for Sunday and you know what before long you'll have a new car again amen without a payment that's right without all those other headaches and misery that follows it in other words you just need to put some effort into it that's my brother to make it like new again yes my brother and you know as simple as that may seem some sometimes our Christian experience can be the same way amen you know starting off things are fresh things are new things are exciting things are exhilarating and there's an eager anticipation for every meeting that's right you know when a church is new to you man I can't wait to get to church brother I'm going to be the first one there amen I'm going to get my seat I'm going to pray I'm going to get ready amen I'm going to be ready for the word of the Lord I'm going be ready for the song leader amen and you're there amen you're putting a lot of effort a lot of preparation and there's a lot of anticipation amen because it's new to you all the people are new the building is new everything is new amen and you and you and you're just excited about it amen right well then after a few years man come on now is it Sunday morning again is it 10:00 again why can't they move to service time back at 30 minutes or an hour it's so hard to make it to church on time and man you know oh am I going to have to sit beside sister so and so again it's brother so and so G to sing lead the songs again and is brother Steven still on that same series that he's been on for huh ain't nothing changed that's right except your approach the new has worn off amen my brother oh brother I know it's the truth take amen the new has worn off that's right things become ordinary that's right and if you let it go it'll become dull and even dreary that's right where you will dread the very things amen you once couldn't wait to do Hallelujah and couldn't wait to be a part of it and you know what you're thinking I need a new church I need a new pastor preach I need new surroundings preach no friend you need a Revival that's exactly right you need God to do something new on the inside of you amen hallelujah hallelujah glory to God oh my we often become disappointed there seems to be a decline that's right in the effect or the results while we're failing to recognize yes my brother we're not investing the same effort that's exactly right that we used to my brother so so the problem is not with everybody else no sir and the problem is not with the building and the property and the people and the pastor and the song leader and the same old same old amen the problem is much closer to home sometimes than what we really want with us so what I want to say tonight common is the enemy that's right common is the enemy of any relationship yes my brother amen friendships yes my brother friendships wne when the friends become common that's exactly right you know when you got a new friend you want him to come over for supper you want to take him ficient you want everything's new you're learning what all their interests all their likes are all these things and you're investing a lot of time and a lot of effort in a new friendship take your time my brother take your time I just going to say it take your time a new family moves into the area or comes to church everybody surrounds them yes my brother they're new yes sir and everybody's excited oh my it's a new husband and a new wife and and new children and look at their look what they drive and kind of job he has and all these things M and they're getting song requests and test them and we want to put them on the Deacon board the trustee board because they're new take your time we're all excited God sent somebody new and friends there ain't nothing wrong with that no sir sometimes new brings Revival Hallelujah you get a new Christian in the door yes sir somebody gives their heart to the Lord and they begin seeing all the scriptures and all the promises of God and the power of God Amen is really impacting their life that can revive an entire church there's nothing wrong with that amen but we let the new wear off yes my brother take your time and we find out those people are people uhhuh and they got problems that's right and their children have got problems that's right and they need help and and you know they're they're they're they're not as superhuman as what we had imagined them to be that's exactly right and all of a sudden they're just another member of the church again take your time my brother preach it oh my preach my brother preach things that were once appreciated that's right are taken for granted that's exactly I'm thinking about because this can affect the marriage oh definitely preach my brother preach take your time oh my preach my brother amen take your time things that were once appreciated that's exactly are now expected preach and taken for granted that's right it used to be special amen but now if you don't happen what went wrong amen you know it's the truth little little little gestures little touches yes my brother that that were once effortless now become a Choy yes sir a chore a chore they got to a chore to buy candy it's a chore to buy flowers it's a chore to write a little love note a little card because we've we've taken the spouse for granted that's exactly right am me I I'm Shackled to them now I tell people I've served let me think for a minute how many years I've been married it's 20 it's 2024 it this year in June I'll be married 24 years and I tell people amen take your time my brother there's a lot of people getting married in 1999 uhhuh cuz they thought if y 2k comes we waited till June of 20 and we got married so we're one year away from being silver but you know you get you get married to somebody and and I tell people and I joke and I said I've served 24 years of a life sentence and I'm not looking to be paroled no sir amen I'm a prisoner of love that's it but you know you think hey I'm bound yes my brother I'm bound to them by marriage coming he can't leave me she can't leave me but you can grow up par that's it that's it preach my brother friends a separation doesn't begin at the courthouse that's it it ends there that's it it begins years that's right before it ever enters an attorney's office or ends up in the hands of a judge take your time you begin to distance yourself that's you lose the love that's right you lose the heat the passion amen the interest the desire the things that you used to use to put effort into the relationship it grows cold that's exactly right and you still love and you still care and you still invest it but you invest it in other places that's exactly right the children take your time the job the friends take your time the the the the hunt and the fish and the all the all the other things even in ministry that's exactly right you can invest your emotions into something that is good uhhuh but it's not your marriage that's exactly right amen I tell ministers this I tell preachers this and then I have to live it myself friend you made a commitment at an altar you made a vow to that sister that's it you made a vow to that woman amen that's right and your ministry should never get in the way of that vow that's exactly right amen that's exactly you owe it to her to love her in sickness and in health for rich or for poor amen whatever the case and if your ministry gets in the way of that you are compromising the very qualifications that can keep you in a ministerial office exactly right the balance need the balance my brother oh but we excuse ourselves with the prophet's actions well he hunted on his honeymoon and he made these trips and he missed all this and friends you ain't called to be the prophet that's exactly right you don't have the same office you don't have the same responsibility and the world is not going to perish because

heard brother Henry Simmons say one time he said if you want to get what you used to get you're going to have to do what you used to do that's exactly right take your time if you want to get something out of it you're going to have to start investing back into it like you used to then you'll see some results amen amen then you'll see some rewards glory to God preach my brother take your time you know over time those things just just Fall by the wayside and we realize something's changed Something's Happened yes glory to God but when you know you need it amen amen you appreciate it that's right amen when you when you're on the other side of the trial that's exactly with the crisis yes my brother you know crisis have a way of bringing us closer to God take your time take your time you know why take your time because we realize we need God ahen when the bank is full and everybody loves you and you're riding High amen and you're the popularity and everybody admires you you forget you need God preach my brother and your prayer life goes cold uhhuh your relationship with God goes by the wayside and you I'm blessed brother Tim look at all that God that don't mean God loves you or God's blessing you that's it that may mean God is testing you that's it yes my brother to see if you're love and devotion and Consecration and dedication will remain a constant amen whether life is here or whether life is there the highs and lows of Life prove yes my brother who real Christians are amen amen amen and a real genuine Christian that's living in the holiest of holies yes my brother will maintain that constant Hallelujah through thicker thin amen amen amen amen glory to God preach when you know you need it you appreciate we see it often times a Crist of strikes something is taken or you know you enter a situation it's a dire straight you realize I need God you get on your knees and you pray and you're fasting and you're you're taking time apart to be with the Lord and you draw close to the Lord again yes sir yes my well friend we should stay there that's it but we we don't because we're human we're human so it's an enemy to the marriage you know what I thought this is probably what what went wrong with Samson huh take your time his his power the the anointing of the holy spirit that would come over him to give him this superhuman power was a result of a vow right that was made right but I believe that the the the the the um the effect of that became common that's that's the problem to Samson he let let a gift he let a promise he let a divine blessing take your time become common take your time and when it did it began to lose the way he perceived its value it reached a place yes sir where it meant more to the Philistines than it meant to him take your time they never lost sight of how valuable that gift was that's exactly right until off after he had become their prisoner for many years that's exactly right but while it was losing its value to Samson take your time he was becoming weakened in his faith or in his appreciation that's right and he was on his road to Peril right he was on his way to becoming reduced right lower than his fellow man lower than his brother why because he began to play with that gift that's exactly right he could he could be with a prostitute and the gift would still work preach my brother preach now he could quit paying his tith and he would still get a blessing he could start missing church and God would still blessing he could start living loose and still God did not revoke the gift my so the gift would begin to operate and exercise itself and Samson thought you know no matter what I do your no matter how I live no matter what I do God loves me God has blessed me I'm Invincible I'm bulletproof I'm impenetrable and the whole time the Philistines were getting closer and closer and closer and closer brother and with every time he described her he thought you know he thought he thought he was seducing Delilah no she was seducing him that's exactly she never loved him Hallelujah she was an instrument in the hand of the Philistines brother to reduce him that's right to just another man glory to God my brother he lost his appreciation that's right friends I wonder if the same enemy isn't fighting against the bride of Christ that's exactly right that's exactly to make her lose her appreciation that's right not only for the prophet in his ministry but for the gifts God has placed in the body that's exactly to be the continuation of that Ministry right amen oh my friend Satan's real good at it oh my my brother there's even a there's even a proverb that deals with that how how the buyer will say it's nothing it's nothing until he takes it from you then he marks it up and resells it that's it so it's the enemy yes sir when leadership becomes common right right oh that's just brother shimbo take your he just or or that's just the deacons or that's just the trustees they become common take your time what happens is we lose our respect stay right there for the office stay right there for the position and see friends what we fail to realize is it's not the person alog together it's a channel that God has ordained for your benefit but you lose respect for the office and you get your eyes on the person and say well he's just as he's got the same mistakes got the same problems got the same fallacies that I've Got Friends it ain't about the person all together but God has placed that man in an office God has placed that person in an office for your benefit and if you can respect that and have regards to that God can bless bless you through that channel glory to God amen amen now now this is a this is an area I have to be careful because it it would sound like I'm condoning loose living in the ministry and I'm not sir no sir a Ministry is going to be accountable to God one day for every action and every statement yes my brother absolutely and there not only accountable to God is accountable also to the congregation that's exactly right absolutely yes absolutely Amen brother but I want to show you that even a backslid minister can be a channel for a blessing pre now it's in the Bible yes sir remember when Hannah was Desiring a child that's exactly right Eli was backslid that's right his sons were backslid that's right amen Israel was suffering as a result of a backsliding priesthood that's right but Hannah was looking beyond the priest and asking God for a promise amen and because she had respects yes my brother she had respects to the channel yes sir she still came to the temple to worship God to offer this sacrifice she didn't care how backsliding the preachers were she didn't care how much nonsense was going on she said I'm not here for the preacher I'm not here for the pastor I'm not here for the song leader I'm here to worship God glory to God Amen it is not what other people make of it it's what you make of it it's your respects it's your approach it's your sincerity God will bless through that channel amen when you have the right approach take your time my brother I'm sorry brother like this be my last service the pastor the pastor becomes common to the people or the people become too common become common to the P to the pastor that's exactly pre my brother oh that's just for the shimbo you know friend ministers hold yourself with the dignity hold yourself like a son of the king hold yourself like a prince you're a prince in a kingdom you've been given a position hold yourself amen that way amen don't give the people cause that's exactly right to lose respect that's exactly right for the office that you hold that's exactly right amen yes my brother but when they become common to each other uhhuh the respect is lost that's right and the little things begin to dissolve away that's exactly right the things you once appreciated the things you once admired yes sir the things that once touched your heart right you become numb to that amen and it doesn't affect you anymore glory to God even even God's Prophet amen lost his feeling for the people that's exactly right that's exactly absolutely yes sir and friends I I will tell you this and you know it's true take if you lose that you also lose the ability to help people that's exactly right yes my brother yes my brother I'm reading here uh from the message take your time hear you him 1959 hear you himm yes sir he's paragraph 49 the Bible said ye are the salt of the earth yes my brother the salt's a Savor if it contacts that's exactly right but if it's lost its strength no matter how much it contacts that's where the church is yes sir that that's what's the matter they have lost their brotherly love amen they've lost their feeling amen for one another amen the world the people are looking for something that's real that's exactly right they've seen so much mockery so much put on people say yes I'm a Christian I believe in Divine Healing and then act different yes sir say I'm a Christian go out and put on them kind of clothes that's right say I'm a Christian and go out and smoke cigarettes and shoot Dice and do all these other kinds of things shame on you that's exactly I love you but brother I'd rather give you just a little correction now than when I come to the Judgment you'll say brother Brandon I'm so glad you've done it brother let me tell you something friend compassion is not [Music] approval compassion is not a wholesale license to do what whatever you want to do and say God loves you anyway no friend that's not the gospel the gospel says here is the truth here is the way here is what will free you from the bondage of sin amen and loose you from that yes amen I'll give you a scripture those the lord loves he rebukes amen and chases that's EXA amen and the proof that you are his children you are zealous and you repent yes brother amen glory to God I'd rather just give you a little correction now than when I come to judgment you say brother Bram I'm so glad you've done it yes sir it's too late then yes my brother what we need is a love and respect for God Amen and for his people amen amen no matter what they belong to the denomination as long as their brothers their brother that's it we need a love for one another that's it and love will contact that's it when nothing else would do it amen amen amen let me just um I just this was on my heart and I didn't have it written down I could use another word in the place of common and that is casual and I'm afraid in the day and hour which we're living in right the house of God right the people of God right the the ministry everything we we we've taken a very casual I see it I see it where I travel I see it at the church I call home that's exactly right my brother we're having prayer meeting well I'll come if I can let let me make sure I don't have you know a work event uh an event uh you know the children don't have soccer practice uh let me let me check my calendar casual come if I can and the church will go on with or without me friends what if everybody had that attitude if God has called you to be a part of a local assembly you are an integral part of that assembly and every service needs your involvement every service amen you are one of the s yes sir you are one of the members of that body and it will not fun the same without you and if you can recognize God has placed me in this body and I whether I sing whether I pray whether I preach or do anything I'm going to be there yes amen sir I'm going to be present amen I'm going to come to church early and be prayed up prepared get my mind off the world get my mind off my job get my mind on Christ brother when the Holy Ghost fell in the upper room they were in one mind and one Accord they had been there for 10 days and the only people left was the people that wanted to be there and was not going to leave until God fulfilled his Divine promise and when it got down to 120 the Holy Ghost fell yes my brother take your time take your time my brother take your time I'm going to say something take your time we used to have meetings until [Music] uhhuh we used to have Revival meetings and said this is when the meeting's going to start on this night at this time and it ain't going to stop until and night after night after night after night we met and the word of God was preached and the power of God fell and God healed God saved God delivered the barrooms closed amen the legislation everybody recognize there's a move of God down there in that area amen why because it was not common but there was a Zeal there was a fervent desire there was a dedication there was a consecration there was a dying out yes my brother to every other thing glory to God Amen if we're going to get what we used to get we're going to have to do what we used to do brother oh but we're revelated now brother Tim pre my brother we got the Bible on our I phones and iPads we got the message 24/7 and it's lost its value come on come on we don't appreciate it like we did that's right when we used to get one book every couple months uhh or a new cassette tape you appreciate it when it was rare that's right when it was rare it had a higher perceived value yes my brother but it hasn't lost any of its worth still the same it's just the way we look at it that's exactly right take your time my brother preach go on a little farther yes sir take your time what I'm showing you is if it can happen to a servant of God a prophet of God it can happen to us too that's right he's here in the uh I believe it's in the message glor standing in the Gap yes sir he said you see even the great St Paul got between the Straits one time and and many times God has did these things yes sir did things or let his servants do it that was mistakes in order to prove these things well that would stump people God let his servants make mistakes to prove things yes sir now we know that human beings can make mistakes but God can make no mistake that's exactly like that is exactly right now if I get into the field of preaching and going the way I do then I have to set up meetings ahead and get things lined up and perhaps this great time is coming that we've been looking for this in itself is a tremendous thing that will bring to pass and make come to pass the tremendous Victory yes sir in the love divine the prophecy that went forth that's right that's the verb for the adverb it's divine love which is God Amen and it takes the love of God Amen to dash out there on the front line amen and stand in the Gap yes sir for the people amen well I'm going to stop there for a minute I'm going to say this take your time people who people who work in public service uh um doctors nurses healthc care uh you may work in the courts you may be a firefighter a police officer a a first responder and you deal with people right day in and day out yes you see them at their worst and maybe occasionally you see them at their best but over time you can become jaded and it just becomes routine it it's just you know you're just going through the motions and people stop becoming people and they become objects that's exactly right that's exactly right yes my brother just another drunk uhhuh just another drug that's it just another person eat up with this or eat up with that I just need this medicine or this and it becomes no more conscience we lose our compassion that's exactly we lose our care and we lose our concern and friends you lose the effectiveness that's exactly right of the Christian faith that's exactly right oh brother Tim I'm a Christian I love God you don't love God if you don't love his creation that's exactly like it if you don't love The Sinner if you don't love the person Amen in the in the in the gutter something is wrong you really don't love God that's exactly right because Jesus loved the sinner he was redeeming something back to himself that had been separated and lost in the fall yes my brother he came to seek and to save that which was lost and if his Divine attributes reside in you you will have to have the same compassion hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah take your time if you've lost your feeling if you've lost your love if you've lost that care and that concern and that that genuine compassion friend you can't fake that people know they know when you care that's it they can tell by the look in your eyes they can feel your soul reaching out to them in compassion and friend that is the secret ingredient that is what makes you an extension of his healing his salvation his love when that opens up and begins to administer forth from your soul through your fingers through your hands Through Your Eyes through your prayers brother you be become the gospel live amen you become the revelation of the message of the hour you become the Bible live you become an extension or a continuation of the book of Acts my brother glory to God Amen there's a song that says bring back the new again sometimes that's all we need yes sir is for God to make it new again amen amen amen amen amen take your time my brother this happened to the prophet he's in paragraph 159 he said these Ricky and ricettas that have so sassed the word that I've called them Ricky and Retta God give me to understand that I shouldn't do that because that's many of them are still his children that's exactly right they can't help because they act so much different some of these old cold formal churches that's it has got them that Spirit upon them and they're as much in prison as Israel was in prison just as much as Moses went down to deliver them from slavery human beings that love Jesus Christ would serve him if they only know what to serve him by yes my brother and they're in bondage yes sir they're in bondage under denominationalism that tells them don't you do this don't you do that but the all of God must come whoever wants to March toward the promised land let him March we're on our road to the promised land amen let them come March I remind you of the time the disciples came to Jesus said Lord we found some folks casting out Devils yes and we we stopped them stopped they're not in our Circle they're not they're not wearing the belt buckles and and little pinss with special logos Jesus said if they're not against us they're for us let them [Applause] alone you know what some people's problem they're so insecure and what they want to believe is the truth anybody else that don't see it or say it quite the same way makes them so uncomfortable they want to put him out of the Kingdom amen uh it's true amen Moses lost the feeling of his people because they wouldn't listen to him it can happen it can happen to the best of pastors deacons trustees you get weary you get weary dealing with people but friends remember it isn't the people it's spirits and you got to have something greater you got to have something greater than what they have if you're going to conquer what's trying to conquer them and what the devil is really really good at is getting us to descend to his level and fight the way they fight and retaliate retaliate and tip tat and you start comparing what they say and you come back with friend you've already lost you've already lost you need the greater the greater will love will pray will Embrace will long for their amen Revival and restoration Love Will Conquer but it's got to be genuine you you you just can't you can't fake that Moses lost his feeling for the people because they wouldn't listen to him he's talking about brother Roy and a dream he had brother B said this something's got to change me now if God's Prophet could say that we're certainly not exempt something's got to change me because I in my heart if I go out there feeling that way I do now I still feel that they ought to have heard that message they ought to have done it and I don't have the feeling for the people that I should have until I get that feeling there is no need in me going because I'd be a hypocrite right let I ask you a question did the man have an office amen did he have a gift was any of that forfeited no but he said if I don't have that feeling I'm a hypocrite don't take things for gretting it had become common and all these years after all these years I've tried to serve him with a true heart I won't go out there being a hypocrite I got to feel feel that it isn't Rick andrietta and it isn't this Bunch it's God's children that's in bondage that I must go to and until I feel that way I'll just have to loaf around it's quite a statement you I love one thing about brother Bram I love everything about him but one thing especially he was so transparent yes he brother Bram was not a put on he he he was not a hypocrite no pretenses pray that God will place into my heart that something that I lost out there in that complex it's so easy to build a complex I had an interview the other day with brother way sitting there standing here in front a good man but but built himself around a complex another kind of a complex did the same thing brother way you can so easily do it it's just you let a little something in your mind keep thinking that way go back and check it with the scripture and see if it's right or not and then go from there on my friend I I'm I've lived long enough to know how the devil Works he will put an idea in your head and that thing will sit there and fester and form and you will imagine someone else feels a certain way about you and there could be no basis to it whatsoever but as long as you let that thing stay there in your mind the devil's going to keep watering it and Fanning it and trying to grow that thing you know I I know a Pulpit is not a place for jokes but I heard some years ago said a man broke down on the side of the road this is many many years ago uh broke down on the side of the road and needed a tune like a a tire uh lug nut wrench taking the tire off and he didn't have one and he saw way off down in the distance there was a a a candle lit you can see some light coming from a a cabin and so uh he knew they'd gone to bed but somehow they left it on but anyway he walked and walked and walked and you the whole time he's walking he's said you know what I'm going to wake these people up they're going to be tired they're going to be weary they're going to be ill they're going to be upset that I woke him up and the whole time he's approaching this house he's building in his mind I'm going to be resented I'm going to be despised they're going to be so they're going to be furious and he finally got the courage to knock on the door and man it and before he could say how could I help he said fine I didn't want your old wrench anyhow he was defeated in his mind and the man was more than happy to help him but that is what the devil does and you know what he'll get you so cornered he'll get you so corned in a prison that he may you won't have the courage to go confront it or approach that brother approach that sister and clear the air and brother I can't stand that I can't stand that if something's there and I feel that and I think that's going on I just go right up to the brother I go right up to the sister amen and I'm going to do the opposite I'm going to speak to him I'm going to talk to him I'm going to defeat that Spirit I'll buy him lunch I'll do whatever it takes amen I don't want no qualms I don't want no weird feelings I don't want it because that is nothing but the devil trying to bring division in the body of Christ because he knows how powerful we are when we are unified together amen blessed be the tith that binds our hearts in Christian Love The Fellowship of Kindred Minds is like to that above amen oh my I got to get to the I got to get to the Cure well I I got to go to the scripture y'all shouldn't say take your time everybody who knows me knows you don't say that but I want you to watch because Jude and Peter both discerned what was going to take place and was already forming in the early Christian Church only a few years after the Lord Jesus ascended I want you to read uh uh Scofield's note here in the in the heading of Jude he said it is not so much Jude who speaks as the constraining spirit and the theme is contending for the faith in other words you're not taking it for granted you're fighting to maintain it and to keep it amen don't let it become common and he says in this brief letter the apostasy of the professing church is predicted and the cause and course described as in second Timothy and and second Peter the apostasy is treated as already having set in now if it was starting there how much worse is it now but Jude Jude addresses the church and he says Jude the servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James to them that are Sanctified by God the father and preserved in Jesus Christ and called Mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ I will therefore put you in remembrance though ye once knew this how that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterward destroyed them that believed not and the angels which kept not their uh their first estate but have left their habitation he hath reserved in ever lasting chains under Darkness unto the Judgment of this great day even as Sodom and gomor and the cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh are set forth for an example suffering the Vengeance of Eternal fire now he goes on and I I know it's getting late but Lord help us we're going to we're going to get to the Cure likewise Yet Michael the Archangel when cont contending with the devil he dis he disputed about the body of Moses Durst not bring against him a railing accusation but said the Lord rebuke thee he knew this was an archangel who had fallen and he didn't argue with him he didn't lower himself to the level of Satan he said you might have fallen but I'm not Fallen with you he just said the Lord rebuke you amen but these these speak evil of those things which they know not but what they know naturally as brute beasts in those things they corrupt themselves woe unto them for they have gone in the way of Cain and ran greedily after the error of balum for reward and perished in the gain saying of Kor these are spots in your Feast of Charity when they Feast with you feeding themselves without fear clouds are they are without water carried about of winds trees whose fruit withth without fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots I'm just reading down through here for continuity Raging Waves of the sea foaming out their own shame wondering Stars wondering from church to church ministry to Ministry Pillar To Post spectacular to spectacular to whom is reserved the Blackness of Darkness forever and Enoch our type also the seventh from Adam prophesied of these saying behold the Lord cometh with 10, thousands of his Saints to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly Deeds which they have ungodly committed and of all their hard speeches which ungodly Sinners have spoken against him now he's going to describe it there are murmurers complainers walking after their own lust and their mouth speaketh great swelling words having men's persons in admiration because of Advantage politics this person can do something something for me therefore I'm going to praise them adore them exalt them and be as close to them as I can what that person is doing for you is taking you down but because you think you're going to gain something by your association with him they have pulled you in just like Satan pulled onethird of the stars but they didn't go up they went down but beloved remember ye the Words which were spoken before of the Apostles you hear a recurring theme here remember remember remen I will not be I will I will not neglect to put you in remembrance how that they told you there would be mockers in the last time who should walk after their own lust these be they who separate themselves sensual having not the spirit friend everything that's spiritual don't come from God the devil is very spiritual and has a whole lot of Supernatural things that are demonic so just because it's got a supernatural manifestation don't mean it come from God take it to the word if it's not saying what the prophet said it's a lie it's off the word amen it's it's it's it's poison guards friend amen oh my want to preach but I got to wrap up but ye beloved here's the Cure building up yourselves on your Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost keep yourselves in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life and of some have compassion have compassion brother and sister making a difference amen I I I want to I want to come to a close here tonight making a difference y'all know I do heat and air conditioning all right I'm in kind of in that field I do cells now but it's it's related to heat and air conditioning I got a scriptural Ministry brother Ike I would that word hot or cold man I got some good inspiration out of this too God does not want us to be thermometers they only tell the temperature God wants us to be thermostats they can change the temperature they are connected to a source of energy and they can be tuned amen God they threw three thermostats in the fiery furnace one time and God come along and cooled It Off and they threw two of them in a Philippian jail one time and God busted a place apart to get them out of there amen you can change the atmosphere amen where you work oh my where you go to school at a family reunion wherever you are you can glow you can impart healing you can impart salvation you can not only make a difference you can be the difference heyen I want to tell you when the 120 went in the upper room they were scared they was afraid they were fearful they were cowards they were weak they were waiting on power brother right but when they come out of that upper room they was making a difference the Holy Ghost is the cure for the common Christian a refilling an initial feeling the baptism of the Holy Ghost will set you on fire and Quicken the very life of God from the very core of your being [Applause] amen but there's three Rs and I am closing three hours repentance and the return you won't have a Revival without it amen honey I'm wrong hardest words for man to say I know it is I'm a man it's the hardest thing to confess I was wrong honey you were right but said you want the spark back you want the flame back you want the love back amen you don't need a new car you don't need a new wife you don't need a new husband you don't need a new church you need to appreciate the one you have and put some effort put some time put some energy forsaking other things Hallelujah forsaking all others cleave thee only unto her cleave thee only unto him just go back to your original vow read The Vow amen that you said over her with God as your witness am amen repentance and a return and restoration restoration before the fire fell on the altar Elijah put the stones back in their place because you won't get a Revival fire without a restoration that precedes it and I've already touched on it but friends get things back in their proper order leoa has a good way has a powerful way it's not good a powerful way of rearranging our priorities to where everything is out of place and God has taking last place and the marriage the family everything begins to disolve apart it begins to disintegrate because God lost his place restoration involves putting things back in their place put the family altar back in the home put Bible reading and prayer back in your daily regimen start your day and in your day and all throughout the day make God an integral part of your day and then Revival will follow amen I got out one of my favorite books the other day and I started reading it again and I was reminded of why it's one of my favorite books is it all right if I show it to you brother George Smith has kind of taking it and uh reindexed it just a bit but it's the same contents amen let me show you another reason why Satan hates this book of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the church he knows that Jesus Christ is the same same yesterday today and forever and he changes not he knows that a whole lot more than do 90% of the theologians remember the Philistines didn't lose their appreciation it was Samson that first lost it and he didn't regain it until the Philistines lost their remembrance to keep that hair trend when they begin to take him for granted they laid off the barber at the wrong time amen he knows that since God is immutable in his nature then he is just as immutable in his ways thus Satan knows assuredly that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own all else is false it has to be now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless common casual it exposes Satan revealing his works the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he is cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them amen friends I've got to close tonight it's it's it's getting late but go read if you will if you want a homework assignment go read the entire Epistle of second Peter because he's hitting the same exact themes that Jude did they both by the revelation of the Holy Spirit were able to see that and Antichrist Spirit already creeping in in the early church and its effects in the day and hour which we're living but it teaches us to be vigilant To Be watchful we want to be that servant that the master finds so doing at his return we want to be living in eager anticipation every day brother Kelly looking for the coming of the Lord Lord Jesus amen we don't want to grow relaxed or casual and we don't want to let our experience grow that and friends if that's where you are tonight you can be revived you can be renewed you can be drawn back into that you can experience that all over again and you may appreciate it more the second time than you did the first but just know that's for you tonight amen and and and and God help us and Grant that that desire of our heart amen we're we're coming up to the Easter time the Easter season amen may it be an Easter amen a resurrected life of Jesus Christ within each and every one of

here to be in church for two service yes sir they don't have any church they are streaming us from swetland and they're coming from Sweden all the way here don't let this become common don't let dis Services become common don't let Wednesday become common don't let Sunday become common whatever you have to do put him last take God back to his first place when it's Church put everything down when it's Church day make sure on Tuesday you put gas in your car you you remove all the shopping around that's what I do that's what I do I don't want to be track in the traffic and then I have to stop in the gas station because five minute on the highway can give me more Mage prepare your day of service prepare your day what happened why you not there why are you missing so much Services what is happening today you there today you there today you there today you are the only one visiting why don't take this common amen do not take this common why are you not in question and answer anymore why you never been there why every time there is a meeting you got a reason why why every day there is a church you got a problem and it doesn't even bother you to stream because you got used to be streaming I can be I can do whatever you don't even search for for a solution to come out from your situation because I can stay home and I can stream if it's a little bit of rain streaming if the weather is dark streaming if the dog is coughing streaming I'm going very low so you understand what I'm saying don't let this become common this is a great warning for everybody don't let the ministry don't let the Deacon don't let the the song leader become chroma I appreciate the song leader standing here doing his job I appreciate the one playing in the piano when he take a day off you will realize he need to be there when he's not there you will realize we need somebody on the guitar when he's not there you will realize we need somebody on the base everything is sounding beautiful we all love the worship tonight watch here you will see everybody is on their postor Duty and brother Bram say he was not even putting meeting on Sunday morning because everybody need to go back to their post of Duty post of Duty doesn't mean that you have to be a minister or a deacon or a singer if you only come to church on time because you a musician something is wrong probably amen if you only have to come on time in the service because you have a responsibility something is wrong because if they take responsibility off guess what you don't have to be in church on time you can come late because I'm not a trustee I'm not a deacon I'm not a technician I'm not a musician that's a wrong approach in other word they they want doing the work me I'm just enjoying that's wrong postor Duty might be just sitting in the church and saying amen that is your post of [Applause] Duty there was a sister by the name of sister Bell she died and brother Bram on tape is saying how much am I going to miss those big amen so when brother brandham was preaching God was using the amen of that sister to stimulate brother Bram so that brother Bram can preach more but if you're not there if you streaming all the time what do you expect from the kids post of Duty means sitting right there it's your post to do this is why people do not understand they think that okay find your position in Christ means okay I got to be a deacon I got to be a minister that doesn't not everybody is going to speak in tongue Paul say no God forbid it's not going to happen your position could be just clapping hand maybe the tambourine sister Hamilton is playing over there that's her Ministry to the Lord if she's not there we feel like something is missing so do you only come to church when we're going to give you a position so if I take you to a position if I tell you to sit down you don't come to church on time anymore do you see what we doing because we don't understand what God is doing you being here you on the post of Duty you receiving the word you on your post of Duty you saying amen on the post of Duty whoever is here it's on the post of Duty post of Duty is in your church right there on your pews whoever is sitting there it's on the PE you on the even the mama who's sitting there with the kids and nursing the baby they in the post Dy they would probably never preach the gospel but that's their post of Duty sir amen do not let this become common people are far away you don't know how many email how many phone call I'm rece I can't even respond to I have email for month that I cannot respond you get it for free all you have to do is dve be careful we're not lining up this preacher like this it's the Holy Spirit who speak to me say now it's te cross now it's so and so now it's so and so that's the way I'm moving and when he comes you will always see them line up I don't tell I never tell a preacher what to preach one of these days the pressure of The ecumenical council will close churches you will remember these days you will remember the time that sister so and so was singing a special you will remember those day don't take this common somebody's going with pain because they're going back to the situation where there is no church today they experience this week what is like being in church for years they right there you have it here don't let it become common when it become common brother Steven Ison the singers are common everything is common and the next thing that start is a criticism Spirit then you begin to criticize the song leader not about the song but about maybe the wayes the voice was going maybe a voice it's not about the voice it's a Ministry but when you are under the anointing of the spirit you don't see all those kind of stuff but when you drop low this is when you begin to see every everything that is wrong this is when you cold this is when you begin to pull back just know something is wrong the devil got you right there either God will revive you like he gave you a solution or at the end of the day you will search for a reason to Eclipse but if you Eclipse you have not solved the situation God will put you to another test wherever you going because you do not understand appreciate one another I appreciate the minister coming like this and serving and preaching the word of the Lord I appreciate them am I appreciate them because they also have a local church they came here don't take it common amen don't take it come on don't take your wife come on don't take your children come on don't take that car God gave you come on don't take that house come on don't neglect that house and let it be all kind of garbage in the house because at the beginning oh don't touch the wall don't do this don't this
