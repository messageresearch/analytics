discuss in a committee we will see what we will do moving forward and everybody will be informed about it some people were already informed those that I hope that stays abreast with the information but we need to talk and then to see what we can do and how we need to proceed as far as our ways of worshipping together so by the grace of God just continue to pray so this coronavirus clears up and then we can come back again in fellowship together god bless you if you would you can go straight to your scripture and you know my style now we read 1 and relate to be seated things we need to build up a little bit Zechariah chapter 12 verse 10 we will get into a very very deep water today so those that have been staying following the cirrie 1 2 3 you should be okay so just stay really awake Zechariah chapter 12 verse 10 if you dare you can say Amen we read the scripture I don't know if it's part 4 or 6 or something but you should be familiar with this now and I will pour upon the house of David you might be saved I don't want to keep you standing too long I will pour upon the house of David and upon the inhabitant of Jerusalem the spirit of grace we all know that spirit of grace is the holy spirit that's going to the Jewish people if you miss that you can go back and then listen to the other sermon the spirit of grace and of supplication so somebody will be mourning somebody will be in distress somebody will be sad it's a spirit of grace but yet there is a supplication connected to it and they will look upon me whom they have pierced when they're talking about piercing is referring to the cross Jesus was not pierced in Gethsemane Jesus was not pierced in pilot-house hallway Jesus was pierced at the cross so this scripture is talking about the cross there is a souvenir there is a memory in reference to the cross so he said they will look upon me whom they have pulled and they shall mourn there is a mourning even the Holy Spirit is there and they shall mourn for him as one mourns for His only Son and he was the only begotten - and shall be in bitterness for him it's a feast of atonement it will be deep water so just hang on as one that is in the bitterness for his firstborn we know clearly that this is speaking about the Jews the spirit of grace the holy spirit living the Gentile going to the Jewish people they received the holy spirit then Jesus Christ will present himself to the Jews and they will recognize Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ will show them the piercing the scar that he has coming from the nails if you would again we can go still in Zechariah chapter 13 verse 1 if you dare you can say a man you need to keep your bubble in that day they shall be a fountain open when they say a fountain this is not a literal phantom when they say fountain they are referring to a person if you need most on that you see me the Bible spoke in the Book of Jeremiah God spoke to Israel he said Israel have committed to crumbs to sins they have forsaken me the fountain of living water right so that fountain is a person but if you notice they say it that day they shall be a fountain open you need to understand that the fountain will be open if you go back to the book of Revelation chapter 4 when John was in the book of Revelation chapter 4 John say that John was lift up into heaven he was caught up into heaven there was a voice that told John come up here and when John rose up and went to heaven he saw a door that was opened it was a door but that door was open and brother Branham came and explained to us that that door was not a literal doll he was Christ because Christ was the door to the ship food and the door open Christ opened it is speaking about an opening of Christ a revelation of Christ and unfolding of Christ so to Zechariah chapter 13 the Bible said the woman and a phantom is a person but a fountain will be opened in other words there will be an opening of Christ there will be an opening a revelation of Christ they will be unfolding of Christ to the Jewish people in that day they shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and the inhabitant of Jerusalem in Chapter 12 he says the spirit of grace will come upon the house of David and the inhabitant Jerusalem this is now not just the Holy Spirit coming down on the Jewish people but the Jewish people also will have an opening of the word and that opening we spoke about the seventh trumpet which is the seventh seal to the bridle so if you do not listen to the message this church you need to pray constantly you need to read your Bible constantly and you need to listen to the message constantly if not you're going to be lost because this is your message in that day there shall be a fountain open to the house of David and to the inhabitant of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness so that word that's going to be open will be a word that's going to take sin away and it's gonna take uncleanness away because according to the teaching of the 70 weeks of Daniel and trying to refrain myself from getting into it there is six purpose that Gabriel came into Daniel he wants to remove that ungodliness that seen that transgression away from Israel by the removing of that you need a certain water you need a certain word you need an opening of a certain word a fountain to clean up the mess because in the book of Ephesians chapter five Paul say the washing but off by the water of the word so that fountain is Christ in opening of the world to wash away or to take away the sin of Israel everybody clear so far verse six if we can drop there and one shall say to him one somebody will ask him what are these wounds in your hand they didn't say what are these wounds because Jesus have many wounds right we know that he had how many strap in the back now you are in the university thirty-nine strap in the back but this is not just the wound because the wound might be here or the wound might be in hell or the wound might be in the feet but this is speaking about the wound in your hand so that is now referring to the strap because the strap he received them before the cross either this is again something related to the cross in the in chapter 12 they say where did they pierce you the piercing cross where did you have the wound the wound in your hand cross everybody clear so we are separating the cross from testimony and they shall say to him what are these wounds in your hand then he shall answer those with which I was wounded in the house of my friend which are what the Jews he called Judah friend right now let's go again to Zechariah chapter 14 still the first one if you do you can say Amen behold the day of the Lord comes and you'll spoil shall be divided in the midst of you for I will gather all nations against who Jerusalem okay tomorrow and the city shall be taken and the houses rifled and the women ravished what a day and half of the city shall go into captivity and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city there is a residue then shall the law go forth and fight against those nation so God will appear and fight against those nation this is not the Second Coming okay he's going to the Jews as when he fought in the day of battle and he is what you need wake up and his feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of if you remember we spoke that in Revelation 10 there was a mighty angel that came down put one foot on earth and one on the sea and we gave you two coats where brother Branham said that Jesus when he counts we're going to meet him in D he's not gonna put his foot under on the ground are you there but in this coming Jesus is gonna put his foot under this is not the second coming this is it is clear in the scripture and his feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives which is before Jerusalem on the east and the Mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west and there shall be a very great valley and half of the mountain shall be we move toward the month toward the north and half of it toward the south and you shall flee to the valley of the mountains for the valley of the mountain shall reach to a so yay you shall flee like as you fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of judah and the lord my god shall what shall come and all everybody clear he's coming with her in revelation 19 we see him on a white horse coming with the everybody clear but when he's coming his feet are gonna touch the earth but on the second coming we're gonna meet him yeah everybody clear and the Lord my God shall come and all dissent will you let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy because it's amazing grace who's even giving us opportunity to have the doors of the church open where we can have services Lord virtually and even rahi alone father we cannot take this for granted Lord because we know that days are coming Lord when this will not be available but Lord as you still opening that door and giving us grace Lord father we want to take opportunity to come Lord and to enter and to meet with you and to commune with you Lord father upon that word Lord may the Holy Spirit father maybe they inside the teacher come down this morning Lord may you teach your word to your children Lord may you heal the brokenhearted Lord may you search those that are lost Lord may you remove every single thing blindness upon the eyes of the people own may father you comfort and you nourish those that are already standing Lord may you take this for this service Lord father from it's beginning all the way to the end Lord unto their hand Lord we move everything that is contrary to your word Lord speak to us motherly in the name of Jesus Christ we am blessed amen God richly bless you we were last part on part six this is now part seven if you have noticed our subject is Malachi 4 we took part 1 or 2 part 3 part 4 for a or B 5 part 6 this is part 7 we have not touched Malachi 4 yet we like we are cleaning up whatever it is around it then when we land on type 4 we won't have any confusion you will know what is the first coming what is the third coming what is the second coming and you can position everything together and see it clearly we know that there are seven seals that are written in the world you need to stay very close with me because this is deep water upon these seven seals together when they broke we know that the first four zero spoke about the Ministry of the Anti Christ in the church the first one when he broke he was a white horse rather when we look in the zodiac we saw the Sagittarius the seventh the second seal when he broke it was the red all sudden he was not a difference a different horse rather he was the same rather he was just changing the horses so when he got there the Scorpio in a zodiac open up and told us this is him coming up then he changed into the third seal which is the black horse order and on the black holes we see him coming with a scale which the zodiac was Libra then the last one was the bellows which was the carriage which we prove to you that he was the cancellation now after that cells we found that there is another seal which is called the fifth seal when the fifth seal open up that seal have souls under the altar it is important for you to understand what I'm saying now because if we happen to begin to preach the seals one by one it's going to be easy for you so when the fifth seal open up we found out that there is an altar I was preaching on the three the mystery of the true heaven we saw the first we need to get into the second and in the third then you're going to see where that all tourism but beneath the altar or under the altar there is a dimension over there that is called the sixth dimension and that dimension is that I mentioned the whole the souls of the people that died after covering not before covering after covering the people that died before cover we went into paradise but when Jesus Christ came when he paid the price he emptied paradise now if a sense died you not going down in paradise you are going up but you are not going where God is either you are going into a region under the altar that is called the sixth dimension that's the reason why when brother Branham went today he asked where is Jesus and they told him that he is a little bit higher he was not there and what one of explained that the sixth dimension have region so when you die when brother Branham went there he never saw Paul he didn't see Irenaeus he didn't saluted brother Branham saw the people that died in his age the people that he preached to so brother Branham explained to us that that sixth dimension has regions clearer they are separated either so under that dimension this is where the souls are under the altar but the souls that are under the fifth seal are not the source of the questions I'm going slowly when Jesus Christ came Jesus came to the Jewish people when he came to the Jewish people as they are prophesized that Israel will be blinded completely so dead not to reject Jesus Christ willing fully they were blinded by God it is God who branded them so that he can be rejected from the Jewish people are we clear but it was not everybody that was branded some people recognized Jesus Christ and they enter among the elect of the ridge some people work on us Jesus Christ but they rejected him as a messiah that was the Pharisee that was the solution they knew exactly who Jesus Christ was when Nicodemus came by not he said master we know not I know we know our clique our group brother branham said that group was the Sanhedrin they know clearly that no one can do what you do except that you come from God but even though they knew that they rejected him either but there were a group that was just branded so those that knew the Messiah went to the group dance blundered and influenced them to reject Jesus Christ so when Pilate came in he said I have Barabbas a criminal here and I have Jesus Christ who do you want me to release they say release the criminal then he said what about Jesus he said crucify him despite what palette video they said let his blood come upon us and our children when they did that they opened a seal that is called the six-year are you there ok the six here is approaching fear essential it's a until they're six healed it's a sale of judgment that 6-cell it is a painful film it is a seal of suffering it is a sill of fire are you there when they're refused and they rejected Jesus Christ the sick seal does not have time are we there the first seal first surcharges second Church ages torture changes I explain this the second seal Italian Church ages where they were killing the Christian filling them to lie on and all kind of stuff the first year to the other world the transyl Luther Wesley and he enter up with the overlapping into the Pentecostal then the last seal which is the ego seal which is the Eagle age that is our serum but the six year does not have a specific time I'm gonna go slowly thus itself is finished in the Tribulation Period I'm going slowly but it's a self they open up and when we open up a bring judgment upon those that reject the word brother branham say when a seal broke it under open the messenger came and he catches the inspiration from the Thunder which is the voice of God then the messenger was son the trumpet when the trumpet is sundered they elect for da judge will catch the revelation and they will be gathered together to God but once they elect are gathered those they were ejected them the six come open eval and poor judgment upon you are we clear now when the Jews rejected Jesus cross them tightly scammer because Jesus told them when you see Jerusalem besiege whoever is in the mountain don't come down and woe to the woman that are going to have baby because it's gonna be hard for you to run and pray that it doesn't happen in winter because the winter there is snow on the mountain so when Titus came in that was the opening of the sixth seal and then that'll kill the Jewish people until blood of the Jewish were flowing like a river Jesus pray for them at the cross he said Father forgive them because they don't know the Pharisee knew what they were doing are you there but those that were crying did not know and because God blinded them God is under obligation to serve them and tattoos came after death resurrection of Jesus trust that's when Titus came are you there so after the cross when those people died Israel was scattered all over the world then God took those Souls and place them under the facility that's why when they are there they are crying for ventures they say when are you gonna revenge us brother branham said a bride does not cry for vengeance that is not bride material brought when they were killing Stephen he repeated what Jesus Christ said he said forgive them because they don't know are you there but those who are killed Brandon so according to the law eye for eye tooth for tooth that's why whenever was killed what was the blood of Abel crying for revenge that one came he said the blood of Jesus Christ speak fakes other than the blood of Lu because a girl is crying for just are we clear so far you understand that clear so far then when Israel was scattered toward the earth God one in Israel to come back again to the promised land but when the Jewish went in German in Europe in in America the Jews began to prosper under the blessing of Abraham so the robber came they told them hey you guys need to go back to the promised land they refused are there then Jesus prophesied they prophesied in the Old Testament they say I'm gonna send you first fisherman if you need a scripture you see me if you don't listen to the fishermen I'm gonna send you hunters are there when they robot talk to them to go back they refused God turn around and send hunters and open again the six year that's why brother branham say every trumpet sounded under there six years now if you look at the feast of the trumpet I know it's troubling ordinal if you look under the feast of the trumpet in Leviticus 23 that feast sounded at the beginning of the seventh month are you there when the Jewish were scattered he was the first Church ages the second Church ages nothing was done in Israel was completely disappear as a nation the torture changes Israel doesn't exist the fourth one does not exist the fifth one does not exist the sixth one does not exist their servant church ages when we start in 1906 few years later on for some reason if you study it looks almost like it's stupid for the word the first world war broke they kill someone this nation Ganon and Francis said because this getting are getting Germany said because France getting are getting England said because France and Germany garden a garden before you know the whole world is it all why is the world modern event are made clear by because at the beginning of the seventh the trumpet must blow in order to bring Israel back again to the promised land but Israel was under occupation so when those trumpet begin to blow the first liberated the land of Jerusalem from the hand of the Arab but the Jewish were still al-assad God say there is no problem they open again the 6-year idea then it lurk him Mussolini him Eichmann came and the rose with a hatred against the Jews that comes from Hell they begin to kill the Jewish people and if you study the sixth Robert you will find out that they were demon that came out from the river Euphrates and those demons were killing by three things in the Bible do you wanna feel it oh you good you good you want to read it let's go to the book of Revelation I didn't even plan on this I told you to deep water the book of Revelation sorry let me get my scripture quickly where the trumpet are sounding [Music] let's go to Revelation chapter 9 if you dare you can say Amen I'm trying to find the sixth trumpet now okay yes 13 and the sixth angel sounded and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar you see her altar okay which is before God saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet loose lose the word remember those angels four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates they are four angels remember those four angels don't forget them and the four injure were loosed which were prepared for an hour and a day and a mountain a year for to slay the third part of what men and the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand in other words two hundred million two hundred thousand and I heard the number of them and thus I saw the horse in the vision and them that sat on them having breast fed of fire and of jacinth and brimstone and the heads of the horse were as the head of lions and out of their mouths issued and what and what brother Robert I hope you day fire smoke and what okay let's go to verse 19 for their power is in their mouth and in their tail but when I'm explained that these are not natural horses they were women it's in the fist of the trumpet but when I'm said they were a demon are you dead and these three and by these three is it okay verse 18 by these three was the third part of men killed by Haman three by what the fire everybody there on the aboard and by what smoke everybody see the board and by what princedom which is what issue out of them if you look at the brimstone it means suffer check your Bible it is a gas are either and for some reason when Adolf Hitler came when he was killing the Jewish people they found him opening the gas chambers Ida and he began to kill the Jews by gas chamber he was not an accident he was not something that happened just as an imagination he was prophecy moving it was an anointing from hell he's telling them to kill the Jewish by Gaza everybody and they also killed the Jewish by burning them to emotion fire everybody what is even say ok and they also killed the Jewish by what they were shooting the Jewish people and the shoot that should when the shoot were comes out are we clear so when the trumpet sounded this demon came anointed Hitler and it rapidly to shoot they should they should the attire they begin to burn burn burn they get higher they begin to make gas chamber and they kill they kill millions of Jews he was the 6th trumpet that was sounding telling Israel go back go back to the promised land Israel was killed because he was fear [Music] everybody are we there so this song here does not because they rejected Jesus Christ they died because they were what Jewish people so their first died under Titus within the second angle it work that's why brother Branham say both from terrace and both from Ziggler come under the fifth seal under the altar they cannot give them robbed because they didn't have the Holy Ghost either they have to wait until their brother but they be killed but those Bradley that's going to be killed are the hundred and forty-four thousand which going to receive them are we clear in the Old Testament people die Adam died Moses died died died died when classical trance receive the Holy Ghost and Christ brought the resurrection of everybody else we clear then when Paul came down erroneous died Martin de Columba died looted - Wesley de but in this time according to the King chamber they must be open to a message for the way through a channel but would I impede the portion of the region of under the altar but the Jewish soul that were killed by terrorists are still there because we don't have a connection with them because they were still under the law of Moses and also the Jewish that were true that were killed under Italy were still under the altar so they needed a message that's going to bring the baptism of Holy Ghost and the opening of the some time to bring the resurrection are we there then the resurrection will pull the Jews from goddess the Jews from Hitler and take them all also - everybody got that clear now when he opened the sixth we know that the city is a judgment field but the seventh year when we open there is nothing everybody clear now all these things have three purpose the first seal was the white horse rather which was the Antichrist everybody there the Antichrist was a demonic spirit everybody clear he was a white horse rather the second fear was the art across that got into the politics church said mixed together you need to read your message political power everybody then the Antichrist change to the black horse which he get into religion demonic power political power religious power three of them here then the fourth see when he open it was the parish rather and the pair brother branham say if you take the color white you mix it with red you mix it with what black he gives you what to repurpose to economics right here and draw the bottom say the parallels rather who is today is worth working in politics in religion and demonic power earlier and we just found out that under the fifth still there is also three color people those that were killed by others everybody clear those that were killed by Italy Mussolini and others under the Second World War are you there and the third one would be does that's going to be killed under Moses and Elijah which is the hundred and forty-four and when we were in Living Word Tabernacle we found out that the Seventh Seal has how many purpose three of them the seven thunders if you need caught you see me the third pool if you need coal to see me and they're coming off the Lord this is what brother bottom keep saying the Seventh Seal is not open because it's not coming off the road it will break the scripture are we there but if this is three destroy destroy destroy this also must be where do you get this stuff brother Stephen the Seventh Seal now I want you to notice tonight that in the seat sir there was worth everybody clear to be for purpose of the six here there was a three-fold purpose of them I just show it to you we clear there is been three for purpose in word three three three three we're trying to see three everybody there that bring us back to a three and a seven again seventh year seven thousand so forth now in threes and seven seven zero three purpose three purpose three purple increase and seventh is God's numbered in his love Mladic's of a villain 7:03 purpose 3 purpose 3 purpose 3 purpose repurposed revelation everybody there okay now you notice they rather not there was that three horse went out one of them was white one was red one was black and then in the fourth Y all them were preferred we see the six owner brother branham the Seventh Seal that's the six healed now being open he was out for a three-fold purpose now here was the purposes brother branham himself is going to say paragraph 388 the first thing was that the sleeping foolish virgin the foolish virgin had to go to the for what the Jewish who rejected Jesus Christ will open up the sixth seal open tribulation the gentle foolish virgin they will stand virgin some who have oil which is the blood we have the Holy Spirit and some who have all because those don't have all rejected what happened but if they kill them they must be safe because it's a purging self-id tribulation period for what she had to be purged of her sins of ambulance and rejecting them no problem but it's the church the pure people that didn't have the opportunity so it's a deadly thing when you open your eyes to the message and you rejected it's better for you to be branded I didn't because per say once you are enlightened and you ejected there is no more sacrifice for that word but the Pharisee to hell so if you are in the message get serious either you cannot be in the message and rejected but it's the church the pure people that didn't have the opportunity maybe to receive them or some way that they were by these false Matthew 24:24 and they didn't get here they were blended under the denomination are you there God put them on the world because their pastor said brother Branham is a false prophet but the leader the Pharisee the scrub W that brother Branham was a true prophet and rejected them no more they didn't get a chance and yet they are really sincere in the heart and God knows their if I knew I would not reject it I did it because the Pharisee told us anybody that will go there we gonna chase him away from the synagogue and then when they ask the parent how was your son he'll we don't know ask him the Bible said they didn't wanna answer because they were afraid of death are we there you see the power the second another purging time that is for when she gathered that's the Sun God purge Israel in the tribulation the 144,000 out of the million that's a gather day there shall be a selected 144,000 that will be the third one there is a whole office to be there will be such a thing that the moon star all nature will be you see what it is the earth is renewing of birth pain being purged getting ready killing coronavirus killing and killing everything us every diseases killed charge for the Millennium the Millennium is coming up three three three foolish virgin 144,000 and purging what three purpose purpose three purpose three purpose three purpose everybody clear okay now when you look at those two issues when the second seal happened it was what solace this is what I'm going to get so we can go back to a Malachi phone everybody all right you notice which seal is he preaching the servants here let me help you up which seal is he preaching okay now it's clear you don't need glasses like me notice now for the end of time water this word with you so the 7-series water is the difficult is it complicated except until the seventh seal that seven until we do it but know what the seven shillings for this endtime seal which is what what is the seventh seal the anthem message he has three fold purpose it's going to release the tanda it's going to put the third Pole and it will bring the coming of there is it complicated my friend poop it for 20 years we can explain the 17 you ask a child what is the seven silly the message he don't know in the message the 17 here with you are six years but don't say nothing about there we try to find out its cause and the anthem what is the intention when so we have to finish someone when we start will be absolutely the total secret according to the before knowing that than what before knowing the severe weather later if you want to know the servants fear remember revelation is the complicated before you know the seventh seal we fell remember revelation 10 want to at the end of the seventh angel message order of God will be we are in the day opening of the servant if you wanna know the seven zero remember addressing there will be a messenger work on the messenger [Music] question and answer on the word now we come back with the seals and open the seal God open the field did brother branham fabricated God opened that seal for us what is that first remember before you know it first the reason he repeated back again there is a messenger Church ages next is what so the messenger must come before the seventh year of foam now we found out the column the corruption they hit their seventh church ages but the seventh seal does not reveal what is going to happen to it because why the seventh seal does not reveal anything before you know it you need a messenger why it doesn't reveal that brother branham because at the end of the church age we change is come here to reveal is it complicated my friend firstly thanks the book of this year and break them and sure there is it complicated is he contradicting himself for this not to people this alone the mystery of God is the Ministry of the servants what is the Ministry of brotherbrother revealing the seventh seal which is the message of the end time now we just come through their church ages with history improved on the angels message of the servant church all right we fear all the mysteries that has been in the past all this fits in there so my point I'm trying to drive here it is the opening of the seventh year require a profit everybody's clear now right Fasil Antichrist second ant across third ant across fourth Antiqua fifth we just talked about your souls under the author but that's it the second one you need now if this still need the profit what about the six selves I'm going to get to Malachi for are you there the six here what is it what can bring these things but the word they can do nature any way they want to we know those people right Moses and Elijah we're going to get today here it is they are the one who bring on this day our cover and what because Zachariah said there will be a fountain water there will be a seal for the church ages that will be water but you know the opening of the Seventh Seal Unida in Israel there will be a sultan but that fountain will be opened by who they are covered and open it up it's the power of who opened the Seventh Seal to interrupt word six here the sixth cell is completely a natural son of nature do you get it now there is yourself who does it it's the other side of the in other word not as the Jewish people with the power of God the Word of God they just condemn nature they can send earthquake turn the moon into blood the Sun can go down or anything and their command now here is these two prophets standing here with the Word of God to do anything to nature they want to and they shake the earth and it shows exactly who does it it who Moses and Elijah because there is their ministry we in person we impersonated again it's Byfuglien see what is the six series it is does don't let me chop you but what will happen that seal what is telling you look at me the seventh seal was opened by who look at the other one who open it again because the sex the because the seventh seal to the Jewish people is water the seventh trumpet if the servants who was opened by a prophet who is going to open the seventh trumpet it's gonna be wool but those prophet Moses M praise God we are living in the early age brother heads up to among the crowd they opened the sixth seal they have power to do it amen there is your sixth coming open very badly under in the Old Testament but in what we're going to get there but in the old brother branham is saying that Ezekiel is talking about who where does is it you're talking about Moses and Elijah brother branham lied let's get today the six he'll open and they say well that's a mysterious thing what did it here is the secret of it's worth when the seventh seal open he was a total secret why because you need the secret of the six series profit profit because the Bible says so they can open it up anytime they can do to nature all that they want I'm going to repeat this code then we get in their gospel is ready to go back to the Jews oh if I could just tell you something that is about to happen right in this hour day this red thing that is about to happen will carry over the seventh seal will carry over to revelation 11 and pick up those the seventh trumpet these two prophet Moses and Elijah turning the gospel back to the earth are we clear now okay now let's get to our stuff we found out that we are Testament started with Moses you already got it then at the end we know that Moses prophesy about Jesus Christ and then he prophesied about Israel drifting from the faith then we saw Elijah here as our reference if you wanna know Elijah this is a reference are you there then we talked about Paul last Sunday and Paul was our Morgan Moses you remember that and but at the end of Paul Paul also prophesy about the coming of Jesus Christ and Paul also prophesy about what I'm going quickly Paul prophesy about the coming of Jesus Christ and power also professor about the church who's going to depart from their faith he called her hell there Moses called their elders now before we get to Malachi for I was going through the seal because you need the seal to unlock this one over there now we found in the Bible in Luke chapter 9 Moses and Elijah appeared talking to Jesus Christ at their coronation their crowning the adoption of Jesus Christ no he was present from heaven except Moses and who what were they talking about who is Jesus Luke chapter 9 verse 30 let's go now now I'm going to solve like an ego if you have a problem understanding the Jewish based foundation you go home go read Romans chapter 11 if I touch that here I won't be able to even touch something here Romans chapter 11 I wish I could have a Sunday School then I can fill it up you there okay Luke chapter 9 verse 30 let's go to verse 22 the Son of Man must water must what which seal speaks about the suffering everybody clear what is Stephen we're talking about Malachi 4 why did you preach this you now you begin to understand now you begin to understand the sort of man must what many things and be what rejected off the word was he stopped - who Paul talk to who everybody clear the elder and the chief priest endure these are the one that did iniquity they knew but they rejected are you there and be what and be worse debtor day and he said to them if any man will come to me let him deny himself and take up what first of all let me ask you a question was Jesus dead did Jesus go at the cross how is he talking about the cross have you thought about it he was not crucified why he's telling us if anybody want to follow him you must carry you he himself has not carried and the opening of the seventh year the barber became a if you have difficulty in the Bible just get the seals and put it in you will see how the seals open the Bible it's the last tool you can use this this this when you hit you can't open you heat you can help it you know the mechanic had they go luck and then they change it that's the seal once you hit the sphere he opened the Bible in a different way are you there okay now if any man Jean I let him deny himself and take up his and follow me verse 30 now and we all dare talk with him to what they didn't say spirit okay two men we know what happened to Elijah we know what happened to Moses we already talked about Moneyball two men which were who Moses and Elijah who appear in glory and spoke of his word death Moses Elijah they are crying somebody they're doing a celebration for someone everybody's happy he graduated for the son of man he is recognized his adoption they come and prick the Bob bust the Bible they coming with death everybody's happy you coming with death let's go and then of his disease what kinda disease this is which he should accomplish at work on the death Jesus had to accomplish it Jerusalem are we clear when the jewels see him they're gonna see who they have yes you remember our reading what Jesus spoke about the cross Moses and Elijah came and talked to him about the cross everybody there so why are these guys talking about the cross why are they talking about the cross let's go to Matthew chapter 20 at this point you're gonna need your Bible Matthew chapter 20 verse 18 if you dare you can say Amen the cross was not a good thing he was a painful thing he was a humiliating thing Jesus humbled himself even to the death of there are you gay when he looked at the joy that was behind Hebrew he and/or the cross it's written in the Bible either the cross was not easy are either mark chapter 20 verse 18 the Bible said that we all do who's talking Jesus we go up to Jerusalem and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scrub and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the gentle to mock and to scourge and to crucify cross cross cross crucify him and the third day he shall rise again everybody there so far verse 20 then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons worship Him and desired certain things of him and he said to her what will you she said to him grant that this mateus on may sit they want on my on your right hand and the other on your left in your kingdom watch now but jesus answered and saying you know not what you asked are you able to drink after that I shall drink future disclose Jesus called that the cup because in Gethsemane when they give him the full vision Jesus say father if it's possible take away what and that's the subject Moses and Elijah brought to him are you there and are you able to drink the cup that are doing and to be what with the Baptist's Miami if you notice the baptism he say I am look at your Bible shall he was in the future but the baptism he said the baptism that I am he was already baptized with the Holy Spirit in the river of Jordan but he was not dead yet that's what he said listen man you are asking me for something are you ready to drink the cup that I shall drink and the baptismal are I am there is a cup and there is also a baptism the Baptist means the word in the river of Jordan everybody there what are we talking about here he said can you drink the cup that I drink can you be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with the same water everybody clear the same Holy Spirit was upon him without okay Jesus asked a question take verse 23 so you can understand this better and he says and they say to him we are able right that's the answer when they say are you ready to do this they say we are able that was verse 22 verse 23 and he says to them who saying now Jesus is confirming them you shall drink indeed of Maca so anybody can drink of this camera and be baptized with the baptism I am I am baptized with everybody but to sit on my right hand and on my left it is not mine to give but it shall be given to them to whom evil spirit Uma as far as position that we destination but as far as suffering and the baptism everybody can take it over there okay but one cross he himself took the baptism his baptism was without measure everybody did he said we can do we can take the cup and we can also take the baptism either so if in your life you are going to suffering either you need to remind Jesus and tell him if you can fulfill the suffering in my life you must fulfill the Holy Ghost in my life I cannot suffer and you don't give me the Holy Ghost either because you say if we partake of this we can also take this one young people you need to know how to touch God are you there and get him at his word brother branham can you drink he said the same Holy Spirit was upon him without come upon his church by with us by measure with him without measure come upon his church by measure but it's the same the same God God gave him the spirit with God in other word the fullness of the baptism of the holy spirit was in Christ you got me the fullness of your suffering goes to crush them you with me the fullness either but one class deal with you he gives you the spirit in measure God gave him the spirit without measure he gives it to you and I brother branham by what this is not the Messiah son this is the Holy Ghost in brother Branham on life okay he mention me out a spoonful but when he measured his son he measured the whole ocean see what I mean the same chemical that is in this spoon is in the ocean and all the chemical in the ocean is a measure of them in this spoon it's the same kind I shall do the same thing the same word is a produce the same that do you really don't you believe that that's what make us crystal their work the work that I do yuusha if he give us the spirit in measure he gets the spirit without measure he get the suffering with a measure is he going to give us the full suffering he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he's sovereign but it's all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he will be the author of frustration and not of peace his purpose is that after we suffer your sick self while we will be made perfect be established strengthen and shadow you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by defense that he suffered that was Jesus Christ he was actually made profit by the things that he in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by by suffering and according to Paul he left his church ere a measure of what that day to buy their faith in God was suffering for him will come in the place off so even God Jesus Christ says that you will drink of his cup you now gonna go in the fullness of suffering God will give you all me nature according to your strengths because Paul say you cannot be tempted above what you can bear both your measure he is a father he knows that this one needs level 3 this one needs never fall this one need level sees he will give you a cording to your measure but it will be gasps you are ready the suffering if you already suffer in your life it is time spoken with Abednego for you to turn around you say there is a duel there is a 2-fold to this you told me if I suffer you also going to give me the Holy Ghost you made me suffer now it's time for the Holy Ghost everybody what a Branham what is this kappa what a john this is a different gear alrighty one time a young woman came up to Jesus and say Lord let one of my sons set one on the side and they had on the right hand and the one on the left hand when you come into your kingdom why he said can you drink the does a drink cup lynch word trans a Christian be the drug death can you drink the cup that I drink that is bitter persecution that's why we go to persecution sometime are you there but we not going to get the fullness either now he say so he sure is sure that we could drink the same cup of what be called be eligible and whatever it might be and still be baptized with the same spirit he is baptized with so if he was called Messiah because he was anointed with the holy and any church that is anointed with the same spirit is what it's a lesser leader smaller God that what Jesus said the natural world of your Lord called those who to the Word of God can God tell the devil I'm God and someday when this body is resurrected I hope beforehand that God can get a hold of a bunch of people that shall manifest his in the Sun every dimension that is suppose oh my god take Luke chapter 12 we are navigating Luke chapter 12 verse 50 are you there everybody there we talking about this cup and this cross okay verse 50 but I who's talking Jesus but I have to be I thought Jesus was already baptized in Jordan he told us the Baptist letter who that I am baptized but now he's talking a different what is this baptism I have a baptism to be the future okay to be baptized with and how I am I am joyful is that what he say brother Robert how I am distressed till it be what so this cup Jesus called that also a baptism are you there but this is a baptism of suffering are you and because jesus knew he had to suffer he was always under tension I just read the scripture I am distressed because I know something is coming when the hour came and the father told him this system he said father is there any possibility you can Jesus understand our suffering we are mean to people but he understood Jesus even pray to do it you know a Dutchman they should something so when God should the vision he almost did he understand the high priest that can be by the feeling of your he knows your suffering he himself was about to Jesus even tried to dodge what here the cup the baptism the cross is it easy is it possible that the cup the cup should pass nevertheless not life but then Moses and Elijah came to talk to him about but but who opened the sixth seal who opened the six year Moses Anna and the sixth is a painful sir it is a sill of tribulation it is a sill of suffering it is a cell of persecution why did analyzer meeting to talk to him about what Branham helped me the six till now when he was about to deliver his only begotten Son Jesus which was his only begotten Jacob is his son but this is his only begotten son Matthew 27 now remember his son that had been been right and had been sick sealed are we there and there had made fun of him we saw that the cup right and he was now what Moses and Elijah was talking to him about what the cross hanging on the cross at three o'clock on Good Friday just about to take place Matthew 27 now brother Branham is explaining there six hours they was worth all over there at the cross brother Branham jobless a notice just exactly what he did back here in other word you're sick Silla in its fullness he Jesus cross EDA at the cross watch it that's why you don't go to the Tribulation Period that's why you don't go to hell that way you cannot be he that believes on me have already passed from death unto judgment on to do you think because the six your judgment hit Jesus Christ at the cross so when Moses and Elijah came they are followed unto Him the sixth seal you cannot go through this body because they are children they need to skip the Tribulation Period hallelujah notice I beheld when he opened their Branagh means putting the cross and ER and the 16th when he opened the six-year low there was a great world when Jesus Christ was that the course they also what we clear Samantha and then the son become as what when Jesus was dying what was that the UCD of six year and in that six L his poem principality his Paul power he took the law and the Prophet and fulfilled the matter Moses and Elijah the law and the Prophet and fulfilled both of them where are we there and the moon became as black nurse darkness Egypt Moses blackness darkness the Cross God delivering at the cross just before he brought him up from first darkness Sun went down in the middle of the day and the star would not Moses and Elijah bidding Jesus to talk about what the six year the six year the six year you apply you need the Prophet my friend to listen to to lead this bubble you need the Prophet you are applying that to the coming of Christ that's right he was applied there the order of the coming of cross and they look at the sin Jesus glorified they look again and sin Moses and Elijah the to witness of Revelation then they look back and they see Jesus exactly the order of the coming glorified Jesus and preaching to them and Jesus coming with his okay so the dispensation of grace to the Jewish people the Holy Spirit living the jente going to the Jewish people brought to Moses and who Moses and who Moses I keep my mouth shut down we will get today I don't want to say you're gonna say by the Stephen third you know I want you to see that and MOSI said who in man that regeneration Moses you know what prove you each Moses and Elijah that's right brother who say where is it in the Bible I want to see it in the Bible this is your prophet show me in the Bible okay when you think it's Enoch you say Moses it's already there but remember he could come back to life again he did a hundred years he had later seven hundred years said he appeared on mantra figuration and after a managed on them yes Lazarus was dead raised again and then he died again and even the wicked will be raised up to life again after they had one thousand year and have to die the second death is that right so get that out of your mind he's saying get that it's not you know because the denominational teach that it's Enoch okay watch it will Moses how do you know it's Moses you know a tree by it watch your ministry just exactly what Moses and Elijah okay I want to see that in there take a revelation 11 you need to leave today and be able to sit with someone with the Bible and prove to him that the reason why I believe that revelation 11 is Moses and Elijah is this everybody okay let go verse 3 revelation 11 once we cross this then I go to the airport are you there we clear I know it's deep water verse 3 and I will give power to my two witness give me time to erase this hour to witness our specialize in the sixth seal are we there two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days that means 1260 days everybody the mouth in the Bible are thirty days okay he was in the time of Noah when the flood came then the earth moved from its orbit that's why when you look at the picture of the earth you will see the earth is always tilted look google it you'll see tilted and when he tilted he changed them up and the season that's what you have February sometime 28 sometime we have 29 and some math have 30 some math have 31 some years have 360 something 365 366 but after in the millennium brother branham say God will reposition everything everything was 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 but it look even in the South Allah for women you will see hard woman death with nature and with the zodiac everybody clear if you take 360 you divide that by 30 it's going to give you you do your math three and a half year okay these are the word verse for the word two olive trees so these not only are there to witness they are two olive trees only to speak about Israel to olive trees and toward to candlestick we know that we have seven candlestick that's the seven churches but these are two candlestick are you there standing before the god of the earth if you have a pen please keep their pain on the revelation 11 let's go where the Bible says that olive tree it's written way way ah check Zachariah chapter 4 do you remember brother Branham say those two prophet who are weeping in Zechariah do you remember me telling you that exactly ayah for because people say Oh Malachi for applied to the Jews Malachi for applied to the Jews that's why I'm cleaning this up the Elijah that goes to the Jews his reference is in Zechariah not Malachi okay when they tell you Malachi 4 applied to the Jews no no the Elijah that goes to Israel his reference is in zechariah zechariah chapter 4 everybody did are they saying Amen brother David okay first one everybody there the end and the angel that talked to me come again and wake me a part of wake me up as a man that is awakened out of stupid sleep and said to me what do you see what you see and I said I have looked and behold a candle stick all of gold with a ball up on the top of it and seed seven lamps thereon and seven perhaps and to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof verse 3 they what do you see that rather random say remember those who are in the book of Zechariah did brother Branham explain that did he lied you see a to olive tree we we are coming from revelation 11 we're in Zechariah 2 olive tree by it one upon the right side of the bow and the area upon the left side of the ball now that's number one let's drop to verse 11 you already seen your two olive tree everybody then I answer and say to him what are these two or live I love the bubble environment they always interpret itself less trouble what are these two olive tree upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof and I answer it again and say to him what are these two olive water here they called them on the tree and they called them also olive what to witness to olive tree to olive branches to candlestick okay we tried to see them and I answer which through the two golden pipes empty the golden always out of themselves verse 13 and he answered me and say no you not what these be I say no my lord then say he these are the two what everybody clear now they are two what anointed ones anointed one that stand by the Lord of the whole so when God is in heaven there is two candlestick in there there are seven but they are also two that stand beside something just dropped right now yes

to load that again everybody there they are the tournant and that's turned by the world of thee he was talking about those two position are you there let's go back now to revelation 11 everybody seen where those truly come from so when we say Malachi 4 is for the Jews no the Jewish Malachi for the Jewish Elijah his reference is on Zachariah not Malacca I have not touched Malachi when I want to touch Malachi 4 it's a home run are you there now let's go to revelation 11 okay now we were on verse 4 these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth and if any man will hurt them what happened fire proceed out of the mouth and devour the enemy if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed so if you come you want to hurt them what will happen fire fire we try to find who they say to witness do we know the name we don't know we know and a revelation but up here we don't know we presume - olive trees do we know them now I'm going with you - to be on the front line when someone is attacking you this is where you standing now two olive trees because if you tell them brother branham say they said no we want to see it in the Bible so now I'm giving you the machine gun for the flying are you there to witness do you know the name two olives do we name two branches do we know their name no two candlestick did he say their name to Anointed One do we know their name by twenty platinum gave us a key he said watch their ministry the first one when they say fire come out of their mouth who in the Bible when he spoke fire came down don't answer me let the bubble answer itself brother branham say does that Cariah for revelation 11 why did mother Brandon put those two Scripture together speak the Sam Bing where did brother branham Linda was in manufacturing revelation yeah Zachariah for that's the two olive tree yeah the two olive tree of Revelation do you see how brother branham is line up with the Bible do you see oh yeah that's the same thing that is them both more the same the two are live why do you say that brother branham the people today want to see that in the Bible we talking about fire right take 2nd Kings chapter 1 keep revelation 11 I'm almost going to thank you I'm almost we once we get through this then we lending great second thing we almost did I'm gonna run this quickly but I don't want to tell you and you're gonna go home and say what is Stephen told us know everybody there 2nd Kings chapter 1 let me see yes today second Kings chapter 1 verse 8 are you there well David are they there okay verse 8 and they answer him he was there they were talking about who Elisha if you have a problem let me find the scripture okay let's go to verse 3 because I don't want to say but a Steve and say Elijah I want you to read it yourself verse 3 but the angel of the Lord say to who arrived at the what so everybody say meet Elisha right now let's job 2 verse 8 and they answer him he was a hairy man and good with a good enough letter about his loads and he said it who they are teach Bible then they came sent to him a captain of fifty with his with his fifty and he went to him and be learned he sat on top of the hill and spoke to him you men of God the King say come down and Elisha answer and say they said to the captain of fifty if I be a man of God let what who brought fire damn wanna go slowly you must be able to sit and defend yourself sire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty and there came fire from heaven and consume him and his 50 verse 11 and again also he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty and he answered and said to him o man of God thou has the King say come down quickly and who verse turf Elisha answered and said to them if a be a man of God let what fire come down from heaven and do what consume you and your fifty and their fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and he's number one who spoke and the fire came down we're trying to find out if brother Branham lied I'm sorry if I say that like that take Luke chapter I'm going this way so whenever they show you something even if you don't understand leave it alone just take it believe it and go forward God will give you the revelation later they give you a coat you look at the coat you say Amen the interpretation you can argue with me but the coat they take leave it alone verse nine chapter nine are you there verse 52 everybody there okay verse 52 and send message before his face this is Jesus and they went and enter into the village of Samaritan to make ready for him and they did not receive him Jesus sent messenger to the village of Samaritan to prepare him so he can come when they prepare him the Samaritan said no we don't want Jesus here no go we don't want Jesus here okay that's just a background and they did not receive him because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem and when his disciple who James and John saw this they say Lord will you that we command what please speak with me so the people on the camera will understand you command what fire to come down from and consume them even answer who speak and fire come down oh my god no problem Allah God speak and what and fire come down this is Elijah okay let's go back to revelation 11 again hit revelation 11 we were in verse 5 right I'm sorry I gotta go this way everybody there verse 5 and if any man heard them work fire everybody seen that come down we seen who did fire because God does not is the same to the end so you can trace God you can trace the ministry okay verse 6 these have power to do it that he who stopped the reven and he was trained don't give me the answer stop what rain heck first king chapter 17 deep revelation 11 again this is a vaccine not what fat cheese giving you is trying to find out this is the real one are you there earth firstly chapter 17 once we cross this than we hitting home everybody they first one with a analyzable rules of inhabitant of dealer say to Ahab as the Lord of Israel lives before whom our sin they shall not be a know these three years according to my will stop the heaven from now reigning take look chapter 4 you might have to go sermon and to review it not because it's me who preached it but because of the material we put there for you to be fortified your fortification is behind the world Luke chapter 4 verse 25 if you dare you can say Amen only few people if you dare you can say Amen deliver the devadatta say Amen ok first 25 right and I tell you of truth that's Jesus speaking maybe we don't were in Israel in the days of everybody clear Elijah when their heaven was for what and stop can you raise and look at me here the witness in revelation 11 prophesy for how long did you seat and Jesus say Elijah shut up the heaven fall are we clear ok let's go but maybe we don't were in the days of Elijah when they have been well shut for two years and six months when great famine was to out there who stopped the rain again let's go to James chapter 5 I'm sorry you gotta bear with me these are the stuff that we heard but we never put a sermon together to stabilize someone and when they bring you something brother Branham totala I leave the message to more you in short to paint a to understand James chapter 5 verse 17 are you there are you there who Elijah was a man subject to like passions we are and he pray earnestly that he might not everybody clear rain and he ran not on the earth by the space of work and what do you see this again the prophesy for three years and let's go back now to revelation 11 we were in verse 6 we're trying to find out why he brought a man and say if Elijah I am vs. 3 6 these have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy and he'll power over the warders return them to would run water into blood is he difficult to save time write this down Exodus 7 verse 17 and 20 and go clarify it yourself are you there okay you write down yourself who turned water into blood that's why brother Branham say it is not anak the works here is not the works of Enoch brother Branham said if they give you the spirit of Beethoven you will play music because birth oven was a musician are you there I have power over the world to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with older who are sliding Egypt to spread if you need a scripture Exodus chapter 8 Exodus chapter 9 Exodus chapter 10 you will see 10 plagues for 6 these have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of prophecy and have power over the water to turn it to blood and to smite the earth with all plagues as often there will and when they shall have finished their testimony the Beast Rome shall ascend out of the bottomless pit that's the Pope shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them because under the fifth seal there is souls under there okay do you see why I started with the seals and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom go to Israel and see the level of homosexual in Israel rising up why are they rising up as it was in the days of he starts from us and brother branham came but the sodom days must be also in ease so that do you see do you see God does not change spiritually called Sodom and Egypt and Egypt where also the Lord was cross God was good if I were in everybody clear and there of the people of the kingdom and tongues and nations shall see their dead body three days and a half and shall not permit their dead body to be put to grave and they shall dwell upon the earth and they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry and shall send give one to another because these two can you say it aloud these two who opened the six here who when we speak Falkon down a prophet stopped the rain a prophet turned water into blood prophet bring the plane to Egypt Egypt prophet these two are to witness to all of trees to all our branches to candlestick to anointed one to prophet Moses and mented them that dwell upon the earth let's Roma right now these two are from now on when brother branham say it no more question are exactly Moses and Elijah look at that we just did it ministry now watch these two prophet they have power to smite the earth with blood as often as their will who did it do you see how brother branham is line up we're not following a a crazy message they have power to shut heaven and he went not in the days of ministry who closed the heaven for three days and half the congregation Ezra there they are that's them the man when he dies he does not change his status he does not change his makeup Elijah was a prophet to all nation but Moses was a lawgiver to the Jews only Moses is there now brother Branham is explaining why Moses have to come with Elijah are you there Moses is there the reason he come with Elijah them Jews saying wait we are still keeping the law but he has turned Moses himself when Jesus came they said our Father Moses say our father Moses say Moses say now God said no problem take Moses send him normally I just need Elijah because that's what I sent to the Jetta but because the Jewish has a problem about Moses that Moses being dead that why Jesus say there is one in heaven who testified who accuse you he's not who they to witness that stand beside beside God one of them is accusing the Jewish people hallelujah hallelujah and this was to bring forth the to witness Moses and Elijah which the Jews only believed there and they shall come forth with the son of the Prophet and the work will be done of the Prophet for they did exactly showing that a man when you die or whatever when you leave this world your nature does not change if you are a liar now you be a liar a day that's why you go to hell are you there if you are hot-headed here you'll be hot-headed there if you're a data here you'll be the other day men and women it's time to shake yourself and to examine yourself and see where you are standing for death does not change and here they return with the same nature to do the same death does Nina do nothing to amend by change his dwelling place does not change your nature does not change your v does not change nothing in you but your dwelling place are you there ok let me skip this no let me get this now as soon as this church the brother she's taken up and that Ministry of the seventh year or the seventh seal the mystery of the goal and the Jews is called but the mystery of the seventh we want to finish now let's take Matthew 24 take Matthew 24 and then we head home Matthew 24 verse 29 and 31 this is very important I could have skip it but I cannot the hour is so treacherous I'm sorry you say it he is preaching longer you one day look at this sermon verse 29 matter of fact it has been a long time since you were preach message immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the Sun be darkened we under 6 you and the moon shall not give her light we on the 6th now you get an idea or the six series and the stars shall fall from heaven it's a tribulation and the power of the heavens shall be shaken and they shall appear a son of son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribe of the earth moon the third coming and they shall see the Son of man coming in clouds of heaven with power and great glory watch what he does before that happen and he shall send His if you notice it's plural okay it's not one angel how many two three four don't worry this angel with a great not a son a great sand of her and they shall gathered to him he is what from the four winds brother branham helped me with that Scripture this time between the sixth and the seventh seal he called these people spoken by Matthew 24 verse that's what we saw is the trumpet of death the great trumpet the great seal to the gentle it's the biggest trumpet to the Jewish people the great is the trumpet to the two witness of the edge of what a pollen you seen it's the age of the grace to the Jews because the spirit of grace upon the house of David a warm trumpet sound you notice one trumpet brother branham read the scripture we just read he shall send for his not know this word random not but there is now brother Branham give us the number why did he sell - because revelation 11 say to Zachariah say you see he's not fabricating where did he say - where did he say - tell me that in the Bible see with a great sound of her that's always his voice is calling to bother he speak and the last message they trumpet son that is talking about Moses end and if you notice he say he shall gather his elect for the four wings if you go to Revelation 7 you will find out that there is 144,000 they are gathered from the four winds go check your Bible at home because I'm trying to load to the cool to the airport God is about to deliver his son Israel after the same manner of tribulation that he'd be done there he said who Moses down there to deliver he done this very same thing he sent Elijah seven thousand came out with a hub and he sent him them both of him go do the same job again normally I just need Elijah but the Jewish if you don't show them the law they won't listen take Moses with you Moses have been accusing them go now with the spirit of grace and go poo 144,000 over there then it's going to be good now brother Steven Moses that you're Elijah as a reference Moses modern Moses Elijah Moses Elijah at the end the ministry bring resurrection and the rapture of the Old Testament said when Paul came at the end we found out that there is a resurrection and a rupture of the same and we found that when Moses and Elijah came they killed them and after three days the spirit of grace came down there was what a resurrection let's take this and we close Patti thank you for your patience Matthew chapter 11 and that's it I'm glad because I hid where I want it so next time we drop in Malachi for are you read Matthew chapter 11 verse 10 today for this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before your face which shall prepare your way before verily I say unto you among them that are born of women there has not risen a greater than John the Baptist are you there go down to 13 for all the profit and the law prophesied until who remember we said Jesus when he was talking he started by Moses and all the profit now Jesus is giving us he stopped and the first time they say he started by Moses and all the profit right you remember did he stop in which profit we do but now he is giving us his stop he said we started for Moses and stopped at who John okay so we found a man by the name of John so he started from Moses and he started John this is your last script for all the profit and the law prophesied until because after John who came Jesus and if you will receive it this is who we just capture if you want to receive it verse 14 this is who Elijah we should work for to come so now Jesus who study for Moses is telling us that you start and Moses you stop at who by John Jesus call him who Elijah this Elijah is just our reference so we know what he did and we can trace him Moses Elijah then Jesus come and the resurrection modern Oh Moses do we have an Elijah here before Jesus come and bring the resurrection because over here we know this we have a turn and we also have Jesus coming and we have also a resurrection if God does not change who is right here okay next time that will be part eight god bless you you might be saying let's stand and let's pray I wanted to stop ready so you see how we clear the Jews how we clear the the Jews over there how we stated everything now we're gonna learn to Malachi for let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy for your anointing and your presence even dropping that which we did it have Lord Father may the people realize the anointing that is moving in this hour it is the on going home anointing where you are unfolding your word in such a mighty way because you are preparing a group of people to manifest you in every dimension Lord and then to do such a demonstrating that will go home Lord this world is not our home Lord the condition in this world is not suitable for your children anymore father may you draw us a more more closer unto thee may you assist us and made the Holy Spirit continue to unfold this word in a mighty way Lord for the glory of your own name we commit everything Lord strengthened the people bless us and continue to minister in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you brother John it's not a very comfortable thing and it three minutes to when we pre-arranged the time office they did he says brother Johnny we're in eternity now and I thought oh my he's not going to stop but it's so good and it doesn't seem like we're here very long and the point is we're not we're here just one day for a couple of hours and we received so much God is so good to us in these in this short time he mentioned you know the cup and and the the meeting between Moses and Elijah and Jesus on my Transfiguration and he said you know if if we're gonna suffer even by measure then it's his obligation to give us by measure the baptism of the Holy Ghost so a song came into my head because I'm a song leader that's how I think not like a preacher but I started thinking those are promises and he you know he never he never breaks his promise so let me get a key over here I'm gonna get a key off of the piano it's number 31 in those books if you've got it right there in front of you and the song is standing on the promises we're not gonna sing it real fast and we're not gonna sing it in a hurry but we're not gonna sing at all but I want to give glory to God for standing behind his promises because that's a new one that that we that I heard today it's another revelation that I would see even number 31 standing on the promises of price my king through eternal ages let his praises ring glory in the highest I will shout and sing standing on the promises of God standing standing standing on the promises of God my Savior standing standing I'm standing on the promises of God let's sing the second one standing on the promises that cannot fail win the howling storms of doubt and fear assail by the Living Word of God I shall prevail standing on the promises of God standing stained any standing on the promises of God my Savior standing standing I'm standing on the promises of God a single last verse they're standing on the promises of cannot fail listening moment to the spirits calm resting in my Saviour as my all in all standing on the promises of God standing stage ending standing on the promises of God my Savior standing standing I'm standing on the promises of God at that point when he was preaching to that he looked at the camera and he says children he was speaking to the young people he said that's a promise you know God can't fail when you feel like you're down and out you know our children are the ones as far as as far as this corona goes our children are the one I think that are suffering the most because they need this message really really bad they needed in their lives they need to the order the discipline the revelation of it and they need to see these messages read Elijah would you mind coming up and dismissing us this afternoon sir you can pray dear heavenly Lord we thank you your God for the word that you have spoken to us this morning your God we pray that you may put this word into our heart O God made this word or God be our life Oh God in this endtime Oh God we approaching all self to you may you O God come to us O Lord and lead us in our daily life with committing all serving to you O God and for
