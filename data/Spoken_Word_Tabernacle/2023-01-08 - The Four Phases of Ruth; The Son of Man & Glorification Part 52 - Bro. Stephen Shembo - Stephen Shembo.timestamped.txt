[31:15] fellowship hall yesterday but brother
[31:18] Kelly told me that the fixing the other
[31:20] one so if you get fixed before time so
[31:22] you know where we should go if not
[31:24] though then we have to do what we got to
[31:27] do amen at the end of the service we
[31:30] have a water baptism so I won't tell you
[31:33] who it is you see him after service amen
[31:37] and uh for local ministers whenever you
[31:42] already scheduled to preach and those on
[31:46] the technique uh the technician just
[31:48] remind me they need to give their title
[31:51] at the beginning so it get loaded and we
[31:54] don't have to go back again and search
[31:56] for the title so if you know you're
[31:57] preaching uh maybe 30 minutes before the
[32:01] service just send your title so they can
[32:03] upload it and we don't have to catch up
[32:05] later because we still have to catch on
[32:07] the other title amen and if uh those who
[32:11] are behind on my uh queue so just be
[32:16] patient with me I did the best that I
[32:18] can last year and those online who send
[32:21] me emails I'm sorry I'm loaded right
[32:24] here as soon as I clear what's going on
[32:27] here then I will reply to your email so
[32:30] if you have you need a counseling with
[32:33] me you're already sent your request and
[32:35] uh you need to talk to me just be
[32:37] patient I have a whole long queue and I
[32:41] did the best that I can some counseling
[32:44] uh 30 minutes somehow two hours some uh
[32:49] three hours
[32:50] and it depends on the category or the
[32:54] nature of what I'm dealing with and when
[32:57] they say three hours that's just the
[32:58] counseling by the time I go home I feel
[33:01] like I'm completely worn out because
[33:03] virtue
[33:06] I'm not a prophet I'm just a preacher
[33:08] but virtue you can feel like you are
[33:11] fighting with spirit because people are
[33:13] getting delivered amen so just be
[33:16] patient some of them
[33:18] take I accept if there is uh an
[33:22] emergency
[33:23] have you been to the emergency room
[33:26] amen they will make you wait but if
[33:28] somebody got shot what did they do to
[33:30] the person
[33:31] so they always have a room somewhere
[33:33] where they just bring the person back
[33:35] quickly so if yours you can still
[33:38] breathe you can still walk so just be
[33:40] patient we handle you but if it's a
[33:42] matter of life and death so then quickly
[33:45] I need to jump and then uh do what I
[33:48] gotta do amen so be really really
[33:50] patient on the email on the text I'm
[33:53] trying the best that I can do on last
[33:55] week of December I closed the office but
[33:58] it was just catching up left and right
[34:00] and there's no way I don't even call it
[34:03] a vacation because it turned up to be a
[34:05] counseling week and things like that
[34:07] amen so
[34:10] stay tight everything will be okay amen
[34:13] so you be patient with me I already
[34:16] retrieved the video for December the 3rd
[34:18] so I assume everybody in this church
[34:21] have watched the video you know what it
[34:24] is I have to restructure certain things
[34:26] with brother Robert the way we operate
[34:28] so we can make things better once I get
[34:31] everything squared away then we will
[34:33] schedule for the voting amen but I have
[34:36] to do a lot of switching a lot of things
[34:39] left and right so we make sure when we
[34:42] get here everybody stay on board amen
[34:45] and every technician anybody who's going
[34:48] to be here you need to follow that order
[34:50] if you come late or something you were

[34:56] into the service unless there is an
[34:58] exception or something happened on the
[35:00] highway do not operate just come and sit
[35:02] down because we want everybody to be
[35:04] consecrated and be ready because the

[38:40] wish to attend and to the resurrection
[38:46] you forgot
[38:48] two weeks ago
[38:49] you forgot Paul he said if I can only
[38:52] attend to the resurrection
[38:56] in other words Paul knew he's not going
[38:58] to reach there he will die
[39:02] everybody okay and he closed up the
[39:05] flesh instead thereof
[39:07] and the rib one rib which the Lord God
[39:12] has taken from man
[39:14] made he a water so there was a process
[39:17] as we know which are the seven Church
[39:19] ages and he brought her to the man
[39:23] so if marriage must take place
[39:26] God have to bring you
[39:30] God must take you to your husband
[39:35] nobody else can take you to your husband
[39:40] everybody here if your sister your
[39:44] father
[39:45] or your legal Guardians have to take you
[39:48] to your husband somebody must bring you
[39:50] into the arm
[39:52] everybody okay
[39:54] glory to God made he a woman and brought
[39:58] her to the man Hallelujah and then the
[40:02] Bible says in verse 23 and Adam says
[40:05] this is now born of my bones and Flesh
[40:09] of My Flesh
[40:11] she shall be called a woman because she
[40:14] was taken out of her man remember it's
[40:17] only born and flesh and what we
[40:19] emphasize here is
[40:21] Adam
[40:23] have a
[40:25] a
[40:27] reason why he says born of my bone and
[40:31] Flesh of My Flesh because Eve looked
[40:33] just like him
[40:36] amen so whatever state Adam came out
[40:39] from his resurrection that's exactly the
[40:43] way evil looked like amen you can hand
[40:46] it to either everybody
[40:48] that's fine we have a one amen
[40:51] praise be to the name of the Lord amen
[40:54] let's go to roof chapter 3.
[41:00] glory to God
[41:08] it looks like you read it you say I got
[41:10] it when you read it over you see
[41:12] something else
[41:17] amen
[41:18] verse 8 and he come to pass at midnight
[41:22] you will even memorize this scripture
[41:25] that the man was afraid and he turned
[41:29] himself and behold a woman lay at his
[41:34] feet you know what he means now and he
[41:37] said who are you
[41:39] and she answered I am roof your hands
[41:43] made
[41:44] spread Therefore your skirt you know
[41:46] what it means over your hands man for
[41:49] you are a near Kingsman amen
[41:53] and he said
[41:54] Blessed Be You of the Lord my daughter
[41:58] for you have showed more kindness in the
[42:02] ladder and then the other beginning
[42:06] so the roof
[42:08] at the end
[42:12] is better
[42:16] than the roof at the beginning
[42:21] it is still roof but the end of roof is
[42:26] better
[42:27] than the beginning
[42:29] [Applause]
[42:31] the Bible says this in the book of Hagar
[42:36] he said the glory of this water a lot of
[42:39] house shall be how greater than off the
[42:43] water former says the Lord of hosts and
[42:46] in this place will I give peace Shalom
[42:49] say the Lord of host so the glory of the
[42:54] last house
[42:56] [Applause]
[42:58] is better than the glory of the first
[43:02] so the roof of the end time
[43:04] [Applause]
[43:07] is the one roof but the roof of the end
[43:11] time
[43:12] the roof that is asking for marriage
[43:16] is better than the roof of the beginning
[43:21] everybody okay
[43:22] [Music]
[43:24] in as much as you follow that young man
[43:27] whether poor or Rich
[43:30] and now my daughter fear not
[43:33] I will do to you all that you require
[43:39] for all the city of my people does know
[43:42] that you are a virtuous woman she had
[43:45] the testimony that she pleased God
[43:49] because somebody had the testimony that
[43:53] she pleased God he pleased God and God
[43:56] did something to that person
[43:59] glory to God
[44:02] verse 12 and now it is true that I am
[44:06] your near Kinsman however
[44:11] there is a Kingsman near the night in
[44:15] other words there is nothing about
[44:17] getting married
[44:19] bearing married I will do it for you but
[44:23] before me and you can get married we
[44:26] gotta deal with something
[44:30] amen and that's something that person is
[44:34] also a near Kinsman
[44:37] as long as that person has a right
[44:41] on roof
[44:44] everybody okay no marriage will come
[44:49] so we got to kick him out
[44:52] everybody okay kick him out kick him out
[44:56] you know that song okay praise God
[44:59] verse 13 He says Terry this night and it
[45:03] shall be in the morning it's still the
[45:07] same day remember that it is still the
[45:10] same day the same age we're not moving
[45:13] to a different age the same age but the
[45:16] timing is different
[45:17] amen Terry this night and it shall be in
[45:22] the morning that if he will perform to
[45:25] you the part of the King's Men
[45:28] well let him do this part this Kingsman
[45:31] part
[45:32] how can you even say that
[45:35] but if he will not do the part of the
[45:39] Kinsmen to you
[45:43] who do they have to redeem roof
[45:46] they have to redeem Naomi
[45:48] right amen
[45:50] amen
[45:51] but Boaz is saying not if he refused to
[45:56] do The Kingsmen to Naomi
[46:04] we got two women
[46:06] we got roof and we got Naomi roof is a
[46:11] gentile you heard brother Robert she's
[46:14] not a Jewish woman
[46:16] Redemption how are they going to redeem
[46:18] magenta
[46:20] they are redeeming Naomi
[46:23] but Boaz is saying if that man doesn't
[46:27] want to redeem you
[46:31] not Naomi
[46:33] scripture don't play with words
[46:36] not Naomi
[46:38] so Naomi is not the problem
[46:41] the problem is roof
[46:43] you will see it shortly
[46:45] amen then will he will I do the part of
[46:50] the King's Men to you as the Lord live
[46:54] with what is he doing
[47:04] he's swearing by enough
[47:09] you know whosoever I know
[47:12] amen so this is like Revelation 10
[47:16] Happening Here
[47:19] somebody's swearing
[47:25] who's swearing Boaz himself
[47:29] because he cannot swear by no greater
[47:31] than him
[47:33] [Applause]
[47:36] as the Lord live a flight down until the
[47:40] morning and she laid at his feet
[47:45] until the morning
[47:47] and she rose up before one could know
[47:51] another
[47:53] and he said let it not be known that a
[47:58] woman came in the floor into the floor
[48:01] it's a secret it's not a public show
[48:04] also he said bring the veil that you
[48:08] have upon you
[48:11] she has a veil
[48:17] amen Ruth has affair that she cover
[48:20] herself
[48:22] now the veil is removed
[48:26] okay
[48:30] and when she held it
[48:32] he measured six measures of water barley
[48:38] and laid it on her
[48:40] and she went into the water he didn't
[48:43] give seven measure he gave six because
[48:47] the seventh one is himself
[48:51] everybody okay it is the seven that
[48:53] opened the six
[48:56] amen
[48:57] everybody okay
[48:58] glory to God
[49:00] let me deal with this thing here go to
[49:03] chapter four
[49:05] so somebody will catch it
[49:10] he looks like brother John's time goes
[49:12] slowly and my time runs quicker
[49:19] as soon as I start here it's like the
[49:22] clock does something
[49:25] by the polycarb we need to stop time
[49:30] like Joshua roof chapter 4 verse three
[49:33] if you dare you can say amen amen we're
[49:36] talking about a Kingsman near
[49:38] and he said to the Kinsmen
[49:41] Naomi that is come again
[49:45] out of the country of Moab they're
[49:47] talking about Naomi everybody okay
[49:50] sells a parcel of land which was our
[49:54] brother and limelicks everybody okay
[49:58] and I thought to advertise you saying
[50:01] buy it before they inhabit it
[50:04] and before the Elders of my people if
[50:08] you will redeem it the word is
[50:10] redemption bringing back
[50:12] if you will redeem it redeem it but if
[50:16] you will not redeem it
[50:18] Boaz presented Naomi
[50:22] he didn't present the roof
[50:24] amen watch carefully then tell me that I
[50:29] may know for there is none to redeem
[50:33] to redeem it beside you and I am after
[50:37] you
[50:42] everybody okay so the kids man will be
[50:46] always the first in your life
[50:53] everybody okay the King's Men this near
[50:57] Kinsmen will be always the first to have
[51:01] a right in your life
[51:05] amen and Boaz will be always the last to
[51:10] come in your life
[51:13] so when your life starts when you're
[51:15] coming out of Mama
[51:17] the first one who start with you is this
[51:21] Kingman
[51:21] [Music]
[51:24] he wait to ride on you because the way
[51:27] you are born is wrong
[51:30] [Applause]
[51:33] everybody okay because you were born in
[51:36] sin shaping water coming into the world
[51:40] doing water so he's right there
[51:44] he has a right on you
[51:46] [Applause]
[51:49] the problem is if we ask him to redeem
[51:53] you that's where we want to see him
[51:55] everybody okay so Boaz always will be
[51:59] last
[52:00] everybody okay are we together amen
[52:03] glory to God
[52:06] verse uh four he said that I may know
[52:09] for there is none to redeem it beside
[52:12] you and I am after you and he said that
[52:17] Kingsman he said I will do whatever
[52:19] redeem it
[52:22] so Boaz is like
[52:25] oh my God
[52:28] is that what you think
[52:31] is that what you think
[52:32] that was the first weapon Boaz have a
[52:36] second one
[52:40] everybody okay when he said Naomi then
[52:43] he goes
[52:44] yes Naomi I have a right
[52:47] everybody okay
[52:48] Watch Who's Gonna who that these
[52:52] Kingsman doesn't like

[53:33] [Music]
[53:35] when they say an army I will take it
[53:39] when they say roof
[53:42] so really the intent of Boaz was not
[53:46] Naomi
[53:50] Boaz didn't want to marry Naomi Naomi
[53:54] was already old
[53:55] [Applause]
[53:58] everybody okay everybody okay let's see

[54:45] doesn't want to hear about you
[54:51] everybody okay why he doesn't like you
[54:56] why

[1:00:11] the Bible said for the husband is the
[1:00:14] head of the wife even as Christ is the
[1:00:17] head of the church and he is the savior
[1:00:20] of the body we found out that Christ did
[1:00:23] this in the first coming as the son of
[1:00:26] man
[1:00:27] everybody okay
[1:00:29] therefore as the church is subject to
[1:00:33] Christ
[1:00:35] so let the wives be to their own husband
[1:00:38] we went through this in everything
[1:00:41] for a woman to believe you or to respect
[1:00:43] you in everything you must be in
[1:00:46] everything good

[1:00:56] you cannot tell your wife go still
[1:01:00] she cannot do that
[1:01:05] you can review the sermon we already
[1:01:07] went through this
[1:01:09] husband verse 25 love your wife even as
[1:01:13] Christ also loved the church and gave
[1:01:16] himself for it he did it under the son
[1:01:19] of man
[1:01:20] verse 26 that he must sanctify and
[1:01:25] cleanse it we went through this with the
[1:01:28] washing of the Water by the word what's
[1:01:31] the purpose that he not somebody else ma

[1:01:43] Church

[1:01:51] not water spot spot with speaking about
[1:01:55] the Inner Man the sin which is a portion
[1:01:58] of redemption remember a part
[1:02:01] you remember
[1:02:03] do you remember okay praise God with
[1:02:08] that spot our water and Winkle speak of
[1:02:11] the water the body or the flesh
[1:02:14] everybody okay with that spot on wrinkle
[1:02:18] or any such
[1:02:20] but that it should be how holy and
[1:02:23] without water blemish
[1:02:25] why this characteristic why we must be
[1:02:28] holy why do we have to be without
[1:02:31] blemish why
[1:02:34] everybody okay job to verse 32 and 30.
[1:02:38] for we are members of his body
[1:02:43] of his body Kama of his flesh and of his
[1:02:47] water bones we are members of his body
[1:02:50] of his
[1:02:52] and of his water bonds
[1:02:55] no blood
[1:02:57] remember that
[1:02:59] amen
[1:03:00] verse 31 for discourse shall man leave
[1:03:04] his father and mother and shall be
[1:03:07] joined to his wife and the two shall be
[1:03:10] how one flesh this is a great mystery
[1:03:14] but I speak concerning hope Christ and
[1:03:18] the church everybody okay now let's pray
[1:03:21] and we can take off Heavenly Father Lord
[1:03:24] we are approaching you humbly again
[1:03:26] father this morning thanking you for
[1:03:28] your grace your love your mercy and for
[1:03:31] everything you have been doing for us
[1:03:33] father this is as far as I can go with
[1:03:36] the ability you have given me Lord we
[1:03:39] are surrendering everything and asking
[1:03:41] you to move us completely out of the way
[1:03:43] may you come and speak to your children
[1:03:45] Lord father come in Lord unfold your
[1:03:49] word yourself because you the one that
[1:03:52] can interpret your word Lord father we
[1:03:54] rebuke everything that is contrary to
[1:03:56] your word against father the kingdom of
[1:04:00] the devil may he depart from this place
[1:04:03] in the name of Jesus Christ be the half
[1:04:06] and the Omega in the name of Jesus
[1:04:08] Christ amen
[1:04:10] everybody okay so far glory be to God my
[1:04:15] subject this morning
[1:04:21] is on the board
[1:04:24] it's the four phases of roof
[1:04:27] this son of man and glorification
[1:04:34] you must have a body that is glorious
[1:04:38] hey everybody okay
[1:04:40] I gave this startup because we didn't
[1:04:43] finish last time hey man I could call
[1:04:47] this body change part two
[1:04:49] but it will be confusing
[1:04:51] amen so in reference for reference I
[1:04:56] switch a different terminology but the
[1:04:58] terminology always means the same thing
[1:05:02] everybody okay so when we say body
[1:05:04] change when we're talking about
[1:05:06] glorification we're talking about the
[1:05:10] same thing everybody okay so there's
[1:05:13] four phases of roof the son of man and
[1:05:17] glorification we're still on our reading
[1:05:20] in the threshing floor and we will God
[1:05:23] willing deal with the second all a
[1:05:25] little bit more deeper in our Tabernacle
[1:05:28] we are in the holiest and we found out
[1:05:31] that roof has four phases
[1:05:34] just a refresher that brother Branham
[1:05:36] said from the four different phases of
[1:05:39] roof I got it wrote here roof doing what
[1:05:42] deciding making her decision roof
[1:05:44] serving roof resting roof rewarded as we
[1:05:48] come back roof making the decision roof
[1:05:52] after she made her decision then roof is
[1:05:54] serving then roof is resting then roof
[1:05:57] is water rewarded so if you notice the
[1:06:00] Tabernacle only have three parts
[1:06:05] everybody okay not fall apart
[1:06:09] everybody okay because the rewarding
[1:06:11] have nothing to do with the Tabernacle
[1:06:16] the rewarding is enough sin
[1:06:20] in the Tabernacle
[1:06:23] everybody okay

[1:27:05] again to the water fear Don't Be Afraid
[1:27:08] Anymore
[1:27:10] because perfect love
[1:27:13] but you have received the spirit of
[1:27:17] water adoption what does adoption mean
[1:27:19] [Music]
[1:27:22] why
[1:27:23] why do they have to adopt you
[1:27:27] you know when we say adoption
[1:27:30] when we say adoption we usually think
[1:27:34] like you were born from another parent
[1:27:37] okay then they bring you up and there's
[1:27:41] some kind of a custody and they say so
[1:27:44] and so we have a child mother is drunk
[1:27:47] dad is drunk they cannot take care of
[1:27:50] him so you go ahead and get that child
[1:27:52] that's how we understand adoption
[1:27:56] let me correct your Pentecostal
[1:27:59] understanding
[1:28:02] watch what adoption does to you
[1:28:05] he said you have received the spirit of
[1:28:09] water adoption
[1:28:11] what does the spirit of adoption do
[1:28:16] are you watching your Bible
[1:28:18] whereby
[1:28:21] in other words the spirit of adoption
[1:28:24] amen is what you are using
[1:28:28] to do something with it what are you
[1:28:31] doing with that spirit
[1:28:33] we ready
[1:28:34] whereby
[1:28:37] we cry
[1:28:41] we cry water and water how about father
[1:28:45] what does he mean Abba Father
[1:28:49] [Music]
[1:28:51] yeah
[1:28:53] you know
[1:28:55] we don't understand the scripture
[1:28:58] usually we say Abba Father we're looking
[1:29:00] like oh God my father God is my father
[1:29:03] so now I become a child of God that's
[1:29:06] why I'm crying to my father
[1:29:08] what does why does the spirit didn't say
[1:29:13] God
[1:29:17] why didn't the spirit say my creator
[1:29:21] why didn't the spirit say this great
[1:29:24] being
[1:29:26] that is greater than me
[1:29:28] the spirit is saying Abba Father in
[1:29:33] other word when that Spirit come on you
[1:29:36] when you look at God
[1:29:40] the spirit will make you call god father
[1:29:46] we still have not understand when we say
[1:29:50] calling god father you looking at
[1:29:53] brother Charles and brother Charleston
[1:29:58] keep your finger right here let's go to
[1:30:01] the Book of John chapter 5.
[1:30:04] it's a dangerous things
[1:30:06] to call god father
[1:30:09] very dangerous
[1:30:12] you're going to understand it let's go
[1:30:14] to John 5. brother Robert
[1:30:16] I was aiming for 70 miles I'm going 25.
[1:30:21] everybody okay
[1:30:24] [Laughter]
[1:30:26] let's go to John chapter 5 because when
[1:30:29] we say father father you don't
[1:30:32] understand to call God the Father it's
[1:30:35] dangerous
[1:30:38] you still have not cut me when you call
[1:30:41] God your father it's very dangerous you
[1:30:45] can get killed
[1:30:49] don't worry if you and John 5 tell me
[1:30:52] yes
[1:30:54] look at verse 18.
[1:31:01] let's change your thinking now aha let's
[1:31:06] change your thinking now
[1:31:08] therefore the Jews
[1:31:11] saw the more to love Jesus
[1:31:15] they wanted to do what you kill him why
[1:31:19] do they want to kill Jesus
[1:31:21] [Music]
[1:31:22] why do they want to kill Jesus Karma
[1:31:25] because
[1:31:28] he not told me had done water walk in
[1:31:31] the Sabbath but
[1:31:35] said also that what God what is water
[1:31:39] father let's stop there
[1:31:41] just stop where we are the Jews when

[1:36:59] how is the mind of Christ
[1:37:02] the mind of Christ is how
[1:37:07] we okay
[1:37:08] jump to the next verse which was also in
[1:37:12] water Christ Jesus who Jesus Christ
[1:37:16] being in the water form of God
[1:37:20] foreign
[1:37:25] let me stop here
[1:37:29] which form do you have
[1:37:31] [Music]

[1:38:08] says but he said who being in the water
[1:38:11] form of God
[1:38:13] it's not water rubbery
[1:38:17] do you know what a robbery means
[1:38:19] so Jesus
[1:38:22] in his mind
[1:38:25] let's read it don't eat nut water
[1:38:31] God so when Jesus said I am God
[1:38:36] Jesus was not thinking like I am
[1:38:40] stealing something from God
[1:38:43] belong to me
[1:38:44] [Applause]
[1:38:51] everybody okay write a polycarp when you
[1:38:55] call yourself polycarp did you steal
[1:38:57] something
[1:38:59] you steal from who
[1:39:00] his name is polycarp Jr when Jesus said
[1:39:04] I am God Jesus didn't steal anything
[1:39:08] it belongs to it the title of God
[1:39:11] Emmanuel which means water
[1:39:13] [Applause]
[1:39:15] everybody okay everybody okay so the
[1:39:18] mind of Jesus Christ when Jesus said
[1:39:21] father it is not the way you think
[1:39:25] Jesus was saying I am God
[1:39:28] everybody okay and when Jesus say I am
[1:39:31] God he is not even doubting
[1:39:34] he's not even complex
[1:39:38] people who say ah you making yourself
[1:39:41] like a god no Jesus was proud
[1:39:45] that's right
[1:39:51] let's go back to Roman 8.
[1:39:57] now you understand things differently
[1:40:01] we okay now
[1:40:02] verse 15. so we have not received a
[1:40:06] spirit of water bondage
[1:40:09] bondage
[1:40:10] bondage
[1:40:12] bondage huh
[1:40:14] my father

[1:40:58] the law is finished
[1:41:01] the law is finishing
[1:41:05] [Applause]
[1:41:08] that's why Paul said when we approach
[1:41:11] the throne of grace we are brought how
[1:41:14] boldly
[1:41:17] [Applause]
[1:41:22] it says bondage again to the water fear
[1:41:28] they go no no if you touch the mountain
[1:41:31] they will kill you
[1:41:32] bondage Israel bondage
[1:41:36] bondage
[1:41:38] everybody okay Karma but we receive the
[1:41:41] spirit of water adoption whereby we cry
[1:41:44] water so the Holy Spirit give you the
[1:41:48] Badness
[1:41:50] to call God equal
[1:41:55] forever
[1:41:59] let me put the last screw stabilizing
[1:42:04] okay look at the second verse
[1:42:07] the spirit itself
[1:42:10] bad water witness to our spirit that we
[1:42:14] are water children of God you understand
[1:42:17] now children of God is different

[1:43:11] because they say that we are how
[1:43:13] children of God when we say again
[1:43:15] children of God both of you so God the
[1:43:18] Father God the father because it's many
[1:43:21] children let's see

[1:43:26] said
[1:43:30] God is talking I have said yeah how gods
[1:43:35] and all of you are house Children of the
[1:43:39] most high so the children of God means

[1:43:48] this is what trouble you verse 7 but you
[1:43:53] shall do what die like water man
[1:43:56] that's why you get trouble
[1:43:58] because you die like man you think
[1:44:00] you're not God question did Jesus die
[1:44:05] so what is the problem
[1:44:09] was Jesus God yes did he die amen so
[1:44:12] what's the problem let's go back to
[1:44:14] Roman 8 again foreign
[1:44:18] now children of God father you
[1:44:21] understand who you are now watch now
[1:44:24] Romans chapter 8 verse 16. the spirit
[1:44:28] itself bear witness with our spirit that
[1:44:31] we are one children of God you
[1:44:33] understand children of God means water
[1:44:35] Gods Gods amen
[1:44:37] and if children
[1:44:42] because you call him father
[1:44:51] what are you going to inherit from God
[1:44:53] [Music]
[1:44:56] everybody okay stop you inherit
[1:45:00] something when somebody die will God die
[1:45:06] everybody okay everybody okay we are
[1:45:09] hairs of God and how John is
[1:45:15] joint hell with who Christ that Christ
[1:45:18] was God
[1:45:20] so we and Jesus we are not like one on
[1:45:24] top of the other
[1:45:25] we are joined we are equal
[1:45:31] 50 50
[1:45:32] [Music]
[1:45:33] you put it together you have God in one
[1:45:37] hundred percent
[1:45:38] [Applause]
[1:45:42] everybody okay we are joined hair
[1:45:46] man shall leave his father and mother
[1:45:50] and shall cling with his wife and the
[1:45:52] two shall be held so with that me Jesus
[1:45:55] is not one flesh
[1:45:57] oh yeah
[1:45:59] [Applause]
[1:46:03] let's continue
[1:46:05] it will suck later on some are still
[1:46:08] struggling with deflation don't worry
[1:46:09] amen if children then have hair of God
[1:46:13] and how with Christ if so be that we
[1:46:17] suffer
[1:46:19] with him comma that we may also how
[1:46:23] glorified together so if Jesus was
[1:46:27] glorified
[1:46:29] let's finish the problem in other word
[1:46:32] whatever happened in Jesus Christ must
[1:46:36] happen in your life
[1:46:39] everybody okay
[1:46:41] job to verse 18.
[1:46:45] four I reckon that the suffering of this
[1:46:49] water present time are not water worthy
[1:46:52] to be compared
[1:46:55] with the water Glory the son of man and
[1:46:58] glorification with the water
[1:47:01] Glory which shall be have revealed where
[1:47:05] in us so there is a glory in you
[1:47:10] that will be revealed
[1:47:15] everybody okay everybody okay
[1:47:19] verse 19 for the water earnest
[1:47:22] you see the earnest expectation of the
[1:47:25] water
[1:47:26] creature wait for the water
[1:47:28] manifestation of the water sons of God
[1:47:31] creation is waiting to seek gods
[1:47:35] but you still behave like human beings
[1:47:41] because creation was married with Adam
[1:47:46] the guy used to Adam when Adam is there
[1:47:49] everything is good Adam is no longer
[1:47:51] there so they are waiting for Adam
[1:47:54] [Applause]
[1:47:58] everybody okay everybody okay verse 20
[1:48:01] for the creature once made house subject
[1:48:04] to vanity not willingly amen they didn't
[1:48:08] sin but by his son of water him who
[1:48:12] subjected the same in water hope because
[1:48:15] the creature itself
[1:48:17] also shall be how delivered from the
[1:48:20] water bondage everybody okay the bondage
[1:48:24] of water corruption corruption happened
[1:48:27] in the body or it happened in the soul
[1:48:31] everybody okay because this body comes
[1:48:34] from the
[1:48:37] amen through the corruption to the from
[1:48:40] the bondage of corruption into the house
[1:48:44] glorious Liberty the Liberty is glorious
[1:48:49] a church that is
[1:48:53] we okay now the Glorious Liberty of the

[1:58:43] all right
[1:58:45] where are we heading brother Branham say
[1:58:48] the next one in the parable because in
[1:58:51] the parable we found out that
[1:58:54] boas talk to Ruth and boys say you know
[1:58:57] what there is somebody
[1:58:59] that is near Kingsman to me everybody
[1:59:02] okay that person is blocking me from
[1:59:05] marrying you and we found out that when
[1:59:07] they brought the name of Ruth the men
[1:59:09] back up who is that person
[1:59:12] brother Brian I'm saying this the
[1:59:14] message water the Kings the next one in
[1:59:19] the parable the head option on you was
[1:59:23] who the devil
[1:59:26] [Music]
[1:59:29] he was the right-hand man of God
[1:59:31] he was the near Kinsman
[1:59:34] he was Heaven in the Book of Esther
[1:59:38] [Music]
[1:59:40] he was Judas Iscariot close to Jesus
[1:59:44] he's always me
[1:59:46] [Music]
[1:59:50] everybody okay and then he said because
[1:59:53] you had water and you first and first
[1:59:56] you belong to who him because you you
[1:59:59] are his water property for you are born
[2:00:02] in sin shaping water coming into the
[2:00:05] world speaking lie and he could not
[2:00:08] redeem it see he could not redeem it so
[2:00:11] Christ come
[2:00:12] and May and was made how to take away
[2:00:17] and the other man could not do it the
[2:00:21] devil could not die for sin
[2:00:23] [Applause]
[2:00:24] because he was the very perverted
[2:00:28] that man he couldn't do it he would do
[2:00:31] it more his inheritance the other fellow
[2:00:34] and Satan would water mark because he is
[2:00:38] the devil what are you talking about by
[2:00:41] the devil
[2:00:42] the Bible says this
[2:00:44] for as much then as the children APA
[2:00:48] take care of the Flesh and Blood he
[2:00:50] Jesus also himself like was took part of
[2:00:54] water he became human like you that
[2:00:57] proof he might destroy him that has the
[2:01:03] power of them that is water the devil
[2:01:11] the devil the devil in the flesh not in
[2:01:15] your spirit
[2:01:17] the Bible says in Revelation 6 and I
[2:01:20] look and Beyond a pen horse
[2:01:22] and his name
[2:01:25] that sat on him was water yes
[2:01:29] okay his name that sat on him was water
[2:01:32] yes why is the last stage dealing with
[2:01:36] death
[2:01:36] [Music]
[2:01:41] in the college we didn't know his name
[2:01:45] and when you didn't know his name
[2:01:47] colomba didn't know his name Paul was
[2:01:50] crying out
[2:01:51] but at the end time
[2:01:54] the son of man must come
[2:01:57] to decode his name
[2:02:00] because
[2:02:05] to administer the proper treatment you
[2:02:09] need to identify the disease
[2:02:14] everybody okay you need to identify who
[2:02:17] has been riding this horses who has been
[2:02:20] troubling the church who is he what is
[2:02:24] his name where is he coming from and
[2:02:27] throughout the ages nobody picked him up
[2:02:29] only an eagle anointing
[2:02:34] everybody okay and the eagle have
[2:02:36] nothing call his name water and death we
[2:02:40] find his way outside the body
[2:02:46] the purpose of this message
[2:02:49] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:02:51] and the Bible says that his name was
[2:02:54] death and hell did water and power was
[2:02:58] given unto him over the fourth part of
[2:02:59] the earth to do what killed with sword
[2:03:04] so what is blocking you
[2:03:06] from seeing Jesus is death
[2:03:18] everybody okay
[2:03:20] Paul died
[2:03:22] the Saints die and when they said die we
[2:03:27] usually say they're going into the
[2:03:29] presence of the Lord
[2:03:33] everybody okay but when brother brought
[2:03:36] him ahead in its field okay
[2:03:38] and he went there
[2:03:41] he looked
[2:03:44] you follow me he doesn't see Jesus he
[2:03:49] only see the people that he preached to
[2:03:52] this is brother so and so this is Sister
[2:03:54] so and so this is a hope my first wife
[2:03:58] this is who and by the brand I'm
[2:04:00] stopping say wait a minute where is
[2:04:02] Jesus
[2:04:03] [Applause]
[2:04:08] why was brother Branham unable to see
[2:04:12] Jesus
[2:04:23] I am
[2:04:25] there is still a blockage
[2:04:29] even in the sixth Dimension because
[2:04:32] Redemption is not in fullness yet
[2:04:35] [Applause]
[2:04:40] everybody okay the only way you can see
[2:04:44] him face to face Redemption must be
[2:04:47] completed
[2:04:52] that's why they without us cannot be
[2:04:57] made perfect
[2:04:59] [Music]
[2:05:03] I'm just charging
[2:05:05] [Applause]
[2:05:06] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:05:10] glory to God the Bible says this brother
[2:05:13] Branham says this
[2:05:17] in this body is who death and death we
[2:05:21] find that who have the power of death
[2:05:23] the devil everybody okay everybody okay
[2:05:27] this devil have a power on your flesh
[2:05:31] anybody okay as long as the church
[2:05:36] everybody okay have not reached full
[2:05:39] Redemption yet the devil have access in
[2:05:44] heaven

[2:05:53] let me help you up the reason why the
[2:05:57] devil is accusing you because of your
[2:06:00] flesh
[2:06:04] your flesh is what give the devil right

[2:06:09] and say father he did this
[2:06:12] look at him he did this
[2:06:14] what makes you sin is not your soul
[2:06:19] because he that is born against sickness

[2:07:10] they will do it again let him get to
[2:07:13] what they got and someone else is saying
[2:07:15] you need to repent it is your body and
[2:07:19] yours feel that are fighting together
[2:07:21] the black dog and the white dog
[2:07:25] [Music]
[2:07:29] the greatest battle ever thought he
[2:07:32] begin now in US brother Brian I'm saying
[2:07:34] everybody okay so in order to stop the
[2:07:38] devil from going into heaven Redemption
[2:07:42] must take place in the fullness
[2:07:46] we Okay we okay yes let me change again
[2:07:51] said the church is water taken out and
[2:07:55] Satan is water
[2:07:57] why are you Satan is cast out
[2:08:01] because there is nothing else
[2:08:07] there is no more access
[2:08:10] the day we receive our body change the
[2:08:14] access code of the devil in heaven is
[2:08:17] fires
[2:08:18] [Music]
[2:08:19] [Applause]
[2:08:21] come on foreign
[2:08:23] [Music]
[2:08:31] this is where he operates so when we
[2:08:34] move into the glorification
[2:08:37] his past God expires
[2:08:43] [Applause]
[2:08:45] brother Branham say when the church goes
[2:08:48] out certain does water calms down
[2:08:53] everybody okay why is Satan coming down
[2:08:55] only when we go up
[2:08:58] what was he doing up there
[2:09:01] watch brother random but I'm saying
[2:09:03] notice he shall be given the heart of
[2:09:06] the water peace at that time and Satan
[2:09:08] we love you will incarnate how himself
[2:09:10] because when the church goes out Satan
[2:09:13] is water it is done damn it is all his
[2:09:19] water our water's done
[2:09:22] [Applause]
[2:09:24] that's why your body your spirit is
[2:09:28] crying is running for Redemption so we
[2:09:32] can kick the devil out of the body
[2:09:35] Australia

[2:09:41] body your spirit is in redeemed your
[2:09:44] body is redeemed then you are 100 ready

[2:27:21] this man is called Jesus of Nazareth
[2:27:31] to show you where he came from
[2:27:36] there is a false teaching in the message
[2:27:39] that says that Jesus of Nazareth is not
[2:27:44] God but Jesus the word is God
[2:27:48] because on the road to a man to Damascus
[2:27:52] the pillar of fire say I am Jesus

[2:52:08] that have come down and enlightened this
[2:52:11] scripture
[2:52:12] to remove the confusion that have been
[2:52:15] lingering in this message for years
[2:52:18] until your children
[2:52:20] believe things that they don't even
[2:52:21] understand
[2:52:23] and they say things that they don't know
[2:52:26] and one challenge with the scripture
[2:52:28] they don't even know where they're
[2:52:30] standing
[2:52:31] but father not because we are big
[2:52:33] somebody
[2:52:34] we are the list of all but Lord you look
[2:52:37] at us Through The Eyes Of Love
[2:52:39] and Lord You Came Down
[2:52:42] for whoever was struggling or whoever
[2:52:44] was attacked or receive a message that
[2:52:48] we're bragging about the desert of
[2:52:49] Arizona
[2:52:51] father today you have enlightened to
[2:52:53] them
[2:52:54] that when we say that Jesus that came
[2:52:56] we're talking about the word
[2:52:58] the coming word
[2:53:00] the coming Mighty angel that is coming

[2:53:14] may you move our heart closer today
[2:53:17] may we understand how important it is to
[2:53:21] be redeemed on the Inside Man
[2:53:24] so that we can be candidate and be sure
[2:53:28] that if that spirit dwelleth in US we

[2:54:03] nothing in this world that will make us
[2:54:06] comfortable

[2:54:17] our life that will stop our sickness it
[2:54:20] will stop our preaching it will stop our
[2:54:22] healing it will stop every sorrow and

[2:54:59] the anointing of the white wig the
[2:55:01] Supreme judge himself declaring the bad
[2:55:04] justifies what followed justification is
[2:55:07] glorification
[2:55:09] but you have to come yes yes you have to
