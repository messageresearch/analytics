for the word amen as we are now said on wednesday we have brother andrew glover there's nothing i can tell you about him you know him better he's just like a part of us here amen he always reminds me brother wayne larson they're always on fire they stay on fire they don't change amen that's the way we want it to be no matter up and down they stay on fire amen the contagious christian hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord brother robert already announced you about sister mary we used to give her a ride lord if i'm not mistaken since she was 72. so she passed a 90. so we had an opportunity to see her we brought robert and sister lorell on thursday her daughter sent me a message this morning so we'll keep up with what they're going to be doing there whether the funeral and things like that she has been like a mother to me i knew her for a long time and been giving her a ride and everything but i pray we pray with brother robert and i told her i say in her subconscious i know she can hear us because she had a stroke so she could not move pretty much and say sister mary the lord can still raise you but if he doesn't raise you up and it's your time to go we meet you in the air amen that's the hope of christian the power to know him in the power of his resurrection amen you always want to keep the power of resurrection because if the quickening power that's what raised the dead heal the sick and does everything if god can defeat death there is nothing else that is out there that the lord cannot do amen so the work of the building already started just keep us in prayer and what we spoke with the trustees is that every second week of the month and every fourth week of the month we will be taking the building fund offering so if you want to bring it every day that's fine but we want to just kind of get get you time to get prepared so the second sunday and the fourth sunday we will be taking a regular offering and then the building fund so at least you have a time to get prepared for building fun because we need it to continue the building so if the trustees come here and continue to remind you that's the anointing amen that's their job i'm not going to get there they're going to keep telling you but mike is there but the team is there so they will continue to remind you until we get the job done it looks like it's a mountain there's a lot to be done but there is nothing too hard that the lord cannot handle amen we move by faith and faith can move the mountain even if it's a lot of tiny faith like this if you speak to this mountain that's it the mountain will be moved so brother andrew you here we only have one service take your liberty preach like your home amen and go ahead and let the holy spirit have his own way amen only believe only believe [Music] oh lee believe [Music] all things are possible only believe [Music] thank you things [Music] so all things are possible jesus [Music] but if he is here this morning then all things are possible amen heard the prophet of god say the other day he said you say well all things are possible in jesus he said all things are possible with you he said because he is in you and i believe this morning the greatest of all mysteries is christ in us amen the hope of glory do you believe that this morning can we just bow our hearts together for word of prayer let's just ask the lord to come this morning and speak to our hearts he knows the needs he knows the situations he's the answer to the problems he's the healer to the sicknesses he's a deliverer to the captains this morning heavenly father lord as your believers have gathered here today lord we don't gather here out of tradition father we don't gather here out of ritual the lord we gather here because there is a deep calling to the deep and lord your word says that the lord that didn't call there has to be a need to respond lord i believe this morning that there's a house full of believers here today lord that we're not desiring lord to be seen to be heard we're not desiring to be anything but what you would have us to be lord lord we know the enemy's fighting on every hand doing everything he can to stop and to defeat but this morning lord we say greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world and father i believe as these believers are here today lord we've come lord we're desiring more of you lord desiring more of your word desiring more of your power and lord we know that you're if there is a desire in our heart for more of you then there's more of you somewhere for us this morning and lord we don't believe there's more of you for us in the denomination lord or in a creed or in a dogma but lord we truly believe there is more of you for us in your word so now as the songs of zion have been sung lord as the atmosphere has been created i pray this morning o god may your ministry and angels come in this building may you drive out every unbelieving spirit lord now lord as we endeavor to open your word we know anyone with physical strength can open this book but lord it's going to take you to come and it's going to take you to reveal lord the things that we're reading and the things that we're hearing so father come this morning be the welcome guest among us lord lord for those who would desire to be here but can't maybe watching by the way of the internet may be sick in their body i don't know the needs but you do i'm asking this morning oh god may you minister to those this morning and father for those who would be here today lord may you give us a special touch of your grace and we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for to the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believers said amen god bless you this morning amen do you love the lord amen while you're standing this morning if you have your bibles we'll invite you to the book of saint john the fifth chapter of the book of saint john the fifth chapter and we have a few places we'd like to read this morning with you in the bible but beginning there in saint john 5. and while you're turning there we want to take this opportunity to greet you this morning in the name of the lord we sure counted an honor and a privilege to be here with you once again appreciate brother stephen invitation to come and the friendship and the stand that's been taken here and we sure appreciate the church here this morning and i want to bring you greetings from our pastor brother sean martin and all the saints back home at faith tabernacle send their greetings to you all as well this morning and that was just honored to be a christian honored to be believing this message amen and sure good to have our family here with us this morning god bless you all and this morning if we could look in saint john the fifth chapter i want to look in the the 21st verse the bible here says for as the father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them even so the son quickeneth whom he will for the father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgment unto the son that all men should honor the son even as they honor the father for he that honoreth not the son honoreth not the father which hath sent him verily verily i say unto you he that heareth number says that word heareth means understandeth so he that understandeth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life verily verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice somebody say the voice shall hear the voice of the son of god and they that hear shall live for as the father hath the life in himself so after he given the son to have life in himself and hath given him authority to execute judgment also because he is the son of man because he is the son of man now notice verse 28 marvel not at this for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the grave shall hear the voice his voice and shall come forth they that have done good under the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation now if we could go the book of luke the 17th chapter there in john 5 jesus is speaking and saying he is the son of man and here in luke of the 17th chapter and the 30th verse i know this is a bride scripture amen in luke 17 30 jesus you're speaking now says even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed when the son of man is revealed but the realm says or jesus christ made manifest in his people so the hour shall be when the son of man is revealed or when jesus christ is made manifest in his people and i believe this morning i'm looking at the people that the son of man is going to be manifested in in this hour and one other place i'd like to read before we let you be seated is revelation 10 and verse 7 the devil hates this verse but i'd like to dedicate it to him just once again this morning if that'd be okay in revelation 10 and verse 7 the bible here speaking says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets let's read that together but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets we asked the lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you may have your seats there for just a few moments this morning from those scriptures if the lord would help me i'd like to speak to you here and if i will title this this morning maybe just talk to you here for a few moments on obey the voice of the son of man obey the voice of the son of man and maybe just to lay a bit of a foundation here sometime back i was listening to some tapes and a series of tapes there and bill abraham actually makes a statement there that really just struck my heart he says now if you recognize he is just using my voice it would say he is just using my voice and i'll let this read this quote he said now i'm asking you to all be reverent just as reverend as you can you say brother branham what are you talking about you're stalling he said i am exactly i am waiting for that angel of the lord to come that's exactly right i don't know none of you and how can i do anything i can't it's him i can't it's him i can't do it even when he comes unless your faith operates it amen it's not me so the prophet here is removing himself altogether from the equation and saying i can't do it even if he comes i can't do nothing it's your faith that operates it he said see i can't see visions unless it's your faith that does it sure god will by divine gift only thing i do is just keep yielding myself and as i get myself completely yielded to the holy spirit then he starts talking it's no me he's using my voice he said but it's not me it's him he is using my voice but it's not me it's him see that's just scripture all right is this the man all right i'm waiting for his now i want y'all to keep your seats be real reverent now this time through jesus christ's name i take this entire group of people under control under my control for the glory of god and every spirit in here to be subject to the holy spirit now what you're hearing is not a man or a preacher or just a prophet but what you're now hearing is a spokesman amen of the almighty god not just anybody saying anything amen but now this is a vindicated ordained anointed spokesman for the living god now hebrews 12 25 will say see that you refuse not him that speaker somebody say speaketh see that you refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spake on earth how much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven now that word speak affair actually means to articulate sounds amen or to declare one's mind by speech or sound so there's a fault and then there's an idea there's something that's in the mind amen but the only way to reveal what's in the mind is by a voice now you can have all kinds of faults here this morning amen but until there comes a voice to those thoughts amen then they're just salt but when there is a voice amen connected to the thoughts then it's no longer thought it is now a word manifested and do you see this morning amen that this message is not just a fault amen it's not just an idea it's not just something that some man come up with amen but this message is the thoughts of god they've been that was in the mind of god from before the foundation of the world amen the prophet said what is the bible he said it's the thoughts of god they've been dropped down to the earth and they were written by the prophets they meant to be expressed through the people see they've been then this morning we're hearing all kinds of sounds amen but unless there comes an articulation amen or a distinction of the sounds and it's a bunch of noise amen the prophet said see what you're hearing is the evening light sounds coming on he said what is the even light sound according to malachi 4 it's the message to restore the faith to the people amen the faith of the fathers to the children he meant a message now notice this malachi 4 god amen is going to sin somebody shout sinned and then god is going to send a prophet they've been noticed this and a true prophet is god sent not man made amen a true prophet that comes with a word it's not a man-made prophet a many is not a school made prophet amen but he is a god-sent prophet and god has kept his voice alive he been through the prophets you say what are you talking about bibraham says from eden he meant until now god has kept his voice alive he said but it's been through the prophets he said all the way back to abel he said when abel was silenced he meant god has raised up saith now i want you to catch this the prophet would stand there and say all the way from abel he meant unto now the voice of god has been speaking he said they tried to silence it in abel ain't been but he raised it up and said they tried to silence it itself and he raised it up in another generation he said see and even here this morning amen the same voice amen that was speaking in eden is the same voice that is speaking here this morning amen it's not a different voice it's not another voice the same voice amen that adam and eve heard in the garden is the same voice we are hearing this morning you say that what are you talking about i'm saying it is very important amen to believe on him that god sent to speak amen it is important to believe him that speaketh it is important to receive him that speaketh amen you say to receive him the prophet of god will show you amen that the works of god is believing on he whom god has sent amen they want to see the works of god want to manifest the works of god how do we manifest amen the works of god in this generation a prophet said it's by believing on he whom god has sent now i want you to catch this this morning amen he whom god has sent now in the dark ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people amen but god sent luther are you hearing me amen god sent luther with the word and the lutheran spoke for god at that time but they organized and again the pure word amen was lost for organization tends towards dogmas and creed and not simple word they could no longer speak for god then god sent wesley amen are you catching it god said luther he meant then god sent wesley amen and he was the voice with the word in his day and the people who took his revelation from god he met became the living epistles and then read and known of all men for their generation he said then when the methodist failed amen god raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until in this last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice amen to the final age amen are you seeing it god sent luther amen with the word and those that received luther's message amen become the voice in luther's day then god sent wesley with the word and those that receive wesley amen become god's voice in the day they lived in he said and that pattern has gone on until now amen in the last days he has sent another voice it's not the voice of a preacher it's not the voice of a kentucky prophet it is the voice of god that has been thundering down amen all the way from eden unto now listen church we are not here hearing from a man we are hearing from the son of man we are not here hearing from a preacher we are hearing from the voice of our bridegroom who is saying let all come oh there is a final voice amen there is a final age or you hear me this morning if there's a final voice if there's a final age amen then there's got to come a final people amen if there's a final voice if there's a final age if there's a final message if there's a final messenger then there's got to come a final people and i say this morning the final people is not coming amen the final people is here amen the prophet said see when you recognize your word he said then by the living word you become the written epistles amen read and known of whole men think of this he said you've got to get the living word in you to have the living god in you and that's something you got to have the living word in you to get the living god in you [Applause] they want his cord they want god but they don't want his word amen but if you're going to have god then you're going to have his word he said because the word here is god he said now watch when it's made flesh in you made spirit laugh in you when it goes into your flesh and your faith and becomes life then you are a living example see you are an epistle of god amen read of all men and you won't have it like christ not the fullness because it's divided upon the day of pentecost now let me drive this home for a second it is important amen to receive amen it is important to believe he that speaketh but can i add something else to it it is also important to obey him that speaketh amen it's one thing to receive him one thing to believe him one thing to hear him but it's another thing amen to obey the voice in exodus the 23rd chapter in exodus the 23rd chapter and the 20th verse the bible says behold i send an angel before thee amen to keep me in the way and to bring me into the place which i have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that i speak then i will be an enemy unto thine enemies amen and i will be an adversary unto thine adversaries from an angel shall go before thee amen and bring me into the amorites and the hittites and the parasites and the canaanites and the hives and the jebusites and i will cut them off notice this the angel is not behind them amen the angel is not beside them amen but the angel is before them amen as a sign that god does not send an angel amen to lead the church backwards amen but god sends an angel to lead the church forward now notice where he led them he led them right into the midst of their enemy he led them right into the heavens right into the amorites right into the canaanites and he said but if you'll follow that angel and obey his voice when you get in the middle of your enemy if you've obeyed the voice then you won't have to worry amen because i will take care of your enemy amen and i'll tell you this morning church let it be heard from the heavens let it be heard on the earth this morning there is a people who is not going to disobey amen the voice of the angel there is a people that is not going to turn their back on this message there is a pride and it's not going to turn around and begin to go back because we know amen without this message when we get in the middle of our enemy we're in trouble amen without this message when we're surrounded by sickness we're surrounded by depression we're surrounded by all kinds of troubles we are in trouble amen but with the voice of the angel he said i will come down and i will fight your battles and i will be an enemy to your enemies and i will be an adversary amen to your adversaries he said see then thou shall not bow down to their gods nor serve them nor do after their works but thou shalt utterly overthrow them and break down their images and you shall serve the lord your god and he shall bless thy bread and thy water and i somebody say i i will take sickness away from the midst of thee see there is a blessing in obeying the voice of the angel you say well brother andrew obedience is not very important my bible says to obey is better than sacrifice the prophet of god says obedience is the best he said see what does obedience do obedience unlocks the supernatural amen obedience unlocks the supernatural in genesis 22 and verse 18 and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed he meant because thou has obeyed my voice amen what brought the blessing upon the seat of abraham was not his intelligence was not his education was not his ministry was not signs and wonders amen but what brought the blessing upon the seat of abraham was that abraham obeyed amen the voice of god the prophet said what a promise he meant because of obedience obedience is what god wants he said it's once and obedience is better than sacrifice to obey the lord is better than any sacrifice that you could do to obey the lord is better than any sacrifice i could do you could do anybody can do to obey the lord is better than any sacrifice now the prophet of god says god had called moses and he didn't want to go amen those prophets had such things to do until it was a hard thing to do he said they didn't want to be going out and be scorned at they wanted to have fellowship and they wanted to go in with the rest of them and go along with the brothers i forget what profit it was that said i don't want to do this in other words but my whole heart will catch a fire because god has spoken and i must deliver it god has spoken and i must deliver it notice this he said whether they liked it where they crucified him whether they stone him whatever they did amen god has spoken his heart and he must say it now catch this not to be different but to be obedient amen not to be different but to be obedient he meant obedience is better than sacrifice then see it was in his heart and he must do it it was his life he couldn't hold it there was something there was a pulsation there was a pulsation that pushed him they could bless it or they could curse it but god had so much complete control of them till he was their voice he was their action now notice this he said give me a church amen that is so completely anointed with god till every action and move is the sayeth the lord and will walk in the shackling glory and i will show you a messiah which is an anointed one of god standing up on the earth now i want you to catch something here this morning the prophet said those men were not saying things they meant to be different they were saying things to be obedient can you imagine moses coming down with the ten commandments how different that was amen how how strange that was to the normal mind amen but moses didn't say that to be different he said it to be obedient can i preach a minute amen when noah come down and said it's time to build an ark he didn't say that to be different he said it to be obedient he meant listen and when a prophet come in 1965 and preached the message the rapture he said now go listen to it he said i'm not saying these things amen for prejudice i'm saying these things because the word of the lord must be declared you say then why was he saying was he saying third paul to be different was he saying theophany to be different was he said a third i mean a seventh peak to be different was he saying sunset mountain to be different was he saying a pillar of fire amen to be different i say no he was saying those things he meant because he wasn't in control of his own voice and then but there was another voice that had possessed the vessel of the seven angel and there was a pulsation there was a drive there was a fire and i say this morning that voice is not dead that voice is in the church this morning there is a pulsation of the holy ghost flowing through the building this morning not to be different but to be obedient not to be different i'm not preaching this message to be different i'm preaching it to be obedient amen amen come on church you all didn't start this church he meant to be different you started this church to be obedient amen because the voice that sounded in this age was more than a man it was more than a preacher it was the son of man it was jesus christ the mighty god unveiled in this generation we're not shouting to be different we're shouting to be obedient we're not screaming to be different we're rejoicing because we've been obedient to the voice [Applause] not to be different but to be obedient now there's going to be times you have to do things that makes you look different but don't worry about the criticism you're just being obedient [Applause] you say well you're just starting trouble no i'm just being obedient amen see amen there won't be nothing if you don't start nothing ain't it but if you start something there's gonna be something let me let me just preach here for a minute hey that you can talk about our house you can talk about our car you can talk about our clothes you can talk about anything you want to remember when you step on the message of the hour amen there's a fight that raises up in the heart of every bride member you know why not to be different but to be obedient see this is not about being different this message is about being obedient not to be different but to be obedient you see what it was it was the sign of god and the prophet said the signs of god are always overlooked now watch this one of god's signs is the coming of a prophet he said see the coming of a prophet is a sign that's overlooked by the people every time they overlook it he said but those who are elected to see it does see it amen those who are elected to see it they'll see it but the coming of a prophet was a sign that god is ready to speak when you see a prophet it's a sign that god is ready to speak because it ain't going to be speaking he said because if god ain't going to speak then the prophet wouldn't be on the earth if god didn't have something to say then the prophet wouldn't be on the earth he said now remember he wouldn't be on the earth unless god was ready to speak and the way he speaks is through those channels now how many will agree this morning that there is a sign there is a sign but then there is a voice amen there is a sign then there is a voice he said now the sign is given to get the attention of the audience amen to hear the voice amen see you can't stop at the sign and then you can't come as far as the sign amen but if you're going to go into the full blessing of the message if you're going to go into the untapped resources if you're going to break into the unseen where all things are possible you're going to have to go just beyond the sign into the voice the prophet said he wants an audience he wants somebody that's going to listen to what he is going to say the sign is an alert a meant to attract the attention of people that the word is getting ready to speak the sign is an alert to attract the attention of the people that the word somebody shout the word the word is getting ready to speak now let me say this many will see the sign but only the elected will hear the voice many will see the sign but only the elected will hear the voice many will see the first pull many will see the second pull even but the voice was not in the first pull amend the voice was not in the second pull the voice was in the third pull you say what is the voice the voice is the word and the prophet said what is the first pull it is healing what is the second pull it is prophecy what is the third pull it's the opening of the word the revealing of those divine mysteries are you hear me this morning church amen we are not here as a first pulled church we are not here as a second culture we are not a little bluegill we are not a little carp we are not a little bass we are a rainbow trout [Applause] we are a rainbow trout amen we have been caught by the voice are you hearing me when you hear the voice you can't unhear it when you hear the voice you cannot hear that voice awaken something on the inside of you you see what it awakened it awakened an announcement it's time for deliverance it's time to leave here it's time to go home it's time to turn northward we've compassed this mountain long enough now in exodus the third chapter god says i am come down to deliver israel amen but i'm sending you moses think about this the i am the god of gods the king of kings the lord of lords says i am coming down he meant to deliver i'm sending you moses see the prophet said notice i have come down but i'm sending thee he says what is it it's god going in the form of a man it's the voice of deliverance amen failed in the form of a man see what happened god sent moses hope it's okay god sent moses to call an exodus to the people he said see moses was an angel to call an exodus upon the people now how many believes this morning in angels the prophet of god will tell us that all bible believers believe in angels in exodus 23 verse 20 he said behold i sin are you catching this word i send an angel before thee to keep me in the way and to bring me to the place which i have prepared see god does not send an angel amen to lead you without having somewhere to take you god does not send a message ain't meant to catch your attention without there being some substance inside of the message you're hearing now notice this we could also say it like this behold i send a ministering spirit before thee to keep me in the way in matthew 18 10 the bible said that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven i want to read a few quotes here if that's okay see god always had ministering spirits i believe in them i believe in ministering spirits they've been sent from the presence of god the holy spirit ministers lead the church they are guardian angels that watch over us in another place you say well brother andrew only people have guarded angels is the prophet or is the pastor or is the ministry or is the deacon but the prophet said everyone has a guardian angel everyone has a guardian angel according to the scripture in the resurrection now before god sends a message to the earth god sends angels some time as messengers to the earth to bring the message to the people see do you believe that god has angels now i just want to take a few moments here and go through a few places in the bible where god had sent angels in genesis 16 7 the angel of the lord found hagar came in by a fountain of water and told her to return to syria and submit herself unto her hands notice this in genesis 19 15 the angels hastened lot saying arise and take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of this city and escape for thy life in genesis 22 11 the angel of the lord called unto abraham right before he slew isaac in first kings 19 5 there was an angel that was sent to elijah under a juniper tree and said unto him arise and eat there was an angel sent and that angel said arise and eat now the prophet said i want to pick out that angel here he is standing with the softest hands go over there don't you scare elijah you walk over and stroke his brow right easy i want the best cook among you go up there get all the vitamins you can find and put them in the cornmeal the world's turned him down but i'm going to treat him right that means hallelujah praise our god don't get scared of that amen bring forth the best that we got cook him a corn cake set him down some water and the soft-handed angel went over and stroked the little servant of god on the brown he said remember if you've done your best if you've done your best then god still got those angels in order he loves you just the same as he loved elijah now watch this in daniel 3 28 the bible says that god sent his angel to deliver the three hebrew boys that they would not give themselves over to the idolatry of the day in daniel 6 22 daniel testified that god has sent an angel and shut the lion's mouth that they would not hurt him in mark 1 13 jesus in the wilderness for 40 days was tempted of satan and afterwards the angels came and ministered unto him in luke 16 22 do you realize there's angels in birth there's angels in life but there's also angels in death the bible said the beggar named lazarus died and was carried by angels into abraham's bosom in acts 5 19 the angel of the lord by night opened prison doors to the apostles that they were thrown behind now this one's the one i love brother kanema is acts 27 23 and the angel of god stood before paul and warned him of the future no y'all didn't catch that an angel of god stood before paul and warned him of the future you know what that tells me brother stephen is the angel that's in the past the angel that's in the present has already been in your future [Applause] the angel that was in your past is the angel that's in your prison and that same angel has already seen your future [Applause] that's shout material right there brother amen the angel has already saw your future notice this the angel went in paul's future and said paul notice this here's paul in the present and here's the angel in the future and in the future he sees a shipwreck he sees him on the water 14 days with no compass with no light he sees him in a terrible condition but he goes back to the present and he says but listen paul there's going to be a shipwreck and there's going to be some hard days and there's going to be some upsets but there's going to be no life lost among you [Applause] there's going to be no life lost among you and paul could get in that ship and he could sail across the river he could sail across the ocean and when the storm began to raise paul didn't get nervous when the clouds began together paul didn't get nervous when the rain began to fall paul didn't get nervous when the wind began to blow paul didn't get nervous when the ship began to fall apart amen paul didn't get nervous you know why because god sent an angel with a message to say the ship is going to fall apart but you're gonna make it to the other side oh glory you're gonna make it to the other side you know what he also said he said there's gonna the ship's gonna fall apart this is what i love he said some on broken pieces and some on boards and some on the ship but they all made it safely to the other side can you all imagine the news reporters on the other side when the ship finally got there are y'all hearing me when the news reporter is on the other side when the fallen ship began to float up to the shore you imagine the news reporter standing there how are you mr paul he said doing just fine they said what's wrong with you paul you ought to be nervous he said i can't be they said you want to be tore all the pieces he said i can't be they said why he said because god sent an angel [Applause] can you imagine the news reporters down there you imagine i mean can i say it like this for for the sake of a number i'm going to say there was a hundred people on the ship okay i don't know just the sake of a number 100 people on the ship you imagine the news reporters looking at this chip coming in in broken pieces and people floating up on boards you imagine the news reporters stand there they got to start taking death count now there was a hundred people on this ship and paul looked at him and said listen that angel told me we're going to be shipwrecked but there'll be no life lost [Applause] there'll be no life lost there'll be no life lost you imagine the news reporter kind of laughed at paul and said he's beside himself maybe he had a pepper supper before he went to sleep maybe he had a bad dream but paul stood there and he began to say one amen two amen three amen 50 amen 60 there's 65 amen there's 70. there's 75. there's 85. where's 90. there's 95 that news reporter's eyes is about this big around they're going what are you talking about and he finally hit the number he said there is a hundred [Applause] what no one of them killed what the lifelong what are you saying brother i'm saying when the angel delivers a message the angel never lies it's the truth it's the word of god he'll bankrupt heaven before he lets one word fill his children oh brother what are you talking about i'm telling you the anointing of the holy ghost is on the angel to minister the word to you are you hearing me why amen why are you still here sis amen why are you still serving god brother why are you still on the front row in the house of god on sunday morning you know why because god sent an angel [Applause] that angel was in your past that angel was in your past that angel was in your presence but the reason why we're still here is because that angel went into our future and said listen church it was about six o'clock i was laying on the bed and i was translated beyond the curtain of time and i saw the wedding supper i saw millions there what did he say by the maurice he said i saw you there hey you know what some may leave but i'm not turning loose i'm not giving up i'm not turning around i heard the voice of the angel and he said we're going to the other side we're going to make it ain't no devil going to stop us i've heard i've heard the voice of the angel i'm not a crazy man i've heard his voice [Applause] he saw us there [Applause] oh what is it it's the voice of the angel been in your past in your present already been in your future [Applause] oh go ahead and praise him i said go ahead and praise him you know what you got a right to praise him this morning you say me yes sir cause the angel saw you there we saw the sign we saw the sign but we heard the voice [Applause] saw the sign but we heard the voice see the brother said what's the matter he said the spirit of god is here sent from the presence of god to anoint the speakers of the word that stays with the word and he confirms the word with signs following brings jesus the same yesterday today and forever how could we doubt he's both scientifically materially spiritually every way that he can be proved he's been proved he's proved here he said then what's the matter it's in our minds we open up our minds to the thing and say well now i don't know whether it could be or not maybe i'll feel better tomorrow that don't have one thing to do with it your feelings does not change the angel's message the conditions of your body does not change the angel's message are you hearing me amen amen the conditions of politics does not change the angel's message the condition of the white house does not change the angel's message it was true when he received it it's true when he preached it and we're here this morning declaring if it ever was the truth it's still the truth [Applause] oh my see there's angels and then look at some man said there's angels there's angels in this building there's angels in this room there's angels watching sister there's angels watching over you and me when we can't watch over ourselves there's angels in the car there's angels on the job there's angels in school there's angels in your home there's angels in this church there's angels in the hospital room there's angels in the doctor's office wherever the spirit of the lord is wherever the word is there is angels [Applause] the only reason you're here this morning is because there was an angel brother stephen brother stephen can i take some liberty here you celebrate andrew angels only keep us from hospital rooms and angels only keep us amen from car wrecks can i tell you something else angels do they keep you from being swallowed up in false doctrine [Applause] they keep you from being swallowed up amen by deceivers and seducers and evil false spirits [Applause] are y'all hear me angels amen stand my god i can't even preach this morning angels you realize what happens in a car wreck amen the devil wants to sniff your life out he wants to take your life and all of a sudden he gets you just about right and the devil says right there the wreck's gonna happen and i'm gonna take her but there's an angel there [Applause] there's an angel there there's an angel there and that angel you know what can i make it real to you can i preach this to you the prophet of god said moses was in a basket in a crocodile infested river in a crocodile in a crocodile infested river crocodiles here and crocodiles there looking for something to eat but the angel of the lord was surrounding that basket [Applause] every time brother kelly every time an old i know alligator come up and open up his mouth and say i'm going to eat moses there was an angel there there was an angel there that tapped him on the nose and said oh no did you hear me there was an angel there that tapped him on the nose and said oh no he's predestinated to believe this message [Applause] i feel like preaching here he's predestinated he meant to believe this i'm not a crazy man some of you this morning shouldn't be sitting here you shouldn't be here in your right mind you ought to be in some church following some personality but god who is rich in mercy sent an angel and that angel stood between you and a spirit of deception that angel stood between you and a false doctrine and said you can't have them take your hands off [Applause] and you don't want us to shout you don't want us to praise god brother maurice we should have been swallowed up we should have been sitting with binders on our eyes and chains on our heart but god who is rich in mercy sent an [Applause] angel [Applause] oh not all day angels watching over me my lord all day all [Applause] you're getting too carried away here no i'm not i'm preaching to you there were people there was other kids in the same waters that didn't escape the alligator's wrath but when it comes to the predestinated elected hands off hands off that's an anointed sign that's an anointed daughter there's a seal of god upon that life are you hearing me there is an anointing upon the elected to see the sign but to hear the voice now you you you may think people here get a little out of control because they're shouting and dancing rejoicing kind of i can't tell you what's actually happening probably said to meet one time and he said you wonder why he said i get excited he said there's he said there was a sister back in the church in jeffersonville she used to sing a song all night all day angels watching over me my lord he said now you have to he said if you notice me he said sometimes i have to take my hands and sit on them he said to keep from ruining the service imagine that a prophet of god sitting on his hands to keep from ruining the service he said the problem is when they get to singing about angels he said i have experienced it so they're not just singing a song to somebody that's pretty lyrics or pretty music but they were singing about angels watching over me all night and all day and the prophet said i had that kind of experience he said now you didn't think i acted like that did you he said you didn't think i act like that he said it's not me it's him doing it through me you mean it's jesus christ getting inside of a man causing him to have to sit on his hands to keep from worshipping to k alright now now don't don't go off in the left hill with that to keep from running the service he's sawing you here there's people around him that didn't understand why he was acting like that he said but the reason is i've experienced what they're singing about now do you see why just a minute ago there was such a release come in the building you realize why there was such an anointing begin to search because there was people here that has experienced the ministry of angels [Applause] so you can say i am a witness i know what he's talking about [Applause] you see ministering angels are sent to bring you to a prepared place now let me say this god has prepared a place of victory for every seed of abraham now let me say it like this the principle of obedience was established all the way back in the book of john the second chapter amen now you have to give me a little bit of liberty here because y'all's preaching me and i'm trying to get through this thought okay in john 2 verse 5 there was a wedding and they ran out of wine right when they when they they met when they ran out of the wine they didn't have nothing but water and his mother said in the servants whatsoever he saith unto you do it whatever he says unto you do it that's still good teaching today whatever he saith unto you do it if he tells you make ready for death you get ready if he tells you you're going to get well you believe it if he tells you that you're healed you are whatever he tells you he says to you do it to disbelieve it is a sin now now how many knows the problem of god amen if you could leave this monitor hard i'd appreciate it amen how many knows the father god said we've seen so much done now to disbelieve would be a sin now how many believes that god amen sends instructions thank you to an age amen to the angel messenger of that h see instructions to an age does not come to an evangelist does not come to the pastor let's not come to an apostle let's not come to a missionary the instructions to an age comes through a prophet which is a messenger now you realize what the messenger does the messenger has to deliver amen the messenger is under responsibility to deliver what he receives deliver what he receives in the book of first corinthians 15 verse 3 paul says for i delivered which means to give over into one's power use or to deliver verbally i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received that word received means not to withhold obedience are you hearing me not to withhold obedience seek to receive with the mind by the instruction of teachers so paul here is saying the spirit has delivered unto me amen a message are you with me and i am under responsibility to deliver to you what i receive then see what paul received he delivered and what he delivered those who received it was delivered by what he received [Applause] now the prophet said he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches now it may be amen amen if you can bring this down just a little bit just a little bit it may be that millions will hear these words or read them but how many will pay heed to them that we do not know but he who will lend his ear and want to know the words of truth will find the spirit of god enlightening him if your ear is open to the word the spirit of god will make the word real to you but you've got to lend your ear to the spirit you've got to lend your ear to the voice of instructions now see the only way to receive the things delivered of god is by the spirit of god for paul will say to be carnally minded is death in the message harvest time the prophet says now how could it be bread and word it would be puzzling to the human mind but we are hoping this morning that there is no carnal minds among us that there is a spiritual mind among us we're hoping there's no carnal minds among us we're hoping there is a spiritual mind among us see that we could understand what the father is trying to get to us here another place amen it's all a spiritual revealed truth that's right it's laying here it takes the spiritual mind to catch it that's right see right onto the day rest on that only the spiritual mind can catch it see now what it does is it seems that the spiritual mind though is becoming numb amen i hate to keep saying it but i'm gonna have to have something up here i'm losing my voice a little bit more seems the spiritual mind is becoming numb now how many here this morning is god a spiritual mind we've got a carnal mind we've got a natural mind we got a human mind but without a spiritual mind this service is in vain do you realize it's only the spiritual mind that can catch somebody say catch that can catch the word teachings of the day the human mind it goes over their head the human mind misses it the carnal mind misses it but the spiritual mind [Applause] not your intelligence not what your family give you through education but a spiritual gene seed to catch you say what are you talking about okay like this three seeds have been sown in this day there has been a denominational seed there has been a word or there's been a pentecostal seed and there's been a word seed do you realize no other mind can catch that but a spiritual mind [Music] [Applause] you go out here and you scream out there's been three seeds shown and people look at you like you're crazy but to you that has a spiritual mind you can catch the reality of what the spirit is doing in this age see it's like the bible says the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolish unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned now watch this how many has received the holy ghost aren't you glad you've got it he said over here now eating the oak eating the strong things of god and got a clear understanding your spiritual mind is all unmuddled your spiritual mind is all unmodeled now watch this he said you know you cannot understand it until it's revealed to you the whole thing is built upon spiritual revelations you've got to hear and then recognize and then act see then what is acting acting is obeying see it's revealed to some and not to others one man can read hebrews 13 8 and say jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and the carnal mind will say well in a way he is but the spiritual mind will say in every way he is the carnal mind will hear mark 16 and will say that was for the apostles but the spiritual mind will say he's the same yesterday today and forever into all the world and i'm a part of it are you hearing me i am a part of it see now i want to say like this david or rather daniel wrote in symbols and the natural human mind can read the symbols they're reading them this morning in denominations they're reading the symbols this morning and let me take a little liberty here and say the only reason why people that have left the message still claim to have a clear understanding is because they sat under the message long enough to get the benefit of understanding what can i preach a minute here amen but let me just say this without this message we are confused without this message this is still a book of symbols without this message it's still prophecy without this message it's just some fancy writings amen but with this message it's the reality of jesus christ it's the revealing of the symbols [Applause] in daniel 2 amen i hope i'm not taking too long in daniel 2 the bible said that old king saw us and behold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible this image's head was a fine gold his breast and his arms of silver his belly and his thighs of brass his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay his feet part of iron and part of clay thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands which smoked the image upon his feet that were iron and clay and break them to pieces now the prophet said did you notice right now at the last hour when we brought in this last great conference watch khrushchev and five nations of the east eisenhower the leader five nations of the west represented and the ten toes the image they would not mix and crucifer took his shoe off and beat it he said the spiritual mind would pick that up quick [Music] and that's something the spiritual mind would pick that up quick he said but see the reason they're not is because the spiritual mind is all muddled up see now notice this they will not mix now the next thing is the coming of the stone we've got brass we've got iron we've got clay we've got all these things without an understanding but when a prophet comes he brings an understanding to the ten toes amen to the iron to the clay then he brings a revelation to the stone and says the next thing is the coming of the stone he's going to send this angel to what church to sodom no to the lukewarm no he sent it to the elected called out church [Applause] what kind of a sign did he show the same thing he did last night god elohim manifested in the person of the holy ghost in his church oh my it should send us he said a million miles with shouts and praises of his glory now what is it the carnal mind misses it but the spiritual mind catches it the word of god always attracts the spiritual mind because it's the mind of christ in you now we've just opened up a beautiful channel there and i don't have time to preach all of it but i will say this it's not you catching these things it's the mind of christ in you catching what's being done in the generation you're living in see now watch this the carnal mind can catch the scientific advancements of the day right and the spiritual mind can catch the spiritual advancements of this day he says in the third exodus i hope the spiritual mind can catch it i'm sure you do amen but i wonder out there anyhow you can't visit every nation you can send tapes to it god will have some way to catch that mind out there where that seed is sowed and as soon as the light strikes it it's gone it takes life like the little woman at the well she said there it is see the woman at the well had been under expectation for the fulfillment of the prophet's words for some 400 years but one day [Applause] one day sitting at the well the prophet said it got in he said she said sir i perceive that you are a prophet see there was a sea lane there to come to life there was a switch that would turn on lot he said why she was looking for the manifestation of the word 400 years since malachi they had no prophets and here was a man that manifested to be a prophet and she said we know that when messiah cometh that's going to be wanting us he said i am he that speaks to you i am he that speaks to you now he can reveal himself she's already received him he's on the inside now see he can make himself known [Music] now can i say it like this when jesus went and sent by the well he didn't go there and sit there that morning hoping somebody would come by [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he was not sitting there hoping brother that was the sign that was the sign he was not sitting there hoping somebody would come by and catch the significance of him sitting at the well he knew he knew that that woman was coming by he knew the hour he knew the minute he knew the second he knew the day he knew the time she was coming by there was something in her to catch the significance [Applause] there was something in her to catch the significance of what he was doing are you hearing me now watch this god didn't send the marvelous acts into this age amen hoping somebody would catch the significance of it [Applause] is this okay the cloud over sunset mountain he didn't put that there hoping somebody would catch the significance of it the fish on the river he didn't put that there hoping somebody would catch the significance of it the sign in the hand was not there hoping somebody would catch it but he knew there was a gene seed that was sown that was going to see the sign but they were here [Applause] they would hear the voice are you hearing me listen church we are in the time we're just seeing the sign it's not enough we've got to here [Applause] oh 26 miles high in the shape of a pyramid are you with me 26 miles high in the shape of a pyramid hoping somebody would catch a significance oh no no sir when you saw it in the sky if listen the reason it was in the sky is because there was a people on the earth to receive the revelation of what was in the sky now are we going to stop there are we going to stop there no we've got to come to this day we've got to come to this hour we've got to come to this time and realize that jesus christ is not here in symbol form he's not here in theology he's not here in education he is here in the form of a message to receive the authority and vindication of that message [Applause] now amen i pray this is okay the only thing he could do said it at that well was be the message the only thing he could do was be in his place he could not fulfill her place she had a part to play he had a part to play he fulfilled his part now she has got to fulfill her part she has got to see her sign she's got to see the word she's got to receive the word she's got to believe the word and when she received it when she believed it then she obeyed it she obeyed it do you realize what obedience done obedience put her in to action obedience moved her from just another girl in gastonia north carolina obedience moved them from just another church in a hotel room with another pastor obedience amen moved her to be in the manifested word of her hour [Applause] are you all hearing me this morning now this is the beautiful beautiful part about it here's the beautiful part okay look at what she was before she met him look at what she was before she met him she was a harlot she had been married five times and the man she was living with was not even her husband she didn't have a good reputation she didn't have a good standing do you realize in that day in that day the custom of that day was every father told his child if you see a street walker or a harlan in the street and she tells you one thing you ignore her and you keep on walking you don't have to listen to her you don't have to give her the time of day you can walk right on by her she has no value can i say it like this she has no voice [Applause] she has no voice she has no authority over you she has no voice you ignore her but you know what my bible says my bible said after she met the messiah she dropped her water pot and she ran [Applause] she ran into the city and said come see a man [Applause] come see a man who told me everything i ever did come see a man who revealed the secrets of my heart come see a man who told me what are you saying my bible says after she met the messiah she ran into the city and said come see a man and the bible says and many and many believed on him because of her testimony [Applause] before she met the messiah she had no voice before she met the messiah she was just another girl with another life but after she met the messiah she become the final voice to the final age and i say this morning church you may have a restaurant you may have a wrecked uplift you may be sitting here this morning you may be sitting here this morning and no devil will listen to you no sickness will obey you no demon will leave your home god i tell you what'll change it come under come under the voice of the message of the hour it'll take you from a nobody oh oh mercy it'll take you from no voice to a voice it'll take you from no meal in the barrel to an abundance [Applause] [Music] now brother what are you saying i'm saying receive him believe him and obey him he told her drop the water pot and go what did he just do he just separated her from her past [Applause] in her present and introduced her to her future i feel like shouting separated her from her past introduced her to her future are y'all hearing me and what are you saying i'm saying william branham's ministry was not just the voice of a man it was the voice of god not to be different but to be obedient to claim a vessel on the earth can i take a few minutes here i'm trying to wrap it up amen but i feel like preaching here for a second the devil's fallen every way he couldn't this morning but he's defeated do you realize in one man's ministry in the ministry of william branham he could connect three realms in one in one ministry past present future past present future he could have a woman standing before him and say i see there's a trouble over your life here's what it is he was bit by a dog as a kid on the way home from school so he's standing okay standing in the present and goes back to her past and sees it as plain as day and says you're running home from school and you dr i believe he says you dropped your books and the dog you got bit by a dog he said and that's haunted you all your life so he went from the past to the present [Music] but then he left the present and went into the future and said but i see you well in the name of jesus christ [Applause] can i give you another one a woman standing before him with an intestinal trouble with a stomach problem and he says sister you've got a stomach problem he says here's what caused it i see you go into the past i see you coming down a set of steps and you fell on those steps and when you fell on those steps you ruptured something in your stomach and that's been messed up all these days here he is the present he says but now i see you and you're eating and you're well and you're happy now go rejoice it what was it brother maurice it was the sign with the voice it was the sign with the voice oh what are you saying preacher i'm saying when i want it brother it says if god sent the messenger and vindicated by the signs that he was a messenger sent from god then it's up to them to obey the messenger up to you to obey the messenger oh my amount of time moses was sent with a message right do you realize what happened moses received the message from the lord i'm not going to take time to read it but you can read it in exodus 12. the token eat it with your shoes on with your staff in your hand with the roasted on fire have you have you ever stopped it we just read that when i see the when i see the token i'll pass over you that's all we read but do you ever read how much instruction was given to it [Music] and moses received that from god delivered that verbally can i say it like this on about 1100 tapes to the congregation and they had to receive it now now just because they had the blood on the door just because they had the blood of the house didn't mean they received nose or moses message brother said to obey it was to apply the token can i give you another one look at noah building the ark have you ever have you ever stopped to read all the instructions was delivered to noah the cubits the room the length the depth the height what kind of wood to put in it how to pitch it within and pitch it without go get go for it have you ever read all that do you realize it works as faith expressed the prophet of god said and noah being a carpenter noah being a carpenter received the instructions from the lord now how many carpenters no offense how many carpenters do you know receives the blueprint to a house and don't automatically start trying to change something well we wanted this wide and this on well we can cut corner here and we can we can take that out and we can add this in here we can do this to make it cheaper try they start trying to trying to trying to change it do you realize the prophet said had noah changed one thing on that ark it would have sunk but he obeyed the instructions from the messenger he received them from and here's what i love the prophet said after 120 years brother stephen of working on that ark and building on that ark and building on that ark he said all of a sudden they climbed up in that ark he said god shut the door he said now listen he said now you might not known it but there was other boats he said there was other boats out there he said there was men that knew noah was a little off in the head but they thought you know what he may have some truth you know you know you the sign was good but when he went in the word he went off you know so that's what they always say as long as brethren was preaching heal all that was fine but he went the word he went awful actually when he went the word he went on and you went off free of charge but anyhow they said maybe there's something to what noah was saying maybe we should say they went down they built a baptist boat they went building a pentecostal boat then they got a methodist boat they got all kinds of boats they said because there just might be something to know his thoughts on the day when they went in the ark the prophet of god said noah's kids climbed up in the ark and said his daughter-in-law was looking out the window and she saw all them other boats and the sun was still there and she said daddy all them other boats are still out there he said don't worry and about that time rain began to fall he said it began to fall and he said for a little while them other boats was okay he said but after a while the water started coming down and the floods started coming up and he said little by little by little them other boats begin to sink they begin to sink they begin to go down he said but noah's family was inside resting because noah could look at his daughters and his son her daughter-in-laws and his sons and his wife and all the animals and say don't worry i built this boat according to the instructions of the angel that delivered them to me do you realize do you realize what happened brother kanema you realize what happened i'll tell you what happened noah's obedience brought a shalom to the entire family noah's obedience brought an entire family under a shalom well what are you saying i'm saying there's some people in the world today that don't know if they're boys and they don't know if they're girls there's some people in the world today that politics has fallen apart that the economy is dropping nations are breaking israel's awakened all kinds of things are happening people's popping nerve pills trying to get by but there is a bride on the earth that has heard the voice of the angel and the message has put a shalom put a shalom over the church the living god let the music players come this morning received [Applause] instructions do you realize a true messenger believes his own instructions before he delivers them [Applause] let me say this with everything within me noah was not building that ark hoping it was going to float them fathers that obeyed moses's message and applied the blood over the door the prophet god said they were sitting there reading the scrolls when the death angel come flying through the land claim it's a it's amazing thing to read he said the eldest son out there listening to screams of all their mamas and all them families down the road dying the death angel flying through the to the through the land that night he said but then within that little boy right out there and say daddy daddy i see him coming i see him coming out there daddy are are you sure are are you sure are you sure moses was a prophet are you sure moses message was vindicated he could just look at him and say shalom rest my son rest my daughter rest family what are you saying brother i'm saying this we claim to believe the message we claim we've received the message of malachi 4. i've y'all forgive me i've got a whole nother part here i didn't get to but let me just put it here together but have we obeyed the message [Music] we've claimed it's the truth we've taken a stand for it not to be different but to be obedient have we fully obeyed the voice of the angel as you rest yourself to your feet this morning he said andrew what are you saying i'm saying there's a burden on my heart like never before brother stephen to preach the authority and vindication of this message and the power behind it like never before i was in my office a couple days ago reading and studying praying a little bit and it come to me because it's actually happening right around the ranks of our message i know the history and what's going on here and the things while the church is hearing things but if the devil if the devil can't get you to deny the message if he can't get you to come right out and say william branham wasn't a prophet and the message isn't the truth the cloud was nothing but a whatever they say it was the pillar of fire is nothing if the devil can't get you to come out and just outright tonight then they'll come in and start saying well maybe brother brown didn't actually mean what he said maybe that was a passing comment maybe maybe brother adam was influenced by by the government and what things what was going on around him when he said some of those things maybe he didn't maybe he didn't mean it change one instruction and the boat goes to the bottom of the ocean [Applause] change one instruction and the death angel takes your oldest son out change one instruction and you're going to tribulation but andrew that's pretty strong i don't know how much stronger to say it change one thing the angel said and bypass the rapture bypass the coming of the lord somebody said well you don't you only say this because because you're just a preacher i say this because it's my life with everything within me i believe this message is there anybody here today can say lord i'm willing to fully obey you [Music] if a prop if a prophet said something and i don't understand it i'll still believe it i'll still obey it i'll still do it there's a man come to me one time brother stephen i was preaching about robin said something about you know men shouldn't wear shorts you know he got all tore up i want mercy that's kind of weird a guy get all torp because he can't wear a pair of shorts but anyhow i said brother that's what brother brown said he said that's brother branham's opinion i said wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute i said brother brown was vindicated right he said yes i believe that i said you believe the pillar of fire vindicated yes i believe that but that was his opinion i said well if he was a vindicated prophet and you think that was his opinion then i take it as a vindicated opinion is that okay i'm not going to the tribulation i'm going in the rapture i need an angel i need a god that when i come in the midst of my enemies he'll cut him off he'll destroy the heavens he'll destroy the amorites take sickness out of the midst of thee bless thy bread and thy water can we bow our hearts together this morning [Music] the voice this morning church is crying return return return to the word return to the word this morning how many can say i've seen the sign [Music] god bless you how many can say i believe the voice i was studying last night listen to the prophet of god ministry he said the sign see the sign but believe the voice and it dawned on me we some time ago had a move around the message leave the message called believe the sign reject the sign believe the sign and it just come to me they missed what a prophet said he didn't say just believe the sign he said see the sign but believe the voice let the voice influence your life let the voice change your heart so we bow our hearts together this morning would there be one here could say lord i hear you speaking to me i hear you speaking to me there's things in my life that the devil's trying to wear me down on but i hear you speaking to me this morning lord heavenly father lord all across this building this

the voice but they obeyed the voice lord because of obedience they had to make a stand lord not to be different but to be obedient because there were one of them this morning i believe the angel has done been in their future he's done seen what's prepared for him and god sent an angel to keep him in the way to lead him to the prepared place that he had prepared for him father i'm asking this morning may your mercy and may your grace may it overshadow this assembly today lord may it overshadow the hearts and lives of your children today father as abraham there that day obeyed your voice

parts they have to play lord i pray a blessing upon them dear god keep him father lord if they would come across things and that old devil would try to get him to change or try to back up and not say what a prophet said and well maybe brother brown didn't mean it that way and maybe it was a passing commenter he could have been influenced by this leader he could have been influenced by this thought oh god give him the courage to stand there and say if a prophet said it i believe it and that settles it i may not understand it i may not be able to make it all come together but i am not an understander i am not an i'm not a learner i'm not an educated believer i am simply a believer that believes god believes his word and believes his voice and all are the same this morning lord

struggle saying amen now you're going to say amen now you're going to be forced to say amen amen are you ready some scripture [Applause] are you ready oh a l l o scripture is given by what of who so everything that is written in this bible is inspired by god you believe it you believe it go to first corinthians chapter seven let's see if you're going to say amen now are you ready this was brother branham's opinion i'm now going to take it because it was brother branham's opinion let's see the bible if the bible have opinions are you ready hallelujah are you ready let's go to first corinthians chapter seven verse six you there you there but who who's that eye but i speak this by water and what do we have to follow this yes paul said that it's not a commandment of god it is paul's opinion [Applause] no it is paul's opinion don't take it it's paul's opinion paul said this is me paul speaking but it's not the commandment of god yet it is in the bible so since it's paul's opinion we don't have to believe it right but all scripture even the opinion of paul was inspired [Applause] do you want to take it away from the bible i thought you told me this entire bible is the word of god i thought everything that is written in the bible is the word of god paul said what he spoke here it is not a commandment it is him okay job to verse 10 and unto the merit i command yet not i but the what oh yes brother stephen this one is the lord we gotta take it okay this one is the lord paul said that one he was not the lord this is the lord which one are you going to take and which one are you going to be boys say this is god this is me yet in the bible and everything in the bible is inspired let me kill that black dog amen jump to verse 12. you ready to swallow this but to the rest speak who who's the i not who so why do we take it paul say this what i'm going to tell you now it is not god yet it is in the bible and every word every scripture the bible says it is what inspired was that paul's opinion you see how you get in trouble brother branham's opinion paul had his own opinion yet paul said this is not me this is god but this one is not god it is me and then he comes to timothy he say everything that i spoke even my opinion even what i told you it was not me it was all inspired there is no opinion of brother branham we focus your camera good we focus your camera good amen amen this is paul speaking how can you say this is paul who gave you the authority to reject it you told me this entire bible is god's word so why do you believe what paul say this is me paul this is not god why do you believe it and where do you come from saying to a vindicated prophet you say this is his opinion who told you who are you what authority do you have to point to me what is god's opinion and what is god not what is not god's opinion unauthenticated prophet of god who are you obey the voice of the angel that's all amen paul say i believe it is his opinion that's not my problem amen you don't understand that just say amen and keep moving the holy spirit will bring somebody here and they're going to explain it i can show you stories brother branham is speaking about and then i can sit with you and begin to prove things from that story and you'll be amazed and what i'm pulling from that story is in the bible a prophet is a son amen the life this bible is written as the life of abraham abraham journey they're right abraham was eating the rod abraham was cooking the wrong that's your bible when they say brother branham say i was coming this morning i saw my wife i shook her hand why do you have a problem with that and you read abraham you read isaac playing with his wife he's waiting here when brother born i'm saying my kids are coming i hug them it's a problem amen you have a problem with this you're gonna have a problem with the message that's why if you have a problem with the message you don't really believe your bible because it's the same pattern the message came from the bible amen just obey the voice of the angel period it is not up to you to figure out somebody asked me a question they said brother stephen when you bought your house you stated that you went there and you put your foot there do i have to put my foot there too i'm paraphrasing or i can just claim what i need i say brother you don't put god i'm just paraphrasing in a box amen your responsibility is to read the bible and to listen to the tape and you put your car in neutral amen when trouble comes when something arrives in your life you will feel in your mind like a scripture is coming up do you understand me when you feel like a scripture is coming back to your memory it is not you it is the holy spirit handing you the bullet do you want me to help you do you want me to help you do you want me to help you when you are in your job in your interview when you go into trouble if you feel like a spirit like a scripture is coming to your mind it is not you it is the holy spirit telling you for this case this is the scripture you need to use sometimes that scripture look contradictory to what you facing it is up to you to obey the engine just take the bullet and shoot it amen don't even think because you have this is the reason why people fail in their christian work amen you don't raise yourself up and go to the tomb and say the bible says this i resurrect the dead that's not what jesus said jesus said i do nothing nothing except water amen that's the reason why jesus never failed amen when jesus was going to lazarese he was not thinking or having faith he's going to raise lazarus he already saw it amen when he was sitting by the well amen he was not hoping that woman will come he said i mean i have need to go back that way in other words the father said go to the right he just what the glory say he sat there and that was it everybody clear everybody clear so don't when you continue to feed on the bible you're going to have a lot of scripture but when something rises you will feel like a scripture is coming back to you that is the bullet the holy spirit is giving you a woman who was in trouble her son was dying and suddenly a scripture came back like there was a widow woman and there was elijah and this is me this is my case she looked she said where is elijah she pray god show her brother branham she was not waiting for brother brown i'm hoping he's coming she was there early in the morning he said i was waiting for you right here that is the realm of perfect faith he does not miss amen calm down in your life when trouble is going go back to a quiet place don't be aware everything is frustrated or people are crying and screaming that's why jesus get into a place he get everybody who's crying there get them out get them out get them out let me quiet i need to catch the mind amen sometime lay hand on the sick sometimes don't lay hands on the sticks just speak sometimes elisha have to climb on the body where's the scripture for it the woman that had the blood issue have no scripture that says touch the helm of the government and she's going to be here an inspiration was dropping that time like you have a difficulty you are not too strong there is a lot of people there and suddenly something showed her a little him floating with the air he said go get the ham if she would have stop and say huh the ham there's no scripture that says there's no hymn obey the angel she just goes there and when she touch what happened the one who was driving the chariot stop say who touched me how many people were touching jesus do you know what jesus called that he said your faith that touch is a faith it is a manifestation of the divine instruction from god amen when something happened at work something happened in school quiet down your nerve you're gonna feel a scripture popping up like i am the lord who heals you from all the diseases get that scripture load it in the gun don't think just shoot it the way it is you want to see what's going to happen that's why brother branham said everything god leads your soul to believe it belongs to what to you so you cannot be sitting in your in your house and suddenly you just sit you say why is me sitting in a beautiful house and the ark of the lord is sitting there do you think he was david somebody just dropped it out and david called it wait a minute i'm sitting in this apartment too long and i have a lot of trouble is not there a way we can get a house brother when that come just get that thing ready don't let it go somebody just gave you a bullet i'm sick and tired of this job i believe that one of this day i can have a job where i'm free to go to church get that bullet don't let it go load it and shoot it when you wake up you say god thank you for giving me a good job amen learn to understand the voice of the angel and obey the voice of the angel let's stand up hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for your love for your mercy for your word and the deliverance that you brought again this morning to this church lord father certainly there is no way a message can

continue lord father soaring to meet you one of this day into the air father thank you for the spiritual food that you brought this morning and thank you for your manservant that you use lord to yield himself completely out of the way lord and father deliver exactly what you have need for this church lord father may you strengthen your children may you touch them when you touch those that are sick
