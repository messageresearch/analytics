[23:01] on our hearts as we
[23:03] you know receive the word as a group
[23:05] singing
[23:07] i don't have any praise reports but i
[23:09] would like to i'd like to give one i
[23:11] spent some time yesterday
[23:13] with brother david over at the new
[23:15] church building
[23:16] we were trying to finish up running some
[23:18] of the wires and i know there were
[23:20] several out there thursday um the pastor
[23:22] would like to um
[23:25] he you know everybody wants to thank
[23:27] thank everybody for their sacrifice to
[23:29] come over and do stuff
[23:30] it looks really good you know the
[23:32] picture i don't know if
[23:33] was everybody seeing a picture of the
[23:35] outside it kind of looked white
[23:37] and almost looked like blue trim in the
[23:38] picture but it's a very nice beige color
[23:41] with black trim
[23:42] the inside the ceilings are all painted
[23:45] and
[23:45] you know i guess we got very close to
[23:47] running all of the last of the wires i
[23:49] think
[23:50] um so it's steadily moving on the the
[23:53] the walls are almost completely um
[23:55] prepared for the drywall right
[23:58] tomorrow good so
[24:01] i got i got in there brother david was
[24:03] he was up in the ceiling somewhere and i
[24:04] stood
[24:05] looking from where the sound booth is
[24:07] going to be out towards the pulpit
[24:09] and i started thinking about the
[24:12] construction of solomon's temple
[24:14] and i was thinking you know wonder what
[24:15] the people were thinking when it was in
[24:17] about the same uh same
[24:20] point of you know as our church is you
[24:23] know
[24:23] and i started thinking and uh i got a
[24:25] little bit overwhelmed
[24:27] and i actually started crying a little
[24:29] bit i felt the presence of god already
[24:31] there
[24:31] so i believe he's waiting on us you know
[24:33] i mean he's already there he's just
[24:35] waiting on us
[24:36] so um it's very exciting
[24:39] you know just and we may never have a
[24:42] service in it
[24:44] the good lord could come you know before
[24:46] then and that's fine
[24:47] that's fine i just want to go when he
[24:50] does come
[24:51] amen i want to do my best till then um
[24:54] also before i before i ask anybody if
[24:56] they've got a prayer request for a
[24:57] praise report
[24:58] the purple box with the balloon on it
[25:00] back at the back is for the questions
[25:02] for the family meeting we're going to
[25:03] have it at my house we're looking
[25:05] forward to it
[25:07] it's not exactly a perfect house but we
[25:10] like it
[25:11] you're all welcome there i don't think
[25:12] anybody that's ever been there has had a
[25:14] had a spirit of unwelcome we open our
[25:17] doors
[25:17] and uh you know so we want everybody to
[25:20] come
[25:21] we'll find room if we have to eat in the
[25:24] yard okay
[25:25] it doesn't matter we just want you there
[25:28] we want the fellowship because it's been
[25:29] a while
[25:30] we want the questions because this is
[25:32] for our youth i've put one in the box
[25:35] so we're going to have a good time
[25:38] now does anybody else have a praise
[25:40] report yes ma'am i'm gonna give you the
[25:41] microphone
[25:46] i want to take this opportunity to give
[25:49] god thanks
[25:50] praise
[25:53] two weeks ago when i sang
[25:58] and the anointing phil
[26:02] i i got up this morning and
[26:05] that morning and i was i was doing my
[26:08] bills and
[26:09] putting what for the building fund and
[26:11] offering and everything
[26:13] and that morning i said i'm checking
[26:16] everything up and i'm like i have to pay
[26:18] this bill i have to be that bill and the
[26:20] lord say give x amount
[26:22] but give x amount would put me behind so
[26:25] i said lord i'm going to take you at
[26:27] your word
[26:28] and you want me to put x amount i'll put
[26:30] it
[26:32] i said i'm believing for a blessing but
[26:34] i'm looking financially
[26:36] and i said lord i know you will provide
[26:39] and then
[26:40] you know he put on my heart
[26:45] to sing i have a source and it's a song
[26:48] from
[26:48] brother biscuit church and as i said
[26:50] that song has been a blessing to me
[26:53] during the coffee times and i decide
[26:55] okay i'll sing it
[26:57] but i didn't practice it so we were
[26:59] practicing i was singing it in the car
[27:00] and
[27:01] girls join in with me and that's how we
[27:03] end up singing together but
[27:06] nowhere in my heart i was expecting a
[27:08] spiritual blessing
[27:10] i was looking for a natural blessing so
[27:12] this is where the fight
[27:14] came in and for the last two weeks the
[27:17] devil has just been battling me telling
[27:20] me that
[27:21] you're not worthy i look at you you're
[27:24] nothing
[27:25] you make mistakes per stephen was wrong
[27:29] and whole and negative and it's just
[27:32] been
[27:34] so much that it was just overwhelming
[27:36] and
[27:38] said you're a hypocrite you're nothing
[27:41] so this morning when i got up
[27:45] i said lord jesus i'm gonna
[27:48] take everything and put it aside and i'm
[27:50] gonna walk
[27:53] you may use me one time and never again
[27:55] and that's it
[27:56] but if you this is your will let me
[27:59] sanctify my life
[28:01] i know it's not of works unless any man
[28:04] should boast
[28:05] but lord i'm putting me aside
[28:09] and whatever you want to do i got up
[28:12] early and i'm
[28:13] getting ready for church and everything
[28:15] just keep falling behind and i say why
[28:17] can't i leave this house you know
[28:20] eventually i was able to leave and i
[28:22] thank the lord and you know i got up i
[28:23] was
[28:24] listening to wednesday night sermon and
[28:26] getting in the spirit and everything and
[28:28] then i walked into victory's mind so it
[28:30] was like
[28:32] i thank god for giving me the victory
[28:35] i thank god for the song that follow
[28:37] created me a new heart
[28:39] and i just thank god for the worship and
[28:42] you know for placing me
[28:44] where he has placed me because
[28:47] it's it's just so you know sometimes you
[28:49] think oh this person testifies so much
[28:51] but it's
[28:52] just that every single time you feel
[28:54] down
[28:55] he give you exactly what you need to
[28:57] just lift you up
[28:59] and i just thank god for the ministry we
[29:01] were on we are under
[29:03] for the word you know we see the songs
[29:05] lining up we see the testimonies lining
[29:07] up we see the special lining up
[29:09] you know we see the the in front
[29:11] everything just falling in line and
[29:13] all i can do is just throw up my hands
[29:15] and say thank you jesus
[29:17] [Applause]
[29:19] hallelujah
[29:23] now one first of all says you know the
[29:26] devil's a liar so if he's attacking you
[29:27] he's telling you lies
[29:29] amen and he wouldn't lie to you like
[29:31] that unless he knew you were one of
[29:32] god's children
[29:33] he's trying to convince you that you're
[29:35] not so
[29:36] don't listen to him sing a song for
[29:39] jesus
[29:40] when that happens just start singing now
[29:43] um you didn't mention one thing that
[29:45] you're
[29:46] you are actually or were a part of
[29:49] you you mentioned all these things but
[29:51] she didn't mention
[29:52] the gifts coming into the church it
[29:55] he used you about two weeks ago with the
[29:59] gift of knowledge that you had no
[30:00] knowledge of that our pastor had
[30:02] received his healing before you came up
[30:04] and sang that song
[30:05] and if you go back and watch she just
[30:07] stops in the middle of the song and goes
[30:10] not brother stephen because it wasn't
[30:11] her talking
[30:13] it was god through her and he says she
[30:15] said stephen you are healed
[30:17] and then she the anointing got on her so
[30:19] much that she was just and then it just
[30:21] it stopped and she started singing again
[30:24] so the gifts are coming into this
[30:26] church we we each listen we each get

[42:30] jones porter on the 17th

[42:49] if you didn't you got to hang tight
[42:51] thank you very much the musician
[42:53] for everything and good to see you
[42:54] brother said helping
[42:57] with the keyboard god richly bless you
[43:00] amen let's go straight to the scripture
[43:05] on wednesday we explain to you a
[43:08] big key in the message
[43:12] because we were going through some of
[43:14] the avenue of the black dog
[43:16] touching this touching makeup
[43:19] touching eye paint and before i get into
[43:22] the high heel
[43:23] and everything else and somebody turn
[43:25] around and say like we
[43:26] back again to these legalistic stuff
[43:31] so we gotta give you a key you
[43:33] understand it's not about legalistic
[43:35] stuff
[43:36] it is nothing but the grace of god
[43:39] separating you
[43:41] from the work of the heathen amen
[43:45] if you take it like legalistic then you
[43:47] get trouble
[43:48] then it's going to be like do's and
[43:50] don'ts and one of this day you say we
[43:52] were in
[43:53] bondage in the message you were not in
[43:55] bondage you just missed the key
[43:58] amen every single nation upon the
[44:01] planet earth including the jews were
[44:04] all pagan they were gentile
[44:08] abraham was a hidden a heathen another
[44:12] worshiper
[44:15] amen and paul the great apostle came
[44:18] and condemned the gentile condemn the
[44:22] jews and put both of them on the same
[44:25] level amen telling you that we all
[44:28] sin and came short of the glory of god
[44:32] so nobody should boast amen
[44:35] so what i did to the jewish people i'm
[44:38] just doing the same thing to the
[44:40] gentiles
[44:41] amen showing you that i just use a jews
[44:44] as a door
[44:46] amen when boaz was redeeming naomi boaz
[44:51] was not thinking about marrying naomi
[44:54] boaz was thinking about marrying roof
[44:58] but to get roof you got you you must
[45:00] pass through naomi
[45:02] so to get the gentile you're going
[45:04] through israel
[45:06] but the very purpose of god is not
[45:08] really the jews
[45:10] it's a gentile brother because the jews
[45:13] themselves were also
[45:14] gentile so now out of every kindred
[45:18] every nation every tongue he begin to
[45:21] pull his children out
[45:23] amen so it's not about legalistic
[45:26] it's not about putting you under the law
[45:28] because the law failed
[45:30] amen it's about god separating you
[45:34] from hiddenness that's the key you get
[45:38] it
[45:38] then everything else won't be a problem
[45:40] amen
[45:41] you get the god of variety and then
[45:44] everything else won't be a problem every
[45:46] coat
[45:47] they can bring you about mixed marriages
[45:49] will never trouble you
[45:50] if you understand the god of variety he
[45:53] wants you to be the way you are
[45:55] the way he created you stay in your
[45:58] category
[45:59] and if you want to get married get
[46:01] married in your category
[46:03] [Applause]
[46:05] because when you get married in your
[46:06] category you continue to preserve what
[46:10] he started
[46:11] so it's not about being racist it is the
[46:14] god of variety
[46:16] [Music]
[46:17] amen if you understand that key
[46:21] no no i don't see any any quote you can
[46:24] bring it to me
[46:26] amen and brother branham keeps saying we
[46:29] are like a bouquet
[46:31] we are like a bouquet we don't want to
[46:33] mix marriages
[46:34] he keeps saying that and people miss it
[46:37] because the country was already infected
[46:40] by racial spirit
[46:42] amanda instead of understanding i
[46:44] created you black i want you black
[46:47] i created you white i want you white i
[46:50] want you to stay that way
[46:52] stay in that category love it cherish it
[46:55] are creating you asians stay like that
[46:58] it is not that i'm separating you no
[47:05] i can say a certain statement here but
[47:07] it's going to go
[47:09] people on amen
[47:13] amen i keep it for the local church
[47:16] amen bring me any quote
[47:20] any quote i'm going to show you it all
[47:23] line up with
[47:24] the god of variety your prophet is
[47:27] perfectly in line with the scripture you
[47:29] miss that key
[47:30] oh why we don't want god to marry white
[47:33] people why we don't want to marry
[47:35] hispanic it's not a problem go back to
[47:38] the mind of god
[47:40] look if he wanted you to be black he
[47:42] would have created your wife
[47:47] if he wants you african he would have
[47:49] created you in africa
[47:52] if he wanted you european you're going
[47:54] to be born in europe
[47:56] [Music]
[47:58] just accept it be proud of it
[48:02] be happy the god of variety
[48:06] you don't understand that you're going
[48:07] to have trouble in heaven
[48:10] because when you get in heaven you're
[48:11] going to see african you want to see
[48:13] white people
[48:14] black people asian hispanic what are you
[48:16] going to do
[48:19] what are you going to do there won't be
[48:21] any other world
[48:24] the only other place will be held
[48:27] but even in hell it's mixed
[48:35] heaven mixed hell mixed where are you
[48:38] gonna go
[48:40] troubling yourself for nothing
[48:44] put your car in your chair
[48:48] amen let's go to exodus chapter 19
[48:54] that's why people miss the prophet
[48:57] and they got in trouble and later on
[49:00] you're going to hold on hold on hold on
[49:02] hold on
[49:02] one day you bastard you can't take it
[49:04] anymore
[49:05] oh i leave the message we were in
[49:08] bondage no you're going back to heaven
[49:14] you're going back to hedonism
[49:17] hang tight you're going to see what's
[49:19] going on exodus chapter 19
[49:22] verse 4 if you dare you can say amen
[49:26] hallelujah you have sinned
[49:30] what i did to
[49:33] the egyptian i love to preach like that
[49:37] amen to the egyptian
[49:40] amen and how i
[49:43] bore you in other words i carried you
[49:47] on eagle water
[49:50] when israel was coming out of egypt how
[49:53] many seeing an ego
[49:58] can an ego carry two million of people
[50:01] in their wings
[50:05] not even one probably maybe two three
[50:07] the ego will be already heavy
[50:10] so where was the wing of the ego
[50:13] you need a prophet
[50:16] amen when god brought israel out
[50:21] he gave them a try as a nation
[50:24] he plugged them up in egypt amongst the
[50:28] water
[50:29] unbelievers and brought them in his
[50:33] tender care
[50:34] on the wings of the water come on
[50:38] that great water come on what is his
[50:41] name
[50:44] amigo is a professor
[50:48] i carry you under the wings of an eagle
[50:51] means i carry you under a prophetic
[50:55] ministry i use a prophet to carry you
[51:00] out of
[51:00] egypt all the way to the promised land
[51:03] it is not a burden
[51:07] amen hallelujah
[51:13] verse 4 i bore you on the ego's wings
[51:17] which was moses that great prophet and
[51:20] brought you to water
[51:22] so even though god use a powerful
[51:25] ministry
[51:26] you might be seated the purpose of that
[51:29] ministry
[51:30] is not to bring the people to the
[51:33] prophet
[51:35] that's why brother branham said under no
[51:38] circumstances
[51:39] did i have a ministry to bring the
[51:41] people unto me
[51:43] but i use a prophet to unite
[51:46] you with me it takes a prophet to bring
[51:50] you
[51:50] unto me if you want to be united with
[51:53] god you need a prophet
[51:56] because a prophet is the one that marry
[51:59] you to the king
[52:01] he is the officer that officiated the
[52:05] marriage
[52:08] why he didn't go himself and then god
[52:10] pick israel
[52:11] and say get married to me he said moses
[52:14] you take off your shoe
[52:17] let me borrow your shoe
[52:23] amen when you look sometimes you say is
[52:26] this moses or is it who
[52:28] is this moses or is it no it's just
[52:30] moses
[52:31] i'm just using him to bring you to me
[52:36] how do you want to get married without a
[52:38] prophet
[52:40] i'm going to the marriage supper you
[52:41] need a prophetic ministry
[52:44] amen now therefore verse 5
[52:49] if you will obey my voice indeed
[52:52] and keep my covenant then you shall be a
[52:55] water
[52:57] a peculiar a special people
[53:00] this promise was given to israel
[53:04] not gentile if they obey they're going
[53:07] to be a peculiar
[53:09] or a special people
[53:12] who everybody want to be like israelite
[53:15] we want to be special
[53:16] in the eyes of god a peculiar water
[53:20] not only just are you peculiar are you
[53:23] special
[53:24] but a peculiar treasure
[53:30] whoa you want to be the treasure of god
[53:34] to me above water all the people in
[53:38] other words
[53:39] all the earth was under hidden is
[53:43] god pick up the jews get them out and
[53:46] elevate
[53:47] them above everybody as a peculiar
[53:50] and all special treasure blessed be the
[53:54] name of the lord
[53:56] for all the earth israel is mine
[54:00] amen verse 6 and you shall be to me a
[54:04] water
[54:05] a kingdom of priest
[54:09] not only are you a peculiar people
[54:12] but you become a kingdom a kingdom of
[54:16] water
[54:17] so everybody in that kingdom is a priest
[54:30] oh my god a holy
[54:34] holiness holiness a holy
[54:37] nation in other words a nation that is
[54:40] different
[54:41] than any kind of nation upon the first
[54:45] earth
[54:46] remember on wednesday you remember on
[54:48] wednesday
[54:49] when balaam looked at israel he says
[54:52] when i look
[54:53] at the at the map of the nation of the
[54:56] earth
[54:57] when i look at israel spiritually i
[55:00] don't see them
[55:01] in the earthly map they are not
[55:04] reckoners among the nation
[55:10] but if you go you're going to see a
[55:12] country israel
[55:13] you're going to see a natural people
[55:15] israel you're going to see them with
[55:17] a with a king but when you look at them
[55:20] spiritually you don't see them
[55:23] amen every kingdom
[55:26] under the dominion of the devil
[55:31] that's why in matthew 4 the devil told
[55:34] jesus christ look at all the kingdom
[55:37] i will give it to you if you bow down to
[55:39] me but when they look at israel he's
[55:42] missing on the map
[55:43] of the devil
[55:49] i am just using the jew to
[55:52] show you an example a sample
[55:55] of what i want to do when i pull you
[55:58] from the gentile
[56:00] there is no way that from hell
[56:06] there is no red dot from hell that can
[56:09] detect you
[56:11] when hell zero down to your house it's
[56:14] blur
[56:15] block block
[56:18] they can zero your neighbor they can
[56:21] zero their neighbor
[56:22] they can zero damage but when they're
[56:25] there for when demon
[56:27] crosses your neighborhood when they come
[56:30] close to your house
[56:31] the gps is lost
[56:33] [Music]
[56:34] [Applause]
[56:37] hallelujah the gps signal
[56:40] is lost amen and they get a warning

[1:10:27] black dog genesis
[1:10:30] 2 verse 9 and in genesis 3
[1:10:34] verse 6 and 7 the bible says that
[1:10:39] out of the ground made the lord god to
[1:10:43] grow
[1:10:44] every tree that is water
[1:10:47] so from the garden of eden
[1:10:50] every tree that was in the garden of
[1:10:53] eden was pleasant
[1:10:56] everybody follow me and he was present
[1:10:59] to the site because god is the one that
[1:11:01] created it
[1:11:02] and he was also water good for food
[1:11:08] every single tree
[1:11:12] including the fig tree
[1:11:18] hallelujah amen
[1:11:21] the tree of life also in the midst of
[1:11:25] the garden
[1:11:26] and the tree of the knowledge of good
[1:11:28] and evil
[1:11:30] out of every single tree there was only
[1:11:33] one tree that god forbid men to eat
[1:11:38] that was the tree of the knowledge of
[1:11:40] water
[1:11:42] good and evil every other tree are
[1:11:45] either born or commenstable you can eat
[1:11:48] as you want
[1:11:50] verse 16 and the lord god commanded the
[1:11:53] man
[1:11:54] saying of every tree
[1:11:57] only the exception of the tree of the
[1:11:59] knowledge of good of evil
[1:12:01] of every tree of the garden you may
[1:12:04] eat water freely is given to
[1:12:08] you now in genesis
[1:12:11] chapter 3 verse 7 6 and 7 and when the
[1:12:14] woman saw that the tree was good for
[1:12:17] food
[1:12:18] and that he was pleasant to the eyes
[1:12:22] the eyes of god the eyes of who
[1:12:26] the woman okay and the tree to be
[1:12:28] desired in other words
[1:12:30] a tree that causes lust
[1:12:34] to make one wise we already seen the two
[1:12:37] wisdom on wednesday
[1:12:39] she took off the fruit thereof and did
[1:12:42] eat
[1:12:43] and gave also on to her husband with her
[1:12:46] and he did it both of them ate the
[1:12:48] forbidden fruit
[1:12:50] and the eyes of both of them were water
[1:12:54] so that tree opened or
[1:12:58] removed the holy veil that god put upon
[1:13:01] them
[1:13:02] and when the holy veil was removed
[1:13:05] they only became conscious of their
[1:13:08] nakedness
[1:13:12] they were not conscious because they
[1:13:14] were tall
[1:13:16] they were not conscious because their
[1:13:18] texture
[1:13:19] was white or black or asian
[1:13:22] they only became conscious of something
[1:13:26] nakedness and they knew that they were
[1:13:29] naked that's why this fruit brought to
[1:13:32] them
[1:13:34] and they saw fig leaves
[1:13:38] so there is a tree in the garden of eden
[1:13:42] called the fig tree that tree
[1:13:45] had leaves
[1:13:48] and that tree also has fruit
[1:13:51] are you following me god told them
[1:13:55] that every tree is pleasant
[1:13:58] good for food you can eat that freely
[1:14:02] god gave them permission to use the
[1:14:05] fruit
[1:14:06] not the leaves
[1:14:10] hallelujah and they used the
[1:14:14] fig leaves they saw fig leaves together
[1:14:18] and made themselves welcome so by the
[1:14:22] knowledge the earthly knowledge the
[1:14:24] perverted knowledge of the devil
[1:14:28] ever clear they used that perverted
[1:14:31] wisdom
[1:14:32] and that perverted wisdom taught them to
[1:14:35] use their leaves of
[1:14:36] a tree and to make unto them
[1:14:40] apron which is temporarily because the
[1:14:44] leaves are going to be green
[1:14:46] and sooner they're going to dry up which
[1:14:48] is the top of your fashion
[1:14:50] that comes and go everybody clear so far
[1:14:53] let's go to ezekiel chapter 16
[1:14:57] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:15:00] lord
[1:15:03] amen oh my god
[1:15:08] ezekiel chapter 16. everybody there
[1:15:11] few people
[1:15:15] everybody there verse 3 and say
[1:15:18] that says the lord god to who
[1:15:21] jerusalem your birth and your nativity
[1:15:26] is of the land of canaan your father
[1:15:29] is an amorite he's an amorite
[1:15:32] jew thank you and your mother
[1:15:35] is a high title is a high-tatted jew
[1:15:40] so the birth of jerusalem here is
[1:15:43] talking of a birth of a gentile
[1:15:48] a hidden
[1:15:52] not a jew like the way you feel
[1:15:54] everybody clear
[1:15:56] job to verse uh eight now when i
[1:16:00] pass by you and look upon you
[1:16:03] behold your time was the time of love
[1:16:07] america in the garden of eden
[1:16:11] the tree of the knowledge of good and
[1:16:14] evil
[1:16:14] opened the eyes of them to be conscious
[1:16:18] of
[1:16:18] their nakedness and the opening of the
[1:16:22] eyes
[1:16:23] brought their consciousness not to your
[1:16:27] heart
[1:16:28] but the consciousness to your nakedness
[1:16:32] so when your eyes become open
[1:16:35] or when the black dog is released in
[1:16:39] your life
[1:16:40] it will begin to tempt you in your outer
[1:16:45] upper appearance
[1:16:49] are you following me now here

[1:16:55] birth you know clearly that it's puberty
[1:16:58] which is the time of love when your time
[1:17:01] of love was come
[1:17:03] and i spread my skirt over you and i
[1:17:06] cover your nakedness and i saw to you
[1:17:10] yeah i saw it to you and enter into a
[1:17:13] covenant with you we already explained
[1:17:14] this
[1:17:15] say the lord and you became mine
[1:17:18] verse 9 then i did water
[1:17:23] when the time of puberty came
[1:17:27] god began to get concerned
[1:17:30] about the proper care of this woman
[1:17:35] all their home care
[1:17:39] amen we already explained to you
[1:17:43] check your your bathroom check your
[1:17:46] living room if it's still dirty we need
[1:17:49] to call me so we can cast that devil
[1:17:53] amen because the preaching of the word
[1:17:56] come
[1:17:57] to cast that devil if it didn't work
[1:17:59] then we got to go manual
[1:18:01] you're not automatic we got to put you

[1:18:08] with water yeah i thoroughly

[1:18:14] explained this
[1:18:15] and i have anointed you with water
[1:18:18] it's still talking about the proper care
[1:18:21] it is the washing of
[1:18:23] the body and not only do you watch you
[1:18:26] need the lotion
[1:18:28] all in the scripture
[1:18:29] [Laughter]
[1:18:33] right here in the scripture you don't
[1:18:36] only wash
[1:18:38] you also need the lotion in your bible
[1:18:43] you see just a little tweak in your eyes
[1:18:49] amen and i have anointed you with oil
[1:18:53] i clothe you also with embroidered
[1:18:57] work so at puberty number one
[1:19:01] god is looking at the proper care of
[1:19:03] this child
[1:19:05] number two god is also concerned
[1:19:08] about the clothing because
[1:19:12] when the eyes of adam and eve were
[1:19:15] opening the garden of eden
[1:19:17] the devil already anointed them with a
[1:19:21] different
[1:19:21] wisdom to take care of their natural
[1:19:24] body
[1:19:25] and they use the leaves of the fig tree
[1:19:28] but when god
[1:19:29] came god used an animal called the lamb
[1:19:33] brother brother said that animal was a
[1:19:36] lamb
[1:19:37] do you follow me and that lamb we found
[1:19:39] out

[1:19:55] he's also concerned not about your
[1:19:58] clothing only
[1:19:59] but about your shoes
[1:20:06] did i fabricate something
[1:20:09] okay and i showed you
[1:20:13] with badger skin there is a key to that
[1:20:16] and i girded you still the clothing
[1:20:19] about with flymen fine linen
[1:20:23] and i cover you with sleek silk
[1:20:27] in other words the clothing they are
[1:20:29] putting here are expensive
[1:20:37] what is going on verse 11
[1:20:41] i deck you with ornament now
[1:20:45] god is concerned about jews

[1:22:45] and your helmet was of what

[1:23:15] amen it looks like something is turned
[1:23:17] on

[1:23:22] pizza

[1:23:55] for your beauty for it was perfect
[1:23:59] through my communists which i have put
[1:24:03] on you it's god that put this
[1:24:06] brother stephen if this
[1:24:10] were put by gods why are they wrong
[1:24:15] you ready now let's take our flight
[1:24:18] you ready amen
[1:24:22] in first timothy chapter 2 verse 9
[1:24:25] and 10 in like manner also that who
[1:24:31] this woman in ezekiel 16 was he a boy or
[1:24:34] a woman
[1:24:39] in like money also women
[1:24:42] adorned themselves in water
[1:24:47] power is contradicting ezekiel
[1:24:51] 16.
[1:24:56] the prophet paul who said if anybody
[1:25:00] speaks something
[1:25:01] contrary to me let that person be a
[1:25:05] curse
[1:25:08] he says the appeal of a woman must be
[1:25:14] modest
[1:25:17] paul you didn't read the old testament
[1:25:24] adult themselves in modest apparel
[1:25:27] with water same fairness
[1:25:31] and water so your clothing must be
[1:25:35] a must be coupled with a certain spirit
[1:25:43] because god clothes them with a lamb
[1:25:46] which was speaking about himself the
[1:25:49] lamb of god
[1:25:50] so when people see you not only do they
[1:25:53] see your clothes
[1:25:54] but they also see the nature of a lamb
[1:25:57] with you
[1:26:00] a nature that is meek
[1:26:04] modesty plus nature of
[1:26:08] a lambo dress code
[1:26:12] are you there come semicolon
[1:26:16] or whatever you call it can you read it
[1:26:19] with me
[1:26:20] and ot what does he mean with water
[1:26:28] see why you need a prophet
[1:26:31] if you take this you put it in
[1:26:34] the sister will be in trouble but i'm
[1:26:37] going to explain this later
[1:26:40] are you there not with water
[1:26:44] or whatever
[1:26:48] in ezekiel 16 which material they use
[1:26:52] why is paul condemning that
[1:27:02] note oh god or what
[1:27:05] oh water he's attacking ezekiel 16.
[1:27:13] paul a misogyny doesn't like women
[1:27:18] but which becometh women professing
[1:27:22] water
[1:27:23] paul is more looking of the inside
[1:27:26] person
[1:27:27] with water more than ever
[1:27:31] the character
[1:27:35] paul let's look at peter
[1:27:38] the one who they handed the key to the
[1:27:41] gentile
[1:27:42] because paul was an apostle to the
[1:27:43] gentile but peter was handed the key
[1:27:46] he's the one that went and preached to
[1:27:48] the gentile and the holy ghost came
[1:27:50] peter what do you think about what paul
[1:27:53] is saying
[1:27:55] likewise you who
[1:27:59] women or men okay if you say
[1:28:02] man we gotta cast out the devil
[1:28:06] amen likewise you wives
[1:28:10] be in subjection to your own husband
[1:28:13] that if any obey not the word
[1:28:17] there also with your preaching
[1:28:26] not only are they forbidden to preach in
[1:28:29] church
[1:28:32] may also without the water
[1:28:35] be won by water in other words a woman
[1:28:40] should bring somebody to christ more by
[1:28:43] her conduct
[1:28:45] her life
[1:28:50] you can testify don't sit there breaking
[1:28:54] the seals
[1:28:57] and there are some men without the word
[1:29:00] be warned by the conversation of the
[1:29:02] wife
[1:29:03] so the man just sitting and watch you
[1:29:06] watch you watch you after a while
[1:29:08] he take the beer and he throw it away
[1:29:11] without one shot without coming
[1:29:15] you hidden in jesus name
[1:29:22] wow there behold do you remember that
[1:29:24] woman
[1:29:26] that the husband was a drunkard
[1:29:29] do you remember that story and the joker
[1:29:32] was sitting with his friend
[1:29:34] they said there is no christian the
[1:29:36] drunkard begin to testify
[1:29:38] he said i no one
[1:29:41] that is my wife a homo the other one
[1:29:44] said no no no no no
[1:29:46] let's go home and let her preach for us
[1:29:50] are you there when they got home they
[1:29:53] begin to act
[1:29:54] crazy in the house the woman never
[1:29:58] preached a sermon
[1:30:01] are you there she just behaved as a
[1:30:04] woman
[1:30:05] cooking food and the food she's cooking
[1:30:09] is converting people
[1:30:14] [Applause]
[1:30:15] because she is in her position
[1:30:19] she is in the kitchen and when you are
[1:30:22] in your position
[1:30:24] there is power
[1:30:27] are you there she begin to cook the food
[1:30:30] the holy ghost anointed him
[1:30:33] and bring a song to her heart and she
[1:30:35] begin to just sing the song sister
[1:30:37] lorell
[1:30:38] and three drunker at the altar
[1:30:42] without a preacher
[1:30:46] are you there so while they behold your
[1:30:50] chest conversation that conversation
[1:30:53] means your life
[1:30:55] coupled with water respect
[1:30:58] who's adorning
[1:31:01] let it what
[1:31:07] this is not paul anymore if you want to
[1:31:10] kill paul you kill peter
[1:31:12] are you there not be that outer
[1:31:16] adorning of planting of water
[1:31:20] and of wearing water and putting on
[1:31:24] water
[1:31:25] peter comes and contains ezekiel 16.
[1:31:30] why are these guys attacking that
[1:31:36] and let it be they want them
[1:31:39] just like paul they are more focused
[1:31:44] about this guy
[1:31:47] the nature oh my god i don't know how i
[1:31:50] went that far
[1:31:54] that was too fast
[1:31:57] amen and let it be the hidden man of the
[1:32:01] water
[1:32:02] in that which is not water
[1:32:05] even on the ornament of water
[1:32:08] your jew is a meek
[1:32:11] and a quiet water
[1:32:15] which is in the sight of god of a water
[1:32:19] it is greater price than your watch
[1:32:29] after this manner the old time
[1:32:34] and the water
[1:32:42] and the holy women also who trusted in
[1:32:46] god
[1:32:46] i don't water in other words
[1:32:49] all the old christian women
[1:32:53] they were focusing more on the nature
[1:32:57] of the inside versus
[1:33:00] their outer appearance
[1:33:03] so what is going on in ezekiel 16.
[1:33:08] in ezekiel 16 god
[1:33:12] told you that at the age of teenager
[1:33:16] of puberty your sex hormones

[1:33:47] to see your period

[1:33:51] to have hair
[1:33:52] in your private part then you're gonna
[1:33:55] start seeing
[1:33:57] that you need a certain type of hygiene

[1:35:41] all of those are created by your hormone
[1:35:46] did we get it there everybody clear
[1:35:50] if you miss to understand this area
[1:35:53] satan is coming with a different veil
[1:35:57] once satan brings the veil not the holy
[1:36:01] veil of adam and eve
[1:36:03] it is called the last veil we explain
[1:36:05] that on wednesday
[1:36:06] then once the last veil hits
[1:36:09] you're gonna find yourself begin to be
[1:36:12] interested
[1:36:13] in those kind of stuff just know you're
[1:36:16] under attack
[1:36:17] everybody clear we explained this on
[1:36:19] wednesday
[1:36:20] brother branham said jonah turn over in
[1:36:23] the wealth building
[1:36:25] look away toward the temple the best
[1:36:27] that he knowed
[1:36:28] toward the top of the well and begin to
[1:36:31] pray
[1:36:31] and god turned that big fish around he
[1:36:34] was a prepared fish
[1:36:36] took him right straight to nineveh in
[1:36:38] babylon for a purpose
[1:36:40] now we believe that most of the ninevite
[1:36:44] must have been backslidden and have went
[1:36:47] off i read a story one time
[1:36:50] where many of them had turned to water
[1:36:54] hedonism and they were worshiping water
[1:36:59] so when jonah came to nineveh
[1:37:02] he found a last veil on the people of
[1:37:06] nineveh they didn't know even how to
[1:37:09] discern
[1:37:09] good from evil are you there
[1:37:13] if you take a little child that is born
[1:37:16] if you give them two shoes their shoes
[1:37:19] do you know how they wear their shoes
[1:37:24] do you know how they wear their shoes
[1:37:26] they will take their left shoe and put
[1:37:28] it on the right
[1:37:29] they take the right and put it on the
[1:37:31] left it is the sign
[1:37:33] that they are still under the veil
[1:37:36] they don't know how to descend there
[1:37:39] right from left
[1:37:41] when they begin to grow up then they
[1:37:43] begin we are the one telling them this
[1:37:45] here
[1:37:46] put this put this and the more you put
[1:37:48] it by the power
[1:37:50] of repetition it get in their
[1:37:51] subconscious then
[1:37:53] automatically they begin to fix it if
[1:37:55] you don't do it
[1:37:56] you're gonna see them waking up they can
[1:37:58] put any kind of dress and they're going
[1:38:00] to church it's you who they hey
[1:38:02] come here we got to fix your hair they
[1:38:04] don't care about it but once they're
[1:38:06] teenager you don't tell them to fix
[1:38:09] their hair
[1:38:11] before they come to church automatically
[1:38:14] they sit down and they go like this
[1:38:18] 20 minutes on a mirror what makes you
[1:38:22] love the mirror a teenager why do you
[1:38:26] like the mirror a teenager
[1:38:28] why do you turn around and walk in your
[1:38:31] bathroom and turn around and walk in the
[1:38:33] bathroom
[1:38:33] why do you do that you are under the
[1:38:37] territory
[1:38:38] of the black dogger are you there
[1:38:42] you are doing things you don't
[1:38:44] understand why
[1:38:45] and if somebody don't train you right
[1:38:48] the last
[1:38:49] veil is waiting for you right there
[1:38:51] before you know it
[1:38:52] you begin to do things to attract men
[1:38:56] you begin to get picture to attract men
[1:38:59] you begin to push things to attract
[1:39:01] young lady
[1:39:02] because you fell under the last veil
[1:39:05] are you there are you there before you
[1:39:08] know it you put a bracelet here
[1:39:10] tomorrow you have three bracelets
[1:39:12] tomorrow you have five
[1:39:13] jewels tomorrow you have seven jewels
[1:39:16] tomorrow you have this
[1:39:17] tomorrow high heel you don't understand
[1:39:19] why you are doing that
[1:39:21] all of them were described in ezekiel
[1:39:23] 16.
[1:39:24] you don't do that by any chance because
[1:39:27] the black dog is turned on
[1:39:29] and when he comes he's attacking you in
[1:39:31] those area
[1:39:32] and when he's turned off at meadow paws
[1:39:35] he's going to come again and attack you
[1:39:36] in the same area
[1:39:38] you're going to see that later why is a
[1:39:40] woman in menopause beginning to make
[1:39:42] herself more cute
[1:39:45] have you seen that have you seen that
[1:39:49] why is she doing that why
[1:39:52] she got married she put her car in
[1:39:54] neutral in menopause she got back again
[1:39:57] in emmanuel
[1:40:00] she acted like she's a little girl again
[1:40:02] why is she doing that
[1:40:04] because the hormones are turned off
[1:40:08] it is the hormone that triggers this
[1:40:11] when they are turned off
[1:40:12] they also goes back and then revisits
[1:40:15] this area
[1:40:15] that's why the woman unconsciously
[1:40:18] because somebody is telling you you owed
[1:40:20] you owed you're getting old you're
[1:40:22] getting old so now she's trying to fight
[1:40:24] it
[1:40:25] now she think to make herself younger
[1:40:27] the black dog is staying ready
[1:40:30] i'm going to prove to you by the court
[1:40:33] everybody here this message is something
[1:40:37] when you look at the fig tree we spoke
[1:40:40] that the fig tree heaven leaves
[1:40:42] and the fruit tree have the fruit god
[1:40:45] never gave permission to the leaves
[1:40:48] he gave only permission to the fruit in
[1:40:51] georges chapter 9
[1:40:52] verse 10 and 11 the bible says
[1:40:55] and the tree said to the fig tree
[1:40:59] come down and reign over us
[1:41:02] but the fig trees say unto them
[1:41:06] should i forsake my water so the fig
[1:41:09] tree by the scripture
[1:41:11] have a sweet fruit
[1:41:16] amen and my water
[1:41:20] good fruit only confirm what genesis say
[1:41:24] because every tree that was created was
[1:41:26] what pleasant
[1:41:28] good for food judges keep that same line
[1:41:32] everybody clear should i forsake my
[1:41:35] my sweetness and my good fruit
[1:41:38] and go to be promoted over the trees
[1:41:42] so we understand by this scripture that
[1:41:44] there is nothing wrong
[1:41:46] with the fig fruit the problem
[1:41:50] is the leaves mark 11
[1:41:54] 13 and 14 jesus coming and was hungry
[1:41:58] and begin to pass by at fig tree
[1:42:02] and seeing a fig tree why
[1:42:05] did jesus only was interested in the fig
[1:42:08] tree
[1:42:09] why was not jesus interested in an apple
[1:42:12] tree
[1:42:13] why was not jesus interested in a
[1:42:15] sycamore
[1:42:17] why was jesus on me interested
[1:42:20] in a fig tree and why among
[1:42:23] all the trees of the garden of eden adam
[1:42:26] and eve were only
[1:42:28] interested in a fig tree why they didn't
[1:42:31] take their leaves from a mango tree
[1:42:37] hallelujah and seeing a fig tree not by
[1:42:40] any hazard
[1:42:42] adam was the first adam and jesus was
[1:42:45] the walker
[1:42:48] are you there are you there the first
[1:42:52] adam went to the fig tree
[1:42:54] by the second adam who brings redemption
[1:42:57] must also go to the center to the fig
[1:42:59] tree
[1:43:02] are you there what is he gonna do to the
[1:43:05] fig tree
[1:43:06] is he gonna use the fig tree are you
[1:43:10] there
[1:43:11] are you there hallelujah
[1:43:15] this message is something hallelujah
[1:43:18] and he happened and seeing a fig tree
[1:43:23] a fire of having water what
[1:43:26] attracted jesus to the tree was the
[1:43:29] leaves
[1:43:30] what attracted adam to the tree was
[1:43:33] their leaves
[1:43:40] if you still doubting open your
[1:43:42] scripture and read it
[1:43:44] are you there and seeing a fig tree
[1:43:47] a fire of having water jesus
[1:43:51] look he saw a fig tree he look he have
[1:43:54] lips he said no
[1:43:55] okay let me go handle this stuff i came
[1:43:59] for redemption
[1:44:00] are you there he came if
[1:44:03] happily in other words perhaps
[1:44:08] he might find amy darron
[1:44:11] was jesus god the son of god is who
[1:44:16] do you think jesus did not know that
[1:44:19] there was no fruit in that tree
[1:44:27] we already proved to you that jesus was
[1:44:29] god unto us a son
[1:44:31] is born his name shall be called
[1:44:33] counselor
[1:44:34] comforter priest of priests and what
[1:44:37] mighty god
[1:44:39] how can a son be a god everlasting water
[1:44:44] how can a son be a father

[1:45:30] sure that when he comes to that tree
[1:45:35] he doesn't want to deal with the fruit
[1:45:40] because nothing was wrong with the fruit
[1:45:44] and the fruit of the fig tree are good

[1:49:50] throne of god
[1:49:51] and of the lamb in the midst of the
[1:49:54] street of it

[1:50:45] left in genesis 12
[1:50:48] he left the city of earth and he went to
[1:50:51] the land of
[1:50:52] canaan ever cleared then god gave
[1:50:54] abraham a promise
[1:50:56] he's going to be the father of many
[1:50:57] nations ever clear so far
[1:51:00] in galatians on wednesday we found out
[1:51:02] that that promised seed was crushed and
[1:51:06] then
[1:51:06] in roman we found that power when he
[1:51:09] came
[1:51:09] he condemned the jews he condemned the
[1:51:12] gentiles
[1:51:13] but when we look at abraham abraham was
[1:51:15] a
[1:51:16] hidden do you remember that you say
[1:51:19] brother stephen we are not hidden
[1:51:21] what is a hidden the people
[1:51:24] are in the spirit of the last day just
[1:51:27] like there was in the days of noah

[1:52:29] greatest bunch of
[1:52:31] water that i know of everywhere is in
[1:52:35] water
[1:52:36] hidden means water
[1:52:38] [Music]
[1:52:42] he that means what if you're sleeping
[1:52:45] you need to stand
[1:52:47] everybody clear roman paul condemned
[1:52:51] and paul proved to us that not only was
[1:52:54] abraham a hidden but abraham also was a
[1:52:58] non-circumcised gentile the key
[1:53:01] on wednesday was that god is trying to
[1:53:04] separate you
[1:53:05] from hedonism or from gentile
[1:53:08] lifestyle everybody clear now this is
[1:53:11] where we were
[1:53:12] why hallelujah god want to separate you
[1:53:16] from that
[1:53:17] why act 26
[1:53:21] i have appeared today for this purpose
[1:53:24] to make them minister and a witness but
[1:53:27] to these things which that has seen and
[1:53:29] of those things in which we were
[1:53:31] i will appear unto them delivering this
[1:53:34] from the water
[1:53:36] these people were the jew
[1:53:40] we okay now paul is saying here
[1:53:44] that when i come to you god
[1:53:47] is saying to paul actually that when i'm
[1:53:50] coming to you
[1:53:52] paul i found you hooked in the hebrew
[1:53:55] lord you were hooked
[1:53:59] in the hebrew law and you were also
[1:54:01] hooked
[1:54:02] as a gentile
[1:54:06] you understand i want to deliver you
[1:54:09] from two things
[1:54:11] i want to deliver you from your jewish
[1:54:13] custom
[1:54:16] or from the law and i want also to
[1:54:18] deliver you from water
[1:54:23] a gentile a hidden means water
[1:54:26] unbeliever an unbeliever is a sinner
[1:54:29] right
[1:54:30] go back in your scripture paul say i am
[1:54:32] the chief of sinner
[1:54:37] are you there delivering this from the
[1:54:40] people
[1:54:40] and from the gentile unto whom are now
[1:54:44] sending
[1:54:45] you sending me to gentile wives to open
[1:54:48] water so gentiles
[1:54:52] by nature are blind
[1:54:56] you follow me not that you don't see
[1:55:01] spiritual blindness and to turn them
[1:55:04] from water
[1:55:05] gentle living darkness
[1:55:09] american every nation that lucifer
[1:55:12] show jesus live under this
[1:55:16] and from the power of water
[1:55:19] they live under the power of satan
[1:55:22] so this bloodness this darkness
[1:55:26] is nothing but the anointing of satan
[1:55:30] everybody clear unto god
[1:55:33] that they may receive forgiveness of sin
[1:55:36] an inheritance among them which are what
[1:55:39] sanctified by faith like abraham that is
[1:55:42] in what
[1:55:43] in me paul in galatians 1 14
[1:55:47] and profited in the jews religion
[1:55:51] above my water in my own nation
[1:55:56] being more exceedingly zealous of the
[1:55:59] tradition
[1:56:00] of what paul was
[1:56:03] bound by a religion demon
[1:56:09] the worst one banning american people
[1:56:13] are you a christian i'm a baptist are
[1:56:16] you a christian i'm a methodist
[1:56:18] are you a christian i am this amen
[1:56:22] in the feast of the trumpet in
[1:56:24] revelation 11
[1:56:26] their ministry will be the ministry of
[1:56:28] moses and elias
[1:56:30] calling to israel out of the water
[1:56:33] do you see what moses said elijah does
[1:56:36] just as the seven and just message
[1:56:41] the bride out of the water
[1:56:49] paul was jewish the bride
[1:56:53] is from the what pentecostal tradition
[1:56:57] and what remember moses and elijah
[1:57:01] is to call them out of the old atonement
[1:57:04] of the lamb
[1:57:05] and sheep and blood and goats and
[1:57:08] sacrifice
[1:57:09] to the real living sacrifice to the
[1:57:11] world
[1:57:12] and the seven angel message under the
[1:57:15] same trumpet
[1:57:16] the seventh trumpet same thing the same
[1:57:19] seal the seventh seal
[1:57:21] called the people the bride out of the
[1:57:24] water
[1:57:25] and the water
[1:57:31] you understand word pagan
[1:57:36] heathen gentile
[1:57:40] unbeliever and circumcised
[1:57:46] make sense the message of brother
[1:57:49] branham
[1:57:51] called the bride out of the water
[1:57:54] religious and out of the water to the
[1:57:58] genuine atonement
[1:58:01] the word christ impersonated
[1:58:05] in his word made flesh among
[1:58:09] us so when brother branham gives you
[1:58:12] instruction
[1:58:14] he's not bringing you back to legalism
[1:58:17] he's actually separating you from the
[1:58:20] pentecostal
[1:58:22] tradition and is separating you
[1:58:25] from the world tradition of pagan
[1:58:28] or hidden or gender or unbeliever
[1:58:32] or uncircumcised
[1:58:35] everybody clear so far everybody cleared
[1:58:38] so far
[1:58:39] now let's go to act chapter 15.
[1:58:43] now we on the plateau yeah we good
[1:58:48] if you dare you can say amen why
[1:58:52] does god want to separate us from a
[1:58:54] gentile
[1:58:55] number one the gentiles are blinded by
[1:58:58] lucifer
[1:59:00] number two the gentile live in darkness
[1:59:04] number three they live under the power
[1:59:07] of satan
[1:59:09] why acts chapter 15 verse 14
[1:59:12] if you dare you can say amen
[1:59:15] simeon has declared
[1:59:18] how god has first did visit the water
[1:59:23] there was a discussion about the
[1:59:24] circumcision
[1:59:26] you can read this at home to take out of
[1:59:29] them a people for water
[1:59:32] remember israel was redeemed to be
[1:59:35] servant
[1:59:36] but god wanted a wife
[1:59:40] are you there now his wife was not the
[1:59:43] jewish
[1:59:44] he was not an army he have to be rude to
[1:59:47] a gentile
[1:59:48] so he goes through naomi in order to get
[1:59:52] roof
[1:59:53] so god now is going to the gentile
[1:59:56] to take a people for his name's sake
[2:00:00] because the wife must carry the same
[2:00:02] name
[2:00:03] of the husband that's why brother
[2:00:05] branham said
[2:00:06] i'll call you mrs jesus
[2:00:11] you gather first uh
[2:00:15] 15 and to this agree
[2:00:19] the words of the prophet as it is
[2:00:22] written
[2:00:23] after this i will return and i will
[2:00:25] build again the tabernacle of david
[2:00:28] which is fallen and i will build again
[2:00:31] the rune thereof
[2:00:32] and i will set it up that the residue of
[2:00:36] men
[2:00:36] must seek after the lord remember it's
[2:00:39] the residue
[2:00:40] he pulled israel out and everybody who
[2:00:42] remain is the residue
[2:00:44] everybody clear that the residue of men
[2:00:49] must seek after the lord and all the
[2:00:52] water
[2:00:53] not the jews upon whom my name is what
[2:00:57] the name of the lord will be called upon
[2:00:59] the gentile
[2:01:00] says the lord who does these things
[2:01:04] watch now no to god
[2:01:07] are all the words from the beginning of
[2:01:09] the world wherefore my
[2:01:11] sentence in other words my decision my
[2:01:14] judgment is this
[2:01:15] that we trouble them not who's those
[2:01:18] them
[2:01:18] the gentiles which from among the
[2:01:21] gentiles
[2:01:22] are turned to water there was a
[2:01:25] discussion
[2:01:26] whether the gentiles should be
[2:01:28] circumcised or not
[2:01:30] because jews are circumcised the
[2:01:32] president simeon say listen listen
[2:01:34] listen listen listen
[2:01:35] we already know there was a prophet
[2:01:37] there was a prophet that already spoke
[2:01:39] david gave us a promise we already know
[2:01:42] that god is gonna go to the gentile
[2:01:44] and pick up a people for his name's sake
[2:01:46] so now the
[2:01:47] gentile that are converted to christ
[2:01:51] let's not trouble them with the law
[2:01:53] anymore
[2:01:54] are you there but what are we going to
[2:01:57] tell them
[2:01:58] you there verse 20 but that we write to
[2:02:02] them
[2:02:03] that they abstain from water
[2:02:07] gentiles leave other under
[2:02:10] idolatry from where abraham came from
[2:02:15] that's why rachel having
[2:02:18] the terror of him that's why uh lebanon
[2:02:21] having diado jacob have to clean up his
[2:02:24] house removing the other
[2:02:26] because gentile are under idolatry
[2:02:30] okay abstain from pollution of adult
[2:02:33] come out and from water
[2:02:37] the spirit of a fornication
[2:02:40] is a gentile spirit
[2:02:45] you get it now what you need to tell the
[2:02:48] gentile
[2:02:49] because they live under blindness
[2:02:53] they live in darkness they live
[2:02:56] under the power of satan don't bring
[2:02:59] them
[2:02:59] back again to a religious demon
[2:03:03] you understand but tell them to come
[2:03:07] out from their lifestyle of idolatry
[2:03:11] their lifestyle of having sex before
[2:03:14] marriage
[2:03:18] are you there job to verse 27
[2:03:22] and we sent therefore judas and salas
[2:03:25] who shall also tell you the same thing
[2:03:29] by month
[2:03:30] for it seems good to who
[2:03:33] now it's not simeon it seems good to the
[2:03:37] holy ghost
[2:03:38] and to us to lay upon you no greater
[2:03:41] burden
[2:03:43] than that than these necessary things
[2:03:46] the law become a burden that you abstain
[2:03:50] from meat offer to who from water
[2:03:54] blood and from the thing strange and
[2:03:57] from
[2:03:58] water from which if you keep yourself
[2:04:02] you shall do water with the instruction
[2:04:05] we give in you as gentile
[2:04:07] don't go under idolatry things that are
[2:04:10] sacrificed to adopt and don't also live
[2:04:13] under
[2:04:14] fornication because fornication funding
[2:04:17] a gentile
[2:04:18] let's go to ephesians 4.
[2:04:23] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[2:04:27] ephesians chapter 4 verse 17
[2:04:31] why do we need to be delivered from a
[2:04:34] gentile
[2:04:35] why do we have to be delivered from our
[2:04:38] american custom
[2:04:40] why do we have to be delivered from our
[2:04:43] african
[2:04:44] our european our south american
[2:04:47] our canadian custom why
[2:04:51] you get it 17.
[2:04:55] this i said before and testify in the
[2:04:58] lord
[2:04:59] that you hereafter walk not as are they
[2:05:04] what
[2:05:07] walk come on in the water
[2:05:11] gentle walk in the vanity of the mind
[2:05:16] that's why the bible says the
[2:05:18] imagination of
[2:05:20] man's mind becomes continually evil
[2:05:24] that's why when god is separating you
[2:05:27] he wants you out of blindness out of
[2:05:30] darkness
[2:05:31] out of the power of satan out of the
[2:05:34] light of american adult
[2:05:36] out of fornication out of working with
[2:05:39] the vanity of your mind
[2:05:42] are you there karma having the
[2:05:45] understanding what
[2:05:48] darkened that's dental because you're
[2:05:50] already living under darkness
[2:05:51] being alienated from the life of god
[2:05:54] through the
[2:05:55] ignorance that is in water there is a
[2:05:58] spiritual
[2:05:59] ignorance in the gentile
[2:06:03] you see now you see why amen
[2:06:08] because of the blindness of the world
[2:06:12] you see these planets here their hearts
[2:06:14] are blinded
[2:06:15] that's why you go to roman one that
[2:06:18] blindness of the heart causes idolatry
[2:06:22] and they begin to make adults and
[2:06:23] worship them
[2:06:25] are you there verse 19
[2:06:28] who being water
[2:06:32] a gentle love sound is
[2:06:36] beyond what a normal
[2:06:39] person should live sexually
[2:06:43] you are past feelings
[2:06:46] do you want to go back to the gentile do
[2:06:50] you see why americans act the way they
[2:06:52] act
[2:06:53] do you see why people in the night club
[2:06:55] in africa in europe do what they do
[2:06:58] they're like crazy maniaca
[2:07:02] are you there that's why they make
[2:07:04] pornography
[2:07:08] past feeling they can even met with a
[2:07:11] beast
[2:07:12] with a dog it's beyond it's a gentle
[2:07:16] lifestyle
[2:07:18] that's why paul get them out of
[2:07:21] blindness
[2:07:22] get them out of the darkness it is not

[2:31:07] and that door inquired after their god
[2:31:10] saying how did what
[2:31:14] save the water when you
[2:31:17] get to the promised land and when you
[2:31:20] destroy
[2:31:21] the god you destroy the altar you
[2:31:24] destroy
[2:31:25] everything never stop one time
[2:31:28] follow me carefully and begin to ask
[2:31:31] yourself a question
[2:31:33] how did this nation worship their god
[2:31:37] in other words what method did they use
[2:31:40] to worship their god
[2:31:42] how was their lifestyle of worshiping
[2:31:45] the lord
[2:31:46] their god if they were worshipping their
[2:31:49] god doing this
[2:31:50] then i'm gonna also do this to jehovah
[2:31:54] let me read it back again so he's gonna
[2:31:56] hit you
[2:31:57] how did this nation serve their god
[2:32:01] even so without water in other words you
[2:32:05] wanna take
[2:32:06] the worship of the heathen and
[2:32:09] bring them to god
[2:32:14] that's the root of catholicism
[2:32:21] catholicism took the roman tradition
[2:32:25] and put that in the church
[2:32:28] and god said don't take the stuff of the
[2:32:31] eden
[2:32:32] and mix it with my worship
[2:32:37] i am delivering you out of babylon
[2:32:41] out of the nomination adobe pentacles
[2:32:44] adobe baptist out of methodist don't
[2:32:47] bring

[2:33:00] that god

[2:33:04] he hated
[2:33:05] have dead done unto the water what you
[2:33:08] think was a worship is an abomination

[2:33:19] temple

[2:39:19] why are you taking a picture with a
[2:39:20] christmas tree
[2:39:25] why why
[2:39:28] why do you see
[2:39:32] brother branham and so did the second
[2:39:35] eve met her said nice sin
[2:39:37] giving it to a denomination creed
[2:39:40] accepted dogma
[2:39:41] instead of word the word taken down
[2:39:44] paganado
[2:39:45] like jupiter and so forth put up paul
[2:39:49] and barnabas took down the sun god and
[2:39:52] the moon god
[2:39:53] astrid the moon god with ron caution
[2:39:56] and made her being the mother of the sun
[2:39:59] god which is jupiter
[2:40:00] and changed the birthday of jesus christ
[2:40:02] from water
[2:40:06] jesus was born in april the roman
[2:40:09] catholic church removed that date
[2:40:12] and put it in december where they
[2:40:14] worship the
[2:40:15] sun god under a hidden tree
[2:40:20] and christian message believers are
[2:40:23] swallowing it
[2:40:28] hallelujah and they put a baby bone
[2:40:33] with the measures which is another line
[2:40:36] because the measure so jesus christ are
[2:40:39] two years old
[2:40:40] that's why erhu said kill the children
[2:40:44] two years old down you take the measures
[2:40:47] and the baby it's a lie
[2:40:50] the tree is hidden spoken word
[2:40:53] tabernacle
[2:40:55] stop this nonsense
[2:40:59] and every one of us place santa claus
[2:41:03] and decorate the trees and water
[2:41:07] now you understand brother branham after
[2:41:10] i show you
[2:41:10] tens of scriptures
[2:41:13] that's why brother branham said go home
[2:41:15] and study
[2:41:17] catch the man of the prophet he's
[2:41:19] against water
[2:41:23] it's not that he doesn't want you to get
[2:41:24] present it is you don't understand
[2:41:27] the devil is true hedonism
[2:41:31] and things like that and then call
[2:41:33] yourself what
[2:41:35] what's the matter with christian church
[2:41:39] god pull you out of hidden and here you
[2:41:42] go back to them
[2:41:43] the women buying their water
[2:41:49] what has this come to my
[2:41:52] how i can understand where a what
[2:41:56] has anything to do with the water
[2:41:59] is brother branham against easter
[2:42:02] brother his brother branham last sunday
[2:42:05] says that it's the best
[2:42:07] of all the days but what brother branham
[2:42:10] is pointing against you
[2:42:12] it is not easter he's pointing you about
[2:42:16] the begging stuff they are dead in water
[2:42:20] there's nothing wrong with brother
[2:42:21] charles he's going to pick up his wife
[2:42:24] so chill out
[2:42:27] are you there are you there so brother
[2:42:30] branham is
[2:42:31] not against easter but brother branham
[2:42:34] enter easter
[2:42:35] he said easter the date is correct
[2:42:39] the month is correct it's about the
[2:42:41] resurrection
[2:42:42] but my people i want to warn you about
[2:42:45] hiddenism they put a rabbit
[2:42:48] they put eggs those stuff have
[2:42:52] nothing to do with the scripture
[2:42:56] [Music]
[2:42:58] why a rabbit he start from germany
[2:43:03] it's the lutheran church that started
[2:43:07] the rabbit easter they came out from the
[2:43:10] catholic church
[2:43:12] and they killed santa and the devil
[2:43:14] brought the rabbit
[2:43:16] who's bringing gifts to the kids he
[2:43:18] changes
[2:43:19] santa claus to the rabbit
[2:43:24] you see what is the logo of the playboy
[2:43:31] what is the logo of the pornography
[2:43:34] channel

[2:43:54] sexually inclined beast
[2:43:57] and that's what they bring and couple
[2:43:59] that in history
[2:44:01] and message believers swallow it
[2:44:06] a rabbit has anything to do with the
[2:44:08] resurrection
[2:44:10] how a christmas tree has anything to do
[2:44:12] with the birth of christ
[2:44:13] it is what my friend we have got off the
[2:44:19] path
[2:44:19] somewhere but now a real born again
[2:44:23] man or woman realizes because there is
[2:44:27] life within you tell you what is what

[2:44:33] easter he's against the paganism
[2:44:36] the protest but chris but christmas
[2:44:40] the date the time and everything is
[2:44:42] wrong
[2:44:43] easter the date is correct it's the
[2:44:45] paganism that brother branham is

[2:45:03] christ have to do with your face
[2:45:09] when people see your face they see the
[2:45:12] resurrection
[2:45:15] that is good but even there they have no
[2:45:18] idea how to approach god

[2:52:26] unto the lord but actually it's a
[2:52:29] different
[2:52:29] law which is the law of love and the law
[2:52:32] of grace lord
