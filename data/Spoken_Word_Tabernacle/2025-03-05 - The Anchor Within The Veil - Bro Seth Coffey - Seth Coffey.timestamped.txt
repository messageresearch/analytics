[28:14] amen hello God bless you all um this is
[28:17] like a praise report this actually
[28:19] happened on
[28:20] Sunday um Sunday around like it was
[28:25] since like 10:00 till 4:00 in the
[28:28] morning or so our dad first we went to
[28:32] sleep then around midnight our dad woke
[28:33] us up to pray so we were all tired but
[28:37] some of us woke up to go pray and as
[28:40] when we went to go pray our dad was
[28:42] talking to us about prayer and even
[28:44] supplication of prayer and as he was
[28:47] talking to us we started praying and as
[28:49] we're praying um he's talking about
[28:52] prayer as we're praying and as we're
[28:54] praying we heard like the doorbell ring
[28:58] and we also have like this app in our
[29:00] phone that can check the camera to see
[29:02] who's outside so we heard a dark bell
[29:04] ring at first we didn't pay no M toy
[29:07] then it rang again then we my dad
[29:08] checked the camera as I was checking the
[29:10] window if someone was outside and then
[29:12] it rang like the third time my dad still
[29:15] checked but nobody was outside and as it
[29:18] was ringing in my heart I was like
[29:19] because the scripture came it was like
[29:21] God is because of revelation God is
[29:23] knocking at the door and it tells you to
[29:25] open it and in my head I was well God if
[29:28] he wanted to enter into the house he
[29:29] could simply go through the wall he
[29:31] didn't need to ring the door so in my
[29:34] head I was like I was telling my dad my
[29:37] dad why don't you go open the door but
[29:39] he didn't do anything but I was like
[29:41] maybe because we're in America certain
[29:43] people may it might be something else
[29:45] then later on as we're praying my dad
[29:47] opens the door and I was like that's
[29:48] exactly what I was praying for my dad to
[29:50] open the door to let God in so as um we
[29:55] prayed we saw nobody was outside so to
[29:58] to us that was like as we were praying
[29:59] God was vindicating our prayers and then
[30:01] later on we came to church and what was
[30:03] preached was exactly what my dad was
[30:05] talking as we were praying and even
[30:07] before we're
[30:09] praying
[30:14] anyways amen if we all could bow
[30:19] Heart Lord Heavenly Father we thank you

[49:29] I just really appreciate him doing that
[49:31] now now we're just trusting in the Lord
[49:33] amen it says for when God made promise
[49:36] to Abraham because he could swear by no
[49:38] greater he swear by himself saying
[49:41] surely blessing I Will Bless thee and
[49:44] multiplying I will multiply thy seed and
[49:46] so after that he had patiently endured
[49:49] he obtained the promise for men verily
[49:51] swear by the greater and oath of
[49:53] confirmation is them the end of all
[49:55] Strife wherein God God willing more
[49:58] abundantly to show under the HS of his
[49:59] promise the ubility of his counsel
[50:02] confirmed it by an oath that by two
[50:04] immutable things in which it was
[50:06] impossible for God to lie I'm so
[50:08] thankful it's impossible for God to lie
[50:11] we might have strong consolation who
[50:13] have fled for a refuge to lay hold upon
[50:16] the Hope set before us which hope we
[50:19] have as an anchor amen as an anchor for
[50:22] the soul both sure and steadfast which
[50:25] entereth in to that within the veil
[50:29] whether the Forerunner is for us entered
[50:31] even Jesus made and high priest Forever
[50:34] After the order of MDC Amen Let Us bow
[50:37] our heads once more Heavenly Father Lord
[50:39] we thank you for the reading of your
[50:41] word Lord we thank you for your never
[50:42] failing presence in a time of need Lord

[50:47] you would feel welcome Lord here and be
[50:49] the Supreme one Among Us Lord we thank
[50:51] you for your word Lord and we just pray
[50:53] that it would bless each and every heart
[50:55] in Jesus Christ's name amen you may have
[50:57] your seats amen we want to speak on that
[51:00] an anchor and brother brandom says you
[51:01] know a ship sometimes servicemen and so
[51:03] forth know it who have been on the sea
[51:06] when really the waves gets to dashing
[51:08] too hard for the boat amen they anchor
[51:11] it and it's got a line that lets it down
[51:14] that holds it it may flip around this
[51:16] way and that way around but the anchor
[51:19] holds it the anchor they cannot see land
[51:22] anywhere but they drop the anchor Beyond
[51:24] the Veil amen which is the water and
[51:27] that but they drop the anchor Beyond the
[51:29] Veil which is the water and that anchor
[51:31] goes down into the bottom of the sea
[51:33] plot the top of some big mountain
[51:35] somewhere and it drags till it catches a
[51:38] mountain catches on that mountain I want
[51:40] you to notice that on the other side of
[51:41] the veil it catches onto that mountain
[51:43] and it holds to the crevice there and
[51:45] all the sea can't move it no more all
[51:48] the sea cannot move it no more it's
[51:50] anchored out of sight now but it's
[51:52] anchored remember that and every person
[51:55] that has received Jesus Christ as
[51:57] personal savior been bornn again with
[51:59] the Holy Spirit you've dropped anchor
[52:01] how many's been born again by the Holy
[52:03] Spirit I have some encouraging words
[52:05] you've dropped anchor amen if you're
[52:07] sick and your hope is built on Christ
[52:09] you've dropped anchor the doctor May say
[52:11] this that or the other but as sure as
[52:13] your faith looks Yonder The Waves the
[52:16] sick spells the fevers may rise and
[52:18] everything like that but your Anchor
[52:21] Holds within the veil amen somewhere out
[52:24] yonder in the Mystic land say what have
[52:26] you got your hopes built on the doctor
[52:27] says it's gone the medicine says it
[52:29] can't do nothing the surgery has failed
[52:32] but my hopes is not built on that amen
[52:34] my hope is not built on those things we
[52:36] have our hopes within the veil what Veil
[52:39] through the shedding of his blood that
[52:41] tore his Spirit from his body and
[52:43] between that Veil there the anchor has
[52:45] caught hold of something he said I've
[52:47] seen a ship one time when it was tossed
[52:49] out there and I thought what's holding
[52:51] that ship in the same spot I couldn't
[52:54] understand it sitting out there in the
[52:55] sea and I noticed the waves had carried
[52:57] around this way and back around this way
[53:00] but it didn't move from that place now I
[53:02] want you to notice it wasn't that it
[53:04] wasn't tossed but it was that it wasn't
[53:06] moved amen I could see I I could not see
[53:10] nothing but there was a little wire rope
[53:13] that had run down from the bow of that
[53:15] ship into the anchor that had caught
[53:17] into something beneath my where I could
[53:20] where I could not see beyond the waters
[53:23] and it was it was a holding there and I
[53:25] said praise be to God God yes one day I
[53:28] found an anchor and you know what that
[53:30] is is that Veil I thought that was
[53:31] beautiful and this is just in my own
[53:33] little way but but I I I begin to ask
[53:35] the Lord you know on that that that
[53:37] anchor and I begin to say Lord why is it
[53:39] that I find it so hard to be able to
[53:42] explain that anchor and he revealed it
[53:44] so beautifully to me to my heart because
[53:46] he said you see that anchor is Beyond
[53:48] the Veil and you cannot see it with
[53:50] these natural eyes but that anchor goes
[53:53] beyond that Veil amen and the scripture
[53:56] says says in Corinthians for all things
[53:58] are for your sakes we don't like that
[54:00] some things but sometimes but the
[54:02] abundant grace might through the that
[54:05] the abundant grace might through the
[54:07] Thanksgiving of many rebound to the
[54:08] glory of God for which cause we faint
[54:11] not but though our outward man perish
[54:13] yet inward man is renewed day by day for
[54:17] our L Affliction which is but for a
[54:20] moment worketh for us far more exceeding
[54:23] and eternal weight of glory and I love
[54:25] this while we look look not at the
[54:27] things which are seen but which things
[54:29] are not seen for the things which are
[54:31] seen are temporal but the things which
[54:34] are not seen are Eternal I love how
[54:36] brother Brandon would tap that out over
[54:38] and over again he said you know I kept
[54:40] looking at that ship and I wondered what
[54:42] was holding it there cuz see even though
[54:43] brother brandham couldn't see what was
[54:45] holding that ship there he knew that
[54:47] something greater than the ship was
[54:49] there holding that ship amen and you
[54:51] know I'm a fisherman I'm a fisherman and
[54:53] a hunter I know most of y'all know that
[54:55] by now and I get a lot of things from uh
[54:57] uh from God by Nature when I'm out there
[54:59] and you know one time I was fishing and
[55:01] I don't know if y'all know about I'm
[55:02] sure you've heard of the South Fork
[55:04] River but one time I was in the South
[55:05] Fork River and and I was in this boat
[55:07] and I wanted to fish this spot but every
[55:09] time I tried to fish this spot the water
[55:11] would just keep pushing me down and
[55:13] pushing me down and pushing me down so I
[55:15] finally got up to a place where I could
[55:17] I grabed my little anchor and it wasn't
[55:19] much it was a little about a little five
[55:21] maybe 10 lb anchor and and I'm sitting
[55:23] here and and what I'm guessing is you
[55:24] know probably a, plus pounds of motor
[55:27] and boat and everything else and I've
[55:29] got this little anchor in my hand and
[55:31] when I'm sitting there with this little
[55:32] anchor I get to a place and I toss it
[55:35] upstream and as the boat begins to
[55:37] begins to go but then all of a sudden
[55:39] that anchor grabs something and when
[55:41] that anchor grabs something it about
[55:42] jerks you in the boat because it's
[55:44] grabbing so hard and so forcefully and
[55:46] you know I threw that little anchor out
[55:48] there and and I couldn't see what it
[55:49] grabbed but you know why cuz it went
[55:51] beyond the veil it went beyond the veil
[55:53] and it went down into that water and it
[55:55] grabbed a hold of something and you know
[55:57] I couldn't see what it was but I'll tell
[55:59] you one thing I knew it was a solid
[56:01] foundation whatever it grabbed a hold of
[56:03] and but even though while I was there
[56:05] and I was trying to fish that spot you
[56:07] know just me moving in the current the
[56:10] boat would begin to rock back and forth
[56:12] and left and right and and even though I
[56:14] was sitting there and I was rocking I
[56:16] still could not be moved because that
[56:18] anchor had found a place it was grabbing
[56:20] on to a to a to a to a strong foundation
[56:23] and you know a beautiful thing about
[56:25] that when when it came time for me to
[56:27] move and I was I was trying to get out
[56:29] of there you know I went and I grabbed a
[56:31] hold of that anchor but brother that
[56:34] anchor had grabbed so strong that even
[56:36] when I tried to pull up that anchor and
[56:38] and even with my own ability I hope you
[56:41] get what I'm saying even with my own
[56:43] ability I tried to move the anchor and I
[56:45] tried to tried to get it out of my own
[56:47] way but that anchor was so strong and it
[56:50] grabbed into a strong Rock and it was in
[56:53] there and even In My Own Strength I I
[56:55] couldn't move that and if I could say it
[56:56] this way something kept holding me I I I
[57:00] I couldn't explain it I couldn't tell
[57:02] you what was down there but there was
[57:03] something that I grabbed a hold of that
[57:06] it was so great I couldn't even move it
[57:11] amen I mean it's thankful for an anchor
[57:13] in our life and and I want to take this
[57:15] and this is might where it get a little
[57:16] bit different but I might just slow down
[57:18] here for a second and and I begin to
[57:20] think about that and I begin to think
[57:22] about job and the anchor that he had in
[57:24] his life and I'll just read the script R
[57:26] here and it says now there was a day
[57:28] when the sons of God came to present
[57:30] themselves before the Lord and Satan
[57:32] came also among them and the Lord said
[57:34] unto Satan whence comest thou then Satan
[57:36] answered the Lord the Lord and said from
[57:39] and to and fro in the earth and from
[57:41] walking up and down it and the Lord said
[57:43] unto Satan hast thou
[57:45] considered my servant
[57:48] job man job ain't done
[57:50] nothing he just man he's just if I can
[57:53] say it in my own words he's just
[57:54] chilling on the earth you know and
[57:56] living his life and all of a sudden the
[57:58] Lord says that thou considered my
[57:59] servant job that there is none like him
[58:02] in the earth a perfect and upright man
[58:04] one that feareth God and isth Evil then
[58:07] Satan answered him the Lord and said
[58:08] does job fear God for not hast thou not
[58:11] made a hedge about him and about his
[58:13] house and about all he hath on every
[58:16] side and have th bless him in the work
[58:18] of his hands and and his substance is
[58:21] increased in the land he said but put
[58:23] forth thine hand now and touch all that
[58:26] he hath and he will curse thee to thy
[58:28] face and and the Lord said unto Satan
[58:31] behold all that he is all all that he
[58:35] hath is in thy power only upon himself
[58:38] put not forth thy hand so Satan went
[58:41] forth from the presence of the Lord and
[58:43] there was a day when his sons and
[58:45] daughters were eating and drinking wine
[58:47] in their eldest brother's house and
[58:49] there came a messenger unto job and said
[58:52] and said The Oxen were plowing and the
[58:54] asses feeding beside them
[58:56] and the the sabines fell I can't say
[58:59] that saines fell upon them and took them
[59:01] away yay they have slain the servants
[59:04] with the edge of the sword and I only am
[59:07] escaped alone to tell thee and while he
[59:09] yet was speaking there came another and
[59:10] said the fire of God is fallen from
[59:13] heaven and hath burned up the sheep from
[59:15] the servants and consumed them and I
[59:17] only am escaped alone to tell thee oh
[59:19] man Satan just left one guy alive just
[59:21] to tell him how bad his day was going to
[59:23] be and while he was yet speaking there
[59:26] came another and said the Chans made out
[59:29] three bands and fell upon the camels and
[59:31] have carried them away yay and slain the
[59:33] servants with the edge of the sword and
[59:35] I only am escaped to tell thee while he
[59:38] was yet speaking there came also another
[59:40] and said thy sons and thy daughters were
[59:43] eating and drinking wine in their eldest
[59:45] brother's house and behold there came a
[59:47] great wind from the Wilderness and smoke
[59:49] the four corners of the house and it
[59:51] fell upon the young men and they are
[59:53] dead and I only am escaped alone to tell
[59:56] thee now listen here now this is where
[59:58] we're talking about an anchor then job
[1:00:00] arose and rent his mantel and shaved his
[1:00:03] head and fell down upon the ground and
[1:00:05] worshiped
[1:00:07] hallelujah
[1:00:09] hallelu hallelujah see I want you to I
[1:00:12] want you to I might say this many more
[1:00:14] times for this service but I want you to
[1:00:15] realize right now that takes more than a
[1:00:18] man that takes more than a man and
[1:00:21] shaved his head fell down and worshiped
[1:00:25] and said naked came I out of my mother's
[1:00:27] womb and naked shall I return thither
[1:00:30] the lord gave and the Lord hath taken
[1:00:32] away blessed be the name of the Lord and
[1:00:36] all this job sin not nor charge God
[1:00:40] foolishly now I want to show you
[1:00:42] something here cuz remember we're
[1:00:43] talking about within the veil and the
[1:00:45] problem that we have is the veil yes sir
[1:00:47] amen I want you to notice this now we're
[1:00:49] just maybe just teach for a little bit
[1:00:50] here but I want you to realize here that
[1:00:53] job was not a sinner sir job was not a
[1:00:57] sinner he believed God and listen just
[1:01:00] because you're a Believer does not mean
[1:01:02] you're exempt from
[1:01:04] trials job was a great father it said
[1:01:07] that he continuously made sacrifices for
[1:01:10] for his children listen I know you
[1:01:12] mothers and fathers stay up and pray for
[1:01:14] your children and you hold your token up
[1:01:16] high and he raised up a child in the way
[1:01:18] it should go and and he prayed you know
[1:01:20] and on this side of the veil when you
[1:01:23] when you looked at at his life his life
[1:01:25] was amazing amazing on this side of the
[1:01:27] veil man the LI he he had it all
[1:01:29] together he had a family he had friends
[1:01:32] he had all kinds of wealth he he had the
[1:01:34] perfect family picture so to speak and
[1:01:36] and everybody on the outside was saying
[1:01:38] man that guy must be doing something
[1:01:40] right that that guy must be living right
[1:01:43] for God and everybody said man I wish I
[1:01:45] was job you know I wish I could be job
[1:01:48] job's got it all together I love how
[1:01:50] everything just goes right for job and
[1:01:52] his life is amazing but then one day God
[1:01:55] said if you can considered my servant
[1:01:57] job and and you know even Satan was
[1:02:00] looking on the wrong side of the veil
[1:02:03] because Satan would begin to say well
[1:02:05] God the only reason that he worships you
[1:02:08] is because you give him this thing you
[1:02:10] give him that thing everything in life
[1:02:12] goes well for him and you know Satan was
[1:02:15] looking at that saying you only serve
[1:02:16] him you put a hedge around him and
[1:02:18] everything he wants but see God wasn't
[1:02:21] looking at that Veil that Satan was
[1:02:23] looking at but God was looking Beyond
[1:02:26] another Veil can I say a veil within a
[1:02:28] veil and and he was looking on the
[1:02:30] inside of job and when Satan was looking
[1:02:33] at the blessings in the thing of God God
[1:02:35] was looking at a predestinated seed on
[1:02:38] the inside of
[1:02:42] job he knew what job was made
[1:02:46] of but Satan attacks and the the Sheep
[1:02:49] die and the servants die and the
[1:02:51] children die and then next thing you
[1:02:54] know you know you think that's the end
[1:02:55] of of the trial you know we get bad call
[1:02:57] every now and then and he gets four in
[1:02:59] one day and the next thing you know
[1:03:02] Satan goes back before him and said and
[1:03:04] the Lord said unto Satan hast thou
[1:03:05] considered my servant job that there is
[1:03:07] none like him in the earth a perfect man
[1:03:09] and upright man one that fearth God and
[1:03:11] shth Evil and still he holdeth fast his
[1:03:14] intey although thou movest me against
[1:03:17] him to destroy him without cause and
[1:03:19] Satan answer and SL said skin for skin
[1:03:22] yeah all that a man hath will he give
[1:03:24] for his life but for put forth his hand
[1:03:27] now and touch his bone and his flesh and
[1:03:30] he will curse thee to thy face and the
[1:03:32] Lord said unto Satan behold he is in thy
[1:03:34] hand but save his life so it went Satan
[1:03:37] forth from the presence of the Lord and
[1:03:39] smoked job with a sore boils from so of
[1:03:42] his foot all the way to his CR and he
[1:03:44] took him uh he took him a posture to
[1:03:48] scrape him with all and he sat down
[1:03:51] among the ashes and now listen here so
[1:03:53] now what we have here is not only as his
[1:03:56] family gone and not only not only is all
[1:03:59] of the things that that he holds
[1:04:01] material on this side now his very
[1:04:03] health is beginning to dwindle and Satan
[1:04:06] is beginning to attack his health why
[1:04:08] because God said if you considered my
[1:04:10] servant job and so now he's sitting
[1:04:13] there with some pottery and he's
[1:04:14] scraping the Bulls off of his skin and
[1:04:17] he's sitting there on the ashes of
[1:04:18] everything that he had and he's sitting
[1:04:20] there scraping the Bulls off of his skin
[1:04:23] and if that's not bad enough his wife
[1:04:25] looking on the other side of the veil
[1:04:28] okay looking on the other side of the
[1:04:30] veil she begins to say look job God has
[1:04:33] taking everything from you he he he he
[1:04:35] took your he took your house he took
[1:04:37] your kids he took he took everything
[1:04:39] from you why don't you just curse your
[1:04:42] God and die and even his friends show up
[1:04:45] to try to give him support but while
[1:04:47] they're there they're looking on the
[1:04:49] other side of the
[1:04:51] veil and they begin to say job you must
[1:04:54] be a secret sinner
[1:04:56] [Applause]
[1:04:58] it they come up with their own
[1:05:00] conclusion that that job you must be a
[1:05:03] secret sinner because all these bad
[1:05:05] things are happening to you but and you
[1:05:08] know all those things looking around you
[1:05:10] can't tell me that job wasn't distressed
[1:05:12] you can't tell me that job didn't know
[1:05:14] what was going on or wasn't worried what
[1:05:15] was going on but there was still
[1:05:17] something an anchor on the inside of job
[1:05:21] when his wife begin to say curse your
[1:05:23] God and die something on the inside died
[1:05:26] just like that anchor that wouldn't be
[1:05:28] moved even though none of these things
[1:05:30] move me as it says in the book of Acts
[1:05:33] and he said none of these things move me
[1:05:35] and he began to look at his wife and
[1:05:36] said you speak like a foolish
[1:05:40] woman what did that an
[1:05:44] anchor but he said there thou speakest
[1:05:47] as one of the fullish women what shall
[1:05:49] we receive good at the hand of God and
[1:05:51] shall we not receive evil and all this
[1:05:54] did job not sin with his lips oh
[1:05:58] Hallelujah but in the middle of job's
[1:06:01] trial when job's going through his
[1:06:03] greatest trial God begins to pull back
[1:06:05] the veil and he begins to tell job job I
[1:06:08] want to show you where your anchor is
[1:06:10] placed I want to show you why you're not
[1:06:13] falling I want to show you why you're
[1:06:15] still standing and he begin to say Where
[1:06:17] Were You job when the sons of God
[1:06:20] shouted for Joy where were you see his
[1:06:23] anchor went past this flesh fail but it
[1:06:26] went all the way back to Eternity in the
[1:06:29] mind of almighty God come what may he
[1:06:32] was
[1:06:35] anchored Hallelujah he got such a
[1:06:38] revelation that at that moment he be to
[1:06:40] say I know my redeemer
[1:06:46] liveth but there is no listen the story
[1:06:50] don't in there just because you're going
[1:06:53] through a trial listen in the Book of
[1:06:54] Ecclesiastes says he makes everything
[1:06:57] beautiful in his timing for everything
[1:07:00] there is a purpose under there's a
[1:07:02] season There's A Time to Kill You know
[1:07:04] the whole scripture is all these things
[1:07:05] see job was just going through a season
[1:07:08] but it never changed the fact he was a
[1:07:12] son and God will make even in your
[1:07:15] darkest trial in your worst hours in the
[1:07:17] thing that you're going through God is
[1:07:19] going to make something beautiful he
[1:07:22] gives you an anchor to hold on through
[1:07:24] the trial but when you you come through
[1:07:26] the trial God's going to make it
[1:07:28] beautiful each and every
[1:07:32] time if you stand for him he'll stand
[1:07:35] for
[1:07:35] you and he gave back job twice of
[1:07:39] everything that he had and restored him
[1:07:41] his own
[1:07:43] children and you know what he did it
[1:07:46] because job had an anchor that he didn't
[1:07:49] even put there by himself but almighty
[1:07:51] God put it
[1:07:53] there we think too much of ourselves
[1:07:56] sometimes you ain't the one holding
[1:07:58] yourself you ain't the one that kept you
[1:08:00] here but almighty God
[1:08:03] [Music]
[1:08:04] [Applause]
[1:08:07] did every Christian believer has to be
[1:08:10] pushed into those
[1:08:11] [Applause]
[1:08:16] trials every Christian believer has to
[1:08:18] be put on the ash
[1:08:20] Heap so that he can come forth with an
[1:08:23] experience I know
[1:08:26] when you gave your heart to the Lord you
[1:08:28] thought you
[1:08:30] knew but after you came through a trial
[1:08:33] that you thought there ain't no way I
[1:08:34] could ever make it through this trial
[1:08:36] and God brought you out you came out
[1:08:38] saying I
[1:08:41] know brother bam says now to be a
[1:08:43] Christian you have to be the same we
[1:08:45] don't want to forget that all that he
[1:08:47] was I'm identified with him I'm identify
[1:08:49] with him notice he is in me and I in him
[1:08:52] notice in every Christian that's a real
[1:08:55] genuine Christian was with him when the
[1:08:57] morning Stars sang together oh
[1:09:00] Hallelujah and the sons of God shouted
[1:09:03] for Joy before there was a foundation of
[1:09:05] the world Hallelujah where is your
[1:09:07] anchor tonight before the foundation of
[1:09:10] the world we were identified in the
[1:09:13] immortal Realms with God 10 million
[1:09:15] years before the world was ever formed
[1:09:17] if I can say this and it's all right you
[1:09:19] had an anchor before you ever had a
[1:09:21] problem you had an anchor before you
[1:09:23] ever came up to a trial God God already
[1:09:25] knew you before the foundation of the
[1:09:27] world he said he was the lamb slain
[1:09:29] before the foundation of the world do
[1:09:32] you realize you had an anchor before the
[1:09:34] foundation of the world when he wrote
[1:09:37] your name on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:09:39] Hallelujah before the foundation of the
[1:09:41] world already an
[1:09:49] anchor 10 million years 10 million years
[1:09:54] before the world was form I was back
[1:09:57] there with him if I've got eternal life
[1:10:00] oh can I say if I've got an anchor I was
[1:10:03] there with him I was identified with him
[1:10:05] when the morning Stars sang together and
[1:10:08] the sons of God shouted for Joy he
[1:10:10] showed job your anchor ain't here buddy
[1:10:13] but your anchor is in eternity and I
[1:10:15] wonder if before job ever got well I
[1:10:17] wonder if before the skin the the boils
[1:10:20] ever left his hands you could look over
[1:10:22] and a man that was just being persecuted
[1:10:24] and put down and called a sinner here
[1:10:26] comes a man with blls with his hands
[1:10:28] raised up saying thank you
[1:10:30] [Applause]
[1:10:36] God I can see job with all his boils and
[1:10:39] tears and heart this is me and heartache
[1:10:41] he begins to raise his hands and say I
[1:10:43] know my redeemer liveth he had an anchor
[1:10:45] that went past what everyone else could
[1:10:47] see his wife couldn't see the anchor
[1:10:50] curse him as die his friends couldn't
[1:10:51] see it you're a sinner Jo but job knew
[1:10:54] and he grabbed that anchor had
[1:10:56] grabbed
[1:10:58] Hallelujah you are not excused from
[1:11:00] trials but you have a blessed anchor a
[1:11:03] Blessed Assurance I think of the Hebrew
[1:11:05] children when they were going through
[1:11:07] the fire listen you know why they went
[1:11:09] through the fire cuz they stood for God
[1:11:11] it wasn't because they were a bunch of
[1:11:12] Sinners a bunch of a bunch of
[1:11:14] backsliders but they said we don't care
[1:11:16] what you're going to do Hallelujah can I
[1:11:18] just say this to Seth coffee I don't
[1:11:20] care what they say about the message out
[1:11:22] there for me and my house we will serve
[1:11:24] the Lord they can say the days of
[1:11:26] Miracles has passed but for me in my
[1:11:28] house we will serve the Lord and they
[1:11:30] made a decree go out there and God said
[1:11:33] have you have you considered my three
[1:11:35] Hebrew children oh Hallelujah they will
[1:11:38] not bow they will not bend the knee to
[1:11:41] that economical system they will not be
[1:11:43] in the need of those denominational
[1:11:46] ideas have you considered my Hebrew
[1:11:50] children they said heat it up seven
[1:11:52] times hotter hallelujah we're in the
[1:11:54] worst age that there ever was they said
[1:11:57] heat it up seven times hard but it
[1:11:59] didn't change the
[1:12:00] anchor situations don't change the
[1:12:03] anchor they begin they begin to go for
[1:12:05] that CR King and he said you know what's
[1:12:07] going to happen to you you're going to
[1:12:08] be burned up and they said you know what
[1:12:10] we know one thing our God is
[1:12:15] able our God is able and he can deliver
[1:12:19] us if he wants to but even if he don't
[1:12:21] The Anchor Holds even if he don't the
[1:12:25] Anchor Holds we ain't moving off of our
[1:12:27] revelation we ain't moving off what we
[1:12:29] believe our God is the one true Living
[1:12:32] God and we don't care what you say hey
[1:12:35] why don't you go ahead and eat up eight
[1:12:36] times hot or 10 it don't matter to
[1:12:38] us we are God's
[1:12:42] children Hallelujah but if you stand for
[1:12:45] God God will stand for you as he begin
[1:12:48] to walk into that fire that King begin
[1:12:51] to say who is that fourth one in the
[1:12:53] fire that fourth was the
[1:12:57] [Applause]
[1:13:03] anchor Paul had an
[1:13:06] anchor I hope y'all realize tonight this
[1:13:08] ain't a different
[1:13:10] anchor the same anchor that Paul had you
[1:13:14] know one day he must have been sitting
[1:13:15] there in jail and he began to think
[1:13:17] about the Church of the Living God that
[1:13:19] he persecuted in the church that he put
[1:13:21] down Satan began to tell him man you've
[1:13:24] went too far he began to tell Paul you
[1:13:26] know Paul you'll never be good enough
[1:13:28] Paul you shouldn't even be doing this
[1:13:30] Paul you should give up Paul you done
[1:13:31] this Paul you done that but then he
[1:13:33] began to remember on the road to
[1:13:35] Damascus one day when he was sitting
[1:13:37] there and he wasn't even looking for
[1:13:38] Jesus but Jesus came looking for
[1:13:40] [Applause]
[1:13:43] [Music]
[1:13:44] him who are you Lord I am Jesus and he
[1:13:48] began to think you know what I didn't go
[1:13:50] looking for Jesus but Jesus came looking
[1:13:52] for me and if Jesus came looking for me
[1:13:55] then Jesus must want me and something
[1:13:57] anchored in his heart he said who shall
[1:13:59] separate us from the love of Christ
[1:14:02] shall tribulation or distress or
[1:14:04] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:14:06] Peril or sword that is written for thy
[1:14:08] sake we are killed all the day long
[1:14:10] listen it ain't that there ain't
[1:14:11] problems it ain't that there ain't
[1:14:12] trials but by God's grace there's an
[1:14:16] anchor all the day long as sheep for the
[1:14:18] slauter name and all these things
[1:14:20] somebody say all these things all these
[1:14:22] things somebody say all these things
[1:14:31] we nay in all these things we are more
[1:14:35] than conquerors through him that loved
[1:14:38] us for I am
[1:14:40] persuaded I am persuaded that neither
[1:14:42] death nor life nor angels nor
[1:14:44] principalities nor powers nor things
[1:14:46] present nor things to come nor height
[1:14:50] nor depth you know then when you get a
[1:14:52] little deeper in the water you just let
[1:14:53] out a little more line for that ain't
[1:14:56] nor any other creature shall be able to
[1:14:58] separate us from the love of God which
[1:14:59] is in Christ Jesus our lord Hallelujah
[1:15:02] church if you can look at Paul and Silas
[1:15:05] listen they ain't got a different Holy
[1:15:06] Ghost they ain't got a different God but
[1:15:08] the same God of Paul and Silas and is
[1:15:11] the same God that we serve and I tell
[1:15:13] you what I'm glad to have that same
[1:15:15] anchor I I don't I don't I don't like
[1:15:17] just looking back and saying well that
[1:15:19] was for the apostles I'm glad to have an
[1:15:21] anchor to know that if God did that for
[1:15:23] them God can do that for
[1:15:25] me you know I've got that Paul I I don't
[1:15:28] know about y'all but but I've had that
[1:15:30] Paul and Silas anchor when when
[1:15:32] everything was was closed up around me
[1:15:34] and and I was just beaten and put down
[1:15:37] and and everybody putting me down and
[1:15:39] putting me out and telling me I was no
[1:15:40] good and that Old Devil coming around
[1:15:42] saying you know you don't you don't
[1:15:44] deserve to be here you don't belong to
[1:15:45] be here and you know I'm sitting there
[1:15:47] and that but all of a sudden I begin to
[1:15:49] remember back to a time when I was a 14
[1:15:52] 15 year old boy and I was sitting at an
[1:15:54] altar one night and God came down and
[1:15:56] touched my heart and put an anchor in
[1:15:58] there and I begin to think on that you
[1:16:01] know I begin to think that I begin to
[1:16:02] think God's been so good to me God's
[1:16:05] done so much for me God's took care of
[1:16:08] me and if I can bear a little bit of
[1:16:10] this for his name sake I'm glad to do it
[1:16:13] and that same anchor that is in Paul and
[1:16:15] Silas is the same anchor that's in me
[1:16:17] that when things come around me and it
[1:16:19] gets so bad and I don't know where to
[1:16:21] look and I don't know how I'm going to
[1:16:22] get out I hear a little song coming on a
[1:16:25] little something in my heart begins to
[1:16:27] sink what is it that anchor grabs a hold
[1:16:29] that in the middle of my trial I can
[1:16:32] begin to say my chains are gone I've
[1:16:34] been set free Oh Amazing Grace how sweet
[1:16:37] the sound that saved a wret like me I've
[1:16:41] got that same anchor and you've got that
[1:16:44] anchor how many times have you gave up
[1:16:46] how many times have you quit and you
[1:16:48] said I'll never go back to that church
[1:16:51] again but something on the inside
[1:16:56] brother Stephen you said that's the last
[1:16:57] service I'll preach I ain't ever going
[1:16:59] to preach again but then an anchor grabs
[1:17:01] hold and says get back over here you
[1:17:04] weren't called to give up you weren't
[1:17:07] called to give in but you're called to
[1:17:09] stand doing all to stand therefore
[1:17:13] [Applause]
[1:17:17] stand he got so much of an anchor that
[1:17:20] one day he begin to say oh death where
[1:17:23] is your sting at anyway ways brother
[1:17:26] brandom said that one day Lord Jesus he
[1:17:29] was sitting there and death was buzzing
[1:17:30] around him and that Satan anchored
[1:17:33] Hallelujah Satan anchored that stinger
[1:17:36] in Jesus and he thought he could pull it
[1:17:38] right back out but when he tried to pull
[1:17:40] it out he realized this Stinger was
[1:17:43] gone this anchor is made out of nothing
[1:17:46] less than the lovely Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:49] we are Anchored In Christ the
[1:17:52] word and he knew when Jesus said it is
[1:17:55] finished and he knew when he went down
[1:17:57] and Rose back to life again Paul said
[1:18:00] death is finished it's finished
[1:18:03] Hallelujah and he said oh death where is
[1:18:05] thy sting oh gra where is thy
[1:18:09] Victory it can take its punches it can
[1:18:12] do what it wants to you know there
[1:18:14] there's what they call boxing matches
[1:18:16] and different things and these people
[1:18:18] will trade licks and you know it can
[1:18:20] have so many different hits but the
[1:18:22] champion of that fight is is the one
[1:18:25] that that the champion of that fight
[1:18:27] might get hit but he's not defeated he's
[1:18:30] a champion and our Lord is a champion
[1:18:33] let me tell you you might take hits you
[1:18:34] might take you might take some licks
[1:18:36] from the old devil when he's trying to
[1:18:38] knock you down but he ain't got no
[1:18:42] Victory thanks be to God which gives a
[1:18:44] victory to our Lord Jesus Christ see
[1:18:46] we're Anchored In The Right Stuff Beyond
[1:18:49] the Veil we are anchored in the right
[1:18:52] stuff but you see I I'm going to but you
[1:18:55] know the reason listen I I mean I don't
[1:18:59] know how else to say this but I've been
[1:19:02] you know I'm almost 30 years old by the
[1:19:05] grace of God and you know I've been I've
[1:19:08] been serving the lord since I was 14
[1:19:10] years old 15 145 right there was my
[1:19:12] birthday when I was coming from 14 to
[1:19:15] 15 and you know in that
[1:19:18] time I have seen
[1:19:21] things I have seen people that you
[1:19:23] thought uhuh would be there
[1:19:26] forever I seen people that I thought and
[1:19:30] knew I said man these people are better
[1:19:31] people than
[1:19:33] me and these people will be here until
[1:19:36] the Rapture
[1:19:37] [Applause]
[1:19:38] comes but those people and I'm not
[1:19:41] picking on anybody you understand that I
[1:19:43] love everybody and I want if there's any
[1:19:45] Mercy for anybody let mercy be
[1:19:49] given but there was people in my life
[1:19:51] that that I would look up so much to and
[1:19:54] and even even if I can say this and this
[1:19:56] is okay in in in in my early in the
[1:19:59] early times 14 15 16 years old I would
[1:20:02] begin to Anchor myself in people and and
[1:20:06] I would I would anchor I would anchor
[1:20:09] myself in a preacher and I would look up
[1:20:12] and and I would say man brother brother
[1:20:14] Steven's got it all together and I'd try
[1:20:16] to Anchor myself in
[1:20:18] [Music]
[1:20:18] [Applause]
[1:20:20] [Music]
[1:20:21] Steven I love you
[1:20:23] brother but if we're not careful you
[1:20:26] begin to try to Anchor yourself and well
[1:20:28] this is a nice church and and you throw
[1:20:31] out your anchor and and you'll begin to
[1:20:33] say well you know the spirit of God
[1:20:35] moves well here and that's fine you try
[1:20:36] to throw your anchor in a building or
[1:20:38] you try to throw your anchor in a
[1:20:40] personality and you know what I've
[1:20:41] noticed every man that ever lifts
[1:20:43] himself up or gets lifted up for the
[1:20:45] people are determined to fall and I seen
[1:20:48] people that you see the reason that
[1:20:51] people fall that you never thought would
[1:20:53] fall was because they were never
[1:20:55] anchored Beyond the
[1:20:57] Veil they threw out an anchor listen let
[1:21:00] me tell you something see I I don't know
[1:21:03] what what you're anchored in I believe
[1:21:05] you're Anchored In Christ but I I don't
[1:21:07] know what you're anchored in you know
[1:21:08] why there's a
[1:21:10] veil you can tell me you're made of
[1:21:12] stuff that don't Bluff and all that but
[1:21:14] but I don't know what you're anchored in
[1:21:17] and you know why it's because it's
[1:21:18] beyond a veil but listen if you're if
[1:21:20] you're in if you're in a boat this is
[1:21:23] all free I don't know where this is
[1:21:24] coming from but if you're in a boat and
[1:21:26] you're in 20t of water and you throw out
[1:21:29] an anchor 10t deep it's Beyond the Veil
[1:21:33] you see people throw Beyond the Veil
[1:21:35] they don't know where it's anchored in
[1:21:37] but they never went deep enough they
[1:21:41] never got deep enough to where that
[1:21:42] anchor could come in and grab a hold of
[1:21:45] something so you know what happened that
[1:21:47] boat never Stood Still That boat never
[1:21:50] stood in that place listen that boat
[1:21:52] could have stood there as long as the
[1:21:54] wind was calm and nothing was going on
[1:21:57] and everything was fine they could say
[1:22:00] blessed be the Lord long as their bills
[1:22:02] was paid they could say blessed be the
[1:22:04] Lord but then one day before they knew
[1:22:07] it they ran into Shore or they hit a big
[1:22:10] wave and they realized I wasn't anchored
[1:22:13] into anything see it was beyond the veil
[1:22:16] so we couldn't tell what they were
[1:22:17] anchored in but they never got deep
[1:22:20] enough but on the other side of that if
[1:22:23] you ever get get that anchor deep enough
[1:22:26] and you ever throw it down there into a
[1:22:28] rock can I call it the Rock of Ages
[1:22:31] Cliff for me and you get in there in
[1:22:34] that mountain let the wind
[1:22:36] blow let the storms
[1:22:39] rage people might look at you they might
[1:22:43] be sitting on the bank looking out there
[1:22:44] at that boat and say that boat will
[1:22:46] never make it through that storm but
[1:22:48] brother Brandon said you know when they
[1:22:50] let that anchors down it don't go over
[1:22:52] the wave it goes through the
[1:22:57] wave I'm just going to say it brother I
[1:22:59] got to be plain you know I've seen I I
[1:23:02] I've been involved in in in false
[1:23:05] Doctrine I I've I've been involved with
[1:23:07] with people that walked away that I
[1:23:08] never thought would walk away I've been
[1:23:12] hurt I've been talked about I've been
[1:23:15] mistreated I I've had so many people
[1:23:18] talk about me and Seth coffee in my
[1:23:20] flesh I have said many times brother I
[1:23:23] say I
[1:23:25] quit I have quit preaching more times
[1:23:28] than you can count I said I will never
[1:23:31] preach again I I'll never step behind
[1:23:34] that pull pit again I I ain't never
[1:23:36] doing that again as soon as I try to
[1:23:38] walk
[1:23:43] away if that's the way Isaiah's going to
[1:23:46] treat me well then we just ain't got no
[1:23:48] friend brother I'm sorry for how I felt
[1:23:51] about you I'm sorry for you see there's
[1:23:54] a anchor there that is greater than
[1:23:58] you when you realize that grieve not the
[1:24:02] Holy
[1:24:03] Spirit whereby you are
[1:24:06] sealed until the day of your
[1:24:09] Redemption brother brandham says
[1:24:11] anchored in the wrong things here he
[1:24:12] said a man or a woman just in philosophy
[1:24:15] or joining church or something like that
[1:24:17] you're not anchored yet you would take
[1:24:19] your letter from one Church to the
[1:24:23] other I mean to pick but we've seen that
[1:24:25] so many times from one place to another
[1:24:28] but if you take the real absolute Christ
[1:24:31] anchor yourself in that don't make any
[1:24:33] difference what comes or goes you're
[1:24:35] still anchored and what the Christian
[1:24:38] needs today in this atomic age in this
[1:24:40] time of in uncertainty you need
[1:24:43] something just besides an experience of
[1:24:45] joining Church you need an anchor an
[1:24:48] absolute that you know because churches
[1:24:52] will fail that's right yes sir I should
[1:24:55] get an amen on that churches will
[1:24:59] fail people will
[1:25:02] fail but Christ cannot
[1:25:07] fail he's the absolute to the believer
[1:25:10] and if Christ is your absolute you're
[1:25:12] tied to
[1:25:15] him and if he is your absolute you're
[1:25:17] tied to him then you're tied to the
[1:25:20] word what he say heavens and earth shall
[1:25:23] pass away
[1:25:24] but my word shall never you are a part
[1:25:29] of something that'll never pass
[1:25:31] [Applause]
[1:25:33] [Music]
[1:25:34] [Applause]
[1:25:36] away
[1:25:40] church it's
[1:25:44] anchor it's
[1:25:46] Anchor Church I just I haven't been
[1:25:49] through as much as some people but I've
[1:25:53] been through a lot
[1:25:57] and I was sitting there thinking this is
[1:25:58] my own words and and you know brother
[1:26:01] Steven always says just be at home
[1:26:03] that's it that's it
[1:26:05] right church I have gotten so many
[1:26:10] times where I thought I cannot go one
[1:26:12] more
[1:26:15] step but something keeps holding
[1:26:19] me does anybody else ever felt that way
[1:26:22] [Music]
[1:26:25] I've tried you know and and I'll come to
[1:26:27] God and fix my tide just
[1:26:30] right and I'll go I'm going to pray my
[1:26:33] way out of this hope this is all right
[1:26:35] I'm seing from my heart I'll come to a
[1:26:38] place where I say I'm going to do
[1:26:39] something about this I'm going to get
[1:26:42] myself out of this and I believe in
[1:26:44] taking the right steps towards God but
[1:26:46] if you ever feel like you can do it on
[1:26:47] your own you are in a bad
[1:26:49] place I'll get to a place where I say I
[1:26:52] can fix this I I can get my myself out
[1:26:54] of this and I'll come like a holy
[1:26:59] Pharisee I hope it's all right just to
[1:27:01] be honest I think church is a good place
[1:27:03] to be
[1:27:04] honest you you can you can stop trying
[1:27:07] to pretend to fool
[1:27:09] everybody we come to a place and oh
[1:27:13] Father holy God I don't mean this
[1:27:15] disrespectful but Oh Holy Father God you
[1:27:18] know all these different things and the
[1:27:21] relationship of me without him I'm
[1:27:24] nothing
[1:27:26] that's I have never preached one sermon
[1:27:29] I have never sung one song but
[1:27:31] everything that could ever be done was
[1:27:33] because of his grace in my
[1:27:37] life but I
[1:27:39] realize when I come to the end of myself
[1:27:43] that's and I go God I'm done I give
[1:27:48] up that's when God can use
[1:27:52] me when I get to a place where I say God
[1:27:55] I'm surrendering all this and all my
[1:27:58] righteousness is nothing but filthy
[1:28:00] rags brother brandom and I feel that tug
[1:28:05] but you see I can't see it but brother
[1:28:06] Brandon told a story about a kid flying
[1:28:08] a
[1:28:09] kite and he had a kite so high up in the
[1:28:12] sky you couldn't even see it and a man
[1:28:15] came
[1:28:16] [Applause]
[1:28:17] by and he said son what are you doing he
[1:28:21] said I'm flying a kite he said well I
[1:28:24] don't see no kite he said yeah I don't
[1:28:26] either but I feel it's
[1:28:28] pool and church all the times I've
[1:28:31] wanted to give up all the times I've
[1:28:33] wanted to give in I still I couldn't
[1:28:36] give in no matter how hard I tried to
[1:28:38] walk away or whatever it was I would
[1:28:40] feel a tug and something begin to pull
[1:28:42] me back in the right direction and
[1:28:44] before I know it my heart would begin to
[1:28:46] cry out and something on the inside a
[1:28:49] deep C of the deep would begin to happen
[1:28:52] and something on the inside would begin
[1:28:54] to come out of me and I'd say I know my
[1:28:56] redeemer
[1:29:00] liveth brother brandom says this and
[1:29:02] couple more things here and I'll
[1:29:04] close he said the hardest hour I ever
[1:29:07] struck in my life just give you a
[1:29:10] personal
[1:29:11] testimony he said I went into a room of
[1:29:14] my dying
[1:29:18] baby there I'd been a gospel preacher
[1:29:20] for about six years remember see doing
[1:29:23] the right thing
[1:29:25] not doing the wrong thing but doing the
[1:29:27] right
[1:29:28] thing about 6 years I stood there by my
[1:29:31] baby they wouldn't let me go in I didn't
[1:29:33] it didn't want me to go in but I slipped
[1:29:35] in and it was down in a basement in an
[1:29:38] isolated Ward and he said flies got in
[1:29:40] the little eyes of my baby and I shed
[1:29:43] the flies out and put a little net over
[1:29:46] it and I looked at the little thing and
[1:29:48] I said Sharon do you know your
[1:29:51] daddy and she suffered so hard to her
[1:29:54] little baby blue eyes had
[1:29:57] crossed my heart was
[1:29:59] gripped her mother was laying in the
[1:30:02] morg that night before I got down on my
[1:30:04] knees I said Heavenly Father what have I
[1:30:06] done to deserve
[1:30:08] this he said will you spare my baby oh
[1:30:11] blessed Lord please
[1:30:13] do and it looked like a black sheep come
[1:30:16] folding unfolding like that just shutter
[1:30:19] off from my
[1:30:21] view he absolutely
[1:30:24] refus to hear my
[1:30:28] prayer I stood up at her and I looked at
[1:30:30] her and I knew she was gone and he said
[1:30:34] Satan came to me and said will you serve
[1:30:38] him
[1:30:41] now which one of
[1:30:44] you which one of you in your human
[1:30:51] ability nobody

[1:31:15] will you serve him he said that was the
[1:31:18] most cruestv
[1:31:24] and what had I done nothing as I know of
[1:31:27] I said God reveal it to me and I'll make
[1:31:29] it
[1:31:30] right but every
[1:31:32] son that cometh to God sir must be
[1:31:35] chastened and tried Hallelujah then all
[1:31:38] of a sudden I was left alone to make my
[1:31:42] decision I put my hand over her little
[1:31:44] head and I said Sherry honey the angels
[1:31:47] are coming to take you home Daddy will
[1:31:49] pack you your little body down yonder
[1:31:51] and lay it in the arms of Mama and I

[1:31:55] graveyard Hill but some glorious day
[1:31:59] daddy will see you again I raised my
[1:32:01] hands and I said Lord if you slay me yet
[1:32:05] I will trust you I love you and he said
[1:32:09] a great peace come over something
[1:32:11] sitting down over me this is another
[1:32:14] quote that I add to the bottom of that
[1:32:15] same thing he's talking about he said
[1:32:17] here's some time ago I'd lost my family
[1:32:19] and everything someone met
[1:32:22] me this is my
[1:32:24] testimony someone met me and said

[1:33:54] there's times when God says
[1:33:57] no you know one of the greatest
[1:34:00] experiences and one of the hardest
[1:34:02] Trials of my life is when God said

[1:34:10] [Music]
[1:34:16] God and I you know we had uh I'm just
[1:34:19] going to preach from the heart here for
[1:34:20] a minute and you for you forgive me
[1:34:22] Hallelujah all right
[1:34:26] right and I remember uh you know we had
[1:34:29] little Jolie and then we had
[1:34:32] Lawson but in
[1:34:34] between Jolie and Lawson me and my wife
[1:34:38] my wife got pregnant we were so
[1:34:41] excited to have another
[1:34:44] baby
[1:34:46] and you know we just same routine you
[1:34:49] know you thank God for what he's done
[1:34:52] Lord we thank you that your blessing is
[1:34:54] with another child in this
[1:34:56] family and you have all these
[1:34:58] expectations and the things oh what the
[1:35:01] child going to be like what's this
[1:35:02] what's
[1:35:04] that you're sitting there with all these
[1:35:06] different expectations in your
[1:35:09] heart and we go to the doctor for our
[1:35:12] first ultrasound and I know this is
[1:35:14] early but if you ever I don't care early
[1:35:16] or late you ever lose one it does
[1:35:18] something to
[1:35:19] you and and and the doctor the the the
[1:35:23] technician begin to do that and when
[1:35:26] when she began to do that scan that
[1:35:28] ultrasound she said you could see that
[1:35:31] something wasn't right and she began to
[1:35:33] say well I can't find a
[1:35:36] heartbeat and you know the thing about
[1:35:38] it
[1:35:40] was I immediately began to have
[1:35:43] faith that everything was going to be
[1:35:46] all
[1:35:47] right you
[1:35:49] see just before
[1:35:51] that the week before
[1:35:54] brother Steven I had preached a sermon
[1:35:56] and I don't know if brother Isaiah
[1:35:57] remembers this or not but it was in the
[1:35:59] gym and I preached remember he's still
[1:36:02] the master of the
[1:36:04] wind and when I preach that sermon I I I
[1:36:09] I don't I I won't get the numbers
[1:36:11] exactly right but you just bear with me
[1:36:13] but when I preached that
[1:36:15] sermon there was probably 11 or 12
[1:36:18] different people that came up for
[1:36:20] prayer and I watch the power of God God
[1:36:24] come down in that service brother Steven
[1:36:26] so strong I seen a family whose husband
[1:36:30] that that got out of church God restored
[1:36:32] that man back into that church just the
[1:36:34] next week went out and got him and
[1:36:36] brought him back I seen depression cast
[1:36:38] out I can say that every single
[1:36:42] person that came up for prayer that
[1:36:45] night when we laid hands on then and
[1:36:47] prayed for them whatever their situation
[1:36:49] was they got what they asked
[1:36:52] for and so I'm coming off of that sermon
[1:36:54] of that extreme
[1:36:57] faith that anointing of I know God is
[1:37:00] able he's still the master of the wind
[1:37:03] so we call everybody and we're we we
[1:37:06] Proclaim and testimony that we're going
[1:37:08] to have this baby and God's going to
[1:37:10] touch this
[1:37:11] baby
[1:37:13] yes and I feel in my heart I said oh God
[1:37:16] I just I know you I trust
[1:37:19] you and we went back for the ultrasound
[1:37:22] and they said we're sorry
[1:37:25] there's no
[1:37:27] heartbeat and that shook me so much
[1:37:32] because I can tell you I had the faith
[1:37:34] for it you don't have to believe me but
[1:37:37] I had the faith for
[1:37:39] it I believed it with all my heart but
[1:37:42] God said
[1:37:45] no and I was so tore up in my
[1:37:49] heart and I tried to go to church and my
[1:37:52] wife was so d all just tore all to
[1:37:55] pieces and and I went back to church and
[1:37:58] I tried to worship God but I I couldn't
[1:38:00] hardly worship God because there was
[1:38:02] something in my mind going why
[1:38:05] God why I'm being honest from my heart
[1:38:08] here
[1:38:09] tonight I said why God would you touch
[1:38:12] all these
[1:38:14] people and then my
[1:38:18] baby and I went through that
[1:38:21] and and I remember I probably went
[1:38:24] through three or four weeks of just
[1:38:26] crying my eyes out saying God why God
[1:38:30] why and my my buddy Malachi I'll never
[1:38:33] forget that first time back to church
[1:38:34] and I was crying my eyes out on the
[1:38:37] front row and he came up and gave me a
[1:38:39] hug like Jesus just coming up and you
[1:38:41] know what those are like and I was
[1:38:43] sitting there and I was so distraught
[1:38:45] and I I was sitting there going God why
[1:38:49] and there was such a part of me that
[1:38:50] just wanted to say as brother Brandon
[1:38:53] said well fast the way he's going to
[1:38:54] treat me I'm not comparing my situation
[1:38:57] to brother brandom's but understanding
[1:38:58] my own
[1:39:00] walk and you know I remember I went
[1:39:02] through that week after week after a
[1:39:04] week after week and I was crying and I
[1:39:06] was crying and I was asking God why why
[1:39:10] why then I said pastor I got to have a
[1:39:13] meeting with you and I began to tell
[1:39:16] them all that I said why did God allow
[1:39:20] all these people
[1:39:23] to get healed or touched or
[1:39:25] delivered and I came to him and I had
[1:39:29] faith that God was going to restore that
[1:39:32] child yes and
[1:39:35] yet he didn't
[1:39:37] answer and he said Seth I don't have the
[1:39:41] answers for stuff like
[1:39:43] that he said but I want to ask you one
[1:39:48] question do you
[1:39:50] believe God knows what what
[1:39:58] best this
[1:40:02] flesh this flesh scream wanted to scream
[1:40:05] out so bad if that's the way he's going
[1:40:07] to treat me no my spirit was so
[1:40:12] distraught that I just wanted to run out
[1:40:14] of there and say forget all
[1:40:18] this but thank God
[1:40:21] [Music]
[1:40:24] something on the inside of the
[1:40:28] inside when I wanted to quit when I
[1:40:30] wanted to say no when I wanted to walk
[1:40:34] away Something in My Heart screamed out
[1:40:38] yes I
[1:40:41] do that's the anchor I'm talking
[1:40:45] about when you come to your
[1:40:48] end and even when your flesh gives up
[1:40:51] and your spirit is overwhelmed
[1:40:53] deep down in that
[1:40:56] Soul there's an anchor Beyond the
[1:41:00] Veil

[1:48:25] wife anything she's now hearing it from
[1:48:27] there I was just quiet I was like okay I
[1:48:30] know exactly Satan something happened to
[1:48:32] you because there are channels that have
[1:48:34] been open that are releasing the
[1:48:37] pressure from the children of God they
[1:48:40] have been carrying so many burden amen
[1:48:43] especially that part where God says no
[1:48:47] that's the one that the devil uses the
[1:48:49] most to challenge your faith when God
[1:48:53] say yes the devil have nothing he knows
[1:48:55] you're going to Anchor something right
[1:48:57] there and he's going to build your faith

[1:49:53] something that we have to live with it
[1:49:56] but Lord you came and you spoke to us
