minister into our hearts let everything be done for your glory and for your honor in jesus christ's name amen y'all may be seated as they gather the tithing offering i have a couple more songs here i'm going to do but i don't know if anybody has a special on their heart this evening if anybody has a special i didn't receive anything written on on paper but if anybody has a very special caleb all right we got caleb and while he's making his way up i i just wanted to give a quick testimony last wednesday or a couple a couple services ago was about over a month ago probably i went to our pastor and i told him i said i usually don't go to my pastor and ask him to pray with me about anything because i know he's got enough on his plate and i don't want to add to it but i told him that i had a really strong desire for something that i felt the lord said was mine and and it didn't look like it was possible and i told him i said if you could just pray with me about this because it's something that i really want and uh you know i believe it's mine and i just i don't know how i'm gonna get it but i believe that the thor can do great things so what it is it was it was a deal and it was under contract and uh like a real estate deal that was under contract by somebody else and and i was like i know the lord can move and i spoke to the lady and said if this person breaks this contract at all please come to me first and and whatever it takes and so about a month went by and i was talking to shango last wednesday and he uh he asked me i didn't say nothing about it but he just asked me he said did you get that deal yet and i was like no i i didn't forget about it but i kind of put it over to the side because it was under contract there's nothing that can be done and the lady got tired of me bugging her and said i'll get back to you if it comes open leave me alone so i was like i better leave her alone so when shingo brought that up i kind of it was kind of in the back part of my mind but i wasn't thinking too much about it well it was two days ago that the lady reached out to me and said that it's open if you're still interested and i'm willing to take offers and i got a partner we made some offers and it looks like we're going to be going under contract on it in a couple of days and i asked her i said what happened to the other buyer and she said he just just disappeared i was like he just disappeared and she's like yeah i haven't heard from him and the date on the contract went expired and he didn't say nothing to me so she's like i know you want it and you know i just feel like i should give it to you and as long as you know you can get an offer that works then we'll do that and i was like that's the lord that's the lord it was mine god knew it was mine and he just provided a way and i'm so grateful for it but where did caleb go there he is caleb come up [Music] god bless your sins i mean before i sing i just have a little testimony i want to give up for the group of the lord um yesterday i went to get a haircut with brother mike and i for the wedding down in columbia and on our way back there was a car beside us basically the wheel was already messed up the tire was already messed up and uh we're driving and we've seen it it was kind of shifting on the road and um i saw her first and then so but i'm like you know something's wrong with that driver but it was the car not the driver and then as we were passing the other corner on the right side i guess the tire just bust out the the time the drone got separated and he almost hit us by just me such a small inch he missed us so i just want to thank the lord for that it could have been a terrible accident but the handle was there for us and also um it's been over a year since the lord has brought me to this church i didn't want to say that i joined the church because i was born in the family of the god so you don't join a church you're born in a church amen so i just want to thank the lord for everything that has happened in this hotel his presence the word um it's been a blessing to me and just be able to you know do something for the lord in the service of the lord

to your hearts and minister to your needs i want to read from joshua chapter 24 and my wife and the folks from apostolic tabernacle are going to hear this for the second time but it's always different and i already know it's going to be different tonight just it's just god is so good i'm going to go to him in prayer just before we read his word and i'd like to also just ask you to remember brother

phillips he's been a great blessing to the body believers there and to the body of christ and so just join me in remembering him and his family this evening and believe in the lord and no many are suffering and we're in a great time of uh attack of the enemy right now but uh god is greater and so we're going to just trust it in his hands let's go to him in prayer lord jesus we thank you that you have blessed each of us with this privilege an opportunity to come and worship you this evening lord we want to just yield ourselves to you and for the holy spirit to have the preeminence lord in

to their reward and we ask you lord to prepare us for that great day lord if there be any tonight that is not ready is not sealed into your kingdom lord may the holy spirit convict their heart in jesus name we ask it amen amen joshua chapter 24. it's a little bit lengthy of reading but i i believe it'll be fine verse 1 and joshua called all the tribes of israel to shechem and called for the elders of israel and for their heads for their judges and for their officers and they presented themselves before god and joshua said unto all the people thus saith the lord god of israel your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time even terror the father of abraham and the father of nacor and they served other gods and i took your father abraham from the other side of the flood and led him throughout all the land of caden and multiplied his seed and gave him isaac and i gave unto isaac jacob and esau and i gave them to esau mount seir to possess it but jacob and his children went down into egypt i sent moses also and aaron and i plagued egypt according to that which i did among them and afterward i brought you out and i brought your fathers out of egypt and ye came unto the sea and the egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the red sea and when they cried unto the lord he put darkness between you and the egyptians and brought the sea upon them and covered them and your eyes have seen what i have done in egypt and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season and i brought you into the land of the amorites which dwelt on the other side jordan and they fought with you and i gave them into your hand that ye might possess their land and i destroyed them be from before you then balak the son of zipper king of moab arose and ward against israel and sit and called balaam the son of beor to curse you but i would not hearken unto balaam therefore he blessed you still so i delivered you out of his head and you went over jordan and came into jericho and the men of jericho fought against you the amorites and the perizzites and the canaanites and the hittites and the gergescites the haibites and the jebusites and i delivered them into your head it doesn't matter who's fighting against you tonight who's fighting for you that's where the key lies amen oh praise the lord and i sent the hornet before you which drave them out from before you even the two kings of the amorites but not with thy sword nor with thy bow but and i have given you a land for which ye did not labor and cities which ye built not and ye dwell in them of the vineyards and olives yards which he planted not do you eat now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in egypt and serve the lord and if it seems evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom ye will serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land he dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the lord amen may the lord bless his word tonight as you're seated amen i'm going to speak tonight on the power of a decision amen because i i believe i believe this was a showdown amen a joshua ministry calls the children of god to a showdown amen it's it's no long there's no two ways about this there's no three ways or amen there's either either god has done this or god hasn't done it and if god has done it we need to serve him and put away all the other gods amen you know it's hard for us to imagine how a people who have just experienced everything these people have experienced remember only uh only months before this they were slaves in egypt and had been there for 400 years serving as slaves they they had lost their identity they had lost their heritage amen everything they had was given to them by egyptians their all their entire life and their decisions was controlled by egyptians amen but one day god remembered his promise amen and he came down in the form of a prophetic ministry because he said i am come to hell and then when he spoke to moses in the pillar of fire brother garcia he said i am come down to deliver my people yes he used a man yes he used a prophet but it was god amen to egypt he was just a man to egypt he was just a failure but to the children of the promise that ministry was god's way of manifesting his promise through their father abraham amen so he plagued egypt with plagues he turned the water into blood amen he brought flies and fleas and lice and all of these things darkness in the land and then the death angel moved through the streets and those who believed the prophet's message and applied it to their homes into their lives amen marched out of egypt amen and pharaoh pursued them to the red sea oh man they stood on the banks of the red sea between two mountains with the greatest army of the greatest nation in the world at that time pursuing them from behind amen and when they cried out unto moses moses cried unto god and god said why cry speak and move forward god divided the waters they marched across the dry land and when the egyptians tried to duplicate it amen and try to imitate it god destroyed them in the same waters that the children of israel had just walked through [Music] oh my god told them the egyptians that you see this day you shall see them no more oh my god could have left those egypt egyptians back there at home licking their wounds he could have left pharaoh back there in his palace he could have left the soldiers back there to regroup and reassemble their military and figure out how they were going to move on with their lives but he didn't he let pharaoh pursue them he let the armies pursue them he let the same task masters amen that had whipped them and beaten him and made their decisions for them and controlled their lives every day of their life he let those same taskmasters get on the other side of the banks of the red sea so every one of his children could watch the one who used to control them and used to drive their life and used to torment them and used to aggravate him and used to afflict them they could have the personal pleasure of watching god drown that demon in the red sea for the final time hallelujah i'll tell you tonight you don't have to accept any compromises with satan amen god can drown your egyptian too amen whatever you've been dealing with whatever you've been tempted by whatever you've been fighting with amen if you just march up the banks of the red sea hey man watch god roll the waters back even and drown that thing that's been tormenting you amen he was a cloud by day and a fire by night he was manna from heaven and water from the rock even their clothes didn't grow threadbare even their shoes didn't wear out amen they were given even the elderly and the old amen had strength in their bones hallelujah to make the journey to the promised land and yet they come all the way on the other side of jordan and they still have gods amen now there's not a one of us that would have walked in here tonight with an idol hanging around her neck amen i sure hope not amen we wouldn't have something at home a candle we burn or some relative that we prayed to or some deceased loved one amen no we would never do that amen but what is what is a false god amen what is a little g g.o.d amen it's something that you fall back on just in case god doesn't take care of it oh my amen and as far as that goes we got a lot of things that if we're not careful can turn into gods oh brother tim i'm praying for my healing but i'm i'll tell you i found this doctor or i found this diet or i found this a recipe amen oh i found this and i found that be careful that that doesn't become a little god to you amen i thank god for doctors i thank god for medicine and i thank god for science but i also thank god that i know who god is and i know where my healing comes from and if he sends me to a doctor or a hospital i'm gonna go and if the doctor gives me a prescription i'm gonna take it even but when i'm well when i'm healed when i'm restored again i'm gonna give one person the credit because i know where healing comes from i know who walked up golgotha's hill and bled on an old rugged cross for my salvation no doctor died for me no hospital rose for me amen i know who god is amen and i don't want a false god in my life tonight but joshua wasn't bringing them to a confession but he was bringing them to a consecration amen he wasn't questioning their heritage he wasn't he wasn't there to question whether or not they believed the message whether moses was their prophet or abraham was their father amen he was there to say is the message you're everything amen is the prophet you're everything it's all your faith is your entire life wrapped up in the revealed word of the hour have you forsaken every other way he said yes this is tradition yes your fathers did this but it's time for the tradition to drown [Applause] it's time for the family history to drown it's time for what happened in your old church to drown oh my it's time for everything that has hindered you from possessing the canaan land and occupying it and dispossessing every canaanite and every enemy it's time for that to die amen you're following the right thing you're in the right movement but you've got to be holy and fully in order for your faith to be an overcoming faith in order for you to take full possession and to conquer every canaanite you've got to be committed the pastor can't do it the prophet can't do it your parents can't do it you've got to do it jesus said in mark 8 34 and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and for the gospels the same shall save it for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his soul amen it doesn't matter what you gain in this life don't do it at the expense of your soul amen amen if you have to keep your family out of church to add another digit to your salary it doesn't matter how much you gain it is not gain if it is caught bought at the expense of your soul amen i'm gonna preach it because i know it's the truth amen amen the world will offer you all kind of temptations or we'll give you a promotion we'll give you a raise but but we'd like for you to stay over on wednesday evening [Applause] until and close up everything i'll tell you what brother sister the devil don't give christians promotions amen when god gives you a blessing he will bless you amen and you won't have to compromise you won't have to forfeit amen you won't have to sacrifice the things of god hallelujah you tell that boss you find some other compromiser and when you find some other egyptian you find some other unbelievable my time in the house of god is worth more to me than anything you can put in my wallet [Applause] you stand for god and god will stand for you you say brother tim i'm gonna lose my job god will give you a better one amen if you have to take a job at the expense of what you believe brother sister trust god trust god for something greater hallelujah you don't have to compromise you do not have to compromise amen what shall a man give in exchange for his soul whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me unto my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh into the glory of his father with the holy angels the decision is yours god has given each of us the power of choice every one of us tonight has choice amen the reason the world is in the condition it's in today is because of a choice amen because a woman chose to listen to another voice and because adam entered into the transgression with her and made the choice he did amen the world is in the condition it's in today but we're in the condition we're in as sons and daughters of god because another man made a choice oh father if it be thy will let this cup pass from me oh my but not my will but thine be done and that choice amen over it reversed the choice of the first adam amen the choice of the second adam undid all of the wrong of the wrong choice of the first adam i'm so thankful the second adam amen the first adam made a choice that affects me the first adam made a choice that affects the entire world but the second adam made a choice too that affects it impacts every believer every son and daughter of god tonight amen [Music] you can believe tonight you can choose to believe that your life is entirely the result of other people's choices you can choose to believe that oh brother tim if you only knew my story if you only knew the way i was raised and what my family what my parents what you know what this person that person if you only knew see you can choose to believe that your life is entirely the result of other people's choices but really and truly it's your choosing that determines the outcome of your life there are things in life that you can't control and there are things in life that can happen to you that are are beyond your ability to choose otherwise but how you react to it how you respond to it is your choice and your choice alone the bible says in genesis 45 verse 4 and joseph said unto his brethren come near to me i pray you and they came near and he said i am joseph your brother whom ye sold ye sold into egypt he is meeting his brothers for the first time to reveal himself to them after they sold him into slavery decades before this left him to die first in the pit and then sold him as a slave to strangers and told told their father that he had been killed to a bad for to cause their father to abandon any hopes of ever seeing him again they had a purpose so he says i am joseph your brother whom ye sold into egypt now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that you sold me hither i want you to listen to how many times he says one time he says ye sold then he says for god did listen to how many times he says for god did send me before you to preserve life for these two years hath the famine been in the land and yet there are five years into which there shall be neither hearing or harvest and god sent me before you to preserve your posterity in the earth and now to save your lives by a great deliverance so now it was not you that sent me hither but god and he hath made me a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt haste ye and go up to my father and say unto him thus saith thy son joseph god hath made me lord of all egypt come down unto me tarry knot so only one time and he doesn't do it to accuse them he doesn't do it to shame them he doesn't do it to to place guilt on their conscience he does it strictly for the purpose of identifying himself to them i am the same person that you left to die i am the same person that you put in the pit and then brought me up and saw me as a slave however you saw me then look at me now because i'm the same person that's the only reason he gave them any credits for what had happened to him the only reason he said anything about what they did to him is so they could understand he was the same person and then he said god said god did god did god placed me here god placed me there god made me this god made me you made me a slave you made me a slave but god made me a ruler god made me father over pharaoh's house a lord over egypt regardless of what you did i don't give you credit for any of it i give god all the praise that is the choice of an overcomer that is a choice of somebody who's on their way to the throne that says it doesn't matter what happened to me it doesn't matter what people thought it doesn't matter what people say it doesn't matter what people do everything that happens to me is controlled and permitted and ordained by the almighty god hallelujah oh he could have really had a time they were in the palm of his hand to do anything with them he could have thrown him in prison he could have had him executed he could have had him stripped naked and led through the streets and i wonder if it were up to us to meet out justice to the men and women who through our lives have shamed us humiliated us tormented us abused us what would your justice be to those people because in his choice he never mentions the jealousy the envy the lies the conspiracies the evil schemes joseph didn't write that in the bible about himself god wrote that that was written by someone else of the things because joseph was not focused on the negative [Laughter] that's a choice he chose i'm not going to focus on that i'm not going to place emphasis on that i'm not going to feel sorry for myself but those are real events in his life he was hated he was envied they were jealous of him they despised their own blood brother they put him there and from there he was treated like a slave he was sold and sold and bought and sold and finally he ends up in a pharaoh's court and then he's lied about he's falsely accused falsely imprisoned everything good that he did got turned into bad by somebody else but he doesn't mention a single word of it he said god did god did god did oh i would we would realize tonight that we were purchased by the blood of jesus christ and as sons and daughters of god we are his property we belong to him and our lives are completely in his hands and in his control amen somebody say amen tonight [Applause] he credited god for everything everything that unfolded in his life we are not victims we are victors amen we are not victims we are victors and we know that all things work together for the good of those that love the lord and are thee called unto his purpose we are more than conquerors through him that loved us everything everything that takes place in a christian's life serves to prove that satan is a defeated foe and no matter how he manifests himself he is the perpetual victim [Laughter] he is the victim satan is the victim of michael's overthrow in heaven and christ continued defeat of him in earth there he was overthrown by angels here he's being overthrown by sons and daughters of god amen i want to tell you tonight he is the victim of his own unbelief and i refuse to join him [Music] amen i refuse to listen to his libra the carlos i refuse for him to make me feel like i'm his partner i'm not a victim satan you're the victim [Applause] had i remained your subject had i remained your disciple had i remained in your prison i would too be a victim but jesus signed my pardon he bought me with a great price amen and because he overcame i have overcome and i refuse to identify with your victimism i'm a victor amen i'm a son and daughter of god [Music] amen praise the lord choice the prophet of god says in many things of life we are given a choice the way of life itself is a choice we have a right to make our own way choose our own way that we want to live how you spend your time is a choice and we got a lot of devices and inventions today amen to occupy our time and i wonder if some of these things haven't turned our minds and souls into garbage cans because we're feeling our minds and our memories and our time with news reports videos gossip facebook whatsapp instagram what er what is going on in everyone else's lives amen we need to turn to another well amen amen you don't have to bathe under a downspout of a gutter you can drink from a well amen education is a choice we can choose whether we're going to be educated or whether we're not going to be educated that's a choice right and wrong is a choice every man woman boy and girl has to choose whether they're going to try to live right or not live right it's a choice choice is a great thing your eternal destination is a choice and brother ben says maybe tonight some of you will make that choice of where you'll spend eternity before this service ends tonight there'll be one time that if you turn god down many time there'll be one time you'll turn them down the last time there is a line between mercy and judgment it's a dangerous thing for a man or a woman boy or girl to step across that line for when for there's no return when you step across that deadline so tonight it may be the time that many will make their decision where they will spend the endless eternity i just want to move into something here for a moment and i want to be conscious of the time but sometimes i believe god will let us drift along and even be partakers and witnesses like the children of israel were no one could deny the things they had experienced in their lives but now it was getting personal but much like the token there comes a time when it's not about your environment it's not about your family it's not about your history it's about where you are right now you're standing face to face with the revealed word of the hour and it's your time to choose amen when a showdown comes an ultimatum is given you can't sit on the fence any longer you can't be undecided any longer amen god became weary of israel's indifference one time and elijah called for a showdown you know elijah said there doesn't have to be any debates there doesn't have to be any if about this if let the god who's the true god answer by fire you know why worry and why fuss and why debate and and why i have all this controversy let's just settle the question let's settle the god likes to settle the question oh my and so he gave them the first opportunity and we know they cried and they screamed and they danced and they cut themselves and they did all these things and you know something it occurred to me brother stephen those people of all the gods that they had and that they called on they didn't care which one answered if even one of their gods had answered in any way they would have been thrilled to death they just they would have been happy with any vindication but they got none amen and they were sincere and they labored and they had works and they had all these things brother and sister amen they had they probably had quotes for what they were doing amen they could probably justify their actions somehow in the word of god but they had no vindication amen but elijah didn't need a dozen amen he didn't need a dozen options he didn't need a backup plan he said there's one god he said now let god answer by fire and you know what it came to a showdown because when god struck that altar with fire and consumed the sacrifice and consumed the water now elijah said it's time for you to do something it's time for you to do something message believer go out there and find that false prophet go out there and find that bell priest that's been lying to you and taking your tithe and offering and telling you that was a real god go find that man and slay him silence the voice of the unbeliever cut it off don't listen to it don't argue with it don't feel sorry for it it's time for a showdown god has sent a prophet god is entered by fire and now it's time for people to silence silence the voice of satan they got enough courage they said if elijah can believe god that way i can believe god that way if elijah can call on god that way i can call on god that way if elijah can have that kind of boldness i can have that kind of boldness amen they made a decision and all 400 450 prophets of the hell were slain that day not by elijah by his followers by his followers they are divorced and they responded to the voice and when they responded the priest fell dead oh my you say brother tim you're inciting violence i don't know about you but the devil hadn't been nice to me he ain't played nice he fights dirty he fights mean i don't think it's time to spare the sword it's like our pastor says it's time to pull out the sword and throw the sheath away it's time to fight it's time for battle it's time for you to find out it's time for you to experience what the word of god can do it's time for you to experience who the god of elijah is it's not a memory it's not a history it's not a story it's a reality amen and you've got power over satan you've got authority over the devil amen amen showdown call for a nation to see who the true and living god is silence the false voices you know the bible the bible don't even say you have to overthrow satan it just says resistant the bible doesn't say you have to be stronger more mighty more powerful or more anointed the bible says resist him resist the devil and he will flee from you amen oh my there was a lady in the bible by the name of ruth and she her husband they went out of israel into a land of moab and their their sons married two daughters ruth and orpah and then ruth's husband died and uh excuse me naomi's husband died then ruth also and then naomi's all three widows here and and naomi says i'm going back home i'm going back to my land my people and my god and she gave ruth and orpha the opportunity to follow her and go along with her and she kind of told him the the pros and the cons the advantages and the disadvantages she let them make their own choice and to one the advantages outweigh the disadvantages but to the other she got to thinking about oh well well moab is my home and and moabitess people are my people and this is where all my history is and this is everything i've ever known so orpah turns and goes back to her homeland and naomi and ruth journey back into israel well you know the story how ruth went into the fields of boaz and began gleaning and called he caught the eye of boaz and then naomi instructed her on to stay right there oh stay right there you you found the right field yeah you you you're in the right church now you're you're in the right message now i mean that you're in other words you're not in a partial light you're not in some past age or some creed or dogma you you stay right there it may not seem like much now but this field will result in relationship amen so of course boaz ends up marrying ruth and two generations later ruth's great grandson becomes the king of israel david one of israel's greatest kings one of israel's most notable kings god was so pleased he said he's a man after my own heart and god said of of his seed the throne will never leave it amen but this is not in the scriptures or in the bible that i can find but in rabbinical tradition it's taught that when orpha went back she too gave birth and her offspring two generations later also produced someone by the name of goliath the power of a decision one decision brought ruth into the lineage of jesus christ the other decision birthed a tormentor a giant a a a disfigured beast that had all of israel in fear and trembling and i just love this because here's a little david you know he's small he's kind of a misfit he's not like his brothers he's not tall he's not handsome he's not strong he's not qualified and all his brothers are joining the army and they're going away and they're getting trained and they're getting uniforms and and good grades and all these things that david cannot do they're doing and they're moving up through the the ranks and through the echelon and they're all becoming great warriors and renowned warriors of saul but when goliath called to them they trembled and they shook oh my but david amen he was never in training to be a private or a sergeant or a captain or a lieutenant or a general david's training was to be king he was on a different path he had a different teacher he had a different leader oh my but on the day he visited that battlefront when he heard the voice of his distant cousin goliath saying send me a man send me a man send me a man and everybody who israel called a man trembled and shriveled at the sound of goliath's voice but one day those words send me a man caught the ears of a man oh my he might have been a boy but he had a man-sized god he had a relationship with the god of man oh my he said i won't go back i won't compromise i won't pretend i didn't hear that i won't be talked out of it i won't be convinced i won't wear saul's armor i can't rest until that goliath is dead and ruth's decision defeated orpha's decision on the battlefield amen [Applause] when the word of god is sent to an age or a generation it forces a decision or showdown when jesus came to earth the first time his ministry called for a showdown whosoever therefore shall confess me before men him will i also confess before my father which is in heaven but whosoever shall deny me before men him will i also deny before my father which is in heaven think not that i am come to send peace on earth i came not to send peace but a sword for i am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law that's not the cause of all your family problems tonight but when it comes to this message when it comes to the word of god mother father brother sister cousin niece nephew in-laws are outlaws the word of god is where the line is drawn amen i preached this message sunday night in tucson arizona and a hispanic sister came up to me after the service and her face was glowing she was so happy she said oh brother tiff this service tonight was just for me she said just this afternoon i got a i got a a a message from my niece who is a lesbian and she's fixing to have a wedding to her lesbian partner and she invited me to the wedding and she said i had to tell her i can't come i can't support that i'm a christian amen i love you but i don't support your choices amen i don't support your lifestyle i'll tell you we've all been to these places but when that man of god stands up there and says can anyone show just cause why these two should not be lawfully joined together you do here now speak your peace or here after hold your peace if you have a disagreement you're obligated to stand and speak or don't go don't even be present now you do what the lord leads you to do but this woman made a choice she made a decision and i said you sister i said it's not that you are what you're standing against it's what you're standing for god will honor what you're standing for and i said if you compromise she may never see anything real enough in your life to desire what you have but if you take a stand for god and you in love will stand on the truth that girl though she may be lesbian now she will see a reality in your life that will give her confidence that one day she can approach you and say lead me to the god you know amen that's the kind of choice i want to make as a christian amen he that loveth a man's foes shall be they of his own household he that loveth father mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me showdown and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it the prophet of god said when the messenger from the sixth seal the messenger the angel come on earth the messenger of the hour like luther's like any of the messengers that we've talked of what does he do he arrives and the seal opened revealed a trumpet sound war declared and away they go and then the messenger dies he seals away this group who's that the believer those who made the choice to believe amen those who made the choice to be identified with the reproach amen those who didn't walk away when a website disagreed those who were sealed in by the revealed word of the hour they're put in and a plague falls upon those who rejected it amen i want to say tonight i'm coming to a close when god does something it really doesn't matter what anyone's opinion of it is it's a matter of do you believe it and will you follow it that's it it's really not up for you to decide whether or not it's right whether or not it's god whether or not any of these other things whether the world agrees with it or accepts it or any of those things you know something on the day that the flood waters lifted the ark to safety there were more believers under the boat than there were in the boat they just waited too long to be convinced when scientific proof vindicated noah's message it was too late to get on the boat then the ones in the ark was the ones that believed it before science agreed with it and they floated to safety and the ones that were waiting for the televisions and the websites and the scientists and the world council of churches to say it's right they drown under the boat amen imagine them children would say daddy i've never seen you blow so many bubbles wouldn't it have been easier to believe that farmer that farmer knew more about the weather than the scientists did hey that farmer was a prophet that game warden was a prophet that carpenter was a prophet that man was a prophet he was the voice of god and it wasn't his ideas and it wasn't his forecast it was god's forecast but because you made a choice because you made a decision when it was not popular when it was not accepted by the world when it could not be proven by science it puts you in the ark and the same water that drowned the unbeliever floated the believer lifted the ark over every obstacle and floated them into the new earth amen i'm not waiting on raindrops i'm not waiting on california to sink i'm not waiting on a brown bear i'm not waiting on those things i've already been persuaded and convinced i'm already sealed it's too late i'm already decided it's already damon it's already been decided and it wasn't altogether my choice it was a reflection of his choice [Laughter] hallelujah and i'm sealed away i don't control the door but i want to be on the right side of it amen amen when the hebrew children were faced with certain death the king asked them he said do you know whether god will deliver you or not they said no we don't know we don't know if he will we don't know exactly what he's going to do but we do know what we're not going to do we whether we live or whether we die i am not going to battle because i know to bow to surrender to compromise to agree with that is certain death amen so i'm going to stay with the god of daniel i'm not going to worship daniel i'm not going to worship william branham i never prayed to his picture i never prayed to hoffman's head of christ i saw god in that ministry god called me out of sin god spoke to me god said you're the pure sinless spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ i never heard a man i heard god the whole time and i said i will go i will go i will go just like ruth i will go i don't know what the future holds all together but i'm going know that our family don't understand it no that's not where i'm from but i'm going hallelujah my mind's made up i'm already convinced i'm not on the fence i'm not waiting i've already made up my mind amen many of our young people made the decision give their heart to the lord and take on his name in water baptism many are praying believing for god to fill them with the holy spirit i told my little niece i said the devil's going to tell you this don't mean nothing nothing happened and this wasn't anything but i said he's a liar i said you keep believing you go down in that water tonight take on the name of jesus christ in water baptism and he will fill you with the holy ghost amen oh my you'll face battles you'll face tests your friends may turn their backs on you the world will call you crazy but god will honor your stand moses esteem the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures of egypt oh my and make sure your decisions aren't being influenced by well-meaning people whose place it is not to determine the will of god for your life because when the prophet of god stood beside the bed of his dying wife with tuberculosis she said he said she said do you know why honey he said don't say it she said we should have never listened to mother because he allowed her mother to call those pentecostal people trash he didn't call them trash she did but because he allowed her well-intentioned influence she she just wanted her daughter to be married to a successful preacher who like every other preacher she had ever known could be accepted he could have a nice fine church someday and a nice retirement in a nice car and with the gift he had no doubt a wonderful minute that's all she wanted for her daughter and son-in-law was success but look what their pursuit of her idea of success look where it led them she's dying and died and his little baby died well well-meaning people can influence you and it's not necessarily god's leadership we have to get before the lord and say lord i'm going to silence all those voices you direct my path amen as the musicians come back this evening how many of you have ever heard the song i have decided to follow jesus [Music] we probably all sung that song since we were children but do you know what the origins of that song are in the welsh revival 150 or so years ago out of that revival came many missionaries men and women who would feel the pull of god on their heart and sell their home leave everything they had ever had and go to some other region of the world where god was leading them take their children take their family and in many cases live in poverty and in destitute places and conditions for the rest of their lives that's what a revival produces is men and women who are willing to surrender everything and say lord wherever you send me i will go whatever you have for me lord i will do amen oh my god send us revival god's in a real revival amen and so one of those one of those missionaries and families ended up in a northern northern region of india which was the assam region and there were a lot of aggressive tribes there they called head hunters and so these headhunters you know very uh very vicious and they just just killed everybody and so they faced a lot of opposition but those missionaries were able to finally get a man in his family to convert to christianity the man's name was nox singh and he had two he had a wife and two little boys and so he accepted jesus christ as his savior he was filled with the holy ghost and as soon as the chief of his tribe of his village heard that noxian had accepted jesus christ as his savior he gathered the whole village here's all of noxing's friends everybody he's ever known his entire life looking on and the chief gives him this renounce your faith in jesus christ or your children will die [Music] you know what he said i have decided to follow jesus no turning back no turning back the chief ordered the boys to be shot and the arrows pierced them and they fell to the ground dying he said you have another opportunity he said deny your faith or we will kill your wife he said though no one joins me still i will follow i wonder how many of us [Music] could make that stand tonight whether they live or die could you serve god all by yourself [Music] that was his determination though no one joins me it's not about who joins me it's not about who agrees with me amen it's not about who understands me i mean it's not about how many friends i have on facebook though no one joins me still i will follow no turning back no turning back and his wife was killed the chief then asked for the final time for him to deny his faith and live and he gladly said these final words the cross before me the world behind me no turning back no turning back he was shot and killed on the spot never had the chief ever witnessed a person who could stand under such strong conviction and give their life for the cause of a man who had lived and died two thousand years ago he was so moved he said i too accept jesus christ as my lord and savior he repented the holy spirit filled him and all of the villagers accepted jesus christ as their savior and from that village it spread to the next village and to the next village a whole revival was sparked by one man one person's unwillingness to deny their faith you know what the moment noxing took his last breath he was rejoined with his wife he rejoined his children he joined the all the the saints of ages past had he compromised on one point that would have never happened that chief would have never accepted christ the village would have been lost and the revival would have never been sparked but because of the power of one man's decision look what took place amen i have decided stand with me to follow jesus i had decided to follow jesus i had decided to follow jesus no turning back no turning back [Music] though none go with me still i will follow though none go with me still i will follow the non-go with me still i will follow no turning back the cross before me the cross before me all the world behind the cross before me the world behind me the cross before me the world behind me no turning back is that your determination tonight no turning back take this whole world you can take this whole world but give me jesus you can take this whole world but give me jesus you can take this whole world but give me jesus no turning back no turning you love the lord this evening is that your decision i want to tell you something when he fills you with his spirit when you surrender your heart and life to the lord jesus repent of your sins take on his name and water baptism in the name of jesus christ and he fills you with his spirit he will do the things that you could never do because it won't be you trying it'll be him do it all you have to do is accept it when those 120 believers come out of the upper room on the day of pentecost the whole world was watching to see who are they now who are they now because before they met jesus they were fishermen and they were sailors but after they met him they couldn't do anything without him they couldn't catch fish without him they couldn't sell a boat from one side of the lake to the other without him whatever they could do before they met him they couldn't do anything after they met him unless he was with him and then when he was with him he made him cast out devils and heal the sick and they couldn't even do that without him oh my but he said it's expedient for you that i go away it's beneficial for you that i go away for if i go away i will come again [Music] and when they come staggering out of that upper room the whole world had to recognize very quickly he's back he's back he's not just with him now he's in him amen he's doing everything now now everything peter says is jesus christ amen silver and gold have i none but in the name of jesus christ rise up and walk amen oh my friend you can have him that way too and he can fill your heart and your life that way too i have decided to follow jesus i have decided to follow jesus i have decided to follow jesus no turning back no turning back amen now as they play very softly i'd like to invite you to bow your heads maybe you would be in this service tonight and you might say i accepted the lord jesus many years ago i've been saved i've been sanctified i've been filled with god's spirit i know i'm a son or daughter of god but i realized tonight that i too am like the children of israel that joshua spoke to on that day [Music] and i've carried a few things along with me [Music] that i know i really don't need if i can put all my faith and all my confidence in who the lord is or say or maybe you would realize that your steps have strayed your zeal has weakened and maybe you've allowed things to creep into your life your walk with the lord has grown cold distant or your love for the lord is not what it once was maybe you have begun to feel like you're the victim of all of the trauma and the torment and the sufferings that you've gone through you realize tonight you don't have to remain a victim you're a victor in jesus christ you can make a choice to forgive and a choice to place all those hard feelings and grudges and memories and all those things that have bound you in a prison i choose to place this at the altar and let god take it from me because i'm not gonna live as a prisoner or as a victim or as a partner to satan [Music] maybe you haven't accepted christ as your savior and you've never taken on his name and water baptism and made filled with the spirit say i don't want to leave this service tonight and turn down what could be my last opportunity lord jesus i believe your holy spirit is calling tonight to your children for a consecration not to rest in a confession or rest in [Music] an environment or security the message or message believers or spoken word tabernacle or any of these other things but realize they want to put their faith in confidence and consecrate their life fully completely to you tonight i pray lord jesus your holy spirit will lead that son of god that daughter of god lord to that altar that all consuming fire would calm lord jesus and consume away all the fear all the doubt all the unbelief lord all the anguish all the hurt lord all the bitterness all the chains lord and the bands lord that would try to bind them and hinder them lord and weaken their faith we rebuke it tonight in the name of the lord jesus christ lord you are speaking victory you are speaking healing lord god you're the great emancipator oh god it helped them to realize tonight every fiery furnace that satan invents can only loosen the bands and enable them lord to walk with you through the fire heavenly father i pray you'll give grace tonight i don't know the people and know the needs but you do lord god and i pray lord you'll give them strength lord to accept lord the choice you made in calvary lord to accept i believe the choice you made before the foundation of the world and say i've falled i've tried i've tried the other ways i've tried other other avenues i'm ready to surrender my life and accept his path for me give grace tonight lord jesus to your children may your word lord god feed and minister to their souls bring healing lord bring strength bring deliverance father god as only you can do in jesus name we ask amen i love you lord [Music] and i lift my voice to worship you o my soul [Music] rejoice take joy my king in what you hear oh may it be a sweet sweet sound in your ears do you like paul and silas now turn your prison into praise let's worship him i love you lord lift your hands to him and i lift my voice to worship you oh yes lord oh my soul rejoice take joy my king go into that shekinah presence now in what you hear [Applause] oh may it be a sweet sweet sound in your ear drop that down just a little bit key of f if you will i sing this song key of f i love you lord and i lift my voice i just close out every other thing to worship you o my soul [Music] rejoice that's right in what you hear oh may it be a sweet sweet sound in your ear now sing this with me so glad i'm yours lord so glad i'm your through all my trials through all the temptation so glad your mercy even when i was in prison has fallen me are you thankful for it tonight so glad you found me oh and you've set me free i'm so glad i'm yours lord so glad i'm yours let's sing that again as brother stephen comes with all your hearts now so glad i'm yours lord i'm so glad i'm yours so glad i'm yours so glad your mercy all my life has fallen [Music] i'm [Music] hallelujah amen let's give the lord a hand tonight [Applause] hallelujah [Music] i'm going to say this i know there are some online and lord's willing some will follow through the week as the views goes up but i have to say it over again because the holy spirit is insisting under this last wednesday brother kelly preach and when he finished preaching i made a comment because god spoke to us that god made men to be an achiever but in order to do that you gotta let him do the work through you but not you doing the work and tonight the holy spirit spoke about the power of decision you can give many reason why you cannot be in church on wednesday i'm going to repeat it because i don't want to face him with your blood in my hand amen you can be three years four years without being able to be on church on wednesday and it never bothers you we might have one service on sunday and you miss it and you don't see that when you miss that service you are affecting your children because they depend on your transportation to be here in church and when you miss two services there will be the one missing two services and the way you study the message or you've been in a message they don't have that experience and they are longing to be in church but the problem is not them it's probably the one driving or it's probably somebody who want to take a decision to move or to do something without being even conscious about the kids you can be four five weeks not being in a church maybe four five seven sermon that you behind you have not even caught in because we put other things first before the kingdom of god amen one more time this is the time to take a decision whether you want to serve god in the category he's calling you or you don't want to do it amen if you notice for those that were in the same church with me where we came out of it we had quite a few people that needed french translation if you recall i was going out very few times i was almost all the time in church [Music] and the reason was my wife knows that i told her i say i don't see how i can leave a responsibility in the church and go serve somewhere else and there will be people coming in the church that won't be able to listen to the sermon because i'm not there i say i'm going to stay in the church if i find somebody to replace me who can do the job then i can go out and who help somebody but i'm not gonna neglect what god gave me first to go out to help somebody and their ship there that needed to hear the word of god that's why you saw me staying in the church for a long time and i noticed something when i come on wednesday i was coming from work and i usually get tired because i was working and coming to church and i had to translate and translating was like you were preaching exactly like the preacher who's preaching there amen i took a decision not here i didn't know i'm going to be a pastor in this church i took a decision i changed my work schedule amen to work from eight o'clock till two o'clock and stop on wednesday i can be making more money in my dental office if i continue to work on wednesday afternoon till five o'clock or six pm and come to church i refuse that money i say i need to be in church fresh with strength so i can serve the people of god i never knew what was coming ahead and that schedule helped me here even on wednesday amen we just had our wedding anniversary and somebody asked a question he said where are you going with your wife i say i will be in church on sunday morning i said because the church is young i must stick with the people in the church i'm not going in no vacation until that church is grown i could have taken a vacation with my wife and i can prove to you and everybody will agree with me but i have to forsake that vacation because i want to stand with the church and make sure everything is grounded before i can move out and take maybe a one week or five days because we want to give god the preeminence amen you're missing wednesday service you're missing sunday service you're missing three sundays you're missing four sundays you don't come to service because we got used to staying home and get the streaming and sometimes the devil have now attacked you to the point that you don't even stay tight with the streaming you touch you can stay home and stream now you're too busy to even stay home and stream some people don't even stream at the same time even though they are home they put it up for another day for a week or two weeks in other words you're not in service for two weeks three weeks when do you want to worship god the way he wants you to worship him when do you want to serve god the way god wants you to serve him what are you waiting for this world is gone the delta virus is coming back up again we don't know what they're gonna say whether we're gonna shut the church down or whatever there is an agenda behind everything is coming we don't know what is going on what else do you want again in this world that is causing you to neglect the work of god you say i'm not a musician you say i'm not a trustee you say i'm not a deacon you say i'm not a song leader fine what about your spot to be in church when was the last time you were in church consistently amen if we have a reception everybody will be there everybody will be at the reception if there is a party going on somewhere you will even meet people that never been in church for a month you're going to meet them at a party but they don't want to come to church when all the suns are falling left and right we're still putting our own project our own agenda before god amen we have gods we have backup plan we want to work on that credit card we want to work on that credit score we want to work double shift we are even loading ourselves with more responsibility while you don't even have time with the first responsibility you already have and you're putting more to your family you're adding more and more and more god want to help you with that strength he doesn't need you we read the whole uh a 7 or 14 chapter here where god did this god delivered god delivered god delivered god delivered god

landscape i said brother robert call the man let have a court and i put it on the shelf when i get the money i will do it do you know what happened do you know how much it would cost to do the landscape of the church the man came on his appointment look over everything and turn around and say i'm gonna do the landscape for free [Applause] who did it god who convinced the man we can work for that landscape or god can give you the landscape for free and you just go and enjoy it amen take your hand off your wheel put your car in neutral let god lead your life church aren't you tired of your life how many mistakes you made over and over doing the same thing it's not working it's not working we keep doing the same thing you keep missing church for so long and you are continuing to mischarge why the family is getting destroyed you don't listen all god asks israel give me the first place give me the preeminence brother problem how to get closer to god with your bible and pray is that difficult if they tell you first for 14 days you want to do that amen amen church let's give god the first place you're a musician make sure if the music is not playing good it's not you who calls that can you say amen you the song leader make sure if the song is not good you're not the one that causes it if you're a trustee make sure if the work of the lord is not done correctly you're not the one slacking if you a deacon make sure if the work is not properly you not the ones lacking if the church is not blessed make sure your personal life is in order and you are not the one blocking the blessing of someone because of your lack of consecration amen that body made a body change we preached to you on the mystery of death we preached to you on the mystery of the first death lord's willing we're going to get on the second death what else do you want what else do you want god wants you to serve him in the highest category where he's going to do things that is beyond your imagination amen amen like brother tim says here i'm not going to compromise to get on the job you're gonna increase my salary and i'm gonna kill my family amen i know people that are successful right now they bought new cars and everything the life is completely destroyed almost off the message completely do you want that god can give you the same thing if you give him the preeminent seek ye first the kingdom of god and everything else will be what will be worked for will be three shift four will be what he said prove me easy you say brother stephen he only happened to you how many times brother stephen miss church people don't see that amen why is that person blessed why is that one blessed and god told cain if you do what your brother is doing you'll be accepted it's so easy we're tired of it that work will wear you down while you have a powerful supernatural god that can bless you and you can come to work happy you can come to church happy and be on church all the time and praise him in the beauty of the holiness amen well it's not going to be a story oh on wednesday it was wonderful and you don't have a choice make a decision make a decision to serve god you say father

see what god will do for you amen there are time i want to pray i feel tired i want to pray i feel tired and when i begin to pray after five minutes everything that i was feeling is gone amen it was the devil blocking me from praying if i would have given i would have stayed there and have a result like i'm a pastor i'm already worn out amen remember god loves you he's pulling all this up on the surface just to help you get more blessing but i'm saying god let job go through what he went to prune him so he can bless him more amen so check your gods the one that is staying behind all those facebook and things i even spoke about that he was not even there when i talk about it remove them completely out amen amen something is pulling you out for church something is pulling you out of church something is pulling you out of church three four five weeks you need to stop and say amen no more i'll go first to church god will take care of the rest and maybe your decision and the way you behave will influence somebody like i want to be like that person when it comes to their religion we're not in religion but faith i see them they don't compromise amen god richly bless you god love you as a pastor i have to say that make sure you give god the highest order he want to have the preeminence brother garcia i will never leave you without coming to this pulpit and saying something and

dismiss somebody ever again i just want to thank you for the message brother tim he always been a blessing and i see him for so many times preaching sorting singing playing the piano and he's a real friend of ross and i'm so glad for the meeting wednesday because so many people because of the pandemia and all of that that being so used to stay in the house and they they took advantage of that and they changed the time for the service in other thing and now is a regular uh doing you know many people let the this situation change scared you to serve the lord but uh the pastor made an exaltation in in good time and uh well i think the the what the message said today that kind of decision it said everything i think even he let the holy spirit use in a special way and uh everybody take his part i tell me my part my blessing i see the holy ghost talking to me and i was rejoined and i see that when he was talking certain things that he don't know but god and me knows he was he was uh talking in a special way that uh if i tell you you're gonna say oh wow but it's certain thing that is you know for everybody is private and uh a holy ghost is a private person he don't he don't respect you he's just he tried to encourage you see he tried to to restore to take it back all the time and and and i think today i see uh uh the spirit of the of the holy pastor with his stick tried to take his chip back in uh in his way and uh well if you if you want to hurt this message that brother tim preach just do it i i know you're gonna hear so many things that it was past you know but it's going to
