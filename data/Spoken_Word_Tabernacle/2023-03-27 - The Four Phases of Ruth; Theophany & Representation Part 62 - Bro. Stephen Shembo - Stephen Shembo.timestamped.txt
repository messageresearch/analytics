[11:49] listening to brother Tim preach and and
[11:51] this song hit me and I started thinking

[11:58] knows I'm there and that I'm here this
[12:00] morning amen so I want to worship him
[12:03] this morning amen now I'm going to sing
[12:05] some familiar songs but these things
[12:07] came to me while while I was um
[12:09] listening to brother Tim y'all could
[12:11] turn around and greet your neighbor too
[12:13] this morning and say welcome to the
[12:15] house of the Lord amen

[51:30] hide your thoughts you need to speak out
[51:32] to expel our thoughts to our pastors our
[51:36] water spiritual leaders and so forth and

[51:48] sake so you don't speak up it's your
[51:50] problem

[53:33] and as far as I'm concerned when it
[53:35] comes to push play
[53:37] you know where we're standing you know
[53:40] what we believe amen we always will
[53:43] encourage you to read your Cod book to
[53:45] read your question and answer to listen
[53:47] to The Prophet because that is the
[53:49] message of the everybody okay so far I
[53:53] believe I got everything covered quickly
[53:55] let's move on straight to our scripture
[53:57] glory to God
[54:02] amen
[54:10] I thought we will reach the resurrection
[54:12] can you adjust me a little bit
[54:16] I'm trying to save my voice
[54:19] thought we're going to reach the
[54:21] resurrection but
[54:24] there is something we got to deal with
[54:26] it a little
[54:27] then he kind of prepared and laid the
[54:29] foundation for everything and clarify
[54:31] the last portion of the theophany then
[54:34] we can move on how do we
[54:37] raise up from the dead
[54:39] how do we change
[54:43] what makes you change
[54:45] everybody okay
[54:47] since the opening of these Hills all
[54:49] everything the whole bubble is become a
[54:53] new
[54:53] so you know what it is amen so we must
[54:57] track a difficult Doctrine
[55:00] that you heard maybe you don't even know
[55:03] what it is really but you just probably
[55:04] heard of it
[55:06] amen you heard it people talking about
[55:09] it you want me to tell you that the two
[55:12] Souls
[55:16] I don't know how much you heard about it
[55:20] everybody okay so I'm gonna deal with
[55:22] that one
[55:23] okay once we deal with that one we come
[55:26] up with theophany then we are soaring
[55:28] we're in good run everybody okay so stay
[55:31] up
[55:33] it's raining outside we want it to rain
[55:35] down in this place amen
[55:38] for those that were in question and
[55:40] answer when I begin to read the
[55:41] Scripture it will automatically click
[55:43] because we went through this illness a
[55:46] little bit of detail amen Genesis
[55:49] chapter 1 verse 1. this is an easy one
[55:52] to find out you just open the scripture
[55:55] and it's there
[55:56] amen
[55:59] everybody okay
[56:03] I want you to be strong
[56:06] I go to sleep late I sleep at 3am
[56:12] and I have to wake up around eight
[56:14] something
[56:15] so you should be stronger than me
[56:18] okay
[56:19] yeah so don't be like I didn't sleep you
[56:22] already slept seven hours and then you
[56:24] complaining about you didn't sleep okay
[56:26] don't do that in the beginning
[56:30] God
[56:32] created the Heaven
[56:34] and the Earth we can get into the detail
[56:37] here but I'm just gonna get the scenario
[56:40] here
[56:42] verse 2 and the Earth
[56:44] was without form you might be seated
[56:49] how can God create something that
[56:52] doesn't look good
[56:59] am I reading a different Bible
[57:02] the Bible say God created the Heaven and
[57:07] the Earth
[57:09] so we expect when God created that when
[57:12] he comes out he will look out beautiful
[57:16] it will look perfect but when it comes
[57:19] out he doesn't look good
[57:23] he have no form
[57:26] and it's void
[57:33] why are you the Way You Are
[57:39] why were you created with the weaknesses
[57:41] you
[57:45] everybody okay
[57:48] and the Earth that was created by God
[57:51] was without form and how void and what
[57:56] was there Darkness
[58:01] who created here
[58:03] God how can he create the Earth and when
[58:06] you look in the earth you open the Earth
[58:07] it's Darkness
[58:10] what is he doing
[58:13] what is God doing
[58:16] everybody on board
[58:18] thank you
[58:19] so this Earth
[58:22] a little illustration is created like we
[58:25] know the planet
[58:27] but inside the Earth
[58:30] it's all dark
[58:34] so when you look at this Earth
[58:36] you don't see anything
[58:39] and you ask the Earth who created you he
[58:41] says you see that light over there
[58:44] that's the light that made me
[58:47] you don't know that light it's on the
[58:50] picture over there
[58:52] that light today created everything even
[58:56] this puppet here
[58:58] everybody okay
[59:01] and darkness was upon the face of the
[59:04] Water Deep
[59:07] and the spirit of God
[59:10] hey everybody okay if you notice there
[59:12] is a punctuation a full stop you need to
[59:15] be careful with the punctuation of the
[59:17] Bible we already talked about it amen
[59:21] it's a full stop then after this bad
[59:25] situation where everything is dark and
[59:27] gloomy the second part the spirit of the
[59:31] Lord
[59:33] everybody okay so there is a dark Earth
[59:38] a Nerf that is in the grip
[59:41] of Darkness
[59:44] everybody okay
[59:46] and then we got something that is coming
[59:49] to this earth
[59:50] which is called the spirit of God
[59:54] everybody okay
[59:57] and the spirit of God not the spirit of
[1:00:00] anybody
[1:00:01] the spirit of the one that created the
[1:00:04] Earth
[1:00:06] the spirit of the creator
[1:00:10] the Creator is here
[1:00:13] the Creator created the Earth
[1:00:16] so he's bigger than the earth
[1:00:20] everybody okay but he can make himself
[1:00:23] so small
[1:00:25] now
[1:00:26] he can humble himself
[1:00:31] you see what humility is and he can
[1:00:33] enter the Earth that he created
[1:00:38] now the earth look like big and he's
[1:00:41] small
[1:00:43] what is he doing in this earth
[1:00:46] and the spirit of God move upon the face
[1:00:50] of the waters
[1:00:54] war was on top of the water
[1:00:59] say it loud don't be afraid Darkness
[1:01:02] what was on top of the water Darkness
[1:01:04] where did the spirit of God move
[1:01:07] underwater upon what
[1:01:10] why is he chasing the darkness
[1:01:15] anybody okay he didn't get in the water
[1:01:19] no he he went to where darknesses
[1:01:25] are we okay
[1:01:27] are we okay so the darkness that is on
[1:01:30] the Earth
[1:01:31] amen already gave the spirit of the Lord
[1:01:34] where to work
[1:01:36] foreign
[1:01:38] you want to know the new birth right we
[1:01:41] already started last week right amen
[1:01:44] right so the spirit of the Lord is very
[1:01:47] specific
[1:01:49] it's going straight on the same spot so
[1:01:53] in other words when this spirit is
[1:01:55] entering in number one he's going
[1:01:58] straight where darkness is
[1:02:03] in other words if darkness is here when
[1:02:05] the spirit of the Lord entered this
[1:02:07] church he goes right here
[1:02:11] the first person he Shake hand with
[1:02:14] there it is the darkness
[1:02:18] he said good morning Darkness
[1:02:21] you know what Darkness do
[1:02:24] because the one that was created was a
[1:02:26] light
[1:02:28] you know what happened when you are
[1:02:29] bringing light and darkness see light
[1:02:32] you know what happened right it's a very
[1:02:35] beautiful scenario
[1:02:38] everybody okay
[1:02:39] glory to God
[1:02:42] verse 3 and God say Let There Be Water
[1:02:46] light
[1:02:50] so God get into the Earth
[1:02:54] and get in the position where darkness
[1:02:56] is
[1:02:57] and he speak
[1:03:00] let there be light
[1:03:03] what happened with the spoken word
[1:03:08] everybody okay
[1:03:09] let there be light
[1:03:11] and there was water light what does
[1:03:15] light have to do here
[1:03:17] and God saw that Delight
[1:03:20] that he was have good and God did water
[1:03:24] divided the light from Darkness he
[1:03:26] divided the light from water in other
[1:03:29] words God calls a separation
[1:03:34] everybody okay so when the spirit of the
[1:03:38] Lord enter and went where darkness is a
[1:03:42] result in a separation
[1:03:47] in other words the earth now
[1:03:51] become free
[1:03:53] from the grip of Darkness
[1:03:57] everybody okay
[1:03:59] everybody okay
[1:04:06] I didn't intend to do this but I'm gonna
[1:04:10] do that
[1:04:11] job to verse five and God called the
[1:04:15] light water the day and the Darkness he
[1:04:18] called water night and the evening and
[1:04:21] the morning were the first water day
[1:04:26] Darkness was removed
[1:04:30] and pushed that
[1:04:32] somewhere
[1:04:34] everybody okay but Darkness didn't leave
[1:04:37] the Earth completely
[1:04:41] Darkness will leave the Earth
[1:04:44] in the New Jerusalem
[1:04:49] because God called Darkness water
[1:04:58] in the city
[1:05:01] in the city where the camera
[1:05:06] do you want to read it
[1:05:08] you want to read it tell you okay
[1:05:13] let's go to revelation 21.
[1:05:17] don't be shy I already know you
[1:05:20] we know one another don't be shy just
[1:05:22] speak up
[1:05:25] you shy that's your problem you want to
[1:05:27] go home and then what was the scripture
[1:05:28] do you know the scripture and they want
[1:05:30] to say no I didn't know it
[1:05:34] but none of you spoke
[1:05:37] amen
[1:05:39] everybody okay
[1:05:41] this is a difficult territory here
[1:05:45] okay you're the one that asked for it
[1:05:47] let's go to revelation 21.
[1:05:50] if you dare you can say Amen
[1:05:53] you there
[1:05:54] verse 23.
[1:05:57] I don't want to get lost because if I
[1:05:59] move on somebody will continue to think
[1:06:01] over it
[1:06:03] and then can find out
[1:06:05] exactly where it is
[1:06:08] and the devil will be playing with your
[1:06:10] mind and you miss the whole service
[1:06:11] because
[1:06:13] you can't figure it out where the
[1:06:16] the actual scripture is if you there you
[1:06:18] can say amen amen verse 23. and the city
[1:06:22] had no need of the waters son neither of
[1:06:25] the water moon to the water shine in it
[1:06:27] for the glory of God did water lie in it
[1:06:31] and the lamb is the light water verse 25
[1:06:36] and the gates
[1:06:38] of faith shall not be shot at all by
[1:06:41] what
[1:06:42] for there shall be water no night there
[1:06:49] everybody okay go to verse to chapter
[1:06:52] 22.
[1:06:56] you there
[1:06:58] you there
[1:06:59] and there shall be no verse 5 and there
[1:07:03] shall be no water right
[1:07:05] and they shall end this and they need no
[1:07:08] water candle need the water the light
[1:07:11] off from the Sun

[1:07:15] do you see something

[1:07:25] and there shall be no night today

[1:07:31] and
[1:07:33] they need no water candle

[1:09:02] water
[1:09:03] and no water
[1:09:08] so which light is there kill the fire
[1:09:14] do you see why you need to be in the
[1:09:15] holiest
[1:09:18] you see your Tabernacle there
[1:09:23] in other words the other court and the
[1:09:26] holy place is finished
[1:09:28] eternally
[1:09:29] it is the light that was in the holiest
[1:09:33] let's go now read it and this have been
[1:09:35] no night today
[1:09:37] they don't need and they need no candle
[1:09:40] holy place
[1:09:41] neither the light of the sun are they
[1:09:45] called for the Lord give them water the
[1:09:48] light
[1:09:49] the pillar of fire amen and they shall
[1:09:53] reign forever and water in add the word
[1:09:56] in the New Jerusalem
[1:09:58] who will dwell day
[1:10:05] where is roof at now
[1:10:09] where is she in the Tabernacle
[1:10:12] only the people that dwell here
[1:10:18] do you follow me who dwell in New
[1:10:21] Jerusalem
[1:10:23] because when they dwell here they
[1:10:26] already bypass the first light
[1:10:28] and they bypass the second light and
[1:10:31] they are now living by the third right
[1:10:34] everybody else will be outside of the
[1:10:37] city
[1:10:37] [Applause]
[1:10:39] so for you to dwell in the New Jerusalem
[1:10:43] you must first dwell in the third
[1:10:45] portion of the Tabernacle
[1:10:49] have I lost anyone
[1:10:52] Have I Lost You
[1:10:56] Ezekiel chapter 18.
[1:11:04] you want to go to the New Jerusalem
[1:11:06] you want to go to the rapture
[1:11:09] only those that dwell there will be
[1:11:13] taken up
[1:11:17] everybody okay
[1:11:22] if you foolish virgin
[1:11:25] whatever you are
[1:11:29] outside
[1:11:32] everybody okay
[1:11:33] the 144 000 who can get inside with us
[1:11:37] because they will receive the baptism of
[1:11:39] the Holy Ghost in one day
[1:11:42] that's why they escort the brother
[1:11:43] that's why they can be in the city
[1:11:48] so you got to have the qualification of
[1:11:50] the city in you for you to live in that
[1:11:53] City
[1:11:55] in other words you must be the city
[1:11:57] first
[1:12:00] is it okay
[1:12:02] before you enter in the city
[1:12:06] we will get into that okay
[1:12:08] Ezekiel chapter 18 verse 1.
[1:12:13] if you dare you can say it man amen the
[1:12:17] word of the Lord came to me again saying
[1:12:19] what menu
[1:12:21] that you use this proverb concerning the
[1:12:24] land of Israel saying the father have
[1:12:28] eaten sour grape
[1:12:30] and the children teeth are set on the
[1:12:33] water in other words whatever the father
[1:12:36] have done have repercussion on the
[1:12:40] children
[1:12:41] but remember last week
[1:12:43] the predestinated seed make the
[1:12:45] difference even if your father was a
[1:12:48] drunker
[1:12:49] he would die at the Grand canachio
[1:12:53] everybody okay
[1:12:55] verse 3 as I leave say the Lord You
[1:13:00] shall not have occasion anymore to use
[1:13:03] this proverb in water in other words I
[1:13:05] don't want you to use that language
[1:13:07] anymore because if something happened to
[1:13:09] a child you say no this happened to you
[1:13:11] because your father did something bad
[1:13:14] the father ate the sour grip and the
[1:13:16] children are suffering God said no more
[1:13:19] that you need to change that okay what
[1:13:22] is the New Covenant verse 4. behold All
[1:13:26] Souls are water mine
[1:13:29] as the soul of the father so also the
[1:13:33] soul of the sun is water
[1:13:35] they saw that
[1:13:39] in other words whoever does the trouble
[1:13:44] he's going to be responsible himself
[1:13:46] not you doing something wrong and your
[1:13:49] children are suffering
[1:13:50] not David doing something wrong and the
[1:13:54] child got to hell
[1:13:58] everybody okay not Jeff dad's father
[1:14:01] going to a prostitute having a child
[1:14:04] then Jeff that will be blocked from
[1:14:06] heaven
[1:14:09] are we okay
[1:14:12] are we okay
[1:14:13] are we okay
[1:14:15] job to verse 19.
[1:14:19] Hallelujah
[1:14:22] see sadly
[1:14:25] a bird you dead
[1:14:27] yet say you why
[1:14:30] does not the sun bear the iniquity of
[1:14:33] the father
[1:14:34] you remember until the 10th Generation
[1:14:37] when the sun has done that which is
[1:14:40] lawful and right and has kept all my
[1:14:43] statue and has done them he shall surely
[1:14:46] do what live God say wait a minute
[1:14:49] you say child is born and he begin to
[1:14:52] behave right and do things that are
[1:14:54] correctly that child won't die because
[1:14:57] of you
[1:15:00] everybody okay so it becomes now
[1:15:03] individual
[1:15:04] are we okay verse 20. they saw that
[1:15:08] water sinneth it shall do water die
[1:15:13] so a soul can die
[1:15:17] there is a compound meaning to this I'm
[1:15:19] gonna use one Avenue because the other
[1:15:21] one is is a little bit tougher everybody
[1:15:23] okay a soul that sin is someone that
[1:15:27] does so will do what he would die in
[1:15:29] other words a soul can die
[1:15:32] what does it mean it's all dying
[1:15:36] what does it mean
[1:15:39] you see we got our own conception
[1:15:42] on fixing the message
[1:15:44] and we use that intellectual conception
[1:15:47] and put it in the word of God and we are
[1:15:49] confused
[1:15:55] this is the Tabernacle right
[1:15:58] everybody okay the other court is the
[1:16:01] body
[1:16:02] the only place is what
[1:16:06] and the holiest is water
[1:16:08] So when you say the soul die what does
[1:16:11] it mean
[1:16:14] do you know the way we think
[1:16:16] do you know the way we think in the
[1:16:19] message
[1:16:19] we will do this
[1:16:28] and we say the soul is died
[1:16:33] you forget that the holiest is only a
[1:16:36] compartment
[1:16:39] did you get it the holiest is only a
[1:16:43] compartment
[1:16:45] it's only a building a portion of the
[1:16:48] building
[1:16:49] what dies
[1:16:51] is not the building
[1:16:55] that's fine let's continue okay let's
[1:16:58] continue we will pick it up okay
[1:17:00] verse 20. they saw that dies that that
[1:17:04] sins is
[1:17:06] the sun shall not bear the iniquity of
[1:17:09] the father neither shall the father bear
[1:17:11] the iniquity of the water the righteous
[1:17:15] the righteousness of the righteous shall
[1:17:17] be upon and the wickedness of the wicked
[1:17:20] shall be upon in other words whatever
[1:17:23] you do will fall on yourself verse 21
[1:17:25] but if the wicked will turn from his sin
[1:17:29] that he has committed and keep all my
[1:17:32] statute and do that which is lawful and
[1:17:35] right he shall surely water live he
[1:17:38] shall not water so one person would die
[1:17:43] there is a soul that dies
[1:17:47] what does he mean
[1:17:49] let's go to Second Corinthians chapter
[1:17:51] four then we pray
[1:17:58] Hallelujah
[1:17:59] second Corinthians chapter four
[1:18:03] you need your Bible a little bit
[1:18:05] if you dare you can say amen amen
[1:18:10] Lord help me
[1:18:13] you there
[1:18:14] you there
[1:18:17] second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 6.
[1:18:21] remember the first scripture was in
[1:18:23] Genesis the Earth was dark
[1:18:25] and there was Darkness upon the face of
[1:18:27] the deep and the Lord enter and follow
[1:18:30] the darkness and causes water a
[1:18:33] separation
[1:18:36] everybody okay now is he ringing the
[1:18:39] bell now the message is never
[1:18:41] complicated never that's why they took
[1:18:45] somebody who didn't go in PhD
[1:18:48] so God doesn't want to mix it up
[1:18:50] together
[1:18:51] everybody okay
[1:18:52] everybody okay
[1:18:55] now verse 6 for God
[1:18:59] who commended the light where did he do
[1:19:03] it
[1:19:04] in Genesis 1. okay God who commended the
[1:19:09] light to shine Out of Water Darkness so
[1:19:13] in the midst of Darkness
[1:19:16] God turn on the light that's why brother
[1:19:19] Branham preached the message there is
[1:19:20] somebody that can turn on the light when
[1:19:23] everything is dark when God entered
[1:19:25] there he turned on the light
[1:19:27] [Applause]
[1:19:30] everybody okay so Darkness doesn't scare
[1:19:34] God
[1:19:36] as long as God knows what is under the
[1:19:40] darkness
[1:19:48] all right
[1:19:50] there is a ditch
[1:19:52] they put all kinds of stuff there
[1:19:55] everybody okay
[1:19:56] dirty
[1:19:59] your child sleep up
[1:20:01] and fell into there
[1:20:04] so you will be standing up there and say
[1:20:07] come out what will you do
[1:20:11] when you're entering there do you carry
[1:20:13] about what is in the ditch
[1:20:18] what are you looking at
[1:20:21] but if somebody say be careful there are
[1:20:24] germs there be careful don't get there
[1:20:26] there are many germs over there
[1:20:28] are you looking at the gym
[1:20:31] there is something there more precious
[1:20:33] than any germs
[1:20:37] and regardless of the price
[1:20:40] across
[1:20:44] you will clean up later but I need to
[1:20:47] get the boy out
[1:20:49] everybody okay everybody good for God
[1:20:53] who commended the light to shine out of
[1:20:56] water
[1:20:57] has sun in our water
[1:21:01] if God is shining in your heart what was
[1:21:04] in your heart
[1:21:08] is it complicated
[1:21:13] you want me to complicate it
[1:21:16] foreign
[1:21:19] so God is coming
[1:21:22] and he's also entering the light the
[1:21:24] heart that's what brought that's what
[1:21:26] Paul is saying
[1:21:27] so and when he entered the heart God
[1:21:31] Shine the Light so in other words the
[1:21:34] heart was in darkness
[1:21:36] is that complicated
[1:21:43] Amen in other words whatever happened to
[1:21:46] the Earth
[1:21:49] that was just a shadow
[1:21:56] of what God does to a believer
[1:22:02] everybody okay everybody good so when
[1:22:05] God shine Delight what will happen to
[1:22:09] the darkness that is there
[1:22:11] he will cause what again separation
[1:22:22] everybody okay let's read it for God who
[1:22:25] commanded the light to shout out of
[1:22:28] water Darkness has shown in our hearts
[1:22:31] not one person heart so there are many
[1:22:33] hearts
[1:22:35] a heart is a human being
[1:22:40] God will not shine in the heart of a
[1:22:43] beast
[1:22:45] everybody okay
[1:22:47] to give
[1:22:49] the light of the knowledge of who
[1:22:53] the glory of God in the face of Jesus
[1:22:56] Jesus Christ that we have this treasure
[1:22:58] in water the Earth

[1:23:35] might be of who
[1:23:37] and not of what Us in either way you
[1:23:40] have nothing to be glorified
[1:23:44] everybody okay

[1:26:52] clearly two line
[1:26:54] everybody okay we have established the
[1:26:58] Eternal line
[1:27:00] and the temporary line

[1:27:09] eternal life we found out that first of
[1:27:12] all we are a seed
[1:27:15] everybody okay we call that again the
[1:27:18] word
[1:27:19] everybody okay we called it again a
[1:27:22] thought

[1:27:27] attribute
[1:27:29] amen we call it again a germ
[1:27:34] everybody okay all of this is the same
[1:27:37] thing
[1:27:37] so when you read brother Brown I'm
[1:27:39] saying word it means the same thing

[1:52:48] we have a seed
[1:52:50] everybody okay and the seed is water
[1:52:54] water
[1:53:01] so it's also you
[1:53:07] everybody okay everybody okay so they
[1:53:11] were to you
[1:53:14] everybody okay
[1:53:15] everybody good
[1:53:17] this view of the Soul has a beginning
[1:53:21] and the end
[1:53:23] and this you is eternal amen
[1:53:27] everybody okay God is trying to take
[1:53:30] everything of you and make you
[1:53:33] completely eternal
[1:53:34] [Applause]
[1:53:36] but there are some part of you that are
[1:53:40] not Eternal yet
[1:53:41] everybody okay so God is moving in the
[1:53:44] process to start getting whatever is
[1:53:48] temporal and begin to make that eternal
[1:53:52] and he begins first from the inside
[1:53:57] amen but to begin the work he need the
[1:54:01] modem
[1:54:04] everybody okay and he pick up the modem
[1:54:07] and he put in your soul so he can first
[1:54:10] change your soul from a temporary
[1:54:13] resource
[1:54:16] to an eternal soul
[1:54:19] [Applause]
[1:54:23] I'm gonna help you up this way
[1:54:26] God gave Israel the manner
[1:54:30] everybody okay when God brings Manna in
[1:54:33] the morning the Mana only lasted for one
[1:54:35] day
[1:54:36] if you keep it the next day it's rotten
[1:54:39] spoiled completely amen if God give it
[1:54:43] to you tomorrow is spoiled but God told
[1:54:45] Israel pick up a manner
[1:54:50] what do you do with it he said take that
[1:54:53] manner go with faith in the holiest and
[1:54:56] put it there anybody okay when God took
[1:54:59] the man and put it in the Holy do you
[1:55:02] follow me when God came and sat in the
[1:55:05] holiest
[1:55:06] that manner never was destroyed anymore
[1:55:11] everybody okay that manner receives
[1:55:13] something that blocked the process of
[1:55:17] rottening
[1:55:19] [Applause]
[1:55:22] amen even if you keep it for 10 years
[1:55:26] that man is still fresh
[1:55:29] in other words there is something
[1:55:32] eternal that block the natural process
[1:55:35] and the manner begin to act like an
[1:55:39] eternal food
[1:55:43] I don't know if you're getting me so God
[1:55:46] knew that your soul has a beginning
[1:55:49] but God want to make your soul Eternal
[1:55:52] so God have to take that portion of
[1:55:56] Eternity which is your seed and load the
[1:55:59] modem in the soul so that when the modem
[1:56:03] is activated it take hold of your soul

[2:04:33] Spirit when the life leaves this body
[2:04:36] goes in water
[2:04:37] when you live here you go away
[2:04:40] just as when the bad is presented to the
[2:04:43] Earth the spirit comes in when the
[2:04:45] spirit goes out of the body there is a
[2:04:47] body water so we know all we know that
[2:04:50] after this Earthly water be dissolved we
[2:04:54] have water
[2:04:55] that said the spiritual body of the

[2:05:07] the nature of your birth which is bad
[2:05:10] which is the darkness and then you have

[2:05:34] the Lord moved where Darkness was indeed
[2:05:37] water
[2:05:38] and Paul said in the book of Corinthians
[2:05:41] that the same way God did in the Book of
[2:05:45] Genesis he did it also to who
[2:05:48] to us in our water when he get in the
[2:05:52] heart he pushes water
[2:05:54] when he pushes darkness and when he's
[2:05:56] doing water separating
[2:05:59] everybody okay everybody okay

[2:06:08] spirit of God did water
[2:06:10] upon the face of the world move upon the
[2:06:12] face of the water in the beginning back
[2:06:15] there the world was without water and
[2:06:18] water there was nothing but just the
[2:06:21] water Darkness a darkness of chaos and
[2:06:24] what a horrible shape it must have been
[2:06:26] in nothing but but way into water
[2:06:29] Darkness without light or water anything

[2:06:59] spinning Iran lost the GPS doing
[2:07:03] everything the Earth was lost
[2:07:06] what happened
[2:07:08] brother Branham say and that is what we
[2:07:12] become
[2:07:14] from the Earth to us from the Earth to
[2:07:18] us that is what we become when we become
[2:07:21] water wandering Stars away from who God

[2:08:28] purpose for God doing that what was the
[2:08:32] purpose

[2:10:33] beginning God created the water Heavens
[2:10:35] now the world was Without Water full and

[2:11:11] why is God shining his light in your
[2:11:14] heart
[2:11:15] brother brother I'm saying in the
[2:11:16] beginning the reason why he shun his
[2:11:19] life is because her name is the one they
[2:11:22] were seed and God also is Coming to Your
[2:11:25] Heart To Shine the Light because inside
[2:11:28] of you in your heart there is also a
[2:11:32] seed my brother brother I'm here say

[2:12:26] everything the same thing with the water
[2:12:29] a human being is a water child when the
[2:12:32] meat has done water moved away and the
[2:12:35] reveal truth to that water
[2:12:41] it's still water
[2:12:43] and the light of the Gospel
[2:12:46] by the true affirm the casing of the
[2:12:49] water
[2:12:51] he got water life in it is
[2:12:57] he has not he has not got no life in
[2:13:01] water
[2:13:03] everybody clear everybody clear William
[2:13:07] Marion Branham
[2:13:09] the new birth
[2:13:11] the body is what you look at the spirit
[2:13:15] is what control you your soul is the
[2:13:19] what motive
[2:13:21] the motive of that spirit all the water
[2:13:24] nature
[2:13:25] [Music]
[2:13:32] so we came up with two Souls because the
[2:13:35] soul is the nature but you got to be
[2:13:37] clear what you're trying to say
[2:13:39] what two Souls
[2:13:42] what do nature
[2:13:45] one is the predestinated city the second
[2:13:48] one is the darkness that you were born
[2:13:50] under from your father and mother
[2:13:53] everybody okay brother Branham says that
[2:13:57] watch carefully now your soul is the
[2:14:00] motive of water
[2:14:02] or the nature of water
[2:14:04] they saw that the word
[2:14:08] die you are born in the world with a
[2:14:11] water sinful soul
[2:14:13] that said the nature of your spirit is
[2:14:17] how sinful you long for the things of
[2:14:20] the Water World then the Holy Ghost do
[2:14:23] what comes down the spirit of the Lord
[2:14:26] comes down and baptize you and do what
[2:14:28] changes the nature of that Spirit then
[2:14:32] the nature that is left on you is of
[2:14:35] what nothing then you profess that you
[2:14:38] are a water Pilgrim and a water then you
[2:14:41] are how born from above you are from
[2:14:44] water above you are a candidate of water
[2:14:47] you are a new water future in Christ
[2:14:50] Jesus with the same body with the same
[2:14:53] feeling only it has changed and you are
[2:14:56] and your nature of that spirit is
[2:14:59] changed from water unrighteousness to
[2:15:01] water righteous that is so body and

[2:37:26] amen it is called the healing
[2:37:31] of your soul
[2:37:36] up in Matthew 13.
[2:37:41] up in Matthew 13 and I'm going to run

[2:37:48] say amen amen
[2:37:50] you there
[2:37:51] you there
[2:37:54] I'm gonna skip quick
[2:37:56] amen verse 15 for the people's heart is
[2:37:59] what
[2:38:01] grows and their ears are water and their
[2:38:05] eyes they have what clothes less at any
[2:38:08] time they should what with the water and
[2:38:12] here with the water and should
[2:38:14] understand with the what and should be
[2:38:17] how converted when you are understanding
[2:38:20] with your heart
[2:38:24] then you are converted and I should
[2:38:28] water heal them so the conversion is a
[2:38:31] healing to the heart
[2:38:35] everybody okay brother Branham says this
[2:38:38] he says not only to the healing of the
[2:38:42] body but the healing of the water also
[2:38:45] which is how far more essential can you
[2:38:47] give him some more volume
[2:38:50] than the healing of the water the body
[2:38:52] now it is possible that if you live long
[2:38:55] enough you get sick again because
[2:38:57] sickness the Bible say many are the
[2:38:59] Affliction of the righteous but God
[2:39:01] deliver him out of them so we have many
[2:39:04] Affliction promised by the deliverance
[2:39:06] from what
[2:39:11] says this I have been asked several
[2:39:15] times brother Branham when you going to
[2:39:17] start a healing service we have them
[2:39:19] every night we are talking about the
[2:39:22] healing of the water so right right now
[2:39:24] then we can the other would take half
[2:39:29] automatically in other words
[2:39:36] when your soul get quickened with what
[2:39:40] we just demonstrated
[2:39:42] amen when your soul is quitted when the
[2:39:46] modem is activated

[2:40:02] system click on

[2:40:09] everybody okay brother Branham say
[2:40:11] automatically that take place as long as
[2:40:14] we can get the soul
[2:40:17] then we can have our faith
[2:40:21] if you are born again
[2:40:23] correctly
[2:40:25] automatically you have faith you will
[2:40:28] begin to use that faith for your child
[2:40:31] for your school for your work for your
[2:40:34] mother for everything in your life
[2:40:37] because you are wired now

[2:40:47] Lord help me but let me tell you that
[2:40:52] let me tell you let me let them get the
[2:40:54] real Divine water healing the healing of
[2:40:57] the water so which making you preacher
[2:41:00] passage from deaf and to water life and
[2:41:03] then waiting in this old water for
[2:41:06] Redemption of the water body after the
[2:41:09] soul has been redeemed
[2:41:14] everybody okay
[2:41:16] let me straighten up my antenna brother
[2:41:19] Branham saying
[2:41:21] no matter in any kind of service the
[2:41:24] world should have water preeminence it
[2:41:26] should be half first and the healing of
[2:41:29] the soul is always first why
[2:41:33] when a man is Born Again of the spirit
[2:41:36] of God he's how Immortal they drop you
[2:41:39] from the lower to the upper
[2:41:42] eternal life and it shall never water
[2:41:43] perish but when a man is healed of his
[2:41:46] body it's just for a water military time
[2:41:49] but Salvation of the soul is how forever
[2:41:52] he becomes a new creature in him when he
[2:41:55] is healed of his water so
[2:41:59] everybody okay
[2:42:00] William Branham then I can run quickly
[2:42:04] Satan will be taken from the Earth
[2:42:08] just exactly laxative was taken from you

[2:50:30] house
[2:50:31] the father
[2:50:32] has
[2:50:34] one house
[2:50:39] see the intellect
[2:50:41] how are we going away from God one house
[2:50:47] then we begin to say yes there is many
[2:50:49] bedrooms
[2:50:51] that's the way we do
[2:50:52] because it's our father so you're
[2:50:54] looking at your father here with a house
[2:50:56] a house from your sister your house for
[2:50:58] your brother so that's how we look
[2:51:02] in my father has
[2:51:05] r r is which verb where I'm in which
[2:51:09] time
[2:51:10] which time
[2:51:14] it's present so when Jesus is talking
[2:51:18] no it's already there
[2:51:21] I'm going slowly in my father's house I
[2:51:24] have many mansions now how can a house
[2:51:27] have mentioned
[2:51:30] imagine is a house right
[2:51:35] everybody okay so there is a house in
[2:51:37] the house
[2:51:38] everybody okay
[2:51:40] so this mentioned
[2:51:42] are already existing
[2:51:45] because Jesus didn't say will be
[2:51:50] they are
[2:51:52] many mentioned and if he in other words
[2:51:57] they already were there if we were not
[2:52:00] so I would have what I told you in other
[2:52:04] words dimensions of the house of God
[2:52:07] already existed
[2:52:11] everybody okay
[2:52:13] I've got to prepare a place for you I
[2:52:16] thought he has a house
[2:52:20] I thought God have a house I'm just
[2:52:22] reading the scripture I thought God said
[2:52:24] he has a house
[2:52:26] amen why is he building another house
[2:52:30] foreign
[2:52:33] and and not only he has a house in his
[2:52:36] house there are many places so why is he
[2:52:39] looking for another place
[2:52:43] everybody okay in my father's house
[2:52:46] there are many water
[2:52:47] if he were not so I would have what I
[2:52:50] got to prepare a place for for you and
[2:52:53] if I go in either way that place is not

[2:53:29] many so when you get there they are

[3:07:27] before they don't know it
[3:07:30] there it is
[3:07:32] why Peter
[3:07:34] glory to God and one he had considered
[3:07:37] the thing he came to the house of Mary
[3:07:40] the mother of who John who's your name
[3:07:42] was who where many were gathered
[3:07:45] together with doing what praying for
[3:07:47] Peter they thought Peter was dead they
[3:07:50] brought Peter out Peter is coming at the

[3:16:51] Heavenly Father
[3:16:53] Lord we are approaching you humbly again
[3:16:55] this afternoon
[3:16:57] father thanking you for your grace
[3:16:59] for your love and for your mercy and
[3:17:02] father helping us Lord unloaded
[3:17:05] this difficult lesson now about the two
[3:17:09] Souls
[3:17:10] the two natures
[3:17:13] father anybody who is here
[3:17:17] can pinpoint in their life
[3:17:19] that they understand now that there were
[3:17:22] two of them
[3:17:25] there was a voice in them
[3:17:28] that could tell them this was wrong
[3:17:31] there was a little voice that could tell
[3:17:33] them
[3:17:35] the way you did
[3:17:37] the way you treated your friend
[3:17:39] the way you responded to your mother was
[3:17:41] not right
[3:17:42] but sometimes they struggle with it
[3:17:46] because of sin they go stubborn
[3:17:49] but they know
[3:17:50] that something bothered them
[3:17:53] and father today
[3:17:55] you just came by
[3:17:57] to remind them
[3:17:59] that all those things that happen in
[3:18:02] your life
[3:18:03] was only an indicator
[3:18:06] that you were carrier of a higher Cedar
[3:18:11] from a higher civilization
[3:18:13] and you are called to the mark of a high
[3:18:16] calling
[3:18:18] and you are my children
[3:18:21] I know you have been trapped
[3:18:23] I know you did things that were wrong
[3:18:26] I know some of them you are regretting
[3:18:29] that if I would if I could have been
[3:18:32] given opportunity to start over
[3:18:34] I would not have made such a stupid
[3:18:36] mistake
[3:18:38] I would not have been involved into that
[3:18:41] but I know everything
[3:18:43] if I know you so much that I can
[3:18:46] describe you this morning
[3:18:48] don't you think I know you're gonna go
[3:18:49] through what you went through
[3:18:51] don't you remember the man in John 9
[3:18:54] that me purposely
[3:18:59] let him come to this world blind
[3:19:02] not because of his father
[3:19:04] but because I wanted to share something
[3:19:11] I'm not looking at what you think all
[3:19:13] the time
[3:19:15] I'm not looking at what people are
[3:19:17] saying
[3:19:18] I know what I put in you
[3:19:20] and I have confidence in you
[3:19:23] that's why I am talking to you
[3:19:30] you have been pardoned
[3:19:32] everything else has been demolished
[3:19:34] when you talk to me
[3:19:36] talk to me as a son
[3:19:39] talk to me as a daughter
[3:19:42] show me that love that I'm longing for
[3:19:47] I want to see you happy
[3:19:49] I want to see you talking to me like a
[3:19:51] strong like a young adult
[3:19:54] who is ready to take on responsibility
[3:19:57] because there are things that I could
[3:19:59] not finish
[3:20:00] yes I left it so that you can continue
[3:20:02] to do it
[3:20:08] but you're looking at what the devil is
[3:20:10] showing you
[3:20:11] I knew all about it
[3:20:13] if I would have taken care of everything
[3:20:16] that the devil have showed me about you
[3:20:19] I would not have come to you but that's
[3:20:22] not what I'm looking at
[3:20:23] I'm looking at what I have in my profile
[3:20:26] in my gallery I always seen you
[3:20:30] don't you remember the Prodigal Son
[3:20:33] do you think it's the money that I was
[3:20:34] longing for
[3:20:36] all I was looking is for a child to come
[3:20:39] back
[3:20:40] that's all I was looking for I know you
[3:20:44] would not listen to me that's why I gave
[3:20:46] you the leeway to go
[3:20:48] until you reach the pig pen
[3:20:50] and who we manage you that I was there
[3:20:53] Romeo who reminded you that the servant
[3:20:56] in my house I better fed than where you
[3:20:59] are he was that modem that I put in you
[3:21:02] I know there is no way you can go far
[3:21:04] away that's why when you coming you
[3:21:07] didn't see me in the house you saw me
[3:21:09] outside waiting because I knew you were
[3:21:12] coming
[3:21:13] father may you Quicken that Revelation
[3:21:15] to your children may you bring them back
[3:21:18] to a higher level so that they can
[3:21:20] behave like children of the king no
[3:21:24] matter the circumstances may they be
[3:21:26] like that slave with a chest up knowing
[3:21:29] that from a far land away
[3:21:33] I am a son of a king
[3:21:36] that's the best
[3:21:39] opium
[3:21:41] that can soothe anything
[3:21:44] any perplexity that the devil can bring
[3:21:48] we will not be destroyed we thank you
[3:21:51] for the patience father touch those that
[3:21:53] are sick may you heal them this morning
[3:21:56] Father Quicken those seeds that are
[3:21:59] still lingering
[3:22:01] and give them strength to overcome the
[3:22:04] things of the world

[3:22:08] automatically the remaining will take
