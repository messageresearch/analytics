[23:55] we have a very special young man today
[23:58] with a with a birthday
[24:01] turning seven years old which is hard to

[24:42] bless your heart sir and we love you
[24:44] your whole family here loves you with
[24:47] all our hearts we sure do
[24:49] amen
[24:53] I am
[24:54] I I wanted to kind of update everybody I
[24:57] don't know if you all know brother
[24:57] Michael Tech from Beach Island South
[25:00] Carolina he was in a pretty tragic
[25:02] accident the other day and uh
[25:05] they finally let his wife go home they
[25:09] hit the car accident was on his side of
[25:11] the car
[25:13] he's got like three broken ribs a
[25:15] punctured lung he's got a bruised
[25:17] shoulder
[25:18] he's got blood on the brain
[25:21] there is an aneurysm present so they're
[25:23] trying to keep his um they're trying to
[25:26] you know get the blood off of his brain
[25:27] but when you start level you know
[25:29] elevating and and all it it deals with
[25:32] the blood pressure and it can't go high
[25:35] because it'll cause the aneurysm to
[25:37] burst which will be fatal
[25:39] I don't know how well you all know him
[25:41] I've known him for a long time
[25:44] um the last time I did see him he
[25:46] preached Al Raven's funeral and I said
[25:48] man that was beautiful preached mine I'd
[25:50] like for you to preach mine you know if
[25:52] I had I don't think I'm gonna have one
[25:54] but anyways
[25:56] seriously
[25:57] he needs prayer he needs prayer really
[26:00] bad and he is just such a pressure
[26:02] precious brother
[26:03] he doesn't you know when he preaches he
[26:05] doesn't get loud he doesn't just
[26:08] preaches and it's the truth and he
[26:10] believes the truth so let's remember him
[26:13] and lift him up before the Lord he's
[26:16] probably got to be close to 80 I guess
[26:18] if anybody knows him that well he's got
[26:21] to be
[26:22] so he has had a heart surgery previously
[26:25] so the his heart was torn they can't do
[26:28] surgery to repair a tear in his aorta
[26:32] so it's just it's it looks bleak to us
[26:36] okay
[26:38] but we serve a God that can he can go
[26:41] home tomorrow amen

[58:12] and the Four and Twenty Elders fell down
[58:16] before the land having every one of them
[58:19] Harps and golden vows full of others

[59:00] hill we bring stuff even song
[59:03] that were never there before

[59:26] he said saying you are worthy to take
[59:29] the book
[59:30] and to open this Hills thereof
[59:33] for you were slain
[59:36] and have redeemed us to God by your
[59:39] blood out of what every kindred
[59:42] my friend here you go away with

[1:00:00] Hallelujah glory to God
[1:00:04] praise God when I sit at home I review
[1:00:07] the sermon I can hear it moving move I
[1:00:09] say okay and now it's working praise God
[1:00:13] Amen and sometimes he say hallelujah God
[1:00:15] I say oh my God that's my God
[1:00:19] so keep on that Firing Line you're doing
[1:00:22] very good
[1:00:23] amen he said you were slain and have
[1:00:26] redeemers to God by your blood out of
[1:00:29] every kindred
[1:00:31] and tongue and people and Nation
[1:00:33] verse 10 and has made us to our god what
[1:00:39] and water because your Melchizedek
[1:00:42] himself is a king and a priest so in
[1:00:46] other words this opening of the book
[1:00:50] this breaking of the seals
[1:00:53] amen open something
[1:00:57] that is pulling Kings
[1:01:04] everybody here but we are not just King
[1:01:07] we are like our father
[1:01:10] because our father he's a king and he's
[1:01:12] a priest so I cannot be just a king I am
[1:01:16] a king and I am also a priest
[1:01:23] everybody okay
[1:01:25] everybody okay
[1:01:27] throughout the seven churches the lamb
[1:01:30] was a priest
[1:01:33] everybody okay but at the end he comes
[1:01:37] as the King as a lion
[1:01:39] so we are also lamb and lion
[1:01:45] you are also a Lambert
[1:01:47] and sometimes you both like a lion
[1:01:51] amen especially when it comes to sin
[1:01:55] amen
[1:01:57] [Laughter]
[1:02:00] if you just slam blam blam blam blame
[1:02:02] blame blame that don't work
[1:02:04] there is a time that we get to a
[1:02:06] boldness of a lion when we talk to the
[1:02:09] devil face to face
[1:02:13] when he wrote like a lion and a roar
[1:02:16] also
[1:02:17] [Laughter]
[1:02:19] say who you're talking to
[1:02:21] do you know who I am
[1:02:24] I know who I am
[1:02:27] you don't talk to me like that and this
[1:02:31] is the last time you ever talk to me
[1:02:33] like that
[1:02:33] [Applause]
[1:02:35] [Laughter]
[1:02:36] [Applause]
[1:02:37] [Music]
[1:02:40] amen so when the book is open it's
[1:02:44] pulling Kings out
[1:02:50] the Bible say he has made us water Kings
[1:02:53] and water why do you are why why are you
[1:02:56] supposed to be a king remember he is the
[1:02:59] king of
[1:03:01] foreign
[1:03:03] right it's just the top King so this
[1:03:06] breaking of the seals
[1:03:09] amen brings Kings out
[1:03:12] and these kings are Kings and Priests
[1:03:16] glory to God Amen and then we shall
[1:03:20] water Rain On The Water who Reign is it
[1:03:24] a prehistoric King it's a king that rain
[1:03:27] so the book will pull Kings out because
[1:03:31] the time of the rain is coming up so
[1:03:35] they need to bring the king out prepare
[1:03:38] them for them to begin to reign
[1:03:41] the opening of the seals
[1:03:44] let's go to revelation 13. Oh Glory to
[1:03:47] God
[1:03:50] Lord help me
[1:03:52] once the time goes quickly Sunday is
[1:03:55] trying to flies again
[1:03:57] amen Revelation 13 verse 1.
[1:04:02] you know what it means now
[1:04:04] and I stood upon the sand of the sea and
[1:04:07] I saw a beast to rise up everybody clear
[1:04:09] of the sea having seven heads you know
[1:04:12] now what it means and ten horns and upon
[1:04:14] his head and his horns ten crowns we
[1:04:17] understand that they are crying because
[1:04:19] they're kings
[1:04:20] amen and upon his head the same uh upon
[1:04:24] his head the name of blasphemy and the
[1:04:28] Beast I'm trying to go quickly which I
[1:04:31] saw was like to a leopard when his feet
[1:04:35] were as the feet of a bear and his mouth
[1:04:38] as the mouth of a lion and the dragon
[1:04:40] gave him his power and his seat and the
[1:04:44] great Authority in other words this
[1:04:46] beasts become the devil
[1:04:49] because he's operating with the power of
[1:04:51] the Devil with the authority of the
[1:04:53] devil and he's taking the seat the place
[1:04:56] of the devil on this Earth amen
[1:04:59] and I saw one of his head as he were
[1:05:02] wounded to death you know what he means
[1:05:04] and his deadly wound was healed and all
[1:05:07] the world wander after the Beast if you
[1:05:10] notice here there is not a woman here
[1:05:15] it is only the Beast
[1:05:17] because the combination is a woman and a
[1:05:20] beast but here it's only the Beast
[1:05:22] everybody okay
[1:05:24] verse 4 and they worship the Dragon
[1:05:28] which gave power to the Beast
[1:05:31] you're worshiping the devil everybody
[1:05:34] okay because the dragon is the old
[1:05:36] serpent which is sitting on the devil
[1:05:38] amen
[1:05:39] which gave power to the Beast and they
[1:05:41] worship the Beast saying who is like the
[1:05:45] Beast who is able to make water it's a
[1:05:49] beast that can make war
[1:05:53] this Beast can make war
[1:05:58] Hallelujah and then verse 5 and there
[1:06:03] was they were and there was given to him
[1:06:05] a mouth
[1:06:07] the Beast remember already have a mouth
[1:06:10] amen but they gave him a bath
[1:06:14] everybody okay so this beasts become
[1:06:17] have now a month
[1:06:22] okay
[1:06:23] can a dog speak
[1:06:25] can a leopard speak no can a bear speak
[1:06:29] no but if you give him a human mouth
[1:06:33] he can speak
[1:06:36] amen so this Beast become a man
[1:06:40] everybody okay
[1:06:42] amen because you already have a mouth
[1:06:44] but that mouth was not speaking that man
[1:06:46] falls only to destroy Mana they give him
[1:06:49] a mouth that he can speak in other words
[1:06:52] the beasts have now a spokesman
[1:06:55] he have a prophet
[1:06:59] he have somebody that speak for him
[1:07:02] everybody okay
[1:07:04] a beast have now a month
[1:07:07] he have a person
[1:07:09] he have a a prophet he have a
[1:07:13] representative
[1:07:16] amen
[1:07:18] glory to God hallelujah and he says that
[1:07:23] the the amount of speaking water
[1:07:26] great things
[1:07:28] Lord help me to reach that point
[1:07:30] this month is speaking great things I'm
[1:07:34] writing this because you need to be very
[1:07:37] careful when you read the scripture even
[1:07:39] the way scripture are placed they are
[1:07:42] placed with the mathematics
[1:07:45] one of this day you will see
[1:07:48] do you remember do you know why
[1:07:50] Revelation 6 must be before Revelation 7
[1:07:53] must be before Revelation 8 and that
[1:07:55] must be before revelation
[1:07:57] at 10 and then 11. do you know why they
[1:07:59] followed himself like that
[1:08:05] I don't want you to go there okay

[1:08:44] three equal and eight plus three equal
[1:08:47] when you go vertical it's following up
[1:08:54] that's why brother Branham said the
[1:08:56] scripture are mathematically

[1:12:58] what happened in here
[1:13:06] everybody okay
[1:13:08] everybody okay
[1:13:09] I leave this you feel in the blood
[1:13:14] but watch what happened here
[1:13:17] they are calling the hundred and forty
[1:13:19] four thousand
[1:13:22] which is the elect of the Jews
[1:13:25] everybody okay what do you think
[1:13:27] happened in Revelation 10
[1:13:29] he's calling who
[1:13:34] [Applause]
[1:13:35] [Music]
[1:13:41] let's erase that quickly okay so we go
[1:13:44] back to our subject make sense so when
[1:13:46] you read the reason why I'm saying this
[1:13:48] when you read the Bible
[1:13:50] be careful even a Karma means something
[1:13:55] everybody okay oh what a lovely book is
[1:13:58] the Bible
[1:13:59] I can give you quote that goes there
[1:14:01] boom boom boom but if I start right now
[1:14:05] before you know you're looking at the
[1:14:07] clock
[1:14:08] where were we yet
[1:14:11] 13. amen
[1:14:16] verse 5 and there was given to him a man
[1:14:19] speaking great things and blasphemies
[1:14:21] and power was given him to continue for
[1:14:24] water 40 and two months you remember
[1:14:27] that Sunday now you understand 42 amen
[1:14:30] and he opened his mouth
[1:14:33] when that mouth that was given to him
[1:14:35] when he opened his mouth the Bible says
[1:14:39] that and he opened his mouth in
[1:14:42] blasphemy against who God to blaspheme
[1:14:46] his name his Tabernacle and them that
[1:14:49] dwell in heaven so this is a dirty mouth
[1:14:52] completely against God
[1:14:54] everybody okay verse 7 he was given to
[1:14:57] him to make war with water so when he
[1:15:01] makes War he makes War also with descent
[1:15:05] man
[1:15:07] no wonder the woman is drunk with blood
[1:15:10] amen with the scent and overcome them
[1:15:14] that's why he overcome Moses and Elijah
[1:15:16] after the prophecy you remember last
[1:15:18] Sunday
[1:15:19] and power was giving him over all
[1:15:24] Kindred and tongue and Nation so he can
[1:15:28] kill anybody he wanted
[1:15:30] this is a beast a job to verse 18.
[1:15:34] who is this Beast again refreshing
[1:15:37] quickly father help me amen
[1:15:39] and here is wisdom let him that has
[1:15:43] understanding count the number of the
[1:15:45] so we're talking about the Beast there
[1:15:47] is no woman here if you're sleeping you
[1:15:49] need a wake up amen Shake somebody
[1:15:51] behind you like besides you say shake
[1:15:54] shake everybody okay
[1:15:57] for it is the number of a man
[1:16:01] everybody okay so the Beast is a man
[1:16:06] it's a prophet he has a mouth a person a
[1:16:10] prophet a representative and that
[1:16:12] representative is not a woman
[1:16:15] everybody okay it is a man
[1:16:19] and the man have how many numbers
[1:16:22] he have a trinity of six everybody okay
[1:16:26] let's go to Revelation 17 then we can
[1:16:29] pray
[1:16:30] glory to God
[1:16:34] verse seven it will be the reading there
[1:16:37] Lord help me
[1:16:39] and the angel said to me wherefore did
[1:16:42] that Maryville
[1:16:43] did you marry did you Marvel I will tell
[1:16:46] you the mystery of the woman and the
[1:16:49] Beast that carry her now it is not just
[1:16:51] the Beast there is a woman that is
[1:16:54] associated with this beast that's sad so
[1:16:57] the system of the devil like we went
[1:16:59] through operate with the woman and with
[1:17:02] the Beast so if you want to really
[1:17:04] destroy the Devil clearly you have to
[1:17:08] destroy the woman and the Beast because
[1:17:10] they are a unit everybody okay so now we
[1:17:14] have a woman
[1:17:15] that is on top of her and the woman is a
[1:17:19] church
[1:17:20] which is also a city on Seven Hills
[1:17:24] because churches are also City Ephesus
[1:17:27] was a city pergamos was a city tatarian
[1:17:30] was a city it was also a church
[1:17:34] Jerusalem is a city but Jerusalem is the
[1:17:37] church
[1:17:39] because Paul said the Heavenly Jerusalem
[1:17:41] who is our mother
[1:17:43] so the city doesn't give birth to people
[1:17:47] okay okay yeah man it's a language on
[1:17:52] the Bible and the Beast I carry here
[1:17:54] which have seven heads and ten horns we
[1:17:55] went through this Beast and the Beast
[1:17:58] that you saw remember not the woman the
[1:18:00] Beast that you saw was and is not and
[1:18:04] shall ascend from the bottomless feet
[1:18:06] and go into Perdition and they that
[1:18:08] dwell on the Earth shall wander the same
[1:18:10] thing that happened in Revelation 13.
[1:18:12] whose name were not written in the Book
[1:18:15] of Life from the foundation of the word
[1:18:17] when they behold the Beast not the woman
[1:18:20] that was and is not and yet is amen so
[1:18:24] this Beast here we seen that was that
[1:18:26] was not that it was a succession of her
[1:18:29] Pope that's why we say the Beast is
[1:18:31] giving a mouth person a prophet which is
[1:18:34] a false prophet a representative a man
[1:18:37] with three six everybody clear so far
[1:18:40] praise God now job to verse 9 and here
[1:18:43] is the mind which has the wisdom the
[1:18:46] seven heads are seven mountains we went
[1:18:48] to that which on which the woman sits
[1:18:51] which is a city but there are also seven
[1:18:53] Kings this is where we were last Sunday
[1:18:55] remember
[1:18:57] and father Fallen that history and one
[1:19:00] is history and the other one is not yet
[1:19:03] come there's still natural king of Rome
[1:19:07] and when he come he must continue a
[1:19:09] short space we went through this verse
[1:19:12] 11 and the Beast that was and is not
[1:19:16] even he is the eighth everybody okay now
[1:19:20] we have seven Kings you remember last
[1:19:23] Sunday amen this beast when John gave
[1:19:27] his description John bring the
[1:19:30] description as having ten horns
[1:19:32] everybody care and at seven heads
[1:19:36] when we go to Revelation 17 we see a
[1:19:39] woman associated with the Beast 10 horns
[1:19:42] seven heads and the seven heads here we
[1:19:45] found out that they are natural King but
[1:19:47] they say that the Beast himself is also
[1:19:50] a king
[1:19:51] but he is not a natural King remember
[1:19:54] last Sunday he is a spiritual king
[1:19:56] that's why he's number eight
[1:19:59] everybody care he's number eight of the
[1:20:02] seven so when you count one two three
[1:20:04] four five six seven you move from Pagan
[1:20:07] room and you change into paper room now
[1:20:11] the kingdom is not naturally it becomes
[1:20:13] spiritually the pope take over Rome Rome
[1:20:17] is no longer a natural Kingdom now it is
[1:20:20] a spiritual Kingdom it is no longer the
[1:20:22] nation of Italy now we become the
[1:20:25] Vatican
[1:20:26] everybody okay
[1:20:29] everybody okay praise God now go uh job
[1:20:32] to verse uh 12 and the tenthorne
[1:20:35] everybody okay which you saw are Ten
[1:20:38] Kings
[1:20:40] so we found out that we have the Beast
[1:20:44] we have the woman and the Bible also
[1:20:47] said that we have ten horns
[1:20:49] and we know the horns are dictator we
[1:20:52] went through this which is the power of
[1:20:54] communism
[1:20:57] everybody care so there is a connection
[1:20:59] between the Beast and communism
[1:21:04] everybody okay
[1:21:06] everybody okay not the realm of Russia
[1:21:11] by the Bay
[1:21:13] everybody okay because the beasts
[1:21:15] himself have a part that look like a
[1:21:18] bear his feet was like a bear anybody
[1:21:20] okay so there is a mixture of that bear
[1:21:22] into the Beast we okay now okay a job
[1:21:26] now
[1:21:27] job valve to verse uh
[1:21:30] 12 and the ten horns which you saw are
[1:21:32] Ten Kings which have received no Kingdom
[1:21:36] as yet but we see Power as king one hour
[1:21:39] with the Beast they have one man and
[1:21:41] shall give their power and strength to
[1:21:43] the Beast watch
[1:21:45] these shall make war with the lamb the
[1:21:49] one making War here with the lamb is not
[1:21:53] the Beast
[1:21:55] I want I want
[1:21:57] I want us to be clear
[1:21:59] these the business one the one
[1:22:04] brother Branham said not let this be
[1:22:07] known scripture does not play with water
[1:22:10] all right whatever is in the record is
[1:22:14] there for the anointed eyes to water see
[1:22:16] it is therefore a water you need to be
[1:22:19] very careful when you're reading the
[1:22:21] Bible this is a holy book
[1:22:24] this is our foundation
[1:22:26] you don't read it like newspaper
[1:22:30] you don't just read it because brother
[1:22:32] Branham say read it then you go again
[1:22:33] you won't get nothing
[1:22:36] everybody okay
[1:22:37] let's go now
[1:22:39] they say that these the ten Kingdom or
[1:22:41] the 10 King make war with the lamb and
[1:22:46] the lamb shall overcome them for he is
[1:22:49] Lord of lords and King of Kings
[1:22:51] everybody okay now
[1:22:53] and they that are with him are called
[1:22:56] Chosen and water faithful so the lamb
[1:22:58] when he goes to battle with sin he
[1:23:00] doesn't go himself he's coming together
[1:23:03] with his brother amen but right here the
[1:23:07] one who's making war with the lamb is
[1:23:11] only the Ten Kings
[1:23:13] everybody okay
[1:23:14] so according to Revelation 17
[1:23:17] according to Revelation 17 amen the war
[1:23:22] happened between the ten king or between
[1:23:26] communism
[1:23:28] everybody care
[1:23:30] and the lamb
[1:23:33] with his brother
[1:23:36] everybody okay it is not the Beast that
[1:23:39] is fighting the land
[1:23:42] everybody okay it is not the woman that
[1:23:45] is fighting the name
[1:23:47] everybody okay we got the Beast we got
[1:23:50] the woman we got the horns the one
[1:23:53] making War right here is the bed
[1:23:58] everybody care
[1:24:00] amen
[1:24:01] glory to God
[1:24:03] job to verse 15 and he says to me the
[1:24:07] water Waters they watered us that sounds
[1:24:10] really good the god the water which you
[1:24:13] sow where the horse sit our people
[1:24:17] remember this remember this I'm telling
[1:24:19] you to remember this our people and
[1:24:23] multitude and nation and songs
[1:24:26] watch now again the ten horn not the
[1:24:29] Beast
[1:24:31] the ten horn which you saw upon the
[1:24:35] Beast these shall head to who they don't
[1:24:39] hurt the Beast
[1:24:43] I'm going slowly it's a surgery my
[1:24:46] friend amen the Beast is a man but upon
[1:24:51] the Beast there is a woman it's a
[1:24:53] husband with his wife
[1:24:55] everybody okay the ten horns are heading
[1:24:59] the woman the wife
[1:25:02] everybody okay
[1:25:03] did that the scripture didn't say they
[1:25:06] hate the Beast they hate the whole the
[1:25:09] woman everybody okay they had the war
[1:25:12] the whole and shall make her desolate
[1:25:16] and naked and shall eat her flesh and
[1:25:19] shall burn her with water so these
[1:25:23] communism here the communism not only is
[1:25:27] he gonna make war with the lamb but he
[1:25:30] will also destroy the woman
[1:25:34] everybody okay the woman which we know
[1:25:38] is a church and a city everybody here
[1:25:41] that's why brother Branham said the
[1:25:42] Vatican will be burned with an atomic
[1:25:45] bomb because remember last Sunday the
[1:25:47] Third World War
[1:25:48] the third world it says whoa whoa whoa
[1:25:51] the third one is an atomic war you
[1:25:54] remember that Sunday because the whole
[1:25:56] world is brewing slowly going toward it
[1:25:58] anybody okay now verse 17
[1:26:03] for God has put in the heart to fulfill
[1:26:06] his will and to agree and give their
[1:26:09] Kingdom to death not to the woman
[1:26:14] are we okay
[1:26:16] are you opening your scripture
[1:26:19] they're giving their Kingdom to the
[1:26:21] Beast not to the woman but the beasts
[1:26:24] and the woman are one
[1:26:26] everybody okay
[1:26:28] everybody okay
[1:26:29] praise God
[1:26:32] until the word of the Lord shall be
[1:26:35] fulfilled and the woman which you sow is
[1:26:38] the greatest city which went over the
[1:26:40] kings of the remember this woman
[1:26:45] ran over water
[1:26:48] the Kings
[1:26:50] of the Earth
[1:26:52] scripture don't play with word
[1:26:55] she doesn't rain only upon Kings
[1:27:03] these kings are the kings of what
[1:27:06] they are the kings of water
[1:27:08] but what when the seals are broken they
[1:27:12] are calling the king from where
[1:27:16] this King are from where
[1:27:19] this King their King our father is for
[1:27:23] money
[1:27:25] melchiza the king of water with Salem
[1:27:29] that is in Palestine which element
[1:27:33] because Abraham was looking for a city
[1:27:36] that God has built did you see God
[1:27:39] building Jerusalem
[1:27:43] so we got Kings somewhere there and we
[1:27:46] got kings that are somewhere
[1:27:48] but the woman rule over the king that
[1:27:51] are not the king from there because from
[1:27:55] there the Neymar written in the Lamb's
[1:27:59] Book of water
[1:28:02] everybody okay
[1:28:04] everybody okay okay let's pray Heavenly
[1:28:08] Father

[1:28:42] them tired until they cannot focus
[1:28:45] father we rebuke them back to Hell In

[1:28:50] healing take place this morning and may
[1:28:52] you give strength Lord father and open
[1:28:54] up a window of Revelation this morning
[1:28:56] in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:29:00] glory to God you buckle up we're going
[1:29:03] to be living amen my subject this
[1:29:05] morning is the four phases of roof the
[1:29:08] second Trinity
[1:29:12] and the second order
[1:29:15] the four phases of roof the second
[1:29:18] Trinity and the second oil everybody
[1:29:21] okay
[1:29:23] when we're dealing with the all we know
[1:29:25] that there was two oil
[1:29:27] there was a no that went with the virgin
[1:29:30] everybody okay but there was another all
[1:29:32] that was reserved until a certain time
[1:29:35] according to the parable of Matthew 25
[1:29:38] we found out that the Virgin all of them
[1:29:42] went
[1:29:42] and they were going toward the budget
[1:29:45] now toward the bread room and as they
[1:29:47] were making their way to the bridegroom
[1:29:49] some of them have oil
[1:29:52] and because of that oil they were called
[1:29:55] wise virgins everybody here
[1:29:57] that oil existed all along
[1:30:03] everybody okay as they were still using
[1:30:06] the first oil the second oil was there
[1:30:09] all the time
[1:30:11] he was just not used yet
[1:30:15] everybody okay everybody okay so the
[1:30:19] second oil is not something that is just
[1:30:22] new
[1:30:24] it is something that was there
[1:30:26] but it was still dormant
[1:30:30] it was an oil that was still dormant
[1:30:33] he was a no that was not used before
[1:30:37] amen he was and all that was still in

[1:32:39] this year that this oil is the voice
[1:32:41] that spoke and that said behold the
[1:32:45] bridegroom and that voice we know he was
[1:32:47] a person
[1:32:49] that was not the bridegroom but he was a
[1:32:52] person that was introducing the
[1:32:54] bridegroom
[1:32:55] everybody okay so far why are you saying
[1:32:59] that
[1:33:00] what is going on
[1:33:02] brother Branham says this very familiar
[1:33:05] he said now this messenger we went
[1:33:07] through this
[1:33:09] of Malachi fall
[1:33:11] and revelation 10. we talk about man of
[1:33:14] Cry 4 we reviewed them last Sunday
[1:33:16] is going to do how many things
[1:33:19] yes my brother how many fingers two
[1:33:21] things one
[1:33:23] according to Malachi 4 he will turn the
[1:33:27] heart of the children to water the
[1:33:30] father so this voice here
[1:33:32] this man this person this Foreigner
[1:33:37] anybody care we'll do two things
[1:33:41] the first thing he's gonna do everybody
[1:33:43] care he will return
[1:33:47] everybody care the heart of the children
[1:33:50] everybody care unto their father
[1:33:54] yeah
[1:33:55] everybody Kia the church is far gone
[1:33:59] the church is far progress but as the
[1:34:03] church was progressing the church was
[1:34:06] moving away from the apostolic faith
[1:34:10] everybody here that was once delivered
[1:34:12] to the center
[1:34:14] until by the time we reached out this
[1:34:16] year we are under a bunch of confusion
[1:34:19] everybody okay so when the voice comes
[1:34:23] everybody okay the voice is gonna take
[1:34:26] the church follow me carefully
[1:34:28] everybody okay and return to church by
[1:34:32] in other words that voice turned the
[1:34:35] church back
[1:34:36] to its origin
[1:34:42] everybody okay
[1:34:43] which is Pentecost
[1:34:46] everybody okay but that voice does
[1:34:49] something else
[1:34:51] according to brother Branham II he will
[1:34:54] reveal the water this is of the water
[1:34:57] that gave you your Jubilee in Revelation
[1:35:01] which are the civilization contained in
[1:35:04] the seven The Seven Seals were not new
[1:35:09] everybody okay the Seven Seals were
[1:35:13] there seized since Genesis all this time
[1:35:16] they were just sealed
[1:35:19] everybody here but this Messenger will
[1:35:23] open the seventh year actually he's not
[1:35:26] the one opening that person it is the
[1:35:29] Lamb that opened the book and give it to
[1:35:32] the messenger so that he can blow the
[1:35:35] trumpet
[1:35:37] everybody okay everybody okay so the
[1:35:40] second thing he does he opened the seven
[1:35:43] Thunders
[1:35:44] which are the Revelation contained in
[1:35:47] the seven water everybody care so the
[1:35:50] anointing that comes here
[1:35:52] do two things
[1:35:54] everybody okay number one he bring you
[1:35:58] back from your origin
[1:36:01] everybody okay and number two it will
[1:36:05] unfold the book
[1:36:07] but the book here the seventh seal where
[1:36:10] the seals that were blocking a book
[1:36:15] because in Revelations 5 we found a man
[1:36:18] that was sitting with a book in his hand
[1:36:19] everybody okay and the book will not
[1:36:22] clearly by the scripture that the book
[1:36:25] contained Nema
[1:36:29] if you have a problem you see me
[1:36:31] everybody okay so when people are at the
[1:36:35] edges everybody that was in that book
[1:36:38] was still
[1:36:40] everybody okay nobody know who he is but
[1:36:43] when the book is open if I bring you

[1:39:48] Bible
[1:39:49] everybody here if I look brother Charles
[1:39:52] your name is not in the Bible
[1:39:54] so what are we going to do
[1:39:59] but Academia said his name is not in the
[1:40:01] Bible so let's solve the issue when we
[1:40:04] speak name how are those names written
[1:40:10] [Music]
[1:40:12] everybody okay glory to God brother
[1:40:16] Branham says this
[1:40:18] nothing will be saved only those whose
[1:40:22] water were written on the Lamb's Book of
[1:40:25] water life when before the foundation of
[1:40:29] the world you are water gentle see
[1:40:32] that's all the book hold that water
[1:40:36] and the book is only water
[1:40:39] now now each one's name but what the
[1:40:44] mystery of the book not each one's name
[1:40:46] not your name as Kalima or Charles that
[1:40:50] is not your name but here even if your
[1:40:53] name is Abraham the book won't call you
[1:40:56] Abraham everybody okay not the name like
[1:40:59] that but what the water
[1:41:01] of the book is which is the water
[1:41:05] you finally understand that now
[1:41:08] the book does not say water
[1:41:12] is to be served in the time of these
[1:41:15] churches or water
[1:41:16] so it is now your mother's name
[1:41:21] because the name you after your end
[1:41:25] and your aunt might be a very difficult
[1:41:27] woman
[1:41:29] they give you the name of your grandpa
[1:41:31] maybe a mean person

[1:47:27] deceivableness
[1:47:28] of unrighteousness in them that do water

[1:47:56] amen
[1:48:00] when Peter disappointed him
[1:48:06] three times he died
[1:48:08] everybody okay Peter discouraged

[1:48:15] I'm gonna be saved when he appeared
[1:48:17] maybe Peter was can't avoiding his eyes
[1:48:21] good morning Master good morning because
[1:48:23] he knew what he did he said Peter I'm
[1:48:26] gonna teach you something
[1:48:29] I don't look at you the way you look in
[1:48:31] yourself
[1:48:32] that's it you don't even understand
[1:48:34] yourself
[1:48:36] before you did what I did I prayed for
[1:48:38] you
[1:48:41] everybody clear when I went to
[1:48:44] one to thinking about you when I was
[1:48:46] picking up Abraham and the other one in
[1:48:49] Paradise I was thinking about you Peter
[1:48:52] that's the reason why as soon as I
[1:48:54] resurrected I say go tell my disciple
[1:48:57] and pity I want to make sure you die
[1:49:02] everybody okay this is my test do you
[1:49:06] love me

[1:49:16] but here as long as you love me that's
[1:49:19] all
[1:49:22] let's go he said because they receive
[1:49:27] not the love of the that there might be
[1:49:31] water so for you to be safe you must
[1:49:33] receive water
[1:49:35] so how did you get saved
[1:49:39] how did you get saved what saved you
[1:49:42] yourself
[1:49:43] the Bible said it is not of yourself
[1:49:45] because you're gonna boast it is a gift
[1:49:49] of God
[1:49:50] everybody okay
[1:49:52] verse 11 he said for this cause God
[1:49:56] shall send them a strong delusion that
[1:50:00] they should believe a water alive why
[1:50:02] you don't believe lies
[1:50:05] you are not meant to believe life

[1:50:29] [Music]
[1:50:33] they want that they convince is your
[1:50:36] brain
[1:50:40] because that one was built with truth
[1:50:45] and when nothing is true that's why they
[1:50:48] brought 400 prophet and the professor
[1:50:51] and the professor and Jehoshaphat City
[1:50:53] said you don't have another one in other

[1:51:03] everybody okay when they brought Makaya
[1:51:06] and Makaya to bring that begin to
[1:51:08] prophesy I assume Jehoshaphat could not

[1:54:22] everybody okay
[1:54:23] because the bear
[1:54:25] make war with the
[1:54:27] and he destroyed the water woman
[1:54:30] but not the Beast
[1:54:32] amen
[1:54:33] everybody okay everybody okay so the
[1:54:37] woman will be destroyed and America is
[1:54:40] destroyed because America made the
[1:54:42] platform for the woman
[1:54:45] by both America is number 13. we went
[1:54:49] through that amen and the woman always
[1:54:53] sits where there is a beast
[1:54:56] everybody okay but in America the Beast
[1:55:00] that was there was not the Beast of Rome
[1:55:03] everybody okay so the Beast of America
[1:55:06] have to make an image
[1:55:11] are you following me I'm to the Beast
[1:55:16] in other words the Beast of America have
[1:55:19] to raise a platform so that the woman
[1:55:22] can come and sit
[1:55:23] brother Branham says this
[1:55:26] glory to God he says if anything if
[1:55:30] something was made in my image
[1:55:33] he had to look like water if something
[1:55:36] is made in the image of this church he
[1:55:39] had to look like water the church
[1:55:41] something was my dead Beast made an
[1:55:44] image unto this Beast so that he might
[1:55:47] have to look like water
[1:55:49] so if the woman look in America and he
[1:55:52] seen something that look exactly like
[1:55:55] the Beast guess what
[1:55:59] everybody okay because somebody already
[1:56:01] prepared a platform for her everybody
[1:56:04] okay brother Branham saying which was
[1:56:06] water
[1:56:08] methodism baptism Pentecostalism
[1:56:12] Holiness all the hymns form up into
[1:56:15] water
[1:56:16] and made an image just like ant water
[1:56:19] because the Beast himself is a mixture
[1:56:24] everybody okay so when America made the
[1:56:27] platform he opened the door and the
[1:56:30] woman look he said hey
[1:56:32] I'm sitting on the Beast the Beast is
[1:56:35] also there the woman can step in and
[1:56:38] step on the Beast now America begin to
[1:56:40] speak like a dragon
[1:56:43] everybody okay so God raised this power
[1:56:46] to come and to do what and to destroy
[1:56:49] the Beast
[1:56:50] but there is something strange about
[1:56:52] Russia
[1:56:54] brother Branham say Russia only received
[1:56:57] her place in the world in science no
[1:57:00] more than about 40 years ago
[1:57:05] everybody okay
[1:57:07] praise God you take 1964 you remove 40.
[1:57:11] you want to sit down where you're going
[1:57:13] toward the first world war you know when
[1:57:15] the first world war come on they ignore
[1:57:18] Russia
[1:57:19] it was just a bunch of water
[1:57:23] big old Siberian they burned all over
[1:57:27] the face didn't know they did all over
[1:57:30] the face and didn't know right and left
[1:57:32] that's right Russia but she recognized
[1:57:35] her place
[1:57:39] she had to do it to fulfill the
[1:57:41] scripture you know my Prophecies of what
[1:57:44] I said would happen how all of them will
[1:57:46] gather into water communism now she led
[1:57:49] the world in water science
[1:57:53] who's leading the word in science you
[1:57:56] think it's America you will be surprised
[1:57:59] we are way back behind her
[1:58:02] all the rest of the world is behind her
[1:58:05] she's lead her place she just recognized
[1:58:08] she had some brain too
[1:58:12] brother Branham continue just like
[1:58:15] Russia did when he went into water and
[1:58:18] there is where they got the atomic bomb
[1:58:22] so when the rights are invited Germany
[1:58:25] they went there and they pick up the
[1:58:27] scientists that were there
[1:58:30] all right everybody okay brother random
[1:58:32] said they got those German scientists
[1:58:34] because Italy was so strong he got the
[1:58:38] Jews working for him
[1:58:40] everybody okay that is why they are so
[1:58:44] far Advanced today
[1:58:46] they captured them and took them back up
[1:58:49] there themselves they did in heaven but
[1:58:52] they went and got those things just like
[1:58:54] Nebuchadnezzar did the water just like
[1:58:57] Nebuchadnezzar went and picked up Daniel
[1:59:00] and then you begin to work for the
[1:59:03] kingdom of Babylon the right shall also
[1:59:06] went to Germany pick up the scientists
[1:59:09] get there put them in laboratory start
[1:59:12] working for me
[1:59:15] can I continue
[1:59:17] remember there is going to be millions
[1:59:20] of America meet their Doom
[1:59:24] what would hinder tonight for this whole
[1:59:28] nation to be destroyed within five
[1:59:29] minutes
[1:59:30] what did PSY say the other night this
[1:59:33] nation Nationwide broadcast on that we
[1:59:37] are five years behind what Russia who
[1:59:40] said that
[1:59:41] America themselves they got Sputnik and
[1:59:45] they can put a man into it dozen of them
[1:59:47] send them up there in sky and move right
[1:59:50] over this United States and say
[1:59:51] surrender or go up to power in a few
[1:59:54] minutes because we will surrender to
[1:59:56] save our life
[1:59:57] you say brother Stephen this is hard
[2:00:00] I can't believe it you believe too much
[2:00:03] your media
[2:00:04] one day you will know the truth
[2:00:07] when God stopped Noah God prophesied
[2:00:11] it's gonna rain
[2:00:13] [Music]
[2:00:16] nobody believed Noah the scientists
[2:00:19] looking up over there they said there is
[2:00:22] no water over there but one day when
[2:00:26] Noah enter into the ark the water begin
[2:00:29] to fall and destroy the people
[2:00:32] you hearing one ear

[2:01:11] Rock and Roll Party there is a Sputnik
[2:01:13] flying to the sky or we thought we had
[2:01:16] it all didn't we we thought we know it
[2:01:19] all but Russia according to our own
[2:01:22] science is five years behind us
[2:01:28] I mean sorry ahead of us and we were
[2:01:31] caught up
[2:01:32] and we are caught up in five years
[2:01:35] when we are caught up in five years
[2:01:37] there shall be ten years further the
[2:01:40] other way God is living an ungodly
[2:01:43] Nation
[2:01:44] letting an ungodly people
[2:01:47] they bear not the realm that took those
[2:01:50] Jewish scientists up there in Germany
[2:01:53] and they are far ahead of us we are
[2:01:56] putting our time to wine
[2:01:58] is to casinos
[2:02:02] to women watching naked women in the
[2:02:05] nightclub and big time and they are
[2:02:08] working day and night I had to do water
[2:02:12] there is one thing that could keep them
[2:02:15] from doing it right now
[2:02:19] there is only there is not one thing
[2:02:21] that could keep them from doing it right
[2:02:23] now but why are they not doing it
[2:02:32] [Music]
[2:02:36] Eve was pregnant with Ken and apple amen
[2:02:39] come on
[2:02:41] if God destroys the pregnancy he can
[2:02:45] hurt ever
[2:02:46] he have to wait for both of them to be
[2:02:49] born
[2:02:50] and separated then God can separate can
[2:02:53] and deal with cancer separately
[2:02:58] glory to God brother Stephen where are
[2:03:01] you heading but now when but now the end
[2:03:05] of the gentle dispensation is here and
[2:03:08] Russia the communistic has a bomb
[2:03:11] pointed right towards you to end it
[2:03:14] don't worry
[2:03:16] it is coming
[2:03:17] the Bible said so it shall be there with
[2:03:21] your name wrote on it my name is not
[2:03:24] wrote on the bomb
[2:03:28] my name is wrought on the book of life
[2:03:31] amen
[2:03:32] [Music]
[2:03:34] everybody here
[2:03:37] he said that it shall go in paddle in
[2:03:41] one second time the whole nation it will
[2:03:44] be complete in higher in our lesson
[2:03:47] notice that is God doing that and no
[2:03:51] they are a liberty Monarch they are a
[2:03:53] bunch of hidden but didn't God raise up
[2:03:55] hidden Nation to straighten up Israel in
[2:03:57] the days gone by the Bible claims that
[2:04:00] Russia and communism is playing right
[2:04:02] into the hand of what God to absolutely
[2:04:05] read the Earth of water the people
[2:04:10] which people are we going into it amen
[2:04:13] this Russia brother Branham say
[2:04:17] that like Russia trying to unite
[2:04:20] everybody under one great head communism
[2:04:23] well communism is right but not forced
[2:04:28] like that
[2:04:29] management
[2:04:34] communism Russia is only a Revival of
[2:04:38] the devil
[2:04:40] [Music]
[2:04:45] like water
[2:04:47] in other words
[2:04:49] the correct the communism is the
[2:04:53] communism that happened on the day of
[2:04:55] Pentecost
[2:04:58] when the Holy Spirit come down nobody
[2:05:02] taught anybody to sell the house
[2:05:05] they are automatically saw their
[2:05:08] property and they put everything
[2:05:10] together so that's all they believe they
[2:05:12] can share but communism of Russia is not
[2:05:16] coming from the Holy Ghost
[2:05:18] it is a man-made communism a perverted
[2:05:22] communism which is enter God
[2:05:27] Abraham said Pentecost had a real
[2:05:30] communism everybody thought everything
[2:05:32] freely and divided among them and now
[2:05:35] the government is trying to make
[2:05:38] everybody in Russia Force everybody and
[2:05:41] being dominated under a head that is who
[2:05:44] Russia so Russia even though God is
[2:05:47] using him
[2:05:49] to destroy the prostitute and to destroy
[2:05:52] America God help us get rid of that
[2:05:56] spirit
[2:05:58] when it's finished and the way God
[2:06:01] destroyed Russia he destroyed Russia in
[2:06:04] conjunction in combo
[2:06:10] with the Beast together
[2:06:14] open Daniel 7.
[2:06:22] we're good in time my friend
[2:06:24] it's just the way we're riding
[2:06:27] so if you see an asteroid something you
[2:06:30] know we're not in the Earth
[2:06:32] we are somewhere in the universe
[2:06:38] plus the Milky Way and everything
[2:06:44] so we pass the cloud
[2:06:46] are you there let's go to
[2:06:50] Daniel chapter 7.
[2:06:53] you there
[2:06:56] job to verse uh seven
[2:06:59] listen now carefully
[2:07:01] Lord help me navigate this quick
[2:07:04] you there
[2:07:06] and after this I saw in the night vision
[2:07:09] and behold the four beasts you remember
[2:07:11] that Beast is the Beast of Revelation
[2:07:13] 13. everybody clear with me
[2:07:16] Daniel could not see how the beach
[2:07:18] should look like he just said it's a
[2:07:21] terrible Beast it is John that showed to
[2:07:23] us that it is the three beasts combined
[2:07:26] together because the first Beast was a
[2:07:28] lion the second a bear the third was a
[2:07:30] leopard all of them combined together
[2:07:31] which is revelation 13.
[2:07:33] after this I saw in the night vision and
[2:07:36] Beyond the forbest Dreadful and terrible
[2:07:38] we don't know how you look strong
[2:07:40] exceedingly and had great horns they're
[2:07:43] great uh eye on teeth which is iron who
[2:07:46] is the fourth Kingdom which is wrong
[2:07:48] he devoured and broken pieces and
[2:07:51] stamped the residue with the feet of it
[2:07:53] and it was diverse different from all
[2:07:56] the beasts that were before it and he
[2:07:58] had water
[2:07:59] according to Daniel this Beast this
[2:08:04] fourth Beast only have 10 horns follow
[2:08:07] me carefully
[2:08:08] according to John he have ten horns and
[2:08:12] how many heads seven heads but Daniel
[2:08:14] doesn't speak about the heads
[2:08:18] brother Branham said God give a
[2:08:19] revelation
[2:08:21] and then he add another Revelation not a
[2:08:25] new revelation but he had more
[2:08:27] information you remember the code to
[2:08:29] help you understand and receive it
[2:08:31] better everybody okay so when they just
[2:08:34] saw this Beast he saw ten horns when
[2:08:37] John Luke he saw 10 horns and seven
[2:08:40] heads we need to put these two together
[2:08:48] the problem is you don't know how to put
[2:08:50] them together
[2:08:52] and it's all over the scripture
[2:08:54] this Beast and the Beast of John is the
[2:08:57] same beast but for some reason Daniel
[2:08:59] didn't see the seven heads how are you
[2:09:01] going to put them together you need a
[2:09:03] prophet
[2:09:05] everybody okay job two verse 8 I
[2:09:08] consider the horns how many horns do we
[2:09:10] have and behold there came up among them
[2:09:15] another leader born
[2:09:17] how many horns do we have now
[2:09:21] now we have ten plus one
[2:09:24] equal eleven holes
[2:09:28] everybody okay
[2:09:29] this book is very tactical you say
[2:09:33] before whom there were three of the
[2:09:37] first one do what plugged up by the
[2:09:41] water stop
[2:09:43] follow me carefully
[2:09:45] there are ten horns
[2:09:47] there is another horn that is coming up
[2:09:51] are you following me but before the horn
[2:09:54] take place
[2:09:55] they pulled three rounds out
[2:10:00] somebody's going quickly everybody okay
[2:10:04] so before number 11 comes up everybody
[2:10:08] okay we did 10
[2:10:11] minus three equal water seven
[2:10:16] now we have a pen
[2:10:25] everybody okay everybody okay now we
[2:10:28] have a tan and a water seven so this
[2:10:32] horn when he comes is number one
[2:10:37] so quick
[2:10:39] I love this set that was so quick I
[2:10:42] thought it's gonna be complicated
[2:10:45] and in the Book of Revelation the Bible
[2:10:47] said there is seven Kings you remember
[2:10:50] that and the eighth is the Beast which
[2:10:53] is part of the seven and Daniel said
[2:10:56] there is ten horns but if you notice to
[2:11:00] replace one they're taking how many
[2:11:02] seven
[2:11:03] how many six do we have three
[2:11:07] all right
[2:11:09] do it in one
[2:11:11] this Beast is six men six men six three
[2:11:16] men in one they pull three to put him
[2:11:19] because he's a trinity
[2:11:23] everybody okay
[2:11:24] did I lose somebody if I lost you raise
[2:11:27] your hand
[2:11:31] that's how I preach here if I if I let
[2:11:34] you raise your hand
[2:11:36] somebody is a little bit shy let me help
[2:11:38] you up
[2:11:40] everybody okay
[2:11:42] there is 10 horns there is another one
[2:11:45] coming up but before this one take place
[2:11:48] they took three out in other words this
[2:11:51] one hunts take the place of three holes
[2:11:54] because that horn is a trinity of horn
[2:11:58] everybody okay he's a trinity he needs a
[2:12:02] space for three so when you take three
[2:12:04] out you remaining with seven seven plus
[2:12:08] one you get eight so this horns which is
[2:12:12] a trinity once is number eight which is
[2:12:16] a beast in Revelation
[2:12:19] everybody okay
[2:12:21] everybody okay
[2:12:23] I just did this
[2:12:25] you're not gonna fall okay so I'm back
[2:12:28] this way let's continue he says
[2:12:31] everybody okay
[2:12:33] blood that from the root and behold in
[2:12:36] this horn
[2:12:37] where what like the eyes of a water so
[2:12:41] this horn is water
[2:12:43] do you see how quick how easy the thing
[2:12:46] is
[2:12:46] follow me carefully now Daniel is saying
[2:12:50] that there is a beast
[2:12:52] everybody okay
[2:12:54] everybody okay and this Beast has a man
[2:12:57] on him
[2:13:00] can I go back to our reading this
[2:13:02] morning there is a beast everybody okay
[2:13:05] and this Beast was giving a water
[2:13:08] and a person which is a false prophet
[2:13:11] which is there everybody okay
[2:13:14] let's go back again
[2:13:16] any question
[2:13:18] let's continue and my mouth
[2:13:23] mouth
[2:13:29] do you see how Daniel and John are
[2:13:31] saying the same thing you gotta know how
[2:13:33] to navigate everybody okay and they're
[2:13:35] giving him a map remembering Revelation
[2:13:37] they give the best
[2:13:39] they give him him and mouth speaking
[2:13:41] water great things let me go back again
[2:13:44] here you remember I told you in
[2:13:46] Revelation they give him a
[2:13:47] mouth-speaking water
[2:13:49] so what are we looking at
[2:13:53] everybody okay
[2:13:55] speaking great things
[2:13:57] job to verse 11.
[2:14:01] no yes job to verse 11. yes and I beheld
[2:14:05] then because of the voice of the great
[2:14:08] word which the water because the Ron is
[2:14:11] a person
[2:14:12] I behaved even till the Beast was slain
[2:14:16] and his body destroyed and given to the
[2:14:19] burning water flame so they didn't see
[2:14:22] you don't see a woman here
[2:14:25] everybody okay the Bible said this Beast
[2:14:28] that carried the horned everybody okay
[2:14:30] this one which is a man the Beast was
[2:14:33] destroyed when they destroyed that Beast
[2:14:36] they put him where they were his flaming
[2:14:41] burning family or fire
[2:14:44] everybody okay
[2:14:45] job to verse 14 then we hurry quickly
[2:14:51] you there
[2:14:52] and there was giving him dominion and
[2:14:55] glory and the kingdom to all the people
[2:14:57] nation and language should serve him his
[2:15:01] Dominion is Everlasting Dominion which
[2:15:04] shall not pass away and his kingdom that
[2:15:06] shall not be destroyed everybody okay
[2:15:09] jump to verse uh

[2:15:13] job to verse 19 so I can go quickly
[2:15:16] and I will know that
[2:15:20] you say I want to know a little bit
[2:15:21] about this Beast
[2:15:22] the truth about the phobias which he was
[2:15:25] diverse from the other one exceeding
[2:15:27] Dreadful whose teeth were iron and he's
[2:15:29] now out of brass
[2:15:31] which devour broken pieces stamped the
[2:15:34] residue with his feet listen carefully
[2:15:36] now

[2:15:40] head and of the one which came up before
[2:15:43] whom three fell even of that horn that
[2:15:47] had eyes and a mouth that speak very
[2:15:50] great things whose look was more Stout

[2:24:17] against Jerusalem
[2:24:21] everybody okay let's go now to
[2:24:24] revelation 16.
[2:24:27] when we look at Revelation 19 we don't
[2:24:29] see Russia we see the Beast so where is
[2:24:33] Russian Armageddon Revelation 16 if you
[2:24:36] dare you can say Amen
[2:24:37] okay let's hurry verse 12 and the sixth
[2:24:41] Angel pull out this vow upon the great
[2:24:45] river Euphrates and the water thereof
[2:24:49] were dried up that the way of the king
[2:24:52] of the Earth
[2:24:56] somebody's not sleeping the way of the
[2:24:58] king of the water
[2:25:00] if you notice
[2:25:02] the Euphrates the Euphrates is opening
[2:25:06] the way to the king of the East not the
[2:25:09] king of the Earth
[2:25:14] scripture don't play with word can I
[2:25:17] erase this
[2:25:18] can I erase this now we found out that
[2:25:22] the Euphrates the Beast
[2:25:25] the Beast uses the Beast uses the Kings
[2:25:30] of the Earth
[2:25:32] that is not clear
[2:25:34] everybody okay but one day you Freight
[2:25:37] is dried up
[2:25:38] amen he opened the way to the Kings
[2:25:43] off the east
[2:25:47] everybody okay so we got two group here
[2:25:51] I'm going slowly we got the Eastern King
[2:25:57] everybody clear and another group that
[2:26:00] work with the Beast
[2:26:03] this both of them are attacking together
[2:26:05] and they are attacking the lamb and his
[2:26:09] brother
[2:26:09] we okay
[2:26:11] now when we say the king of the East
[2:26:13] what do we mean
[2:26:15] brother Branham says this
[2:26:18] before I go forward let me clarify this
[2:26:22] there is a battle called The Battle of
[2:26:24] go get Magog
[2:26:26] in Revelation 20. that battle we saw
[2:26:29] that it happened after the millennium
[2:26:32] and the Prisoner there is the devil they
[2:26:35] take the devil and put him in the flake
[2:26:38] of fire where the Beast and the false
[2:26:40] prophet are but the name of that battle
[2:26:42] is called Gog and Magog in Revelation I
[2:26:47] want you to clarify that everybody okay
[2:26:49] now the king of the East brother Branham
[2:26:52] say we found out that the angel poured
[2:26:55] out his vowel upon the Euphrates even
[2:26:56] and he dried up and the King of the
[2:27:00] North might come down and I think what
[2:27:03] that will actually be will be at the end
[2:27:06] time when they come into water and they
[2:27:09] have to come right through water and get
[2:27:12] into it right down through them
[2:27:13] countries they shall have to cross the
[2:27:16] Euphrates to get in there
[2:27:18] brother Branham say see making way for
[2:27:21] the king of the noise to come down there
[2:27:24] Kings so brother Brown I'm saying the
[2:27:27] king of the East God Russia in
[2:27:30] plus other kings
[2:27:34] why is China teaming up with Russia
[2:27:38] everybody okay
[2:27:39] the king of the East
[2:27:41] everybody okay brother Branham said they
[2:27:44] shall die shall be take place during the
[2:27:47] time of the battle of water Armageddon
[2:27:50] now we found out that when the Euphrates
[2:27:52] is drying up
[2:27:54] amen he opened the way to the king of
[2:27:58] the East
[2:28:03] the Bible says this
[2:28:05] that when the Great river Euphrates when
[2:28:09] the poor Deva they were the thereof did
[2:28:12] water what is water in the Bible
[2:28:16] let's go slowly now
[2:28:18] what is water in the Bible
[2:28:21] tongues and Nation
[2:28:23] everybody okay
[2:28:26] so if you are waiting
[2:28:29] for one day maybe it might happen
[2:28:30] naturally that the Euphrates will dry
[2:28:33] completely and open the way and then you
[2:28:36] begin to see the king begin to March
[2:28:38] good luck
[2:28:40] because Revelation is the book of
[2:28:43] symbols
[2:28:44] everybody okay Wonder in the scripture
[2:28:47] represent what people and when they pour
[2:28:50] the vowel on Euphrates the people dried
[2:28:53] up what is Euphrates
[2:29:00] William Marion brother
[2:29:02] Branham speaking about the sixth trumpet
[2:29:04] he says it was spiritual horses
[2:29:08] spiritual devils
[2:29:10] charges that had been bound in water
[2:29:14] all these years Supernatural water these
[2:29:18] are the Devils that were killing people
[2:29:19] here through Hitler and Mussolini and
[2:29:21] the other one everybody okay brother
[2:29:24] Brian I'm saying why was it
[2:29:27] the old Roman water empire being what
[2:29:31] revived the persecution of water there
[2:29:36] has been bound for nearly two thousand
[2:29:38] years at the river water can't cross to
[2:29:42] the water
[2:29:43] a religious water
[2:29:48] so Euphrates this is not the river you
[2:29:50] think there
[2:29:51] it is a church
[2:29:54] everybody okay and that was trying to
[2:29:57] get to the other side you freighted you
[2:30:00] know they come through Eden but they
[2:30:02] were born there 2 200 000 devil of water
[2:30:05] persecution brother Branham says that
[2:30:08] the euphrate this river is the Catholic
[2:30:10] Church
[2:30:12] I know
[2:30:13] everybody okay but when the poor deviled
[2:30:17] on the Catholic Church the Catholic
[2:30:20] Church began to lose people
[2:30:25] you're following me
[2:30:27] to make way for the king of the north
[2:30:30] Russia to move in where did the Catholic
[2:30:33] people lost to people
[2:30:36] brother Branham says this
[2:30:38] but the churches themselves has become
[2:30:41] rich pretty near the wealth of the world
[2:30:44] says the Bible lays in the Water
[2:30:46] Catholic Church that is why Russia run
[2:30:49] her out
[2:30:52] sure did yes right that's exactly why
[2:30:55] Russia excommunicated that is why what
[2:30:59] that was the very grassroot of water
[2:31:02] because the church thought to be
[2:31:05] something there was no more from the
[2:31:07] rest of the water so what happened is
[2:31:10] the Catholic Church grew in Russia
[2:31:13] everybody okay and something happened to
[2:31:16] the Catholic church in Russia
[2:31:19] and for some reason they ran them out
[2:31:22] the water of Euphrates begin to dry it
[2:31:26] out
[2:31:27] everybody okay when the Catholic Church
[2:31:30] left Russia the communism begin to rise
[2:31:34] in Russia that was the King of the North
[2:31:37] now rising up and taking the whole
[2:31:39] nation of Russia under control because
[2:31:42] they pushed the Beast out everybody okay
[2:31:46] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:31:49] the king of the earth and of the East
[2:31:52] drop down to verse 13. and I saw three

[2:32:45] situate you in Prophecy the three
[2:32:47] unclean spirit that you Freight is dried

[2:32:53] it's The Vow that dried the Euphrates
[2:32:56] River making way for the king of the

[2:33:41] water the Battle of that great day of
[2:33:45] God water Almighty
[2:33:47] so the tree unclean spirits are going
[2:33:51] recruiting
[2:33:56] the army of the Beast because the tree
[2:34:01] unclean Spirit comes from the Beast from
[2:34:03] the first prophet and from the dragon
[2:34:06] amen so they are recruiting the Army for
[2:34:10] the Beast
[2:34:11] and the king of the East are working
[2:34:14] with Russia
[2:34:18] everybody okay because it's Russia and

[2:34:28] bodies the Beast also have to pack his
[2:34:32] body
[2:34:33] everybody okay but in order for the
[2:34:35] Beast to recruit his people the Beast
[2:34:40] must open a new Trinity
[2:34:48] in order for God to recruit his people
[2:34:52] God have to open a new oil

[2:35:14] brother Branham says this
[2:35:16] he says notice the three unclean spirits
[2:35:19] come out of the mouth of the Beast do
[2:35:21] you know that the unclean Spirit like
[2:35:23] frogs did you ever notice how a frog
[2:35:26] looks a frog is always looking what
[2:35:29] backwards he never look water forward
[2:35:32] looking water back always back look bad
[2:35:36] but the four beasts that have the four
[2:35:38] different heads in Ezekiel yeah the four
[2:35:40] creature when they're moving they always
[2:35:42] go out forward
[2:35:48] what are you trying to say about Stephen
[2:35:49] brother Branham saying notice it's three
[2:35:52] unclean Spirit he said Trinity of spirit
[2:35:54] a trinity of frog a frog is an animal
[2:35:59] that always look backwards he never
[2:36:02] looks where he's going he looks where he
[2:36:04] comes from
[2:36:07] I'm going slowly
[2:36:09] the second Trinity and the second all
[2:36:13] the second Trinity the new Trinity that
[2:36:17] comes does also two things
[2:36:25] the second oil does two things
[2:36:28] number one is that's water
[2:36:32] [Music]
[2:36:34] oh wow
[2:36:35] are you okay are we okay are we okay
[2:36:38] they are turning you away
[2:36:41] and then they do what they open the
[2:36:44] seventh seal to do water
[2:36:47] recruitment the new Trinity also when he
[2:36:51] opened he have to look first way
[2:36:56] [Music]
[2:37:01] we have the devil answer
[2:37:04] everybody okay and then he looks back
[2:37:07] it's also returning the people back
[2:37:11] just like Malachi 4 is returning
[2:37:14] everybody okay don't you see where was
[2:37:17] Trinity uh where was uh trinitarianism
[2:37:20] Bonnet remember these three unclean
[2:37:22] Spirit individual spirit let me Rush
[2:37:25] quickly so we can go they look back to
[2:37:28] the nursing Council where the Trinity
[2:37:31] Doctrine was born
[2:37:32] there is no such a thing they look back
[2:37:36] to the nursing Council in Asia Rome
[2:37:38] where the Trinity were born we also look
[2:37:41] back to Pentecost where the church was
[2:37:43] born and the Trinity of frog came out of
[2:37:47] the earth Trinity giving birth to a
[2:37:49] water you Trinity the mother amen he
[2:37:53] said there was there when
[2:37:57] all the time
[2:37:59] but he was not manifested until between
[2:38:03] the six and the water just before the
[2:38:06] water seals opened
[2:38:08] everybody okay the second oil was there
[2:38:12] all the time but that whole could not be
[2:38:15] unfolded because God knew what the devil
[2:38:18] would do at the end so God preserved
[2:38:20] that all until at the certain time when
[2:38:23] the devil opened up God also open up
[2:38:27] that's why brother Branham said that
[2:38:29] when hell poor Down Heaven also poured
[2:38:32] down
[2:38:33] [Music]
[2:38:35] is coming up to return the heart
[2:38:39] back to the origin and to open the
[2:38:41] thunder so that he can read the name and
[2:38:44] recruit the Army the other one is coming
[2:38:46] back also recruiting his children
[2:38:48] bringing them back where they came from
[2:38:51] to go back to their mother and also
[2:38:53] preparing the king of the earth to go
[2:38:56] into the battle while the Thunder are
[2:38:59] preparing the king of Heaven
[2:39:01] to God so in the battle
[2:39:05] everybody okay
[2:39:07] glory to God Lord help me see if I can
[2:39:10] skip some of them
[2:39:12] come on man

[3:00:20] water Eagle time what timer
[3:00:22] the word of God made water the word of
[3:00:26] God being water oh children walk in
[3:00:29] water
[3:00:30] it's a specific baptism it is the second
[3:00:35] oil amen walk in this baptism of the
[3:00:38] Holy Spirit come in and believe it we
[3:00:41] found your heart God will do what I feel
[3:00:43] you where are you going brother Stephen
[3:00:45] he says father today we stand here by
[3:00:48] your grace it is not because we say
[3:00:50] special people but it's because just
[3:00:52] like in the day of the lion the day of
[3:00:55] the water and the day of water but it's
[3:00:57] in one time ego time it is the anointing
[3:01:00] of the water it is the time that we are
[3:01:03] living in it is working of the Holy
[3:01:06] Spirit the waking up the holy spirit for
[3:01:08] this water particular time to prove that
[3:01:10] Jesus Is Not What Not Dead the things
[3:01:13] that he said that he would do just
[3:01:16] before the evening light went out and
[3:01:18] here we are seeing him do it right now
[3:01:21] along the water Rose what are you trying
[3:01:23] to say brother Stephen Amen in
[3:01:26] Deuteronomy 32.
[3:01:28] the Bible says as the ego does water
[3:01:32] stirs are pronounced amen
[3:01:36] spread that water
[3:01:38] and take of them bear them on the water
[3:01:41] so the eagle when he comes to his
[3:01:45] children he does three things
[3:01:48] everybody here when the children are so
[3:01:51] comfortable
[3:01:53] the guy used to touch it
[3:01:55] the guy used to clicks the eagle
[3:01:58] anointing when he comes he will rock the
[3:02:01] boat amen
[3:02:04] hey everybody here and then he worked
[3:02:06] the eagle up and what he does he uses
[3:02:10] his wings to flatter
[3:02:16] he takes a big wind
[3:02:18] [Music]
[3:02:20] and blow into the nest and the reason
[3:02:24] why it's blowing brother Branham said
[3:02:26] it's to take the loose feather out
[3:02:30] everybody here so when you going through
[3:02:33] a ladder blowing another trial a lot of
[3:02:38] difficulty don't worry the Eagle wings
[3:02:41] are just removing your crybaby feather
[3:02:48] everybody here something happened you
[3:02:51] cry something happened you cry something
[3:02:54] happened oh my God they don't love me
[3:02:56] they don't love me God will stand a
[3:02:59] strong wind
[3:03:00] to remove the crybaby stuff then lose
[3:03:04] feather so that you can be strong
[3:03:07] [Applause]
[3:03:08] because he's preparing you for a bad
[3:03:11] alarm coming back everybody here when he
[3:03:15] finished preparing you he spread his
[3:03:17] wings what is he doing with his wings
[3:03:20] brother Branham says this
[3:03:23] the Bible says this that when the Dragon
[3:03:27] so that he was cast onto the Earth he
[3:03:31] persecuted the water which brought forth
[3:03:34] the water and to the woman
[3:03:39] everybody okay
[3:03:40] was giving water of a water what do you
[3:03:45] do with two wings
[3:03:48] everybody okay what do you do with two
[3:03:50] wings to run from the Dragon

[3:04:52] anointing it must be a water ego Amigo

[3:14:47] Father once again thanking you for your
[3:14:49] grace
[3:14:50] for your love and your mercy and for
[3:14:53] everything you have been doing for us
[3:14:54] father thank you for the safety that is
[3:14:58] in this message that now we understand
[3:15:00] that we don't have to be troubled
[3:15:02] nothing will happen as long as we hear
[3:15:06] we have to leave this earth
[3:15:09] than the war and whatever need to be
[3:15:11] started even the tribulation can never
[3:15:15] set as long as we are in this world
[3:15:18] father that's why you send the wings of
[3:15:20] the ego so that we can be packed and be
[3:15:24] removed and the dragon will make war to
[3:15:27] the remnant of the seed of the woman
[3:15:29] which is the foolish virgin
[3:15:32] but Lord father it's only for a time
[3:15:35] until Moses and Elijah finish the
[3:15:37] ministry
[3:15:38] then father we will come back with you
[3:15:40] again
[3:15:41] now to meet both the bear and the peace
[3:15:45] together in the battle of Armageddon to
[3:15:48] settle the deal father thank you for
[3:15:50] opening this and if anybody doesn't have
[3:15:54] their life line up
[3:15:55] so that they are in this Tabernacle
[3:15:58] in this holiest time connected with this
[3:16:01] oil that they know for sure that all it

[3:16:37] of the things
[3:16:38] but it won't happen Armageddon won't
[3:16:41] start because Moses and Elijah are not
