somebody put a question but no name so I don't know who put it I can only read it but if you put a question about the attraction I'm just going to give you a portion so you know who you are whether you at home or here if you say something about attraction place if you put that question just send me a message directly to my phone I just want to get some clarification so it's important what you ask is very important but I just want to get more clarification so I make sure I don't think it's a question and answer question it's for the couples meeting the way it's written so please send me a message directly and give me some explanation so I know exactly when I'm answering how to answer you appropriately because I was coming to church in my driving and suddenly I begin to just think about it and the Holy Spirit opened up a scripture to me it was it's a common scripture it's unbelievable how it's connected to mered couple it's unbelievable so and then when I read this question it's connecting again to the same thing so whoever put the question about what is the role attraction play or something just go ahead and send me a message and give me a little bit of detail so I can gather your thought correctly and then answer it accordingly but it's an important question so I know you didn't put your name but now you got to show up yourself to your pastor and he stays between you and your pastor and let me get I already tell you put a question I would have known but it's going to stay between you and your pastor tell me what it is so I can go ahead and deal with it amen

John chapter 10 the Lord laid something on my heart and and honestly if I'm being honest and try and just be as honest as I can I tried to get away from it and and I just you know I had something else I I wanted to preach if that makes sense you know and and the Lord said no go this way go this way and I finally said you know what I I I've crawled up under that rock before by not listening to the Lord and I ain't going to do that again so we're just trying to follow leadership of the Lord tonight and we pray that it'll be a blessing tonight but we're going to we're going to take a text tonight on I am the Good Shepherd amen I am the Good Shepherd thank you St John 10 starting with verse one people are laughing like they know something I don't we'll see amen say says here verily verily I say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the Sheep F but climbeth up some other way the same as a thief and a robber but he that entereth in by the door is The Shepherd of the sheep that's right to him that Porter openeth and the Sheep he he his voice and he calleth his own Sheep by name amen and leadth them out and when he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers that's right this Parable Jesus this Parable spake Jesus unto them but they understood not what things they were which he spoke unto them then Jesus said unto them again verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the sheep all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the Sheep did not hear them I am the door by me if any man Enter he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture the thief cometh not but for to steal and kill and to destroy and I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more of abundantly I am the Good Shepherd yes sir the Good Shepherd giveth his life for the Sheep am but he that is a hirling and not a Shepherd whose own the Sheep are not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleeth and the Wolf catcheth them and scattereth the Sheep the hirling fleeth because he is in hirling and careth not for the Sheep he said but I am the Good Shepherd and I know my sheep and am known of mine as the father knoweth me even so know I the father and I Lay My Life down I lay down my life for the sheep and other sheep I have you better be thankful for this and other sheep I have which are not of this fold that's the Gentiles amen them also I must bring and they shall hear my voice I want you to notice there it's not a if it's not a maybe they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd therefore if doeth my father love me because I lay down my life that I may take it again no man taketh it from me but I lay it down myself I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again this commandment have I received of my father there was a division there again among the Jews of these sayings and many of them said he hath a devil and is mad why hear ye him see but they couldn't help but hear him cuz they were his Sheep amen others said these are not the words of him that have a devil can a devil Open the Eyes of the Blind and it was at Jerusalem the Feast of the dedication it and it was Winter and Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch then came the Jews around about him and said unto him how long to thou make us to doubt if thou be the Christ tell us plainly Jesus answer to them I told you and you believe not the works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me but ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand I am my father are one amen amen let us talk to the author of the word Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you for this day Lord and all that you've done for us Lord God father you see Lord the little thought that you've put on my heart father and God Lord when I stepped up here Lord I realize Lord how insufficient I Am Lord I Ste up here father and I begin to say Lord there is no way that I could help these people but Lord we know the Good Shepherd father Lord we know the Good Shepherd Lord and they're not here to hear my voice but they're here to hear your voice father and Lord we believe you have a five-fold Ministry that you can speak through tonight almighty God and Lord we know you have Lord you have some sheep you have some Lambs Lord that are ready to hear your voice almighty God so Lord we're asking you tonight Lord take over this service Lord but don't just take take over the preacher almighty God but take over the congregation Lord be the one Among Us father God be the welcome one in this place Lord we pray that tonight almighty God it wouldn't just be a regular service father but but Lord I we could have what we expect Lord and I expect you to do great things tonight Lord Lord I don't understand why you went this way but God I know the Good Shepherd knows why and father I pray that tonight Lord Lord you would set at Liberty Lord those that are captive and bound almighty God lord lord and you would heal Lord the broken hearted almighty God lord encourage and discourage tonight father Lord do whatever you want to do father Lord we're just your sheep tonight father we just want to hear what you want to say tonight father Lord and at the end of the service when the last amen is said father we're not going to lift up any man outside of the man Christ Jesus tonight Lord father we pray that you would have your will and way in this service Lord touch each and every heart father for such a time as this Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may have your seats tonight amen you as I said the Lord was dealing on me I am the Good Shepherd you know I've never preached on the shepherd and what a Shepherd is and different things but but it just came to my heart and and I begin to look into it and you know we'll just we'll just go through here it might be kind of simple tonight but I believe it's just simply good because it's the word of God Amen but what is a Shepherd in the Bible a Shepherd is a person that tends to feeds and protect sheep and you know a Shepherd knows his sheep there's no end of what a Shepherd will do to protect his sheep if he's a good shepherd there's nothing that he won't do to be able to try to take care of those sheep and and you know he'll even lay his very life down for those sheep and and you know he is faithful to the sheep and and we look back in the Bible and I think when we think of a Shepherd probably the first person that we think of is King David in the Bible because before he was ever a king he was first a Shepherd amen and he knew what it was like to take care of the father's sheep and and we find in first Samuel that that you know but I thought it was so amazing that that that David thought so much of being a Shepherd that that even when the king came to or when when when when Samuel came to pick out a King David couldn't make it to the meeting because David was too busy taking care of the father's sheep that was that was his whole life was to take care of the father's sheep come what made he was going to take care of those sheep we find in 1 Samuel when when he would go to the battle when he would see Goliath and and not trying to dwell on that as much but what David said here is powerful and he said David son said unto Saul thy servant kept his father sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock now I want you to notice that how powerful this is because it wasn't multiple Lambs but it was one lamb that compelled David it wasn't multiple Lambs but just one lamb was too many for the enemy to come in and take that lamb amen thank you Lord and a bear and it took a lamb out of the flock not the multiple ones but the heart of the shepherd one is too many one is too many in the heart of the shepherd and he said and I went out after him and and I smoted him and delivered it out of the mouth and when he arose against me I caught him by his beard and smote him I love that because he not only set the little lamb free he not only set the captive free but he killed the Lamb's Enemy at the time [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah and my servant slew both The Lion and the bear we know that a pastor is considered a Shepherd of the flock and and you have a wonderful Pastor you know a real pastor and a real Shepherd of the flock you know if he's a good shepherd he's always watching The Flock he's always trying to notice things he's always trying to to look and for the benefit of you it's not for the benefit of himself but it's because he cares for the Sheep you know he he will begin to notice when you're not your normal self he'll be you know what I'm talking about you're sitting there in church and you're going I hope he don't look at me I hope he don't look at me because he knows that he'll know that something ain't right he'll know that I'm used to Jumping Up and praising God and today I'm a little bit cold and I'm sitting right here but that Shepherd will begin to discern that out and you know he he'll be looking for that you know when you're missing when you're missing from church he'll begin to notice he'll begin to look and he'll begin to say you know there's something not right here he's not here and you know and you know what else he'll do he'll make sure he'll make sure he'll take his time and he'll study to make sure the Lambs are feeding on the right things he'll make sure you're not just feeding on garbage or anything that'll make you sick but he's a real Shepherd he's constantly at the door making sure no evil spirit will get in that's you know a lot of times and I'm going to say this here for your benefit there's a lot of times that a spirit will try to rise up on you because your pastor will try to bring something out of the church and you'll begin to say oh he's just being mean no it's because he cares for you it's because he's sitting there at the door and when he sees something come in the church that ain't supposed to be there he's a good [Applause] shepherd but you know if something does happen to you uh-huh and you find yourself out there you know what a good shepherd does he comes looking for you that's right he'll call you over and over again and you'll let that phone ring but that Shepherd will continue to call he'll be continue to text are you okay what's because you know why he's a shepherd He will do everything yes sir that he can to help you but you know what there wouldn't be no need for a Shepherd if there weren't sheep there wouldn't be no need for a Shepherd if there weren't [Applause] sheep you know why there's a Shepherd cuz sheep need [Music] one brother BR says we learned a lot of thing about sheep if we would just notice them and watch their actions and a sheep is a sacrificial animal little innocent fellow that don't mean you got I'm not even trying to go this way but it just keeps coming up that don't mean you have to argue with your pastor over every little thing that he does he's a Shepherd that's free that's free brother St and sheep is a sacrificial animal little innocent fellow and he's totally helpless when he's lost that's right and I think that's why Jesus likened us unto sheep because they just can't seem to find their way around they have to depend on someone leading them listen I don't know if you know this but before you were born again you tried to lead yourself and and you tried to do different things and even even after you've got born again there was times when you tried to lead yourself and you said God I know you said to go this way but but I think it'll be better if I just go this way and before you know it you're a little lost sheep because sheep need someone to lead them yes sir they have to depend on someone leading them and they cannot lead one another you know when I thought of that I thought of that story in the Bible and that that that was told there when when Ahab wanted to go up and take the land and he began to say I've got 400 prophets you see how they tried to the Sheep of Israel tried to lead themselves and they were trying to find their own way and then Jehoshaphat said well is't there just one more isn't there just one more and they went to Micah and you know what Micah said he said I won't say nothing save what the shepherd says if I can word it that way he said I'm not going to say nothing but what what what the Lord God says and they begin to say well if you do it this way you you know you'll get you'll get a better position in church and you'll you you you'll flourish and different things but he said no I'm only going to say what the Lord thy God says and he came out and he gave him the word of the Lord and he said go on up go if you want to go in your own way going on up but I seen Israel scattered like sheep without a Shepherd you can't lead yourself if you try to lead yourself or let man lead you you're going to fall and fail they just won't do it and that goes to show me one thing if we are likened to sheep in God's Heritage then we cannot lead one another we are helpless and we've got to depend on the great Shepherd don't look for a great ministry don't look to follow another brother listen a brother can fall but the shepherd can never [Applause] fall hear his voice that's right you know you can go ahead I say like my if you want to follow your own voice go ahead but don't be surprised when you're scattered if you want to follow your own ideas go ahead but don't be surprised when it leads you to destruction but you need a Shepherd but if you listen to the shepherd the shepherd will never lead you astray am scripture says he goeth before them and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice oh church I I watched a little video before I came and and there was a shepherd and this Shepherd begin to step out and and and and there was a whole a whole herd of sheep there and they brought different people up and and I don't know what language it was but he was telling to call the Sheep call the sheep and somebody that wasn't a Shepherd be to step up and it be to call under the sheep and that and that person began to say in so many words come here sheep come here and the Sheep didn't even raise their head and then they let another person come out and say well call the sheep and the person began to call the sheep and and you know the Sheep never even moved they didn't even act like they heard anything then the next person walked out and it began to say something and it might have been the right words but it wasn't the way the master said it they know the master's voice and a stranger they would not follow but when the Fourth Man stepped out he began to say come here sheep and when he said that they went you know why because the fourth man was The Shepherd of the flock and when they heard the shepherd's voice they begin to rise up and one of them begin to look at the other one and was like that's was the Shepherd that was the shepherd and the next one look at the other one and they begin to go ba b b and they begin to bleat and they begin to cry and they begin to run to the shepherd because they knew the voice of the shepherd and a stranger they would not follow you know that you you know let me just tell you something powerful tonight you are so blessed to be able to hear this message you are so blessed because you know what you can't take a pig and turn him into a sheep you can take him and you can try to paint him up brother brandham said you can try to take a dog and make it look as much like a sheep but you know the life that was in that was never a sheep but if you're a sheep tonight you're an elected called out person for a purpose you always were a sheep you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep that is impossible for every kind of Life produces the same kind and there's no change in species as we were in the thought of God then expressed in flesh we had to come a day when we would hear his voice the word and hearing that voice become aware that the father was calling us and recognize that we were the sons of God think about a shepherd He will not lose a sheep now another thing you notice about sheep and the shepherd you know it's a disgrace for the shepherd to lose one sheep did you know that it's a reproach on the shepherd now I'm going now hold wide now oh my yes sir if the shepherd loses one sheep it's a disgrace on him all the father has given me will come and none's L oh see that all that comes to me all right the shepherd can't afford I'm going to say this Jesus has twoo much in you to lose you he's done too much for you to lose you and none's law all the father gives me will come in none's Lost see that all that comes to me all right the shepherd can't afford to lose the Sheep that's the reason you backslider tonight he's still hanging around your heart trying to draw you back to the f because once he's kissed you and you kissed him and told him that you loved him and raised your hands and praised him and you backslid and went out there and got all butchered up and wounded up in your spirit but he still holds around you all the time you see your condition doesn't change the shepherd your condition doesn't change how the shepherd thinks about you come back wondering sheep I just can't afford to let you be lost maybe the little sheep that he had to go away on that mountain to find all through the place maybe you're that sheep tonight laying out there wounded somewhere but the shepherd can't afford to lose one sheep Hallelujah let me just say tonight all the times that you thought you didn't give up it was never you that didn't give up it was the Shepherd that wouldn't give up on you all that the father hath given me will come to me Satan can't pluck you out of his [Applause] hand the shepherd knows your name he knows everything about you can I say this the shepherd knows more about you than you know about [Applause] [Music] [Applause] yourself oh what a shepherd He is he had he gives account for every sheep every hour of the day no matter where you're at he knows where you're at glory to God you know sometimes I think we make God a little bit too distant sometimes I think we get put God so far but let me tell you even right now tonight God is the shepherd He knows everything about you he knows everything that you're going through he knew about it before you got there because he's the door he's laying there no matter where you're at he gives you he knows where you're at he knows all about you the reason he can stand here at the platform through yielded people and reveal and tell and talk he knows he knows where you was at a year ago he knows where you're at all the time he has to give an account for his sheep ever and especially they're all renumbered again after they're gathered into the fold I thought what a beautiful picture Gathering them into the fold and numbering them listen I want you to realize that that same God let's Oh Glory to God when when the when when the son of man was revealing himself again in this day you know what he did he revealed I'm still that Shepherd he came out I love that and I came remember the story but I know brother Billy Paul told a testimony where where a man was watching and and he began to watch that discernment going on and it said you're such and such from so and so and I heard that that was exactly right and they said you're such and such from so and so with this problem and he said that was exactly right but then a little sister walked up and he to say you live at 102 Elm Street or something like that and he said oh he missed it there I missed it what said he said he missed it there because I know she lives down here at a such and such place and they begin to go out and that woman got healed and rejoice and they came out and he said I was I he said I was so discouraged because I I just want to say it this way I was so discouraged because I thought the shepherd got it wrong I thought the shepherd didn't know where one of his sheep were I thought the shepherd had it all figured out and the shepherd knew every hair on their head but the shepherd got this one wrong Hallelujah and you know what even the Sheep got it wrong and everyone else in the congregation got it wrong but the shepherd never gets it wrong because he walked out there and he heard him talking to some other sisters and said sister he he he he he said you live you live at 102 Elm Street we know you live over here and oh I forgot to tell you I'm moved you see the shepherd will never lose his own he will never forget his own and what others may not know about you almighty God [Applause] [Music] does the shepherd will do whatever it takes he will do whatever it takes to get to one of his sheep you know there was a little story in the Bible Oh Glory to God in St John 5 there was a little woman there was a little woman at a wh and and Jesus began to begin to look at the disciples and said I have needs to go by Samaria why do he have needs cuz there was a lamb down there there was a little lost lamb down there and they they begin to say Lord don't go down there don't go down there in that field don't go down to that place but you see one lamb is too much I will not lose a one he said I have needs to go back by Samaria Peter didn't want to go by Samaria John didn't want to go by Sam they you know Israel would make a point to try to go around Samaria they would add time in the day to try to go around Samaria but the Good Shepherd said I got to get to one of my [Applause] sheep the shepherd don't care how the mountain is how low the valley is you let me tell you something tonight the shepherd don't even care if he has to make a fool of himself to get to you he don't care what people think about him to get to you so why are you caring what people think about you I have needs I have needs you think you're all alone but God never left you alone he'll go out of his way to get to you leave her there [Applause] Lord I'm just going to say it I hope it's all right we got all these self-righteous message Believers that think they're better than the next one but let me tell you something there ain't none good but God there ain't no way to be perfect but under his blood you ain't no better than the person beside of you it's my one sacrifice that we are perfected oh Lord don't go down there in that field that person done sin too much who are you to talk like that you ain't the shepherd he's the shepherd oh I'm going to kill that I'm going to kill that Spirit right now if the Lord Jesus took time to be the shepherd and save you who are we who are we to say who can and can't be saved you better get that line spirit that Lon devil and cast it out [Applause] we ain't the shepherd we're the [Applause] Sheep too many people try to take the place of the shepherd I'm just going to preach they try to take preaching out of the pool pits they try to take Shepherds out of the pool pits and draw men under themselves [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] somehow brother I hope this is all right somehow you get this idea because God showed you the message of the hour you got a right to walk around and look down on every other person look down on every other person in the world I'm a special class of people yeah you might be but that's my grace I don't know where this is coming from [Music] [Applause] [Music] Brother see a brother fall see a brother fall and the first thing you do is want to kick him down [Music] further where's the spirit of Christ where's Moses that stood in the gap where's the spirit of Christ at in the [Applause] church when the spirit of the shepherd will come upon a Believer and say I'm going after my Fallen brother no matter what I'm going to get him and redeem him back where's that love went oh God I don't even know where I'm here I don't know why I'm here but listen to me you better find that love go back to your first wordss get the joy of your salvation back when it wasn't about going to church to entertain the pastor or the person beside you but it was about entertaining Jesus Christ when it was your full objective and motive to serve Jesus Christ when you could hear his voice when his voice spoke to you and it said don't do something you didn't do it hallu and when it told you to do something you did it [Applause] the shepherd's calling tonight that ain't me I wasn't going to say that I don't ever say things like that unless the Lord says [Applause] saying where did it go where did it go you know where it is where we left it you know where that love is that you once had to serve God with all your heart and with all your might you know where it is right where you left it you know one thing I've learned in my life you don't really realize something's missing till you go looking for it you know I know I know I have a certain gun a muzzle loer that I'll have in a case somewhere put up and I need that for deer season I go oh I I I know I got it and I'll begin to go look for it and I thought I put it in my basement but I put it in the top of my cloth but see I thought it was I thought it was right there in the safe but it was in the top of my closet but I didn't realize it was missing till I went and looked for it and there'll be something in a service that comes up and you'll begin to go you know I used to worship over that I used to praise God over that you know when those things came up in my life that thing didn't used to bother me but now it bothers me why because you lost it because you started looking at other things you know what it was you started listening to other voices outside of the shepherd brother I'm a million miles off from my notes I don't even know I don't even know how to get [Applause] back it's not that we lost our salvation but I think sometimes we lose the joy of it that's it [Applause] let's just try to continue on you see church when a sermon is going forth and the word of God's speaking it's not you searching for God it's God searching for you this evening this evening you said I'm going to go to church when the whole time it was God calling you to church [Applause] you would you wouldn't have made it you wouldn't have lasted had it not been for the [Music] shepherd then after he gets them all numbered and they're beded down the shepherd goes down by this hole where the Sheep come in and lays yes sir himself down across the hole right then no wolf can come in uh-huh no Thief can come in no harm can come in unless it comes over the shepherd first what a picture of Christ laying himself down for us that nothing can harm us unless it comes over him that's right so if you're sick and you say brother brandom sickness crossed over him but it was for the glory of God that's right he wants to maybe give you a testimony as the fellow said one time he seen a shepherd and it's was packing a sheep and he said well it had its leg all band Ed up and he said well what did you do what's the matter did it fall off a cliff he said no I broke its leg I tell you church sometimes we need God just to break our leg oh he said you must be a cruel Shepherd to break your own sheep's leg said no the Sheep wouldn't mind me so I had to break her leg in order in order to hold her pet her love her give her a little special food so that she would love me and follow me and so sometimes God has to do that let the doctor say oh it's all over nothing could be done and then God takes you up in his arms and Pat you a little bit says child of mine don't you know I love you don't you know I'm the Lord that Health all thy disease but Lord I was taught that the days of Miracles has passed he said I know you was but I just had this happen so I could show you a little special favor now don't you love me just a little more now am I'm going to let you get well did you ever have that just come to you I have many times let something happen just to check me down a little to let him Express his love don't be mad when a preacher gets up here pulls the rug out up from under you but let me tell you something we know that all things work to the good of them that love God you see you might be going through the hardest trial of your life but I'm here to encourage you tonight the shepherd isn't left you alone the shepherd hasn't left you in a place where he can't get to you because all things that you're going through are working for the good of you if you love God I think of the disciples on the boat brother brandom tells that story the winds were blowing the waves were you ever felt that way before the winds were blowing the waves were beating in the ship and they thought they were alone but brother brandham said Jesus climbed up on a high mountain he climbed up on a high mountain just to look down on the sheep and make sure the Sheep were okay to make sure his disciples were okay and you know and you you feel like I know how it feels you feel like there's so much pressure on you but don't worry he won't let you drown he won't let you fall there he will come walking on the water see there so many times that we'll try to figure out God and how God's going to take care of a situation and we wonder if he's going to if he's going to do this but we don't take for a count God can do whatever he wants to for a situation God don't need our approval or our opinion but he can actually come walking on the water to meet you in your [Applause] situation the storm the master was on the mountain the whole time watching them so many times it feels like our life is in turmoil it feels like we don't know what to do but I promise you this the shepherd said he will not lose a one and you feel like you're so alone and and you go God does anybody care about me but let me tell you one thing about the shepherd the shepherd is the kind of Shepherd that'll leave the 99 to find the one that's our God you say well God I feel so forgotten sometimes but listen you might be forgotten by your brother you might be forgotten by your sister you might even be forgotten about your mother and your father but you can never be forgotten by God because he promised in his word he he promised in his word and Isaiah he said but Zion said the Lord hath forsaken me and my Lord hath forgotten me but he said can a woman forgive her suckling child now how powerful is that a can a woman forget her suckling child he said yeah that they should have not compassion on the son of her womb yay they may forget oh how powerful that is because my wife is is in that part of life right now where she has that little Reagan and she's holding little Reagan and she's taking care of Reagan all day long everything that she does is around that child I watch her I watch her making bottles I watch her waking up to feed the baby I watch everything that you constant just taking care taking care taking care and God has promised that she has a better chance of forgetting that she ever existed than God than the mighty Shepherd would ever forget about you but Z said the Lord has forsaken me and my Lord has forgotten me can a woman forget her suckling child that she would not have compassion on the son of her womb yet they may forget yet I will not forget thee behold I have Graven thee upon the palms of my hands and th walls are continually before me I'm here to tell you tonight the shepherd has not forgot about [Applause] you he told Jeremiah I think it's is so beautiful before Jeremiah knew himself God knew him before Jeremiah ever came into a conscious decision that I'm Jeremiah God said when you were in your mother's womb Jeremiah I already knew you and I already ordained you to be a prophet amen he says I know the thoughts that I think towards you thoughts of peace and not of evil you know when you're a sheep and you hear the voice yes sir there's something in you you can't help but respond to that voice there's something in you that that's the master brother Bron says here why it must be a Shepherd Why must a Shepherd be on duty at all times he must be sure that none of his sheep's lost aren't you glad of that if the Sheep her loses if the shepherd loses one sheep it's a reproach on the shepherd He that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall never come to judgment but pass from Death To Life Shepherds won't lose his sheep you know if you're a sheep all the father has given me will come to me and all that will come to me I will in no wise cast out but will give him everlasting life and though oh The Undertaker puts him in the ground he my sheep will hear my voice and raise him up at the last day praise be to the Living God see there's nothing that can keep you from hearing the voice my sheep hear my voice Jesus said at that day all that is in the grave shall hear the voice of the great Shepherd and shall come forth Hallelujah come forth the everlasting life oh to that great day of the coming of the Sheep's Shepherd Sorrows of Tears can never keep the shepherd away corruption he proved it at the grave of Lazarus this is beautiful Lazarus was one of those little lambs Lazarus was one of his little lambs and he was laying in the B he was laying in the body the bottom of a pit a stone rolled over it his body was molded then nose dropped in the skin worms were eating him up but the chief Shepherd come up to the grave and he knows his Sheep by name and if he speaks your name now and calls you answer for there's going to be a time said the prophet that he will call and I will answer him Lazarus was 4 days dead his body was corrupted but the shepherd spake in corrup corruption knew its master and the soul that was dead four days journey turned back into that body in the body that had been in baled no blood the cells was broke he was rotten in the grave but the Shepherd Of Life spoke the name of his lamb and his lamb let out a bleach and said here I come when the shepherd begins to talk it don't matter what's there there is nothing that will keep the shepherd's voice from getting to you and when you're a sheep there's nothing that'll keep you from [Applause] responding when the shepherd begins to call that's right yes sir when the shepherd calls let let me tell you something when the shepherd calls he isn't going to be saying something negative that's right so when you hear a voice if it's negative it's not the shepherd but you know when you go to church you'll hear the shepherd and the shepherd will begin to speak and it'll begin to call things out and it begin to say give that to me give that to me that don't belong to you that's not what remember what a good shepherd will do he'll keep the evil spirits out of the church and when there's something in your life and the and the shepherd begins to call to you a deep call to the deep and there's a deep to respond that says not my will but thy will oh Lord he'll come to you in a service and he'll begin to call out that depression he'll begin to say that's not who you are that's not what you belong to you are not depression you are my sheep you are not sickness you are my [Applause] sheep I've never seen it so much in my life where young people are battling suicidal thoughts and suicidal spirits that is not the shepherd's voice talking to you you are not supposed to follow the voice of depression or the voice of anxiety or the voice of fear we are to follow the voice of the [Applause] [Music] shepherd you said brother Seth I feel unreachable I'm closing here s the great Shepherd leaves the 99 to find the one he'll put a service together like this for one [Applause] person he came to be a shepherd and he was a Shepherd a Shepherd is one who goes after his sheep a famous picture I don't think we have it on our walls here but I've set it in room and and lo and looked at it I just can't call the artist's name but when he lost that little black sheep and he leaves the 90 and n and goes to look for it how many's thankful for that Satan told you you were insufficient not good enough but listen he'll go after you what does he do he Strays through the Wilderness he cuts himself with Briars he pulls through the dangers prows all through the night until he finally finds way down on the side of the mountain hanging by a little Bush risking his own life he reaches and takes the little fellow out that's falling condition then brings it back to himself and another artist painted a picture of him bringing it home now it looks like the shepherd would just stick him under an arm and and keep the sheet and start bringing it in like that but you notice the the spirit caught the AR his brush and he didn't put it under his arm but he put it on his shoulders now I want you to see the care of the shepherd now Jesus when he was casting out Devils he done it with a finger now if a devil's bothering you the only thing he takes of God is just an insignificant till he takes his finger and casts it away but when a sheep comes home where's the strongest part of a man across the shoulders you notice how a man always his shoulders is the biggest when he can pack the Great greatest load across his shoulders where is the most shest of when the load's across his shoulders so he takes the Sheep lays around his shoulders and gently walks it back all the powers of God wrapped up in the little lost fellow bringing him back but a devil so easy he just cast it away with his finger but he's a Shepherd Hallelujah I'm so glad that he's on duty day and night he'll said I'll never leave thee nor forsake Thee I will be with thee always even to the end of the world church I'm here to tell you tonight he ain't going to leave you wherever you find you wherever you're at he'll get to you listen little sheep he'll find [Applause] [Music] you you know why I'll find you cuz he never lost you he said I'll never lose a one and you can never be plucked from his hand you know church I just had I I have a good friend who's a good fundamental Baptist very good very good brother and and he came up to me because he he he's really been seeking the Lord and I appreciate that and in all of my heart and he's seeking the Lord and and he's known me for years we've been buddies for years and and he asked me he said he said brother he said how do you deal with anxiety and disappointments and when you don't feel the presence of the Lord and man it just kind of caught me out of nowhere and I said let me you know Lord let me answer this the right way and I began walk around and I walked and I thought about it and I said now ask me that again he said well you know how do you he said you know I recently I was searching the Lord so hard and and he said I began to have an anxiety attack he said do you go through disappointments and absolutely buddy I go through disappointments I go through low valleys I I go through times where where I can't seem to find God can we be honest this evening I go through times where where I'll be walking and and and if we're all being honest there's times where we go Where's God at and and and and you know it seems like the weight of the world is coming down on us but you know there's one thing that came to me his name's Ben I said Ben let me tell you something you know he's he's taken this time and and he's gave up everything to try to know Jesus and he's he he's given up everything to try to get closer to God and closer to God and closer to God and closer to God and I finally told him I said Ben things are going to get a lot easier for you when you realize it was God calling you and not you searching for God I said he says all that the father has given me will come to me and all that comes to me I will in no wise cast out I said you see Ben the whole time you thought you were searching for God when the whole time God was searching for you Church we're not relying on our own ability and what we can do but being confidence is the very thing he that which ha begun a good work in you will perform it till the day of Jesus Christ yeah there's days when we have bad days yeah there's days when we fail but the shepherd's always there you musicians would like to come to the music was never you holding yourself brother bham says after through the services this week trying to show the people that there's no need of being scared that's right the worst thing the devil can put upon you is fear that's right if you even had a Cancer and didn't fear and believe God would heal you you couldn't be in too bad a shape God take care of that if you were sick whatever it is if you didn't fear so fear is one of the worst things that Satan can place upon a person now this week I've tried to prove by the scripture that the man that's born of the kingdom of God has nothing to fear you're absolutely safely secure in Christ all the father has given me he said will come to me and no man can come lest the father calls the father has to lead him up to me amen amen and he that cometh to me yes sir I will in no wise C pass out do you realize how much God loves you that God called you God brought you and God won't lose you no man is greater than he he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is pass from Death to life he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood will will not have but hath present tense everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day wherefore grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed on the day of your Redemption there you are sealed away until the day of your Redemption not just from revival to another Revival you see Church the shepherd doesn't lose his own am the shepherd doesn't lose his own amen amen amen when you're on the greatest Mountain Top you've ever been on oh yeah this is my point tonight yes sir this is what I wanted to get to if you're on the greatest Mountaintop you've ever been on and you feel the presence of the Lord greater than you've ever felt in your life and you know without a shadow of De the shepherd's there you say oh man the shepherd's here I walk into church and I I get that feeling of the presence of God yes sir and it's so great and so wonderful but church when you go through that Valley and you're at the lowest part of your life and you get all the way down there in that Valley like the eagle blinded crusted over and you go I can't feel the presence of God I don't have the love that I once had I don't have all these things that I once had in my life and I want that real walk with God and listen in this life there's going going to be mountains there's going to be valleys but one thing's for sure there'll always be a [Music] Shepherd you see he knows how to put that honey on the Rock even when you're in a valley and and you're down there in the lowest point of your life and you say I'll never go back to that church why do I even try I I I I just can't do it anymore I'm just going to give up they treated me wrong they did this to me they did that to me but then you find yourself back right here again and you know what you say how did I get here I told myself I wouldn't come back I told myself that would be my last service and then next thing you know you're back here again you're hearing the word of God you're s you begin to worship again and you're on your way back up the mountain and you're sitting there going you know what you realize the same Shepherd that's on the mountain is the same Shepherd that's in the [Applause] Valley and you're not here cuz you called yourself you're not here cuz you saved yourself you're not here because you set yourself free but the shepherd did [Applause] [Music] it amen Lord that means that settles it all anything God says you love him so so much you believe it I feel real religious right now to think that perfect love cast out all fear you're not scared about nothing you're just resting you're just resing oh I may backslide tomorrow I may backslide next week I won't worry about that I'm not trying to hold on that's right I'm not trying to hold on he held on for me and he put a love in my heart that holds there it's him holding me not me holding him if it was me holding him I'd proba turn loose but as long as he's holding me he will never turn loose he promised he wouldn't I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee somebody asked me and I'm trying to get I'm trying to stop somebody asked me not long ago they were going through such a trial in their life and they felt like they couldn't go no further and they say what do you think I said well you know there's many times that I've realized I've been holding on to him but I also realized that there was times when it was too much to bear and I realized he was holding on to me the whole time not just part of the time what I'm trying to get to you your whole life everything the shepherd has been right there the times you didn't understand he was there he was there all the time you know what we do we just follow the shepherd all we have to do is follow the shepherd let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus you see this father broken up sermon tonight father and Lord I know Lord that in myself Lord I feel like it was a failure but Lord you promised your word would not return unto you void and Lord maybe this service father the the way that it was worded and different things Lord maybe it was just for one Lord maybe you were just going after that one in the 99 father Lord you left the 99 Lord to go tell that one person I've always been with you I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you and when you couldn't go no further I was carrying you the whole time Lord I pray for that person Lord that tonight Lord you would encourage them that Lord you spoke to them tonight that you're their Shepherd I'm sure there was many things they didn't understand and why they went through certain things Lord maybe somebody even listening in but Lord You're their Shepherd and Lord I believe they're your sheep and Lord as you speak father they're hearing your voice Lord that's telling them to come out of that worry come out of that fear all those different things that have been bothering you CU father you just want to give them rest Lord because you're their Shepherd father and you're Our Shepherd tonight Lord Jesus father we thank you for that Lord I look back so many times Lord where Seth coffee gave up but the shepherd didn't all the times I quit but you didn't Lord I never forget when I was a 15-year-old boy Lord and I Heard a Voice called me called me to an altar Lord and you never let me go Hallelujah father was many trials many tribulations many things to go through but when I walked I realized I wasn't walking alone father but you were with me let us realize that tonight we're not walking alone father but we have the shepherd Lord we thank you for all that you do for us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight I'm sorry if I held you too long I don't don't rightly know when I started I just want to say as I turn it back over to brother Steven and if it's all right with him if anybody needs prayer I'd be happy to pray with them we'll turn it back over to brother Steven [Music] now praise God sister Lily did you talk to him before you sing Hallelujah that's right how did it match Lord when did you put up your song request Monday did you talk to him hallu and on Wednesday somebody's coming with a sermon and a song and a sermon are blending together one day you will realize who's in this building one day you will realize who's here and let me put it up this way one day you will realize who is who started this church and who is preaching in this church who singing in this church who is receiving this church who is saying Amen in this church and you will find all God through all in all and filling all I'm going to let you go home I didn't I thought you preach short I was still waiting I said Keep moving keep moving I didn't even realize about the time if this is a ship fold and these are ships amen are we together and one of these ship come out we call this a 100 ship one of these ship come out this is scripture and he's outside how many are left there 9 99 and suddenly we see the shepherd here abandoning 99 sheep maybe among the n99 they are saying Daddy Daddy and he doesn't listen he's going outside amen maybe this one say I'm hungry but the shepherd keep moving away so to the conclusion of human amen this ship here value more is that difficult it's more value than the Nan are we together are we together so this ship now begin to realize that you know what I never knew that daddy love me so much that he can leave n n so I have a special love are we together and the Sheep comes back to the fold and say you know what I'm special among the F because when something happened to me Daddy will leave all of you and follow me amen then tomorrow this sheep here Le are we together are we together when this leave how many are staying there what do you think the father will do go for it so what does this this one think now so who is really [Applause] special who is really special you will realize that all of us are special and God love us all the same way and the same energy he's going to put for you he's going to put for anyone so don't let somebody tell you that I God love me more than you no amen he will do the same thing because of all of them he's not going to lose one of them that's what God want you to do Amen to understand that though you walk in the Valley of the shadow of death just know that I am ready amen so the mountain doesn't means the Pres of God the valley also doesn't means that God is not there if you his child whether it's in the mountain or in a valley God is there whether you see me you feel me or you don't feel me you don't feel nothing you feel like your prayer are blocked nothing is working up it looks like all hell is broken loose upon me don't worry about it somebody is somewhere in the mountain watching for it amen am what was traveling the disciple on the boat it was water amen mixed with wind amen and demon in it and where where what did Jesus do did he fly did they saw somebody flying huh did they see somebody flying they saw somebody walking on the very thing that was troubling [Applause] them if he's already walking on the water and the water are traveling what does he tell you he's the master of everything he can walk on that cancer he can walk on that kidney trouble he can walk on that finances trouble he can walk on that skin issue he can walk on that depression he can walk on anything because he's the master of it he knows what to do he is God he is your Shepherd and he shall never leave you nor forsake you the
