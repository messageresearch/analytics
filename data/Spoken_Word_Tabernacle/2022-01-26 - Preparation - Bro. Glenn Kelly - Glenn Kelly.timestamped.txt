[37:12] amen
[37:14] praise be to the name of the lord
[37:17] sounds like everybody is ready for the
[37:19] sermon
[37:20] did you dig into the fine curtain again
[37:24] amen
[37:25] did you meditate and chew over it chew
[37:27] over it chew over it and the holy spirit
[37:30] unfolded more and more and more and more
[37:33] amen
[37:34] you need to understand those that
[37:36] curtain first because on sunday we
[37:39] is soaring again
[37:41] amen
[37:42] they're calling up for snow
[37:44] not a big snow you already got your big
[37:46] snow you were happy
[37:48] so not a big snow it's uh either two
[37:52] inches or something on uh
[37:54] friday
[37:56] probably the evening till like uh
[37:58] midnight or something like that so
[38:01] it's a little bit questioning about the
[38:03] house meeting on saturday whether we're
[38:06] going to have it or not or we need to
[38:08] push it i know sunday by god's grace if
[38:10] the lord don't tarry we will have
[38:12] service so don't get the snow from
[38:15] friday to run away from service on
[38:16] sunday amen
[38:18] we have service on sunday morning amen
[38:21] it's not a big snow then it's
[38:22] questionable so we will monitor the
[38:24] weather again tomorrow lord's willing
[38:26] and we will send out the text to confirm
[38:30] whether we're going to keep the house
[38:31] meeting or we need to reschedule it i
[38:34] know you got question i got two
[38:36] beautiful questions today
[38:39] somebody sent it to me and i could not
[38:41] hold it
[38:42] i have to answer them and then i ask a
[38:45] letter is this for saturday they say yes
[38:48] and i already answered them
[38:50] amen so we will see if we have a meeting
[38:53] on saturday and the lord allowed more
[38:55] time then we can
[38:57] repeat those questions so somebody else
[38:59] can benefit the problem with question
[39:01] and answer we don't record them so if
[39:03] you miss it
[39:04] those that online if you miss it you
[39:07] miss it
[39:08] amen so it's better to do everything
[39:11] that you can
[39:12] if you can make it to be there because
[39:14] we don't record them we don't want to
[39:15] record people asking questions it's not
[39:18] a little bit good to put them on the
[39:20] public amen so just remember that if you
[39:23] have other questions please feel free to
[39:26] send it a little bit quicker maybe by
[39:28] friday if i can have everything so it
[39:31] gives me a little bit of time to go
[39:33] ahead it's difficult to bring a question
[39:35] on saturday morning or at three o'clock
[39:37] then
[39:38] i'm already prepared for five six seven
[39:40] questions amen so the sooner you send
[39:43] those questions the better by god's
[39:46] grace one of them was about the two
[39:47] souls
[39:48] which is a very very very good subject
[39:52] and i can see the holy spirit moving
[39:54] because the person who has that almost
[39:57] was entering in the sunday sermon
[40:00] so
[40:01] we will get deeper sooner if you can
[40:05] i know
[40:06] i know
[40:08] the devil is gonna fight you to stay
[40:10] away from church
[40:12] don't do that
[40:13] amen we're trying to help you
[40:16] amen if you got your birthday on sunday
[40:19] this on sunday this on sunday please try
[40:22] to postpone those stuff let's get
[40:24] serious with god amen because as soon as
[40:27] you
[40:28] you mentioned something like this before
[40:29] you know it why were you not on sunday
[40:31] this happened there just a little bit
[40:33] something somebody is already out some
[40:35] even run away when they know i'm
[40:37] preaching
[40:39] so they know that the fire is coming up
[40:41] so don't run away it's a different story
[40:44] to listen to the sermon at home
[40:47] versus to be in the church
[40:49] so that's the reason why i'm insisting
[40:51] to be in the church because of the
[40:54] anointing that is there except if you
[40:56] absolutely have to stay home
[41:00] then god who sees your heart
[41:02] will open a special channel for you so
[41:05] you can benefit for it but if you're
[41:07] taking that for granted to stay at home
[41:10] then god is judging you by your heart
[41:13] you're not going to receive it if you
[41:15] were in service and you get it then you
[41:18] go home you listen at home that's a
[41:20] different story the anointing was still
[41:22] working so i'm not saying you can't get
[41:24] anything from the channel but if you can
[41:26] make it to church
[41:28] make sure you're in church amen
[41:30] so be gracious because we're gonna rock
[41:33] your boat very hard
[41:35] i'm sorry i'm just warning you
[41:38] it's gonna shake you like you've never
[41:40] been shaken
[41:42] um we're not trying to kill you
[41:44] we're not trying to de-christianize you
[41:47] we're just
[41:48] opening this thing so you can see where
[41:50] you are
[41:52] these things has been confused for years
[41:55] in the message i know what i'm talking
[41:58] about whether people have the holy ghost
[42:00] or whether they don't have it
[42:02] amen
[42:03] how do you receive it did i receive it
[42:05] because this happened to me because i
[42:07] felt warm because i felt this this a lot
[42:10] of questions amen
[42:13] so if if you feel like your boat has
[42:16] been rock
[42:17] remember i don't live with you
[42:20] i'm not living in your house
[42:22] so if you hear something pulling up from
[42:25] your house you need to be spiritually
[42:28] mature enough
[42:30] to understand that it's not me
[42:33] the high priest is zeroed in
[42:36] things and pulling them up amen so don't
[42:39] run away you who are not here tonight do
[42:42] not run away
[42:44] come on sunday amen
[42:46] let's rock the boat for a month and move
[42:49] it left and right left and right left
[42:51] and right amen
[42:53] it's deep i know
[42:56] praise god everything will be all right
[42:59] by god's grace you might be seated
[43:00] because i don't want to hold you too
[43:02] long amen
[43:04] so remember tomorrow be on the lookout
[43:06] for the
[43:08] for the uh for the s the text and then
[43:11] we'll let you know about it question and
[43:13] answer if you have them please by friday
[43:16] morning that would be better so i have
[43:18] enough time to go look it up the sisters
[43:21] meeting we have not uh come up with a
[43:23] date yet i was looking at her question
[43:26] this morning
[43:28] and i look at one i thought
[43:31] he was a
[43:34] chicken nugget but he was not
[43:39] the word of god is food
[43:42] it's spiritual food in due season so
[43:44] when i say delicious it's tsunami i'm
[43:46] talking about the word of god amen test
[43:49] god when they took the book
[43:51] john ate the book it was sweet so it's
[43:54] our food amen
[43:55] it is delicious not to this one the
[43:58] inner man
[43:59] hey man that's where you get it amen
[44:02] so i thought it was something really on
[44:04] the surface when i tried to put my hand
[44:06] there but robert i found myself in the
[44:09] ocean
[44:11] amen
[44:12] and it's getting into marriage
[44:15] pure
[44:16] so i'm still debating and praying
[44:19] whether i need to answer that to the
[44:20] sisters meeting or he's going to be pure
[44:23] to the marriage and when i dig on
[44:25] brother branham things begin to unfold
[44:28] to unfold to unfold and scripture begin
[44:31] to come up never seen it before and here
[44:33] they come up today this morning but they
[44:36] begin to unfold so you pray for me i
[44:38] will talk to the deacon and see brother
[44:40] branham used to handle that separately
[44:42] but
[44:44] the problem we have if you don't
[44:46] understand the background which brother
[44:48] branham called the back part mind of god
[44:51] the message will be legalistic
[44:54] did you get it
[44:55] in other good words if i just tell you
[44:57] stop wearing high heel
[44:59] it's a legalistic
[45:01] that's why we have to teach
[45:03] where is high heel in the scripture
[45:05] where he's in in a message why is
[45:07] brother branham against it then you will
[45:09] understand that high heel give you a
[45:11] shape different than what god gave you
[45:14] and that shape is a shape to provoke
[45:17] somebody and to lust that's why
[45:19] hallelujah is wrong once you understand
[45:21] the concept then you know it's wrong
[45:23] it's going to come off if it doesn't
[45:25] come off then i'm dealing with
[45:27] a stubborn spirit right there of
[45:29] unbelief that we need to keep praying
[45:31] and then break that through amen so
[45:34] that's the reason why those things i'm
[45:36] thinking
[45:37] if i can get if i have to open them up i
[45:40] cannot record that
[45:42] it's going to be if i recorded it's
[45:44] going to be only for the church because
[45:46] by the bratham didn't want to handle it
[45:48] publicly and if you open it somebody
[45:51] will grab it and
[45:52] if they're not spiritually minded they
[45:55] can put all kind of excuses to move that
[45:57] direction i want people that's going to
[45:59] be here that's going to listen that
[46:01] knows where they where where where is
[46:04] the intent of god about it then when you
[46:06] open up the seed especially those that
[46:10] are married
[46:12] younger one because sometimes you call
[46:14] people the order will come and the
[46:16] youngest i have problem have all kind of
[46:18] excused work and all kind of stuff and
[46:20] that's where the problem is amen i'm
[46:23] talking as a pastor so you pray for me i
[46:25] will see if i answer that to the sister
[46:27] it might be to a certain extent i have
[46:29] to stop because it's purely into
[46:31] marriage amen
[46:33] blessed be the name of the lord we
[46:34] already talked to you about the building
[46:36] fund this sunday we have the election of
[46:39] the church officer remember that in
[46:41] prayer so the lord will guide you he we
[46:44] gave an announcement two or three weeks
[46:46] ago it was mute on youtube if you missed
[46:49] the announcement that was given because
[46:51] of the church officer you talk to the
[46:53] deacon they will let you know what is
[46:55] going on amen
[46:57] blessed be the name of the lord i
[46:58] believe that's all i have if you have
[47:01] time continue to listen to hidden life
[47:04] that will help you up here in life one
[47:06] hidden life with christ or hidden life
[47:08] in christ if you finish them all three
[47:11] you tell me then i tell you why
[47:14] so many people cannot leave
[47:17] what is the title again
[47:19] why are so many people tossed about and
[47:21] then where did the pentecost affair then
[47:23] the third one so we're going to
[47:26] take all those sermons and put them
[47:27] together and then you see how they're
[47:29] going to come up amen so let's stand now

[51:25] verse 8
[51:27] amen
[51:30] but you shall receive power
[51:32] after that the holy ghost has come
[51:35] see
[51:36] the lord been telling us the holy ghost
[51:38] is already there is that right
[51:40] because he put the seed there before the
[51:42] foundation of the world we just want the
[51:45] spirit to come down and water it is that
[51:47] right
[51:48] huh because we can't do nothing it's not
[51:50] by power it's not by might but it's by
[51:53] my spirit say to the lord huh driving
[51:55] these intellectual demons out of here in
[51:57] this age
[51:59] he says that the holy ghost has come
[52:01] unto you and ye shall be witnesses unto
[52:04] me both in jerusalem and into judea and
[52:07] to sumeria and to the uttermost part of
[52:09] the earth so all the part of the earth
[52:12] now let's go to hebrews 10.
[52:15] we don't know which way we're going to
[52:17] go because i'll tell you i didn't have
[52:18] much time but that's okay we'll read the
[52:21] text and
[52:22] he'll bring the contents is that right
[52:24] you just pull for him you know what you
[52:26] come looking for tonight you know what
[52:28] you need tonight i'm sure looking for
[52:30] mine is that right hallelujah i got no
[52:34] use for the devil was that right it's no
[52:36] good
[52:38] time for us to come up here hebrew 10
[52:41] and verse 5. you have it say amen
[52:43] wherefore
[52:45] when he cometh into the world he said
[52:47] sacrifice and offering thou what is not
[52:50] but
[52:51] thou offering thou what is not
[52:54] but a body has thou prepared me
[52:57] may the lord had a blessing to the
[52:59] reading of his word you may be seated
[53:01] so we come here on tonight the thought
[53:04] that was on on on my heart it was just
[53:07] preparation
[53:09] you know preparation
[53:11] you know i had a chance to look at there
[53:13] and they were just touching my heart
[53:15] from sunday the lord ritually blessed is
[53:18] that right
[53:19] oh my god and when i saw those thorns on
[53:23] his head huh when god brought them
[53:25] thorns huh
[53:29] you know the devil he's got to
[53:30] understand what god is doing in this
[53:32] hour here now
[53:34] what the lord is doing in this hour here
[53:36] right now now he's unfolding every
[53:39] hidden manner is that right see
[53:42] something you have to understand you got
[53:44] you have to realize you're already in
[53:47] the veil you're in the holiness of holy
[53:49] you got to go look at the god unveiling
[53:52] when you go look in that message i know
[53:54] i won't have time to get in that but if
[53:56] you go in that message to show you
[53:58] you're already in the veil is that right
[54:01] you're already in the holiness of holy
[54:03] god came and he showed us that it's so
[54:06] simple but it's going over their heads
[54:08] is that right but it's only for the true
[54:11] believer
[54:12] that's always for the true believer
[54:15] you see so when you're recognizing his
[54:17] hour here now what god never does
[54:20] nothing without preparing something
[54:22] first is that right that's why we said
[54:25] preparation when you're now he's
[54:27] preparing it when we come at you when
[54:29] you came here tonight you had to get
[54:31] yourself ready you had to prepare when
[54:34] you hit the children for school you have
[54:36] to prepare
[54:37] when you go to work you have to prepare
[54:40] so when we come in there you know you
[54:42] always have to prepare we just don't go
[54:45] into a battle without first preparing is
[54:48] that right but the beauty thing about it
[54:50] with us is that that's why the holy
[54:52] spirit say stay in neutral but when god
[54:56] prepares something is that right when
[54:59] god prepared something he prepared us
[55:02] for this age saints and just pray with
[55:04] me tonight we didn't plan to be long but
[55:06] we want to show you what god is
[55:08] preparing in that old testament he had
[55:11] types he's bringing it up to now he's
[55:13] bringing us he's prepared us to be
[55:15] achievers he prepared us to be
[55:18] overcomers he prepared us see man always
[55:22] want to try to do things himself is that
[55:26] right even there in the garden or even
[55:28] oh look at adam and eve they the only
[55:31] one who had god actually talking to them
[55:34] brother benjamin god was talking to them
[55:37] in the garden god had prepared
[55:40] everything for him they didn't have to
[55:42] do anything but what speak the word is
[55:44] that right
[55:46] but now for us this is the manifestation
[55:49] time it's not just the word it's the
[55:52] manifestation of the word is that right
[55:55] that's why he says what a light cannot
[55:57] be hidden in his hour in that no no no
[56:00] no no you can't put it up under the bush
[56:03] no no no no no no no no this is the
[56:06] manifestation
[56:07] now of christ himself that's why he says
[56:11] in time past god has spoke to us in
[56:14] diverse time he spoke to the prophet he
[56:17] said now he's speaking through his son
[56:20] jesus christ is that right
[56:22] they were the prophets of god is that
[56:25] right now jesus became what god became
[56:29] the prophet under the spirit under the
[56:32] anointing of christ back on the scene
[56:34] again is that right now we're in
[56:37] appearing ready appearing i'll tell you
[56:40] huh
[56:41] hallelujah we love the appearing the
[56:45] appearing is the unfolding of the word
[56:47] is that right god made a stage when we
[56:51] was there in the old temple old
[56:53] tabernacle is that right when the
[56:55] tabernacle that was made with hands god
[56:57] did not act never did one of them dwelt
[57:00] in the tabernacle made with him is that
[57:02] right he always destroyed it i don't
[57:05] want to get ahead of myself preparation
[57:08] man always trying to prepare something
[57:11] for himself
[57:12] we're going to show you his two spirits
[57:14] that's supposed to be moving in this
[57:16] time right now brother branham talked
[57:18] about it is that right see you have to
[57:21] understand now stay away from them
[57:23] demons religious demon fussing with a
[57:25] religious demon is that right they ain't
[57:28] got time to fuss with religious demons
[57:30] we're looking for you on a mission we're
[57:32] looking for that last soul we're looking
[57:35] for that last seed god is doing too much
[57:37] for us right now it's like five being

[1:19:55] hello who in here no longer what those
[1:19:59] desires of the world right huh we don't
[1:20:01] want the desires of the world right so
[1:20:04] what the holy ghost told us he told us
[1:20:06] under the inspiration when the pastor
[1:20:08] was ministered the holy ghost is there
[1:20:10] is that right is convict you he was
[1:20:13] saying paul said the things i desire to
[1:20:17] do i did not the things i desired not to
[1:20:20] do i did but it was a war going on in my
[1:20:24] mind is that right among my members what
[1:20:27] the world was going on in his spirit and
[1:20:30] his spirit was now war with that flesh
[1:20:33] because he was feeding his man deadly
[1:20:35] the black dog was being pushed out
[1:20:38] pushed out pushed down the holy ghost
[1:20:40] was there that's why we said you have to
[1:20:43] understand when you are now we are all
[1:20:45] born of what one spirit is that right
[1:20:48] but what you have to do is cast down
[1:20:51] every imagination that exhort itself
[1:20:54] against the lord is that right and ask
[1:20:56] god how that devil come in
[1:20:59] you have to know you everyone know the
[1:21:01] wickedness and the business you know

[1:21:35] flu season you have to know what you
[1:21:38] have to do to keep that devil off of you
[1:21:41] is that right
[1:21:44] [Music]
[1:21:46] it's what he says
[1:21:47] you got to realize huh and naturally
[1:21:51] they tell you to get on there
[1:21:52] they well
[1:21:54] let me see this you need to get on some
[1:21:57] natural things
[1:21:59] just like garlic a devil won't come six
[1:22:01] inches of a garlic is that right huh
[1:22:04] huh
[1:22:05] you don't let me do no garlic huh yeah
[1:22:07] there ain't no garlic garlic can cure a
[1:22:09] lot of things i'm telling you castor oil
[1:22:11] too and i'm trying to tell you these
[1:22:13] things you got to understand these
[1:22:15] natural things for your body is that
[1:22:17] right you got to realize those things
[1:22:20] don't you get close to somebody because
[1:22:21] they ain't going to come near you
[1:22:22] neither that garlic on you let me tell
[1:22:24] you something now look
[1:22:26] he said look you gotta understand what
[1:22:29] the lord is trying to bring you into in
[1:22:31] this hour here now here's a certain
[1:22:33] thing you have to realize
[1:22:35] that we have to fight we're in a war
[1:22:37] we're wrestling out against flesh and
[1:22:38] blood but against principalities and
[1:22:41] powers wickedness and rulers in high
[1:22:43] places those sicknesses is of the devil
[1:22:46] those are demons they were there
[1:22:48] that's why he was saying over the world
[1:22:51] some you go to some places i see why
[1:22:53] brother brown said you don't go out he
[1:22:55] didn't go out preaching adoption i was
[1:22:57] in one place preaching adoption one
[1:22:58] fellows thought i was telling him don't
[1:23:00] pray for people don't lay hands on
[1:23:02] people no i wasn't saying that
[1:23:04] we were just moving you up hither is
[1:23:06] that right you're moving up it hit them
[1:23:09] for this age that's all you he was
[1:23:11] saying brother branham still pray for
[1:23:13] people because he understood where they
[1:23:15] was at he understand that the compassion
[1:23:18] that was given unto them through him he
[1:23:20] understood those things but he was still
[1:23:22] trying to do what trying to get us to a
[1:23:25] point where you just received the word
[1:23:29] is that right you receive the word of
[1:23:32] god so that's why he said when an
[1:23:34] unclean spirit comes out of a man and he
[1:23:38] walks out of that man now you're looking
[1:23:40] for a place to go where is he looking
[1:23:43] for a place to go
[1:23:44] from somebody that got religion
[1:23:47] now you got religion you got
[1:23:49] justification sanctification he talks
[1:23:51] about what that spiritual realm that's
[1:23:54] what deceives so many people because
[1:23:56] they got that's getting that spiritual
[1:23:58] realm and they get clean but they never
[1:24:01] receive that word that's going to steal
[1:24:04] them
[1:24:05] whatever they trouble with is going to
[1:24:07] sell them he said grieve not the holy
[1:24:09] spirit of god for which by you are
[1:24:12] sealed until the day of the redemption
[1:24:15] so you have to understand when you look
[1:24:18] into the message and somehow when you
[1:24:20] come into preparation don't let the
[1:24:23] devil try to get you to sleep don't let
[1:24:25] the devil try to put you pressure on the
[1:24:27] pulpit because he know the word that you
[1:24:30] receive is going to set you free
[1:24:33] and now that's the message for the hour
[1:24:36] and so when it comes and that message
[1:24:38] they're coming you realize the lord is
[1:24:41] trying to bring something to you is that
[1:24:43] right god then god rich in mercy did not
[1:24:47] curse adam he cursed the ground is that
[1:24:50] right now that's why he said everything
[1:24:54] at the cross at the cross where i first
[1:24:56] saw the light and the burdens of my
[1:24:59] heart rode away it was there by faith i
[1:25:02] received my sight and now we're happy
[1:25:05] all today see why because now he did
[1:25:08] what took the curse off of the ground is
[1:25:11] that right my my my my my my my mind
[1:25:15] don't you know that the earth is moaning
[1:25:17] and groaning for all the manifestation
[1:25:20] of the sons and daughters of the most
[1:25:23] high god
[1:25:25] [Music]
[1:25:29] look what he says
[1:25:31] now look at our time isn't that right
[1:25:34] the manifestation supposed to be on our
[1:25:37] time
[1:25:38] turn to mark 16.
[1:25:40] hallelujah
[1:25:42] you don't have to be afraid of no devil

[1:25:50] with that unbelief
[1:25:53] hallelujah
[1:25:56] in verse
[1:25:58] 16

[1:26:04] he did what appeared on 2 11 as they sat
[1:26:07] and meet and upgraded their
[1:26:10] with their what
[1:26:11] unbelief and their what hardness of
[1:26:14] heart
[1:26:15] because they believed not them which had
[1:26:18] seen him after he was risen he said and
[1:26:22] he said unto them go into all the world
[1:26:25] and preach the gospel to what

[1:26:32] brought them he's taught us you're being
[1:26:35] taught here and what you're being taught
[1:26:37] here now you reply with that gospel when
[1:26:41] you go out there

[1:26:44] gospel just doesn't come in letter only
[1:26:47] it comes in power and demonstration is
[1:26:50] that right he said now look it says he
[1:26:53] that believeth in his baptized shall be

[1:29:28] let's look at verse 1
[1:29:30] 1-5
[1:29:32] and he says uh
[1:29:34] he says in hiran
[1:29:36] the king of tyra sent his servants unto
[1:29:38] solomon for he had heard that they had
[1:29:40] anointed him king in the room of his
[1:29:43] father and hyran was was ever a lover of
[1:29:47] david he says and solomon sent to him
[1:29:50] and saying thou knowest how that david
[1:29:53] my father could not build a house into
[1:29:55] the name of the lord his god for the
[1:29:58] wars were about him on every side until
[1:30:01] the lord put them under the soles of his
[1:30:04] feet he said but now the lord my god
[1:30:07] have given me what rest on what every
[1:30:10] side i got peace on every side they did
[1:30:14] not wait until they didn't wait sooner
[1:30:17] they heard solomon was king is that
[1:30:19] right they started moving into it he
[1:30:22] said that there is neither adversary nor
[1:30:24] evil occur he says and behold i what
[1:30:28] purpose to build and house unto the name
[1:30:31] of the lord my god as the lord spake
[1:30:34] unto david my father saying thy son and
[1:30:38] i will set upon thy throne in thy room
[1:30:42] and he shall build what
[1:30:44] a house unto my name prepare
[1:30:48] preparation still with me he had to
[1:30:51] prepare for preparation there solomon
[1:30:54] was drop down over here to chapter six
[1:30:59] now solomon is building this temple
[1:31:02] look over there to verse
[1:31:04] 7
[1:31:05] 6-7 he says in the house when it was
[1:31:08] when it was building was built of a
[1:31:11] stone made ready before it was bought
[1:31:14] hither so that there was neither
[1:31:15] hammering or action or tool or iron
[1:31:18] or heard in the house while it was what
[1:31:21] in the building look up here to verse 5
[1:31:24] that's 115. he says in the walls of the
[1:31:27] house he built see prepared chambers
[1:31:30] around about against the walls of the
[1:31:32] house round about both of the temple and
[1:31:36] of the what
[1:31:37] the oracle and he made chambers round
[1:31:40] about the oracle was it the we were set
[1:31:43] built up for the holiness of holy
[1:31:47] that's where the ark was sitting at you
[1:31:49] got to go over there into the unveiling
[1:31:52] of god and brother brandon worked
[1:31:53] through i'll tell you he worked that
[1:31:55] mighty in there the long message but he
[1:31:57] was showing you how you're in the
[1:31:59] holiness of holy because of what by one
[1:32:03] what spirit are we all baptized when you
[1:32:06] are we're at in christ you are a new
[1:32:09] creature in christ jesus you are eating
[1:32:12] the holiness of the holy you are eating
[1:32:15] a hidden manner now that's why god is
[1:32:18] unfolding these things because you
[1:32:20] didn't stop with justification you
[1:32:22] didn't stop with sanctification you were
[1:32:24] wrong with the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:32:26] but then he moved us into what the
[1:32:29] adoption is that right that's what he
[1:32:31] was always trying to get us to
[1:32:35] from the whole time to the adoption why
[1:32:37] because now we are in the holy ghost to
[1:32:40] finish this work you are in co-workers
[1:32:44] with god
[1:32:45] you are now being manifested you are the
[1:32:48] light though over there he said in the
[1:32:50] beginning the beginning was the word he
[1:32:53] said the word said what let there be one
[1:32:57] light is that right but the word was no
[1:32:59] longer just word now in the word it was
[1:33:02] what light
[1:33:03] you are now the light the light is
[1:33:06] drying you taking the word inside of you
[1:33:09] you are becoming the manifestation of
[1:33:12] the lord jesus christ son is that right
[1:33:15] a peculiar people they're looking at the
[1:33:18] way you dress up and looking at the way
[1:33:20] you talk guns they're looking at you
[1:33:22] they say there's something different
[1:33:24] about these people you have the royal
[1:33:26] blood saints
[1:33:29] you don't have to be looking to try to
[1:33:31] look like the world is that right
[1:33:33] he said i beseech you brother by the way
[1:33:37] mercies of god
[1:33:39] but be not conformed to this world
[1:33:42] but be transformed
[1:33:44] is that right for by the way by the
[1:33:46] renewing of your mind by the renewing of
[1:33:49] your spirit now in that spirit the holy
[1:33:51] spirit is now working on that inner man
[1:33:54] now he's going to leave and guide you
[1:33:57] see some just get there they got to they
[1:34:00] they got memory reasoning conscious
[1:34:02] affection those things they're moving in
[1:34:05] that spirit man and they think they're
[1:34:07] all right but god wants you to move down
[1:34:09] into the holiness of holy for you to
[1:34:12] live into the holiness of holy that's
[1:34:14] why you hear the pastor say are you up
[1:34:17] here have you caught up with the message
[1:34:19] when they was getting ready to go out of
[1:34:21] egypt when they was getting ready to
[1:34:23] leave out
[1:34:24] mo brother branham said he told him
[1:34:26] y'all got to keep up now you had to keep
[1:34:28] the message what was being unfold for
[1:34:30] that time because the death of angels is
[1:34:32] about to strike is that right when the
[1:34:34] death angel was about to strike him are
[1:34:37] you first born you ought to be rejoicing
[1:34:39] you ought to be shouting you ought to be
[1:34:41] praising the lord why because your
[1:34:44] father and your mother chose the rugged
[1:34:46] way is that right for that firstborn we
[1:34:50] always say if the firstborn is right i'm
[1:34:52] telling you you can get the rest of them
[1:34:54] in line but we have to understand the
[1:34:57] order of god what god has prepared for
[1:35:00] you and i is that right

[1:35:13] down there but look
[1:35:14] why some of them don't get it look what
[1:35:17] he told solomon he said now verse 11.
[1:35:20] look at verse 11 and the word of the
[1:35:22] lord came to solomon saying concerning
[1:35:25] this house which thou art in building if
[1:35:28] thou will walk in my wife statues
[1:35:32] and execute my judgments and keep my
[1:35:35] commandments to walk in them
[1:35:38] then will i perform my what my word with
[1:35:41] thee which i spake unto david thy father
[1:35:45] he got around in there now
[1:35:47] god telling you you've walked in it you
[1:35:50] got it you've been justified you've
