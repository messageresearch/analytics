[1:18] WHICH YOU SHALL obey to do in the land,
[1:22] which the Lord your God and thy father
[1:24] giveth thee to possess. All the days

[1:49] the baptism of the Holy Spirit,
[1:51] &gt;&gt; when you drink the water of refu
[1:55] pick up the sword to do what?
[1:59] &gt;&gt; You see now
[2:01] &gt;&gt; that's why Paul SAY I DIE DAILY
[2:03] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE HOLY SPIRIT, THE WHITE DOG
[2:06] IS DESTROYING EVERY DAY.
[2:08] &gt;&gt; HE'S getting territory.
[2:11] &gt;&gt; You use not to come in church, you begin
[2:12] to come in church. YOU USE NOT TO PRAY,
[2:15] YOU BEGIN TO PRAY. IT IS THE BLACK, IT
[2:17] IS THE WHITE DOG GAMING territory
[2:21] &gt;&gt; until the devil will turn loose and
[2:23] don't know what to do with you.
[2:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:29] &gt;&gt; AND YE SHALL UTTERLY DESTROY ALL THE
[2:32] PLACES WHEREIN THE nation which you
[2:35] shall possess serve the water
[2:38] &gt;&gt; upon the high mountain upon the hills
[2:41] and under every water.
[2:43] &gt;&gt; Brother David, I believe it's time for
[2:46] bazooka.
[2:48] I don't know. You tell me. I felt some
[2:50] echo. Echo means bazooka. We good?
[2:53] &gt;&gt; Okay, brother Mike, you know when to
[2:55] bring the bazooka. Okay. Thank you. Are
[2:58] you there? And ye said, "AND YE SHALL
[3:00] OVERTHROW THEIR ALTARS, and break THEIR
[3:04] PILLARS, AND BURN THEIR GROVES WITH
[3:06] WATER,
[3:08] &gt;&gt; and ye SHALL YOU DOWN THE graven image
[3:10] of their water,
[3:12] &gt;&gt; AND DESTROY THE NAME OF THEM OUT OF
[3:14] WATER.
[3:15] &gt;&gt; I don't want anything that have the
[3:18] memory of the Gentile in the promised
[3:21] land. Clean up everything
[3:24] &gt;&gt; because it's against me.
[3:27] YE SHALL NOT DO SO UNTO THE what
[3:31] &gt;&gt; the way you treat the God of the hidden
[3:34] &gt;&gt; you don't treat me like that
[3:36] &gt;&gt; it's if it's my temple you be careful
[3:40] &gt;&gt; you follow me
[3:42] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[3:44] &gt;&gt; take heed to yourself THAT YOU BE NOT
[3:48] snare by following after them after that
[3:52] they have been destroyed from before
[3:55] thee and that door inquire after their
[3:58] God, saying, "How did what?"
[4:02] &gt;&gt; Serve the what?
[4:05] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU GET TO THE promised land AND
[4:08] WHEN YOU DESTROY THE GOD, YOU DESTROY
[4:11] THE ALTAR, YOU DESTROY EVERYTHING, never
[4:15] stop one time. Follow me carefully and
[4:18] begin to ask yourself a question. How
[4:22] did this nation worship their God? In
[4:26] other word, what method did they use to
[4:29] worship their God? How was their
[4:31] lifestyle of worshiping the Lord, their
[4:34] God? If they were worshiping their God
[4:37] doing this, then I'm going to also do
[4:39] this to Jehovah.
[4:42] &gt;&gt; Let me read it back again. So, it's
[4:44] going to hit you.
[4:46] &gt;&gt; HOW DID THIS NATION serve their God?
[4:49] EVEN SO, WITHOUT WHAT? In other word,
[4:53] you want to TAKE THE WORSHIP of the
[4:55] hidden
[4:57] &gt;&gt; AND BRING THEM to God.
[5:02] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE ROOT OF CATHOLICISM.
[5:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[5:08] &gt;&gt; CATHOLICISM TOOK THE ROMAN TRADITION AND
[5:13] PUT THAT IN THE CHURCH.
[5:16] AND GOD SAY DON'T TAKE THE STUFF OF THE
[5:19] EDEN AND MIX IT WITH MY WORSHIP.
[5:25] &gt;&gt; I AM DELIVERING YOU OUT OF BABYLON, OUT
[5:29] OF DENOMINATION,
[5:31] OUT OF PENTECOST, OUT OF BAPTIST, OUT OF
[5:34] METHODIST. DON'T BRING THE IDEA WHERE
[5:37] YOU COMING TO WORSHIP ME.
[5:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[5:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[5:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Thou shall not do so unto the who?
[5:47] The Lord thy God. For every abomination
[5:50] to the Lord which he hateth have they
[5:53] done unto the what?
[5:55] &gt;&gt; What you think was a worship is an
[5:58] abomination. I don't want YOU TO USE
[6:01] THAT style to come and worship me.
[6:04] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me?
[6:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you get to my temple, DON'T
[6:08] WORSHIP ME LIKE he
[6:12] &gt;&gt; are you there?
[6:13] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus say even when you pray
[6:17] &gt;&gt; don't multiply what
[6:20] &gt;&gt; word
[6:20] &gt;&gt; vain word like the who
[6:23] &gt;&gt; because they think by much repetition
[6:26] they shall be
[6:28] &gt;&gt; even in your way of praying. I want you
[6:30] to be different than the gentile.
[6:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:35] That's beautiful.
[6:37] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU THERE?
[6:39] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WE ARE AGAINST CHRISTMAS.
[6:49] &gt;&gt; Do you want to go home?
[6:51] &gt;&gt; Do you want to go home?
[6:53] &gt;&gt; Do you want to plug in?
[6:56] &gt;&gt; You ready?
[6:57] &gt;&gt; We were never taught about Christmas.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; Put your seat belt. Amen.
[7:02] &gt;&gt; Are you there?
[7:04] &gt;&gt; Why is Christmas wrong?
[7:06] &gt;&gt; Why?
[7:07] &gt;&gt; We come in a message church 25 years we
[7:10] were not told so and you battling with
[7:13] young people. They want to do it. They
[7:14] don't know. Nobody sat down to tell them
[7:17] why it's wrong. It is what? Why do you
[7:20] reject it? What is wrong with it?
[7:25] &gt;&gt; Let's the Bible talk.
[7:27] &gt;&gt; Not brother Steven.
[7:30] JEREMIAH 10 VERSE1. I wish brother
[7:33] Robert was there.
[7:36] Hallelujah. HEAR YE THE WORD WHICH THE
[7:39] LORD SPEAK UNTO YOU, OH HOUSE OF WHAT?
[7:43] &gt;&gt; How many people are the spiritual Israel
[7:45] of God? Let me see your hand.
[7:48] &gt;&gt; Let me see your hand.
[7:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[7:51] &gt;&gt; THUS SAY THE LORD, LEARN NOT THE WAY OF
[7:55] THE WORD.
[7:57] WHAT HAVE I PREACHED from sun from
[7:59] Wednesday up to today?
[8:03] &gt;&gt; Learn not THE WAY OF THE hidden
[8:07] &gt;&gt; uncircumcised
[8:09] gentile pagan unbelievers. What is the
[8:13] way of the hidden?
[8:15] &gt;&gt; Can you explain me more Jeremiah?
[8:18] AND BE NOT DISMAY AT THE SON OF HEAVEN
[8:22] FOR THE WHAT?
[8:24] I DISMAYED THEM
[8:26] &gt;&gt; FOR THE CUSTOM OF THE PEOPLE ARE WHAT?
[8:31] &gt;&gt; Vanity of their mind.
[8:34] &gt;&gt; Are you there?
[8:35] &gt;&gt; What are they hidden doing? FOR ONE CUT
[8:40] A WHAT?
[8:41] &gt;&gt; A TREE OUT OF WHAT?
[8:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[8:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:47] &gt;&gt; COME ON. THEY WORK OFF THE HAND OF WHAT?
[8:50] People
[8:51] go cut a tree by the work of a man and
[8:55] bring that tree home and put it. Who was
[8:58] DOING THAT ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE?
[9:02] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you a question. Is brother
[9:05] Brham against Christmas or it is the
[9:10] word who is against Christmas?
[9:15] &gt;&gt; It is not brother Brham
[9:17] &gt;&gt; who's against mixed marriage. It is the
[9:19] word.
[9:20] &gt;&gt; It is not brother Brandham who's against
[9:22] Christmas. Oh, this message people they
[9:25] against Christmas. You miss keys. There
[9:28] are certain keys you must have to
[9:30] navigate in the message.
[9:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:35] &gt;&gt; You miss key. If you just get hiddenis,
[9:38] you going to navigate over everything in
[9:40] the message.
[9:41] &gt;&gt; It is not a law from brother Bra.
[9:44] &gt;&gt; Are you there? FOR THE CUSTOM OF THE
[9:46] PEOPLE ARE VAIN. ONE CUTTH a tree out of
[9:49] the forest and work the hand of a
[9:52] workman WITH THE AXE. THEY DO WHAT?
[9:57] &gt;&gt; They decorate.
[9:58] &gt;&gt; THEY DECORATE THE TREE WITH WHAT?
[10:02] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT?
[10:03] &gt;&gt; WHO DO THAT?
[10:09] &gt;&gt; IS IT A LAW AGAINST CHRISTMAS?
[10:15] &gt;&gt; Is it a law?
[10:18] The Bible says
[10:22] &gt;&gt; AND DECORATED IT WITH SILVER AND GOLD.
[10:25] THEY FASTENED IT WITH WHAT
[10:28] &gt;&gt; they put the tree and they hold it so
[10:31] the tree can stay like that because they
[10:32] cut it from the forest. He then were
[10:35] doing that.
[10:36] &gt;&gt; Are you there? And with hammer that he
[10:40] move
[10:41] &gt;&gt; because if you leave that tree it's
[10:42] going to fall.
[10:44] &gt;&gt; Are you there? THEY ARE UPRIGHT AS THE
[10:47] PALM TREE, but they speak not. THEY MUST
[10:50] NEED TO BE WHAT? You are the one
[10:53] carrying your Christmas tree.
[10:55] &gt;&gt; He cannot walk hidden.
[11:00] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY CANNOT WATER.
[11:02] &gt;&gt; That's why Christmas is wrong.
[11:06] &gt;&gt; It is not wrong because it's a law. It
[11:10] is not wrong because it's praam. It is
[11:13] wrong because it's a hiddenism which is
[11:16] against the word of God.
[11:19] &gt;&gt; Are you there?
[11:21] &gt;&gt; Stop getting picture with the Christmas
[11:23] tree.
[11:27] &gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT BEFORE. From today
[11:30] you know it.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; DON'T BE POSTING CHRISTMAS STUFF.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; You are worshiping the devil without
[11:39] knowing it.
[11:41] Amen.
[11:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; You are worshiping Satan.
[11:46] &gt;&gt; Thinking you Christian
[11:48] &gt;&gt; because Satan knows how to play with
[11:51] Satan knows how to play with beauty.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; I don't believe Christian, but I'm just
[11:56] taking a picture because he looks
[11:58] beautiful. You identifying yourself with
[12:01] a hidden.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; Can you take a picture with a beer?
[12:04] &gt;&gt; Can you take a picture with a cigarette?
[12:07] &gt;&gt; Why you taking a picture with a
[12:08] Christmas tree?
[12:13] Why?
[12:14] &gt;&gt; Why?
[12:16] &gt;&gt; Why?
[12:18] &gt;&gt; Do you see? YES,
[12:20] &gt;&gt; BROTHER. AND SO DID THE SECOND EVE MET
[12:24] HER and nine, giving it to a
[12:26] denomination creed, ACCEPTED DOGMA
[12:29] INSTEAD of word the word. TAKEN DOWN
[12:32] PAGAN ado like Jupiter and so forth. Put
[12:36] up Paul and Barnabas. TOOK DOWN THE SUN
[12:39] GOD AND the moon god, asteroid the moon
[12:42] god with one kosher and made her being
[12:46] the mother of the son god which is
[12:47] Jupiter and changed the birth day of
[12:50] Jesus Christ from what?
[12:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus was born in April.
[12:57] &gt;&gt; THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH REMOVED THAT
[12:59] DATE AND PUT IT IN DECEMBER WHERE THEY
[13:02] WORSHIP THE SUN GOD
[13:05] &gt;&gt; UNDER A HIDDEN TREE.
[13:08] And Christian message believer are
[13:11] swallowing it.
[13:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:18] &gt;&gt; And they put a baby born
[13:21] &gt;&gt; with the magazine
[13:24] BECAUSE THE MAJOR SAW JESUS CHRIST AT 2
[13:27] YEARS OLD. THAT'S WHY AHORD SAY KILL THE
[13:31] CHILDREN 2 YEARS OLD DOWN. YES SIR.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; YOU TAKE THE MAJOR and the baby. It's a
[13:36] lie.
[13:38] The tree is hidden.
[13:41] &gt;&gt; Spoken word tabernacle.
[13:43] &gt;&gt; Stop this nonsense.
[13:47] &gt;&gt; AND EVERY ONE OF US PLAY SANTA CLAUS and
[13:51] decorate the trees a
[13:55] &gt;&gt; now you understand brother Brandham
[13:57] &gt;&gt; after I show you tens of scriptures.
[14:01] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham say go home
[14:03] and study
[14:05] &gt;&gt; catch the man of the prophet. Amen.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; He's against what?
[14:08] &gt;&gt; Hiddenism.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:11] &gt;&gt; It's not that he doesn't want you to get
[14:12] present.
[14:14] &gt;&gt; It is you don't understand the devil is
[14:16] shrewd.
[14:18] &gt;&gt; HIDDENISM AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND THEN
[14:21] CALL YOURSELF WHAT?
[14:23] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S the matter with Christian church?
[14:27] &gt;&gt; God pull you out of hidden. And here you
[14:30] go back to them. THE WOMEN BUYING THEIR
[14:33] WATER.
[14:37] WHAT HAS THIS COME TO
[14:39] &gt;&gt; my how I can understand where a WHAT
[14:44] &gt;&gt; HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE WHAT
[14:47] &gt;&gt; IS BROTHER BRHAM AGAINST Easter
[14:50] brother Brham last Sunday says that it's
[14:54] the best of all the days but what
[14:57] brother Brham is pointing against you it
[15:00] is not Easter he's pointing you about
[15:04] the beans and stuff they added in water.
[15:08] &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with brother
[15:09] Charles. He's going to pick up his wife.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; So chill out.
[15:15] &gt;&gt; Are you there?
[15:17] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU THERE? SO BROTHER BRHAM IS NOT
[15:19] AGAINST EASTER. BUT BROTHER BRHAM enter
[15:23] Easter. He say EASTER THE DATE IS
[15:26] CORRECT. THE MONTH IS CORRECT. It's
[15:28] about the resurrection. But my people, I
[15:32] want to warn you about hiddenenness.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; They put a rabbit, they put eggs, THOSE
[15:38] STUFF HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE
[15:42] SCRIPTURE.
[15:46] &gt;&gt; Why a rabbit is start from Germany.
[15:51] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE LUTHERAN CHURCH
[15:54] &gt;&gt; THAT START THE RABBIT.
[15:57] &gt;&gt; THEY CAME OUT FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.
[16:00] AND THEY KILL SANTA. AND THE DEVIL
[16:03] BROUGHT THE RABBIT WHO'S BRINGING GIFT
[16:05] to the kids. He he changes Santa clo to
[16:08] the rabbit.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; You see?
[16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; What is the logo of the playboy?
[16:19] &gt;&gt; What is the logo of the pornography
[16:22] channel and the pornography magazine?
[16:24] What is the logo?
[16:25] &gt;&gt; A RABBIT. GLORY to
[16:27] &gt;&gt; A rabbit. Yes sir. Yes sir.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; Go Google. Don't enter there.
[16:33] &gt;&gt; The logo of pornography channel and
[16:36] pornography magazine. Their logo is a
[16:39] rabbit.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; Why a rabbit? Sexually inclined beast
[16:45] &gt;&gt; and that's what they bring and couple
[16:47] that in history
[16:49] &gt;&gt; and message believers swallow it.
[16:54] &gt;&gt; RABBIT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE
[16:56] RESURRECTION. HOW A CHRISTMAS TREE HAS
[16:59] ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE BIRTH OF CHRIST?
[17:01] IT IS what
[17:04] &gt;&gt; my friend, we are got off the path
[17:07] somewhere. But now a real bornagain man
[17:11] or woman realizes because there is life
[17:15] within you tell you what is water.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; He's not against that Easter. He's
[17:22] against the paganism they brought in
[17:25] Easter. But but Christmas the date the
[17:29] time and everything is wrong. Easter the
[17:32] date is correct. It's the paganism that
[17:34] brother Brham is removing
[17:36] &gt;&gt; worship Easter correct with it but
[17:40] remove the paganism.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; Are you there? You don't go happy Easter
[17:45] and you are putting all kind of picture
[17:48] is the what what does the resurrection
[17:51] of Jesus Christ have to do with your
[17:52] faith?
[17:57] When people see your face, they see the
[17:59] resurrection.
[18:03] &gt;&gt; That is good. But even there they have
[18:06] no idea how to approach God and how to
[18:09] worship God. Jesus say that the true
[18:12] worship was in spirit and in what?
[18:14] &gt;&gt; True.
[18:15] &gt;&gt; I'm going to stop somewhere here. I
[18:17] won't go through the through your high
[18:19] heel. I let you soak this throughout the
[18:21] week and then when you come back we're
[18:23] going to put up a chart and you're going
[18:24] to see it. ARE YOU THERE? BUT WHAT KIND
[18:27] OF WORSHIP CAN YOU GET IN THE CHURCH
[18:30] that knows solely of God and put up a
[18:33] Santa clothes at Christmas and bunnies
[18:36] at Easter? Where did they get that? They
[18:39] got it from the water.
[18:42] &gt;&gt; The water
[18:44] &gt;&gt; and made it a part of the water. church.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; Why God told you don't look at the ways
[18:49] of worshiping and worship me like that?
[18:53] &gt;&gt; Are you there?
[18:55] &gt;&gt; But when one turns to the Lord and is
[18:58] filled with what?
[19:00] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost. Brother Kelly, he sees
[19:02] from what?
[19:05] &gt;&gt; Get the Holy Ghost. And when Joshua
[19:08] come, he's cutting your Christmas and
[19:10] your Easter bunnies.
[19:13] &gt;&gt; Are you there?
[19:15] Such thing he has rest in his soul. He
[19:19] really begin to live and love God and
[19:21] worship who
[19:23] &gt;&gt; want to stop. Why brother? That's pagan.
[19:27] God never had an altar for Easter
[19:29] flowers. That is what who
[19:35] &gt;&gt; you see
[19:36] &gt;&gt; no more flowers.
[19:38] &gt;&gt; Are you there?
[19:40] THE WORLD HAS GOT EVEN EASTER,
[19:43] CHRISTMAS, and everything else
[19:46] trickorreat
[19:48] until it gets you to Halloween where you
[19:51] are actually worshiping devils
[19:55] &gt;&gt; and Christian trickorreat.
[20:00] &gt;&gt; Where did God told you to worship the
[20:02] dead?
[20:05] &gt;&gt; Why do you seek among the dead? Who is
[20:07] what?
[20:09] Amen.
[20:11] &gt;&gt; Are you there? CHRISTMAS A GREAT OF
[20:15] COMMERCIAL. NOTHING about God in it.
[20:18] What in the world this Easter got to do
[20:19] with a rabbit or a chicken or a yellow
[20:23] duck or something? We are just as what?
[20:26] &gt;&gt; As the what?
[20:28] &gt;&gt; And now even what
[20:30] &gt;&gt; western day off in
[20:32] &gt;&gt; Africa.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; And yet you put up with it. God help us
[20:39] to shine those things as the sunlight of
[20:43] God begin to bathe down and expose those
[20:46] things. Let's walk in the water.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; As you got the teaching on that, now you
[20:51] understand.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; Walk in the newness of life that God has
[20:56] showed you. Are you there?
[20:58] &gt;&gt; Let me skip this and I'm going to
[21:00] conclude with this
[21:03] trinity. THEY don't believe there is
[21:06] three God. That is what
[21:09] &gt;&gt; do you see? GOD THE FATHER, GOD THE SON,
[21:13] GOD THE HOLY GHOST. NOW ABSOLUTELY THERE
[21:15] IS NO SUCH A THING. IT'S NOT THREE GOD
[21:17] THAT IS WHAT
[21:19] &gt;&gt; even in your deity
[21:21] &gt;&gt; it's coming from he are you there?
[21:24] &gt;&gt; Present your body a living sacrifice
[21:28] holy and acceptable unto God and his
[21:31] reasonable service. Be not conformed to
[21:33] this world, but be you transformed by
[21:36] the renewing of your mind, that you may
[21:39] prove what is what
[21:41] &gt;&gt; and acceptable and what?
[21:44] &gt;&gt; Perfect will of who?
[21:46] &gt;&gt; We are not preaching you the law. We are
[21:49] not putting you onto a law. We're not
[21:52] doing that. We are just presenting you
[21:54] the word of the living God. Let's stand.
[21:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
