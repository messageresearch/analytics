sister CA God bless you good to see you again amen you might be seated a little bit as we going through our routine my checklist that's why I say check amen amen glory to God I believe we up to date with the sermon and we're reading our Bible twice a day according to the recommendation of the Prophet we're reading our Cod our church ages 70 weeks of Daniel the seals adoption or somebody is listening or going to sleep with the message of the hour amen when I when I'm in the last time before I go to bed all I do not all the time is just cut on the tape and stay there and begin to listen and before you know it I'm sleeping but at least I cut 30 40 or 20 minutes whatever I catch I'm already gone with it amen when I wake up in the morning or when I wake up in the middle of the night that voice is ringing that I know okay something is going on Amen if you don't love the voice of the Prophet something is wrong because at the voice of the seven Angel H when he shall begin to sound then all the mysteries of God should be revealed amen ah even your tape was created for that [Applause] you need to swallow this type of things because what is coming up might be too strong to swallow so just get some appetizer and say amen amen amen glory to God amen amen Lord's willing the young Sisters Meeting will be on February the 22nd the merried coule meeting is on March the 22 so 22nd 22nd Lord's willing and the young men meeting the next one one was pushing harder to get one quickly so if you can work it out brother Enoch you can work with the Deacon and see when we can do it and then we will pick up again on finances and the reason why I'm lingering with them like I told them yesterday I say you are men you are patriarch you are not women uh women I'm going with them a different direction but you are man you are going to be the head of the household and the sister are looking for true head amen so I'm tightening up with the man so please parent do not Len up I don't know if you get me very well in other word when I'm giving instruction to these children all my instruction are coming from the Bible and the message of the hour amen so when I tighten it don't lose in a home I told them and I and I and I dealt with a principle of the souls yesterday and I gave them I told them I'm going to tell you this for the rest of your life and I dealt with the principle of the souls about our own identification amen because God when he creat you the true you God put it in your soul are we together and your soul is wired by God to establish your true identity are we together that's why we should always speak from our heart that's it it I I don't know if we together when you speak don't speak from your head the head is a hypocrite the head is a compromiser always speak from your heart and I told them if you love the color red tell your friend I like red and you need to also let your friend tell you are like blue so if both of you know exactly what each other like like you will create a Baer Zone where each each person is respected but I do not believe in young man joking all the time am don't say amen amen I told them I do not believe the last one I mean the the the youngest one was 13 years old yesterday it was a I mean I mean a group of them the youngest one was 13 and I told them I say Jesus was a 12 years old not 13 where did they find him with his peers with the people of his age they find him where with who they were of his age or above his age so I don't want any young man in this church to be a player father do you understand me Mama do you understand me young men should dress like men cut your hair correctly groom yourself correctly talk like a man behave like a man I do not believe in young men meeting and then just joking joking joking I told them when you meet among other young men from other churches cool down sit down and talk like a door you say this is what I find in life and this one say oh I learned something and this one said not young men because what we mean young men in the message it means just joking jumping and playing and tomorrow you going to marry someone no one the sister says no amen because you still [Applause] immature if you get in my class from 13 you no longer a baby even if he's 13 years old when I tighten him up leave him the way I'm tightening him upen amen are we together amen men should behave like men amen [Applause] if other people are doing in your church that's their own foolishness not him spoken word right here I want to see young men on fire for God if they preach the gospel on fire tomorrow you're going to be a trustee you're going to be a deacon you're going to be a preacher you're going to be a song leader you're going to be somebody so when are you going to stop playing games yes sir young man jumping jumping jumping jumping no I say establish your boundaries amen amen when somebody cast you look at him you say I don't like that either he stick with you or he can find somebody else amen are we together amen are we together never compromise somebody's cursing and you're laughing you are actually destroying your true identity and later on in life you going to have an internal War because your soul never had a a place to express itself you always chasing after people's approval you want to be seen by people you want to be the big shot you want everybody to clap for you even Jesus didn't have that amen if you want to know what I talk with them the Deon are there amen they can give you the tape because I'm not as shame of whatever if not a tape because you're going to give it to somebody else we can even create a zoom link and give it to you and you listen to what I'm telling them amen so me and the parent we say together amen I want men in this message I'm tired of what I see in the message I'm tired on what I see on Facebook on WhatsApp crazy stupid [Applause] stuff under the name of young [Applause] people young people going to I mean Holocaust and screaming woooo wooo what is that that's right you should be thinking about your future get focused I gave them the scripture Joseph 17 years old he left his parent home I gave them the scripture yesterday at 17 years old Joseph left his parent no parent in Egypt no mother in Egypt no father no brother in Egypt and he only took him 13 years age 30 he was the vice president how old

God you know what he means everybody in their position amen Leviticus 4 verse one and the Lord spoke to Moses saying what speak unto the children of Israel continue my friends saying uh-huh if a soul shall sin through ignorance uhhuh against any of The Commandments of the Lord continue concerning things which ought not to be done and shall do against any of them uh-huh if the priest that is Anointed do sin according to the sin of the people uhhuh then let him bring for his sin which he hath sned a young bulock without blemish unto the Lord for a sin offering it's a bulock for a sin offering we clear jum to verse four and he shall bring the bulock unto the door of the Tabernacle of congregation before the Lord and shall lay his hand upon the Bullock's head and kill the bulock

killed the blood is recuperated when they pick up the blood the blood is applied simultaneously in three area amen and remember where the blood is or where the blood goes that's where the problem is because the blood is going to atone or to remove what is bad over there if the blood struck the veil there is something wrong with the veil if the blood struck the Horn of the altar something is wrong in the altar if it goes to the bottom of the Brazen altar something is wrong there because the blood is the Clorox it chases where wrong is in order to bring atonement and to remove everything thing
