God bless you this evening it's a real privilege of mine to be with you again in fellowship tonight and and uh to be a part of this service I my heart rate always goes up when I get a text or a call from Brother Stephen and then I realize I better start drinking more water and getting prepared so we thank the Lord you know he promised where two or three would together in his name that he would come and and meet with us amen and so we thank the the Lord for that and I I definitely believe when you come in expectation sir that's Faith operating and God honors Faith amen so greet you tonight my wife wasn't able to come with me so send greetings to you from her and also from our pastor brother Josh Bennett the Believers at Apostolic Tabernacle and I think in the near future it may work out for brother Steven to come over and return the favor and minister at Apostolic Tabernacle and I'm hoping uh you all come with him amen and so we'll just have a wonderful worship together and feast around the table of the Lord amen so let's see what the Lord will do there but uh I want to invite you to turn in your Bibles to St John chapter 14 and um we want to take a few verses of scripture here and also in Revelations uh chapter 21 and we'll take a few verses there I was just returned um over the turn of the year I went to India for two weeks I've never been to the country of India before and um it was a a good visit a good trip the Lord blessed and we were there for about 10 days and I don't know six or eight Services something like that but the very first service uh that I ministered uh um I at the end of the service made an offer if anyone would desire prayer they could come forward well everybody came all the sisters came and then all the brothers came and we were there with uh there were probably 10 or so ministers also and we just formed a line and everyone was prayed for and uh that was on Thursday January 2nd and about a week and a half later on Sunday was the final service and just before I came to the pulpit to minister a sister gave testimony that uh almost a year ago she had had a gallbladder removal had a surgery and had had complications after that surgery with eating digesting the food sleeping numerous things and um in she came through that prayer line that Thursday and God touched her all of that left her all of the symptoms and uh so amen God is still God he's on the throne and that's never going to change and he's still healing he's still saving he's still delivering and uh he he'll never have uh a closed side on his business amen he's he's always open his ear is always open to the Cry of his children and he loves to prove himself amen so we thank God that we know him in that way this evening and we are depending on him to come we can read these words but only he can reveal these words and take them from these pages and make them a reality in our lives so let's approach him in prayer just before we read his word this evening Lord Jesus it is truly a privilege and an honor to be gathered again and we realize Lord tonight there are many present and some Lord may be listening in watching in now or even later and we're just asking you Lord to come now and move in such a way our faith Lord would be lifted our doubts would dissolve and you would have such a preeminence Lord that they would see past the veil of a man or the voice of a man and Lord to hear you speaking and ministering to the needs of your children we ask you lord to bless the reading of your word and guide Lord what I would say or do that you may have the preeminence Lord and be glorified in it we thank you for it father come now and feed our hungry Souls we ask in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen Jesus says here in St John 14 it's often a funeral text but um we'll read here tonight let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many men ANS if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you amen amen amen and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also that's right and whether I go you know and the way you know yes also Revelation chap 21 we want to read uh verses 9 down through verse 11 I'm going to read it the way I want to read it then I'm going to read it the way King James interpreted it is that okay and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had preached the seven vows which had preached the future home which had preached the revelations contained within the seals amen there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vows full of the last seven plagues and talked with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a grave and high mountain and showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven yes sir from God may the Lord bless the reading of his word as you're seated tonight I want to title this Mount Zion the city of God Amen realizing that a city is a Dwelling Place a city is a habitation amen if I ask you tonight where you were from uh where is your home you would probably name the town the city the community where you reside where at the end of the day of work or the end of the vacation or the end of visit that's where you call home amen and so we I want to begin tonight by uh relaying or reminding you of something that happened in the Old Testament yes in the ministry of God's Prophet Moses yes God had raised up Moses Amen to be a Ministry of Deliverance that's right to bring the faith of the people of Israel uh to restore a faith amen and a promise of God that was given to them yes sir hundreds of years before God had told Abraham thy seed shall sojourn in a Strange Land and after 400 years I will deliver them out with the mighty hand so Moses Ministry amen was to lift the faith of of the people that's right to restore them to the understanding of who they were that they were not Egyptians they were not slaves and Egypt wasn't final and any of those things and so begin to call them out and I think it's so amazing that when God you know God first had to convince Moses he first had to get Moses to realize who he was after failing uh to be a leader and deliver and all those things so he takes Moses up and he meets him in a burning bush but um he said this shall be a sign unto you Moses when you have done this when I've performed this you're going to bring Israel up and they too yes sir will experience me they will worship me they will meet me yes sir in this same place now I'm paraphrasing how God gave Moses that instruction but I I can tell by your response I'm not telling you something you don't know so I I think that this is something because there were going to be many Supernatural signs that accompany this ministry right mean there would be the sign in the hand there would be the the the the see the hearts deser the the the pools and those signs that accompany that there would be plagues there would be the control over natural but but the Vindication yes the Vindication that God gave to Moses that would be the proof that his ministry was successful was that a people would come out of Egypt come out of that bondage come across the Red Sea and eventually come to know God the same way the prophet [Music] did that's the real proof and you see all those signs and wonders never made Believers out of Egyptians amen those those signs came they were displayed Pharaoh died all the Egyptians perished the armies perished amen but God brought a Joshua God brought a Caleb amen God brought individual Amen to meet the god of the prophet and that was the proof that was the real proof so the same is true today we can look at the things God did some uh decades ago 50 60 years ago and they're all true Everything God did through William bram's Ministry is true it it will stand the test of time amen but those things really aren't the proof a picture on the wall isn't the proof am me a testimony isn't the proof am me something in the Library of Congress isn't the proof the Vindication is your life having met God in the same way amen that's the proof amen so along this journey God one day calls Moses up into the mountain and there's a pattern that God is establishing here that he's going to use for the rest of time and he calls Moses up and Moses is CAU up into the cloud amen he he's he's he's up there and the and the congregation doesn't really understand what's taking place but while he is there God is showing him a vision and God is showing him a tabernacle amen and the the outer Court the inner Court the holiest of holies and all of those things and and God is showing them a very elaborate Temple and curtains and and and Furniture in the Tabernacle gold silver brass fine linen all of these things and God is showing Moses this great pattern and then God's telling Moses Moses I want this I'm I'm not even happy I'm not even satisfied with this in the Heavenly realm I want this to become a reality down there on the earth and I'm just trying to imagine what might have gone through moses' mind when he begins to see this you know I know if it were me I'd be saying God I can't do that I can't build that and you can tell me the dimensions and you can tell me the material you can give me all the specifics but I'm not a builder I'm not a carpenter I don't know how to work with gold and brass and silver and all those things I I I I'm it's beyond my ability Amen to do all of those things but see this is what I love about it God was using the ministry of a prophet to be a link Amen to relay what was in the mind of God and to bring it from a supernatural sphere or a Heavenly Place Amen to bring the message to bring the message of the pattern Amen to give them the the the the dimensions the layout to tell them the vision and God knew amen through that prophet's Ministry when he begins to express what he's experienced up there on that mountain there's going to be people within the congregation of Israel amen that are going to have faith that are going to recognize and they're not just going to agree with it no sir they're not just going to say well Moses I'm I'm really I really do believe that happened to you I really believe that in all that time you were gone from us God really did those things and my Moses what a what what a blueprint what a draw it's beautiful man I just can't wait you know no there were people there yes that as soon as they heard this message it quickened them it activated them it put them in the motion and and the thing the thing I love about this is these people had just come out of the greatest nation in the world at that time had I mean all the riches of the world gold silver brass these people as slaves were building treasur cities to Pharaoh right but under Egyptian rule sir and under Egyptian Dominion they could barely stomp out good mud bricks that was the limitation of their skill that was a limitation of their ability with all of those resources amen there of mud brick was all they could pred day after day after day in a in a land with everything at their fingertips so God takes that same people across the Red Sea Under This failure of a deliverer you know as far as Egypt was concerned and they get out in a baren desert Wilderness where there's nothing I mean the only thing that was there was what they might have carried with them or what God was providing and there Moses comes down from the mountain with this pattern and and those people with nothing began to build what was in God's [Applause] mind I love this Exodus 311 and the Lord spake un to Moses saying this might have been his answer to Moses question Lord this is wonderful but how is this going to be I didn't study carpentry I studied how to lead a military I studied math and I studied uh uh how do I say it um you know H how to send a a a a a missile to the Moon I didn't study how to build sacred Furniture amen you see friends there comes a time when the message is not just about the messenger the message isn't even about the figures or the people God used but the message is a Ministry because God is Desiring to do something in the earth to reestablish amen what was um what was sidetracked in his first Eden God is going to establish his Eden his kingdom right here in the earth and the Lord spake unto Moses saying see I have called by name bezel the son of Uriah the son of her of the tribe of Judah that's right and I have filled him with the spirit of God in wisdom and in understanding and in knowledge and in all manner of workmanship to devise cunning Works to work in gold and in silver and in brass and in cutting of stones to set them and in carving of Timber to work in all manner of workmanship yes and behold I have given with him a holy of the son of ahmic of the tri of De in the and in the hearts of all that are wise-hearted I sir see the message is predestinated and the Believers of the message are predestinated these people were probably 30 40 50 60 old years old but they had been dormant until the message they had been under denominational rule they had been under control they had been in bondage amen and and and and and the world just looked at them as second class citizens less than people less than humans but now the mind of God the will of God the desire of God is being realized amen and those same people that the world deemed to be failures you see the message message will not fall on deaf ears but the message is not for unbelievers it's for a targeted group you're a targeted group you're you're an elect lady he that hath an ear to hear Let Him hear what the spirit saith to the churches and see the hearing of it is not just the sound of it falling on your ears but it's actually the motion the dynamic amen the the action of your life gives witness to the [Applause] message they became the message the Tabernacle was not a drawing was not a one-dimensional picture the Tabernacle was a place a tangible place for God to come and dwell his place of habitation and that Tabernacle was going to be built and constructed by people by men and by women collaborating together that's why the message lives today is because it's not books it's not tapes it's not Memories it's not a man but it is act actually the mind of God which is eternal which is Invincible which is infallible that mind is being expressed and as those thoughts amen are spoken there's an answer there's an echo from people amen [Applause] amen so Moses simply shared the vision and he didn't have to whip anybody he didn't have to beg anybody he didn't have to pay anybody he didn't have to coers anybody he just preached the [Applause] [Music] message and I believe brother shimbo as he began to describe the dimensions you know if there was an unbeliever there i' say well that sounds that sounds pretty legalistic you mean it's got to be so tall it's got to be so wide it's got to be so long what gives him the right to tell us that who does he think he is anyway he ain't a carpenter he's not an architect he's not an engineer see that's how unbelief reacts but at the same time someone sitting on the seat right next to them began seeing the vision and actually saw in Greater detail perhaps than even what was being laid out by the prophet he know what said I can do that I've been waiting to hear that all my life I've been longing for an outlet you see the predestinated message is coming to a predestinated people and to them it's not works it's not lab laborious it's not a problem it's not a burden it's not rules it's not regulations they said I can do that I can I know I know exactly what that labor is going to look like you know what I'm going to build that labor I'm going to form it what do you mean you're going to form you never work with brass in your life but the ability the potential has been lying there all along and when I heard this message I heard my IDE identity I heard who I was all along amen and it released it released it's not bondage it's a liberty to release the potential that God had in you all along amen if you want to talk about bondage bondage is anything else bondage is anything less I found Freedom what you calling bondage amen what you what the world costs freedom to me is bondage amen I have found freedom I have found what unlocked was lying there the entire time amen [Applause] amen and then there's nonbeliever sitting there say well if it happens all the prophet's going to have to do it the only way I'm going to worship at a brass altar is if I know the prophet did it and the prop it is the exact same Spirit it cannot enter in because there's nothing within that person to be the am man to be the Fulfillment and so they're putting it off that's right on someone else and say well if he can do it or she can do it or if if if the prophet will just come back and rise and and all the other thing you know I if my threshold of unbelief can be friend you're never going to believe if what God has done by now doesn't make you a Believer he can do nothing more to make you a Believer right amen I've said it before and it's crude but if you were waiting on raindrops to hit you in the face to vindicate that Noah's message was thus sayith the Lord you were waiting too late you had to believe it came from God get into the ark and be sealed in 8 Days Later the rain [Applause] fell amen praise the Lord prise that's the difference between belief and unbelief so God give God gave the vision to the prophet yes sir but just just it involved a people that's right it involved a mountain it involved a cloud it involved a prophet and it involved a promise all of those elements were in that amen oh my now I'm lost praise the Lord hallu may the Lord help us glory to God hallelujah a habitation a dwelling place for God's glory to be expressed in the Earth this this happened again one day Jesus calls Peter James and John a prophet up on the mountain with witnesses there believers and Jesus was transfigured he was glorified before them amen Days Later he's praying and he says father glorify thy name St John 12 and there came a voice from Heaven saying I have both glorified it past tense and will glorify it again the people that stood by heard it said that it thundered and others said an angel spake to him and Jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me but for your sakes a pattern was being shown to Peter James and John and only days later after his Ascension they gathered in the upper room in obedience to his commandment Jesus told them Terry ye in Jerusalem the city until you be endued with power from on high these men had cast out Devils they had healed the sick they had manifested a Supernatural Ministry of Jesus Christ but but they weren't satisfied working off of a borrowed anointing [Applause] they could not effectively continue and actually the potential that was already in them that was recognized by hearing Jesus voice that was still a potential that's right but the potential took them to the upper room and on the day of Pentecost The Same Spirit that was in Jesus Christ came back into those 120 Believers gathered there in the upper room and that became the habitation or the Tabernacle or the glory of God Amen manifested now not in one son but in a many membered body born in sin shaped in iniquity but now having experienced a new birth amen then they began to go forth expressing Jesus Christ amen so many things I could say there but amen God revealing his glory amen Daniel chapter 2 Daniel 2 beginning at verse 34 I'll just start at verse vers 31 thou O King now Daniel is giving the king the interpretation of his dream thou oh King sawest and behold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible the image's head was of fine gold his breast and his arms of silver his belly and his thighs of brass his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay oh my thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands Jesus told Peter blessed art thou Simon barod for flesh and blood has not revealed this unto thee but my Father which is in heaven that's right and I say unto thee that thou art Peter right and Upon This Rock right huh right Upon This Rock I will build my church that's right whose church is it Jesus Christ has a church who is the Builder of itus Jesus Christ who is the church Jesus Christ upon this Rock I will build my church the prophet of God teaches us The Rock was not Peter a man so unstable that only days later he denied Jesus and cursed while doing it more surprisingly he says the church wasn't built on Jesus it wasn't built on a man who lived 2,000 years ago the church is B built or founded upon the revelation of who Jesus [Applause] [Music] is that's how the church is built so Jesus Christ you know building the English word building is a noun because a building is a place right in the building tonight but it's also a verb building is an action Jesus was building a building and he said I'm going to build it it's going to be mine and everything about it is going to be mine it's going to be me I'm going to build it my church and the Gates of Hell shall not pre Prevail against it so what's Jesus saying is this church is going to possess the same qualities I possess it's going to be myself built it's going to be my habitation you shall only worship at the place where the Lord will put his name that's the only place true worship can be experienced but it's not a building you enter and leave it's a building you become that's why you take the lord's name in water baptism you're taking on the name of Jesus Christ the identification of Jesus Christ and he will meet the worshipper right there not just to give you a revelation of who he is but to make you to build you the individual into a stature of a perfect [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] man thou sawest till a stone was cut out without hands without human intervention without tampering of man without hands which smoke the image what Satan was trying to build what men were trying to build what Gentile kingdoms were trying to build when the stone smote it it destroyed it destroyed the goals the objectives the dreams the Visions the Ambitions and the aspirations friend this ain't something Daniel saw thousands of years ago this ain't even something that's off in the past necessarily this is your [Applause] conversion Peter Satan had desired to have you that he may sift you as weak Satan had a desire for your life he had a goal for your life he was trying to build you into something or he was trying to make you a slave like Israel was in Egypt to build treasure cities for himself and it was all going pretty good until a stone that was cut out of the mountain without hands struck what the enemy was trying to build whatever you were before your conversion is what Satan was trying to make out of your life but a stone intervened the revelation of who Jesus Christ is interrupted Satan's [Applause] program Hallelujah thou sawest till a stone was cut out without hands which smoke the image upon his feet that were of iron of clay and break them to Pieces then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken into pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smoke the image became a great Mountain that fied the Earth [Applause] amen when it fills the earth when it fills the Earth there's no room for anything else there's no room for any other ideas any other Ambitions any other desires no room for opinion no room for I thought or I dreamed or I hoped or I no that's all dissolved the stone became a great Mountain that filled the entire Earth amen praise the Lord see Ephesians 1 verse1 17 thank you lordu Ephesians 1 verse 17 oh my this ties with the scripture we read in Exodus 31 yes sir he go he he begins in verse 15 he says wherefore I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and that's accompanied by love unto all the saints that's right so if you got faith now I've been preaching on when the son of man returns shall he find faith on the earth and what you realize is it's like the um the armor man's son that went West to find a wife remember he went out there he thought I can't find this character in Chicago so I'll go out west he got out west and it wasn't there either but he goes out on the back porch to take a break and there he sees the little cousin little wash girl and and and and he says do you know why I'm here do you know why I've come I'm here looking for a wife and I see in you what what I was hoping I'd find find in there but I think I found it and will you marry me and she accepted the proposal and when she accepted he said one year from today I'm coming back and I'm going to take you to a place Jesus said I go to prepare for you a place sir so he left he probably walked off that back porch right back into the ballroom did some more d dancing or eating and fellowshipping and then the next morning he was gone and all those other girls went right back to their old way of life that's exactly right they all received a visitation the newspapers [Applause] testified the world gave witness they had received a visitation all right but when the the when when the U when the ministry was taken from the scene when the figure had when the character when he leaves they all go back yes to the mother to what they had been and done before but there was one little girl who in that visitation did not dance did not have fancy clothes did not have any of those special privileges but she received something she didn't just receive a visitation she received a promise she heard the message the message resonated the message came to her as an individual and said get ready I am coming back for you [Music] amen and she gave witness to the visitation by a change of behavior she kept washing dishes she kept scrubbing floors but she also began sewing she began taking material and preparing a wedding garment and a treasure chest to be taken with her when she left on the day he would return that was the difference she didn't just get a visitation she didn't just get a nice Supernatural experience she got the message when the son of man returns shall he find Faith the only Faith he will find and the only Faith he is searching for is the faith that he left in his first visit he found faith and he said I'm coming back for that faith and that Faith put her in preparation for his return not to stay there but to leave there hallelujah amen that's what he's coming back for he's coming back for the faith that he left amen with after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints SE not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the same thing that he gave to a holab the same thing he gave to bezel that he may give to you amen the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance where where is his inheritance not to the Saints in the Saints this is his inheritance amen this is his Heritage this is his Dwelling Place his place of ab Bo and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in heaven in the Heavenly places far above all principality power and might dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also that which is to come right and have put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is whose body huh which is his body the f u l n SS fullness the church his body is the fullness of him he is the Cornerstone he is every stone and he is the Capstone oh my continue reading there in chapter two it's it's wonderful all rightall now on these I'm reading from church ages book now on these the first stone how many knows who the first child was what was his name Reuben all right what was the last Benjamin that's right the birthstone of Ruben was Jasper the birthstone of Benjamin was sarden he was to look upon as Reuben and Benjamin the first and the last he was which is and shall come he is Alpha a in the Greek alphabet Omega Z in the Greek alphabet he was the first the last he was from Benjamin to Ruben from Ruben to Benjamin oh my there he was look upon as a Sardis and jasper stone he was setting on his throne amen how would you all like to see him sitting upon his glory let's turn over in Revelation 21:10 and just take a look at him there all right so what's he showing you Christ in his glory and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me the great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God [Applause] having the glory of God oh my brother my sister having the glory of God and her light was like un a stone most precious and the prophet of God says her light the light who is the light and the city had no need of the sun because the lamb is the light thereof the glory of God is Jesus Christ the glory of Jesus Christ is his church and he was the first what was he he was the beginning of time he is the ending of time he was the first of the Patriarchs the last of the Patriarchs he was the church he was the spirit am he was the spirit that was in the Church of Ephesus he is the spirit of the church in light he is the first and the last amen I always share this illustration I'm be closing soon but when Paul the Apostle Paul saw the pillar of fire of course his name was Saul at the time he said who are you Lord that's right the voice that spoke back said I am Jesus whom thou persecute and Saul had never met the man Jesus that's exactly right he had ascended long time ago yes sir but when Saul was persecuting thank his church why persecutest thou me he changed his form he changed his form that's same God same power same characteristics same attributes no different changed his form oh my praise the Lord in another message here um well it's yeah it's still in the church ages but in the it is in the midst of a time of great trouble that Jesus comes and with his coming there is a resurrection yes many are to come forth Out of the Dust and rise with those who are alive but waiting for his return and these will be given crowns why because they are sons of God they are Kings with him they are reigning with him that is what the crown signifies reigning and ruling with the great king himself that is the promise to all those who suffer with him here on Earth all those who patiently endured knowing that God the just judge would reward them they who gave up all for him and committed all to him will sit down in his throne and share in his glorious Kingdom amen oh we have a word for us all at this time it is it is hold fast persevere don't give up put on the whole armor of God you use every weapon he has given us use every gift at our disposal and look ahead with joy because we are going to be crowned by him who is king of kings and Lord of lords I'm jumping back into my other message scoffield takes that scripture when the son of man returns shall he find faith on the earth and he said this faith is not speaking of individual Faith but it's faith in the whole w l e the whole body of revealed truth now that wasn't even possible until this age because there were Mysteries contained within the seals not yet revealed so the son of man is looking for mature faith in a complete word right he's building a building he's building himself he is the building and he's the one building it but he's building it in a church and through each age and through each stage there is a partial completion waiting for the final age or the final stage at which point even the Loose Ends or what was still contained in a mystery form would be revealed amen in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of who who was the mystery of God revealed Christ who is the mystery of Christ revealed the bride in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound speaking God's thoughts from a Mountaintop experience the mystery of God should be finished made complete made whole when the son of man returned shall he find faith faith in the whole body of revealed truth a church that doesn't just believe or accept it on a mental level but a church that like a holab and like Bez are actually becoming the manifestation of the message now if Luther preached a message of justification It produced Justified lives Wesley preached sanctification It produced Sanctified lives in Pentecost It produced the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the restoration of the gifts what will the Rapture message [Music] produce it will activate it will Quicken a faith that was lying dormant waiting for the vision waiting for the message but when the message is sounded you catch the vision of what was in the mind of God and you are transformed Hallelujah when you recognize the very word of God was Eagle food and you left that other thing you heard from your theophany and you have been changed into the living Living Image it's not a blueprint it's not a pattern on the wall it becomes a tabernacle a dwelling place for Jehovah God himself you've been changed into the living image of the Living God you heard you heard from your theophany hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah can I continue now he is not only giving crowns but he says that these in his bride will be made pillars yes sir pillars in the temple of God you can't have a roof without pillars you can't have a ceiling without pillars pillars are integral members of the structure that are tying the building together these and the bride will be made pillars in the temple of God but what is the temple of God Jesus spoke of his body as being the temple it was it was the temple of God but now that we are his body the true church church is the temple of God by the Holy Ghost within us right he is going to make the Overcomer a pillar in that Temple I like to say this he's going to make the pillar an overcomer because you are a pillar he's going to make you an overcomer the Overcomer will be made into a pillar what is a pillar a pillar is actually a part that's of the foundation that's right for it holds up the super structure praise God that puts the believer right in with the apostles and Prophets where it says in Ephesians 2:19 therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets wait a minute New Testament Pro what yes you are built upon the foundation and he said you become one with the foundation brother bam said this book is for a prophetic class of people so of course you believe in a prophetic Ministry you have a prophetic Ministry you have the ministry of carrying out the prophecy you have the ministry of becoming the Fulfillment the prophecy amen Jesus Christ you're built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom in whom all the body building fitly framed together groweth up groweth unto an Holy Temple in the Lord in whom also ye are build together for in habitation of God through the spirit yes that verse 22 says that we are builded together with them everything went through the door Jesus and is a part of that body or Temple now when God puts a man in the temple as a pillar and makes him a part of the foundation group what is he doing what is is he doing he is giving him the revelation of the word and of himself because that is exactly what the apostles and Prophets had that's right Matthew 16:17 there he is in that word there he stands no one can get him out that's it you become Inseparable I am told that the Great Pyramid is actually made up of thousands upon thousands of little stones that are pyramid shaped those little pyramids are formed together to make a Great Pyramid but they are all miniature pyramids in and of themselves isn't that something all right Hallelujah so brother shimoken labor more on this but if you go 1962 December brother Brandon preaches a message is this the sign of the inser he references five or six dreams or visions that people other than himself had brother Junior Jackson was one sister shephard I believe was another all of these dreams are dealing with brother bradam going west and in brother Jackson's dream they were standing up at a hill yes my brother and there was writing inside that no man could interpret that's exactly like and he said brother Bram use something like a pry bar yes sir and he pried the top of it off it was like it came open the top of that mountain came open and there were things written there that the sun had never struck light had never Struck it before and to get it was unknown it was it was in a it was no one knew what it was saying not even brother Brenham but the vision carried him West and brother Brenham had associate ministers there in the dream there were Associates with him and brother benam instructed them stay here that's right and look on this that's right stay right here well some did not they wondered they strayed but some stayed and looked on and then brother brandham after going out west he returned with the revelation with the interpretation of what was mysteriously written inside that and in the message um in the message let me find it here this day the scripture is fulfilled he elaborates on it and he says then it was prophecy this day he said this scripture is fulfilled God a prophet yes sir a mountain yes sir a promise and a People amen those are paragraphs 174 through 178 I didn't prepare it but you can go read it the place Jesus went to prepare is the place the people he is returning to receive yes sir and he says this the handwriting on the wall that God has prepared his church God has prepared his church he he's prepared his people he has prepared his place and they are waiting for him to come and that Rapture when the The Trumpet Of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise we which are alive and remain sir shall not hinder them that's asleep for the trumpet of God shall sound the dead in Christ shall rise and we shall all be C up together with them to meet the Lord in the air a paradox one of these mornings when the graves open and the dead walks out when the ones who are living will be changed in a moment of a twinkling of an eye and go up in the air to meet him amen friends where are we where are we I believe I'm speaking tonight to yes sir some bezel and some aols some joshuas and some calebs say whether the whether the prophet is here or not the vision has been spoken yes sir and and it's not just on tablets of stone it's not just the memories of what he said but what he said yes sir is now tangible it's now substance it's now been performed it's been manifested I am the message of the hour you are the message of the hour you are Oh my Jesus came to the tomb of Lazarus thy brother shall rise again oh Lord we know in the resurrection I am the resurrection and the life the resurrection was not an event it was a person the Rapture is not an event it's a people who have become the Rapture message and have been enveloped they have been transfigured they have been caught up by a shout that has gone forth a message to gather the people to prepare them oh my they are the prepared place that Jesus is coming back to receive as his bride do you love the Lord this evening let's stand to our feet and give him praise tonight thank you Jesus thank you Lord hallelujah hallelujah God is so good amen praise the Lord I they can come to the music I I can't I can't leave this unsaid tonight I realize I've gone over an hour but I think I've I think uh there are some people that are eager to hear the prophecy that's right paragraph 174 let me find it here I want this on record somebody might be looking in tonight that this will just clench the nail he's describing that Vision or the dream brother Jackson had said you reached from somewhere and looked like got like a crowbar and whipped the top of this little Pyramid open and when it did said granite rock with no no writing on it and you told us to look in on this we all started looking I turned my head and I noticed you going towards the West just as hard as you could towards the setting of The Sun how many remembers it congregation says amen and I stood there a little bit till the spirit Holy Spirit revealed it I said the entire Bible as much as has been revealed to man through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism in Jesus name and all these things has been revealed but there's secrets oh Lord the girls in the ballroom got to dance the girl on the back porch got a secret there's secrets that hid inside that's hid inside because the Bible is sealed with Seven Seals I must go there to find it yes that afternoon when those seven angels come down and blasted the Earth and rocks flew Every Way Seven Angels stood there and said return back to Jeffersonville yes sir you see he had to be called up in that constellation and now you have to be called up the Vindication of the message amen return to Jeffersonville where you come from for the Seven Seals of the seven Mysteries will be open here we are today understanding yes sir serpent seed that's right wisdom and understanding in a few days if God willing will understand the correctness of marriage and divorce that's it and all these things that God has opened every seal the mystery since the foundation of the world and we've been in joy joy the presence of His blessings that is true this day this scripture the Life Magazine packed an article of it Mystic circle of light goes up in the air above Tucson and Phoenix in the same way I told you nearly a year

rest of her life that poor little put out thing can't even get a seat on the World Council churches they don't understand it they don't understand what got said on the back porch but what got said on the back porch amen was up there every night making a wedding dress and packing a treasure chest to be ready for the soon return of the bridegroom she wasn't making preparations to stay she was making preparations to leave and it did not matter if anybody else understood or believed or sympathized or appreciated her testimony when this Revelation strikes you it won't matter what anybody else says does or thinks you've got your future home in sight you're marching into it you're walking into it the word of God is transforming you into rapturing faith [Music] they don't understand yet what

has been downloaded that you need to continue throughout the week and get it but one of these day you will see something that was there in a scripture it's amazing this it looks like this Bible is written for the message because it's unbelievable how the message of BR Bram matches the scripture in every way every way every even every little detail amen amen there was a time we heard the message there was a time people argue about the message there is a time people wasted time on the internet there was a time some search trying to disprove or prove the prophet we don't have that time our time
