[39:33] Hallelujah.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music]
[39:35] Amen. [applause]
[39:40] As we prepare to take up our tithes and
[39:41] offerings, um, Brother Charles, you
[39:44] won't mind come blessing the tithes and
[39:45] offerings and you can give a testimony.
[39:47] you have a testimony while before you.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Hey, God bless you everyone.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; Um,
[39:56] this past few weeks uh know we had our
[40:00] director of safety move on. So, a lot of
[40:03] that burden has been pressed upon me and
[40:06] uh I actually had I had a class this
[40:07] week and um
[40:10] during the class I was uh doing work for
[40:15] the company but you know also doing my,
[40:18] you know, trying to do my exams, trying
[40:20] to listen to what the instructor saying,
[40:23] you know, it was kind of all over the
[40:24] place. But, um,
[40:27] as the instructor was giving the class,
[40:29] the Lord was, you know, kept bringing
[40:30] things to me, you know, and I was
[40:32] hearing, you know, I would respond and
[40:34] I'll be right, sometimes I'd be wrong.
[40:36] Uh but if you're not familiar to
[40:38] understand the testimony um there was a
[40:41] point in my time where I had a
[40:42] photographic memory and I could just
[40:44] remember everything.
[40:46] If you forgot if you forgot I I'll make
[40:48] you remember. I'll tell you what you
[40:49] were wearing. I'll tell you what you
[40:50] were doing. But I got in a real bad
[40:53] accident and I've been fighting with
[40:55] that ever since. So those things have
[40:58] never been difficult for me to remember
[41:00] information.
[41:01] And um
[41:04] in safety
[41:06] you have to understand everything
[41:08] because you're like the lawyer in a
[41:10] sense. You have to understand the
[41:12] practices, the methods, the
[41:13] manufacturers, what they want, what they
[41:15] say, you know, because if something is
[41:17] wrong, you have to know what is wrong to
[41:19] a certain degree. So it's it's very
[41:22] complex.
[41:23] So, as I'm in the I'm I'm I'm in the uh
[41:26] the first day because this is very
[41:27] important for you to understand because
[41:29] I'm I'm this testimony is based upon
[41:30] what what he's saying
[41:34] and the the uh the as as the instructor
[41:37] was giving the class, you know, I'm
[41:39] receiving information. I'm forgetting
[41:41] information. Make a long story short,
[41:45] when there came time for me to take the
[41:47] exam,
[41:48] there was a a gentleman and everybody
[41:51] was baffled at this. He was a scientist.
[41:53] His family wanted to start some type of
[41:55] business building houses, remodeling
[41:57] houses, and because he was the smartest
[41:58] one, they wanted him to take the course.
[42:01] Um,
[42:03] we took the exam. I didn't pray.
[42:07] I wasn't concerned with this. I wasn't
[42:08] concerned with that. And the day before
[42:09] the exam, I'm trying to remember it as
[42:11] it comes to me at the day before the
[42:14] exam, the uh we left here on Wednesday
[42:18] night. And when I got home, I had a
[42:21] message on my phone from the uh the risk
[42:24] management director and he said we had
[42:26] an amputation on a project in in in
[42:29] Indiana. So now all hands are on deck.
[42:32] I'm trying to figure this out. Send this
[42:33] information and information. So it was a
[42:35] lot of pressure is what I'm saying. Um I
[42:38] told the instructor, listen, I may have
[42:40] to cut out for a meeting so on and so
[42:41] forth. I have to take the class again.
[42:43] So I take the exam. It was a 4-hour
[42:45] exam,
[42:46] right? And when it was time for the
[42:49] exam, I went straight down the list. D.
[42:55] Got everyone right except for one.
[42:58] Right. I wasn't paying attention. I
[43:01] wasn't paying attention what he was
[43:02] saying. It was an automatic straight
[43:06] down the line. And I wasn't paying
[43:07] attention the whole time in the class.
[43:10] The scientist next to me got more
[43:12] questions wrong than I did.
[43:15] Now, what I'm saying is
[43:19] even if you don't believe,
[43:22] just do it anyhow.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Just put the burden on him
[43:27] &gt;&gt; because it's not it's it's it's not
[43:28] whoever's behind the desk. Who could
[43:30] care less?
[43:32] &gt;&gt; And I'll leave off by saying this.
[43:36] The Lord had brother Stephen meet me and
[43:37] my wife at a house. I I try not to give
[43:40] testimonies a lot and I'm probably wrong
[43:41] for that.
[43:43] But he said
[43:45] he had a conversation. He said, "Make
[43:47] five payments."
[43:48] Five payments here. He said, "Watch what
[43:50] God will do."
[43:53] Called the gentleman, talked to him,
[43:55] started making the five payments. I want
[43:57] to say around third payment, second
[43:58] payment.
[44:00] I said, "Yeah." We had a nice
[44:02] conversation because he was a
[44:03] Pentecostal brother. I said, "Yeah." I
[44:06] told him the conversation I had with my
[44:07] pastor
[44:08] and he said he said he he said what
[44:14] he almost he started crying on the
[44:16] phone. I told him he said make five
[44:18] payments.
[44:20] I made the five payments he said you do
[44:23] what God keeps you.
[44:26] Once I made the five payments I never
[44:28] heard again from the brother. On top of
[44:31] that, when the fifth payment was made,
[44:33] about an hour and a half later, I
[44:35] received a check for over $1,200.
[44:38] So, please, and there's many more
[44:40] testimonies. I don't want to take up
[44:41] time. Just
[44:44] do what he says.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; Especially you youth, don't get caught
[44:47] up in your mind. Okay, he said it. Lord,
[44:49] it's your fault. It's your fault because
[44:50] you had him say it. Don't look at no
[44:52] man. Just believe what God is saying
[44:54] because that's God's responsibility.
[44:56] Don't ever get in a position to where,
[44:57] well, that was brother Steve and that
[44:59] was God. You already in trouble. Don't
[45:00] do that.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Don't do that. Just listen and do it.
[45:03] And I promise you, you won't be able to
[45:05] give the testimonies. You won't because
[45:07] nobody's going to believe it.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; All right.
[45:11] [applause]
[45:12] All right. Let us Amen. Praise God.
[45:16] Praise the Lord.
[45:18] All right. Let us let us pray. Father,
[45:22] heavenly father, we thank you, Lord
[45:24] Jesus Christ, for the word that you have
[45:26] given us in this hour, Lord God. It's
[45:28] changing our lives, Lord God. out of
[45:30] every fiber of our beings, Lord God.
[45:31] Lord, we're becoming more and more like
[45:33] you each and every day, Father. Lord, as
[45:35] your word is transforming us, heavenly
[45:37] father, as you have selected us in this
[45:39] hour, Lord God, to be put on display for
[45:41] thy name's sake, Lord Jesus, we give you
[45:43] thanks, Heavenly Father, for all that
[45:45] you're doing, Lord God. Father, we thank
[45:47] you, Lord God, for the couple's meeting
[45:49] yesterday, heavenly father. Lord, we
[45:51] understand, Lord God, that there's
[45:53] things that need to be put back in line,
[45:54] Lord God. And we thank you for your
[45:56] word, Father, laying a foundation, Lord
[45:58] God. you truly being the guide, leading
[46:00] us and guiding us on what we ought to
[46:02] do, Father, for these promises to be
[46:04] fulfilled, Father. Lord, if there's any,
[46:06] Lord, uh, stubbornness, Lord, in in in
[46:08] any one of us, Lord God, that don't want
[46:10] to move into what you would have us to
[46:12] do, Father, we ask for your mercy. We
[46:14] ask for your grace, heavenly father,
[46:16] because your word is like a hammer, Lord
[46:17] Jesus Christ. Your word says and you
[46:19] promised us, Lord God, that the things
[46:21] that you have for us today, Lord God,
[46:23] they will they will all come to pass,
[46:25] Lord God, and they will not be hindered,
[46:26] Father, for your word will not return to
[46:28] you void, Father. Lord, continue to
[46:30] bless the building project, Lord God,
[46:31] and every addition and every vision you
[46:33] have given, Lord, Brother Steven,
[46:35] Father, I pray that you touch I pray,
[46:37] Lord God, that you help us, Lord, to
[46:38] pray more one for another and more for
[46:40] the work that's being done, Father.
[46:42] Lord, your prophet said that the the the
[46:44] the man that's carrying the ball, we
[46:46] don't ought to take the ball from him,
[46:48] but we ought to pray and we ought to
[46:49] block for him, heavenly father. So,
[46:51] anytime we see spirits lingering, Lord
[46:53] God, attacking the pastor, attacking the
[46:55] youth, Father, Lord, strike a seed,
[46:57] Lord, deep down within us, Father, to
[46:58] remember these things, Father, to help
[47:00] the pastor, Lord God, as he's taken on
[47:02] these battles, Lord God, as you have led
[47:04] the shepherd to do so, Father. Lord, we
[47:06] thank you, Lord God. And we pray,
[47:07] Father, for the tithes and offerings,
[47:09] Lord God. And we pray that you use them
[47:11] for the furtherance of your kingdom,
[47:12] Lord God. Touch hearts, Lord God, to do
[47:14] the supernatural, heavenly father. Lord
[47:16] God, we pray, heavenly father, that you
[47:17] take the remainder of this service in
[47:19] your hands, Father. And we wait for your
[47:21] appearing, heavenly father. We know
[47:22] you're here, Father, but there's another
[47:23] gear. There's another level, Heavenly
[47:25] Father, that we're in expectation for,
[47:27] Father. And we have never come in this
[47:28] place, Lord God, and left the same,
[47:30] Father. You've always met our
[47:31] expectations, Lord God. So help us to
[47:34] hear from you, Lord God, and change us
[47:35] as you promised to do. For we ask you
[47:37] this in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.

[48:17] and then the load for the next day. They
[48:19] wanted us to pick it up the Monday where
[48:21] they say it's going to be ice and so on.
[48:24] So, all you truckers who know about the
[48:25] fifth wheel on the on your truck, you
[48:27] know, it's that round disc in the back
[48:29] of the um semi that locks onto the
[48:32] trailer. Uh I did my two loads locked
[48:35] onto the new trailer that I'm pulling
[48:37] the new load. And I'm pulling out of the
[48:39] yard. And as I'm pulling out, I heard a
[48:42] big bang, you know, and it shook the
[48:44] whole truck. And I put it in park and I
[48:46] come out to see what it was. I looked. I
[48:49] thought it was the the antilock brakes
[48:51] cuz I was having a little problem with
[48:52] it showing the light. So I thought it
[48:54] was just a brake release and I looked
[48:56] everywhere. Everything seems fine. So I
[48:59] came out of there, took a left, took
[49:01] another left, took a right, took a
[49:03] Uturn, took a right, another right to
[49:05] where I stopped and I got there to where
[49:07] I parked the truck and um I thought it
[49:11] was the ABS light. So I looking at the
[49:13] ABS. I don't see nothing wrong with it.
[49:15] And I looked at the back of the truck
[49:16] and I said, "How is it my trailer is
[49:18] almost at the at the end of the wheel,
[49:22] the last wheel?" And when I looked, the
[49:24] the the fifth wheel slid out and was
[49:27] just hanging on. And I had 21 tons of
[49:31] steel on that truck and my heart just
[49:35] leapt. Then I started to rejoice because
[49:38] God say he'll never leave you.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; He'll never forsake you. He'll be with
[49:43] you. So when it doesn't seem like he's
[49:46] there, he's there. He's a hedge. He's a
[49:48] protection for you. And I just want to
[49:50] give him praise for that [applause] this
[49:51] morning.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; God bless your sins.
[50:14] A desire [singing]
[50:17] is burning in my heart.

[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Let's all pray. Heavenly Father, Lord,
[1:14:22] we are approaching you again humbly this
[1:14:25] morning. Father, thanking you for your
[1:14:27] grace, your love, your mercy, and for
[1:14:29] everything you have been doing for us.

[1:14:34] the ability you have given me. But when
[1:14:36] it come to preach and ministering to
[1:14:38] your children, I am insufficient. I
[1:14:41] depend completely upon the Holy Spirit
[1:14:43] and we all depend from thee because it's
[1:14:46] an it's a work of the spirit. May you
[1:14:48] come and move us completely out of the
[1:14:50] way. May you come and speak to us, seal
[1:14:53] the devil and every demon away from this
[1:14:56] place and Lord come down in the power of
[1:14:58] resurrection and bless us like you did

[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, glory to God. Let's go to the
[1:15:12] book of Exodus 34. This is where we
[1:15:14] stop. So, do good and we can finish this
[1:15:18] part that we didn't finish last week. If
[1:15:21] you start slowing me down, then we push
[1:15:24] it to next week. Amen. Thank you for all
[1:15:27] your care and all your security check.
[1:15:31] [laughter]
[1:15:32] Sister I believe sister
[1:15:35] uh uh Tanya Musaki if I'm not mistaken
[1:15:39] she said brother Steven I will be
[1:15:41] praying so you go to bed on time.
[1:15:43] [laughter]
[1:15:45] So people are caring and I'm trying to
[1:15:48] meditate. I say I will say no I will be
[1:15:50] in prayer so you go to bed on time. So
[1:15:52] usually I go to bed around 2:00 a.m.
[1:15:55] 3:00 a.m. on Saturday and for some
[1:15:58] reason I went to bed around 1:00. So
[1:16:01] your prayer work
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:16:05] [applause]
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine somebody's praying for
[1:16:08] me?
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; God is alive.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Genesis 34. If Lord's
[1:16:14] willing, my subject is what we didn't
[1:16:18] preach last time and we tried to preach.
[1:16:20] It's a mysterious season.
[1:16:26] Mysterious season.
[1:16:30] mysterious
[1:16:34] season
[1:16:36] in the parable.
[1:16:39] I hope somebody already read this
[1:16:41] parable to make your life easy. If you
[1:16:44] didn't, be my guest. In the parable
[1:16:50] of
[1:16:52] the 10 pound,
[1:16:58] the 10 pound it is also called in
[1:17:01] another
[1:17:02] translation 10 manners which is a salary
[1:17:06] for three month one pound. We clear?
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; We clear?
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh my subject matter this morning
[1:17:16] is our life journey through Joseph's
[1:17:19] five garment
[1:17:21] part
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; nandi
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; we are still in the second garment we on
[1:17:29] part nandi so I don't know when we will
[1:17:32] get to the fifth one and the theme is a
[1:17:35] mysterious season in the parable of the
[1:17:38] 10 pound Exodus 34 if you there? You can
[1:17:42] say amen.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Verse one. Please keep your seat belt.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Stay alert
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; because this could be a road that you
[1:17:53] have not traveled before.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; I don't want to lose anyone. I will walk
[1:17:58] you up slowly,
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; but stay alert.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; All right. Verse one. And the Lord said
[1:18:08] to Moses, you may be seated.
[1:18:11] Your prayer has been answered.
[1:18:15] [laughter]
[1:18:16] The Lord said to Moses,
[1:18:20] we understand clearly who Moses is.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; In this church, you know who Moses is.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Moses is not an ordinary prophet.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; You got your whistle, brother Polyar.
[1:18:36] Yeah. Thank you. Uhhuh. Thank you. So
[1:18:39] now we can preach very well. Moses is
[1:18:42] not an ordinary prophet. Moses was a
[1:18:46] prophet that spoke with God face to
[1:18:48] face.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in the book of Exodus
[1:18:55] 33:1, we will continue our reading. I
[1:18:58] have not started preaching yet. So keep
[1:19:00] your 45 minutes. I will tell you when
[1:19:02] you start counting that. In Exodus
[1:19:05] 33:11,
[1:19:07] the Bible say, "And the Lord spake unto
[1:19:10] who?"
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Moses.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; How?
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Face to face.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "No one have seen God
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; at any time." But Moses was talking to
[1:19:24] God face to face. Which face was Moses
[1:19:28] seeing?
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; That's it. Come on now, brother. Because
[1:19:33] God appeared to Moses in the pillar of
[1:19:35] fire.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; I hope you can swallow this.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; In other word, when God was talking to
[1:19:43] Moses,
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; God was not just using a voice.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; God will appear to Moses.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; And Moses and God will look at each
[1:19:59] other.
[1:20:01] Come on.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; You are slow, my friend.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; He will look. He will speak to Moses.
[1:20:08] How?
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Face to face.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; As a man speaketh unto who?
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; His friend.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; You know how you talk to your friend?
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; To your body. Body. You know how you
[1:20:17] talk to your friend?
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; That's the way God was talking to Moses.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; How far do you talk to your friend?
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; How closer do you talk to your friend?
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:30] You can come even to your friend and you
[1:20:32] say listen listen listen because it's
[1:20:34] your friend. That's the way God
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; was talking to Moses.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; So Moses
[1:20:40] have an idea of how God look like.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; I know there is a scripture troubling
[1:20:49] you. When he says, "Can I see your
[1:20:51] glory?"
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Can I see your face?"
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; He says the glory And God show him the
[1:21:00] back.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; There is a reason why they have to show
[1:21:03] him the back.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; There is a reason why Elohim have to
[1:21:08] show Sarah the back.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; There is a reason why brother Brham have
[1:21:16] to show you the back. [cheering]
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; There is a reason why the seven still
[1:21:21] have to be sealed in the back.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; That's why I told you stay awake. Are we
[1:21:28] together?
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; But we're not talking about the back.
[1:21:32] We're talking about the face of God.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; So, somebody who can at least describe
[1:21:38] you, God,
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; is Moses.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Because God was talking to Moses face to
[1:21:44] face. Are we clear?
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; And he turned again into the camp. And
[1:21:49] his servant Joshua the son of Nun, a
[1:21:52] young man, departed not out of the water
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; tabernacle. In number 12 verse8 the
[1:21:58] Bible say with him Moses will I speak
[1:22:03] how?
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Mouth to mouth.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Now it's no more face to face.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; It is mouthto mouth even how
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; apparently
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; and not in what
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; in dark speeches.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; In other word God was not using parable.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Apparently that's correct. He was not
[1:22:21] using I mean uh I mean speech figure or
[1:22:24] whatever to talk to Moses. God was
[1:22:27] talking to Moses direct
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; plan.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; In other words, WHEN GOD TALKED TO
[1:22:33] MOSES, Moses cannot sit and say I wonder
[1:22:36] what did God want to tell me when he was
[1:22:39] saying that Moses didn't have a time to
[1:22:41] read between the lines.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; He was clear to Moses. Are we clear?
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; This is what God is saying here. And the
[1:22:47] Bible say, "And the similitude,
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; this is the form."
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; The similitude of who?
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; The Lord
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; shall he what?
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Behold.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; SO MOSES SAW HOW GOD LOOK LIKE.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; I'm reading the Bible. You can verify
[1:23:03] your Bible. I just put it here to save
[1:23:05] you time.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; To flip the pages. Amen.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; So Moses was a prophet that knew God.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; That saw the form.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Of God. Amen.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; We saw the form of God in the man Jesus
[1:23:20] Christ.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; But Moses saw God before he was in
[1:23:24] Jesus.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Moses saw God.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Without the body of Jesus Christ.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; COME ON, BROTHER.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; MOSES SAW THE GOD that was hidden in
[1:23:42] Jesus Christ.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; MOSES SAW GOD WITHOUT a clo.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; That's too strong. Let me help you.
[1:23:55] Moses saw God without a veil. Now he
[1:23:58] will help you. Amen.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORD, MOSES SAW CHRIST.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; MOSES,
[1:24:11] why are you studying like this?
[1:24:14] MOSES DID NOT SEE JESUS CHRIST.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; HE ONLY SAW CHRIST.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; We got the name Jesus Christ.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Can you swallow this stuff?
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the one that was born from
[1:24:38] Mary.
[1:24:41] You shall have a child and you shall
[1:24:43] call his name what?
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; That's the man that you see there.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; And he took the name of the father.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; BUT THE FATHER CHRIST.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Was inside Jesus.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S WHY JESUS COULD CRY AND
[1:25:05] SAY, "MY FATHER,
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; MY FATHER, why have you forsaken me?" IN
[1:25:10] OTHER WORDS, CHRIST CROSS YOU GOING
[1:25:12] AWAY.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; THEY THEY NEVER KILL CHRIST AT THE
[1:25:20] CROSS.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE CHRIST FOREVER,
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; THEY ONLY KILLED JESUS CHRIST. YES.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; BUT BECAUSE CHRIST AND JESUS WAS ONE,
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; when you kill Jesus, IT IS COUNTED LIKE
[1:25:34] YOU KILL GOD.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T KILL GOD.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; SO MOSES NEVER SAW JESUS CHRIST.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; NO.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; MOSES SAW CHRIST
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAW THE FORM OF CHRIST.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Because Christ can change form.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; You see how you taking longer to move
[1:26:01] from one scripture.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "WHEREFORE then were ye not
[1:26:07] afraid to speak against who?"
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; My servant Moses.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; In other words, God was saying, "Don't
[1:26:13] play with Moses."
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Exactly right.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Moses is another caliber.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Moses is a prophet that me and him, we
[1:26:22] deal differently than any other prophet.
[1:26:25] And when God deal with somebody at that
[1:26:28] level, YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL HOW YOU
[1:26:31] HANDLING HIM.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.

[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; A MAN THAT CAN TAKE his hand on the
[1:26:45] wheel and God begin to drive the car.

[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU WILL PAY FOR IT.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT MAN SOMETIME WILL GIVE YOU
[1:27:20] CONFUSION.

[1:27:30] YOU'RE TALKING TO HIM
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; AND YOU HEARING HIS VOICE,
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; BUT TRULY IT'S NOT HIM.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; SOMETIME HE'S NOT EVEN IN HIS BODY.

[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; We play around this truth. Let I mean in
[1:28:06] the message left and right. There is no
[1:28:09] time for playing.

[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Brana. Uh in the book of
[1:28:28] Deuteronomy 34:10,
[1:28:30] the Bible say there arose not who
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; a prophet.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Since in Israel like unto who?
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Moses
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; whom the LORD KNEW HOW
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; FACE to face.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; SO NO ONE WAS IN THE CALIBER OF MOSES.
[1:28:45] YES.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Moses even say that the Lord your God
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; will send a prophet
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; like unto who?
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; So you need to understand Moses before
[1:29:01] you understand Jesus Christ.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; I see my mother there. God bless you
[1:29:07] mama. God bless you. [laughter]

[1:29:15] together? Amen. Listen to what brother
[1:29:17] BRHAM SAID. BROTHER BRHAM SAID, "THIS is

[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; NOW, THERE WAS NEVER a man in all the
[1:29:25] earth.

[1:29:32] MOSES.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; SO, if there were people that talk face
[1:29:38] to face, it's only Moses and Jesus.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Don't worry my friend. The Bible say if
[1:29:47] there be one who spiritual or a prophet
[1:29:50] brother Brandham say and the Lord will
[1:29:52] make myself known unto him in what?
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; In visions
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; and
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; in dreams.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; But as for my servant WHO?
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; MOSES.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; I TALKED TO HIM HOW
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; face to face.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; SEE OF COURSE HE WAS A TYPE OF WHO?

[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. That's why Jesus
[1:30:12] say if you would have believed Moses
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; right
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; you would not have a problem with me
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; YOU NEVER EVEN UNDERSTOOD Moses
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; we clear so far
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; is it too strong
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; no sir
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; let's continue our reading
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES NOW you
[1:30:30] understand Moses
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; you put Moses
[1:30:37] we talking about his face
[1:30:41] and his mouth.

[1:31:10] And the first one was not yun by go uh
[1:31:13] by Moses.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; God did both of them.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; No problem. In Exodus 31st verse 18 the
[1:31:25] Bible say and he gave unto Moses God
[1:31:29] when he made an end of communing of
[1:31:32] talking with him upon mansana he gave

[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:04] were written
[1:32:07] by the finger
[1:32:12] of God.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; You know when Moses was working in
[1:32:16] Israel, I mean in Egypt
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; and uh and Pharaoh magician try try and

[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; THE THE TABLE was written by the finger
[1:32:41] of God.

[1:33:03] what?
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; The mount.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; And the two table of the testimony were
[1:33:07] where?
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; In his hand.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; This is tough.
[1:33:16] So Moses was coming down the mountain
[1:33:19] with two table of the testimony open.
[1:33:22] a prophet in a mountain with an open
[1:33:25] testimony.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Some of them I I will continue to hide
[1:33:33] since you you can't swallow them. No
[1:33:35] problem. Amen. AND THE TWO TABLE OF THE
[1:33:38] testimony were in his hand. The table
[1:33:41] were written how?
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; On both their sides.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; So the table were written within and
[1:33:46] without.

[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; The tables were were written on the
[1:34:08] front and on the back
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF YOU GO TO THE BOOK OF
[1:34:15] REVELATION, YOU WILL SEE A BOOK THAT WAS
[1:34:17] WRITTEN WITHIN. AMEN.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; And they were written on both side. On
[1:34:26] the one side and on the other hand were
[1:34:28] they what? Written.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; And we know they were written by the
[1:34:31] finger of God. And the TABLE WERE THE
[1:34:34] WORK OF WHO?
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; GOD.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; SO WHO CHOPPED THE
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; the the
[1:34:40] stone?
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; So these table were written by God and

[1:34:48] of God.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; So they were yuned by God.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; God went into A ROCK AND CHOPPED the
[1:34:56] rock.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; And God himself wrote on the rock.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; And took it and gave it to Moses.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; AND MOSES TOOK THAT AND DESTROY IT.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; YES, he did.
[1:35:09] [laughter]

[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE FIRST TABLE THAT WAS
[1:35:22] DESTROYED. NOW IN Exodus 34, God is
[1:35:26] telling Moses, "Now you come,
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; you go ahead." Not God.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; IT IS NOW THE TURN of Moses to do some
[1:35:39] work.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE BY GOD.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; That's why I tell you read the message.
[1:35:50] You're giving me double work.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; You remember the the vision of Junior
[1:35:55] Jackson.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; I send you quote. All of you in the
[1:35:58] group chat, I send you quote. You
[1:35:59] remember that?
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; The vision have two part. You remember
[1:36:02] that?
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; The first part was written
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; by an unknown hand.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; And when he get to the top, he chopped
[1:36:12] the part.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham took something sharp.
[1:36:17] and chop the mountain.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; The prophet begin to chop the rock.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; When brother Brandham opened this, there
[1:36:29] was nothing written.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham took that and went
[1:36:36] to the west
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; to meet God in the mountain
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; so God can tell him what is written in
[1:36:45] what seems to be not written.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; So now God BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID THIS
[1:36:55] ONE he interpreted without any problem.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; He got in here. This is where brother
[1:37:00] Brandham was unable to interpret. WE
[1:37:03] FOUND OUT THAT THE FIRST TABLE OF THE
[1:37:05] testimony was written by God.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; CHOPPED BY GOD.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; BUT THE SECOND ONE, GOD IS TELLING
[1:37:13] MOSES, you
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; no more me.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; You who broke the table.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; You go get some tools and go chop the
[1:37:23] mountain.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU CHOP THE MOUNTAIN, DON'T
[1:37:26] WRITE ANYTHING THERE.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. SO MOSES CUT the
[1:37:31] table and pick UP THE TABLE WITHOUT any
[1:37:35] writing.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; And Moses went to
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Mona.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; He went to the mountain
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; with a rock without riding
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; it.
[1:37:47] Amen.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together? A ROCK THAT MOSES IS
[1:37:52] THE ONE THAT CUT IT.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when he went with that rock,
[1:37:57] he went all the way to the mountain for
[1:38:00] God to write on it.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; THE CHOPPING PART IS MOSES.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; UH-HUH.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; But the writing ON THE ROCK MUST COME
[1:38:12] from God.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; But when God write, God always write
[1:38:17] with his finger.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN. ONE DAY WHEN THEY BROUGHT THE
[1:38:24] WOMAN THAT WAS CAUGHT IN ADULTERY, GOD
[1:38:28] IN HUMAN FLESH DIDN'T TALK TO ANYONE. HE
[1:38:31] WENT ON the ground and he BEGIN TO WRITE
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER WAS WRITTEN THERE. ME AND YOU,
[1:38:37] WE DON'T KNOW.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN EVERYBODY SAW THAT THEY TURN
[1:38:40] AROUND
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD WAS RIDING AGAIN
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; ON THE IN BABYLON WHEN THEY WERE PLAYING
[1:38:49] WITH THE STAFF OF THE TEMPLE. THE BIBLE
[1:38:52] SAY A HAND CAME OUT
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; AND BEGIN TO WRITE OVER THERE.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; GOD CAN [screaming] WRITE.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Help me move from the airport. ARE WE
[1:39:05] TOGETHER?
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; SO, WHAT IS THE FINGER OF GOD?

[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE BIBLE SAY in Deuteronomy 10:1,
[1:39:20] "And that time the Lord say unto Moses,
[1:39:23] do what?

[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; And I will write on the table the word
[1:39:36] that were in the first table, which thou
[1:39:38] breakest, and thou shalt put them where?
[1:39:40] in the ark.

[1:39:44] you two table of stone like unto the
[1:39:46] first and went up where
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; into the mount
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; having the two table where
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; in mine hand
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; and he GOD WROTE ON THE TABLE.

[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO THE FIRST writing the ten
[1:39:57] commandment which the Lord spake unto
[1:40:00] you in the mount of the midst of the
[1:40:02] fire in the day of water
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; these
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; and the Lord gave them unto who?
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Me. When we say riding with the finger
[1:40:09] of God, what does the finger of God
[1:40:12] means?
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS IN THE BOOK OF Luke
[1:40:15] 11:20,
[1:40:17] BUT IF I Jesus
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Jesus is talking, if I with what?

[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; do what?
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Cast out devils.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; NOT THAT THE KINGDOM OF GOD is come upon
[1:40:29] who?
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; YOU.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; SO JESUS WAS CASTING out devil with
[1:40:32] what?
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; The finger of God.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT DOES FINGER OF GOD MEANS? ARE
[1:40:36] WE TOGETHER? AMEN.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; BROTHER MATTHEW GIVE US MORE clarity in
[1:40:40] Matthew 12:28.
[1:40:42] The same scripture. Matthew say, "BUT IF
[1:40:45] I CAST A DEVIL BY WHAT?
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; THE SPIRIT of God."
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; AND THEN THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS WHAT?
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Come unto you.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; MATTHEW IS CALLING THAT THE SPIRIT OF
[1:40:54] THE LORD. AND THEN LUKE IS CALLING THAT
[1:40:57] THE FINGER OF GOD. SO THE FINGER OF GOD
[1:41:00] MEANS THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; ANY QUESTIONS SO FAR?
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; NO SIR. SO GOD [screaming] BY WAS RIDING

[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Don't sleep my friend. It's the devil
[1:41:15] start working on you.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; GOD WAS RIDING WITH THE SPIRIT OF GOD.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; SO THE FINGER OF GOD MEANS THE SPIRIT OF
[1:41:24] GOD.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; IF YOU WANT TO CAST OUT DEVIL, YOU CAST
[1:41:27] OUT DEVIL BY THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.

[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; A bar
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; which was a sword." Amen. And did water

[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Nothing wrote on it.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; AND AT THAT TIME I START TO THE WEST AND
[1:41:52] I told them all. I SAID, "DON'T go out
[1:41:55] west. Stay here and look on this until I
[1:41:57] do what
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; return."
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; I went WEST FOR THE WATER.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; THE BLAST. BROTHER BRANDHAM WENT WEST
[1:42:02] FOR THE THUNDER.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO GET TO THE THUNDER SOONER.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Shake somebody, my friend.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; We don't want any devil working right
[1:42:12] here.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; We want God to work.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?

[1:42:20] sleep need to leave this place.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Because you need to hear from God.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; If you sleepy, stand up on the corner
[1:42:27] there.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BROTHER BRHAM WENT FOR THE WEST
[1:42:32] FOR THE THUNDER.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; AND HE RETURNED BACK TO THE EAST WITH
[1:42:38] WATER.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit,
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; the finger of God INTERPRETING THE
[1:42:43] WATER.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; THIS UNWRITTEN WORD.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; FOR THERE WAS A WORD THAT WAS UNWRITTEN
[1:42:47] RIGHT THERE. BUT HE HAVE TO BE
[1:42:49] INTERPRETED BY THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; MOSES CAN CUT THE STONE, BUT MOSES
[1:42:54] CANNOT WRITE.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; THE WRITING NEED TO COME FROM THE HOLY
[1:42:57] GHOST.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEIR WRITTEN WORD MUST BE
[1:43:00] INTERPRETED BY THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WHEN WE ARE LISTENING TO THE
[1:43:05] TAPE, WE ARE NOT LISTENING TO BROTHER
[1:43:07] BRAN. WE ARE LISTENING TO THE HOLY
[1:43:10] SPIRIT INSIDE BROTHER.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WE CALL IT THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.

[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Did Israel Did Israel have a problem
[1:43:31] listening to Moses?
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; So why do you have a problem with the
[1:43:34] voice of brother?
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; THE VOICE OF MOSES WAS IN THE HOUSES OF
[1:43:44] THE ISRAELITE.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WE HAVE ALSO THE VOICE OF OUR
[1:43:48] MOSES.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE AS MOSES WAS GIVEN TWO SON,
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM ALSO WERE GIVEN TWO SON.
[1:43:58] I DON'T KNOW IF WE TOGETHER.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.

[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; ONLY TO PROPHET.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:44:26] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [cheering]

[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BROWN SAY, I CAME BACK WITH THE
[1:44:34] HOLY SPIRIT DOING WHAT?
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Interpreting this UNWRITTEN WORD.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; AND IF THAT IS NOT PERFECTLY THAT GOD
[1:44:40] ALMIGHTY, I want you to know what it is.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; We clear so far.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; We clear so far.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; So God told Moses, "Come to the
[1:44:48] mountain, bring me this, and I will
[1:44:50] write on it." We clear so far?
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Everybody clear? Amen.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Everybody clear?
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; JOB 2:3. AND NO man
[1:45:00] come up with you. Nobody can follow
[1:45:02] Moses.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Neither let any man be seen what
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; throughout all the mount.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Neither let the flock
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; nor herd
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; feed before water.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; That mount.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; And he water
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; two tables of stone
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; like the first. Then Moses rose up early
[1:45:23] in the morning and went to the mount to
[1:45:26] Mount Sana as the Lord has commanded
[1:45:28] him. And he took in his hand what
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; the mount the two tables of stone
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; without anything written on there. AND
[1:45:34] THE LORD DESCENDED HOW
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; IN THE CLOUD.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; So is it A PROBLEM TO SEE A MOUNTAIN
[1:45:40] WITH A CLOUD?
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; NO.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; IT WAS DONE IN THE BIBLE. THE
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; IN TRANSFIGURATION, GOD CAME IN THE
[1:45:53] CLOUD.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; GOD LOVED THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; GOD CAME ON THE MOUNTAIN WITH A WHAT?
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; CLOUD.

[1:46:12] with a cloud. Are we together? And stood
[1:46:15] with him there and proclaimed what? the
[1:46:18] name of the Lord.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; SO GOD CAME WITH A CLOUD AND WE KNOW
[1:46:22] CLEARLY THAT NOT ONLY CLOUD BUT THERE
[1:46:25] WERE THUNDER THAT WERE GOING ON.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; So when he CAME AND WAS THUNDERING over
[1:46:35] there. Amen. Israel was hearing
[1:46:38] thunders.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; Ah I'm you GOING TO MOVE THIS SERMON TO

[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; AND WHATEVER MOSES WAS HEARING,
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; HE WAS WRITING THAT DOWN.

[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:47:18] LORD,
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD. THERE IS NO
[1:47:25] OTHER GOD LIKE ME.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; THAT IS GOD AND MOSES.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; FACE TO FACE.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; BUT ISRAEL heard
[1:47:33] everybody say [laughter]
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO A PROPHET IN THE CALIBER OF
[1:47:43] MOSES MUST HAVE THE ABILITY TO
[1:47:46] UNDERSTAND THE THUNDER.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?

[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; GLORIFY THY NAME. THEN CAME A WHAT?
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; A VOICE FROM HEAVEN.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER, HE WAS NOT A THUNDER. HE WAS A

[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:48:39] [cheering]

[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; THAT STOOD BY. SO WHEN JESUS WAS
[1:49:33] TALKING, THERE WERE PEOPLE AROUND JESUS
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; AND THE VOICE CAME AND THE VOICE
[1:49:38] DELIVERED THE MESSAGE.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; BUT THE PEOPLE THAT STOOD BY, THEY DID
[1:49:43] WHAT?
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; SAID IT. Heard it.

[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; LORD,
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; WHAT CAME FROM HEAVEN WAS WHAT?
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; A VOICE.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; BUT WE NEED TO KNOW THE PEOPLE DIFFERENT
[1:49:57] THAN JESUS.

[1:50:02] THE PROPHET.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; A PROPHET LIKE UNTO [screaming] MOSES.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; IF MOSES UNDERSTOOD THE THUNDER,
[1:50:12] [applause and cheering]
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; JESUS MUST ALSO UNDERSTOOD THE THUNDER

[1:50:31] We need TO KNOW THEY HEARD WHAT?
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF WE STOP THE HEARD, we will
[1:50:35] say they heard the message.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; That's what we will say.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; What did you hear?
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; What did YOU HEAR?
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID THE PEOPLE heard it
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; and when THEY HEARD THEY GIVE US THEIR
[1:50:48] PROGNOSTIC
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; ABOUT WHAT THEY HEARD.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; SO WE ARE SUPPOSED TO HEAR FROM THOSE
[1:50:54] PEOPLE.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; I HAVE GLORIFIED YOU AND I WILL GLORIFY
[1:50:58] YOU AGAIN. BUT [screaming]

[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; SAID IT THUNDER.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; SO SOMEBODY WAS HEARING BOOM.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS NOT POOM. IT WAS A VOICE.

[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN HEAR THE NOISE,
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; BUT TO DECODE THE MESSAGE OF THE NOISE,
[1:51:40] YOU NEED A PROPHET.
[1:51:45] [cheering and applause]
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; NOT ANY TYPE OF PROPHET.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; A PROPHET AT THE LEVEL OF MOSES.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; SOME OF YOU ARE LOST. IF YOU LOST, RAISE
[1:52:00] YOUR HAND.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; A PROPHET TO THE CALIBER OF MOSES.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; SOME SAY THE HEARD WATER.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; If you respond good, I'm I'm working
[1:52:10] easily. If you don't respond good, then

[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [cheering and applause]
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; DO NOT LEAVE THIS CHURCH WITHOUT A BABY,
[1:53:02] MY FRIEND.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; WITHOUT A BABY, JESUS CHRIST.
[1:53:07] [cheering]
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; DON'T BE A SPECTATOR.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; NO, SIR.

[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; THE PEOPLE THAT STOOD BY, WHAT DID they
[1:53:30] heard?
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; The first group SAY THEY HEARD WHAT?
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; A thunder.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; The first group say they heard a what?
[1:53:37] THUNDER.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN GOD SPEAK,
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE WILL HEAR IT LIKE WHAT?
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; THUNDER.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S NOT FINISHED. THE SECOND GROUP,
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAY THERE [screaming]
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; THE SECOND GROUP SAY SOMETHING ELSE.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; THEY SAY WHAT HAPPENED?
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; THE ANGEL SPAKE TO HIM.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; SO THE VOICE OF GOD WHEN GOD SPEAK
[1:54:00] [cheering]
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; IT IS WHAT?
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; THUNDER OR AN ANGEL?
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; A THUNDER OR WHAT? AN ANGEL.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; IT IS A THUNDER OR WHAT?
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; AN ANGEL.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; IN REVELATION 10,
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; THE MIGHTY ANGEL CAME
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE SPOKE, THE VOICE CAME UP
[1:54:18] LIKE A THUNDER. THE ANGEL AND THE
[1:54:21] [screaming] THUNDER PUT TOGETHER. WE GOT
[1:54:24] THE WHOLE KAMURO. [cheering] YES, SIR.
[1:54:27] [applause]
[1:54:29] [screaming]
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? ARE WE TOGETHER? ARE WE
[1:54:33] TOGETHER?
[1:54:37] HAVE I LOST SOMEBODY?
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; THE VOICE OF God
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; will come as a angel.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; That's why you see a mighty angel came
[1:54:46] down.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; And when he roar,
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE ROAR, WHAT CAME OUT?
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; SEVEN THUNDERS.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; BUT NOTICE JOHN WAS ABOUT TO WRITE. SO
[1:54:57] JOHN UNDERSTOOD [cheering]
[1:55:06] AH,
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; you didn't get me well.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T GET me well.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION CHAPTER 10,
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; WE GOT THREE PEOPLE.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; We got the mighty angel.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; We got the mighty angel
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; who have the thunder.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; So these TWO ARE PUT TOGETHER IN ONE. WE
[1:55:31] GOT A MIGHTY ANGEL WITH A COVENANT.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; AND WE KNOW AN ANGEL WITH A COVENANT IS
[1:55:36] CHRIST.
[1:55:39] [cheering]
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU NOTICE, THE BIBLE SAY HE CAME
[1:55:43] WITH A CLOUD
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; IN REVELATION 10.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; WITH A CLOUD. SO THE CLOUD, THE MIGHTY
[1:55:51] ANGEL CRUSHED EVERYTHING PUT TOGETHER.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; THE SECOND PERSON IN REVELATION 10
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; IS ALSO REVELATION 10:7.
[1:56:03] WHICH IS THE SEVEN ANGEL.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; WHICH IS THE SEVEN ANGEL?
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; AND THE THIRD PERSON
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; IS JOHN.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; AND JOHN IS THE TOP OF THE BROTHER.
[1:56:28] SO FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE THUNDER,
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; YOU MUST BE IN ONE OF THE THREE.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; IF YOU ARE NOT [screaming] CHRIST, YOU
[1:56:36] MUST BE THE SEVEN ANGEL. IF YOU'RE NOT
[1:56:39] THE SEVEN ANGEL, YOU MUST BE A PART OF
[1:56:41] THE BRIDE. ONLY THE BRIDE UNDERSTAND THE
[1:56:45] THUNDERS.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:56:57] [applause and cheering]
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; THIS BIBLE THAT WE READ HERE,
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; THE CATHOLIC ARE READING IT.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; THE PROTESTANT ARE READING IT.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; THE PENTECOSTAL ARE READING IT.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; THE BAPTISTS ARE READING IT.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT THAN ALL OF
[1:57:17] THEM? BECAUSE YOU ARE HEARING THE
[1:57:20] THUNDERS.
[1:57:21] [cheering]
[1:57:27] [applause and cheering]
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU READ THE BIBLE, YOUR WAY OF
[1:57:31] READING IS DIFFERENT
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU ARE READING THE THUNDERS.
[1:57:42] [cheering]
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:57:49] I'M STILL CLIMBING WITH THE AIRPLANE.
[1:57:51] OKAY,
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; BROTHER. THE BIBLE SAYS THAT JESUS
[1:57:56] ANSWER and say this voice came not what?
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; Because of me.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; BUT HE CAME FOR WHO?
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; FOR YOUR SAINTS.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; SO THE MESSAGE WAS FOR WHO?
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; For the people.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT FOR JESUS.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE WAS FOR WHAT?
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; THE PEOPLE.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; JESUS WAS A MESSENGER.

[1:58:33] IN ORDER.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE IN THE BIBLE PERFECTLY IN
[1:58:39] ORDER.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY THAT IS WHAT THE
[1:58:42] BIBLE SAY.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; A CLAP OF WHAT? THUNDER.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; THEY THOUGHT HE WAS WHAT?
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; A THUNDER.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; BUT HE WAS WHO?
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; GOD.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; HE UNDERSTOOD IT.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; FOR IT WAS REVEALED TO HIM.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; HE WAS WHAT?
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; A THUNDER.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; JOHN HEARD THE THUNDERS.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; AND JOHN WANTED TO WRITE.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; JOHN WAS NOW GETTING READY TO WRITE.
[1:59:07] BOOM.
[1:59:09] [cheering]
[1:59:15] HE WAS NOT RIDING THE NOISE.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; HE WAS RIDING [screaming] THE MESSAGE
[1:59:19] [cheering]
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS IN THE NOISE.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; AND THEY TOLD HIM, "SIT UP.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; NOT CLOSE. DO WHAT?"
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; SO WHAT WAS IN THE SEALS?
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU OPEN THE SEAL, WHAT IS
[1:59:34] COMING UP?
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; THE THUNDERS.
[1:59:38] [cheering]
[1:59:41] THAT'S WHY BROTHER SAY THE OPENING OF
[1:59:45] THE SEVENTH SEAL REVEALED THE SEVEN
[1:59:47] THUNDERS.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; THERE WERE THE REVELATION UNDER THE
[1:59:51] SEALS.
[1:59:55] [cheering]
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; HAVE I LOST YOU?

[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; IF JOHN SEALED the thunder,
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; GOD DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY TO write about
[2:00:14] it.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; SO, WE NEED TO FIND SOMEBODY
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; WHO NEED TO INTERPRET TO US
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; what John say.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; BUT WE NEED THE PROOF
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; that you can hear it
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ANYBODY CAN INTERPRET ANYTHING.
[2:00:34] SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE GOD NEED TO
[2:00:37] SPEAK
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU HEAR WHAT GOD SAY
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; AND NOT SPEAKING LIKE I'm the LORD YOUR
[2:00:44] GOD.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; GOD MUST COME WITH A BLAST. BOOM.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; YOU MUST BE ABLE TO TELL US WHAT THE
[2:00:50] BLAST SAY.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T MIND HEARING THE NOISE.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; THIS IS OUR PART.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; IF YOU WANT TO INTERPRET THE NOISE, YOU
[2:00:58] NEED TO TELL US WHAT WAS IN THE NOISE.
[2:01:00] AMEN.

[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; and with water
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; and with Israel.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; So certain things Moses was riding.

[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; and water
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; and 40 nights.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; And he did neither eat
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; bread nor water.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Drink water.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; How many days?
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; 40 days.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; And how many nights?
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; 40 nights.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; Whoever done that in the Bible.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; So you understand who Moses was.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; The one who reproduced that
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; is Jesus Christ.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we clear now?
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; 40 days and 40 now he did need a what?
[2:04:23] Eat bread no water
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; drink water.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; And he your God wrote upon the table the
[2:04:29] word of water
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; the covenant
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; the water
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; the ten commandments.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; This is where we getting my friend. And
[2:04:35] it came to pass when Moses came down
[2:04:38] from the mountain with the two table of
[2:04:40] the testimony uhh in Moses hand. when he
[2:04:44] came down from the mountain that Moses
[2:04:47] knew not
[2:04:51] THAT THE SKIN OF WHERE
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; his face
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; my friend
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; stay up
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; the skin of what
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; his face
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; the face of Moses
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Moses was there
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; he was talking to God but his hand never
[2:05:11] uh give light
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; his body never give light.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; The light was only going to the face.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; And his face was looking at the face of
[2:05:21] God.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; So he looked at God so much.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; He looked at the similitude of God so
[2:05:28] much.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; HE STAYED TOO LONG BEFORE THE MAGNET.
[2:05:35] HE RUB AGAINST THE MAGNET SO much
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; that when he came off,
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; HE HAVE THE ABILITY TO BEGIN TO ATTRACT
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; ADAM.
[2:05:46] [cheering]
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; The way you looking at some of you are
[2:05:54] looking at me, it looks like I'm saying
[2:05:56] something that is not written in the
[2:05:57] Bible.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; Boys, we were playing with magnet
[2:06:01] before. If you get a metal
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; and you rub it in the magnet, you rub,
[2:06:06] you rub, you rub FOR SO LONG,
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; THE CAPACITY OF THE magnet will be
[2:06:12] transferred to THE METAL
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; AND THAT medal itself can go AND BEGIN
[2:06:16] TO ATTRACT OTHER MEDAL.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; IT IS NOT THE MEDAL ATTRACTING
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE BEFORE THE MEDAL DIDN'T HAVE THE
[2:06:24] ABILITY TO ATTRACT
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS THE MAGNET IN THE MIDDLE.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; IT IS NOW BROTHER BRAND PULLING YOU. IT
[2:06:31] IS THE MAGNET INSIDE BROTHER BRANA.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; HIS GRAMMAR WAS NOT GOOD.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; WE WENT TO SCHOOL MORE THAN BROTHER.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; HOW DO WE LISTEN TO A SERMON OF SOMEBODY
[2:06:49] WHO DIDN'T GO TO OUR level of SCHOOL
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE IS A
[2:06:54] MAGNET THERE.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN. MOSES DID NOT KNOW THAT HIS THE
[2:07:03] SKIN OF HIS FACE DID water
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; shown while he talked WITH HIM
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; WHILE HE TALKED WATER
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; WITH HIM.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE MAGNET ALREADY
[2:07:09] AFFECTED HIM.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; NOW WHAT KIND OF element was in Moses
[2:07:14] body
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; THAT HIS BODY BEGIN to shine
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE BODIES THAT SH are angelic
[2:07:22] BODIES
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; BUT THIS HUMAN BODY BEGIN to shine.
[2:07:28] IN OTHER WORDS, SOME ELEMENT from the
[2:07:30] pillar of fire
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; begin to enter
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; into the
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. AND MOSES BEGIN TO REFLECT THE
[2:07:44] pillar of fire.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORD, MOSES BECAME A LIGHT.
[2:07:54] WHEN IT'S NIGHT, MOSES DOESN'T NEED YOUR
[2:07:56] LIGHT.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; He's shining.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; MOSES DOESN'T NEED YOUR LIGHT IN DARK.
[2:08:07] HIS WHOLE FACE IS IS ILLUMINATING THE
[2:08:10] LIGHT.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; IF IF YOU CAN'T SWALLOW THIS, WE SKIP.
[2:08:15] WE wait till you grow up again.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; But I know you grown up already.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND VERSE 30. AND WHEN AARON AND
[2:08:25] ALL Israel saw Moses, behold the skin
[2:08:28] did what?
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; His face shone.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; And they were what?
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; AFRAID TO COME.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; EVEN AARON BECOME AFRAID. HE SAID, "HEY,
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BEGIN TO SHINE."
[2:08:39] Back up. What happened to you?
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; IS IT A GHOST OR A HUMAN BEING?
[2:08:45] [laughter]
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. verse uh uh uh 32 uh 31. AND MOSES
[2:08:55] CALLED THEM and Aaron and all the rulers
[2:08:58] of the congregation return to him. In
[2:09:01] other words, be not afraid.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; And Moses talked with them. AND
[2:09:05] AFTERWARD ALL THE CHILDREN of Israel did
[2:09:08] what?
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; Came.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; Ah. When the clergy stood up, they say,
[2:09:12] "Okay, nobody died." Ah, so let's get
[2:09:14] closer. Are we together?
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. They came near and he gave them
[2:09:18] what?
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; In commandment
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; of the Lord. Uh that the Lord has spoken
[2:09:22] where
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; with him on Mount Si.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; AND UNTIL MOSES HAS DONE SPEAKING WITH
[2:09:27] THEM, he did what?
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; He put a veil on his face.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; We understand this clearly.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN MOSES WANT TO TALK,
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; he removed the veil
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; and you see his face
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; and he talked to you.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together? AFTER MOSES FINISHED
[2:09:44] TALKING,
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; Moses take the veil and put back up.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; So when you see a man without a head
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; or a man that HAVE A HEAD THAT is veil,
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; it's Moses.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; The head or the face of Moses, his head
[2:10:05] was veil.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; His head was wrapped up.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; We clear? Amen. We clear?
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; VERSE 33. UNTIL MOSES done speaking with
[2:10:16] them, he put water,
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; a veil on his face.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN MOSES went in before the Lord
[2:10:22] to speak with him, he did what?
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; He took the veil off
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; until he did what?
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; He came out
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; and and he CAME OUT AND SPOKE TO THE
[2:10:29] CHILDREN of Israel that which was what
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; commanded.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; And the children of Israel saw the face
[2:10:36] of Moses that the skin of who? Moses
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; did what shown
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; and Moses put the veil upon his face
[2:10:43] until he went to speak with who?
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; WITH HIM.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; SO GOD AND MOSES SPOKE FACE TO FACE.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD IS TALKING TO MOSES, GOD REVEAL
[2:10:53] God remove his veil
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; and Moses also remove his veil
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; and both OF THEM ARE TALKING AND ONE IS
[2:11:00] CHARGING THE OTHER.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; You tired?
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; No. I preached yesterday so you should
[2:11:09] be more in strength than me. And one is
[2:11:12] charging the other. WHEN THE CHARGING IS
[2:11:14] FULL,
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; God unplug the charging.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; NOW MOSES HAVE NOW THE CAPACITY OF GOD
[2:11:25] IN HIM.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, GOD ALREADY TRANSFER
[2:11:29] HIMSELF
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; INTO MOSES.
[2:11:34] SO WHEN MOSES IS COMING DOWN FROM THE
[2:11:37] MOUNTAIN,
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; IT IS NO LONGER MOSES.
[2:11:52] BECAUSE NOW GOD [screaming]
[2:11:53] IN MOSES,
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; please let's stay refocused.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; Forget about the moving. FOCUS RIGHT
[2:12:01] HERE.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; WHENEVER GOD PUT THE CHARGING ON MOSES,
[2:12:05] I'm reading the Bible. If you finish the
[2:12:07] reading, we move on.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; WHENEVER WHENEVER GOD PUT the charging,
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; God take his energy,
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; his word
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; and transfer that to Moses
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; because Israel say WE DON'T WANT TO TALK
[2:12:20] TO THE GENERATOR.
[2:12:22] We can't stand THE GENERATOR. THE
[2:12:24] GENERATOR is boom boom boomh. We can't
[2:12:27] stand the boom boom. You You can stand
[2:12:30] the boom boom. You go over there.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; So Moses was a MEDIATOR
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; BETWEEN THE PEOPLE AND GOD.
[2:12:40] [cheering]
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; IS HE TOO STRONG? MOSES WAS THE MAN IN
[2:12:50] BETWEEN.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, THE PEOPLE TALKED TO
[2:12:55] MOSES AND MOSES GO TALK TO GOD AND GOD
[2:12:58] TALKED TO MOSES AND MOSES GO TALK TO
[2:13:01] PEOPLE. HE BECAME A GOING BETWEEN MAN.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO WHEN MOSES COME TO
[2:13:10] GOD, GOD SAY WHY AM I WASTING TIME? YOU
[2:13:13] GET ME in you
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; and you go.
[2:13:20] Are we together? SO WHEN MOSES IS COMING
[2:13:22] FROM THE MOUNTAIN, IT IS NO LONGER
[2:13:24] MOSES.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; IT IS MOSES WITH GOD.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; UNTIL MOSES DELIVERED THE MESSAGE, THEN
[2:13:36] HE BECOME MOSES.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY BROTHER BROWN SAY MOSES WAS
[2:13:45] THE VEIL. AMEN.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; THE LIVING WORD OF GOD VEILED WHERE?
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; BEHIND HUMAN FLESH.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; THE PILLAR OF FIRE [screaming] WAS IN
[2:13:56] MOSES.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM SWALLOWING THIS,
[2:14:03] WHAT IS COMING UP WILL choke you.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; THE PILL OF FIRE WAS WHERE?
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; IN MOSES. IN GOD IS OF COURSE SPEAKING
[2:14:12] OF WHAT WAS TO BE THERE WHEN
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; later behind skin.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORD MOSES WAS A PREFUGER OF
[2:14:19] JESUS CHRIST.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:14:24] [applause]
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?

[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; LAST SUNDAY,
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; WE SPOKE ABOUT HOW THE HOLY Ghost come
[2:15:26] to the Gentile.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; And we SEE THAT THE GENTILE HOLY GHOST
[2:15:32] DOESN'T GO WITH the laying on hand.
[2:15:35] THE HOLY GHOST COME through the
[2:15:37] preaching of the WORD
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JESUS SAY MY word
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; are spirit
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; and they ARE WHAT
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE LIFE. SO WHEN THE WORD IS
[2:15:48] COMING
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; THE LIFE OF GOD IS COMING
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; THE SPIRIT OF GOD IS COMING
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT ARE ONE
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; MESSAGE BELIEVER NEED TO GROW UP FROM
[2:16:00] THE PRAYER LINE.
[2:16:05] IT IS TAKING TOO LONG.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; HE WEARY THE PREACHER.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; THE PREACHER IS ALREADY WORN OUT BY THE
[2:16:13] PREACHING OF THE WORD AND HE'S GOING TO
[2:16:15] STAY ONE HOUR TO PRAY FOR EVERYBODY IN
[2:16:18] THE CONGREGATION. WE DON'T NEED THAT.
[2:16:22] WHEN THE WORD IS COMING WHERE YOU ARE,
[2:16:26] [cheering] GRAB ON TO GOD.
[2:16:31] I SENT MY WORD AND MY WORD HEAL THEM.
[2:16:36] [cheering]
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; YOUR HEALING IS IN THE WORD.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; THE WORD OF GOD [screaming] DISCERN
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; THE THOUGHTS AND THE INTENT OF THE
[2:16:44] HEART.
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; SO THE FIRST POOL HEALING
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; IS IN THE THIRD POOL.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; DISCERNMENT IS IN THE THIRD POOL. SO THE
[2:16:52] THIRD POOL GOT ALL THE POOLS.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; SO IF YOU HAVE THE WORD,
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT EVERYTHING.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:17:06] [cheering]
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE TODAY [screaming]
[2:17:08] YOU DON'T HEAR BOOM,
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE HEARING THE THUNDER.
[2:17:14] [cheering]
[2:17:15] [applause]
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:17:19] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[2:17:23] together? Young people,
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; like I told you,
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; never rely on the preacher
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; all the time to lay hand, lay hand, lay
[2:17:32] hand, lay hand, lay hand. The preacher
[2:17:36] doesn't have the Holy Ghost to give you.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost come from the source.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; I'M I'M GOING SOMEWHERE BECAUSE IF YOU
[2:17:49] GET IT FROM THE SOURCE, YOU DON'T CARE
[2:17:51] WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PREACHER. AMEN.
[2:17:54] [cheering]
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; WHETHER THEY PREACH A BACKSLID, THAT'S
[2:17:57] NOT YOUR PROBLEM. I GATHERED FROM THE
[2:18:00] ORIGINAL.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM SAYS THIS, MY FRIEND.
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BROTHER BRHAM SAYS THIS, MY
[2:18:12] FRIEND. THE SPIRIT OF GOD IS NOT
[2:18:15] SOMETHING THAT IT IS COOLING to you.
[2:18:23] Come with me. I will show you how the
[2:18:25] Holy Ghost operate.
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; How does the Holy Ghost operate?
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; So you become the stander of the Holy
[2:18:31] Ghost.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; Because the Holy Ghost make you tremble.
[2:18:34] Everybody will be trembling.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; If the Holy Spirit is in me, make me do
[2:18:41] this. So every preacher will begin to do
[2:18:44] this.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; And you see preacher begin to imitate
[2:18:47] preachers.
[2:18:53] THE HOLY GHOST IS THE ONE WHO CREATED
[2:18:56] YOU
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO YOUR NATURE.
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; STAY THE WAY YOU ARE.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; IF YOU QUIET, STAY QUIET.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; IF YOU TALK, THE HOLY GHOST WILL ANOINT

[2:19:21] YOU GET WATER
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; SCORED INTO YOU.
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS WHAT
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; predestinated into you.
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost WAS PREDESTINATED.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, BEFORE YOU WERE BORN,
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; GOD HAVE YOUR PORTION OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, IT'S THERE.
[2:19:42] RIGHT THERE.
[2:19:44] [cheering]
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; EVEN IF THE PREACHER DON'T WANT TO GIVE
[2:19:49] IT TO YOU
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; AND THE PREACHER say I don't like
[2:19:51] brother Angelo because brother Angelo is
[2:19:53] difficult and everything. That's the
[2:19:55] preacher opinion.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; IT IS NOT ABOUT WHO WANT IT.
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; IT'S ABOUT WHO DECLARE
[2:20:06] WHO DETERMINE WHO'S GOING TO HAVE IT.

[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; NO SIR.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; BY THE HAND OF A MAN.
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; BY THE HAND OF THE ONE DOING A LOT OF
[2:20:37] HEALING?

[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; What about if I don't feel chills?
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; Now I didn't receive the Holy Ghost
[2:20:59] BECAUSE WE WERE TRYING TO SCHOOL PEOPLE
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; on how to receive it.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; Yours might be falling on THE GROUND.
[2:21:07] MAN, IT'S NOT FALLING. IT'S SCREAMING.
[2:21:09] [screaming]

[2:23:21] SEEKING WATER
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; for the baptism of THE HOLY GHOST. MANY
[2:23:24] TIMES I RUN INTO PEOPLE
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; AND THEY SAY, "WELL, I have sought for
[2:23:29] the Holy Ghost. I just couldn't receive
[2:23:31] it. I don't believe it is for me."
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; Every time I get down, I do what?
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; I get sick.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; And I go to praying. IF I FAST, I do
[2:23:42] what?

[2:23:46] I get water.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; So sleepy,
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; I can't get OFF MY FEET. REMEMBER THAT
[2:23:50] IS WHO?
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL.
[2:23:55] SO WHEN YOU TRYING TO PRAY, YOU GET
[2:23:57] SLEEPY, JUST KNOW YOU WERE ABOUT DOING
[2:23:59] SOMETHING GOOD.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; IT'S AN INDICATOR
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; THAT SOMETHING IS THERE. THAT'S WHY THE
[2:24:05] DEVIL IS ATTACKING.
[2:24:09] [cheering]
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T MEAN STOP FASTING OR STOP
[2:24:14] PRAYING. IT TELLS YOU YOU'RE GOING TO
[2:24:16] THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
[2:24:19] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER THAT IS WHO?

[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; MANY TIME YOU FIND WHEN YOU ARE PRAYED
[2:24:33] FOR IN A MEETING FOR DIVINE HEALING.
[2:24:36] THEN THE NEXT DAY YOU FOUND OUT NO DOUBT
[2:24:38] THAT THE DEVIL WILL MAKE THAT
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; TWICE AS BAD AS
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; as he was what
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; THE DAY BEFORE.
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER THAT IS WHO?
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; JUST SATAN
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; TRYING TO DO WHAT? GET you away from the
[2:24:50] blessing that God HAS GOT FOR YOU.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU LISTEN TO THAT FELLOW. ALWAYS

[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF WE TOGETHER.
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF WE TOGETHER.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; I was praying and I fell asleep. No
[2:25:14] problem. So I understand. No problem.
[2:25:17] Ah, devil. So I fell asleep. Ah, so
[2:25:19] something is good. I'm going back again.
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; I'm going back AGAIN BECAUSE I REALIZE
[2:25:28] WHAT I'M DOING IS BOTHERING YOU.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; SO I'M IN THE RIGHT CHANNEL. [cheering]
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; WHY ARE YOU MAKING THE SICKNESS TWICE
[2:25:40] BAD?
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; Because he doesn't want to believe.
[2:25:43] because your belief begin to remove his
[2:25:45] uh his hand already.
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; SO HE NEED TO MULTIPLY the symptom for
[2:25:50] you to BELIEVE THAT HE'S STILL THERE
[2:25:52] WHEN HE'S ALREADY giving away.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; And when you begin to believe him, HE
[2:25:57] COMES BACK AGAIN.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; Exactly right.
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; WHEN WE TALKING ABOUT THIS HOLY GHOST,

[2:26:23] you didn't choose yourself.
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU HAVE NOT WHAT?
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; CHOSEN ME.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; BUT WHO?
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; I have chosen you.
[2:26:34] &gt;&gt; I who chose
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; I have chosen you
[2:26:38] &gt;&gt; and did what?

[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; ORDAIN YOU THAT YOU SHOULD GO AND DO

[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; to do what?
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; To bring forth what? fruit
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; to bring a baby.
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; SO IF THE BABY DOESN'T COME,
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; whose fault is it?
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; He must have done something wrong in
[2:27:24] eternity.
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; Because whenever he does something, it
[2:27:27] must happen.
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; AND GOD ALREADY CHOSEN YOU. IN OTHER
[2:27:32] WORDS, GOD PICKED you
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; and God wired you

[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; CONDEMN
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; FORCE
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; TO BRING FORTH FRUIT.
[2:27:58] IN OTHER WORDS, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT
[2:28:00] THE DEVIL WILL DO.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; THERE WILL COME A TIME FRUIT MUST COME.
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; AND IF THEY ORDAIN YOU TO BRING FORTH
[2:28:12] FRUIT,
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; IT MEANS THE FRUIT IS ALREADY IN YOU.
[2:28:17] [cheering]
[2:28:25] WHAT YOU NEED IS JUST THE SEASON
[2:28:29] [cheering]
[2:28:30] [applause]
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE FRUIT
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; YES LORD
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; COMES IN SEASON.
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; WHENEVER THE SEASON COME, YOU DON'T HELP
[2:28:38] THE TREE.

[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; THE TREE WILL BRING ITSELF FRUIT
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; ABUNDANTLY. [cheering]
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; ABUNDANTLY, MY FRIEND.

[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; WHEN WE SAY ORDAIN, you should be even
[2:28:59] screaming.
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE IS TWO WAYS TO BE
[2:29:05] ORDAINED.
[2:29:10] &gt;&gt; IN THE BOOK OF WHAT?
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; ACTS
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; verse what?
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; 13.
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; CHAPTER 13:48. WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY?
[2:29:17] AND WHEN THE JEWS,
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; GENTILES,

[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; You are a Jew spiritually?
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; AH. WHENEVER THE GENTILE HEARD THIS,
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE HOW?
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; GLAD
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; AND DID WHAT?
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; GLORIFIED.
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; SO THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE
[2:29:42] GENTILE. WHEN THE WORD IS COMING, THE
[2:29:45] WORD IS REJOICING THEM.
[2:29:51] [cheering and applause]
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE WORD WAS COMING TO THEM,
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; HUH?
[2:29:57] &gt;&gt; THE ONE WHO CAME HOME UPSET SUDDENLY
[2:30:01] GOES.
[2:30:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [cheering and applause]
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:30:11] HALLELUJAH.
[2:30:14] IT'S AN
[2:30:15] &gt;&gt; INDICATOR.
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; HE INDICATES SOMETHING IS IN YOU.
[2:30:21] [cheering]
[2:30:27] &gt;&gt; YOU EVEN FORGET THAT YOU WERE TIRED.
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; YOU EVEN FORGET YOU DIDN'T SLEEP RIGHT.
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; IT LOOKS LIKE ALL THE SLEEPNESS IS GOING

[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I see it. I SEE IT NOW. AH,
[2:30:42] [screaming] GLORY TO GOD.
[2:30:45] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; THE GENTILE WHO RECEIVED THE WORD HOW?
[2:30:51] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY A DEAD CHURCH IS A PROBLEM.
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; THE GENTILE RECEIVED IT. HOW?
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; GLAD.
[2:31:03] &gt;&gt; AND THEY DID WHAT?
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; GLORIFIED the word of the Lord.
[2:31:06] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN THE GENTILE WERE
[2:31:08] COMING, THEY SAID, "DID YOU HEAR THAT?
[2:31:09] AMEN.
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; DID YOU HEAR TODAY?
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SISTER, YOU HEARD IT,
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; BROTHER ANGELO. I NEVER SEEN THAT.
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; I'M TELLING YOU THE SERMON WE GOT. OH,
[2:31:19] GLORY TO GOD.
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; IT'S AN INDICATOR THAT YOU ARE SOMEBODY.
[2:31:26] [cheering]
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; I hope WE ARE TOGETHER.
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; WHEN THEY HEARD THAT THEY DID WHAT?
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; GLORIFIED THE word of THE LORD.
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; AND AS MANY AS WAS WHAT? ORDAINED TO
[2:31:40] ETERNAL LIFE.
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; THEY DID WHAT?
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; BELIEVE.
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; SO TO BE ORDAINED, IN OTHER WORDS,
[2:31:44] ETERNAL LIFE IS SEARCHING FOR YOU.
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE YOU?
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE? OPEN UP.
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; ORDAINED TO [screaming] ETERNAL LIFE.
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; HOW DO I KNOW I'M ORDAINED? WHEN THE
[2:32:00] WORD COME, WATCH YOUR REACTION.
[2:32:06] &gt;&gt; WATCH YOUR REACTION TO THE WORD. IF THE
[2:32:09] WORD IS CHANGING YOU,
[2:32:11] &gt;&gt; MOLDING YOU,
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; MAKING YOU FEEL WARM, SIR,
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; HAPPY, JOYFUL, YOU SAY AH, [screaming]
[2:32:19] [cheering] ETERNAL LIFE IS HERE. ETERNAL
[2:32:23] LIFE IS PULLING ETERNAL LIFE. ETERNAL
[2:32:27] LIFE IS COMING TO ETERNAL LIFE.
[2:32:29] [cheering]
[2:32:30] [applause]
[2:32:35] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:32:43] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THE BIBLE SAY I HAVE ordained
[2:32:45] you
[2:32:47] &gt;&gt; to bring forth fruit,
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; we can go to sleep.
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; You can tell the devil, listen, my
[2:32:54] friend,
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; keep wasting your time.
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; But I will prove you. I say, look at
[2:33:01] this.
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it.
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; You remember how many time I was upset?
[2:33:04] Uh-huh.
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; Have you ever seen since 6 months, do
[2:33:08] you ever seen me getting upset?
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; I told you
[2:33:11] &gt;&gt; I was ordained
[2:33:14] &gt;&gt; to produce temperance,
[2:33:16] &gt;&gt; to produce patience, to produce
[2:33:19] longsuffering.
[2:33:21] &gt;&gt; And as a MATTER OF FACT, YOUR TRIAL HELP
[2:33:24] ME PUSH QUICKLY.
[2:33:26] [cheering]
[2:33:28] YES, SIR.
[2:33:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:33:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:33:32] BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE
[2:33:34] NOT ORDAINED LIKE YOU.
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS IN THE BOOK OF JUDE, FOR
[2:33:39] THERE ARE CERTAIN MEN THAT DID WHAT?
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; Prepped and unawares.
[2:33:43] &gt;&gt; Who were BEFORE WHAT?
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; OF OLD.
[2:33:45] &gt;&gt; WHERE?
[2:33:45] &gt;&gt; Ordained to THIS CONDEMNATION.
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; OR ORDAINED TO THIS CONDEMNATION. WHAT
[2:33:50] MAN?
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; UNGODLINESS.
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; SO SOME PEOPLE ARE ORDAINED TO GO TO
[2:33:54] HELL.
[2:34:00] SO IF I SEE YOU WRESTLING WITH THE
[2:34:02] MESSAGE TOO MUCH,
[2:34:04] &gt;&gt; it's normal.
[2:34:05] &gt;&gt; I don't know how you ordain,
[2:34:09] &gt;&gt; but I won't go to hell with you.
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? AND JESUS SAID, I HAVE
[2:34:16] ORDAINED YOU
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; AND I HAVE ALSO CHOSEN YOU.
[2:34:24] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL WHEN THEY SAY
[2:34:27] CHOSEN YOU.
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; THERE IS CHOSEN AND CHOSEN.
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:34:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; Look at THIS MY FRIEND. THE BIBLE SAYS
[2:34:38] IN JOHN 6 VERSE WHAT?
[2:34:41] &gt;&gt; 70 AND WHAT?
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; 71.
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; JESUS ANSWERED THEM, "HAVE I NOT CHOSE
[2:34:46] YOU?" HOW MANY?
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; 12.
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; AND ONE OF YOU IS A DEVIL.
[2:34:53] SO THEY CHOSE 11 GOOD AND ONE A DEVIL
[2:34:57] &gt;&gt; BUT CHOSEN BY GOD.
[2:34:59] &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU NOTICE IT'S IN JOHN 6.
[2:35:05] &gt;&gt; YES SIR.
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; BUT JESUS WAS TALKING TO THE DISCIPLE IN
[2:35:09] JOHN 15.
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; BETWEEN JOHN 6 AND 15 SOMETHING
[2:35:15] HAPPENED.
[2:35:20] AH
[2:35:22] &gt;&gt; IN JOHN 6 HE SAY I CHOSEN ALL OF YOU
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; but one of you is a devil
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; and THE DEVIL THE BIBLE SAY HE SPAKE OF
[2:35:32] WHO?
[2:35:32] &gt;&gt; Judas the scariot
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; the son of what?
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; Simon
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; for he WAS THAT SHOULD DO WHAT?
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; Betray him
[2:35:38] &gt;&gt; being one of what?
[2:35:39] &gt;&gt; The 12.
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; THAT IS IN JOHN 6.
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; IN JOHN 13
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; BEFORE JOHN 15.
[2:35:49] Jesus says Jesus answered here it IS
[2:35:53] &gt;&gt; TO WHOM I SHALL GIVE WHAT
[2:35:55] &gt;&gt; A soap
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; when I have dipped it. AND WHEN HE HAD
[2:35:58] DIPPED THE SOAP HE GAVE IT TO WHO?
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; JUDAS A SCARIOT.
[2:36:02] &gt;&gt; THE SON OF WHOM?
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; SIMON.
[2:36:04] &gt;&gt; AND AFTER THE SUMP
[2:36:06] &gt;&gt; SATAN DID WHAT?
[2:36:08] &gt;&gt; ENTERED INTO HIM.
[2:36:08] &gt;&gt; SO SATAN ENTERED JUDAH IN JOHN 13
[2:36:13] &gt;&gt; BEFORE JOHN 14.
[2:36:15] BEFORE JOHN 15,
[2:36:17] &gt;&gt; SATAN ENTER HIM. THEN SAY JESUS UNTO
[2:36:20] HIM, THAT THAT DOEST DO WHAT?
[2:36:23] &gt;&gt; QUICKLY.
[2:36:23] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, GO ahead and do it
[2:36:25] quickly. You are anointed now.
[2:36:27] &gt;&gt; YOU RECEIVE YOUR BAPTISM.
[2:36:28] &gt;&gt; GO AHEAD AND DO IT QUICKLY.
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:36:32] &gt;&gt; He then having received the water,
[2:36:34] &gt;&gt; the
[2:36:35] &gt;&gt; did what?
[2:36:36] &gt;&gt; Went immediately out.
[2:36:37] &gt;&gt; And he WAS WHAT?
[2:36:38] &gt;&gt; NINE.
[2:36:38] &gt;&gt; SO JUDAH LEFT.
[2:36:40] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY DISCIPLE WAS REMAINING?
[2:36:42] &gt;&gt; 11. 11 REMAINING. WHEN JUDAH [screaming]
[2:36:45] LEFT,
[2:36:47] &gt;&gt; JESUS CHANGED THE LANGUAGE.
[2:36:56] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU ARE WE TOGETHER? WHEN JUDAH
[2:36:59] LEFT, WE ARE NOW IN JOHN 15. THIS IS
[2:37:03] WHEN JESUS SAY, "I LOVE [screaming]
[2:37:04] YOU."
[2:37:05] &gt;&gt; IT'S A DIFFERENT CHOOSING. I HAVE CHOSEN
[2:37:08] YOU.
[2:37:09] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JUDAH IS ALREADY GONE
[2:37:11] &gt;&gt; TO BRING FAR FRUIT.
[2:37:13] &gt;&gt; JUDAH COULD NOT BRING THAT FRUIT.
[2:37:16] &gt;&gt; SO JESUS WAITED
[2:37:19] &gt;&gt; AND CREATED A SCENARIO TO PULL JUDAH
[2:37:23] OUT. [screaming]
[2:37:27] &gt;&gt; PUT YOUR SEAT BELT. I'M GOING TO DROP
[2:37:28] SOMETHING.
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO DROP A ROCKET.
[2:37:32] &gt;&gt; JUDAH WAS PART OF THE MINISTRY OF JESUS.
[2:37:35] HE WAS PREACHING THE MESSAGE OF THE
[2:37:37] HOUR.
[2:37:38] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE WAS PREACHING THE MESSAGE OF
[2:37:40] THE HOUR,
[2:37:41] &gt;&gt; JESUS SAID, "I CHOSE ALL OF YOU.
[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; All of you are my preacher.
[2:37:45] &gt;&gt; There's no problem."
[2:37:47] &gt;&gt; BUT JESUS KNEW THAT SOME OF THEM WILL
[2:37:49] LEAVE THE MESSAGE.
[2:37:57] &gt;&gt; SO THERE WERE CERTAIN MESSAGES JESUS
[2:38:00] COULD NOT DELIVER AS LONG AS JUDAH IS
[2:38:03] STILL AROUND.
[2:38:08] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:38:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:38:10] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN JUDAH LEFT,
[2:38:12] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:38:13] &gt;&gt; WHEN JUDAH LEAVE THE MESSAGE,
[2:38:16] &gt;&gt; THEN JESUS CHANGED
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT ALL OF THEM THAT
[2:38:20] REMAIN
[2:38:21] &gt;&gt; ARE THE TRUE SEED.
[2:38:24] &gt;&gt; THEN JUDAH
[2:38:26] THEN JESUS OPEN UP AND SAY, "HEY, I HAVE
[2:38:28] A MYSTERY. ALL OF YOU, YOU WERE CHOSEN
[2:38:32] &gt;&gt; AND ORDAINED. TO BRING FORTH FRUIT.
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; IF YOU NOTICE, ALL OF THEM MADE IT TO
[2:38:41] PENTECOST
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; EXCEPT JUDAH.
[2:38:46] &gt;&gt; SO THIS CHOOSING WAS NOT FOR JUDAH.
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE CHOOSING OF THE ELECT.
[2:38:53] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE are together. Amen.
[2:38:54] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. AMEN. AND JESUS
[2:38:56] SAY, I HAVE CHOSEN YOU TO BRING FORTH
[2:38:59] WHAT? FRUIT.
[2:39:00] &gt;&gt; AND THAT YOUR FRUIT WILL DO WHAT?
[2:39:03] REMAIN.
[2:39:04] &gt;&gt; SO YOUR FRUIT DOESN'T GET DAMAGED.
[2:39:09] &gt;&gt; THE FRUIT THAT YOU WILL BRING
[2:39:11] &gt;&gt; IS ETERNAL. [cheering]
[2:39:16] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me, my friend.
[2:39:19] &gt;&gt; WHAT GOD PLANTED IN YOU,
[2:39:21] &gt;&gt; WHENEVER IT'S GOING TO COME OUT, it will
[2:39:24] never be destroyed.
[2:39:26] &gt;&gt; You will TAKE IT THROUGH ETERNITY.
[2:39:28] IN OTHER WORDS, GOD WILL REVEAL THE TRUE
[2:39:31] YOU
[2:39:32] &gt;&gt; AND THE TRUE YOU THAT WILL BE REVEALED
[2:39:35] IS THE ONE THAT WILL LIVE ETERNALLY.
[2:39:40] &gt;&gt; I hope we are togetherh
[2:39:43] &gt;&gt; and YOU WILL AND AND THE BIBLE SAYS HERE
[2:39:47] HE SAID YOU SHOULD BRING FRUIT THAT YOUR
[2:39:49] FRUIT SINGULAR
[2:39:51] &gt;&gt; SHOULD DO WHAT REMAIN
[2:39:53] &gt;&gt; AND THAT WHATSOEVER [screaming]
[2:39:55] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T GIVE IT TO JUDAH.
[2:40:00] HE DIDN'T GIVE IT TO JUDAH
[2:40:01] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JUDAH WILL BEGIN TO CREATE.
[2:40:06] &gt;&gt; He can't GIVE IT TO JUDAH.
[2:40:08] &gt;&gt; ONLY A CERTAIN TYPE OF PEOPLE
[2:40:10] &gt;&gt; THAT WHATSOEVER THEY ASK.
[2:40:14] &gt;&gt; WHATSOEVER THEY ASK WHAT?
[2:40:17] &gt;&gt; MY FATHER
[2:40:17] &gt;&gt; in what?
[2:40:18] &gt;&gt; IN MY NAME,
[2:40:19] &gt;&gt; HE MAY DO WHAT?
[2:40:20] &gt;&gt; GIVE IT TO YOU.
[2:40:21] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:40:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:40:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:40:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:40:23] &gt;&gt; IF YOU NOTICE THAT FRUIT IS SINGULAR.
[2:40:25] &gt;&gt; YES, IT IS.
[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[2:40:29] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS IN THE ANOINTED
[2:40:31] ONE AND THE END TIME HE SAY WHAT IS THE
[2:40:34] FRUIT?
[2:40:35] &gt;&gt; THE FRUIT IS WHAT?
[2:40:36] &gt;&gt; The word.
[2:40:41] [laughter]
[2:40:47] &gt;&gt; You cannot leave this message
[2:40:49] &gt;&gt; if the message was not in you.
[2:40:55] The reason why you leaving the message,
[2:40:58] the message was already new. What came
[2:41:00] to you came only to open the package.
[2:41:05] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me. Well,
[2:41:07] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST THAT come to you is
[2:41:09] coming to crank THE CAR.
[2:41:11] &gt;&gt; THE CAR IS in you.
[2:41:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said FRUIT FOR WHAT?
[2:41:21] &gt;&gt; NOT ANY TYPE OF FRUIT. THE FRUIT of the
[2:41:23] season. WHAT IS IT? THE WHAT?
[2:41:25] &gt;&gt; TEACHING.
[2:41:26] &gt;&gt; THE TEACHING OF WHAT? THE TEACHING OF
[2:41:29] WHAT?
[2:41:29] &gt;&gt; THE SEASON.
[2:41:30] &gt;&gt; WHAT TIME IT IS? MEN'S DOCTRINE,
[2:41:32] DENOMINATIONAL or what?
[2:41:34] &gt;&gt; God's word for the season.
[2:41:35] &gt;&gt; IN EPHESIANS 2:10, THE BIBLE SAY, "FOR
[2:41:38] WE ARE WHAT?"
[2:41:39] &gt;&gt; HIS WORKMANSHIP
[2:41:41] &gt;&gt; CREATED IN CHRIST JESUS UNTO WHAT?
[2:41:43] &gt;&gt; GOOD WORKS.
[2:41:44] &gt;&gt; SO THEY created you for what?
[2:41:45] &gt;&gt; Good works.
[2:41:47] &gt;&gt; What do you have to fabricate?
[2:41:50] Because works is the expression of
[2:41:52] faith.
[2:41:54] &gt;&gt; Faith is [laughter]
[2:41:55] works is faith expressed.
[2:41:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:41:57] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I HAVE PREDESTINATED YOU UNTO
[2:42:00] GOOD WORK WHICH GOD [screaming]
[2:42:02] HAS WHAT
[2:42:03] &gt;&gt; before ordained."
[2:42:04] &gt;&gt; SO EVEN YOUR GOOD WORK WERE ORDAINED.
[2:42:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:42:13] A robot cannot produce anything else but
[2:42:17] the program that was put in a robot.
[2:42:20] &gt;&gt; You won't produce anything else but what
[2:42:24] God put in you.
[2:42:25] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T HELP IT BUT TO
[2:42:27] LEAVE THE MESSAGE.
[2:42:30] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T HELP IT. YOU JUST
[2:42:32] HAVE TO BE IN THE MESSAGE. NO MATTER HOW
[2:42:35] MANY PEOPLE ARE LEAVING, YOU FEEL LIKE
[2:42:36] WHERE SHOULD I GO? I CAN JUST I CAN'T
[2:42:38] GO. NO, I HAVE TO JUST REMAIN IN THE
[2:42:40] MESSAGE BECAUSE YOU WERE PROGRAMMED
[2:42:43] MANUFACTURED FOR THE MESSAGE OF THE
[2:42:45] HOUR. [applause and cheering]
[2:42:51] [screaming]
[2:42:51] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:42:53] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:42:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:42:54] &gt;&gt; MY TIME IS FINISHED.
[2:43:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[2:43:02] &gt;&gt; Now I want to begin the parable.
[2:43:12] &gt;&gt; So you want to do it next Sunday.
[2:43:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:43:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:43:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:43:20] &gt;&gt; You needed to understand this part
[2:43:23] &gt;&gt; before we get in the parable.
[2:43:29] &gt;&gt; The parable of the 10 pound.
[2:43:36] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[2:43:41] &gt;&gt; I have a friend. I have a friend.
[2:43:47] &gt;&gt; Why do you do me like this? Just come up
[2:43:49] with one answer. [laughter]
[2:43:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:55] &gt;&gt; I'm already past 9 minute.
[2:44:00] So if I start right now 2:00 because we
[2:44:04] need to understand why is that face of
[2:44:06] Moses block
[2:44:08] &gt;&gt; and what does he have to do with this
[2:44:09] parable.
[2:44:12] &gt;&gt; Let's stop here.
[2:44:15] &gt;&gt; Now the amen are going. [laughter]
[2:44:22] Are we together? If I spill right now,
[2:44:26] if I open up right now, you will feel,
[2:44:29] you will spill the food
[2:44:31] &gt;&gt; because what is coming up is a different
[2:44:33] category. But God wanted you to
[2:44:35] understand that you a special type of
[2:44:37] people.
[2:44:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:44:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together? That's why he say of
[2:44:44] all the father has given me,
[2:44:47] &gt;&gt; I have lost what?
[2:44:50] &gt;&gt; Except
[2:44:55] except Judas.
[2:44:57] &gt;&gt; Because in the parable you will see one
[2:45:00] of them is wicked.
[2:45:01] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[2:45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:45:06] &gt;&gt; One of them will be a wicked.
[2:45:08] &gt;&gt; SO IT'S NOT strange to have wicked in
[2:45:11] the message.
[2:45:14] [cheering]
[2:45:18] &gt;&gt; I have to close because you pulling
[2:45:19] again. Amen. AMEN.
[2:45:22] &gt;&gt; IT IS NOT STRANGE BECAUSE WE GOT TO GROW
[2:45:25] UP NOW
[2:45:26] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE A DISASTER. OH,
[2:45:28] did you know, brother? UHHUH.
[2:45:31] [screaming]
[2:45:32] A TRUE MESSAGE OF GOD HAS TWO GROUPS
[2:45:37] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE EVERY REVIVAL BRINGS TWINS.
[2:45:43] BUT WHEN WE GET CLOSER TO THE HARVEST,
[2:45:46] &gt;&gt; WHEN WE GET CLOSER TO THE TIME OF THE
[2:45:49] GOING,
[2:45:50] &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY MUST SHOW THEIR COLOR.
[2:45:53] &gt;&gt; THE WHEAT HAVE TO BE TAKEN OUT
[2:45:56] &gt;&gt; SO THE CHILDREN OF GOD CAN BEGIN TO GROW
[2:45:59] CORRECTLY.
[2:46:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together? ARE WE TOGETHER? SO
[2:46:05] WHEN YOU HEAR PEOPLE LIVING THE MESSAGE,
[2:46:08] YOU NEED TO EVEN PRAISE GOD.
[2:46:11] YOU SAY, "PRAISE THE LORD. WE ARE IN THE
[2:46:13] TRUTH." [cheering]
[2:46:18] &gt;&gt; I KNOW IT STRONG.
[2:46:20] &gt;&gt; I KNOW IT STRONG.
[2:46:22] &gt;&gt; WHO OF THE DISCIPLE was praying for
[2:46:24] Judah?
[2:46:25] &gt;&gt; He said, "Lord Jesus Christ, we pray,
[2:46:27] please restore Judah, our brother."
[2:46:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, are we together? We will pray for
[2:46:36] our loved one. I know that because some
[2:46:38] of you are shaking already. I know that.
[2:46:41] BUT IF A MAN BEGIN TO BLASPHE AGAINST
[2:46:43] THIS MESSAGE,
[2:46:47] &gt;&gt; I WONDER WHAT SEED IS IT.
[2:46:51] &gt;&gt; AN ELECT BLASPHEM THE MESSAGE.
[2:46:54] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN STRUGGLE AND BACKSLID, BUT IF
[2:46:57] YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING, YOUR MOUTH
[2:46:59] WILL BE SHUT.
[2:47:02] [cheering]
[2:47:06] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? ARE WE TOGETHER? SO THE
[2:47:09] PROBLEM IS KNOWING WHO YOU ARE.
[2:47:12] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE ORDAINED [screaming] BY GOD.
