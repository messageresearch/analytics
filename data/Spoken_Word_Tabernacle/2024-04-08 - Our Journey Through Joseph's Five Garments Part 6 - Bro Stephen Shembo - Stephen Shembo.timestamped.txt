[55:21] scripture and pick up where we left on
[55:24] Sunday amen
[55:27] Glory Glory Glory
[55:30] Glory what a wonderful service on
[55:33] Wednesday Wednesday is like a
[55:37] [Laughter]
[55:39] convention amen Wednesday it's our
[55:45] convention Glory Glory same scripture
[55:48] again Genesis 49 verse 22 I believe you
[55:53] can hear me
[55:55] okay am amen amen all right praise
[56:01] God Genesis 49 verse 202 if you there
[56:05] you can say
[56:06] amen glory to God the Bible says Joseph
[56:11] is a fruitful bow you remember this now
[56:15] amen even a fruitful Bow by a well so
[56:20] this boy will never run dry no matter
[56:24] what you do he has a permanent well that
[56:27] is following him wherever you put him
[56:30] whether it's in the wilderness or
[56:32] whichever place he will Blossom because
[56:34] he have an internal resource where he's
[56:38] drawing water moisture from so he
[56:41] doesn't care about the weather amen
[56:44] glory to God you might be seated whose
[56:47] branches run over the wall so he's
[56:49] blessing you cannot stop it even if you
[56:52] put a fence his cup always run over amen
[56:56] amen that's what David says and the
[56:59] Bible says in verse 23 The Archers which
[57:01] are his brother have sorely grieved him
[57:05] and shed him and hated him we went
[57:08] through this but despite The Grieving
[57:12] despite the shooting despite the hatred
[57:16] but his b AB in
[57:19] strength so nothing change even though
[57:23] you hurt it doesn't mean that your Holy
[57:25] Ghost have decreased because you in
[57:28] pain you are still until the day of what
[57:33] so it doesn't mean that because you're
[57:34] crying your Holy Ghost is decreasing or
[57:37] your battery is getting low it's an
[57:38] internal
[57:40] battery amen he say his bow he bow in
[57:45] strength and the arm of his hands were
[57:48] made Strong by the hands of the Mighty
[57:52] God of
[57:53] Jacob amen the same God God of Abraham
[57:57] Isaac Jacob the same is the god of
[57:59] Joseph from there is the
[58:03] shepherd the
[58:05] stone of
[58:09] Israel if you will become yes go ahead
[58:12] my friend say
[58:14] Amen if from Joseph is coming the
[58:20] shepherd and the stone of Israel is
[58:23] coming even from
[58:25] there
[58:27] what do you think the devil will be with
[58:29] Joseph love
[58:32] him verse 25 even by the god of your
[58:37] father who Jacob or Israel who shall
[58:41] help you and by the almighty who shall
[58:44] bless you with blessings plural of the
[58:47] heaven above blessings of the deep that
[58:50] lies under blessings of the breast and
[58:54] of the womb the blessings of your father
[58:58] have prevailed above the blessings of my
[59:01] progenitors Abraham and Isaac to the
[59:05] utmost bound of the Everlasting Hill
[59:09] they shall be on the head of Joseph and
[59:13] we found out that Joseph his Blessing is
[59:17] greater than
[59:20] Jacob don't worry it's greater than
[59:24] Isaac it is greater than Abraham but
[59:29] when I say greater than Jacob you had a
[59:32] problem do you remember he saw a
[59:35] dream and in the dream he saw the Sun
[59:37] and the
[59:38] Moon they were doing what and his father
[59:43] say you think that me and your mother so
[59:48] in the Zodiac his father is bowing
[59:54] down so he's blessing is above his
[59:58] father now are we okay now are we are we
[1:00:02] did you get your answer so the blessing
[1:00:04] of Joseph is above Jacob Jacob have to
[1:00:08] bow down and it's above Isaac and it's
[1:00:10] above
[1:00:15] Abraham that's why he's a perfect type
[1:00:19] of
[1:00:22] Christ in other word he can only reach
[1:00:24] Christ
[1:00:27] only Christ can be
[1:00:29] this because of his fullness we all
[1:00:34] receive a portion
[1:00:37] amen the Bible says they shall be on the
[1:00:40] head of Joseph and on the crown of the
[1:00:44] head of him that was what separate from
[1:00:47] what his Breen why do they have to
[1:00:48] repeat that word separate from his
[1:00:51] brother they put the blessing they put
[1:00:53] the blessing they say they put the
[1:00:54] blessing on you because you were
[1:00:56] separate from your brother in other word
[1:00:59] they anoint you they anoint you and they
[1:01:01] sit down they say you receiving all of
[1:01:03] this because you were separated from
[1:01:05] your brother so is that separation good
[1:01:08] or
[1:01:12] bad do you see now amen so no separation
[1:01:15] no overflowing of
[1:01:18] blessings everything work together for
[1:01:21] good let's go to act chapter
[1:01:24] 7 even if you go to the uh the book of
[1:01:28] Deuteronomy that we read last Sunday you
[1:01:30] will see Moses saying whom has been
[1:01:33] separated from his brother they keep
[1:01:35] repeating
[1:01:37] that so that separation is very
[1:01:41] important even though we don't like it
[1:01:44] amen amen but brother Bram say God
[1:01:47] sometime he speak
[1:01:50] things
[1:01:53] purposely to make people go
[1:01:58] I have the qu brother Bram say God
[1:02:02] purposely Jesus was speaking things to
[1:02:05] weed down amen the crowd amen I have the
[1:02:10] quot amen please remind me and I'll put

[1:02:40] I'm not going to be the one shooting no
[1:02:42] it is the holy spirit doing that if I do
[1:02:46] it then it's manmade we don't want that
[1:02:49] sir because that one is whoever is not
[1:02:51] smiling at me get the bullet HH we don't
[1:02:54] want that we want the Holy Spirit who
[1:02:56] knows the heart of the
[1:03:00] people and do you know that Jesus never
[1:03:02] even stopped there after he finished he
[1:03:05] turned around to his disciple he say do
[1:03:07] you want to go
[1:03:09] also if I say that here they will put me
[1:03:12] on Tik
[1:03:13] Tok the pastor is chasing people Jesus

[1:03:53] denomination there is no
[1:03:58] am that's how you start I'm trying to
[1:04:00] read the
[1:04:03] scripture oh my let's go to Acts chapter
[1:04:06] 7 Oh Glory to
[1:04:09] God verse 9 if you dare you can say amen
[1:04:13] amen and the patriarch moved with what
[1:04:16] Envy clear jealousy and sold Joseph into
[1:04:19] what
[1:04:21] Egypt you know when we say sell Joseph
[1:04:24] to Egypt sometime we don't don't really
[1:04:26] understand but let's see if we will find
[1:04:28] they sold him to
[1:04:34] Egypt what has Egypt
[1:04:39] represent praise God he say and sold him
[1:04:44] into Egypt
[1:04:48] but I love the but in the Bible but God
[1:04:53] was with
[1:04:56] God was with him when they sold him
[1:05:01] amen when they are telling you God is
[1:05:03] there
[1:05:06] am even though he looks like God is not
[1:05:09] there because our way of understanding
[1:05:12] God is there we want to see okay if they
[1:05:14] want to tell me God come and cut
[1:05:16] everything off and change the situation
[1:05:18] no sometime even if he looks like
[1:05:21] nothing is happening God is there
[1:05:24] amen that's why David say even if I put
[1:05:26] my bed in
[1:05:30] hell he turned he turned in hell he said
[1:05:32] who's here Jesus say I'm here I'm here
[1:05:35] because you're here I shall never leave
[1:05:38] you am never forsake you there is no way
[1:05:42] you can go where the presence of the
[1:05:44] Lord is not
[1:05:47] there amen he said but God was with him
[1:05:52] and did
[1:05:54] what deliver him out of all his what God
[1:05:59] never took the Affliction
[1:06:04] away God didn't take the Affliction away
[1:06:07] God left the Affliction and then he came
[1:06:10] and delivered him out of the Affliction
[1:06:13] you have to be in the Affliction then
[1:06:14] God take you out of the Affliction
[1:06:18] am now your view of Christianity is
[1:06:22] changing deliver him out of what h how
[1:06:25] many Affliction all of his Affliction is
[1:06:28] there any
[1:06:30] exception all
[1:06:35] afflictions every one of them God comes
[1:06:37] and remove it amen amen amen amen am he
[1:06:41] happen a lot to the righteous but the
[1:06:43] Lord deliver him out of
[1:06:46] them no
[1:06:48] exception amen but God let you go
[1:06:51] through it why he says and deliver him
[1:06:55] out of all his
[1:06:57] Affliction after the deliverance from
[1:07:00] Affliction
[1:07:01] Kama and gave him what favor and what
[1:07:05] and wisdom in the sight of who Pharaoh
[1:07:07] king of Egypt and made him what governor
[1:07:10] over Egypt and all his house so after
[1:07:14] the Deliverance you see what is coming
[1:07:15] up you are moving from Affliction to
[1:07:19] governing

[1:18:33] which the canor has left has what the
[1:18:36] caterpillar eaten and look at verse

[1:19:21] [Music]
[1:19:23] another are we together so if you miss
[1:19:26] one step here you're going to get in
[1:19:28] trouble right that's
[1:19:32] right William Maran Branham brother
[1:19:35] Branham say yesterday standing in the
[1:19:38] backyard of my sister that live next
[1:19:40] door to us sister wood we was noticing a
[1:19:44] little cocoon that had form on a tree
[1:19:48] and the wind was blowing it back and
[1:19:50] forth they see a cocon moving on Amen
[1:19:54] and she was was telling it that in the
[1:19:56] streams of the desert I believe that she
[1:19:59] was reading an article about the Cocoon
[1:20:01] it's a little worm that goes in there
[1:20:06] and form a little shell around him to
[1:20:09] keep through the water cold so the cocon
[1:20:12] is
[1:20:13] important it's a protection through the
[1:20:16] cold
[1:20:17] weather but when he comes time I'm going
[1:20:20] to continue on the next one brother
[1:20:22] brandham say this person who was reading
[1:20:25] who was dealing with the little fellow
[1:20:27] they seen the little cocon and moving
[1:20:30] and wiggling around with the
[1:20:32] wind and they felt so sorry for the
[1:20:36] little fellow so they thought they would
[1:20:39] just cut the end of it
[1:20:41] of our lovely
[1:20:43] compassion Beyond God's compassion
[1:20:47] because sometime we love people more
[1:20:49] than
[1:20:49] God when God is whooping them we love
[1:20:53] them until you will love the
[1:20:56] devil amen amen the devil won't be
[1:20:59] converted no matter how much you pray
[1:21:02] for him amen it amen and he said and
[1:21:05] they felt so sorry for the little fellow
[1:21:08] so they thought that they would just cut
[1:21:10] the end of it off and let the little bag
[1:21:12] what out because when he comes out there
[1:21:15] he was going to have what Wings he went
[1:21:19] in as a water above or a water a little
[1:21:22] water and he comes out with water with
[1:21:24] wing you go out as a slave uh-huh but
[1:21:27] you come out as a governor
[1:21:30] amen every step is important amen amen
[1:21:33] he comes out with wings in a more like
[1:21:36] what a glorified
[1:21:39] state so what you see as a bag is in the
[1:21:43] process toward glorification amen am are
[1:21:48] we together and as he was wiggling and
[1:21:50] pulling and tagging and beaing and
[1:21:53] biting they saw this little fellow just
[1:21:55] struggling and trying to get out of the
[1:21:58] cocon they felt so so they felt sorry
[1:22:01] for him so they thought they would just
[1:22:03] give him what a
[1:22:07] shortcut they would just skip a
[1:22:10] step so they go get a what scissors and
[1:22:14] cut the end of it and when they cut the
[1:22:17] end of it the little bag did what come
[1:22:19] out but he never was right amen Lord
[1:22:24] because he didn't have any strength in
[1:22:27] what his body he could not use what his
[1:22:30] wing and I'm afraid this is what
[1:22:32] happened in message
[1:22:34] churches we miss so many
[1:22:38] steps and we got trouble makers in the
[1:22:42] church amen we got people that cannot
[1:22:45] fly right because they gave them a
[1:22:48] shortcut wow every step every government
[1:22:51] is important amen if you miss one step
[1:22:54] you're going to cause trouble amen if
[1:22:57] you miss one step you won't come out
[1:23:00] right you can be well done but if they
[1:23:03] put you in the mouth you don't have
[1:23:05] seasoning
[1:23:07] amen you taste like a
[1:23:10] [Music]
[1:23:11] pepper because you are not seasoned
[1:23:14] right they should have given time for
[1:23:17] the seasoning to penetrate the meat
[1:23:23] amen
[1:23:26] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God
[1:23:28] brother Bram continue he say I think
[1:23:31] that is the way we try to do what to
[1:23:33] duplicate and say get down to the Altar
[1:23:36] and say this and that or the other and
[1:23:38] try to do what get the people back to
[1:23:41] God or into the what the church or come
[1:23:43] to what Christ just let them do what who
[1:23:46] who it out that's all just do what work
[1:23:49] your way out of it that so if you try to
[1:23:52] give them a what a shortcut shall never
[1:23:55] be able to stand

[1:24:00] this message I want to make sure you are
[1:24:03] built well amen and you can stand the
[1:24:06] test that is coming up on your own amen
[1:24:08] whether I'm there or not you can stand

[1:24:14] devil yourself amen but if we misstep to
[1:24:18] please
[1:24:21] you you will never call me a hypocrite
[1:24:24] my friend
[1:24:25] because I'm trying to do my job amen if
[1:24:27] you try to give them a what they shall
[1:24:30] never be able to do what I just like to
[1:24:33] see them what struggle and what and work
[1:24:35] at it and work at it till God do what
[1:24:39] gives them a real birth in the water
[1:24:41] natural way just give them what the real
[1:24:44] bir if they have to cry let them cry

[1:27:18] to him about his bhead that brother Bram
[1:27:22] I don't see here brother Bram said I
[1:27:24] have not lost one of
[1:27:26] them because God knows even the number
[1:27:29] of your hand
[1:27:32] am he goes back to the original
[1:27:38] honor glory glory glory glory glory
[1:27:42] let's go to Genesis 37 where we
[1:27:50] were every garment is important every
[1:27:54] every step is important if you miss it
[1:27:57] you get in
[1:27:58] trouble amen and hopefully by the grace
[1:28:02] of God you will discover why we struggle
[1:28:05] in this message yes sir because people
[1:28:08] miss this
[1:28:11] step don't worry my friend just give me
[1:28:14] my time you will see you will understand
[1:28:17] the behavior of people why they struggle
[1:28:20] amen am let's go to Genesis 37 if you
[1:28:23] dare you you can say amen amen you
[1:28:26] remember last Sunday he was sold you
[1:28:28] know the Easter package was given to him
[1:28:31] Resurrection death burial Resurrection
[1:28:33] going to the Gentile verse 36 and the
[1:28:38] median sold him into Egypt
[1:28:42] whoer you understand this now right the
[1:28:47] median I'm going to answer a question
[1:28:50] and answer right here the medanite sold
[1:28:53] him into Egypt to Piper an officer of
[1:28:57] pharaoh and captain of the Guard we
[1:29:00] found out last Sunday that pipar was a
[1:29:03] military
[1:29:06] man so they put Joseph under a military
[1:29:10] supervisor in a boook
[1:29:18] camp amen if you notice verse 37 is
[1:29:25] finished Joseph is going to the Gentile
[1:29:28] Christ going to the Gentile amen watch
[1:29:32] verse
[1:29:33] 38 chapter 38 I'm sorry the Bible says
[1:29:37] and it came to pass at that time that
[1:29:39] who that Judah went down from what his
[1:29:43] Judah also separate
[1:29:45] [Music]
[1:29:48] himself from his brother going where to
[1:29:51] the Gentile that's right
[1:29:56] you read your Bible right Judas separate
[1:29:59] himself from the brother and turned into
[1:30:02] a c into a certain What aite whose name
[1:30:05] was what and Judah saw there a daughter
[1:30:09] of a certain
[1:30:11] Canaanite amen whose name was shua and
[1:30:14] he took her and went into her and this
[1:30:17] woman conceive so Judah went and marri a
[1:30:21] gentile woman and this is where t is
[1:30:24] introduced so when Joseph is going into
[1:30:28] Egypt Judah goes into the Gentile to
[1:30:31] pick up a wife showing you that Christ
[1:30:34] also Joseph is going to go to Egypt to
[1:30:37] marry a gentile woman but Judah being
[1:30:40] the king have to open up the
[1:30:44] septer it is the mathematics of the
[1:30:47] bible
[1:30:48] [Applause]
[1:30:50] hallu let me show you how strange it is
[1:30:54] okay you got time right let's go to
[1:30:58] verse 36 verse 36 and the medion sold
[1:31:02] who him into Egypt to whoer an officer
[1:31:06] of pharaoh and and captain of the Guard
[1:31:09] then chapter 38 right let's go to
[1:31:12] chapter 39 verse
[1:31:15] 1 if you thereare you can say amen amen
[1:31:18] and Joseph was brought down to Egypt and
[1:31:21] Piper an officer of pharaoh captain of
[1:31:23] of the god an Egyptian brought him
[1:31:26] bought him out of the hand of the who
[1:31:29] the Israelites over there he say median
[1:31:32] over here is so Med and is is what okay
[1:31:37] is which brought him down what stop
[1:31:42] verse one here and verse 36 do you see
[1:31:45] any
[1:31:47] difference it's it's the same thing the
[1:31:50] difference is this is medidan this is
[1:31:52] ishma but it's talking about the same

[1:32:40] Joseph are we together are we together
[1:32:44] all I'm trying to show you is Judah is
[1:32:47] also reflecting something that's going
[1:32:49] to happen to Joseph in Egypt because
[1:32:52] Joseph marri a gentile woman in Egyptian
[1:32:54] and brother Bram say that's the top of
[1:32:56] the Brad showing that cross we go get a

[1:33:22] was loved for from Mama and Daddy
[1:33:25] everybody car for him except his brother
[1:33:28] full freedom and everything God transfer
[1:33:31] him from that home automatically down to
[1:33:34] a boot camp amen amen and we found out
[1:33:38] that behind all of that God was there
[1:33:40] amen you remember last Sunday because
[1:33:42] Joseph told them it is God that sent me
[1:33:44] here not
[1:33:45] you amen amen now let's clim on this one
[1:33:50] brother Bram says this a reminder
[1:33:52] sometime you have to do what separate
[1:33:56] from everything that is what dear on
[1:33:58] Earth to you to take your position that
[1:34:01] God has what called you to so the
[1:34:03] separation is going onto a position amen
[1:34:07] that's right amen you're not just
[1:34:09] separating and you stuck right there no
[1:34:11] they are separating you toward a
[1:34:14] position toward your destiny amen
[1:34:17] everybody okay I'm sure you can read
[1:34:20] between the line what I'm saying some D
[1:34:24] the very what dearest person on earth
[1:34:26] like Joseph his mother his father you
[1:34:29] have to do what shake hands with them he
[1:34:31] didn't even have time to shake hand and
[1:34:33] take your position in what Christ to
[1:34:35] where God has what but what is God
[1:34:40] doing why this separation why this
[1:34:43] heartache this disappointment brother
[1:34:45] brandham say God is transforming you
[1:34:48] from what what you was may be a what a
[1:34:51] daughter and or a son or whatever it is
[1:34:54] from a lovely family sometime he places
[1:34:56] you somewhere else because it is his way
[1:34:59] of what doing it by the what renewing of
[1:35:03] your mind to obey the word of God
[1:35:05] regardless of the price amen so the
[1:35:09] moving have a purpose it is just
[1:35:12] bringing you towards your destiny or
[1:35:15] towards your position and the same thing
[1:35:18] happened to Jesus Christ amen this is
[1:35:20] where we stop on Sunday last Sunday
[1:35:22] brother John says in U in uh chapter 12:
[1:35:27] 23 and Jesus answered them saying the
[1:35:30] hour is what is come that the son of man
[1:35:32] should be what glorified amen as a
[1:35:36] butterfly verily verily I say unto you
[1:35:40] except what corn of wheat fall into the
[1:35:43] water the
[1:35:44] ground alone as long as Jesus remain
[1:35:47] alone you won't see the potential of
[1:35:52] Jesus you will not know that Jesus can
[1:35:55] multiply amen
[1:35:58] amen that's why he said it is even
[1:36:00] better for me to go amen because if I
[1:36:03] stay here the Comfort they won't come I
[1:36:05] am blocking the Holy Spirit I must go so
[1:36:08] I can release the spirit back
[1:36:11] again everybody okay he said if but if
[1:36:15] he dies which is bad to us he brings
[1:36:19] forth what much fruit so what do you
[1:36:21] want do you want much fruit or you want
[1:36:22] to remain with
[1:36:24] glorification take death amen it takes
[1:36:27] suffering it takes beaing a it takes
[1:36:30] rejection am it takes forse accusation
[1:36:33] am but it's bringing you to a position
[1:36:35] Amen brother Bram say if I had a handful
[1:36:38] of wheat laying here on my hand in my
[1:36:40] hand and lay it on the on this desk it
[1:36:43] would what never be nothing but what
[1:36:46] wheat laying there but plant that wheat
[1:36:48] in the ground it shall produce maybe
[1:36:51] what a bushel of wheat in other words
[1:36:53] that wheat got wheat inside amen as
[1:36:56] small as the wheat look
[1:36:59] like have you seen a o tree seed it
[1:37:03] might be this small but he can bring a
[1:37:06] big tree so don't look at your SS amen
[1:37:10] don't look how small you are how
[1:37:12] insignificant you are you can be turned
[1:37:15] to a big tree amen amen because the
[1:37:18] problem is what is inside the natural
[1:37:21] resources that are inside is what
[1:37:24] determine the value of the
[1:37:28] land a land might look good but there is
[1:37:32] nothing under nobody want it but if
[1:37:35] there is resources everybody will fight
[1:37:37] for it because they are looking for
[1:37:42] resources but the germ of life that is
[1:37:45] in the wheat but the wit has to fall
[1:37:48] where into the ground and do what and
[1:37:51] die Jesus say I believe say accept a
[1:37:54] corn of whe fall into the ground and die
[1:37:56] it does what so it's necessary to go
[1:37:59] through this process in order to bring
[1:38:02] forth your potential or to bring you to
[1:38:04] the position that God want you to be
[1:38:08] Amen in Luke Chapter
[1:38:10] 24:25 the Bible said then he said unto
[1:38:13] them on the road to emay oh fools and
[1:38:17] slow of heart to do what to believe all
[1:38:20] that the prophet has what have spoken
[1:38:22] ought not
[1:38:24] Christ have to do what suffer these
[1:38:26] things to enter into what his glory so
[1:38:30] to enter into Glory Christ must suffer
[1:38:34] amen if there is no suffering no glory
[1:38:37] amen no persecution no glory am no
[1:38:41] removal of M no glory am no trouble
[1:38:46] no you miss that step you're going to
[1:38:49] cause trouble down the
[1:38:50] [Music]
[1:38:52] road are we together amen are we
[1:38:54] together Amen brother Bram say neither
[1:38:57] can he take you or can he take me the
[1:39:00] devil until the purpose of God of our
[1:39:03] life is what finished so we gather from
[1:39:06] there what consolation and why does God
[1:39:09] let trouble
[1:39:12] come William Marion Bram God harness
[1:39:15] what trouble and put bits in its what
[1:39:19] mouth and make it do what obey him and

[1:50:05] everything is working together for what
[1:50:08] listen to this my friend what is going

[1:50:14] we talking about the Garment of a
[1:50:16] servant or a slave amen amen amen amen
[1:50:19] amen Joseph is called
[1:50:24] Perfection and we found out that his
[1:50:26] Blessing are bigger his Blessing is
[1:50:29] greater than Jacob greater than Isaac
[1:50:31] greater than even Abraham and Joseph
[1:50:34] himself T
[1:50:36] Perfection what are you trying to say
[1:50:38] brother Bram is saying this in the
[1:50:40] Masterpiece he said Abraham was the
[1:50:43] foundation of Faith let's say he had
[1:50:46] four foundations the foundation of Faith
[1:50:49] was who Abraham the foundation of love
[1:50:52] was who Isaac the foundation of Grace
[1:50:55] was who Jacob God's grace to Jacob
[1:50:57] anyone knows that but in Joseph was what
[1:51:02] Perfection there is there is where he
[1:51:04] could set the monument
[1:51:08] amen as much as the Masterpiece as
[1:51:12] Abraham look like the father of our
[1:51:14] faith when God look at Abraham he said I
[1:51:17] cannot position the building over
[1:51:21] here
[1:51:24] he look at Isaac Isaac is a top of love
[1:51:26] he look he say no no I cannot put this
[1:51:28] building right here I'm reading brother
[1:51:31] BR he look at Jacob oh this is Grace the
[1:51:34] grace of Lord God everything he said I
[1:51:36] cannot position my building here I can
[1:51:39] only put my building only on
[1:51:43] Joseph all of them don't qualify to be
[1:51:46] the Masterpiece of God and brother Bram
[1:51:49] say upon none not the First Foundation
[1:51:53] Abraham not the second foundation not
[1:51:56] the third but upon what fourth
[1:51:58] foundation so this boy have to be a
[1:52:04] masterpiece in other word when you see
[1:52:06] Joseph you must see
[1:52:09] Perfection when you when God see you
[1:52:11] people see you they must see Perfection
[1:52:14] amen God could not give it to
[1:52:19] Paul because Paul say when that which is
[1:52:22] perfect will come he knew he was not in
[1:52:24] his day all the messenger god could not
[1:52:27] give it all the believer throughout the
[1:52:30] edes Ephesus Pam God say I cannot put

[2:00:02] this glory to God that in uh Genesis 43
[2:00:06] and they set on him for uh they set on
[2:00:11] for him by himself this is Joseph they
[2:00:13] give him food himself and for and for
[2:00:16] them by themselves his brother alone and
[2:00:19] for the Egyptian which did it with him

[2:00:39] man not eat bread with what the Hebrews
[2:00:42] for that is a what an Abomination unto
[2:00:44] what to the Egyptians so when they are
[2:00:46] sending Joseph to Egypt he's going into
[2:00:50] a land where he's seen as an
[2:00:58] Abomination can I continue verse uh 34
[2:01:02] and 46 that ye shall say this is Joseph

[2:01:39] no
[2:01:41] right amen and not only does he have no
[2:01:45] right but he's going in a land where his
[2:01:48] race is seen as a lower race as an
[2:01:54] abomination in other word when he enter
[2:01:57] Egypt people are looking at him
[2:02:03] like the god of paradox
[2:02:07] am how can an
[2:02:09] Abomination become a governor of
[2:02:14] land an Abomination now become the
[2:02:17] governor of the land when they were

[2:03:08] pharaoh how can an officer of pharaoh
[2:03:10] get an Abomination into his
[2:03:14] house are we together are we together
[2:03:17] let's look at this servant my friend
[2:03:19] brother Bram say when Joseph was in

[2:03:27] silver that was who that was Jesus when
[2:03:29] he was made ptif for man that was who
[2:03:34] Jesus so Joseph being a servant to P was
[2:03:39] Jesus how can he be Jesus as a
[2:03:42] slave on brother
[2:03:46] amen are we together are we together are
[2:03:49] we together listen to brother uh uh

[2:04:05] servant so Joseph left the coat of many
[2:04:08] colors now he sent as a servant but not
[2:04:12] truly a servant the way we think he was
[2:04:14] sold with a price so he was a servant as
[2:04:17] a slave this is why brother bradam says
[2:04:20] this he said that is hard but we are
[2:04:23] what slaves and we want to serve him all

[2:05:04] what crucifying the flesh to be a slave
[2:05:07] for Jesus Christ rejoicing because he
[2:05:09] was a what slave when we talking about a
[2:05:13] slave in laia this is a big
[2:05:16] problem this government here is a big
[2:05:20] problem for laition

[2:11:53] him directly to the
[2:11:57] throne are we together let's start from
[2:12:01] the
[2:12:02] origin according to the origin Joseph
[2:12:06] got two
[2:12:09] dreams we together according to buff
[2:12:12] dream he was on a on a position of
[2:12:18] authority

[2:12:33] bowing down he's standing in the Zodiac
[2:12:36] everybody's that bowing down he's
[2:12:38] standing so automatically from the
[2:12:41] beginning there is a destiny to power
[2:12:46] that's right that's right there is a
[2:12:48] destiny to a throne there is a destiny
[2:12:52] to a higher position that everybody will
[2:12:55] bow down but to get to that Destiny you
[2:12:59] need to go through this
[2:13:02] manle
[2:13:04] why do you follow me go to Genesis 37
[2:13:09] let's see where he
[2:13:10] started Genesis
[2:13:13] 37:2 we're moving pretty good my
[2:13:16] friend you there Genesis 37:2
[2:13:21] these are the generation of Jacob Joseph
[2:13:24] being 17 years old was feeding the flock
[2:13:28] he was in
[2:13:29] charge with his Brethren and the lad was
[2:13:33] with the sons of Bah and with the sons
[2:13:35] of zela his father's wife and Joseph
[2:13:39] brought to his father the what evil
[2:13:42] report so from his
[2:13:48] youth he was a small manager
[2:13:54] is my Bible different he was already
[2:13:57] supervising and watching the flock and
[2:14:00] going and bringing
[2:14:05] report can I continue can I continue
[2:14:09] amen jump to verse
[2:14:12] 14 amen and he said him verse 14 go I
[2:14:18] pray you see whether he be well with
[2:14:20] your who thy bre so his brother was
[2:14:23] there feeding the flock but his father
[2:14:25] kept the supervisor
[2:14:29] home he said I got a mission for you

[2:14:39] the tank over there go ahead and go give
[2:14:41] me a report
[2:14:43] again of your brother
[2:14:47] situation so this didn't start in P for
[2:14:52] he started from his
[2:14:56] childhood are we together that position
[2:14:59] of authority was already bleeding
[2:15:02] through his childhood of
[2:15:05] responsibility but the responsibility of
[2:15:08] Egypt is
[2:15:12] bigger are we together that's why David
[2:15:15] have to keep the
[2:15:18] flock because he have to Shepherd Israel
[2:15:21] so they have to train him under the
[2:15:23] flock to defend the flock to fight for
[2:15:27] the
[2:15:29] flock then God never move him to a
[2:15:32] kingship he move him under s to learn
[2:15:38] obedience before you go to the
[2:15:41] throne from the flock to sa from s then
[2:15:45] you become the
[2:15:48] king are we together are we together

[2:16:26] he came down to what so from his
[2:16:28] childhood he was already put under
[2:16:31] responsibility no wonder his father
[2:16:34] already gave him a coat of many colors
[2:16:37] because there was something about this
[2:16:38] boy that is different than the other the
[2:16:41] gift is already there amen but God want

[2:43:06] mean it's written in the
[2:43:10] Bible because you learn that when Jesus

[2:43:17] n wherefore God God has
[2:43:21] whated highly exalted him and give him a
[2:43:25] what name which is a of what every
[2:43:29] name that name you get it after you pass

[2:43:38] here when they sound the trumpet what
[2:43:41] happened every knee was doing what look
[2:43:44] at Jesus Christ himself he said he give
[2:43:47] him a name which is above what every

[2:43:54] of of the things which are where in
[2:43:56] heaven and the things which are where in
[2:43:58] Earth and the things which are where
[2:44:00] under and that every tongue should what
[2:44:03] confess God will force you to confess
[2:44:09] amen even his enemy said truly this is
[2:44:13] the Son of God even the one who's
[2:44:15] crucifying you if you pass this test
[2:44:19] they will speak and say truly this is a
[2:44:22] Christian amen this woman is a Christian
[2:44:25] I I treated him bad I treated her bad
[2:44:29] but this is a true Christian if you want
[2:44:31] to see a message believe it that's you
[2:44:33] because you crossed the path he says and
[2:44:36] Jesus Christ that should confess that
[2:44:38] Jesus Christ is the Lord to the glory of
[2:44:40] who God the
[2:44:43] Father why he passed the test of a
[2:44:48] servant
[2:44:49] I have not finished I'm going to close
[2:44:52] here look at what God did to Jesus go to
[2:44:56] Ephesian
[2:44:58] one few chapter and that's it Ephesians
[2:45:02] chapter
[2:45:04] one let me leave you with Ephesian
[2:45:08] 1 Ephesian 1 verse 20 uh verse
[2:45:14] 19 three verses are you there and what
[2:45:19] is the exceeding greatness of his power
[2:45:22] toward us toward us word who believe
[2:45:26] according to the working of his what
[2:45:28] Mighty power which he wrote In Christ he
[2:45:32] did it first in Jesus when he did what
[2:45:35] raised him from the dead Easter and set
[2:45:38] him at his what own right hand in the
[2:45:41] Heavenly in the in the Heavenly places
[2:45:44] far above what all look at the position
[2:45:47] Jesus received after he became obedient
[2:45:50] to The Obedience of the death of Calvary
[2:45:53] at the cross he said he rose him far
[2:45:56] above what all principality and what and
[2:45:59] power and what and might and what and
[2:46:01] dominion and what and every name that is
[2:46:03] named not only in what this world but
[2:46:07] also what in that which is to come in
[2:46:09] other words no matter which name you
[2:46:12] going to come up
[2:46:14] with no name will be like the name of
[2:46:17] Jesus Christ
[2:46:20] that's why the new name of God cannot be
[2:46:23] different than Jesus
[2:46:26] Christ I'm preaching a Doctrine right
[2:46:28] now I just drop that atomic bomb I just
[2:46:32] Dro that atomic bomb that's why when
[2:46:35] they say God he will have a new name
[2:46:37] don't think he will be different than
[2:46:39] Jesus Christ because even in the word to
[2:46:43] come the name of Jesus Christ always on
[2:46:47] the top
[2:46:49] why he
[2:46:51] obeyed the house of
[2:46:55] pipy one day we will preach on the new
[2:46:57] name of God we will teach on the new
[2:46:59] name of God he said even in the word to
[2:47:02] come and has put what all things under
[2:47:06] under his feet and gave him to be what
[2:47:08] the head over all things to which is
[2:47:11] what to the
[2:47:13] church Jesus went through this garment I
[2:47:16] told you before I will show you he
[2:47:19] became a servant and I'm going to show
[2:47:21] you Lord's
[2:47:22] willing how was he a servant and how
[2:47:25] Jesus was behaving as a servant as a
[2:47:28] slave it's a necessary but laish shall
[2:47:32] take your right
[2:47:33] off God wants you to be trained and I'm
[2:47:37] going to show you why the power that you
[2:47:40] have is
[2:47:43] dangerous amen your power is very
[2:47:46] dangerous you are too powerful than you
[2:47:49] think amen so they got to put you in P
[2:47:53] for house to structure you to prepare
[2:47:56] you in other word body for house is your
[2:48:03] tutorial it is your
[2:48:06] training it is your
[2:48:08] preparation towards your destiny if you
[2:48:12] miss that you're going to have a
[2:48:17] trouble
[2:48:20] that's why people in this message are
[2:48:21] full of
[2:48:24] themselves whatever they do is right in
[2:48:27] their own
[2:48:28] eyes their opinion is always right they
[2:48:32] have to express their mind all the time
[2:48:36] even if you give a quote they have a
[2:48:38] thought brother Bram say but what about
[2:48:41] me this is my way of viewing this let me
[2:48:44] at least tell you what I think
[2:48:47] laa
[2:48:49] laia
