[31:24] when God told him to go save his people
[31:26] and the thing is God did not give Moses
[31:29] a pep talk oh yes you can do it you're
[31:31] strong because he didn't like we as men
[31:34] cannot we're not strong enough to do
[31:35] that Moses Our God told Moses that he's
[31:39] The Great I Am and when we're identified
[31:41] in Jesus Christ that's when we have the
[31:44] power and authority to do all things and
[31:46] the thing that's different about us and
[31:47] Moses we have the sacrifice God died for
[31:50] us we were born after that
[31:52] and I like and those song says uh when I
[31:55] left my voice and Shout every Wall comes
[31:57] crashing down I have the authority and I
[32:00] just hope that message resonates with

[58:01] amen if you thought that I forgot I
[58:04] didn't forget how many are up to date

[58:12] book
[58:13] okay if you finish the church ages
[58:15] please we got the 70 weeks of Daniel go
[58:18] ahead and start on it so by the time I
[58:20] land down there you will be soaring
[58:22] pretty good if you don't show up in
[58:24] church and you behind your sermon please
[58:27] I'm really worried about your spiritual
[58:29] health amen if you didn't show up on
[58:32] Wednesday maybe you were work make sure
[58:34] by Thursday or Friday you catch up on
[58:38] the sermon and you stay up because the
[58:40] way the Holy Spirit move in this church
[58:42] every sermon follow Idol tell every time
[58:45] and if if you miss five six seven you
[58:48] are completely lost amen when you're
[58:51] gonna look they say part 64 then you
[58:54] will be like okay how am I going to
[58:55] start from part one so
[58:59] make sure you keep up with it amen
[59:01] yesterday we finished music part two it
[59:05] was two hour 47 minutes and 17 seconds
[59:09] amen so the first time it was three
[59:12] hours 33 minutes so 333 so if you put
[59:15] them together it's complete six hours
[59:19] a little bit more than six hours if you
[59:21] say that's too much Jesus preached on
[59:23] the road of imayas for six hours
[59:26] I didn't preach six hours I splitted in
[59:28] three hours and 33 and 2 hours and 47
[59:32] minutes amen so everything you have need
[59:35] of in music has been presented with
[59:38] Bible scripture and with the court of
[59:40] the prophet he has nothing to do with my
[59:43] country with my uh whatever ethnicity or
[59:49] whatever you want to call it or my race
[59:51] or whatever I have nothing I didn't even
[59:53] touch anything on that all I have
[59:56] touched was the word of God and the
[59:59] message of the hour so even though you
[1:00:01] don't sing in the church we found out
[1:00:03] yesterday that the music you're
[1:00:05] listening at home the Christian music
[1:00:07] you're listening are opening door for
[1:00:10] Spirit
[1:00:11] amen and sometimes you are struggling
[1:00:13] you don't know why you can't get Spirit
[1:00:15] off it's because of the religious music
[1:00:17] that you're listening for you don't know
[1:00:19] that it's loaded with spirit and you
[1:00:21] opening the door and before you know it
[1:00:23] the home are struggling especially
[1:00:25] sisters because Mama love music more
[1:00:27] than Daddy and most of the time mom is
[1:00:30] the one playing the music and Mom is the
[1:00:32] one opening the door on YouTube and
[1:00:34] before you know it you got Spirit at
[1:00:35] home amen the the the music I'm looking
[1:00:39] at I'm seeing among message Believers
[1:00:41] are horrible
[1:00:42] what they're looking at what they're
[1:00:44] posting online the way the making
[1:00:46] brother Brown and we saw yesterday Elvis
[1:00:49] Presley didn't learn his dancing on the
[1:00:52] world brother Branham said he learned
[1:00:54] that in the church amen so they are
[1:00:56] dancing and moving things that young
[1:00:59] kids are doing and they're just learning
[1:01:01] it from religious people and it's Mama
[1:01:03] putting that and say go ahead and dance
[1:01:05] and before you know it the kids already
[1:01:07] caught up into that thing and later on
[1:01:09] kids are in trouble amen I've seen
[1:01:12] message Believers sisters posting stuff
[1:01:14] that uh you just look you say I wonder
[1:01:16] if they even were born again
[1:01:19] amen because a born-again woman could
[1:01:21] not even put something like this but
[1:01:23] it's all over across the board and
[1:01:25] that's what the devil is using so strong
[1:01:27] now among the young people the devil is
[1:01:30] using music to get into the young people
[1:01:32] in the message because it's an area in
[1:01:35] the message that was never covered
[1:01:37] properly
[1:01:38] that's why the devil is entering there
[1:01:40] to destroy life
[1:01:42] the young people rise for tomorrow fall
[1:01:44] tomorrow fall watch the music you're
[1:01:46] looking at amen amen watch what you're
[1:01:49] watching on your YouTube you are opening
[1:01:51] door to Spirit everybody okay so my job
[1:01:56] was done for two part one part two
[1:01:59] so your blood
[1:02:01] is not in my hand
[1:02:03] if you didn't show up that is up to you
[1:02:06] you pray for God to put it in my heart
[1:02:08] to release the tip at this point I'm
[1:02:12] still cautious about it there is
[1:02:14] somebody who asked for it on YouTube my
[1:02:16] brother wherever you are pray God very
[1:02:19] hard
[1:02:20] amen so that he put a conviction on me
[1:02:23] to release those tips amen but it was
[1:02:26] open to the church the music is already
[1:02:29] set the order of the music is set here
[1:02:31] before you come up with the music it's
[1:02:34] going to be filters not by Brother John
[1:02:36] Porter but by the word that was preached
[1:02:39] here and brother John Porter was there
[1:02:41] in part one and part two brother said
[1:02:43] was there in part one in part two so
[1:02:45] that's the filter they will be using so
[1:02:48] if you say no I don't see why they don't
[1:02:50] have to play my music the first question
[1:02:52] I will ask you were you there in part
[1:02:54] one and two if you say you are not there
[1:02:57] I say now I understand why are you
[1:02:58] struggling with this amen if you were
[1:03:01] there you didn't know then we can go
[1:03:03] over and talk about it amen everybody
[1:03:06] good
[1:03:07] you should be stronger than me
[1:03:10] do you know what time I went to bed
[1:03:13] let's go to second king
[1:03:16] we don't have visitors in this church
[1:03:18] okay we got family members amen so all
[1:03:24] our family members welcome to spoken
[1:03:26] word Tabernacle
[1:03:29] glory to God
[1:03:32] this sermon was so loaded
[1:03:34] and I have to chop it
[1:03:37] and pull another part for the next
[1:03:40] session because I cannot unload
[1:03:43] everything that I have this morning
[1:03:45] because it's Easter morning amen but
[1:03:48] let's see even the part that we chopped
[1:03:51] if we can be able to reach where we
[1:03:52] supposed to
[1:03:54] depending on the poor amen
[1:03:57] oh my what's going on
[1:04:00] everything is okay
[1:04:03] amen
[1:04:04] second king
[1:04:08] chapter 2 very familiar scripture we
[1:04:12] went through this about the seal
[1:04:14] evidence and the open evidence if you
[1:04:16] remember about the 24 stones that were
[1:04:19] in Jordan there were 12 that were buried
[1:04:22] and there were 12 that were put outside
[1:04:24] amen praise God finally we got our third
[1:04:28] camera for the church it's a big one
[1:04:31] right there behind if you look you look
[1:04:33] bigger than the other one the one that
[1:04:35] was there Lord's willing you will see it
[1:04:37] coming this way so all area are covered
[1:04:41] amen thank you for all your offering and
[1:04:44] thank you for all your building fun and
[1:04:46] all your tithing with that that's why we
[1:04:49] make things happen in this church so
[1:04:51] take over there I'm expecting to have a

[1:10:24] spiritual amen he cried my father my
[1:10:27] father The Chariot of Israel and the
[1:10:30] horsemen thereof and he saw him no more

[1:19:39] though Christ is in you amen the body is
[1:19:42] still dead that's why according to
[1:19:44] Romans 7 Paul say that in me in my flesh
[1:19:49] I see that there is something there is a
[1:19:52] law there there is a law of sin and

[1:21:10] Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching
[1:21:12] you humbly again this morning Father on
[1:21:16] this Easter morning Lord
[1:21:18] remembering the greatest victory that
[1:21:22] you have accomplished in the history of
[1:21:25] Christianity Lord which is the
[1:21:27] resurrection from the dead Lord what a
[1:21:31] celebration when Lord father we can be

[1:21:51] shining Lord and not only is the sun
[1:21:53] shining but Lord father we are in your
[1:21:56] presence in your house Lord may you move
[1:21:59] us completely out of the way may you
[1:22:01] come and speak to our soul may you be
[1:22:03] the Alpha and the Omega of this service
[1:22:05] Lord father bless your children and
[1:22:08] minister to those that are here and
[1:22:10] those that are streaming online Lord may
[1:22:12] this sermon be a blessing to the soul
[1:22:14] and may you touch their body as well in
[1:22:17] the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:22:20] glory to God I'm going to read one more
[1:22:23] scripture you don't have to turn there
[1:22:25] but it's just to lay a foundation the
[1:22:28] Bible says in the Book of Matthew 27
[1:22:30] verse 62 now the next day that followed
[1:22:34] the day of the preparation the chief
[1:22:37] priest and Pharisee came together unto
[1:22:40] palate
[1:22:42] saying sir
[1:22:44] we remember that that is silver
[1:22:48] said while he was yet alive after three
[1:22:53] days
[1:22:54] I will rise again so even though Jesus
[1:22:59] was dead
[1:23:03] he was still a threat to the enemy
[1:23:08] because before his death he already made
[1:23:11] some powerful statement
[1:23:15] and the statement he made was about his
[1:23:17] resurrection
[1:23:19] amen and the Pharisee remember that
[1:23:23] this man here what we have here is not
[1:23:27] something to play around
[1:23:30] even though he's dead is still dangerous
[1:23:37] and the danger lies in the power of
[1:23:40] Resurrection
[1:23:42] [Applause]
[1:23:46] everybody okay
[1:23:49] they say command therefore that the
[1:23:51] separate can be made house sure until
[1:23:54] the water Third Day bless his disciple
[1:23:57] come by not and daughter steal him away
[1:24:00] and say unto the people he is risen from
[1:24:04] the water dead why because the last
[1:24:06] error
[1:24:07] [Music]
[1:24:09] come on
[1:24:11] shall be how worse than the water first
[1:24:14] I got the news from the devil that error
[1:24:18] happened amen
[1:24:21] that's why we are here this morning
[1:24:24] because Jesus Christ Rose from the grave
[1:24:27] amen and because of that we don't have
[1:24:30] one Jesus you have many jesuses
[1:24:35] that's why the era was very wasted
[1:24:42] everybody okay everybody okay so what
[1:24:45] the devil is afraid of is a resurrected
[1:24:49] Jesus Christ
[1:24:51] he knew that Jesus had the beginning
[1:24:54] he's going to have an end but Jesus
[1:24:57] after he said he said no no no no no no
[1:24:58] no let me check this guy right here
[1:25:01] because if we come back again in life
[1:25:07] everybody okay everybody okay if he
[1:25:10] crossed Jordan one time
[1:25:13] if we come the second time toward Jordan
[1:25:16] he's gonna come with a different
[1:25:19] anointing
[1:25:20] it's gonna be greater than before
[1:25:23] and we are the proof of the Resurrection
[1:25:27] that's why we are in love
[1:25:30] that's why we can sing for him that's
[1:25:33] why we can praise him that's why we can
[1:25:36] breathe that's why we have power over
[1:25:39] everything because Jesus is Alive
[1:25:42] [Music]
[1:25:44] [Applause]
[1:25:46] everybody okay everybody okay oh my God
[1:25:51] my subject this morning is the four
[1:25:55] phases of roof the power of Easter

[1:26:14] dealing with the kingsman Redeemer in
[1:26:17] order to remove him completely from the
[1:26:20] life of Ruth

[1:26:25] crossed the border
[1:26:26] everybody okay and roof enter into the
[1:26:29] Commonwealth of Israel there is still a
[1:26:33] Kingsman Redeemer

[1:27:28] in the body
[1:27:31] everybody okay in order to meet with him
[1:27:34] in the body you must be like him
[1:27:38] everybody okay because the Bible say
[1:27:41] when we will see him we will be like him
[1:27:44] and to be like him we must remove the
[1:27:47] death that is still in our body
[1:27:51] everybody okay that's why Bo has taught

[1:28:19] partaker of Flesh and Blood we become
[1:28:22] human being he Jesus Christ also himself
[1:28:25] likewise took part of the waters in
[1:28:29] other words God became human
[1:28:31] because his children were human
[1:28:34] in other words Jesus followed you
[1:28:39] Jesus follow his bride
[1:28:41] because he was after his wife
[1:28:44] everybody okay that through death

[1:43:34] God deal with the King's Men He was not
[1:43:36] the responsibility of roof everything

[1:43:46] if it's under the responsibility of God
[1:43:49] how are we going to get there let's go
[1:43:52] to First Corinthians chapter 15.
[1:43:55] glory to God

[1:44:07] Glory Glory the power of Easter
[1:44:16] are we there
[1:44:18] yes First Corinthians chapter 15 let's
[1:44:21] start by verse 17.
[1:44:24] you remember last Sunday about the
[1:44:26] resurrection of the dead so we clear
[1:44:28] verse 17. if Christ be not raised
[1:44:33] your faith is how vain no Easter no
[1:44:37] faith
[1:44:40] everybody okay
[1:44:41] you are yet in your water sins because
[1:44:45] it's Easter that opened your deliverance
[1:44:48] from sin
[1:44:51] everybody okay the dying of Jesus Christ
[1:44:54] no problem
[1:44:56] because the Pharisees say that say we
[1:44:59] dealt with him amen he's dead this man
[1:45:03] is over the disciple discourage
[1:45:05] everybody went to their own place but
[1:45:07] they say wait a minute the problem is if
[1:45:09] this man
[1:45:12] amen that's the problem
[1:45:16] everybody okay dying no problem he can
[1:45:19] die and stay right there
[1:45:20] then we finish with him but if he comes
[1:45:23] back again
[1:45:24] then it's a bladder problem everybody
[1:45:26] okay
[1:45:27] Verse 18 then they also which are
[1:45:32] falling asleep the Christian increase
[1:45:35] our water perished
[1:45:37] so if Jesus Christ never rose again
[1:45:40] every believer that die is gone
[1:45:43] you're not gonna come back again
[1:45:45] amen
[1:45:48] let's continue
[1:45:49] verse 19 19 if in this life only we have
[1:45:53] hope
[1:45:54] in Christ we are of all men must have in
[1:45:59] other words if your life in Jesus Christ
[1:46:02] is only now when you die it's over Paul
[1:46:06] said we are most miserable
[1:46:09] because they are the ones are mad
[1:46:11] effective and enjoying
[1:46:13] everybody okay you are the most
[1:46:15] miserable
[1:46:16] amen
[1:46:18] let's get it now verse 20. but now
[1:46:22] is crossed on water we know that Paul
[1:46:25] are so crushed
[1:46:27] Peter saw him you remember that Sunday
[1:46:29] James saw him more than 500 people saw
[1:46:33] him we know that Jesus is Alive the
[1:46:36] apostles saw him the disciples saw him
[1:46:39] watch carefully but now is Christ's
[1:46:43] reason from the dead
[1:46:46] we know that he's alive
[1:46:48] Karma and become the water
[1:46:51] how is the first fruit written
[1:46:59] the way it's written in my Bible
[1:47:02] it is written first
[1:47:04] amen and there is a hyphen
[1:47:08] I don't know if that's the same way man
[1:47:10] it's like that
[1:47:12] because one man cannot be plural
[1:47:17] everybody okay everybody okay the way
[1:47:21] it's written is say first fruit
[1:47:24] Amen in other words the fruit are many
[1:47:32] everybody okay but he is the first one
[1:47:37] everybody okay
[1:47:39] meaning they are the ones that are
[1:47:41] coming
[1:47:43] but he is the first one to pop up
[1:47:46] and when you see the first one coming up
[1:47:49] it is telling you the grand is okay
[1:47:52] and it gives you hope
[1:47:55] that the other one I also come up
[1:47:59] so the first fruit of your field is very
[1:48:02] important
[1:48:04] everybody okay if you got seven
[1:48:07] daughters and the first one get married
[1:48:15] everybody okay he give you hope that the
[1:48:18] remaining
[1:48:24] let me leave it alone that's okay
[1:48:27] everybody okay let's go back to the
[1:48:29] first fruit
[1:48:30] everybody okay everybody okay somebody
[1:48:33] would have caught it and become the
[1:48:36] first fruit of them that did whatever
[1:48:38] slept
[1:48:39] so sleeping is for the Christian amen if
[1:48:43] you notice here Jesus is not the first
[1:48:46] fruit of the living
[1:48:50] [Music]
[1:48:55] everybody okay because the first fruit
[1:48:57] of the living was Enoch
[1:49:03] everybody okay Enoch didn't die
[1:49:06] but the Bible said he was translated
[1:49:09] he was changed amen without seeing death
[1:49:13] but Jesus Christ died
[1:49:16] everybody okay and he become the first
[1:49:19] fruit of them that were dead
[1:49:24] what does the first fruit mean
[1:49:27] amen
[1:49:28] amen
[1:49:29] because Jesus was not the first one to
[1:49:32] resurrect
[1:49:34] everybody okay
[1:49:36] everybody okay Moses died he rose they
[1:49:39] saw him on Mount Transfiguration
[1:49:42] that's why the devil was looking for him
[1:49:44] he could not find it amen Elijah has a
[1:49:48] resurrection Elisha has a resurrection
[1:49:50] when the berry uh Elijah they were
[1:49:54] bringing a man that was dead they put
[1:49:56] him down and uh he hit the bones and he
[1:50:00] came back to life so Jesus was not the
[1:50:02] first one matter of fact Jesus
[1:50:04] resurrected people
[1:50:06] Jesus resurrected Lazarus what makes
[1:50:09] Jesus to be the first one are they
[1:50:12] already resurrected before him
[1:50:16] everybody okay everybody that died and
[1:50:21] rose again before Jesus Christ died
[1:50:24] again
[1:50:26] all right
[1:50:27] everybody okay Moses will be killed in
[1:50:31] Israel
[1:50:32] Lazarus Rose and die everybody that was
[1:50:36] dead and rose again died again but Jesus
[1:50:39] Christ is the first one that when he
[1:50:42] died and rise again he can no longer no
[1:50:46] more in other words the resurrection of
[1:50:50] Jesus Christ brought a new species
[1:50:53] [Applause]
[1:50:59] am I reading a different Bible the
[1:51:02] resurrection of Jesus Christ bought a
[1:51:05] new species
[1:51:07] of human being
[1:51:13] we talked about two bodies
[1:51:15] we got a theophany
[1:51:18] everybody okay and we got our natural
[1:51:20] body
[1:51:21] amen ities don't eat
[1:51:26] our Natural Body eat
[1:51:28] Amen to your funny can appear and
[1:51:31] disappear the natural body cannot
[1:51:33] disappear but after the resurrection of
[1:51:36] Jesus Christ we find Jesus appearing
[1:51:39] disappearing Crossing wall and yet he
[1:51:42] can eat a hamburger
[1:51:46] everybody okay so Jesus brought a specie
[1:51:50] that is Godly
[1:51:54] God and human mixed together
[1:52:00] are we okay I'm going slowly my friend
[1:52:04] everybody good
[1:52:06] let's continue reading the Bible say and
[1:52:09] he become the first fruit of them that
[1:52:11] slept so the first specie that came up
[1:52:15] from the grave with another
[1:52:18] category of human being was Jesus Christ
[1:52:21] he became the first fruit what does the
[1:52:24] fresh fruit mean to us
[1:52:26] William Marion Branham brother Branham
[1:52:29] says that he was the first corn of God
[1:52:32] to it
[1:52:33] that has been raised from the water Dead
[1:52:36] God's first corn of what by God's
[1:52:40] quickening power God had quickened his
[1:52:43] life raise him up from the dead and he
[1:52:46] was the first fruit of those that the
[1:52:50] first fruit he was Dash
[1:52:54] we okay
[1:52:56] that is why they had to have that shift
[1:52:59] for he was the first one that came to
[1:53:02] water maturity brother brought him his
[1:53:04] friend here according to Leviticus 23
[1:53:06] that when you have a field in the Old
[1:53:08] Testament when you go and you grow a
[1:53:11] field
[1:53:13] things will begin to come up then for
[1:53:16] some reason among everything that is
[1:53:18] growing one of them will be a chief
[1:53:24] amen and the chief is very important
[1:53:27] because the chief give you the direction
[1:53:30] everybody okay the chief is born Chief
[1:53:33] just like that
[1:53:35] let me leave the guide alone everybody
[1:53:37] okay so when the first one which
[1:53:39] maturity in the Old Testament brother
[1:53:42] Branham said what they were doing they
[1:53:44] were going they take it and they plug it
[1:53:47] they say praise the lord we will take
[1:53:50] this and give it an offering unto God
[1:53:52] Amen when they give it to the priest the
[1:53:55] priest will take it and begin to wave
[1:53:58] over the field and say praise the Lord
[1:54:00] all of you guys yes yes you see this
[1:54:03] this is the way all of you will be this
[1:54:06] is the final product

[1:54:44] because he was the first Son of God to
[1:54:47] come to full maturity to be in God he
[1:54:51] was planned up from the earth and he was
[1:54:54] willing for the people

[2:17:16] going to refresh this if I taught you a
[2:17:19] water

[2:58:54] thank you Jesus
[2:58:57] Hallelujah
[2:58:58] Heavenly Father
[2:59:01] Lord once again we have been brought in
[2:59:05] remembrance
[2:59:06] what you did in Easter
[2:59:09] father being born on the religion
[2:59:12] we heard so much about Easter
[2:59:16] and probably what we knew was about the
[2:59:19] Easter Bunny
[2:59:21] it was about the gift
[2:59:24] it was about the clothing
[2:59:26] it was about the time that we can
[2:59:29] exchange
[2:59:31] gift
[2:59:32] the term that we can wish one another
[2:59:36] happy Easter his reason he is risen yes
[2:59:40] that's the father we could go
[2:59:44] but father today
[2:59:46] you have unfolded to us
[2:59:48] that Easter is not just about bringing
[2:59:51] you out from the dead
[2:59:54] because you didn't come alone
[2:59:57] you also took the Old Testament Center
[3:00:00] so he was a greater history
[3:00:03] a greater Victory than any victory that
[3:00:07] the Pharisee even taught
[3:00:10] father they were afraid that you alone
[3:00:12] will be brought back today to go to life
[3:00:17] but it was more than you
[3:00:19] all the Old Testament said
[3:00:22] were released
[3:00:23] and because you Rose
[3:00:25] everyone that died in you
[3:00:29] will rise again
[3:00:31] when you coming for the physical
[3:00:33] Resurrection
[3:00:35] and father you already started a
[3:00:38] resurrection
[3:00:40] as the scripture says that when we were
[3:00:42] dead in sin
[3:00:44] you have quickened us
[3:00:46] according to Ephesians 2
[3:00:49] whether we were under denomination
[3:00:52] or whether we were in the market scene
[3:00:55] of the world
[3:00:56] father you came and you Quicken our
[3:00:59] souls
[3:01:00] you change our destination
[3:01:04] and you open the way
[3:01:06] that the very spirit of God
[3:01:09] can come down and dwell in Mortal beings
[3:01:13] because now you are already glorified
[3:01:16] and by being glorified you made a way to
[3:01:19] the Holy Spirit
[3:01:22] and father you didn't stop there
[3:01:24] not only did you Quicken our body our
[3:01:28] soul and our spirit but father you want
[3:01:31] also our body
[3:01:34] to be quickened and to be like you
[3:01:37] and potentially you begin to work
[3:01:41] because the theophany how's it coming
[3:01:44] down it is searching for something
[3:01:49] it is our eternal
[3:01:51] inheritance that has been reserved for
[3:01:54] us
[3:01:56] it is crying up that we can come up to a
[3:01:59] higher life
[3:02:01] and father if there is someone tonight
[3:02:03] or somebody this morning or this
[3:02:05] afternoon
[3:02:07] or wherever they are on the other side
[3:02:09] of the world they might be nighting
[3:02:12] that has not been quickened by this
[3:02:15] power that we're talking about
[3:02:18] that are still under the bounds of
[3:02:21] denomination
[3:02:23] where the denomination outside the
[3:02:25] message or within the message rank
[3:02:29] they don't know really what they are
[3:02:32] believing
[3:02:33] they cannot claim onto something
[3:02:36] they don't have something really sure
[3:02:39] that they can determine and say yes I
[3:02:43] got it
[3:02:45] father today is Easter
[3:02:47] may this day be a memorial for them
[3:02:50] that father you can Quicken them
[3:02:54] from whatever situation they are
[3:02:57] they are parents here that have children
[3:03:00] that are still under sin
[3:03:04] their family member that are not here
[3:03:07] this morning
[3:03:08] because the devil took a grip of him
[3:03:12] but Lord you told us to have confidence
[3:03:15] to have faith in what we got in our body
[3:03:19] if today we are standing is because
[3:03:22] something has not been done for us
[3:03:25] and if you did it for us you can do it
[3:03:28] for a loved one
[3:03:30] father wherever they are
[3:03:32] stop them
[3:03:35] turn them around
[3:03:38] Quicken them
[3:03:40] deliver them from the power of Darkness
[3:03:46] May the feathers of Darkness of laodicea
[3:03:50] of denomination be broken down
[3:03:54] so that Lord they can be exposed no more
[3:03:57] to a religion
[3:03:59] no more to a camper but to a living
[3:04:01] Christ
[3:04:03] to something genuine
[3:04:06] something authentic
[3:04:09] a real life
[3:04:11] which is a true Thunder
[3:04:13] for the devil lord
[3:04:15] father I pray that you granted
[3:04:18] because you Resurrected
[3:04:20] and you release that power to be
[3:04:22] available for the church
[3:04:24] Lord if someone is sick this morning
[3:04:27] and those that are in a hospital
[3:04:30] father streaming
[3:04:32] May the power of Easter
[3:04:35] touch the motor body
[3:04:38] those that have been under the weather
[3:04:41] with nice or congestion coughing coffee
[3:04:45] the pneumonia
[3:04:46] all kind of symptoms
[3:04:49] father quickened them Lord
[3:04:51] if somebody is dead box leading in the
[3:04:55] Christian walk
[3:04:57] until Church doesn't interest them
[3:05:00] anymore
[3:05:01] they become tall
[3:05:03] to the things of God
[3:05:05] church is something where they miss or

[3:05:25] and a burning desire can rise up again
[3:05:29] that would show them back again to the
[3:05:32] things of God so that whenever the house
