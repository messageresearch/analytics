[0:00] God bless you all
[0:03] and this is Brother Stephen chamble
[0:06] local pacifier in spoken word Tabernacle
[0:09] of Gastonia here in North Carolina in
[0:12] the United States
[0:13] this is an expo that we have done in uh
[0:17] about music
[0:19] and music has been such a treacherous
[0:22] subject
[0:23] very contradictory in the past until
[0:26] that we noticed that the music that the
[0:30] message Believers are listening to up to
[0:33] now got into the way that is swayed to
[0:36] the world
[0:37] there is no gauge there is no standard
[0:39] for it and we felt impressed in our
[0:42] heart to be able to address this subject
[0:45] before humility and uh according to the
[0:49] message of the hour and we trust that
[0:52] this exposition of music will be a
[0:55] tremendous blessing to you and for those
[0:59] who are local Shepherd that are Shepherd
[1:01] many group all over the world if you
[1:03] come across this table this video you
[1:07] can use it as a baseline And I know
[1:09] there are several quotes that brother
[1:11] Branham mentioned about music but I was
[1:14] not able to put it all there but at
[1:17] least we have a call from where we can
[1:20] work together and then you can add every
[1:23] single
[1:24] remaining code into it for the
[1:26] betterment of your church so enjoy music
[1:31] part one and then don't stop at part one
[1:34] because that's not all you will continue
[1:36] with music part two all the way to part
[1:38] three and I believe by the grace of God
[1:41] the Holy Spirit Will Enlighten you and
[1:43] make sure that whatever predicament the
[1:46] devil tried to bring into this message
[1:48] will be stopped and the children of God
[1:51] will be free to worship God in the
[1:54] spirit and in the truth with their
[1:56] clapping with their dancing with the
[1:58] music and music that is acceptable and
[2:01] appropriate for the children of God God
[2:04] richly bless you we love you of Bride of
[2:07] Jesus Christ but Stephen Shea thank you

[5:50] [Music]
[6:20] happy
[6:25] [Music]
[6:31] amen amen amen we should have a house
[6:34] full tonight
[6:36] our musician here
[6:38] some of them
[6:39] okay praise God
[6:42] I gave 15 minutes
[6:45] just in case somebody has a legitimate
[6:48] reason to be a little bit behind
[6:50] so they can get caught but we can't be
[6:53] waiting waiting waiting if not we won't
[6:56] be able to do anything amen let's go to
[6:59] our scripture
[7:04] it's going to be First Corinthians
[7:09] if I would have put this in the slide I
[7:12] would not even sleep because I went to
[7:13] bed at around 5am
[7:18] amen
[7:23] oh my
[7:25] and in the morning you start having
[7:27] phone calls
[7:29] amen
[7:30] so I'm gonna take you as witness
[7:34] everybody that is here as witness
[7:38] we spoke about church order on December
[7:41] 3rd
[7:42] February 11th now we're talking about
[7:44] music
[7:45] so I opened the door to the whole church
[7:49] for whoever want to be a musician now or
[7:52] in the future or the kids that want to
[7:54] be musician everybody should be here so
[7:57] whatever is going to be put today
[7:59] it's set
[8:01] we okay
[8:03] so if anybody fast says I will call you
[8:05] all
[8:07] to talk to that person
[8:09] everybody okay
[8:12] so they have been given opportunity to
[8:15] be here to hear it so we make sure
[8:17] everything is good but if somebody goes
[8:19] and go grab any kind of song and try to
[8:21] bring it here and we say no
[8:24] I don't want any problem
[8:26] we okay
[8:27] let's go to First Corinthians I will
[8:30] repeat it tomorrow
[8:31] with my weaknesses
[8:34] Lord's willing First Corinthians 11
[8:36] verse 29.
[8:40] because it's very easy to complain but
[8:44] few are reading the scripture and if you
[8:47] are listening to the message
[8:51] that's where we get all the fusses
[8:56] First Corinthians chapter 11 verse 29.
[9:03] okay
[9:05] the Bible says
[9:07] for he that it is
[9:10] and drinketh unworthily
[9:14] eateth
[9:15] and drinketh Damnation to himself
[9:20] what does it mean unworldly
[9:22] not Discerning the Lord's body
[9:26] that Lord's body is not what you're
[9:29] eating here in communion
[9:31] the Lord's body is the bread of Jesus
[9:34] Christ if you need a scripture on that
[9:35] you see me in other words somebody's
[9:38] behaving a certain way not respecting
[9:41] the body of Jesus Christ the people of
[9:44] God that have the Holy Ghost
[9:46] amen verse 30 for this cause many are
[9:50] weak
[9:51] and sickly among you and many sleep see
[9:55] how we can get in trouble by playing
[9:56] with church
[9:58] amen for if we would judge ourselves
[10:02] we should not be how
[10:04] you might be seated so if you judge
[10:07] yourself at home
[10:10] we won't have to do anything here
[10:12] amen because the Judgment we're talking
[10:15] about is not our judgment
[10:18] it is not the Judgment of the United
[10:19] States it is not the Judgment of Europe
[10:22] or Africa or whatever it is the Judgment
[10:26] through the word of God so if you judge
[10:29] yourself according to the word of God
[10:31] automatically you don't have to be
[10:34] judged here in other words you got a
[10:36] sticker you got your Visa you got
[10:38] checking like on the airport you just go
[10:40] straight and enter the plane because you
[10:42] judge yourself everybody okay
[10:45] the Bible says but when we are judged we
[10:49] are chesting of the Lord
[10:51] that we should not be condemned with the
[10:53] water so even if you didn't judge
[10:56] yourself or something sleep up you
[10:59] didn't catch it when we are addressing
[11:02] it the purpose of it we're trying to get
[11:05] you off the fire everybody okay we don't
[11:08] want you to stay here in the tribulation
[11:10] period amen so when correction is coming
[11:13] it's not in a way to put you down if
[11:16] correction is coming in a way to put you
[11:18] down that's not correction anymore
[11:21] everybody okay so that's not a problem I
[11:24] mean that's a problem right there amen
[11:26] but correction is coming in the way to
[11:28] rescue you
[11:30] and to protect you to say brother you're
[11:32] off the line the devil can get you here
[11:35] let's go back in the line so you stay
[11:37] fortified
[11:38] everybody okay
[11:40] praise be to the name of the Lord he
[11:43] says wherefore my brethren verse 33 when
[11:46] you come together to eat normally
[11:49] everybody in the choir should be here
[11:53] everybody that is playing in the choir
[11:55] should be here
[11:59] he said wherefore my brethren when you
[12:02] come together to eat
[12:05] Terry one for another and he sent me any
[12:09] man hunger let him eat at home that he
[12:13] come not together unto condemnation
[12:16] this is the key and the rest will add
[12:20] the water
[12:22] so there is no way you can get Church
[12:24] Without order
[12:28] amen you cannot have a church without an
[12:31] order
[12:32] you can even now have a company without
[12:34] an order you cannot even have a house
[12:37] without an order
[12:41] so church and Order goes together
[12:45] amen
[12:47] glory to God in either word if you love
[12:50] order you will love me quickly
[12:55] everybody okay let's go to First
[12:58] Corinthians chapter 14.
[13:02] glory to God
[13:08] so if somebody say no they're going to
[13:10] record then they're going to give it to
[13:11] me then I don't have to come there good
[13:14] luck
[13:16] amen
[13:18] First Corinthians Chapter 14 verse 33 I
[13:22] taught few folks that have a legitimate
[13:24] reason to get on a phone hookup if they
[13:27] can be able to get it first Corinthians
[13:29] Chapter 14 verse 33 if you dare you can
[13:32] say Amen
[13:34] amen glory to God
[13:38] very familiar scripture
[13:40] you there
[13:42] for God
[13:43] is not the author of water
[13:47] so if you see confusion
[13:51] do you have to think twice
[13:55] it's the devil God is Not
[13:59] in other words never
[14:02] God
[14:04] never
[14:06] will be the author
[14:08] of confusion
[14:12] so if you see something that brings
[14:14] confusion just stay away
[14:17] it is not God
[14:19] amen because God cannot be the author of
[14:23] confusion the Bible saying for God is
[14:26] not the author of confusion but of what
[14:30] as in all churches of the Saints
[14:35] job to verse 40.
[14:37] lovely
[14:39] let water
[14:45] in other words everything that we would
[14:49] do in this church
[14:51] everything let all things be done how
[14:56] and in water
[15:02] you can't get away from order so church
[15:04] and order we just saw they go together
[15:07] amen but now Paul is saying let
[15:10] everything that we do everything number
[15:13] one he's not the author of confusion
[15:16] amen
[15:17] but how would we know everything must be
[15:21] done decently
[15:25] and huh
[15:28] everybody okay
[15:30] if something doesn't reflect decency
[15:38] everybody okay and does not reflect the
[15:40] order
[15:42] should we be partaker of it
[15:45] we can close here and then I can go home
[15:49] the Bible say let all things
[15:55] amen be done how
[15:57] and how if it's not done decently and
[16:01] it's not in order
[16:02] why do we sit and argue
[16:08] everybody okay something doesn't look
[16:10] decently why do we want to argue
[16:16] everybody okay glory to God last
[16:20] scripture let's go to TARDIS
[16:24] so First Corinthians
[16:25] Paul wants things to be done in order
[16:29] he said I will get there and I'll set
[16:32] things in order
[16:33] in other words certain things are not
[16:35] correctly in order when I got there I
[16:38] will make sure order is there then
[16:40] another one Paul is saying everything
[16:42] that we do in church must be done how
[16:45] decently and in order now let's go to
[16:48] Titus Chapter One
[16:56] if you're there you can say Amen
[16:58] verse 4.
[17:01] Paul's saying to Tardis my own son after
[17:04] they come on faith Grace Karma mercy and
[17:08] peace from God the father and the Lord
[17:11] Jesus Christ Our Savior
[17:14] for this cause left ID in quit to do
[17:18] what that that should just do what
[17:22] how many scripture have I give you about
[17:24] order
[17:26] this is not brother Branham say
[17:29] even though it is brother Brian I'm
[17:31] saying because the message in the Bible
[17:33] are one but I'm giving you pure
[17:36] scripture where order is important for
[17:39] church
[17:42] Paul is saying that I want you to set in
[17:45] order the things that are what
[17:48] so there are certain things that were
[17:50] lacking in the church
[17:52] and Paul say I want you to go there and
[17:55] put them in order
[17:59] they are there but they need order
[18:03] the gifts are there gift need
[18:10] the officer are there the officer need
[18:16] everybody okay he say set in order the
[18:20] things that are wanting and ordained
[18:23] Elder in every city as I have appointed
[18:29] so the one who already gave instruction
[18:31] is Paul
[18:33] so Timothy is doing things according to
[18:35] the instruction of Paul
[18:37] which is the instruction of the
[18:39] messenger of the age
[18:42] and we have our messenger
[18:44] now we got to do things according
[18:47] to William Marion Branham
[18:50] everybody okay we good
[18:53] let's pray Heavenly Father
[18:56] Lord we are approaching you humbly
[18:58] father
[19:00] this evening thanking you once again for
[19:02] your grace
[19:03] for your love for your mercy and for
[19:06] everything you have been doing for us
[19:09] father we are committing this service
[19:10] unto the hand and we remember and
[19:13] acknowledge that we are human being we
[19:16] are subject to limitation and subject to
[19:19] error father but Lord we want the Holy
[19:22] Spirit the one that is perfect to come
[19:25] in the midst of us and to minister to us
[19:27] father may you move me completely out of
[19:30] the way may you come and father minister
[19:33] to your children be the Alpha and the
[19:36] Omega of this service we rebuke every
[19:38] demonic Spirit contrary to your word
[19:40] away from this place Lord father bless
[19:44] us as we gather together around the
[19:46] things of the Kingdom in Jesus precious
[19:49] name amen
[19:51] glory to God Amen you will need your
[19:55] bible really handy I'm going to go step
[19:58] by step the way I wrote them so
[20:01] I make sure I don't miss anything amen
[20:04] glory to God our subject tonight is
[20:09] about music
[20:13] somebody can call it songs or whatever
[20:15] but it's about music
[20:18] amen
[20:19] before we address music itself
[20:24] we need
[20:26] first of all to understand certain keys
[20:29] if we don't we're going to miss
[20:31] everything
[20:32] amen because it's easy to Define music
[20:35] but
[20:37] why are we talking about music tonight
[20:40] if music was something so simple that we
[20:43] all know why are we sitting discussing
[20:45] about music
[20:47] what is the purpose of us meeting
[20:49] tonight what is so important
[20:53] about music that we have to gather here
[20:56] on a Saturday that you should be
[20:58] somewhere with your family enjoying what
[21:01] is wrong with music amen
[21:05] before we address music the first point
[21:07] I'm gonna pull is
[21:10] we have two kingdoms
[21:14] amen
[21:16] in this world
[21:17] we have the kingdom of God
[21:21] amen and we have the kingdom of the
[21:25] devil or Satan
[21:27] everything that is going on in the
[21:30] universe
[21:31] everything that is going on in this
[21:34] world everything that is going on in the
[21:37] churches in our family in our own life
[21:40] is between two Kingdom
[21:43] those Kingdom you can call them two
[21:46] powers
[21:48] or you can call them two forces
[21:51] and these two forces are behind
[21:53] everything
[21:56] that is done
[21:57] everything that is done it's either God
[22:02] amen or it's either Satan
[22:05] amen everything that is done and God
[22:09] when we speak about God God
[22:11] is the creator
[22:15] Amen in other words God is the one who
[22:19] always start first
[22:23] everybody clear in other words God is
[22:26] the original
[22:28] Amen in other words God is the standard
[22:34] amen whatever he does is perfect
[22:40] whatever he does is good whatever he
[22:43] does he create it's already wired it's
[22:47] already proven it's already been checked
[22:50] it cannot be altered it is the way it is
[22:53] everybody okay
[22:55] but Satan is not a creator
[22:59] everybody okay Satan is only according
[23:03] to the message he is a pervertor so if I
[23:06] say something tonight
[23:09] and I'm quoting a scripture or I'm
[23:12] telling you that this is what brother
[23:13] Brown I'm saying you have a right
[23:16] to see me after church or to send me a
[23:19] message and I have a right to find that
[23:22] scripture or that quote and give it to
[23:24] you so that it's not going to be my word
[23:26] my thinking it is the word of God the
[23:29] word of the Prophet amen so Satan is a
[23:32] perfect
[23:33] perverted means that he usually waits
[23:37] for the original
[23:40] everybody okay as we go in this way it
[23:44] will help you in music he always wait
[23:46] for the standard
[23:49] he always wait for that which is good
[23:53] because when God created everything was
[23:55] good everybody okay and once he was the
[23:59] original is set it's already created
[24:02] Satan will come after the original and
[24:05] he will take the original and change it
[24:08] into something else
[24:13] everybody okay so hence
[24:17] we have not only two Kingdom
[24:20] not only to power not only two forces
[24:24] now we got two music
[24:29] everybody okay
[24:31] we got a Godly music
[24:37] amen
[24:39] and we got a satanic music
[24:42] what we call worldly music
[24:45] amen what we call a secular music
[24:50] this one is called Godly it is called
[24:53] divine
[24:55] what we call church music
[24:58] what we call worship music
[25:01] what we call Christian music
[25:07] everybody okay so far everybody good so
[25:11] far amen now since we got two of them
[25:16] these two sources here God and the devil
[25:20] and these two music here there is a
[25:24] music for god and there is a music for
[25:27] Satan let me read something that brother
[25:30] Branham says
[25:31] if you need a quote see me after church
[25:34] I could not make the PowerPoint if I do
[25:36] PowerPoint I won't have time to sleep
[25:40] in the message crust in 1955
[25:44] paragraph seven
[25:47] I can even print this out and hand it to
[25:50] you if you want to
[25:52] every code like this we're not Catholic
[25:56] we don't hold stuff we can give it to
[25:59] you everybody okay because I already
[26:01] highlighted and everything I got it
[26:03] there amen he says God
[26:06] is in music
[26:09] he said don't you believe God is in
[26:12] music
[26:12] he says certainly God is in music
[26:17] he is in art
[26:19] God is in the universe
[26:23] everybody okay
[26:25] second quote from hearing receiving and
[26:29] acting in 1960 paragraph 65. brother
[26:33] Branham say I love art
[26:36] God is in art
[26:41] everybody okay
[26:43] by the brand I'm saying the right kind
[26:46] of art
[26:48] why the right can because there is how
[26:51] many sources
[26:56] everybody okay
[26:57] see why the whole church should be here
[27:00] he said God is in art the right kind of
[27:05] art
[27:06] he said God is in music
[27:10] the right kind of music
[27:13] so there is a right kind of music
[27:17] why because we got two Kingdom we got
[27:21] two power we got two forces there's four
[27:24] we got two sources
[27:27] everybody okay brother Branham say God
[27:31] is endearsing
[27:39] everybody okay
[27:42] so God because our title is music
[27:46] god brother Branham say is in music I
[27:50] don't want to write art because we're
[27:52] not dealing with art and brother random
[27:54] say also God is in nursing
[27:57] but both of these must be right
[28:05] everybody okay he said God is in dancing
[28:09] the right kind of dancing
[28:12] God isn't shouting
[28:18] everybody okay
[28:19] God isn't shouting
[28:24] everybody okay brother Branham say comma
[28:27] the right kind of shouting why because
[28:31] it's two sources
[28:33] it's two Kingdom it is still power it is
[28:37] two forces You're Gonna Know You must
[28:39] know where you're going
[28:41] everybody okay another one in the
[28:44] message Elijah and Elisha in 1954
[28:49] paragraph 39. brother Branham say I was
[28:53] talking to a man not long ago that
[28:57] didn't believe in music in the church
[29:01] he was holding a fuss with me about it
[29:04] he said oh the music belongs to the
[29:08] world
[29:12] I say brother Branham the spirit of God
[29:16] didn't come under Stewart prophet
[29:21] until he got the mixture out
[29:25] and begin to play
[29:27] a good old-fashion
[29:33] Holy Ghost song
[29:37] everybody okay
[29:39] Holy Ghost song and the spirit of God
[29:43] come down on the prophet that is right
[29:47] brother Branham continues he say God
[29:51] does not change
[29:53] and if God liked in the past music in
[29:58] that day
[29:59] God likes music today
[30:02] yes sir

[42:30] voice of many water
[42:31] we know who their voice is and as the

[43:54] when the seals open and the inspiration
[43:57] broke a new song also comes with it
[44:09] the source is from heaven

[45:05] another group what are they doing amen
[45:08] they sang as you were a new song Before
[45:11] the Throne before the four beasts and
[45:14] the Elder and no man could learn

[45:29] I will get to your training if we need
[45:32] training on the music do we need

[1:05:15] words when you reach laodicea this is
[1:05:17] how the devil operate
[1:05:22] the devil in the poor time worked

[1:05:28] Paul didn't have cell phone

[1:05:42] of Mouth
[1:05:44] that's their gospel that's not us we can
[1:05:47] stream right now and they can see me in
[1:05:49] Australia
[1:05:51] amen what is this like what is the
[1:05:54] setting of laodicea
[1:05:57] according to the prophecy the Bible say
[1:06:00] I know that works
[1:06:02] that there are neither
[1:06:05] nor
[1:06:06] stop there is two words there
[1:06:14] you ready how many kingdom do we have
[1:06:20] how many power do we have how many
[1:06:23] forces do we have how many music do we
[1:06:25] have
[1:06:26] how many kind and which are seeking
[1:06:30] worshiper how many words do we have
[1:06:32] there
[1:06:37] everybody okay everybody okay so one of
[1:06:41] the word is called
[1:06:44] another one is hot and we got only two
[1:06:48] sources so one of the source
[1:06:52] will pick up either chord or hat
[1:06:58] we okay
[1:07:01] so according to the age we're living in
[1:07:03] we found a condition of two
[1:07:07] the condition must be either hot
[1:07:11] or the condition must be either what
[1:07:14] but according to the prophet God is the
[1:07:18] devil
[1:07:18] [Applause]
[1:07:22] everybody okay
[1:07:24] we're going from The Source The Source
[1:07:26] The Source God is satanic
[1:07:29] when they say you quote spiritually it's
[1:07:32] a problem everybody okay then heart is
[1:07:35] who
[1:07:38] that is the introduction of laodicea
[1:07:42] let's go back again they say I know that
[1:07:45] work
[1:07:47] that data neither water
[1:07:50] no water
[1:07:52] stop now
[1:07:54] laodicea doesn't say that his heart
[1:08:00] he does even say that he's cool
[1:08:04] because if you hurt
[1:08:07] I know what that means if I bring a hot
[1:08:10] wire a pocket you're gonna hear a
[1:08:13] beautiful scream out it goes in because
[1:08:16] it's hot if I put something called you
[1:08:18] go like wait a minute this is too cold
[1:08:20] we know what it does but laodicea is an
[1:08:24] edge that refuse the extremities
[1:08:32] everybody okay
[1:08:34] laodicea doesn't want to be called
[1:08:39] he doesn't want to be off so hard he
[1:08:42] wanna stay somewhere in the middle
[1:08:48] you gotta know the age you live in it
[1:08:52] in other words
[1:08:54] want to mix the two sources together
[1:09:00] everybody is following me
[1:09:03] everybody is following me
[1:09:06] La odisha is never called or never had
[1:09:11] if you're living in laodicea and you
[1:09:14] want to see Satan look at him while he's
[1:09:17] in the Warmness
[1:09:21] foreign
[1:09:27] take God
[1:09:29] and Satan and mix them together
[1:09:33] [Applause]
[1:09:35] amen and me and bring something that is
[1:09:39] lukewarm
[1:09:44] everybody okay if you take it
[1:09:48] somebody must say
[1:09:50] it's hot
[1:09:55] somebody also might say no no no no this
[1:09:58] is not hot hot is hot this is
[1:10:01] this is kind of cold
[1:10:07] everybody okay everybody okay remember
[1:10:10] God is never the author of what
[1:10:14] remember that from the beginning
[1:10:17] something that confuses you
[1:10:24] are we together
[1:10:26] when I go this way then you're gonna
[1:10:28] judge music yourself everybody okay
[1:10:31] let's go to verse 15. another words that
[1:10:35] there are neither called nor wood
[1:10:40] or water God say I want you to show me
[1:10:44] your position
[1:10:46] if you are for me be for me if you are
[1:10:50] for the devil before the devil
[1:10:57] you don't get me yet
[1:10:59] another word what God is saying if you
[1:11:03] Christian
[1:11:04] I want you to be 100 percent
[1:11:08] Christian
[1:11:11] so when I come to you I don't have to
[1:11:13] think twice
[1:11:16] are you following me if you are devilish
[1:11:19] make sure you do a very good job for the
[1:11:22] devil
[1:11:22] so when I come to you I'm dealing with a
[1:11:25] sinner
[1:11:26] but I don't like for you to be in church
[1:11:31] but you look like the world
[1:11:40] everybody okay
[1:11:42] verse 16. so then because there are
[1:11:46] water
[1:11:48] so you see that from the scripture
[1:11:51] is an edge of lukewarmness
[1:11:59] amen lukewarm
[1:12:02] and neither called nor
[1:12:05] I will do what
[1:12:07] out of my
[1:12:13] if you had
[1:12:15] I know if you called ano but if you look
[1:12:20] warm
[1:12:21] God himself will spew you out
[1:12:30] now let me ask you a question if God
[1:12:32] spew you out what do you want me to do
[1:12:35] to you
[1:12:41] okay if I pointed somebody he must say
[1:12:43] something
[1:12:44] guitar If God spew you out
[1:12:48] what what will be my attitude toward the
[1:12:52] guitar If God already spilled the guitar
[1:12:54] what do you want me to do to love it so
[1:12:58] I love more than God
[1:13:02] everybody okay if God spews something
[1:13:05] out what should I do
[1:13:11] why is God spewing did that because it's
[1:13:15] neither
[1:13:16] no
[1:13:18] so if you see something
[1:13:21] that that
[1:13:23] gives you a blending between
[1:13:26] Christianity and worldliness between the
[1:13:30] kingdom of God and the kingdom of the
[1:13:33] devil between the two forces
[1:13:36] automatically God was filled out
[1:13:40] that's it
[1:13:41] [Music]
[1:13:42] yes I can stop right here we can go home
[1:13:49] when you look at TV
[1:13:51] on your Christian music what do you see
[1:13:57] what do you see

[1:16:18] beautiful voice
[1:16:19] higher than our sister here how do you
[1:16:22] see that shoes

[1:16:32] everybody okay I'm taking you all
[1:16:34] tonight as my weakness
[1:16:37] to every song that will come here
[1:16:41] everybody Okay let's listen to William
[1:16:43] Marion Branham
[1:16:45] brother Branham says this in the message
[1:16:47] Discerning the body of the Lord
[1:16:50] brother Branham says
[1:16:53] now verse paragraph 27 our
[1:16:57] eternal
[1:17:00] destination
[1:17:02] not temporal
[1:17:04] Eternal destination in other words when
[1:17:06] you get this destination it's over
[1:17:09] brother Branham say our
[1:17:11] Eternal destination
[1:17:13] is not all together
[1:17:15] determined but what we see
[1:17:19] and what we hear there is two words
[1:17:23] brother pranam is using the word see
[1:17:26] which involve your vision
[1:17:29] or your visual
[1:17:31] amen and he's involving the word hearing
[1:17:35] which is going with your ear
[1:17:38] everybody okay
[1:17:43] can you read this yeah
[1:17:45] your what
[1:17:48] everybody okay
[1:17:49] brother Branham say our Eternal
[1:17:52] destination is not all together
[1:17:54] determined by what we see and what we
[1:17:57] hear but it is determined on what
[1:18:01] discernment
[1:18:03] we have of what we see and what we hear
[1:18:11] ing something is not a problem
[1:18:13] seeing something is not a problem but
[1:18:16] how do you interpret
[1:18:18] how do you discern
[1:18:21] how do you decode what you see
[1:18:28] everybody okay
[1:18:30] so la odisha according to the condition
[1:18:34] of the age it's an age that takes the
[1:18:38] things of God and the things of the
[1:18:40] world the two Kingdom and mix them
[1:18:42] together and blend them and bring
[1:18:44] something in the middle amen so you as a
[1:18:48] Believer when you see the things of that
[1:18:50] audition your Eternal destination
[1:18:53] will be depending on the discernment
[1:18:58] that you have on what you see and what
[1:19:01] you hear the seeing is your video on
[1:19:05] YouTube
[1:19:07] it is your DVD player
[1:19:09] it is your Instagram it is your status
[1:19:14] your hearing is what you're hearing from
[1:19:17] the back of it
[1:19:18] so when you heal when you see what do
[1:19:22] you decode from that
[1:19:25] amen
[1:19:27] what you decoding from that is going to
[1:19:30] be responsible for your destination
[1:19:35] I don't know if you get me
[1:19:38] in other words when you look at
[1:19:40] something and you see something and you
[1:19:43] make a judgment
[1:19:45] do you follow me the Judgment you're
[1:19:47] making will either get you away from God
[1:19:52] I don't know if you're following or you
[1:19:55] will get you closer to God
[1:20:02] I'm gonna say this
[1:20:04] God means what
[1:20:07] it's worldly music none of you probably
[1:20:10] here
[1:20:12] listen to Wordly music heart is what
[1:20:16] but lukewarm is
[1:20:20] so what you gonna get in trouble is not
[1:20:24] really worthily yeah
[1:20:27] it is not this music
[1:20:30] you're not here
[1:20:32] you gave your life to Jesus Christ that
[1:20:35] is not your problem
[1:20:37] amen Satan doesn't want to go here
[1:20:41] because here he's going to worship God
[1:20:43] Satan want to go in the middle here
[1:20:47] amen
[1:20:49] so here you are the devil here you are
[1:20:53] still at the Devil
[1:20:56] because God say if you hear he will do
[1:20:59] what
[1:21:04] when you're listening to your favorite
[1:21:07] artist
[1:21:11] put the video clip what do you see
[1:21:16] when you hearing their music
[1:21:19] what do you hear
[1:21:23] what is the condition of the age you
[1:21:25] live in
[1:21:26] your age is dangerous
[1:21:31] amen the age we're living here is a
[1:21:35] deceptive age
[1:21:37] tired
[1:21:39] what set and work with it today is not
[1:21:42] something that is going to show you
[1:21:44] Brandt that I am setting it is something
[1:21:47] that is Blended together
[1:21:49] [Music]
[1:21:51] it is something that look like Christian
[1:21:58] it is something at the beginning you'll
[1:22:01] think you are Christian
[1:22:03] until you find yourself in the hand of
[1:22:06] the devil
[1:22:08] the Bible say in Matthew 24 24
[1:22:13] you can put it down the Bible says that
[1:22:17] the deception of laodicea will be so
[1:22:21] great
[1:22:22] that it will deceive the elect
[1:22:25] if we were water
[1:22:27] if any late is almost to be deceived how
[1:22:32] is that deception
[1:22:35] any latest somebody you will never
[1:22:37] deceive but the deception of laodicea
[1:22:41] goes very close to almost get an
[1:22:44] electing trouble
[1:22:46] [Music]
[1:22:53] everybody okay everybody okay let's go
[1:22:57] to Matthew 7.
[1:23:00] did you see me touching music yet
[1:23:06] Matthew 7.
[1:23:09] verse 21. if you dare you can say Amen
[1:23:13] lack of these Keys is why we argue
[1:23:19] is why we fast
[1:23:21] these are why we can sit seven hours
[1:23:24] like Jehovah Witnesses
[1:23:27] and if and and and each party go with
[1:23:30] their own thoughts that they came up
[1:23:32] with
[1:23:33] and sometimes we part one another we
[1:23:35] don't want to talk to each other because
[1:23:37] there was so much fusses
[1:23:41] Matthew 7 verse 21 if you dare you can
[1:23:44] say Amen
[1:23:47] you there
[1:23:49] not everyone
[1:23:53] that say unto me certain Satan
[1:24:03] I don't know if you're getting me
[1:24:07] I don't know if you understanding me
[1:24:09] the deception of laodicea if you are
[1:24:13] waiting to hear your Christian musician
[1:24:17] to tell you Satan you will never hear it
[1:24:23] your favorite song uh song Whatever
[1:24:26] worshiper that you get on YouTube will
[1:24:29] never use the word Satan
[1:24:34] he will even say Satan I don't like you
[1:24:37] and you say you do here he says Satan I
[1:24:39] don't like you
[1:24:41] and you say yes you see he doesn't like
[1:24:43] Satan because you are expecting him to
[1:24:46] tell you Satan I love you that's
[1:24:48] childish in laodicea
[1:24:52] that's really childish
[1:24:55] amen if you want this message and you
[1:24:58] are expecting the devil to show you that

[1:25:52] say
[1:25:54] Lord Lord
[1:25:55] shall enter in the Kingdom of water
[1:26:01] in other words when somebody says Lord
[1:26:05] Jesus Lord Jesus it means nothing
[1:26:11] I don't know if you're getting me
[1:26:16] what I'm trying to say is your musician
[1:26:20] when he speaks he uses the word of the
[1:26:23] Lord
[1:26:26] everybody okay
[1:26:28] but it doesn't mean because he's saying
[1:26:31] Lord Lord in his song that his song is
[1:26:35] correct
[1:26:38] in other words when somebody said Jesus
[1:26:41] Jesus Jesus doesn't mean it's okay
[1:26:47] I don't know if you get me
[1:26:50] what I'm trying to show you is the
[1:26:52] deception of the agent
[1:26:55] this age will never tell you Satan Satan
[1:26:59] that's in the different end this age is

[1:28:01] their life is not correct and the word
[1:28:05] is correct they are dangerous
[1:28:09] [Music]
[1:28:10] if your musician that you watch on
[1:28:13] YouTube well what he's seeing is good
[1:28:16] but the way he acted and his life is not
[1:28:20] correct you need to be careful
[1:28:22] [Applause]
[1:28:25] amen
[1:28:27] why it is the condition of the age
[1:28:33] everybody okay

[1:28:40] not few
[1:28:42] welcome will say to me in that day what
[1:28:47] so do you expect your Christian musician
[1:28:50] if he misses the Rapture do you expect
[1:28:53] him to come before God and say I was not
[1:28:55] a Christian he will claim it
[1:28:57] he will say Lord I was all over in the
[1:29:01] convention they were calling me I'm the
[1:29:04] one who was warming out the convention
[1:29:07] I was not singing for Satan
[1:29:11] everybody okay he said Lord Lord
[1:29:15] have we not prophesied in your name I
[1:29:18] can catch this tomorrow
[1:29:19] in that name have cast our devil
[1:29:22] in that name do wonderful work
[1:29:25] many wonderful words and then I will
[1:29:28] profess unto them and never what
[1:29:31] let me ask you a question let's be
[1:29:33] honest
[1:29:34] because some of you are watching
[1:29:36] Pentecostal
[1:29:38] preachers okay I'll show you a
[1:29:41] Pentecostal preacher that is preaching
[1:29:43] Jesus Christ
[1:29:44] everybody okay and then he prophesied
[1:29:47] and the prophecy is correct he prayed
[1:29:50] for the sick and the Seeker here
[1:29:53] but God is saying despite everything
[1:29:55] that I gave it to you I never knew that
[1:29:58] preacher how are you going to bite to
[1:30:01] that
[1:30:05] because when people do Miracle all of it

[1:34:17] brother Robert block brother Katie broke
[1:34:19] by the Stephen block this one let the
[1:34:20] other one see
[1:34:26] everybody okay everybody okay what do
[1:34:29] you see your Eternal destination is
[1:34:32] based on this thing
[1:34:34] you the one doing the inspection based
[1:34:37] on what you see and what you are
[1:34:42] everybody okay let's go to Second
[1:34:45] Corinthians then we get in music
[1:34:48] second Corinthians chapter 11.
[1:34:51] if you did you can say Amen
[1:35:04] glory to God
[1:35:10] so when you bring in your title of music
[1:35:13] when you bring in your special
[1:35:16] when you're bringing whatever you bring
[1:35:17] make sure you already do your due
[1:35:21] diligence
[1:35:23] okay because over here there is only one
[1:35:26] Cannon
[1:35:28] it's automatic
[1:35:30] everybody okay
[1:35:35] second Corinthians chapter 11 verse 13.
[1:35:37] if you dare you can say Amen
[1:35:41] for such our false word
[1:35:46] they are not false
[1:35:49] they are false apostle
[1:35:53] they are not false sinners
[1:35:59] it's false an apostle Apostle good false
[1:36:03] bad mixed together
[1:36:08] so when you see them they are Apostles
[1:36:10] but they are false
[1:36:12] so don't expect them to be Sinners oh
[1:36:15] okay this is a sin I won't listen to you
[1:36:16] no he's going to be an apostle first but
[1:36:19] he's false the problem is how do you
[1:36:21] know he's false
[1:36:25] amen
[1:36:27] deceitful how
[1:36:30] odisha
[1:36:32] transforming themselves into the Apostle
[1:36:35] of water how can you decode somebody
[1:36:37] like this
[1:36:42] do you think it's easy for you to decode
[1:36:45] music
[1:36:46] when I see people fussing I don't see
[1:36:49] what is wrong with this music I
[1:36:51] understand
[1:36:52] it's your level of discernment is low
[1:36:55] that's why you don't have the ability to
[1:36:58] decode it
[1:37:00] if you increase your life with God you
[1:37:04] will decode that quickly
[1:37:06] the reason why you're swallowing or
[1:37:08] you're swallowing it's based on your
[1:37:09] level
[1:37:17] let's go verse 14 and no Marvel
[1:37:20] for Satan himself is transformed into a
[1:37:25] water
[1:37:26] now let me ask you a question if Satan
[1:37:28] become an angel of Light and come out
[1:37:30] how are you gonna know it's certain
[1:37:33] how are you going to know it's Satan
[1:37:36] if you see the angel of Light standing
[1:37:39] like this how do you know it's not God
[1:37:44] but that's why you heard brother Branham
[1:37:46] saying the angel of the Lord is always
[1:37:49] scriptural brother Branham knew what he
[1:37:52] was saying you know the word all the
[1:37:54] time he needs to hear what is the Angel
[1:37:56] saying
[1:38:01] even made a statement if the angel of
[1:38:04] the Lord tell me something that is not
[1:38:07] in the Bible I won't accept him
[1:38:08] [Applause]
[1:38:10] why why because Satan himself can change
[1:38:15] into an angel of Light
[1:38:16] [Applause]
[1:38:17] [Music]
[1:38:19] Satan one appeared to you as Satan
[1:38:24] I don't see what's wrong with Christian
[1:38:26] music I don't see what's wrong with this
[1:38:28] music
[1:38:31] everybody okay
[1:38:32] verse 15 therefore
[1:38:35] it is no great thing if he is what
[1:38:39] also be transformed as minister of what
[1:38:42] whose ends shall be according to their
[1:38:45] water all I'm showing you by this my
[1:38:47] brother my sister it's a bad age
[1:38:52] in other words the way the devil work
[1:38:54] today the devil worked by deception
[1:38:58] the devil when he's attacking the
[1:39:00] children of God don't expect him to be
[1:39:03] brought
[1:39:04] he will always mix something with
[1:39:07] Christianity to bring it to you he will
[1:39:10] always season what he has with
[1:39:13] Christianity to bring it to you when I
[1:39:16] say Christianity your mind is always at
[1:39:19] the Pentecostal let's get to the message
[1:39:21] of the hour
[1:39:23] that's right okay let's go to Daniel 3.
[1:39:37] it is not correct
[1:39:39] the church is open and people are not in
[1:39:42] church something is wrong
[1:39:45] and they and they purposely will give
[1:39:47] you a correct reason
[1:39:49] but don't see that it's Satan that did
[1:39:51] that
[1:39:56] very good reason for you to stay don't
[1:39:59] come to church you can stream
[1:40:06] everybody okay
[1:40:09] you there
[1:40:11] let's go to Daniel chapter four first
[1:40:14] I'm sorry
[1:40:17] if you're there you can say Amen
[1:40:19] Daniel 4 verse 8.
[1:40:22] Hallelujah I want you to follow me
[1:40:25] carefully now
[1:40:26] verse 8 if you dare you can say Amen but
[1:40:30] at the last Daniel came in before me
[1:40:34] whose name was who
[1:40:37] So Daniel the king called him belches or
[1:40:42] betazar whatever way it's pronounced
[1:40:45] okay
[1:40:46] according to the name of my
[1:40:51] in whom is the spirit of holy and before
[1:40:55] him I thought the dream saying
[1:40:58] according to this verse
[1:41:01] amen King Nebuchadnezzar had a god
[1:41:07] everybody okay but he's God the name of
[1:41:11] his God was Bethesda
[1:41:14] which was the name that he gave to
[1:41:17] Daniel

[1:41:22] amen so the god of Nebuchadnezzar is a
[1:41:28] prophetic God

[1:42:03] of the appearance of the god of
[1:42:06] Nebuchadnezzar is Daniel
[1:42:09] but Daniel is a good man
[1:42:12] Daniel is a prophet
[1:42:18] let me bring it home

[2:19:02] the first instrumental music that was
[2:19:05] created was created in Lucifer
[2:19:08] let's go to Ezekiel
[2:19:14] Ezekiel 28.
[2:19:20] the time of confusion is over
[2:19:30] it hurt when you lay it out like this
[2:19:34] and the church is not there
[2:19:40] and tomorrow they struggle
[2:19:48] because somebody chose to cook today
[2:19:57] amen
[2:19:59] Ezekiel 28 verse 12 if you dare you can
[2:20:02] say Amen
[2:20:04] this is you know the scripture son of
[2:20:07] man take up a lamentation upon the king
[2:20:10] of tariffs
[2:20:12] and say unto him the king of tariffs
[2:20:14] that saved the Lord God
[2:20:17] that sin is up the psalm 28 12. full of
[2:20:22] wisdom and perfect in water
[2:20:24] that has been in water and we know that
[2:20:27] this king of Paris was not in needed we
[2:20:30] already went through this it was Lucifer
[2:20:33] because Lucifer was the devil was he
[2:20:35] needed amen
[2:20:37] that has been in Eden the Garden of God
[2:20:40] every precious stone was that covering
[2:20:43] the Sergio stopes and the diamond and
[2:20:46] the burial are the the burial I'm sorry
[2:20:48] the Onyx and the Jasper the sapphire the
[2:20:52] immoral and the carbuncle and gold
[2:20:56] you there the workmanship of the
[2:21:01] Lucifer have a tablets
[2:21:04] and of die
[2:21:08] was prepared in
[2:21:11] in the day that was what so when God
[2:21:15] makes Lucifer he's making Lucifer with
[2:21:21] built in with instrument of music
[2:21:29] and we are in the edge of laodicea when
[2:21:32] Lucifer knows it's almost the end what
[2:21:35] do you think Lucifer will do
[2:21:39] do you think when Lucifer was cast down
[2:21:42] God took the instrument of Music away
[2:21:44] from him so why do you play with music
[2:21:48] singer why do you play with music
[2:21:55] I know I I see singers are not here
[2:21:58] tonight but I would not tolerate any
[2:22:00] foolishness
[2:22:05] everybody okay because I know the danger
[2:22:07] in music
[2:22:09] everybody okay Lucifer himself
[2:22:14] we are a church that looks like heaven
[2:22:19] this church
[2:22:21] we got African
[2:22:23] we got uh Caucasian we got
[2:22:26] African-American we got people from
[2:22:29] South America we got people from uh the
[2:22:31] Trinidad we got people from Jamaica all
[2:22:33] over we mixed together right here so
[2:22:36] everybody have their own music
[2:22:38] which music is right
[2:22:43] which music is right
[2:22:48] you see now which one is right that's
[2:22:51] why I'm going by the word
[2:22:53] and the word is able to go through every
[2:22:57] culture every country and not every
[2:23:01] music that is wrong
[2:23:03] because this is universal
[2:23:07] this doesn't have anything to do with
[2:23:09] your culture your civilization your
[2:23:13] community
[2:23:27] everybody care so the first sentiment
[2:23:30] started by who Lucifer do you see why
[2:23:33] music is dangerous
[2:23:36] now when God created the Earth
[2:23:40] he created Adam we don't see any
[2:23:43] instrument of music
[2:23:45] with Adam
[2:23:47] amen then from Adam the serpent entered
[2:23:50] and created and uh not created and
[2:23:53] brought forth the lineage of Cain where
[2:23:56] did music start in the earth who started
[2:23:59] with it
[2:24:02] let's go to Genesis 4.
[2:24:09] Genesis chapter 4.
[2:24:11] if you fall you stop
[2:24:15] and then we pick it up
[2:24:18] Genesis chapter 4.
[2:24:21] everybody okay
[2:24:23] Genesis chapter 4.
[2:24:32] you there
[2:24:33] you there
[2:24:35] let's go to verse 17.
[2:24:38] you there and who
[2:24:41] we already demonstrated in this church
[2:24:42] Ken was from the seed of what
[2:24:45] the devil amen why didn't Adam come up
[2:24:50] with music
[2:24:51] let's see who starred the music on the
[2:24:53] Earth in heaven Who start with
[2:24:55] instrument of music
[2:24:57] let's see on the earth who started with
[2:24:59] instrumental music
[2:25:01] verse 17 and Cain knew his wife and she
[2:25:05] conceived and bear who
[2:25:07] and he built a city and called the name
[2:25:09] of the city after he the name of his son
[2:25:11] Enoch and until Enoch was born Arad and
[2:25:15] Arad beget mahu jail and mahuja beget
[2:25:19] massuza and matthusia begatlamic and
[2:25:22] lamech took unto him how many wives
[2:25:25] that's where polygamy started a man with
[2:25:28] two wives the name of the one was Ada
[2:25:31] and the name of the other was zela and
[2:25:34] other bear who
[2:25:35] jabal he was the father of such as dwell
[2:25:39] in the water and of such as have water
[2:25:42] verse 21 and his brother's name was who
[2:25:47] Juba he was the father
[2:25:51] the beginning of all
[2:25:54] such as handed the water and water
[2:25:58] so the first two people that start using
[2:26:02] musical instruments in this Earth is
[2:26:06] from the lineage of Cain from the
[2:26:09] serpent seed lineage
[2:26:20] everybody okay everybody okay brother
[2:26:24] Stephen what do we do
[2:26:28] harp was in heaven we sin up with the 24
[2:26:31] elders
[2:26:32] which were the Redeemer we see hope with
[2:26:35] the 144 000 which were the Redeemer do
[2:26:39] we need to play harp yes
[2:26:41] because remember the devil is not a
[2:26:43] Creator he's only a water
[2:26:47] remember from the beginning
[2:26:49] remember for the meeting
[2:26:50] okay so can we play organ
[2:26:54] that's why brother Branham say organ is
[2:26:56] the property of the church
[2:27:02] everybody okay
[2:27:07] so brother Stephen all instruments that
[2:27:10] we have are invented by the lineage of
[2:27:12] Satan
[2:27:14] anything
[2:27:16] let's go to First Chronicle 23.
[2:27:21] we are dealing with music

[2:27:38] I want you to write this down pretty
[2:27:40] good my friend and to remember when you
[2:27:43] write a scripture you put yourself a
[2:27:45] landmark you say this one is the lineage
[2:27:49] of Cain started in Sigma this so when
[2:27:52] you are looking for it you don't have to
[2:27:54] go opening the scripture you will
[2:27:56] remember quickly this goes with this
[2:27:58] this means this okay it's just uh a clue

[2:28:58] Bible
[2:29:00] David
[2:29:02] was not just a prophet David was not

[2:31:47] let's go to Amos chapter six

[2:32:10] my friend we just talk about vocal vocal
[2:32:14] words and non-linguistic we find
[2:32:16] mountain and trees and everything that
[2:32:19] have breath can produce music but
[2:32:21] instrumental it might be inanimate
[2:32:24] or it might be animate inanimate you got
[2:32:28] bunch of them here as long as there is
[2:32:30] no player nothing that's instrumental

[2:33:13] what like who
[2:33:17] [Music]
[2:33:20] so musical instrument has been invented
[2:33:23] by the lineage of God
[2:33:26] and the lineage of Satan just perverted

[2:34:05] signal and then he start back up then we
[2:34:08] got vocal and instrumental Blended
[2:34:11] together both of them are music meaning
[2:34:14] if you want to worship God you don't
[2:34:17] have to know how to play instruments
[2:34:21] you can worship god with your voice
[2:34:24] and you can play a free instrument given
[2:34:28] to you by birth

[2:40:42] who says this
[2:40:45] amen
[2:40:46] this is not a problem
[2:40:49] amen amen the psalm are written there's
[2:40:52] a bunch of songs in the book of song
[2:40:55] from 100 to from 1 to 150. none of them
[2:40:59] offend you but you can take those
[2:41:02] and and and couple them with sound the
[2:41:06] sound that is coming
[2:41:08] and the genre
[2:41:12] the type of music you try the the
[2:41:15] channel you're trying to take the song
[2:41:18] and channel them
[2:41:20] can twist your music
[2:41:22] and then it's no longer good
[2:41:25] why are we saying your music is bad
[2:41:29] the words are good Brothers even listen
[2:41:31] to the song I meant I'm telling you
[2:41:33] about this even some of the word he says
[2:41:35] is what brother Branham says I don't see
[2:41:37] what's the problem with the word brother
[2:41:39] say the same thing brother Branham says
[2:41:42] the same thing but that's not the
[2:41:44] problem the problem is what is the tune
[2:41:47] what is the Rhythm
[2:41:50] what is the Rhythm
[2:41:59] how many Amazing Grace did you hear
[2:42:02] Why didn't it stick with their original
[2:42:05] Amazing Grace
[2:42:07] we were fine with it but every time they
[2:42:10] have to come with an amazing grace they
[2:42:12] have to sing another amazing way they
[2:42:13] have to sing and before you know it
[2:42:15] Amazing Grace who was fun now Amazing
[2:42:17] Grace is now fasting Amazing Grace
[2:42:19] amazed finally how when can you leave
[2:42:22] amazing grace alone
[2:42:26] why because they are gauging all the
[2:42:29] young people need something take Amazing
[2:42:32] Grace and change it to the tune to the
[2:42:37] test of the young people of today so
[2:42:39] they will swallow Amazing Grace and when
[2:42:42] you come to me we're gonna start fasting
[2:42:44] again brother Stephen what is going on
[2:42:46] it's amazing grace I don't see what is
[2:42:49] wrong with Amazing Grace oh you want
[2:42:50] people to play music just like you or
[2:42:53] you want us to play country music
[2:42:55] hey

[2:49:12] say
[2:49:14] everybody okay now instead of saying it

[2:49:31] saying in other words when the guitar is
[2:49:35] playing it is not just playing

[2:54:41] language
[2:54:53] can I read it again
[2:54:54] brother Branham say
[2:54:56] even the birds sing lovely today
[2:55:00] I will certainly amazed when I walk in
[2:55:03] to heal the brother I have heard of him
[2:55:05] and he gave me some record was sent to
[2:55:08] me this week and now to hear the gospel
[2:55:11] preach in bird language
[2:55:16] well maybe that is what the bird are
[2:55:20] doing when they are singing like that
[2:55:23] preaching the gospel to us
[2:55:25] [Applause]
[2:55:27] [Music]
[2:55:31] can you say Amen
[2:55:40] Amen in other words the birds that are
[2:55:43] singing they have a message
[2:55:46] they are pretty brother Branham said the
[2:55:48] birds are preaching the gospel to us
[2:55:52] that's why brother Branham say his first
[2:55:55] Bible was what
[2:56:00] everybody okay everybody okay so when
[2:56:03] sand goes the danger of music sound
[2:56:06] contain or carries messages
[2:56:12] everybody okay
[2:56:14] we were on verse 10 our job to verse 10.
[2:56:19] on First Corinthians 14.
[2:56:21] if you're there you can say Amen they
[2:56:24] are
[2:56:25] there are it may be so many kind of
[2:56:29] water
[2:56:29] in the water and none of them is without
[2:56:33] what
[2:56:35] in other words nobody say just things
[2:56:38] like that right
[2:56:40] amen even our I had a patient
[2:56:45] they came from a certain country in Asia
[2:56:49] and the patient brought their father
[2:56:52] and I have to speak in English and they
[2:56:54] are translating
[2:56:55] and when I hear the translation it looks
[2:56:58] like they're repeating the same sound
[2:57:03] and the other one goes and I'm like is
[2:57:06] this really language
[2:57:11] but they are interpreting and the other
[2:57:13] one is understanding but if I hear this
[2:57:16] it sounds like
[2:57:18] you want to hear like Jesus Christ the
[2:57:21] same yesterday no you don't hear any
[2:57:23] word all you hear is
[2:57:24] I'm like what is that but they're saying
[2:57:27] something that's what Paul is saying
[2:57:29] there is no voices with that
[2:57:31] significance in other words even when
[2:57:33] you don't understand have a meaning
[2:57:38] that's why speaking in tongues come in
[2:57:42] play
[2:57:43] because somebody would say yes
[2:57:45] you don't understand but when The
[2:57:48] Interpreter comes he says here you are
[2:57:50] my people I am the Lord so and so did
[2:57:53] something bad but when you hear that one
[2:57:55] you don't understand because there is no
[2:57:57] voices without significance
[2:58:00] amen everybody okay
[2:58:02] verse
[2:58:04] we were in 10 verse 11. therefore if I
[2:58:08] know not the meaning of the
[2:58:11] I shall be unto him that speaketh a
[2:58:14] water
[2:58:14] and he that speaking shall be a word
[2:58:17] unto who
[2:58:20] job to verse 15.
[2:58:23] we're talking about music
[2:58:25] you there
[2:58:26] what is it then I will pray with the
[2:58:29] water
[2:58:30] and I will pray with the water
[2:58:33] watch the next one I will do what
[2:58:37] with the water and I will sing with the
[2:58:40] water
[2:58:42] so somebody can be singing in the spirit
[2:58:48] and if he's singing the spirit who's
[2:58:50] singing
[2:58:56] if you're singing with understanding
[2:58:58] this is when we stand here we're using
[2:59:00] under our understanding we're singing we
[2:59:03] know the song We memorize the song
[2:59:05] that's why we're singing but in the
[2:59:07] spirit it's not you it is the spirit
[2:59:09] who's doing water
[2:59:10] say anything
[2:59:15] words
[2:59:17] sounds God messages
[2:59:21] let's go to Psalm 49.

[3:01:05] and those music are not verbal they're
[3:01:09] not vocal and you want to hear it

[3:02:13] that is the way of preaching the gospel
[3:02:24] praying the music is preaching the
[3:02:27] gospel
[3:02:28] why the sound got a message
[3:02:33] everybody okay brother Branham continue
[3:02:36] he say the man preaches it by the word
[3:02:40] and my way is by vision won't you
[3:02:44] believe all the witnesses that God has
[3:02:46] sent you can't you know that God in them

[3:04:00] say I send my word and my word did what

[3:04:12] what
[3:04:16] everybody okay everybody okay you
[3:04:19] remember David and so when an evil
[3:04:22] spirit came on so David was doing water
[3:04:25] and when he prayed what happened to Saul

[3:04:36] plane
[3:04:38] somebody get here and begin to do this
[3:04:41] and the devil ran out
[3:04:45] everybody okay one time there was a
[3:04:48] sister playing and the anointing hit the
[3:04:51] system
[3:04:51] and the Sister Rose and begin to praise
[3:04:55] the Lord and they turn around and they
[3:04:57] saw the piano go in Iran singing The
[3:05:01] Great physician and brother Branham said
[3:05:03] he was the angel of the Lord that sat
[3:05:06] down and begin to play music
[3:05:12] [Music]
[3:05:15] in the message

[3:13:33] virginity just like that
[3:13:36] do you know how many young men find
[3:13:38] themselves drinking alcohol
[3:13:41] because you put yourself in the
[3:13:42] nightclub and that sink is running
[3:13:45] before you know it you lost control
[3:13:47] whatever is going on you just rolling in

[3:14:05] a certain way they have to increase the
[3:14:08] music a certain way why do they have to
[3:14:10] play louder
[3:14:11] because Paul and Silas were playing loud
[3:14:13] why are they also day playing loud
[3:14:18] because the more loud that they are
[3:14:20] using it the more they abandon the
[3:14:23] People by the devil before you know it
[3:14:25] when they come up there they like a
[3:14:27] bunch of fools they can do anything they
[3:14:30] can shoot anybody
[3:14:36] the sister that was shy is no longer shy
[3:14:39] from the nightclub
[3:14:41] [Music]
[3:14:42] she said I never drunk I never drank
[3:14:44] whiskey but by the time she's leaving
[3:14:46] the nightclub she already finished a
[3:14:48] bottle
[3:14:49] music will make you do that
[3:14:55] you think
[3:14:57] everybody okay let's finish it up and
[3:15:00] suddenly there was a great day of good
[3:15:01] and all of them and The Keeper of the
[3:15:04] prison awaken out of sleep and seeing
[3:15:06] the prison doors plural open he drew out
[3:15:10] he saw that would have killed himself
[3:15:12] supposing that the prisoners had been
[3:15:15] watered what did this
[3:15:19] the message that we stop with tonight
[3:15:22] sounds is where the danger of music is
[3:15:26] because sounds carry messages
[3:15:30] sand have something to do
[3:15:34] everybody okay
[3:15:35] I'm gonna seal with this
[3:15:38] let me put a Mark here
[3:15:40] so we will pick it up here let's go to
[3:15:43] Exodus 32 and we pray
[3:15:46] because I don't want to leave something
[3:15:48] here
[3:15:49] and then next time
[3:15:50] need to catch it up Exodus 32 and we
[3:15:53] pray
[3:15:56] if I continue we will go seven hours
[3:15:59] so we need to stop it's not an easy
[3:16:03] music a subject it's a big one I have to
[3:16:06] approach it this way
[3:16:07] so you understand the music
[3:16:10] and but I believe with what you already
[3:16:12] got now
[3:16:14] we should be not having any problem
[3:16:16] anymore
[3:16:18] you should be watching your singer
[3:16:20] special singer what kind of song you're
[3:16:23] bringing here
[3:16:24] whether in the message or outside the
[3:16:26] message
[3:16:28] whatever suggestion you're trying to
[3:16:30] bring you should check it yourself
[3:16:33] because as we go down the road I need to
[3:16:36] get in the musician themselves
[3:16:41] this is music that we need to get in
[3:16:42] musician
[3:16:44] amen what is a problem with musician
[3:16:48] amen so uh Exodus 32 if you dare you can
[3:16:52] say Amen let's go to verse 17.

[3:17:25] somebody put an ear and said
[3:17:29] that's War
[3:17:30] why

[3:17:37] now they're trying to decode
[3:17:43] what is the sound of your music

[3:18:09] music of love
[3:18:11] and when you listen to that music it's
[3:18:13] God but it's like they're singing to a
[3:18:16] lover

[3:21:05] Jesus you want me to trust you to judge
[3:21:09] some
[3:21:12] what about if you make a mistake
[3:21:17] because your judgment goes with how much
[3:21:19] God you have
[3:21:24] you're already struggling you're
[3:21:26] struggling in your life you're
[3:21:28] struggling praying you're struggling

[3:21:33] question and answer and how can you
[3:21:35] judge a song how can I take such a big
[3:21:37] responsibility with a lot of risk like
[3:21:40] this
[3:21:42] in the age of laodicea and give it to
[3:21:45] you
[3:21:46] to judge it no brother no I don't trust
[3:21:49] you
[3:21:51] good but the one behind you there that
[3:21:54] therefore there I have zero confidence

[3:22:01] age you will shoot your friend at school
[3:22:06] everybody okay because when you get here
[3:22:09] you will try to please the young people
[3:22:13] when they say this is the good one and
[3:22:15] the young sister goes like this and then
[3:22:17] tomorrow you you are now praying to and
[3:22:20] and your mind is geared toward what am I
[3:22:22] going to do to please them
[3:22:25] now you are in a different Channel when
[3:22:28] the spirit of God is going different
[3:22:30] the spirit of the Lord is trying to give
[3:22:32] you a song to match the word
[3:22:35] I won't get to that I will show you the
[3:22:37] order
[3:22:38] of the song in service
[3:22:41] two people listening to One noise let's
[3:22:43] finish it and he said Moses it is not
[3:22:48] the voice of them that shout for what
[3:22:51] neither is he the voice of them that cry
[3:22:54] for being what
[3:22:55] but the noise of them that do what
[3:22:59] do I what how can Joshua hear a song and
[3:23:04] Joshua is saying it is war
[3:23:08] and mumbosis come and say give me that
[3:23:11] he put like this say Joshua
[3:23:14] I don't hear yeah I don't hear that
[3:23:18] this is people enjoying
[3:23:21] war was in Joshua that he missed
[3:23:25] he was under training because later on
[3:23:28] God told him as I was with so will that
[3:23:32] be with her there was something in Moses
[3:23:34] in Allah in a higher level
[3:23:38] recognize Where You Are
[3:23:41] and be humble if we say brother stay
[3:23:44] away this is not good trust me as a
[3:23:46] pastor
[3:23:48] it takes maybe time for you to begin to
[3:23:50] catch the different noises you might be
[3:23:52] able to catch on the war war because
[3:23:55] Joshua was a warrior
[3:24:00] he
[3:24:02] sees War all the time
[3:24:06] everybody okay sometimes you need a
[3:24:09] backup from the pastor to back you up
[3:24:12] and say no no no no no no no Joshua
[3:24:14] pulled the sword back ah don't be
[3:24:16] quickly toward the soul this is not war
[3:24:19] something is going on in the camper what
[3:24:22] you hear is not really the the
[3:24:25] discernment that you have in what you
[3:24:27] see and what you
[3:24:33] verse 19 and he came to pass as soon as
[3:24:36] he came nigh unto the water
[3:24:39] that he saw the water and the what
[3:24:42] and Moses anger was water
[3:24:46] what was going on in the camp
[3:24:49] idolatry in the camp with music with
[3:24:54] dances idolatry this were not hidden
[3:24:57] doing that
[3:24:59] it is message believer
[3:25:02] a message believer
[3:25:04] that are doing this the message of the
[3:25:07] hour and the Moses
[3:25:09] this is message believer doing this
[3:25:12] and then Moses when he healed he said no
[3:25:16] something is wrong this is singing what
[3:25:19] are they singing who are they praising
[3:25:21] over there or they're dancing for who
[3:25:25] amen amen amen amen
[3:25:28] noises
[3:25:29] song
[3:25:32] Kerry's message
[3:25:35] the song that was going there was a
[3:25:38] worship of a false god
[3:25:40] he was a rebellion
[3:25:44] toward Jehovah
[3:25:47] and then the worship of another God
[3:25:50] and you came with a worship and with
[3:25:53] singing and with dances
[3:25:58] we stop here
[3:26:00] let me recapital it
[3:26:06] we talk about music today
[3:26:10] we went with two kingdoms
[3:26:13] two King zombies two power
[3:26:16] it means two forces
[3:26:18] it means two sources
[3:26:20] it's either God
[3:26:22] or it's either the devil God is the one
[3:26:25] who stood he's the original the devil is
[3:26:29] not a Creator he always pervert he takes
[3:26:31] what God have done and he perverted to
[3:26:34] something wrong and because of two
[3:26:37] sources we got two kind of music we got
[3:26:40] a Godly which is divine which is church
[3:26:43] which is worship which is Christian
[3:26:46] which according to Ephesians 5 it is a
[3:26:49] spiritual music all we got a satanic
[3:26:51] which is a worldly music or secular
[3:26:54] music which goes according to the book
[3:26:56] of First John all that is in the world
[3:26:59] is the last of the flesh the last of the
[3:27:01] eyes and the pride of life that is the
[3:27:04] characteristic of worldly music it's
[3:27:06] either for Pride or it's talking about
[3:27:09] last or a woman a woman taking clothes
[3:27:11] off for a woman sexy all of that the
[3:27:14] last of the flesh the last of the eyes
[3:27:15] and the pride of life that is what is in
[3:27:17] that music and God is in music but it
[3:27:20] must be the right one God is in dancing
[3:27:22] it must be the right one God is in
[3:27:24] chatting we must do the right thing and
[3:27:27] both God and Satan look for worshiper
[3:27:29] for followers God we found if you want
[3:27:33] to worship him it must be in spirit and
[3:27:35] it must be in truth Satan doesn't care
[3:27:38] as long as you bow down to him he can
[3:27:40] give you all the glory of this world you
[3:27:42] can be the most popular woman around the
[3:27:44] message or in the chat of the message
[3:27:46] young people you're going to find
[3:27:47] yourself in trouble in those uh feast or
[3:27:50] banquet or something because you're
[3:27:52] trying to please all the people amen
[3:27:55] everybody okay we need to know which age
[3:27:58] that we are living in what is the
[3:28:00] condition of the age we are in the most
[3:28:02] deceptive age of everything according to
[3:28:05] Matthew 24 24 it would deceive even the
[3:28:08] elect if it was possible it's the age of
[3:28:11] laodicea it's either it's not cold no
[3:28:14] hot hot means god code is the certain
[3:28:17] but it's an age of lukewarmness where
[3:28:19] they make something and your discernment
[3:28:22] is important on what you see or what you
[3:28:25] hear turn the volume off look at the
[3:28:28] clip that you're seeing what do you see
[3:28:30] according to Paul all things must be
[3:28:33] done decently and how in order because
[3:28:36] God is not the author of what confusion
[3:28:39] Church must keep order all the time and
[3:28:43] what is music music involves vocal
[3:28:48] itself called acapella or instrumental
[3:28:51] itself or a combination of both and
[3:28:54] those are sounds that are combined to
[3:28:57] produce something that is good good in
[3:28:59] form which is the top or the genre or in
[3:29:03] harmony which is the arrangement how
[3:29:05] they put the music together and it will
[3:29:07] bring an expression of emotion either
[3:29:09] Joy or sadness or dance or Praises or
[3:29:12] lifting up of hand worship or make you
[3:29:14] cry music can be written printed or
[3:29:17] music can be recorded the first one that
[3:29:20] David did is in first chronicles 16
[3:29:22] verse 7. by vocal we got words call us
[3:29:25] on lyric sometimes they call emnam song
[3:29:28] or we got non-linguistic we find bird to
[3:29:31] do that we find Mountain Hills and even
[3:29:33] trees instrumental we got animate things
[3:29:36] things that have life let's everything
[3:29:38] that have breath praise the Lord
[3:29:40] inanimate things that don't have life we
[3:29:42] already went to that the danger of music
[3:29:45] is the Sun what is the Sun what is the
[3:29:48] genre what is the tap of the music that
[3:29:51] is coupled with the song the song will
[3:29:54] have the religious word but the Rhythm
[3:29:57] the sound is the problem because that
[3:30:00] sound carry a message any question
[3:30:04] let's stand now
[3:30:12] the gospel can be preached by music
[3:30:16] and music can heal
[3:30:19] music can cast our devil music can
[3:30:22] deliver
[3:30:24] our
[3:30:25] everything okay
[3:30:27] what you already have today
[3:30:29] you should be able to look at music
[3:30:32] Ian backup singer I see some of you are
[3:30:36] not here tonight
[3:30:37] before you put a special that's why
[3:30:42] just as Joshua and Moses there was a
[3:30:45] difference in discernment that's the
[3:30:48] reason why we ask you submit your music
[3:30:51] ahead of time don't send the music as at
[3:30:55] 10 45 so you can bypass the customer
[3:31:01] okay so we don't have time to check it
[3:31:03] and then you send the music in the
[3:31:05] morning I want to sing no we don't want
[3:31:07] that brother John just kick it out leave
[3:31:10] it alone you put that for the next
[3:31:12] service send your music ahead of time
[3:31:14] let us view your music I have to be
[3:31:17] protective because I have responsibility
[3:31:19] of souls I'm not trying to be legalistic
[3:31:22] but church gather older we don't want
[3:31:25] anything coming up here because it's a
[3:31:28] danger
[3:31:29] amen amen so send your music before it's
[3:31:34] going to go through the song leader he's
[3:31:36] right here the next song leader is ready
[3:31:38] the herd must stand where I'm standing
[3:31:41] the scene where I'm coming from in the
[3:31:43] message that's the standard that we have
[3:31:46] for this church
[3:31:47] my standard is not Congolese tender
[3:31:51] that don't have Congolese standard for
[3:31:53] this church I only have word standard
[3:31:55] and that word goes to every culture
[3:31:57] everywhere I can release this and it can
[3:32:00] go to everywhere and it will match every
[3:32:02] culture so that is the standard it's the
[3:32:05] word so if you send your music and the
[3:32:08] song leaders say no no no no we don't
[3:32:10] feel like this need to be played please
[3:32:12] we don't want to fast
[3:32:13] sometimes he can look he say yes we can
[3:32:16] play this but please change this tune
[3:32:18] remove this we want you to play it this
[3:32:20] way just because we don't want you to
[3:32:23] convey a wrong message if everything is
[3:32:25] good he say go ahead and play go ahead
[3:32:27] and play everybody okay everybody okay
[3:32:30] so whoever is not here who want to sing
[3:32:33] if you hear them talking or chatting or
[3:32:35] calling you tell them what happened we
[3:32:37] got the scripture let's pray Heavenly
