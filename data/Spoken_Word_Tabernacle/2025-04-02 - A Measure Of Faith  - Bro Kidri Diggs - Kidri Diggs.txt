Not to prolong the time, let's just get right into the word of God. Let's have a word of prayer and we'll get into the scripture. If you have an unspoken request, you can acknowledge it to the Lord with an uplifted hand. Let's just bow our hearts to the King. Lord Jesus, Father God, as we truly know and believe that we're in divine presence, Lord, we lift our hands to you, Lord, in faith, Lord, knowing that you have an allseeing eye on every need, Lord, on every desire in this room tonight. And Father, we just pray, Lord, that you would help us not to crave anything that you don't have for us, Lord. Lord, help us not to desire anything or want anything that's not of your perfect will. And Lord, let us be content with what you have for us, Lord. And and look for that which what you have, Lord, to be perfected in our lives, Lord. And we pray the blessing of the kingdom upon this church, Lord, upon the families who are here, every listener that may be connected to this to this ministry, Lord. And we just give you all the honor and glory, Lord. Forgive us for our sins and trespasses, Lord. The areas in our life that no one else sees but you, Father. Keep us under your atoning blood. Amen. In the wonderful and precious name of Jesus Christ, we pray that church say amen. Amen. Somebody say amen again. Amen. Amen. If you have your Bibles, let's turn to uh Romans chapter 12. Romans chapter 12. And then we're going to go to Mark 5. Yes, sir. Amen. Romans chapter 12. Yes, sir. Let's just start reading at verse one. If you have it, say amen. Amen. The Bible says, "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. and be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind. Yes, sir. That ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. The only way you're going to look for that is to have your mind renewed. It says by the renewing of your mind. Yes, sir. Verse three, it says, "For I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think so soberly." According as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. That's right. Hallelujah. Let's go to uh Mark chapter 5. Uh Mark 5. Let's start reading at verse 24. Mark 5 and 24. The Bible says, "Yes, sir." "And Jesus went with him, and much people followed him and thronged him. And a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years and had suffered many things of many physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing better but rather grew worse. Now look it it it didn't say that she suffered of believers. Her her war wasn't against the church people. No sir. But just a natural answer looking for a physician or this one to take care of it. The Bible say she grew worse. That's right. The answer is not always in man. Amen. Verse 27. When she had heard of Jesus came in the press behind and touched his garments, for she said, "If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole." And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague. That's right. Amen. May the Lord have a bless reading of his word. You can have your seats by the grace of God. Amen. Praise the Lord. I trust that everybody is doing well tonight. Tonight by God's grace, I want to encourage you. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Because the word of God is is what we have. Church, every day we get up, we should feel inspired because God has given us something that the average person in the world doesn't have. The average person in church doesn't have But God has revealed what we have unto his elected lady. Hallelujah. To the apple of his eye. Amen. Hallelujah. So we are to feel privileged. Amen. But you know uh today my subject is a measure of faith. Hallelujah. God has given us a measure of faith. But let's look at it for a second church. Hallelujah. I want to start with with reading you a quote. And when it comes when it comes to faith, you know, a lot of times we put it on a manifestation that somebody else had. No, we're not doing that tonight. We not going to I'm not going to measure God by what he did in your life. I'm going to measure God by his word. Hallelujah. I'm going to measure him by what he said in his word because his word cannot change. And if he gave me his word, I got a right to see every word fulfilled in my life. Hallelujah. Glory. So that's what I want to measure my faith by. Hallelujah. And if I measure my faith by the word, all of the word has been revealed. Hallelujah. So we don't have a a a faith that's in part anymore. Hallelujah. It say for we we we the scripture says we understood in part and we done this in part. But when that which is perfect is come, that which is impart is done away with. So we, hallelujah, as believers should have, uhoh, we out here now. I might as well step on out here. We should have perfect faith. Hallelujah. A faith that can make a mountain in your life move. I'm not talking about crumble away. I said move. The Bible didn't say crumble away. It said move. He said if you believe in your heart and don't doubt that mountain shall move. God has gave us a measure of faith that can move a mountain. in the house. Yes, sir. Listen. But when it comes to faith, Hallelujah. The Bible says without faith, it is impossible to please the Lord. So, you can't even get God's attention unless you got faith. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Hallelujah. Without faith, it is impossible to please the Lord. Amen. And the Bible also says that he's a rewarder of those that diligently seek him. You know, when you seeking after something, that means you believe in it. That's right. Hallelujah. When you looking for something, that means you believe in it. Hallelujah. Oh my. Hallelujah. Glory. Listen, church. I want to read read you a quote. Yes, Lord. This is in a message proving his word. That's pro his word. Yes sir. Listen. Yes sir. If his children will only take his word. So he can prove it by you. [Music] [Applause] [Music] How is God going to prove his word? By you. Hallelujah. He said that's the only way he can prove his word. He doesn't prove it to unbelievers. They can't be proved. They are unbelievers. But it's not to it's not to unbelievers. It's not to it's not for unbelievers. It's to him that believes. And if he can find somebody who will believe his word, he will prove his word by you. So I'm saying tonight, find what you need in the word. Find your situation in the word and I guarantee you God will prove his word. Hallelujah. He says, "Try me and see if I won't manifest it. See if I won't prove myself." But the only way we're going to get there is if first we believe. [Applause] Glory to God. Glory to God. He doesn't prove his word by unbelievers. So if there's something in the Bible you're looking for God to do, you must first believe that he can do it first. That's why the prophet came back and preached a message called believe it thou this. Hallelujah. Not that, but this. See, we're walking in truth right now. Believe it thou this. I believe that he's risen. Listen church. Hallelujah. See, faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. Now we ask the question, how can something not seen be evidence? Because the evidence is you believing in those things that your natural eye can't see. So you are actually living in an unseen realm. Woo. The Bible said Abraham was looking for a city, hallelujah, that wasn't built by the contractors of North Carolina or South Carolina, but he's looking for a city whose builder and maker was God himself. See, his faith was in a whole another strategy. He wasn't looking to pay a bill on a house. [Applause] Where's your faith? He wasn't looking to pay a car note. That's right. He was looking to live out the promises of God. God never promised me a house note. See, I want to I want to the prophet of God say, "Let's get some of the unbelief out the church and let's step into something real." See, some of y'all are asking God to bless you with a house and you looking for a house, though. But the Bible says, "Honey, you live in houses that you didn't build. You eat out of vineyards you didn't plant. That's where my faith at. I ain't looking for FHA loan. I ain't looking for a conventional loan. I'm looking for that house God promised me. Hallelujah. Let's stop putting God in this natural color realm and let's get up here where the faith is perfect. [Applause] church. But the Bible says, hallelujah in Romans, he says, "For I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly." Yes, sir. See, I ain't losing my mind when I say God can bless me with a house without a car note, without a house note. I'm sober. I ain't drunk. I know what I'm talking about. I've seen my God do it. Yes, sir. Hallelujah. Come on, man. I've seen my God do the impossible. When my credit score wasn't nothing, God made it a 800. Amen. [Music] [Applause] Come on. I don't care what it looks like on the world's paper. We're not dealing with what man can see. And some of us won't step forward because we looking at our natural conditions. Oh, my credit report. Oh, my job. And I only make this much a year. Who is your God? Don't put me in these cuddle rims of tax brackets and all these things. With God, all things are possible. But it's according to your faith. Hallelujah. But look church, when when when we see this, he says, "According to God, have dealt to every man the measure of faith." Hallelujah. There's a measure of faith in this room tonight. Now, Brother D, what are you saying about a measure? Amen. Now look, if I want some water, if I want to put water in this bottle, I can only put 16 ounces. Cuz that's all this bottle will fit. Hallelujah. So if I'm filling this, I got to measure something that will give me 16 ounces. A gallon is too much. Two gallon is is is too much. So he got to he got to give out the faith. Hallelujah. that's able to hold it in the vessel. Hallelujah. The faith we got was too much for Luther. He didn't have a vessel that could hold what we got. The faith we got was too much for Wesley. He didn't have a vessel that could hold the complete revelation of Jesus Christ. The faith we got is even too much for Seymour. He didn't have a vessel that could hold all that's in the ocean. But in our day, God unleashed a measure of faith to this church. What kind of faith? God's own faith. The faith that created the worlds, the prophet of God say the same faith that created the world is in every believer filled with the Holy Ghost. Don't come to church and give me no 16 ounces. I want the whole ocean. Amen. [Applause] Come to church with them 16 o when God has restored the whole thing to the church of God. We are no longer believing in a partial God. [Applause] But you got to understand what God has given you. Hallelujah. We put God in a box and we label it on, well, you know, God just did that in the prophet's life. God just did that in this brother. God just did that in the pastor or just the evangelist. Has he restored or not? [Applause] [Music] Okay. Yes, sir. Now, let's look at it. If I say hallelujah. If I say, "Zaddy, I wanted you to make me some rice and peas. Some rice and peas and some plantin." Hallelujah. Or some curry or oxtail. If I come and make that request, she's going to make a measurement just for me. Hallelujah. Because it's only one person. So, she's going to measure how much rice and peas. She's going to measure, hallelujah, how much plantin, hallelujah, how much curry or jerk or whatever I request, she's going to measure it for one person. Hallelujah. And I'm here to tell you, when God opened them seals, it wasn't a measurement for one person. When God gave the revelation of the seven thunders, that wasn't just for one person. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But that was for the body of Christ. So you are to be feasting on the measure of faith that God has opened up to the church. [Music] Hallelujah. And this is the mistake we're making. Yes. Hallelujah. We can see what God did in a prophet. But let's understand something. That wasn't a cap. [Music] That was He wasn't the cap. That was just the opening. [Applause] That was just the cap being twisted off. Hallelujah. So he put a measure in that prophet, but he put the same measure in the bride of Christ. So it ain't just in Jeffersonville. It ain't just in Arizona. It ain't just on Sunset Mountain, but it's in to whomsoever will believe. Hallelujah. So, I'm challenging your faith tonight. I ain't going to be long. Y'all know I'm about to close. But look, church. Yes, sir. Let's go back to the meal. Uhhuh. Now, she makes some rice and peas. Yes, sir. And she makes some plantin and some curry and whatever else, right? And oxtail. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I got to have some ginger beer. See, for y'all who ain't never been in the Caribbean, you'll know what I'm talking about. Hallelujah. But this is how we eat when we over in the Caribbean. Hallelujah. But look, church, if she make that for me, that's just she's going to measure enough just for me. That's right. Hallelujah. It's going to be just enough for me and you know and I can eat it and be satisfied. But what if I come with brother Shimbo? What's your name, bro? What if I come with Angela? What's your name, bro? What if I come with Benjamin? What if I come with this sister and this sister and this sister and this sister and this sister and this sister and this brother? What if I bring everybody with me? She got to have a greater measure to feed everybody. Now, the thing of it is, is she capable to capable of feeding everybody? That's the question. Hallelujah. If she's capable of feeding everybody, if she's capable, she's going to get her team together and she going to say, "Hey, I got some people coming and I want them to leave satisfied." [Applause] [Music] Now, what God has done, God has opened up his word. Not just for me, but for brother Shimbo, for this brother, for this brother, for everybody on this row in that row. Now, this is the question. Is God capable? Is God capable of taking care of everybody's desire? Can God feed everybody? [Applause] [Music] Yes, sir. Can God meet the measure of faith that's in you? [Music] [Applause] Glory to God. Now, the Bible already said, "Be sober." Yes, sir. He's given everybody a measure of faith. That's right. But the problem is a lot of times we don't believe God can quench that hunger. Hallelujah. We live, Brother Kenny. We live in a natural realm. So often we try to put God in a natural realm. You know who did that? The Sadducees and Pharisees did that. That's right. That's why they couldn't believe. Hallelujah. Because they put our God in the natural realm. They say, "Hey, we going to stone. We ain't stoning you for the good works. We believe in it. We we we believe that you can heal the sick and all these things. We we we we not doubting you got faith for healing. We're not doubting you got faith to uh pay your tithe. Some of you Some of you still negotiating with God. Lord, I'mma pay this and then I'mma get back with what? You don't believe that he's Jehovah Gyra. If you got to negotiate, oh boy, getting tight up in here. It getting tight. You start talking about tithing. But church, hallelujah. You look at God and you think about what he's able to do. Hallelujah. But like I said, the problem is, hallelujah, we keep trying to put God in a natural realm like the Sadducees and Pharisees did. That's why their faith couldn't elevate at the appearing of God. That's right. They was looking for God, but they didn't have the faith to receive him when he came cuz they put them in a natural realm. [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Take your time. Yes, sir. But then, church, sir, they say, "We don't stone you for all the good works." Hallelujah. Yeah. We believe we we believe God in the prophet. We believe all the good things that God did through the prophet. But then they said, "Hey, we don't stone you for none of that. We stone you for you being a man, making yourself God." See, their faith was only at a level that when they saw a man doing God things, they still thought it was a man. Preach, my brother, preach. They didn't have the faith to believe that God could step behind skin. And when you saw that man, you saw the same God who had the faith to create the worlds. So he said, "We don't stone you for the good works. We stone you for you saying you being a man saying you God." [Applause] What a mistake. [Applause] Look, I even say this, and brother Simbo can make more sense out of it, but I'll say unto you, there's a five-fold ministry, right? Amen. And we will as a church, we'll receive the teacher, the pastor, the evangelist. Hallelujah. Huh? The preacher, the the the the pastor, the teacher, the evangelist, the missionary. Where's that prophet? [Applause] I ain't talking about of the age. I'm talking about in the five-fold ministry. There is a prophetic gift in the five-fold ministry. But you know what we've done? We've made a prophet an evangelist [Music] because we don't have faith enough to believe God can still tell you what you doing in your house. God can still walk up to you and have thus said the Lord in the church. [Applause] I've even heard some brothers say that if you have a prophetic gift, you need to forfeit it. [Applause] The prophet didn't come to take away from what God had given a believer, but he came to open it up. So church, when you come, hallelujah, and you sit in church and you hear the word talking directly to you, that is under a prophetic ministry. [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And I'm going to make some of you look real strange. And then the prophet comes and he says, "A man that preaches by inspiration is a prophet." [Music] [Applause] So when your pastor get off his notes and he start talking directly in your life and picking up inspiration in your life, what is that? That's a portion of the prophetic gift. When the evangelist come and he start talking to you what's going on in your life, what is that? That's a portion of the prophetic ministry. The prophet is still among us, but you have to raise up your faith. [Applause] Yes, my brother. We want to put it on a man. It's the Holy Ghost. [Music] [Applause] Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. But the question is look, I don't need, let me say it like this. Uhhuh. When God was dealing with Noah, right? He gave Noah faith, right? A measure of faith. That's right. To build a cruise liner. Brother, [Applause] I know some of you didn't been on a cruise before. Noah built a boat bigger than that. Yes, sir. With no blueprints. [Applause] Hallelujah. It was all coming straight from God. Inspiration coming straight from God. See church, that's what your faith ought to do. It got to rise up high enough to listen and hear God and live in that place he want you to live in. And that's what Noah had to do. Noah Hallelujah. He had to listen for God to give him hallelujah instruction to build Hallelujah. something bigger than carnival. That's right. That's what I need. Yeah, that's right. Something bigger than Norwegian. Hallelujah. Where did they get the inspiration from? Uhhuh. Uhhuh. It already started with God. It ain't nothing being done that God hadn't already did. [Applause] But he built the boat that the ocean couldn't sink. That's right. That's right. [Music] [Applause] God built the original Titanic. [Applause] It was so high and so anointed. When it rose up on the icebergs, the icebergs melted because of the anointing on the boat. Hallelujah. God, hallelujah, gave Noah faith to build something that he couldn't seek. That's right. But what he could believe in saved his life. Yes, sir. My brother. That's right. That was his measure of faith. That's right. Now, let me say something. Yes, my brother. I don't need to build a boat. No, sir. I want you to catch something. God doesn't have to come and give you more faith. [Applause] Okay, I'll make it plain for you. Let's just say if I was a farmer and I wanted to plant some red apples, I would get a seed that has red in the apple seed. God doesn't plant, hallelujah, the seed and then comes back and inject coloring in it. Everything it needs is in it already. And as it starts to reveal, everything that's in it comes out of it as it grows. [Music] We say, "Oh, God, give me more faith. Give me more faith." How can he? [Applause] He's giving you everything you need for the journey. It's already in your seat. Amen. And if that one ain't good enough for you, you take that same farmer and apple, you can get red, you can get yellow, or you can get green. But to get what the farmer's looking for, he has to plant that kind of seed. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So there may be a gift of prophecy in you and a gift of tongues in me. Hallelujah. There may be a word of knowledge in you and a word of wisdom in you, but God put that in you before the foundation of the world. [Applause] That's exactly right. So he doesn't have to add to you. It's already in you. That's right. That's right. Did not the prophet of God say when that apple tree is this big, every seed that it will ever produce is already in it when it's that size. So what does the farmer do? Hallelujah. The farmer plants the seed, steps back and rely on faith. [Applause] That's right. That's right. Trusting that what he planted is going to give him what he wants. And that's what God has done for you and I. He knows what he put inside of us. But this is where we where we where where we get crossed up. We get in certain situations and we say, "Oh, God, give me more faith." No, he's already given you the measure for that situation. [Music] I want everybody to pull out your big gloves and don't let this go over your head. You got to catch it. Hallelujah. God doesn't come when you go through a trial. He doesn't have to come back and say, "Hey, I need to give him more faith for this trial." What you need is already in you. It's that trial that's going to unlock it. It's the trial that's going to bring out what God put inside of you. Hallelujah. That's why I say I thank God for having cancer in my brain because it was the cancer that brought out the revelation of Jehovah Rafa. If I never had cancer, I never know that God could heal me [Music] without chemo, without radiation, without some special treatment. All I had to do was apply a measure of faith for that situation. [Applause] What did I do? Did I have to m I give you? No. It was already in me. It was already there. And the trial just brought it out. Anybody going through something? Anybody going through something? I'm here to tell you right now, you got the faith to overcome it right now. The faith is in you right now to overcome it if you would just believe. [Applause] [Music] Look, I'll go back. Yes, sir. I'll go back. Yes, sir. They criticized Jesus because they said, "You being a man making yourself God." They were looking at it wrong. Uhhuh. They were looking at a room. He wasn't a man making himself God. He was God making himself a man. [Music] [Applause] Now let me ask you something. Who are you? Who are you? I ain't a man becoming a child of God. I'm a child of God playing out the life of a man on earth. [Applause] God can't change the faith. It's the same faith. Yes, sir. And what does he do? He proves it to you right now. He's proving it to you. He said, "I'm going to let you bypass what?" Your what? Your theophony. That means you got representation in heaven. If I got representation in heaven, that must mean I'm a god. A theophony is a word body. And the Bible says flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God. [Music] I know I ain't taking this with me, so I must got something already there waiting on me. [Applause] Hallelujah. But we fail to even realize that our theophony is closer than what we think. The prophet says when you receive this message, that's what eagle's fool. You have heard from your theophony. [Music] [Applause] Now I'mma prove I'mma prove to you that your theophony is here right now. Right now. Not when I get a body change. Right now. Not when the rapture take place. Right now. your time. My theity is in this room right now. [Applause] [Music] You say, "Bro Digs, how can you say that?" All right. As I preach the word, faith comes by what? Hearing. Hearing. Amen. Hearing what? The word of God. The word of God. Amen. Now your flesh knows nothing of the word. [Music] So what is it about you that's making you say amen? It ain't your flesh. Your flesh ain't never been to heaven. So this is what's happening right now while I'm preaching. The word is going forth and there's a supernatural presence that belongs to you individually alone. And as the word is being preached, something walks up on you in your spirit and say say amen. Amen. [Applause] Say amen. Say amen. Say amen. Say amen. What is that? That's the measure that God has already put in us. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Some of us looking for the via when it been here all along. See, I'm about to close. Don't get nervous. I don't need faith for a cruise liner. That's right. Cuz when God was dealing with Moses, the last thing on Moses' mind concerning deliverance was a boat. He didn't have faith in him for a boat. [Music] [Applause] It was on a whole another scale. And sometimes God got to push us. That's right. So that what's in us can come out. And he'll put us in a situation that we can't understand with our own mind or see with our own natural eyes. We just got to believe whatever he say. [Music] Moses Moses didn't come out at least 10 times. God done miracles and their faith still wasn't where it was supposed to be cuz God wasn't done yet. You say, you say, "Oh Lord, I seen you pay my light bill." God ain't done yet. Oh Lord, I see you pay my car. God ain't done yet. Hallelujah. Church, listen. Amen. Noah, Moses got to a place Yes, sir. where he needed deliverance. He didn't say, "God, I need a boat like Noah." No, sir. He started talking to the Lord. He said, "Lord, uh, now look, he had then saw God do 10 miracles already, right? But then Noah, I mean Moses, Moses is so discouraged. All that God done in his heart, that wasn't enough. What God did in brother Brandham's life ain't enough for me. I need my own experiences. [Music] [Applause] And what I pray is God, if you did it in him, you can do it in me. because we come out of the same vineyard. [Applause] Moses didn't catch inspiration for a cruise liner. But then he comes and he says, "Lord, you know what? I've seen all these things." He said, "But that ain't good enough. Lord, show me your glory. [Applause] Hallelujah. That man say, "Show me your glory, Lord. I want to see more than just a a a mana from heaven. I want to see more than just flies being created." You know what he was saying? I need to see more than just Hallelujah. the third pull in somebody else's life. Amen. [Music] Hallelujah. He said, "God, I want to see you personally." And what did he see? God said, "You can't see me and live now." He said, "But what I'm going to do, I'mma pass my glory by you." And what did he see? He saw the hinder parts of what? Amen. [Applause] Amen. God's glory is the image of a man. You sitting with God's glory. You sitting with God's glory. I'm looking at God's glory. God's glory is in the image of man. That's why he came down and he created Adam in his likeness and his image everybody. All right, church. And then Moses sees the glory of God. But church, now let's let's get to the spot. Uhhuh. God wants to show Moses, "Why you want to see me? I'm already here. [Applause] Why you want to see me? I'm already here." Let's backtrack. He says, "Oh, God, I can't speak. I can't talk. I can't do the Shut up, Moses. Shut your mouth. Stop all that complaining. Now watch how God raised his faith. God say, "Hey, I want Aaron to be your prophet." And you be God to the people. Moses went back down to Egypt with an anointing on him. Let my people go. The God anointing was on Moses now cuz God had told him, "You be God. Stop crying to me. Speak and move forward." Yes, sir. [Music] Now he gets to the Red Sea and Moses start crying again. God say shut up the Lord. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. For those of you who can't give God no praise because of your situation, those of you who can't give God no worship because your bills behind or your children acting up or your spouse acting up, I'm going to tell you just like God told Moses, shut up. Shut your mouth. God is doing that to you so he can come out. You need to let him out. He's giving you a measure of faith for what's going on in your life already. [Music] But the more God reveals himself, the closer man looks like a God. [Applause] He said, "Speak to the sea and move." He say, "Speak and move forward." Moses, he didn't go up to the Red Sea and say, "By the powers of the Lord, God invested in me, I command you see." He turned around and looked at the problem. Se wasn't the problem. The Egyptians was the problem. So, he tells the church, "Hallelujah." Yes, sir. Look at his faith. He tells the church, he says, he says, "Now when God when God when God comes down in man, creation begins to listen." Hallelujah. Everything is listening to God in that man. Hallelujah. So whether he speaks to it or not, creation has to do what God says. Hallelujah. So Moses is now saying, "The Egyptians whom have you seen, you shall see them no more forever." And the sea heard that and the sea. [Applause] He never said anything to the sea. He spoke to the Egyptians. [Applause] Glory to God. Speak to the problem. Who are you speaking to? Speak to the problem. Speak to the problem. Creation will make what you say happen when you realize you are a god. They realized God was in Moses. And when God began to speak, creation began to obey. And the sea moved out of God's way. That measure of faith was already in Moses. God just put him in a situation where it will come out. [Music] Church. Hallelujah. Yes, my brother. Listen. Yes, sir. Hallelujah. The reason why I read the woman with the blood issue, she had this issue for 12 years. And the prophet said 12 is a number of worship. Yes, sir. Could you be going through it because you hadn't learned how to worship yet? Well, if they don't sing my song, I just can't get in the service. You supposed to be the song. Hallelujah. Do Hey, let me ask you something. Do you have a keyboard in your car? What about a guitar? You got a guitar in your car? What What What do you do? Hallelujah. When it's time to worship God when you by yourself, are you depending on the song leader or does it just come out of you? doesn't just come out of you. My God is greater. My God is stronger. God, you are higher than any other. God, you are healer. Awesome in B. My God. My God. [Applause] Ain't no keyboard playing. What's happening is experience then. That's it. [Music] Church. Listen. I got I got I got to get out of here. I got to get out of here. Yes, sir. I'm going to tell you how this came about. Listen. Yes, sir. Everything we going through is for a purpose. God is not giving you more faith for the situation. He's unlocking the faith that's in you. Hallelujah. Cuz the Bible says, the Bible says when he created everything that he wanted to create it, he stepped back and then he did what? Rested. So he's not working on your faith. No, he's already giving you everything you need. He's just putting you in situations where whatever you need, the measure of it is already there. Hallelujah. I had a measure for cancer in my brain. You might have a measure for diabetes, but you afraid to fight it. That's it. Hallelujah. That's it. Yes, sir. You might be going through something right now, but you afraid to fight it. But I'm going to show you. Take your time. You're going through it for a purpose. Listen. Listen what the prophet says. Take your time. Boy, this is heavy. Glory to God. Oh my. Oh, glory. Oh my. My alarm going off. Listen. Go ahead. What is faith? Yes, sir. The prophet said, but wait a minute. He said, "Have faith in God. For verily, verily, I say unto you, if ye shall say to this mountain, be moved, plucked up, and cast into the sea, and don't doubt in your heart, but believe that what you say will come to pass. You have, Hallelujah. Whatever thing thou sayest, is that right? You shall have it. Not me. You shall have it. What power has been given to the church? [Music] And then he comes and he says, same message. He says, but if it becomes a real revelation of God that you see it before it happens. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. That you see it before it happens and express it in word form. The word takes a whole and becomes material, a thought expressed. So church, that's where we should be when it comes to faith. If it's a real revelation, we're speaking it as if we already have it. That's what Abraham did. That's exactly. [Music] [Applause] But you know what stops us from getting there? Hallelujah. Living in the realm of sight and sight will always bring you to natural circumstances. And then we'll start to believe God according to the circumstances. Don't get nervous. I'm about to close. I'm about to close. We say, "Oh, God, Lord, I'm believing you for this house, but my credits go." That's circumstantial faith. That's right. Land flowing with milk and honey is already given to you. You just got to go take it. [Applause] That's exactly right. That's exactly right. Listen, circumstance. He says, "Now, yes, my brother." Yes, sir. As I bring this down to a close, look, listen what the prophet of God says, boy, is heavy. He said, "Now, there's something that's wrong. And in the beginning, God created you to be the master of every circumstance. Did you hear me? What you going through right now, God created you to be the master of it [Music] right now. I got certain bills due right now. But God allowed those bills to come about so I can be the master of my circumstances. When things get tight, I can be the master of it. Still pay my tithing, still pay my offering, and still say I'm blessed because he said so. become the master of your situation. Listen, listen. He says, "Created you to be the master of every circumstance." That's the origin. That's authentic. That's God's word. That's right. Listen what he says. There was nothing nothing could happen unless you was the master of it. [Music] He said that's what you were created for. [Applause] Then sin came along through the fall and blinded the eyes of it. And now Jesus came along. Jesus came along. I said Jesus came along and redeemed it back. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Before I Before I get out of here, take your time, my brother. He said when we were created, we were created to be the master of every circumstance. That's why God brought all creation to Adam. He said, "You name it." [Applause] Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, my brother. Yes, my brother. I'm going just see if he do what I created him to do. He already knew. He had trust in Adam. God didn't have a second thought. That's why he brought it to Adam cuz he knew Adam had his mind. He was the master of every circumstance. That's our origin. That's our beginning. He said nothing could in that state, nothing could come to you except first you were the master. [Applause] And then he said sin came in and blinded us. But then he said Jesus Christ came and redeemed it back. Hallelujah. Amen. So, let me ask you a question. How many of you in here believe in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ? [Music] Amen. Glory to God. Yes, sir. How many believe what took place on Calvary? The death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus. See, just that alone should break should put us into a praise dance. hope. That's right. Amen. Yes, sir. Because that is our moment in time where God restored us back to everything we were in the beginning. [Applause] So if you hallelujah believe in the resurrection hallelujah hallelujah the death burial resurrection of Jesus Christ hallelujah by faith that means right now you are the master of every circumstance in your Yes. [Applause] [Music] Glory to God. You said, "Brother D, I'm behind on my rent." You the master of it. God just trying to show you who you are. Oh, Brother Dez, I got sugar diabetes. You the master of it. Amen. Yes, sir. Amen. Are you afraid to talk like the master? Tell the devil, "Get out of my body." Get out of my body right now in the name of Jesus Christ. What? No sickness in the Garden of Eden. Was no debt in the Garden of Eden. Hallelujah. He's brought us back to everything that Adam was. Amen. He's brought us back to that measure of faith where all things in Christ is possible. Amen. Amen. Amen. But I tell you what he's doing. Hallelujah. See, I don't have a need for squirrels. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] That's what he needed. [Applause] That's what he needed. But I need a four bedroomedroom, 30,000 twocar garage square foot house. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] White Maserati. You thought I was going to say Toyota. I can get that on my own. I'm talking about things that are not possible. Things that only God can do. I don't need squirrels. I don't need a caribou. I don't need a silver tip. [Applause] something. We need We need children filled with the Holy Ghost. [Applause] We need healings in our body. I don't need squir. Amen. Amen. And I can speak like that because that happened. Squirrels happen. Silver tip happen. Hallelujah. Caribou happened. So I can say, I've seen it restored. I've seen that measure of faith. God gave the prophet faith to believe that he could speak a silver tip grizzly bear into existence. [Applause] Don't put it in the carnal realm. Y'all hear me talking about cars and houses and all this stuff. Hallelujah. Holly. But this is the question. If you need it, [Applause] if you need it, why not believe God for it? [Applause] Hallelujah. You might not need a silver tip, something. You might not want a caribou, but you want a husband. [Applause] You know what you need. You know what you believing for. He's giving you a measure of faith to create what you need. [Music] [Applause] Our faith in this day is not contingent on us creating squirrels. God did that to show us we can do it. God did that to show us we are in that time. And look, hallelujah. I'm about to go. Look, just like the prophet, so are you. You got to be pushed into it. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. He wasn't even looking for squirrels. He didn't even know he had the ability to create squirrels. But God put him out there in the woods all dry with nothing out there. And then he came down. Came down and started to have fellowship with him. Started to talk to him and he said, "What do you need?" And all us get all super spiritual. We get all super spiritual. know you need something from God and try to get all super spiritual. Lord, Lord, I'm all right. Then God rebukes the prophet. Aren't you looking for squirrels? How many you want? Now he want to show the prophet what's inside of him. How many do you want? [Applause] I'm not going to tell you how many to ask for. Whatever you ask for, you'll have it. [Music] Whatever you ask for. Ain't that what the Bible says? He'll put you in position. Yes, sir. So what's in you will come out. And he won't let up until you get what you asked for. He got one. He got two. He said, "Oh Lord, this good enough for me." Say, "Didn't you ask for three? Go back out there. [Applause] Some of y'all Some of y'all didn't walked away from your prayer. Get back in that prayer room. Didn't you ask for it? Get back in that prayer room. Stop being afraid. You asked for it. Go back in there and wait on it. Go wait on it. You asked for it. He told the prophet, "Didn't you ask for three? Go back. Go back and ask for the wait on stay right there. Yes, sir. And he stayed out there and waited on. Uhhuh. Yes, sir. And you know what happened? Go ahead. The faith that God already knew was in him to speak the word started to manifest. And the next thing you know, he had two. And then he sat there and waited on the third one. That's it. That's it. Just like he asked for. Yes, my brother. Look. Yes, sir. A lot of times in the prophet's ministry, he wasn't even trying to do something. God pushed him into it. God put him God put him on a mountain in a snowstorm. He say, "If you speak to it, it'll obey you." [Music] [Applause] Look at this faith. I'm trying to close. Where is that faith? What are you looking at? What are you looking at? Cuz sometimes God will do something that'll shake you up, but he's really trying to release and unlock what's inside of you. Remember, he told them, "Let's go to the other side." And then he came out there walking on the water. [Music] I ain't getting in no boat. Amen. Y'all go ahead. Remember remember he said, "Let us go to the other side." But they got in the boat without him. And then what happened when they got in the boat? The Bible said the storm was so bad that the water was fulling up in in the boat. Now and in one place it say Jesus in the boat sleep. Too many of us in our storm he's asleep. That's right. He in your life asleep. He in your situation asleep. When you going to stop fighting in yourself, it's time for you to go wake up the master. Go wake up the master. Look, glory to God. But then, hallelujah, things will happen cuz God's trying to get the fear out your life. You know what word I'm sick of? I'm sick of hearing my anxiety. [Applause] I'm sick of hearing that. Your parents, my parents, they never grow up talking about their anxiety. The devil didn't least unleash his vocabulary and we taking it right along with us. My anxiety, [Applause] my anxiety is troubling me. Ain't nothing but a devil of fear. He never heard of that 40 years ago. [Applause] church. Sometimes God I'm I'm I'm I'm trying to close. Sometimes God will put you in situation where what's in you can come out. He just want to prove to you that you're able. So Jesus come walking on the water. Yes, my brother. And the church who had healed the sick, raised the dead, did all this stuff, they never saw him walking on water before. [Music] So what they did, they saw God and thought he was a spirit. Let me tell you something. When things bad happen to you, it ain't always the devil. [Applause] Sometimes it's God trying to get rid of that fear. So what does he do? They begin to scream and holler. It's a spirit. He said, "Fear not." It is Ille. Peter say, "Lord, if it's you, be me to come." That was the only reason for the storm. That was the only reason Jesus was on the water. just to show Peter you can do it. Not only can you walk on water, but once you step out here, you going to control the storm. Cuz as long as he had his eyes on Jesus, the storm didn't even exist. It was going on all around him. But as long as his eyes was on Jesus, he wasn't even affected. [Applause] Jesus didn't say, "Hey, go fast for 4 days. Wait till the annual meeting next year, then come on out here. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go study Christ. The mystery of God revealed." No. He said, "Come." Cuz he knew the ability to walk on water was already in him. So he said, he says, "Come." Peter says, Amen. The water was solid. The water was solid. Glory to God. He looked up and he walked straight out to Jesus. Where's your faith taking you? It should be taking you straight to Jesus. Jesus walked. He walked out there to Jesus. He walked out there to Jesus. The water was solid just like it was for Christ. Yes. Look, look. Catch this now. Catch this now. Christ in you ain't a different Christ. [Music] He's the same Christ. And if that Christ walked on water, if Christ get in you, you will walk on water. Hey, Peter walks on water and then he starts looking at the circumstances. and everything around him and he starts to sinking listening to all the chatter when we was over when we was over at the other church. Shut up. [Applause] Care nothing about no other church. We ain't at the other church no more. God allowed that because there were some things that had to unlock. There were some things that had to unlock. [Applause] [Music] There were some things that had to unlock. Peter gets out there. He's looking at the circumstances and he starts to sink and what does he do? Cry out to Oh Lord, Lord. Now I want you to catch this. Yes, my brother. Once you get out there, It ain't up to God to get you back. The same faith you walked out there on. The same faith you walked out there on. Brother Kenny, I don't believe when he started sinking, Jesus threw him on his shoulder and said, "Come on, let's get back in this boat." No. Once he put his eyes back on God, the manifestation of God came right back out again. The faith that walked him out there was the same faith walking him back. But this time he getting back in the boat with Jesus right beside him. [Applause] Come on musicians, I'm closing. The woman blood issue. Hallelujah. Look. Yes, sir. I'm glad you remind me that. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. The woman with the blood issue. 12 years. Yes, sir. What makes her situation? 12 years. What was God doing? Uhhuh. Before all that time, she was dealing with all her circumstances. That's right. Going to this doctor, going to that, going to this meeting, that meeting, all the stuff. And then something click. Something dropped down in her. Jesus was coming. And I want you to understand, he wasn't even coming for her. [Applause] He was going someplace else, dealing with somebody else's faith. Hallelujah. But then she saw him. Yes, sir. And inspiration started to hit. Hallelujah. And this wasn't in a Bible. This wasn't a quote. She didn't get this from a preacher, but it clicked. It was already inside of her so she could speak to her situation. And then she said, "If I could touch him of his garment, I'll be made whole." Amen. The significance to that everybody else was touching them too. But they wasn't looking through faith. They wasn't in a space of faith where they were elevating their situation. She said, "If I could touch the hem of his garment, right, when she said that, somebody else touch it." And nothing happened. Right? She was expecting something and what she expected happened and in that moment she became the master of her circumstance and then she said if I could touch the him of his garment I be made whole and she fought all the way through. Amen. I ain't got time. I I can't be late to church tonight. I ain't worried about no gas prices. I ain't worried about Trump all the stuff. cars all I ain't got nothing to do with none of that. I just need to touch him. And she touched his garment. And then she said, "Oh, girl. Oh, child. Oh, Lord. Praise God. Oh, Jesus. Oh, God. Oh, God is good. Hallelujah. God is good. Hallelujah. As soon as she made contact, something happened." That's faith. Yes, sir. As soon as you make contact, something happens. Wonderful. In that moment, hallelujah. It was a truth, sir. That getting to Jesus, hallelujah, will make you the master of your circumstances. Hallelujah. Amen. So, I say to you tonight, my friend, remember the quote I read? It came out of the fundamental foundation of faith. Exactly. Right. Right. Nothing can come to you except first you're already the master of every circumstance. That is exactly right. That is exactly right. And I close with this. Hallelujah. You know what they do in in Chinese culture before they fight the battle when they meet up with one another, master to master, they look at each other, they say, "Right, right." So I'm closing. God bless you [Applause] church. I said master to master, master to master. I said master to master. Don't you know who you are? Somebody say, "I'm the master." I'm the master. I'm the master. I'm the master. I'm the master. I'm the master. Hallelujah. Somebody say hallelujah. Let's give God some praise in this place. I say let's give God some praise in this place. Wonderful. [Applause] Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Indeed, a convention. Oh, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory. Hallelujah. Do you see how God works? Everybody's unique. And I love the way he preaches because he's himself. And that's what God wants you to do. Wonderful, my brother. Praise God. Oh my. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Amen. To every man God have given you a measure of faith. Do you remember that scripture in Peter that say the trial of what? Since when he was your faith. Ah he was preaching. Do you want him to come back again? The Bible say the trial of what? Since when he was your faith. So the trial is trying what? It means you already have that faith. So the trial is coming to unlock that faith [Applause] church. I have a quote. If you want I can put it on the group chat. Brother Brandham say Moses was born with a gift of faith. I I have the quote. You want me to put it? Okay. Brother Brandham say he was born with that faith. Amen. So Moses didn't manufacture. Why do you accept the message and some people don't? You were born with a faith to receive the message. [Applause] Amen. Church. I told you my ministry we preaching you to go to the rapture. Amen. But before you go to the rapture, while we still here on earth, we must experience God. [Applause] So stop playing fake stuff, super super super spiritual people until we take mediocrity and we accept it for humbleness. That's wrong. God is putting you through those situation so you can unlock the faith. Who knew that that trial? Who knew that what is happening there is for people I mean it's for Peter to walk on the water. That's true. If it never happened, we would never have a story of somebody walking on the water. And I may even shock you. Peter did it without the Holy Ghost. [Music] [Applause] If a man without the Holy Ghost is doing that, how much more a child of God with the spirit of the Lord, church, this is a powerful message right here. Yes, I would even advise you go home and listen to that again. Remember God told you about the season and after the season he's bringing a message that remember you have a faith a faith that have been built in you for the season because brother Brandham only opened the top as an example. Brother Brown open the top to tell you the season has come. My brother, God bless you. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. It's hard even to get here. I I put it in the hand of God. You know this church when we came to look at that church at this church it was not like this. No sir. You know that right? You know that right? And when I came to look at this church I was not even a pastor. I was not even elected a pastor. Do you know what happened? Do you know what happened? Can I say it? Do you know what happened? We came with the committee. We got in here and then I look at the building. I look at the building. I went home and I pulled the plan and I told the brother I say if I'm a pastor I will buy that church and we can divide this here and put bathrooms and the bathroom will be here and we will do this this this and that's exactly what happened back then. I didn't have the money. I was not even a pastor. I was not even elected. Amen. I'm giving you that example to tell you finch you don't see. That's why Bam say whatever the Lord leads your soul to believe it is yours. [Applause] God led brother Brandham for the square. He led him for the karibu. Yours might not be the square. Watch what God is leading your soul to believe. And I have a news for you. You who want to be super super super spiritual. Brother Brandham say I would never stand on the way of somebody who want to take God at his word. So when I'm proclaiming my stuff, leave me alone because it might not be your leadership. It is my leadership. I will believe it and I will walk to it. The other disciple never asked Jesus to leave the boat. Everybody was quiet watching Jesus. But why was there only Peter? Because there was something in Peter. Peter didn't say, "Hey guys, you waiting for me?" No, my season has come. You stay in the boat. Me, I'm going. Are we together? That's why brother Brandham say Peter is faith. Amen. That's right. When God comes, don't wait for who is next to you. Move on. This is a powerful message. God spoke to you. So plain. We hardly talk with him. We just checked. I mean text like, "Okay, preach, preach. Okay, okay, okay. That's it." I didn't tell him what to preach. He didn't know what was preached here. He didn't know what we preach here even on Sunday and everything. He's coming up with all the where is he knowing all of this? The spirit of prophecy. The spirit it's written in the book of revelation. I can give you quote on the spirit of prophecy. That anointing is working and God is telling you. In other words, don't take this as an ordinary service. This is not brother Cadri. It was God in our brother speaking to this church. [Applause] He doesn't know what is going on silently outside. The trustee knows. The deacon knows. This the the treasurer knows what is going on outside here. You might not see it. We seeing it. Amen. You have not seen it yet. You will see it in manifestation. But I'm already seeing it. And God is talking to me. is telling me something. Because if I look at where the church is and how young the church is and the challenge, I will say I won't do it. But because I'm looking at Christ, I don't care what it is, we will make it. [Applause] Oh, glory to God. It was not me who had in heart to call him. It was God who put him in the heart that today he will be speaking here. Take this seriously. Whatever trial you going, remember you were born to be the master of everything. And I'm going to close by this. Go search. The first quil came quickly. The second one came quickly. [Music] The third one lingers and brother Brandham say do you see how God is training his people and brother Brandham got tired he say I'm leaving that's when God say hey you say three [Applause] do the visionary wait it will come to pass. Go back to that prayer line. Go back to that closet. I'm just summarizing everything. Go back to that prayer line. Go back and keep your eyes on Jesus. Hallelujah. Lord, you have been built for this, my brother. God richly bless you. Let's give the Lord a big clap. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Hallelujah. Lord, we are so humbled again tonight, Lord. By this love that is beyond our understanding, Father, that you left so many places to come down tonight, Lord, and Father, to grant unto us the desire of our heart, Lord. Throughout the day, we've been praying, working, praying, praying for this service, coming together, praying, Lord, that you speak to us, Father. And Lord, you came down in a supernatural way. You use our brother in a powerful way, and you spoke not only for this audience, but also for the invisible audience. Your children are all over the world that will take a hold of this promise of this sermon tonight Lord and be delivered for whatever situation they going through. Father thank you for speaking to us. May Lord Father this sermon always remain center into our heart Lord. Father as we go into our respective place give us travel mercy protect our brother Lord. strengthen him, Lord, Father.

Father, bless him, Lord, and bless this church, Father. We commit everything unto the hand in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Go ahead and say one day I'm going to take a step toward my theop.
