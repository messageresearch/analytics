down and took everything to the office and left everything that i had was theirs and took everything that was mine and sent them an email i didn't feel like i should even go face to face with them it was just that bad friday so uh i had filled out an application with a company another company online um sunday i had a little you know inside there with a friend i still haven't heard from them but i did go to another company uh monday morning and i walked in and said i'd like to fill out an application i recognized one of the guys there and and i said but i don't have a cdl anymore and he goes well you know he turned around like he was going to put the application back in the folder and said we're hiring for drivers you know i said just let me fill out the application so i went in the conference room fill it out and uh i said give this to the boss when you see him give him to the to the you know please and i was in locust that that'll give it away but anyhow i went to a mcdonald's i was going to pick up a biscuit to eat on the way home and something said well just pull over in two fold reason pull over right here in the parking lot and eat it one so you don't you know drive haphazardly trying to stick a biscuit down your neck and the second reason i just had a feeling you know just had a little feeling there and sure enough the phone rang and it was the boss man from

pushed the button and waited for the nurse and waited for the assistance and they didn't come so she dialed 9-1-1 right that's my mother and so uh she got there and you know the police came there at the time and they said well who who donald called the police said we didn't call him he said well who was betty kelly and he said that so she she called and i called her police came in there she told her she had been laying there for two hours she had been laying there you know when you're in there you're wet and at that age and you can't move so uh you know the lord uh allowed to call him so

said lord i'm going to get in there i need your help i need your help to get in there because i don't know when they're going to come and service me because you know things are just short and now

the presence of the holy ghost uh god just gave me a second verse to this song when i was real real young so it might not sound the best but it means a lot to me because it was my first experience with the holy ghost and and then the words just came out we were singing it and then i just i just the lord gave me the word so we'll go ahead and do it tonight as we as we call our pastor up but when i think about the lord [Music] when i think about the lord how we say me how he raised me how he filled me with the holy ghost and he healed me to the uttermost when i think about the lord how he picked me around how he placed my feet on solid ground and it makes me want to shout out hallelujah thank you jesus lord you're worthy of all the glory and all of the honor and all of the praise oh it

hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you jesus amen let's give him a clap offering tonight [Music] amen testimony after testimony our god is working amen yeah we need those testimony you don't know how he blesses somebody yeah sister sherrod gave a testimony one time here how she was at home not feeling good and she pressed it and came here and got healed and there was another sister it was last wednesday she felt the same thing at home she almost felt like what is going on with me and the testimony of sister sheriff came back like if she did it i can do it she came last wednesday before the service was over everything lift up amen amen so continue to give your testimony don't get tired amen here somebody needs a living god not a dead god thank you musician for everything god richly bless you remember there is a box there for question and answer so those who need who still have questions you can go ahead and drop them there i don't know when is the next uh house meeting so the deacon brother of it you are going to work with it amen yeah you already know where it is so that's not a problem i was sitting working on a sermon and suddenly when i was working on a sermon this could pop up because i was listening to brother branham and meditating so i felt like you know what i need to read it to the church and the first thing brother abel mentioned here he didn't even know probably why he mentioned it brother branham say in the message ordination but david give me more so we can blast that devil out amen we want to assembly and gather ourselves together in other words we need to go to church we want to set under the teaching of our brother here brother neville who was the pastor and partake of the things that is of god as he funds them from who amen he gives them out and we want to learn of god and seeing the day approaching we must assembly ourselves more of together we must love in our heart to do water let me repeat it again we must love in our heart to come to church hallelujah if we don't love church comma love who so there is a problem coming together what we call church is coming together to do what to worship see if we love christ we worship again you imagine a man saying he loved his wife and he had not seen her for a long time amen except you have a legitimate reason how can you say you love god and for a year and a half you've never been in church amen i'm just reading brother branham he was delivered to me and i'm just delivering that as he was delivered to me amen he said for a long time pass rabbi and say well i shall see her some other time see that is not it or wife saying she loves her husband or parents saying they love their children well it shows in other words your love can be seen by your life and the things that you do and i think our expression that we should constantly long to be in water you must constantly long to go to church that's why david say i am happy when they tell when they told me let's go into the house of water anywhere to worship the lord when each other seek for a church when we come together to worship him worship him at home worship him while we are driving our cars wherever we are worship the lord just do what so remember it's important to be in church genesis chapter 3. those that are not here i might repeat this quote over on sunday amen the devil is subtle go read the church age book the devil will kill you slowly he doesn't come one time and kill you slowly slowly slowly slowly that slow is to give you time to get used to the condition in other words to get condone you don't come to church on wednesday you don't come to church on wednesday you don't come to church on wednesday then he pushes to sunday then sunday sunday then two weeks after two weeks a month after a month six months after six months you're dead amen you're dead genesis chapter 3 verse 6. as we see the day approaching why one of this day they're gonna close the door amen so you will have all your free time to stay home amen and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes remember this tree is pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired that causes lust to make one water like we said before this tree of the knowledge of good and weak and evil this tree of the knowledge of good and evil got wisdom you know we're dealing with wisdom right there is also another wisdom amen to make one wise she took off the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also to her husband with her and he did what to eat let's go to proverb chapter 30. this tree can be eaten the fruit of it can be eaten where is that tree so we see where the fruits are amen proverbs 30 if you dare you can say amen you will need your bible today because we're going to travel with that wisdom up and down up and down amen amen proverbs 30 verse 20. if you dare you can say amen such is the way of who you might be seated such is the way of an adulterous woman remember peter and paul showed to us how many women two women the first one is a good one a good woman which we know is the bride right and in that woman there is a wisdom and her wisdom is who thank you and there is another woman which is a bad one amen but this one is an adulteress amen now verse 20 such is the way of an adulterous woman she does water you see that eating you see the eating in genesis 3 verse 6 the fruit was good for food and it was eaten amen and brother branham explained the serpent seed that he was not an apple tree an apple fruit or whatever it is amen now in proverbs uh proverbs 30 verse 20 the bible says that an adulterous woman eaten she's not eating with her mouth amen in case somebody is missing it such is the way it's her way of an adulterous woman she eats kama and wipe her mouth come on and say i have done no water she can commit adultery and there is no guiltiness no guilt zero it's gone anybody clear let's go to james chapter three paul two women peter two women a good one and a bad one and we found out that wisdom is a woman she has a house built with how many pillars amen if you don't know that i would worry seven pillars fresh kill remember that plus wine stimulation of revelation remember that and she have a table of seven course meal amen glory to god james chapter 3 verse 13 if you dare you can say amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord who is a wise man and undo with knowledge among you let him show out a good conversation his works with meekness and water wisdom we want to see the life of that wisdom we don't want to just say we was in our mouth but our lives are saying certain things amen because wisdom is a person we want to see that person that life verse 14 but if you have bitter envy and strife in your heart glory not in other words bust not and lie not against the truth in other words no matter what you're saying god knows the condition of your heart don't fool yourself and don't boast amen verse 15 this wisdom the wisdom that have a wicked heart it's a wisdom but that wisdom have a wicked heart remember the woman in uh proverbs 7 had a wicked heart which the bible called as a subtle heart which is the heart of the serpent am i clear this wisdom descend not from above so there is a wisdom that is from this earth and there is a wisdom that is from above but the wisdom that is from above is found only in the bride because the bride becomes christ and christ is the wisdom in the bread that's why paul said that ye are wise in christ ever clear but there is another wisdom that is not from above but it's a wisdom that is coming from the earth it is an earthly wisdom specialized in sex amen this wisdom descend not from above but is water earthly and water essential based on feelings all about this world everything every song everything they're doing is just about women everything around women amen it's essential and is what devilish coming from the devil for where envy is where envy and strafe is there is water and god is not the author of confusion and every evil work verse 17 but the wisdom that is from above is first water pure then water peaceable then gentle and easy to be water you're not a difficult person to deal with amen you could be difficult before your conversion but when you become in quest your conversion will change your makeup and you are easy and treatable amen full of water and good water without partiality no favoritism and without water hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make water blessed be the name of the lord let's pray now heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us thank you lord father for the testimony and how you working in a marvelous miraculous way lord in the life of your children delivering blessing feeling changing transforming bringing closer to you lord and many other things that we can code that you are doing in the life of your children father we thank you for this opportunity and we are committing ourself unto the hand father may you move us completely out of the way may you come down tonight again lord father to bless our soul and minister to us lord may every demonic spirit that is contrary to your word be completely out of this place may the devil and his wisdom be sealed out lord but may only the wisdom of the bread which is christ be sealed in lord may you speak to us lord in a powerful way tonight lord as we commit everything unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you all we are continuing on our subject we are on part 30. everybody cleared so far now when we spoke on sunday there was a quote that i want to rehearse again and brother branham says in that quote that if you want to know what condition the church is watch the way women act she is the church in other words whatever you see among the women it's nothing else but a spiritual reflection on what is going on among the churches amen but we know that we always have two churches we have a good bride and we have a false bride and we have a good vine and we also have a bad vine everybody clear so see how immoral indecent watch look where the church is at just watch it see just watch women you see where how your women degrade and become so polluted that is the way your church is the natural condition of a woman is exactly the anointing that is on the church anybody clear that's why when the gospel comes it seems like the gospel is too hard on the women because when you change the women it is automatically giving you the stage or the temperature of a church everybody clear if the women are worldly something is wrong with the word that has been preached in that church amen blessed be the name of the lord in revelation 17 verse 1 to verse 6 the bible says that so he carried me away in the spirit we went through this into the wilderness and i saw a woman this is a prostitute sit upon a scarlet color beast we explained that on sunday full of the blast name of blasphemy having water just like the bride had seven pillars this woman also has seven heads what are these heads amen because the pillar of the bread are the foundation of the brother this is where the bird sits amen upon the gospel of the messenger amen she has seven heads and ten horns and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color if you remember paul and peter gave us a characteristic that's number one she bred her hair oh she played it there everybody clear number two costly apparel everybody clear number three it's gold and number four is pearl everybody clear and now the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet which is checking the gold the coast apparel and deck with gold gold is right there and precious stone and pearl it's right there but if you watch right here pio john does not give us a description of the hair of the woman paul and peter gave us the description of a prostitute in their time ever clear in their time ever clear but when john described a prostitute woman john is kind of omitting the condition of her hair so how are we going to know what to do amen and deck with god and precious stone and pearl having a golden cup in her hand full of the abomination and the filthiness of her fornication that is the spirit upon the churches and upon her forehead was a water this woman has a name we want to know who she is she has a name what is your name her name is water if the name is a mystery how are you going to know it amen she has a name but that name is a mystery so that name need to be decoded anybody clear because what they say is mystery babylon de water babylon only tell you from where abraham came out which is the foundation of our faith amen in other words upon this woman there is a babylon a babylon anointing or a hidden or a pagan anointing do you follow me but her name is still under a mystery amen so to understand this woman better we must be able to decode the name of that woman anybody clear so far brother branham says this in the exposition of the church ages he says a mystery requires water teaching of the spirit or it never become water so if you want to know the name of this woman you need to be taught by the anointing of god to be able to decode that woman and once you know the name you can identify who that woman is and once you identify who the woman is you will look at the characteristic of that woman and it's gonna tell you the end time condition upon the churches everybody clear so far how we need to hear from god and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and to know in the exposition of the seven church ages in the tartarian churches brother branham say in this tartarian church age she is a water so this woman this prostitute has a dominating spirit a dominating spirit upon a woman is a curse ever clear it's a curse you can dominate verbally or you can dominate silently the domination verbally is a woman that is so expressive but another one don't talk so much but she can behave a certain way to make you do exactly what she wants you to do everybody clear praise the name of the lord she is the mystery water what is that mystery is mystery babylonian emma she is the great water so this woman is an adulteress she's a prostitute she is who you need a prophet to decode the name of the woman so the anointing on the end time church the anointing that is upon every single church in the world except the bread of jesus christ is the anointing of jezebel so you need to go back in the bible check who jezebel is what did jezebel do so you're going to understand why the women are behaving the way they are behaving because the name was a mystery it took a prophet to unfold the mystery everybody clear so far she is a great hole she is jezebel the false water so there is a prophetic also anointing here it's a false prophetic anointing here what is going on a prophetess why because the true female is submissive to god christ is ahead we saw that on sunday she has no word but what no thought but what no leadership but what because christ is the head christ think for her christ talks for her christ lead her but what about this church she has cast out the water so once you take the word of god the pillar of the day the message of your time once you rejected automatically you are reflecting jezebel why is worthiness following it's a spirit of jezebel amen she cast out the word destroyed the bibles and worthy essay of the godly every brochure every sermon that is godly from the messenger she's going to destroy them amen she has slammed those who would preach the water it's an anointing that attack good preachers amen it's an anointing that is after good preacher to kill them spiritually before you know it this one dead this one dead this one dead by being dead this one also rejected the word this pastor also rejected the word this pastor also rejected the word it is jezebel killing her amen she has taken over kings prince is a nation control armies and insists that she is the true body of christ and that her pope are the vicars of christ she is entirely seduced by the water by devil until she turns she in her turn in turn has become the seducer of what once that anointing hits you you become the agent of satan once eve at the fruit she took that fruit unto adam she is the bride of who just like the bride is the bride of christ this woman is the bride of satan am i clear she is the bride of satan she has produced his bastard chad religion everybody clears so far so this prostitute of revelation 17 is nothing but jezebel so if jezebel is going to appear on the end time no wonder elijah also must appear on the end time because the two work together that's why i must send you elijah the prophet because the anointing of the end time church is gonna be jezebel the one who knows how to handle jezebel is the spirit of elijah because that's where the wisdom of god is to protect you from jezebel they know each other jezebel and elijah knows each other amen when jezebel is on the scene you can bring anointing after anointing she can resist but once elijah come because elijah will kill the prophet of bow jezebel killed the prophet of god elijah also killed her prophet by the sword he takes the message of elijah to destroy the nomination hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord now we continue she has a name written the name is what a mystery what is her name tonight where does brother branham get that name revelation 2 verse 20 notwithstanding this is the church of tartarian i have a few things against you about here because they have suffered that woman water jezebel in the church ages everybody clear which called herself a water to do what when a woman is a preacher she's under jezebel anointing every single woman that preaches the word that are called pastor in denomination they under the anointing of jezebel that's why paul attacked that anointing that a woman should not take authority upon men but it's jezebel who gave the woman the god to preach the gospel hallelujah to teach and to seduce because he became certain agent to seduce my water to commit what fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto adam and i gave her a space to repent of her fornication and she repented water it's an anointing once he hit somebody pretty good you're gonna have a hard time bringing that person back to god because once the word of god has been enlightened to somebody if they reject that word they crucify christ the second time afresh and there is no more redemption hallelujah behold i will cast her into a bed and then that coming to otto adultery with her into great water tribulation you remember that question you remember that question okay except they repent of their deeds verse 23 i will kill her water so this woman has children jezebel has children everybody remember she is a church she is the bride of satan she also have children i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he which search of the ranks and heart and i will give unto every one of you according to your work now in matthew chapter 11 verse 19 the bible says the son of man came eating and drinking and they say behold a man glutenous and a wine bible and a friend of publican and sinner but wisdom is justified of her what so just like this woman have children wisdom also have children ever clear praise be the name of the lord galatians chapter 4 verse 26 but jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of water you are birthed into jerusalem from abroad which is the bride of jesus christ and the bride is the wife of christ and the wife have a children so when you are born again in christ you become a child of wisdom amen just like when you under jezebel religion you under her anointing as a child that's why she is the mother of her lord she is a prostitute her children also are prostituted christ is wisdom and christ children also are what wisdom ever clear blessed be the name of the lord let's continue so she is the mother of harlot she have children an abomination of the earth let's see exodus chapter 19. the bible says here we went through this that now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the earth is mine this promise was given to israel not the gentile and you shall be unto me a kingdom of water priests and a holy nation these are the words which you shall speak unto the children of water but we see that israel rejected christ and by rejecting christ the blessing of abraham that was supposed to go to the jews turn and went into the gentile and when he went into the gentile the gentile brad became the holy nation that peculiar people and the holy priesthood first peter chapter 2 verse 5 ye also as lively stone are built up a water a house made with seven pillars ever clear a holy water so the good woman which is the bread is a holy priesthood hallelujah a holy priesthood that's the woman comer to offer up spiritual sacrifice acceptable to god by who jesus christ verse number nine but you are a chosen one and a royal water so not only is that priesthood holy but that priesthood is also royal royal speaks of kings ever clear and holy priesthood speaks of priests you have the priest and the king do you follow me hallelujah a royal priesthood a holy nation that was given to israel a peculiar people that was given to israel that you should show what fourth you should demonstrate i gave it to israel israel kick it out i'm going to the bride now the bride when they receive me they become christ and they begin to be written epistles showing false the presence of him who has called you out of what he denies me into the marvelous light ever clear so this priesthood is a holy priesthood and it's also royal which is speaking about kings everybody clear so far revelation 1 verse 5 and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the water kings of the earth unto him that did want to loved us and water brother branham said that word wash means he loosed you everybody here and washed us from our sins into his own blood and he has made us water and what he made as king and what he didn't just make you priest only he makes you priest and king he didn't make you king only he make you king and priest why does he have to combine prison king why not only priest why not only king why he has to combine king and priests together everybody clear hebrew chapter seven verse one for this who mercy said who is he and what amen because your king christ who is melchizedek because melchizedek became jesus christ melchizedek was king and what priest so you being the children of god you also are made king and what you are just like jesus christ you are god you are christ you are messiah you are kings and priests just like melchizedek because you are under the order of melchizedek hallelujah melchizedek king and priest king of salem jerusalem jerusalem which is your mother and priest of the most high god that's why when you are birthing to him automatically you are king and you are preached under the melchizedek order which is eternal everybody clear now if we are king if we are priests what do we have to worry about this woman amen proverbs 31 verse one and three the word of who this is a king speaking let's hear the prophecy that he is what mother taught him this mother is a wise mother it is a wise bride it is a bra it is a wise queen ever clear she's teaching the kings what are you teaching the king mama what my son and what the son of mamba birth in jerusalem and what the son of mabel the son of a covenant give not that strength unto you women know that way to that which destroys the water so we men destroy us king about here women will destroy king it will destroy you spiritually and it's going to destroy you naturally solomon missed that one and he was destroyed by women amen and solomon when he put proverbs 31 we said remember the king are destroyed by women ever clear if the king are destroyed by women what do we have to do in revelation chapter 14 verse 1 and 5 and i look and the lamb stood on my sana sion and with him a white and forty-four thousand having his father named seal in the forehead remember on this end time there is a jezebel god is sending an elijah to take care of the widow of surrepta because the widow of surrepta and elijah was under the same caliber everybody here to bring wisdom spiritual food inducism that are created by the spoken word to withstand the chaos that jezebel has caused on the land with ahab are you there so you need elijah to be protected by women and once the ministry of elijah which is the seventh hill ministry is finished that ministry goes into israel to pick up the and forty four thousand because jezebel is still there elijah must go also there hallelujah and i heard the voice from heaven as the voice of many waters and the voice of a great water that thunder that hit sunset mountain and brought the seventh seal is turning into the seventh trumpet going to the jews and i heard the voice of water harper helping with water remember when israel was taken to captivity by the river of babylon when they went there what did they do they could not work they could not play the harp the bible said they took the hub and they hang it on the tree because they could not sing the song of zion in a strange land that land was the land of babylon but they are they are singing with help because they have been delivered from babylon now they're back in the promised land which is the message of their day now they can play the harper hallelujah how many notes they have some by the rivers of babylon how many knows that few people which one is the 127 let's go to psalm 127. i see few people don't want to lose anyone if i have a good remembrance it should be psalm 127. if not brother michael you found it no it's not 127. by the rivers of babylon it's 137 let's go to psalm 137 it keep it ringing in me 37. amen 127 it's except the lord built if ab house psalm 137 if you dare you can say amen by the river of water remember this woman is babylon right by the rivers of babylon there we sat down yeah we wept when we remember what because we were taken away captive we hung our water hops upon the water the willow is a whipping tree anybody clear we hang our harp upon the wheelers in the midst thereof they only sing those songs when you're in in israel anybody clear for day that carries us away captive the babylonian require of us a water a song and then they darwested us require of us a military saying seeing as one of the songs of what this message cannot be preached under denomination are you there you cannot compromise going back to the nomination preaching the message hallelujah how shall we sing the lord's song in a water you cannot preach this message under the hospice of jezebel you don't preach this message in babylon when you get to babylon what do you do you take the arp off because it's a different song amen how shall we sing the lord's song in a strange land if i forget you or jerusalem let my right hand forget her weapon if you notice on verse 2 the harp was stopped but when you come right here on verse 2 right here again do you see here verse 2 the mathematics of god here they took once that great time they hit israel i heard the voice of water harper doing water hopping because they are redeemed back again in the promised land now we can sing the song of zion everybody here and as the song he wear a water a new revelation it's a thunder that is coming from the gentiles hit them they got a fresh message before the throne and before the forebeast and the elder and no man could learn that song by the 144 water thousand which were redeemed from the water that's why they can sing those songs but now watch something these are dead which were not defiled with what what protect them against women are you there what protect the hundred and forty four thousand against women it is the same anointing that protect the blood aggress women when it goes to elijah back to the jewish people that anointing will also protect the hundred and forty four thousand not to defile with women ever here not to defer with women for their what they kept themselves virgin what are women glory to god amen in the message gabriel instruction to daniel john could not understand them but he looked back and he saw on my sana we just read it glory a hundred and forty four thousand that had not been defiled with water women they were jews women means water everybody here which churches they had not joined no water come on lutheran camera methodist camera baptist camera and presbyterian in other words there is a message that will come that will block them from going under the nomination amen so they have been protected against the women of the day why are they protected against the women because the anointing upon the churches is a jezebel anointing it's a killer anointing it's an anointing of fornication it's an anointing of adultery if an anointing of satan she is the queen of satan if you're sleeping stand up there i don't want to call your name everybody clear amen blessed be the name of the lord now this spirit that you see moving anything today just like a government a church or anything it is controlled by water you understand now organization are controlled by what church organizations are controlled by spirit churches are controlled by spirit individuals are controlled by spirit nations are controlled by spirit and spirit was made before the cosmic mother and life in other words you must be careful which church you're going in because churches carry spirits hallelujah expectation there is not two holy spirits there is only one's holy spirit the bible said by one spirit and if the holy spirit is in churches leading people he will lead them all the same and then you will know whether your church was right or not it shall compare with the leading of the holy spirit in the beginning the way you did that the first place because god does not change hallelujah what about i'm saying about the choosing of the brand he said the same apply by choosing a church now you must pray over the church that you are following you you are fellowshipping in remember churches carrier spirit that's why you must be careful not to fall under a church that has a jezebel spirit are you there what makes you choose the church what makes you choose a pastor we begin to choose pastor by our feelings oh my god now i don't want to be critical but i realize i'm an old man and i got to live here one of these days and i got to answer at a day of judgment for what i'm well for what i said tonight or any other time and i therefore i got to be dead earnest and truly convicted by you go into a church and you watch the behavior of that church you just watch the pastor a while and you shall usually find that the church act like the word that's why the pastor must stay with the word so the church will act like the world hallelujah sometime i wonder if we just don't get one another spirit instead of the holy spirit you go to a place where a pastor is a real radical and carrying on you shall find out the congregation is the same way it shall bring you to a church where i see a pastor stand jerk their heads back and forth you watch the congregation they do the same thing you take a pastor that just gulp down anything usually the church will do the same thing so if i was choosing a church hallelujah i choose a genuine because jezebel is raging on the end time i choose a genuine camera fundamental come on full gospel come on baby church camera if i was choosing one to put my water people choose church with other different condition you choose a church because your friend is there you choose a church because your wife friend is over there you choose a church because your children friends are over there you choose a church because the pastor is an african you choose a church because the pastor is a white man you choose a church because the pastor is a black man that is the wrong choice you must pray and let god send you to a church where you belong are you there what are people choosing for they can preach the world they don't care they care about their friends over there they care about that family over there what about if your friend lives what are you gonna do there was a man i knew leaving another state moved to north carolina amen got in trouble in north carolina want to leave and go back to the state he wanted to he said brother stephen can we go i said no i won't go with you if the lord sent you he didn't say anything to me he went back over there and got in trouble again now he's in another state being a pastor again if i would have followed that person where would i be today amen god deal with gentile individual amen you must have a personal relationship of your life and the church you going to not church because somebody goes no church because mama goes no church because of your preference it's a shame you watch what people are doing in the message hallelujah i have went into meetings i want to ask you something you go in a meeting a pastor that jerk his head watch everyone in the congregation jerk the hand you go to a meeting that's a pass to a real wildfire run about you watch everyone in the congregation act the same way but you go in a place where a pastor is a solid gospel teacher all hell will never move the church [Music] that's why we must stay with the world we must repeat what the prophet say because that is the manner that is needed for the bride hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord i saw the woman drinking with the blood of the saint and with the blood of the martyr of jesus christ she's a killer and when i saw her i wonder with great admiration and here is the man which has the water that which don't back again with elijah everybody clear the seven heads all seven weapons just like the bride have seven pillars make sense this woman also have seven heads which are seven mountains which are seven foundation what are your foundation the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sitteth that's her foundation the bride is sitting upon seven pillars here also have seven mountains what does he mean brother stephen how many hills how many cities in the world though that the church sits on seven hills only where is that at the vatican city in rome the bible said that this horrible hole that made all the world commit fornication and brought a bunch of little daughters her children to teach about the same thing she did they become carrier they was not bad as hell but they were harlot taught them the same thing the beginning of it will be a woman or a church sitting on seven hills in home i have looked all over the world tell me where it is a church sitting on seven hills there is only one city that i know of there is two cities that are north that has seven or more mountains in it cincinnati is one of them which is supposed to be a fiction story of cincinnati it's mother wolf we know what a wolf is but he has more than that in there but there is one church dominate there is not there is no one church dominates cincinnati so that's not the choice there is only one place in the world in the whole world that has a church setting on seven hills that dominate the entire world that church is what roman it's an anointing that hates elijah the anointing of jezebel it's an anointing that is against elijah it is an anointing that hates the message of the hour when you see a church begin to hate the message of the hour you better get out because the killer of the true christian is coming it's going to destroy your life destroy your relationship with christ and destroy all your christianity that you have all over the years and before you know it you're going back to pagan to hedonism you're going back to high heel you're going back too long now you're going back to wearing makeup you're going back to work to wearing pants all of that is because somebody has been killed amen they hate elijah it's the anointing of jezebel in revelation 18 the bible said how much she has glorified herself and lived deliciously amen so much torment and sorrow give her for she said in her heart i see a water which queen is it the queen of satan i am no widow and shall see no sorrow and saying hellas hell us that great city i'm going down to 16. that was clothed in fine lining so when you look at her naturally she has the appearance of righteousness but deny the power the word she has the appearance of good but deny the message and purple and scarlet and deck with gold and precious stone and pearl and the light of the candle shall shine no more at all in it and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all indeed for that merchant were the great men of the earth for by that water it's a sorcery anointing like it or not you're gonna find out one of these days that's an anointing that hate the message is sorcery that's sorcery where all nations deceived and it was found it was in hair was found the blood of the water she kills it and sent and of all that was slain upon the earth anybody clear so far amen come on in isaiah 47 verse 5 sit down silent and get thee into darkness or daughter of water babylon for that shall no more be called the lady of the water that's her name she's the queen of the earth and does say i shall be a lady forever so that does not know that did not lay these things to the heart neither did they remember the latter end of it therefore here now this that are given to pleasure do you know what pleasure means you remember sarah saying i'm not gonna give me having pleasure with my husband first timothy favre now she that is a widow indeed a desolate trusted in god and continues in supplication and prayer night and day but cedar lives in water is what ever here she thinks she's alive she's dead ever clear so let's continue so they are given to pleasure she's dead that dwelleth castles she doesn't care anything that says in the heart like lucifer i am and no one else beside me i shall not sit as a widow neither shall i know the loss of children remember in revelation they're going to kill her and her children but these two things shall come to the in one moment in a moment in one day the loss of your children the nomination will be destroyed and widowed they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of their what sorcery and for the great abundance of darn water when the spirit of the lord left soul which spirit came upon so which which spirit came upon so an evil spirit when the spirit of wisdom that come through the message leave what kind the spirit comes after for that have trusted in that wickedness da had said non-see me die water wisdom and die she also have wisdom remember from the tree she also have wisdom and knowledge just like the brother has wisdom and knowledge the two treason that wisdom and that knowledge he has provided me and that has said in the heart i am and no one else beside me a very proud woman everybody clear she is the type of all things vulgar full lovesome on the one hand on the other hand she is the type of all things cleaner let me start again i'm down here she is the top of our fixed vulgar full foul and awesome on the one hand i'm going back up on the other hand she is the top of all things clean and beautiful and holy as the resp receptacle of the spirit and the blessings of god i'm dropping down again on the one hand she's called the hole who is drunk with the wine of her fornication going back up on the other she is called the bride of christ going back down on one end she's called mystery babylon the abomination before god going back up on the other hand she's called the new jerusalem our water on one hand she is foul wicked and lewd that she is summerly cast into the lake of fire as the only fit place for her going back up on the other hand she is exalted to heaven sharing the very throne of god as the only place befitting such as a queen the two women ever clear so far blessed be the name of the lord take proverbs 2. that was the summary of the two women proverbs 2. if you dare you can say amen you need wisdom call wisdom your sister call understanding your king's woman to protect you from the evil woman to protect you from babylon amen accept the message of your day that's the bomb that are sent to protect you from the evil woman spiritually and naturally don't play with the message because that's your protection that's the blood that's crushed proverb 2 verse 1 my who still son

understanding amen yay if you seek after knowledge and lift up your voice for understanding if you seek her as what what she's a woman and search for her as for hidden treasure then shall you

to proverbs 3. amen let's go to verse 30 now happy is the man that finds who wisdom and demand that get who a person for her merchandise is better than the merchandise of silver and again thereof then find gold she is a woman more precious than rubies and all the things that you can desire i cannot or not to be compared with her that's why the bible said seek first the what the kingdom of god and everything else shall be added unto that's what solomon did solomon asked for wisdom then god added riches and other things automatically once you get wisdom everything else will be automatically added to you because the gentile way they seek after the things of the world and forsake wisdom if you want those things go to wisdom first then wisdom will automatically attract things for you ever clear hallelujah verse 16 life of days is in her right hand do you remember god telling solomon you didn't ask me those things when he asked wisdom he pulls those things automatically and in her left hand witches and water solomon because you ask me wisdom on my right hand i have riches on my left hand i have long days automatically you're getting them amen her ways are ways of pleasantness and

accomplish things in your life get that wisdom amen jump to proverbs chapter four now watch how solomon is going to go with a bad woman all over proverbs amen chapter 4 verse 7. you there wisdom is the principal thing therefore get water and with all your getting get water do everything you can like jacob and get the birthright everything you can if you need to fast fast if you need to pray all night pray on that until you get wisdom hallelujah exalt her and she shall promote you she shall bring you honor when you do embrace her she shall give your head the ornament of what you need grace

wisdom a crown of glory she shall do what when you get this wisdom at the end of your journey this wisdom will deliver you a crown of glory who is that wisdom that gives you a crown of glory hallelujah first knowing corinthians that they which run in the race run all but what one receives the price so run that she may want in other words if there is one person going into the rapture live your life like you are the only one that's going to the rapture don't worry about mom and dad hallelujah and every man that strives for the mastery is what temperate in water you're watching things correctly you cannot be an athlete to run and you eat junk food all the time if you want to win the race you must watch your diet you must watch what you drink you must keep your body correctly you must keep your body under subjection to the world because you want to win a prize hallelujah now they do it to obtain a water remember wisdom will deliver you one to obtain a corruptible crown but we and water so there is a corruptible crown and an incorruptable crown but solomon said the one that delivered you the crown of glory which is incorruptible his name is wisdom here i therefore someone not as uncertain so fighter not as the one beating the air he's not only running but he's what fighting it's a wall with the black dog and i keep under my what why paul have to worry about the body why because paul received the holy ghost the black dog was kicked already out from the inside but the black dog was still remaining in the body that's why paul was crying that when i want to do good evil is with me so when i run there is evil running with me so there is one person that i must control when i'm going into this race when i'm going into this fight i must control my body i keep under my body and bring it into what suggestion let by any means when i have preached to others i myself should should find i should be a castaway i don't want to lose it myself i don't want to just be a preacher i want to enter myself there festivity that therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ no man that worth enter himself with the affair of what that he may please him who has chosen him to be here you cannot be into the world and love the world and the things of the world when you try to win this race because it shows that the love of god is not even in you and if a man also strives for mastery yet it is he not crowned except he strives lawfully you must follow the word first peter 5 4 and when the chief shepherd who's the chief shepherd shall appear he shall receive a water a crown of water that said if not what incorruptible who gives you the crown of glory and solomon said wisdom at the end will give you the crown of glory in other words if you get connected to
