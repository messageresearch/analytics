wife sister Sarah thank you for the invitation I'm sorry it's a busy schedule I'm booked so we had to do whatever we can do to be here tonight so if you would God willing let's go straight to our scriptures thank you your pastor told me to approach this as a conference so I will attempt to stay in a conference mode and do it as a Sunday school so I would like for you to keep your Bible so we can travel through the scripture and talk about the holy spirit amen amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly tonight father we thank you for your grace for your love for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father you know the reason why you mve me from North Carolina all the way here father here are it Souls the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ and I am also human being just like them and we are very limited to our own ability that's why we ask Lord for the Holy Spirit to come the one who wrote the Bible through the prophets and may you be with Lord may you teach your children father may you open up the windows of heaven and bless us all together even those that are streaming in this V subject uh about the Holy Spirit in all aspects we thank you for everything and we thank you for brother Joel and his conation Lord and commit everything unto their hand in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen let's go to the Book of Luke Luke Luke chapter 16 Luke and verse 16 if you dare you can say Amen s amen amen amen few folks Luke 16 Luke verse 16 the Bible says the law and the prophets were until John it's very strange when we want to talk about the Holy Spirit to begin to speak about prophets but it's very important without the prophet we won't understand these things I'm going to read it again the law and the prophet were until John you might be seated okay I will try to sit and if I need to stand I will stand if you look at this scripture in the book of luk the Bible says that the law and the prophets were until John and usually we interpret this scripture wrong because the way people perceive the scripture is that when John the Baptist came the law was abolished which is true because the Bible says that Christ was the end of the law so when Jesus Christ died on the cross Jesus spoke and say it is finished in other words the penalty of the law was already paid by Christ but the Bible didn't stop at the law only the Bible say the law and the prophet and certain people people take it from here and they say that you know the prophet also are finished if the prophet are finished it means after Jesus Christ we cannot have any more prophets but that is not true what stop is the law but the prophet never stop so before I continue with the scripture Let's Travel a little bit in the book book of act so let's see if the prophet stop or the prophet continue let's go to act chapter 11 and we will come back to our scripture act chap 11 verse 27 ver6 if you thereare you can say amen amen I want to hear your amen amen there we go looks like somebody's still shy they told me it's a conference so we need to work together amen amen okay act chapter 20 uh chapter 11 verse 27 the Bible says and these days came what came prophets do you see that this is after the death of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit already came on the day of Pentecost but when the Holy Spirit came on the day of of Pentecost Prophet never ceased the Bible said that they were prophet in the book of act so when they say the law and the prophet were until John it doesn't mean that the prophet stop a John the Baptist because Jesus Christ himself was the prophet and Jesus Christ came after John the Baptist so the prophet never stops and according to the book of fact 11 ver 27 the Bible says and in these days came prophets if you notice it's Prophet plural it means that there were many prophets and the Bible say came Prophet from Jerusalem unto Antioch and there stood one of them Nam agabus so there is a prophet here with a name in the book of Act and the Bible say and signify by the spirit that there should be great D through all the world which came to pass in the day of Clodius Caesar let's go again in the book of act chapter 13 you need to keep your Bible because this is a conference act chap 13 Verse 1 if you thereare you can say Amen the Bible says now they were in the church that was at end certain prophets again plural and teachers as Barnabas and Simeon that was called nager and Lucius luus of serin and man which has been brought up with Herod the tetrarch and Saul amen amen amen so once again we can see in the book of fact that Prophet never ceased let's go again to the book of act chapter 15 act 15 verse 32 if you dare you can say Amen the Bible say and Judas and Silas being prophets prophets also themselves exhorted the brethren with many words and confirm them so I gave you three scriptures here showing that after the death the resurrection of Jesus Christ prophets still exist so let's go back again to the Book of Luke chap 16 verse 16 if you need more scripture you can see me after and I will give it to you Luke 16 verse 16 Luke now we can read together the law and the prophet were until John we understand here that the law seized by the office of a prophet never ceased are we clear together and since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man PR into it so my first scripture that I use today is speaking about the prophet all the way to John so prophets started from the Old Testament and for some reason there is a turning point in at John the Baptist but the prophet never sees with John the Baptist because John the Baptist introduced the great prophet amen which was the Lord Jesus Christ who was the god of the prophet and after Jesus Christ Prophet also continues so we have the law we have prophets we have John are we together let's go to the Book of Luke chapter 24 Luke so I'm not using the board but remember we have the law we have the prophet prophet and we have Christ and after Christ the prophet continues let's go to the Book of Luke chapter 24 Luke Luke 24 Luke we begin at verse 13 so you can get the background they told me that I'm going to take an hour and a half and then give you a break and then we come back again Luke 24 verse3 the Bible says this is about the disciple on the road to EMAs the Bible says and behold two of them went that same day to a village called Em which was from Jerusalem about three score furlongs and they talked together of the things of these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they commune together and reason Jesus himself Drew n and went with them so these Disciple This is after the death and the resurrection ction of Jesus Christ some people say that Jesus Christ rose from the dead and others say that no he didn't raise his disciples stole him and at this time Jesus didn't show up to his disciple yet and two of them were traveling together on the road to EMAs and they begin to talk about the event that transpired and as they were talking about those events which concern the Lord Jesus Christ the Bible said that Jesus himself joined them so if you want Jesus to join your conversation you need to talk about Jesus Christ when you talk at home about Jesus Christ when you talk to your friend about Jesus Christ this is one way to attract Jesus so the disciple were talking about Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ came and joined them but sadly they did not know that Jesus was with them I'm going to continue the Bible says but their eyes were Holden that they should know him in other words Christ was with them Christ was was talking to them Christ was walking with them Christ was traveling with them but they did not know that this was Jesus Christ so to cut a long story short Jesus begin to talk to them about himself and I'm going to go straight where he begin to talk to them about you if you can jop down with me to verse uh 25 the Bible says then he said unto them this is Jesus Christ oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophet have spoken and if you notice again it's about Prophet but the theme of this conference is the holy spirit in all aspects why are you talking about prophets stay with me and you will you will find out why we have to start by prophet and Jesus told them you fools slow of heart why you didn't believe the prophet in other words the prophet spoke about Jesus Christ and if you have believed the prophet you should have understood Jesus Jesus Christ so the best way to understand Jesus Christ you need a prophet are we together do you follow me praise be to the name of the Lord if we know it's a conference but if you want to say Amen say amen amen glory be to the name of the Lord amen the Bible says in verse 26 this is Jesus continuing he say ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory in other word what happened was already prophesied so why are you troubled about it in other word what happened to me is exactly the Fulfillment of the scripture why you didn't believe the prophet and the Bible says in the following verse and beginning at Moses remember when we read Luke chapter 16 we said the law and the prophet who the one who brought the law is Moses the Bible say Moses brought the law so when they say the law they're talking about Moses you must have Moses and the prophet and Moses himself was a prophet so the law and the prophet were until John and John also was a prophet so the law is a prophet the prophet themselves and John also also was a prophet and John introduced the Lord Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ was a prophet because Moses said the Lord your God will send a prophet back unto me and that Prophet was Jesus Christ so the law Prophet The Prophet prophet and John Prophet and Jesus Christ Prophet are we together glory to the name of the Lord amen now you begin to get really relaxed amen amen praise God the Bible says in verse 27 and beginning at Moses if you don't mind can you bring this board right here yes sir so we make sure where we stay together I Feel Home glory be to the name of the Lord amen this is a very vial subject so we need to go slowly amen amen I'm going to put it together so we don't lose track we talked about the Law plus the prophet everybody can see this you can all see this the law and the prophets until John and we found out that the prophet never stop never and the Bible says here that when Jesus begin to preach to those to open their eyes so that they can recognize him because the disciple were blinded Jesus begin to talk about Moses and Moses is the law are we together amen you want to take note that's fine amen amen the Bible says verse 27 and beginning at Moses why did Jesus start only by Moses why he didn't start by Abraham why he didn't start by Joseph why he didn't pick up Jacob but for some reason Jesus went straight and pick Moses and the Bible say he began by Moses and all the prophet prophets Moses again Plus all the prophet amen amen the Bible say and he be beginning at Moses and all the prophet he expanded unto them in other words he explained them he expanded unto them in all the scripture the things concerning himself so Jesus to explain himself he used the prophet are we together the law is a prophet the prophet were a prophet in order for Jesus to explain himself to his own disciple that were blinded Jesus never told them I am Jesus Christ Jesus went through the law he went through a prophet Called Moses are the prophet and begin to explain himself through the prophet in other word the prophet were not really talking about themselves the prophet were talking about Jesus Christ and I'm going to shock you a little bit how many knows that David was a prophet do you know that I see few hands so I have to to read it for you I don't want you to say brother Steven say when you leave this place you always say the Bible say are we together let's go to the book of act the book of act the book of Acts act act glory to God I believe it's chapter 1 act one if you dare you can say amen amen let me get the scripture where he speak about David David so you make sure you keep it in glory to God GL amen amen give me a minute and I'm going to find it I didn't prepare it but I'm going to find it mhm let's go to act two actually verse 30 you there let's go by verse 29 so you can get the background the Bible says men and Brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch who what's the name there David that he is both dead and buried and his sep is with us until this day therefore David being a prophet so David was a prophet can you say Amen David was a prophet and I told you that Prophet were talking about Jesus Christ but the reason why I picked David is to show you another another ECT of a prophet the Bible say in the book of Psalm that David one day was crying and David said my God my God why has thou forsaken and David being a prophet was crying under the anointing of God but we found out that later when the god came to David if you go to David there was no scripture that shows that David was crucified David was speaking about Jesus Christ and if you stood by David you would have thought that David was talking about himself but he was not really talking about himself he was actually talking about what Jesus would do at the cross because when Jesus was crucified repeated the word of David and he said my God my God why has Thou forsaken me in other word Prophet not only did they spoke about Christ not only did they prophesy about Christ but they were acting as Jesus Christ they behave like God are we together the law and the prophet went until John the law Moses a prophet Prophet Prophet Propet John Prophet and Jesus to explain the scripture he started by a prophet Moses all the way to Prophet to explain about himself now let's go to the book of Hebrew chapter one if you thereare you can say amen amen amen Hebrew 1 verse one Hebrew chapter 1 verse one I'm taking this as a Sunday school According to Hebrew 1 verse one the Bible say God who at time in other word God in Me In many times in several time the Bible say God who at time and in diverse manners spake in past unto the father by the prophets by the prophets so everything I just spoke to you is summarized here God in the old time when he want to talk to the father to the children of Israel he always used a prophet are we together together verse two God has in these last days spoken unto us by his son in other word Paul is saying here that in the Old Testament God was talking to us through prophets but in these last days God spoke to us through his his own son which was the Lord who was the Lord Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ himself was a prophet but why are you talking about Prophet our theme is about the Holy Spirit in all aspect when God created man in the Garden of Eden the bible say that God created man in his own image and in his own likeness and if you go back in Genesis one God never use a prophet to talk to his children God spoke to his children directly how many knows that few hands left let's go to the Bible let's go to Genesis I want to make sure everybody is on the same page don't take my word take the Holy Scripture amen let's go to Genesis chapter one verse [Music] 20 26 the Bible says this and God say let us make man in our image after our likeness and let let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the foul of the earth and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them right here God have not spoken to his children yet he created them and he spoke to them and he's blessing them and the Bible say God blessed them and God say unto them now God is talking to them do you see a prophet here God at the beginning spoke to his children lip to ear directly without a prophet and the Bible say he say be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea over the foul of the earth and over every living things that moveth upon the Earth and God said behold I have given you so what I'm showing here is God is talking to his children directly go to Genesis 2 verse S the Bible says and the Lord God for Men Out of the Dust of the ground the man of Genesis one God form him as a spirit but in Genesis 2 God created the body that will receive the spirit that's why when you die your body goes to the Grave Spirit return back to God are we together and the Bible say and the Lord God form Men Out of the Dust of the ground and breathe into his nostril the Breath of Life and Man became a living Soul drop to verse 15 the Bible says and the Lord God took the man and and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it and the Lord commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden that may itat freely to eat that may freely eat if you notice here God even when he put men in this body God spoke to men directly there was never a prophet there let's go to uh Genesis chapter 3 I'm establishing something there let's go to verse seven if you dare you can say amen amen the Bible says after the fall after Adam and Eve when they ate the fruit their eyes were open the Bible says and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sued fig leaves together and made thems apron and they heard the voice of the Lord God working let me ask you a question can your voice work I'm asking you a question but the bible say that the voice was working in other word God and His Voice are one God was walking and his voice was walking so God and His Voice are one are we together sometime if it's I'm I'm looking at brother Joe here if brother Joe is coming there and I didn't see him yet and I hear his voice and maybe he's talking and I know him very well I will tell you that brother Joe is coming but what I heard is not really the man Joe but I heard his voice but because the voice and the man are one the Bible say the voice of God was walking in word God was walking are we together glory to God the Bible say and they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden of in the garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife HIDs from the presence so The Voice have a presence amen and he said from the presence of the Lord God Among the Trees of the garden and the Lord God called unto Adam and say unto him where are thou God didn't tell a prophet to call Adam God himself called Adam what I'm trying to establish here is from the beginning God spoke to men directly God created man so he can talk to man directly but we found out that the Bible says in the book of Hebrew that God was speaking to the father through the prophet so something changed somehow instead of God talking directly to his children now God establish a new order and according to the New Order God begin to talk to men through prophets together very much we see I see a lot of sisters here so let me make sure you are also included to what we are talking let's continue our scripture because here they call Adam and Adam will answer but I will show you that God also talk to his daughter so you can be also comfortable are we together the Bible says in verse uh uh 11 Adam is answering and he said or God is talking actually who T thee that thou are naked has thou eaten of the tree whereof I command the that th shall not eat and the man say the woman whom th Gest to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat and the Lord God say unto the woman if you notice God didn't tell ad to tell Eve God direct turn directly to Eve so God from the beginning talk to men and women directly are we together this is what I'm trying to establish but we see here that for some reason God is talking through the prophet are we together now let's go to the book of Peter glory to God second Peter verse [Music] one glory to God the holy spirit in all aspects brother Steven it's the holy spirit in all aspect are you talking about Prophet what does Prophet have to do with the holy spirit amen I was expecting you to start about telling us about what is the holy spirit we will get there by the grace of God but let's go first to second Peter verse one if you dare you at chapter one let's go to verse 20 remember the law and the prophet until John and when Jesus be wanted to explain about himself he Begin by a prophet Moses and all the prophet to explain himself who was a prophet are we together now what does the prophet have to do with the Holy Ghost second Peter chapter 1 verse 20 the Bible says this knowing this first Peter want you to know this first before you start anything you need to know this first in other words you need to begin here what do we what are we supposed to know first knowing this first in other words begin here that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation in other word no one can just take this Bible and just begin to explain it any way they want why why why why is the Bible so sacred that before you interpret it you need to know this first what is the principle that Peter want us to know before you can interpret the Bible verse 21 the Bible say for the prophecy came not in all time remember in the old time God was talking through prophet those Prophecy of the old time the bible say that for the prophecy came not in the old time by the will of man in other word when Moses spoke it was not the will of Moses when David spoke it was not the will of David when the prophet spoke it was not the will of the Prophet it was the will of God they were expressing God that's why God could refer to them in other word it was God in the prophet are we together are we together the Bible say in verse 21 for the prophecy came not in the old time by the will of man but holy man of God those holy men of God were prophets in other word prophets holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost now you begin to understand before I can talk about the Holy Ghost I need to talk about the prophet all the prophets were speaking by the Holy Ghost that's why why Jesus have to refer to them because he was not Prophet speaking he was not human being speaking he was the Holy Ghost in the prophet that were talking that's the reason why what the prophet spoke happened because he was not men talking he was God the Holy Spirit talking through the prophet are we together but brother Steven you have just established that in the Garden of Eden God was talking to men and to women directly so what change that the Holy Ghost now instead of talking to the children of God directly now the Holy Ghost have to use prophet in order talk to the children of what happened why let's go to the Book of Exodus ex God after the fall begin to walk with Prophet Exodus chapter 20 and when we begin to walk with the prophet God picked up a nation a nation called Israel are we together and then when God brought Israel God told Moses go to Egypt and go get my people God called them my people and bring them together so that they can worship me amen remember Jesus started by Moses so Moses went and pick up people from Egypt people that were under slavery people that were working for the devil people that were smoking people that were drinking people that were working for the devil and Moses went and took them from the slavery of the devil and brought them out so that the people can begin to serve the Lord and when God rescue those people or redeemed those people God told Israel bring Israel to me I want to talk to Israel face to face God wanted to start what what fell in Eden because in Eden God was talking to man and to women directly and then men corrupt themselves God have to destroy Men by the flood and then God started by a man called Abraham and from Abraham Isaac from Isaac Jacob from Jacob came all the tribes and then they created the nation of Israel so now God pick up a specific nation and when he brought that Nation God say I'm want to start another Eden here where I can talk to a people directly to them this is where we are in Exodus chapter 20 what happened when God offer to Israel to talk to them directly like Adam and Eve God told them sanctify yourself cleanse yourself come to me let meet at the mountain of s on the mountain of Horeb Horeb and S is the same Mountain it's just different name let's meet together so I can talk to you this is where we are we're talking about the Holy Spirit in all aspects and remember the Holy Spirit was working through the prophet are we together let's go to Exodus 20 verse 18 if you dare you can can say amen amen the Bible says and all the people saw the thundering and the Lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and when the people stow it they remove and stood far off God told them approach me and when God came down were thundering they were smoking they were all kind of demonstration when the people saw the demonstration of God they say no no no no we need to back up a little bit somebody can get killed here God who invited them to approach now men begin to go backwards because of the demonstration that happened on more let's continue continue verse 19 and they the people said to Moses remember Jesus began by Moses and and they say to Moses speak th unto with us and we will hear but let not God speak with us L we die God told them come to me and I'm going to talk to you how can God kill you when he want to talk to you but when God come down and display his power Israel backed off and say Moses you talk to us in other word you go to God and talk to God and take the message from God and bring us the message and we will hear from this because if we hear from God we will die but in the beginning Adam talked to God in the beginning if talk to God even Moses himself talk to God and Moses never died but when God took that opportunity and wanted to bring it to everybody human being rejected they say no no no no no no if we talk to God we will die you go talk to God bring us the message and we will hear and we will talk to you and you will take our message back to now man himself have introduced another office the office of a prophet that's why the Bible say God in s in the old time he was speaking to us through the prophet at the beginning God wanted to talk to you God wanted to talk to you God wanted to come down and talk to you my sister with that brother Jo God wanted to talk to you my sister without a pastor God want to talk to you my sister without a pastor God want to talk to you my brother without a pastor God want to talk to you Mama without a pastor God want to talk to you Church Li to here without a pastor God want to talk to you a work God want to talk to you in school God want to talk to you in your bedroom God want to talk to you in your bathroom God want to talk to you when you drive in your car he want to talk to you directly without a prophet but man introduce an office the office of a prophet Propet are we together amen that's why Prophet started before and even after the death of Jesus Christ Prophet continues are we together but don't stop there let's continue with our background let's go now to the book of Deuteronomy chapter 18 so we saw what happened in Horeb and according Tob man came down God came down remember the mountain is called Horeb it's another name for the mountain of s if you have a difficulty with that you see me after service I'll give you a scripture that shows that Horeb and S is the same thing so we got the mountain of s which we Call HB and remember what happened in Horeb here is that man refus to talk to God man desired that God talk to him through a prophet are we together let's go to Deuteronomy chapter 18 verse 15 if you dare you can say amen amen we're talking about the Holy Spirit in all aspect just hang tight and we're going to drop down if you thereare you can say Amen amen verse 15 the Bible say the Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a what a prophet from the midst of thee of th Breen like unto me unto him ye shall hearken in other word this decision was so strong until God himself was conditioned to come as a prophet in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ that's why Jesus was a prophet because God has to follow his own law are we together now verse 16 says God is telling them that I'm going to send you a prophet which was the Lord Jesus Christ like unto me why are you sending them why God do you want to come as a prophet God is explaining this in verse 16 he says according to all that that desirest of the Lord th God did you see that God is saying I answered your prayer and according to your prayer I'm going to send a big prophet and the big Prophet is myself and I'm coming according to what happened in hor what happened in horri you ask me whenever I want to talk to you I need to send you a prophet and because of that even if myself God I want to talk to you I'm going to come as a prophet because this is what you desire are we together very the Bible says that saying that let me not hear hear again the voice of the Lord my God let neither let me see this great fire anymore that I die not God is reminding them do you remember what you told me you don't want to see my demonstration you don't want to talk to me you want to hear me through a prophet verse 17 and the Lord say unto me they have well spoken that which they have spoken I will raise them a prophet from among their Brethren like unto thee and I will put my word in the in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him so now if God God want to talk to people he need to use a prophet so now the order have changed again all the congregation are a little beit secluded from God and it seems like the one who talk to God is only a prophet so if you want to hear from God you need to go talk to the prophet because remember the Holy Ghost was talking through the prophet are we together if no Prophet God is silence you must have a prophet in other words the prophet now break the Silence of God so whenever you see a prophet you just get ready because God say that's the reason why when Prophet were appearing they always say that serve the Lord in other word it's not me speaking it is God talking now brother Steven what do the prophet have to do with the Holy Ghost now let's L down I have to build this background let's go to the book of numbers so if you want to talk to God you must be a special somebody somebody who's born prophet and everybody feel like you know what I'm not a prophet I cannot talk to God oh the prophet are the only one to whom the Holy Spirit goes to the pastor is the only one God can talk to if I want to hear from God I need see I need to talk to the pastor that's the way we behave today what is the Holy Ghost number chapter uh 11 if you dare you can say amen amen number let's go to verse 10 vers thank you Jesus if you there you can say Amen number 11 verse 10 the Bible says then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families every man in the door of his T remember Jesus began by Moses remember Jesus began by Moses we are with Moses the law of prophets started by Moses right and Jesus began by Moses and the anger of the Lord was kinger greatly Moses also was displeased and Moses say unto the Lord wherefore has th Afflicted that Serv wherefore have I not found favor in that sight that that laid the burden of all these people upon me have I conceive all these people have I begotten them that that should say unto me carry them inom as a nursing father beareth the sucking child unto the land which th swearest unto their father in other word the burden of work the burden of work was so heavy upon Moses everybody Moses Moses if somebody have a problem they take their cell phone and call Moses Moses pray for my child mes I have a test tomorrow Moses I have a headache Moses I'm suffering from stomach trouble Moses I didn't sleep tonight Moses husband is angry with me Moses my my wife doesn't listen to me and Moses got tired too much burden and Moses turned unto God he said God why did you give me this big job you the one that told me to go get these people these are not my children why did you give me such a big burden like this why didn't you take care of themselves God look at Moses he say I understand you one man handling everybody and God is only speaking to one man and God told Moses something follow me carefully sir job to verse 16 says and God say and the Lord say unto Moses GA unto me 70 men of the Elder of Israel were these people Prophet no no no God say Moses you tired the work is heavy get me 70 people of the elders bring them to me why what are you trying to do follow me [Music] carefully whom that knowest to be the Elder of the people officer over them and bring them onto the Tabernacle of the congregation that they may stand with thee and I the Lord will come down and talk with and I will take off thy Spirit which is upon thee and I will put it upon them remember Jesus begin to talk from Moses so the first person that God took a spirit from him and divide the spirit and put it in other people so that other people can begin to behave like Moses are we together it started by Moses so what happened on the day of Pentecost that the Spirit came down and divide himself into 120 people he didn't start over there there is a shadow there is a prefigure in the Old Testament it started by Moses god take a spirit that was on Moses but remember the Bible say Moses was a prophet and remember the Bible say the prophet were talking by the Holy Ghost so the spirit that was on Moses was the Holy Spirit In other word without the Holy Spirit God cannot talk to you directly so the Holy Spirit bring God to you the Holy Spirit bring a closeness between you and God until at a certain time will get confused whether it is you talking or it is God the Holy Spirit talking in you are we together are we together God say you know what bring me 70 people I'm going to take that Spirit from your spirit from you and divided the spirit the anointing from you the holy spirit that was working on you and I'm going to put on other people so that now all cell phone calls all texting don't go to you they can go to 70 people and on the day of Pentecost he went through 120 are we together very much are you together so that you cannot be the only agent everybody else can get it together we on verse 17 and God say I will put it upon them and they shall bear the burden of the people that th bearest not thyself alone job to verse 24 now follow me carefully we're getting into our material and Moses went out and told the people the word of the Lord and gather the 70 men of the Elder of the people and and set them round about the Tabernacle and the Lord came down in the cloud and spake unto him and took off the spirit th was on him upon him and gave it unto 70 elders and he came to pass follow me when the spirit rested upon them they prophesy and did not cease remember these were not Prophet but when the spirit of Prophecy Came Upon them they begin to behave like prophets are we together are we together let's continue verse 26 verse but there remain two of them so when Moses call 70 people not everybody came do you follow me only 68 people came and then two other were left in the camp so you who are here can receive the Holy Ghost and those that are streaming through my streaming can also receive the Holy Ghost without being here exactly right can you say amen amen amen yes sir the Bible say two of them remain in the camp and the name of one was elad and the name of the Other M and the spirit rested upon them so even though they were not there the Holy Ghost follow them and drop upon them are you following me and the spirit rested upon them and they were of them that were written remember there was a list list of name the I'm reading the Bible we are reading the same thing so if your name is written among the 70 even if you are not in church do you follow me do you follow me when God divide the division is 70 so those who are in church God give them 68 and they other two portion the Holy Spirit Chas them like a on until he reached them and he fill them so the Holy Ghost follow names oh Lord are we together are we together are we together do you know why I say that do you know why I say that let's put a pause here because I have to follow the spirit of the Lord let's go to Revelation apocalyps Oh Glory to God GL let's go to Revelation chapter 13 apocalypse hallelujah amen glory to God GL you there you there amen the Bible is talking about the mark of the beast there are people who will receive the mark of the beast and there are people who will receive the Holy Ghost okay now the Bible is giving a description of who will receive the mark of the beast are we together Revelation 1 verse 8 if you thereare you can say amen I want you to read with me please the Bible say and all that dwell upon the Earth how many here dwell on the earth I do dwell on the earth if you here tonight you are dwelling on Earth if you here tonight you dwelling on Earth the Bible say everybody that dwell on Earth will worship the beast but I'm not going to worship the Beast why I'm not going to worship Satan why the Bible say all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him the Beast whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the land slain from the foundation of the world before the foundation of the word God has a book and that book has names and if your name is in that book you are not going to worship the devil and coming back to where we were before the Holy Ghost come to you your name must be written we just saw it in the Old Testament and everybody who got their name written amen whether you were there or you were not there as long as your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life just know that you have a portion of the Holy Ghost you have a portion of God you have a portion of the spirit of God will come and dwell with you so that you can be one with God are we together let's go back now to number I just want to establish that I'm going to establish as much as I can when your pastor will pick up he can continue we were on verse 26 verse 26 verse 76 and we're going to take a break let me drop this and we take a break number 26 number 11: 26 the Bible say but there remain two of the men in the camp the name of one was elad and the name of the other midad and the spirit rested upon them and they were of them that were written everybody saw that now but went not out onto the Tabernacle and they prophesy in the camp and there ran a young man and told Moses and say El and M do prophesy in the camp in other words somebody saw two men in the camp prophesy and he run to Moses said Moses Moses Moses we know that they only Prophet is you you are the only one that speak to God through us but we see two men over there that are prophesying in the camp verse [Music] 28 and Joshua the son of n the servant of Moses one of his young men answer and say my Lord uh my Lord Moses forbid them so when they report came Joshua who was like a body guard to Moses turn around he said Moses let's stop these people you the only one who need to speak why are they talking over there are we together job to verse 29 follow me carefully because I'm going to stop here and Moses say unto them this for my sake in other way are you jealous because of me God is using other people Joshua what is your problem what is your problem what problem so a pastor should be happy when a young brother or a young sister is coming and say Pastor the Lord spoke to me last a mother coming to a pastor and say the Lord spoke to me Father coming and say the Lord spoke to me Moses say what's wrong with you Joshua because we know the order the order is God only speak to prophets these are not prophets and they are and they are acting like you they are prophesying like you we need to stop them say Joshua are you jealous remember Jesus Begin by Moses are we together let's continue and then we stop this verse and Moses say unto him envious that for my sake follow me carefully he say would God remember he was only 70 people but listen to Moses he said would God that 70 is that what the Bible says Ah that's the way I catch if you're listening to me would God that how many people how many people all the people God that all the Lord's water in other word everybody the entire congregation Moses is telling Joshua are you of me would God that all the Lord's people were our [Music] wish is that the entire Congregation of is be Prophet Propet yes sir he said would God that all the Lord's people were prophet and that the Lord will put his Spirit upon them and let me close with this the first person who had the spirit of the Lord working on him and God came and took that Spirit follow me carefully and God selected 70 people and then God dropped the spirit upon 70 people because their name were written but when Moses came Moses didn't stop at 70 Moses extended from 70 to an unlimited number what are you trying to say in other word Moses is telling Israel that the promise is not only unto me Moses it is not only unto the 70 but the promise is unto many as the Lord your God will call and on the day of P God came down in a selected group of 120 people and he baptized only 120 people but one day when Peter was preached and he said repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit and Peter as Moses extended the promise he said for the promise is not is unto you you who are listening me and as many as the Lord your God will call in other words the promise of the holy spirit is not only unto the 12 it's not only unto the Jews the promise of the holy spirit is also for you you need to be baptized with the Holy Spirit you need to receive the portion of the Holy Ghost because before the foundation of the world God put your name in the L book of and God want you to receive the Holy Spirit God richly bless let's stop here glory to God

Lord send your power just and [Music] B amen amen amen everybody happy praise God Amen can you hear me okay amen amen amen amen just a recab the law and the prophet all the way onto John the law is Moses who was a prophet and then we got all the prophets we got John the Baptist who was also a prophet and then he introduced Jesus Christ the prophet because he was the prophet of the prophet and Jesus when he begin to talk he started by Moses all the way through the prophet about the things that concern himself and we found out that this Prophet God in the old time in time was speaking through the father through the prophet and in the last day he spoke through Jesus Christ and the prophet did not seize the office continue but the desire of God always has been that God want to speak to his children directly God talking to the pastor God talking to the Deacon God talking to the pastor's wife talking to the father to the mother to the older to the younger God want to speak to everybody but the office still remain and for those who take note in Ephesians 4 verse 11 and 12 the Bible gives the offices the Bible says that he gave unto some Apostle some Prophet so the office of a prophet is still valid and the second scripture it's in 1 Corinthians 12 verse 28 if you go home and you read those scripture you will see that the office of a prophet is also established in the New Testament the office is still there Moses is still there the disciple are still there but God want to fill more people you know that Mary the mother of Jesus Christ was among the 120 do you know that do you know that so the Holy Spirit fell on men and women didn't only fall on the 12 apostles he fell upon 120 people so God even though there is a Moses God can drop the spirit upon 70 people and not only 70 people but the true desire of God that was expressed through Moses is that the entire Israel become prophet and God can drop his Spirit upon them because to begin with INB God called all Israel talk to them face to face it was Israel that backed off but God still desired to talk to his children as parent we want to talk to our children God also have his own children and God want to talk to his children and the only way you can talk to him adequately to be with him you need to have the same spirit so when God speak you also speak how many here knows what a magnet is if you remember a magnet if you take a magnet and you chip it and you take the little piece of a magnet and you put it somewhere and you take the big magnet for those who who played with that if you move the magnet like this you will see that the magnet has a power of Attraction and you will notice the little magnet will begin to move according to the direction of the big magnet so that's the same way God operates so God take a portion of his spirit and he put in new so when God move you move if God goes to the right you go to the right God speak you speak if God is quiet you quiet how do you know God is speaking because the same thing that is in God is in me the difference is only in a portion are we together now we understand that the desire of God expressed through Moses is that God want everybody to have his spirit amen now let's go to Isaiah 44 is you can get your Bible Isaiah 44 Isaiah 44 verse one if you there you can say Amen pages are still turning Isaiah 44 verse one the Bible says yet now hear oh Jacob my servant and isra whom I have chosen there is a choosing going on just like God chose the 70 the Bible says in verse two th sayith the Lord that made thee and formed thee from the womb God is talking to you the god that form you in the womb of your mother is talking to you what is God talking to the bible say that sa the Lord that made thee in other words the god that created you and formed thee from the womb which will help thee same God that create you the same God that formed you the same God that watch over your pregnancy the same God that will help you if you going through trouble God will not forsake you he was with you before the foundation of the world and God was with you in your mother's and God is telling you tonight he will help you he has not stopped when you came out from your mother's God didn't stop God will go with you all the way the Bible says he will help you fear not oh Jacob my servant oh whom I have chosen follow me carefully verse three for I will pour out I will pour water upon him that is thirsty God is saying here he will pour water upon somebody who thirsty so if you don't thirst for it is God going to give it to you so to have that water you must yearn for it you must desire for it you must test for it because there is a law when there is a deep David said it that is calling there got to be a deep to respond if you have a thirst of water it's already telling you that water is somewhere that's the reason why you tting in your body is insufficient become low and the Deep over there calling to another water and God is saying that if you thirsty he will pour a water upon you how many people tonight want God to pour a water upon you if you want God to pour a water upon you you must thirst for God you must yearn for God you must desire God you must have a painful desire that God I want you in my life and there is a promise in your Bible that if you thirst for me I will p a water upon you are we together the Bible says verse three for I not somebody else not a pastor it is God himself I will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground follow me carefully I will pour my spirit upon th seed and my blessing upon The Offspring so Isaiah already begin to prophesy that God is looking for a time that he will pour His Spirit upon his seed upon his children God don't want his children to be empty God don't want you to come to church empty God don't want you to come to church to warm pews God don't want you to come to church to have religion God want you to have his spirit so that when God is talking something in you is rejoicing something in you is Happy God don't want you to come to church and you sad want you to come to church and you fell asleep when they're talking about him God don't want you to come to church and you sitting like you don't feel like being in church God don't want you to come to church and you put your hand like this something is going on God want you to come to church when they begin to talk about him your heart is already rejoicing you can't help to say Amen you can't help to say praise the Lord you can't help to say that is the truth because something in you is burning because there is a promise that God want to pour His Spirit up are we clear now where does the Holy Ghost go because now we we understand the desire of God God want to talk to you directly without anybody he want to tell you he he want to tell you don't wake up in the morning and go to the right he want to tell you when you wake up do not take uh I inan the highway use a different road because there is an accident you want a god that is living not a god of History not a god of the pastors only only the pastor tell you God Tau me God told no you must have a testimony that God also talked to me that I was reading the the Bible and a voice spoke to me I was going this way and something told me go check my child and you go you check the child and you find something that's the God we want are we together exactly but if that God comes if God pour the spirit where does the spirit go are we together mhm let's go to the book of Deuteronomy I chapter 10 you know God as you going through the scripture told Israel he started that with Abraham when God call Abraham God separate Abraham you know the story very well it's in Genesis 12 God say Abraham come out from your people come out for your king come out from your family let's go to a land that I will show you when Abraham moved if you look at Abraham and you look at everybody else they look alike you cannot tell who God is talking to and who God is not talking to in other word Abraham looked like everybody he dressed like everybody you cannot tell that this is the one God is talking to and this one is the one God is not talking so when God separate Abraham Abraham begin to form his own family with his servant and when God looked at Abraham he say Abraham I must make some distinction between you and everybody else so that if they want to know who is in your house who belong to your Camp who belong to your country who belong to your tribe if they check that son only Abraham family only Abraham servant only Abraham people have the mark of Distinction everybody else doesn't have if you don't have it it means you don't live in the house of Abraham because it's a mark of Distinction maybe several of you here have American passport if you go somewhere they told you who are you you will say I'm an American what shows that you're an American you say oh because I speak English there are people who speak English in South America there are people who speak English in Canada there are people who speak English in Europe I mean England started with English there are people who speak English in Africa what shows that because you speak English you an American you must carry a passport that shows that you in American when you bring your passport out we can tell that you're an American because to be a true American you must have an American passport are we together if you pull your blood you say blood is an American everybody's blood can be American but there is a certain distinction there is a certain identity that if you show that identity everybody at the airport will open the gate and say welcome to America because you carry the identity of America and God told Abraham I'm going to give you an identity and that identity when you it means that person and me God we are in a covenant and that's Mark was called circumcision are we together yes sir and God told Abraham every male that is in your uh in your under your jurisdiction circumcised them if somebody's not circumcised kill him so if you get to Abraham temp everybody is circumcised but if you notice circumcision is not a public sign it is a sign that is private it is a sign that is covered it is a son that is protected only the one who has knows the secret between him and God that's the reason why when Israel fight with if they don't they have not remembered that yet they will fight with you as normal man but if ever during the fight a man of Israel remember that within my clothing I carry a Mark that is different then the one who is fighting against the battle change is no longer his battle he become the Battle of God God enter into the battle and change the battle that's the reason why when David was talking to Goliath David remember something David when he read go talking he said wait a minute who is this uncircumcised didn't take the the clothing of gol verify was ccum but because gol was coming from a different Nation say who is this when David spoke that his height was no longer a problem his muscle was no longer a problem his strength was no longer a problem the god of Israel enter into the seene and took a stone and brought Goliath down why because of a mark of Distinction a mark of circumcision so everyone who is in the house of Israel must be circumcised if you are not circumcised they kill you now that concept of circumcision remove will leave the Jewish people because the world become evangelized so we accepting God through the Jewish Channel we also took the sign of circum now everybody is circumcised if you have a male child and he's born in a hospital usually before he leave the hospital they already circumcised but even though they circumcise you are you a Jew you're not a Jew so now the mark now is no longer of a value back in the day he was a but now everybody is circumcised so who's Jew who's not Jew but what was the purpose of that Mark and what was the mystery behind circumcision circumcision means a man is born with excess flesh then he needed so God told Abraham go ahead and cut that excess and remove it so there is a part of you that you were carrying that was not supposed to stay with you and through circumcision that part is removed and once it's removed you and God become friend so what is that Mark for we are women so brother Steven ision was only for men what about so we were put out let's go to theonomy chapter 10 if you dare you can say amen amen glory to God Deuteronomy 10 verse2 amen amen and now yeah Lord I hear so many amen now so the ice is broken now we are fine uh Deuteronomy 10:2 now Israel what do the Lord uh verse uh Deuteronomy 10:12 and now Israel is what do the Lord thy God require of [Music] thee but to fear the lord th God to walk in all his ways and to love him and to serve the Lord th God with all thy heart and with all th soul to keep the Commandment of the Lord statute which are commanded this day for th good behold the Heaven and the heaven of Heavens is the Lord th God and the Earth also with all therein is only the Lord has a delight in their fathers to love them and he chose their seed after them even you above all people as it is this day this is self-explanatory God is telling you he wants you to love him follow the Commandment do what he want everybody knows this because when we children we are taught this by our parents but where are we going with this circumcision J to verse 16 God says circumcise therefore the for skin of your heart and be no more stiff neck I thought circumcision was somewhere for men and women were not circumstan now God in Deuteronomy speak to Israel Israel doesn't listen God will rescue Israel Israel will go back to bad things God will send a prophet rescue Israel Israel does something wrong when God look he say what is wrong with these people because it looks like since the fall men have difficulty keeping the Commandment of God he will start good then later on he fall he will start good and later on he fall so when God begin to examine the situation God say wait a minute the Surplus the excess of the flesh that I told Abraham was only a picture the true problem is not that because we begin to see Jews even though they circumcised but they do bad stuff so God say hey so now you begin to play with circumcision what I gave Abraham was only a a shadow I was only trying to tell him something but the true problem is not really in your flesh you can cut a part of your flesh you can lose an arm and you still bad lose a finger and you still bad you can get in an accident and when you come out from the accident and people think okay after the accident he's going to change he's still bad when we had Co everybody run to church because of Co when vaccine and Co came and then everybody begin to feel better everybody went back drinking and doing everything so God look he said the problem is not really the flesh the problem is in the heart and God say Israel I want you to be circumcised Not In the Flesh in the heart but when it comes to the heart not only men have heart women have heart the circumcision is not only to men now the circumcision is both to men and to women but brother Steven circumcision is taking somebody and cutting the flesh now God is saying let's go in the heart and circumcise the heart so everybody need to have a heart surgery so we need to go to the cardiologist so that everybody will have an open heart cut and then when you cut a portion of your heart you say okay now I'm a Christian there are people who had a heart surgery and they still bad there are people who have heart transplant and they still bad so it is not a physical heart God is talking about something else the heart in the scripture speak about the soul it is the soul of man in other words your soul is where the problem is because when you die your heart goes in the grave and your heart will rot so the problem is not the organ of the heart but it's the man that Liv in the heart you is in your heart when you do something wrong you somebody in your heart is not when you lie to somebody even though they ask you tell the truth say I didn't do it but somebody there knows it that's the problem that's the you that cause problem that's the problem that's the man that is there the woman that is there that woman need the circumcision not the woman that I see here but the Invisible Woman The Invisible Man that is inside the man is the one that need the circumcision that is what God is saying catch your heart go ahead and circumcise the heart if God circumcise the heart to remove something bad it means that the heart of a man have a problem why the heart I thought I have a good heart let's go to Mark chapter 7 glory to God where I will stop your pastor will pick up amen Mark chapter 7 Mark if you dare you can say Amen Mark 7 verse 14 amen amen this is Jesus this is the Bible says and when he had called all the people unto him he said unto them hearken unto me every one of you and understand God call people when the people came God say all of you pay attention to what I'm going to say so we to we also here we need to pay attention to what Jesus is saying because Jesus is God he is the big Prophet we want to hear what God want to talk verse 15 there is nothing from without a man that entering into him can defile him Jesus is saying the mcdonal that you eat the wend this that you eat the pizza that you eat you can eat it all you want if you eat pizza he won't make you a bad man he won't make you a bad woman if it's a wrong Pizza you can have sickness but it won't make you a bad woman it is not because you eat hamburger then you became bad so Jesus is saying it is not what is entering in that make you bad are we together oh God I have to go like this so this will penetrate you and when God comes God can enter into you easily without any more problem are we together very much he says there is nothing from without amen entering in him can defile him but the think which come out of oh let me ask you a question you all sitting here did anybody vomit here did you anybody vomit yesterday so what did come out of you Sala so if you spit you become bad so what is really coming out of you usually it's word right if you say brother uh Jo you a good man brother say thank you very much brother St if I cast which I won't do it then brother Joe will say that's a bad man and usually we say that's a sinner so we recognize Sinners based on what is coming out of so what come out of a man it many it is not food food goes differently but what is coming out of man is something continue the scripture verse 16 Jesus is saying what enter into you don't defy you never but what makes you dirty bad before God is what is coming from so there is something in me that produce something and when I produce it I become filthy before God we need to know where is that generator where is the engine where is that manufacturer that manufactur your bad stuff and when those bad stuff come from you it makes you bad because if you know the manfacturer then you can go there to fix it are we together if you don't know if your car is broken and the mechanic doesn't know what is wrong with the car when you go to the dealer and they need to take a machine and hook it you know you've been to the dealer and the Machine will tell them it's something there and then they know what is the problem so let's also hook our spiritual machine from the dealer toight and let's see what is that machine that manufacture that is making you bad verse 16 the Bible says if any man have ears to hear Let Him hear so some people have ears but they don't hear let's leave it alone okay verse 17 and when he was entered into the house from the people his disciple asked him concerning the parable so Jesus told everybody and he left them so when he went in private the disciples say come on Jesus you speaking in Parable we didn't understand what you mean you say what enter into us don't make us bad what is coming out so what do you mean h okay those are I mean people from outside we are your body explain us we want to understand now Jesus will explain to us what he spoke the Bible says in verse 18 and he say unto them are ye so without understanding in other way you also don't understand just like them do ye not perceive that whatsoever thing from without enter into a man he cannot defile him in other word don't you understand that what you eat don't make you bad he says because he entered not into his heart so when you take a hamburger and you eat your hamburger don't go in your heart your hamburger goes in your stomach so Jesus is saying what you eat goes in the stomach so what you eat doesn't affect your problem remember circumcision must be in the heart now we together are we together he says whatever you eat doesn't go into the heart but into the belly goth into the drought purging all meat in other words it goes into the bathroom and verse 20 and he say thou which cometh out of the man that defile the man what comes out of you this is what makes you bad verse 20 we there and he said thou which cometh out of a man that def the man verse 21 for from within out of the heart everybody clear of man proceed evil thoughts bad thought don't come from your belly it's coming from your heart I'm reading to you the Bible don't say brother St adulteries come from where the heart that's why Jesus say whoever look on a woman you know the scripture and last after her has committed adultery where before somebody committed adultery like this he already started in the heart before somebody go to steal he already stole in the heart because you got to make plan how to steal and then you execute your plan so the problem start in the heart are we together evil thought heart adultery come on fornication which means having sex before marriage adultery means you have sex outside of marriage you are married man and you go have sex with somebody else or you a married woman you go have sex with somebody else that is adultery it start from your heart fornication means you are not married whether you woman or a man and you because you in college you start having sex that sin before God that stuff started in your heart we together come on murder start where So when you say I'm going to kill that man you already killed him in the Heart come verse 22 F I just told you in the heart heart covetousness where in the heart wickedness where in the heart deceit Las an evil eye so before your eye become bad started in the heart because you must be angry and then your eyes change so the bad eye didn't start like this it was first in the heart that's why you must cumc heart Hallelujah come blasphemy in the heart pride in the heart I'm going to wear that skirt and show them and post it on WhatsApp so everybody can see from the heart I buy a new car post it on WhatsApp from the heart I bought a new house from the heart I dress on Sunday I have to post it on WhatsApp on Instagram from the heart Pride from the heart I hope I'm whooping somebody tonight glory to God foolishness from the heart verse 23 all these evil things come from within that's why God say You must be circumcised from the heart the mark of Distinction that I'm looking for it is not in the flesh I want to see the distinction from your heart because once that bad part of you that is the generator of all the bad stuff it's cut from you and remove everything is good I'm sorry I have to use this example if you have a to you go see the dentist and when you get there what do you tell the dentist if you didn't sleep for three days what do you usually tell the dentist take the tooth out remove the tooth it was your tooth but you say I can't sleep please remove the to even if the D say we can save it you say no no no no just take the too he used to be your too but because he begin to cause you problem the dentist have to take the tooth out when they take the tooth out the infection that was in the tooth goes also out and you get healed and everything come back to peace and there is a part of you that is causing you trouble and God say it is time that we need to cut that just like the dentist we move the we need to cut that part and throw that part away so that all the bad stuff won be coming out of you and then in that heart we will put the Holy Ghost and when we put the Holy Ghost now from you will come love will come peace will come gentleness will come long suffering all the good stuff will begin to come from you the circumcision from the heart glory to God let's go to Jeremiah 4:4 J suffer with me to go through the scripture amen because that's what your pastor requested and I have to obey the office Jeremiah 4:4 jerem if you dare you can say Amen am the Bible say circumcise yourself I want you to keep in mind that the first circumcision God is talking to from the natural from the natural to the spiritual amen God say circumcise what the heart keep that in mind why because from the heart come everything bad God say cut it off we clear now Jeremiah for for the Bible says circumcise yourself to the Lord and take away the for skin of your heart ye men of Judah and inhabitant of Jerusalem L my Fury come forth like fire and burn that none can quench because of the evil of your doings God look at people doing bad stuff doing bad stuff like you see people on the street dress bad homosexual all kind of trouble it is not them really the people that you see the problem is in the heart as long as you don't touch the heart they they won't change amen amen that was Jeremiah 4:4 are we there amen now let's go to Jeremiah uh uh 6 jerem I'm skiing something take the scripture you can read it at home Jeremiah 9 verse 25 and 26 you read it at home you can take a note let's go to Jeremiah 6 now verse 10 if you dare you can say Amen now Jeremiah say the same Prophet who say circumcise your heart now he's saying To Whom Shall I speak and give warning that they may hear now God is saying I'm talking it seems like they don't listen I'm talking they don't hear just like parent you tell a child they don't listen God say I'm talking they don't hear the problem was the heart I'm talking they don't listen so what is it the problem to this kids are you there let's read he says that's he said To Whom Shall I speak and give warning that they may hear be behold their what their ear is what circum so we got another part of the body that is not circumcised remember circumcision means cut the flesh brother Steven so we go to the doctor we cut our ears that's not what we speaking it's a ear now the ear must be circumcised in other word there is a part of your hearing that is problem why the heart bad things start from the heart amen why they here the Bible says behold their ear is uncircumcised and they cannot hearken the word god say ah the reason why they don't he there is something going on their ears is blocked that's the reason why you can holler they don't want to listen they preach can preach and preach preach and sweat they don't listen they have a problem in the ear not the natural but a spiritual ear because remember Jesus said to whom have are we there and then he says they cannot hearken the word of the Lord is unto them a reproach and they have no Delight in it now now put your seat belt and follow me carefully God is saying the problem is in the heart remove a bad heart and then the spirit of the Lord will come because you need to know when the Holy Ghost come where is he going because we see all kind of nonsense in a religious World they give somebody like this they touch somebody they fall on the ground so when they fall they W up they still bad people so where where where did that Holy Ghost go we want to have a good Holy Ghost but when he enter and we change and the Holy Ghost need to go where the problem is and the first problem is in the heart and God is is is again bringing another part he said the ears have a problem what is wrong with the ear why is the ear important for the Holy Ghost brother Sten I thought the heart is enough now you saying the ear is important for the where let's go to galatian especially those that have the English version galatian 3 if you thereare you can say Amen galatian 3 verse 2 if you thereare you can say Amen all right the Bible says this only would I learn of you receive by The Works of the law or by the hearing of faith those who have a version of English you see what I'm saying because I got a translator here the Bible is saying have you received the Holy Spirit by the work of the law or by the hearing of Faith so hearing by faith give the Holy Ghost are I'm reading the Bible I'm reading the Bible That's why God say circumcise what your because when you hear correctly it will bring the Holy Ghost as you hearing God telling you it is for you it is your promise and then when you hear it and you receive it in your heart now you get the two part you must first hear God Amen and then when you hear you receive it with your heart you understand you receive and you you hear it and you receive it in your heart the Holy Ghost can come through you maybe you didn't get that one well let's go to the book of Roman Roman 10 ROM Roman 10 Roman verse 17 if you thereare you can say Amen Roman 10 17 I want you all to see this you there the Bible say so then Faith cometh by what hearing and hearing by what so if your ear is not circumstan how are you going to hear so God is indicating to us two places you must listen listen to the word you must hear the word the hearing of faith and you must receive the word in your heart for you to receive the holy spirit amen am amen amen am now let's go to Malachi 4 remember we started with prophets and we see what happened with prophets and now from the prophet we move to the heart and we seen that the problem is the heart of a man the heart of a man need to be changed are we together let's go to Mal chapter 4 oh God and remember in Horeb you know what happened in God say I'm going to send you Prophet so Prophet will talk to you right Malachi 4 verse 4 if you dare you can say Amen remember ye the law of Moses my servant which shall command unto him in what we know what happened in God to speak to you he must send you a prophet are we together God say remember that to all for all Israel with the statute and judgment behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and He Elijah shall turn the heart of the father to the children and the Heart of the children to the father come and smite the Earth with the curse if you notice God is saying according to the law of I'm going to send you Elijah the Prophet Elijah the prophet have one target he only have one place he will turn the heart why the heart because the heart is where everything is coming and God say before I change the heart I must send you Elijah so with Elijah no circumcision relax my friend relax my friend I just read to you is my Bible different than your Bible is my Bible different than your Bible we have the same Bible the Bible say according to I use prophet and I'm going to use a prophet call Elijah Elijah in the Bible sometime they call him Elijah in the New Testament they call him Elias for those who know that it's the same man like monana it's the same man and they say I'm going to send you Elijah and God say when I send you Elijah Elijah have one target he's targeting the heart because the heart is where the problem is but the Bible is saying something very specific the Bible say when Elijah come he will take the heart of the children of the father first can I erase this he say Elijah when he come he will take the heart of the father and turn it to the children are we together and he will also take the heart of the children and turn it toward the father so when we look at this Elijah must come because we got a problem in our heart Elijah come our heart are Sav because God gave us the formula God gave us the solution he say I seen that you have a problem if you notice the last book of the Old Testament is Malachi watch please verify make sure I'm telling you the truth and if I say the truth can you say Amen so the people online can hear you can you say Amen ah you heard them the last book of the Old Testament is Malachi and the last verses of the Old Testament is what I just read word God diagnos in the Old Testament what is the problem with human beings the problem is the heart and the Heart need circumcision and before God close the Old Testament God give the solution God give the medication give the prescription he said this is the prescription they you for for you to know that the time have come that I'm coming to deal with the problem of humanity you will see Elijah when Elijah come on the that elij must be a prophet according to the law ofb because according Tob must send you a Prophet by the name of Elijah and when Elijah come he must do two things yes sir are we together he must turn the heart of the father to the children and the Heart of the children to the father are we together so now we need to find who is our Elijah remember the law and the prophet where until who until John remember and the prophet were until who why John I got excited I'm in a conference why John let's go to the Book of Luke Luke Oh Glory to God let's go to the Book of Luke Hallelujah Luke chapter 1 Luke Luke chapter 1 if you dare you can say amen amen verse five I need to give you a background here the Bible say there was in the days of Herod the king of Judah a certain priest named zaras of the course of ab and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron and her name was elizabethe so how many knows this story I can save if I don't see your hand raised so I know you don't know I will continue reading okay some hands are not so let's read Because if I continue I don't want to lose you verse uh six and they were both righteous before God walking in all the Commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless and they had no child because that Elizabeth was buried and they both were now well stricken in years and he came to pass that while he executed the priest office before God in the order of his court according to the custom of the priest office his lot was to burn ense when he went into the Temple of the Lord job to verse 11 and there appear unto him unto Zachariah an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the Altar offens and when Zariah saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon him but the angel said to him fear not Zari for that prayer is heard and that wife elizabethe shall bear a son and that shall call his name who John so we see the story of John bar they were Barren an angel appear and say God heard your prayer you're going to have a child and the child his name is who John the law and the prophet were until who John all right who is this John what is he trying to do all let's go verse 14 and thou shall have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from what his mother's womb this childn from his mother's womb the holy spirit is already working there but brother Steven you told me about Elijah and you told me that Elijah would take the heart of the children to the Father the father now you left Elijah you drop Elijah you are now in John what has John have to do with because we need to know the solution for our heart what is going on verse uh 16 follow me carefully you there you there you there and many of the children M of of Israel shall he turn to the Lord there God the mission of this Elijah is strange amen he's going to take the children and turn them to the Lord are we together but remember here Jesus is not born yet because John was olded than Jesus because when Jesus came Jesus came as a child and the Bible say this John he will take the the heart of the father and turn them to the child h brother Steven the Bible didn't say that the Bible say he would take many and turn to the Lord now you begin to interpret where did the the Bible say he would take the heart of the children to the father you T us at the beginning here do not interpret the word we want to see it from the Bible where he says the heart and then we will receive it thank you very much dear and let me give you the scripture let's go to the next verse verse 17 and he John shall go before him in the SP and the power of who El Elijah so Elijah now have changed name yes sir so if you looking for a man called Elijah el el you won't find him the spirit is Elijah but the name is John so Elijah doesn't mean his name must be El are we together are we together if I lost you raise your hand so I rep thank you all right the Bible say and he John the Baptist shall go before him in the spirit and the power of Elijah to turn the heart of the father to the children and the disobedience to the wisdom of the just and to make ready a people prepare for the Lord now we have discovered our Elijah our Elijah that was prophesied by Malachi his name is John that's why Jesus said the law the law and the prophet where until John because John is the is the result medication that we were looking for but there is a problem here when we read the Bible the bible say that John the Baptist who is the Elijah will turn the heart of the children of the father to the children but I don't see here where the bible say that John the Baptist will take the heart of the children to the father in other words Luke who was writing the Bible took the scripture of malach and in so now we got this Malachi in two scriptures what did John fulfill John fulfill the part the first part and the second part now John fulfill taking the father to the children that's say but Malachi say Elijah come he will turn the heart of the father to the children and the children to the father now we see an Elijah who's fulfilling the first one now where is our next Elijah I leave it to your pastor are we together are we together are we together now joh fulfill only a portion of the scripture get the father remember God who in San spoke to Our Father by the prophet John take the father and he bre to bring the father to the children amen remember Jesus when he look at older people and he said bring me that baby there bring me that child there and he put the child and Jesus say if all of you are not like they taking adult and they're bringing adult to to the faith of children it happened through John the Baptist but this part not happening in other word there must be a again who must be taking the heart of the children bringing them to the father because we need this to Elijah because the solution of our heart lays within this elah if you find this Elijah you find the Cure now let's go to John the Baptist let's ask John Baptist now you are Elijah and God told us in the Old Testament when we find you you will change our heart so we need to know what is the solution how do we circumcise the Heart John the Baptist tell me what is the formula are we together John tell me let's go to Luke three we were in Luke one Luke lukee 3 l verse1 15 if you dare you can say Amen Oh Glory to God Luke 3:15 you there the Bible says and as the people were in expectation and all men mused in their heart of who John whether he were the chist or not so when John the bapti came he came with a powerful Ministry every Juda moved so everybody begin to look at John they say but Moses told us God will send us the Messiah God will send us Christ Christ will come maybe John John must be the Christ because the way he preaches it should be him but the Bible didn't say that John is the Crist say that John is Elijah if he's Elijah he got the secret of the heart so the people went they say John you trouble us too much tell us the secret because God says circumcise the heart what will we do the Bible says this glory to God verse 16 John answered saying unto them all I indeed baptize with what but one M than I come the L of who shoes I am not worthy to un lose shall baptize with the Holy Ghost and with what now we find the solution in other words John is a billboard John is a s post when you get to John you find the right exit John will uce you to the solution of the holy spirit so when you arrive to John you on the right position that's why you must always find John because John is the perfect GPS to the solution of the heart and if you find the first John the first John introduce Christ so if there is another that have to come we need to find that because if you find that El you will find the second part of the solution of the heart amen yes sir are we together are we together are we together are we together John say it is not me it is Christ go to Christ if you want the Holy Ghost because I know your problem your problem is the heart your heart need to be circumcised and the solution to the circum must have the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost and Fire so when the Holy Ghost come a fire must burn that evil person of that that that bad excess portion of you must be crated I will send you Elijah to turn the heart we found our first Elijah Elijah where is the solution he say you came to the right place but I'm not the solution the solution is Christ when he cometh I cannot even touch his shoes he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire in other way the solution that you're looking for only God can do it the same God that could remove the spirit from Moses and put it in someone else is the same God that take the spirit that was in Christ and put it also in you so that your heart can be circumcised and now you will become pleasing unto the Lord let me wind up because my signal came oh God Amen I'm sorry we cannot get into what is that Holy Ghost glory to God amen amen amen amen glory to God GL Oh Glory to God we are on luk chapter uh 3 let's go to John 7 and then I'm going to nail here John John chapter 7 joh John the Baptist Tau us the solution the solution is who go to Jesus that's why the law Jesus said the law and the prophet were until John we clear now we came to John John the Bap say go see Jesus now me and you we need to walk to Jesus and we need to talk to Jesus to give us the solution John chapter 7 if you thereare you can say Amen John 737 in the last day that great day of the Feast of the feast Jesus stood and cry saying if any man thirst remember Isaiah God will pour out the water on the one who T If any man thirst let him do what now Isaiah say if you thirst God will do what P Water now Jesus is saying if you T come to me in other words what Isaiah was speaking right here yes sir come unto me and drink so when you get to Jesus Christ that's where the water is to drink verse 38 he that believeth on me as the scripture have said there is a key there believeth but I can't get into that he that believeth on him on me as the scripture have said out of his belly not to the stomach now that was the heart out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water in other word when Jesus come and you drink from him you become also a source from you begin to come also water so the Holy Ghost in you can move to another person Oh Glory to God verse 39 but what is Jesus talking about but this spake he of the spirit which day that believe on him should what reive there is two words there I can't get in detail now there is believe oh Lord have mercy and receive everybody clear follow me carefully because probably all of you go to church so believing Jesus is something and receiving the Holy Ghost is something you may believe but you don't have the Holy Ghost but Jesus say the Bible say this was a promise that whoever will believe don't stop at believing move forward and go get the Holy Ghost before you get the Holy Ghost you must first believe are we together if I can get there it will shock you the Bible says but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet what glorified in other word all the disciple didn't have the Holy Ghost that's why Jesus told them on the day of Pentecost all of you go wait over there but I have a problem do you know that those disciple were preaching I'm asking you a question do you know that the disciple were preaching do you know that the disciple were Healing The Sick know that P Walk On The Water whatever they did no Holy Ghost so this is the very dangerous place that's why people go to church and they do Miracle but they don't have the Hool it is dangerous wake up my friend do you know that Judas did Miracle he was among the disciple but if you notice he died before Pentecost he never made a so let's be careful oh I believe Jesus Christ that's good that's the first step you already believe 50 years you believe 20 years you believe 10 years did you receive the Holy Ghost let me go to act one and I'm going to stop here hallelujah oh God hallelujah amen yeah can touch this circumcision it is yeah let's go to act chapter one if you there you can say Amen amen your pastor is pulling and I'm trying to let you go actually it's uh yeah act one verse one yes let jop to verse four verse four and being assembly together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which he said ye have heard of him so Jesus gave them a promise he say wait don't go anywhere no more preaching all of you stand right there ah you preach with me that's say I'm going no more preaching all of you stay there amen when there verse four for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days so the disciple have to wait for the holy spirit amen jum to verse uh8 but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is com upon you and he shall be witness unto me in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the utmost part of the earth without that Holy Spirit you are not a true witness you are the religion you just go to church when did God talk to you when did you listen the voice of God when were you sitting and something do something and you satisfi the way you are canot take few minutes so I can reinforce your faith go with me to the Book of John because I don't want to let you hanging go to John 14 Hallelujah and then we stop amen amen amen John 14 verse 16 if you dare you can say Amen the Bible says and I will pray the Father Who Will Pray who will pray the father Jesus ah Lord do you know what it means when Jesus pray do you know that do you know that there is no prayer of Jesus that is without answer the Bible says the prayer of Jesus are always answered and now Jesus is saying I'm going to pray in other word the problem of the Holy Ghost it is no longer God it is you God already prayed for you so don't tell God God is a God has a problem God already prayed for it is you who have to open your heart the Bible says Jesus said and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may a b with you sometime no repeat what I say that he may that he might with you sometime that's what the Bible say now now now you responding now you responding I will give you another comforter that he will with you how many time forever in other word when the Holy Ghost will get in you he will never leave you you are guaranteed to go to the Rapture as hard as it seems many people preach the Rapture no Holy Ghost no Rapture he will be with you forever even the spirit of what truth whom the world cannot receive it's not for everybody you got to be on the written on the list the word cannot receive because he see him not nether know him but he know him for he dwell with him and shall be in you because Jesus himself have that Spirit last scripture uh John 16 verse 12 we John 14 16:2 and let finish here Jesus say this is very deep but may the Lord Inspire your pastor to pick it up the Bible says I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them more Jesus look at the disciple you understand now that no disciple had the Holy Ghost right we agree now because the Bible said the Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified Jesus have to be killed to pay the price so the Holy Ghost can come are we together so when the disciple look at the when Jesus look at the disciple he say I have many things to tell you but what I have to tell you you cannot receive in other word there are certain things of God you won't receive it because the Holy Ghost is not in you yet even if you go to church and the pastor preaches you're going to hear certain things but those who have the Holy Ghost will hear more than what you it's in the Bible my friend let me read it he says I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now in other word at this time you cannot take it you have to wait he says how be watch me when he the who the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into what in other word those things will work only when the Holy Ghost come when the Holy Ghost come he will guide you your perfect GPS is the Holy Ghost just as you need the good address to get somewhere you put the GPS and when you put the GPS whether you agree with me or not put your faith in the GPS because whatever the GPS tells you even if you never use that road before you always follow the GPS until you get there and the GPS say you have arriv and the perfect GPS is the Holy Spirit when he will get in you he will guide you and once he begin to guide you he will be in you and when he gu you you going to put your faith in him and sometime he will take you into Road you don't understand I've been in Boston but never seen him before this is the first time I saw him because somebody is guiding me and he guide me to you so that I can talk to you seen all of I never met you before I didn't know you want the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost guide me all the way to Boston to talk to you he will guide you in all truth until you have arriv may God fill you Holy Spirit may God give you what you desire may God give you what you came here for not being V God grant you the desire of your heart with the spirit of Godly bless bless you my my my my amen my my my my oh my I can't hold myself hallelujah amen amen am we good are we digesting the promise is for you it's for all of us amen and this is the problem here God already invest himself in it when God invest himself in something it means nothing else can stop it because when God put himself in the thing can you imagine you pray for the Holy Ghost but Jesus say I will pray for you amen you pray for the Holy Ghost but he said I will pray the father Jesus prayed for us but it's up to us to open the door for him because he stand at the door and he say I'm knocking open the door open not just the door but but all the doors Pride private life open the doors and when you open the doors he will come in and will dine with you he will give you the understanding and the things that he will say you will understand it and when you understand it you can be saved by your understanding your understanding changes your faith and it does a bit a lot but we're going to continue tomorrow amen maybe you want to sing yes sir
