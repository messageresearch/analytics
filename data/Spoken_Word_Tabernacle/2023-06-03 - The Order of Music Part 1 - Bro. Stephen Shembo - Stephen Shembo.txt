TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God bless you all and this is Brother Stephen chamble local pacifier in spoken word Tabernacle of Gastonia here in North Carolina in the United States this is an expo that we have done in uh about music and music has been such a treacherous subject very contradictory in the past until that we noticed that the music that the message Believers are listening to up to now got into the way that is swayed to the world there is no gauge there is no standard for it and we felt impressed in our heart to be able to address this subject before humility and uh according to the message of the hour and we trust that this exposition of music will be a tremendous blessing to you and for those who are local Shepherd that are Shepherd many group all over the world if you come across this table this video you can use it as a baseline And I know there are several quotes that brother Branham mentioned about music but I was not able to put it all there but at least we have a call from where we can work together and then you can add every single remaining code into it for the betterment of your church so enjoy music part one and then don't stop at part one because that's not all you will continue with music part two all the way to part three and I believe by the grace of God the Holy Spirit Will Enlighten you and make sure that whatever predicament the devil tried to bring into this message will be stopped and the children of God will be free to worship God in the spirit and in the truth with their clapping with their dancing with the music and music that is acceptable and appropriate for the children of God God richly bless you we love you of Bride of Jesus Christ but Stephen Shea thank you [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] happy [Music] amen amen amen we should have a house full tonight our musician here some of them okay praise God I gave 15 minutes just in case somebody has a legitimate reason to be a little bit behind so they can get caught but we can't be waiting waiting waiting if not we won't be able to do anything amen let's go to our scripture it's going to be First Corinthians if I would have put this in the slide I would not even sleep because I went to bed at around 5am amen oh my and in the morning you start having phone calls amen so I'm gonna take you as witness everybody that is here as witness we spoke about church order on December 3rd February 11th now we're talking about music so I opened the door to the whole church for whoever want to be a musician now or in the future or the kids that want to be musician everybody should be here so whatever is going to be put today it's set we okay so if anybody fast says I will call you all to talk to that person everybody okay so they have been given opportunity to be here to hear it so we make sure everything is good but if somebody goes and go grab any kind of song and try to bring it here and we say no I don't want any problem we okay let's go to First Corinthians I will repeat it tomorrow with my weaknesses Lord's willing First Corinthians 11 verse 29. because it's very easy to complain but few are reading the scripture and if you are listening to the message that's where we get all the fusses First Corinthians chapter 11 verse 29. okay the Bible says for he that it is and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself what does it mean unworldly not Discerning the Lord's body that Lord's body is not what you're eating here in communion the Lord's body is the bread of Jesus Christ if you need a scripture on that you see me in other words somebody's behaving a certain way not respecting the body of Jesus Christ the people of God that have the Holy Ghost amen verse 30 for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep see how we can get in trouble by playing with church amen for if we would judge ourselves we should not be how you might be seated so if you judge yourself at home we won't have to do anything here amen because the Judgment we're talking about is not our judgment it is not the Judgment of the United States it is not the Judgment of Europe or Africa or whatever it is the Judgment through the word of God so if you judge yourself according to the word of God automatically you don't have to be judged here in other words you got a sticker you got your Visa you got checking like on the airport you just go straight and enter the plane because you judge yourself everybody okay the Bible says but when we are judged we are chesting of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the water so even if you didn't judge yourself or something sleep up you didn't catch it when we are addressing it the purpose of it we're trying to get you off the fire everybody okay we don't want you to stay here in the tribulation period amen so when correction is coming it's not in a way to put you down if correction is coming in a way to put you down that's not correction anymore everybody okay so that's not a problem I mean that's a problem right there amen but correction is coming in the way to rescue you and to protect you to say brother you're off the line the devil can get you here let's go back in the line so you stay fortified everybody okay praise be to the name of the Lord he says wherefore my brethren verse 33 when you come together to eat normally everybody in the choir should be here everybody that is playing in the choir should be here he said wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and he sent me any man hunger let him eat at home that he come not together unto condemnation this is the key and the rest will add the water so there is no way you can get Church Without order amen you cannot have a church without an order you can even now have a company without an order you cannot even have a house without an order so church and Order goes together amen glory to God in either word if you love order you will love me quickly everybody okay let's go to First Corinthians chapter 14. glory to God so if somebody say no they're going to record then they're going to give it to me then I don't have to come there good luck amen First Corinthians Chapter 14 verse 33 I taught few folks that have a legitimate reason to get on a phone hookup if they can be able to get it first Corinthians Chapter 14 verse 33 if you dare you can say Amen amen glory to God very familiar scripture you there for God is not the author of water so if you see confusion do you have to think twice it's the devil God is Not in other words never God never will be the author of confusion so if you see something that brings confusion just stay away it is not God amen because God cannot be the author of confusion the Bible saying for God is not the author of confusion but of what as in all churches of the Saints job to verse 40. lovely let water in other words everything that we would do in this church everything let all things be done how and in water you can't get away from order so church and order we just saw they go together amen but now Paul is saying let everything that we do everything number one he's not the author of confusion amen but how would we know everything must be done decently and huh everybody okay if something doesn't reflect decency everybody okay and does not reflect the order should we be partaker of it we can close here and then I can go home the Bible say let all things amen be done how and how if it's not done decently and it's not in order why do we sit and argue everybody okay something doesn't look decently why do we want to argue everybody okay glory to God last scripture let's go to TARDIS so First Corinthians Paul wants things to be done in order he said I will get there and I'll set things in order in other words certain things are not correctly in order when I got there I will make sure order is there then another one Paul is saying everything that we do in church must be done how decently and in order now let's go to Titus Chapter One if you're there you can say Amen verse 4. Paul's saying to Tardis my own son after they come on faith Grace Karma mercy and peace from God the father and the Lord Jesus Christ Our Savior for this cause left ID in quit to do what that that should just do what how many scripture have I give you about order this is not brother Branham say even though it is brother Brian I'm saying because the message in the Bible are one but I'm giving you pure scripture where order is important for church Paul is saying that I want you to set in order the things that are what so there are certain things that were lacking in the church and Paul say I want you to go there and put them in order they are there but they need order the gifts are there gift need the officer are there the officer need everybody okay he say set in order the things that are wanting and ordained Elder in every city as I have appointed so the one who already gave instruction is Paul so Timothy is doing things according to the instruction of Paul which is the instruction of the messenger of the age and we have our messenger now we got to do things according to William Marion Branham everybody okay we good let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly father this evening thanking you once again for your grace for your love for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we are committing this service unto the hand and we remember and acknowledge that we are human being we are subject to limitation and subject to error father but Lord we want the Holy Spirit the one that is perfect to come in the midst of us and to minister to us father may you move me completely out of the way may you come and father minister to your children be the Alpha and the Omega of this service we rebuke every demonic Spirit contrary to your word away from this place Lord father bless us as we gather together around the things of the Kingdom in Jesus precious name amen glory to God Amen you will need your bible really handy I'm going to go step by step the way I wrote them so I make sure I don't miss anything amen glory to God our subject tonight is about music somebody can call it songs or whatever but it's about music amen before we address music itself we need first of all to understand certain keys if we don't we're going to miss everything amen because it's easy to Define music but why are we talking about music tonight if music was something so simple that we all know why are we sitting discussing about music what is the purpose of us meeting tonight what is so important about music that we have to gather here on a Saturday that you should be somewhere with your family enjoying what is wrong with music amen before we address music the first point I'm gonna pull is we have two kingdoms amen in this world we have the kingdom of God amen and we have the kingdom of the devil or Satan everything that is going on in the universe everything that is going on in this world everything that is going on in the churches in our family in our own life is between two Kingdom those Kingdom you can call them two powers or you can call them two forces and these two forces are behind everything that is done everything that is done it's either God amen or it's either Satan amen everything that is done and God when we speak about God God is the creator Amen in other words God is the one who always start first everybody clear in other words God is the original Amen in other words God is the standard amen whatever he does is perfect whatever he does is good whatever he does he create it's already wired it's already proven it's already been checked it cannot be altered it is the way it is everybody okay but Satan is not a creator everybody okay Satan is only according to the message he is a pervertor so if I say something tonight and I'm quoting a scripture or I'm telling you that this is what brother Brown I'm saying you have a right to see me after church or to send me a message and I have a right to find that scripture or that quote and give it to you so that it's not going to be my word my thinking it is the word of God the word of the Prophet amen so Satan is a perfect perverted means that he usually waits for the original everybody okay as we go in this way it will help you in music he always wait for the standard he always wait for that which is good because when God created everything was good everybody okay and once he was the original is set it's already created Satan will come after the original and he will take the original and change it into something else everybody okay so hence we have not only two Kingdom not only to power not only two forces now we got two music everybody okay we got a Godly music amen and we got a satanic music what we call worldly music amen what we call a secular music this one is called Godly it is called divine what we call church music what we call worship music what we call Christian music everybody okay so far everybody good so far amen now since we got two of them these two sources here God and the devil and these two music here there is a music for god and there is a music for Satan let me read something that brother Branham says if you need a quote see me after church I could not make the PowerPoint if I do PowerPoint I won't have time to sleep in the message crust in 1955 paragraph seven I can even print this out and hand it to you if you want to every code like this we're not Catholic we don't hold stuff we can give it to you everybody okay because I already highlighted and everything I got it there amen he says God is in music he said don't you believe God is in music he says certainly God is in music he is in art God is in the universe everybody okay second quote from hearing receiving and acting in 1960 paragraph 65. brother Branham say I love art God is in art everybody okay by the brand I'm saying the right kind of art why the right can because there is how many sources everybody okay see why the whole church should be here he said God is in art the right kind of art he said God is in music the right kind of music so there is a right kind of music why because we got two Kingdom we got two power we got two forces there's four we got two sources everybody okay brother Branham say God is endearsing everybody okay so God because our title is music god brother Branham say is in music I don't want to write art because we're not dealing with art and brother random say also God is in nursing but both of these must be right everybody okay he said God is in dancing the right kind of dancing God isn't shouting everybody okay God isn't shouting everybody okay brother Branham say comma the right kind of shouting why because it's two sources it's two Kingdom it is still power it is two forces You're Gonna Know You must know where you're going everybody okay another one in the message Elijah and Elisha in 1954 paragraph 39. brother Branham say I was talking to a man not long ago that didn't believe in music in the church he was holding a fuss with me about it he said oh the music belongs to the world I say brother Branham the spirit of God didn't come under Stewart prophet until he got the mixture out and begin to play a good old-fashion Holy Ghost song everybody okay Holy Ghost song and the spirit of God come down on the prophet that is right brother Branham continues he say God does not change and if God liked in the past music in that day God likes music today yes sir everybody okay everybody good so God is in music we just want to find the right kind of music he's in dancing we want to find the right kind of dancing he's in shouting we must find the right kind of what shouting how many music do we have to music we have a Godly music and a satanic music let's go to Ephesians 5 verse 19. glory to God Hallelujah Ephesians 5 verse 19. if you dare you can say Amen somebody already got it amen you got it you got it verse 19 I'm gonna go slowly because this is a very treacherous subject amen Paul say speaking to yourself in water and water and water so there is songs that are spiritual not all songs are spiritual they are song that are spiritual everybody okay spiritual songs singing and making melody in your to the water I gave you this just to show you that there is a spiritual song and there is songs that are not spiritual everybody okay so if God loves music if God loved dancing everybody okay if God loves shouting so music started in heaven everybody okay if you go to heaven they are there is music everybody okay they are creature in heaven that have been created 24 hours to all to do nothing else everybody okay but to worship God [Applause] do you know who they are you don't know open the Book of Revelation I don't want anybody to get out of here without knowing and say brother Stephen say but I didn't see it okay let's go to the Book of Revelation chapter four glory to God if you dare you can say Amen you there verse 6. you there you know what let me give you two so it makes sense okay let's go to verse two because you must know why are they worshiping they're worshiping what a tree amen verse two and immediately I was in the spirit and behold the water so if there is a throne it's telling you somebody belongs to that Throne a throne is a seat so somebody must be sitting there everybody okay there is a throne in heaven and not in the earth in heaven and one sat on the water so the one not two so the one that is sitting on the throne is God we already know that amen so when God is enjoying in his house the king when God is sitting on his throne in the king what's going on around him does he want to be quiet everybody okay now job two verse 6 and before the water Before the Throne so the throne is sitting there God is sitting right there and then Before the Throne something is happening what is happening why did he create this thing and Before the Throne verse 6 there was a sea of glass like unto Crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about The Throne were four beasts full of eyes before and how and the first piece you know this was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third Beast had the face as a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle now we know it's four beasts what are their purpose and the four beasts has each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within and the rest not how and water you take a break this creature don't take a break everybody okay and remember these are the four anointings we already know what it is and these four anointing goes with the church everybody okay what are these anointing doing in heaven in the Throne of God in the Tabernacle of God in the Temple of Heaven amen the Bible says and the rest not day and night saying a water holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which is which was and is and is to water everybody okay verse 9 and when does this give glory and honor and thank to him that sat on the throne who live forever and ever everybody okay everybody okay the four and 24 and 20 Elder fall down before him that sat on the throne and did what so who started the worship the Beast the anointing started and then he catches the other one okay if in heaven these anointing 24 hours our worshiping God and these anointing are responsible for the church ages what is our ego anointing doing in heaven 24 7 it's doing what everybody okay everybody okay go to revelation 5. glory to God if you dare you can say Amen jump to verse 8. we want to see music in heaven you there and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the 24 Elder fell down before the having every one of them water so musical instrument didn't start on the Earth [Music] everybody okay musical instruments started where amen fell down before the lamb having every one of them water and God involved full of order which are the prayers of the water verse 9 and they sang a what so song didn't start in heaven everybody okay I mean didn't stand on the earth I'm sorry you know what I'm saying everybody okay a new song saying there are what look at the theme to take the book and to open the sales thereof for there was slain and had redeemers to God by their blood out of every Kingdom amen and tongue and people in water everybody okay now these drop down and they have instrument when the seals were broken they begin to play their guitar everybody okay when they begin to play the guitar something happened in heaven the one that started this is only the four Beast and the 20 Elder did you see any Angels there let's see what he caused in heaven everybody okay job to verse 10 and has made us unto our God water and we shall reign on the water when they start this music something happened verse 11 and I beheld and I heard the voice of water so somebody joining [Applause] I had Minister asking me if choir was good ministers in the message you see he says and many angels and the voice of many angels round above the water and the beasts and the Elder and the number of them was what times and thousands of saying with a love voice saying with water God is in what everybody okay the right kind inhale they shout in heaven they Shout you're gonna get it [Music] everybody okay ah everybody okay praise God he said with a loud voice Worthy is there that was slain to receive water and and and water and water and water and water and every creature which is in water and on the water and under the water and such as are in there and all of them and and all that are in them heard who so when John sing even hell hears it [Applause] what kind of singing is this do you think his voice really was going to hell how did hell hear his voice if he is in heaven what kind that transmitter is not a first time or they were in tune on the internet live streaming [Laughter] oh my God I like to preach like this so we relax amen let's go to uh Revelation chapter 14. music in heaven Revelation chapter 14. if you dare you can say Amen you there you there verse 2. take note to my friend so you can deal with this with somebody and I Heard a Voice from Heaven as the voice of many water we know who their voice is and as the voice of a great water we know that Thunder and I heard the voice of who so Heaven Got musician everybody okay everybody okay you won't change this buffet for eternity that's why brother Branham say if you go to heaven if you want to find me look where there is music so not only does God love music brother brand of love music everybody okay good he says that the voice of Harper so they are musician in heaven hopping with the water so we got musician with musical instrument in heaven we are not on the Earth and they did water they sang as they were a water so singing new song is not a problem [Music] when the seals open and the inspiration broke a new song also comes with it the source is from heaven so the song must be a and work on the music and work on the dancing and work on the setting you're gonna find God there amen everybody okay I'm just at the beginning my friend I'm still warming at the airport everybody okay the Bible continue he said and the Sun as he wear a new song before the you know who who was before the throne and before the fall so this is not the forbest this is not the one on the throne amen and the Elder so this is not the Elder we also we we saw them in Revelation 5. but this is somebody else beside the elders beside the four beasts beside the one on the throne this is another group what are they doing amen they sang as you were a new song Before the Throne before the four beasts and the Elder and no man could learn that song so a song can be learned is there any problem I will get to your training if we need training on the music do we need rehearsal we're gonna go by the Bible but here you can already see that you can learn a song we okay on that one and let me keep it on the back side you can learn a song so when I flip here you know where it came from okay glory to God Amen and no one should learn that song by the hook the 144 who which were how from the water they also have instruments so going back to our subject to our first key the first key is we got Harmony Kingdom to Powers two forces it's either God or the water and from there we got two sources of music We Got The Godly uh music and we got a satanic music everybody okay now the second point I'm gonna go is both of these sources I have not touched music the way I'm going near we're going with the sources then we pick up music everybody okay now our patient is already anesthetized and everything okay the blood pressure is good and everything okay alrighty now the second point now is these two sources we okay these two Kingdom amen have chief everybody okay their Chief is God or the other Chief is who both of these sources seek worshiping everybody okay are we okay are we okay now we're not talking about the sources you understand the sources now amen both of this sources if music starts from Heaven there must be a music from hell let me leave it alone amen okay these two sources seek worship everybody okay in other words God is after worship and Satan also is after worship everybody okay everybody good let's go to Matthew chapter four you must have your Bible don't don't even go left and right you must have your battle please yeah but Robert can I get water yes we must have a Bible hey everybody okay if you usually forget it you can leave your Bible in church and you buy one for home so when you come in church you just pull your sword everybody okay I have a bubble in my car a bubble at work a Bible a home every car I have have a Bible so everywhere I am I can pull the gun everybody okay Matthew chapter four if you dare you can say Amen verse 8. both of these sources made worshiper they need followers amen Matthew 4 verse 8 the Bible say and again the devil take care of him up into he's taking Jesus Christ not even you Jesus Christ himself taking him up into an exceeding high mountain and show him all the kingdom of the and the water amen amen so before the devil make a proposition to Jesus he showed him what he got amen he said come let me show you what I got this is not the kingdom of God amen he comes here and he says sit down here look what I got look America look Europe look this look this look this look this you see this Jesus said yeah I see this he said not only the kingdom but let me show you the glory of the Kingdom in other words the popularity that goes with it he said look at this when you look whoa everybody's talking about you everybody's about you everybody you owe you on television you're on Facebook you're on Instagram you you everywhere you're making shows and everything he said you seen this now this is what I got you there you there verse 9 and say unto him all these things will I give thee in condition if that will do what and what everybody okay so if somebody is popular in this world if somebody's glorious all over the Earth everybody's talking about them what have they done really because the devil doesn't give you the stuff without a condition [Music] everybody okay the devil won't give it to you just for free he doesn't give you for free write me down okay yes yes amen what does the devil do the devil say all these things I know why I'm praising this thing because you must be able now to sit at home watch a clip and you say I'm not gonna listen to this Christian music without me telling you anything if you do that we'll befriend but if you cross that border right here I don't take chance I just shoot and when I shoot to kill everybody okay everybody okay because if you already passed the body and you hear it's already dangerous so I gather or pulled the last bullet to make sure you dead not you I won't kill you I'm killing the one behind everybody okay everybody good okay now he says all these things will I give thee if that will fall down and do what you see somebody popular all over the world everybody knows about him you go to South Africa they know about him you go to Europe they know about them you go to South America they know about it you go to Canada they know about them what have that person done with the Devil come on now they fell down already and they worshiped the devil that's why every Kingdom they're going they have a free pass because the kingdom are the kingdom of the devil the devil is after worshiping he wants people to worship Him everybody okay everybody okay verse 10 and then say Jesus unto him get thee yes how behind Satan for it is written that shall Worship the Lord that and him shall do what even though Satan is looking for service you are you are wired to only serve one person and to worship only one person my point two Kingdom two music both of those kingdom are looking for workers they were looking for followers they're looking for worshiper we found here according to Matthew that Satan is after worshiper what about God let's go to John chapter 4. from Matthew 4 to John 4. because if we touch music right now some will begin to go no no no let's go to the fruit when we because what we're doing we are uprooting the whole thing by the time I pull it up like this I don't have to do anything to the to the fruit and the other one because the the stuff is outside I can leave it there and go to sleep it will die everybody okay let's go to John chapter four glory to God Hallelujah if you dare you can say Amen John chapter 4. your boss gave me this few minutes in that office our boss verse 23 you there you can say Amen but the hour everybody okay the hour cometh so God is looking for something he said woman there is an hour that is coming the hour cometh and now is when the true shall worship the father in water and in water for the father do what so God seek also worshiping but for you to give God the correct worship you must make sure your worship is in truth and in spirit everybody okay the worship of God have also a condition the condition of the worship of God is it must be in truth and it must be how what is truth is what which is what my word are truth another word for you to be a correct worshiper everybody okay when you worshiping God make sure you are in the word amen am in the spirit in other words you cannot worship Him Connally everybody okay because those are the worshipers that the father do what seeketh the devil seeketh the father also Seekers both Kingdom sick worshiper they say but for the father seek if such to worship him God is a water and they that worship Him water not me it's a must you it's a requirement you got to do it that way must worship Him how and in water if your worship doesn't match these two things multiply by zero everybody okay in other words when you make your worship to enter toward God he's checking two things is this season with truth and uh and spirit if it's seasoned with truth and spirit I can eat it then you pass the inspection if not as much as we can clap hand over there zero everybody good first key to Kingdom God devil he produced two source of Music Godly music and satanic music God is in music God is indecent God isn't shouting he must be the right kind because there is a good Anna bad one everybody okay now both of these kingdoms seek what worshiper everybody good key what is the third key everybody okay what is the age that we're living with the age we're living in in other words what is the condition of the time why is this important amen amen if you're fighting in America amen you must know the grand of America everybody okay you must know when to fight you must know that the serve is a little bit warmer than the North come on now brother everybody okay if your fight goes to Michigan you make sure it's not in winter because all your tank will be stuck somewhere because you have not gained the the area you're working on everybody okay everybody okay you must learn Where You Are you must know the time you live in it everybody okay because the devil also work according to the time help us Lord everybody okay everybody okay let me ask you a question breaded hair in the Bible was for prostitute braided hair so in that time when they see you with breaded hair everybody goes away from you is breaded hair a problem today it's a house you heard it everybody okay everybody okay so you cannot fight the devil using the weapon [Applause] I have a coat of brother Brown I already gave it to you in the hotel you gotta know the time you are and the weapon amen your opponent cannot be using drone and you are coming with a sword you need to also update in the Drone everybody okay We Are The Sinner so what is the condition of our time before we move forward what is our time what is the age we're living in loud is here amen so he behooves us to see what is in laodicea how does the devil operate in laodicea so we know how to fight him because the way the devil operate he's gonna operate in everything everybody okay everybody okay let's go to revelation 3. am I okay the way I'm going with the speed okay because if I rush we don't want to miss it this is a difficult subject amen I didn't see the brother here today but he asked on Wednesday to be here I told him he can come he's a minister so in case you wonder that brother say on Wednesday we didn't see him I'm giving you the answer he got a green light so it's not on me okay okay Revelation 3 verse 14. if you dare you can say Amen and unto the age of the Church of the laodicean right these things say the amen the faithful and the true witness the water the beginning of the creation of who okay I know that works God say I know the work of laodicea before now this happened God already know how are the work of laodicea in other words when you reach laodicea this is how the devil operate the devil in the poor time worked different than the devil now Paul didn't have cell phone everybody okay he didn't have iPhone the gospel they have to travel from Word of Mouth that's their gospel that's not us we can stream right now and they can see me in Australia amen what is this like what is the setting of laodicea according to the prophecy the Bible say I know that works that there are neither nor stop there is two words there you ready how many kingdom do we have how many power do we have how many forces do we have how many music do we have how many kind and which are seeking worshiper how many words do we have there everybody okay everybody okay so one of the word is called another one is hot and we got only two sources so one of the source will pick up either chord or hat we okay so according to the age we're living in we found a condition of two the condition must be either hot or the condition must be either what but according to the prophet God is the devil [Applause] everybody okay we're going from The Source The Source The Source God is satanic when they say you quote spiritually it's a problem everybody okay then heart is who that is the introduction of laodicea let's go back again they say I know that work that data neither water no water stop now laodicea doesn't say that his heart he does even say that he's cool because if you hurt I know what that means if I bring a hot wire a pocket you're gonna hear a beautiful scream out it goes in because it's hot if I put something called you go like wait a minute this is too cold we know what it does but laodicea is an edge that refuse the extremities everybody okay laodicea doesn't want to be called he doesn't want to be off so hard he wanna stay somewhere in the middle you gotta know the age you live in it in other words want to mix the two sources together everybody is following me everybody is following me La odisha is never called or never had if you're living in laodicea and you want to see Satan look at him while he's in the Warmness foreign take God and Satan and mix them together [Applause] amen and me and bring something that is lukewarm everybody okay if you take it somebody must say it's hot somebody also might say no no no no this is not hot hot is hot this is this is kind of cold everybody okay everybody okay remember God is never the author of what remember that from the beginning something that confuses you are we together when I go this way then you're gonna judge music yourself everybody okay let's go to verse 15. another words that there are neither called nor wood or water God say I want you to show me your position if you are for me be for me if you are for the devil before the devil you don't get me yet another word what God is saying if you Christian I want you to be 100 percent Christian so when I come to you I don't have to think twice are you following me if you are devilish make sure you do a very good job for the devil so when I come to you I'm dealing with a sinner but I don't like for you to be in church but you look like the world everybody okay verse 16. so then because there are water so you see that from the scripture is an edge of lukewarmness amen lukewarm and neither called nor I will do what out of my if you had I know if you called ano but if you look warm God himself will spew you out now let me ask you a question if God spew you out what do you want me to do to you okay if I pointed somebody he must say something guitar If God spew you out what what will be my attitude toward the guitar If God already spilled the guitar what do you want me to do to love it so I love more than God everybody okay if God spews something out what should I do why is God spewing did that because it's neither no so if you see something that that gives you a blending between Christianity and worldliness between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the devil between the two forces automatically God was filled out that's it [Music] yes I can stop right here we can go home when you look at TV on your Christian music what do you see what do you see I'm asking you what do you see there is a beautiful test okay you who love your YouTube channel YouTube YouTube worship YouTube YouTube worship fine I understand okay okay okay take your artists on YouTube make sure it's a clip okay make sure there is some videos usually the clip they will show you somebody nature or somebody shaking or breaking down all kind of stuff put that in front of you do you follow me take the volume off everybody okay take the volume off turn the volume to zero remove the volume sit down and watch what do you see you see God you see the devil did you see a magician coming out do you see also God so what do you see what do you see you say it's a Christian music okay turn the volume off this is what we're watching what do you see when you see somebody I mean a Lexus or maybe a BMW going on what do you see they're driving what is the driving saying what is the driving showing are they showing God when they're coming out of their car the video is uh recording uh I mean their food their shoes when they come they put like this Jesus I love you and then the car opened how does that shoe look I'm asking you a question when you look at the shoe of that woman that have a beautiful voice higher than our sister here how do you see that shoes what do you see everybody okay I'm taking you all tonight as my weakness to every song that will come here everybody Okay let's listen to William Marion Branham brother Branham says this in the message Discerning the body of the Lord brother Branham says now verse paragraph 27 our eternal destination not temporal Eternal destination in other words when you get this destination it's over brother Branham say our Eternal destination is not all together determined but what we see and what we hear there is two words brother pranam is using the word see which involve your vision or your visual amen and he's involving the word hearing which is going with your ear everybody okay can you read this yeah your what everybody okay brother Branham say our Eternal destination is not all together determined by what we see and what we hear but it is determined on what discernment we have of what we see and what we hear ing something is not a problem seeing something is not a problem but how do you interpret how do you discern how do you decode what you see everybody okay so la odisha according to the condition of the age it's an age that takes the things of God and the things of the world the two Kingdom and mix them together and blend them and bring something in the middle amen so you as a Believer when you see the things of that audition your Eternal destination will be depending on the discernment that you have on what you see and what you hear the seeing is your video on YouTube it is your DVD player it is your Instagram it is your status your hearing is what you're hearing from the back of it so when you heal when you see what do you decode from that amen what you decoding from that is going to be responsible for your destination I don't know if you get me in other words when you look at something and you see something and you make a judgment do you follow me the Judgment you're making will either get you away from God I don't know if you're following or you will get you closer to God I'm gonna say this God means what it's worldly music none of you probably here listen to Wordly music heart is what but lukewarm is so what you gonna get in trouble is not really worthily yeah it is not this music you're not here you gave your life to Jesus Christ that is not your problem amen Satan doesn't want to go here because here he's going to worship God Satan want to go in the middle here amen so here you are the devil here you are still at the Devil because God say if you hear he will do what when you're listening to your favorite artist put the video clip what do you see when you hearing their music what do you hear what is the condition of the age you live in your age is dangerous amen the age we're living here is a deceptive age tired what set and work with it today is not something that is going to show you Brandt that I am setting it is something that is Blended together [Music] it is something that look like Christian it is something at the beginning you'll think you are Christian until you find yourself in the hand of the devil the Bible say in Matthew 24 24 you can put it down the Bible says that the deception of laodicea will be so great that it will deceive the elect if we were water if any late is almost to be deceived how is that deception any latest somebody you will never deceive but the deception of laodicea goes very close to almost get an electing trouble [Music] everybody okay everybody okay let's go to Matthew 7. did you see me touching music yet Matthew 7. verse 21. if you dare you can say Amen lack of these Keys is why we argue is why we fast these are why we can sit seven hours like Jehovah Witnesses and if and and and each party go with their own thoughts that they came up with and sometimes we part one another we don't want to talk to each other because there was so much fusses Matthew 7 verse 21 if you dare you can say Amen you there not everyone that say unto me certain Satan I don't know if you're getting me I don't know if you understanding me the deception of laodicea if you are waiting to hear your Christian musician to tell you Satan you will never hear it your favorite song uh song Whatever worshiper that you get on YouTube will never use the word Satan he will even say Satan I don't like you and you say you do here he says Satan I don't like you and you say yes you see he doesn't like Satan because you are expecting him to tell you Satan I love you that's childish in laodicea that's really childish amen if you want this message and you are expecting the devil to show you that I'm the devil you really don't know what you're doing everybody okay there are people sitting at home now with legitimate reason there are people that are sitting at home without legitimate reason they purposely say they're not gonna come they claim the Holy Ghost all of them everybody okay amen the Christian everybody okay which I didn't say did not everybody okay the Bible said not everyone does said to me say Lord Lord shall enter in the Kingdom of water in other words when somebody says Lord Jesus Lord Jesus it means nothing I don't know if you're getting me what I'm trying to say is your musician when he speaks he uses the word of the Lord everybody okay but it doesn't mean because he's saying Lord Lord in his song that his song is correct in other words when somebody said Jesus Jesus Jesus doesn't mean it's okay I don't know if you get me what I'm trying to show you is the deception of the agent this age will never tell you Satan Satan that's in the different end this age is Jesus Jesus but me and you we are boyfriend but we can kiss we can sleep but we are Jesus tomorrow we can go to church oh he's good he's so sweet uh-huh more than sugar itself he said not everyone that say Lord Lord shall enter in the Kingdom of Heaven but he that do the water of ma which is in water so when somebody is doing Christian stuff don't focus at the word do you follow me and now this year don't focus at the word look at the life I don't know if you're following me if their life is not correct and the word is correct they are dangerous [Music] if your musician that you watch on YouTube well what he's seeing is good but the way he acted and his life is not correct you need to be careful [Applause] amen why it is the condition of the age everybody okay let's get to verse 22. many not few welcome will say to me in that day what so do you expect your Christian musician if he misses the Rapture do you expect him to come before God and say I was not a Christian he will claim it he will say Lord I was all over in the convention they were calling me I'm the one who was warming out the convention I was not singing for Satan everybody okay he said Lord Lord have we not prophesied in your name I can catch this tomorrow in that name have cast our devil in that name do wonderful work many wonderful words and then I will profess unto them and never what let me ask you a question let's be honest because some of you are watching Pentecostal preachers okay I'll show you a Pentecostal preacher that is preaching Jesus Christ everybody okay and then he prophesied and the prophecy is correct he prayed for the sick and the Seeker here but God is saying despite everything that I gave it to you I never knew that preacher how are you going to bite to that because when people do Miracle all of it we got message Believers struggling with that oh I listen to that Pentecostal preacher I mean you should see my brother look at the video they bring somebody on the wheelchair he's walking who told you that is a definite right that God is with them but that's the way you gauging them you are opening your heart to them because of Miracle because of Prophecy and because of them speaking Jesus Jesus all the time but God is saying here that are never in other words all the work that preacher was doing never swallow that one because I mean if you watch the kind of music message believer are listening now and they even posting it's a shame kids dancing sexy and the parents are putting that on on our on uh WhatsApp so everybody will see how they can move their hips message believer everybody okay everybody okay I never knew you depart from me ye that work water iniquity means what you know something better you don't want to do it amen let me see yeah I never knew you let me see if I can grab something go back to verse 15. if you're there you can say man be aware of what come to you in water so if I mean okay sheep clothing comma but inwardly they are water God is telling you when Satan is coming to you he will not show you he's a wolf he will first take a a ship court and put on on top of him then he's coming so if you're watching your favorite artist what are you going to see in front everybody okay you shall know them by there do men gather Grapes of tongues or fix of officer even so every good tree bringing forth by the corrupt tree bringing forth water a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit if your music is good why is he making you do what you do amen every tree that bringeth forth not good fruit verse 19 easy Yoon done and cast into the water fire wherefore by there you shall do what when you go on your YouTube you click your channel when you look turn the volume down what fruit do you see what fruit do you see okay the fruit are telling you that somebody is wearing your pants it's a genic band and the pant is cut here cut here cut here there are a hair are dread going this way and they're singing for the Lord the shirt and button and they are exerting in this word no matter what people did to you you need to stay strong Jesus Christ is the Lord you look at them a woman with paint cuts down like this everything done like this and you say oh that was so good and you take it and you post it so that we can see that foolishness so if rather Stephen is the one patrolling at block brother Stephen so he doesn't see block this one block brother Robert block brother Katie broke by the Stephen block this one let the other one see everybody okay everybody okay what do you see your Eternal destination is based on this thing you the one doing the inspection based on what you see and what you are everybody okay let's go to Second Corinthians then we get in music second Corinthians chapter 11. if you did you can say Amen glory to God so when you bring in your title of music when you bring in your special when you're bringing whatever you bring make sure you already do your due diligence okay because over here there is only one Cannon it's automatic everybody okay second Corinthians chapter 11 verse 13. if you dare you can say Amen for such our false word they are not false they are false apostle they are not false sinners it's false an apostle Apostle good false bad mixed together so when you see them they are Apostles but they are false so don't expect them to be Sinners oh okay this is a sin I won't listen to you no he's going to be an apostle first but he's false the problem is how do you know he's false amen deceitful how odisha transforming themselves into the Apostle of water how can you decode somebody like this do you think it's easy for you to decode music when I see people fussing I don't see what is wrong with this music I understand it's your level of discernment is low that's why you don't have the ability to decode it if you increase your life with God you will decode that quickly the reason why you're swallowing or you're swallowing it's based on your level let's go verse 14 and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into a water now let me ask you a question if Satan become an angel of Light and come out how are you gonna know it's certain how are you going to know it's Satan if you see the angel of Light standing like this how do you know it's not God but that's why you heard brother Branham saying the angel of the Lord is always scriptural brother Branham knew what he was saying you know the word all the time he needs to hear what is the Angel saying even made a statement if the angel of the Lord tell me something that is not in the Bible I won't accept him [Applause] why why because Satan himself can change into an angel of Light [Applause] [Music] Satan one appeared to you as Satan I don't see what's wrong with Christian music I don't see what's wrong with this music everybody okay verse 15 therefore it is no great thing if he is what also be transformed as minister of what whose ends shall be according to their water all I'm showing you by this my brother my sister it's a bad age in other words the way the devil work today the devil worked by deception the devil when he's attacking the children of God don't expect him to be brought he will always mix something with Christianity to bring it to you he will always season what he has with Christianity to bring it to you when I say Christianity your mind is always at the Pentecostal let's get to the message of the hour that's right okay let's go to Daniel 3. it is not correct the church is open and people are not in church something is wrong and they and they purposely will give you a correct reason but don't see that it's Satan that did that very good reason for you to stay don't come to church you can stream everybody okay you there let's go to Daniel chapter four first I'm sorry if you're there you can say Amen Daniel 4 verse 8. Hallelujah I want you to follow me carefully now verse 8 if you dare you can say Amen but at the last Daniel came in before me whose name was who So Daniel the king called him belches or betazar whatever way it's pronounced okay according to the name of my in whom is the spirit of holy and before him I thought the dream saying according to this verse amen King Nebuchadnezzar had a god everybody okay but he's God the name of his God was Bethesda which was the name that he gave to Daniel I don't know if you understand amen so the god of Nebuchadnezzar is a prophetic God I mean the message rank I don't know if you follow me so if you go see the god of Nebuchadnezzar you won't see a devil looking at you with uh with uh horn looking like this come on the god of Nebuchadnezzar when you see him is this your God it's Daniel I don't know if you get me the image of the appearance of the god of Nebuchadnezzar is Daniel but Daniel is a good man Daniel is a prophet let me bring it home Nebuchadnezzar said come let me show you my God he opened you see a big statute of brother Branham what are you gonna do what are you gonna do oh double Canada praise the Lord I see you caught the Revelation my friend glory to God Nebuchadnezzar huh let's go to chapter three let's go to chapter three if you dare you can say Amen chapter 3 verse 3. then the princes and the governor and Captain and the judges the treasurer and uh of the treasure Kama sorry the counselor I don't want to say ended the Bible didn't say end the sheriffs and all the rulers of the province were gathered together unto the dedication of the image you know that image now the king had water and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had water then in a Herald cried out to you it is commanded all people

it's a prophet music it's a prophet image it's a prophet God in Gold meaning deity now we can sing music that is worshiping the god of the prophet so since it's the prophetic music what do we do

morning my wife is there and I'm going to preach tomorrow so you good right so you should be strong right okay what is music what is music is what amen music involves everybody okay music involves a vocal amen and instrumental are you followed me vocal and instrumental sounds in other words music can be vocal everybody okay our music can be instrumental everybody okay both of them are music so music is either vocal or instrumental sounds everybody okay or a combination or a combination of both in other words music can be just vocal nothing else when we say vocal we're talking about the voice everybody okay everybody okay all music can be just pure instrumental a vocal only music is what they call acapella everybody okay I'm not gonna teach you musics listen here everybody okay music can be vocal which they call acapella amen all music can be instrumental only or a combination of vocal and instrumental together everybody okay and they are combined amen in such a way in such a way to produce everybody okay beauty of three things number one the beauty of form number two the beauty of Harmony and number three the beauty in expression of emotion what is music I we all together okay let me go back and explain it music is either vocal alone which they call acapella all music can be instrumental without vocal or music can be a combination of vocal and instrumental sounds the key here sounds amen that are mixed together in such a way that when you approach it it's gonna be beautiful in form beautiful in harmony and it brings an expression of emotions what is former form is what we call the type of music or degenerate of the music everybody okay what kind of music are you playing what kind of what what type of music are we playing everybody okay everybody good Now by Harmony Harmony means it's talking about the sounding how the sound are arranged together how they are consistent amen and then the expression of emotion expression of emotion happen in many highways the expression of emotion can be a joy he can bring you to worship amen it can make you cry everybody okay It Can Make You Dance amen it can make you praise or sometimes you feel like you need to lift up your head amen Etc all of this are expression of emotion in other words when music hit music can give you Joy when music hit music can make you sad music can bring you into worship you just hear it and the and and and and automatically you begin to give toward worship I want you to get this very good if you tired we hold and then I pump it next time everybody okay music can make you cry you play music and after a while you find yourself crying because that music is bringing something to you that will make you cry whether it's pulling old memories of a loved one that died and before you know it you begin to die I'll cry the reason why you're crying is because of music everybody okay music can make you lift up your hand it just hits you and before you know you there you will see somebody walking in the mall and sometimes music hit them and before you know it you see them going this way nobody taught them to this you don't understand the power you will see little kids going around sometimes they start they start breaking it down nobody told them it's just music hit them and then they begin to react a certain way or somebody sitting and go like this you wonder what is wrong with that let me read the William Marion Branham yeah I already got this one let me get this one yet this one brother random say this in the message testimony 1953 brother Branham say how many believe there is power in music there is some Churches don't believe in having music in the church well that's all right I won't argue with you in other words music gather power remember how many sources of power do we have everybody okay so music can be vocal but he have something on you it can be instrumental it can affect you or it can be a combination of vocal and instrumental it will affect you you have type a genre he arrange things in harmony so that the song sounds beautiful to you and at the end music will produce an emotion either you find yourself tapping your foot in the restaurant and then you stop you say Jesus you didn't know even how your foot was dancing don't say anything you just repent yourself everybody okay everybody okay you'll be driving a car and and you stop at the light and sometimes you go this way it's music doing that and somebody's looking at you like what is going on because somebody is listening to music yeah now that we understand music music you know what it means now can be written amen all printed that's why you you see some note looking like this have you seen things looking like this amen and you give it to somebody and when they look at this they begin to play it amen it is a written music amen it can be written it can be printed or music can be recorded amen music written all recorded amen glory to God get very careful because I'm gonna drop dead you remember you can learn a song right can I erase this a little bit we know what music is it can be vocal acapella or instrumental only or both reproduce sounds depending on the form or the tab they need to be in Harmony and when the Sun hits you something will happen to you everybody okay now we got the word vocal and instrumental let's start with vocal you there vocal in vocal music we talking about music that are expressed by words everybody call okay they are called lyrics everybody okay and in lyrics sometimes we call them in everybody okay or we call them son amen if you go in book of Psalm it is full with them everybody okay someone put some two from if you read you will see a music a masking of David all of that are music that are written I'm trying to skip some of this stuff everybody okay so vocal music is the music that goes by word everybody okay music vocal music can be sometimes non-linguistic foreign but is still vocal there is a religion in my country all the men are their shave their head and according to that religion all men shave heads they wear a white robe and they keep their beer and they don't use instrument yeah they don't use instrument he knows that all the instruments in the mouth and if you hear them you'll be amazed everybody okay one will be playing the drum with his mother I'm gonna go slowly one when they worship one will be

and say my God what is going on no instrument all of them vocal what happened everybody okay everybody okay so in the part of a vocal music you have words that are in the Book of Psalms I'm giving you

on you people [Applause] clap your hand clap your hand all you people I need to tell the Deacon when you see them standing like this get them a little bit I took you as a witness so whoever didn't

clap your hand it is not safe for the Lord thank you everybody okay everybody okay glory to God I don't know if I got this one let me see oh my God let me see if I get this one if I don't I can give it to you later amen praise be to the name of the Lord if you notice we're talking about instrumental what does clapping the hand is that instrument I have two coats brother Branham say I have an estimate of 10 strings which is the cupping of him [Applause] if you need that Court you see me so instrument can be animate with life or the trees with life can clap hand or estimate can be inanimate without rice everybody okay this instrument doesn't have life amen unless somebody touch it then we got music but there is no life to it everybody okay the instrument get the life of the player everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay we showed you in the Book of Revelation that even in heaven we have instruments in heaven we got instruments and we gave and happy and motherfucked the first instrument that was created in heaven was created in Lucifer [Applause] you understand music today do you understand music now musician do you understand music can be vocal or water the first instrumental music that was created was created in Lucifer let's go to Ezekiel Ezekiel 28. the time of confusion is over it hurt when you lay it out like this and the church is not there and tomorrow they struggle because somebody chose to cook today amen Ezekiel 28 verse 12 if you dare you can say Amen this is you know the scripture son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tariffs and say unto him the king of tariffs that saved the Lord God that sin is up the psalm 28 12. full of wisdom and perfect in water that has been in water and we know that this king of Paris was not in needed we already went through this it was Lucifer because Lucifer was the devil was he needed amen that has been in Eden the Garden of God every precious stone was that covering the Sergio stopes and the diamond and the burial are the the burial I'm sorry the Onyx and the Jasper the sapphire the immoral and the carbuncle and gold you there the workmanship of the Lucifer have a tablets and of die was prepared in in the day that was what so when God makes Lucifer he's making Lucifer with built in with instrument of music and we are in the edge of laodicea when Lucifer knows it's almost the end what do you think Lucifer will do do you think when Lucifer was cast down God took the instrument of Music away from him so why do you play with music singer why do you play with music I know I I see singers are not here tonight but I would not tolerate any foolishness everybody okay because I know the danger in music everybody okay Lucifer himself we are a church that looks like heaven this church we got African we got uh Caucasian we got African-American we got people from South America we got people from uh the Trinidad we got people from Jamaica all over we mixed together right here so everybody have their own music which music is right which music is right you see now which one is right that's why I'm going by the word and the word is able to go through every culture every country and not every music that is wrong because this is universal this doesn't have anything to do with your culture your civilization your community everybody care so the first sentiment started by who Lucifer do you see why music is dangerous now when God created the Earth he created Adam we don't see any instrument of music with Adam amen then from Adam the serpent entered and created and uh not created and brought forth the lineage of Cain where did music start in the earth who started with it let's go to Genesis 4. Genesis chapter 4. if you fall you stop and then we pick it up Genesis chapter 4. everybody okay Genesis chapter 4. you there you there let's go to verse 17. you there and who we already demonstrated in this church Ken was from the seed of what the devil amen why didn't Adam come up with music let's see who starred the music on the Earth in heaven Who start with instrument of music let's see on the earth who started with instrumental music verse 17 and Cain knew his wife and she conceived and bear who and he built a city and called the name of the city after he the name of his son Enoch and until Enoch was born Arad and Arad beget mahu jail and mahuja beget massuza and matthusia begatlamic and lamech took unto him how many wives that's where polygamy started a man with two wives the name of the one was Ada and the name of the other was zela and other bear who jabal he was the father of such as dwell in the water and of such as have water verse 21 and his brother's name was who Juba he was the father the beginning of all such as handed the water and water so the first two people that start using musical instruments in this Earth is from the lineage of Cain from the serpent seed lineage everybody okay everybody okay brother Stephen what do we do harp was in heaven we sin up with the 24 elders which were the Redeemer we see hope with the 144 000 which were the Redeemer do we need to play harp yes because remember the devil is not a Creator he's only a water remember from the beginning remember for the meeting okay so can we play organ that's why brother Branham say organ is the property of the church everybody okay so brother Stephen all instruments that we have are invented by the lineage of Satan anything let's go to First Chronicle 23. we are dealing with music first Chronicle first Chronicle chapter 23. glory to God first Chronicle chapter 23. I want you to write this down pretty good my friend and to remember when you write a scripture you put yourself a landmark you say this one is the lineage of Cain started in Sigma this so when you are looking for it you don't have to go opening the scripture you will remember quickly this goes with this this means this okay it's just uh a clue a little key okay okay uh first Chronicle chapter 23 you there we're trying to see if the lineage of Cain invented all instruments verse five if you're there you can say Amen maybe you never heard these things but you're gonna hear it today amen some of them you ready you ready when I say that I'm not saying about Kane but what I'm just about to read are you there moreover four thousand were what and four times indeed water with water the instrument which are said who so who made the instrument to do what to praise with him so David also invented the instrument I don't know if we're reading the same Bible David was not just a prophet David was not just a singer David was so I was also an inventor of musical instrument I just read it to you everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay let's go to chapter 15. chapter 15. yes same book first Chronicle 15. halleluia verse 16 you there and David spoke to the chief of the water leave that some people are flipping pages first Chronicle 15 we were at 23 we're going back to 15. and David's back to the chief of the liver to appoint their Brethren to be what who were single in the Old Testament do you see who a singer delivered to be single with instrument of what Karma what and and water and by lifting up the voice with water so when you singing for the Lord you must sing with joy [Applause] don't come here singing with sad we want Happy singer here singer that are singing like they're enjoying themselves [Applause] it is the Bible you sing for the Lord with joy suddenly there with joy backup singer with joy congregation with joy because the joy of the Lord is our [Applause] foreign you're not singing to us you're singing to who he wants you to sing with what like you the one that wrote the song you're singing like you the one that wrote this song everybody okay everybody okay the instruments were not only invented by the seed of the devil the Royal seed of Israel the land of Judah also invented instruments let's go to Amos chapter six how much you going toward the prophet so when you go up to Jeremiah Ezekiel you begin to go that one down there that's where you must find the Amos Amos 6 verse 5. glory to God Hallelujah we are still in instrumental my friend we just talk about vocal vocal words and non-linguistic we find mountain and trees and everything that have breath can produce music but instrumental it might be inanimate or it might be animate inanimate you got bunch of them here as long as there is no player nothing that's instrumental right there or you can have people clapping your hand we already talked about it tomorrow everybody clapping hands and everybody's singing with I wish the whole church was here so I don't have to repeat this thing amen Amos chapter 6 verse 5. if you dare you can say Amen somebody already seen it amen that chant to Sun to the sound of the water vile which is water and invent themselves as treatment of what like who [Music] so musical instrument has been invented by the lineage of God and the lineage of Satan just perverted it but we've seen that the harp was already in heaven because music started in heaven everybody okay everybody okay now let's see we calibrate now now music evolve vodka or instrumental vocal Elon acapella when the brother John say he does something like this to the musician and all the the instruments stop and then everybody is like the congregation now we vocal we are Capella then he gave a signal and then he start back up then we got vocal and instrumental Blended together both of them are music meaning if you want to worship God you don't have to know how to play instruments you can worship god with your voice and you can play a free instrument given to you by birth [Applause] yourself at home and you can dance yourself at home everybody okay free estimate free of charge you're born with it you are wired with it you are fabricated with it and if God fabricated you with instrument what does he expect from you [Applause] that's why at the beginning of on uh Ephesians 5 opposed say what go home and do what sing with him and spiritual song in your and Melody in your water you don't need instrument everybody okay everybody okay so we got vocal instrumental we have deformed the tab we didn't want it Harmony so it can sound good and the music have affected us it can even make your heart pound or make your heart go soft or make your leg move or whatever it's music can do that amen is he the written or it is recorded and by vocal we got words oh we got non-linguistic and by Instrumental it's something to have life or something that doesn't have life like a bunch of them here amen but now all of this vocal and instrumental are quality of Hallelujah everybody okay the danger of music amen the danger of music is laying in the sound because the word everybody can say Jesus everybody okay everybody okay no shake somebody's hand I usually like a church who's a love amen let everything that have breath everybody here have breakfast everybody okay everybody okay the danger of music is in the sound everybody okay everybody good okay read me this can you read me this clothes out is that a problem can you read it loud it is a water is that a problem did he offend anybody okay you take me a video our God is an awesome God send it everywhere in the world did I offend anybody where is the offense coming from everybody okay everybody okay singers everybody okay listen now our God is an awesome God he ran stop have I done everything wrong anything wrong have I offend you have I offend you okay let me sing it again our God is an awesome God he went from Heaven and Earth our garden Eddie offense any offense let me sing it again he spoken to the dark and indicated then light our God is an awesome God and the Lord wasn't happening in the kitchen he was another reason that he saved his life and he's talking when the father and they don't mean to be believing that our God is enough our God [Applause] [Laughter] let's go slowly let's go slowly let's go slowly let's go slowly did the word change what changed now did I offend you with the third one did I Stumble you [Applause] what do you want me to tell you again what do you want me to tell you about your song what else do you want me to tell you musician what else do you want me to tell you give brother John a break man amen I'm just showing you I can write to those words and you can read them and there is nothing wrong and the Lord was not when joking when he said is that a problem but when you sail and the Lord was not that's that's the problem that's where the problem comes but if I read oh the Lord was not joking is that a problem but if I tell you it's wrong you will fast with me because you will say the word are good you will fuss with me you will be offended somebody won't be talking to me anymore when they see me they put their face like this and it would take I don't know how many months before the change why because brother Stephen is the one who says this amen this is not a problem amen amen the psalm are written there's a bunch of songs in the book of song from 100 to from 1 to 150. none of them offend you but you can take those and and and couple them with sound the sound that is coming and the genre the type of music you try the the channel you're trying to take the song and channel them can twist your music and then it's no longer good why are we saying your music is bad the words are good Brothers even listen to the song I meant I'm telling you about this even some of the word he says is what brother Branham says I don't see what's the problem with the word brother say the same thing brother Branham says the same thing but that's not the problem the problem is what is the tune what is the Rhythm what is the Rhythm how many Amazing Grace did you hear Why didn't it stick with their original Amazing Grace we were fine with it but every time they have to come with an amazing grace they have to sing another amazing way they have to sing and before you know it Amazing Grace who was fun now Amazing Grace is now fasting Amazing Grace amazed finally how when can you leave amazing grace alone why because they are gauging all the young people need something take Amazing Grace and change it to the tune to the test of the young people of today so they will swallow Amazing Grace and when you come to me we're gonna start fasting again brother Stephen what is going on it's amazing grace I don't see what is wrong with Amazing Grace oh you want people to play music just like you or you want us to play country music hey come on amen country music they know what is secular and what is Christian in their country music they know they just knows amen that's right all of them they know they can tell this one no no no no the dad is reminding me when I was drinking beer but not this one not this one if they start playing it you'll be like man this is like when I was in the world he signed exactly the same way I was in the world hearing those and I come here what do you want my body to do my body have a memory they begin to remember what he was doing over there by your music the danger of the music is where why is the sand dangerous do you want me to continue why is the sun dangerous what makes the sound dangerous everybody okay everybody okay glory to God sounds you there carries everybody okay all contain messages everybody okay so a sound on its own have a message Sand by themselves I have a message let me start by the scripture because if I give you brother Brandon your head is still spinning let's start by the scripture let's go to First Corinthians chapter 14. ah glory to God First Corinthians chapter 14. now if somebody is not here he didn't hear this what are you going to do and you want to continue singing and tomorrow you're going to bring something here and then everybody's watching you like this everybody okay [Laughter] oh my God you there First Corinthians 14 verse 7. if you dare you can say Amen remember all my definition I gave you inanimate animate all of that remember all of them now everything is blending you there First Corinthians Chapter 14 verse 7 if you dare you can say Amen and even thinks without what remember inanimate right here remember inanimate it's What instrumental remember even things with that life giving water now trees don't need you amen birds Don't Need You because they have their own life everybody okay but thanks with that life needs somebody they need to borrow a life everybody okay everybody okay this guitar here is innocent depending to the borrower everybody okay the boy can play jazz right here the boy can pray hip-hop right now oh he can push heavy metal right here or the borrower can praise God right here so the instrument is just instruments it depends on the life of the player it depends on the life of the musician everybody okay the drum is nothing until Brother David play it when he played he can make that drum do anything everybody okay and you'll find your head spinning this way because the drum is playing everybody okay he said even things without Life Giving water sand wedder pipe or what different instrument except they give a water in the water so Paul is saying when we take the guitar and we start playing amen Paul is saying that it is not the guitar I don't know if you get me what Paul is saying is the musician the player the one who want to use or borrow the instrument have a message he have a thought he have something he will he's trying to say everybody okay now instead of saying it do you follow me he's using this tool to send his message I don't know if you're getting what I'm saying in other words when the guitar is playing it is not just playing it is it is it is expressing my thought because I can make this guitar play any kind of way if I'm a musician everybody okay if brother said sin here and he goes [Music] what do you think you got in your mind did he tell you anything did he say something why are you over there and say where did you learn it it's set telling you I want to sing Amazing Grace and he's singing not with word he's singing differently so Seth is talking with everybody okay that's the danger of rock and roll in other words there is a music Within the Music the word you using there has nothing there is something underneath amen that is coming with those words that is the true message the message was not our God it's an awesome God no the message was a rap music [Music] rap and rock and roll we want you to death rock and roll in the church we want you to worship God using rock and roll everybody okay your Eternal destination depends on what you and what you what are you hearing understand my friend when you look at Mavericks what are you hearing are you hearing beautiful voices are you reading worship when you sing What Do You See why do we fast verse 7. and even things without Life Giving sound Lord help me giving sound with a pipe or hype except they give a distinction in the how shall it be known what is or what so there is a message that is piped or there is a message that is hard or there is a message that is played out everybody care verse 8 for if the trumpet give a water in other words that that instrument have a message who shall prepare himself for water in other words when the sun they trumpet it doesn't mean really sound the man who's hearing the trumpet is trying to decode is this war or is this Jubilee it is not just a sound it is a message everybody okay everybody okay what is played for if the bird are singing music what are they doing let me read something from brother brother you there let me read something from brother brother I'm going to read something amen glory to God Hallelujah in the message earnestly contending for the faith in 1954. brother Branham say paragraph one good morning friend I am so happy to be here this morning seeing everybody looking fresh and nice so when I tell you you look nice on Sunday don't make it fast on this fine Julie spring morning even the bird seeing lovely today Amen brother Branham I will certainly amazed when I walk in to heal the brother I have heard of him and he gave me some record there was a brother that I was singing was sent to me this week and now to hear the gospel preach in bird language can I read it again brother Branham say even the birds sing lovely today I will certainly amazed when I walk in to heal the brother I have heard of him and he gave me some record was sent to me this week and now to hear the gospel preach in bird language well maybe that is what the bird are doing when they are singing like that preaching the gospel to us [Applause] [Music] can you say Amen Amen in other words the birds that are singing they have a message they are pretty brother Branham said the birds are preaching the gospel to us that's why brother Branham say his first Bible was what everybody okay everybody okay so when sand goes the danger of music sound contain or carries messages everybody okay we were on verse 10 our job to verse 10. on First Corinthians 14. if you're there you can say Amen they are there are it may be so many kind of water in the water and none of them is without what in other words nobody say just things like that right amen even our I had a patient they came from a certain country in Asia and the patient brought their father and I have to speak in English and they are translating and when I hear the translation it looks like they're repeating the same sound and the other one goes and I'm like is this really language but they are interpreting and the other one is understanding but if I hear this it sounds like you want to hear like Jesus Christ the same yesterday no you don't hear any word all you hear is I'm like what is that but they're saying something that's what Paul is saying there is no voices with that significance in other words even when you don't understand have a meaning that's why speaking in tongues come in play because somebody would say yes you don't understand but when The Interpreter comes he says here you are my people I am the Lord so and so did something bad but when you hear that one you don't understand because there is no voices without significance amen everybody okay verse we were in 10 verse 11. therefore if I know not the meaning of the I shall be unto him that speaketh a water and he that speaking shall be a word unto who job to verse 15. we're talking about music you there what is it then I will pray with the water and I will pray with the water watch the next one I will do what with the water and I will sing with the water so somebody can be singing in the spirit and if he's singing the spirit who's singing if you're singing with understanding this is when we stand here we're using under our understanding we're singing we know the song We memorize the song that's why we're singing but in the spirit it's not you it is the spirit who's doing water say anything words sounds God messages let's go to Psalm 49. Lord help me I don't know I'm gonna try to rush Psalm 49 if you dare you can say Amen sorry brother Robert I finished this one please Psalm 49 you dare you can say Amen verse 4 are you there I will incline my ear to a water I will open my dark saying upon the Water so how is David speaking in other words David is wanna say something but he doesn't want to say it he want to use Parable he want to use dark saying he want to conceal his message and in order to ignore the word for him to speak a message without you getting what he's saying David is saying I'm gonna use my instrument and just keep doing like this you are hearing sound but to David he's saying something thank you my brother David is saying something but you don't heal the world but David knows exactly what he's saying with the harp the guitar he's playing is not guitar the guitar is saying something David say I will say things I'm gonna use a parable but I'm not going to use a word Parable I'm not going to use a word a conceal word Parable I'm gonna use a musical Parable I'm gonna speak in Parable using music and those music are not verbal they're not vocal and you want to hear it instrumental but instrumentally saying something let me read this William Branham amen testimony 1953. what about them say if I tell brother read here you go tell a certain man a certain things that will be me sending a message and some of us are born friends to be Preacher Brother read many other some of us are born to be musician I noticed that young lady tonight bidding on those things he exalophone playing the organ piano why I don't know nothing about that why I would not know if he was in tune or Out Of Tune I couldn't tell it God never sent me to play music but I was born a seer everybody okay now they play the music for the glory of God you following me that is the way of preaching the gospel praying the music is preaching the gospel why the sound got a message everybody okay brother Branham continue he say the man preaches it by the word and my way is by vision won't you believe all the witnesses that God has sent you can't you know that God in them song when you sing that something blesses your soul another coat it is I Be not Afraid 1954 paragraph four here we just love good singing good singing and we are very grateful for these men who are with us and for sister shakarian the other singers the musician and so forth to bring us the gospel in the way of singing and in music everybody okay may the Lord richly bless you I have always said when I get to heaven I sure want to get around where there is singing that is where the place that I want to be so right here music carries a message Muses music preaches the gospel everybody okay if music preaches the gospel the Bible say I send my word and my word did what my forward did what if music also preaches the word so music can also do what everybody okay everybody okay you remember David and so when an evil spirit came on so David was doing water and when he prayed what happened to Saul why is the devil running away from a plane somebody get here and begin to do this and the devil ran out everybody okay one time there was a sister playing and the anointing hit the system and the Sister Rose and begin to praise the Lord and they turn around and they saw the piano go in Iran singing The Great physician and brother Branham said he was the angel of the Lord that sat down and begin to play music [Music] in the message foreign he says I have a record that was made during that meeting I'm skipping stuff when I kind of get a feeling a little down I'll go play This Record and it's a bad scratch out brother Branham say there was a brother that played a record music and they recorded yes okay brother John was playing here and somebody recorded and they sent it to brother Branham and brother Branham say every time he fell down he would take that tape and go play it around everybody okay why brother Brandon say I go play This Record and it's a bad scratch out in other words he played it over and over he said perhaps may be the man that made it is here this morning little red flexible record and then of course I have many of the late record of this young choir whoever don't want quiet here which was leader babies then singing We Get Much out of it when we hear these fine songs I say to brother Allah I'm glad they have been they have been taped because I like to study that I like to hear those song and play the tapes hear the songs when you can set down why brother Branham he says there is nothing like music you know God heals by music did you know that God heals by music sometimes when you feel all down as we call it a strict expression down in the dumps just put on those put on one of those tips that music or a record and go to playing it the first thing you know you are patting your foot all your hand and it's all over then you are rad up and ready to go again why because God healed by God also delivers by music let's go to Acts chapter 16. I still have a lot to render I have to put another meeting you're getting loaded I don't want to overload you and you lose focus buddy Kelly we will call this part one then we need to do part two you already enjoy it today you miss the next time good luck everybody okay so when they send a message they want to know who will be there please put your time up no don't be expecting waiting to see how many people will say it before you say it just be free in this church we're free Express Yourself amen acts 16 verse 23 and probably I'm going to stop somewhere here yeah because uh oh my God we are still here buddy we are here we we finish here we are here so we got this so these are all scriptures so let's uh wait so my friend doesn't speed over okay okay uh uh where we are at 16 23 if you there you can say Amen are you there and when they had laid many straps upon who they took Paul in silence beat them big them beat them beat them amen and the magistrate to rent off their clothes oh sorry they cast them into prison charging the Jailer to keep them how who having received such a charred trust them into the water not even at the beginning in the inner and made their feast their their feet fast in the water so not only are they put in the inside prison they also put them in stock something like feathers so in other words even inside the prison you unlock even if they open the prison you are still locked they have to come and unlock you that's what the devil do to you sometimes he locked you on the in the in the body and in the inner lock lock until you feel stuck you don't want to talk to nobody you don't want to see nobody you want to tell everybody get out everybody okay and at midnight you remember midnight there is always a cry in Midnight a minute roof Paul and Silas prayed so during the day they were sitting pirate maybe talking man wow disgusting are you okay yeah yeah yeah man you heard it over here then at midnight they put everything down say parcellus let's pray man they pray Karma and there's water [Music] stop did they have any instrument acapella acapella or maybe they were using the feathers and gold Salas let's go click click click click click click click click and I was singing everybody okay oh they go silence let's go we're gonna show that devil even in feathers our mouth are not bound even in a hospital with a profession going on my mouth is burned it's not bounded everybody okay because they tell you don't move it's like a feather it's a it's it's a modern feather everybody okay and a midnight Paul and Silas prayed indeed what Sun Praises unto who unto God and the Prisoner did water so they were singing how everybody okay and suddenly there was a great water so that the foundation of the prison were what and immediately all the doors were water and everyone bends where water what did this what did this with that estimate praises amen open the prison doors your voice praising God goes to a natural door and the lock say and not only does he open the lock the lock itself move and the dog goes and the Sharks say who put me here on the floor by music if a praise music can make you do this what a bad music will do to you everybody okay if if a good music can take the devil out a bad music do to you do you see how many women lose their virginity just like that do you know how many young men find themselves drinking alcohol because you put yourself in the nightclub and that sink is running before you know it you lost control whatever is going on you just rolling in before you know it Lord I'm sorry what about if you contracted a woman that have AIDS everybody okay what caused that why in the nightclub they have to play a music a certain way they have to increase the music a certain way why do they have to play louder because Paul and Silas were playing loud why are they also day playing loud because the more loud that they are using it the more they abandon the People by the devil before you know it when they come up there they like a bunch of fools they can do anything they can shoot anybody the sister that was shy is no longer shy from the nightclub [Music] she said I never drunk I never drank whiskey but by the time she's leaving the nightclub she already finished a bottle music will make you do that you think everybody okay let's finish it up and suddenly there was a great day of good and all of them and The Keeper of the prison awaken out of sleep and seeing the prison doors plural open he drew out he saw that would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners had been watered what did this the message that we stop with tonight sounds is where the danger of music is because sounds carry messages sand have something to do everybody okay I'm gonna seal with this let me put a Mark here so we will pick it up here let's go to Exodus 32 and we pray because I don't want to leave something here and then next time need to catch it up Exodus 32 and we pray if I continue we will go seven hours so we need to stop it's not an easy music a subject it's a big one I have to approach it this way so you understand the music and but I believe with what you already got now we should be not having any problem anymore you should be watching your singer special singer what kind of song you're bringing here whether in the message or outside the message whatever suggestion you're trying to bring you should check it yourself because as we go down the road I need to get in the musician themselves this is music that we need to get in musician amen what is a problem with musician amen so uh Exodus 32 if you dare you can say Amen let's go to verse 17. you there Joshua and Moses are up in the mountain and as they're coming down something happened you there verse 17 and when Joshua heard the water noise of the water as they did what see he say unto Moses there is a noise of water in the water all day he is somebody put an ear and said that's War why because noise sound have a now they're trying to decode what is the sound of your music you will increase your lust by the music you are listening and you find yourself struggling with certain spirit because of the kind of music you're listening it's a slow music it is like Godly music but it's like a music of love and when you listen to that music it's God but it's like they're singing to a lover and before you know it you are inclining your body into something while the singer that sang it have a message that he put in the Sun and that's what is affecting you but the musket with Godly word and you find yourself kissing somebody amen amen I don't want to get into a lot of stuff let me stay away because there is strange stuff message Believers are doing especially the young one that get married the circle kind of stuff they think we don't have fun they think our marriages are boring they have a good marriage they want to do stuff in their marriage to show the old that you didn't have fun bringing demonic spirit in your marriage and before you know it your husband is suffering lust one day you will open his phone filled with pornography the husband of yours that baby that doesn't want to come to church every time there is something for churches that's the time he's going to find something baby baby baby baby out wait I'm a person I just sit quiet until I hear a phone call I say no problem just as expected then I would turn to you and say you trying to show him love this is what you got amen Verse 18 and he said Joshua talk to Moses and he said Moses there is war Moses being a prophet put the Sun there is one noise I'm gonna finish there is one noise there's two people amen amen there is one noise there is one song everybody okay the first brother that heard the song say it's okay everybody okay the next brother come and put his ear to the same song who should be judging song ah Jesus you want me to trust you to judge some what about if you make a mistake because your judgment goes with how much God you have you're already struggling you're struggling in your life you're struggling praying you're struggling being in church you're struggling being in question and answer you never come in question and answer and how can you judge a song how can I take such a big responsibility with a lot of risk like this in the age of laodicea and give it to you to judge it no brother no I don't trust you good but the one behind you there that therefore there I have zero confidence with him because I can't give you a gun at this age you will shoot your friend at school everybody okay because when you get here you will try to please the young people when they say this is the good one and the young sister goes like this and then tomorrow you you are now praying to and and your mind is geared toward what am I going to do to please them now you are in a different Channel when the spirit of God is going different the spirit of the Lord is trying to give you a song to match the word I won't get to that I will show you the order of the song in service two people listening to One noise let's finish it and he said Moses it is not the voice of them that shout for what neither is he the voice of them that cry for being what but the noise of them that do what do I what how can Joshua hear a song and Joshua is saying it is war and mumbosis come and say give me that he put like this say Joshua I don't hear yeah I don't hear that this is people enjoying war was in Joshua that he missed he was under training because later on God told him as I was with so will that be with her there was something in Moses in Allah in a higher level recognize Where You Are and be humble if we say brother stay away this is not good trust me as a pastor it takes maybe time for you to begin to catch the different noises you might be able to catch on the war war because Joshua was a warrior he sees War all the time everybody okay sometimes you need a backup from the pastor to back you up and say no no no no no no no Joshua pulled the sword back ah don't be quickly toward the soul this is not war something is going on in the camper what you hear is not really the the discernment that you have in what you see and what you verse 19 and he came to pass as soon as he came nigh unto the water that he saw the water and the what and Moses anger was water what was going on in the camp idolatry in the camp with music with dances idolatry this were not hidden doing that it is message believer a message believer that are doing this the message of the hour and the Moses this is message believer doing this and then Moses when he healed he said no something is wrong this is singing what are they singing who are they praising over there or they're dancing for who amen amen amen amen noises song Kerry's message the song that was going there was a worship of a false god he was a rebellion toward Jehovah and then the worship of another God and you came with a worship and with singing and with dances we stop here let me recapital it we talk about music today we went with two kingdoms two King zombies two power it means two forces it means two sources it's either God or it's either the devil God is the one who stood he's the original the devil is not a Creator he always pervert he takes what God have done and he perverted to something wrong and because of two sources we got two kind of music we got a Godly which is divine which is church which is worship which is Christian which according to Ephesians 5 it is a spiritual music all we got a satanic which is a worldly music or secular music which goes according to the book of First John all that is in the world is the last of the flesh the last of the eyes and the pride of life that is the characteristic of worldly music it's either for Pride or it's talking about last or a woman a woman taking clothes off for a woman sexy all of that the last of the flesh the last of the eyes and the pride of life that is what is in that music and God is in music but it must be the right one God is in dancing it must be the right one God is in chatting we must do the right thing and both God and Satan look for worshiper for followers God we found if you want to worship him it must be in spirit and it must be in truth Satan doesn't care as long as you bow down to him he can give you all the glory of this world you can be the most popular woman around the message or in the chat of the message young people you're going to find yourself in trouble in those uh feast or banquet or something because you're trying to please all the people amen everybody okay we need to know which age that we are living in what is the condition of the age we are in the most deceptive age of everything according to Matthew 24 24 it would deceive even the elect if it was possible it's the age of laodicea it's either it's not cold no hot hot means god code is the certain but it's an age of lukewarmness where they make something and your discernment is important on what you see or what you hear turn the volume off look at the clip that you're seeing what do you see according to Paul all things must be done decently and how in order because God is not the author of what confusion Church must keep order all the time and what is music music involves vocal itself called acapella or instrumental itself or a combination of both and those are sounds that are combined to produce something that is good good in form which is the top or the genre or in harmony which is the arrangement how they put the music together and it will bring an expression of emotion either Joy or sadness or dance or Praises or lifting up of hand worship or make you cry music can be written printed or music can be recorded the first one that David did is in first chronicles 16 verse 7. by vocal we got words call us on lyric sometimes they call emnam song or we got non-linguistic we find bird to do that we find Mountain Hills and even trees instrumental we got animate things things that have life let's everything that have breath praise the Lord inanimate things that don't have life we already went to that the danger of music is the Sun what is the Sun what is the genre what is the tap of the music that is coupled with the song the song will have the religious word but the Rhythm the sound is the problem because that sound carry a message any question let's stand now the gospel can be preached by music and music can heal music can cast our devil music can deliver our everything okay what you already have today you should be able to look at music Ian backup singer I see some of you are not here tonight before you put a special that's why just as Joshua and Moses there was a difference in discernment that's the reason why we ask you submit your music ahead of time don't send the music as at 10 45 so you can bypass the customer okay so we don't have time to check it and then you send the music in the morning I want to sing no we don't want that brother John just kick it out leave it alone you put that for the next service send your music ahead of time let us view your music I have to be protective because I have responsibility of souls I'm not trying to be legalistic but church gather older we don't want anything coming up here because it's a danger amen amen so send your music before it's going to go through the song leader he's right here the next song leader is ready the herd must stand where I'm standing the scene where I'm coming from in the message that's the standard that we have for this church my standard is not Congolese tender that don't have Congolese standard for this church I only have word standard and that word goes to every culture everywhere I can release this and it can go to everywhere and it will match every culture so that is the standard it's the word so if you send your music and the song leaders say no no no no we don't feel like this need to be played please we don't want to fast sometimes he can look he say yes we can play this but please change this tune remove this we want you to play it this way just because we don't want you to convey a wrong message if everything is good he say go ahead and play go ahead and play everybody okay everybody okay so whoever is not here who want to sing if you hear them talking or chatting or calling you tell them what happened we got the scripture let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly again father tonight Lord thanking you for your grace for your love and your mercy because myself I am amazed with the things that you spoke tonight I wish I was sitting myself and taking note Lord because the things the way they come you have nothing to do with me it is you who has been uh gracious to us and who have pity upon us to be able to unfold to us father the danger that was in this message Father I know many people many churches are struggling trying to find a balance with this thing and it create a lot of friction a lot of tension until there is a lot of misunderstanding about it but father we thank you that we can all hide just behind the world nothing else but the word until we can discern by the word what is good and what is unacceptable and what is a good service unto thee father strengthen your children and help me Lord we got service in the morning Lord you see the great sacrifice they have done they could be somewhere else but father they came here you tonight in respect to your word Lord father may you bless them and reward them and may the Holy Spirit come down and father continue to lead the musician and this church so that everything we will be doing here will be pleasing on today because it's your promise you will have an Ephesian church back again a church that will end up being without spot and wrinkle father protect us as we go into our respective place be with us and bless us in Jesus precious name amen thank you church for your sacrifice and your presence God bless you brother Robert would you please help me get a screenshot of this so I will keep it before because we might use it tomorrow it's back and forth fall uh did we send the message about the time changing please if we can send one we will lose one hour for the last time in the morning it will go like one hour back this is number one this is number two thank you and this is a number three and number four but Robert I put it up one and two three four
