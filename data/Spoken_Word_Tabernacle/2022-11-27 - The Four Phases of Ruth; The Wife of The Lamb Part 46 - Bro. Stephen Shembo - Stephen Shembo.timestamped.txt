[36:03] morning about putting the flesh back on
[36:06] the bones and the sinews and
[36:08] brother Seth amen amen amen amen
[36:14] amen um just say uh something short
[36:17] before the song man um
[36:20] just a little um
[36:23] background to the inspiration to this
[36:25] song Amen
[36:27] I believe the Lord is doing so much in
[36:30] this church amen it's not just a man
[36:33] speaking to us a man but the holy spirit
[36:36] is looking for Avenues to express
[36:38] himself amen when the word of God is
[36:41] coming out the prophet said that it
[36:43] comes with manifestations the man so the
[36:46] Lord is looking for so many Avenues in
[36:48] US Amen to manifest himself amen so it
[36:52] depends on us to get ourselves ready and
[36:55] then sanctify and then consecrated amen
[36:58] so um
[37:01] brother John song sung a song a man that
[37:04] um
[37:05] I said um
[37:08] soft Nintendo Jesus is Calling amen and
[37:12] then the inspiration um
[37:14] afterwards after that song he said I am
[37:17] coming Lord amen so we sang this song on
[37:20] a Wednesday and then when I went to
[37:22] sleep that night the lord gave me this
[37:25] song Amen it's a song of Deliverance
[37:28] amen but then I I saw myself
[37:32] been delivered amen but but the song was
[37:35] just thank you Lord thank you Jesus
[37:38] thank you Lord and and that's the whole
[37:40] song Amen so I woke up and then I I try
[37:43] to add some words to it but it just
[37:45] couldn't fit amen that the Lord just
[37:47] wanted me to keep it that simple amen
[37:49] amen so it is
[37:52] just thank you Jesus thank you Lord amen
[37:55] amen
[37:59] thank you thank you thank you
[38:04] Jesus thank you Lord
[38:09] thank you thank you thank you
[38:15] Jesus thank you Lord
[38:20] thank you thank you thank you
[38:25] Jesus thank you Lord
[38:30] thank you thank you thank you
[38:36] Jesus thank you Lord that's the whole
[38:39] song Amen
[38:41] thank you thank you thank you
[38:47] Jesus thank you Lord
[38:51] thank you thank you thank you
[38:57] Jesus thank you Lord

[47:16] if you're there you can say a man amen
[47:19] amen we already talked about Adam In the
[47:22] Flesh now we went back up to the spirit
[47:25] amen because it's very easy to
[47:28] understand the difference in the flesh
[47:29] when they say it's a male and a woman no
[47:31] problem we know what it is but when we
[47:34] come up in the spirit then it's a
[47:36] different story go to see your big eagle
[47:38] amen God bless you
[47:42] Genesis 1 26.
[47:45] are you there
[47:47] and God saved
[47:50] who said God
[47:54] amen
[47:56] do you see that God plural
[47:59] wow do you see God with finesse
[48:05] but he's not alone
[48:09] amen
[48:11] God is singular
[48:15] amen glory to God God is singular
[48:21] it is not plural it's a different
[48:23] language amen
[48:26] amen and God said comma let water us how
[48:31] can a singular be us
[48:34] you might be seated
[48:36] so that God is Not singular as you think
[48:41] God Is Us
[48:45] and brother Branham say that he is
[48:48] plural
[48:50] amen even the very word the Elohim
[48:55] amen is plural
[48:58] but Elohim means the one who existed by
[49:01] himself
[49:02] how can be the one existing by himself
[49:05] be plural
[49:09] amen glory to God Amen
[49:13] he say let us make man in our water
[49:18] image so whoever is talking here want to
[49:23] make man that look like him
[49:27] everybody okay
[49:30] uh glory to God
[49:33] amen
[49:35] are you ready to chew grown up food now
[49:40] amen
[49:41] that's going to give you rupturing faith
[49:47] amen
[49:49] glory to God he said whoever is here
[49:56] the US
[49:58] decided to make man that look like us
[50:05] okay let's let's go this way
[50:09] This Is Us
[50:12] this is the god that is here this God Is
[50:17] Us
[50:18] okay
[50:19] now this God here decided to make
[50:23] something
[50:25] that looked like him
[50:29] everybody okay
[50:31] amen so in this way out of this God
[50:37] came up something that looked
[50:43] look like this one
[50:45] amen
[50:47] because this thing must be in the image
[50:51] of this
[50:53] and not only the image but even the
[50:56] likeness
[50:57] even the texture of it
[51:00] in other words when you touch this one
[51:02] and you touch this one you are confused
[51:05] tomorrow
[51:11] glory to God Amen Let us make man and
[51:17] this person here they call him man
[51:23] is man singular or plural
[51:28] no look at the way it's written singular
[51:31] singular was God plural no
[51:34] so this God here created man
[51:39] singular
[51:43] amen but we know when God was singular
[51:47] he was not really singular
[51:51] are we okay so if he created man
[51:54] singular this man cannot really be
[51:57] singular
[51:58] the Oneness of God is something
[52:01] different than our brain
[52:04] amen amen in our brain we learn in
[52:07] school one plus one equal two
[52:12] foreign
[52:16] let us make man in our image
[52:20] in our not in my image in hour so it's
[52:25] more than one person
[52:27] and in our likeness so there is no one
[52:30] God there
[52:32] there is one God
[52:35] but there is not one God
[52:43] I hope I can reach where I'm heading so
[52:48] you'll see who you are
[52:50] amen
[52:52] amen because that's the problem with the
[52:55] brother
[52:56] amen
[52:58] [Music]
[53:00] once you know who you are you don't have
[53:02] to copy somebody
[53:06] you will be satisfied the Way You Are
[53:11] if they tell you you the most handsome
[53:13] do you want to copy somebody else
[53:21] they say you're the most beautiful do
[53:23] you want to copy somebody else no which
[53:24] Beauty again are you gonna get if you
[53:26] the most
[53:28] oh Jesus
[53:30] [Music]
[53:33] glory to God Amen
[53:37] and
[53:39] let them
[53:42] so the man
[53:44] even though it's written singular he is
[53:48] them God even though he's singular He Is
[53:52] Us
[53:56] amen
[54:00] so the man is plural when you start
[54:04] touching things like this thank God I
[54:06] have the Bible
[54:07] because if I have if I didn't have the
[54:09] Bible I would have a hard time preaching
[54:12] this kind of stuff
[54:13] but you can't fight me because it's in
[54:15] the scripture
[54:18] because the message is perfectly in line
[54:22] with the scripture
[54:24] that's why you cannot fight the message
[54:27] when you're fighting the message you
[54:28] fighting the very scripture
[54:36] let them
[54:39] amen so whoever is this is in in here
[54:45] whoever is inside here is them
[54:49] everybody okay and the vamp that is here
[54:52] have some benefit
[54:56] everybody okay
[54:59] he said let them have water Dominion

[55:42] [Applause]
[55:44] everybody okay
[55:45] so make sure you adjusting them
[55:49] if you are in them
[55:52] so you are born with potential
[55:55] [Applause]
[55:58] amen your heart is not a problem
[56:04] whether you show it like this the
[56:07] problem is where did you come out

[56:32] giant what was in the boy
[56:38] what was that boy seeing
[56:40] [Applause]
[56:42] what did that boy know
[56:48] everybody okay
[56:51] so God singular
[56:54] created man singular
[56:57] in his singular
[57:02] are we okay
[57:03] on the image singular
[57:06] in the image singular of God singular
[57:12] created he singular him singular male
[57:18] and female
[57:20] plural
[57:22] [Applause]
[57:23] so whoever is inside we already went
[57:27] through this we're just picking it up so
[57:29] whoever is in this side here there is a
[57:32] male
[57:33] and a female
[57:37] they are together
[57:39] they are moving together if you take the
[57:41] female out
[57:43] this man is incomplete
[57:47] everybody okay
[57:50] if you don't understand this you will
[57:52] not understand what is coming up
[57:54] everybody okay if you take the mail out
[57:57] this man is incomplete
[58:03] everybody okay
[58:05] created he them
[58:08] so you can see it it's like a Oneness
[58:10] and then finally split up again
[58:14] and when you want to catch it it goes
[58:16] back to Oneness again
[58:19] because quickly you will begin Trinity
[58:22] then it goes back again
[58:24] and he hide again then you say yes it's
[58:27] one God then he comes up too
[58:30] you know
[58:31] beautiful
[58:36] the Lord your God is
[58:41] but the God Is Us
[58:48] that's why you need the prophet
[58:51] [Applause]
[58:53] verse 28 and God singular
[58:58] bless them
[59:01] and God said to them
[59:04] do what be fruitful
[59:08] do you have to worry about producing
[59:10] fruit no
[59:12] no no
[59:15] do you need a fertilizer on you no
[59:21] you see how we're wasting our time in
[59:23] prayer
[59:25] he said Lord please send some fertilizer
[59:28] for what
[59:30] [Applause]
[59:32] [Music]
[59:34] do you know that Jacob was already
[59:36] blessed by Isaac
[59:39] you know that right Isaac bless him
[59:42] thinking that it was Esau right when he
[59:46] met the angel of the Lord he was asking
[59:48] for what else again
[59:49] for blessing which blessing
[59:52] did you see the angel blessing him again
[59:54] and saying oh Jacob I'm blessing you the
[59:58] second time do you see the angel
[1:00:00] blessing him the angel just changed his
[1:00:03] name
[1:00:04] [Applause]
[1:00:06] amen
[1:00:07] [Laughter]
[1:00:12] Oh Glory to God
[1:00:15] he said be fruitful and do what multiply
[1:00:20] and do what so who's responsible to
[1:00:23] replenish the Earth man
[1:00:27] this man they're telling him to be
[1:00:30] fruitful
[1:00:32] be fruitful
[1:00:34] and what else my brother multiply and
[1:00:37] multiply and what else replenish the
[1:00:40] Earth
[1:00:41] and what else
[1:00:43] do it
[1:00:47] I'm reading just the Bible
[1:00:50] and subdue it and what else have
[1:00:52] dominion over
[1:00:54] you know I have water Dominion
[1:00:56] off the over the water fish
[1:01:00] in the Thousand Years everybody okay so
[1:01:03] we back up here so we got one two three
[1:01:06] four this include everything five six
[1:01:09] seven eight
[1:01:12] amen he said have dominion over the
[1:01:16] future of the sea and over the fall of
[1:01:19] the air and of every living thing that
[1:01:21] moves upon the Water
[1:01:24] that's man in Genesis 1.
[1:01:30] Genesis 1
[1:01:33] 26-28 this is man
[1:01:37] we okay
[1:01:39] we okay so this man moved from Genesis 1
[1:01:43] to Genesis 2.
[1:01:48] amen
[1:01:50] he moved to Genesis 2 7.
[1:01:54] amen
[1:01:56] and when he moved to Genesis 2 7 he
[1:01:59] appeared to be alone
[1:02:02] he appeared to be singular
[1:02:07] everybody okay
[1:02:08] and God said he's singular let me pull
[1:02:12] his brother out but to pull his Brad God
[1:02:16] goes in here
[1:02:19] not outside in here and take the blood
[1:02:22] from there and pull it
[1:02:26] so this man was not really singular
[1:02:30] he was also double in the body
[1:02:35] the body of Eve was inside of Adam
[1:02:40] is that complicated
[1:02:42] so in the body he was also
[1:02:48] that's why he's x y
[1:02:51] that's easy amen
[1:02:53] let's go to Genesis 5.
[1:02:58] we need to know his name
[1:03:03] amen glory to God Genesis 5 verse 1.
[1:03:08] it's a nice day the rain stopped here
[1:03:11] it's cold it's Sunday we don't have two
[1:03:14] services so let's relax
[1:03:17] amen so this is the book of the
[1:03:22] generations of who Adam
[1:03:24] where did that name come from
[1:03:26] in the day that God created hook man
[1:03:30] singular in the likeness of who God
[1:03:33] singular made his singular him singular
[1:03:38] again God open up again
[1:03:41] he said verse 2 male and female created
[1:03:45] he them plural
[1:03:47] and bless them plural
[1:03:50] and call Dare plural name water Adam
[1:03:56] so now we're not just talking about men
[1:03:58] men we're talking about Adam
[1:04:05] So Adam is not the man
[1:04:10] Adam is man and woman
[1:04:15] this woman her name is Adam
[1:04:18] this man his name is Adam
[1:04:23] because when we say Adam and Eve then we
[1:04:26] got confused no no no no no no no the
[1:04:28] original name that God gave to Eve was
[1:04:32] not ease
[1:04:34] the name that came from God was Adam
[1:04:40] so you have two two ways to accept if
[1:04:44] you want the call if you want to be
[1:04:46] called Eve or you want to be called Adam
[1:04:49] depending on what you want but Eve has
[1:04:52] trouble
[1:04:53] it means you can birth anything
[1:04:59] is the mother of everything
[1:05:03] so do you want to be called Eve
[1:05:09] are we okay now
[1:05:13] they say and he called their name Adam
[1:05:17] in the day when they were water created
[1:05:20] let's go to Jeremiah
[1:05:23] these staff are stuff that we cannot
[1:05:26] Rush with them
[1:05:28] yeah brother Branham even says in one
[1:05:30] place in the adoption he said this kind
[1:05:32] of sermon are not Evangelistic
[1:05:37] where we run quickly
[1:05:40] disposition you
[1:05:42] open your eyes change your thinking
[1:05:46] and make you know who you are and you
[1:05:49] begin to behave differently
[1:05:52] that's right without any sensation
[1:05:55] when you really get it that's when the
[1:05:57] sensation comes
[1:05:59] the sensation come after you get it
[1:06:06] Jeremiah 1. verse 4.
[1:06:09] glory to God
[1:06:12] amen
[1:06:15] this man is a spirit we all know this
[1:06:20] and this man is in the body he's human
[1:06:24] he's natural
[1:06:26] amen
[1:06:29] amen
[1:06:31] glory to God so before if you meet Adam
[1:06:38] and you talk to him you really have not
[1:06:41] seen Adam
[1:06:44] you are looking at the house
[1:06:47] or the shell or the envelope
[1:06:51] or the car
[1:06:53] that Adam is using but Adam is really
[1:06:57] inside there
[1:07:00] amen that's why Paul said if this
[1:07:03] Tabernacle
[1:07:05] we have water
[1:07:07] so we just flip cars
[1:07:12] amen that's why brother Branham said
[1:07:15] death is a vehicle
[1:07:17] you're just switching car
[1:07:19] and they show you a different Highway
[1:07:22] everybody Okay we okay so this man is an
[1:07:27] envelope he said to him that's where
[1:07:29] this man is
[1:07:32] Jeremiah 1 verse 4 if you dare you can
[1:07:35] say amen amen
[1:07:37] the word of the who Lord
[1:07:42] so who's speaking the Lord the word of
[1:07:46] the Lord came to me Jeremiah saying God
[1:07:51] come to talk to Jeremiah
[1:07:53] what is God trying to tell Jeremiah
[1:07:57] amen
[1:07:58] God said
[1:08:01] before I form you
[1:08:05] in the belly
[1:08:07] added water
[1:08:09] why is this important to Jeremiah
[1:08:14] why is it important
[1:08:16] why
[1:08:17] [Applause]
[1:08:19] God is saying
[1:08:21] Jeremiah
[1:08:23] before Genesis 2 7
[1:08:27] .
[1:08:28] we okay
[1:08:30] me and you were in Genesis 1 26.
[1:08:39] you are already in Genesis 2 7. it's a
[1:08:44] problem
[1:08:45] but to help your problem I need to take
[1:08:48] you from Genesis 2 7.
[1:08:52] because in Genesis 2 7 there is nothing
[1:08:56] pretty much new
[1:08:57] the blessing
[1:08:59] the Dominion were given in Genesis 1 26.
[1:09:04] so if you don't know what happened in
[1:09:07] Genesis 1 26
[1:09:09] you will not understand how you need to
[1:09:11] behave in Genesis 2 7.
[1:09:16] so I watch you Jeremiah you kinda shy
[1:09:22] you have a complex
[1:09:26] yeah when the visitor come you run away
[1:09:29] I saw you since your childhood
[1:09:33] let's see who you are
[1:09:36] he said before I formed you before
[1:09:39] Genesis 2 7.
[1:09:42] in the belly I know you in other words
[1:09:46] where there was no Genesis 2 7.
[1:09:51] you already was there
[1:09:56] so let's take Genesis 2 7 a little bit
[1:09:58] out let me talk to you about what
[1:10:01] happened in Genesis 1 26.

[1:10:21] he did that to job job complaint
[1:10:23] complain he said

[1:10:28] come on get on the airplane
[1:10:30] then he took job he said look who he
[1:10:33] where were you
[1:10:35] [Music]
[1:10:37] we okay
[1:10:39] are you getting the message
[1:10:42] your glory to God he said before I
[1:10:46] formed you in the belly I know you
[1:10:51] before you come out
[1:10:54] of the water
[1:10:56] before what you call your birthday
[1:11:03] before your birthday that you celebrate
[1:11:05] every year you keep that all the time my
[1:11:08] birthday my birthday my birthday they
[1:11:10] didn't give me a gift you get upset
[1:11:12] ah
[1:11:15] and you give so much attention to that
[1:11:18] but before that
[1:11:22] [Applause]
[1:11:24] in other words don't get caught up with
[1:11:26] that
[1:11:27] there is something more about you
[1:11:31] than when you started in this earth
[1:11:34] you coming from somewhere he said before
[1:11:37] you come out of the womb I did water
[1:11:40] Sanctified thee so when did God started
[1:11:43] to work with Jeremiah
[1:11:45] Foundation of yours
[1:11:51] Amen in the in your mother's womb what
[1:11:54] can you do
[1:11:56] can you pray
[1:11:59] [Music]
[1:12:03] I did water
[1:12:06] in other words are consecrated you
[1:12:09] I took you and I set you aside
[1:12:13] that happened not in your mother's womb
[1:12:17] before Genesis 7 before your birthday
[1:12:22] and before your conception
[1:12:25] because somebody will say no so I was
[1:12:27] born when my mother got pregnant okay
[1:12:29] God said before that pregnancy that's
[1:12:31] right somebody said no I was born the
[1:12:33] day he said no no before you were born
[1:12:34] so God is killing both of them the
[1:12:37] pregnancy and the day you came out
[1:12:38] because somebody said no no you can be
[1:12:41] there pregnant but you can be still born
[1:12:44] so you were not dead so God eliminate
[1:12:46] both of them
[1:12:48] that's right
[1:12:50] amen
[1:12:52] amen
[1:12:54] because the way the day our mother got
[1:12:58] pregnant nobody really knows that's why
[1:13:00] we don't touch that that's why we stay
[1:13:02] away we only remember when you came out
[1:13:04] from the hospital that's all we know
[1:13:06] but God is eliminating both
[1:13:09] amen he said I sanctify you I did water
[1:13:13] ordained I ordain you to be a water
[1:13:16] Prophet to the water
[1:13:19] so the uh the prophetic office
[1:13:22] is it in Genesis 2 7 or is it in Genesis
[1:13:28] 1 26.
[1:13:30] are you following me
[1:13:32] are you following me
[1:13:34] amen so be so so your prophetic office
[1:13:38] have nothing to do with when your mother
[1:13:42] got pregnant
[1:13:44] he has nothing to do when you were born
[1:13:47] in a hospital
[1:13:48] you're not the word even if you are not
[1:13:52] physically alive
[1:13:53] yeah amen you are still a prophet
[1:13:58] amen that's why when Samuel died
[1:14:04] you remember now when they brought him
[1:14:06] by the witch of Endor he cannot be
[1:14:10] nothing else but a prophet
[1:14:12] because that Prophet started before
[1:14:16] that's why he can come out from that
[1:14:18] Dimension and still prophesy in other
[1:14:21] words you can never take away what was
[1:14:25] put in Genesis 1 26.
[1:14:28] now
[1:14:33] amen this lecture is taking longer than
[1:14:36] I thought
[1:14:37] amen
[1:14:38] job 2 verse 6. then
[1:14:42] say the ah who spit who's saying
[1:14:45] Jeremiah glory Lord God
[1:14:52] how can they give you such a news
[1:14:54] and you saying ah
[1:14:58] instead of saying glory to God Jeremiah
[1:15:02] Say ah
[1:15:04] what is wrong with this boy
[1:15:09] am I reading a different Bible
[1:15:11] what is wrong with this boy
[1:15:15] he says Ah Lord God
[1:15:19] behold I cannot water
[1:15:22] number one for I am a water a child I'm
[1:15:27] in Genesis too
[1:15:30] wow everybody okay
[1:15:33] God is talking to him about Genesis 1
[1:15:37] 26.
[1:15:38] to make him know who he is
[1:15:43] but Jeremiah is so caught up
[1:15:47] in Genesis 2 7 that he sees his
[1:15:51] inability
[1:15:54] I am a child
[1:15:56] I don't even know how to speak
[1:15:59] I cannot stand in front of the pulpit
[1:16:01] like brother Stephen and talk
[1:16:06] I can't do it
[1:16:12] everybody okay
[1:16:13] job that's why I told you it doesn't
[1:16:16] depend on how big you are if heavy set
[1:16:19] or skinny or that doesn't have anything
[1:16:21] to do
[1:16:23] because that's where your trouble is I
[1:16:25] cannot speak for I Am a Child do you
[1:16:28] think when he get adult he get in a
[1:16:31] stage where he's an adult I saw a
[1:16:33] daughter that don't want to stand here
[1:16:39] verse 7 but the Lord said to me
[1:16:45] are we reading the same thing
[1:16:47] yes are we are we reading the same thing
[1:16:49] God is revealing to us to Jeremiah
[1:16:54] something
[1:16:55] and Jeremiah is dropping down into a
[1:16:58] different level
[1:17:00] God is telling Moses he said Moses you
[1:17:03] come
[1:17:05] you need to go to Egypt Moses come up
[1:17:08] with Genesis 2 7. he said wait a minute
[1:17:11] I don't know how to speak matter of fact
[1:17:13] I have a trouble speaking come on now
[1:17:16] yes sir
[1:17:17] awesome look at God what he's talking
[1:17:21] this man with complex
[1:17:24] because maybe his father didn't have a
[1:17:26] lot of money
[1:17:28] God is saying but the Lord said to me
[1:17:31] say not
[1:17:33] I am a water in other words you need to
[1:17:36] stop that kind of language
[1:17:37] [Applause]
[1:17:39] if me God I'm talking to you don't you
[1:17:42] think I know you're a child
[1:17:46] don't you think I know you already have
[1:17:48] a problem with your speech
[1:17:50] so you think I'm wasting my time or I
[1:17:53] didn't calculate my equation pretty good
[1:17:57] in other words you are telling God you
[1:18:00] are making a wrong choice
[1:18:02] I am not the one to do something so God
[1:18:05] made a mistake you know better than God
[1:18:09] did you on the same thing the same army
[1:18:11] men of value he said who's my number
[1:18:13] so God is also the Bible said let every
[1:18:17] man's word be what
[1:18:19] and God's word be water so who's saying
[1:18:22] the truth God
[1:18:25] Our Truth we want to even prove it
[1:18:28] but God is calling that a lie
[1:18:31] because it doesn't reflect
[1:18:36] what God is looking at
[1:18:39] that's why Abraham was calling
[1:18:42] everything
[1:18:44] that is contrary to what they show him
[1:18:46] like he doesn't exist
[1:18:51] if God say hey
[1:18:54] you say B Abraham say B doesn't exist
[1:18:57] [Applause]
[1:19:01] Ence
[1:19:03] God say say not I am a child I want you
[1:19:08] to change that confession
[1:19:12] say not I am a child for you shall go to
[1:19:15] all that I shall water you need to break
[1:19:19] that complex out of you
[1:19:22] I know what I put there
[1:19:24] amen
[1:19:25] and whosoever I commend you you shall
[1:19:28] Watters be whatsoever I tell you to
[1:19:31] speak speak
[1:19:34] I didn't tell you to say my name is
[1:19:37] brother Stephen no
[1:19:39] that's why a prophet were coming and
[1:19:41] saying da safety he doesn't worry about
[1:19:44] you
[1:19:47] we okay
[1:19:49] verse uh eight be not afraid of the
[1:19:52] water faces
[1:19:54] Genesis 2 7 when they begin to fraud at

[1:20:01] when they are rolling their eyes go
[1:20:04] ahead and hit it pretty hard
[1:20:06] [Applause]
[1:20:14] it's intimidation
[1:20:18] [Applause]
[1:20:21] when they start building attitude go
[1:20:23] ahead that's even the right opportunity
[1:20:25] for you to to remember who you are
[1:20:29] and you say God bless you
[1:20:31] good to see you but I need to tell you
[1:20:34] you need to change

[1:20:51] Lord then the Lord put forth his hand
[1:20:53] and touch my water mouth why mouth
[1:21:00] and the Lord said to me behold I have
[1:21:03] put my water
[1:21:05] in your mouth

[1:21:12] the Nations and over the water kingdoms
[1:21:15] to do what

[1:21:34] what
[1:21:35] and to do water and to the water
[1:21:39] and to do what are you there my brother
[1:21:41] to build and to do what so Jeremiah can
[1:21:46] just stand and by his word he can do all
[1:21:49] of this
[1:21:49] [Applause]
[1:21:55] just by his word
[1:21:58] what kind of power is this
[1:22:01] everybody okay
[1:22:02] moreover the word of the Lord came to me
[1:22:05] saying Jeremiah what do you see
[1:22:12] do you remember this
[1:22:16] do you remember this
[1:22:18] do you remember this
[1:22:20] do you remember this right so when a
[1:22:23] road have already batted with almond
[1:22:25] tree it means that the prophet need to
[1:22:28] do what
[1:22:34] everybody okay
[1:22:36] why do you see a road with an almond
[1:22:38] tree that's what happened to Aaron's
[1:22:41] Road
[1:22:41] amen
[1:22:43] when the spoken word is given to the
[1:22:45] prophet a road appeared with almond
[1:22:48] trees
[1:22:50] amen verse 12 and then say the Lord to
[1:22:54] me you have where
[1:22:56] for I will do whatever
[1:22:58] do you know what he means Houston I will
[1:23:01] watch over
[1:23:03] My Water World to do water
[1:23:06] [Music]
[1:23:12] so when Jeremiah speak who's speaking
[1:23:17] let's go to Ephesian father
[1:23:21] we seen Jeremiah in Genesis 1.
[1:23:25] and Jeremiah in Genesis 2 Genesis 1 have
[1:23:30] nothing to do with your conception have
[1:23:33] nothing to do with your birth
[1:23:36] that's Genesis 2.
[1:23:38] but God is telling Jeremiah before you
[1:23:42] existed
[1:23:43] before Genesis 2 that's why David says
[1:23:46] this
[1:23:48] in Psalm 139 he said for thou has
[1:23:52] possessed my reign
[1:23:55] that has covered me in my mother's water
[1:23:59] I will praise thee
[1:24:01] Why Do You Want To Praise Him David
[1:24:04] for I am fearfully
[1:24:06] and wonderfully water May marvelous are
[1:24:10] that what works and that
[1:24:13] my head
[1:24:15] before
[1:24:19] one need to know that my soul why your
[1:24:22] soul need to know that
[1:24:27] Jeremiah I want you to understand
[1:24:29] something I want your soul to grasp
[1:24:32] something
[1:24:34] that before you were even formed I was
[1:24:37] there and David is saying that that
[1:24:39] my soul not Mom head
[1:24:42] because they had one produce anything
[1:24:44] the soul is where the heart is he said
[1:24:46] that my son know that how
[1:24:49] that's why you see David attacking
[1:24:51] Goliath
[1:24:54] everybody okay he said Mass substance
[1:24:57] what you call that baby was not hid from
[1:25:00] thee when I was made in secret and
[1:25:04] curiously wrote in the lowest part of
[1:25:07] the Earth
[1:25:08] than eyes did see my water substance yet
[1:25:12] being water I was just an egg fertilized
[1:25:16] and in that water book
[1:25:18] that book is the it's another name for

[1:33:43] bride
[1:33:44] everybody okay
[1:33:45] so we can see right here that
[1:33:49] Redemption is always connected to
[1:33:54] marriage
[1:33:57] [Applause]
[1:33:58] everybody okay you cannot have
[1:34:01] Redemption without marriage
[1:34:06] everybody okay
[1:34:08] the story of redemption is always
[1:34:12] coupled
[1:34:14] with marriage
[1:34:20] What is marriage now you took me to a
[1:34:23] different Avenue
[1:34:26] that I was not prepared what is really
[1:34:28] marriage
[1:34:31] What is marriage marriage is what
[1:34:34] we found out that in the Garden of Eden
[1:34:37] God created Adam
[1:34:41] and Adam in his sad he was male and
[1:34:45] female
[1:34:46] amen then God moved from Genesis 1 into
[1:34:51] Genesis chapter 2 and took this Adam
[1:34:54] here and put him in the flesh
[1:34:57] amen and In the Flesh Adam was X Y again
[1:35:01] that was Genesis 2. amen God Adam here
[1:35:06] in the flesh was alone
[1:35:11] everybody okay
[1:35:12] there was no marriage here
[1:35:16] everybody okay
[1:35:17] so God said I'm gonna make Adam
[1:35:21] a help mate that looks just like him
[1:35:26] everybody okay so God went and get
[1:35:29] inside this Adam here
[1:35:34] everybody okay and God performed a
[1:35:37] surgery and open the door
[1:35:40] everybody okay God enter inside Adam you
[1:35:44] following me and took another Adam
[1:35:48] I don't want to say if that's where we
[1:35:50] get confused God kept in Adam and took
[1:35:54] Adam out of Adam
[1:35:58] everybody okay everybody okay and God
[1:36:02] pulled one Adam out
[1:36:04] amen and when God pulled that out about
[1:36:07] he closed the flesh now the situation is
[1:36:12] Adam and Adam there is Adam one and Adam
[1:36:17] too
[1:36:19] right
[1:36:20] everybody okay Adam one was a male
[1:36:24] and Adam too was a female
[1:36:28] everybody okay
[1:36:29] still at this point there is no marriage
[1:36:34] are we following me now what is marriage
[1:36:39] since Adam too
[1:36:41] you following me was taken out from her
[1:36:46] original position
[1:36:51] amen
[1:36:53] God needed to take what belongs to Adam
[1:36:57] and to take it back again to Adam
[1:37:02] I don't know if you're following me God
[1:37:04] went to Adam and took a reap out of Adam
[1:37:08] God went with the rib and sat down and
[1:37:12] begin to work with the weave and Hope
[1:37:14] somebody came out God said but this is
[1:37:17] Adam
[1:37:18] this doesn't belong to me God
[1:37:21] this belong to who
[1:37:23] so God take Eve and say let's go back
[1:37:27] where you belong
[1:37:30] everybody okay everybody okay they're
[1:37:33] bringing back
[1:37:36] of Eve
[1:37:38] to her original
[1:37:41] position
[1:37:43] that is what marriage is all about
[1:37:50] did you follow me
[1:37:51] [Applause]
[1:37:53] if I lost you raise your hand so
[1:37:57] marriage is taking Eve back where she
[1:38:01] belongs
[1:38:02] [Applause]
[1:38:04] everybody okay when they take Eve back
[1:38:08] to Adam and God joined them together
[1:38:12] that is what marriage is
[1:38:15] [Applause]
[1:38:16] so marriage is redemption
[1:38:19] [Applause]
[1:38:23] because brother Branham said Redemption
[1:38:26] means take something back to its
[1:38:29] original water
[1:38:31] assistant
[1:38:35] do you follow me so if you have a true
[1:38:38] revelation of marriage the woman that
[1:38:42] you get married to
[1:38:44] the woman that you make suffer
[1:38:47] [Applause]
[1:38:51] then you the woman that you are playing
[1:38:53] came with
[1:38:55] is nothing else but you yourself
[1:38:58] [Applause]
[1:39:04] the woman that you are beating down
[1:39:08] come on
[1:39:10] you're breathing yourself that's why
[1:39:12] Paul said how can you play with your own
[1:39:15] body
[1:39:16] you need to nourish your body and
[1:39:18] cherish it because it's your body so
[1:39:21] that woman that you see there it is your
[1:39:23] rib
[1:39:25] when you are beating hell you bid in
[1:39:27] your River
[1:39:28] [Applause]
[1:39:31] so what happened is when you and her was
[1:39:35] born God split you
[1:39:40] he took you and put you in this I didn't
[1:39:43] prepare this but somebody may be needed
[1:39:46] God took you and put you in this family
[1:39:48] and God took you and put you in that
[1:39:51] family but that is both of you have one
[1:39:55] name
[1:39:55] [Applause]
[1:39:58] do you follow me I wish I can preach
[1:40:02] this in a marriage day
[1:40:04] everybody okay both of you are one
[1:40:07] person
[1:40:08] so there were many men many boys that
[1:40:13] came to you and nothing in your heart
[1:40:15] click them
[1:40:17] because you didn't belong to them
[1:40:22] I'm talking about a true marriage
[1:40:25] you didn't belong to them they can do
[1:40:28] everything they can have all kind of
[1:40:30] potential
[1:40:32] but even though they're good
[1:40:37] let me help you up again they can even
[1:40:40] have the Holy Ghost
[1:40:44] [Music]
[1:40:46] they have the Holy Ghost
[1:40:48] but still
[1:40:50] something in you
[1:40:53] say nothing
[1:40:55] but one day let that guy pass
[1:41:01] when he talks to you
[1:41:04] it goes beyond your head
[1:41:07] [Applause]
[1:41:10] he looks like he looks like all
[1:41:13] decorator and when a boy came the first
[1:41:15] time you were like check check check
[1:41:17] check check check no didn't pass next no
[1:41:22] no no but the day that man will come
[1:41:28] when you are talking to him you won't
[1:41:30] realize that the pepper is already
[1:41:32] dropped on the floor
[1:41:37] and when they ask you they say did you
[1:41:40] check he has the Holy Ghost you don't
[1:41:42] even remember checking the Holy Ghost
[1:41:46] [Applause]
[1:41:49] [Music]
[1:41:50] [Applause]
[1:41:52] are pulling one another
[1:41:56] why do you love him I don't know
[1:41:59] but this boy is more better than him
[1:42:02] that's true but there is something about
[1:42:04] this one
[1:42:06] [Applause]
[1:42:08] that one is a marriage that can never be
[1:42:12] broken
[1:42:15] it's a marriage the standard from
[1:42:18] eternity
[1:42:19] [Applause]
[1:42:29] talk to sister
[1:42:31] you're gonna hear a whole lot of story
[1:42:33] like the day he talked to me I said
[1:42:36] what does boom means
[1:42:42] what did he tell you that did boom
[1:42:45] what did he tell you that did boom
[1:42:48] God means what he didn't say I love you
[1:42:52] but the Boom is greater than any
[1:42:55] reasoning
[1:42:58] and that boom is whenever her death come
[1:43:02] in a marriage that boom is the one that
[1:43:05] come out and stabilize everything
[1:43:07] [Applause]
[1:43:09] it is the absolute
[1:43:12] it is the absolute the final reference
[1:43:16] point
[1:43:17] well no matter how hard the marriage get
[1:43:20] if you can point that boom where it is
[1:43:25] all right
[1:43:26] Hallelujah
[1:43:31] [Applause]
[1:43:34] everybody okay so marriage is always the
[1:43:39] story of redemption that's why
[1:43:41] throughout the entire Bible you will see
[1:43:45] it's about marriage marriage marriage
[1:43:47] marriage marriage that's why the first
[1:43:49] miracle of Jesus happened where
[1:43:52] why in the marriage
[1:43:55] he was telling us that Redemption has
[1:43:58] come and Redemption is always connected
[1:44:02] to marriage so when they brought Jesus
[1:44:04] in marriage Jesus could not contain
[1:44:07] because this is very Redemption
[1:44:11] no no
[1:44:13] no please
[1:44:17] What is marriage
[1:44:19] I gotta get married I want to get
[1:44:21] married do you understand marriage I
[1:44:23] even talked to somebody yesterday I said
[1:44:25] we got a problem in the message
[1:44:27] [Music]
[1:44:28] people married they don't even know
[1:44:31] why they marry we just marry by copy or
[1:44:35] we marry by Instinct like animals

[1:44:42] burning and you want somebody to soothe
[1:44:45] your burning I'm sorry I'm talking to my
[1:44:48] church
[1:44:49] okay
[1:44:50] okay that's not the reason why you

[1:44:54] because when you get seven the things
[1:44:56] you get different
[1:44:57] what are you gonna do but that boom of
[1:45:01] the manga it takes the sweeter it
[1:45:04] becomes
[1:45:09] everybody okay whether there is no food
[1:45:12] or not you can't wait to see that person
[1:45:17] it's a different story altogether
[1:45:20] [Applause]
[1:45:25] you can never point the the the the the
[1:45:29] origin of your marriage to something
[1:45:32] the devil will destroy it if it was
[1:45:35] Beauty what are you gonna do once again
[1:45:36] wait
[1:45:40] what are you gonna do with your beauty
[1:45:43] you're gonna make your wife suffer to
[1:45:45] the gym
[1:45:46] to please you so that she can have the
[1:45:49] shape that you originally loving that is
[1:45:53] not marriage
[1:45:57] you want her to work out you can work
[1:45:59] out too
[1:46:00] and go back to your original shape
[1:46:03] that even the ship changed it doesn't
[1:46:06] matter it is not Genesis 2 it is Genesis
[1:46:11] one it is the one who is inside
[1:46:15] that person never get old that person
[1:46:18] leaves eternally
[1:46:20] as your Eternal mate we can leave this
[1:46:24] body but in eternity we will hold
[1:46:26] together
[1:46:28] that is marriage
[1:46:35] so young people rephrase we look again
[1:46:39] why you want to get married
[1:46:43] [Music]
[1:46:43] [Applause]
[1:46:45] Paul said it is better to marry than to
[1:46:48] burn yes but Paul say You must love your
[1:46:52] wife as Christ you're when you're
[1:46:54] burning do you already have crust
[1:46:57] all right
[1:47:00] do you all have you have questions

[1:47:09] show me questions oh I don't have any
[1:47:11] problem go ahead and move

[1:47:14] love your wife
[1:47:15] what are you gonna do
[1:47:19] I can enter many domain right now
[1:47:23] but I cannot
[1:47:24] [Applause]
[1:47:27] what are you gonna do if she's sick
[1:47:31] you know what I'm talking about what are
[1:47:33] you gonna do if she gets sick for two
[1:47:35] months
[1:47:37] [Music]
[1:47:38] what you gonna do
[1:47:41] what you gonna do
[1:47:45] [Music]
[1:47:46] for the weather so they better for the
[1:47:49] word so okay the worst game
[1:47:51] let's see the words to what you're gonna
[1:47:53] do
[1:47:55] [Music]
[1:47:58] [Applause]
[1:48:01] [Music]
[1:48:03] foreign
[1:48:06] I already disclosed to you the
[1:48:08] definition of marriage
[1:48:10] Merit is always connected with
[1:48:14] Redemption you cannot have Redemption
[1:48:16] with our marriage that's why the book of
[1:48:20] roof is a very special book
[1:48:22] [Applause]
[1:48:25] because the Book of Ruth is not talking
[1:48:28] about just Redemption but that
[1:48:31] Redemption is Kappa with a marriage
[1:48:34] good evening
[1:48:37] that's why brother Branham says this he
[1:48:40] said Redemption is a beautiful story
[1:48:43] beautiful story of redemption a
[1:48:46] beautiful little story coming to my man
[1:48:48] a book that is water sure in the Bible
[1:48:51] and give her the very water of Water
[1:48:55] that is the book of water many people
[1:48:58] just pass over that book but it's the
[1:49:00] most
[1:49:06] because it's marriage and Redemption put
[1:49:10] together
[1:49:10] [Applause]
[1:49:12] it is the very mind of God
[1:49:15] brother Branham says this he said this
[1:49:18] story was written and all other all
[1:49:21] the old manuscript when they were
[1:49:24] segregating the Bible the holy man when
[1:49:26] they were trying to put it together in
[1:49:28] the Old Testament this book of water was
[1:49:31] one of the most water outstanding books
[1:49:34] that they did what why if it's just a
[1:49:38] love story why would the rather and the
[1:49:42] ancient Sage accept this book as water
[1:49:45] because there is a water
[1:49:49] and in this hidden revelation when you
[1:49:52] catch the water
[1:49:54] he will do water
[1:49:57] Paul said it is a great mystery
[1:50:02] so if you catch the very mystery of the
[1:50:05] Book of Ruth is a mystery of redemption
[1:50:09] and marriage and marriage bring us back
[1:50:13] in Genesis chapter 1 and chapter 2.
[1:50:19] [Applause]
[1:50:21] the wife of the Lamb we okay now now we
[1:50:27] found out this
[1:50:29] god brother Branham say look at how God
[1:50:32] planned that
[1:50:36] God is the male part
[1:50:41] that brought who Jesus Jesus here now
[1:50:44] God is a spirit so there could not be
[1:50:47] any sex
[1:50:49] remember in Christ
[1:50:51] there couldn't be any such or desire
[1:50:53] because if he was then Jesus was not
[1:50:56] born a virgin birth
[1:50:58] everybody okay now we found out that
[1:51:01] when God brought up Jesus Christ brother
[1:51:04] Branham says this about Jesus Christ I'm
[1:51:07] repeating this quote
[1:51:09] about him said but remember he went
[1:51:11] there with you in uh with you in him see
[1:51:15] God had never separated the bread from
[1:51:18] the water
[1:51:20] [Applause]
[1:51:22] so now we are working backward
[1:51:25] s where have I put it
[1:51:27] we are working now backwards
[1:51:30] underneath thank you so over here we
[1:51:34] started with Genesis 1 26 then Genesis 1
[1:51:37] 26 moved to Genesis 2 7. now brother
[1:51:40] Branham is starting with Genesis 2 7 of
[1:51:44] not Adam
[1:51:46] but the second Adam who is the Lord
[1:51:49] Jesus Christ
[1:51:51] because he also have a name
[1:51:53] and he is the second honor
[1:51:56] everybody okay and brother Branham is
[1:51:59] talking to us about the Genesis 2 7 of
[1:52:03] Jesus
[1:52:05] according to brother Branham the Genesis
[1:52:08] 2 7 of Jesus all the physical body of
[1:52:13] Jesus
[1:52:16] is how
[1:52:18] we found out that the physical body of
[1:52:21] Adam had even son
[1:52:23] So Adam was man and water female great
[1:52:27] let's see the physical body of Jesus
[1:52:29] Christ as we're building back up the
[1:52:32] wife of the Lamb you need to know where
[1:52:35] who's your wife where was your wife
[1:52:39] then you know how to handle her
[1:52:42] the Bible says uh brother Branham saying
[1:52:45] so when God looked down upon the Water
[1:52:49] Body of Christ he saw above water male
[1:52:53] and female fight me on it
[1:52:57] so according to brother pranam the body
[1:53:00] of Jesus Christ I have to go slowly with
[1:53:03] this my friend
[1:53:04] Jesus also was water and water
[1:53:08] why because Jesus is the last Adam
[1:53:12] so he must be exactly like Adam
[1:53:17] we okay male and female over there
[1:53:20] everybody will accept the problem is
[1:53:23] right here
[1:53:24] this is where I get people to take off
[1:53:26] leave the car out to run on the highway
[1:53:28] and everything everybody okay he says so
[1:53:31] when God looked down the body of Christ
[1:53:34] he saw above mail and water female he
[1:53:37] was our redeeming that water it's a
[1:53:40] combo a package they are
[1:53:43] same water
[1:53:45] same word spoke of water
[1:53:48] speak of water
[1:53:51] what does he mean
[1:53:54] God bless them
[1:53:57] and he taught them do what have
[1:54:01] a death yes
[1:54:04] [Applause]
[1:54:11] watch to the bride to the groom is
[1:54:15] the same word that was applied to who
[1:54:18] so there is no distinction
[1:54:20] [Applause]
[1:54:23] I'm trying to get you somewhere buddy
[1:54:29] [Applause]
[1:54:31] this blessing was not given to the man
[1:54:37] the Bible said bless them
[1:54:40] so the blessing that goes to Adam was
[1:54:44] the same blessing that was going to ease
[1:54:46] that's why God called both of them
[1:54:50] item
[1:54:51] there is no distraction what speak of
[1:54:55] the Bride of the groom speak the same
[1:54:58] for the water because the two are what
[1:55:01] is he complicated my fellow
[1:55:04] glory to God
[1:55:07] everybody okay
[1:55:08] everybody okay now we found out that
[1:55:12] when Adam was created in this uh body
[1:55:16] here Adam spent some time alone
[1:55:23] alone in nature but not in the body
[1:55:28] everybody okay so after spending a
[1:55:31] Ministry
[1:55:34] a time of a Ministry
[1:55:36] and in that Ministry God was creating
[1:55:39] the animal bringing them to Adam and
[1:55:42] Adam was giving name so Adam has a
[1:55:45] Ministry before Eve came out
[1:55:50] [Applause]
[1:55:53] if I lost you raise your hand
[1:55:57] if I lost you raise your hand I cannot
[1:56:01] it's like a teacher I cannot continue
[1:56:04] with a class and somebody's struggling

[1:56:44] Genesis 2.
[1:56:47] are you there yes sir verse 15. are you
[1:56:50] there
[1:56:52] and the Lord God took the man and put
[1:56:55] him in the Garden of Eden to dress it
[1:56:57] and to the water was if there
[1:57:00] 16 and the Lord God commanded the men
[1:57:03] saying of every tree of the garden may
[1:57:05] you freely water he was if there
[1:57:08] but of the tree of the knowledge of Good
[1:57:11] and Evil you shall not eat for in the
[1:57:13] day that you eat thereof you shall water
[1:57:15] surely die was if there for proof Verse
[1:57:19] 18 and the Lord God said it is not good

[1:57:32] ground the Lord God formed every beast
[1:57:34] of the field every file of the air and
[1:57:37] brought them to her Adam to see what he
[1:57:40] would do after and whatsoever Adam call
[1:57:43] every living creature that was the water
[1:57:46] and Adam gave them to all Carter to our
[1:57:49] foul of the air to every beast of the
[1:57:52] field but for Adam there was not water
[1:57:54] so there was a time that Adam having
[1:57:57] Ministry
[1:57:58] himself without ease
[1:58:05] and in that Ministry what Adam was
[1:58:08] giving the name God could not contradict
[1:58:11] him
[1:58:14] [Music]
[1:58:16] in other words he was a Ministry where
[1:58:20] Adam had the mind of God
[1:58:23] [Applause]
[1:58:24] [Music]
[1:58:27] [Applause]
[1:58:31] are you following me let's go to James
[1:58:34] chapter 3.

[1:58:51] autopilot so he knows better he already
[1:58:54] checked the weather he knows what to
[1:58:55] which direction to take
[1:58:58] amen let's go to General to James
[1:59:01] chapter three if you dare you can say
[1:59:03] Amen
[1:59:04] you there you there if you notice God
[1:59:08] gave adam the power of everything
[1:59:12] that was upon the Earth and God showed
[1:59:16] us through Jeremiah that that power is
[1:59:19] given by the Tongue
[1:59:22] by the time you can rule out you can
[1:59:25] destroy you can plant you can change
[1:59:28] everything
[1:59:31] So Adam was not there going to a
[1:59:34] mountain and go Mountain
[1:59:37] that was not what Adam was doing Adam
[1:59:40] was using a member
[1:59:44] let's see when Adam fell what did he
[1:59:48] really lose
[1:59:50] [Music]
[1:59:51] we okay
[1:59:53] we okay let's go to James three
[1:59:57] if you dare you can say Amen
[1:59:59] verse 5 watch this
[2:00:02] even saw the tongue is a little water
[2:00:05] remember and boast water great things
[2:00:08] why is a little member talking great
[2:00:10] things
[2:00:12] amen he was created he was what he have
[2:00:16] a software
[2:00:19] there is a software of a town
[2:00:22] to speak great things it depends on how
[2:00:25] you hook it
[2:00:30] it depends on the source you hook it in
[2:00:32] it's a software
[2:00:36] everybody okay
[2:00:38] and then he says that it's a tongue uh
[2:00:42] verse five behold how great a little who
[2:00:46] are great the mother a little water fire
[2:00:49] Kindles and the tongue you there
[2:00:53] is a water fire a world of water it's a
[2:00:58] whole world
[2:01:04] so the world exists in the tongue
[2:01:09] okay let's continue
[2:01:11] so is the tongue among our members that
[2:01:15] he defiled the whole water body and set
[2:01:18] on fire at the water horse of nature it
[2:01:21] doesn't means that you're taking your
[2:01:23] tongue and you pulling up like a
[2:01:26] mattress and you go burn nature
[2:01:29] Adam was controlling Nature by water
[2:01:33] Jeremiah have to root and Destroy and to
[2:01:36] do and to plan by what
[2:01:38] so the tongue can change your life
[2:01:43] he can change the whole course of your
[2:01:45] life
[2:01:47] are you okay that's why God told
[2:01:50] Jeremiah stop saying I'm a child
[2:01:54] ah you need to change that way
[2:01:58] what I tell you to say just say it the
[2:02:01] way I told you
[2:02:05] everybody okay
[2:02:08] Hallelujah let's go down now it sets and
[2:02:12] it is set on fire of water hell because
[2:02:14] of the Fall watch verse seven for every
[2:02:18] kind of water please remember Genesis
[2:02:21] comma and every kind of water lord
[2:02:24] remember Genesis comma and everyone and
[2:02:28] of water remember Genesis and everything
[2:02:31] that is in the water is water and has
[2:02:36] been watered of water mankind
[2:02:40] so even after the fall
[2:02:44] men managed to control everything that
[2:02:47] God gave him under
[2:02:50] but not with the tongue now
[2:02:54] everybody okay
[2:02:56] job to verse 8. but the water
[2:03:00] can no man water it is an unruly water
[2:03:03] for it's a full of deadly water so it
[2:03:07] shows here that at the beginning God
[2:03:10] gave men dominion over everything and
[2:03:13] that Dominion was based on the power of
[2:03:16] the tongue so when man fell he lost the
[2:03:21] power of the spoken word
[2:03:23] [Music]
[2:03:27] we okay now now man begin to rely on the
[2:03:31] tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil
[2:03:33] in order to take animal shoot them kill
[2:03:36] them threaten them put them in the zoo
[2:03:39] shoot them with something that make them
[2:03:41] sleep and capture them and put them in
[2:03:43] the zoo he's operating in in a way after
[2:03:47] the fall but truly he didn't have to do
[2:03:49] that
[2:03:51] why because man realized that he can
[2:03:55] control animals he can still control the
[2:03:57] bird he can control nature he can come
[2:03:59] to Gastonia destroy a whole mountain and
[2:04:02] make it a plan he can do that and put a
[2:04:05] I mean uh I mean a dynamite and blow the
[2:04:08] entire mountain and change he can still
[2:04:10] control nature but he found out he
[2:04:13] lacked the control of the tongue
[2:04:15] because that is divine
[2:04:20] everybody okay everybody okay so when
[2:04:24] Jesus Christ came when after Adam spent
[2:04:27] that time of a personal Ministry
[2:04:30] are you following me he came a time
[2:04:32] where God have to put that Adam to sleep
[2:04:37] we okay now when he put that Adam to
[2:04:39] sleep God went inside that Adam
[2:04:43] and pull another Adam
[2:04:46] and made two Adams now we have Adam and
[2:04:50] Adam Adam
[2:04:52] and we found in the body of Jesus Christ
[2:04:55] also he was what male and female and
[2:04:58] after three and a half years
[2:05:02] of a personal Ministry of Jesus Christ
[2:05:06] where Jesus spoke to the wind
[2:05:09] he was alone Jesus multiplied bread
[2:05:12] Jesus did this did this did this did
[2:05:15] this after his personal Ministry or with
[2:05:20] the word of God because he was the word
[2:05:22] made flesh they have to come a time they
[2:05:26] have to put also Jesus to sleep just
[2:05:28] like Adam and when they put him to sleep
[2:05:31] out of his sight they have to pull the
[2:05:34] yeah
[2:05:35] everybody okay
[2:05:37] [Applause]
[2:05:40] brother Branham is the bride of Christ
[2:05:44] and the body of Christ the same the
[2:05:48] answer is what yes sir
[2:05:53] your wife is your own body we just went
[2:05:56] through that
[2:05:57] because you are the head
[2:06:00] brother Branham said now see I don't
[2:06:02] want to get started on it
[2:06:05] because I can preach a sermon on me but
[2:06:08] I won't do that but I want to show you
[2:06:11] when God gave adam his word
[2:06:13] from his
[2:06:15] side he said she is now
[2:06:17] and go and water and when God gave
[2:06:21] Christ his water right the spirit gave
[2:06:24] the flesh there right he did water
[2:06:27] indeed what in his sad and
[2:06:31] water and blood and Spirit came forth
[2:06:35] that become water
[2:06:36] and water we are the Flesh of his father
[2:06:42] the bread will be the Flesh and death of
[2:06:47] who Christ exactly
[2:06:50] [Applause]
[2:06:51] that is his bride
[2:06:56] if
[2:06:58] was the Flesh of Adam and the blood of
[2:07:02] Adam so we got a second Adam here who
[2:07:06] was male and female after his ministry
[2:07:09] they pierce him what do you think come
[2:07:12] out of it
[2:07:15] water everybody okay
[2:07:16] this problem is easy
[2:07:20] if Adam was male and female here this is
[2:07:24] not bad coincidence
[2:07:27] we okay now Adam is male and female
[2:07:29] because Adam one in Genesis 1 was
[2:07:34] already mere and female he was only a
[2:07:37] replica
[2:07:39] the wife of the Lamb if Jesus Christ in
[2:07:43] the body was male and female this must
[2:07:47] be a replica of this guy
[2:07:50] [Applause]
[2:07:52] oh my God
[2:07:55] that's right amen Jesus cannot be male
[2:07:58] and female in the body if he was not
[2:08:02] male and female in the spirit
[2:08:03] [Applause]
[2:08:04] Adam cannot be Adam male and female if
[2:08:09] he was not male and female so right here
[2:08:11] we can see that Jesus also
[2:08:16] when you take him to Genesis
[2:08:19] 1 26.
[2:08:22] you're following me this Jesus here must
[2:08:26] be also water
[2:08:29] that's why when he created man in his
[2:08:34] own image in his own likeness man was
[2:08:38] water
[2:08:40] because he himself is what
[2:08:43] any question
[2:08:48] any question
[2:08:50] where are you trying to get me now this
[2:08:52] is where we were
[2:08:54] brother Branham said God in the
[2:08:56] beginning when he knowed men and women
[2:08:59] was made water one not two they were
[2:09:02] made one they were separated one put in
[2:09:05] the flesh and one inner to your father
[2:09:07] so in order to prove that to you when
[2:09:10] God made the woman he never took some
[2:09:12] dust and made her like he did the man he
[2:09:15] took a what out of the side of Adam she
[2:09:18] became a byproduct of a man because
[2:09:20] she's part of a man this is where we got
[2:09:23] a trouble
[2:09:25] these are the angels and God
[2:09:28] and the spirit that is John with who is
[2:09:33] water
[2:09:37] are we okay
[2:09:39] read me that quote again my brother
[2:09:41] and God right here and God
[2:09:47] and the spirit that is John 2 God both
[2:09:51] of them are water once
[2:09:58] your amen went down
[2:10:01] God and the spirit that is joined
[2:10:05] join means what
[2:10:11] Revelations say the lamb have a wife
[2:10:15] she's called the brother so their wife
[2:10:18] must come from the lamb and that wife
[2:10:20] must be exactly like the lamb but the
[2:10:23] wife of Adam came from water
[2:10:27] the spirit of God that was in the water
[2:10:31] the church which is the bread is the
[2:10:34] spirit that comes from water Heaven that
[2:10:37] God knew before the water
[2:10:39] off the water of the world that rejected
[2:10:43] water the devil's life
[2:10:55] I'm gonna erase the top here
[2:10:57] let me erase the top here
[2:11:00] let me put it here follow me carefully
[2:11:04] because this will change you
[2:11:07] amen this is God
[2:11:10] and we know God Is Us we understand here
[2:11:14] that there was a God as here who created
[2:11:18] man in his own image and his own
[2:11:21] likeness and this man was man and water
[2:11:24] and this man was put in the flesh and
[2:11:27] this man also came in the flesh when he
[2:11:30] came in the flesh he became the Lord
[2:11:31] Jesus Christ
[2:11:34] amen which is the second Adam the first
[2:11:37] Adam the second Adam the first Adam was
[2:11:41] also male and female in the body and he
[2:11:43] was also male and female in the water
[2:11:46] why because he created man in his own
[2:11:50] and in his non-lagness everybody okay
[2:11:54] [Applause]
[2:11:57] this man when he created Adam
[2:12:01] he was in the beginning
[2:12:07] everybody okay let's go before the
[2:12:11] beginning
[2:12:18] we okay yeah before the beginning you
[2:12:22] follow me
[2:12:23] there was somebody here that was alone
[2:12:28] this man was called Elohim
[2:12:32] he is what they called the father
[2:12:36] and this man is God
[2:12:40] and this man is invisible
[2:12:45] we went through some of a lot of this
[2:12:47] everybody okay everybody okay what was
[2:12:50] with this man
[2:12:53] the wife of the name
[2:12:56] brother Branham said now watch carefully
[2:12:58] now and see before there was ever a
[2:13:01] speck of stars
[2:13:04] before God was what God
[2:13:09] in Genesis they call him water
[2:13:17] before God was God God is an object of
[2:13:21] adoration and no one was there to do
[2:13:23] what worship him so he was at that time
[2:13:27] only potentially what God
[2:13:29] okay
[2:13:31] hey everybody okay
[2:13:33] he was known only as
[2:13:37] Eternal water spirit
[2:13:42] everybody okay right here is just that
[2:13:46] spirit that existed on its own
[2:13:51] when we look at this we say there is one
[2:13:54] person
[2:13:55] I'm going with you now back up
[2:13:58] brother Branham say he know he was known
[2:14:01] only as eternal spirit Karma the bride
[2:14:05] was already in his water
[2:14:09] foreign
[2:14:10] so even before the beginning
[2:14:14] [Applause]
[2:14:16] I'm going slowly now
[2:14:18] everybody okay even before the beginning
[2:14:22] God was not alone
[2:14:29] that this man
[2:14:31] this Elohim this father here has already
[2:14:35] a brad in him
[2:14:39] and the Bible said the bread is the wife
[2:14:43] of the Lamb
[2:14:46] are we okay so this man even from
[2:14:50] eternity was male and female
[2:14:52] [Applause]
[2:15:00] I hope God help you catch it
[2:15:04] brother Branham said yes she was
[2:15:08] she was existing in his water thoughts
[2:15:11] and what about those thoughts of God
[2:15:13] they are how
[2:15:16] Eternal I did not the Eternal water
[2:15:18] thoughts of God
[2:15:22] so this woman in the body of Jesus
[2:15:25] Christ
[2:15:27] never has a beginning
[2:15:29] [Applause]
[2:15:32] [Music]
[2:15:37] amen
[2:15:39] [Music]
[2:15:42] do you understand what I'm saying
[2:15:44] do you can you take a a a
[2:15:48] lamb and a fish and make them together
[2:15:51] no because they are under different
[2:15:53] water categories okay can you take a
[2:15:56] human an animal and mate them together
[2:15:59] they're under different water categories
[2:16:02] and can you take a God and human and
[2:16:05] marry them together
[2:16:06] because they are in in in what
[2:16:09] categories so if you want to marry God
[2:16:11] you must find a wife that is how
[2:16:16] the wife of God must be working
[2:16:18] [Applause]
[2:16:22] the wife of God must be God
[2:16:26] [Applause]
[2:16:32] oh God I hope you're really sucking
[2:16:41] all right
[2:16:45] brother Brian I'm saying don't start
[2:16:48] that what
[2:16:49] Eternal let me ask you are the thoughts
[2:16:52] of God Eternal if you can see this
[2:16:58] you will see water many things what are
[2:17:01] the many things
[2:17:02] if you can understand here that this
[2:17:06] woman here is also eternal
[2:17:10] you will understand many things
[2:17:14] [Applause]
[2:17:16] the problem you are here
[2:17:21] [Music]
[2:17:22] when I'm talking to you right now your
[2:17:25] body is giving you problem
[2:17:27] the body is making some sleepy some are
[2:17:30] trying to go out some are all of that is
[2:17:32] your body because your body doesn't like
[2:17:35] this
[2:17:38] this kind of preaching your body doesn't
[2:17:40] like it nervous
[2:17:43] he said if you can see this you will see
[2:17:46] many things God is unchangeable in both
[2:17:49] water and water
[2:17:52] [Music]
[2:17:54] brother Branham continue he said he has
[2:17:58] never had the new thought about anything
[2:18:00] because all he thought he has always had
[2:18:05] [Music]
[2:18:07] and always will water
[2:18:10] and knows the end from what the
[2:18:12] beginning because he is God thus the
[2:18:16] thoughts of God are how
[2:18:18] Eternal and they are what real these
[2:18:21] thoughts that we're talking about are
[2:18:23] not like things floating in the air
[2:18:27] no sir no
[2:18:31] they are more real than this
[2:18:35] because these things were created from
[2:18:38] invisible
[2:18:42] brother Branham said they are not simply
[2:18:46] like man with a blueprint he has drawn
[2:18:49] up and which one day will be translated
[2:18:52] into a water so it's not a mental stuff
[2:18:55] that God have like mental thought going
[2:18:58] on no
[2:18:59] those thoughts are real
[2:19:02] each thought that can move
[2:19:08] I don't know if you get me those
[2:19:10] thoughts can work
[2:19:13] the Bible says in the Book of Genesis
[2:19:15] that the voice of God was walking
[2:19:18] did you ever see the voice walking
[2:19:24] everybody okay but they are already real
[2:19:28] and they are what
[2:19:30] Eternal as part of what God see how this
[2:19:33] works
[2:19:34] amen amen
[2:19:37] so if you pull those thoughts from God
[2:19:39] do you have god with you
[2:19:44] let's continue
[2:19:46] this who are of the royal seed are the
[2:19:50] elect of God
[2:19:51] are they predestinated for known of God
[2:19:54] and where in the mind of God and his
[2:19:58] water
[2:19:59] in very plain language

[2:47:42] as each member came forth it became
[2:47:45] Express and took in place in the water
[2:47:47] body thus this bread is the meter water
[2:47:51] spoken word seed water right and though
[2:47:54] she is feminine in designation she is
[2:47:58] also called the water the body of Christ
[2:48:00] it is very apparent that she ought to be
[2:48:03] called that for she was water
[2:48:06] in came from the water was
[2:48:11] eternal with him and he's now
[2:48:13] manifesting God in how many members
[2:48:16] everybody whereas once God was
[2:48:18] manifested in water one member even our
[2:48:21] Lord water Jesus Christ God in one
[2:48:24] person is Jesus Christ but God in the
[2:48:27] female version is the blood of Jesus
[2:48:30] Christ
[2:48:31] [Applause]
[2:48:34] everybody okay
[2:48:36] let's stop there brother Branham said
[2:48:38] let me skip this
[2:48:40] it's gone amen so plainly that they
[2:48:44] predestinated is the only one that is
[2:48:47] considering water yeah did you get it
[2:48:49] let me say that again they predestinated
[2:48:52] is the only one that is considered in
[2:48:55] water they are the only one that will
[2:48:57] consider in marriage
[2:49:00] because Redemption and marriage goes
[2:49:02] together so marriage is further
[2:49:05] predestinated
[2:49:08] Oh my he said people might be making
[2:49:11] like things they are but the real
[2:49:15] Redemption is those that are water
[2:49:18] because the very word redeem means water
[2:49:22] to redeem something is to bring it back
[2:49:25] to water
[2:49:26] Hallelujah so it is the only
[2:49:30] will be brought back because they are
[2:49:33] they didn't
[2:49:35] that's why we call him our father
[2:49:39] everybody okay everybody okay the bible
[2:49:42] say that when the Gentile heard this
[2:49:45] they were water and glorified the word
[2:49:48] of the Lord as many as were white to
[2:49:52] water
[2:49:52] they did water that's why you believe in
[2:49:56] this message
[2:50:02] everybody okay let's finish with this
[2:50:05] thought
[2:50:06] let's finish with this thought
[2:50:08] the Bible said no man has seen who God
[2:50:12] in at any time the only water began soon
[2:50:15] how many begotten are they one how many
[2:50:18] one
[2:50:20] the only begotten of uh son which is in
[2:50:24] the water of his father
[2:50:29] in the bosom of the father he has done
[2:50:32] water declared him so Jesus was in way
[2:50:36] in the bosom of the father if Jesus had
[2:50:39] a wife where was his wife
[2:50:45] can I continue you are the water
[2:50:49] of who
[2:50:51] wash in the blood of who Christ precious
[2:50:55] and water water
[2:50:57] some of God standing with a water an
[2:51:00] adulterated water
[2:51:03] die he was what by the water of his son
[2:51:06] that became water and water that he may
[2:51:11] take you which way
[2:51:13] in the water after before the water
[2:51:18] the same as him he wants the great
[2:51:21] attribute of God cow water love
[2:51:27] everybody okay Wonder
[2:51:30] could it be already passed could the
[2:51:33] bride already be called is that where we
[2:51:36] are going through today she has to be
[2:51:39] molded and made in the image of war and
[2:51:43] Christ is the water that is the only
[2:51:45] thing it is in there in the Water World
[2:51:48] there cannot be one thing added it can
[2:51:52] be a woman with one hand like a man and
[2:51:55] the other hand like a pal like a donkey
[2:51:58] like like with a power like a dog it's
[2:52:00] got to be exactly the water word of the
[2:52:03] Lord like he is the word the bride is
[2:52:06] part of water the woman is part of what
[2:52:09] the husband because she's taken out of
[2:52:12] her the husband if was part of water
[2:52:15] from his water and so is who
[2:52:18] not taken from water
[2:52:21] but taken from there
[2:52:25] for water
[2:52:27] [Music]

[2:52:47] if he is the word the bread must be
[2:52:50] water

[2:52:59] opened the saddle father and took part
[2:53:01] of his water flesh which was water to
[2:53:04] make water and the bread has to be the
[2:53:07] water for he is what the word she cannot
[2:53:10] stand water she cannot stand on water

[2:53:17] stand alone on water because she is
[2:53:20] taken from who Christ we are the word of

[2:54:54] that's why wisdom is a woman
[2:54:58] that's why there is a woman a wisdom
[2:55:01] that created the world that's why the
[2:55:04] tree of life is male and female

[2:56:23] if you judge it and you say bound
[2:56:26] I Know Who You Are
[2:56:29] not the quality you are
[2:56:32] if you Dim something to be bounded I
[2:56:35] don't have to question Adam when Adam is
[2:56:38] giving the name
[2:56:40] that is exactly me
[2:56:43] it is me giving the name
[2:56:47] [Music]
[2:56:49] let's leave this man
[2:56:52] let's begin to think in Genesis 1.
[2:56:55] because that's where the blessings of
[2:56:58] God are
[2:57:00] and the more you in tune you give
[2:57:02] preeminence to this man
[2:57:04] you will find out that that's why Jesus
[2:57:07] said men Shall Not Be Live by what
[2:57:11] by every
[2:57:13] to show somebody that this one if he's
[2:57:16] corrected I can bring you through the
[2:57:19] wilderness

[2:57:23] the wilderness no if you stay in tune
[2:57:25] with me here I will create bread
[2:57:27] I will create water from a plenty Rock I
[2:57:30] will do miracle
[2:57:32] but this one wants you to go the easy
[2:57:34] route where everything is flourishing
[2:57:36] this one doesn't care which is where
[2:57:39] it's going if it's a Wilderness he
[2:57:41] changed the wilderness
[2:57:44] how was this church when we bought it
[2:57:47] look at this church today
[2:57:49] somebody got the power of transformation
[2:57:55] when you saw this church when we came
[2:57:57] here did you have this in mind this was
[2:58:00] already in the plan of God
[2:58:02] now we're just catching up we even put
[2:58:04] too large speaker here but that was not
[2:58:07] in the mind of God the man of God has
[2:58:08] this
[2:58:09] [Applause]
[2:58:13] you don't suppress God
[2:58:17] [Music]
[2:58:19] you are more than what you think you are
[2:58:22] the wife of Jesus Christ I have many
[2:58:25] courts and plenty stuff I can get to it
[2:58:28] let's pray Heavenly Father
[2:58:30] Lord once again we are approaching you
[2:58:33] this afternoon
[2:58:34] father thanking you for your grace
[2:58:37] for your love
[2:58:38] for your mercy Lord and for everything
[2:58:41] you have been doing for us father thank
[2:58:44] you for opening this word to us that now
[2:58:47] we begin to understand
[2:58:48] why you could give us Direction Even in
[2:58:52] our prayer that when we pray we should
[2:58:55] say our father
[2:58:57] because your father
[2:59:00] is our father
[2:59:02] and you even told us that one day we
[2:59:04] will understand
[2:59:05] that are the father in you and me in you
[2:59:08] until we come to a wrong conclusion that
[2:59:12] all of us were just one
[2:59:14] you just came before us
[2:59:17] to pay the price
[2:59:18] [Music]
[2:59:19] and to make a preparation
[2:59:22] knowing that down the road
[2:59:24] the precious bride will be coming
[2:59:27] but now have come the time of the
[2:59:29] marriage
[2:59:31] that we must find the bread that is
[2:59:34] mature
[2:59:35] abroad that is at your level
[2:59:38] a brand that is nothing but the word of
[2:59:41] God
[2:59:43] and now you unfolded yourself through
[2:59:45] the seals
[2:59:47] to bring in plant view the Plan of
[2:59:49] Redemption
[2:59:50] that we started with you and we will go
[2:59:54] back to you
[2:59:55] and all that you're doing is just
[2:59:57] bringing us back to our original
[2:59:59] position
[3:00:00] because as Adam and Eve live in the
[3:00:03] Garden of Eden now you are ready to live
[3:00:06] with us in the millennium you want your
[3:00:09] wife so that you can introduce us also
[3:00:12] together to leave a thousand year on
[3:00:15] this Earth just like a second Adam
[3:00:18] with his wife Eve
[3:00:20] and to enjoy the blessing of God
[3:00:22] father may you continue to minister to
[3:00:25] your children throughout the week Lord
[3:00:27] May those that didn't catch something as
[3:00:30] they're going back to review this May
[3:00:33] the sin plan with you who they are
[3:00:35] because you say one of these things the
[3:00:38] bride won't know who she is and this is
[3:00:41] the time that we will know who we are
[3:00:43] and we thank you for opening this world
[3:00:45] father bless your children protect us
[3:00:48] Lord continue with us as we commit
[3:00:51] everything unto the hand in the name of
[3:00:54] Jesus Christ
