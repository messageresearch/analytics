[45:24] a man spake like this man that's right
[45:26] you what I can say that tonight there
[45:28] was God had sent a prophet in this hour
[45:31] that he that never have I heard a man
[45:34] Brother Carlos that spake like that man
[45:37] you know why because God was using that
[45:40] man he ordained one man to come and
[45:43] bring us a message in this hour to turn
[45:45] us from where we was not into but away
[45:49] from ain't you glad we have a message
[45:51] that turned us away from all of these
[45:55] things denominational ideas and thoughts
[45:58] and turned us to the pure word of God
[46:01] because Jesus prayed a prayer over me
[46:04] and you he said father I pray that
[46:07] you'll sanctify them through Thy word
[46:11] Thy word is
[46:14] truth and I believe that's what God has
[46:16] sent he sent us a true word in this hour
[46:20] that we can be Sanctified by you know
[46:23] when he when he sent his word and it
[46:25] healed them he sent word in this hour to
[46:28] bring us to the place to where we'd be
[46:31] clean to be able to take a Rapture he
[46:35] sent not just any message he sent a
[46:38] message with rapturing faith and I
[46:40] believe this message I'll type it
[46:41] tonight as the City of
[46:44] Refuge I believe I'm so thankful that
[46:47] God has ordained this there was six
[46:49] cities which they order had around but
[46:52] you know what God said I'm not just
[46:54] going to be in this six cities I'm going
[46:56] to to be the complete Refuge to the
[47:00] Gentiles they won't have to be in a
[47:02] certain town they won't have to be in a
[47:04] certain place but they can be in me
[47:07] because where I am the Eagles will
[47:11] gather oh I'm so tangled for the word of
[47:13] God turn with me to to Exodus chapter 21
[47:18] verse 24 just I'm read a few scriptures
[47:20] and then we'll just let God have his way
[47:24] hey man I tell you what a wonderful
[47:27] thing God has done for us in this
[47:29] hour we don't don't ever don't ever take
[47:33] it lightly don't ever don't ever let it
[47:35] become common to you don't don't ever
[47:38] let it just become just just a
[47:40] ritualistic thing to you it's got to
[47:43] become a living reality to
[47:45] you I'm so thankful that God has sent us
[47:48] the word and it healed us it's healing
[47:52] us to the place to where we are coming
[47:55] to the place back to where the original
[47:58] is a message that would send us back to
[48:00] the truth back to the original you know
[48:04] what was so special about this about the
[48:06] message is so special about it's not
[48:08] that it was it was not about a cloud it
[48:11] was not about a certain place but the
[48:13] message was about Jesus Christ it
[48:16] introduced me to Christ you know what
[48:19] the message is to me it's the Mighty God
[48:22] unveiled he's unveiled himself to me and
[48:25] you in this hour oh I can see clearly
[48:27] now oh I'm so thankful that God has
[48:29] removed all the clouds of doubt and
[48:32] unbelief that we can see more clearly
[48:34] than we ever have Paul said I used to
[48:36] look through a stained glass but
[48:38] there'll be a day and a time come and
[48:40] that's I believe is right now that we
[48:42] are seeing clearly what is going
[48:46] on Amen we won't be caught unaware in
[48:49] this time we see that we see that it
[48:52] come to a place that that that where
[48:55] that the the uh Israelites got to so
[48:58] they were so so uh caught up in in in
[49:01] this and there was the law an eye for an
[49:04] eye and a tooth for a tooth it was Man's
[49:06] Revenge for man and God had to do
[49:09] something God had to bring a supreme
[49:12] judge he had to bring a a thing to where
[49:14] it could be set before not just one man
[49:16] avenging another man but the where they
[49:19] would had to come before and be judge if
[49:21] it was right if it was a accident or
[49:23] whatever happened that's why God sent
[49:25] Jesus Christ because because man had
[49:27] messed this up but we see that here that
[49:30] he had they they they got to such a
[49:32] place I believe brother Steven to a
[49:34] place to where they was enjoying this
[49:36] they was enjoying an eye for an eye and
[49:38] a tooth for a tooth they would they they
[49:41] was they was taking pleasure in this and
[49:43] God said wait a minute I have to I'm
[49:45] going to make a place where a man if he
[49:47] makes a mistake you know what we was not
[49:50] we was not we was forced into this
[49:53] marriage this first marriage we we was
[49:55] we was we was red into this that's right
[49:58] we was overtaken we we didn't go into
[50:01] this willfully we was deceived when it
[50:04] fall in the garden BR a deception and we
[50:06] come into this wedding and God had to
[50:08] send a place that mean you could come to
[50:11] and have a place of safety in a place of
[50:14] atonement in a place that we could be
[50:16] that we could be righteous like him
[50:19] because the only way that we could be
[50:20] righteous we had to be in him and he had
[50:23] to send an atonement on Calvary and shed
[50:25] his blood that mean you could run into
[50:27] this city which is Jesus Christ and be
[50:31] saved oh I'm so thankful for that you
[50:34] know I'm so thankful because I like what
[50:36] the scripture said he took it even front
[50:38] that God said vengeance is mine sayith
[50:40] the Lord we're not wrestling against
[50:42] flesh and blood we're wrestling against
[50:45] principalities and spiritual wickedness
[50:47] in high places a lot of the high places
[50:49] is in people's mind because the Bible
[50:52] say as a man thinketh so is
[50:55] he oh Hallelujah now the Lord when he
[50:59] gave this law concerning the Cities of
[51:02] Refuge he took advantage of their deep
[51:05] rooted love for the system of Revenge by
[51:09] the nearest blood relative and God acted
[51:12] wisely in this he always does in all
[51:15] things instead of refusing the Jews what
[51:18] they had regarded as such a privilege of
[51:21] taking Vengeance he said on their
[51:23] brothers God rendered it almost
[51:26] impossible that a man should be killed
[51:28] unless he was a murderer for he
[51:31] appointed six cities at a good distance
[51:34] so that when a man killed another by
[51:37] accident and so committed that he could
[51:40] once flee to there to those cities that
[51:43] he might stay there for the rest of his
[51:45] life until the high priest died yet the
[51:48] Avenger of the blood could never touch
[51:50] him unless he left the
[51:52] city oh my
[51:57] I have no desire to leave the
[51:59] city hey the Avenger is still there what
[52:02] people don't realize brothers and
[52:04] sisters is the Avenger is still outside
[52:07] the city waiting on you to
[52:13] leave oh I'm so thankful for the grace
[52:16] of God that he would open this up to us
[52:18] and let us see we don't have to leave
[52:21] we're in the place God has ordained us
[52:23] to be he has set us in Heavenly places
[52:26] is in Christ Jesus where can we go as
[52:30] Peter said to whom shall we go for thou
[52:33] Hast the words of eternal
[52:36] life that's what this message is is the
[52:38] words of eternal life to me and you this
[52:41] is the message Jesus Christ the same
[52:45] yesterday today and
[52:51] forever and I'm so thankful that God is
[52:55] giv us this
[52:57] opportunity to be in this city of Refuge
[53:01] let's look at this city just for a
[53:03] minute you know
[53:04] that that that the
[53:07] Avenger you know that he was a near
[53:10] Kinsman boy a't you glad have the
[53:12] problem how would we have know that
[53:14] Satan was a more near Kinsman to us if
[53:16] he wouldn't have told
[53:18] us I mean we I mean how would we have
[53:22] know those things I like what the what
[53:25] the Unix said to Philip when he come to
[53:27] him he said I read these things but how
[53:30] can I understand Lisa man show me you
[53:34] know what God's always had an order and
[53:36] he always sent a prophet he revealed his
[53:39] word to a
[53:41] prophet he has never
[53:43] changed he never will change he cannot
[53:47] change that's why God had to send a
[53:50] prophet in this
[53:54] hour oh Hallelujah yes a you thankful
[53:57] for the truth he said You shall know the
[54:00] truth that means you'll become part of

[54:08] open yes sir and you'll see the truth
[54:11] and it shall make you

[54:20] was
[54:21] Satan through our first birth from the
[54:24] fall in the garden right he was nearer
[54:27] we would have never knew that but he
[54:30] didn't want us

[54:35] a
[54:36] savior and we Reed Jesus

[54:42] Boaz he accepted all of mine and your
[54:46] shame and all of our sins and all of our
[54:49] problems and all of our mistakes and all
[54:51] of our things that we had he took it all
[54:54] to Calvary and buried it beneath the
[54:57] blood of Jesus Christ he didn't hold
[54:59] back not one thing from
[55:02] us a nearer ain't you glad that there
[55:05] was one that said come on in here with
[55:06] me come in me he just open he just

[1:01:28] right I'm not going to read in in in in
[1:01:31] in in second Samuel here from it but
[1:01:33] there was a there was a there was a
[1:01:35] great fight that Abner and joab they
[1:01:39] said let the men fight Among Us let the
[1:01:42] young men
[1:01:43] wrestle and it become a big Slaughter
[1:01:47] and Abner there was a great there was a
[1:01:49] great loss going on for admer so he fled
[1:01:53] he fled but he knew that if he could get
[1:01:56] to that City heon they had to stop but
[1:01:59] he had what was it it was joab's brother
[1:02:03] was following him he said stop go back
[1:02:06] I'm through I'm not I'm just
[1:02:08] illustrating I don't want no more war go
[1:02:11] away least I have to kill
[1:02:14] you and he kept coming and he killed him
[1:02:17] he Smit smoted him under the fifth
[1:02:20] rib and joab was coming too but his
[1:02:23] brother was much faster than him and
[1:02:26] what Happ to run into the city of Hebron
[1:02:28] and joab had to stop because there was a
[1:02:32] law oh my many have been slain in this
[1:02:35] battle but we have a city that we can
[1:02:37] run
[1:02:38] into but you know
[1:02:41] what joab was very deceptive man that's
[1:02:44] right a very deceiving man what did he
[1:02:48] do he knew he couldn't go in the city
[1:02:50] and bring Abner out so he sent
[1:02:53] Messengers in huh that's what Satan's
[1:02:56] done he sent Messengers in around the
[1:02:58] message to try to get you to come out
[1:03:01] come on out come on out and I said no
[1:03:04] not me I cannot leave I've been ordained
[1:03:08] to stay
[1:03:10] here you have been ordained here for
[1:03:15] this he said come on out then he kept
[1:03:18] sending them in and finally adner he
[1:03:20] come he said tell him no more war
[1:03:22] between me and you let us make a
[1:03:24] friendship after ad done talk to David
[1:03:27] see how he waited to the after he'd been
[1:03:29] talking to the king to think try to make
[1:03:31] him think everything's okay that's how
[1:03:34] Satan is he wants you to make you think
[1:03:36] everything's okay I don't mind if you
[1:03:38] read a few quotes I don't mind if you do
[1:03:41] just come on back out come on
[1:03:45] back oh my brother how deceptive it is
[1:03:49] right and then here he said a man tells
[1:03:51] him to come out and this messenger tells
[1:03:53] him ain't no comes to him meet meet him
[1:03:56] here so hner comes out and meets and he
[1:03:59] meets joah he tells him you know
[1:04:01] everything's all right and he gets up
[1:04:04] close to him like he's going to hug him
[1:04:06] and and welcome him brother Robert and
[1:04:08] he stabs him and he kills him that's
[1:04:12] right and it brings grief to the
[1:04:14] king because why he killed innocent
[1:04:17] blood that's right that made the king
[1:04:21] but you know what the Bible said and
[1:04:22] David said the king said about that he
[1:04:24] said Abner died as one of the foolish
[1:04:28] men of Israel because he listened to the
[1:04:32] messengers of
[1:04:34] joab Brothers we don't need to have our
[1:04:36] ears open to that we don't need to have
[1:04:39] keep our minds on those things we keep
[1:04:41] our mind in this message we keep
[1:04:43] listening to the tapes we keep reading
[1:04:45] the Bible we keep praying because what
[1:04:48] it is it's lying upon line precept upon
[1:04:51] precept here a little there a little
[1:04:55] ain't you glad that God has given us the
[1:04:57] ability to lend a death a a death ear to
[1:05:00] joab's
[1:05:02] Messengers be careful who tries to be
[1:05:05] your
[1:05:06] friend I seen a little thing that my
[1:05:09] wife had it was a woman talking to
[1:05:10] another woman but the shadow of the
[1:05:12] light cast and it seen that this the
[1:05:15] shadow of the other woman she was
[1:05:17] talking to was acting like it was her
[1:05:18] friend was the shadow of a snake
