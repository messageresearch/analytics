for uh last sunday and i think the words are fitting concerning what we go through and that god is a very present god in our times of need and how mighty he is so it's just a melody that is really easy to catch on so if you if it catches you just sing along with with me tonight [Music] is your name jehovah's your name your name [Music] my team [Music] your name [Music] [Music] over is your name

jehovah jireh is our provider and our provider in battle think of it like mighty warrior in battle he's our provider in battle despite jesus our savior amen amen praise the lord god bless you everyone it's a privilege again to stand here all by god's grace we had um practiced this song for new year's eve we ran out of time and we haven't practiced since then so by god's help we'll just give him our best amen we have to be in season and out of season but um this song came in our hearts two wednesdays ago as we were receiving the word and god's grace is so much expressed and revealed to us as brazilian singers in the service how could we not or how could we do something contrary to someone that loves us so much the least we can do is just give everything we have and that's that's what this song is about [Music] i've seen a vision harsh and sweet one who gave all he had for me i've seen the passion of his death and the forgiveness in his final breath no i could never be the same my heart has been forever changed i want to live and love and give because he gave oh now i'm giving my life away laying it down on the altar now i'm giving my life away the very least i can offer is my own so here i stand today giving my life away no earthly price could be too great no sacrifice too much to make [Music] the cost next to the blood of cal freeze cross so if i live i'll live for him or if i die i'll count it as gain my life is not my own but his from this day on now i'm [Music] now i am giving my life away the very least i can offer is my own so here i stand today giving my life away [Music] now i am giving my life away it out on the altar now i'm giving my life the away least i can offer is my own so here i stand today giving my life away so here i stand today giving my life away [Music] so here i stand today giving my life away [Applause] [Music] hallelujah amen i wonder if you all can just stand with me this evening and as this song says giving my life away i wonder if we could just give ourselves away before we call the minister this evening we'll just do this last song [Music] i give myself away so you can use me i give myself [Music] give myself a wish [Music] now just raise your hands and testify this next part is [Music] is [Music] one more time my life is [Music] myself [Music] [Laughter] so you can [Music] oh [Music] one more time without the music i give myself away i give myself away as our brother comes this evening [Music] i give myself away i give myself away give myself away [Music] so you can use me hallelujah do you give yourself away or have you done that amen blessed be the name of the lord give the lord a clap of him not me the lord hallelujah [Music] amen amen amen good to see you all tonight welcome into the house of the lord and good to see our family member we don't have visitors here we got a family member so brother aaron and your family god richly bless you go to fellowship together amen hallelujah and we still have brother joe back there from canada amen and his wife sister katia welcome again god bless you hallelujah [Applause] we spoke about the church age book and it's only one person that requested it so you all know all about the church ages right right so please see the deacon as soon as possible and give your name so we can order the books okay amen normally every single young man here young sisters especially because usually the brother read the word the system in the message sometimes they feel like no in the kitchen things like that you know the place of a woman in the kitchen [Laughter] amen amen so make sure everybody if you need it put your name not gonna pay for it i will be paying for it but if you get it make sure you read it there are four books if you get them down in this message you can begin to soar you want to know them if i tell you are you going to read them if you get the seven church ages especially the book there is a lot of scripture there that brother branham gave that can build your foundation very good and the way i want you to do it not just take the book and read it you know when you take the church age book make sure your bible is assad so when brother branham give a scripture stop don't move forward open the scripture i'm just giving you great keys amen if not you're going to be waiting for me to give you everything and then you're wasting your time amen you need to build your own spiritual life yourself you might be seated so you don't just stay long too amen so i know a lot of folks are not here tonight but by god's quest they will be following online so make sure when you read your church age book have your bible if brother branham says second corinthians 4 just stop open second corinthians 4 read it prayerfully and you will see sometimes it might take you an hour to read one page then you know you're really getting into it you cannot read it like a newspaper if you just read it through boom you don't understand what is going on this word is something you know how long it take me to read the bible it might take me four hours to read two verses okay okay so if you tell me you read the whole chapter in two minutes something is wrong amen it's not a newspaper so when i when you get your church age book put your bible aside read it slowly even if you don't understand that's fine that's where the question comes amen i was talking to uh to a young man and i told him i said the way we were trained and the way we ask question in the message because we have a session of question and answer we were reading the word everybody got it and then we read the message then we come up with questions from the message and from the word that's how you're going to grow not going on the internet and reading everything on the internet and pulling questions from the internet or somebody says this there is a historian that says this those are not stuff you need to put your hair there put your head in the word read the bible and come with a bible question read the message or listen to the message then you come up with a question from the message those are the questions that will make the inner man grow not reading everything in the message you go read about the history of india the history of this then you come up with a question i have a question that says this no no that's not the correct way read the bible read the message brother branham say put your head in the word amen so we need the church book that's the first book the second one is the seals amen the third one is adoption there is like four or five of them amen but there is a book where they combine all those sermons together everybody then the last one is the 70 weeks of daniel if you line up those four books we can sit with you seven hours and we can be like fishes in the water amen even if you don't understand anything just read those books if you finish them praise the lord you will understand me later after you finish it you will say pastor thank you god richly bless you amen so take those free time you spend on facebook on the message i mean uh on the telephone three hours begin to read two two pages two pages and you will see how much the holy ghost is going to unfold to you amen but but god's going to make sure you put your name before we order it once we order it you're on your own amen i'm trying to help you up amen blessed be the name of the lord please remember brother dwayne thomas he's still in the hospital he was diagnosed to the best of my understanding with cancer so make sure we keep him in prayer amen he's not doing good you know brother duane the majority of you we used to pray with him together in the old church so make sure you keep him in prayer so that the lord can intervene in a miraculous way amen the brother robert told me about the sisters the young sisters meeting i don't know how many young sisters are available but if you want a meaning you need to talk together make sure we have enough young sister to sit down and put your question in the box if you don't want anybody to read them bring it to me directly so we can get prepared get the date and sit with the young sister and go over your question amen blessed be the name of the lord how many remember the good samaritan you know all about it you can preach about it do you remember the seals now it's easy see i told you how many read revelation 6 okay praise god i am so happy amen now for this oncoming sunday lord's willing i am begging you read exodus chapter 26 if you want to put it down exodus chapter 26 read it if you can read it three times and maybe 95 of the time you would not understand what you're reading that's okay i just want you to read it and have the material ready because if you don't read it on sunday you can get lost very easily because it's a territory you have not got into it yet amen exodus 36. we're still on the lever but we're going to dig deep in the table in the tabernacle amen so make sure you're going to see seven qubits six cubits or stuff like that just read it the first time read it the second time read it the third time make sure you really get the material down that's all i want you to do if the holy ghost begin to unfold the word that's good praise the lord call me you say pastor i got a revelation look at this i will incorporate it amen amen so make sure exodus chapter 26 read exodus chapter 26 you who are online read exodus chapter 26 i don't want to be like last sunday few people raid the seals and then you begin to stay amen exodus chapter 26 and i'm warning you when you read it most of the stuff will not make sense exodus chapter 26 if you open your bible he will say moreover that shall make the tabernacle with 10 curtains that's how we start amen so if you didn't read it when i'm going to speak about it you'll be lost so read it pray about it come on sunday and let's see what the holy spirit will be doing amen please read it i say it and i say it again please read it blessed be the name of the lord i am not preaching here tonight brother samuel will be preaching tonight so you know brother sam already he's one of our local minister so we fell on our heart that he need to be ministering tonight and lord's willing sooner we will get the young preacher that popped up on new year's eve no more 10 minutes now did he run away no more 10 minutes now amen if you feel like you need 30 minutes you let me know so i can land two or three of you 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes if you feel like you need an hour let me know so you get a whole full hour and if you if it gets really good you continue more than an hour so it will be fine amen so now your life have changed it's not on your own give your life away amen so spend some time and begin to meditate on the word of god spend your time praying and the holy spirit will begin to flow his messages through you according to your gift and the lord will use him mildly i'm in a mighty way i don't want you to waste your time i want you to have your feet standing here stop preaching the gospel get you really really deep and then you move on so if there is an open door somewhere in the sisters church around us here you can go and start ministering amen and work for the kingdom of god so make sure you get yourself really really really deep into the word and once you out then we will see again screen the congregation and see if we have preachers again and then pull them out over there it's a kingdom of melchizedek everybody will be serving the lord amen if the entire congregation of brothers are going to be minister praise the lord amen so make sure you stop praying 30 minutes or one hour or an hour and 30 minutes you let me know and then we line you up amen praise god 2022 blessed be the name of the lord let's stand and we'll call brother the same hallelujah 10 minutes was easy [Music] now it's 30 or an hour amen if you know how to put your car in mutual like you did it the first time you will see the holy spirit taking over and it's not going to be you working you will see the lord leading you amen and before you know it you know how to push the gear amen let's sing only believe as brother sam comes tonight [Music] it [Music] all things [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now [Music] foreign [Music] so [Music] amen i was gonna try to sing another song but i'm not gonna be brave like brother craig [Laughter] god bless you be seated just for a minute i just wanted to thank brother shambo for that message on sunday amen brother kelly when i went to the ball games the young boy if they said it was going to be a double header hey man well we had a double header on sunday amen and he has nothing to apologize for if anybody wants brother shambo to apologize for what happened sandy just come see me i got a quote for you i got a quote for you brother brown was preaching one time and he started to apologize for keeping the congregation too long and he said no no no i'm not gonna do it i got that quote you want it just see me oh it was delicious so so the the other night theresa said to me you wanna you wanna listen to some of that tape i said yeah we'll sit down we'll listen about a half hour you know and then we'll maybe listen more the next night we listened all three hours it was so yummy we couldn't quit so we just appreciate you brother brother shambo uh he's got a real gift and uh you know my pastor back home ron walbert a very uh dedicated sincere man of god and he told me thank you better have too much water than not enough and brother abel where you at this one's clean on the outside amen and uh anyways my pastor told me he said he said a good teacher will take complicated topics and make them simple if you sit down you listen to a teacher for an hour and a half and you go and say boy that guy's got a lot of knowledge he didn't help you but when he takes things like what was the numbers 26 exodus 26 and he tells you when you read it you're not going to understand it but read it anyways that's because he's going to break it down and make it so it is understandable so if we just do our part and then he does his part and the holy spirit will do his part and we'll be saying i'm so glad i'm a part of the family of god i've been washed in the fountain cleansed by his blood [Music] join heirs with jesus as we not when we get over there join heirs with jesus as we travel this side i'm so glad i'm a part of the family uh are you glad [Applause] if you're glad let's sing it together i'm so glad i'm a part of the family of god i've been washed in this fountain cleansed by his blood joint heirs with jesus as we travel this side for i'm part of the family the family of god amen we don't have visitors just family members and i have a couple family members that i believe are listening in my son and his wife kathy are listening in tonight and so i certainly do appreciate that and i hope they got a notebook open and if they have any questions they write down the questions and then we'll take them back into the bible and we'll make it simple for them see the gospel is not difficult and the gospel is good news and the gospel has come to set us free so if you're all bound up in your religious beliefs you don't have the gospel and we just want to keep the gospel so simple and so plain and so full of honey you see the thing of it is people want to give a lot of honey but they don't want to put it in the right place see the shepherd when they would get the honey they would put the honey on the limestone okay because in the limestone there's minerals so that when your belly's not feeling good if the if the shepherd puts the honey on the limestone they lick the honey but they're getting the limestone and that's what's settling their stomachs and that's what makes the word of god digestible and that's what makes you want to come back for more and for more and for more and i'm just trying to share with you friends that if you don't have a burden in your heart to be in church every time those doors are open get back to the altar quickly we are living in the last of the last times [Music] and remember from from the little uh exhortation we gave the other night that the that the seventh that the first church age messenger paul exhorted us the seventh church age that as we see that day approaching that we assemble ourselves all the more and and not to stay out now if you if you can't get to church on wednesday night and you gotta stream that's okay i believe the holy spirit can visit you where you're at because he's a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart but i want to tell you something if you're staying home when you could be here what you're doing is you're getting a cold shower instead of getting a warm shower i just like smiles you all got beautiful smiles you know that hey man isn't god good to us and so i'm glad to have billy and kathy aboard with us tonight and i trust the lord will uh share something that will be uh edifying to them if you could turn with me to the book of ephesians and keep in mind that the book of ephesians brother brown taught us is a parallel to the book of joshua and the book of joshua we know it wasn't the great heavens but it was the it was the traveling through the promised land and we're traveling through a promised land how many of us have been promised the gift of the holy ghost let me ask again let me see a show of hands how many of us have been promised the gift of the holy ghost all right so you've repented of your sins and you've been baptized in the name of jesus christ and you received a promise that you would receive the holy ghost now the holy ghost is the literal life of jesus christ just just keep that in your thoughts and what i want to do is just read this scripture so that we can get started and you can be seated all right verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the lord verse i say ephesians 6 verse 10. i apologize okay everybody's page is turning and we're good all right and uh finally my brethren be strong in the lord be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we're not wrestling against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places you remember john said the high places be mid low and the low place would be made high he said as those pharisees that was coming there to the baptism and he said you go and bring forth fruit meat to repentance these high places are are our liars that are in the pulpit who say they're apostles but you've tried them and found out that they're not but what we want is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth okay here we go high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day amen remember satan is the god of this evil age and we are living right now in satan's eden satan's eden is being manifested here on the flesh and as satan came in and defiled god's uh child in the garden of eden now god is coming into satan's eden he's getting into our moral flesh he's perfecting our spirit his spirit his spirit now listen to that it's his spirit being perfected in us while we are in our mortal bodies in satan's eden all right now we're painting a picture because you got to have a vision if we're going to make a stand then we've got to have a vision of what we're standing for amen so here we go we know where we're at we know what we're doing and we and we know we know the uh the the tricks of the devil all right and we have the the devil's answer he said stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all take the shield of faith whereby you're able to quench the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god and probably this is the most important part saints and that is to be praying always praying always your personal communication with god cannot be over emphasized paul said it like this he said pray without ceasing when you're washing the dishes be in prayer when you're driving down the road in your car be in prayer when you're when you're doing your job whatever you're doing do it prayerfully do everything you do not and with lip service as unto men but as you're serving god to everything motivated by that same intensity that you want to serve god in everything that you do no matter what it is and we can take time with that but let's move on prayer prayer pray praying always in all prayer with and supplication in the spirit and watching with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints now see here let me just finish reading you can be seated okay and let's turn quickly to romans chapter 12. romans chapter 12 and we'll read this and let you be seated all right now he said i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you might prove what is the good and acceptable and the perfect will of god lord add a blessing to the reason of his word and may he help us now as we look to him to help us to understand what he would have us to know tonight in jesus name you can be seated now i want to take a text tonight standing with understanding standing but we have to know what we're standing about we have to know why we're standing how we're standing what the consequences of uh uh uh uh of it is for us to make a stand you didn't join just a little boy scout troop when you came to be a christian this is god's army we can already look back into the scriptures and we see at one time god chose to deliver jane deliver james unto death and then the very next uh scripture in the bible when herod saw that it pleased the jews he takes peter he puts him into jail and and god sends an angel into the jail cell to deliver peter we are soldiers in the army of god there's told a story and i heard it long ago don't even know where i heard it but it rings true in my heart and it was about a a a kingdom it was a small kingdom it was in the medieval times and they were up on us on a side of a cliff in a in in like a uh a bay of an ocean and so the only way that you could get to this city was to come at it by a boat and it was just a small kingdom just a small kingdom and they lived peaceably amongst themselves and there was a an army that was coming through that area brother stephen and they were just destroying everything in the way like a bunch of locusts they was just looking up everything along the way and so they come to this little kingdom they saw that kingdom on top of the hill and they said you know what that's an easy little thing for us to go up there and take and so they sent uh emissaries up to talk to that king and they said now look you're just a small kingdom and we've already taken out this empire and we've taken out that empire and we've done this and done that so we're going to give you a chance you can just surrender you can just surrender and then nobody will get hurt and the king thought he said well he says i understand that he said but he said and that's that's a nice nice view to do that for us he said but before you leave before you leave i just want you to witness one thing for me and they said okay and so he brought his army in a ray and they're all there with their swords up and their spears and their shields and uh and they're all just straighten attention whenever the king would say something they would do exactly what the king said if he said march they marched if he said stan they stand and then he turned around to one soldier and he said you sir yes sir and he come running i was in the army i'm sure he didn't say sir yes sir but that's the way it comes to me sir yes sir and so you're coming yes here i am i'm a soldier he said now i want you to run off that hill and give your life for this kingdom and without even batting an eye that man saluted the king and off he went and he jumped off the ledge and now he said to the emissaries that came he said now you go tell your leaders we're not going we're not going to surrender and if you decide that you want to try to come up these hills and take us every one of these men will do the same thing that that man just did so they seen them go down the hills and they got into their boats and they went back and you know what they saw they looked over the bay and those ships turned around and they just sailed out another way the dedication of one man saved the entire nation and friends that's the intensity that we have we're in this fight for the lord you remember what the lord shared with us the other day just one person getting out of cater if you sit in church half-hearted and you're not paying attention and you're not getting into the spirit then you're not going to understand what's going on brother branham said if you get into a symphony you have to get into the spirit of the symphony or you're not going to be able to understand the symphony and remember what we're talking about tonight we're talking about taking a stand for jesus but we're trying to take it with an understanding and we evaluate the cost and we don't want to enter into a battle with anybody without were willing to pay the price whatever the price is our brothers and our sisters went on before us and they loved not their lives unto death now being a christian takes a commitment amen it takes a commitment and and jesus said this he said he said love the lord your god with all your mind with all your heart and with all your soul what else is left let's do it again all your mind all your heart all your soul you don't want to be conformed to this world you want to be transformed by the renewing of your mind [Music] paul said with my mind i serve the law of god with my flesh the law of sin who will deliver me from the body of this death i said he said thank god through jesus christ my lord and because that he made that dedicated decision he could go on to write there is therefore now no condemnation that's a judgment there's no judgment to those who are in christ jesus who don't walk after the flesh but they walk after the spirit now if you get over into romans chapter 12 and you look at this word for transformed do you know that word is only used one other time in the new testament that greek word for transformed is the same word that was used in matthew 17 when jesus christ went up to the mount of transfiguration and it was transfigured before peter james and john and that's what we're coming to saints now see this this this taking a stand number one we have to take it individually each individual has got to be completely surrendered and totally dedicated and i don't want to be dedicated just to to some uh uh some some personality cult i am dedicated to one thing and that is to the manifestation of jesus christ in this flesh right here i am not going to be satisfied until when i look into the mirror of the word every aspect of it without a without a jot without without a blemish without a wrinkle without a spot it has to be perfectly jesus christ made manifest and when that spirit is made manifest what he does is he takes you and he sets you apart up on mount transfiguration and that's the adoption and then friends let me tell you something when you become adopted into the kingdom you're not only heirs but joint heirs do you remember what a hazardous told esther when she she came in and he reached out the golden scepter he said i'll give you up to the half of the kingdom now that didn't mean she was going to own the eastern half and he was going to own the western half that meant everything that she said in the kingdom was just as good as if a hazardous said it in the kingdom and when you become to so dedicated to the lord jesus christ i mean dedicated which one of your wives wants your husband to be 99 dedicated to you put your hand up 99 you 199. you agree with 99. all right let me repeat the question all right you didn't hear the question there's a lot of grace in this house so don't worry i don't know how many times i sat back there and gave the wrong answer let me ask theresa teresa would you be happy if your husband was dedicated to you 99 percent of the time no and you know i wouldn't be happy if she was dedicated to me 99 of the time it's a total look friends we've got to get our eyes off of the world [Music] can i say it like this let me say it like this let me say it like this i want to make this very simple get your face in the book and when you have your face in the book you don't have time for that other thing [Music] well praise the lord that was free of charge so we're see here's the thing that satan does is he gets us so tied up and worrying about what is not truth we don't study what is true that's why the pastor is sitting here telling you read your bible read the messages [Music] do you know when they send these people to school to study counterfeit money they don't show them any counterfeit money they don't show them any counterfeit money they study the real money they study the real money so much if there's just a little deviation to it they say that's counterfeit get your eyes off the antichrist and they're gonna help you to know what's wrong with his ministry and what's wrong with that ministry i want to know what is right with what i believe [Applause] i'm taking a stand for jesus and i'm letting the world go by [Music] brother robert i read about a man one time that loved charlie chapman he loved charlie chapman brother abel he studied charlie chapman so much that the way charlie chapman walked he walked and the way charlie chapman talked he talked and the way charlie chapman dressed he dressed that's what religious people do that's what religious people do that's what religious people do they study the bible they know how to say the right things they know how to be in the right places at the right times and he said that he so perfected the life of charlie chapman the way that he walked in the way that he talked and he combed his hair the same way and he brushed his teeth the same way that was free of charge that the people who knew charlie chapman if they was to put charlie chapman here and this man right here they couldn't tell you which one was which yes but see the two spirits will be so close it would deceive the very elect if it's possible but we've got a blood test if they take the blood out of charlie chapman and they take the blood out of this man it's going to say wrong dna if they take the blood out of a baptist and they take it out of christ it's going to come up wrong a dna if they take the blood out of a message believer and they take the blood out of jesus christ it's going to come up wrong dna there's people that fell in love with the prophet and they so imitated the prophet that they could walk around with a eagle bub buckle and they could keep a bible up underneath their hands they'll listen to the tapes but my bible tells me brother stephen that you cannot add to or take away one word from the book if you add to the book the plagues that are in the book will be added unto you brother greg and if you take away from the book then your name will be taken out of the book of life so what are they going to do when they say we believe malachi 4 5 and 6 but we don't need pastors and we don't need teachers and we don't need evangelists and all you've got to do is get to a tape recorder and hit play they're leaving the scripture unkept and it's got to be every word don't you leave nothing out of there it's all got to be fulfilled jesus said i didn't come to destroy the law and the prophets he came to fulfill the law and the prophets he said heavens and earth would pass away but my word would never pass away and so i asked teresa one time about my friend here with charlie chapman i said what would it be if charlie chapman was in trouble and somebody was trying to find him so that they could shoot him do you think this guy's going to stand around looking like charlie chapman he's gonna go change his clothes he's gonna comb his hair different but when you have the literal life of jesus christ living inside of you then the works that he did shall you do also and when it comes to time to taking a stand you'll be like daniel they said now look at daniel if you keep on praying the way you're praying we're going to put you into the lion's den didn't shake daniel do you know what daniel did come time to pray out in the public and so the little tattletails came down it up took him drug him down before the cat oh daniel what are you doing this for they put him into the lion's den daniel didn't flinch daniel didn't flinch do you realize that he understood the consequences of taking a stand and he chose to take the stand now friends this is what i want to come across crystal clear tonight you cannot resolve in your mind peter tried to do it brother stephen he said if they kill you they'll kill me first and jesus turned around and looked at him he said before the crows you'll deny me three times oh not me no no no not me but what happened brother stephen the crew and how many times did peter deny the christ oh my but that predestinated seed that was in peter and when he came up on the resurrection and he told mary she said go tell my disciples and peter he wanted to make sure peter knew even though he made mistakes he was still included in the grace of god so don't ever give up if you've got a hunger if you've got a thirst if you've got a just a craving in your heart that you want to be like jesus christ i don't care if you fall 100 times tomorrow you get up 101 time and you keep pressing on paul said uh uh uh forgetting forgetting the things that are behind he said i press on to the mark of the high calling and the high calling is the literal life of jesus christ come back into the believers brother branham said it like this and christ is the mystery of god revealed he said it's not a life that you live he said it's not a life that you live he said it's a life that comes in you and lives himself out through you so just get it settled in your heart you're going to dedicate yourself to the lord jesus christ come hell or high water if i make my bed in hell lo thou art there [Music] our god is an awesome god so we have as individuals we dedicate ourselves to god but friend god is not coming for individuals he's coming for a body a body thou has prepared for me and that's why why uh uh the the uh and let's go to ephesians chapter four and let's see how god is doing this ephesians chapter four amen god is good with supplication for all the saints when our when our body when our when our brothers and our sisters have a problem we have a problem let's just read this for a minute now ephesians chapter 4 he says i therefore paul i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called that word vocation is the calling the calling many are called but few are chosen but your calling you make your calling and your election sure and how do you make your calling and election sure by examining your life with every word that's in the bible and not being satisfied until every ounce of your attitude every every aspect of your character and your conduct is in perfect alignment with him that's exactly right we pray like this at the home uh when when we pray in the morning we say lord jesus you come into our house you're welcome in our house you walk down the corridors of our conduct and into the chambers of our attitudes and if you see anything in my conduct or in my attitude that's not pleasing to you and remember what he said peter said that a meek and a quiet spirit was of great price in the sight of the lord christian people are not people who are constantly trying to have their own way they'll always let look at abraham abraham said to lot he said if you go to the right i'll go to the left if you go to the left i'll go to the right always prefer your brother and if you don't have a spirit that's always preferring your brother don't condemn yourself just come come back to jesus christ and say lord i don't think i'm quite lined up in that aspect and i need you thine is the kingdom thine is the power thine is the glory i want his kingdom inside of me we know his kingdom is joy peace and righteousness and the holy ghost and i should have a skip in my step and a smile on my face through every aspect of my life when the wind is blowing in my direction i should be happy when the wind is blowing against me i should be happy when things are going my way i'm happy when things aren't going my way i'm happy and when things are going crazy all around you and you don't understand just stand paul said when you've done all that you can do to stand just stand have your loins gird about with truth now your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace have on the breastplate of righteousness and the helmet of salvation did you catch that children of melchizedek the breastplate of what your feet shot with what preparation of the gospel of peace your kings you're priests you're chosen of god we found out that we had another whole generation we belong to we don't even have to look to our mommy and our daddy anymore we don't have any beginning of days or ending of life oh my oh my god well if that don't make you happy i don't know what else to do for you with all lowliness and meekness with long-suffering forbearing one another and look what paul's doing he says endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit remember the church was perfected on the day of pentecost they were in one mind one heart and one accord but we found out from the teaching on sunday that when jesus went up judas went down and when jesus came back down jews came back up amen and we saw him manifested you know you can see judas manifested almost immediately because when peter and john go down through the gate called beautiful and he they tell the lame man so silver and gold have i none but such as i have in the name of jesus christ judas's buddies the one that he gave the silver to so that he could uh betray jesus christ they're there to condemn peter and john for doing what for preaching in the name of jesus christ and told him don't you preach in that name oh and then he worms his way in further i can't wait to hear the rest of that story we'll leave that to the teacher amen but there's a whole lot more to that now look endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit now if we're going to keep the unity of the spirit that means you have to have the spirit read that it's not a small s it's capital s capital s you have to have the spirit you have to have the spirit and we're all in the same spirit we all will have the mind of jesus christ what's the pastor been telling us let the mind that was in christ jesus be also in you who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god you say brother sam i can think myself equal with god if i said it it wouldn't be worth anything but jesus is one that said that in that day and that day is this day that i will be in the father the father will be in in me i will be in you and you will be in me and it was john who said greater is he who is in you than he that is in the world not greater is he that will be in you greater is he that is in you and did you ever notice that when jesus when when the disciples are talking about peter but about jesus it's always in the present tense look at john in first john chapter 3 he said now are you the sons of god it does not yet appear what you shall be but we know that when he shall appear that we shall be like him for we will see him as he is now if you want to see you the way you are then what you do is you go and you look into a mirror and if you want to see him the way he is then you want to look into the mirror of the word my little granddaughter came up to me the last time i was up there in maryland and she said unto me she says well poppy she says my sister does this and that and the other and my brother does this that and the other and she says i'm the only one to turn down all right i said well lisa honey that's awful nice i said but you're not supposed to compare yourself against your brother or against your sister i said you're supposed to compare yourself against jesus i said how you doing now oh poppy [Laughter] there's none of us righteous no not one we all must die romans 7 paul brings it out so beautifully in romans 7 9 brother brahm said not just not just put aside to the occasion hang it up in a closet that nature that you were born with must die just like that brazen serpent that hung up on the on the pole it was dead and it was our sins was judged that's why it was brass remember the brazen labor is in the outer court where the judgments take place and and we have got to judge ourselves dead and anything about that nature that we was born with the personality whatever it is it has to die and we must come into the unity of the faith and we must come into the bond of peace and the unity of the spirit endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit for there's only one body one body it's many members but by one spirit we're all baptized into now what is that spirit we say it's god but what is god perfect love perfect love amen perfect love can you imagine jesus the lord of all and he allowed a man to spit in his face and while as the spittle is dropping down off of his face there was no bitterness in his eyes brother jumbo he had dove's eyes he had gentle eyes he had eyes of peace he was he pitied that man he wept over jerusalem now friends we're talking about the literal life is everybody awake anybody not awake kick your neighbor see if they're awake amen when the angel comes with the ink horn writer who's he putting a mark on don't you see jesus weeping over jerusalem how oft would i have hovered you as a hand doth her brood but you would not and just think of the people that you've gone to witness to and you've gone to pray with and they've come to you with prayer requests and you took time on your knees praying for them and then they go right back into their same old habits and their same old ways and yet that burden is still in your heart brother branham said it was christ in moses that stood in the gap for the people when they rebelled it was christ in moses that did that brother branham always thought how can moses be able to tell god a better way there's only one body one lord one faith one god and father of us all who's above all through all and in you see individually individually we are dedicated we are consecrated that word dedicated is the same word that they used to name enoch he was dedicated to god and enoch had a testimony that he walked with god and he and he pleased god and therefore god took him and the bride will have a testimony that they walked with the word in the message how shall i overcome brother branham prayed this prayer he said lord i believe it's towards the end of the message he said lord i believe he said i believe lord i believe that you are my overcomer he said and let me walk with you that where you are there i want to be we want to be with him listen friends eternity is not going to start when you die we're in eternity now we're in eternity now time is just a part of eternity it's just a little segment of eternity your mortal life has a beginning your mortal life will have an end but we have a body eternal in the heavens that's not made with hands and when you die you go to that body but what are you going to take with you when you leave here that's all you're going to take is the character that you gained and how do you get character characters is not a gift brother branham said that character is a victory and it comes through the everyday struggling with uh your the trials that god in his wisdom allows to come to pass they asked brother branham said does god love you yes he does how do you know because he said so and how can i show my love to him by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom come to pass when you understand that your trials your heartaches your sorrows are the things that are identifying you with the literal life of jesus christ then you will understand why jesus said when when men revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake that you should rejoice and he didn't just say rejoice he said be exceedingly glad why because so persecuted they the prophets that were before you he said if they hated me they're going to hate you he said that that that offenses must come he said but woe unto them from whom the offense has come he said it's better for them that they were that a millstone was tied about their neck and they were cast into the undersea you know what james said about it he said counted all joy do you know what peter said about it he thanked god for the fiery trials that was to try him he said that the the trying of his faith was more precious now you got to get the the structure of the sentence there he didn't say his faith was more precious he said that the trying of his faith was more precious because friend if your faith is like muscles and if you don't exercise your muscles they'll atrophy and they'll go down to nothing but when you go through trial and trial and trial and your faith is exercised and you take a stand and you stand tall when the wind is blowing what happens you might be getting tossed back and forth up here but your roots is growing deeper and the dirt's getting looser and you know what the fruit's getting sweeter and now you can tolerate that brother that you couldn't tolerate before and now that person that used to annoy you they don't annoy you anymore amen let's see if we can get down here to where we're going but unto every one of us has given grace according to the measure of the gift of jesus christ we're unto when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now let's just keep on down to verse 11 because the gifts that he gave was some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and some teachers and those gifts are here for a purpose they're here for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body until we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the amen paul said it like this to the ephesians i think it's in chapter three he said that you might be filled with all the fullness of god i read that brother shambo and just my head goes [Music] you see now that doesn't mean i'm all god but that means everything that is in me is god amen you go out to the ocean and you get a little a bucket and you dip it down in the ocean and you pull that bucket out and you set it over here it's not all of the ocean but everything that is is 100 pure ocean and it's even clean on the outside we can possess our vessels in sanctification saints you can do it satan will come along and lie to you and say you can't do it but i'm here to tell you in laodicea in satan's eden with all the filth that's out in the world right now and everywhere you turn you can't even walk through the grocery store without seeing some picture of some woman that shouldn't even be in a bar room and there it is staring you right in your face but rich in his mercy has given us the holy spirit to equip us with the ability to turn our heads when we see those things and you know i came to the place one time i was walking through i think it was walmart and you look over there and you oh my goodness you look over there one and you know what i did i said well i said noah had to look up [Music] i said in order for noah to see out the window he had to look up because the window was in the top of the ark so i just went through walmart just looking up they might have thought i was a little bit crazy but you know what i didn't have to filter out all that garbage that was coming into my eyeballs it's hard to get a jug of milk while you're doing that though isn't god good i'm telling you saying we're striving to allow perfect love to be perfected in us and and and when and and i and and i had a brother come to me one time and he was telling me about how his wife was just being so hard on him and no matter what he did she was never happy and so he would just go on and on and on and on and on and i said stop just one minute i got to ask you a question before you go any further i said do you want the spirit of jesus christ in you he said yes yes i do i said well let me ask you a question brother i said if you're never confronted with perfect hate how are you going to know you have perfect love if somebody doesn't despise you with their guts and you from your heart you love him and you pray for him and there was a sister back home and by home i mean up in southern pennsylvania when i was conducting a little bible study and this lady come to my bible study and she had this testimony remember theresa she gave us his testimony there in the bible study and she was a cook and she worked in a in a little like a little um what do they call that like a um like a little like a little diner like a little diner and she was a cook in the diner and in that diner there was a little waitress and she was a christian and that little christian she would come in and she was oh happy go lucky and praise the lord and thank you jesus and every time somebody would do something wrong to her she just prayed for him and just went on never ever ever ever ever had a bad day where was she living at brother stephen she wasn't in the outer court she wasn't in the inner court she was behind that veil and when you're behind the veil you're not even dependent on whether the sun's shining or the clouds are out you know you're living in the presence of the shekinah glory and you're happy all the time and so she would all the time no matter what that lady did she would always have a blessing back at her and she'd say something sweet to her and she that's this lady she said oh she said every time i would and when she was nice to me she said now this is the lady that was coming to my bible study and she's given this testimony and said every time she said something nice to me i tried to think of something meaner and more wicked to say back at her i just wanted to get her goat i wanted to find her goat and she found out she didn't have a goat and so one day it was her birthday this cook the one that was always agitated friends this is what god has called his children to be brother branham said live for the person who would kill you if you could think about stephen think about stephen he lives so close to god that when god needed to get a hold of saul's attention he used stephen and stephen stood there and there was throwing stones at stephen why were they throwing stones at stephen did anybody know they were throwing stones at stephen because stephen tried to have a bible study and teach him about jesus and he kind of rubbed them the wrong way he said you stiff-necked uncircumcised in heart near that's the worst thing you ever want to call a jew you don't want to call a jew stiff neck you don't want to cause you uncircumcised i mean that's the nest and they're coming right out of state but it was the truth it was the truth and it wasn't him that was speaking it was the holy spirit that was just coming out and telling the truth and you know people don't want to hear the truth but he said you stiff-necked and uncircumcised and heart and yours he said you do always resist the holy spirit as your fathers did so do you and that just got their goat because they had a goat to give and they picked him up and they carried him out of the uh in the street and they started throwing stones at him and what did what did steven do see it was the same it was the literal do you see it sister it was the literal life of jesus christ was in stephen and so when they hung jesus on the cross what did he do he prayed for him father forgive them and so what's steven doing with the stone still coming at him hitting him in the head and he's falling to his knees he cries out they knocked this into their charge they don't know what they're doing you see now friends that's when you know you've got the goods when the heat comes you're not going to turn and run you're not going to try to change your clothes cut your hair off start looking more like the world because you don't want to be identified as one of them no you are proud of the uniform that god has given you and you wear it proudly and let me tell you something satan doesn't like it when you're happy and that's why he's always trying to wipe the smiles off of your face but if you go through the beatitudes it almost doesn't make sense because the word for blessed i'm going to get back to my story in a minute i'm going to get back to her i won't leave you hanging on her i still got her we're going to get back there but you know what the word blessed means happy it means happy and it says happy are you when you mourn can i use one of brother stephen's sayings am i reading a different bible than you are we're talking about overcomers here saints we're talking about people that walk with jesus not just when they're coming to church but every day every thought we're dedicated saints we are consecrated we want to know did you ever did let me get back to my sister friend here and so anyways so so it was this lady's birthday it was this lady's birthday and so in comes this uh this christian sister the the uh the christian and she has a birthday cake a birthday cake a nice birthday cake she baked her a nice birthday cake and she bought her a bunch of balloons and said happy birthday and god bless you and all those things on the balloons and so she comes in and she's singing her song and must jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free no there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me and she takes that cake and she pushes it up into the window and then she shoves the balloons back up in there and she says happy birthday brother stephen the lady told me this she said that so affected me she said i took my apron off and i laid it down and i came out around around into where she was at and she said to that woman she said she said gretchen she said i don't know what you got she said but i want it i don't know what you got that day i don't know what you got but i want i don't know what you got but i want it and i liked your song that was a beautiful song how many enjoyed her song oh that was a beautiful song will you sing it again for us all right there you go that was a beautiful song i i took pictures i went on i went on when we were watching bro i took pictures on my phone so i could read the lyrics it was a beautiful song who wrote that song do you know huh you don't know it's not important it was a beautiful song it really was but that's what it's all about god didn't give us the holy ghost just so we could go around say we're christians we are here to continue his work you read the church age book and brother branham said that the last church will be a continuation of the book of acts let's see if i can find that i got that quote here and i want to just read that for you and then then we'll wind her down oh my goodness isn't it good to be in the presence of god amen he says now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of acts shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church and make it uh defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his work and the attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time that he's cast into the lake of fire he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and that she and what she stands for see we're taking a stand for jesus we're letting the world go by and when we take a stand for him we're standing with the understanding we've counted the cost and it may cause some of us to have to give our lives even that much for for the cause of christ but when the persecution comes we're not going to be like the man my friend charlie chapman had and when the persecution came against charlie he wants to go change his clothes no you sisters you don't know how bright that you shine in this land to see in church age oh i'm telling you something there's a you're going to be a beautiful branch when you get out of here you go into a into a walmart and you're dressed in holiness you stick out everybody knows there's something different about you and don't ever let satan make you ashamed of that you wear that proudly and brothers you wear your smile proudly and you wear your joy proudly and it can't be anything that'll ever take it away from us paul said neither heightened or depth nor all the rest of that i used to could say that brother stephen but watch this now she will be an invincible army if they get the revelation of the two spirits and it's important that we recognize where these two spirits are they're within the framework of the christian church and so how did the pastor tell us uh to tell what spirit you have if it's something if if you're wearing uh your dresses because you have to it's the wrong spirit if you're wearing dresses because you want to you got the right spirit if you live for jesus because you want to you if you just come to church because you're afraid somebody's going to say something about you because you didn't go to church then you don't have the right spirit but when you love god and you want to be in his presence and you want to be around his saints now you're now you're getting close to the kingdom of heaven the two spirits and by god's spirit they discern and withstand the antichrist spirit now when you're using god's spirit to discern and withstand the antichrist spirit that's when you're taking a love and you're returning love for a blessing for a curse when you're returning love for hate when you're returning a uh peace for war you you just use you employ you employ god's spirit and everything you do and if you've got a marriage that's upside down don't go in there with the word of god and say oh wifey or wifey listen here you'll do what i'm telling you to do because the bible said a husband a wife should obey her husband well why don't you just live a life so full of christ that she'll know it's not you but it's christ in you and she'll want to be with you and she'll want to do what you want her to do see don't you see it brothers it's it's employing the jesus christ this spirit that he gave us is just not to make us look pretty and set us on a pedestal it's to go into action is to go into war and if i die i die ruth if i die i die mordecai have all the people fast me and my maids will fast and then i'll present myself to the king and if i perish i perish oh you hebrew children they had to fire seven times hotter well they might have had the fire seven times hotter that's okay i'm living in the land to see in church age and yeah it gets pretty hot around here but my bible said i was rather you would be hot or be cold but i ain't gonna be lukewarm that's right i'm either going to be on fire for god or i don't want none of god well can your god deliver yes our god can deliver us but i'm going to tell you this whether he delivers us brother mickey or he doesn't deliver us we're still not going to bow to your image we're still not going to bow to your image friend that is taking a stand for god with an understanding and you make that determination that you're going to stand for god long before the trial ever hits you [Music] remember what the bible said be strong in the lord don't wait till the trial gets here and then try to get strong it's your everyday walking living presenting yourself a living sacrifice holy without blame acceptable before him in love and friends that's not even going out of your way that's just your reasonable service and now look at this and the reason that we're going to do that the the ministry is here the apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists trying to get down to this now for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ until we all come the unity of the faith the knowledge of the son of man unto a perfect man under the that we be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and the cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ now in malachi 4 it said that when the spirit arises with healing in his wings when the son of righteousness arises with healing and wings it said that they will grow up as calves of a stall do you know what a calf of a stall does they put him in a stall and they feed him corn and they feed him corn and they feed him corn and they feed him corn and so you get into your closet and you eat the word and you eat the word and you eat the word and you eat the word and as you eat the word you become the word is that right and he said that they're going to grow up as casual stall i'm telling you this predestinated seed is going to be so hungering and so thirsting for god you'll see them walking through walmart with the new testament open and was there was they're going to get the milk we just want that word it's it's an insatiable hunger and what did jesus say blessed are you when you hunger and you thirst friend if you've got busy time that you're spending with some love novel just just get closer to the altar until god so burns that hunger in you i i can read the book of ephesians 25 times a day and it wouldn't be enough you know that manna that was beyond the veil it never spoiled i can listen to the to the the future home of the earthly bride in the heavenly bridegroom i could listen to that four times in a day and i wouldn't get bored with it and every time i listen to the same message i get more out of it it doesn't spoil but speaking the truth and love may we grow up in him and all things which is the head even christ from whom from whom you see what it says where are we coming from we're coming from christ he is the head and what is the head remember the pyramid brother brandon had up there the head is divine love that's the capstone that's our source of strength everything about us is divine love there's no bitterness in divine love if you want to know what divine love is just go to first corinthians 13. love is patient love is kind love is and and if you understand all the mysteries and you have faith to move mountains and you give your body to be burned and you don't have divine love it's nothing it's nothing without divine love brother branham said when he went beyond the curtain of time and he saw all those people that went on before him and and and thousands and thousands have come running up saying my precious brother my precious brother and he asked the angel he said are all these branhams he said they're your converts and he said well you're going to have to be judged for them he said will paul have to be judged he said yes paul will have to be judged he said i preached the gospel the same way paul preached it and they said we're resting on that we're resting on that we've got a we don't have fables we don't have people coming telling us that christmas uh is a day to be celebrated and that the wise men coming and was with the shepherds in the in the in the manger we know the truth why because we read the scriptures we know the truth and so we're not we're not following connolly devised fables so which is the head from whom the whole body jointly uh fitly joined together compacted by which every joint supplier let me give you an example what he's talking about here let me just show you a little example here there we go so we're building a brick house and we're going to put a brick right there okay and so now we got that one in there we're going to put one right here now this is two bricks brick one brick two let's give a couple more bricks here so we can get our house going how about five we'll have five bricks here three four five that's grace yes this is a brick this is a brick this is a brick this is a brick this is a brick this is a joint this is a joint this is a joint and this is a joint now where they're going to put the next layer of bricks they're going to go right over top of that joint right right yes every joint is supporting the other joints see this one is supporting this brick that's supporting this bread and then we put another brick there that every joint and don't you realize how important if you are a predestinated seed of god we need you to move up into the position that god has supplied for you to fill let me tell you something this brick cannot do this brick's job and this brick cannot do this bricks job this brick has got to come to adoption this brick has got to come to adoption this brick has got to come to adoption you've got to come to adoption you've got to come to adoption you've got to come too you've got to come to adoption and the adoption my friend is the placing of the person into the body of jesus christ brother branham said that the adoption was the placing of sons and don't you know that if this joint is weak then the whole building is going to be weak you see so your personal everyday dedication to jesus christ could determine the quality of the service that we have this coming sunday he said your misbehavior and unconfessed sins can keep your brother from getting his healing that's not all he said you know what he said and he said and you'll be responsible for every bit of it on the day of judgment that's right so that's what it means friends we are building the building of the lord and we need every person to be into it with all their heart all their mind and all their soul if you're old enough to understand what brother stephen is is teaching then don't give it just casual hearing sit here prepare yourself before you come to church get some sleep the night before don't be laying around in the service and gone we have to understand how important every one of us and this is what paul was telling us let's see if you're reading the same thing i'm reading from whom that's from christ the body fitly joined together and compacted and we found out that word compact album was the same word that he used for knitted over in colossians chapter 2 and he said that we were knitted together with what love so we're coming from jesus which is love we're knitted together by love which is the bond of perfectness and when we have a revelation of who we are and that we can do the greater works then we each one totally dedicated to the body of jesus christ together we become thank you amen and then we'll wait on the lord and will renew our strength and we'll mount up with the wings of an eagle we'll run and not be weary we'll walk and not pain teach me lord teach me lord to weigh in every joint supply according to the effectual working in the measure of every part making an increase of the body unto the edifying that word edifying means the building up and say nice things to people if you see somebody doing something wrong don't go around point out the wrongs they're doing find out something that they're doing right and just emphasize that oh sister you got a beautiful smile don't go tell her all the you pray about the things that you see wrong in your closet say lord i saw sister so-and-so and she was down at walmart and you know she wasn't quite dressed the way that a christian ought to be so would you help her lord would you help her in your closet you pray for some of you mothers and the sweetness of the spirit put your arm around her and go talk to her like she's your daughter put some feeling into it sister don't you realize that you're affecting the whole body of jesus christ see and the and brother branham said that the new birth was a personal revelation of jesus christ to you individually but then collectively all of us an invincible army and then we can do a work for the lord and this i say therefore and testify and testify in the lord that you henceforth walk not as the gentiles in the vanity of their minds let's skip down now down here if so be that you've heard of him and have been taught of by uh him as the truth is in jesus christ put off your former conversation of of the old man which is corrupt and deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind that you might put on the new man that's the clothes our brother was talking about that they tried to strip off the the the the traveler see that created in righteousness and in true holiness and in true holiness 31 31 let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be ye kind to one another tender hearted forgiving one another people say i can forgive but i can't forget so i was looking up in the concordance one time forgive i was looking you don't look up in your concord and forgive you know what the word above it is forget so before you can get to forgive you got to forgive saints i believe if we really love somebody they can transgress against us and brother said my bible does your bible say this brother sir my bible says that love covers a multitude of sins so if somebody that i love transgresses against me i don't even see it it's as though they never did it there was a preacher i met him over in germany he was from canada and his name was gunther brother gunther a good preacher brother you would like to heard him preach and he said they were married for 40 years and his wife looked up at him and said gunther yes sweetheart he said she says you got a crooked nose he said my nose clubbing he said yeah you got a crooked nose she said he said there said i did that when i played football in high school are you just now noticing they've been married 42 years and she didn't even see it you see love is blind my friends what this church needs more than anything else is perfect love with feeling when i shake the brother's hand and i look into his eyes he can feel my love the day of this church of people coming in and saying saying bless your sister bless your brother oh sorry let me do that again bless you brother bless you bless your sister bless you brother it's over with you grab a brother by the hand and you look him in the eye remember brother branham was walking down through the street one time and the sister media was walking around and uh and a little lady walking by and said hey sister brandon and sister you just kept on walking and brother branham said meaty that lady spoke to you she said well i know i did he said nothing go over and give her a good handshake and tell her that you love her god bless you sister i love you and i love the song that you sang and sister i love you and i love everything that you do for jesus and you sister you're a beautiful sing-songer and you sister god bless you and you sister god bless you and you sister god bless you with feeling friend we gotta put the holy spirit down into the warmth of the spirit and let it warm this place up and so much that when we come in them doors we just can't wait to get into the presence and for the spirit of the lord to get into the pulpit and to start warming up our spirits it's cold out there we need each other pray for your brothers and sisters during the week get them on your in your closet and pray for them we need [Music] i i need the love in this one i need the love in this one and i need the love in this one and i'm going to do everything i can to pray for each brick that's represented in this building that the love of god can be so perfected in you then when it comes time for us to take our stand that we will stand in the beauty of holiness without regret and if we perish we perish we're just going to a better place oh death where is your sting praise the lord [Applause] thank you thank you thank you amen blessed be the name of the lord let's give the lord a hand again [Applause] hallelujah see that we depend on each other right amen that's why i'm i'm doing everything that i can to put the word in your hand if you don't have a cod we purchase a cod for everybody so when you built yourself you built yourself you built yourself even if i'm not available you can pray for brother lama on the phone and god take care of the problem amen amen i hope you catch the ministry the way it's working this is not one man working and everybody else sitting at home and waiting to be fed that's not the way it's working amen when you pray you pray for me i need your prayer you need my prayer amen amen you all need to read the bible you all need to listen to the message you all need to read the message we all need one another we all need to grow together in the lord amen let's stand blessed be the name of the lord standing with understanding hallelujah you stand with revelation you know who you are you know where you're standing amen not a religion anymore hallelujah like brother sam say if you come to church because you don't want anybody to say something about you then you're wrong and people usually stop there but if you stay at home while you should be in church you're also wrong one is wrong with the wrong spirit one is wrong with a religious spirit and both are wrong amen because those that struggle have a tendency yes amen and no it means you need to be in church hallelujah you don't stay home and stay away from church hallelujah amen hallelujah speaking in tongues is a gift of the holy ghost but it is not a proof that you have the holy ghost but if you have the holy ghost brother branham say you will speak in tongues amen so you can't get away from speaking in tongues because you don't want to get the holy ghost did you hear me you want me to repeat it amen you might speak in tongue but you don't have the holy ghost but somebody who have the holy ghost speak in tongues and the under and the tendency in the message is when somebody's speaking in tongues somebody might come up with a quote and say okay you can speak in tongues and you don't have the holy ghost no no you might have the holy ghost and speak in tongue too that is the truth in other words strive for what is good amen get the holy ghost speak in tongue that's what we want amen but not you don't want to speak in tongues you don't want to have the holy ghost that's a problem amen so remember we're depending on each other amen i was telling a young man i say you're a young man you don't have bills yet you don't have a lot of problem in life this is the time for you to read the message this is the time for you to invest in your spiritual work before by the time you get married you start working you got children you must still read the message but it's not going to be in the speed that you would have done if you did it yourself amen this is the time for you to sit and listen to the tape and read and read and read and read because one time it's gonna be handy you were needed and when you needed you got four kids shouting and jumping around you're not gonna be sitting there listening to a whole tape amen so young people i'm insisting you that tomorrow if the lord terry invest yourself in the lord we preach to you brother uh paul says that if a woman is a virgin what does she do she give herself to who to christ to the lord so normally before you get married in this church you should be loaded everybody here loaded by the sermon loaded by what you believe the home what you're listening to so when you get into marriage your marriage is going to be easier than when we started amen how can you have all that you have now and struggle the same way we did struggle when we started that's not correct amen if the old generation struggle and start from zero we want you to start a seven amen so you don't have to experience everything that we did experience when we started you have everything handed to you but sometimes human nature when they hand them everything that's when they get so lazy you will think when we're washing our clothes with washing machine when we have rice cooker and everything it gives us more time the less people are reading the bible the less people are listening to the message that's when god sends you trial because that's one way to wake you up you don't want trials do what is right and god will take care of the rest if you look in the scripture you will see the king of israel the bible say and god give them peace all around god give them rest all around if you notice the bible say because they did that which is good in the eyes of the lord then the lord give them rest if you don't want to go into a lot of trouble invest yourself amen you want to pass school you need to invest yourself you need to stay home you got to study and you got to go go and get some good grade but you're not going to sleep don't do anything and you expect to have good grade it's not going to work amen do what the lord wants you to do amen read the scripture even if you don't understand it read the scripture one day something can come in your way and the holy ghost will anoint the scripture and bring it back to you and sometimes you wonder where was that scripture it feels like it was in the bible yes it was in the bible you just don't remember exactly where it was but the holy spirit already registered that and he will give it to you and you're going to fight that demon amen but if you don't listen to it that is not good i have seen this tendency i've seen it in the message and i've seen it and that's why it's a mess amen you preach the word on sunday the people get out from the church they go to the restaurant all they're talking about is just fun it's just joking it's like a jokey spirit people are just joking joking nobody even stand and say do you remember what we just listened to the church amen wow what a sermon that was you know when he was preaching he mentioned this this disease and then if you start that way you're going to hear somebody else yeah yeah yeah did you see this and then you go and then you start building and from there the holy spirit will come and you will sit there five hours talking about the word but we got a tendency before even sunday service is over it's like where are we going to eat in a restaurant so this one join somebody this one joins somebody and you sit and you ask a question do you know a nicolaitan spirit 20 years in the message don't even know what a nicolaitan spirit is something is wrong something is wrong why it's a jokey spirit oh it's a young people young people young people young people you meet with what did you hear when they preach oh he was good we have time to play we sit in the bonfire we did this this what did you glean from that it's a jokey spirit all around amen you sit down you talk two hours and an hour and 40 minutes was just jokes that's wrong brother branham say when you do that you backslid if you need a coach you see me but when i'm saying when you do that you backslid amen because there's nothing serious i would rather even you talk about investment something that can help you in life than just joking and then tomorrow meet again and we go where are we going we're going to mcdonald's five six people sit and just laugh just laugh just laugh just laugh and you go it takes the seriousness off and everything you went you receive in the in the in the church in the service is already gone and it doesn't even remind you that let me just go ahead and replay the sermon again and see what they were talking about let me go listen what am i going to do at home when you begin to get to that place then you're getting in good ground but if it's not it's got coming to church listen you go did you hear anything i hear some of them don't care i'm just waiting for next service next survey and then when you ask a question do you remember number 10 was number one i don't know i know somebody oh i was there when they were preaching i say okay tell me about the tabernacle what was it ah i need to go look in my book he didn't remember amen because they were going to church like friend friend i have friends oh i'm going to that church because this friend i'm doing this because it's fine fine this is not a bad friend you can have friend even if you're not in a message this is about your relationship with christ i'm coming to this message for christ i'm going to campus because i want to have a degree if you get straight you're going to get your degree and go down but what happened to young people they get for a degree they're in alpha kappa they in this study club they study club they start declared before you know they're in trouble because they're having so much stuff to do and the focus why did you go to the university same thing happened in a spiritual why are we going to church we're going to church for spiritual growth i want to grow i want to grow in the lord and i want to meet my maker that's the main purpose we hear then after that there are benefits then you have your brother you have your sister you have this this coming up but that should not be the motive watch when you're sitting watch what you're talking you're going to remember you're going to realize what i'm telling you and all you're doing is just you're trying to climb and it it pulls you down you're trying to climb and you pause your night before you know it you just mean hey what is going on you get you start joking right away and when you introduce joke that's how you go before the the song service star jokes such a joke you're breaking the anointing brother branham said that even branham say he was that's the reason why he was driving even some time alone because he doesn't want to talk to anybody before the service because as he keep talking talking talking the anointing leave you a musician you get here get serious take that jokey spirit leave it up there i don't know why this is coming from you get here get serious you get in this pulpit get serious amen because somebody's depending on that song to get a healing david sung and the demon left somebody so if you want to sing your song can deliver somebody before when i get here amen so once you get here you start joking joking right at the beginning on the parking lot joking before you know it you're sitting you touching an instrument you're playing but there is no anointing because you just destroy the anointing you start with that jokey spirit all the time all the time brother branham said that's a spirit in america entertainment and joking all the time all the time and you can't get serious so god have to send some hard trial then you see somebody serious and you see them they want to go to church if they if you see them going to church just know there is a trouble coming up as soon as the trouble is resolved you don't see them again they're waiting for the next trouble everybody here church i am not going to get your blood in my hand it might sound tough difficult but i have to tell you everything that you need to know if not it's not going to work i've seen three spirits working together and they're very bad very very bad you want to know them or you want to go home the first one is a pride spirit that's what caused lucifer to go down and when you have a combination of a proud spirit with a stubborn spirit then it's a problem again and when you add to the stubborn spirit a dominating spirit amen those three spirits if you got them you got in trouble if you get in the marriage you're gonna get in trouble clear period amen period clear amen and if they linger longer those spirits create a secondary nature when you become manipulative back here either the the wife have the spirit and it's going to be the husband that have to suffer and they reach a point where they give away they just flow with the the marriage the way it's going because the husband doesn't listen amen or either it's on the husband and it's the wife that is suffering and sometimes you must see the wife trying to do something outside like she's leaving the scripture truly she's not leaving the scripture she has a stubborn husband that doesn't listen and she got text stuff in charges and when she's trying to take stuff in charges she's appearing to you like she's getting out of line based on the message if you're not careful you can strike her she's not the problem the problem is the husband is not taking his position i can sit and break this down all over and you're going to see you got those stuff get them away they're not good you can live with those kind of spirit because it's a hard spirit to make you realize you wrong you're always right what you're feeling is right what you're talking about is right and people have to either understand you or not if not they don't like you amen a very very bad combination of spirit amen and sometimes it's covered by some are harsh by nature you will see it coming up some are not harsh by nature but they kind of sweet those are the very deadly ones honey and she's she got the street behind i don't know where that is coming from i wish the whole church was here then you're gonna hear me amen very sweet but dominating very sweet but stubborn very sweet but proud it's appearing humble by sweetness but it's not humble when she stand that's what is gonna be done if it's not done no peace at home hallelujah i've seen all of them my brother amen this is real stuff amen we cannot be in the house of god housing demon amen there's no way no way and in a message we play so long until the people were living with demon and they got comfortable with demon and when something happened this one is outside the message and how can you leave the message today and tomorrow you flip completely no no no you were not in a message demons were already waiting all they were waiting is just for an open door do you think it's easy for you to just live today and get a beer and drink it it would take a while for you to even get to that beer over there but how can you leave the message today and you got a beer and drink something is wrong something is wrong you were not in a message you were just playing around you were forcing yourself so invest your life in the word of god this is real dear it's 2022 everything is chaos in this world the antichrist is plainly showing itself there is an image they put up over there that looks like the beast they're telling you we plan prophecy left and right what else do you want to do in this world what else do you want to do what is interest to you what do you want thank god you even here tonight there is a people that should be here that are home sitting

jump here and give you coffee over there [Music] my brother we love you remember read uh exodus chapter 26 when brother sam was reading the scripture in romans 12 the bible says verse 11 not slawful in business fervent in spirit serving the lord be servant in your spirit to serve the lord you live for your life a lot 2022 it's for the lord find your position in the word and do it amen don't run from the lord there is no more time you don't want to regret amen let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you humbly again father tonight thanking you for speaking to us lord father i don't know who needed this but i know exactly that there are children of god that are in bondage not that they are bad but father it's just the spirit that have overtaken them over the years lord and trying to put them in a lukewarm situation that they don't know how to move forward father some are streaming and probably will streamlay the lord that's the antichrist and these demonic spirit lord are attacking homes where father i kinda hurt but as a shepherd we bear one another lord when we conceive and the decision the people are making are no longer even based on the word but based on a benefit that is all carnal father we pray in the name of jesus christ that you give a revelation father we spoke to the church about the three realms either humanistic realms all the rhymes of revelation and the vision lord and father in order to stand you got to be the one that give that knowledge that understanding that revelation so that somebody can stand in your word lord father lord that's why i'm pleading lord as a preacher lord father tonight praying for every family and everybody that is lord father under the the hearing of this voice and those that are streaming and those that will be streaming later lord father that a special grace be given unto them to open up the revelation of this world that they can know exactly what you're trying to come across and catch the true vision lord and stand when everything else lord can fall away when mom and dad can leave the message i'm not gonna leave the message because mommy and daddy left the message but i'm to stand despite the lord father because a revelation a personal love father relationship has been established between the individual and you lord father may you strengthen your children lord and may you protect us we are committing lord father each one and each family unto our hand father give us travel mercy as we go to our respective place and may you keep each family safe and bring us under consecration until we meet again lord father if that terror to come in the name of jesus christ amen brother you can lead us with a song before this place thank you jesus church we love you keep praying keep pressing everything is good amen [Music] we'll sing the song as you are dismissed i'm so glad i'm a part of the family of god i've been washed in the fountain cleansed by his blood [Music] [Music] [Music] god [Music]
