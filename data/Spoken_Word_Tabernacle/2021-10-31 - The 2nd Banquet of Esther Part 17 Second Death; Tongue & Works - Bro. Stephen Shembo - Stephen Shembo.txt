remember the fellowship we used to have we got eternity now we got all of eternity as a young man a young woman [Music] glory hallelujah i don't want to hold anything up but that's just wonderful i watched a video this morning of a really old man on um the gaithers he was at the piano and he started singing that and he it was really it was it really struggled to get it out but everybody was crying he played he tore the piano up playing that song and it was just wonderful to watch i do not have any written praise reports or prayer requests we are cutting papers up like this size and putting up there so if you have anything just write it down i will give an opportunity i have one praise report yes ma'am i want to take this sunday as the last appreciation for a pastor and my appreciation and sure all of you would join with me yesterday we were in heavenly places and things that we have struggled with for all our lives it just was made so plain and so simple and i want to take this on this past appreciation to say thank you lord for our pastor [Music] [Applause] thank you lord for a pastor who would give himself to god and who would bring this word simple you know things that we didn't know to know the three steps to know this to know that and it just made it so simple that i know where i am now i know the theophany i know the glorified body i can't thank god enough for what he did amen amen hallelujah hallelujah glory [Applause] hallelujah and you know last night he was a little bit he was a little bit skeptical about telling us about going to brother lambs i wish him not wish he said god bless you because him and brother lamb have a kindred spirit they're both teachers they both went through the same thing that you know and that's what makes brother stephen so special here he knows how we feel about what happened so i say more power to you god's god speed and just have a good time and we can't wait till you know the next sunday afterwards amen yes sir okay we can't prolong too long okay i'm not scolding it but last night when when brother stephen was bringing out about that man that was hit by the car and the abortion and my wife and i were talking about that just last week at the house and i've always wondered about those things and here it came out last night [Applause] on time god amen we got a phone call after we got home about 10 30 or so and it was my daughter lily she's down there at those meetings at brother burley's and i asked her if she was going to testify and she said i don't know if i'm she's nervous okay so i'll i'll tell you she was in tears i thought something bad had happened at first she said no she said i think i got the holy ghost she said i've been praying about it and she said she apologized for everything she ever did in her life that was you know contrary to what we've been trying to teach her and she said she'd been crying about four hours and so she said every message was like a stepping stone brother watkins has been preaching brother burley's been preaching a little bit i think there was a third one that i don't recall uh the name of but praise god we've been waiting amen amen all right so can we do a quick uh prayer request any shout outs on a prayer request yes ma'am okay remember him brother charles he's in kentucky working anybody else yes sir okay brother caleb's parents

father my lost precious friends and it just it's like an overwhelming feeling just came over me but the only scars that were see after would be his amen [Applause] the song we're about to do is um it's called a grass coulonkor and it means that grace is still flowing jesus has forgiven you but don't step on this grace the grace of god is the blood of the lord jesus christ that the life of god is in the blood of the lord jesus christ the life of god is in the word jesus forgives and he's still searching for souls that are in sin and he knew he's talking to us in simplicity but don't ever

the good work let's keep working working working and those that have gift continue to work continue to practice continue to do all that you can until we have 10 15 musicians here that we can change and rotate and and things like that amen blessed be the name of the lord remember again if you want to read you want to learn an instrument or something we can do it you remember me saying that if you want to learn an instrument just tell me where it is how much it cost even if the church doesn't have money we will provide money and make sure you get something amen but make sure you are committed we're clear we're not going to pay money and then they tell me you're not showing off so that's not going to work amen we greet you all in the name of jesus christ and we appreciate everybody here if there is a family member this morning god richly bless you we don't have visitors here we got family member amen we had a wonderful house meeting yesterday and i wish i wish water [Applause] so if you miss it that's not my problem when i face the lord i will say i did everything that i can that was on their lap i told them a month ahead that we have meeting we got meeting it's now recorded we answered a lot of deep questions in the message so if you lag behind in your christian walk because you're not coming to this meeting you are responsible on your own i'm we're putting those meetings we're bringing everything that we can so we can sit at least everybody in this church have an opportunity to ask a question with the pastor and we can answer you right away because sometimes it's hard to access the pastor it's hard to talk to the pastor the pastor's schedule is busy there is a box there put up your question we will look into it and as the lord give us time we answer them accordingly everybody clear so if your questions are still there for 20 years 30 years in the message because you don't want to be showing up here that is that is beyond my reach amen the church is here we put up the meeting it is now up to you to coordinate your schedule and make sure you're here so we can all learn together amen remember yesterday separation yes but no water no water so don't be responsible for murmuring and going left and right and talking left and right and calling people on the phone because you don't like this you don't like this you don't like this this is a family you don't like something come and see me you are struggling with something see the deacon you are struggling with something see the trustees talk to them and let's talk and see what we can do according to the not your preference according to the everybody then we can help you up amen blessed be the name of the lord everybody happy thank you remember me in prayer i told you the secret yesterday so you already know so if you were not there ask the people that were here [Laughter] brother stephen really yes i said people so you make sure next time you're there amen how many are up to date with the sermon everybody up to date how many are reading the cod book okay if you lagging behind go ahead and catch up on your cod amen i want to thank again everybody for their gift people have been dropping gifts some i don't even know who did it i just want to thank you all my biggest desire is for your prayer because we are in all of this together nevertheless i appreciate every single token all that has been expressed to me i'm preaching this morning like brother brother when he preached marriage and divorce i'm not going to preach marriage and divorce today but but brother branham had some cuff that was given unto him so the cuff that you see here somebody gave it to me it looks good right and even this one somebody gave it to me look good right i keep his name in secret so the devil won't fight him [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] amen because if i say his name that the devil begin to jump on do you know it's a secret understand under the seventh seal you need to learn how to keep secret until it's time to disclose it because what random say sometimes you give it and the devil get into it and make a hard on you right so let me keep my weapon behind everybody clear we mentioned last sunday about the meeting with the boys only remember and with the girls only with the boys when i have two deacons i'm comfortable they good with the young ladies then somebody a sister must be there even either the deacon's wife if they're not available then we can pull the trust his wife or whoever could be available to be there but at least a mama should be there to kind of help you help us understand your language everybody clear yeah so before somebody goes with a question let me give you that quote everybody there hebrew chapter seven verse uh part two paragraph thirty three 357. brother bradham said long time ago when i was doing what where is the bazooka i'm going to pick up a young man when i pick you up you can't sleep you need to be talking like a man i want men to talk like man everybody clear nothing about you no no no no no no we want to hear that voice god richly bless you amen amen can you activate this one praise god somebody gave a request yesterday that when i say this so i'm gonna hold it are you ready for it so you can wait for me to okay do you want him a little bit higher amen amen amen amen okay praise god i was actually looking for charles and he went to the second let's work with him first and let's see so long time ago when i was passing did everybody hear that clearly try again long time ago when i was pastoring did everybody hear that praise god okay when i was pastoring here we used to have just water young man everybody clear on that one amen so when i call the young man don't fast with me young men classes and i speak to the young woman on sunday afternoon about water sex and things did i say that did i say that no then the next sunday afternoon speak to the young man and try to get those things water curve down so we gotta iron some of the stuff you read on google on amazon book amen to show you that we are christian we do stuff a christian way amen right right amen don't worry you're gonna like me let's go to genesis chapter one it is sit down yesterday we already even started with the young men and i was so happy i told them i said that's music to my ear i should be sitting down and just listening to you amen amen blessed be the name of the lord brother i will use the screen a lot so you must be able to synchronize everything so the screen showed up on the streaming yeah i will use the screen a lot amen some of these stuff you need to keep it genesis 1 verse 28. i was sitting yesterday and i was reading psalm 133 and things began to break inside that office and i wrote them down i say when we talk about separation and division i'm going to talk about it i came here the lord the lord remove it from my mind and when i went home swept a little bit woke up then he came back again and said my god then when he came home he opened up then i was like oh now i understand why you didn't want me to talk about it but it talks about unity there's a power in unity a supernatural power when the people are united amen so i was telling the young man it was music to my ear to hear them talking about how do we shave and this i say wonderful that's what i want to hear so we will sit down with you and tell you how to use your treatment not a big bird a beard like this some leave a little bit like this and comes down like that and it looks like a goat and the people that do that in the world knows why they're doing that you don't know why they're doing that you are just copying not understanding that you are worshiping something you don't know look clean look gentlemen when i shave a bump no problem i have product i will show you how not to bump you like your pastor you heard them laughing let me close the young boys meeting let's go back to today genesis chapter 1 verse 28 oh brother robert is happy so i'm happy i'm covered you heard buddy john covered in other words make sure you groom well it's christian it's a holy spirit it is holy holy it is not a dirty spirit it's a holy spirit when they see you you smell holy you look holy amen amen until somebody looking at you like which world are you coming out of until they see that glow of a young man of a gentleman when somebody look at you they change their language they say sir how are you doing [Music] until they ask you where do you go to church then you bring him here and the word take hold of him 28th and god bless them bless who adam and eve the male and the female together everybody and god bless them and god say to them both of them were called adam you might be seated what did god say are you ready and god blessed them and god say to them be fruitful and the man here that god is talking to is not a physical man right god is talking to a spirit and this spirit is dual it is both male and everybody so when god talks to the spirit god told the spirit to be fruitful yes brother caleb thank you and to multiply and replenish the earth how is a spirit going to multiply how is the spirit going to be fruitful how is a spirit going to replenish the earth because god himself was a spirit but how did god multiply because he did somebody answered it everybody clear anybody clear blessed be the name of the lord okay okay and subdue it and have dominion everybody clear that opinion speak about the authority everybody have dominion over what over there who is my man preaching okay have dominion or authority upon water the fish of the sea everybody clear if not the cold one will take the headache off have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the the fall of the air fall of the air and over water every living and over every living thing that move upon thee earth upon the earth living things upon the earth so man before the fall was given the jurisdiction or the dominion or the authority upon the fishes upon the fire and upon the beast of the earth that was amen word man was supposed to dominate amen everybody clear so far let's go to james chapter 3. can everybody hear me okay amen okay if it's a problem brother caleb if it's a problem go ahead and mute him i will try to read everything okay go ahead and mute him you can come back to the front and i'll try to do it to the best of my ability so somebody doesn't say you say it because i got seeds of abraham they like my sister-in-law laughing there they want to hold to the world you say that you promise that's a seed of abraham james chapter 3 verse 5. are you there everybody there okay so let's quieten our spirit now and get focused even so the tongue is a little member and boasts water behold how great a matter a little fire kingdom very little but it can cause a lot of headache and damage and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity a whole cosmos of iniquity of politics and things everybody clear so is the tongue among our members that it defiles the whole body we already under have an understanding of this and sets on fire the course of nature so the course of life is just a result of what of what you am i reading a different bible the course of nature the way things move in your life is just a result of what which tongue okay praise god it sets on fire the course of nature and it is set on fire of what of hell that's why the rich young ruler in hell was worrying about his tongue that's where it started from verse seven for every kind of water watch my board every kind of water anybody clear everybody clear on the board every kind of beast check come on and off water everybody here can you see that on the board bird check amen every kind of beast come out and of bird kama and of water serpent everything that is moving upon the earth anybody care so beast right here serpent right here anybody care every kind of beast every kind of bird which is the fowl of the air every kind of beast come out and of birds come out and of serpent come on and of things in the sea things in the sea the fishes of the sea everybody clear check so james is bringing everything that was in hidden back here did that make sense in eden the power of the spoken word by the spirit man was dominating brother branham say adam and the spirit led the animal like the holy spirit leads the church so adam when before he was a man when he was a spirit he was just moving along and say elephant you go this way and the elephant keep moving with the spirit everybody clear we clear now now james is talking about the tongue and when he's talking about the tongue james begin to remind us of the dominion the domain that was handed to man in the garden of eden in connection with them did it make sense that's why when brother branham faced the ball all that brother branham have to do was to talk to the ball everybody not to push the ball not to use the gun on the ball not to scare the ball but to use the and speak to the ball and the ball understood the human language and turned around and went and sat down and just watched the prophet keep moving amen for every kind of beast and of birds and of serpent and of the things in the sea is what present tense is tame present tense present tense meaning we are already in scene his team now you go to the zoo you will find serpent in the cage you will find bird in a cage you're going to find animal in the cage you're going to find all kind of beasts caged up in the zoo it's telling you man is taming he's controlling he's dominating on all of them even though he's living under sin but he still have the ability to dominate did it make sense a sinful man has the ability to dominate but the way he's dominating this kingdom he's not dominating them by the tongue right everybody they don't catch the lion by the tongue make sense they have to put traps to get the the lion in the trap then they pick the lion and get him to the zoo while the lion is refusing anybody here ever here that's the way man is dominating but when noah wanted to bring the lion in the ark are you awake no i never use a trap [Music] no i was a perfect man no i just preached the gospel and when he preached the gospel the lion heard noah and the lion said mama noah is preaching over there he said it's going to rain and we need to escape the rain and the lion pick up mama lion and they both begin to come slowly to the ark [Applause] [Music] everybody here and when they entered the oak no lion could chase a lamb inside the ark [Music] in other words inside the ark of noah was like a duplicate of the garden of eden [Applause] anybody here as long as the lions stay in the ark the god can dance before him no problem but the day the lion left the ark then they got to begin to go back again [Applause] [Music] hallelujah am i reading a different bible praise god amen so all of them is tame naturally now in the present tense when sin is existing already it's tame and has been water of what of mankind man still under sin have not lost that dominion the difference is the way he's operating that dominion is we're using a different channel because in the garden of eden we have two trees anybody the tree of what life and the tree of water he's using his gift his domain through the tree of knowledge to dominate but that was not what god intended blessed be the name of the lord verse eight but the tongue can no man tame the only man who can tame the tongue now we know him when he came down in the upper room he got in a hold the tongue anybody clear it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison dare with bless we god even the father and dare with curse we men which are made after the simulated of god james is pointing here of a tongue that is producing two things it is a tongue that produces black and white that produce good and evil that produce blessings and cursing same time watch verse 10 out of the same water remember mouth tongue lips is thinking about the same thing out of the same mouth proceed with water and water blessing and cursing my brethren these things ought not so too in other words a christian cannot produce both [Music] anybody clear a christian cannot curse and bless [Music] it's a problem anybody clear a christian only blessings let's go to first peter 3 and you're going to see what a christian does and we will be praying i have a cargo let me deliver it okay so buckle up one service relax no sleeping let's get in first peter chapter three if you dare you can say amen verse nine are you there remember this not rendering evil for because somebody is cussing you they want you to cuss back but a christian cannot do you understand now it's a temptation oh railing for railing means insult everybody clear but contrary is water so here peter is saying despite the pressure that comes on you if your source is only blessing if somebody squeezed you what comes out if they squeeze you again what comes out if they keep squeezing you what comes down but if they squeeze you and so something was there that was not supposed to be there anybody clear all right but contreras blessing knowing that you are called you are there unto call you are called to blessing america you are there on to call camera that you should inherit uh you are a blessing you are called for a blessing and your inheritance is a blessing so your life from start to finish is where should curse come from hallelujah for he that will love life and see what let him do what because the course of your life is coming from what you're writing your own story right all right let him refrain his strong from water did they say refrain your tongue from good did they say refrain your tongue from good why you don't speak good nobody told you not to speak good you the one not speaking good so what do you expect in your life if you don't speak it who's going to speak it for you you're waiting for me to speak for you as a pastor yes but i have also my life let him refrain his tongue from evil and he sleeps that they speak no water why do you have to refrain your tongue from evil because you don't understand the power of your tongue when it comes out you better go quickly and let the blood of jesus christ erase it brother brother say every word that we speak here stays on the earth but branham say that brother branham said that even the word of jesus christ are still moving when you go to a pond there is water anybody clear when you take a stone and you drop it in the water what do you see how do they go until there but they don't disappear they bounce back that's how you word them that's how your words are okay you talking to somebody who is way down in africa how do they hear you you are here you say hello so much many thousands of miles they hear you over there hello if they're in australia or in europe when you say how are you doing at the same minute over there how are you doing exactly you talking not somebody else or a robot talking it's your voice talking over there how does your voice reach india quickly i'm asking you how is it that you speak right here and somebody means you're getting you well if i tell you if i give you a ticket for uh from here to india it might take you more than a day how can you listen at the same second somebody in india is hearing you what is the power the speed that your voice goes with you see the dimension so you might think i'm speaking here but that word is going somewhere there can i help you that's why the roman centurion told jesus just do whatever [Music] and when he went home and asked the question do you know what time was my servant here which time did they give it to him did they give him three hours for the word of jesus to travel they told him at the same time jesus spoke at the same time over there the man was healed [Music] a loved one is far away you can speak right here [Applause] i'm doing this so your mind open up because this technology has clogged our faith we can't believe big things we want things that make sense i got into the airplane then i traveled then i suffered and i went there then i see them then i lay hand and then they got pray so everybody understand yeah yeah that makes sense that's not the gentile faith the gentile faith is you speak right here just as your voice leave here and go straight to india if that person is in india oh my god open second king chapter six and then we're gonna pray or maybe you heard this too much and you know already everything so you don't need you are looking at like brother stephen we already know this stuff if you know this stuff you should not be where you are it means you miss something ok you are down there and you say i know i know about how to make money i know about this this i can tell you a new day in poverty amen you just feel your head but you never understand it because the one who understand it they just leave and the people look they say that man i need to get closer to him how do you do your stuff not come here come here come here because they check to say he's struggling he want to teach me how to do things you're wrong an example a wrong example come we are christian we believe the message what did you present in your life that can make them thirsty for you because the same thing you're doing they're doing it why should i leave what i'm doing to come to you show me equality higher that can make me jump sell everything and come and purchase that field [Music] let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we sung the song of zion lord we read the scripture to the best of the ability you have given us when it comes to interpreting the scripture and giving a spiritual revelation the only one who can do that is only you the lord jesus christ lord if there is anything that is in our life that somebody have done that could be a hinduism to a blessing this morning father may you forgive us may you quieten and settle the mind of the people may they understand how sensitive is the holy spirit to every move that we make because our act of worship can be done even by our movement father may you speak to us and bless us be the beginning the alpha and the omega of this service we commit everything unto the hand and ask it in the name of jesus christ amen god richly bless you i already read this now we are dealing with the second banquet of esther we're on part 17 we're still dealing with the second death we got into this territory of the tongue and i'm gonna obey the boss and keep talking until he tells me to move on today we will speak about tongue and works we talk about tongue and hell tongue and power tongue and this today we're going to talk about the tongue and the works everybody clear i want you to really really focus and do the best unless necessary not to move everybody clear i'm not saying don't shake i'm saying not moving unless it's necessary anybody clear we found out that man according to james even though man is still under the dominion of sin especially if he's not converted men still have the ability to apply this dominance upon the kingdom that the lord gave it to him in the garden of eden hey but here in other words man first was living by a different law because man was in fellowship with god anybody clear but when sin was introduced man moved from a fellowship with god because he went and touched the wrong tree which is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and from there on man begin to operate under the knowledge of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in other words man begin to operate under his intellect anybody over here he was operating on the faith but over here he's operating with his own intelligence and then james is showing to us that even though he's operating under his own intelligence yet he managed how to dominate those kingdoms why is men able to dominate even though he's there brother brother i'm saying the message fellowship by redemption but kill him just a little bit more he said but a man has a soul and therefore that soul is a part of god and even in its fallen state everybody clear what is it the soul everybody even in its fallen state yet it is the most greatest specie of all the species of the earth is the man because man was created in the image and the likeness of god and then get him in connection with his maker that's what he lost in the garden of eden he becomes a water a superman so the man that was a superman that could move the mountain and move everything was a man in fellowship or in connection with god but the lust of connection or the disconnection brought man into a lower state but despite the fact that man is under a lower state yet he's still dominating the kingdom ever here brother branham said he becomes a superman almost because he's a son of god he becomes acquainted with his maker with the creator of all things and then when that man there acquainted with his maker becomes a part of his maker becomes back into fellowship with his maker every divine water world becomes a living reality to him and he believes it anybody here so a man that has been redeemed under the redemptive blessings of god is a man that can take god at every single word anybody clear so far no wonder people can believe divine healing today they have not got nothing to believe with origin until god comes into water where the soul is a man is not much better than a brute his reason he shall think it all out how can this be and explain it all away but when god ever takes his position in the human water you remember last sunday all reasoning fades away god becomes water everybody cares so far so man back in connection with god give him the authority and the power to exercise his authority like adam hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord brother branham say god wanted fellowship and if we no matter if man today is a fallen son of god there is some part of god still with that man in his fallen state but here you take a man today that can split an atom tree of knowledge of good and evil or molecule or whatever you want to call it and can drive and can drive a jet plane around the world in a few hours and you can see that something in him is a fallen creation now he cannot create anything everybody clear but he can pervert what has been created into something to do what [Applause] about here and that shows that men never come from animal life because animal continually builds the same habitation to live in you will never see an elephant begin to build houses you will never see a giraffe begin to change his way of living the same way that giraffe was living in the garden of eden is the same way the giraffe is living today but man is changing from time to time we used to go with the horses and baggy then we get to the car then we get to the airplane then we get to the rocket men continue to improve why because there is something in man that is like god amen but man makes him a better house a better way of living better clothing better transportation now all that shows that something behind even in his fallen state he's still a son of god fallen that's what james is saying that everything the fishes of the sea the fall of the the living man all of that the living creature all of them were dominated and are still dominating by men how by intellectual by the tree of knowledge of good and evil by science by technology that's how man is dominating but god is calling to a higher civilization everybody clear now buckle up pretty good this man here that we talk about that in the garden of eden was dominating by the power of the spoken word and lost the power and now even in his fallen state he's dominated through the tree of knowledge of good and evil men live in three realms everybody here men live under three elements the first element men live under is called the humanistic element everybody awake this humanistic element is called the corner rhema number one humanistic element and this element is called the carnal mind this realm here that is called the corner mind is also referred to as the intellectual faith hallelujah the intellectual faith anybody care or the understanding or the intelligence anybody here the second realm that man lives under is called the realms of divine revelation hallelujah divine revelation divine revelation this realm of divine revelation is called faith but this is a different faith not an intellectual faith anybody here the third realm that man live under is called division i want you to stay awake it's called division the vision realm is called the safe the lord so every man here on planet earth live in one of those three realms thank you amen either man if it's a problem i change the microphone because the devil is playing with it [Music] can i change it change the microphone is it okay i keep hearing going up and down all right amen so man when he leaves either he's going to live under the corner or the humanitarian if you leave it right there it's going to be good or under divine revelation called faith or under the vision of that save the lord everybody here where do you get this stuff in the message melchizedek the great prince and king brother branham say in paragraph 181 there is three elements that man follows first is humanistic can you say amen second is divine revelation third is uh it is that safety everybody clear so far many times we are down in here and never climb into this [Music] brother but i'm saying many times man is living here and he cannot clamp all the way here in other words if i want to put it together you have number one here which is humanistic element then number two which is divine revelation and then number three over here which is the realm of the vision or that save the lord brother branham said the majority of the time we're living here and we cannot climb all the way right there everybody clear so far brother branham say many times we are down here and never claiming to this if you are not down in there cast your water cast your hope through the veil up here to water brother branham is calling christian to leave the humanistic part and to clamp all the way to the position of that self the lord [Applause] [Music] everybody here so far he said though you don't see vision number three though the revelation doesn't come number two though when you are prayed for you say i wish i could believe that don't make any water what brother branham is saying is even if you are living here and they pray for you and you don't have a revelation and you don't have a vision you cannot get discouraged [Music] there is a way you can live from here and go up here and go all the way up there blessed be the name of the lord he said that doesn't make any difference cast your anchor down there and do whatever everybody even if you are here and you don't have a revelation you gotta use your tongue [Applause] do you follow me the tongue can move you from one level to another level [Applause] do you follow me use your tongue appropriately [Music] [Applause] i wish the whole church was here hallelujah abraham could not see he said how can it be mary could not water how could she have a baby not knowing a man he said but the water will overshadow you and he shall do what it is not you bringing it to pass it is the holy ghost responsible to make every word of god come to pass [Applause] [Music] your responsibility is use your mouth to do the work [Applause] [Music] instead of using your mouth to promote a politician instead of using your mouth to gossip about people instead of using your mouth to depress yourself use your mouth to move you from here all the way up [Applause] if somebody call you on the phone and study about somebody stop him this is no more time to be playing games god is calling you to a higher level [Applause] why should i waste two hours on the telephone talking about nonsense how i should i watch two hours on a telephone talking about a church that is way up there while my children are suffering my husband is suffering my business is suffering my health is suffering let me use my tongue to change myself to change my home to change my life to change my family [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord let's go to second king chapter six you need to get tired of your life if you need to separate from somebody separate i've been with you for 20 years i don't progress why should i stick around you say if i want to do something you always show me the difficulty you want to do something no no no it's hard for you to do you want to do something no no no they don't get people there you want to do something you won't qualify i don't want you around me i can call the things that are not as though they are existing [Applause] you can help me you cannot help me you cannot block me move out of my way [Applause] if my project is bigger than your mind leave me alone let me believe what i believe [Music] let me confess what i believe let me walk like what i'm believing [Applause] don't try to block me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] let's go to second king chapter six second king chapter 6 verse 11 therefore the heart of the king of syria was so troubled for these things and he called his servant and said to them will you not show me which of us for is for the king of israel every time he gave a plan it seems like somebody's busting that out verse 12 and one of his servants say none my lord o king but elisha the prophet that is in israel tells the king of israel the word that you do what in your water is elijah in that bed chamber how does he hear the word [Music] keep gossiping you think you close the door of your house until one day we're gonna tell you what you were talking about and he said go and spy where he is that i may send and bring him in and he was told him saying behold he is in dothan therefore send he their horses to catch how many men one man descending horses what was it this man that to handle him they needed an army my father my father the chariot and he of israel and the what and the horsemen there of one man is like an army you want egypt down one man one man with a stick let my people go one man brought all egypt down hallelujah and then he sent their horses and chariot verse 14 and a great host and they came by night and compassed the city about 15 and when the servant of the man of god was risen early remember yesterday and gone forth behold a host compassed the city both with horses and chariots and he served and said to him alas my master oh my god how shall we do he began to panic because what what giazi was looking at giazi was in the humanistic level everybody okay now anybody here all he can see is what he sees around him and because of looking at what he sees around him and the circumstances was tight and difficult he panicked everybody here he lost control he began to get hysteric what am i gonna do now oh my god you see i was telling you all this time now look at what we're doing [Music] hallelujah verse 17 verse 16 and he answered what [Music] look at the window look look look over there see not anybody clear for day that be with water with us and more than dead that be with what in other words the army our god is bigger than they are me that you go there he that is in me is greater than he that is in the world if god beats her who can be against him [Music] so the conversation gas is here the prophet is here they're talking two different language one is talking but he's talking differently on the same situation and the other one is talking but he's also talking a different way on the same situation [Applause] [Music] one is saying there is not a door here another one say i see a door right here it depends on which level you are amen israel look at the red sea and when they look at the red sea all they can see is water ever here when god look at the red sea he see a highway [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i don't know if i would touch the middle of it everybody now and elisha verse 17 and elisha did what elijah did water so the camera can hear you elijah did what so there is an element of prayer because the third pool goes also with prayer enter into the secret closet that's what the angel told what branham giving him the scripture of matthew [Music] hallelujah elisha prayed and said lord i pray you do whatever was he what was was ghiazzi blind which house do we need to open [Music] [Applause] [Music] elijah here have two eyes to be precise four eyes everybody here this one have two one is shut down and he's talking about the two eyes and this one is talking about four eyes but he focused on the lower eyes versus the upper eyes hallelujah i pray you open his water he was not blind that he may do it see what he already seen and he described what he sees amen and the lord opened the eyes of the young man and he did water and behold the mountain was full of water horses and childhood of fire around the bathroom so praying [Music] are we okay can take you from here do you follow me and move you all the way there the greatest weapon brother branham said god put in the heart in the hand of the believer is what prayer why you don't see things [Music] hallelujah verse 18 and when because i'm showing you this because brother saying take your anchor and cast higher number one you can use your tongue to go up number two you can use to go up okay our people suffer for lack of knowledge verse 18 and when they came down to him elisha prayed second prayer to the lord and say smite these people smile these people i pray you with water so these people must see everybody here the first one was in humanistic level ever here and they took him from a humanistic level to the level of vision the second one the army was also in the humanistic level and they knew who elijah was but the blindness elijah asked was to remove them from number two let me explain it again let me explain that again okay guillaume saw nothing but what his human eyes could speak the prayer moving from this level to the level of a vision where he can see and he saw the chariot just like the prophet will see because this realm is a prophetic remember everybody but now they wanted to capture elijah and to capture russia number one you need to have some ice and number two you need to know who elisha is it's identification of the man and the optical eyes everybody so elijah asked god keep their eyes open but turn off their identification eyes [Music] did you catch me in other words keep them in the humanistic level but remove them the revelation of who i am [Applause] do you understand when the revelation of who erasure is is removed they can look at elisha they won't recognize it is elijah because of lack of revelation [Music] did i lose anybody did that lose anybody so the second prayer is block the revelation keep them in the humanistic level so when they see elijah elijah can be talking to them and they cannot see [Music] do you understand when the disciples were on the road to emmaus and they were talking about jesus christ then jesus approaches keep them seeing but he broke the revelation [Applause] and they're looking at jesus and they even ask him are you the only one who doesn't know what was coming up and jesus said [Applause] [Music] slow down slow down jesus called them what and what slow of water slow of where slow of what so the seeing is [Applause] do here understand do you understand so the prophet when he sees he sees here and here gaiazi still here and the prayer open this up and elisha said block this up keep them here and jesus talked to them six hours they say man you know the scripture ever here and to open this eye all that jesus well done is take the water and do what open the bread open the word and decide they say it's him and he disappear [Applause] everybody's here so far now let's read the scripture verse 8 17. oh my god verse 18 and one day came down the army to him elisha prayed the lord and said smite these people i pray you with water and he smote them with blindness according to the word of who ever here and then russia said to them this is not the way this is the city neither is this the city follow me they were following who without knowing who elijah was [Music] you can take the picture and show these people this is elijah look at his identification look at his id from dmv the worst sheet you can give them the birthday of elisha the city of elisha the family of elijah no matter how many evidence you will give it to them they will never accept it it is a sign of the blindness of the heart [Applause] so when somebody doesn't see this message when somebody cannot recognize william marion panama it is not they don't have eyes the revelation have been sealed [Applause] no matter how many caught how many evidence whatever you gave it to them they will see it blindness of the heart but blessed are your eyes so you can see blessed are your eyes because you can see malachi fall you can believe the message because your spiritual eyes has been opened amen [Music] [Applause] that's why you struggle don't fast on the internet don't waste your time don't waste your time if the lord brought you can show scripture scripture the same people that knew elijah the same people begin to look at elijah they don't recognize elijah anymore where did the revelation go a spirit of blindness [Applause] all they need is prayer prayer to remove that demoner everybody he said follow me and i will bring you to the man whom you water but he led them to water and he came to pass when they were coming to samaria that elijah say lord do what open the eyes of these men that they may see and the lord did what and there and behold they were in the midst of water so number one your tongue can move you up here number two water [Applause] anybody here so far hallelujah william marion branham for this purpose the bible say for these people heart is water when they say heart is works close it doesn't mean if the surgeon opened their heart they're gonna find cholesterol there hallelujah what's gross this heart is the soul okay and what here are what it doesn't mean if you take them to the doctor and they check the ear they have an infection because the bible say let him that have air do what what the spirit said if i'm too there that was not this year it's another year hallelujah and their eyes they have done what it is not desires but it's uh less at any time they should do what with the eyes and do what with the ear and should water understand with water not the head understanding where [Music] it is called revelation and should be water so to get somebody converted they must hear in a different ear and they must see in a different eye and they must understand with the that's when somebody is converted the problem is we got conversion in the head hallelujah and should be converted and i should do what ephesians 4 verse 18 having the understanding what what is darkening being inherent from the life of god through the water that is in water it's an ignorance that get the people now you show them the code they don't believe it anymore but here because of the water of the what if a heart can get blind so again so a heart have an eye [Music] you okay so that blindness is not this one but it's a blindness of the [Music] take the scripture down everybody here jeremiah 3 15 god gave a promise i will give you water according to my honor we shall feed you with what and what to do what [Music] malachi 4 came to turn there [Applause] [Music] hallelujah brother branham say now i thank each one of you a few moments ago when you were singing for you i am praying that is what i want you to do it's prayer that i depend on that is the word the secret of all the water you want to know something in the scripture the secret of all the mysteries of god that is the water that opened there to what is what is prayer that is the key that opens the door to everything of god is prayer if you pray and believe when you pray then believe that you receive what you asked for and god will make it work you sing the case with elijah hallelujah hallelujah so now we understand here that man either you are in humanistic corner or you are in the faith divine revelation or you know in the vision that is that save the lord jesus christ i am in one tenth anybody here in this corner humanistic realm it's a realm that deal with your brain all your intellect anybody clear it's a brand that deals with the five senses anybody clear in this realm here that is the realm of the spirit because remember when you enter into your body your spirit take over your brain and back here and your soul take place in where in the heart everybody clear so far so the humanistic kernel here is what paul called the carnal mind which is enmity against god anybody clear this corner mind here deal with five senses of the body everybody here and he also deal with the five senses of the spirit everybody here because the spirit operates in the body the five senses of the body we have see test smell and ear you all know that the five senses of the spirit you know it's affection imagination and all this can five of them we already dealt with them in the old church if somebody somebody doesn't know you see me then i will handle it for you properly everybody clear so these domains handle with this thing the body what he does he gather information but it doesn't process the information the body just will pick up and say it's a co it's an african-american he's wearing a tie he's sitting on the first he's wearing glasses and pull it and leave it there then the spirit enter the brain and take that information and put the data and say that's brother lemon right and interpret it oh he's in church he's sitting he's opening his bible that's the domain of the spirit anybody clear that doorman here of the fafsa says the one who dominated the most is the eye brother branham say may every person in here that is bound by the census-bound existence in other words the men that live under humanistic only trusting on what they can that is a man that is conan it is a type of thomas amen you can tell him jesus is reason he won't believe it until he sees it and jesus told him thomas come here go ahead and touch him but blessed is he that believe without water [Music] a man that when you talk to him he always reason all the time he have to see your finances you have to see your credit report you have to see how much money you have you have to see the deposit you have to see that is the corner humanistic man that's how they operate everybody so far brother branham say may they fall away from that tonight if this is where you're living today this morning you need to get off that area everybody here go up remember not go down but go what go up into the of water either go in revelation or go in the vision everybody here and make this church spoken word tabernacle literally rock with the power of who everybody can hear so far because these senses will cause you trouble everybody these senses will give you problems these senses will sell you [Applause] if you're sleeping wake up i know who's sleeping in this church i already know you everybody here i can even show you how you sleep ever clear because you did that repeatedly everybody but i won't call your name so just remember who you are i have a very clear so these ten five senses here and five senses here give you ten senses these sad ten senses will sell you jack album have children he have the first child the second child the third child the fourth child the fifth child the sixth child the sixth the seventh child the f child the knife child and the tenth child and he stopped then one day rachel got pregnant and rachel brought a child who was number 11 joseph when joseph came joseph was born as a [Music] prophet joseph came with the spiritual insight in the family of jacob and the bible said the patriarch the father because of jealousy the 10 brothers sold number 11 because number 11 was spiritual and they could not handle spiritual everybody care because brother problem say number 10 is a carnal number and brother branham said when the tribe were 10 they were connor and they saw joseph which was number 11 which was coming with a revelation your 10 senses will sell you ever here among those senses of the body the eye take the priority of the head about here then when we move on the second realm the realm of faith brother branham said the importance of revelation by the spirit to a true believer can never be overwhelmed revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize [Music] anybody care now i'm not talking about this book of revelation and you i am talking about our revelation it is tremendously important to the church revelation is faith [Applause] revelation is the substance of things you hope for [Music] do you understand when you hope something you are in the air because you just hope everybody you're just hoping you're just hoping you're just hoping you're just hoping you say oh i wish somebody can give me money to buy a computer i wish somebody can give you money to buy the computer then brother kalima comes in the morning he say the lord put in my heart to give you two thousand dollars i better clear when you get two thousand dollars in your hand it's no more hope do you follow me do you follow me two thousand dollars is the substance of what you were hoping for in other words in other words two thousand dollars is a computer in money form everybody here so when you have two thousand dollars even though you have not bought the computer yet but you begin to rejoice like you have the computer in your hand [Applause] hallelujah when you get home you open the door you're smiling your wife said why are you smiling you say everything is finished you got the computer no where is the computer i don't have it so how is everything finished i got the money i got the computer ever here even though i'm driving going to walmart i'm driving singing for the lord because i got the money in my pocket the money is the substance of what you are hoping for money is a faith that's why brother branham said money is like faith [Music] because it's a substance and if you notice that manny can also immorphy can i help you again if i bring you a computer i brought you the final product you cannot change that you will get the computer and that's it but if i give you money you can pay a bill you can pay gas the money can morph on whatever you want to put on him if you call him computer he becomes computer if you call him car he becomes car if you call him gas he can turn and be gas if you call him mcdonough he can beat mcdonough the money can immortal faith is the substance faith you can move faith where you want faith to go [Music] it is one faith you can call it buick you can call it cadillac you can call it toyota it depends on where you want to go with him [Applause] hallelujah i am talking about our revelation it is tremendously how important to the church hallelujah why is important to the church as i have said there is three elements that people dwell in this first one is humanistic done here we say well i shall pray for that person i am so humanistic give you hope everybody clear now all right i'm hoping that now they shall get well now the next is divine revelation that is when something done in you now everything is clear in your heart encourage it and say it is going to work it is called the substance that's something god get into you telling you i don't know how but it seems like in my heart i know god will do something it is god's faith [Music] when you pray you pray you pray you pray and suddenly you feel like a peace about what you pray that is faith to know that you have gotten the faith you will notice the worry is gone [Applause] and most of the time you will no more pray for that thing again when you praying that thing don't come back in your mind he's telling you that thing is already approved in heaven it is on his way to come [Applause] [Music] brother robert i mean the first slide how can i move in the second side with this kind of anointing [Applause] [Music] and if i want to bring this on wednesday most of you won't be here [Music] you understand why your pastor have to wait for you [Music] hallelujah hallelujah that is when something done in your water and go and say it's going to water how it's going to happen i don't know but something in me is telling me my child will be okay [Applause] [Music] hallelujah then something is going to then the third element is what order made what when you see that it is what that's what jesus said i do except the father when the father showed me then blessed the lord [Music] [Applause] are you there but faith you don't see that something in your heart sees it it is an understanding spiritual that something is going to happen [Applause] oh my god hallelujah now there is three elements that people now he's more he was dwelling now it's living in first it is water humanistic second secularism and third is water now dislike in prayer when you pray for anyone in humanistic we say well ah you shall get well see i'm hoping i'm believing for you trying to use all the faith that i can those are language of a humanistic level everybody that is human compassion second is divine revelation when something is what now you understand that i in the art is revealed to you you just know in your it's going to happen yet there is nothing but just there a substance [Music] you think they're going to give it to you yes i'm going i don't know how but i'm just going back here a third is a vision because that is that is what it will never fail hallelujah so now you understand that the humanistic give you hope give you intellectual faith but the domain of a revelation deal with what everybody clear now and this doorman by the vision when you go the vision take the heart and the eye and put them together [Laughter] [Music] are you ready in proverbs 29 verse 18 the bible says where there is no vision the people but he that keeps the law happy [Music] if there is no vision the people perish but even though there is no vision if you want to be happy hold to the word okay okay if there is no vision then you go back to the world do you hear me if god gives you a vision you walk in the vision but if you are praying and you don't see vision now you have a right as a believer to get the word [Music] [Applause] [Music] when jesus met the devil in the wilderness and the devil began to tempt him the devil spoke and jesus said it is written spark it is written spoke it is written brother branham said the reason he did that is to say that every christian no matter where he is brother branham said if you notice jesus never use any gift he only stick to the word showing that every christian when they're going to trouba if they just take the world they can defeat the devil everywhere anywhere under any circumstances [Applause] so when you are weak you don't feel like you praying don't get discouraged hold to the word [Applause] hallelujah that's why the prophet have to store the word so when the prophet is out we got the word [Applause] hallelujah if i don't see anything if i don't feel anything if i don't feel anything in my heart you take god in his word [Applause] hallelujah that's when your tongue begins to help you up now [Applause] i wish i can have two hours with you here oh my god number 24 remember vision take the optical element of the corner mind and combine it with the heart the corner man uses the eye and working with the visible the revelation uses the heart the vision take the heart and the other one and combine both of them [Applause] let me help you up again we talk about their brain and we talk about the heart we showed you that the spirit operates here and this is the first conscience right and this is the heart where the soul is and this is the second conscience or the sub-conscience here humanistic work with the first conscience revelation work with the subconscious vision take the two conscience and mix them together [Music] relax relax hallelujah number 24 verse 4 he has said which heard the word of god which saw the vision of who falling into a water but having his eyes are you okay in the vision you grow into a dimension but your eyes still are you there he said which heard the word of god verse 16 and knew the knowledge of the most high which saw the water of the almighty falling into a water but having his eyes what a vision uses the heart and the eyes yes john 5 then answer jesus and say unto them verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he what the father do what things so ever he does these also do the son likewise for the father love of the son and show him what that himself does and he will show him greater words than this that he may in other words before jesus do something he saw a movie and when they show him the movie he begin to work like the movie but here that's why when brother branham saw vision brother brother have to be specific on the characteristic of the vision and when brother branham get to your home and in the vision he prayed for you when sister becky stretched brother branham have to wait until sister break is stretched before he does it as long as the sister have now stretched he's going to be waiting because you do as the father does sorry sister country on god ever here the bible says in first samuel nana before time in israel when a man wants to inquire who of god that's respect come and let us go to the water for he that is now called uh was before time called uh because the prophet uses his eye yet his heart open up at the same time but here so the humanistic kernel element work with your visual it gives you the visible world this is what you see the domain of the revelation goes with the heart and it's the holy spirit coming and bringing you a revelation this one brings you senses that are different than your natural senses remember the heart to have eyes right and the heart also have an ear to him that hears let him hear what the it's another ear come and test and see if the lord is water it's a different taste when you say yummy it is not here it is this person saying it is yummy because men shall not live by bread alone but every you are eating right here it's a different senses smell the lord smell the sacrifice the lord is a spirit he's smelling that in a different touch the lord when you touch him brother branham says somebody is there praying and he touch him the person never touched the pillar of fire it's a different touch it's a touch of faith which is a touch of that jesus said who touched me they didn't touch jesus they touched the helm of his government but jesus felt it in his word hallelujah it is a different sentence but here then the vision is using the vision and the divine revelation the visual and putting that together everybody clear so far everybody here so far are we okay you want to stop here [Laughter] let me look at the time it's 32. i usually have to stop at 30. let me drop this down and we got to stop not even half of what i wanted to deliver everybody amen now we got three parts here we got the carnal humanistic we got faith revelation we got vision which is what that saved the lord to move from here to here you use your tongue or to move from here to here you use prayer but the problem is we're trying to know how do we use the tongue and you don't have time for me everybody if you take these three elements and i put two sets the mathematics of god in the left side i put a humanistic there everybody okay everybody okay in the right side the humanistic side over there deal with the brain you already understand that it deals with the optical eye the visible world in the right side we get divine revelation and divine revelation deals with what in the middle you got vision because vision combined the two but here so the intersection between the two is vision over here is purely humanistic over here it's purely divine revelation but the mixture of the two in the middle give you water everybody clear so far there is an element that falls on the vision that element is called dream sister amy you remember yesterday right that's what the pastor was talking about amen what is a dream if you look right here purely everything here is humanistic everything over here is a divine revelation what is in the middle it's a mixture of two which puts you in the domain of a vision so if you hear you carnal if you get here you're in a revelation where god speaks to your heart and your heart is directing your life anybody clear you can get a husband here you can get a husband here or you can get a husband here you can get a prophet here you can get a prophet here or you can get a prophet here over here is what people told you that brother branham is a prophet here right in divine revelation is when the woman at the well said sir i perceive i'm not perceiving here i'm seeing here that you are here something in me tells me that you are here that is the divine revelation ever here the vision is when je mama mommy in tennessee wait in the morning and say daddy i pray i'm a with a woman my son is dying i saw in the bible there was a widow woman and elijah the prophet i am the with the woman i don't know where elijah the prophet is send me elijah prophet and god open up the vision and show him brother branham and auntie woke up in the morning and wait till the door and wait for brother branham when brother branham come he said i was waiting for you good morning pastor that was the realm of revelation [Applause] hallelujah depending on where you live you can live in revelation or you can live in a vision those are the realm you should be balancing every day in your life either god is speaking here either i'm seeing something [Applause] how did your mama see brother brandon bye [Applause] [Music] how can i preach and finish this hallelujah hallelujah so when you get your husband here if you get brother branham here anybody can take you off the message [Music] the proof that you receive brother branham in a humanistic level if they bring you things that make you reason against brother branham you're gonna take it and leave the message it shows you you you were anchored to brother branham in a humanistic level the woman a revelation level will tell you i don't understand everything in the message i don't know but i know one thing this message changed me i am not the same man i used to be [Applause] i know what i was before i know how bad i was before that when this message came it changed my life [Applause] that man you will never remove him from the message [Applause] because the heart doesn't reason do you understand this i don't know but something loved brother bronner [Applause] you guys are a cult you are foolish i don't care what you call me it is [Applause] no death no height no principality no power nothing can separate me from the love of god which is in it is called divine revelation [Applause] hallelujah the one in a vision seat he can sit down and take you to the scripture and say look here look here look here look here look here and he can tell you amen hallelujah can i finish this one [Music] hallelujah so we got humanistic element don't get your husband here because this one you want him to be to have beard like this you want him to shave like this you want him to smell like this you want him to have six-pack hallelujah i want her to be a coca-cola brothership and once she have the first child the second child they turn child no more coca-cola border shape then you in trouble humanistic husband but revelation husband whether he's big whether he's small whether he begins to them whether he doesn't he's still my husband i still love him we start with him all the way to the end [Applause] the women the wife of jacob never divorced her because he began to lamp if you say that lamping husband they get mad don't call my husband lamping [Applause] hallelujah get your husband in a revelation [Music] because revelation will withstand the trouble when you go through hard time into life into your marriage and things don't work anymore something is anchoring say father you gave me this husband this is my husband nobody can take him away [Applause] for reacher for poor [Music] [Music] brother robert how can i preach like this hallelujah hallelujah there is two points here this is a humanistic this is a divine revelation so you can come here or go up here and you can move up and down up and down up and down if you cross here you're in the vision if you cross here you go back there but there is a point here that is not here it is not here it is not here but it's just where it is that point is the dream you want to go home brother kelly i'm not responsible so i'm i'm getting off the trouble with the deacon before they sit me down and say pastor we gotta talk to you okay so you heard them brother robert okay okay let me get this so i'll let you go home and throughout the week everybody clear the dream world is a dream hallelujah brother branham say here is what it is here is a man conscience first conscience right here the conscience you live in now we are taught by science that you are dreaming you are in your what you are done here in the heart did you ever seen a person dreaming you think you dream all night it is not that long that's why it's a point just a what a little bit you have done dream hours of dream you think but just a moment a flash while it's going through the person that is dreaming is not here in the heart subconscious you get there when you sleep here you are awake here you are awake but you can jump in your conscience that's why the prophet have two conscience superimposed they can be looking at you but they're acting like they're dreaming it's just he's all using his optical and the vision up and up and the prophet begin to say yeah i see i see something going on you see him with eyes open he's using both of them but clear he's in right here but in the dream hallelujah when then you actually had some part of you some makeup was somewhere and seen something that very yet in your mind it's that right that is your subconscious so when you dream you are here you're sleeping you're not really sleeping you are not awake but you lack caught between two dimensions now a normal person dream because when you are here your subconscious they say is set far this far from you now the man that doesn't dream say his subconscious will be plumbed back to that wall there he sleeps so sound that he never wakes up a noise doesn't wake him up but a person that dream is not all together did you know that a dream only last uh or it's a point but it's just between and what that's why it's between there okay you're not here you're not here point you're not even in a vision but you're close to the vision hallelujah just like dreaming a dream some people dream dream some doesn't you are dreaming it is your and an ordinary man let's say his subconscious heart hears it first when he's here when you go to sleep you dream of things that you did when you was awake when you wake up you remember things that you dreamed even years ago is that right some people never have a dream a person that sleeps sound doesn't dream it's the people that doesn't sleep very sound that has the dream they are not all together or not all together they are in the point anybody clear so far all right now a dream and let me go to the airport number 16 no and he said here now my word if there be a you i the lord will make myself known unto him in number three and i will speak unto him in uh why is a prophet using dream and vision joe too and it shall come to pass afterwards that i will pour out my water upon all flesh it's the holy ghost and your sons and your daughters shall by the spirit your old men shall dream by the spirit your young men shall see you see the two the fulfillment and it shall come to pass in the last day i will pull out my spirit upon our flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see and your old men shall dream water so we see dreams and vision getting closer together everybody a dream interpreted is there [Music] because vision you don't sleep you are wide awake and you see and in a dream you are not really sleeping you are not really awakened so it's a mild form of a dreamer a mild form of a vision because a person not may be born with that subconscious to say be awake when he sees it then god get over into his sub into the subconscious and speak to him which he promised that in remember joe and the book of acts in the last day he will visit his people also in vision we have seen his star we found joseph early jacob's son that he was a prophet and a prophet understood dreams now if a dream is interpreted then it becomes uh it is uh anybody clear now you remember that okay praise god john 33 for god speak once yeah twice yet man in other words god gives us a lot of messages but we don't get it that's what it means in a dream in there so a dream is what are you okay now did you get a dream now it is a vision of the night when deep sleep falls upon men in slumbering upon the then he opened uh i touched your ear you were sleeping that's a different year remember and still if the instruction that he met with german from his and hide pride from what so god sometimes secondly uses vision to warn you of something or to instruct you or something but he got to be checked by the word he got to be interpreted by the word anybody clear but there is a god in heaven that reveals secret and maketh known to the king nebuchadnezzar remember also pharaoh what shall be in the latter's day that dream and the vision of that upon that okay are these as for dio king that thoughts came in their mind upon the bed what should come to pass [Music] so when the king went to bed to sleep he didn't have sleep so he jump on his bed if he's a christian today he prayed and he sat on the bed and begin to think and when he begin to meditate the theme of his meditation pull god do you hear me what he was meditating upon before he goes to bed that's what attracted god and god entered into that meditation and took that meditation and pushed it down to his heart i'm going to stop that thought came into their mind upon their bed because when you awake let me finish here you are here you are using your brain you're walking throughout the day walmart everywhere when you go to bed you're sitting you begin to meditate on something because once you fall asleep you live here you jump here and you are resting so whatever package you're preparing here is important anybody care because that package will not drop down so when god was passing by he saw the king worrying about good stuff he said wow he's thinking about good things okay since he's thinking about good things [Music] amen and he does reveal if the secret make it known to thee what shall come to water that's why it's important to watch you meditating because the disciples on the wall to emmaus were talking about something and as they kept talking and talking and talking they were creating an atmosphere around them and when god saw that atmosphere he didn't go to the other disciple he went to the one that were talking about him and god jumped in the conversation and when he jump in the conversation he start from moses and begin to explain to them the bible the baba the bible the bible the bible until their heart begin to burn what are you meditating before you go to bed what are you meditating throughout the day what are you talking about we want to move from humanistic to the revelation and move from the revelation all the way to the third on a vision they disciple by the tongue by their tongue because they were cornered here that's why jesus said you full and slow of what right but because they were using the tongue properly everybody clear they were using the tongue properly god came by their tongue to remove the slowness of the heart until their heart begin to burn are you there and when the pastor wanna close they begin to tell him no continue [Applause] [Music] because the heart was burning within them as they were hearing there let's stand there [Applause] church if i continue here it's gonna spill over hallelujah three domains i was trying to get to the tongue how you can make the tongue work for you but you got to understand where you're living either you're a humanistic you worry about what politics is saying what everybody's doing and everything is going on around you how the economy is falling how many people are doing this and this you are in a humanistic level it's going to bring you headache it's going to give you a fear it's going to give you uncertainty you will be uncertain you will be puzzled up you don't know i don't know what is going on in this world what are we going to do is the rapture coming up because you're in a humanistic level but if you dig into the revelation then everything is peace then modern event will be made clear by then you begin to rejoice because jesus said when you see these things do whatever because somebody is in a different level when people are depressed you are saying praise be to god let it come let it come let it come so we can go quickly let it come so we can go quickly because you were in a different level until you get to the vision [Music] where we get in the third pool into that safe the lord when the instruction begin to drop and you say it i have a quote brother branham say somebody will come to you and say my crops is dying i don't have rain and you say i give you rain hallelujah that's where we want to be amen is a prayer request here my mom she needs surgery for cervical cancer i would like prayer for the cancer to disappear before the surgery can happen let's pray together because prayer can move us from one realm until we can believe for our loved one and then god can intervene heavenly father lord we are approaching you humbly father unworthy that we were lost in the sin of the world but lord by your grace while other have been
