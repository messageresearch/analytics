[22:18] everything and but the man that helped
[22:21] him somebody stopped by and the man kept

[22:28] an impression on on Chris there and

[23:03] normally she's got these little boots
[23:04] she wears around around the place but
[23:07] she's walking in front of the house
[23:09] and at the very last second noticed a
[23:13] snake was was under her

[23:47] goodness he kept that snake from taking
[23:49] her you know popping her I took care of

[24:30] last Monday uh
[24:33] we brought it down it was him my wife
[24:36] and myself
[24:37] and we loaded it into my Dodge
[24:40] to bring it down here
[24:42] well
[24:43] I was having some trouble with the
[24:45] blower motor on the Dodge sometimes it
[24:48] would work sometimes it wouldn't
[24:50] I knew it was going out well when and
[24:53] last Monday it was very hot
[24:56] and it was that afternoon we came down
[24:59] and the blower motor wasn't working at
[25:01] all it was working very very little just
[25:04] on high it was very not even putting
[25:07] hardly anything out so we had to have
[25:09] the windows down
[25:10] well we come down we got to pulpa here
[25:13] set it up
[25:14] and
[25:15] we got back in the truck I started it up
[25:18] and the blower motor was blowing out
[25:21] like new money

[51:33] good to see you amen
[51:37] Joshua chapter 1 verse 1. you ready my
[51:41] friend
[51:42] the Bible says now there is an echo
[51:45] after the death of Moses
[51:48] which to me after the death of William
[51:51] Marion Branham
[51:53] if you have a problem with that you
[51:54] change channels
[51:56] amen
[51:57] the servant of the Lord
[52:02] is that a problem
[52:04] Are you ashamed
[52:06] [Applause]
[52:17] the state the United States was not
[52:20] ashamed of brother brother
[52:24] they kept that picture on the Hall of
[52:26] him
[52:27] [Applause]
[52:32] oh let's remove that picture it's
[52:34] idolatry foolishness
[52:41] if somebody uh bow down before the the
[52:45] Brazen serpent that means Moses is wrong
[53:00] let me let me stay on my channel
[53:04] now after the death of Moses the servant
[53:07] of the Lord he came to pass that the
[53:10] Lord spoke to Joshua the son of none
[53:13] Moses minister
[53:16] saying brother Branham say Joshua was a
[53:19] prophet
[53:21] you need coach you see me I'll give you
[53:23] a perfusion of it
[53:25] verse two Moses my servant is dead
[53:29] now therefore IRAs go over this Jordan
[53:33] you and all these people
[53:36] to the land which I do give to them even
[53:40] to the children of Israel you might be
[53:43] seated
[53:45] this land
[53:46] they were not there yet
[53:50] amen Israel was not in the promised land
[53:53] yet but God already gave it to them
[54:00] everybody okay
[54:02] and the way we usually look at these
[54:05] things
[54:06] if the Lord already gave it to you you
[54:08] just go ahead and pick it up that was
[54:10] not the case
[54:12] God gave them a land
[54:15] that was already infested
[54:18] by the enemy
[54:22] so when you see an enemy it's not really
[54:24] an enemy
[54:27] the enemy is a sandpost
[54:32] to your blessing come on
[54:37] everybody okay everybody okay if you get
[54:41] into the promised land and you see the
[54:43] enemy it is scarecrow that's right
[54:49] in other words he's holding something
[54:53] that belonged to you
[54:56] and as long as he's there you won't get
[54:59] access to what belongs to you
[55:01] you gotta drive him out
[55:04] and God said that land he already gave
[55:06] it to the children of Israel so to begin
[55:09] with the Promised Land
[55:11] amen
[55:13] the promised land already have an honor
[55:19] amen
[55:20] let me put plural amen it belongs to
[55:23] somebody
[55:27] now my question when you get to the
[55:29] promised land and the Philistine asked

[55:34] this is your land
[55:36] give us the deed

[56:08] cuddly
[56:09] God say so
[56:16] you the one that slow me we're not
[56:17] trying to move
[56:19] Jesus one day
[56:21] told the disciple
[56:23] that I need a vehicle
[56:28] and Jesus looked in the word to verify
[56:31] which kind of vehicle he need to use
[56:36] and the word gave him the mark of the
[56:39] vehicle
[56:40] in that time he was calling us

[56:50] am I saying something different
[56:53] [Applause]
[56:54] is he complicated
[56:56] so when Jesus looked into the word he
[56:59] say oh what is the mark of the vehicle

[57:03] vehicle they say it is in us the Ludo of
[57:06] a cult

[1:02:36] brother
[1:02:38] [Music]
[1:02:46] jump to verse uh forward
[1:02:49] from the wilderness
[1:02:51] they're giving you your boundaries to
[1:02:54] this Lebanon even to the Great River the
[1:02:57] river Euphrates or the land of the water

[1:03:32] shall not any man
[1:03:35] be able to stand before you all the days
[1:03:38] of your life
[1:03:40] as I was with hope Moses
[1:03:47] so the ministry of Moses never stopped
[1:03:52] he continued with Joshua
[1:03:55] so Joshua was a continuation of Moses
[1:03:59] amen
[1:04:00] [Music]
[1:04:01] everybody okay
[1:04:03] Moses the man is dead
[1:04:06] but his ministry continued in other
[1:04:09] words his ministry in more faith
[1:04:13] from Moses into Joshua
[1:04:18] so Joshua
[1:04:20] is a continuation
[1:04:24] of Moses
[1:04:28] Ministry
[1:04:29] amen amen and we know Moses Ministry was
[1:04:32] not Moses he was God

[1:05:15] and money issue when they say here they
[1:05:18] didn't say you prosper in money they say
[1:05:20] prosper money including
[1:05:24] we already dealt with this
[1:05:25] so the law of Moses
[1:05:29] connected with prosperity
[1:05:35] refused good verse 8 this book of the
[1:05:40] law
[1:05:41] shall not depart out of your mouth but

[1:09:28] all right
[1:09:30] um
[1:09:37] when they built the Tabernacle they put

[1:09:41] God never came
[1:09:44] God was waiting

[1:10:00] want God in your life I must put the Ark
[1:10:03] in you
[1:10:05] [Applause]
[1:10:06] because the spirit followed the ark amen
[1:10:10] he followed the word amen
[1:10:14] [Applause]
[1:10:19] let's go to mark 11.
[1:10:27] hurry to God Mark 11. if you dare you
[1:10:31] can say Amen verse 12 the Bible says and
[1:10:34] on the morrow when they will come from
[1:10:37] Bethany thank you brother David he was
[1:10:39] hungry
[1:10:40] the one who was hungry was the man Jesus
[1:10:48] everybody okay
[1:10:50] everybody good
[1:10:52] okay and seeing a fig tree a fire off
[1:10:57] having leaves he came if happily he
[1:11:01] might find anything water so what was
[1:11:04] Jesus looking on the tree
[1:11:06] he was looking for fruit
[1:11:08] right why didn't he speaks fruit to
[1:11:11] existence
[1:11:17] he was looking for fruit
[1:11:19] instead of cursing the tree why he
[1:11:22] didn't spoke the fruit and get it
[1:11:31] because he cursed the tree and he went
[1:11:33] hungry
[1:11:39] everybody okay when he cursed the tree
[1:11:42] did he get the food so he continued to
[1:11:44] be hungry
[1:11:51] what is going on
[1:11:53] amen when the man the human man
[1:11:58] is Desiring something
[1:12:00] and when he's limit
[1:12:04] or block
[1:12:06] to access what he desired it is an
[1:12:09] opportunity for the inner men
[1:12:13] [Applause]
[1:12:16] to enter into into action in other words
[1:12:20] when you stuck it is just the beginning
[1:12:23] [Applause]
[1:12:26] when you feel like you're stuck in life
[1:12:28] just know it's just a beginning
[1:12:32] [Music]
[1:12:34] when Israel was stuck at the Red Sea he
[1:12:37] was just a road rather
[1:12:40] that road won't open if you not stuck
[1:12:44] you have to get stuck first
[1:12:51] to read God's way
[1:12:58] how many times have you been stuck into
[1:13:00] a situation then a solution happened
[1:13:02] what was God teaching you
[1:13:05] you stuck in a solution you stuck in a
[1:13:08] solution you need to learn
[1:13:10] so the next time you get stuck you say
[1:13:12] no problem that's his son
[1:13:15] [Applause]
[1:13:18] amen
[1:13:22] and he found thereon when he came to it
[1:13:25] he found nothing but water leave for the
[1:13:28] time of the Fig was not yet it looks
[1:13:32] like God made a mistake
[1:13:36] looks like
[1:13:37] he did it purposely
[1:13:41] amen and Jesus answered and said to it
[1:13:45] no man
[1:13:47] eat fruit of you Hereafter forever and
[1:13:51] his disciple heard it drop to verse 19
[1:13:55] amen
[1:13:58] and when the evening was come he went
[1:14:00] out of the city and in the morning as
[1:14:03] they passed by they saw the fig tree
[1:14:05] dried up from the root so somehow he got
[1:14:09] food in a different way
[1:14:13] the first time he was hungry he was the
[1:14:16] devil that tempted him
[1:14:18] right
[1:14:19] and Angel brought him food
[1:14:22] it's written on your Bible
[1:14:26] Angel gave a larger food in the Old
[1:14:29] Testament where did they cook that's not
[1:14:31] my problem
[1:14:33] amen and Peter calling to remember and
[1:14:36] say to him master
[1:14:38] behold the Fig Tree which you curse is
[1:14:40] withered away
[1:14:42] and Jesus answering say to them have
[1:14:45] faith in God
[1:14:47] for verily I say to you that whatsoever
[1:14:52] shall say to the whosoever shall say to
[1:14:55] this mountain be thou remove and be you
[1:14:59] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[1:15:02] the heart remember where you need to
[1:15:05] have faith but shall believe that those
[1:15:08] things which he shall say
[1:15:11] which he said shall come to pass he
[1:15:14] shall have whatsoever he says so your
[1:15:17] faith must come from the heart
[1:15:21] the faith that moved the mountain comes
[1:15:24] from within
[1:15:28] because your faith can come from two
[1:15:30] places
[1:15:31] we already established the difference
[1:15:33] between Hope and Faith
[1:15:36] amen hope is intellectual faith we
[1:15:39] already show you that but there is a
[1:15:41] faith that is coming from the heart
[1:15:42] that's the one that moved stuff
[1:15:45] job 2 verse 24 therefore I say to you
[1:15:48] what things offer or server you desire
[1:15:51] When you pray believe that you receive
[1:15:54] them and you shall have them everybody
[1:15:57] okay
[1:15:58] Lord help me to get to that let's go to
[1:16:01] Hebrew 11.
[1:16:03] if I can by God's grace if you dare you
[1:16:07] can say Amen
[1:16:09] now Faith is what
[1:16:13] of things hopeful
[1:16:15] and the evidence of things Nazi
[1:16:19] so in other words again faith is the
[1:16:24] bridge
[1:16:26] between the imagination and the reality
[1:16:30] amen
[1:16:33] [Applause]
[1:16:34] [Music]
[1:16:36] damn it
[1:16:39] we have three welders
[1:16:44] everybody okay this is the imagination
[1:16:49] amen this is the reality
[1:16:53] all the material
[1:16:56] amen
[1:16:58] amen amen over here that's the domain of
[1:17:02] Hope
[1:17:05] amen
[1:17:07] over here hope here is the invisible
[1:17:13] amen you don't see it
[1:17:15] but you see it with different eyes
[1:17:20] here
[1:17:25] when I say brother able you see him
[1:17:27] right yeah do you see him with you guys
[1:17:30] but you know who I'm talking about you
[1:17:32] know how he look like you can see
[1:17:34] brother right but you don't see him but
[1:17:37] you see Brad Abel
[1:17:40] everybody okay amen but everybody was
[1:17:43] just an example my friend
[1:17:46] you see brother you know who I'm talking
[1:17:48] about
[1:17:52] everybody okay so there is a brother
[1:17:54] able here and there is a brother able
[1:17:56] here is everybody good this is the realm
[1:18:01] of the visible
[1:18:04] if you see how many times brother Brown
[1:18:06] and preach about faith you will
[1:18:07] understand why people don't have faith
[1:18:09] amen so this area here is your faith
[1:18:19] everybody okay so faith
[1:18:22] is the step
[1:18:25] everybody okay between the invisible and
[1:18:28] the visible
[1:18:32] everybody okay amen so when you have
[1:18:35] faith
[1:18:37] it means something that was already here
[1:18:39] is in the process to become visible amen
[1:18:46] everybody okay Faith is the substance of
[1:18:51] things hoped for and the evidence of
[1:18:54] things water so Faith already got it
[1:18:57] amen
[1:19:00] in other words if you have something
[1:19:02] right here
[1:19:04] everybody okay when faith gets it you
[1:19:07] won't find it here anymore
[1:19:10] thank you
[1:19:12] everybody okay
[1:19:14] in here it's empty it's here it's empty
[1:19:18] it is already here now Faith knows how
[1:19:21] to take it from here over there amen
[1:19:27] the problem is what we call Faith is
[1:19:31] usually this
[1:19:34] all our problems stuck here
[1:19:38] all your desires are stuck here
[1:19:40] that's why you don't go nowhere
[1:19:43] and when as long as your desire is here
[1:19:46] if you speak the word it won't happen
[1:19:49] [Applause]
[1:19:52] everybody okay if you can move your
[1:19:55] desire from here to here
[1:19:57] that's it
[1:20:00] we okay
[1:20:04] verse
[1:20:06] for buy it the Elder obtain a good
[1:20:09] report
[1:20:10] true faith
[1:20:13] we understand that the world's plural
[1:20:17] were framed by the word of God
[1:20:20] so that the things which are seen
[1:20:23] visible
[1:20:25] were not made of things which do what
[1:20:28] appear in other words what happened here
[1:20:30] is only something that was from here
[1:20:33] amen amen everybody okay what was here
[1:20:38] is what becomes here so when you see it
[1:20:41] here it was actually there
[1:20:44] the one who moved it from here to here
[1:20:47] the one that is taking things from here
[1:20:50] to here is Faith amen
[1:20:57] job to verse uh five
[1:21:00] Faith Enoch was translated that he
[1:21:03] should not see death and was not found
[1:21:06] because God had translated him for
[1:21:09] before his translation you can't go
[1:21:12] without faith
[1:21:13] he had this testimony that he did water
[1:21:16] please God so before you go to the
[1:21:19] Rapture your level of Faith need to be
[1:21:21] somewhere amen
[1:21:23] if you don't have a faithful toothache
[1:21:26] forget about the rapture
[1:21:31] I have a quote
[1:21:33] that's why I'm training you on faith
[1:21:36] once you are used to Faith it is very
[1:21:40] easy to come out of this world because
[1:21:44] you already living in a supernatural
[1:21:46] world
[1:21:49] Amen in other words your battery is no
[1:21:52] longer zero
[1:21:53] your battery already charged amen you
[1:21:56] just need a little bit of charging to
[1:21:57] make it a hundred amen
[1:22:01] amen
[1:22:03] okay
[1:22:05] you heard him from there glory to God
[1:22:08] verse six thank you but with that faith
[1:22:12] it is how impossible to do water please
[1:22:16] God for he that cometh to God must
[1:22:19] believe that water he is and that he is
[1:22:22] a water rewarder roof rewarded of them
[1:22:25] that will do whatever diligently seek
[1:22:27] him
[1:22:28] amen
[1:22:30] another word in a blunt way if you don't
[1:22:34] have faith don't even go to the prayer
[1:22:36] line
[1:22:39] amen
[1:22:41] in blood way if you don't have faith
[1:22:43] don't waste your time in praying
[1:22:48] you don't get me the prayer of the
[1:22:51] righteous
[1:22:53] the prayer of what they
[1:22:57] you pray after you have faith amen
[1:23:01] [Applause]
[1:23:02] because what you're doing is a formality
[1:23:12] that's why we get the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:14] nothing happened
[1:23:16] it doesn't even cross here because you
[1:23:19] don't have faith
[1:23:21] you don't even believe
[1:23:22] but when you have faith your prayer is
[1:23:25] different amen
[1:23:28] because before you approach him you must
[1:23:30] first believe that he is the reward in
[1:23:33] other words when I'm going to him I'm
[1:23:35] not gonna come out without receiving
[1:23:38] what I'm asking amen
[1:23:42] in other words when I say Amen it means
[1:23:46] I already got whatever amen
[1:23:49] so don't say Amen when you don't have it
[1:23:51] [Applause]
[1:23:53] oh Jesus
[1:23:59] okay you will catch me later let's pray
[1:24:01] Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching

[1:24:28] this Dimension we know Lord father that
[1:24:30] you have more to come for your children

[1:24:38] powerful way as we commit it all unto
[1:24:40] the hand in the name of Jesus Christ

[1:24:47] morning
[1:24:48] is the four phases of roof

[1:25:18] we are dealing with the last phase
[1:25:20] before we move on into the banquet
[1:25:25] if the Lord Terry amen if he would like
[1:25:28] Ruth is sitting on the holiest she's
[1:25:32] preparing for the going but we're
[1:25:34] talking about what is happening what
[1:25:37] should happen to roof before the Rapture
[1:25:40] which state
[1:25:41] should be Roofing under what kind of
[1:25:45] expectation should we in before the
[1:25:48] rapture
[1:25:50] the Rapture won't take you you just
[1:25:52] ignorant or sleeping
[1:25:56] that's why the Rapture will never catch
[1:25:58] the bread anyway
[1:26:03] [Music]
[1:26:04] he's coming as a fifth in the night but
[1:26:08] whatever he's stalling is not an away

[1:26:37] feet live with the brother the brother
[1:26:39] knows that the thief is going
[1:26:41] so you must be the one that needs to be
[1:26:44] stolen amen
[1:26:47] perfect amen
[1:26:50] so when the Rapture is coming Jesus is
[1:26:53] coming to take somebody out amen the one
[1:26:56] he's taking will know that Jesus is here

[1:27:08] sir ever lost anybody no sir
[1:27:12] we have clearly identified that when you
[1:27:16] are born again
[1:27:21] glory to God Amen we have clearly
[1:27:24] identified that when we are born again
[1:27:28] in the word of God Amen it is just point
[1:27:32] zero
[1:27:35] brother Branham even say you are not
[1:27:37] even in your privilege yet
[1:27:40] you just enter into a state to begin to
[1:27:44] pick up the promises of God
[1:27:47] the Holy Spirit himself is a promise
[1:27:50] [Applause]
[1:27:51] amen but you need that promise first
[1:27:55] seek ye first the kingdom of God then
[1:27:58] that promise once you get it it will
[1:28:00] begin to catch other promise amen

[1:28:19] then everything else will be water added
[1:28:22] unto you
[1:28:25] everybody good
[1:28:26] why is this important
[1:28:30] the Holy Ghost when he comes in your
[1:28:34] life everybody okay he bring the
[1:28:37] preeminence of God's word in you amen

[1:28:53] don't really get it you're just waiting
[1:28:55] for the preacher to finish quickly 45
[1:28:58] minutes not like brother Stephen
[1:29:01] so you can go out quickly and go talk or
[1:29:04] go to the restaurant
[1:29:07] that's how we got used to go to church
[1:29:09] but when the Holy Spirit get into you
[1:29:12] the holy spirit will bring you an
[1:29:16] awareness to What God Says amen

[2:39:05] they were given to you for Earthly
[2:39:07] contact but they was giving you the

[2:39:26] in other words when the Holy Ghost come

[2:40:13] the Sixth Sense until you become a water
[2:40:15] a Christian first the kingdom of God is
[2:40:19] the only way you can ever have any more
[2:40:22] than five natural senses for the natural
[2:40:24] person but the success is better known
[2:40:27] to the Christian as what they
[2:40:31] are we okay now
[2:40:34] it is the one that govern
[2:40:38] and guide you and it's Superior to all
[2:40:43] other senses it is superior to all the
[2:40:46] senses the other five senses in other
[2:40:50] words when faith
[2:40:51] react in your life
[2:40:54] it will be something different than what
[2:40:57] you think
[2:41:02] Faith doesn't brag
[2:41:06] [Music]
[2:41:07] [Applause]
[2:41:09] usually the people who brag don't even
[2:41:12] have it
[2:41:15] foreign
[2:41:19] to take off
[2:41:22] everybody okay
[2:41:24] first don't have time to talk too much
[2:41:27] amen
[2:41:28] [Applause]
[2:41:29] Faith react
[2:41:34] let me explain it to you
[2:41:37] this is a bottle follow me carefully
[2:41:41] this is a bottle
[2:41:42] amen
[2:41:44] I close my eyes
[2:41:46] do I see the bottle
[2:41:48] when I open my eyes
[2:41:50] did you see my eyes telling me I can see
[2:41:53] this bottle
[2:41:56] did you hear my eyes telling me you know
[2:41:58] that I can tell you what color that is
[2:42:00] it
[2:42:01] well have you heard my eyes saying do
[2:42:04] you know I can tell you what color your
[2:42:06] your puddle is I can even tell you the
[2:42:08] name the eyes doesn't have that
[2:42:12] the eyes only react
[2:42:16] according to the way he was created he
[2:42:19] only declared
[2:42:21] that this is a bottle
[2:42:23] and if I'm thirsty all I have to do is
[2:42:27] acknowledge what the I say
[2:42:31] do you follow me and take the water and
[2:42:34] drink if I refuse what they I say you
[2:42:38] can die
[2:42:40] of thirsty
[2:42:42] everybody okay so when you need
[2:42:45] something Faith also act like that
[2:42:54] when I do this
[2:42:57] my eyes won't react to it
[2:43:00] the one who react is the ear
[2:43:02] because there is something about the ear
[2:43:06] that is connected to sound when it's
[2:43:08] sung the ear comes up they don't even
[2:43:12] ask you whether should that come out or
[2:43:14] what the ear will tell you which music
[2:43:16] you listen
[2:43:17] it's period Faith also when the faith of
[2:43:21] God is in you when something in his
[2:43:25] category
[2:43:28] pass his weather
[2:43:34] sometimes you sit on your porch
[2:43:37] and you are watching the neighbor just
[2:43:40] drinking maybe your cooker and suddenly
[2:43:44] what will you do
[2:43:47] right the eye told you that I didn't
[2:43:51] tell you who is there the I just told
[2:43:53] you that something is passing by it is
[2:43:55] up to you to investigate because
[2:43:57] whatever pass there went to the radar of
[2:44:01] the eye
[2:44:01] [Applause]
[2:44:10] goes to the invisible world
[2:44:12] in other words Faith have a reader
[2:44:16] looking this way that's right
[2:44:20] everybody okay everybody good
[2:44:23] whenever something crosses
[2:44:26] the red arrow faith Faith also react
[2:44:30] just like your eye react
[2:44:36] I don't know if you're kidding me you
[2:44:39] know the word faith is telling you a new
[2:44:42] house
[2:44:43] [Applause]
[2:44:46] you say what you say a new house
[2:44:55] God is sending something
[2:44:58] and I just caught it
[2:45:00] [Applause]
[2:45:01] you have to believe him
[2:45:04] [Applause]
[2:45:10] you will notice you are quiet energy and

[3:06:18] Heavenly Father
[3:06:20] Lord we are approaching you humbly this
[3:06:23] afternoon
[3:06:24] father once again we thank you for your
[3:06:27] grace
[3:06:28] we thank you for your love
[3:06:30] we thank you for your mercy and for your
[3:06:32] word that you have given us
[3:06:36] father our civilization
[3:06:39] gather hold of us
[3:06:41] for many years
[3:06:43] our tradition our custom
[3:06:47] the school that we went through
[3:06:51] we went to get education
[3:06:53] but we didn't realize also the other
[3:06:56] side what education was doing to us
[3:07:00] when it comes to your word yes
[3:07:02] until Lord father we are so educated
[3:07:06] minded
[3:07:07] that it becomes a hindrance
[3:07:10] unto the working of the Holy Spirit
[3:07:13] because everything have to make sense
[3:07:17] everything have to walk according to a
[3:07:19] pattern
[3:07:20] everything have to obey the physical
[3:07:23] laws
[3:07:25] that we start in school
[3:07:27] if it's out of order
[3:07:29] we call that magic
[3:07:32] we call that voodoo
[3:07:34] we're still giving more power to the
[3:07:36] devil
[3:07:37] than realizing that he's just a
[3:07:40] perverted
[3:07:42] but father you are bringing your
[3:07:44] children
[3:07:45] into a ram
[3:07:46] that they have to believe things they
[3:07:49] never thought
[3:07:51] they have to rise they're both
[3:07:55] what the six what the five senses is
[3:07:58] declaring
[3:07:59] so that they can access things
[3:08:01] in a different way
[3:08:03] because father the more we got
[3:08:07] The More We Begin clock
[3:08:09] but father unclog this channel
[3:08:12] so that we can look Beyond like the
[3:08:15] prophet of order
[3:08:17] and see the Unseen World
[3:08:19] and understand the Lord father
[3:08:22] that whatever we see is just limited to
[3:08:25] the senses
[3:08:26] but there is more things
[3:08:29] that are that is in the Unseen World
[3:08:31] then what we can see with our naked eye
[3:08:35] father the world of macrobiology
[3:08:37] declared yes that beyond the human eye
[3:08:40] there is many different Macross many
[3:08:44] germs many disease many macro organisms
[3:08:49] that we cannot even detect with our five
[3:08:52] senses Lord there are things living on
[3:08:55] our skin that we cannot even see with
[3:08:58] our naked eye Lord showing Lord that
[3:09:01] there is more
[3:09:02] than just what we can see in this
[3:09:05] visible world but father may you granted
[3:09:09] unto us this faith
[3:09:11] this access to the success so that we
[3:09:15] can break into that dimension and begin
