[47:15] amen
[47:17] few people say amen
[47:22] amen don't worry it's coming
[47:26] amen
[47:28] psalm chapter 130
[47:36] 125 i'm looking at 30. oh praise god
[47:40] amen i don't know why i keep looking on
[47:42] the right side brother john
[47:44] [Laughter]
[47:47] 125. so we stop in the middle of the mix
[47:51] mounted
[47:53] right
[47:54] now we're going to pick it up remember
[47:56] last sunday we spoke about the those
[47:59] that were separated as sheep and goat we
[48:02] started with the vessels of mercy
[48:05] which is the bride of jesus christ
[48:07] then from the vessels of mercy we move
[48:10] to the second step those that are not
[48:12] part of the blood
[48:14] amen they are even not believers
[48:17] amen they were just goat as goat amen
[48:22] but they have been good
[48:24] to the brother and because of that they
[48:27] enter into eternal life no one the
[48:30] brother branham said there will be
[48:32] surprise
[48:33] in heaven defeat the people you thought
[48:36] they're not gonna make it you're gonna
[48:37] see them making it there
[48:39] and some of them that you think are
[48:41] gonna make it
[48:44] will be searching for them and can find
[48:46] them
[48:47] they will be in the lake of fire
[48:50] amen
[48:51] now we move to the third stage where we
[48:54] have people not from outside but within
[48:57] the camp
[48:59] a mixed multitude
[49:02] right
[49:03] okay praise god
[49:05] psalm 125
[49:08] verse 3
[49:10] for the lord of the wicked
[49:13] this man is weakened
[49:15] shall not rest upon the lord of the
[49:18] righteous you might be seated
[49:21] so we have two people here again there
[49:23] is one
[49:24] bad
[49:26] which is a wicked
[49:28] the lord of the wicked
[49:30] and the just
[49:32] ever clear
[49:34] so the bible says that the lord of the
[49:36] wicked
[49:38] will not rest on the lord of the just
[49:41] why
[49:43] why
[49:45] for the road of the wicked shall not
[49:48] rest upon the lot of the righteous
[49:51] lest
[49:52] the righteous put forth his head their
[49:54] hands
[49:56] to water
[49:57] inequity so god
[50:00] need to separate
[50:02] the two
[50:04] amen because the longer the wicked the
[50:07] wrong seed
[50:08] abide in the camp
[50:10] it would tempt
[50:12] the righteous
[50:13] to touch what they are not supposed to
[50:16] touch
[50:17] amen
[50:18] the mixed quantities went up together
[50:20] and they caused the israel to disgust
[50:24] the manner
[50:27] amen
[50:28] so god have to remove
[50:30] that part
[50:31] amen because it begin to cause a trouble
[50:35] or it has become a stumbling block to
[50:38] the true seed of god amen so the lord
[50:42] the road of the wicked shall not stay in
[50:45] the property of the just because they
[50:48] just will be tempted
[50:51] to touch in things that they are not
[50:53] supposed to touch because it's within
[50:56] their vicinity it is around the reaching
[50:59] area amen the more you put an internet
[51:02] you put an internet you put it in it
[51:03] they just can sometimes slip up
[51:07] so they got to remove it
[51:09] amen
[51:12] let's go to act chapter 20.
[51:19] hallelujah
[51:20] so there is a mixed multitude but they
[51:22] need to be
[51:24] removed amen
[51:38] the preaching of the message is not
[51:40] motivational speech
[51:50] the preaching of the message
[51:52] it is not a motivational speech on
[51:56] tick-tock
[52:02] hallelujah
[52:03] the minister has been preaching
[52:05] motivational speeches
[52:09] to make people happy
[52:11] they tell you okay you're gonna be fine
[52:13] you go home and fall again you go home
[52:15] and fall again because the appropriate
[52:18] food is not distributed
[52:20] no matter how bizarre
[52:23] no matter how old the message look like
[52:27] that is the prescription you need
[52:50] the serpent's seed
[53:24] why did god bring those mysteries
[53:33] if it was not necessary
[53:40] it is
[53:54] because the
[54:09] exactly
[54:34] motivational speeches
[54:41] begin to long for those speeches on
[54:44] tick-tock
[54:46] they want to listen to a motivational
[54:48] spirit uh
[54:50] a speaker that's going to boost their
[54:52] their their their energy their ego
[54:56] if you want to know who you are you need
[54:58] the message of the hour
[55:00] [Music]
[55:01] [Applause]
[55:04] the message has been predestinated to
[55:07] declare your true identity
[55:09] you don't need motivational speaking
[55:17] and mixed multitude in the camper
[55:22] act chapter 20
[55:24] verse 28
[55:26] take heed therefore
[55:29] to yourself
[55:31] and to all the flock
[55:33] over the witch the holy ghost has made
[55:36] you overseer
[55:38] to feed the church of god
[55:42] which he has purchased with his own
[55:44] blood
[55:46] that church doesn't belong to you
[55:49] it is the church of the living god
[55:54] amen
[55:56] for i know this that after my departing
[56:00] shall who
[56:02] but when you look at them they're not
[56:04] gonna look like wolves
[56:08] grievous wolf
[56:10] enter in among you
[56:13] not sparing the water this kind is
[56:17] coming from outside
[56:19] do you feel me
[56:21] they were not inside they are entering
[56:23] in
[56:24] amen
[56:25] watch the second one
[56:28] verse 30.
[56:29] also second part
[56:32] of your own self
[56:34] among the group that you talk to a
[56:37] message believer
[56:39] [Music]
[56:42] those that you thought we believe the
[56:45] same thing
[56:46] we have been in church for years
[56:49] among those
[56:53] among your own self
[56:55] shall men arise
[56:57] speaking water
[57:00] they have the power of perversion
[57:04] the devil amen perverse things
[57:08] to draw away disciple after water
[57:11] the reason why they are perversing
[57:14] things which thinks are they pervading
[57:17] because a perversion is you must have
[57:20] the original first
[57:22] and then you take from the original and
[57:25] you pervert the original to take
[57:28] somebody away from the original
[57:33] and bring people disciple after them
[57:37] therefore watch
[57:38] and remember that by the space of three
[57:42] years i ceased not to warn you
[57:45] one night every night and day with water
[57:48] this apostle was crying
[57:51] why
[57:52] and now brethren i commend you to god
[57:57] the spirit and to the word of his water
[58:01] the capstone when it's coming down it's
[58:04] crying water
[58:05] i commend you to the message of your
[58:08] hour
[58:12] amen
[58:13] which is about to do what
[58:15] to build you up and to give you an
[58:18] inheritance among all them which are
[58:21] water
[58:23] what else do you need on tick-tock
[58:32] the garlic from egypt
[58:34] let's go to roman chapter seven
[58:40] two people
[58:42] one from within
[58:44] and the seed of god is right there
[58:46] a mixed multitude
[58:52] yet the mystery are supposed to clean
[58:54] you up
[58:55] to make you white and to do what to try
[58:58] you you remember on wednesday
[59:04] romans 7 verse 1
[59:07] if you dare you can say amen
[59:10] hallelujah
[59:12] amen
[59:14] no you not brethren
[59:16] for i speak to them that know the law
[59:19] how that the law has dominion over a man
[59:22] as long as he lives
[59:26] in other words he has control
[59:29] verse two for the woman
[59:31] which has a husband
[59:33] is bound by the law brother kelly
[59:36] to her husband
[59:38] so long as he leaves
[59:41] but
[59:42] if the husband be water
[59:45] so sometimes it's good
[59:51] [Music]
[59:58] it depends on which species is the
[1:00:00] husband
[1:00:02] [Music]
[1:00:07] so god have to free somebody
[1:00:19] put your belt on
[1:00:22] put your belt on
[1:00:26] if i get to where i'm going you're gonna
[1:00:29] see
[1:00:30] amen
[1:00:32] so while her oh oh my god where am i
[1:00:36] but if the husband be dead
[1:00:39] she that woman that church
[1:00:43] is loosed
[1:00:45] from the law of her water
[1:00:48] so that separation is necessary
[1:00:52] they were together but a separation must
[1:00:55] happen to save to preserve somebody
[1:00:59] to rescue somebody
[1:01:01] by separation
[1:01:05] because the righteous
[1:01:07] cannot stand with the wicked too long
[1:01:11] they're going to cause trouble in the
[1:01:12] camp
[1:01:14] [Music]
[1:01:16] amen
[1:01:17] so then if while her husband is love
[1:01:22] her husband leaves i'm sorry
[1:01:24] she has been married to another she
[1:01:26] shall be called an adulteress
[1:01:29] but if her husband be dead
[1:01:32] she is water
[1:01:34] free from that law
[1:01:36] so that she's not adulterous does she be
[1:01:39] married to another man
[1:01:42] better than the first one
[1:01:47] wherefore my brethren you also are
[1:01:50] become dead to the law
[1:01:53] by the body of christ
[1:01:55] that you should be married to another
[1:01:58] even to who
[1:02:00] who is raised from the dead to christ to
[1:02:03] unite you with christ
[1:02:05] that we should bring forth fruit to hope
[1:02:09] that you should bring forth the children
[1:02:12] of god
[1:02:13] the offspring of god
[1:02:15] so that you can be pregnanted by the
[1:02:18] word and produce the word
[1:02:21] because your first husband is a trouble
[1:02:24] death have to strike
[1:02:28] let's pray
[1:02:30] heavenly father
[1:02:32] lord we are approaching you again humbly

[1:04:35] we were continuing with the spiritual
[1:04:37] man which was the second death and the
[1:04:40] second death is the lake of fire
[1:04:42] the bible says death and hell
[1:04:45] were cast into the lake of fire this is
[1:04:48] the second
[1:04:49] death
[1:04:50] if you notice here the one that are
[1:04:53] casting the lake of fire is death
[1:04:55] and the grave
[1:04:57] that is something that is not good
[1:04:59] nobody wanted death and nobody wanted
[1:05:02] the grave amen
[1:05:04] in revelation 21 verse 8 the bible says
[1:05:07] but they're fearful the coward the one
[1:05:10] who don't want to take position for the
[1:05:12] word
[1:05:14] the one who want to keep good
[1:05:15] relationship with people despite the
[1:05:18] word of god
[1:05:21] and the unbelieving
[1:05:23] and the abominable and the murderers and
[1:05:26] the whole mongers and the sorcerers and
[1:05:30] idolaters and all liars in other words
[1:05:33] everything that is bad
[1:05:35] death is bad the grave is bad and
[1:05:39] everything that is bad where are they
[1:05:41] going shall have their part or their
[1:05:43] time in the lake which burns with fire
[1:05:47] and brimstone which is the second one
[1:05:50] so according to those two scriptures we
[1:05:53] found out that everything that we know
[1:05:55] we look we know clearly that look bad is
[1:05:59] gonna be destroyed in the lake of fire
[1:06:01] which is the second death but now we are
[1:06:04] approaching something different which is
[1:06:06] something that you don't look good
[1:06:12] but
[1:06:12] that one also need to go in the lake of
[1:06:15] fire
[1:06:17] anybody here
[1:06:19] the bible says that there is one
[1:06:21] lawgiver who is able to do it
[1:06:24] to save and to do what
[1:06:26] and we explain to you that by serving
[1:06:29] he's a lamb
[1:06:32] hallelujah
[1:06:33] by serving by salvation
[1:06:36] he is a lamb
[1:06:38] amen
[1:06:39] and then by the destruction he is leo
[1:06:42] the lion
[1:06:43] because he is coming to destroy but to
[1:06:46] the bride of jesus christ
[1:06:48] leo the lion is not leo as you think
[1:06:52] it is leo that come to slay somebody
[1:06:54] else
[1:06:55] to deliver you
[1:06:57] amen
[1:06:58] he's not bringing you to judgment
[1:07:01] because the bible says whoever believes
[1:07:03] on the lord jesus christ shall never
[1:07:05] come again to judgment but he have
[1:07:08] passed from death onto what
[1:07:10] you're going to be the one judging but
[1:07:12] you're not gonna be judged because you
[1:07:14] already been judged in christ
[1:07:17] when he died at the cross
[1:07:20] everybody clear he said who is able to
[1:07:22] save and to destroy who are that that
[1:07:25] judges another
[1:07:27] in jude chapter 3 this is where we
[1:07:29] started in the book of jude i'm gonna
[1:07:31] skip one and two the bible says beloved
[1:07:34] when i gave all diligence to write unto
[1:07:37] you of the common salvation we explain
[1:07:39] you this on wednesday he was needful for
[1:07:41] me to write unto you and to exalt you
[1:07:45] that you should earnestly contend for
[1:07:48] water
[1:07:49] the faith in other words the faith was
[1:07:51] already in danger
[1:07:53] why in danger because grievous wolf are
[1:07:56] already entering the ship everybody
[1:07:59] clear but thank god in the end time god
[1:08:03] already prepared malachi 4. so when you
[1:08:06] think that all the faith has been
[1:08:08] destroyed i shall restore say the lord
[1:08:12] amen malachi 4 stood there when the
[1:08:15] devil played play play play play when he
[1:08:18] reached malachi 4 the prophet look at
[1:08:21] him and say boo
[1:08:23] [Laughter]
[1:08:26] amen which was once delivered unto the
[1:08:29] saint
[1:08:31] for there are certain men
[1:08:33] crept in anyways you were not aware of
[1:08:36] them who were before of old
[1:08:39] ordained or predestinated to utter
[1:08:43] so it's not only the sorcerer the whole
[1:08:46] monger the prostitute the liar that had
[1:08:50] been predestinated to be destroyed in
[1:08:52] the lake of fire it is also people that
[1:08:56] believe this message
[1:09:01] hallelujah
[1:09:03] ungodly man
[1:09:04] turning water
[1:09:06] the grace of our god into lasciviousness
[1:09:10] and denying the only lord god and our
[1:09:14] lord jesus christ
[1:09:16] where i will therefore put you in
[1:09:18] remembrance don't ye once knew this
[1:09:21] how that the lord this is where we are
[1:09:23] because if we finish this side then
[1:09:25] we're gonna get the angel which left the
[1:09:28] first estate
[1:09:29] in the book of jude when we finish that
[1:09:31] then we get into sodom and gomorrah and
[1:09:34] you're going to see what's going on with
[1:09:35] the lake of fire
[1:09:37] the bible says i will therefore put you
[1:09:39] in remembrance
[1:09:41] do you want to know this how that the
[1:09:44] lord
[1:09:45] having deal on what
[1:09:47] having saved he was a lamb
[1:09:50] that's why they have to kill a lamb and
[1:09:52] eat the lamb
[1:09:54] and put the blood of the lamb on the
[1:09:55] lentil because he came as a lamb
[1:09:58] amen he want to pull them completely out
[1:10:01] of egypt
[1:10:02] but he having saved the people out of
[1:10:05] the land of egypt after all destroyed
[1:10:08] them that believe what
[1:10:10] because on wednesday we saw that not
[1:10:13] everybody have faith
[1:10:15] they can be among you and pretend to
[1:10:18] believe the message but they truly don't
[1:10:21] believe the message because there is
[1:10:23] nothing in them to decode the message
[1:10:28] brother branham said that if the devil
[1:10:31] would have taken something that was in
[1:10:33] the seventh seal he would have done
[1:10:36] great damage
[1:10:39] anybody here
[1:10:40] but the seventh seal has been opened
[1:10:44] we have it in tips
[1:10:46] we have it in books
[1:10:47] so the devil can take that and read it
[1:10:50] and cause damage no
[1:10:53] because a mystery
[1:10:56] is a divine truth
[1:10:58] that was hidden before
[1:11:01] and even though it is open brother
[1:11:04] branham said there is still a
[1:11:06] supernatural
[1:11:07] element
[1:11:09] despite the revelation
[1:11:12] if you are not predestinated to this
[1:11:14] message you can gain intellectual
[1:11:17] knowledge
[1:11:19] but the supernatural element will never
[1:11:22] be given to you it has been
[1:11:24] predestinated only to the royal seed of
[1:11:28] abraham it is a supernatural being
[1:11:31] that's gonna decode the message and make
[1:11:34] the child of god understand the message
[1:11:38] more clear than before
[1:11:43] hallelujah
[1:11:47] hallelujah
[1:11:49] that's why they told john the book is in
[1:11:52] the hand of the angel
[1:11:55] you must go where the angel is
[1:11:59] the angel the supernatural element have
[1:12:02] to give you the book
[1:12:05] not a preacher the angel himself
[1:12:08] class himself
[1:12:12] not mama not daddy it must be a personal
[1:12:16] revelation between you and the angel
[1:12:20] give me the book
[1:12:22] give me the book
[1:12:24] the angel must give you the book
[1:12:26] yourself
[1:12:28] not the pastor not the deacon not even
[1:12:32] brother branham the angel himself
[1:12:40] hallelujah
[1:12:42] where did you get your book
[1:12:44] who gave you the message
[1:12:47] if a man gave you this message and man
[1:12:50] can take the message away but if god
[1:12:53] gave you the message nobody can take the
[1:12:56] message away
[1:12:59] [Applause]
[1:13:04] hallelujah
[1:13:05] i didn't receive this message from men
[1:13:08] i receive it from god and nobody can
[1:13:11] take it away from me it belongs to me
[1:13:18] [Applause]
[1:13:23] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:13:26] hallelujah
[1:13:28] hallelujah
[1:13:30] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:13:33] my god
[1:13:35] he said having served the people
[1:13:37] out of the land of egypt
[1:13:40] after all destroyed them that believe
[1:13:42] not
[1:13:43] because they didn't have the love of the
[1:13:45] truth
[1:13:47] who was destroyed
[1:13:50] not everybody
[1:13:51] there are some people that cannot be
[1:13:53] destroyed
[1:13:55] i am one of them
[1:13:59] [Applause]
[1:14:00] [Music]
[1:14:02] hallelujah
[1:14:04] the bible say and the children of israel
[1:14:07] journey from ramses to sukkot
[1:14:10] about 600 000 on foot there were men
[1:14:14] beside children
[1:14:15] amen they mixed multitude went up also
[1:14:19] with them
[1:14:21] hallelujah
[1:14:22] and the mixed multitude that was among
[1:14:25] them
[1:14:26] fell everlasting
[1:14:28] and the children of israel also wept
[1:14:31] again and said who shall give us flesh
[1:14:34] to eat the one who started the problem
[1:14:37] was a mixed multitude
[1:14:40] amen
[1:14:41] we remember the fish
[1:14:43] which we did eat in egypt
[1:14:46] freely on internet on tick tock on
[1:14:49] facebook
[1:14:50] they coco the cucumber and the melt the
[1:14:53] cucumber and the melon and the leek and
[1:14:56] the onion on walmart
[1:14:59] and the garlic
[1:15:01] but now our soul is dried away there is
[1:15:04] nothing at all beside this water
[1:15:08] not even beside manda but besides this
[1:15:10] manner
[1:15:12] disgusting
[1:15:15] at the first time when the manner was
[1:15:17] coming everybody was happy but because
[1:15:20] of the mixed malted
[1:15:23] the manner became something like nothing
[1:15:26] this manner
[1:15:28] we begin to compare the mana with the
[1:15:30] garlic
[1:15:31] with the lick
[1:15:33] with the onion
[1:15:35] before our eyes we discovered this on
[1:15:39] wednesday now we continue
[1:15:42] your father did eat manna in the
[1:15:45] wilderness
[1:15:46] so in the wilderness
[1:15:48] buff the wicked
[1:15:50] the mixed multitude
[1:15:53] ever clear
[1:15:55] they're mixed multitude
[1:15:57] they mix multitude
[1:15:59] which are the wicked that are covered
[1:16:01] in sheep clothing
[1:16:04] in matthew you can read that
[1:16:06] everybody clear
[1:16:08] buff the wicked
[1:16:10] and they just both ate the same thing
[1:16:15] they all eat manna
[1:16:17] but what happened when they ate manna
[1:16:20] your father did eat manna in the
[1:16:22] wilderness
[1:16:24] and are dead
[1:16:26] how can you eat man and die
[1:16:31] this is that bread
[1:16:33] which came down from heaven
[1:16:36] not as your father did eat manna and are
[1:16:38] dead
[1:16:39] he the 18th of this bread shall live
[1:16:42] forever
[1:16:44] so brother branham what happened with
[1:16:46] this death
[1:16:48] they say
[1:16:49] our father eat manna in the wilderness
[1:16:52] for 40 years he said and they are
[1:16:55] everyone dead
[1:16:57] so when the disciples of jesus christ
[1:17:00] were going with jesus christ
[1:17:02] they met the pharisee
[1:17:04] the people that were in the law of moses
[1:17:07] and they begin to brag they begin to
[1:17:10] identify with the father that were in
[1:17:13] the wilderness that's why when jesus
[1:17:16] checked them he said you are of your
[1:17:18] father the devil
[1:17:20] because those that died were the
[1:17:22] children of the devil
[1:17:26] ever here they were bragging they said
[1:17:28] they were part of the group of god they
[1:17:31] were part of the message of god they
[1:17:33] also followed the prophet
[1:17:36] what do you want to say jesus look and
[1:17:38] say yes they were in the message but
[1:17:40] they were dead
[1:17:45] hallelujah
[1:17:47] dead brother branham say take that word
[1:17:50] then run it see what it means
[1:17:52] it means what
[1:17:56] so their death
[1:17:58] was not only natural but they also died
[1:18:02] spiritually forever
[1:18:05] never to be reconciled with god
[1:18:08] when the just dies
[1:18:10] he's waiting for the resurrection
[1:18:12] when the resurrection comes he's gonna
[1:18:14] rise again and he's gonna meet the lord
[1:18:17] but these will never meet the lord again
[1:18:21] they're gonna meet him on the white
[1:18:22] throne judgment
[1:18:24] as a lionel everybody
[1:18:27] yet they were water
[1:18:30] these are not sinners
[1:18:35] remember on last sunday there was an
[1:18:37] egyptian not a hebrew
[1:18:40] among an amalekite and god came and
[1:18:43] rescued the egyptian
[1:18:45] but these are pure jews
[1:18:49] but they are not jews
[1:18:54] by birth they are jews
[1:18:56] by passport they are jews
[1:18:58] by blood they are jews
[1:19:01] by id dwarven assets they are jews
[1:19:04] but by spiritual gene they are not jews
[1:19:11] they were abraham's seed
[1:19:14] death means separation
[1:19:16] inhalation
[1:19:18] completely water
[1:19:20] inhalation jesus said they were dead
[1:19:23] every one of them yet they were wet
[1:19:28] how can a circumcised judea
[1:19:32] amen
[1:19:34] how can you eat manna and die
[1:19:38] let me see somebody who ate manna and
[1:19:40] what happened to them
[1:19:42] the bible says
[1:19:44] that in deuteronomy chapter 34
[1:19:47] the bible says this that moses was what
[1:19:54] was he a young man
[1:19:56] a very old man
[1:19:59] moses was 120
[1:20:02] years old when he died
[1:20:06] but when they put moses
[1:20:09] when they look at him at his death
[1:20:13] they thought they're going to see
[1:20:14] somebody who's laying like this
[1:20:22] hallelujah
[1:20:25] when he died his eyes
[1:20:28] was not water
[1:20:32] he was 120
[1:20:35] years old but his eyes was clear 2020.
[1:20:40] what kept his eyes alive
[1:20:48] hallelujah what kept it
[1:20:50] when he dies his eyes was not dim
[1:20:54] know his natural force what
[1:20:57] what was renewing the force of death of
[1:21:01] of moses
[1:21:05] are you there
[1:21:06] when they look at moses at his death
[1:21:09] he's dead but he's dying like this
[1:21:13] 120 years
[1:21:15] what kept his strength
[1:21:21] what kept his health
[1:21:23] somebody else ate manna and died
[1:21:27] but when manna entered moses he kept
[1:21:30] moses stronger
[1:21:34] what is the result of the message in
[1:21:37] your life
[1:21:39] [Music]
[1:21:40] the more you eat the message are you
[1:21:42] getting weaker or are you getting more
[1:21:45] stronger
[1:21:49] [Music]

[1:30:06] hallelujah they grow older they're still
[1:30:09] strong because something is blocking
[1:30:12] death from uh from from from moving on

[1:30:42] amen hallelujah
[1:30:45] hallelujah
[1:30:46] the more you stay in the message the
[1:30:48] weaker you became
[1:30:50] something is wrong
[1:30:55] something is wrong
[1:30:57] the bible says in the book of acts
[1:30:59] chapter 13
[1:31:00] and the next sabbath day
[1:31:03] came almost the whole
[1:31:05] the whole city together to heal water
[1:31:09] power preached
[1:31:11] and what power preached touched the
[1:31:14] people so on the next sabbath
[1:31:18] not only the people that preached came
[1:31:21] but the entire city of gastonia came
[1:31:28] so if the entire city come
[1:31:31] to receive the word of god we all should
[1:31:33] be happy
[1:31:35] right
[1:31:36] if you're sleeping you can wake up over
[1:31:38] there you can stand over there can't be
[1:31:40] sleeping amen
[1:31:42] amen so the entire city is there
[1:31:45] to hear what
[1:31:50] we ready
[1:31:52] what happened
[1:31:54] but wonder who
[1:32:02] not the gentleman
[1:32:04] not the sinner
[1:32:08] when the jews the religious one
[1:32:11] here
[1:32:12] show the world
[1:32:19] the more interested in the crowd
[1:32:25] when they see you with a church that
[1:32:27] begin to grow
[1:32:34] when the jews saw the multitude they
[1:32:37] were filled with water
[1:32:40] jealousy
[1:32:41] how can you be jealous when people are
[1:32:45] coming to get the word of god
[1:32:49] why you didn't preach what paul preached
[1:32:55] so you can get the same benefit
[1:32:58] [Music]
[1:33:00] everybody
[1:33:02] when they are filled with envy and speak
[1:33:05] against what
[1:33:07] which was spoken by what
[1:33:09] contradicting and doing what
[1:33:12] they saw that power brought a different
[1:33:15] gospel
[1:33:17] and that gospel began to touch the life
[1:33:20] of the people and they move with
[1:33:23] jealousy
[1:33:24] and begin to speak against the world
[1:33:28] the mysteries that paul was
[1:33:34] preaching they begin to tell the people
[1:33:37] how he's preaching there is just
[1:33:39] mysteries mysteries
[1:33:41] he's just preaching intellectual they
[1:33:44] begin to speak against the message that
[1:33:47] paul was preaching
[1:33:54] everybody
[1:33:55] then paul and barnabas was bold and say
[1:34:00] it was necessary that the word of god
[1:34:03] should first have been spoken to who
[1:34:06] you are the one that was supposed to
[1:34:07] preach this message
[1:34:11] why you didn't do it
[1:34:13] we begin to preach it you get jealous
[1:34:19] what does it mean
[1:34:21] but
[1:34:22] saying he put it from you
[1:34:27] you there
[1:34:28] and judge yourself what
[1:34:31] of what
[1:34:36] rejecting the message of power was
[1:34:40] rejecting everlasting life
[1:34:45] attacking the message of the hour
[1:34:48] i'm not talking about the people outside
[1:34:51] the people inside the message
[1:34:56] you are judging yourself and worthy of
[1:34:58] the message
[1:35:02] somebody preached that 70 weeks of
[1:35:04] daniel you don't want it somebody
[1:35:06] preached the seventh color of the
[1:35:08] rainbow you don't want it revelation 4
[1:35:10] revelation 3 adoption hebrew one hebrew
[1:35:13] two all of that you don't want people to
[1:35:16] preach that
[1:35:17] you want to give the people a social
[1:35:19] gospel
[1:35:20] and when they begin to preach to preach
[1:35:23] to preach and you begin to bring effect
[1:35:26] in the life of the people people get
[1:35:28] jealous
[1:35:30] and begin to speak against it they are
[1:35:32] judging themselves and worthy of eternal
[1:35:35] life
[1:35:37] hallelujah
[1:35:39] lo we turn to the water so since you
[1:35:42] don't want it
[1:35:44] there's no eternal life for you
[1:35:46] let's turn into somebody else who did it
[1:35:48] jews
[1:35:52] hallelujah
[1:35:53] where are we heading
[1:35:55] brother branham
[1:35:57] as soon as they get over there they
[1:36:00] begin to complain
[1:36:02] they only been out in the desert
[1:36:11] they begin to say oh
[1:36:13] if i had some water
[1:36:16] if i had some
[1:36:18] they were out there
[1:36:20] and had substituted anxious food for
[1:36:23] what
[1:36:25] and was what
[1:36:27] why
[1:36:31] [Music]
[1:36:35] why was the manner strengthening
[1:36:37] somebody but he was killing somebody
[1:36:40] else
[1:36:41] he depend on your tummy
[1:36:50] not natural tommy
[1:36:53] but spiritual tummy
[1:36:55] because the bible said john come
[1:36:58] take the book and do what
[1:37:00] and it's gonna be what sweet in your
[1:37:03] mouth but what
[1:37:05] there was not this belly
[1:37:08] it was another belly the belly of the
[1:37:11] heart
[1:37:13] because men shall not live by bread
[1:37:15] alone but by every water
[1:37:17] that word is going to the heart
[1:37:20] it depends on what was in the heart
[1:37:28] [Music]
[1:37:29] why
[1:37:30] they're telling the gastronomic was not
[1:37:33] able to water
[1:37:36] digest the water
[1:37:37] they were not programmed for the message
[1:37:40] of the hour
[1:37:41] [Music]
[1:37:43] when together you killed them
[1:37:48] hallelujah
[1:37:49] they don't hold on
[1:37:51] they go on
[1:37:52] they go back
[1:37:54] just the first little thing rise up
[1:37:56] complain
[1:37:58] first
[1:37:59] stew
[1:38:00] a church that get one of them
[1:38:03] things started
[1:38:05] it's like a water
[1:38:09] that's why the surgeon knife have to
[1:38:11] come to begin to cut that cancer out
[1:38:18] and give you even some chemo
[1:38:24] are you there
[1:38:25] he shall kill the whole church
[1:38:28] that's right we ought to get started and
[1:38:31] get it out
[1:38:32] now when there was not going very far
[1:38:36] eating angels food come down from heaven
[1:38:40] and was complaining and they were
[1:38:42] drinking a water from water
[1:38:45] the water
[1:38:47] holy waters of life and was water
[1:38:51] they wanted the muddy water of water
[1:38:54] from tick-tock
[1:38:59] from jimmy schwagert
[1:39:04] from pd jets
[1:39:11] from john austin
[1:39:13] something that is more philosophical and
[1:39:16] makes sense
[1:39:20] hallelujah
[1:39:22] a mixed multitude the phenomena had been
[1:39:25] done a big revival was on people were
[1:39:28] getting saved coming in and a group went
[1:39:31] up impersonating that
[1:39:34] they went up acting like they were water
[1:39:37] sure they put on their sandals and
[1:39:40] everything and got ready but the same
[1:39:42] mixed multitude that taken communion and
[1:39:45] went on the march was the very one that
[1:39:48] began to do water
[1:39:50] and caused the children of heart
[1:39:54] of israel their heart to turn back to
[1:39:57] water
[1:39:59] that is what it is tonight brother have
[1:40:02] a revival and there will be a water
[1:40:06] certain as anything some of them will
[1:40:08] try to come in impersonating when you
[1:40:11] talk of what
[1:40:13] it depends on where they come from from
[1:40:16] there
[1:40:19] hallelujah
[1:40:21] the strange thing there was a mixed
[1:40:24] melted eating the same manner
[1:40:27] people who are water
[1:40:29] who does not accept the lord jesus
[1:40:32] christ
[1:40:33] can still enjoy seeing the moving of the
[1:40:36] miracle of god healing the sick can
[1:40:38] rejoice in the people doing right can
[1:40:41] open their heart and rejoice in a sermon
[1:40:44] that preach under the anointing that is
[1:40:46] the same type of manna that the
[1:40:48] christian is what
[1:40:51] same manner it's killing one
[1:40:53] it is giving strength to the other
[1:40:56] if you notice what caused this trouble
[1:40:59] there was a mixed multitude went up with
[1:41:01] them the supernatural has been done down
[1:41:04] in egypt and when the supernatural has
[1:41:06] been done
[1:41:07] everybody flocked to it it caused a
[1:41:10] mixed multitude to go with them
[1:41:13] are regenerated
[1:41:16] and converted heart
[1:41:19] growing up
[1:41:20] trying to impersonate the water
[1:41:23] they're never worried will be a believer
[1:41:25] to begin with
[1:41:26] [Music]
[1:41:28] they were with you but they were not
[1:41:30] believers
[1:41:33] they can tell you what moses said but in
[1:41:36] their heart they didn't believe what
[1:41:39] moses says
[1:41:40] that's why jesus said if you have
[1:41:42] believed moses you should believe me
[1:41:47] because moses prepared me
[1:41:49] but because you miss that preparation
[1:41:52] there is no way you can get me
[1:41:54] [Music]
[1:41:55] hallelujah
[1:41:57] and it's then the day of noah it was in
[1:42:01] that in in that in the days of jesus
[1:42:04] it's prophesied in god's word for to be
[1:42:07] the same thing in this day the
[1:42:09] supernatural has been done and there is
[1:42:11] a mixed multitude gone up and he
[1:42:13] regenerated hearts not conditioned not
[1:42:16] keeping god's word but impersonating
[1:42:19] something
[1:42:20] amen
[1:42:22] that's why the slightest opportunity
[1:42:24] that happened day out
[1:42:26] because they never believed it to begin
[1:42:28] with
[1:42:29] they were having long chests but they
[1:42:31] never believed the message
[1:42:33] amen we found out that the exodus meant
[1:42:37] they're calling out god separating his
[1:42:40] people from the unbeliever
[1:42:42] and then along we found out in the
[1:42:45] scripture that there was a mixed
[1:42:47] multitude that went up
[1:42:48] and that is what got the real believer
[1:42:51] in water
[1:42:52] because he was a mixed multitude
[1:42:55] there was the one
[1:42:57] who melted their earring and saw fort
[1:43:00] and made the water
[1:43:05] so not everybody was responsible for the
[1:43:09] golden calf
[1:43:10] he was the mixed malted that created the
[1:43:14] golden calf
[1:43:17] here
[1:43:18] to go back to egypt
[1:43:20] when the phenomenon is done the miracle
[1:43:23] of god was performed and everybody
[1:43:25] really to it and then a mixed multitude
[1:43:28] followed out because they were going
[1:43:30] they were circumcised
[1:43:32] and kept the passover and so forth but
[1:43:35] still they were a water
[1:43:37] unbelievers with the
[1:43:43] unbeliever to the word of the hour
[1:43:47] yet among you
[1:43:49] amen
[1:43:50] amen a mixed multitude went out
[1:43:54] a mixed group of people
[1:43:56] some of them believers some pretending
[1:43:59] to believe
[1:44:01] people went out as professed believers
[1:44:04] and there was not believers
[1:44:07] that is where a great bunch of trouble
[1:44:09] is today
[1:44:11] we could put our fingers on him is men
[1:44:15] and women who come into church
[1:44:18] and profess to be believers of this
[1:44:21] message
[1:44:22] and they are not believers
[1:44:24] i have found it in the world
[1:44:31] preacher that professed to believe
[1:44:33] brother brother
[1:44:35] but then don't believe the message of
[1:44:37] brother branham
[1:44:38] give them the word and look how they
[1:44:41] react
[1:44:44] tell them brother branham say this
[1:44:47] you're going to hear somebody telling
[1:44:48] you we are not in the days of brother
[1:44:50] branham
[1:44:51] yet preaching the message
[1:44:57] hallelujah i have found it in the pulpit
[1:45:01] i have found it in a prayer line i have
[1:45:03] found it where
[1:45:06] where men come in and women who say i'm
[1:45:09] a believer and profess to be a believer
[1:45:12] and they are not believer a mixed
[1:45:14] multitude
[1:45:17] hallelujah
[1:45:19] what's going on
[1:45:22] if you look at this situation
[1:45:24] you will think like god fell
[1:45:28] god did nothing
[1:45:30] god will keep those that belong to him
[1:45:34] and we leave lucifer what belonged to
[1:45:37] lucifer
[1:45:38] when jesus was dying at the cross
[1:45:42] there was one that belonged to him
[1:45:44] jesus picked him up to paradise
[1:45:47] but the other one needed a cargo
[1:45:51] they needed also l.l a means of
[1:45:54] transportation
[1:45:56] do you know what happened to them
[1:45:58] judah said yes i am the cargo
[1:46:01] judah went and hanged himself
[1:46:05] in order to pick up the other one and to
[1:46:07] take him also down there one
[1:46:10] transporting one the other transporting
[1:46:13] the other
[1:46:15] i have lost nobody
[1:46:18] nothing except the what the son of
[1:46:21] perdition
[1:46:23] the son of
[1:46:24] hell he doesn't belong to me
[1:46:28] that's not my child god seek his father
[1:46:30] this is my child give me my child
[1:46:35] hallelujah
[1:46:39] transportation
[1:46:41] not as though the word of god has taken
[1:46:43] non-effect
[1:46:45] when you see these things it doesn't
[1:46:47] mean that the word of god is not
[1:46:48] effective
[1:46:50] why are people living
[1:46:52] why some can't stand it anymore
[1:46:55] god have not lost his power
[1:46:58] the key is this
[1:46:59] [Music]
[1:47:01] the key is this
[1:47:02] hallelujah
[1:47:04] for they are not all
[1:47:07] which are of what
[1:47:12] we are not talking about the world and
[1:47:15] israel we're talking about israel within
[1:47:19] israel
[1:47:26] israel naturally and israel spiritually
[1:47:30] you can be in the natural israel but you
[1:47:33] are not in the spiritual israel
[1:47:40] you can be naturally in the message
[1:47:45] but you are not the message
[1:47:54] they are all not israel which are of
[1:47:57] what
[1:47:58] needed because they are the seed of
[1:48:01] abraham are they all what
[1:48:04] but in isaac shall that seed become
[1:48:08] that is
[1:48:09] they which are the children of the flesh
[1:48:13] these are not the children of god
[1:48:16] but the children of the world
[1:48:18] are counted for water
[1:48:21] for their children being not yet born
[1:48:24] neither having done any good or evil
[1:48:27] that the purpose of god according to
[1:48:30] adam
[1:48:31] masten not of what
[1:48:34] but of him that do what
[1:48:36] it is israel but with a mixed multitude
[1:48:41] naturally israel israel you only need
[1:48:44] the spiritual gene
[1:48:46] to detect who truly is israel
[1:48:51] hallelujah
[1:48:53] know ye therefore that day which are of
[1:48:56] faith

[1:54:47] for those worrying on time we good
[1:54:53] verse 1
[1:54:55] and samuel died
[1:54:57] and all israel and all the israelites
[1:55:00] were gathered together and lamented him
[1:55:03] in other words they were mourning
[1:55:05] and buried him in his house
[1:55:07] at rhema
[1:55:09] and david arose and went down to the
[1:55:12] wilderness of perrin
[1:55:15] you ready now
[1:55:16] okay let's go and there was as a man in
[1:55:20] mount
[1:55:22] moun was a tribe in the tribe of judah
[1:55:26] whose possession his business were in
[1:55:29] carmel
[1:55:30] so this man was not living in carmen
[1:55:34] he was in mountain
[1:55:36] in the city of mount
[1:55:39] but
[1:55:40] this is his house
[1:55:42] in muhammad
[1:55:43] mahon
[1:55:44] but his business
[1:55:46] was in the city of carmel
[1:55:50] that's where he owns business
[1:55:52] is very clear
[1:55:55] and there was a man in my own whose
[1:55:57] possession were in carmel and the man
[1:56:00] was very great this was a very rich man
[1:56:04] a big man
[1:56:06] and he had three dozen sheep
[1:56:10] and a thousand water
[1:56:12] if you notice his flock contains sheep
[1:56:15] and goats
[1:56:19] [Laughter]
[1:56:21] anybody clear
[1:56:23] so he got shepherd for sheep and goat
[1:56:27] the thousands three thousand sheep and a
[1:56:30] thousand goats
[1:56:31] he was shearing his ship at water
[1:56:35] when they said shearing the ship there
[1:56:38] is a key to this
[1:56:42] let me stop right there
[1:56:44] and read it over again now
[1:56:46] there was a man in my home whose
[1:56:48] possession were in carmel and the man
[1:56:50] was very great a very rich man and he
[1:56:53] had three thousand sheep and a thousand
[1:56:56] goat and he was shearing his sheep in
[1:56:58] carmel this was the time
[1:57:01] or the hour of the shearing of sheep
[1:57:06] here it was the time of the shearing of
[1:57:09] sheep
[1:57:10] if you notice this shearing is not the
[1:57:13] shearing of god
[1:57:16] anybody care but the time that they were
[1:57:19] shearing the sheep
[1:57:22] what is important in that time
[1:57:24] brother branham
[1:57:26] what we need today
[1:57:28] is to submit all your rights
[1:57:31] is to let god
[1:57:34] lay you down and shave all your rights
[1:57:37] off of you
[1:57:39] amen could you imagine how a leader or
[1:57:42] lamb
[1:57:43] or fleece hanging over that is his right
[1:57:47] but the problem imitate the painting
[1:57:48] lamb
[1:57:49] burn up and then just lay up on the
[1:57:52] shearing table
[1:57:53] they know what is best for him
[1:57:56] take all of his right away from him
[1:58:00] and share it off
[1:58:02] how cool and light he runs
[1:58:05] in other words this ship
[1:58:07] was heavy laden
[1:58:09] with a lot of wool
[1:58:11] he want to run but too much wall he
[1:58:14] wanna do too heavy he can't go he can't
[1:58:16] go they said no no we need we know what
[1:58:18] is good for this ship
[1:58:21] bring the sheep not the god
[1:58:25] put them on the table remove all the
[1:58:28] excess water
[1:58:30] and when they remove it the sheep begin
[1:58:33] to jump the sheep begin to be
[1:58:39] the will have to be separated from the
[1:58:42] womb
[1:58:46] [Music]
[1:58:47] there was a certain wall that was
[1:58:50] causing heaviness
[1:58:52] that wall need to be taken off
[1:58:56] to make the ship run his cause freely

[2:14:45] that need to be free from here from from
[2:14:48] excess water

[2:15:14] is pen a good number
[2:15:19] why did david use 10
[2:15:22] why he didn't use 12
[2:15:24] because remember when eliezer went
[2:15:27] to get rebecca elias had 10 camels
[2:15:32] and brother branham said one of them was
[2:15:34] the word
[2:15:36] about here you remember that
[2:15:39] and 10 minus
[2:15:41] minus one equal what
[2:15:43] equal nine
[2:15:44] you have the word and the non-spiritual
[2:15:47] gift
[2:15:48] sent to get rebecca out
[2:15:55] did you get me
[2:15:57] do you want me to repeat
[2:16:02] the bible says there were ten cameras
[2:16:05] loaded with gift
[2:16:07] that was sent to get rebecca brother
[2:16:09] branham said one of the camera was the
[2:16:12] word
[2:16:13] he was the holy spirit that's the one
[2:16:15] rebecca gave water and that's the one
[2:16:18] that carried rebecca all the way back
[2:16:20] home but the nine of them must be there
[2:16:23] we must preach the word with the nine
[2:16:25] gift the full word
[2:16:31] hallelujah
[2:16:32] and david also to go to that side he
[2:16:35] pick up 10.
[2:16:37] but brother branham said 10 is a bad
[2:16:39] number
[2:16:42] hallelujah
[2:16:44] oh my god brother bottom said 10 is a
[2:16:48] bad number that's right to start with 10

[2:16:55] they had 10 tribe on israel and their
[2:16:57] then them was just all water
[2:17:00] he had to take joseph's two sons if from
[2:17:03] him and manasseh the prophet showed them
[2:17:05] and blessed them to bring them to twelve
[2:17:07] the number of worship
[2:17:10] david took ten
[2:17:13] amen
[2:17:15] paul says
[2:17:17] that to the weak

[2:17:49] paul say because of the gospel
[2:17:52] sometimes i must remain weak
[2:17:58] but i am weak to
[2:18:00] rescue somebody
[2:18:05] relax keep your belt
[2:18:08] in second corinthians chapter five the
[2:18:11] bible says for he has made him to be
[2:18:14] what
[2:18:18] who knew not sin that we might be mad
[2:18:21] the what
[2:18:22] jesus became sin
[2:18:27] not that jesus was sinful
[2:18:30] but sometime

[2:29:05] and they spoke the voice of david and
[2:29:07] they stop where david stop
[2:29:10] [Music]
[2:29:13] what is the reaction
[2:29:15] from the word
[2:29:17] will determine
[2:29:18] what is the inside seed
[2:29:21] are you there
[2:29:24] verse 10 and never answer david's
[2:29:27] servant and say who is david
[2:29:30] this is not like he's asking
[2:29:33] to know who is this man david no he was
[2:29:36] a man of judah
[2:29:38] he knew who david was but it is a talk
[2:29:42] of disgust
[2:29:44] who is this david
[2:29:47] david david david who is he
[2:29:51] who is this david
[2:29:53] who is the son of what
[2:29:55] how did he know he was the son of jesus
[2:29:58] he knew him but he's just belittling
[2:30:00] david
[2:30:02] and be telling his message
[2:30:06] a mixed multitude
[2:30:09] are you there who is the son of jesse
[2:30:12] there be many servants nowadays
[2:30:16] that break away every man from his water
[2:30:20] david
[2:30:22] didn't cause a division with saul
[2:30:29] a unclean soul rejected the word of god
[2:30:34] when saul rejected the word of god an
[2:30:37] unclean spirit entered soul
[2:30:41] and because of that condition he calls
[2:30:45] separation
[2:30:47] but even though david is innocent he has
[2:30:51] been accusing gossip like somebody who
[2:30:54] caused trouble to his master
[2:31:00] it's all over the message
[2:31:06] the poor david
[2:31:08] i just separated i could do harm to him
[2:31:11] but because he was called of the lord
[2:31:14] and it is one i didn't want to pull my
[2:31:16] shift
[2:31:17] i say may the lord deal with him
[2:31:19] i'm taking my hand off
[2:31:21] i'm going
[2:31:22] but still he was treated as a malefactor
[2:31:27] he was counted among the male factor
[2:31:30] like somebody who did something wrong to
[2:31:32] saul
[2:31:36] [Music]
[2:31:37] and that's what has been giving to other
[2:31:40] people
[2:31:43] and he who is the son of jesse there'll
[2:31:45] be many servants nowadays that break
[2:31:48] away every man from his master
[2:31:51] they thought he was a male factor yeah
[2:31:54] he might be some of those yeah nowadays
[2:31:56] everybody's the division the division
[2:31:58] this one leave this church so he's the
[2:31:59] same one that did the same thing
[2:32:02] innocent
[2:32:04] shall i take my bread and my water and
[2:32:07] my flesh that i have killed for my
[2:32:09] shearers
[2:32:10] and give it to the men
[2:32:12] whom i know not where they be
[2:32:18] they say he came from
[2:32:22] africa
[2:32:32] hallelujah
[2:32:34] so david's young men
[2:32:36] turned away
[2:32:38] and went again and came and told him of
[2:32:42] those saying
[2:32:44] verse 13
[2:32:45] and david said to his men
[2:32:47] guard you on every man his water
[2:32:55] the lamb
[2:32:56] turn into the water
[2:33:03] the god that can save can also do what
[2:33:10] amen
[2:33:12] gird on every man his sword and the gird
[2:33:15] on every man his water
[2:33:17] his sword and david also girded on his
[2:33:21] sword the sword that he got from goliath
[2:33:24] it's a whole mystery
[2:33:26] and there went after david about 400 men
[2:33:30] and 200 above by the staff
[2:33:32] and one of the young men told abigail
[2:33:35] nebel's wife saying behold david sent
[2:33:38] messenger out of the wilderness to
[2:33:41] salute our
[2:33:42] master and he wailed on them
[2:33:45] but the men were very good to us
[2:33:48] and where
[2:33:49] and we were not hurt
[2:33:51] neither missed we anything as long as
[2:33:54] they were conversant with them oh sorry
[2:33:58] as long as we were conversant with them
[2:34:00] we were living with them when we were in
[2:34:03] the field

[2:34:32] amen
[2:34:34] all the while we were with them keeping

[2:34:41] know and consider what you will do for
[2:34:44] evil is determined against our master
[2:34:48] and against all his household for he is
[2:34:52] such a son of water

[2:34:58] so he was really really bad
[2:35:00] that a man cannot water

[2:35:06] to heal nobody
