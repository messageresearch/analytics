[8:07] don't stop where you are keep moving
[8:09] [Music]
[8:09] [Applause]
[8:15] up father help me up are we okay are we
[8:19] okay have I shake you shake and pretty
[8:23] good I'm putting shcking so I can add
[8:25] more everybody okay where is this idea
[8:30] of Daily Bread coming
[8:34] from where is this idea coming from
[8:37] because Solomon make a big
[8:40] statement Solomon says this go ahead my
[8:43] friend remove far from me vanities and
[8:47] lies come on and not give me neither
[8:51] poverty nor
[8:53] riches say amen
[8:58] amen Hot Potato right Hot Potato right
[9:03] Solomon is is talking about what poverty
[9:06] and what and riches Solomon said don't
[9:10] give me what poverty nor riches so if
[9:13] somebody's poor he's out of the will of
[9:16] God because brother brandham said the
[9:18] majority of Christian are
[9:22] poor Lazarus died
[9:25] poor and he went to
[9:28] heaven and he was with
[9:32] Abraham brother Bram say I don't say
[9:34] that in in the rich category God doesn't
[9:37] have children God have his children that
[9:39] are poor that are
[9:43] rich what is Solomon
[9:49] saying Shake somebody's hand say God
[9:51] bless
[9:54] you can we continue now can we
[9:58] continue can you continue it was just
[10:01] for five second then we go we get can I
[10:04] continue let's go my friend he says give
[10:07] me neither what poverty no what riches
[10:11] but feed me for what food convenient for
[10:14] me if you look and another the
[10:17] translation it means give me my daily
[10:24] bread Solomon say don't get me to
[10:27] Poverty don't get me to reaches but give
[10:30] me what is needful for the day what is
[10:34] my daily bread
[10:38] it Solomon say give me my daily
[10:43] bread
[10:45] amen why he says because lest I be how
[10:50] full and do what deny thee and say what
[10:53] who is the Lord so when you are full
[10:55] there is a
[10:57] tendency to be
[11:02] self-sufficient slowly my friend slowly
[11:05] my friend full goes with
[11:09] self-sufficiency I don't need God
[11:11] anymore amen come on and and all lest I
[11:17] be how full
[11:19] poor we already finished lest I be full
[11:22] and deny the and say who is the Lord or
[11:25] Les I be poor and do what Ste is every
[11:28] poor people did they still
[11:32] no you need to know how to apply
[11:34] scripture if you poor then you are
[11:38] what can you say the Bible please just
[11:40] repeat the Bible not you repeat the
[11:45] Bible steal and take the name of God in
[11:54] what soet trouble Solomon say give give
[11:59] me my daily bread where is this idea of
[12:02] Daily Bread starting from where is it
[12:06] let's go to Exodus
[12:08] 16 let's lay now that
[12:11] Foundation if you thereare you can say
[12:13] Amen just leave Solomon alone we will
[12:16] pick up on
[12:20] Solomon
[12:22] amen
[12:24] amen because I know people that are
[12:26] blessed that are true Christian amen
[12:30] and people that are poor they cast all
[12:32] the
[12:33] time and they're not
[12:35] Christian they cast all the time they
[12:37] lie all the time and I also Rich that
[12:41] lies and I also poor that are
[12:46] Christian you need to know how
[12:50] you how you calibrating your your
[12:54] shot the church must have high ambition
[12:57] amen amen amen amen amen amen let's go
[13:02] to uh Exodus chapter 16 if you thereare
[13:06] you can say Amen where is this
[13:09] idea of Daily Bread comes from where is
[13:13] he coming
[13:14] from Exodus 16 verse1 follow me
[13:19] carefully Lord help me if I can get to
[13:21] this Divine hunger you there verse one
[13:25] let's go friend and they took their
[13:28] Journey from elen and all the
[13:31] congregation of the children of Israel
[13:34] came to the Wilderness of what sin it's
[13:37] strange that name is sin so Israel left
[13:41] Egypt and when they left Egypt
[13:44] everything was going well and suddenly
[13:47] God took Israel because the one who was
[13:50] leading Israel was not Moses he was the
[13:53] pillar of fire leading Moses and Moses
[13:56] was leading the the the the the the the
[14:00] the what children of Israel that's why
[14:02] Paul say follow me as I follow Christ
[14:04] amen are we together so the pillar of
[14:07] fire took them into the
[14:10] Wilderness amen this Wilderness is
[14:13] called the
[14:16] Wilderness the
[14:18] Wilderness of sin you know what sin
[14:22] means that's the name of the Wilderness
[14:25] everybody okay God took them to the
[14:28] wilderness what
[14:29] happened he took them to the Wilderness
[14:32] of sin which is between Elm and S on the
[14:37] what 15th day of the what second month
[14:40] of the second month after their
[14:43] departing out of what the land of Egypt
[14:46] so Israel Journey for some time before
[14:50] they hit the Wilderness so why did God
[14:55] take them into the Wilderness when
[14:57] Israel left to Egypt they never travel
[15:01] Into the Wilderness right away they were
[15:03] going into good places and they met the
[15:06] Red Sea and the Lord open up the Red Sea
[15:08] and they begin to move and God was
[15:10] looking his calendar God said this is
[15:13] the first day let them keep moving
[15:15] second day let them keep moving and God
[15:17] look at the congregation say let them
[15:18] keep moving as soon as this date reach
[15:21] God say Moses changed the GPS the GPS
[15:25] toward elim and toward s but p through
[15:28] the Wilderness are we together then
[15:31] suddenly Israel arriv at the Wilderness
[15:34] what happened in this Wilderness are we
[15:37] together verse uh two and the whole
[15:41] Congregation of what the children of
[15:44] Israel did what murmured against Moses
[15:47] and who Aaron in the what Wilderness
[15:50] they didn't murmur before the Wilderness
[15:53] that's right they murmur only in the
[15:56] wilderness so the will Wilderness
[16:01] trigger the
[16:03] murmuring amen and the
[16:08] complaint amen what happened my friend
[16:11] Lord help me load this verse three and
[16:14] the children of Israel say to them Moses
[16:17] and Aaron would to God that we do what
[16:21] had died by the hand of the Lord in the
[16:23] land of what Egypt in other words it was
[16:26] good for God to have kill us in
[16:29] Egypt because now it looks like God is
[16:32] about to kill us but it was better for
[16:35] us to die in
[16:38] Egypt why what is trying to kill them
[16:41] follow me carefully he says W to God we
[16:45] had di in the hand of the Lord in the
[16:47] land of what Egypt when we sat by the
[16:50] what flesh Parts come on and we did ate
[16:55] what bread and what to the fo stop so
[16:58] Israel say when we were in Egypt we had
[17:02] meat we had flesh we had
[17:05] steak amen and we also had bread and we
[17:09] headed to the food so when we were in in
[17:12] Egypt we ate with fo we ate with f it
[17:15] was better for us to die in the place
[17:19] that we are satisfied with our food then
[17:22] to take us in the place where there is
[17:24] no
[17:27] food kill me where I'm in plenty but
[17:31] don't kill me where I'm be that's what
[17:34] Israel is saying are we together in
[17:37] other word when Israel reached the
[17:41] Wilderness of sin all the
[17:45] supplier all the provision of Israel run
[17:51] out in other words God took a time
[17:55] because Israel leaving Egypt pack
[17:58] provision right and as Israel was moving
[18:01] forward God look and he saw that
[18:05] everybody is having a pizza in the bag
[18:08] this one carry rice this one carry this
[18:11] this one carry this he say Israel will
[18:13] not for they will not listen to anything
[18:17] God say Moses keep take them into
[18:20] 485 and let them keep moving this way
[18:23] all I'm waiting is for them to use up
[18:25] all their
[18:27] food are you following me when Israel is
[18:31] journeying a child is see is hungry mama
[18:34] mama mama need food mama just open the
[18:36] pack and give the child bread oh we
[18:38] going to the promised land Hallelujah he
[18:40] say no problem hey Daddy I'm hungry
[18:42] let's sit down they open plenty of food
[18:45] plenty of food and God keep waiting for
[18:46] them and he reach a time when they say
[18:50] mama mama where is food when Mama opened
[18:53] the pack she seemed like it's two bread
[18:57] left are we together and Mama give the
[19:00] bread but now Mom is a little bit
[19:02] careful like uh you don't play with food
[19:05] like the way we are playing because
[19:07] since we start this journey we have not
[19:09] seen no flight attendant coming around
[19:11] here and begin to dispatch food right
[19:14] here since we start this flight
[19:16] everything is just the way we is we are
[19:18] using our own
[19:19] resources are we together so when they
[19:22] reach the Wilderness of sin everybody
[19:25] open their provision empty
[19:29] dry it's dry do you have water there my
[19:33] water is finished but I saw you packing
[19:36] Pizza when we were leaving Egypt the
[19:38] children finish everything so which
[19:40] direction are we
[19:42] going my God the
[19:45] Wilderness when we are empty and we hit
[19:48] the
[19:50] Wilderness
[19:53] Moses but we thought this journey is
[19:55] three
[19:56] days now it's it's more than 3 days and
[20:00] now we are in the condition that all our
[20:02] provision run out Hallelujah there is
[20:06] nothing we can depend
[20:09] onen and God chose the setting to be the
[20:13] Wilderness what is in the
[20:17] wilderness everybody okay listen to
[20:19] brother Bram my friend brother brandham
[20:21] say wherever Christ is there is what

[20:27] the Earth all what the curse of the
[20:30] Earth the curse of the earth will be how

[41:49] what sin is what not hope for what a man
[41:53] do what see what does he have yet what
[41:56] hope so God doesn't want you to even see

[42:16] Tru because if you bring any Tru they
[42:19] won't have faith that's it because they
[42:22] will begin to Hope because they saw the
[42:24] track and they know that food is there
[42:27] destroy all evidence I want them to
[42:30] begin to hope for something they don't
[42:32] see they just have to depend on what I
[42:36] say my word is what they need men shall
[42:42] not live by bread alone but by every
[42:45] word the word is what they need to
[42:48] understand I'm trying to make them
[42:50] understand to depend on what I say
[42:55] Amen am listen to this Lord help me in
[42:59] Deuteronomy 2 verse 7 the bible say for
[43:03] the Lord th God has did what bless thee
[43:06] where in all the works of thy hand I got
[43:09] to stop he says the Lord th God has
[43:12] blessed thee in all the work of what thy
[43:16] hand we want to know where was Israel
[43:19] blessed because God blessed them with
[43:22] the work of their hand where what was th
[43:26] work what were they working he says he
[43:29] knoweth th walking through this water
[43:32] Great
[43:33] Wilderness this how many years 40
[43:36] years the Lord th God has been with who
[43:40] thee
[43:42] th nothing so Israel was blessed in the
[43:49] wilderness so whatever Israel was doing
[43:53] in the wilderness may be taking care of
[43:56] the C God begin to bless them in a bad
[44:00] place that's
[44:04] right God was not blessing Israel in a
[44:08] fertile land sir because Israel will say
[44:11] this land is fertile God blessed them in
[44:15] the land where you cannot teal you
[44:17] cannot swow you cannot reap but whatever
[44:20] Israel
[44:22] does they found out that he works
[44:26] if Israel got cattle cattle begin to
[44:29] grow if Israel got C what goat goat
[44:33] begin to multiply if Israel got sheep
[44:35] sheep begin to multiply everything is
[44:38] multiplying in the
[44:43] wilderness and in the wilderness every
[44:46] day you must depend on God to provide
[44:51] food and God told Moses I'm going to
[44:53] stop for the sake of time that go gather
[44:57] an armor which is the measurement for
[45:00] one man and take that one and put it in
[45:04] the
[45:07] Tabernacle so that the high priest will
[45:10] have something to eat that's right every
[45:13] time they go there everybody okay
[45:17] everybody okay so the high priest in the
[45:19] man all is man in other words the
[45:23] Wilderness was a place where God God
[45:26] begin to break the self-sufficiency of a
[45:33] man God begin to break every ability of
[45:37] a man so that man can now go back to his
[45:41] original position amen and his original
[45:45] position is that man must depend on the
[45:47] word amen and not on his strength not on
[45:52] his potential but depend on what God
[45:55] says
[45:58] don't look at your future don't plan for
[46:01] your future if you plan and make the
[46:04] Mana
[46:05] stank if you want to to to accumulate
[46:09] more I destroy it I want you to start
[46:12] living day by day as a people that
[46:16] follow me as a people that feel me every
[46:19] day you must seek me every day you must
[46:22] come to me every day you must depend on
[46:24] me and when you depend on me then I give
[46:28] you what you want sir yes
[46:31] sir everybody okay everybody
[46:35] good let's stop here my
[46:37] friend my time is up because if I dig
[46:40] into this I'm digging into something
[46:44] else where we
[46:46] stop God is taking us to the Wilderness
[46:49] where is this idea of Daily Bread coming
[46:52] from the idea of daily bread is coming
[46:54] from Mana amen where God begin to train
[46:58] a nation to depend on him every day
[47:03] without relying on their personal
[47:06] resources or the personal potential or
[47:09] the potential of Any Nation or any
[47:13] country because in the wilderness there
[47:15] was no Nation there was no president
[47:18] there was no DSS there was nobody there
[47:22] but God and you alone right all
[47:25] provision gone that's right all
[47:27] possibility gone every day you depend on
[47:31] me amen sometime you went through the
[47:35] Wilderness and some of you are still
[47:37] going there that's why sometime you see
[47:41] you are living paycheck by
[47:48] paycheck as soon as all your bill are
[47:50] done it looks like there is not much
[47:52] left right that's
[47:54] right because you want to accumulate and
[47:57] the bill suck it up and he left
[47:59] everything there and you keep working
[48:01] and you keep working and you keep
[48:03] working and we keep working you gain
[48:05] under training because he want you to
[48:08] not not to rely on your job because you
[48:11] can get fire if you get fire you will
[48:13] cry like an unbeliever I don't want you
[48:16] to rely on your job go to work but know
[48:18] that I am the one who
[48:21] provid amen go to work but just know
[48:23] that I am the one who can provide I want
[48:26] you to believe more than work I want you
[48:28] to have higher ambition I want you to
[48:31] open up your spiritual mind so you can
[48:35] see pass your potential pass your work
[48:39] pass your country pass what the
[48:41] government is promising you because all
[48:44] of them can
[48:46] fail but I will not fail you I will be
[48:50] with you to the end until I take you to
[48:53] the Rapture that's what I'm training you
[48:55] for
[48:56] because if they seize this churches if
[48:59] the the pressure of The ecumenical
[49:01] council begin to pressure us we don't
[49:04] worry about it anymore because the third
[49:07] pool is there the third pool is loaded
[49:10] to prepare you to produce whatever you
[49:15] need
[49:19] hallu Lord it is just the beginning my
[49:23] friend let's stop here and will get
[49:26] there let's
[49:28] [Applause]
[49:37] stand you need to understand why is this
[49:40] third po coming in this time it's not
[49:43] coming so that we can play with the
[49:45] power of
[49:46] creation and begin to make a show I can
[49:50] make a squirrel I can make a donkey I
[49:52] can make that's not there God don't give
[49:55] power for
[49:56] foolishness amen God is training you so
[50:00] that when he put you in a situation
[50:03] there is no bread when Moses told Israel
[50:06] tomorrow you're going to have bread
[50:08] maybe Israel was thinking about the
[50:10] natural bread that they got but God was
[50:13] showing them that I can create I'm
[50:16] bringing you back to the origin that I
[50:19] am a God that creates and in order to
[50:22] bring you there I'm going to start by a
[50:25] hunger
[50:26] I'm going to crank in hunger of you and
[50:28] that hunger is a Divine hunger he have a
[50:31] Divine Purpose it's a hunger to bring
[50:33] you back to the
[50:37] word not the
[50:41] word that we speaking of by the word
[50:44] that can create because everything was
[50:47] created by that
