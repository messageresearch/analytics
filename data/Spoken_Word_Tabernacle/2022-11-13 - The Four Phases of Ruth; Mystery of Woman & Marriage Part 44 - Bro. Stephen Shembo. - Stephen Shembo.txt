there and who's not there we greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen how many are up to date with the sermon okay praise God Amen we got your church in this book there and the 70 weeks of Daniel if you order or you left uh you lift up your hand make sure you get it up there you might see the trustee and again if somebody's looking for it not part of this Fellowship see the trust it first before you take it and go give to the person amen our house meeting is again on November 19th if you got your question you go ahead and put it in especially what we have been coming over about the position that we are in this church as far as the message of the hour if you got any question you didn't get it pretty good go ahead and put it there so we make sure everybody is on the same page amen we don't want anybody behind or anybody who's confused we want you to know exactly what we're dealing with when we're talking about the token you got to know the token amen we need to be different than denomination amen we are not denominations I don't know where the other young people are but hopefully I don't know what keep them out of the church but it should be here in the church amen the devil is doing everything he can to distract the young people amen don't put yourself into more responsibility that you have yet do you understand what I'm saying in other words don't get into college and begin to be part of this club and this club and this club and this club before you know it you have a lot of responsibility and you won't be able to make it to church that's why I was in university and I could be a deacon because I shine away from every group all the Alpha Kappa fed or whatever you call it I didn't get into it amen and the Lord helped me to finish one year ahead of everybody everybody okay so don't engage yourself into a lot of stuff I appreciate helping the people I appreciate helping the mother but young people don't put yourself into responsibility of children that will keep you outside of the church in other words you engage yourself picking up a baby or something and because of the baby you're not sitting in the sanctuary um you have a different Pastor Dave I'm not going to play games amen you can do it you can help but be careful the devil will give you that responsibility I'm not saying God you yourself with the Devil find yourself into that responsibility and you will be outside the church in the pretense of taking care of a child and you will be missing the whole service when that is not your primary responsibility stay in the sanctuary yes did you hear me all of them are not here hopefully they will listen to what I'm saying don't sit in the back they come to the front you don't say Amen Brother David can you give me some bullets so I don't have to worry about them just give me more money amen the young people don't sit on the back there brother Kelly you got that right brother Robert you got it right so if brother Kelly sends you to the front don't get mad don't sit on the battery okay you are free now do the best that you can and soak as much worried as you can before you have five or six children and you don't have time to even read your Bible it is not me it is the Drone that I dispatched and they are just pulling information and I get information from them and once I get information everything is zeroed in then I struck straight because I know what I'm shooting for amen so young people don't put yourself into a lot of responsibilities when you come to church focus on the word leave the babies alone wait after church go get the babies wait when we have Fellowship go get the babies but don't put yourself busy in pretense to run away from the service see how you can get ambushed because this Holy Ghost is not playing games you will love me one day I can't let's say about people fussing at me or showing faces it doesn't change me I will continue to preach because I know where I'm standing everybody okay we thank you all for your prayer for my grandmother she went on to be with the Lord my mom is here this morning that is the correct way to celebrate instead of staying home she wanted she she's part of us here this morning so you continue to pray you know it's willing tomorrow she will travel going into the country everything is well she passed away a 94 years old so there is two ways you can look at it's a separation it hurt but either you can be ungrateful or you can thank God for 94 years old which is more than 80 and for the major thing that she has accomplished that's what we want to thank God Amen Amen on the week of Thanksgiving our midweek service he's not going to be on Wednesday it's going to be on Tuesday so Brother David if you can help us when we're getting closer just to send a text to Iman the people amen so that give the mother a little bit more time to prepare everything and be ready for Thanksgiving everybody okay how many received the communication on WhatsApp how many read it if you didn't read it you need to go read it because you don't want me to come to you personally everybody okay I already explained you in detail for this church what you need to know I gave you the sermon I put the link back if you're struggling go ahead and listen to it so don't tell me you didn't listen to it because that's not you didn't read the message because that's not my responsibility my responsibility is to grieve you the word to make sure every Court everything is available to you it is your responsibility to open it and to read it slowly and prayerfully so you can catch what we're trying to say Amen so if you continue to do what you're doing because you didn't read it that's your problem I will come straight to you hey everybody okay everybody okay glory to God I believe we got it amen if you give me a phone call or a text I have not responded yet just be patient I got folks internationally but I got folks local first amen but we appreciate those that are internationally I receive message people in South Africa in South America in the Indian God richly bless you and we trust what is going on here it's a blessing to you amen glory be to God glory to God did I forgot anything about Robert you pray for brother Tim Michelle remember him in prayer that's what they give me and Lord's willing he will go through surgery tomorrow morning if I'm not mistaken so make sure you keep him in prayer so everything goes well and he can have a quick recovery brother Jim is sticking around just to make sure that he stays with him a little bit before he can move around amen so we remember our brother he's an elder stood two for a truth of this message and we want the Lord to heal him and God heals also by medicine amen that Deacon would like to meet the young sister that will be taking care of the oncoming house meeting they just want to talk to you kind of brief you up on what you need that's it sisters and brother so they just want to tell you what you need to know what you need to bring where this stuff are just to kind of prepare you so you don't get that nervous amen glory to God how many remember this picture again do you know what it means right how many knows what do you mean so some of you don't know yet okay you need to review the sermon amen it's the picture of who almighty God the picture of who that's the reason why we keep it in church amen so this picture is not about brother brother because brother Branham has a lot of picture amen but there is something special about this picture it is the pillar of fire amen so this picture is the picture of crust so when they ask you why do you keep this picture in the church [Applause] you know why don't be afraid and don't be ashamed everybody okay do not be ashamed of this picture amen you ashamed you don't know how can you have a husband and you are ashamed of his picture [Applause] amen amen this is my phone I keep it here as my timer what is the picture on my phone the picture of who am I ashamed of my wife everybody okay God what about this picture here [Applause] it is the picture of who you know when we talk about this picture we took the prophecy of Paul where Paul said to you who are trouble you rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be watered for your microphone I can tell praise God who took the microphone away from him amen the Bible said to you who are trouble rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be what revealed reveal from heaven with water Mighty Angels it is not the coming of the Lord amen it is the revealing of the Lord in heaven why in heaven everybody okay brother Branham said we found that Jesus was fixing to do something great on a great occasion was fixing and on a great occasion was fixing to happen and when God gets ready to do things great everybody okay the first thing God usually does is making known in the water Heavens in the heaven water above first brother his microphone is not on I need to preach with him amen he said he make a known in the heavens above first he always declare his work in the water Heaven before he does it on the water Earth that day they took picture all across Southern United States and Mexico there he hangs now in the Life Magazine still a water mystery to them but he declared in the heaven before he does it on the water Earth he always does that she shows his son in the heaven first so God before he opened the seals everybody okay on the Earth he has to declare the seventh seal on the heaven first everybody okay the Bible says that he did it in flaming fire taking Vengeance on them that know not God and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ if you look at that word flaming fire the angels will come in a flaming fire in Hebrew one this is your boss who gave me this the Bible say and of the Angels say he who maketh his Angel Waters Kama and his Minister water flame of fire yes sir everybody here so what you see there are angels are ministering spirit in flaming fire your boss is telling me something and I need to talk to you the pillar of Fire when he was sin by day how was it by day the pillar of fire appear as a water cloud and by night it appear as water now when they took this picture was that in daytime or night time so if it's on daytime you need to appear as a water Cloud [Applause] your boss just gave it to me right now everybody okay so if future trouble that the Bible say a flaming of fire a flaming of fire is the appearing of night because it's allowed this year it is darkest of everything but the picture has to be taken on the day so the pillar of fire in the day will appear as a cloud [Applause] I hope it's stabilizing somebody everybody okay brother Branham say in his hand he held Seven Stars and you shall see in a few minutes I want to get to it let the Bible just speak what he was he was the water seven Mysteries where did Brother Branham get the word ministers because the angels are spirit and they are water and they appear as water flame of fire he says seven ministers one minister to each age of these seven churches coming out holding them in his water right hand amen there he is there was the waters seven angels seven messenger one to each Water Church what are you trying to say brother Branham says this he said just exactly that he showed us the seven Church ages what would come just exactly what he showed us what will come when he set the water why this brother but I'm calling this light because it is by the day he said why did he set that light up there in the water not the coming everybody okay that light is in the Revelation nothing is coming Amen in the revelation of it to it it shows his show to the world when he sent the water seven angels to do water the water that had been done through there and showed the water is there a problem He said Each angel coming well and revealing the loose and the who left Luther and who left and who left it's all represented in and in the very top and Shadow of the Great Water Jehovah who say exactly he throw it in the sky and there it is the mechanical eye taking a picture of water thank the Lord if that light came what does he mean it means shalom peace don't be water why because water Jesus is here his great life has come to water us and we are faithful for it his water the water great mystery he is here he is today manifesting himself doing the same as he did just water doing the very water same thing Jesus Christ [Applause] glory to God Amen amen but the Bible says next to this 3 verse 2 that the angel of the Lord appear unto him in the water flame of fire [Music] I'm just refocusing and pushing more screws down [Music] the Bible said in Matthew 7 verse 30 that and when 40 years were expired there appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount sana a Manger of the Lord in the water flame of fire Revelation 1 14 his head and his head remember brother Branham said look at he said look at his nose his head and his hair were white like water whoa look at that picture amen and why does water snow what do you see there in other word whatever happened in this message is perfectly in line with the scriptures our picture are scripture our vision our scripture Our experience our scripture Our message is scripture this message can never be separated from the Bible this message and the Bible are one [Applause] [Music] he said his head and his hair were white like water as white as what snow and his eyes were as water flame of fire foreign he said how many of you take the tip you heard of what time is it sir did we show those magazines and things did we show those magazines and things a year before the water happened it's on tape science is stumped on me they were there was the who Lord Jesus how crowd and with that water as you see in the water Bible in Revelation and in water Daniel say that people act like what brother Branham is bringing is something different than the Bible amen he says and Daniel the Supreme water of heaven and earth right there when science can't even see it themselves because it's not for them and in the observatory out there in the University of Arizona and down through Mexico they are water I have been there for the last water and there he will start you and he was going to water happen before it even happened so this picture here belongs to who God out you ashamed of this picture what about this one [Applause] I am removing all the spooky stuff that they put around you in the message where you are even afraid and ashamed of the message like you are talking about some spooky stuff this is not Halloween [Applause] [Music] you're not afraid of Halloween but you are afraid of this one [Applause] people are worshiping the devil in the name of Halloween and they are bold enough to put it and express it to the world let me Express what I believe [Applause] in this picture I believe in this picture I believe in this picture and I believe in this picture [Music] I am not ashamed of this picture I identify with those pictures [Applause] we play too much games [Applause] I don't have time for hypocrite tell me whether you believe this message or not this picture belongs to who the first picture brother Branham say I was only standing there the second picture brother Branham said I was only standing there he's giving glory to who God what is the problem no problem I want you to remember what God to remember who God did he say remember me so when you see this picture you have to remember who God when you see this picture you have to remember who God when you see this picture you have to remember when you see this picture you have to remember God people are acting like we're caught it he said I want you to remember God still exists in the same water colors from the water line of upward water to the fire and water start with a movie camera oh with a color camera Amber from the launch app from the launch down all around many colors like in the rainbow in the sky after water all right who is that person Jesus Christ the same water yesterday today at work forever his microphone is not on check it again my brother say something amen praise God I need him with some volume so whoever doesn't want to say Amen I'm fine he said Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the Holy Spirit still in his water power still in his Water Church in this water last day there you are not water [Applause] do you does he ring the bell the first picture brother say is Nami the second picture I was only standing there I am only near when he says something I am only the one he's using his voices everybody Hallelujah and you come and tell people let's go back to Christ removing the pictures these are message preachers that are still claiming to believe this message they are removing the picture slowly ah let me continue he said not me I was just water standing there almost every time brother Branham say it is not me I was just standing there he said I was just standing there but he was a water picture that was water shaken he only appeared to be in the picture I want you to look at that just wonder exactly what who takes the picture back to the Bible back to the Bible back to the Bible back to the Bible show me one picture that he didn't throw you to the Bible seeing a pillar of fire is in you Act is it new to you no Moses had the pillar of Fire Daniel had the pillar of fire Paul had the feeling of fire is that new why are you scared [Applause] so if you were following Moses you will run away from the pillar of fire to please your friend [Applause] when that was the very God of Israel if you now they take you to a wedding and see all of you videos think about if we were in the time of Moses with the technology that we have here how many picture of the pillar of fire would we have a lot God gives you a privilege when you were not born to get even one and you are ashamed of it because you want to look cool shame on you he said I want you to look just exactly what Ezekiel Saw same color the same way and not the water and flush the water same way as the Living Water what is it the living creatures represented the water The Living Church the church that is living by the power and the resurrection of who Christ damn same amber color has covered from the Lord's upward from the launch water downwards what are you trying to say mm-hmm maybe the stranger here never seen it they caught water another one another one he said I got it way at

selling on water quiet and calm water see they make the president where do you go to sleep where did the Pharaohs saw the vision where did King Nebuchadnezzar saw the vision because we got too conscious make something different [Music] we got the first conscience and the second conscience or the subconscious we already went through this the first conscience is when you awake just like you awake right now but when you go to sleep your first conscience go to sleep it's the second one that kick in that's the man that is looking at your dream that is where your soul is working because you will see yourself in the dream talking but you're not talking you're sleeping you will see yourself in the dream running around you might even see yourself in a dream fighting and sometimes the one who's sleeping next to you must see you like because you fighting am I saying something new you realize yourself right you find yourself right brother Branham say in other words this picture was in the place where the subconscious kicking [Applause] it's a place where the soul have a tendency to open up watch what you do in your bedroom that's why you can't get a demon out quickly yes yes okay he said and he's so impressed the boys as they went to bed at what so before they go to bed you follow me those boy fix their eyes on the picture and they captured the picture and when they are going to sleep are you following me the first conscious take the picture and pass it to the second country you following me it's a mystery and the second conscience take it and try to soak it in the soul are you following me did I lost anybody if I lost you raise your hand man has a brain and they have a heart the brand is where your first conscience work we went through this before even in the old church the heart is when your second conscience goes everybody okay everybody okay so when you wake up you are like here that's why you reason too much everybody okay but when you go to sleep this brain here need to rest your you goes to sleep and now that you wake up everybody okay this is the man that even if you sleeping when there is a noise you can turn around and shut your telephone and you go to sleep and when you wake up you don't remember doing that the one who did that telephone and turned the alarm off this is the guy right here but when you wake up and I tell you that you walk up here and you turn the alarm off you say no no no no I didn't do that I was sleeping it was not you he was your second you everybody okay everybody okay you're not saying yeah man I'll go back to the scripture everybody okay amen everybody okay amen so what happened is those boys when they were awake and they were going to their bedroom trying to sleep they always have an image [Music] you follow me that image is captured by the first conscience anybody okay then as you going to sleep the two conscience are changing shift I'm saying that so you under this message that's why the message have a different language [Applause] [Music] you won't get this in denomination everybody okay so this conscience can't shift that's what when you stop in your bedroom young people watching pornography look what you picking up and what you sucking in your soul that's why that demon don't go [Music] you will remember me one day everybody okay so when these two conscience changes shift the boy the picture of the Marine yeah move from here and enter there anybody okay and this guy here is nobody else but your soul everybody okay this guy here is nobody else but your spirit everybody okay everybody okay amen so when you get that picture and you suck in the soul once the sword get it it is beyond your control the soul will become will do everything to become what you are telling him to become so when the boy got that picture over and over do you remember Jesus telling a parable that if you of a judge that refused to give Jesus said keep doing water keep doing what until the judge will do what so when the sponge goes to sleep then look the picture knock the picture knock the picture not for years everybody okay that picture knock knock knock knock until one time unconsciously they're so and swallow the picture you won't change those boys you can show them I.T you can show them Dentistry you can show them anything their soul is looking for Army and a specific Army Marine he said it's so impressed the boys as they went to water at night looking at this water picture don't read Brother Brad I'm like a newspaper he said he was on the water mind to sell that water quite soothing sea and in the morning when the water arose the first thing they could look at was water the so they refreshed that back again they're going to sleep with it they wake up with it they're going to sleep with it they wake up with it you're going to sleep with your telephone on Instagram you wake up in the morning with your telephone on Instagram you wake up you go to sleep with your

way through the water anything pressed the boy so that each one of them become a what a sailor brother Prana if the picture of a ship [Applause] will impress boys to become water and water sailors what up mama Daddy mama Daddy in this church young people all over the message what out the picture of who Lord Jesus Christ do always have the water right thing before you watch it children bring up a child in the way that he should work go bring it up and do water it shall certainly won't depart from water yes [Music] what are your children watching [Applause] hit Coco mellow look at the boys

technology learn it quicker than you and you become slave of Internet slave of Instagram slave of WhatsApp slave for Facebook you will remember me one day that's why I keep also my picture here and I will keep this picture here and I will keep that picture here so whenever you come in this church when you get here the first thing you see before you leave this is what you see even if you are sleeping when you wake up when you wake up when you wake up Christ let's stand Genesis chapter 5. I will move on with my subject as much as I can but these are very important stuff that I cannot play game with it and I know what the devil is doing yes when I was single I never want to sit in the back I was always on the front the one who took me away from the front is when I got married then I moved back to begin to sit with my wife on the behind so I don't know what's wrong with a young man if you're not in a technical stuff or you're not working in a camera what are you doing in the back we will come in church getting the church sit down we won't move even to the bathroom until the church is done young boy five times what did you eat and you eat that every Sunday amen five times glory to God stop those kind of stuff you're going to regret one time anything you can over there over there trying to talk trying to do something you're wasting your time and then before you know it I'm receiving the question and I look I say I already covered this one I already covered this one where were you when I was preaching it this is not a church anity around the message where we come in fellowship and we can't wait quickly to be outside and to be talking everybody that was sleeping is wide awake on the parking lot that's not what we're here for sure you can do that at home I will have bushy on Wednesday because some run on Sunday and then they will come on Wednesday because they know our brother Stevens you don't know what I'm doing let's go to Genesis chapter 5. I will never play game and I'll tell you the truth I don't want your blood in my head you hit me fine [Applause] I will still pray for you Genesis 5 verse 1. this is the book of the generation of who Adam in the day that God created man in his water likeness of God made he him men he didn't make a woman I want you to get this correctly man and male and female you know that verse two you might be seated this man is male and he's female God help us created he death and God did what you okay God blessed them the blessing that God gives was not only to the man do you understand what I'm saying that's why you hear sisters in the message they don't want to read the message they think the message is for men everybody okay God didn't bless him the Bible said God bless them so the blessing is for everybody [Applause] what can the blessing was that what did God bless them with and that blessing was equal amen what kind of blessing was that in other words at this stage is can do everything that Adam can do yeah I'm breaking your theology everybody okay he said male and female created he them and he did water bless them and did what you call their name and call them water so not only did he bless them he gave both of them one name amen so the name of this man is Adam and the name of this woman is Adam you will understand now from today on why how do we have this message amen we already started last week Amen in the day when they were what created let's go to roof chapter 3. glory to God if you dare you can say Amen yes verse 3 uh verse one then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her my daughter shall I not seek rest for you that he may be well with you and now he's not boas of our kindred with whose Maiden you wear it's now a past she's no longer with the lady she was with the medicine amen behold he Boaz not the reaper we know it's barley tonight in the threshing floor the one who's working tonight is not the maiden it is not roof it is not the reaper it is Boaz alone and roof have to go alone to meet Boaz alone no more a public show everybody okay jump to verse 8. the Bible says and he came to pass at what time midnight you understand this now that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who are you and she answered I am Rufio what he's calling herself a handmaid pray Therefore your skirt over your handmade for you are a near water verse 10 and he said Blessed Be You of the Lord my daughter this one is saying boss this one is saying God but the boss and the door they are gonna change everybody okay for you have showed more kindness in this ladder end than at the beginning in as much as you follow not water whether poor or water so the kindness here Boaz is speaking is not about bringing food to Naomi the kindness here is a bad roof not being attracted to the other young boys in other words there was still a protection for roof to fall are you understanding amen boys was still concerned about roof being deceived by a young man so proof under the repair roof in the field of Boaz under the reaper which are the Angels roof under the angel was still susceptible to fall yes amen even though boy has already blocked her there but boys were still afraid of one thing is she gonna be interested to the young man let's go to Ephesian five and then we fly quickly if you dare you can say Amen Ephesians 5 23. because of what your boss gave me last night after 2 A.M or something I need to go to verse 21. amen yes Hallelujah let me see what is where is this here okay I've seen it job to verse 22. amen amen wives do what among everything else that God can talk to the woman he just tell her submit yourself and that's it when it comes to marriage he say wife submit yourself that's all why amen for the wife God is asking one thing to be submissive why I hope you stay awake it's gonna help you it's going to help the Daddy it's going to help Mama it's gonna help your future I wished everybody was sitting here this morning but I'm doing what I'm doing irresponsible wife submit yourself to your husband not to man all right did you hear me he didn't say to the woman to be subnative to me no no to the husband it's one man submitting to one husband your own husband so you don't go tell somebody else's wife what to do everybody okay us to the water when you submitting yourself to the house to the husband you do it like you are doing it to the Lord why because the man that you are hooked with have imperfection do you follow me you are doing that not because of him you need to do that in your backpack you are looking at Christ why do you have to do that God give me time to help you up you do it as unto the water amen if you doing something to the Lord you know how you're doing it there is a different way if you're doing something to please me or if you're doing something to please the Lord if you're doing it to please the lord it's another level it's another love foreign [Music] [Music] because that's where the marriage cannot broken cannot break I'm gonna help you out [Music] amen Lord help me verse 23 for the husband is the water the head of the wife does he have volume or we need to change microphone you can turn that one off here brother thank you see for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the water now Paul is moving with two at the beginning it was not your husband a natural wife now he's taking two couples a natural couple and a spiritual couple and not your couple you have husband and wife and a spiritual couple you have who Christ and he's what church and the church that sounds better that's it amen he says and he is the savior of the body so this church Paul is calling that the body because Christ Paul call him what the head amen so if Christ is not in your life you don't have the head yet let's continue verse 24 therefore as the church is water subject if you notice the church is under submission do you follow me yes oh God the church also God is asking the church to be submissive I hope I can struck that demon today amen therefore as the church is subject to who Christ not to another body not to another person you gotta know who Christ is [Applause] everybody okay so let their wife be to the water husbands that's not what the scripture says to the water don't try to please somebody else's husband your own husband why your own so let's continue your own husband in water everything [Music] we will continue now to your husband verse 25 husband love thy wife you see God saying husband submit yourself no why to the husband God say lost to the husband to the husband God is asking love that's it why what is going on in the husband that he must love the wife and what is going on in the husband that she must submit herself to the husband what does love your wife means what does submit yourself me all right husband love your wife even ask how Christ love is water the church and gave himself for water for it so a husband must give himself for his wife in other words daddy must go to work you don't understand me that's why Paul said a man who does not provide for his family is worse than an evident because now we begin to share amen and sometimes 75 percent of the Lord he said the woman and the man is only 25 and he's fine it's a [Applause] well don't worry I'm fine everybody okay verse 26 that he must sanctify and cleanse it with the word worship of the Water by the water that he crossed my presented to himself so he's the one working to present it to himself a water glorious Church helping water no not having spot not spot or water wrinkles or any such thing but that it should be holy and without what without bleming so the bride must be holy God holy and the bride must be without blemish you gonna see what see what amen verse 28 so ought to out men to love their wives as their own water bodies he that loveth his life love is what himself for no man ever hated his own flesh but he does what nourishes so you gotta feed your wife and daughter so you gotta care for your wife even as the Lord to the church for we are members of his what body of his what of his what bow watch Paul what is saying Paul is saying that we are we us we are what members we are members members of what nobody in his body and he's using what kind of word for the body flesh flesh and Water World so Flesh and Bones means the definition amen for this cause Shaman shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife and the two shall be watered one flesh so when the woman is coming she's bringing submission when man is coming man is bringing love if you get those two equations together you are hooked come on jump to verse uh 32 this is a great what mystery but I speak concerning who Christ and the water the church so this thing that Paul is explaining here that white submission and husband love and then cherish all of that Paul say it's a great mystery you who don't love mystery what is going on in that mission what is great about that mystery let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father thanking you once again for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father I have done what acts like what I can do as a human being that you have given ability but now when it comes to interpret your word it takes only the supernatural power of the Holy Spirit Lord may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to your children be the Alpha and the Omega of this service in Jesus precious name amen amen my subject this morning is the four phases of Ruth the mystery of women and marriage we already talked about the mystery of men today it is the mystery of a woman the mystery of a woman with marriage we are in the trashing floor and we are also dealing with the second all in our Tabernacle reading we are in the holiest and this is where we were we found out that roof moved completely from the Reaper or the angel all the way to the trashing floor where Boaz was the only one working everybody okay and I'm gonna quickly remind you that under the return everybody that was working over there in that picture were women so it was rough with the maiden that were all working and this is the work of a female all the work of the women or the working of the female or the women's spirit everybody okay but when you come to the tragic floor the maiden are no longer there in the trenching floor it's about roof and Boaz but at this time even though roof carried the female spirit spirit everybody okay but they're working now was a working of a man it was a male that was working but it was no longer a woman working the woman was resting but the man Spirit was the one working so there is a time where a woman work are you following me and there was a damn that it's not the female Spirit working it is now the Mad spirit that are doing that is doing the work amen everybody okay so far in the parable of the of the Dead version we found out that when the Midnight Cry came all the Virgin arrows amen and there after the Midnight Cry that's when the second oil was opened everybody okay the second one made the other foolish virgin realize what they did not have everybody okay are you following me the second all Not only was there a no did that bring you to the bathroom after the midnight to the second Journey for you to go further in the ministry but it is annoying that make the foolish woman relax their emptiness everybody okay and when they Relax The Emptiness they themselves went out hmm the Bible said in verse 10 that why they went to the water so nobody chased them away [Music] everybody okay the lack of the second oil made them go out [Applause] everybody okay they left on their own and they left with their intention to find the second oil somewhere else everybody okay and what they found out was the oil of tribulation [Music] because when they came back they knocked at the door they say Lord Lord open to us the Lord said I cannot open and they were left outside where they were gnashing of teeth and they were wearing in other words they received an anointing for the tribulation period everybody okay so you will see people leaving the message trying to find something that they are longing for outside the message and what else shall be they gonna find out if they are getting under the anointing of the tribulation says this he said they were back in the churches there was some of them in there there was good people but there was not in the Star Wars right they were not under the light of the star of the edge [Music] amen that's why you need to know what token are you giving to the people everybody okay brother Branham said what I mean with the weak deep into the water so there was some connection that was cut off the week was no longer in the oil which oil brother Branham says see he was out he was walking gone out and they had done water separated themselves Paul said in his day they separate themselves from us seemingly not having the what face and went away from them they went out from us because there was not of what us now it started back in the early efficient age and comes on down into this Edge today something every one of those age what happened in them lap over into this water now notice that this virgin though she went into where there was what sleeping and wearing and water gushing of teeth everybody okay so far open with me in uh first John chapter 2. his microphone is not active first John chapter 2. if you dare you can say Amen verse 18. let's look at that scripture if you dare you can say Amen thank you Sterling first John chapter 2 verse 18. if you dare you can say Amen we are good on time just when you get some good stuff barely fill up quickly you there you're getting the rolls quickly little children it is the last time and as you have heard that Antichrist shall come and even water yeah you okay brother you got it even water now are there many antichrists whereby we know that it is the what remember this is John right watch careful then went out from us but they were not of us so somebody have to separate everybody okay and when they're separating there is a meaning spiritual for if uh the Bible say for if they had been of us they would not have to have water continue with water so to show that you're really part of it you need to continue all the way if at the middle of the road you jump off it shows that you were not part of it [Music] am I reading a different Bible the Bible continue but they went out that they might be made what manifest imagine what they might be made known so you can know them they might be made known that they were not all of what in other words there is a group of people everybody claimed to be message believer [Music] but the time has come that some people must go out don't worry about it they must go out whether you like it or not they must go out and they're going out is showing you that they were not part of what you thought they were before you thought they were message believer but they were not message believing because Paul said they didn't have faith they didn't have the weapon as you know what they were with they were just part of the group but not part of the first amen being part of the message church is not good you must be part of the fact of the message then you know that you're a message believe [Applause] Amen brother let's continue verse 20. who have stayed you have the water an unction do you know what that means you have an anointed everybody okay those that left they also had an anointing among you yeah there are many preachers that are leaving this message and they preach this message on fire and the anointing was there but they reached two different anointings there is two oil amen the first oil make you work but it will stop at a certain time you need that second order that will take you all the way to the rapture the Bible says that by you have an option from the water Holy Ghost did you see that brother the Holy One and you know water all things oh [Music] is that the word it's the option of the fullness [Applause] amen everybody okay another one it's an option that is complete so there is a posture option oh and the fullness function that would not that make you know all the Mysteries everything must be unveiled yes sir what are you trying to say this is why brother Branham saying we like this I'm looking for a time of a breakfast of the water spirit of God in the last day that we are now living in for another word search of the water Holy Spirit defenses ain't nobody will care another one said just the water Holy Spirit the church for water the rapturing phase must bring you rapturing safe because the second oil was the oil that took the White Version all the way to the hospital it is the oil of rapturing pet it is that all of the groom it is the oil of the coming of the Lord it's an anointing that way you have it you cannot miss the bathroom [Music] everybody okay if it's bringing rupturing Faith let's look and Lord be at this brother Branham saying just before he comes and everything is sitting water straight in order for that and I believe that we are now at the time that the world should have water perfect yes keep that word I believe that the time to lay aside our water green our water and go back to the white world why nice well the problem says this then there is coming forth seven mysterious Thunders that is not even written what at all because when John wanted to write the angel say what for the messages perfectly in line with the scripture he said that's right and I believe that through those seven pandas will be revealed in the last day in order to get the bread together for what rapturing faith if the second search of the Holy Spirit bring rapturing Faith and the Seven Thunders bring rapturing fish I'm reading to you the prophet so the second to the seven candles is what the Revelation contained in the second so what breaks the seals is which anointing second oil everybody okay you see what people are rejecting the seals you see what they're rejecting the very thing that's gonna produce Rapture repair to bring you into the presence of God and you say you don't need to know themselves they are message preacher preparing the people you're gonna be disappointed [Applause] everybody okay brother Brandon said because wow what do we got what right now would not be able to do it what they got rather was not wrong it was the first story that was not enough to do the job [Music] and Pentecostal anointing is not enough to take you to the rapture hurry up I know what troubles you but give me time brother Branham says this there is something we got to go away step further and step water farther [Music] we we can't have enough safe for water healing hardly we got to have enough Faith to be what to change in the water Moment In The Sweep of the water do you think changing is a game no it's not any anointing that does that everybody okay when Abraham met Elohim his molecule changed Abraham became young again and Sarah became young again but Abraham made God many times before but he never changing only when God was made flesh amen foreign [Applause] God meant Abraham six times before Genesis 18 and Abraham never changed when he has a chance a discernment yes [Applause] Church [Applause] everybody okay why didn't Abraham change when God pulled him up why he didn't check because he still had the same problem he didn't have a baby God never changes God spoke to him God visited him God told him about the circumcision all of those things never change about until God came down [Applause] inhuman flesh the son of man and produce the Messiah the Sarah was checked and her bareness was taken out to produce the baby that she always runs for to produce the promises and to produce Jesus Christ you need that different Ministry [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the message everybody okay let's go to Genesis one Lord help me you don't need the seals you don't need the seals meaning you don't even know what the seals mean and we understand your ignorance but don't be bold in the error let's be humble call a brother you say brother help me understand this but instead of doing that we're blocking one another amen because we're afraid the ship will run away from the church but God opened streaming amen amen wherever they are they can tune in and they will blast foreign [Applause] you won't block them anymore God is tired [Music] verse 26 if you dare you can say amen amen we found out that when God verse 26 and God said let us let us so that God Is Us everybody okay I won't please denomination because I'm not preaching to the moment I'm preaching to a pure message so I am and that message church is also the church I am Pastor so I'm totally free [Music] everybody okay so we got somebody here who's called God but that God is plural Is Us how is he son are we okay he said let us make man in our image and our water likeness and let them then this man them we're gonna make this man we're not already this managed man and it's female that's why they call them and let the them have water so Dominion is given to who yeah you don't want to get it that's your problem keep keep cooking everybody okay Dominion offers the water a woman that creepeth upon the Water Earth so a man and a woman are giving Dominion to adversy so God created who man in his own water image in the image of God created he watered him and what Man created he what and God did what God said to them be what fruitful not to one person eat them be fruitful and do what multiply and do what replenish the Earth subdue and have water Dominion which we already went through so if this man here is male and female and he's created in the image and in the likeness of God so this God here is also man and female this God Ismail and he's also female right I'm letting your reasoning reason so you mean we got a female Holocaust I know how your mind works and the man holy ghost are no higher man everybody okay to refresh you we found out that the tree of life was done brother random said now the bride are one tree life in other words like what husband one Christ and his brother what one same thing same Spirit same what works everything what everything else get stuff like that okay brother Branham says this he said he brings forth a broad tree which will be there Tree of Life restore water back to him so he is the Tree of Life the bride is the tree of life so when you take the bride back to God you're taking the tree of life back to the Tree of Life [Applause] you remember that wisdom you remember that wisdom that was creating she was a female yeah right as husband and wife in the Garden of Eden Oh Glory to God by the same water world and the same water God made manifest in husband and what why the same broad tree back again let me say it again this man in Genesis was not in Genesis 2. this man in Genesis 1 verse 26 to 27 or 28 this man is male and female and this female here is not a byproduct no no stop the female spirit is a reaching and the male spirit is so reaching and both of them are all reaching us what are you trying to say that's why it's good to go to sleep on Saturday on time so you don't struggle in church and if you shall notice how that is was United with who Adam she became what a part of him God did you notice in Genesis 1 27 he created man water male and female created him now the man was buff water male and female when it comes to being in the spirit of water and water masculine that God took from his sad area to the old patriarch did you notice the body part was the one by products spirit [Applause] why they don't read this book the scratch was there all along why I said believe I don't read that question let's be specific you're not searching you're gonna cut the nerves because you butchering people you need to learn the anatomy to know how you're using the blade [Music] the blood is not for you to carry everybody okay the body part of the woman was the Water by product I said the creation has been what finished again God took from the side of Adam away and made the water woman so in the beginning Linda Spirit form Madness male and female period both of them exactly the same and they had the same age [Applause] God never created man and the woman in another day no both of them they were twists damage salmon Sam blessing Sam Dominion [Applause] [Applause] everybody okay now in Genesis 2 7. everybody okay God make again man anybody okay whenever he makes men here he made man man when he appeared we were expecting this man to be doubled you okay but when men appear Man became single that's why the Bible said he was alone everybody okay so when this man came out you look you say God what did you do what is going on when we look at his blueprint he's too when we look over there into the body we see him one we need to see the second part You Follow Me Maybe people look they say God go ahead and create God came and he said it is not good that Adam must be what so technically speaking we expecting God to go ahead again and begin to work then God begin to show something yes yes he said you don't understand the man of Genesis 2 7. is also a double man do you follow me his body is double you following me that's why men naturally I say this and I'm repeating this man naturally have X and Y biologically speaking hey everybody okay so God was forced to go into man not another flesh do you follow me do you follow me and pull the X out of the man and when acts came out of a man he became what they call a woman he's shot which have on the X and X everybody okay brother Branham says this he said but not the spirit the spirit was what called Adam so the spirit of Eve was Adam period I have to go slowly the spirit of Eve was Adam but he was Adam in the family profession [Applause] you are grown up to start eating mature food everybody okay everybody okay this Spirit here God gives them a name the name of this man was what Adam so this Spirit the name is who Adam the spirit is who Adam so the spirit of this woman was Adam yes right now I don't in a female spirit everybody here everybody care everybody care amen this is Adam in the water in a male spirit follow me carefully you ready are you ready hey yes check somebody's hand tell him listen please I can see your eyes and everything you okay you ready are you ready listen to me you ready you ready this Spirit here that is called the male spirit everybody okay he can express two ways everybody okay this Spirit can be mad and can also be a female Everybody follow you but this Spirit here is limited to express only the feminine part of the feminine version of Adam when you ask this female produce the male she's Limited are you following me the male spirit God damn the fullness you following me and the female Spirit come down the park do you follow me the female spirit is only female by the male spirit is female and male [Applause] everybody okay their mouth Spirit when we sinfulness we meet that it's a spirit that is perfect it is a spirit that is complete Complete because he had both men and female [Applause] do you follow me by the female spirit is only a part don't worry my friend you're not gonna get lost what are you trying to say brother Branham say for he both men and women spiritually speaking was buff one masculine and water feminist what are you trying to say brother Stephen Lord help me and Adam was lonesome and God to show that he could not be separated you follow me I'm going to get back into the same thing just a second look he never went and got dirt and made it easy and that was who Eve she was made for what the man and part of the water man she was part of him in the water beginning in the water Creation in the water theophany she was part of him down here in this creation she could not be divided into another creation she had to be made in the same creation that is exactly why Christ and God had to be the very sad person if he could it could not be any different anything different he had to be a good man or a prophet he would not have been a redeemer if he had been a good man he had to be the Creator himself but he's still the water theophany now you see the way he was then what are you trying to say brother Stephen the Bible said God is the wife of spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in what spirited and Truth how many spirit is God today one here Isaiah they love your goddess Bible what spirit how can we have a female and a male spirit let's go to Genesis 2. Lord help me you there you there amen you there amen verse 22 and the rib which the Lord God you there which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her to man to the man and Adam said this is now where is that this is now can you read it this is now bone of my bones and what Flesh of My Flesh if you notice born and flesh means what body good let's go back let's read it together again scripture don't play with words Adam said this is what this is what now now in other words he was not before are we okay everybody okay let's go slowly and Adam didn't say this is one of my friends treasure map no no no this is now because before Eve was not flesh of his face no it was not born of his world in other words it was not in the body yet I don't know if in the spirit but now if it's now and this is the house what now the woman is natural she's a human being like me oh did I lose you read your Bible 15 miles an hour behold my hands and my feet that it is I handle me and see foreign he created man in his own image and likeness so man and female were Spirit they were not flesh yet in Genesis 2 7 Adam and Lon began flesh and power but it was nothing not the if nature but the spirit of Eve was still hanging in it so God took from Adam and pulled the woman taken out of men the womb men out of a man and produces and he took the spirit of Eve that was still hanging around and put it in the body when he brought it to Adam Adam said now the if there was a spirit she is now woman okay did I lost anybody where are we going brother Stephen let's go down there for shall a man leave his words woman because she was taken out of me and clinged to his wife and there shall be Heavenly flesh one there shall be one flesh when man and a woman will do what let's read it again therefore shall water man amen leave his water father and his what mother and shall cling to his what wife not to the woman shall not cling to the woman did you see that he didn't say shall cling to the woman because you will go outside and begin to cling to Every Woman you know you don't you don't cling to Every Woman you need to be first engaged when you engage you have not United yet amen but she is already your wife that's the woman that you cannot continue cleave to your wife and this shall be what one flesh so you are one flesh when you are flesh and his flesh both of the flesh are you following me then you become one in flesh I can say things but it's a mixed audience I hope you get it yes yes I hope you get it that's why it matches let's go to verse 25 and there were both water naked the man and his wife and were not what the shame in other words Adam never made it to the flesh yet So Adam and Eve even though they were married but they didn't consume met here because when they consume it that's when the eyes were what William Marion brother Branham said God made him help me out of his own water body perhaps a rib from over his water hard so she should be close to what him and made him a water help me he really was not his wife as yes if I didn't explain you you're going to have a hard time a wife yet in the flesh you get it he really was not his wife yet no more than he was a man as what yeah he had just worked spoken they were United in the altar God brought them to church and unite them in church and they went but they were not United yet everybody okay and there is what the water Trouble Comes Satan found her before what Adam did he was just his water world wow you're following me amen so before the woman meet the man naturally physically in between the espouses and the physical coming that's what the serpent entered because remember Paul said in the beginning of the church ages that I have his past but he was not marriage yet and in between his passing of power and the marriage and the end time in between the serpent came the Great Dragon the red dragon with 10 horn and seventh head came in between and made again the second he fell a is he clicking now what are you trying to say brother Stephen the Bible said for Adam was what first form that one is deceived what's in the water transgression why was not Adam deceived why was not Adam deceived are you there why was not Adam deceived deceived everybody okay Paul said for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the one image and the water Glory man God that created man was how male female and man that he created was wow male and female and Adam in his body he was loud male and female but the woman is only water female she's not reflecting God in her body that's why they play with the woman body that's why they play with it all the time everybody okay they said for as much as is the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of the water man you ready for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man was the man that gives birth to the woman everybody okay neither was the Man created for what the woman by the woman for water the man because Adam was the Lord so God was worrying about Adam not having Fellowship that's why Malachi say that she is your companion everybody okay for this cause of demand to have power on her head of the woman to have power off on her head because of the water angels we already went through this what are you trying to say you ready yes sir you ready if you know this man is ex and his wife everybody okay and the woman has only X everybody okay imagine we murder for man to win this woman you okay there is a female pot in a manner that is compatible to the female part of the woman everybody here everybody okay Jesus said has been cannot continue husband do what there are many imagine where they engage your ex [Music] [Applause] cannot continue can I continue cannot continue your husband when you are pulling toward the woman in order to pull her towards you you need to engage your ex for God so much that's the only way God can pull you [Applause] amen you don't get it you don't get it you don't get it some are distracted by the baby or by what you don't get it please Focus here God is love the Capstone is lost why is the Capstone law because the Capstone is the head yes the captain is the head and God say husband do what so when the Capstone is coming what does it come with it love because the bond of perfection is what brothers said which is what love how did you get your wife [Music] did you show her did you show her how mean you are what were you trying to attract her you were showing what love you are showing what love you are showing us what that she gets caught up and when she got caught up she's completely lost amen [Applause] everybody okay she's completely lost nobody want anybody else say because the ex had hooked to the eggs [Applause] [Music] do you follow me do you follow me do you follow me what is a woman lacking why see that water she locked the world what did God say about the woman submit meaning give preeminence amen are we okay you are engaging Your Love amen but she's lacking the way and because she locked away she just have to Humble herself in order to allow the wife to express toward him Hallelujah amen well I mean she have to submit to the headship by submitting to the headship the man now after he already got the woman after the sister already said yes I love you you will see him now begin to bring his manhood out that's what the sister like and she needed for her protection relaxing hey man amen the serpent met Eve alone the serpent meant to eat water she was limited to the level of a female spirit and then and that's why she fell in order for Eve not to fail you need to bring the marriage you need to take Eve back to the man make sure Adam is present because when I present then why that was missing is already there there is not that's why Adam was never deceived I don't get that BDC what protected Adam is the wife so what the man is coming he's going to engage the wife all right yes yes Hallelujah can you love a woman in front of her husband can you do that it's already it's always done when the husband is [Applause] everybody okay why because the woman must learn how to submit herself how to give preeminence to the Head and the more you submit the more the health is expressing begin to express then what you are lacking in your life you begin to have it now you are complete the ring that you can resisted is not a game when you show somebody the ring you are telling him this this is the why that I was missing now I am X and Y [Music] 'all everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay that's why a dominating woman is a curse [Applause] that I know not a woman now a woman is not meant to have a water I am in this position she is according to the Holy Spirit a scripture to be what submissive to the water well that is commanded of what her woman who is what truly female will be in that water disposition when you are dominating your home you are getting the picture wrong what God is looking at you he wants you he wants the husband to send love and you submit when both of you hope together like that God get in the middle of it and he forced the marriage nothing will happen to you [Applause] everybody okay but this society and all over the world have promoted the domination of the woman come on there is two kind of domination there is a planned domination that a woman expresses herself no I don't like it and she started since childhood and usually daddy is the one that breathed the spirit thinking he's showing love not understanding that he's making her future worse [Applause] because everything that women want she's getting it not through Mommy it's Daddy everybody okay and she's learning to manipulate [Applause] ever everybody will come so there is two kind of manipulation there is a blind strict manipulation and two kind of domination there is a domination where a woman have an eye on this position she does a woman she doesn't want it no no and if she's angry the whole home is shaking just go visit them without telling them I'm coming [Applause] yelling from the street everybody okay but the most deadly one is a woman that have a domination with manipulation [Applause] I have to cut it off everybody okay what is that manipulation that manipulation is a religious spirit [Applause] and that spirit is usually mingled with
