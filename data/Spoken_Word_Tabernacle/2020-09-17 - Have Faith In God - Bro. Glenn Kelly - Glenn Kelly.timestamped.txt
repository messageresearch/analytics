[3:16] as you're doing what you're you're
[3:17] supposed to be doing and repenting and
[3:19] and staying in in touch with god and
[3:21] praying without seizing
[3:23] ceasing as he told us to do in a
[3:24] scripture but i just look at that and

[28:32] behind the inaudible
[28:52] praise the name of the lord
[28:57] there is a place a perfect place
[29:01] right behind the inner veil very very
[29:04] important to be behind the innervale
[29:07] because that's where your rest is
[29:10] remember there was an ordinance against
[29:12] you and christ
[29:13] took that ordinance and nailed it at the
[29:15] cross
[29:16] and when he did it the veil of the
[29:18] temple split in two
[29:20] when he split now there is an interest
[29:23] you don't have to stay
[29:24] outside you need to go inside because
[29:28] when you get inside
[29:29] then you get the hidden manner praise
[29:32] the name of the lord
[29:33] amen i'm not the one preaching tonight
[29:37] i have our local minister brother kelly
[29:40] will be preaching for us tonight
[29:42] you all know brother kelly so he has his
[29:45] liberty
[29:46] to go ahead and preach the house down
[29:49] like we usually say
[29:51] yeah i'm still standing on something i
[29:53] was trying to get on part
[29:55] four uh the roof serving
[29:58] but brother greg told me something
[30:01] [Laughter]
[30:03] about esther so i have to go back and
[30:05] look about
[30:06] esther have to have the power to write
[30:09] her own declaration despite what was
[30:13] given
[30:14] in other words it seems like the power
[30:16] was handed to the bride
[30:18] but the bride was not aware and she went
[30:21] into the at the feet of the king and
[30:23] begin to whip
[30:25] to cry until the king unveiled like
[30:28] you know the man called mordechai there
[30:31] is something that mordecai have
[30:34] that if you know the under if you have
[30:36] the revelation
[30:38] of that you can go ahead and reverse
[30:44] amen it was a seal
[30:47] a ring a signal and judah also
[30:51] have a signet so we got to deal with the
[30:55] sickness of judah
[30:57] deal with the scepter of judah and deal
[30:59] with all those things
[31:01] to make you understand the power and the
[31:04] position
[31:05] that you have in christ amen
[31:09] you don't have to be accepting things

[35:10] you know we just thank the lord for this
[35:12] opportunity you know you may be seated
[35:14] for
[35:14] a minute before we from the scriptures i
[35:16] just wanted some of you
[35:18] know me and know of me and like so i'm
[35:20] looking in and
[35:21] i'll do my best to stay still tonight
[35:24] okay
[35:26] i know it's tough when you're there but
[35:28] some see this is a great opportunity
[35:31] for me to come thank you musicians
[35:35] to come and sit up under a ministry like
[35:37] this
[35:39] what god have saved for last
[35:42] and you know all of us have our
[35:45] testimonies
[35:46] and in this hour here and then and we're
[35:48] still praying and
[35:50] looking for others to come in is that
[35:52] right
[35:53] because we now as the lord have showed
[35:55] us he put us on heart a little bit greg
[35:57] but he has some more force in that
[35:59] lesson doughnuts
[36:00] but one thing we do know what
[36:03] we're in the royal land uh right and
[36:06] we're royal blood
[36:08] right and we are in the melchizedek
[36:11] gallery is that right
[36:13] so we know god is bringing us in there
[36:15] because you are what you know we're
[36:17] still
[36:17] two looking at them is that right
[36:19] brother brahma always told us
[36:21] two forces it was the son of god it was
[36:23] the sons of the prophets is that right
[36:26] so we thank god for being with the sons
[36:29] of god is that right
[36:30] because we know that we thrive and we
[36:32] feed off with a revelation of the word
[36:34] of god
[36:36] so we come in this out here now so i was
[36:39] just looking at a little
[36:40] lesson here and giving our pastor a
[36:43] break i'm glad i thank the lord for
[36:44] putting me on his heart
[36:46] you know uh it's like you know john the
[36:48] baptist he
[36:49] they said he was a man a rugged man he
[36:51] was a man of the wilderness
[36:53] so you may see a lot of my terminology
[36:55] because i was a man of the prisons of
[36:57] the jails and other streets
[36:59] so i came from a different background of
[37:02] different so you're so
[37:03] don't get upset if i use some certain
[37:06] terminology so you can understand
[37:08] why god had me sitting under certain
[37:10] ministers in there
[37:11] because that's a special ministry
[37:14] it's a special ministry i know we've
[37:16] good and i heard the brother
[37:18] uh brother hayden the minister about you
[37:21] know is the heaviness on people's hearts
[37:23] and in them but you know i thank god
[37:25] where he put me at because he couldn't
[37:27] have put me anywhere else
[37:28] because it was a heaviness on my heart
[37:31] you know when you go into a place where
[37:33] i was i was familiar when you go into a
[37:35] place
[37:36] and souls are hungry they're thirsty
[37:39] i miss that you miss it
[37:43] and you know so but god has a place for
[37:45] us right now and it's feeding us
[37:48] so that we can prepare for something
[37:50] down the road is that right
[37:52] he's preparing us for down the road so
[37:54] you know when you see the god using your
[37:56] pastor
[37:57] we're going to show you you know you
[37:59] gotta get humble
[38:01] you know don't rush them you see what
[38:04] i'm saying we thank ones like greg
[38:05] and and the other brother and going home
[38:08] and they're digging into the word after
[38:10] the word that
[38:11] came here is that right god show us it
[38:14] it's all in the word and it's all in
[38:16] this message of this hour
[38:18] this is coming i i thank the lord but i
[38:20] was just as happy
[38:22] sitting there sitting in the amen corner
[38:24] and being fed is that right
[38:26] is that right this is fresh man and
[38:28] that's coming in from heaven but right
[38:30] now the lot has fell on me
[38:32] tonight is that right so we have to
[38:34] understand you know we've seen we'll
[38:36] share some testimonies in between by the
[38:38] grace of god
[38:39] that my son was here you know he just
[38:40] kind of hit the surface but it was a lot
[38:42] it's a lot going on
[38:44] you know i know brother john and
[38:46] different other ones has
[38:47] family members in them that are on the
[38:49] police force you know we constantly pray
[38:51] for them
[38:52] but they're the ones to get them to meet
[38:54] is that right huh
[38:56] so that's why we have to understand god
[38:58] has
[38:59] been hidden in all places so that he can
[39:02] well send the word for his elect bride
[39:05] we don't know where they're at you know
[39:06] what they're troubling with we don't
[39:08] know what they're struggling with
[39:09] is that right but we know that they're
[39:12] in all walks of life
[39:14] so god has send us to earnestly contend
[39:16] for this faith
[39:17] in this hour here now we want to always
[39:20] remember
[39:21] and that we are after the lost souls is
[39:23] that right
[39:24] once we get that last scene and we're up
[39:27] out of here
[39:28] but we wanted to by the grace of god and
[39:32] you know everything that that we're
[39:33] doing we're not just doing it
[39:36] when you hear the pastor say this is the
[39:39] church
[39:40] of christ and these are things these are
[39:42] the way of the lord even little children
[39:45] i don't have time to go to all the
[39:47] quotes i got my uh
[39:48] my uh timer set and this time brother
[39:52] i'm gonna keep that phone in my pocket
[39:53] this time brother bailey thank you
[39:55] i got the timer we had the timer set but
[39:58] you know when brother john
[39:59] and the ones coming in he called
[40:01] individuals to pray
[40:03] that's why we're going to be working
[40:04] with tonight our topic is still we're
[40:06] still going to be working with prayer
[40:08] confidence in prayer do you have
[40:09] confidence in your prayer
[40:11] because the reason why john is doing
[40:13] what he's doing or who's ever
[40:15] conducting brother abel and different
[40:17] ones when they call you up to pray
[40:19] is because your prayer is just as
[40:21] powerful as anybody else's prayer
[40:24] in here the children prayer so we have
[40:27] to
[40:27] understand that's why we're training
[40:29] them up train a child up in the way that
[40:31] he should go
[40:32] i remember brother branham said he had a
[40:34] quote in there where he had a child to
[40:36] come up there and pray
[40:37] and he said about a week or so later he
[40:40] said
[40:40] he saw that prayer answered he saw that
[40:43] person healed
[40:44] so we're transforming so so we are the
[40:46] church of jesus christ
[40:48] he is restoring his word this is not
[40:50] just the spoken
[40:52] word of god this is the manifestation of
[40:55] the spoken word of god
[40:57] this is the hour for it all is that
[40:59] right god extended his grace you're
[41:02] going to see
[41:02] some had to be did not did not the lord
[41:05] have our pastor say something gotta be
[41:07] whooped a little harder is that right
[41:09] so i'm gonna have to right but he
[41:11] promised what i'm not gonna lose
[41:13] not a one is that right sometimes you
[41:16] know i get to preaching fast i don't
[41:18] want my yankee
[41:19] a voice to come out you don't understand
[41:22] me
[41:23] but that's why when we were in here
[41:24] ministering last time
[41:26] we said you know when the coin the
[41:28] prophet of god said when the coin was in
[41:30] that
[41:30] fish's mouth he typed that with what a
[41:33] trustee is that right
[41:34] and he got around in there and he said
[41:36] sometimes you got to be rebuked and
[41:38] coming in
[41:38] he typed that with what a pastor's
[41:41] office is that right
[41:42] and he said sometime you got to come in
[41:44] and turn tables over is that right
[41:47] well he's caught he'd count that as a
[41:48] beak he typed that with a deacon's
[41:50] office
[41:51] but that was perfect love coming down
[41:54] there is that right
[41:55] is that right so we have to understand
[41:58] that we're all being trained that was
[42:00] perfect they couldn't see
[42:01] that that was perfect love when jesus
[42:03] first came in there well i don't want to
[42:05] get ahead of myself i want you to see
[42:07] some things
[42:07] is that right so we want you to
[42:10] understand
[42:10] because see when understanding comes
[42:13] confidence comes
[42:14] confidence faith come faith is only a
[42:17] revelation
[42:18] revelation can only come to you by god
[42:21] is that right
[42:22] so somewhere down to each and every one
[42:24] of us that's why the lord
[42:26] tell us to what pray praying what
[42:29] watch is that right pray and watch
[42:32] you stay prayed up at all time pray
[42:35] without ceasing because we're looking
[42:38] for the coming of the lord
[42:40] the coming of the lord we know things
[42:42] has happened in israel over in jerusalem
[42:44] i let the pastor take care of that i
[42:46] won't touch that
[42:47] but but the signs and showing is right
[42:50] among
[42:50] us we should be a glorious time we get
[42:53] ready to get out of here is that right
[42:56] huh so your sister's uh the trail you're
[42:58] looking good from the last time we
[43:00] minutes the god did something for you
[43:02] is that right you hold on to it is that
[43:05] right
[43:06] we're gonna look at it and we don't have
[43:08] much tonight we're not gonna
[43:09] turn many scriptures but we want you to
[43:12] see what the confidence is that god has
[43:14] put in you
[43:15] and me is that right so now we can stand
[43:18] and i'll
[43:19] read the scripture i'll tell you what
[43:21] let's go over to uh
[43:23] mark 11.
[43:27] and then i'll read that scripture then
[43:29] i'll read the other scriptures and
[43:30] you may be seated
[43:34] okay we've got mark 11. let's look at
[43:38] the
[43:41] start at verse uh 20. once you have it
[43:44] say amen it says and in the morning
[43:48] as they passed by they saw the fig tree
[43:51] dried up from the roots
[43:53] and peter calling to remember it saying
[43:55] unto him
[43:56] master behold the fig tree which thou
[43:59] curses is withered away you see what the
[44:02] pastor was just saying
[44:03] we move it in two wise what you say
[44:07] this is what you say he said now we get
[44:10] over there he says
[44:11] and jesus answers save unto them
[44:14] have what faith in god see that's what's
[44:18] going to be our
[44:19] topic on tonight we're still working
[44:20] with confidence but have faith in god
[44:23] he said now he says for verily i say
[44:26] unto you
[44:27] that whosoever shall say unto this
[44:29] mountain
[44:30] thou and thou remove and be
[44:33] thou cast to the sea and shall not do
[44:36] what
[44:37] doubt in his heart but shall
[44:41] believe that those things which he saved
[44:44] shall come to pass
[44:46] he shall have whatsoever he saith is
[44:48] that right
[44:49] he said therefore i say unto you what
[44:52] things so ever ye what desire
[44:56] when ye pray believe that ye
[44:59] receive them and ye shall have them
[45:03] you may be seen it may the lord had a
[45:05] blessing to the reading of his word
[45:07] and i want to read the first um
[45:11] i want to go to first john and two
[45:16] amen y'all gonna be praying with me
[45:19] okay i don't spoke the word i'm gonna
[45:21] put the word out to you you're supposed
[45:22] to be praying is that right
[45:24] ah so he says look at the first
[45:28] john two and twenty eight do you have to
[45:31] say amen
[45:33] okay let me say uh
[45:36] there we go he says in doubt did i write
[45:39] that down
[45:40] right
[45:45] i think it was when i say first john
[45:49] i think i might have wrote that down
[45:55] oh
[45:58] okay i got it thank you thank you jesus
[46:01] he says and now little children abide in
[46:05] him
[46:06] that when he shall appear we may have
[46:10] what
[46:11] confidence and not be ashamed before
[46:14] him at his what his coming is that right
[46:18] you're being prepared by the word you
[46:19] don't have to be then let's go to first
[46:21] john
[46:21] 3 and 21.
[46:27] and he says beloved if our heart what
[46:29] condemn us not
[46:31] then have we what confidence towards god
[46:35] see we have confidence towards the word
[46:37] we have confidence in it
[46:39] because because we know what we're
[46:42] getting
[46:42] is the truth is that right we know that
[46:45] god cannot tell us we know that he can't
[46:48] but we want to look at three point
[46:51] little points here with job a familiar
[46:53] passage is
[46:54] a scripture with job we know here the
[46:57] prophet of god
[46:58] and he was working with it is he says
[47:00] have ye heard
[47:02] but now i see this is the thought here
[47:05] that he was kind of working with and
[47:06] that god they
[47:08] helped me a lot with the thought that
[47:10] was pricked and um
[47:11] pricked my heart so just bear with me
[47:14] like i said just pray with me
[47:16] for this hour we gonna be here but we
[47:18] gonna just be here for an hour i know
[47:20] it's the
[47:20] it's the hawk week is that right we know
[47:22] where the hunt was the middle of the
[47:24] week we know you pressed your way out
[47:25] but god got a blessing for us all
[47:27] that's why i said pray with me he said
[47:30] now
[47:31] we know we know that job he was a man
[47:34] that was chosen there by god he was a
[47:37] mighty man and he was a prophet
[47:40] but we know god chose job to go through
[47:42] something is that right
[47:44] and when he chose job to go through this
[47:46] but it was for the glory of god
[47:49] and god told them and as he chose him to
[47:52] go through this
[47:52] through the glory of god many things
[47:56] that he had to suffer but then there was
[47:58] one thing he didn't have to suffer
[48:01] because brother branham said that he all
[48:03] the things that he suffered but he
[48:04] didn't have to
[48:06] but because what he didn't have that
[48:08] faith that he was
[48:09] totally really needing is that right
[48:12] brother branham said those things
[48:13] has some of those things happened was
[48:16] because
[48:17] of what he feared god the things that he
[48:19] feared he didn't have that total
[48:21] faith he wasn't totally trusting in god
[48:24] he didn't have it now this hour here
[48:26] now we shouldn't have that because we
[48:28] got the fullness of the word is that
[48:30] right
[48:30] so god is telling us to have faith in
[48:32] god it's not just the letter
[48:34] of the word it's the manifestation of
[48:37] the word
[48:38] he said and then now look let me read
[48:40] this he says in may
[48:42] now i i don't have like brother brother
[48:44] steve so y'all don't have to pay
[48:45] attention is that right
[48:47] he got that power point i love that
[48:49] power play so y'all just gonna have to
[48:50] listen to me
[48:53] he said he didn't have a one in the ear
[48:55] let him hear
[48:56] what the spirit has to say is that right
[48:58] so we're all doing it by what faith is
[49:01] that right
[49:02] hallelujah he says now he says may the
[49:05] lord bless his word joe let's just a
[49:07] little look at
[49:07] job job was the prophet he was a man
[49:10] that lived back before the bible was
[49:12] written he thought that job was one of
[49:14] the oldest books of the bible
[49:16] because it was written before genesis
[49:19] was written
[49:20] job this great warrior the prophet a
[49:22] mighty man in his day
[49:23] no doubt that he had had brought up and
[49:26] has served though he had served the lord
[49:28] of his life
[49:29] see your children your parents is
[49:31] training you up according to the word of
[49:33] god
[49:33] the word to come you ought to thank god
[49:35] for this some of us were brought out of
[49:37] different lives
[49:38] some of them was brought out of
[49:39] different walks and maybe
[49:41] you know they went through certain
[49:43] things and they got testimonies and they
[49:45] try to make your children feel
[49:47] bad because maybe you don't have the
[49:49] testimonies or you didn't go anything
[49:51] but you got a greater testimony you know
[49:53] why because you had a god that can keep
[49:55] you from going through what i went
[49:57] through
[49:57] is that right so you you you tell them
[50:00] those things we got the word for the
[50:01] devil is that right
[50:03] i'm telling cause we are the jehovah
[50:04] witnesses is that right
[50:06] i was telling the fellow there at work i
[50:08] said don't bring me that religion
[50:09] brother
[50:10] that's why some it got a little offended
[50:12] some thought when i was from the last
[50:14] time we was here
[50:15] i made that statement about that jehovah
[50:17] witness you know why
[50:18] because that was the devil trying to
[50:20] come up to me and trying to trick me
[50:22] what he was trying to say was he said
[50:24] who are you worshiping
[50:25] i see if i would have told him god and
[50:28] then he would have said
[50:29] then what's his name if i would have
[50:31] told him jesus christ
[50:33] i'm not going to throw my pearls to
[50:35] swine i already knew what he was going
[50:37] to try to do
[50:38] you see what i'm saying if jehovah is so
[50:41] great
[50:41] if it's jehovah and you got a revelation
[50:43] of your jehovah
[50:44] why haven't you seen no jehovah
[50:46] witnesses witnessing on the street
[50:51] why don't you see them out there huh
[50:53] because they don't have the faith
[50:55] that god has restored to us before the
[50:57] foundation
[50:58] of the world i'm trying to sit still i'm
[51:01] trying to sit still
[51:03] huh religious demons
[51:08] religious statements i saw a pastor
[51:11] i was praying i saw a pastor
[51:15] moving to that pastor office when he was
[51:18] saying
[51:19] feeling the infirmities of our brothers
[51:21] feeling the infirmities of their
[51:23] families
[51:24] we come and we reach out to them because
[51:27] why because we know
[51:28] all things are possible to them that
[51:31] believe
[51:32] brother branham said a true believer if
[51:34] a true believer
[51:36] had what he believes everything is
[51:38] impossible
[51:40] he said that's what he says keep reading
[51:44] look at job he says in his life it says
[51:46] and had lived
[51:47] such a gallant to the people gathering
[51:49] life to the people
[51:51] all have respects for him but he come to
[51:53] a place where he calls it
[51:55] here he being tempted of who he's being
[51:59] tempted of
[52:00] god god is just using the devil to do
[52:04] it but it's god doing it
[52:08] that's why the pastor said this is god
[52:10] that's causing this split
[52:13] every time it is you got to go listen to
[52:15] the uh
[52:16] what the the uh message of the end time
[52:20] end time messenger and see what god said
[52:23] in here
[52:24] the split is what he called it he said i
[52:27] pressed to the mark of the prize of the
[52:28] high calling
[52:29] forgetting those things that are behind
[52:31] me huh
[52:34] they're looking like sheep and wolf
[52:36] clothing
[52:38] huh but they're preaching really against
[52:40] the cross
[52:42] they're not god tell us they try to say
[52:44] about the mysteries brother greg
[52:46] but the bible don't say that over the
[52:49] first samuel 8
[52:50] he told samuel why he says samuel
[52:53] he says he's saying you start testifying
[52:56] that what he did for the people and god
[52:59] had to come and tell samuel
[53:01] samuel they're really not against you
[53:03] samuel
[53:04] yeah but they're against me samuel they
[53:07] really don't want this message
[53:09] they really don't care for this end time
[53:11] let's say john but that's what he's
[53:13] saying is our air now
[53:14] they're really against god they want to
[53:16] do it their own way
[53:18] is that right but we get rid of this but
[53:20] god's about to show them the real
[53:22] child of god is about to stand up now
[53:25] i'm something that i heard brother steve
[53:27] said he said they wonder why he got this
[53:29] revelation
[53:30] is that right he got this revelation
[53:32] because why
[53:33] he was like joshua joshua was set up
[53:35] under who moses is that right
[53:37] he got good training he got solid
[53:39] training he yielded to the holy ghost

[53:45] my servant is dead but joshua as i was
[53:48] with my servant
[53:49] i'm with you also
[53:53] it's a different ministry that god has
[53:55] given him

[55:51] prayed and he put someone on your heart
[55:53] enter his gates with thanksgiving with a
[55:55] song on your heart
[55:56] train up a child in the way that he

[56:51] we'll get let me keep going and read
[56:52] this here i'll get it it'll come to you
[56:55] but i'll quote it he said
[57:00] after they were singing and when they
[57:03] came out singing
[57:04] i think they were saying i'll pray for
[57:06] you
[57:08] and brother branham said that's right
[57:11] he said that's prayer i expect your
[57:14] prayers
[57:16] he said that's the mystery to the word
[57:18] of god that's the mystery to the way of
[57:20] god
[57:20] as you pray he said you are the real
[57:24] missionaries
[57:26] we're getting ready for something you're
[57:28] not going to be able to be ready for if
[57:30] you're not praying and watching
[57:32] you see that that was a commission so so
[57:34] many don't have the confidence
[57:36] is because they're not meeting the
[57:38] obligations
[57:40] if you're not meeting the obligations
[57:43] there's no way you're going to have
[57:44] confidence
[57:50] let's see what happens and we're going
[57:52] to and see
[57:54] that's why let me wait on that i want to
[57:56] read this first
[57:57] i'll wait on it
[58:00] he says now look he says the lord
[58:03] he said no doubt that he been brought up
[58:07] and have served the lord we're talking
[58:09] about job
[58:10] and have lived such a gallant to the
[58:14] life to the people have respect for him
[58:16] but he come to a place
[58:18] to where he calls it being tempted he's
[58:21] being tempted of the lord
[58:23] but i like to use the word he said test
[58:26] it
[58:27] and every song come up to god must be
[58:29] what first tried and tested
[58:32] he said now he's coming he he said
[58:36] we'll be coming he'll become an
[58:38] illegitimate child if a person can't
[58:40] handle the test still with me
[58:42] he said now look he says
[58:46] you can no more deny it deny yourself by
[58:49] denying this word
[58:52] see the word cannot offend the word
[58:57] i'm again i'm gonna get to mark 11 but
[58:59] the word cannot
[59:01] offend the word you see because whatever
[59:04] comes across here
[59:06] i remember my brother said he was
[59:07] sitting in a meeting and said he got
[59:08] there and said
[59:09] man i'm not going back to that church
[59:12] that feather called me a buzzer
[59:15] he said i don't know about you i heard
[59:17] him call me an eagle
[59:20] i'm gonna show you faith come by hearing
[59:23] hearing the word of god
[59:25] you see it come by hearing how you hear
[59:27] it
[59:28] now let's jump back to mark 11. he said
[59:31] now look he said and the scribes and the
[59:33] chief
[59:34] priests did what i'm at verse 18
[59:37] they heard it and sought how they might
[59:40] destroy him
[59:41] for they feared him see because of
[59:44] all the people was just starting at his
[59:46] what
[59:52] where'd he go where'd you go for i know
[59:55] some of them screaming in
[59:56] god gave me grace to say i'm gonna say
[59:58] it
[1:00:01] that's why that's why we met many souls
[1:00:03] when we was in the prison when the
[1:00:04] prisons was open went to jail for
[1:00:06] something
[1:00:06] it's not not that i was such a better
[1:00:08] preacher than them guys
[1:00:09] and them guys can preach some of them
[1:00:11] theologians man they know the scriptures
[1:00:13] front moves in backwards but the
[1:00:15] difference between them and me
[1:00:16] is i had the message of the hour i had
[1:00:19] the truth with me
[1:00:20] god vindicated i didn't have to back
[1:00:22] down off a note devil
[1:00:25] this word would defeat the devil
[1:00:26] anywhere anytime anyplace
[1:00:28] you know why they say he said the priest
[1:00:30] in them was astonished that his what
[1:00:33] doctrine and his teaching
[1:00:41] you know what they got around there
[1:00:42] that's right brother that's right
[1:00:44] brother abel
[1:00:45] you know why they got around in there
[1:00:47] because see when a man was on the
[1:00:49] streets
[1:00:49] where he coming from and they found out
[1:00:52] they had trouble with heroin
[1:00:54] and if the man overdosed somebody on the
[1:00:57] street
[1:00:57] overdosed from heroin the true
[1:01:00] drug addict he did not run from the
[1:01:04] strongest dope that was on the street
[1:01:07] he was looking for that dope is that
[1:01:10] right
[1:01:10] because he know he can get maybe three
[1:01:12] shots out of it at least two
[1:01:14] but maybe three so why when you see this
[1:01:17] kind of peachy
[1:01:18] why when you see this kind of doctor why
[1:01:20] are you running from it
[1:01:22] ah
[1:01:28] because now you find out you got to go
[1:01:31] on the back side of
[1:01:32] that doctor huh now you call man
[1:01:36] one thing he said when i met him he said
[1:01:39] brother kelly he said it gotta come out
[1:01:42] of the scriptures
[1:01:47] his brother symbol don't bring the don't
[1:01:49] come with me with that devil
[1:01:51] you see that the men's backing it by the
[1:01:53] scriptures
[1:01:54] oh he's that hungering and thirst for
[1:01:56] righteousness shall be
[1:01:58] filled over the prophet of god said you
[1:02:00] can never overemphasize
[1:02:02] revelation revelation revelation
[1:02:06] where'd they go they left because of the
[1:02:08] doctrine they left because of the
[1:02:09] teachings
[1:02:12] now you got to change now you got to
[1:02:14] humble yourself i love it
[1:02:15] who wants to be wrong i don't want to be
[1:02:17] wrong if god sent a person there on the
[1:02:18] scene is that right
[1:02:20] huh paul set up under the best teacher
[1:02:22] in the land i don't know why i'm going
[1:02:23] this way that wasn't even in my notes
[1:02:24] but i'm going and believing to him
[1:02:26] he said why paul said one of the best
[1:02:28] teachers in the land didn't it brother
[1:02:30] or the camilla and is that right but
[1:02:32] gamilion but when he met who
[1:02:34] jesus when joshua came on the land
[1:02:37] when the holy ghost came on the land he
[1:02:39] said them
[1:02:40] he shall be what he will lead you he
[1:02:43] will guide you he will protect you
[1:02:45] he will teach you he's your comforter is
[1:02:48] that right
[1:02:48] i heard a brother say at the family
[1:02:50] meeting brother haven't said the family
[1:02:52] meeting what do you say brother abel
[1:02:53] need more the holy ghost don't they yes
[1:02:56] sir why was the holy ghost sin
[1:02:58] the holy ghost was sent to give to you
[1:03:00] so we continue this walk is that right
[1:03:02] god wanted fellowship he wanted to
[1:03:05] increase your power in prayer
[1:03:07] he wanted to do all these things he said
[1:03:09] but i will not leave you
[1:03:10] comfortless i will send you what the
[1:03:12] comforter see let not your heart
[1:03:14] be troubled is that right because a
[1:03:17] physical condition
[1:03:18] can cause a what a spiritual condition
[1:03:21] a spiritual condition can call a spirit
[1:03:24] can call a physical condition
[1:03:26] let me see if i have yeah i had it down
[1:03:28] here in my notes i got it right down
[1:03:29] here the lord brought that thing
[1:03:31] brought that uh uh months ago to us
[1:03:34] didn't he
[1:03:34] let's see what he said down here and see
[1:03:36] what he said about it hello thank you
[1:03:38] jesus
[1:03:39] he said fear weakens the what kidney
[1:03:42] is that right come on holy ghost huh
[1:03:46] he said anger weakens the what the liver
[1:03:49] is that right huh he says stress weakens
[1:03:52] the what
[1:03:53] the heart is that right he said worry we
[1:03:56] can do what
[1:03:57] the stomach is that right he said grief
[1:04:00] we can do what
[1:04:01] the lungs is that right but why did he
[1:04:04] say that that was going to keep
[1:04:06] keep coming but we don't have to accept
[1:04:09] that he said greater is he
[1:04:11] that is in thee than he that is in the
[1:04:13] world he said i'ma show you
[1:04:15] that you're a special group of people
[1:04:17] none of these diseases none of these
[1:04:19] sickness shall come upon you
[1:04:21] it's what you say is that right what you
[1:04:24] buying on earth it should be buying in
[1:04:26] heaven what you loose on earth you
[1:04:27] should be loose in heaven
[1:04:29] is that right daddy don't have to be
[1:04:31] there sister
[1:04:32] if your child gets sick you can do what
[1:04:34] you can lay hands on them is that right
[1:04:36] huh you don't know how god to get a
[1:04:39] person out of a situation
[1:04:40] you just trust in god have faith in god
[1:04:44] hallelujah we're moving somewhere
[1:04:48] just pray with me he said now look
[1:04:51] he said his bible wasn't he said the
[1:04:54] bible wasn't wrote then remember job
[1:04:56] didn't have that bible is that right
[1:04:58] he said he said he he didn't have the
[1:05:00] bible then he said that was before
[1:05:02] then but he had access
[1:05:06] by god by revelation and visions
[1:05:09] is that right that's what he had he said
[1:05:12] now when god blessed him
[1:05:14] and made him a great man why even
[1:05:16] everybody respected him
[1:05:18] through his wisdom had become so great
[1:05:22] his inspiration from god had vindicated
[1:05:25] him
[1:05:26] to be god's servant so plainly
[1:05:29] what we are getting has vindicated
[1:05:32] that this is god's servant that's coming
[1:05:35] here feeding his children
[1:05:36] in this hour here now is that right he
[1:05:39] said i'll never leave you
[1:05:40] or forsake you is that right so that's
[1:05:43] why you have all you sitting out there
[1:05:45] praying and watching over the word where
[1:05:48] god
[1:05:49] is now is that right it won't be long
[1:05:51] i'm telling you saints you look at the
[1:05:53] prophecies and things around us
[1:05:54] it won't be long he says the inspiration
[1:05:57] from god
[1:05:58] vindicated him to be god's servant so
[1:06:01] plainly
[1:06:01] until the people come from everywhere to
[1:06:03] hear he said now look
[1:06:06] he says and then satan begins to accuse
[1:06:08] that man
[1:06:10] why say his tactics he begins to accuse
[1:06:13] that man
[1:06:14] he begins to to bring a accusation
[1:06:18] to get him but what we gotta pray in
[1:06:20] force is that right
[1:06:22] we gotta pray and forth the last time we
[1:06:24] was here we said pray in the prayer of
[1:06:26] faith
[1:06:26] is that right do we always feel it do we
[1:06:30] always have it
[1:06:31] no brother branham didn't always feel
[1:06:33] that brother branham didn't always have
[1:06:35] it
[1:06:35] let me read this quote to you and you
[1:06:37] could see say what you talking about
[1:06:39] brother
[1:06:40] brother kelly look at this here
[1:06:43] he said now
[1:06:46] he says sometimes i feel a person when
[1:06:48] they come to me i feel that pressure of
[1:06:50] faith
[1:06:51] come against me
[1:06:54] he said maybe maybe they're blind death
[1:06:57] or dumb he said but when i feel that
[1:06:59] pressure come
[1:07:00] against me that i that i know
[1:07:03] that it's faith
[1:07:06] i usually stop like that because if if
[1:07:09] them
[1:07:10] people have faith for it to be done
[1:07:13] no matter what's wrong with them but if
[1:07:16] i don't feel that faith
[1:07:18] he said i ask i just ask a prayer
[1:07:22] of what faith still hear me
[1:07:26] i pray the prayer of faith
[1:07:30] now you see so sometimes he may not
[1:07:34] be feeling it up here we may not be
[1:07:36] feeling it up here
[1:07:38] but remember the lady that had the baby
[1:07:40] and she got around
[1:07:42] it and they were there she didn't have
[1:07:43] the prayer card and when he got there he
[1:07:45] told me said now look
[1:07:47] she wanted she was concerned about the
[1:07:49] baby being healed
[1:07:51] and it was the sister if my wife was
[1:07:53] sitting there and the sister had the
[1:07:55] baby
[1:07:55] he said it said do you mind the sister
[1:07:58] she was anointed with the faith at that
[1:08:01] time
[1:08:02] and he told him now would you would you
[1:08:04] mind if i pray for your baby
[1:08:07] he says no i don't she prayed for that
[1:08:10] baby
[1:08:10] and when he got up there he said he came
[1:08:12] in the prayer line
[1:08:14] and he'd been brought up to the prayer
[1:08:15] line and he looked at it he says
[1:08:18] the woman prayed for your baby while you
[1:08:21] was there in the audience
[1:08:22] he said the baby going your way the baby
[1:08:25] is already healed
[1:08:28] you see who you are i'm talking about do
[1:08:31] you have confidence
[1:08:32] in your prayer once you meet the
[1:08:35] obligations
[1:08:36] is that right let me keep reading we're
[1:08:38] going to show you
[1:08:40] job job what god had did and how god had
[1:08:43] chose job
[1:08:44] job could not fail god was allowing job
[1:08:47] to be tested
[1:08:48] god is allowing you to be tested the
[1:08:50] devil can't come to you until you get
[1:08:52] permission from god
[1:08:53] because god already know that not so
[1:08:56] much to having the confidence
[1:08:58] is we having the confidence in god but
[1:09:00] god got confidence in you
[1:09:02] you are fighting yourself god put the
[1:09:05] confidence
[1:09:06] already in you he's just trying to get
[1:09:08] you to move that's all he's trying to
[1:09:09] get you to do
[1:09:11] he's saying look now
[1:09:14] what's that confidence he put it there
[1:09:17] and he put that confidence in joke he's
[1:09:19] the only reason why the things came upon
[1:09:20] joke because he feared
[1:09:22] see you don't have the fear you know you
[1:09:24] don't have to god said
[1:09:25] i did not give you the spirit of what
[1:09:28] fear but love
[1:09:29] peace joy and a sound mind is that right
[1:09:33] he's bringing you a word oh all he knew
[1:09:36] all the prophet
[1:09:37] god was saying see that's why you can't
[1:09:39] look at me look at brother brandon we
[1:09:41] got a balance with brother branham
[1:09:43] is that right we got a balance you watch
[1:09:46] the spirit that's moving in there now
[1:09:48] you got some of them that come and won't
[1:09:50] even hardly say his name down
[1:09:52] because they let that spirit that they
[1:09:54] left from
[1:09:55] convince them put questions in their
[1:09:57] minds
[1:09:58] he put questions in their mind whether
[1:10:01] or not
[1:10:02] if he was malachi 4 is that right they
[1:10:05] tried to come with john the baptist
[1:10:06] but god so rich and mercy
[1:10:10] had brought us the word it showed us by
[1:10:13] the scripture
[1:10:14] that he was what malachi 4 is that right
[1:10:18] four and five so when he come around in
[1:10:20] there why
[1:10:22] so many other men in this age
[1:10:25] this is what i tell them i battle these
[1:10:26] things behind the prison walls of
[1:10:28] different
[1:10:29] for a while see i would say the prophet
[1:10:31] of god
[1:10:32] the prophet of god so somebody's going
[1:10:34] to catch it he said he had having here
[1:10:36] let him hear what the spirit has to say
[1:10:38] so the only way to say is that right he
[1:10:39] didn't have faith let him catch it
[1:10:41] faith is a revelation it's the spirit
[1:10:42] now you're moving in why because they
[1:10:44] meet the obligation
[1:10:45] the obligation you come in the truth he
[1:10:47] said word he that hunger in the thirst
[1:10:49] at the righteousness shall be what
[1:10:51] ah look at how simple that obligation
[1:10:54] all you got to do is hunger in the
[1:10:55] thirst is that right
[1:10:56] if you hung in the thirst and you want
[1:10:57] the truth you shall be filled god cannot
[1:10:59] take that away
[1:11:00] is that right what other man that came
[1:11:03] here on this earth
[1:11:04] is that right we can rightfully divide
[1:11:06] that office first we got to bring him to
[1:11:08] the office because most of your gentiles
[1:11:10] one of the sisters
[1:11:10] she's asked a question when she asked
[1:11:12] the question when he got around and then
[1:11:14] i thought oh listen i love that
[1:11:16] fellowship with the family
[1:11:17] i love that fellowship i heard you hear
[1:11:20] a lot of things where people are
[1:11:22] sister wanted witness she wanted witness
[1:11:24] she wanted to tell him about that
[1:11:26] but she don't want to say brother
[1:11:27] brandon brother brandon brother brandon
[1:11:28] brother branham
[1:11:29] she's not one she don't want to say that
[1:11:31] she was thirsting inside
[1:11:32] i want to win a soul to the kingdom of
[1:11:34] god but how do i win it
[1:11:36] wisdom comes from god you know when we
[1:11:38] was a salesman i was a salesman back
[1:11:40] then we had took the worst route that
[1:11:41] there was i had the slowest route that
[1:11:44] there was the time
[1:11:45] wasn't making any money in that but see
[1:11:47] when you're hustling drugs and you're on
[1:11:48] the streets when you start selling
[1:11:50] all that is is what is a professional
[1:11:52] way of hustling
[1:11:53] right now when you're selling the chips
[1:11:55] you're selling these different things
[1:11:57] now you've been moved from the street so
[1:11:59] a good salesman
[1:12:00] is not a good talker sister a good
[1:12:03] salesman is a good listener
[1:12:06] you can't sell them unless you know what
[1:12:08] they're after
[1:12:10] you see what i'm saying so now wisdom
[1:12:12] comes from god
[1:12:13] and when we come around in there so when
[1:12:15] you get over there that's why
[1:12:17] he comes in faith come by hearing and
[1:12:19] hearing by the word of god
[1:12:21] that's why we're saying some are still
[1:12:23] wondering some is wondering which way
[1:12:25] should i go
[1:12:26] some is still not sure is that right
[1:12:28] some are not even witnessing
[1:12:30] why are you not witnessing because
[1:12:32] you're not witnessing this because
[1:12:34] you're not sure huh
[1:12:36] you're not sure of what you have you
[1:12:39] don't
[1:12:39] truly believe it that's why i said have
[1:12:42] faith in god
[1:12:43] he withered the tree it was supposed to
[1:12:45] be what some things only at the time is
[1:12:47] that right
[1:12:47] but it wasn't any fruit it was just
[1:12:49] religion all they had was
[1:12:51] covering is that right so you got to get
[1:12:53] them
[1:12:54] you've got let me get let me get back to
[1:12:56] this hallelujah
[1:12:59] once you see another prayer of faith he
[1:13:02] says
[1:13:03] any group of people any gathering of
[1:13:05] holiness people that believe in christ
[1:13:07] has the excuse me has the right to have
[1:13:09] the nine spiritual gifts
[1:13:12] it circles through the body
[1:13:16] it circles through the body it's in the
[1:13:18] body it's not a praying individual
[1:13:22] that's why i said now you see what i
[1:13:23] said i see why able and now you see why
[1:13:26] i am
[1:13:26] first of all your reason why you get
[1:13:28] there i'm gonna hit you i'm gonna pinch
[1:13:30] you with something now
[1:13:31] it's because you ain't praying at home

[1:13:35] hope you don't pray for me
[1:13:36] i sure don't pray for me and maybe god

[1:13:39] oh i sure hope you don't call on me i
[1:13:42] sure hope we don't
[1:13:43] you know why maybe god deliver you from

[1:16:56] he created a man in his image and his
[1:16:58] likeness
[1:16:59] what is being really thirsting for he's
[1:17:01] thirsting for god

[1:18:09] come on all this looking for is right
[1:18:12] after nehemiah i believe i mean esther
[1:18:14] i'm sorry look here he says now look job
[1:18:18] chapter one he said there was a man in
[1:18:22] the land
[1:18:23] of us who name was job
[1:18:26] and and that man was perfect in an
[1:18:28] upright and one that
[1:18:30] feared god and extreme evil
[1:18:35] you think god was wearing you think god
[1:18:36] was worrying about joke failing
[1:18:40] you think god was worrying about job
[1:18:42] that's right brother
[1:18:44] that's that's right brother no he was
[1:18:46] not
[1:18:47] because the word of god had just
[1:18:50] identified
[1:18:51] job it identified job's character it
[1:18:54] identified that this is my man and it's
[1:18:57] ours
[1:19:03] he said now you look he said job of the
[1:19:08] character
[1:19:09] he said then there was born unto him
[1:19:11] seven sons and three daughters
[1:19:13] we dropped down let me drop down to
[1:19:15] verse six
[1:19:16] he says now there was there was a day
[1:19:19] when the sons of god
[1:19:21] came to present themselves before the
[1:19:23] lord and satan came also among
[1:19:26] among them see where it is good as evil
[1:19:28] satan's always present
[1:19:29] he's no good man he's no good put him in
[1:19:33] a pipe he can't move
[1:19:34] that right put a snake in the pipe
[1:19:36] that's great you ain't going away
[1:19:37] he ain't going away take him out of that
[1:19:39] pipe watch it oh nature
[1:19:40] is that right people getting nature in
[1:19:43] the culture mixed up is that right
[1:19:45] they got around in there i know and i'm
[1:19:48] saying it to family i know if i'm
[1:19:50] inviting them
[1:19:52] africans to my house don't cook no hot
[1:19:55] dogs in the hamburgers
[1:20:00] that's a culture a culture and nature is
[1:20:03] too difficult
[1:20:09] you're trying to make them welcome
[1:20:11] you're finding out those things is that
[1:20:12] right
[1:20:13] ah boy we going we gonna keep going
[1:20:17] i'm going to jump down i'll tell you
[1:20:18] what i'm i'm going to jump down to
[1:20:21] let's look at verse 7 verse 7.
[1:20:24] and the lord said unto satan whence
[1:20:26] cometh thou
[1:20:27] he says then answered the lord and said
[1:20:30] from going to
[1:20:31] throwing the earth and from walking up
[1:20:33] and down in it he says and the lord said
[1:20:35] unto satan
[1:20:36] has thou considered my servant job that
[1:20:38] there is none like him
[1:20:40] in the earth a perfect and a upright man
[1:20:43] see one that do what feared god and he's
[1:20:47] true
[1:20:47] evil now you want to drop down here to
[1:20:49] verse uh
[1:20:50] 16 he says uh no no i'm sorry
[1:20:54] verse 21 verse 21
[1:20:57] he says and said naked came i out of
[1:21:00] my mother's womb and naked shall i do
[1:21:04] what
[1:21:05] returned the hitler the lord gave it and
[1:21:08] the lord what
[1:21:09] take it away blessed be the what
[1:21:13] so joe wasn't even looking at those
[1:21:15] things
[1:21:16] satan started accusing job but job was
[1:21:19] more concerned about his character job
[1:21:22] was more concerned about glorifying god
[1:21:25] job was more concerned that god get the
[1:21:28] praises and the honor
[1:21:29] and the glory is that right satan didn't
[1:21:32] have the revelation
[1:21:33] if you take that heads away from job
[1:21:36] well i just gave
[1:21:38] job to hate i gave job those things
[1:21:42] that's not what holding the heads up
[1:21:44] what's holding the heads up was the
[1:21:46] faith
[1:21:47] that job had in god's word
[1:21:56] they missed it that's what jesus said i
[1:21:59] pray that your faith not fail you
[1:22:03] he said peter the devil desired to do
[1:22:06] what
[1:22:07] shifts you but i prayed for you
[1:22:10] huh that's what i was saying we're still
[1:22:13] working with confidence in your prayers
[1:22:15] are you worrying about your child making
[1:22:17] it no no no
[1:22:19] no no no no no no no we are concerned as
[1:22:22] parents but we do not worry that's not a
[1:22:25] good
[1:22:26] we got a promise from god he said what
[1:22:29] you bind on earth
[1:22:30] you're divine in heaven what you loose
[1:22:32] on earth you should lose in heaven
[1:22:34] god has given us the holy ghost
[1:22:37] the holy ghost that he has given us when
[1:22:40] those are running and hiding
[1:22:42] and the wealthy people are looking for a
[1:22:44] place to hide from that atomic bomb
[1:22:46] you know what god has given us the holy
[1:22:49] ghost
[1:22:50] that's the only thing that's going to
[1:22:52] save them from the atomic bomb
[1:22:54] or any other chemical warfare is the
[1:22:57] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:22:58] because thou believe it if you believe
[1:23:01] it go tell
[1:23:04] go tell probably god said
[1:23:07] once you concern you become convinced
[1:23:09] then you'll go
[1:23:10] tell you'll be concerned about the
[1:23:12] condition of this lane
[1:23:15] we have many testimony testimony just
[1:23:19] dropped them from spirit think
[1:23:20] prayer don't work had a man coming in i
[1:23:23] felt his infirmity he was at the bible
[1:23:24] study in the jail
[1:23:25] and he and he looked and he wanted to go
[1:23:27] out he wasn't a jail person
[1:23:29] for whatever reason you've seen it when
[1:23:31] you go in there and up you can see the
[1:23:32] jail ones and you know that's what they
[1:23:33] call them convicts is that right
[1:23:35] cause they're convicts they will con you
[1:23:38] if you don't stay with the words so how
[1:23:41] do you try them you try them by the word
[1:23:43] when you try them by the word if they
[1:23:46] don't want the word then you leave them
[1:23:47] alone
[1:23:48] so you got to understand they came up to
[1:23:50] me when i entered the jail cell
[1:23:52] he said oh i was supposed to get out of
[1:23:55] here today
[1:23:56] and i didn't hear nothing from my lawyer
[1:23:58] and if i didn't hear nothing from him he
[1:24:00] said
[1:24:00] can you uh pray with me so he got there
[1:24:03] i felt his infirmities i moved in with
[1:24:05] his infirmities
[1:24:06] my god then i started praying with and
[1:24:08] we started praying and we sat down
[1:24:10] and when he sat down we got there and he
[1:24:13] about to have the
[1:24:15] bible to study and they called his name
[1:24:18] to go home
[1:24:19] and they called his name to go home now
[1:24:21] nothing i did
[1:24:22] is just us praying the fear of faith is
[1:24:25] that right
[1:24:26] we got to understand these things here
[1:24:29] now those people that's out there
[1:24:31] those protesters any y'all ever protest
[1:24:34] been out on the street protesting
[1:24:36] well i was a protester i was a protester
[1:24:40] i was out there on the street cause i
[1:24:42] believe a true protester
[1:24:44] believes what they're doing is right i'm
[1:24:46] not talking about the mixed multitude
[1:24:49] is that right like you got a mixed
[1:24:50] multitude you got twins and everything
[1:24:52] is that right
[1:24:53] you got a mixed multitude the the
[1:24:56] protesters
[1:24:57] are out there in the daytime they're
[1:24:59] standing there they're locking on
[1:25:01] all nationality sexist male and female
[1:25:04] they're walking and protesting and you
[1:25:07] know what and they're not ashamed of it
[1:25:09] we are protesting we are contending for
[1:25:11] the faith
[1:25:12] because i am not ashamed of the gospel
[1:25:14] of jesus christ
[1:25:15] it's the power of god unto those that
[1:25:18] are saved
[1:25:19] but unto those that what that's why he
[1:25:21] says it's foolishness
[1:25:23] to one that one that don't believe in
[1:25:25] the cross is that right
[1:25:27] they're preaching they're crucifying the
[1:25:28] cross all over again
[1:25:30] because it's just an intellectual gospel
[1:25:32] that they're being preached on
[1:25:34] why because when we were there
[1:25:36] protesting
[1:25:37] i never was doing human humphrey time
[1:25:41] and they wanted to move the poor people
[1:25:43] over turned over to the caucasians
[1:25:45] neighborhood

[1:25:48] going to bust
[1:25:49] us over there just upgrade the schools
[1:25:53] you see so they didn't want to do that
[1:25:56] so now you have a right to protest why
[1:25:59] you talking about an unsaved man the
[1:26:01] devil is in all nationalities
[1:26:03] you better watch out for that spirit out
[1:26:05] there black lives saved
[1:26:07] that's god is not concerned about a
[1:26:09] specific race
[1:26:10] god is concerned about the human race
[1:26:13] god is the creator of all life
[1:26:15] [Applause]
[1:26:18] logic logic
[1:26:21] kennedy that's not what your country can
[1:26:24] do for you but ask what you can do for
[1:26:26] your country
[1:26:28] we are the government we're the people
[1:26:30] of god
[1:26:33] martin luther king i have a dream
[1:26:37] that's his dream he did some good humane
[1:26:39] things

[1:26:51] american right that's your god-given
[1:26:53] american right to vote

[1:26:57] instructed by god to vote for a
[1:26:59] christian
[1:27:02] ah
[1:27:04] see so now he got to understand
[1:27:07] and it's out right now what god has
[1:27:09] called us to do is that right
[1:27:12] only when the only one probably got more
[1:27:14] sense and all of them is don king some

[1:40:52] you're going to write your life yourself
[1:40:54] because whatever you
[1:40:56] bind here over there it's binder

[1:41:48] or something have to take place we
[1:41:50] cannot continue and say okay i'm going
[1:41:52] to keep
[1:41:53] doing like this maybe it's the will of
[1:41:55] god
[1:41:56] i was reading some place brother branham
[1:41:58] saying it is not the will of god
[1:42:00] for you to be sick
[1:42:03] are you there brother branham say if
[1:42:06] it's the will of god why do you go to
[1:42:08] the doctor
[1:42:09] if it's the will of god just leave it
[1:42:11] alone accept accepted and keep suffering
[1:42:15] but the reason why you go to the doctor
[1:42:17] because you're trying to get better
[1:42:19] and the reason why you're trying to get
[1:42:20] better because there is something on you
[1:42:22] telling you that there is a better state
[1:42:25] than what i'm going through now

[1:42:43] heavenly father lord we thank you again
[1:42:46] father for your grace
[1:42:48] always for your mercy and for everything
[1:42:50] you're doing for us and your lord father
[1:42:53] lord you have spoken the word of truth
[1:42:55] to us tonight lord father
[1:42:57] ministering through your servant lord
[1:42:59] father you want us to climb to this high
[1:43:02] calling lord
[1:43:03] where the responsibility is put upon a
[1:43:06] mature brother
[1:43:07] a mature woman that can speak the word
[1:43:10] because she's going to be the final
[1:43:12] voice to the final age lord
[1:43:15] father your prophet told us that if we
[1:43:17] don't have faith for it too fake
[1:43:19] how can we expect to go in the rupture
[1:43:21] lord if the little things that are here
[1:43:24] we are so caught up to it we accepted
[1:43:26] them
[1:43:27] we see them normal and we cope we
[1:43:30] condone
[1:43:30] to live with them lord as it was normal
[1:43:34] because it's the trend of the actual
[1:43:36] world lord
[1:43:37] father but you are calling us to
[1:43:39] something higher
[1:43:40] something different lord where we are
[1:43:42] depending on the wings of
[1:43:44] jehovah like roof was depending on the
[1:43:47] wings of the lord
[1:43:49] father where we need to serve serve you
[1:43:52] lord in the power of resurrection lord
[1:43:56] father you spoke about mark 16 you spoke
[1:43:59] about the nine gift of the spirit here

[1:44:02] father you know your prophet told us
[1:44:04] also
[1:44:05] that if this branch this tree give a new

[1:44:11] written on

[1:44:15] repeated
[1:44:16] offer and overlord but it's time for
[1:44:18] those code to become
[1:44:20] flesh because one day your word
[1:44:23] was in a paper but it was another day

[1:44:28] flesh in the life of mary and he brought
[1:44:31] that
[1:44:31] fourth lord father's son by the name of

[1:44:53] that for once more
[1:44:54] in this church lord father we can
[1:44:56] manifest it
[1:44:57] and do the work of god lord because you
[1:45:00] have appointed us
[1:45:01] you have predestinated us lord unto good
[1:45:04] works lord
[1:45:05] father those words are not our work lord
[1:45:08] but it's your work that you have
[1:45:10] predestinated
[1:45:11] your bread to walk into it lord may our
[1:45:14] confidence our revelation

[1:46:10] on this church father we rebuke it to
[1:46:12] the dry places

[1:46:16] the wall of fire

[1:46:20] that are sick and battling
