more time to praise him man [Laughter] i'll just give the time to uh special singers and we have some testimonies and praise report amen so can we see that they met amen and we call our brother charles a man to um i believe um there's a praise report before our brother comes up he said we would like to wish our son charles harperton the third a happy 18th birthday amen amen brother charles happy birthday to you amen may the lord jesus christ continue to keep guide lead and direct you love that mom siblings amen said i would like and from the church amen and i would like to give a testimony about my finger from sister kayla hamilton amen amen um so we'll ask our sister to come up to give a testimony i also have a testimony then after the testimony we asked our brother charles that's the third dad god bless um about three weeks ago i was getting up five o'clock in the morning cutting an onion and on a vegetable slicer the guard was up on three and i came down and sliced my hand i sliced it all the way down to the bone the nerve and the tendon my husband we provided me he cleaned it up the best way we could i worked a full day got off went straight to emergency i sat there for three hours and the doctor said well he said the tendon's not severed the nerve is not severed it came close to the bone but everything's okay i'm sorry there's nothing i can do i said okay so they put neosporin on and for some reason that burned really bad i got home and got that off and we put vitamin e on it and we prayed about it the doctor said you may take months for it to heal and then after that a plastic surgeon i said no lord i'm not believing that my son looked at my finger and he said the next morning we pray every morning before we leave and he said lord you touch my mom's hand and i've been trying to give this testimony for the last two weeks and the lord's been telling me to wait to wait to wait okay lord last week my husband said you're almost out of band-aids i said okay i said well when i'm done i'll use these other band-aids so i ran out of band-aids i believe it was tuesday and i looked at my finger and he said baby out of band-aids i said i forgot to pick some up wow i put his band-aids on him from work which allowed i guess the air to get to it went to sleep woke up the next day went to change it and i began running through the house i said babe it's healed i said my skin is growing back it completely covered over in three weeks i can clap i can move my hand i can type at work so i just want to give god glory for that [Applause] amen and amen amen bless the lord for that finger amen amen i also have a testimony man i wanted to give that uh this this one on wednesday but because of time i decided to push it today amen it meant so um what happened was that i fell into the hands of this kind of hackers that we hacked into our school system and got access to our student account and so the did this um advertising of jobs like work from home so because it was coming from the school i thought was coming from the school so i thought it was legitimate so i decided to follow up on it and then um they they engaged me for like three to four days were having chats and stuff like that they asked for my details and stuff like that but i didn't give out the thank god in the ask for social security and all that stuff because that was really private amen so um what happened was that i i had to open a different account because i didn't use i didn't want to use the account that we're using a different bank account so when i went to open the bank account we're still having this chat with this guy who introduced himself as whatever his name was whatever company he was working with and i thought was legitimate so i was following up with him and then what happened was that they they said that uh their company do this kind of donations to foster homes so what you're going to do as part of your job is to [Music] manage his account and then do the donation on his behalf to those foster homes so so he's going to transfer money to me every every week and then i'm going to do those donations to those foster homes saturday was legitimate right so um um he wanted to uh see how trustworthy i was so let me just send um any amount that i think i can send to him so he sees that uh i'm really genuine because there's a number of people who he engaged with and they didn't turn out to be good people and i said i'm i'm good i mean you can trust me so [Laughter] so then i he sent me a site a link to to buy a gift card to some foster home that's what he claimed um nothing um clicked in my mind that this thing wasn't right so i i tried to prove to this guy that i was not i was genuine so i transferred the money he gave me the link and and for some reason my bank started up giving alert that there was something wrong with this but i thought it was genuine so i went on and gave the go-ahead to the bank for uh for the deduction for my account but then what happened was that their uh website um sent me a message what happened was that the the lord made me to make an error in purchasing the gift so the guy said that the gift that i bought wasn't the right one so he asked me that okay um try and do it again try and resend it so that the next day he's going to refund me um the money so i decided to go back to the website and purchase the gift again but then the website told me that i shouldn't use the first card that i used so i was like okay what's wrong with that card so i decided to call my bank and we tried to resolve that issue and the bank said there's nothing wrong with it uh with a card i can go ahead and do that so once i was engaging with a bank a second guy sent me a text message so i was like okay the first guy has already told me that he was going to link me to his supervisor so i thought this guy was a supervisor so i was engaging with this guy and then he was like okay what's going on what did you buy what gave it looks like he didn't know exactly what i did initially so i said okay wait a minute do you know this guy the the first guy that i was talking i was chatting with so he said he told me that do not send any text to any other person so i was like okay if you guys are working together why are you asking me not to to reply to any other person and then once that was going on the other guy the first guy sent me a text so i asked him okay so who do i take orders from do i take it from you or the next guy and then this guy said okay i'll be careful of this fraud guys and all this and i was like okay i can see you guys i spam and then i sent messages to both of them i said i know you guys are fraught this but i'll definitely i'm going to track you guys and then so what happened was that you know uh my bank had already deducted that amount so and the reason why i'm giving this testimony is because of two things i wanted to speak on that money i wanted to speak on that money and i believe that whatever i spoke was going to take effect but then but then this voice dropped and said remember the prophet went like uh when like um he got his items so um his thing stolen and he was like he said a prayer and said lord i believe these people needed it more than i do i don't know if you remember that so that dropped in my heart that remember the prophet so i decided to keep mute so that the following day um i sent a text to our uh a chat a platform and wanted to give a testimony on wednesday because of the voice that came to me and and asked me not to do what i wanted to do so then i decided to call my bank and tell them that what happened was a fraud transaction so if they can put an outlet on that if they um they see any website trying to do the same thing let them know it is fraught so when i called the bank they were like okay we can't see anything on your account i'm like okay previously you have done a deduction but they said they can't find any trace of any um transaction in my account so everything was wiped off there was no trace of any deduction in the account the account stayed intact and i want to give glory to the lord for amen all right so we have um a prayer request from my brother joseph said i need a church to pray sorry he said i need a church to pray for my brother joseph he is an icu with a condition where his immune system is attacking his muscles they had to put him in an induced induce coma pray to god to heal him and restore him back to his family he has always been a good big brother to me looking out for my well-being we still serve a god that's in the healing business amen may his name be forever praised sister priscilla amen so can we have a brother charles pray for um all the prayer requests

talking if you saw me in the hospital you will think that what is happening and here i am so just to give you a testimony that the devil is fighting and on the same time brother abraham's son back home got sick and he prayed and he felt better so it's like the devil fighting left and right and say okay i understand you don't fight for nothing when you fight they got to be a blessing somewhere [Laughter] amen so get ready there should be a blessing somewhere amen brother kelly said no no no there is a blessing coming up on sunday that's why he's fighting so get ready do not miss your blessing so you ready for your blessing are you ready for your blessing you want to get it this morning so let's stand and call brother abraham [Music] hallelujah lord i believe [Applause] lord i believe all things [Music] i believe lord i believe yes lord [Music] [Music] hallelujah i believe it's a wonderful time being in the princess of the lord i just want to salute your friends in the name of the lord jesus christ and maybe you may be seated for a minute so glad to be here and it has been a wonderful time for me you know you can't imagine we're meeting for the first time but of course we met in internet before we came to [Applause] so it was special and i've been treated like a king i think they have confirmed that i'm a king yeah so i thank god that [Music] i made it here by god disgrace successfully and it was not easy certainly we'll always keep fighting but i always believe that anything you know if you have a ministry or a life that does not arouse the wrath of the devil then there is something wrong somehow so but if you have got that pill of fire that that hand of god following you certainly the devil will have to be desperate so there was some delays at the airport in michigan i mean detroit as i was trying to come here they came up with something like well the car that paid for your ticket has got issues this some fraud a lot on it so so i had to miss the plane the flight that i was come with and i was booked on the next one because brother chad had to drive all the way from lima to dayton to put that right they wanted to look at the cart to prove that i had not bought the ticket by fraud something that happened for the first time you know and then as i came here you know you've heard the story of what happened but i knew that the devil will always try to do something not because i am special but because i'm representing the special one and all of you are special that's why i think the brother was hit but somehow i got the warning that something is going on so i couldn't also sleep so i was awake praying then it's like god didn't want to show me what it is but i kept praying and when he rang me at eight i mean three a.m i said this is it so but i i know that god has always brought those things under control so i bring greetings to you from uganda from my family and the church the saints they sent it their greetings have been a while in the u.s so far and this is my first time to be here and i thank god i had a precious time with the sisters and the brothers brother michael omachi sometimes something like that at our at their home it was wonderful and yesterday was the pastor's home wonderful time you can't help but fall in love with these people they're they're they're so special amen so we were just laughing and chatting as if we have known one another for a long time before you know something clicks when you when when they elect meet you don't need a lot of introduction and some carefully whatever the cv that which is in euclix and because it's now time for the fellowship of the attributes of god so when you are an attribute of god definitely you can't help it but when you meet a child of god something will click so i think i i found a very nice welcoming atmosphere when i met brother stephen and the saints so far and i you know when i heard you people singing i said come on this is home now [Applause] i i i was always you know dashing out i was almost dashing out of my room to come and join [Laughter] yeah so i mean i i'm not really a good preacher i'm as some of you have already seen me i'm not a teacher i'm just i try preaching the word i leave the teaching to the pastors i just try to preach plain gospel to encourage the blood of christ around the world and that to me suffices so i would just request that we all stand up and have a word of prayer as we prepare to read the word let's pray loving heavenly father i want to thank you for such a day such a time that you've lord arranged and ordained that we would meet here with your children you are never surprised and you always know all about us whatever we go through whatever lord we are forcing in our lives there is no better blessing that you can bless us with than the blessing of your princes and i'm praying that god that ultimate prince's blessing will come upon us now and lord you are the only one who knows your children is needs and what they have gone through and what they are going through and what is a coming and lord is only you by your spirit that can lift up a standard against the enemy and lord we are not scared of the enemy because we don't live by the mercy of the enemy we live by the grace of god and we are praying that god will come in our midst and even anoint your servant and speak through these lips of clay that which you've ordained lord to edify to encourage and strengthen your children and even bless the reading of your word in jesus name we pray amen you're just trying to pick some scripture here in the book of in the book of genesis i think we shall pick genesis chapter three and um i want to read from verse six you know preachers these days don't preach different things we preach the same thing because the same spirit everywhere so don't be surprised if i come here and preach what has just been preached because it is the same spirit everywhere so genesis chapter 3 from verse 6. and he says and when the woman saw that a tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the foot of the roof and did it and gave also and her husband with her and he did it and the eyes of both of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sued fig leaves together and made them aprons made themselves a promise they had the voice of the lord god walking in a garden now i want you to look at that the voice is walking the voice of god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife heeded themselves from the princes of the lord the lord god amongst the trees of the garden and the lord god called and read them and said unto him where at la and he said i had the voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hated myself and he said who which other voice which other person who told thee that thou art or washed naked has thou eaten of the tree wherefore commanded thee that thou should does not eat and the man said the woman whom thou gave is to be with me she gave me of the tree and i did it and the lord god said unto the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat may god bless his word and bless you you may be seated i know a lot of this has been preached for a long time i'm not going to tackle the working voice but you know of course the bride will be the walking voice today and today we are not going to run away from it because we are eat we are not going to hide from the walking voice the walking voice is now in the bride because she will be the final voice to the final age a people under their prophet and that they are messengers and i'm glad that you still are under [Music] the lord blessed be the name of the lord and the devil doesn't want you to be under. but you see i was sharing with the saints the other day that you only have authority when you are under authority when you cut yourself from being under authority you lose authority so when we continue to be under the authority of the voice we become the voice and then our voice is not just a voice of a man or a man who believes in god but is the voice of god walking in a church blessed be the name of the lord and um i was thinking about one scripture as i was coming here i think the second corinthians chapter 14 verse 8 he says for we can do nothing against the truth but for the truth [Music] we are handicapped when it comes to doing anything against the truth that is the elect that is the believer that is the manifested son or daughter of god you will never be able to do anything against the truth try it you will fail because you don't have the wherewithal what it takes to fight the truth because you are the truth fighting the truth will be fighting yourself which is impossible blessed be the name of the lord so today i want us to go to something about adam who heard from god about what god wants to be done and not to be done and this is the same man who had that before the woman was married because when you come in in genesis chapter 2 i think in verse 15 he says and the lord god took the man not a man the man [Music] and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and keep it and the lord god commanded the man saying of everything regarded thou means freely it but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shall not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shall surely die then after he had revealed and you know what he once done to the man then he brings the idea of a woman in verse 18 and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone i'll make him and help meet for him that comes after so we know that adam knew god's will before the woman was made and therefore the woman which is the type of the church was to come after the man of course adam represented the christ but not in the failure [Music] now something is here which is you know very weird because he knew the will of god before the woman is made and eventually god says for your sake just that you should have fellowship it's not good for the man to be alone he doesn't say it's not good for a man because there are some men who can be alone and they are comfortable with it but not the man because the man was created in the image of god and god is expressing what he is he knows that i'm also not comfortable being alone i will also get a bride for myself one day and that's why he says let us make man in our image and the name elohim comes in the plural it is presented as plural although it's singular why who is the letters the other part of him was also with him his wife was also in him in the attribute form and before she will be manifested so the man was created as a reflection of letters and the word that was given the man was given for both the man and and the woman that is him because this man was created in the image of god and now let's look it let me just go back a little bit in genesis chapter 1 let's go verse 326 and god said let us make man in our image who is the hour that is written to blind in the trinitarians but they are not free but you know who is the hour when you look at the man that he has created in his image let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them now this man is at them let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the falls of the air and over cattle and over all the earth and over all ever creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth now listen verse 27 is so good not good not today so god created a man in his not in there but it is letters but the ass is his so god created a man in his own image in the image of god created he him but male and female created he them glory be to god now that is telling us who god is because this man was created in the image of god and this man is a man but he's both male and female in the spirit so as long as they are in the spirit they are always agreeing there is no problem when adam was just a man one but when god takes a rebound of adam and he makes a physical woman now here comes a chance for the devil to bring a double idea so that this man who was originally one in the reflection of god and god is the word is beginning to have two opinions about a word and that's why the devil brings this issue to the woman and says has god said now listen he jumps the pastor he jumps this man and he knows everything that adam was telling the woman was from god and his right has god's side creating some reason some doubt so they begin to have a double opinion and that's where the whole problem is and that's what saturn is doing when we moved from the mind of god from being just attributes and we were expressed here we are just supposed to still remain in the same mind of god same intention same purpose same vision same will of god but when we come here saturn is always attempting to create another idea about a word now i'm talking about recognizing the ministry's ultimate person and voice of influence who is that ultimate person what is that final person what is that voice that we should be influenced and the adam is telling god that the woman that you give me [Music] she has convinced me away from your word the woman that you gave me how dare you adam tell god that i gave you the word before i gave you the woman i gave you the word before i gave you the church i gave you the word before i gave you children and now you cannot send the children that you gave me they are the ones who are making me break your word or the church that you gave me is the one making me fail all the pastor that you give me is the one making me to fail you are a predestination you were in the mind of god you were part of god so what excuse are you going to give me [Music] man living in the shadows of excuses but god pointing you back in the beginning was the word not the church beginning was the word not your family in the beginning was the word not your friends in the beginning was the word not your deacons in the beginning was the word not your pastor in the beginning was the word not your husband what did you hear [Music] glory be to god i i always say i wish i'm a good preacher i wish i was then i would start preaching now so the devil brings people with ideas ideas in the families ideas and friends ideas nepal's and the purpose is to take you away from the world so that you tell god it was so and so and yet we are here to have nothing against the word but only for the word because the word preceded everything else and the word will outlive anything else so the ministry's person you know of influence now the prophet comes here and he's talking about influence of course you know he preached the message of influence and here he says you know there is so many of us and most of us influence somebody [Music] by the things that we do the way we live and the things we say we influence somebody somebody is watching your life now he doesn't say we influence believers so you have no excuse here somebody somebody's watching your life and then when we profess to be christians what type of life should we live if somebody is watching us and your life that you live will reflect an influence on somebody their internal destination will rest upon the way that you live and the things that you do for they watch you they watch you but you don't watch them they watch you but you don't watch them you are the light for them but they are not the light for you you are the reflection of god truth to them but they have no truth to show you the truth that is in you sets them free because they set you free now we influence somebody that's right but if a true child of god is being influenced by a man or a believer or a christian that gets to become wrong and i'm going to prove that so that's why we should not struggle to say i am like brother sons at least i treat you well better than brother son so treats his wife at least i am a better christian than so and so at least our pastor is better than at least my family is better than life you had to be like jesus to be like jesus to be like jesus that's what i long on earth that's all my journey is about that's what you are here for to be like him to reflect him to show his glory to stand for his word to look at him that is the person of influence and then he says now we see usia he was a great man and we find out that because that he took those terrific stands that he took terrific because if you go back and look at the life and testimony of mosiah he made a radical stance not to cut off himself from anything that was contrary to the word and as long as he did that he was very prosperous very strong very rich very famous until the prophet says terrific styles that he did that you know his kingdom was next to that of solomon josiah powerful he spread out even all the countries around about love him and he paid a tribute to his kingdom and we find out that even went down in egypt his influence was felt even in the world and this being the way he stood and this young prophet standing there before the king it was a great influence to isaiah so isaiah was influenced by a king because this king is righteous has made radical decisions to defend the truth and to live right and he thought i can pick my influence from this man and there are people in this world who can make radical decisions who can stand this you know in a way that you can think if i can only make it like that man if i can only stand like that sister [Music] that could be right but don't make your fixation of you know focus on that person and you think that person should be your ultimate person of influence that is still wrong [Music] that's why you see the prophet says every true preacher will never point you to himself but will point you to jesus to the finished work of calvary because i know i am a man i can fail but he will never fail i can fall rice for rice but he'll never fall rice full of rice he stays the same so now when we come to such a time our fixation is on one man what that is what does he say what does he say about me what is his word telling me so isaiah followed this man thinking he was right but god had to do something to take away isaiah from deriving his influence from a man [Music] and then he says it was great influence myself however the god would bless any man that would be true to his word this is very right god can bless any man that would be true to his word he says regardless of what he's hispanic his politics tried to influence him to regardless of what anything else tried to improve to be usia was determined to stay with the word and god blessed him and isaiah saw it but what does the bible say in isaiah chapter 6 verse 1 in the year that king uzziah died [Music] i saw the lord [Music] so there has to be a time that the shadows of man die away the shadows of man is influenced do you know why even brother ranam was taken away [Music] so that we are not influenced by brother abraham the man but jesus whom we introduced the words the reality that he showed us glory to god so they're going away brother branham doesn't make the church weaker it makes the church stronger glory to god and the falling out of many men in the world today doesn't make the bride weaker it makes the bride stronger the children of god become stronger because our influence [Music] we push aside everything we look beyond man we look at the word we look at the reality that was revealed to us in this day jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever that's where we are standing glory to god so if it's about time that if you are looking at a sudden brother a saturday sister a certain pastor a saturday evangelist and you are trying to pick influence from him it's about time that that shadow dies out of your life so when that shadow dies [Music] you begin to see the lord now listen when isaiah was under the influence of uzziah he never could see that he had any clean lips because he had a body a bell a pile we grew up together we grew in the message we know one another i loved our brother i loved our sister the pastor we believed with him in the same year we grew up together i know him beyond the curtain beyond that level when you see beyond the isaiah when you see beyond a guru brother when you see beyond a guru sister when you see beyond a spiritual man and you see jesus christ himself you'll begin to see that you are undone and that's why sometimes god permits certain things to happen glory to god and you know all over the world they are happening all over the world key men key women that we had you know in his team looking at if that brother can make it i try to make make my life like him i i'll make it and then you find out what is happening what is happening lord what is happening lord that's not your end that is your beginning that's not the time to give up that's the time to pressure that's not the time to say lord i'm frustrated that's the time to say lord i get the revelation now i see now i see where i'm supposed to anchor my faith is supposed to be anchored in the world and calling me jesus standing on the words that will never fail and we thank god for maracai for we thank god for the message we thank god for the restorative truth we had god's own voice we heard god his own voice in the days of the voice in the days of the voice and we are not going to run away from the voice we are going to go until we become the voice in the days of the voice why why did the adam ride running to hide why did the adam hide because she he lived under the influence of his wife my wife influenced me i thought she is also a good preacher i thought she also is a good speaker i thought she also believed you like i believe i thought she got an alternative revelation i thought maybe things have changed somewhere my wife influenced me so when somebody influences you when god comes down you run away but when god is your influence when he comes down you run to him glory to god hallelujah and now it's not the voice of god walking in the garden it's the voice of god walking in the bride and we are the one walking with him he in us he in us the hope of glory the assurance of glory [Music] glory to god so you see that's where the devil wants to bog us down from and brother sister let me talk to you don't be that human not your husband i mean he is not supposed to refer to you as the cause of his failure but you should not also act in a way that his weakness can peg his life on that [Music] lord i want to serve you lord i want to worship you i want your atmosphere in my house back to my wife lord i want a prayer life i want to study the word but my wife is not interested lord how i want to be spiritual i want that atmosphere that is in the church to come home but my husband is not a true leader he is not interested my husband is just a church member my husband is just interested in playing tithe and singing songs and going to church and appearing christian but he's not a christian why should you be that man why should you be that human although although he's not supposed to use like you are like an excuse but why should your life be an excuse why should your life be an excuse lord you know i respect you word but no matter how i try to talk to my wife this is not according to the word dress according to the word i have tried to buy her decent clothes but she's interested she's become a problem to me lord you gave me your husband is a choosing you to god your wife is accusing you to god that is not a healthy position you are pastor i choosing you to god lord i'm trying to preach the best that you give me you know you gave me this message you placed it on my heart you showed me what to tell them but look at them they are they are not receiving it they are not accepting they they are looking at me with indifference skepticism you know they i i'm i'm lord i'm just a victim i i'm not a culprit you said to me you gave me to preach this but the people are looking at me like do i do lord the church that you give me the church that you gave me lord i'm not the one who gave myself the church you gave me the church but now the church has become a problem would you be like you want to be such a church a church that becomes a problem to the ministry do you want to be such a pastor a pastor that becomes a problem to the church [Music] oh god we would be rejoicing we were okay we were in peace we were pressing on but the pastor that you gave us became a problem brought something else he left the channel what's this glory be to god and i want to thank god that some of you people are standing because you looked beyond a man you looked beyond a church you looked beyond ideas and you stuck with the what say come what mace i know what i've got is this truth i will never leave it i'm more than persuaded that nothing shall separate me from this let me separate with every man separated with every woman separated with friends separate with all that who would love me but let me stand with the word because i heard from heaven i heard from heaven i didn't hear from a man so all the osiris come out of the shadow god is now telling us reminding us all over the world come out of uzia's shadows if you remain under the shadow of usaid when usaiah collapses you will collapse and when usia is still the source of your influence you will never be perfected [Music] it is only when uzziah dies out of your life and you begin to see god and then what happens when you see god you see you are weaknesses [Music] you see you are unclean rips and you cry out to god say lord have mercy upon me all along i thought i was okay but now my eyes have seen i have been hearing about you through another person but now my eyes see you blessed be the name of the lord so here we are isaiah the isaiah the younger prophet lived under the shadow of the great spiritual rich and evidently successful man and the prophet goes on to say usaid was also influenced by his right as parents righteous and good fearing parents so it was like a continuation but isaiah was later proven wrong for basing his trust on a man and what does the bible say in jeremiah chapter 17 cast be the man that puts his trust let me tell you friends we have come to a time that i don't even trust myself [Applause] i don't even trust myself without god in me i'm nothing i'm a failure don't even say brother abraham pray for me to have more faith the best faith that a man ever had is a failure but the bible says it's now the faith of god the faith of jesus christ in eu that's what the prophet says the best faith a man ever had was a failure the prophet says it's not you who is the believers christ in you is the believer it's the holy spirit in you and then he even says in another place he says when you receive the person of the holy spirit you already have all that you need between now and glory and you don't need faith you already got faith all that you need is how to operate that faith [Applause] glory to god just operate it you need to get an operational manual from the one resident in you blessed the church the wife the friends the children the husband you gave me they have convinced me to break your word the prophet says the first ones failed but this one will not fail and we have a predestination guarantee on this one that's why i i cannot you know i'm not afraid i'm not scared no matter what will come blessed be the name of the lord let me continue a little bit here and he says now that that is that's what made him such a great example to this young prophet at the same time isaiah isaiah the prophet lived in the days of uzziah king and both of them being young together bodies the prophet and the king and they were great charms together and isaiah stayed at the palace he leaned upon the arm of the king and and we find out that this young fellow's influence influenced isaiah he become a hero to isaiah because he was he made no differences in the people he never let anything sway him from one side to the other he was determined to serve god and serve god alone look at the description of usaiah but time came that he wanted to take an office that is not his. and that became his downfall and this is what i'm always praying lord let me never at all reach to a time that i feel so secure so strong so capable of tackling or touching that which is beyond me [Music] one brother was asking me brother abraham i think i was in kenya he said what is your view about this and that and that and the prophet saying this and this i said i'm not here to give anybody my views we are not in the days of views that when you talk about views that is reasoning [Applause] [Music] i said i have no view i just have a revelation and christ in you is the center of revelation i cannot share revelation with you it is him to reveal himself to you you tell ask him god reveal this to me not looking for my view i'm not here to share views the message according to brother so and so the message according to pastor son so the message according to this message according to that not the message being channeled through our filters again no but it means just like he took him glory be to god you see so he says you know he comes there is only one way to be a christian one way the word christian means to be christ-like and you can't do it in your own way you can't work it in yourself there is no way at all you can do it you have to forget yourself forget about yourself your interests your feelings your your likes and dislikes and this die out to yourself and let christ come in and live the life of christ in you that is the only way of being a christian forget about yourself forget about your likes and dislikes your ideas the way i see it brother [Music] and when you forget about your friends i mean yourself you'll forget about the usayas [Music] so he says and a man don't have to walk up nothing if he's a christian he is because he is in other words he's a christian because he is he that's what he's made up of he's a christian by nature that is supernatural that's not the signature that you're born with an apple tree is an apple tree because it is an apple [Laughter] i'm a christian because i'm a christian and because christ lives with me that is all so he says a peachy tree is a peachy tree because it's a peachy tree and a christian is a christian because christ lives in that person and christian makes i mean makes christ like not a membership but a vindication [Music] god producing through you just what a christian is not you getting out not i mean it's you getting out of the way and letting god come in you taking no thoughts let the mind that was in christ be in you there you are that's the real christian not when you see the trees good for food looks nice sounds good oh sounds good brother makes sense i see some sense [Music] we are not living by common sense i'm not i i'm not common [Music] common sense is for the common people i am not a common person i'm a person of revelation i'm a special person a royal priesthood a holy people a special people so leave common sense before the common [Music] i read by revelation common sense many even the disciples do not understand that john the baptist was elijah why say the eli the scribes that a liar is supposed to first come who was asking the believers of jesus they were going by the winds of common sense that were blowing around this is no time for messiah because the messiah cannot come without elijah coming and they were trying to challenge the disciples and the disciples bring it to jesus we are coming with common sense why should these people say they say they say that elijah must first come before messiah comes that is the wind of common sense it's blowing around what do you say about it elijah shall truly first come and restore all things but i say unto you that he has already come and they did to him whatever they witnessed [Music] common sense in john chapter one will tell you that john the baptist is not the prophet who are you are you that the prophet nope are you elijah no are you that jeremiah no but who are you i'm just a voice so common sense verbatim john is saying i'm not a prophet so i have a quote i have a quote john says i'm not a prophet who are you going to tell me that is a prophet and then jesus comes and says if you are to receive it if you among those who have packages to receive the revelation this is that elijah who wants to come so john pointed you to me and i am the one to reveal to you to confirm that he is so because you have not received the one that john introduced you don't understand the message of john glory to god but if you had received that's why when they questioned him by what authority do you do these things he didn't answer that question he pointed them back to john says the baptism of john was it of man was it of god now if we say it is of men the people stone us because the people know that john is a prophet but if we say of god he'll say why didn't you believe so we cannot answer aha now what do we say jesus also neither will i also tell you because the answer to your question is in the mystery that john introduced so if he had received the reality that he john introduced you will not have asked him in this question [Music] why because now is the dynamics the reality the horror power of god walking in human flesh and that was introduced by john now and because john was introducing the greatest reality ever to live on earth he never even performed a single miracle not even a single miracle and yet he was the greatest of all prophets that were born of women why because he creates he connected promises prophecies with reality he says he is the man he is the man so don't tell me about brother abraham brother browningham just simply introduced the man and now the man is here and a man with an open book go to the book got the anger and take the book eat the book digest the book you are going to get all that you need and you are going to prophesy again and when you begin to prophesy you are going to understand it that's why he says do you believe me to be god is prophet i i mean god is a servant [Applause] do you believe me to be goddess prophet i mean glory servant he's addressing two groups at the same time they are those who will never receive him as a prophet he is the servant they are those who are receiving him as a prophet some statement answering all of them well it's revealed it's revealed but it's not broken to the public where it's revealed it's not revealed it's revealed it's not revealed why the revealer that i'm introducing will reveal it entirely in you just receive him christ in you the center of revelation when jesus comes into you why is there the sabbath why did god say rest on the sabbath day the answer is not in the sabbath you will not find the sabbath on the seventh i mean the answer in the seventh seal the answer for the servant is seal is in the six scenes why did god rest on the seventh day because he had to finish the work in six days so he's resting that is quiet seven ish why because the mysteries are revealed now hallelujah that's why when abraham was preaching the seals he preaches up to the sixth seal and he opens the floor for questions and answers because all your questions are in these six seams but when he preaches why didn't he finish seven is a series first because seven is a seal no question that is the coming of him in you [Applause] no question answers for the seven is a seal behind the six seals blessed be the name of the lord you just die out you just disappear and he comes into you blessed be the name of the lord and then he says oh my there you are that's the real christian let me continue so you see he's giving her a reason will you be you will you like to be equal with the god that's how he started saturn started so adam gets insults from the woman the woman gets the influence from the serpent so when you begin to see this out for special reasonings coming questions questions that never used to be but coming now it's because saturn wants to put there another source of influence why didn't you people question these questions those days to see us why now why come now with the questions and who is the orchestra who i mean orchestrator who is the author of these questions who began who asked the first question in the bible whatever god he did was good was good was good was perfect and then the devil comes the first question who brings the first questions did the god say [Music] did the did the bible say this what about this and i preached about that i think many years ago i think 2017 in europe i was preaching in britain i i was pre i was titling it satan is demoting promotion versus god is promoting the motion because satan comes like he's promoting you while actually he's demoting you because he says god knows that if you eat you shall be asked as good when actually there were already goods they were already goods not us but they were real gods but saturn says if you eat this you shall be as gods yet they were already gods because the word of god was always coming to them every evening god would come and fellowship with them they were gods so it sounded like a promotion well awarded fine detail tailored statement the devil is a narrator you shall be asked when they were already gods [Music] and then the woman thought i'm going to be promoted [Music] when she was receiving a message of demotion wrapped in the envelope of promotion but for us today we received a message of promotion wrapped in the envelope of demotion you become nothing you don't you become nothing you disappear you die out then when he comes to live that is your promotion oh i wish i was like brother stephen you better come and take over brother stephen and fire up i'm an older man i'm finished glory be to god [Music] so in other words will you like to be equal with the god you want really to be right with god take my advice listen to me god didn't mean that it meant this it didn't mean this i give you to understand i have also just noticed it brother after all these years i've come to notice this meant this it didn't mean this lord oh god it meant this god didn't mean that he says when you hear that when you hear that get away from me through your fast that's right that is the hiss of the serpent it didn't mean this it meant here me in my understanding brother i've now realized this meant this this is wrong this is this shhh that is the heat of the serpent oh that is the heat of this happened it sounds reasonable but don't reason at all just believe the word of god what god said see what it was his reasonings brought her to know that it was right it was true the devil reasoned out of right into what seemed to be right when it's very wrong and this happened it was present to the eye and a tree to be desired and and brother abraham asks the congregation to make one have faith congregation says no to make one have knowledge will make one look wise and you know what is happening the message the way it came apparently for fools although fools they will not error the ring they will not error in the way of holiness so if you are not a fool you are in trouble [Applause] you want to appear smart intelligent reasonable speak like a man who has some education [Music] um okay to make man to make someone look wise at least see what it was saturn presenting knowledge knowledge that was controlled to the word to make one wise so their eyes of both of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sued filled leaves together and made themselves aprons you see this is what is happening when you leave this message you begin to sow some kind of approach [Music] that cannot cover your naked [Laughter] because you know you are naked you know outside there you are naked there's nothing that can cover you no other truth no other denomination no other faith you become completely naked and it cannot help your nakedness but you pretend that you have covered yourself that's why i was telling the brother when you now leave the world you can't even go back successfully to egypt because the children of israel who failed to cross over to the promised land they couldn't even when they said let us make us a captain to go back to egypt it was impossible to go back what you know now makes you naked everywhere you go you you will try to look for something to cover yourself but you still know i'm naked because what covered you comfortably was the word [Music] but you something emanating from your brains from your reasoning [Music] it will never cover you enough says he says made them themselves aprons now what started it reasoning see faith has no reason faith has no reason you don't reason at all you believe when you are prayed before you accept god's word for him for your healing you don't reason with your feelings you don't reason with nothing else there's no reasoning into it god says say this so and that settles it amen i have to leave many things here blessed be the name of the lord amen let's go here somewhere in the scripture when you come to the book of i think exodus chapter 32 i want us to look at something about the people and god exodus chapter 32 and when the people saw that moses delayed to come down out of the mountain the people gathered themselves together and to aaron and say that to him up make us gods which shall go before us for us for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt with what not what has become of him as for this moses moses has become dismissed in a very short time 40 days not even profit [Music] 40 days as for this man moses look at that attitude with all the miracles they saw in egypt the miracles they saw the way the pill of fire the opening of the red sea water coming out of a rock for them look at that unbelief [Music] disrespect as for this moses [Music] they are gathering to the contemporary of moses the man moses's body the associate i was with moses we worked together we were with him in the wilderness i walked with him ask for these moses not even the prophet moses not even pastor moses oh this moses man that brought us up out of the land of egypt made us separate with our denomination the thinking is he having the truth i don't know how he convinced me i wish i knew the faults that i'm seeing now this man moses i don't know what has become of him we don't know and look at the body of moses the contemporary of moses the associate of moses what he's doing and aaron said unto him break off the golden earrings which here in the ears the ears of your wives of your sons okay even sons had earrings [Music] yay okay potential for idol idolatry they were carrying their potentials they were carrying their gods in their ears no wonder they could not hear the word and believe it because their god was in their ears having their eyes their ears seared seared they will never hear they are god's way on their ears so all of them with earrings can imagine men younger men women sure your wives your sons and your daughters bring them here to me and all the people broke off that that obedience comes automatically 100 percent obedience to anything which is not the word of god you see you got it man we have influenced you now you can influence us because we know we are off from the original influence whatever you tell us we are now gonna do it and all the people all broke off the golden earrings which were in their ears and brought them unto aaron and he received them at their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool brother stephen everyone that where he kept the engraving tool all along he had it in his back the signs and wonders and miracles of the prophet are nothing like today they are denying they are not even regarding what god did the vindication that was in the prophet's life is nothing and the people who grew up seeing all these things he has got an engraving tool in his back just in a case i will need it one day one day i'll need it so all along around you have been carrying this the road and speaking miracles and putting miracles and in your bag and god made sure he never revealed to moses that this is a an arrow hiding an engraving tool [Music] that makes idols in his back all along mother thought i'm with a man who fear who believed the word no wonder he came back and broke the tables [Music] god have mercy upon us with him he fashioned it very beautiful according to the fashion according to the trend that the people's test can receive [Music] okay fashioned it with the graving tool after he had made it a mullet cuff he beautified it and they said this be thy god so israel which brought the app out of the land of egypt we have turned our back on the message that brought us out we've got another idea that will pressure take us home impossible [Music] that's manny's idea now look in there when aaron saw it he built an altar before it people to sacrifice and now look at what's going to happen and the aaron made proclamation and said tomorrow is a feast to the lord now that's the two gods religion now two lords i have not completely left the message [Music] there are suddenly things that i still believe certain values i still cherish if you look at my wife she still steals dresses like a message look at my children even me myself so today we can serve the golden calf tomorrow is the feast for the lord so we can alternate i have not completely left the message who told you that i've lifted the message i still serve the lord although we have an altar and then the brother the golden calf is here for those who are interested blessed be the name of the lord and then what happens and when you know in verse 6 and they rose up ally on the morrow this time ah their own family altar very serious sure you know when someone has backslidden he's going to fall asleep he will behave as if he's got the truth and he's very fiery and he's now like he got it you people who remain in there you have nothing [Music] regarded now very early in the morning rosa palin tomorrow and offered battlefronts and brought peace offerings and the people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to play now we are going to see the double a the two tongues of the snake the same serpent that was in the garden of eden let's drop to verse 21. and we see what aaron says when moses comes when he is in the presence of the real source of the message what does he say and moses said unto aaron what did these people do unto thee that thou has brought so great a sin upon them and aaron said let not the hang of my lord works hard thou along with the people that they have certain mischief you know the character of these people they can be so rigged and so demanding and so pressing and so so what could i do you know you know you know you know you know you know verse 23 for they say that to me make us gods which shall go before us from god to gods for us for this moses he is reporting the thing for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we want not what is become of truth of him that is true but now listen where the double tanks come when he's here he's saying this and doing this when he's here he's saying this and doing enough so he says that's 24. and i say that to them whosoever has any gold let them break it off so they gave it to me and then i cast it into the fire and there came out this scarf so the calf created itself he can't now mention that he has got an engraving too i i i never formulated this i never planned this it came upon me oh you threw the gold into the fire and out of the fire came the calf what a teaching now listen verse 25 back to genesis and when moses saw that the people were naked naked because they have been influenced away from the word just like adam and if we're naked when the mother saw that the people were naked for aaron had made them naked into their shame among their enemies naked because they left the world and the people are now seeing moses and trying to hide because they are naked but they were comfortable in the camp of arun until when the voice comes [Music] and the prophet says cause number one killer they say is hearty trouble no i differ from that number one killer isn't they had a trouble number one killer is the scene in trouble sin is unbelief that is the killer not had the trouble and he says for when the spirit of god is in you it lines up with the word of god and if it denies the word of god then it isn't you haven't got the got the right shot yet that's all you are not innoculated sin still lays at the door any belief in the word so it detects the toxin of god to kill sin and sin is number one killer yes it is it gives and it appeals to the uttermost so what are we looking at when you go to somewhere in the days of somewhere you remember saul when he was sent to go and you know kill the americans and he came back and said praise the lord i did everything like you told me and then the prophet is saying but what is this that i'm hearing [Music] says the people [Music] the excuses there's somebody [Music] and aaron is taking the excuse and saying you know the people the people you left with me they are the ones who made me to make a cuff friends should i tell people should i tell god that the church you gave us the believers you brought in the church are the ones that made me change from preaching the truth [Music] so i'm just here to tell you friends that there is approach there is an ambush that the davis coming with but we thank god we have got the assurance that a true bride is not going to be deceived she's not going to be swayed that's where my consolation is glory no matter what happens you may not be popular brother you will become unpopular more unpopular but you rather become unpopular here when heaven knows you look at how aaron is fidgeting with words guilty consciousness he knew better and he could have done better this man moses this man william branham he's no longer a prophet i don't regard him i have found out he's just a man after you've left egypt and you've come all away they're people you know their people they are hardy people they are complicated people they are very very very very very resistant they are hard people which people i had i think we preachers are more responsible for the complications and confusions in the churches we are more responsible for all the doctrinal messages that have gone on misrepresenting the message the message misrepresented mispreached christ misrepresented and then sometimes the people become more complicated [Music] but if we point the people to the real person of influence the ultimate voice until they and him become one and then their voice is not just working in the garden but they are the tabernacle of the body they the temple that is the voice is walking in that is the thunder that shakes the devil that is the thunder that they never cannot stand and as the church that's going to be triumphant blessed be the name of the lord so all along people have been keeping engraving tools at the back side of their mind it was there time will come we shall pick this pick this pick this pick ideas pick ideas what people want to hear what they don't want to hear the feelings of the people and what they want and then we shall make them something a package of the good they want [Music] glory to god may god bless you brother steven keep pressing on man we are here to preach jesus christ to the end the truth to the end and that's why paul says i was not disobedient to the heavenly vision in other words i was ready to disobey every man i was ready to lose every friend but i will never disobey the heavenly voice the heavenly vision what i heard from heaven no and he was testifying before a king or king agrippa i was not disobedient that's why i'm suffering that's why i'm unpopular that's why i'm hated that's why i'm persecuted but i'm not ashamed of it because i heard from heaven i heard it from heaven and that's why there is corruption as one you know moving quickly from him that called you unto the truth to another gospel which is not another they can't there can't be a duplicate of the message but just there are some men that trouble you [Music] trouble here you are trying to focus on going home they are coming with their ideas you are trying to focus on the rupture they are troubling you with that did you did you ever see this quote did you what do you want from me i don't have to look at the intestines of my husband in order to believe that he is a man and then get married to him i don't have to open his chest and see his lungs and see how he breathes does he breathe normally does the blood flow normally i just got in fell in love with him i love him and i know he loves me and i'm comfortable don't tell me about any integrities this and that glory let me finish by this he says [Music] by the same sense six sins god spoke when there was nothing and what is that essence the supersense is god the faith of god in you the faith of god in you not you have faith not the faith of the church the grace of the pastor the faith of the believers the faith of god in you the supersense glory of god supersense of the super rest by the supersede [Applause] glory super sense of the spirits by this person here we are the faith of god in you that part of god that comes into you and gives you dispersants by the same supersense god framed the world together with things which was not and did not appear he spoke his word and he believed his word and the world shook into existence god spoke the word and god believed the word and the world came into existence so today again as it was in the beginning so it is god will speak the word and god will believe his word and what he has spoken will come back to existence your health will be brought back to existence you are victory to existence you are joy to have fixed into existence the annoying things here so you need super sense get out of the reasonings of the five senses you have left the five senses you are in expressions [Music] glory and then he says the sixth sense the superstars oh god pour it out on me give it to me and to anyone who needs it [Music] into me oh lord i am willing to surrender this fight see feel taste smell here my the way i feel brother i felt i felt the way i think no my memory takes me back to this all these ones are off [Music] let the sixth sense this persons of god come lord i'm waiting to surrender this five my own knowledge thoughts casting down all reasonings lord let thy word be true and every other man is worth a lie [Applause] every reasoning every doubt be cast out of my way let me walk by this person's the sense of the holy spirit glory and i love this quote where the prophet says they will love him they love love his and and and he will have his potentials they love his potentials and he will have his potentials for he is their head and they are his subjects subject to the head headship of christ was his now in other words that is the source of their influence the head is the sense of the source of the influence of the whole body and then he says oh not what a harmony jesus never did anything until he sinned of the father this is what we have to see not from english human being never compare these notes with the sanhedrin the pharisees the sadducees the herodians the ethnics the zealots the nazarites no what he saw the father harmony between god and christ so will the bride and he shows her his word of life he shows her and she receives it she never doubts it and for that reason nothing can harm her not even in death you believe in that not even death can harm you for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again amen then i got a great big hallelujah here is the sacred the word is in the bride and the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has thus says the lord that's what she has that is her influence that says the lord and that says the lord comes through a prophet [Music] they do only his will amen i believe that no one can persuade them different doesn't matter what reputation how powerful how rich how influential [Applause] no one can persuade them different they have thus saying the lord oh they keep still and still doesn't just mean quiet but they stand still and see the glory of the lord and invading you shall not need to fight in this battle stand still and see the lord himself coming down the fight they have that say the lord oh they keep still then they will do the works of god for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill as he did complete in his days all things as he was here he did not complete all when he was here for it was not yet time [Music] so that's why what did the elijah commission elijah you shall do three things he did only one the two were done by elijah but it was his commission but when god was commissioning elijah elijah was going to ride the trail again in elisha [Music] and god included elijah in the commission that he gave elijah so that spirit that was in maracai 4 is not brother abraham that is the spirit of jesus christ and he is here to ride this trail once more and the devil cannot stop it saturn will not stop it this bride is going on this church is going on the minister of elisha is going on and the devil is not going to stop it glory be to god do you believe you are the candidate for the elijah ministry you believe that spirit is to be in you and he's here to vindicate that word to prove it may god bless you [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] we are going to pray and if you want to be remembered in this prayer friend what a time what a challenge that we are living in as we bow our heads and close our eyes just think about what happened in eden and you know that's always been the trick of the devil throughout saturn wanting the people to malign and to be little the messenger of the day and even saying this man moses coming up with their own idols and having a hybrid religion where they cannot touch themselves the message but they are not genuine message believers that that should not be your condition brother that should not be your condition sister and never be that person you will say lord i got lost i broke your word i failed to come to perfection because of the wife you gave me because of the husband you gave me because of the children you gave me because of the church you gave me or because of the pastor you gave me that should not be your excuse we should live beyond the level of excuses and say lord i heard from heaven i have no excuse i have heard and i know this is the truth help me lord to be exactly what you want me to be without any excuse because i heard from you [Music] and we are going to pray if you want to be remembered in prayer just lift up your hand lord jesus in the name of jesus christ what a day we are living what a time we are seeing these things lord how these spirits are getting manifested before us and there is a challenge to the ministry the message being maligned belittled abused by scientific minds reasoning [Music] lord we are here have mercy upon us help us that we shall live by the supersense the sixth sense the sense of faith and faith is a revelation to know that lord is you to reveal unto us what we are supposed to be and never never never should we give the enemy room to sow the seeds of discrepancy lord that while men slept [Music] should not happen again may we always be on our god watchful may we not be among those who slept and the enemy would come and sow seeds of discreet person lord follow this word in our hearts may it build us unto what you want us to be for we know we are in the very rapture season the rupture which has already begun the process of it we are in it help us know that every bit of what's required to be in us lord will be in us and anything that is not supposed to be in us should not be in us like you say through yourself and a prophet what is death death is anything which is not the word of god and what's life life is the word so help us lord to have the fullness of the life by the fullness of the word embodied in us bless this church lord bless the pastor here and the deacons and trustees and the preachers all the godliness men and women who are standing here give them the grace lord that will always press on knowing that we have a few more days to live and wait one of these days we shall go home father keep them protect them safe in the world by the blood surround them let your pure fire hover over them and those that are sick afflicted tormented will you not come down kindly and touch them and deliver them and set them free i know that god you are here and you have always proven your word we don't serve a god that we keep defending that he exists we serve a god that comes down that always reveals himself and vindicates his word may you come down and prove your presence in us we surrender to your perfect will in the most holy and matched name of our lord jesus christ we pray amen [Music] hallelujah hallelujah i don't know whether i should hand over to the pastor but uh i had i got that there are some people who wanted to be prayed for i can try to pray together with them amen so as we sing a chorus sweep [Music] sweet [Music] do [Music] first is [Music] my [Music] my soul [Music] sweet spirits [Music] my soul [Music] sweep over my [Music] [Music] [Music] oh sweet [Music] sweet

give the lord a clap of him hallelujah what a wonderful message this morning amen blessed be the name of the lord after the death of king uzziah it's not to devastate you amen it is just god moving the era of man assad so that you personally as an individual you can see him amen and when you begin to see him then you begin to see your imperfection you begin to see your weakness then there is a brazen altar that is open that's going to lead you into the tabernacle amen so everything is under god control there is nothing other cater amen amen blessed be the name of the lord so it's time to stop excuses to stop blaming others and say i'm this way because of this i'm this way because of this one but it's time for you to move as an individual and don't let anybody hinder your walk with jesus christ amen i know people who cannot make it to church because of the wives i know wives that cannot be in church because of their husband the husband so poked stuff in their mind until they believing with their husband and they can't make it to church months after month because the wife did this and they cannot be to church but do not be that person amen your stand in the world will be there to save your husband or your wife because of the stand you take for the world amen don't be like those on the air on where the wives break the earring the children breaking the earring the sun's breaking their earring daughter is breaking the in other words the entire family is departing from the faith amen but this is a personal individual if your husband want to go that's him when it comes to the word of god it's a different story brother branham even say that when your husband tell you to do something that is contrary to the word of god you're not supposed to listen to him because in the beginning was the word so your husband cannot tell you do not go to church and you say no i'm gonna be in submission i won't go to church that's a different story now now that is beyond human your husband cannot tell you go kill somebody and you have to obey and kill somebody you cannot do that amen if you want to go to hell you go to hell yourself amen but somebody will answer before god amen so do not do that don't take any excuses for anybody amen how many understood the seventh today and the rest and the seventh cell did you get a pretty good so you don't need to meet you don't need me to help you right i thought you told me you know amen amen did you get what he said he said the answer to the seven days was in the other six days did you answer did you get what he means you're not saying anything did you get what it means that the answer to the seventh day was in the other sixth day [Laughter] oh blessed be the name of the lord somebody saying praise god i was wondering about it amen on the first day did god do work yes he did amen he created the light right on the second day he did work right on the third day he did work right on the fourth day he did work right on the fifth day he did work right on the sixth day he did work what did he do on the sixth day on the first day he he commanded he created the light does that light look like god on the second hallelujah i'm not preaching you want to go home eat on the second day third day he created the trees he created the sun he created the animal did god look like an animal he created the bird did god look like a burden he created the fishes and the dolphin and uh and the shark does a shark look like god but on the sixth day he created something that looked exactly like him because they created man in his own image and in his own likeness so if you don't know how god is look at me amen when you see god god is a human being he looks like man one day moses asked a question and moses said i talked to this fire for a long time and this fire is talking like a human being it is not talking like an animal because animals do not talk except if the lord opened a way for an animal to talk like belem but animals don't talk they talk in cartoons everybody okay so far everybody okay animal don't talk amen and moses said lord at least let me see who's talking when he showed moses he was like the back of all a donkey an elephant in the back of water because man was created in the image and in the likeness of in other words when god created man in the sixth day that was the top that was the summit that was the climax that was the highest level that's why god could rest because somebody looked like him he can take the earth and give it to man so that man can lead the earth because man was a complete reflection of god anybody here so on the seventh day if this is the top what else do you do on the seventh day so what do you have to do so the answer to rest is what because of the labels that happen in the other six day so when you go to the seventh day it's silence you say seven days what happened in your day nothing what happened in your day god rested what does it mean god rested god rested because he was working anybody here so to understand the seventh day the seventh day tells you that there was work before me so it's the seventh day that i have the answer to the other six days if god never rested you would never understand he was working so you need to go to the rest to understand the working you need to go to the that's why when they open the seventh seal quiet because on the first year he unfolded things the second seal he unfolded thing the third seals he unfolded him the fourth seal he unfolded the fifth seal he unfolded when he reached the seventh year he unfolded even the trumpets [Applause] and when you finish you got to question and answer because he already finished everything anybody okay anybody okay that's why when brother branham wanted to preach the trumpet god said no no no no no go in the six cell you already preached the trumpet so when you look at the sick seal it looks like it doesn't help trump and the trumpeter there i'm gonna help you up i know somebody still struggling i know brother branham said the way the scroll was written now you're gonna understand amen they take one and they roll it this way and the ceiling and the the one they seal the roll the second one on top of it and the seal and then they roll the third one on top and the seal so let's start number one is rolled is sealed number two is rolled it's healed number three is rolled it's here number four is raw it's water number five number six and number seven is sale right so how can you read number one if seven is locking everything [Applause] in your okay now you cannot read number one number two number three number four number seven because they all are wrapped up in the seven so when you break the seventh one everybody okay so once you break the seventh here he automatically open the seat up and the fifth up in the fourth all the way the whole book is now any question in other words you need to go back to this message and listen more [Laughter] amen you need to go back to the message and listen more and you're going to see there's more stuff that was spoken there but it's so deep i'm trying to help you get the package so you can go home israel left egypt which is the world and they went into the wilderness in the middle amen then it's the promised land the people that left moses here lost the promised land and they lost egypt everybody okay they could never go back again to egypt they cannot go to the promised land they're dying in the wilderness amen so don't expect the leaders of those that left the message to go totally worldly they cannot they will try to wear stuff look like message believer but they rejected the message because they cannot go totally in egypt because what they already received would not allow them to go back but they cannot progress again to the promised land they are stuck right there make sense now so make sure in your ears you don't have a potential for idolatry if you have it it's time to break it not to make a golden calf anybody here remove all potential for idolatry because down the road there was somebody will come and stop picking it up and calling you every day or calling your wife what do you think about the message what do you think about hey hey hey those questions were there all along why you didn't answer why you didn't go ask brother branham when he was alive everybody find how many record rockets you have to shoot to come up with the with the picture of huffman you will continue to shoot until hell is destroyed and no rocket can produce that and that matches this one how can you keep this one without that one this one was spoken first and he was joined by men but that one he was joined by god and this one vindicate that this one was correct [Music] amen there is nothing for you to fight against the truth all you can do is work for the truth so god richly bless you continue to ruminate and to chew and may god continue to work in his church brother abraham thank you very much coming from way up there moving all the way here to come and sing amen wonderful wonderful wonderful service let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly father this afternoon thanking you for your grace for your love and your mercy and father opening the ways for your servant to move from far off all the way here because you know in the package of his trip at this time this church was included it doesn't matter what the devil trying to do father your word will always prevail father thank you for speaking to us and father the more we going we are understanding better by and by that it's you lord who opened up the faints the way that they came so that the children the elect can move completely out from leaning on king uzziahs but now to deal with you individually because time is happening that we must go home father may you strengthen brother abraham and may you remember his family back home and the church lord father may you bless also this church and continue to work because we can clearly tell this is not the work of man this is nothing but the work of almighty god may you strengthen his body and father for those that has been prayed for may they remember to continue to confess to act like it and to associate with people that believe in healing so that they can get whatever they wanted that they brought into your presence we humbly ask it and commit them unto the hand may you protect them under the blood throughout the week lord and bless them in a more powerful way lord and those that came from different state to our old father driving all the way here lord i know that therefore trying to trouble some they even call me about something that happened on the road but you more than able to remove it father i pray in the name of jesus christ amen you can go brother said and then dismissed [Music] with [Music] [Music] every day fill my way [Music] [Music] my
