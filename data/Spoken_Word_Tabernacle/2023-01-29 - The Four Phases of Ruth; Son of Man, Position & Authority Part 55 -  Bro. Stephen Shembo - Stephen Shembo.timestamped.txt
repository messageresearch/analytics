[1:17:31] everybody okay
[1:17:33] everybody okay
[1:17:34] so don't sleep
[1:17:38] Genesis chapter 18 verse 1. if you dare
[1:17:42] you can say amen amen and the Lord did
[1:17:44] what appeared so it's water
[1:17:52] it is a water
[1:17:54] and appearance
[1:18:03] amen don't be afraid if you make a
[1:18:05] mistake that's okay at least the answer
[1:18:07] we in a family
[1:18:09] okay all right and the Lord appeared to
[1:18:13] him
[1:18:14] in the plains of memory brother send me
[1:18:17] back my uh feedback here so I can
[1:18:21] control it yeah the congregation is good
[1:18:24] it's just me
[1:18:25] I need to hear myself so he will settle
[1:18:27] me here
[1:18:29] and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat
[1:18:32] of the day everybody okay and he lift up
[1:18:36] his eyes and look and low how many men
[1:18:40] three men stood by him
[1:18:43] and when he saw them he Abraham run to
[1:18:48] meet them from the 10th door and buy
[1:18:51] himself toward the ground you might be
[1:18:54] seated
[1:18:56] and when Abraham saw these three men
[1:18:59] from the appearing
[1:19:03] the appearing
[1:19:05] produce three men
[1:19:09] everybody okay
[1:19:11] they were visible
[1:19:13] everybody okay
[1:19:14] and when Abraham saw the appearing he
[1:19:18] saw three of them verse three and
[1:19:20] Abraham say Ma
[1:19:25] not my lords even though they were three
[1:19:29] Abraham say my Lord
[1:19:31] singular do you know what Lords means
[1:19:38] do you know what your lord means
[1:19:40] it means Elohim
[1:19:44] everybody okay so Abraham look he say oh
[1:19:47] Elohim
[1:19:50] amen
[1:19:53] his picture we don't know
[1:19:57] how does how did those three men looks
[1:20:01] we don't know but brother Branham said
[1:20:03] they were created
[1:20:05] and God stepped into one of them
[1:20:08] everybody okay
[1:20:09] so the face he used we don't know
[1:20:12] my question do you see the man Jesus
[1:20:15] here
[1:20:18] there's no Jesus here Jesus is the man
[1:20:22] it's not here everybody okay
[1:20:24] and he said my Lord singular
[1:20:28] three
[1:20:29] Abraham still see one
[1:20:32] he said my Lord singular even though
[1:20:35] they three
[1:20:36] amen and we know that among those three
[1:20:39] only one
[1:20:41] was the Lord
[1:20:44] everybody okay so somehow the eyes of
[1:20:48] Abraham was focused on one of them
[1:20:52] are we okay
[1:20:55] verse 3 and he said my Lord if now I
[1:21:01] have found favor in your sight pass not
[1:21:04] away I pray you from your servant job to
[1:21:09] verse 9.
[1:21:10] Hallelujah
[1:21:12] and they say to him
[1:21:16] how many people say
[1:21:18] they
[1:21:20] plural
[1:21:21] are we okay
[1:21:23] that's why I told you please stay up
[1:21:25] okay
[1:21:26] and they plural spoke to him said to him
[1:21:30] where is Sarah your wife
[1:21:33] and he said behold in the water change
[1:21:37] so they knew that Abraham was married
[1:21:40] even though they look they appeared to
[1:21:43] be stranger
[1:21:44] verse 10 and he's saying
[1:21:49] I want you to notice in verse 9 the
[1:21:52] Bible say they say
[1:21:54] everybody okay
[1:21:56] but he moved from they to he
[1:22:01] amen and remember Abraham say Lord one
[1:22:05] so we need to know who's he is he one of
[1:22:09] the three because one is God the other
[1:22:11] one are not God
[1:22:13] everybody okay
[1:22:15] from day to one
[1:22:17] verse 10 and he said
[1:22:20] I
[1:22:23] so singular one person now he's talking
[1:22:26] when they ask him all of them turn
[1:22:28] around they say where is Sarah your wife
[1:22:31] and then one of them say
[1:22:34] I
[1:22:35] me
[1:22:36] we okay
[1:22:38] I will certainly do what return
[1:22:41] everybody okay
[1:22:44] so there is two things here
[1:22:47] this man that is talking came
[1:22:52] everybody okay and he came in appearance
[1:22:57] [Applause]
[1:22:59] everybody okay so disappearance is
[1:23:03] connected to the coming down
[1:23:07] of Elohim
[1:23:10] everybody okay
[1:23:12] to talk to Abraham
[1:23:14] but Elohim is telling Abraham that I
[1:23:18] will again return
[1:23:20] amen are we okay
[1:23:23] so there is a coming thank you and there
[1:23:27] is also a return
[1:23:34] are we okay
[1:23:36] he says I will certainly it's a
[1:23:40] precision
[1:23:41] I want you to be sure of that I will
[1:23:44] certainly return to you according to the
[1:23:47] time of water life
[1:23:49] you know the circle already
[1:23:51] and Lord Sarah your wife shall have a
[1:23:55] son now when he return there is no place
[1:23:59] in the scripture
[1:24:01] that showed when God returned back
[1:24:07] everybody okay they are appearing
[1:24:10] everyone even Abraham's servant could
[1:24:13] look and say we see God again
[1:24:15] amen
[1:24:17] everybody okay everybody okay but when
[1:24:21] he returns
[1:24:23] it is completely a secret
[1:24:26] nobody knows what happens
[1:24:30] but how do we know that he returned
[1:24:34] there is only one son
[1:24:40] that show the people that Elohim
[1:24:44] returned
[1:24:45] And that son was
[1:24:47] one morning
[1:24:49] when Abraham woke up
[1:24:52] everybody okay and he opened the door
[1:24:55] when he came out
[1:24:59] and yes and look he said Master you look
[1:25:03] like you were 20 years older
[1:25:05] [Applause]
[1:25:14] whatever I say at the beginning when I'm
[1:25:16] new to the the
[1:25:19] the YouTube please take it put it aside
[1:25:23] okay okay when you leave church then
[1:25:26] begin to form Ponder on everything you
[1:25:28] want to point okay now let's focus to
[1:25:31] the words
[1:25:32] everybody okay everybody okay okay
[1:25:35] so when Elohim returned the only son you
[1:25:39] can tell is in the morning when Sarah
[1:25:42] come out
[1:25:44] and he has to say
[1:25:45] but these days were passed
[1:25:49] [Applause]
[1:25:50] I remember when we were young and I
[1:25:53] begin to work for you
[1:25:57] in other words the returning of God
[1:26:01] brought a change of body
[1:26:07] everybody okay and it was a secret
[1:26:11] return
[1:26:12] [Applause]
[1:26:15] everybody okay and if you notice
[1:26:19] before
[1:26:20] Elohim returned Sarah was barren
[1:26:28] everybody okay everybody okay but when
[1:26:31] Elohim came back
[1:26:33] in secret nobody's seen it amen Sarah
[1:26:38] changed and the bareness of Sarah was
[1:26:41] taken off
[1:26:46] because she conceived later on in other
[1:26:49] words they return will not only change
[1:26:52] the body but it will also correct
[1:26:56] everything that is in the body that is
[1:27:00] wrong
[1:27:00] [Music]
[1:27:04] every imperfection in the body will be
[1:27:08] completely corrected
[1:27:11] if in your body you miss a finger when
[1:27:14] Elohim return you're gonna have your
[1:27:16] finger
[1:27:17] [Applause]
[1:27:19] if you went to a surgery and your doctor
[1:27:23] remove a gallbladder when Elohim
[1:27:26] returned you will have a brand new
[1:27:28] gallbladder
[1:27:36] oh God verse 10 and he said I will
[1:27:40] certainly return to you according to the
[1:27:43] time of life and lost Sarah your wife
[1:27:46] shall have a son and Sarah heard it in
[1:27:51] the tent door which was how behind him
[1:27:54] so that man he's back
[1:27:57] was turned towards Sarah
[1:28:01] in his appearing
[1:28:03] the back of this man
[1:28:05] will be turned
[1:28:09] toward
[1:28:11] the woman
[1:28:16] everybody okay remember this man that is
[1:28:21] turning his back towards Sarah is not
[1:28:24] Jesus of Nazareth
[1:28:29] everybody okay
[1:28:31] everybody okay
[1:28:37] jump to verse 11. now Abraham and Sarah
[1:28:41] were old everybody okay and stricken and
[1:28:45] well-stricken in age and he ceased to be
[1:28:49] with Sarah after the manner of water so
[1:28:52] you know what he means
[1:28:53] job to verse 14.
[1:28:57] everybody okay
[1:28:59] foreign
[1:29:04] too hard for the Lord so that man was
[1:29:07] the Lord
[1:29:11] but he was not Jesus the man
[1:29:16] I'm trying to emphasize stuff here
[1:29:20] remember Jesus he's twoform
[1:29:22] he can be Jesus the word or Jesus the
[1:29:26] flesh that's why I told you to keep up
[1:29:28] with sermon
[1:29:31] okay
[1:29:33] and the Lord said to Abraham verse 14 is
[1:29:37] anything too hard for the Lord
[1:29:39] at the appointed
[1:29:43] at the time appointed
[1:29:46] so this returning have a specific day
[1:29:52] and if you notice Elohim never gave that
[1:29:56] date
[1:29:57] it is a date that Elohim himself knows
[1:30:01] nobody else knows that date
[1:30:03] it's a precise day that Elohim will come
[1:30:07] back
[1:30:07] [Music]
[1:30:10] it's an appointed time
[1:30:15] it's an appointed time
[1:30:18] it is specific
[1:30:21] I'm trying to save you 50 years of
[1:30:23] headache
[1:30:25] anybody okay
[1:30:26] at the time appointed I will return to
[1:30:30] you everybody okay
[1:30:33] according to the time of what
[1:30:36] and Sarah shall have a son everybody
[1:30:39] okay
[1:30:40] job 2 verse 20.
[1:30:45] and the Lord say
[1:30:46] because the Cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is
[1:30:51] great and because their sin is very
[1:30:53] water Grievous so these things were
[1:30:56] happen when the condition of the time
[1:31:01] has the condition of Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:31:06] [Applause]
[1:31:14] in other words we will have homosexual
[1:31:21] everybody okay
[1:31:23] everybody okay it will be a time of
[1:31:26] provision and during that time Elohim
[1:31:30] was sleep up
[1:31:33] but when he was sleep up he's not gonna
[1:31:37] change the body of Sarah and Abraham yet
[1:31:40] he's coming down to give them a son
[1:31:46] everybody okay
[1:31:48] and the Sun is called in the message of
[1:31:53] the hour the Messiah son
[1:31:56] [Applause]
[1:31:58] which is the son of discernment
[1:32:02] it is when God doesn't have not met you
[1:32:06] physically and the first day he meets
[1:32:09] you he can tell you all about your life
[1:32:14] it is called a messiah son
[1:32:22] how do you know it's a messiah son his
[1:32:25] back have to be turned back
[1:32:27] turn toward the woman
[1:32:30] everybody okay so if you see a man
[1:32:34] one day
[1:32:35] that his body is not the body of Jesus
[1:32:39] of Nazareth
[1:32:40] [Music]
[1:32:42] everybody okay and that man has the
[1:32:46] ability to discern the heart of the
[1:32:49] people until he can turn his back
[1:32:52] [Music]
[1:32:54] to the congregation or to the church
[1:32:57] just know you are in the time of the son
[1:33:01] of man
[1:33:03] [Music]
[1:33:07] everybody okay
[1:33:13] let's go to Roman to John chapter 12.
[1:33:17] glory to God
[1:33:21] Hallelujah
[1:33:22] if you dare you can say Amen
[1:33:28] glory to God if you dare you can say
[1:33:30] Amen
[1:33:34] Hallelujah
[1:33:36] verse 27.
[1:33:38] remember he will have to redeem my time
[1:33:42] okay we already agree
[1:33:47] everybody okay
[1:33:51] John chapter 12 verse 27 if you dare you
[1:33:54] can say amen amen
[1:33:57] now that was our first scripture
[1:34:00] this is what we pull
[1:34:02] for my scripture we can pull more than
[1:34:04] this
[1:34:05] amen but let's stop right there
[1:34:09] so far verse 27 now this is Jesus
[1:34:12] speaking is my soul trouble
[1:34:15] and what shall I say
[1:34:17] father save me from this hour
[1:34:21] but for this course came I to this hour
[1:34:25] so something begin to trouble the Lord
[1:34:27] Jesus
[1:34:29] amen
[1:34:31] and Jesus now prays he says father
[1:34:35] glorify your name
[1:34:43] what is the name of the father
[1:34:48] Jesus said I came in my father's so what
[1:34:53] is the name of the father
[1:34:54] [Music]
[1:34:56] but Jesus is saying glorify your name
[1:35:00] what does he mean
[1:35:04] the prayer of Jesus is Father glorified
[1:35:10] your name
[1:35:12] your name is power and that name is
[1:35:15] Jesus we already know which is the name
[1:35:17] of the father
[1:35:18] father verse 28 glorify your name
[1:35:22] everybody okay when Jesus asked for
[1:35:25] glorification
[1:35:30] I'm going slow so you can soak it when
[1:35:33] Jesus requests
[1:35:36] glorification from God
[1:35:39] it triggers something from God
[1:35:45] amen when Jesus used the word glorify
[1:35:50] something came up what came out
[1:35:55] the Bible says then came there a water a
[1:35:59] voice from
[1:36:01] him are you awake please
[1:36:04] there came a voice from where Heaven so
[1:36:09] glorification
[1:36:11] trigger a voice
[1:36:16] number one it trigger a voice
[1:36:21] amen
[1:36:25] come on saying I have both water
[1:36:29] glorified it and I will water glorify it
[1:36:33] again
[1:36:35] so there is two clarification
[1:36:45] everybody okay
[1:36:46] the voice is saying I have glorified you
[1:36:50] and I will do it again
[1:36:55] how many glorification
[1:37:02] so glorification have two part
[1:37:05] they will glorify you the first time and
[1:37:08] they will glorify you there
[1:37:09] and we already seen that translation and
[1:37:13] glorification happened
[1:37:16] the first glorification happened where
[1:37:19] and the second glorification happened
[1:37:21] where
[1:37:24] and Jesus on the river of Jordan
[1:37:27] all right
[1:37:29] everybody okay when they were baptizing
[1:37:33] him by John the Baptist when Jesus was
[1:37:37] coming out the spirit of the Lord came
[1:37:41] and brother Branham said he received his
[1:37:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost right there I
[1:37:48] have glorified you but I will glorify
[1:37:52] you again everybody okay
[1:37:58] the Bible says this in the book of act
[1:38:01] verse 3 chapter brother when you see me
[1:38:04] coming back you know what to do in the
[1:38:06] book of Acts chapter 3 verse 13 the god
[1:38:09] of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob the
[1:38:14] god of our fathers has water glorified
[1:38:17] his son who Jesus Jesus this was after
[1:38:20] the day of Pentecost so Jesus already
[1:38:23] Rose and Jesus went to heaven so Jesus
[1:38:26] was already glorified everybody okay so
[1:38:30] they glorify him the first time and they
[1:38:32] are glorifying him there second time
[1:38:35] that's why Jesus could cross the Wall
[1:38:38] everybody okay that's why Jesus could
[1:38:41] eat a sandwich and disappear
[1:38:43] everybody okay because the promise to us
[1:38:46] I'm gonna glorify you and I'm gonna
[1:38:48] glorify you again but this glorification
[1:38:52] started with a voice
[1:38:57] verse 29
[1:38:59] the people therefore stood that stood by
[1:39:03] and heard it says he did water thundered
[1:39:07] come on now
[1:39:09] come on now brother
[1:39:11] Jesus everybody okay so what
[1:39:15] we call the voice is a thunder
[1:39:26] this voice can also be called a thunder
[1:39:32] everybody okay so glorification when you
[1:39:36] bring glorification it will open me
[1:39:39] Thunder
[1:39:43] come back
[1:39:46] verse 29 the people therefore that stood
[1:39:49] by and heard it say that he did water
[1:39:53] Thunder others says a water
[1:40:01] so this voice is a thunder
[1:40:05] and this verse also is dementia
[1:40:15] everybody okay so when you see a Ninja
[1:40:19] it is already a panda
[1:40:23] [Music]
[1:40:25] thank you
[1:40:27] everybody okay and when you see a Manger
[1:40:31] a mansion is already a voice because a
[1:40:34] Manger is a messenger and the messenger
[1:40:38] and his message or his voice
[1:40:45] that's why you hear in the message seven
[1:40:49] verses seven angels seven
[1:40:53] I love this church
[1:40:56] so when we say seven voices seven pandas
[1:41:00] seven Angel we are talking about that
[1:41:04] [Music]
[1:41:09] this message is perfectly in line with
[1:41:13] the Bible
[1:41:15] so from today if you hear somebody say
[1:41:18] the seven voices don't be you say Amen
[1:41:21] if they say the seven pandas you say
[1:41:24] Amen if you say the seven seal you say
[1:41:28] Amen if you say there are seven angels
[1:41:31] you say what
[1:41:32] it depends on what you want to eat
[1:41:36] if you want vanilla if you want confetti
[1:41:39] if you want a strawberry it's up to you
[1:41:45] everybody okay everybody okay glory to
[1:41:49] God let's go to Romans chapter 8.
[1:42:01] yeah
[1:42:04] the word made flesh is when we take the
[1:42:08] scripture
[1:42:09] and we make it action to the time you
[1:42:13] are living in so you can catch it
[1:42:20] okay in other words about that's why the
[1:42:24] Bible cannot be changed
[1:42:26] because the Bible despite the generation
[1:42:29] it will always fit your generation
[1:42:32] but it's an old book
[1:42:36] we don't have upgrade
[1:42:38] that oh because we are in 2023 we need
[1:42:41] the new Bible no no no no the same Bible
[1:42:43] can upgrade itself it's upgrade by the
[1:42:47] interpretation of the prophet of Yahweh
[1:42:53] yes sir so the upgrade of the Bible is
[1:42:57] the word made flesh for your day

[1:43:36] just catch it like this and they say
[1:43:38] Amen because this language is not for
[1:43:41] Moses
[1:43:43] if I preach to Moses he won't hear me he
[1:43:46] will be like what is iPhone I said
[1:43:49] because it's not your message it is our

[1:47:25] let's go one that already worked my
[1:47:28] subject this morning
[1:47:32] is the four phases of roof the son of
[1:47:37] man revealed
[1:47:40] or coming
[1:47:46] I put it under
[1:47:49] okay the son of man how
[1:47:52] are coming
[1:47:55] everybody okay
[1:47:56] we are in the trashing floor
[1:47:59] with roof where roof has been given six
[1:48:03] measures of barley and when she was
[1:48:06] given six measure of Bali roof is now
[1:48:09] United in word you already understand
[1:48:12] with Boaz but they cannot touch one
[1:48:15] another in the body in other words they
[1:48:18] cannot unite themselves in the body
[1:48:20] until the King's Men Redeemer that is
[1:48:24] still in between and still have claim
[1:48:27] on roof is completely taken away
[1:48:31] everybody okay in other words you can
[1:48:34] never meet Jesus Christ in the corporal
[1:48:37] if that Kingsman Redeemer have still
[1:48:41] claim in your life
[1:48:45] everybody okay and when the King's Men
[1:48:48] Redeemer was removed then Boaz was
[1:48:51] United in the body with roof and then
[1:48:55] they produce a baby which was called
[1:48:57] Obed everybody okay when you will take
[1:49:01] the threshing flow and we converted into
[1:49:04] the Tabernacle
[1:49:06] everybody okay in the Tabernacle the
[1:49:10] threshing floor is in the holiest
[1:49:12] where roof already received her first
[1:49:16] encounter with Boaz in secret everybody
[1:49:20] okay and Boaz unfolded the sixth measure
[1:49:23] of Bali and told the roof to go home and
[1:49:26] do water
[1:49:27] and rest everybody okay but there is a
[1:49:30] second coming every turn
[1:49:34] of Boaz now when Boaz is returning he's
[1:49:39] returning to pick up roof and go with
[1:49:41] roof home
[1:49:44] everybody okay everybody okay in the
[1:49:47] first encounter even though roof could
[1:49:51] sleep at the feet of Boaz roof could not
[1:49:54] stay ready boa said you need to go
[1:49:56] quickly and make sure nobody knows that
[1:49:58] you came here
[1:49:59] everybody okay but when the Boaz is
[1:50:03] coming the second time Boaz doesn't hide
[1:50:06] it
[1:50:07] everybody okay he's coming boldly to
[1:50:10] take roof wrong and then we found out
[1:50:13] that now roof is into the holiest where
[1:50:16] she's resting and she's resting as a
[1:50:20] preparation for her disappearing
[1:50:25] everybody okay and the disappearing is
[1:50:29] the rewarding of roof which is the
[1:50:32] rapture
[1:50:33] which bring the body change which bring
[1:50:36] the transformation which bring the
[1:50:39] translation
[1:50:42] everybody okay which we call the Rapture
[1:50:45] itself
[1:50:46] so body change transformation
[1:50:48] translation and uh and uh and all and
[1:50:52] glorification all these things are only
[1:50:55] one thing
[1:50:56] by different terminology
[1:50:58] everybody okay now last Sunday this is
[1:51:03] where we stop
[1:51:06] we found out that
[1:51:07] Colossians won't say that Jesus Christ
[1:51:11] who is the image because the image of
[1:51:14] God is Christ you remember that who is
[1:51:17] the image of the invisible God he's the
[1:51:20] firstborn of water every creature he was
[1:51:22] the firstborn of every creature because
[1:51:25] he was the first one that was created
[1:51:29] you already understand that
[1:51:32] God was first the spirit
[1:51:37] everybody okay God moved from a spirit
[1:51:40] and God become the word
[1:51:43] all the logos
[1:51:45] all the theophany or the one we call
[1:51:48] Melchizedek we already know that now and
[1:51:51] he moved from Melchizedek and God
[1:51:54] dropped down into flesh
[1:51:56] this is very important because it's
[1:51:58] going to clear all the smoke today
[1:52:00] Lord's willing everybody okay so we're
[1:52:03] moving from a spirit form into a tea or
[1:52:06] funny from a theophany into the flesh or
[1:52:09] the body or the corporal
[1:52:12] everybody okay and we found out that
[1:52:15] first God moved from the spirit into the
[1:52:18] word and when he was the word this is
[1:52:21] when God begin to create everything
[1:52:24] everybody okay he wants the first
[1:52:26] creature God created God himself and
[1:52:30] then God that was created begin to
[1:52:32] create everything
[1:52:35] everybody okay and we found out that
[1:52:38] collusion Paul says that for by him
[1:52:42] the word we're all fixed water created
[1:52:45] that our way
[1:52:47] and that are in the water visible or
[1:52:51] invisible whether there be water or
[1:52:54] water or water or water and we found out
[1:52:58] that all of these are categories of
[1:53:00] angels
[1:53:02] amen so God begin to create the Angels
[1:53:07] first
[1:53:09] everybody okay everybody okay
[1:53:13] let's go to Hebrew chapter one verse 4.
[1:53:18] father help me
[1:53:20] if you dare you can say Amen
[1:53:23] when God created himself as the logos
[1:53:27] the Bible explained to us that
[1:53:30] he was made so much better than water
[1:53:33] we saw that stay up my friend please he
[1:53:36] was made so much better than water then
[1:53:39] Angel give him some volume
[1:53:42] usually this is the one that works
[1:53:44] better
[1:53:46] per my observation
[1:53:51] thank you amen
[1:53:53] and the Bible says that being made so
[1:53:57] much better than Angel
[1:53:59] as he has by inheritance obtained a more
[1:54:03] excellent Name than they so there are a
[1:54:06] couple of things here number one he was
[1:54:09] better than angel
[1:54:11] which we already seen better than Angel
[1:54:14] because he's the one that created angel
[1:54:16] he created the throne the Dominion the
[1:54:20] principality the Mighty the power all
[1:54:22] that Army he created that and number two
[1:54:25] Hebrew is saying here that he has a name
[1:54:30] that is above everything
[1:54:35] okay
[1:54:37] what are we talking here when we're
[1:54:40] talking about the name now Paul says
[1:54:42] here he says all things were created by
[1:54:46] Him and for him and he is before water
[1:54:49] because he was the first one that
[1:54:52] appeared and there was nothing he was
[1:54:55] before anything then he began to create
[1:54:58] everybody okay and by him all fixed the
[1:55:01] water consists
[1:55:03] Paul says in Ephesians
[1:55:05] which he wrote In Christ when he raised
[1:55:08] him from the dead and set him at his own
[1:55:10] right hand in the Heavenly places
[1:55:13] far above our water principality and
[1:55:16] water house and water if you notice
[1:55:19] Mighty was not mentioned here
[1:55:22] everybody okay here we had prawns
[1:55:25] Dominion principalities power but there
[1:55:28] is another category that is called the
[1:55:30] might
[1:55:32] you must say might and power are the
[1:55:35] same thing if you look here it says
[1:55:37] power and might it's too separated
[1:55:40] we okay now he says fire above water and
[1:55:45] water power give him some volume please
[1:55:47] and water and water and every name you
[1:55:52] see that
[1:55:53] he's not just better than Angel but the
[1:55:56] second thing is his name
[1:55:58] everybody okay every name daddy's name
[1:56:01] not only in water this world but also
[1:56:04] that which is how to come what are you
[1:56:07] talking about the name remember Jesus
[1:56:10] said glorify that foreign
[1:56:14] here in Philippians 2 verse 10 he says
[1:56:18] that at the name of water Jesus
[1:56:23] we okay now what happened at the name of
[1:56:27] Jesus
[1:56:28] when you say Jesus
[1:56:31] because Paul says that number one is
[1:56:34] better than all the angel why because he
[1:56:37] created everything and he created the
[1:56:39] angel you cannot be better than your
[1:56:41] creator
[1:56:42] everybody okay but number two Paul says
[1:56:45] that he was given a name that is
[1:56:48] excellent
[1:56:49] why is this name excellent
[1:56:51] Paul explained that when you say Jesus
[1:56:56] what does he mean to a believer
[1:56:59] everybody okay Paul says and that name
[1:57:02] and the name of Jesus what happened
[1:57:06] should water
[1:57:08] Every Praise
[1:57:10] Every Praise every kind of worship we
[1:57:13] can do it is to our God
[1:57:17] everybody okay so at the name of Jesus
[1:57:21] how many knees
[1:57:23] do you see an exception there every knee
[1:57:27] should do water now did they tell you
[1:57:30] which knee
[1:57:32] did they say every human need
[1:57:36] did they say every engine
[1:57:38] do angels look like human being
[1:57:41] do they have me
[1:57:43] so everybody the heavenly
[1:57:46] do animal have knees
[1:57:50] everybody okay so every means in other
[1:57:54] words every creature
[1:57:57] you got it now whether it is an animal
[1:58:00] whether Ace is a ninja whether it is a
[1:58:03] human everything why because he's the
[1:58:06] one that created all of him
[1:58:08] everybody okay at the name of Jesus
[1:58:11] every knee should do what now or fixed
[1:58:15] in water heaven
[1:58:17] and fixing water and fixed way under the
[1:58:21] Earth so the power of the name of Jesus
[1:58:24] Christ
[1:58:25] is dominating through here
[1:58:28] yes sir
[1:58:30] all right come on man
[1:58:32] everybody okay
[1:58:34] he dominates the heaven
[1:58:39] everybody okay he dominates the Earth
[1:58:44] and he also dominate under the Earth
[1:58:49] and we know that in heaven they are
[1:58:52] Dimension we already went through that
[1:58:55] when you going up in heaven you're gonna
[1:58:57] get to the region of the save
[1:59:00] then you pass the angel then God himself
[1:59:03] when you're going down you go to the
[1:59:06] region of the Lost then the demon then
[1:59:09] Lucifer himself so the name of Jesus
[1:59:12] Christ when you say it in heaven
[1:59:15] everything down
[1:59:17] everybody okay on the earth everybody
[1:59:19] down if you get to hear everybody down
[1:59:26] everybody okay

[1:59:32] Christ is unlimited
[1:59:34] [Applause]
[1:59:36] everybody okay
[1:59:40] the Bible said and that every word
[1:59:43] should have confess that Jesus is water
[1:59:47] lord means Elohim
[1:59:52] in other words everybody will one day
[1:59:56] recognize that Jesus Christ is God
[2:00:02] let me continue he said that every
[2:00:06] tongue should confess that Jesus Christ
[2:00:08] is who to water the the glory of God

[2:00:25] they said who is worthy everybody okay
[2:00:28] and I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[2:00:31] with a loud voice who is water worthy to
[2:00:35] open death and to lose the water
[2:00:38] and no man in water heaven and nor in
[2:00:42] water neither

[2:01:16] of redemption belong to the person that
[2:01:20] is higher than heaven
[2:01:22] higher than the earth and higher than
[2:01:25] the other

[2:04:43] either they are on earth or they are
[2:04:46] well in heaven you will never find his
[2:04:49] family down there
[2:04:51] because one of this day the Lamb of God
[2:04:54] died on Calvary and he went down to Hell
[2:04:57] and he opened the door and he pulled his
[2:05:01] family out
[2:05:04] hey
[2:05:05] everybody okay he said David come out
[2:05:09] job come out Abraham come out Ezekiel
[2:05:13] come up Adam comma everybody came out
[2:05:19] [Music]
[2:05:21] and because of his blood he cause of
[2:05:25] this Blood the entrance
[2:05:27] to hell was locked
[2:05:33] everybody okay so when you die as a
[2:05:37] Christian don't worry that's why
[2:05:39] Christian died peacefully
[2:05:43] they're not worrying where they're going
[2:05:45] because as they're sliding automatically
[2:05:49] they are angels that are coming up and
[2:05:50] say come on buddy
[2:05:52] everybody okay everybody okay that's why
[2:05:56] Paul said the family in heaven and the
[2:05:59] family where
[2:06:00] not the family and because there is no
[2:06:03] representation of you in hell when you
[2:06:06] go to hell if they check they say you
[2:06:08] don't belong here we will never open the
[2:06:11] door for you even if you want to go to
[2:06:13] hell hell will kick you off
[2:06:17] because you don't belong to hell you
[2:06:20] belong to a royal family a family of
[2:06:24] Jesus Christ a family that is above
[2:06:27] everything above everything in Heaven
[2:06:29] above everything on the Earth above
[2:06:32] everything under and at your name add
[2:06:36] your name every need will bow before you
[2:06:42] [Music]
[2:06:44] everybody okay there is no creature that
[2:06:48] is on top of you
[2:06:50] [Applause]
[2:06:51] foreign
[2:06:54] Lord help me look at this my brother
[2:06:58] look at this my brother Paul is saying
[2:07:01] this I want you to catch this
[2:07:05] Paul is saying this he said he has done
[2:07:08] what he has put water oh
[2:07:11] under his feet
[2:07:14] and he gave him to be the water hey of
[2:07:17] the water all things
[2:07:19] he did it to whom to a church
[2:07:25] if you look at a different translation
[2:07:28] it says this he says that
[2:07:32] God put everything under the feet of
[2:07:36] Jesus
[2:07:37] and gave him to be the head of
[2:07:40] everything for the benefit of the church
[2:07:49] go search your translation
[2:07:52] amen so whatever God was doing in Jesus
[2:07:55] Christ he was doing it for you when
[2:07:58] Jesus was catching demon and locking
[2:08:01] them up what he was looking at he said
[2:08:04] I'm doing this so brother Kalima one day
[2:08:07] will know what I'm doing
[2:08:10] and he locked the devil and put him down
[2:08:12] he said which demon again
[2:08:15] demon of who last bring him here
[2:08:17] he said you lost come over here let's
[2:08:21] say master I'm sorry I'm sorry he said
[2:08:23] don't worry I'm doing this so my
[2:08:26] children will be free from you everybody
[2:08:28] okay so everything was put under his
[2:08:33] feet
[2:08:34] not because of him
[2:08:38] because he's God it is for your benefit
[2:08:44] let me help you out
[2:08:47] Lord help me look at Paul he says and to
[2:08:51] make all men to see what is the water
[2:08:53] Fellowship of this mystery which from
[2:08:56] the water beginning of the world has
[2:08:58] been how who created how all things by
[2:09:02] who Jesus Christ
[2:09:05] are you ready are you ready he created
[2:09:08] our thing by Jesus Christ why
[2:09:11] to the water
[2:09:14] so when God taught Jesus
[2:09:18] to start creating everything
[2:09:20] he was doing that for a purpose what was
[2:09:24] the intent of God
[2:09:26] by giving the creation power to Jesus
[2:09:30] he says he do the intent that now
[2:09:37] you know who they are and on to the
[2:09:40] water in how heavily
[2:09:42] he didn't say heavenly places in Christ
[2:09:46] watch there
[2:09:47] did you notice that they didn't say in
[2:09:50] Heavenly places in Christ because
[2:09:52] Heavenly places is Christ is the
[2:09:54] position of the believer if a demon
[2:09:57] entered there he's converted
[2:09:59] he's no longer a demon
[2:10:01] he cannot get there to get there you
[2:10:04] must be justified sanctify baptized with
[2:10:07] the Holy Ghost then you enter the
[2:10:09] Heavenly places in Christ

[2:10:30] might be known
[2:10:33] by who the church the water water wisdom
[2:10:38] of God so God is using the church
[2:10:41] everybody okay I said two to make the
[2:10:46] principalities and the power nor his
[2:10:49] power
[2:10:53] in other words when you're in trouble
[2:10:56] the one who's supposed to cast The Devil
[2:11:00] is Jesus himself
[2:11:02] do you follow me but Jesus say I cannot
[2:11:05] do that myself
[2:11:07] I have a family I'm gonna magnify my
[2:11:11] name
[2:11:13] when I magnify my name my name is above
[2:11:17] everything
[2:11:18] then I take that power and I give it to
[2:11:21] the church so me Jesus can sleep
[2:11:25] do you follow me so if the demon wanna
[2:11:28] know my power they don't need to come to
[2:11:31] me they just need to come to brother
[2:11:33] said
[2:11:35] because I want to make known the money
[2:11:38] fall of my power and my wisdom by the

[2:28:42] and they will obey you everybody okay so
[2:28:45] far let's give him a clap of him
[2:28:57] thank you
[2:29:02] you fool or you go okay
[2:29:08] we found out
[2:29:10] according to John chapter 3 verse 3 the
[2:29:13] Bible said Jesus answer and say unto him
[2:29:16] verily verily I say unto thee except
[2:29:19] amount be a man be water born again he
[2:29:22] cannot see the Water Kingdom of God
[2:29:24] Jesus didn't say born
[2:29:29] born water again so there is two birth
[2:29:35] everybody okay God gave birth to what
[2:29:39] to God and the God gave birth to what
[2:29:42] flesh
[2:29:46] everybody okay
[2:29:48] go to Hebrew one again
[2:29:51] if you dare you can say amen amen we
[2:29:54] were on verse uh
[2:29:56] on verse four let's go to verse 5. Lord
[2:29:59] help me
[2:30:01] four to which of the Angels say he at
[2:30:05] any time you are my son so God birth
[2:30:08] something
[2:30:09] he's calling him the Son of God
[2:30:11] everybody okay which is the word
[2:30:14] this day have our water because so God
[2:30:17] begotten he birthed something and we
[2:30:20] already seen that what he birth is the
[2:30:22] tea of honey
[2:30:24] the word everybody okay
[2:30:26] have I begotten you and again I will be
[2:30:30] to him
[2:30:33] watch verses six and
[2:30:38] do you see the word again
[2:30:41] do you see the word again so number one
[2:30:44] buff and there is a birthday game
[2:30:49] so Jesus when he see us he said you must
[2:30:53] be born again
[2:30:58] everybody okay
[2:31:00] God the way he became human follow me he
[2:31:05] went from the first birth
[2:31:07] amen but the first birth of God
[2:31:11] he was never a flesh
[2:31:14] follow me carefully
[2:31:17] the first birth of God God birth himself
[2:31:21] as the word
[2:31:23] everybody okay then God asked the word
[2:31:27] because when he birth himself he
[2:31:29] disappeared here as the word he birthed
[2:31:32] himself again
[2:31:34] and when he birth himself on again this
[2:31:38] is a this is B then God become what
[2:31:42] verse 6 and again
[2:31:45] when he brings in the first water you
[2:31:50] see his first begotten because he's the
[2:31:52] first one
[2:31:53] into the water so in other words he
[2:31:57] begin to take the logos and make him
[2:31:59] enter the world the second time so the
[2:32:03] first birth it's the word the second
[2:32:06] birth is the
[2:32:07] but me and you we didn't come that way
[2:32:13] we came from the spirit
[2:32:15] all the way to the water
[2:32:18] so there is one step we skip
[2:32:21] [Applause]
[2:32:23] you following me so when Jesus is coming
[2:32:27] he checks us
[2:32:29] he said
[2:32:32] you're missing a piece

[2:32:59] again in other words God is telling you

[2:33:37] Hallelujah he says and Nicodemus say
[2:33:40] unto him how can a man be water
[2:33:43] born when he is what oh so Nicodemus

[2:34:09] how can a man be born when he's what
[2:34:12] can he enter the water

[2:34:17] so the first time you were in your
[2:34:19] mother's womb
[2:34:22] let me explain you that this so you
[2:34:24] understand because you're trying to uh
[2:34:27] fight I mean your brain is fighting you
[2:34:29] let me explain you a little bit this way
[2:34:32] Jesus was not created from heaven
[2:34:38] [Music]
[2:34:40] when Jesus was born
[2:34:42] okay they were looking for a delivery
[2:34:45] room
[2:34:49] I'm trying to help you so the way you
[2:34:51] are born and the way Jesus was born
[2:34:54] there is no difference
[2:34:56] foreign
[2:34:59] Mary was in person
[2:35:03] so there is no difference between you
[2:35:06] and Jesus as a man
[2:35:10] as comes as far as what he concerned the
[2:35:13] birth I want you to get that
[2:35:15] so Jesus was also on the belly
[2:35:19] so when Mary was moving Jesus was there
[2:35:22] just like you
[2:35:24] I'm saying that so you can absorb
[2:35:26] because you see look Jesus I mean Jesus
[2:35:29] I mean Jesus no no no no no no he was
[2:35:31] like you
[2:35:32] okay Jesus they had the baby bottle and
[2:35:35] they were feeding Jesus
[2:35:37] and Jesus was crying and they changed
[2:35:39] his diaper
[2:35:41] [Music]
[2:35:43] you don't understand me they changed the
[2:35:46] diaper of Jesus Christ they gave Jesus a
[2:35:50] shower just like you
[2:35:54] now you begin to understand
[2:36:02] Jesus was crying also I'm hungry I'm
[2:36:05] hungry I'm hungry and they say wait the
[2:36:08] food is just about we're going to bring
[2:36:10] it to you okay they say Elizabeth
[2:36:13] and Elizabeth goes Jesus me mommy is
[2:36:18] cooking they did also for Jesus
[2:36:20] [Applause]
[2:36:22] okay okay okay
[2:36:26] so he was a human 100 percent
[2:36:28] [Applause]
[2:36:31] the Bible said he can enter the water in
[2:36:35] his mother's womb and be water
[2:36:39] can he go can we go back again to the
[2:36:41] maternity Jesus said that's not what I'm
[2:36:43] saying amen if you miss if we miss the
[2:36:49] part of the word
[2:36:50] amen Jesus said I wanna check you all of
[2:36:55] you are flesh with spirit
[2:36:58] I don't see your word part I don't see
[2:37:01] your Divine part
[2:37:02] so therefore
[2:37:04] you must be
[2:37:09] and by the way in either way you must go
[2:37:12] back again to this thing
[2:37:15] everybody okay
[2:37:17] now to be born again you already
[2:37:21] fulfilled the flesh your mom and your
[2:37:24] daddy already took care of that so to be
[2:37:27] born again you must know what you miss
[2:37:32] what you miss is the world
[2:37:35] so to be born again you need the word to
[2:37:39] give you birth
[2:37:42] are you following me
[2:37:44] are you following me
[2:37:47] that's why the Bible says being how
[2:37:51] not of water
[2:37:53] because you already did that
[2:37:54] [Music]
[2:37:56] not of corruptable seed but of what
[2:38:00] to buy the water word of God in the
[2:38:03] beginning what's that word Jesus is
[2:38:06] telling you now I need to go back to
[2:38:09] what Bethany
[2:38:10] so you can make contact with your word
[2:38:18] be born another corruptible sin
[2:38:21] Battlefield corruptor by the water word
[2:38:24] of God which how living and water
[2:38:31] this Jesus here we know that his name is
[2:38:34] Christ
[2:38:36] Christian
[2:38:38] amen
[2:38:40] amen
[2:38:43] open John 12.
[2:38:46] Lord help me
[2:38:48] it's amazing this church
[2:38:56] I have more than 60 something called
[2:39:00] and every time you touch five seven
[2:39:03] I don't know what to do
[2:39:06] go to 12 please don't worry it's a
[2:39:08] loading we will continue to pump it I
[2:39:11] told you you will smell like the message
[2:39:12] laugh like the message talk like the
[2:39:15] message walk like the message and
[2:39:17] everything you do will be the message
[2:39:21] that's my objective
[2:39:24] until when Jesus looked at you he says I
[2:39:27] am the message who are you the message
[2:39:31] come on let's go home
[2:39:34] because he can only match what is like
[2:39:36] him
[2:39:37] that's why you got to be transformed by
[2:39:40] the renewing of your mind
[2:39:42] everybody okay John 12 if you're there
[2:39:45] you can say Amen verse 32 are you there
[2:39:48] my friend
[2:39:50] and I if I be how
[2:39:54] from the earth will draw water
[2:39:58] so when we look at cases like this with
[2:40:01] a Pentecostal understanding we think
[2:40:03] that somebody would take Jesus and
[2:40:08] but look what the scripture says
[2:40:11] verse 33 he said signifying what what he
[2:40:16] should water die so Jesus is telling the
[2:40:19] Jew that I'm gonna die
[2:40:21] but the way I will be dead
[2:40:24] they're gonna Lift Me Up
[2:40:26] what does it mean stop right there okay
[2:40:30] keep your finger right there go to John
[2:40:32] 3.
[2:40:35] the Bible says brother Branham say the
[2:40:38] Bible says what Abraham say the Bible
[2:40:40] say brother Branham says
[2:40:42] go to John 3 please
[2:40:44] if you dare you can say Amen
[2:40:46] verse 14 if you dare you can say amen
[2:40:49] and as Moses did what
[2:40:53] the serpentine water
[2:40:55] even so must the son of man
[2:40:58] be water
[2:41:01] everybody okay let's go back where we
[2:41:04] were
[2:41:05] we okay now
[2:41:07] so Jesus was telling them that how the
[2:41:10] way Moses took a a breast serpent put it
[2:41:13] and lifted up on the pole that's the way
[2:41:15] I'm going to be lifted up in other words
[2:41:17] I would die the death of the cross
[2:41:21] are we okay we okay now now let's go
[2:41:24] back where we were verse uh 32.
[2:41:28] the Bible says Jesus say verse 33 this
[2:41:33] he said signifying what what
[2:41:36] that he should water die stop so this
[2:41:40] man Jesus the flesh he can die
[2:41:45] follow me carefully before I dropping to
[2:41:48] brother brother amen this man is mortal
[2:41:53] in other words he has a beginning and he
[2:41:56] also have a
[2:41:59] he has a beginning and he also have a
[2:42:02] water okay watch carefully verse 34 are
[2:42:07] you there brother Robert goddess the
[2:42:09] people answer him because the people
[2:42:12] knew that he was crushed cross means the
[2:42:15] Messiah it means God is living in this
[2:42:18] man
[2:42:19] now the man that we thought is God begin
[2:42:23] to tell us that they're gonna kill him
[2:42:26] the Jews got puzzled they say wait a
[2:42:29] minute
[2:42:30] God be killed
[2:42:32] listen to me carefully verse 34 that
[2:42:35] people answer him we have heard
[2:42:39] out of the law that how Christ about
[2:42:43] this house forever we believe you are
[2:42:45] Christ
[2:42:46] but crystals crust doesn't die
[2:42:51] how can you die
[2:42:53] let me help you now with my board
[2:42:56] the Jews are telling Jesus is saying
[2:42:58] here
[2:42:59] everybody see me Jesus here
[2:43:03] Jesus here says that they're gonna kill
[2:43:06] me did you say wait a minute we heard
[2:43:09] that
[2:43:12] does now
[2:43:14] so the Jews have a difficulty now
[2:43:17] understanding crust in human flesh
[2:43:21] Jesus was telling them this man is gonna
[2:43:25] die destroy this Temple and I will raise
[2:43:29] it up in they say wait a minute you the
[2:43:32] cross but how can class die the Lord
[2:43:34] said Christ the baddest
[2:43:36] Christ is Melchizedek he doesn't die
[2:43:39] he's there he has no beginning of day no
[2:43:42] ending of life he has no father no
[2:43:44] matter he is eternal how can we kill
[2:43:47] Krishna now we confused
[2:43:49] Jesus Christ verse 434 the people answer
[2:43:53] him we have heard of the law that
[2:43:56] crossed the bird of house forever so her
[2:43:59] say you the son of man
[2:44:02] must be water lift it up in other way
[2:44:05] there is two son of man
[2:44:07] Jesus was telling them one of my son of
[2:44:10] man is gonna be dead they only knew one
[2:44:13] of the son of man which was the word
[2:44:16] they say wait a minute the word will die
[2:44:19] the son of man but today we understand
[2:44:22] son of man is Christo and it's the flesh
[2:44:26] we okay
[2:44:27] he says the son of man must be lift up
[2:44:31] who is the water the Jews got confused
[2:44:34] wait a minute we taught you the son of
[2:44:36] man but you are saying you're gonna die
[2:44:38] but the son of man cannot die so now
[2:44:42] which son of man are you talking about
[2:44:47] everybody okay everybody okay another
[2:44:50] word the son of man the word doesn't die
[2:44:57] amen but the son of man's flesh is
[2:45:01] subject to death
[2:45:03] the son of man flesh have the beginning
[2:45:05] and the ending but son of man word have
[2:45:08] not beginning no ending but that word
[2:45:11] was made flesh
[2:45:14] another word in Jesus Christ there were
[2:45:17] two son of man
[2:45:23] this is not Pentecostal teaching body
[2:45:27] amen there were some of men word and
[2:45:31] some of men flesh the word was made in
[2:45:35] other words the word and the flesh
[2:45:37] matched together that's why brother
[2:45:39] Branham say Jesus is 100
[2:45:43] man and 100 percent that's why Jesus
[2:45:48] could cry
[2:45:49] and then he turned around he said move
[2:45:53] the the stone
[2:45:56] Lazarus come out
[2:45:57] the one that say Lazarus come out is the
[2:46:02] world

[2:46:22] glory to God brother Branham he said he
[2:46:26] came right down the water
[2:46:28] regular land means spirit and then
[2:46:33] and then flesh but we did
[2:46:36] to the water we bypass our tea or
[2:46:39] furnace
[2:46:40] everybody okay from attribute before the
[2:46:44] foundation of the world his name is put
[2:46:46] on the land's water book of life then
[2:46:48] from that he became the water and the
[2:46:51] water that could appear in the water
[2:46:53] disappear and then he became water flesh
[2:46:56] and returned back again resurrected that
[2:46:59] same body in a water glorified condition
[2:47:02] but you bypass the water and became a
[2:47:06] flesh man

[2:47:38] with the life of who Jesus
[2:47:41] Old Testament and Jesus in the New
[2:47:43] Testament and you gathered exactly who
[2:47:46] Jesus was he was not just an ordinary
[2:47:51] man he was how God wow

[2:47:59] me get here then I may read it this way
[2:48:02] can everybody see me okay let's read it
[2:48:05] this way he was God changed from the
[2:48:08] water
[2:48:10] Supernatural form of a man he was how
[2:48:14] God manifested in flesh well in water

[2:48:56] William Marion brother
[2:48:58] that is the reason his disciple water
[2:49:01] couldn't understand him
[2:49:03] because of this mystery
[2:49:06] did I say you speak in water
[2:49:10] she was sometime
[2:49:16] do you see why I prefer you with the
[2:49:18] scripture so now you can understand
[2:49:20] brother brother
[2:49:23] if I never done it you will be part of
[2:49:26] what brother Branham is saying he not
[2:49:28] the word brother Branham is a Torah
[2:49:31] scriptural prophet
[2:49:34] a Vindicated message
[2:49:39] a Vindicated Prophet that is perfectly
[2:49:43] in line with the Bible
[2:49:48] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:49:52] that's why you can never separate
[2:49:55] William Branham from the Bible
[2:49:58] the message and the Bible are
[2:50:04] everybody okay let's go that's why
[2:50:07] that's the reason his disciple could not
[2:50:09] understand him they say you speak in
[2:50:11] water he was sometime Jesus
[2:50:15] and sometimes the father speaking
[2:50:21] any problem
[2:50:22] he said that is the way it is with you
[2:50:25] if you are filled with the Holy Spirit
[2:50:28] any man that is filled with the holy
[2:50:31] spirit says speaks that he hardly knows
[2:50:34] sometimes what it is saying if he's
[2:50:37] truly how get away Spirit that's why you
[2:50:41] say things and it happen and you say oh
[2:50:43] my God I was just joking and it happened
[2:50:48] it is not you that spoke you have not
[2:50:51] understand how to turn on and off yet

[2:51:49] Jesus was not born here
[2:51:51] amen that was not Jesus that was talking
[2:51:55] to Abraham there that could discern the
[2:51:57] thought in who Sarah's mind that was not

[2:55:12] manifested in the water let us not the
[2:55:15] Flesh in there
[2:55:18] the word in the person of water not the
[2:55:21] priesthood but the person the water for
[2:55:25] this man Galilei had not yet been but he
[2:55:29] was in there the word so he had no
[2:55:33] father no water he was God himself he
[2:55:37] was manifested in the form of a water
[2:55:39] man they call him king of water which is
[2:55:42] king of water which is king of water he
[2:55:45] was who melchized he had made the water
[2:55:47] father no mother beginning of this oh
[2:55:50] ending of life he was Jesus Amen
[2:55:54] in the form of a water man then he was
[2:55:57] made actually what human flesh number
[2:56:00] three and dwell among us Emmanuel God
[2:56:04] dwelling with us in the person of who
[2:56:07] Jesus Christ born of who Virgin Mary
[2:56:11] number three he come in that form so he
[2:56:14] could die and went back into heaven now
[2:56:17] in this last day he has promised to
[2:56:20] manifest himself in the fullness again
[2:56:22] of his what but how in the spirit any
[2:56:26] question
[2:56:28] if you fool us stop because I have not
[2:56:30] started the son of man
[2:56:32] if you fool I stop here
[2:56:35] because if I dig down I have if I stop
[2:56:38] here I'm gonna change the title
[2:56:41] because I have not touched the son of
[2:56:42] man
[2:56:45] reveal because that's pretty deep
[2:56:55] let's stop here my friend
[2:56:57] it's a lot of food
[2:56:58] I'm gonna find a different title for
[2:57:00] this and we're going to come back Lords
[2:57:03] willing on the son of many reveal
[2:57:06] if you don't understand this difference
[2:57:08] you're gonna get puzzled in the message
[2:57:13] amen God
[2:57:15] first at the beginning it was the word
[2:57:19] and God later on was made flesh
[2:57:22] amen
[2:57:24] and you need to understand God
[2:57:27] and this God here is the son of man
[2:57:31] amen so when we say the son of man is
[2:57:34] coming
[2:57:35] we need to know which coming and which
[2:57:38] son of man is coming
[2:57:41] everybody okay that's why I'm gonna go I
[2:57:44] have to stop here because what I have
[2:57:47] after this what I what what you see here
[2:57:50] is heavy
[2:57:53] okay you already got a lot let's block
[2:57:56] right here recognize Who You Are
[2:58:00] you are from the family of the world
[2:58:03] and the boss of your family is above
[2:58:06] everything in heaven everything on the
[2:58:09] earth and everything under the Earth and
[2:58:12] you are part of that family and he died
[2:58:15] he worked and he did everything so that
[2:58:18] you can benefit from the work that he
[2:58:20] did as a father he worked and he laid
[2:58:24] out the treasure he left you a big bank
[2:58:26] account so that when he's not there you
[2:58:30] don't go hungry you use his name go to
[2:58:33] the bank that's why brother Branham say
[2:58:35] that God give us a check with the name
[2:58:39] of Jesus Christ written you need to fill
[2:58:42] up the checkbook
[2:58:44] amen you need to recognize Who You Are
[2:58:47] you need to recognize that you are under
[2:58:50] the head ship of Christ because you
[2:58:53] cannot have authority if you don't know
[2:58:55] how to submit to Authority
[2:58:58] that's why the Roman centillion say I'm
[2:59:01] a man and so before he can exercise
[2:59:04] Authority he need first to be under
[2:59:07] Authority so we must come under the
[2:59:10] authority of the word first when you
[2:59:13] reposition yourself in under the
[2:59:15] authority of the word then you now have
[2:59:18] the authority of everything that is
[2:59:21] under the word because that's what your
[2:59:24] boss that's what our boss that's what
[2:59:26] our father our husband did
[2:59:30] everybody okay so God put pressure on
[2:59:33] him
[2:59:35] so that Mordecai can wake Esther up
[2:59:38] and say Esther you're sitting there keep
[2:59:41] saying I'm the queen I'm the queen I'm
[2:59:43] the queen I'm the queen and somebody is
[2:59:46] disturbing the kingdom all the time
[2:59:48] somebody's destroying your family all
[2:59:50] the time and now he's trying to wipe
[2:59:53] your children to wipe your ankle wipe
[2:59:56] your entire family and you're sitting

[3:00:09] the hospital and you happy if you're
[3:00:11] looking at your children bats leading

[3:00:17] you happy is making a fast in your
[3:00:19] family and you happy fine Deliverance
[3:00:22] will come from somewhere but who knows
[3:00:27] who knows
[3:00:29] if that is the reason why you were kept
[3:00:32] for La audition
[3:00:35] who knows if that is not the reason why
[3:00:39] God crept you and brought you first in
[3:00:42] the message
[3:00:43] so that through you You're Gonna Save
[3:00:45] the whole race
[3:00:47] of your family who knows as they wake up
[3:00:51] you don't know who you are
[3:00:54] amen and Esther begin to explain what
[3:00:57] you and me explain all the time but you
[3:01:00] know if I go to the king I'm gonna die
[3:01:02] they say nobody can go there she didn't
[3:01:05] know who she was
[3:01:06] she was talking like anybody going to
[3:01:09] the kingdom
[3:01:11] who are you first of all to start saying
[3:01:13] that if I go to the king they're going
[3:01:15] to kill me
[3:01:16] you forget that you're the Bride of the
[3:01:18] king so you think the king will kill his
[3:01:20] own wife
[3:01:23] you see how low
[3:01:25] Esther got you see how low we got
[3:01:29] amen and he put Esther in desperation
[3:01:33] and when the Esther came out of this
[3:01:35] eruption she said if I need to die I'm
[3:01:38] gonna die when she entered was she
[3:01:40] killed
[3:01:42] the king say ask what
[3:01:45] everything up to water in other words my

[3:01:56] what do you want
[3:01:58] Queen Esther what troubles you what is
[3:02:01] wrong

[3:02:10] around
[3:02:11] tell me who it is
[3:02:15] we will get to that second banquet one
[3:02:18] day and you'll see where amen was who
[3:02:20] was begging did you see him and begging
[3:02:22] the king
[3:02:25] go search the Book of Esther did you see
[3:02:28] amen begging the king
[3:02:30] huh
[3:02:31] amen begging way where Esther was lying
[3:02:35] on the bed
[3:02:36] in other words Esther relaxing and the
[3:02:40] devil crying
[3:02:42] please have to take my life and that
[3:02:44] stuff is holding like this this is the
[3:02:47] day this is the day
[3:02:51] because she did her party
[3:02:57] everybody okay everybody okay let's
[3:03:00] stand let's stop right there
[3:03:09] Church These are stuff to position you
[3:03:13] because if you don't know your position
[3:03:15] you're going to be confused
[3:03:17] there is a lot of depression in the
[3:03:19] message churches because people don't
[3:03:22] know what the Holy Ghost is
[3:03:24] they don't know how they don't get the
[3:03:26] Holy Ghost they don't know if they are
[3:03:28] safe or not they don't understand
[3:03:30] everything
[3:03:32] they are puzzles
[3:03:34] they don't know who they are
[3:03:37] amen
[3:03:39] the time has come that we gotta clear
[3:03:41] the smoke
[3:03:42] you go to stand boldly
[3:03:46] and speak to the devil
[3:03:48] there is a difference between boldness
[3:03:51] and humility
[3:03:55] boldness doesn't mean you're not humble
[3:04:00] and humility doesn't mean to somebody
[3:04:02] who work like this
[3:04:03] okay that is your humility
[3:04:06] humility is to be able to Humble before
[3:04:11] the word
[3:04:13] okay
[3:04:16] so don't bring your kind of humility
[3:04:21] okay somebody might be here and say God
[3:04:25] bless you good morning that doesn't mean
[3:04:27] the humble that is our human humility
[3:04:31] and somebody must say hey man like
[3:04:33] brother Wayne Lawson preaching it
[3:04:35] doesn't mean the brother is now he's a
[3:04:37] humble man but he's booked
[3:04:39] that is not proud that is not arrogancy
[3:04:43] that's boldness to know who you are
[3:04:46] we must make a difference between that
[3:04:55] everybody okay if you want to fight to
[3:04:58] the devil you don't fight him like say
[3:05:00] it then please in Jesus name would you
[3:05:03] come out that's not humility
[3:05:06] that's a message humility
[3:05:10] wear a pair of jeans every day then
[3:05:13] that's humility that's your humility
[3:05:16] your Prophet there how is he wearing
[3:05:19] what kind of tire is he wearing
[3:05:22] about the tie
[3:05:25] he was humble so our humility doesn't
[3:05:29] mean she don't wear a suit that is our
[3:05:31] message humility
[3:05:33] get that out of this
[3:05:35] out of here
[3:05:36] okay the humidity is to humble yourself
[3:05:39] whether you have a Jinn you have a
[3:05:42] spirit of humility whether you wear a
[3:05:45] suit you are a spirit of humility and
[3:05:48] the one who ever suit and took Sado and
[3:05:50] the one who have the pereth overall we
[3:05:52] can hug one another and we are happy
[3:05:54] that is humility

[3:06:05] want to get a car that's fine if that's
[3:06:08] what you can afford but it doesn't means
[3:06:11] that you humble because your car is from
[3:06:13] junkyard

[3:06:17] if the Lord gives you an ability to go
[3:06:20] buy a brand new car go buy it thank God
[3:06:23] and put that air conditioning and be
[3:06:26] happy
[3:06:27] that is not proud
[3:06:33] pride is a spirit
[3:06:37] who is more humble than a pope
[3:06:40] who is more humble than a puppy but
[3:06:42] Brothers but the scripture say he's the
[3:06:44] Beast

[3:07:38] father thank you for speaking to us and
[3:07:41] clearing up the smoke so that your
[3:07:44] children now can understand the lordship
[3:07:47] and their position in Christ and the
[3:07:50] authority that has been given to the
[3:07:52] church so that the church can exercise
[3:07:55] the power and not being like priests who
[3:08:00] are walking who are servant are riding
[3:08:03] the horses
[3:08:04] that's one of the things that Solomon
[3:08:06] saw and he troubles Solomon he says that
[3:08:09] I have seen praise the servant riding
[3:08:12] and then the children the princes are
[3:08:15] walking
[3:08:16] because they don't know who they are
[3:08:19] because the devil
[3:08:23] the religious world
[3:08:25] the Dogma decrees
[3:08:27] the many camps
[3:08:29] and doctrine of man that Rose in this
[3:08:32] message
[3:08:33] the people until they don't even have a
[3:08:36] scripture where to send on
[3:08:39] father I'm not the only one
[3:08:41] I'm not the only people on the street oh
[3:08:43] no on the beach we are many
[3:08:46] but father we just one of them
[3:08:49] that we are trying to uphold this
[3:08:51] message
[3:08:52] so that your children we recognize who
[3:08:55] they are
[3:08:55] and when we fully understand that your
[3:08:58] prophets say then we will go
[3:09:02] father may we stand Toe to Toe with the
[3:09:05] Devil
[3:09:07] no matter what is going on
[3:09:12] father the church don't know
[3:09:15] it has been a month or two
[3:09:18] that I was walking with a burning foot
[3:09:23] and I was preaching here
[3:09:25] with a burning foot
[3:09:26] [Music]
[3:09:29] the chiropractor
[3:09:30] saw me but the foot was burning
[3:09:33] father I prayed
[3:09:36] I committed the body unto the hand and I
[3:09:39] continued to work
[3:09:41] with a burning foot
[3:09:43] preaching with a burning foot
[3:09:46] until today I don't even remember when
[3:09:49] was the day that burning foot was gone
[3:09:52] and my foot is perfectly good and
[3:09:56] perfectly fine
[3:09:58] because of what you're doing
[3:10:02] father no matter what it is give your
[3:10:06] children faith that they can stand
[3:10:10] father remove everything that is petty
[3:10:13] in the life of your children
[3:10:15] may they realize that we are called for
[3:10:19] something higher something greater than
[3:10:21] this
[3:10:23] and you are depending on the church
[3:10:25] to show the manifold wisdom
[3:10:29] because the intent you have is to
[3:10:32] display your power
[3:10:33] through the blood
[3:10:36] you saw by Moses to destroy the
[3:10:39] amalekite
[3:10:41] but none of the people were able to
[3:10:43] destroy them even David
[3:10:45] they were about to they they escape
[3:10:48] generation after generation until Esther
[3:10:53] rose up
[3:10:54] and destroy the last seed of the America
[3:10:59] father may we be those Esther of the
[3:11:02] same time
[3:11:03] that can rise and stand for our families
[3:11:06] and like Abraham forget the symptom
[3:11:10] and crime

[3:11:15] claim our healing claim everything
[3:11:18] refuse the mediocrity
[3:11:22] [Music]

[3:11:27] it is our name
[3:11:29] we are entitled by birth we have a right
[3:11:33] to be called The Bride of the Lamb
[3:11:36] father touch your children
