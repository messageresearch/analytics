amen please be the name of the Lord amen I only had one question and I already answered to the individual but if you I don't know it's the devil that has been fighting our system the new system either it's with the sound and also with the slide that we put in so I loaded all the quotes in a WhatsApp chat good so if you dare you should be able to access the code if there is any code that we read on Sunday that is not there and you still need the code just shoot me a text or something then I'll make sure I put it up so everybody in this church have their foundation not only me keeping it but I want you to keep it so you might help somebody else who have questioned why are you talking or fellowshipping if somebody brought up something you can say no this is what Brad Branham say not what brother Stephen say about what brother Branham say and this is what the Bible says that's where we want to get our foundation from amen so I will remember the question and answer on the 20 on the 19th of this month Lord's willing and I'm open if they are still questioned around what was preached on Sunday as uh or stand for the question in the box so when we on question and answer we can sit and expand it more and communicate more if somebody's missing something you can just ask and we make sure we all on the same page and we see the same vision and that will make things a whole lot easier amen amen glory to God everything is okay and everything will be good for Thanksgiving I will talk to the Deacon I believe the last time we have a service on a Tuesday but let me work it up and see and I will confirm at Lord's willing on Sunday whether we're going to have Wednesday service or it's going to be a Tuesday service so we'll let you know on uh on on Sunday Lord's willing and keep praying for us tonight I'm not preaching it's a uh a lot to be a big surprise brother Jim namichi crossed this way again the first time we missed him and he had to go back home because there was either four people that died in his church or something like that so by God's grace he made it this time very short time so he will be preaching for brother Berry Lord's worldly on Sunday morning so

Jesus [Music] see amen amen shall we be seated for a moment I bring you very special greetings from Ghana and West Africa and precisely from Kumasi which is in the center of the country I flew over with my wife Esther and for a funeral 34 year old lady she had had four or three cesarean sections and the fourth one after the successful success success for cesarean um section she had a beautiful baby boy but she got a very severe case of migraine and then it developed into something else and she had to be on life support for about three three weeks and um she passed on she had lived with us in our house for a long while and she was especially a very good friend of my daughter second daughter Susie and it was such a big blow so we flew over to assist in the funeral and we laid here we nearly two weeks ago yeah and um so I called over to Stephen and Barry coffee had invited me so I decided to pass through here and greet the church and there are a lot of things have gone on down the drain and we have been part part of it we've been hearing and I've been coming in and out for the past 30 something years and so uh some of you may know me here and we've had a wonderful times together and then the wings the tsunamis begin to blow and I tell you what some earthquakes and Volcanic actions and the result is known very much to you and it's very very strange so I've been meditating on on things like this it's not just in one place but here and there and I've been wondering what will be the reason why people can go so far and turn around and I realized that it's nothing but one thing the foundation [Applause] yeah the foundation and the entry into the message so I've decided to preach on the foundation but the thing is we've come this far we find no fault we feel like going on we've come this far we find no fault we feel like going on though trials May praise us troubles all around we've come this far we find no fall we feel like going on how many feet are going on yes sir I don't know about you but I've come this far I find no fault I feel like going on I've come this far I find no fault I feel like going on though trials may press us I've come this far I find no fault I feel like going on yes sir I feel like going on [Applause] I find no fault if you came to sick Falls you find plenty and I was asking somebody I said hey man you put any prophet in this Bible under the radar and you are going to find false yeah because that's why we're looking for [Applause] and the devil will feed you with a lot of them amen but if you were looking for God I was looking for God and I found him and I found no fault and I feel like going on Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord you know what Brethren I want to share my personal testimony here uh I've got so many testimonies to keep me from preaching so just share the latest I was raised up in a Catholic Church Springfield as a little baby my mother told me they sprinkled me I wouldn't have known because I was a baby well I grew up and then I heard the gospel I repented and then I remember I was praying with the Pentecostal guy and he spoke in tongues and interpreted and I said I should go and look for my baptism as a baby was wrong so all I knew at the time was immersion so I looked and I got a Pentecostal person that immersed me in the titles of father son Holy Ghost almost immediately I picked a message book and it was titled doing God a service not according to his will and then I started reading it and the grammar was so horrible but there was something inside there I wasn't I wasn't looking for grammar I was reading it between their lives and then I saw that no I should have been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] but there was nobody anywhere that I knew that could do that for me it took a long while and then um brother we had a missionary I've given this testimony and some of you may have may now remember so I I wrote dear brother Branham I've just read your message book and I realized that my but my second baptism was also wrong but there's hardly anybody around me to re-baptize me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so after a while by Billy Paul wrote and told me problem was dead but the message is still alive and it's true so then a missionary came from Fort Wayne Indiana but Tommy Dillard who passed away recently so he came in and I was directed and I met him and had baptism I traveled miles and miles over from the northern part of my country yes for water baptism and with my mother and my nephew went and got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I have been preaching it ever since and even before but stronger along the line and for so many years now I read so many messages and listened to the prophet I never felt like worship Him brother never once every time the message brought me on my knees to love the Lord Jesus Christ so I I can't I just can't understand why people complain that we we talk about brother Brandon more than we talk about the Lord Jesus Christ who did the prophet reveal what did this message reveal did the mercy reveal William Branham did brother brother promote himself [Music] [Applause] was he was see somebody that was interested in a Showmanship [Music] self-glorification I never once ever saw anything to even suggest oh my goodness so I find it so hard to understand why people can do what they're doing these same people are blaming others for saying that prophets don't make mistakes all right now these same people get around and say why should the prophet blah blah make mistakes did they hear me why did you [Music] prophets make mistakes yeah you can tell me prophets don't make mistakes prophets make mistakes all right then prophets make mistakes so why should he make mistakes so what do you want him to do is he he shouldn't make mistakes and yet he makes mistakes and you don't understand it well our Brethren yes we don't even have to waste our time listening to anything that will cause us to earn the Bible says my son sees from listening to anything that will cause you to earn yes therefore our commission is not to preach any man no we are commissioned to preach the gospel don't let us waste our time trying to defend anything this message is a lion you don't need to defend a liar that's releasing from the cage and the lion will defend himself and the sad thing is the men they are butchering the man they are destroying is not even here to defend himself oh yeah so what's the point in doing that praise the Lord so shall we thrown our feet as we turn quickly to our Bible and we read from Luke chapter 6. Luke chapter 6 and from verse 46 to 49. the Lord Jesus told so many parables and he made so many powerful statements and they are very relevant especially to our time I wish we had a long time to be able to not that I'm here to teach know that we have a very solid pastor and no breastfeeding for a while and thank God he's had a thought yeah solidly and within a short time frame by God's grace being able to secure such a nice sanctuary I was reading where David was saying my son Solomon the house of God must be magnificent yes sir [Music] so you know it's not wrong to have a nice Tabernacle yes sir but the beauty of the church is the character of the people we know that amen so you look chapter 6 and from verse 49 Lord as we open your word we are not worthy but you are worthy so we depend on you to help us to anoint us to Quicken the word unto us I yield my spirit to you even as I yield my audience to you now Lord take over the service is yours because the people are the purchase of your blood so help us Lord to draw closer to you through your word in the name of Jesus Christ Our Savior amen amen for Luke 6 says excuse me from verse 46 then there came a reasoning among them which of the of them should be greatest no no no that's not God has the purpose for me reading that yeah maybe some were struggling over leadership you know yes sir uh Isaiah chapter 6 from ah what is this look chapter 6 46 down Jesus speaking why call ye me Lord Lord and do not the things which I see whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayings and do with them I will show you to whom he is like he is like a man which built an house and dig deep and laid the foundation on a rock and when the flood came the flood would definitely come the stream beat vehemently upon the house and could not shake it why amen if you are founded on the right foundation I don't care what denominational storms I don't care what kind of Doctrine and storms I don't care what will be blowing you will still be standing standing solid on the Rock Foundation yes sir he could not shake it for it was fun DED upon a rock Hallelujah but he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that without a found a foundation build an house upon the Earth against which the stream did beat vehemently and immediately it fell and the wind of the house was great so he says through Isaiah 28 16 Jehovah God says Isaiah 28 16 therefore thus saith the Lord God behold I lay in Zion a foundation a stone a tried Stone a precious Cornerstone a sure Foundation he that believer shall not make haste a sure Foundation a rock Foundation Jesus our lord was working with the disciples in Matthew 16. and that's the last one I read before you sit and I keep standing amen oh so you pray for me Hallelujah Hallelujah song is ringing in my heart I'm standing on the rock I'm standing on the rock I'm standing on the rock Christ Jesus is the wrong yes sir from verse 30 when Jesus came into the course of caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples say whom do men say that I the son of man am I am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah's or one of the prophets it is very easy to be saying what somebody else is saying oh yeah sometimes we live off on other people's testimonies that's building on on boarding on or what no in Sinking sin they said some say thou art John the Baptist some Elias and otherwise others Jeremiah so one of the prophets is heaven to them but whom say ye that I am what's your personal revelation of who I am tell me who do you say I am who do you say these messages who do you say it is revealing [Music] and Simon Peter and said said Thou Art the Messiah the Christ the sun of the Living God Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon by Jonah for Flesh and Blood have not revealed unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will board my church and the gates of hell shall not Prevail against it the prophet said the case of hair would definitely fight but I will not Prevail against him and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever thou shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever thou shall lose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven then church he his disciples that they should not they should tell no man that he was Jesus Christ may the Lord bless his word as we take our sins
