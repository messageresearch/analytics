[33:32] know the history behind it how that god
[33:36] had brought the children of israel out
[33:38] of egypt's bondage placed them in the
[33:40] land and he he gave them specific
[33:43] instructions to
[33:45] every seven years they would have a time
[33:48] of rest a year of rest and then after
[33:50] seven
[33:51] seven years or 49 years the 50th year
[33:55] would be the year of jubilee amen and in
[33:58] that year
[33:59] every slave every man that got in debt
[34:03] and had to sell himself as a slave a man
[34:06] or whatever
[34:07] brought him into this position
[34:09] by the law amen in this 50th year he
[34:14] could lay down his hole he could throw
[34:15] down his rake amen he could get off the
[34:18] horse he could do
[34:20] put away everything that he was working
[34:22] with and go back home because it was the
[34:25] year of jubilee amen and i believe
[34:28] tonight amen that the message that has
[34:31] come it has done more than just hear
[34:34] hear a voice it has brought liberty to
[34:37] the people of god and given us victory
[34:40] in jesus christ tonight amen and let us
[34:43] be able to go back to our family amen go
[34:46] back to our homeland go back to our
[34:49] possessions and
[34:50] take hold of what god had given us amen
[34:55] now this inheritance that the children
[34:56] of israel had it was a perpetual
[34:59] inheritance in other words it was handed
[35:02] down from generation to generation amen
[35:05] and there's only one generation that's
[35:07] handed it down to us and that's the
[35:08] generation of jesus christ
[35:10] he has handed it to us tonight and given
[35:13] us brother greg the liberty amen and the
[35:16] freedom and the possession amen of our
[35:20] land amen now brother branham told us in
[35:23] the message titled job 1955 he said and
[35:26] during the time of slavery
[35:29] before the emancipation of the
[35:31] proclamation was signed while they tell
[35:33] me that the slaves in the south would
[35:35] climb up the hill
[35:36] there's going to be free at sunrise he
[35:39] said some could climb a little higher
[35:40] than the others the older ones couldn't
[35:43] get up there amen the younger went on to
[35:45] the top of the hill for as soon as they
[35:48] seen the sun
[35:49] amen they were free
[35:52] amen so the ones that got the highest
[35:54] just as soon as the sun popped over the
[35:57] top of the the hill they said we are
[36:00] free
[36:01] they hollered it down to the next group
[36:03] that one hollered it down to the next
[36:05] that one hollered it on down we are free
[36:08] amen on down the hill passing and every
[36:11] man that sees the esso in is free this
[36:15] evening he whom the son hath made free
[36:18] is free indeed tonight and i'm so so
[36:22] thankful amen that many years ago he set
[36:25] me free to this evening and gave me a
[36:28] liberty in jesus christ now i've been
[36:31] speaking at home on being in christ and
[36:34] i'll tell you there's no other place we
[36:36] need to be but in christ this evening
[36:39] and if we get in christ then everything
[36:41] else will fall in place tonight
[36:44] amen now as we look at this this the the
[36:48] weekly sabbath amen is to give a
[36:50] centennial rest for man and beast and
[36:53] god said man shall work six days sally
[36:55] labor and on the sabbath day or the
[36:57] seventh day shall he rest and after six
[37:00] years of unbroken harvest was to be a
[37:02] rest for the land unto the lord the year
[37:04] of jubilee we done quoted that but let
[37:06] me just go over this for just a moment
[37:08] to set my foundation and at the end of
[37:11] seven weeks of years gave an opportunity
[37:14] of restoration for the poor uh those who
[37:17] had been compelled to alienate their
[37:19] lands and listen tonight we were
[37:21] compelled by our elder brother adam we
[37:24] were sold into slavery amen but thank
[37:28] god our
[37:29] our brother jesus amen he has come
[37:32] tonight amen he has set us free and not
[37:35] only that but in this age in which we're
[37:38] living in amen he has come once again
[37:41] amen and taken his word and brought
[37:44] liberty to those that have been bound by
[37:46] creeds and dogmas and traditions of men
[37:49] and ideology amen that's kept us away
[37:53] from the very land of the word of god
[37:56] amen that provides us everything that we
[37:59] have need of in its hour amen to make it
[38:02] through and to be victorious
[38:05] amen
[38:08] now we realize that these
[38:10] seven years or these jubilees or these
[38:12] these days of rest it points on to the
[38:15] jubilee the redemption of the purchased
[38:18] possession ephesians 1 14 when all the
[38:21] disabilities that have been following us

[38:27] regain all the inglorious inheritance
[38:30] that god has has given us which was
[38:33] alienated by our sin this evening amen
[38:37] and with what joy must thousands have
[38:39] heard the notes of that trumpet sounding
[38:41] out amen over the land and the trumpet
[38:44] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[38:46] incorruptible and we shall all be
[38:49] changed

[39:57] redemption he said let's go to calvary
[39:59] tonight to get out of the things of the
[40:02] world oh he's wonderful
[40:04] know that we are free
[40:06] he who the son has made free is free
[40:09] indeed and you was free to calvary when
[40:12] jesus paid the oscillation price to god
[40:15] the father when he suffered in flesh and
[40:18] died and he repaid or paid the price of
[40:22] your redemption that you could be
[40:24] redeemed back to god now where where
[40:27] were we redeemed to we were redeemed
[40:30] back to our rightful position amen as
[40:34] sons and daughters of god
[40:37] amen adam when he was in his rightful
[40:39] position before the fall he could speak
[40:42] to that tree sitting over there and say
[40:43] move over yonder he could speak to the
[40:45] wind and say wind be still he could
[40:48] speak to the fishes or all the animals
[40:50] he could speak to the lions he could
[40:52] speak to the bears he could pet them and
[40:54] and play with them amen but sin came in
[40:57] the picture and when it did adam could
[40:59] no longer speak to the tree and move
[41:02] over there he could no longer speak to
[41:04] the wind but when jesus christ paid the
[41:07] price
[41:08] amen when he redeemed me he restored me
[41:12] back to that position
[41:16] and as i have need and god moves upon me
[41:19] i can speak to the wind
[41:22] well brother joel don't believe that
[41:23] well that just makes you an unbeliever
[41:26] i have experienced it
[41:29] we were in the philippines a few years
[41:30] ago brother dole jackson and myself and
[41:32] the brothers there they wanted to come
[41:34] across the ocean to one of them the
[41:36] meetings from one island to another and
[41:39] the wind was so boisterous and the waves
[41:41] so hard and high that they couldn't get
[41:44] across in their little boat so they
[41:46] asked us to pray
[41:48] and we prayed
[41:51] and after a little while we got word the
[41:53] brothers are on their way the waves have
[41:54] died down the winds have ceased amen and
[41:58] when they got there they said praise the
[42:00] lord we made it and god gave them a big
[42:02] old fish
[42:03] that they could sell and buy their gas
[42:05] to go back home with
[42:08] the wind died down and it was so so dead
[42:12] and so flat and no wind and we like to
[42:15] roast it
[42:18] we like to roast it
[42:20] next time we're going to pray lord stop
[42:22] the wind on the ocean but keep it
[42:25] blowing here
[42:29] well
[42:30] maybe some of you get it tomorrow and
[42:32] some of you get it next week
[42:34] amen we're going to pray specific
[42:37] don't just stop the wind but stop it on
[42:39] the ocean and let it continue blowing
[42:41] here because we need to breathe amen oh
[42:44] let me tell you amen what what was that
[42:46] that is part of that restoration
[42:49] that we can ask anything in jesus name
[42:52] and he said my father will give it you
[42:56] amen but we've got to have faith as we
[42:59] sing the song only believe all things
[43:02] are possible to them that believe
[43:05] tonight amen so we have been redeemed
[43:08] back to our rightful position this
[43:10] evening now that word proclaim as they
[43:14] began to proclaim liberty from the top
[43:16] of the mountain on down and back there
[43:18] when the trumpet blew or the the rams
[43:20] horn blew amen it was a sound of jubilee
[43:24] a sound of deliverance a sound of
[43:26] victory amen and that word proclaim
[43:31] it's a primitive root
[43:33] and it means to call out to that is to
[43:36] properly address by name
[43:39] but it's used in a wide variety of
[43:41] applications to berate itself or berate
[43:45] self that are bitten call
[43:48] for or call for or call forth or call
[43:51] self or call upon to cry unto
[43:54] to be famous to be a guest to invite to
[43:58] mention to give to a name to preach to
[44:01] make a proclamation to pronounce to
[44:04] publish to read
[44:07] renowned and to say amen so all of those
[44:10] definitions amen they point back to what
[44:13] jesus did whenever he was hanging there
[44:16] on the cross the nails were in his hand
[44:18] the crown was on his head the stripes
[44:20] were on his back and he cried out it is
[44:23] finished i'm here to tell you tonight
[44:25] what was finished was my redemption and
[44:28] yours this evening and it has been
[44:31] restored back to you and i we have been
[44:34] restored back to our rightful position
[44:36] and we are no longer slaves this evening
[44:40] we are no longer bound by the
[44:42] nominational creed we are no longer
[44:44] bound by ideas of men amen we have been
[44:47] set free in christ jesus tonight
[44:51] amen
[44:54] exodus 20 and verse 2
[44:57] says i am the lord thy god
[45:00] which have brought thee out of the land
[45:02] of egypt out of the house of bondage
[45:06] amen he said i have done it
[45:09] i have delivered you and you're sitting
[45:11] here tonight amen you're no longer a
[45:13] slave to sin
[45:15] you're no longer a slave to
[45:16] denominational ideas and dogmas you're

[45:29] been liberated amen and by that
[45:32] liberation amen what's happening in your
[45:34] life is you're moving forward in the
[45:37] things of god amen you're not held back
[45:40] you're not held back by
[45:42] by some man's idea but thank god there
[45:45] is a liberty in jesus christ there is a
[45:48] freedom tonight amen that says come up a
[45:50] little higher just like the spirit told
[45:53] john amen come up a little higher come
[45:56] up into the heavenlies this evening and
[45:58] that's where god wants us to be he don't
[46:00] want us to be with our our mind on
[46:03] earthly things he wants us to be
[46:05] heavenly minded
[46:08] and realize this world is fading away
[46:12] this world is passing away but thank god
[46:15] there is a land beyond the river there
[46:18] is a place there is a resting place
[46:21] there is a place that i call home
[46:24] and by the grace of god i'm going back
[46:26] to that place
[46:32] [Music]
[46:34] brother brahma said
[46:36] in jubilee year he said now if you'll
[46:38] notice
[46:39] in symbol that jubilee year repeats
[46:42] now again
[46:44] every so often there is a renewal a
[46:47] revival
[46:48] strikes the land
[46:50] just the great welts revival it closed
[46:53] not long ago
[46:54] the people we might go and have billy
[46:56] grahams and oral roberts is all over the
[46:58] land
[46:59] everywhere
[47:00] and no matter how much we try
[47:03] how great we try to organize the people
[47:05] together and ban them it takes god
[47:09] to bring a revival
[47:18] y'all don't mind if i make myself at
[47:19] home do you
[47:21] good
[47:22] i was going to
[47:27] brother madam said
[47:29] we might have all the billy grahams
[47:31] now
[47:32] some of you i'm sure have been over to
[47:34] the billy graham library and you've seen
[47:35] all the masses of people and all the
[47:37] people that gave their heart to jesus
[47:41] amen and and he led them to a repentance
[47:45] but he did not lead them to the baptism
[47:48] of the holy ghost
[47:50] he led them to a head knowledge but i
[47:53] preached at the church sunday i said we
[47:55] need to get it out of our head and into
[47:58] our heart
[47:59] we need to get it about 12 inches down
[48:02] amen we can have it up here all day long
[48:05] and it won't help us a bit all it'll do
[48:07] is give us a little education in the
[48:09] word all it'll do is give us a little
[48:11] head knowledge but when it comes down
[48:13] here it will change our life it'll make
[48:16] a new creature out of us a new creation
[48:20] because it's no longer just a
[48:22] middle
[48:23] mental conception but it is a birth in
[48:26] our heart that changes our life tonight
[48:29] and that's what god is looking for he is
[48:32] looking for change lives by the power of
[48:35] the resurrected christ this evening
[48:41] [Music]
[48:43] he said no matter how much we try or how
[48:46] hard we try
[48:47] we cannot bring a revival
[48:51] i laid my jacket off i didn't have one
[48:53] in my pocket
[48:55] i left my briefcase back there in the
[48:57] office i didn't have one in my briefcase
[48:59] amen but something is stirring in your
[49:03] heart
[49:04] something is moving
[49:06] amen when the word of god comes forth
[49:09] you can't sit there like a knot on the
[49:11] log
[49:16] you can't sit there like a bump on a
[49:18] pickle
[49:19] because something down inside of you
[49:22] says that's the word of god that's the
[49:25] reality that's thus saith the lord and
[49:28] that's what set me free tonight
[49:30] the liberty of jesus christ it has
[49:33] brought victory in my life it's given me
[49:36] joy that i didn't have it's given me
[49:38] peace that i didn't have it's given me
[49:41] rest that i didn't have it's given me
[49:43] something
[49:44] amen that i can lock my arms around and
[49:47] say blessed be the name of the lord this
[49:49] is what's going to bring about a change
[49:51] in me
[49:58] [Music]
[50:03] psalms 146 and verse 7
[50:07] which execute a judgment for the
[50:09] oppressed
[50:10] which give us food to the hungry
[50:13] the lord
[50:15] loses the prisoners
[50:22] paul and silas were thrown in a roman
[50:24] jail
[50:26] because they were preaching the gospel
[50:30] and long about midnight they began to
[50:31] sing
[50:34] even though they were in jail
[50:36] they had a liberty amen that the jailer
[50:40] didn't know nothing about
[50:41] they had a freedom amen that those
[50:44] around them other prisoners they didn't
[50:45] have that
[50:46] they began to sing
[50:48] and the bible said there was a great
[50:50] earthquake
[50:51] and the stalks fell off and the chains
[50:54] fell off and the doors opened
[50:58] and the jailer got excited oh no
[51:01] the prisoners they'll escape and i'll
[51:04] have to give an account my life for
[51:06] theirs but paul and silas cried out
[51:10] don't worry we're all here
[51:13] we ain't going nowhere we're in the
[51:15] midst of a revival
[51:17] our hearts are stirred
[51:19] our spirits are moved we're rejoicing
[51:23] amen oh i take tonight that's why amen
[51:26] they can't take us away from this
[51:28] message they may try
[51:30] amen forgive me tonight they may say
[51:33] there's something better they may say
[51:35] it's not real it's not because i've got
[51:37] a book in my hand it's because i've got
[51:39] the word in my heart by the greg that's
[51:42] what lives tonight
[51:45] that's what's real
[51:46] it's christ the word in me this evening
[51:50] that's what's real
[51:54] it's not a
[51:55] it's not a picture on the wall
[51:58] it's christ in my heart
[52:01] it's christ in me the hope of glory
[52:11] [Music]
[52:13] it's the lord
[52:15] that loosens the prisoners
[52:20] and the seal of the antichrist the
[52:22] prophet would say it like this
[52:24] i hope it's okay to read
[52:34] notice
[52:36] when the jubilee sounded
[52:38] the man could drop his hole if he wished
[52:41] to
[52:42] but what if he didn't want to
[52:45] what happened
[52:49] then they must take him down to the
[52:50] judges
[52:52] and the judges take him to the post
[52:55] and they bored his ear through with an
[52:57] awl
[52:59] and from that time on
[53:01] never no more
[53:03] it was a sign that he could never hear
[53:07] that trumpet of jubilee
[53:10] no matter how many jubilees he lived
[53:12] through
[53:13] amen he would never be able to do it
[53:17] again
[53:19] because he was marked
[53:21] because he rejected
[53:24] oh let me tell you tonight i don't want
[53:26] to be one of those with my ear bored
[53:28] through
[53:29] i don't want to be one of those that
[53:30] rejected the word of god i don't want to
[53:33] be one of those that said i don't
[53:34] believe it i can't accept it i'm here to
[53:38] tell you i have seen it real
[53:40] i have seen it alive i have seen it
[53:43] tonight and i know beyond the doubt it's
[53:46] not what i heard i have experienced
[53:49] jesus christ
[53:52] i have experienced this message
[53:55] it's real
[53:57] [Applause]
[53:59] it's not a dried-up formal doctrine of
[54:01] men
[54:03] it's the living word made flesh
[54:06] it's the living reality of jesus christ
[54:09] tonight
[54:15] [Music]
[54:34] they question it
[54:37] forgive me tonight
[54:39] they question it
[54:41] and they say well i don't believe it
[54:44] well guess what
[54:46] i do
[54:49] and if you don't that makes you an
[54:51] unbeliever
[54:55] [Applause]
[54:58] and jesus said blessed are they that
[55:00] believe
[55:02] for they shall be saved
[55:05] and they that believeth not shall be
[55:09] i didn't say it
[55:11] jesus did
[55:13] i believe it with all of my
[55:18] heart what other what other generation
[55:21] has seen what we've seen
[55:24] what other generation has heard what
[55:26] we've heard
[55:27] what other people have seen almighty god
[55:31] come down and wrap himself in flesh
[55:33] again
[55:35] listen what did he do in jesus christ he
[55:38] was the sinless
[55:40] virgin-born son of god
[55:43] and god dwelt in him in the fullness of
[55:46] the godhead bodily but in our generation
[55:49] there was a sinner that was saved by
[55:51] grace that god came down brother greg
[55:55] and he used the vessel
[55:57] he used a vessel
[55:59] and he spoke through that vessel and
[56:02] that vessel amen said thus saith the
[56:05] lord
[56:06] jesus said i say unto you but our
[56:09] prophet said thus saith the lord
[56:13] and where has it failed
[56:17] i may not be able to explain it
[56:20] i may not be able to understand it
[56:23] that's not the key
[56:25] the key is if thou can't believe
[56:29] jesus nowhere
[56:32] nowhere
[56:33] did he ever say you got to sit down and
[56:35] explain it
[56:38] he didn't say it says she got to figure
[56:39] it out
[56:41] what he said was if thou canst believe
[56:45] all things are possible
[56:49] [Applause]
[56:54] a
[56:56] a
[56:57] l
[56:59] all-inclusive
[57:00] without exception
[57:03] everyone
[57:06] so i can believe there was a a cloud
[57:08] formed by angels
[57:10] [Music]
[57:13] i can believe
[57:14] there was a pillar of fire that rested
[57:16] on his shoulder
[57:19] and he had a heavy bible in this hand
[57:21] and a light hat in this hand and this
[57:24] shoulder was like that
[57:27] what was that
[57:28] that was the angel of god
[57:31] leaning on his shoulder
[57:37] brother madam said that angel was about
[57:39] 200 pounds about six foot tall or so
[57:42] amen and you know when when somebody
[57:45] would come and lean on my shoulder about
[57:46] that size i would be into
[57:51] oh brother joe that's silly i'm here to
[57:54] tell you tonight i believe it with all
[57:56] of my heart
[58:01] [Applause]
[58:06] how do you know it's real brother joe
[58:09] last time i went to the philippines
[58:12] i was preaching
[58:14] brother royale soriano who just went to
[58:16] be with the lord i'm sure you've heard
[58:18] that
[58:18] amen but in his pulpit his camp meeting
[58:21] there
[58:22] as i was preaching my topic that night
[58:24] was
[58:25] not just another service
[58:28] and i was i was elaborating on if jesus
[58:32] doesn't come by
[58:34] this service is all in vain
[58:37] if he doesn't visit us
[58:39] and show himself and minister to the
[58:42] needs of the people speak to the
[58:43] people's heart we've just had another
[58:45] protracted meeting
[58:48] but as i was speaking those things
[58:50] there was a sister in the back she just
[58:52] felt impressed to snap some photos
[58:55] and she snapped four clicks
[58:58] and the first one was was clear
[59:01] the second one was clear the third one
[59:04] was clear
[59:05] but the fourth one
[59:07] all across the pulpit there was like
[59:09] seven licks of cloud
[59:12] and i've got the picture i can show you
[59:16] now that don't make me nothing
[59:19] but that's just god confirming his word
[59:23] and that night there was a sister who
[59:25] had been in a motorcycle car accident
[59:28] and she'd had pain in her back for
[59:30] months
[59:31] but whenever i was making those comments
[59:33] and that that supernatural event took
[59:35] place i believe it was supernatural amen
[59:38] and when that took place she testified
[59:40] afterwards i had a pain since then
[59:46] and a couple other things that god did
[59:48] in that service amen now i want you to
[59:51] understand tonight if you don't come by
[59:53] here on beatrice avenue or beatrice
[59:56] street tonight it's just another service
[59:59] but i am looking for jesus
[1:00:02] to come by here tonight and walk up and
[1:00:04] down the avenues and not only that but
[1:00:07] up and down the avenues of our heart and
[1:00:09] minister to us and help us this evening
[1:00:12] because we are a needy people
[1:00:15] but thank god he knows my name
[1:00:19] he knows my address
[1:00:21] he knows my need tonight
[1:00:24] and he's able to come by and minister to
[1:00:27] me and you this evening

[1:00:39] luke chapter 1 verse 74.
[1:00:43] that he would grant unto us
[1:00:46] that we being delivered
[1:00:48] out of the hand of our enemies
[1:00:52] might serve him
[1:00:54] without fear
[1:00:58] i want you to understand tonight fear
[1:01:01] is one of the greatest things people
[1:01:03] battle in this day

[1:01:17] that i'm afraid of covid
[1:01:24] i'm not afraid of it i respect it
[1:01:26] but i trust god
[1:01:30] you know i worked in the pharmacy for
[1:01:32] almost 23 years
[1:01:34] and in that pharmacy they had one whole
[1:01:36] section probably as wide as this pulpit
[1:01:39] about yay tall just shelf after chef
[1:01:41] after shelf
[1:01:42] nerve pills
[1:01:45] neurotic pills
[1:01:47] to make people feel better
[1:01:49] amen to help them calm themselves
[1:01:52] well i know a gospel that'll take care
[1:01:55] of all of that
[1:01:57] and it's the gospel of jesus christ
[1:01:59] [Music]
[1:02:02] and you know people were so
[1:02:04] so neurotic that you know they they
[1:02:07] would go crazy if they you know their
[1:02:09] prescription run out and they couldn't
[1:02:10] get it refilled and they just go crazy
[1:02:13] and and and you know get all upset and
[1:02:15] all been out of shape i'm here to tell
[1:02:17] you this gospel ain't never going to run
[1:02:19] out
[1:02:19] [Music]
[1:02:22] brother branham said you get the holy
[1:02:25] ghost and you got everything you need to
[1:02:28] make a rapture
[1:02:30] where's it at it's in the holy ghost
[1:02:33] and you get the holy ghost in you
[1:02:34] tonight and listen you don't have to
[1:02:36] worry about tomorrow you don't have to
[1:02:38] worry about next week you don't have to
[1:02:41] worry about whether you'll make a
[1:02:42] rapture because the holy ghost has
[1:02:45] already provided that rapture is inside
[1:02:48] of you tonight and it will carry you to
[1:02:51] that body change
[1:02:58] oh how am i going to make it
[1:03:01] i got news for you you ain't
[1:03:05] oh brother joe you just said we had
[1:03:06] everything we had need of to make it
[1:03:10] that's because he's already made it for
[1:03:12] you
[1:03:14] [Music]
[1:03:16] i heard the prophet say coming down the
[1:03:18] road
[1:03:20] said if you come and ask him to heal you
[1:03:22] he can't
[1:03:24] if you come and ask him to save you he
[1:03:26] can't do it brother sam
[1:03:30] why
[1:03:31] 2 000 years ago
[1:03:33] on a hill called calvary
[1:03:35] he paid redemption's price and in that
[1:03:39] price was paid for deliverance for joy
[1:03:42] for victory for salvation for healing
[1:03:46] for everything that you have need of
[1:03:48] tonight he has already paid for it all
[1:03:51] we've got to do is accept it this
[1:03:53] evening
[1:03:59] [Music]
[1:04:01] brother joe that's too simple
[1:04:05] well i heard a prophet preach god hides
[1:04:08] himself and reveals himself
[1:04:10] in simplicity
[1:04:19] jesus came
[1:04:21] god in flesh
[1:04:23] and he wrapped himself in a body of
[1:04:25] flesh called jesus christ
[1:04:28] and he spoke a language
[1:04:31] that still causes the translators
[1:04:33] trouble
[1:04:42] they couldn't can't figure out some of
[1:04:43] the words he used
[1:04:45] how do we translate that what what do we
[1:04:47] what do we associate that with
[1:04:49] because he came in simplistic form
[1:04:52] he didn't come with a high education a
[1:04:56] scholarly degree
[1:04:57] amen come down to the priest the high
[1:05:00] priest and say i'm here to take over
[1:05:04] he just did it
[1:05:11] he just did it
[1:05:13] well how did he do it brother joe
[1:05:16] he ripped the veil in twain
[1:05:18] by an earthquake and what did that do
[1:05:21] that showed that we no longer have to
[1:05:24] have a a natural man to go in take an
[1:05:28] offering for us because our offering as
[1:05:30] hung there on calvary's hill he paid the
[1:05:33] price once and for all
[1:05:37] for my past sins for my present sin and
[1:05:40] for my future sins and i no longer have
[1:05:43] to bring a lamb and put my hands on its
[1:05:45] head and watch the the priest slay that
[1:05:48] lamb i just look to jesus and live
[1:05:52] i just go to him and say lord i didn't
[1:05:54] mean to do that i'm sorry i messed up
[1:05:57] i'm sorry i made a mistake and if any
[1:06:00] man calls him he is faithful and just to
[1:06:04] forgive him
[1:06:09] [Applause]
[1:06:13] if we're not careful we'll get that
[1:06:15] catholic spirit on us
[1:06:19] and try to do it by works
[1:06:22] didn't you hear jesus he said it is
[1:06:25] finished
[1:06:26] the work is done
[1:06:28] we don't have to work he did the work
[1:06:31] tonight
[1:06:35] he
[1:06:36] made the way
[1:06:38] in fact he is the way
[1:06:44] [Music]
[1:06:50] luke chapter 4 verse
[1:06:52] 16
[1:06:54] and he came to nazareth where he had
[1:06:56] been brought up
[1:06:57] and as his custom was
[1:07:00] he went into the synagogue on the
[1:07:02] sabbath day and stood up for it to read
[1:07:05] now a lot of people today they say
[1:07:07] well you don't have to go to church you
[1:07:09] can be just as good a christian
[1:07:10] at home
[1:07:12] as you can going to church
[1:07:15] well you need to show them that
[1:07:17] scripture
[1:07:19] he went to the synagogue as his custom
[1:07:22] was
[1:07:24] right
[1:07:26] in other words he didn't go just that
[1:07:28] day and read the scripture and not go no
[1:07:30] more
[1:07:31] he continually went to the temple
[1:07:36] and there was delivered unto him the
[1:07:37] book of the prophet isaiah and when he
[1:07:39] had opened the book
[1:07:40] he found a place where it was written
[1:07:44] he knew what he was looking for
[1:07:48] he was looking for the verse that
[1:07:50] pertained to himself
[1:07:56] i heard a prophet say
[1:07:58] if you can't see christ in every verse
[1:08:01] of the bible you need to read it again
[1:08:05] well what's that got to do with me
[1:08:06] brother joe well you are in christ
[1:08:10] so if you can see christ then you can
[1:08:13] see yourself in him tonight
[1:08:15] so if you can't see yourself in him and
[1:08:18] him in the verses read it again
[1:08:23] verse 18 the spirit of the lord is upon
[1:08:26] me because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:08:29] the gospel to the poor he hath sent me
[1:08:32] to heal the brokenhearted to preach
[1:08:34] deliverance to the captives and
[1:08:36] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[1:08:38] at liberty
[1:08:40] them that are bruised
[1:08:43] to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:08:45] lord and he closed the book and gave it
[1:08:48] again to the minister and sat down and
[1:08:50] the eyes of them all was upon him
[1:08:56] and he began to say to them
[1:08:59] this day
[1:09:00] this scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[1:09:08] i'd like for you to understand something
[1:09:09] tonight church
[1:09:11] that god has once again fulfilled
[1:09:13] scripture
[1:09:15] in this day that we're living in
[1:09:17] he said behold i send unto you
[1:09:22] how many yous do we have in the church
[1:09:26] what about the rest of you are you are
[1:09:28] you
[1:09:29] a y-o-u
[1:09:32] i'm speaking to you and you and you and
[1:09:34] you and you and you and you and you and
[1:09:35] you
[1:09:36] behold i send unto you
[1:09:39] elijah the prophet and he shall turn the
[1:09:42] hearts of the fathers to the children
[1:09:44] and the hearts of the children to the
[1:09:45] fathers lest i come and smite the earth
[1:09:47] with a curse now what he's wanting to do
[1:09:50] is us children turn our faith back to
[1:09:53] the faith of the pentecostal fathers
[1:09:56] now my dad made a statement many years
[1:09:58] ago he said
[1:10:00] and we have it engraved on a plaque
[1:10:02] and that statement was god started his
[1:10:05] church
[1:10:06] like he wanted it
[1:10:08] how did he start it
[1:10:10] they came staggering out of the upper
[1:10:12] room
[1:10:14] under the influence of the holy ghost
[1:10:16] speaking in other tongues
[1:10:19] and they had an experience with god
[1:10:22] that changed mother sam their life
[1:10:25] and it caused him to no longer be afraid
[1:10:28] of the roman guard
[1:10:30] but they had a boldness
[1:10:32] to speak the word of god and to declare
[1:10:36] what christ was and what he had done for
[1:10:39] the people of god
[1:10:43] that's how god started his church
[1:10:46] and the next part of that statement was
[1:10:48] the first part god started his church
[1:10:50] like he wanted it
[1:10:52] and now god wants his church like he
[1:10:55] started it
[1:10:58] god don't want a dead dry formal church
[1:11:02] god wants a church baptized with the
[1:11:05] holy ghost and fire he wants a church
[1:11:08] that is living breathing and moving
[1:11:11] under the auspices of the holy ghost
[1:11:14] he don't want her dead traditional and
[1:11:16] formal he wants her alive this evening
[1:11:20] and the only way we can have that is if
[1:11:22] christ is in that church
[1:11:33] amen
[1:11:40] romans 6 17-18
[1:11:44] but god be thanked
[1:11:46] that you were
[1:11:48] everybody say were
[1:11:51] the servants of sin
[1:11:53] but you have obeyed from the heart
[1:11:56] that form of doctrine which was
[1:11:58] delivered you
[1:12:00] being then made free from sin
[1:12:04] you became the servants of righteousness
[1:12:15] let it settle just a minute
[1:12:18] you obeyed from a heart
[1:12:21] that form of doctrine which was
[1:12:23] delivered to you
[1:12:25] being then made free from sin
[1:12:29] you became the servants of righteousness
[1:12:33] brother dan daisley used to talk about
[1:12:35] going to india
[1:12:37] and he said i've seen a lot of holy men
[1:12:39] so-called in india
[1:12:43] he said you want to see a real holy man
[1:12:47] look up here
[1:12:53] now they
[1:12:54] make themselves holy
[1:12:56] by their actions
[1:12:59] by their
[1:13:01] like the catholics do taking a uh
[1:13:03] scourge and beating themselves on the
[1:13:05] back
[1:13:06] bringing their penance like martin
[1:13:08] luther was climbing up the steps on
[1:13:10] broken glass
[1:13:12] and he read the scripture in romans 8
[1:13:14] the just shall live by faith and the
[1:13:16] revelation struck him he said i don't
[1:13:18] need to do this anymore it's not by
[1:13:20] works it's by faith
[1:13:27] but tonight
[1:13:29] tonight
[1:13:31] we are no longer
[1:13:33] a slave to sin
[1:13:35] we are no longer a slave to works
[1:13:40] because it's not by works that we are
[1:13:42] saved but it's by the grace of god
[1:13:46] amen and i am holy because there is a
[1:13:50] holy god living inside of me it's not by
[1:13:54] my works it's not by my beating myself
[1:13:57] on the back with a with a cord amen it's
[1:14:00] by the righteousness of jesus christ
[1:14:03] tonight he has made me meet to be
[1:14:06] partakers of the gospel of jesus christ
[1:14:09] tonight
[1:14:15] so so many people especially when it
[1:14:16] comes communion time i'm not worthy
[1:14:20] i'm not good enough
[1:14:23] i i i just don't feel worthy
[1:14:26] well can i tell you something you're
[1:14:28] right
[1:14:30] you're right
[1:14:32] you're not
[1:14:34] and you never will be
[1:14:37] [Music]
[1:14:39] but by the blood of jesus christ
[1:14:43] by the shed blood on calvary's heel
[1:14:46] i have been made worthy
[1:14:48] [Music]
[1:14:50] listen whenever that priest or that that
[1:14:53] worshiper came and they brought their
[1:14:55] lamb
[1:14:57] that that priest would say okay is this
[1:14:59] your lamb yes
[1:15:01] let me look at it they look for a
[1:15:03] blemish they look for a
[1:15:05] wrong color hair they look for a bad eye
[1:15:07] they look for a sore anything to
[1:15:10] disqualify that lamb
[1:15:14] and if that lamb was perfect in their
[1:15:16] eyes
[1:15:17] they said okay put your hands on his
[1:15:19] head and we done referred to that but
[1:15:21] we're gonna dramatically give it to you
[1:15:23] just a minute amen put your hands on its
[1:15:26] head and when they did that they
[1:15:28] identified
[1:15:30] themselves with their sacrifice
[1:15:34] i'm here to tell you tonight i have
[1:15:36] identified with my sacrifice
[1:15:39] and god himself testified this is my
[1:15:43] beloved son in whom i am well pleased
[1:15:47] and the prophet said in whom i am
[1:15:50] pleased to dwell
[1:15:52] [Music]
[1:15:56] so tonight i lay my hands upon the head
[1:15:59] of jesus christ
[1:16:01] and i claim his righteousness as my own
[1:16:05] this evening and by that i am perfect in
[1:16:09] the eyes of god
[1:16:11] [Applause]
[1:16:20] [Music]
[1:16:22] ii corinthians 3 17
[1:16:24] now the lord is that spirit
[1:16:27] and where the spirit of the lord is
[1:16:30] there is
[1:16:32] liberty
[1:16:36] i i wonder why you're so free tonight
[1:16:40] [Applause]
[1:16:45] i wonder why you're rejoicing so
[1:16:50] because the spirit of the lord is here
[1:16:53] and he hath made you free
[1:16:56] he has given you a liberty to worship
[1:16:59] him to praise him amen to magnify his
[1:17:03] name and to recognize what he has done
[1:17:06] for you this evening
[1:17:08] he hath made me free

[1:17:28] from the amplified version reads like
[1:17:30] this
[1:17:31] now the lord is the spirit
[1:17:34] and where the spirit of the lord is
[1:17:36] there is liberty
[1:17:39] emancipation
[1:17:40] from bondage
[1:17:42] true
[1:17:43] freedom
[1:17:46] [Music]
[1:17:56] his history shows us amen after that
[1:17:59] emancipation proclamation and after that
[1:18:02] sunrise when the the day of deliverance
[1:18:05] was
[1:18:05] was manifest
[1:18:08] there was not really still freedom
[1:18:11] right
[1:18:12] bear with me
[1:18:14] in that situation
[1:18:16] but i want to tell you tonight
[1:18:19] there ain't no bondages that's going to
[1:18:21] hold me back
[1:18:23] because i am free in christ tonight he
[1:18:27] whom the son hath made free is free
[1:18:30] indeed
[1:18:39] [Music]

[1:18:44] true
[1:18:45] freedom
[1:18:46] where is that it's in the spirit of the
[1:18:49] lord
[1:18:50] amen he hath made us free
[1:18:53] amen
[1:18:54] now matthew 11 2-6
[1:18:57] when john heard
[1:18:59] or or when john's eyes crushed it over
[1:19:01] as brother branham described it he was
[1:19:03] down in prison
[1:19:05] and you know he just
[1:19:07] was wondering and trying to figure out
[1:19:10] whether it was real
[1:19:11] is this the messiah should we look for
[1:19:14] another you know what's going on here
[1:19:18] and the disciples of john that came to
[1:19:20] jesus and said this is what john's
[1:19:22] questioning
[1:19:23] jesus said to them
[1:19:26] go and report to john what you hear and
[1:19:29] see
[1:19:32] the blind receive their sight
[1:19:35] and the lame walk
[1:19:37] the lepers are cleansed
[1:19:40] by healing
[1:19:41] and the death hear and the dead are
[1:19:45] raised and the poor have the gospel
[1:19:48] preached to them and blessed
[1:19:51] joyful
[1:19:53] favored by god is he who does not take
[1:19:56] offense at me
[1:19:58] accepting me as the messiah and trusting
[1:20:02] confidently in my message of salvation
[1:20:07] now that was speaking about jesus christ
[1:20:10] but let's just let's just jump forward
[1:20:12] about two thousand years is that okay
[1:20:23] the death here
[1:20:25] the blind sea
[1:20:29] heard a story about the other day about
[1:20:31] a car being restored that was stolen
[1:20:35] you know the holy ghost arrested the
[1:20:37] thief and he turned around and brought
[1:20:39] the car back to the city it was stolen
[1:20:41] from
[1:20:41] amen
[1:20:43] uh you know the dead er raised all these
[1:20:46] things that that that jesus told the
[1:20:49] disciples to go tell john this is what's
[1:20:51] happening
[1:20:53] amen now what a simple explanation
[1:21:00] what a simple explanation to where
[1:21:02] brother sam is the message true or not
[1:21:12] all these things are happening
[1:21:16] show me in the church
[1:21:20] after they left the word of god where
[1:21:22] all these things are happening in the
[1:21:24] measure that they happen under this
[1:21:26] ministry you can't find it
[1:21:29] because because they they didn't believe
[1:21:32] it they didn't accept it they didn't
[1:21:34] receive it but god restored
[1:21:38] the gifts in the church
[1:21:40] he restored the power in the church
[1:21:43] he restored the word in the church
[1:21:46] and when all those things are restored
[1:21:49] what's going to happen the reality of
[1:21:51] god is going to be made manifest that
[1:21:55] church just like it started on the day
[1:21:56] of pentecost it's in action now
[1:22:00] [Applause]
[1:22:08] and jesus said and blessed
[1:22:11] joyful favored by god is he who does not
[1:22:13] take offense at me
[1:22:16] accepting me as the messiah and trusting
[1:22:19] confidently in my message of salvation
[1:22:22] let's bring it up to date and blessed
[1:22:25] joyful favored by god is he who does not
[1:22:28] take offense in me
[1:22:29] accepting me as the prophet for the 20th
[1:22:32] century
[1:22:33] for the seventh church aids message
[1:22:36] and trusting confidently in my message
[1:22:41] of deliverance
[1:22:44] oh brother joe you're misquoting the
[1:22:46] scripture no i'm just i'm just finding
[1:22:48] myself in the scripture
[1:22:52] is that all right
[1:22:54] i'm just finding myself in the verses of
[1:22:57] the bible
[1:23:04] i don't believe this message because my
[1:23:06] daddy was an usher in the meetings
[1:23:10] i don't believe this message because
[1:23:13] brother branham received a letter from
[1:23:15] my dad
[1:23:16] and said pray for my son he's got a
[1:23:18] condition he was born with a condition
[1:23:20] and brother adam turned the letter over
[1:23:21] and wrote on the back said brother
[1:23:22] greene be faithful pray at nine o'clock
[1:23:25] twelve o'clock and three o'clock and i
[1:23:26] believe your son will be all right and
[1:23:28] he won't need the operation i ain't had
[1:23:31] that operation yet
[1:23:37] i don't believe but
[1:23:39] because
[1:23:40] dad was in all those meetings i don't
[1:23:42] i don't believe
[1:23:44] this message because
[1:23:46] when the hood of death
[1:23:48] was on that lady my dad and mom was
[1:23:51] sitting about three or four rows behind
[1:23:52] that person
[1:23:54] that's not why i believe
[1:23:56] i believe tonight because i have met
[1:24:00] the jesus of this message
[1:24:03] [Applause]
[1:24:04] brother greg he changed my life
[1:24:08] he took an old sinner hard-hearted no
[1:24:11] good full of desires for the world and
[1:24:15] he changed that and he gave me a desire
[1:24:18] to serve god a desire to eat the book
[1:24:21] tonight and by his grace i stand here
[1:24:25] tonight as a trophy of this message
[1:24:30] [Applause]
[1:24:41] i remember the day mom and dad
[1:24:43] were leaving to go to brother branham's
[1:24:45] memorial service
[1:24:47] i remember that just like it was
[1:24:48] yesterday
[1:24:50] i was about four years old
[1:24:52] i was born in 61 that was in 65 66
[1:24:56] so let's see
[1:24:57] five maybe five years old
[1:25:00] i remember that just like it was
[1:25:01] yesterday
[1:25:02] amen
[1:25:04] i didn't have an understanding then
[1:25:06] i didn't know what was going on but as i
[1:25:09] grew and as i gave my heart to the lord
[1:25:12] and i began to listen to the message of
[1:25:14] the hour and i began to recognize this
[1:25:17] is more than a man
[1:25:23] a sister in our church he's going on to
[1:25:25] the lo be with the lord now but she was
[1:25:27] in our church at the time and she went
[1:25:29] to the meetings
[1:25:31] uh this this day this scripture is
[1:25:33] fulfilled
[1:25:34] and uh if you've heard of brother
[1:25:37] the brother with lung cancer what was
[1:25:40] his name from west virginia anyway she
[1:25:42] was next in line behind him and and she
[1:25:45] was actually sitting on the platform
[1:25:47] behind him
[1:25:48] and he he called her out brother stephen
[1:25:51] and said there's there's a woman behind
[1:25:53] me said she's she's not here for herself
[1:25:56] since she's got a daughter that's
[1:25:58] grievously vexed of the devil
[1:26:01] and said mrs orders
[1:26:02] you know our song leader brother mike
[1:26:05] it was his great aunt
[1:26:07] that was there amen
[1:26:09] and and he spoke to her and said mrs
[1:26:12] orders
[1:26:13] go back to north carolina and find your
[1:26:15] daughter well as you believe
[1:26:19] now there's the key
[1:26:21] she oh she was excited she believed it
[1:26:23] but on the way home
[1:26:26] something began to happen and her faith
[1:26:28] began to drop
[1:26:30] and that daughter lived to be in her 70s
[1:26:33] and she never was fully delivered she
[1:26:36] was better but she was never fully do it
[1:26:38] listen they had a jail cell in their
[1:26:40] home she was so violent and so
[1:26:44] just just so destructive they had a jail
[1:26:46] cell she had one of her spells they had
[1:26:48] put her in the cell locked the key
[1:26:50] locked the door and and put the key out
[1:26:52] of her reach amen and she never did get
[1:26:55] delivered because faith dwindled
[1:26:59] and that that tells you enough tonight
[1:27:01] we need to make sure that our faith is
[1:27:03] true and pure and not dwindling
[1:27:07] don't look at the circumstances don't
[1:27:09] look at the situation look at the
[1:27:12] promise of the word of god
[1:27:16] because the word has power
[1:27:21] your doubts don't
[1:27:23] [Music]
[1:27:25] well they have power to make you miss
[1:27:27] the promise
[1:27:28] but they don't have power to perform the
[1:27:30] promise but the word tonight is a is a
[1:27:35] oh it's quick and powerful and sharper
[1:27:38] than a two-edged sword dividing us under
[1:27:41] the thoughts the bone the marrow and all
[1:27:43] those things amen so what we've got to
[1:27:46] do is not let our faith waver
[1:27:51] [Music]
[1:27:53] when the centurion came
[1:27:56] to jesus what did jesus say
[1:27:58] only belief
[1:27:59] [Music]
[1:28:01] and on the way there when the the
[1:28:03] messenger came and said trouble not the
[1:28:05] master
[1:28:07] your daughter's dead
[1:28:09] and i can imagine that centurion
[1:28:12] looking at jesus
[1:28:15] and jesus
[1:28:17] only believe
[1:28:20] don't doubt
[1:28:21] it's going to be okay
[1:28:23] [Music]
[1:28:25] you know when jesus went down to the
[1:28:27] pool of bethesda
[1:28:30] and he found this man that had been
[1:28:32] laying there for 30 and eight years
[1:28:35] right a long time
[1:28:38] and the waters were troubled many many
[1:28:40] times and that in that time frame and he
[1:28:43] struggled to get to the water but he
[1:28:45] couldn't make it
[1:28:47] but when jesus come in there
[1:28:49] and he began to speak to him
[1:28:51] and listen in layman's terms you know
[1:28:53] what he said

[1:42:26] and the heart do you see what signal
[1:42:28] he's giving me
[1:42:30] [Music]
[1:42:37] hallelujah
[1:42:39] look on verse 10
[1:42:41] chapter 10 verse 1 roman
[1:42:44] paul is saying this i was just reading
[1:42:46] it at work
[1:42:50] he said brethren
[1:42:51] my heart's desire
[1:42:53] and prayer
[1:42:55] to god
[1:42:56] he has a desire
[1:42:58] and a prayer
[1:43:00] he wanted something to happen but he
[1:43:02] didn't stop at the desire
[1:43:04] he went with it in prayer
[1:43:08] look just one verse how he changed
[1:43:11] he said my heart desire and prayer
[1:43:14] to god for who
[1:43:17] is that there might be
[1:43:19] so israel was saved
[1:43:24] if you're praying for somebody to be
[1:43:26] saved
[1:43:27] that means they are not saved
[1:43:31] right
[1:43:32] look at that people let's look at these
[1:43:34] people that are not saved
[1:43:36] how are day
[1:43:38] verse two
[1:43:39] for i bear them who's them
[1:43:42] i bear them record that they have water
[1:43:46] as hell is a zeal to who
[1:43:49] but were they saved
[1:43:55] you see
[1:43:58] but not according to water
[1:44:01] for there being water
[1:44:04] zealous for god but ignorant
[1:44:12] zealous for god
[1:44:13] but ignorant
[1:44:16] ignorant of god's righteousness
[1:44:20] what brother
[1:44:22] joe labor tonight
[1:44:25] and going about to establish their own
[1:44:30] you see the
[1:44:32] mistake put your car
[1:44:37] there is nothing you have to do
[1:44:41] and going about to establish their own
[1:44:44] righteousness
[1:44:45] have not submitted themselves
[1:44:49] unto the righteousness of who
[1:44:51] so when you try to establish your own
[1:44:54] righteousness
[1:44:55] automatically
[1:44:57] you are showing your insubordination
[1:45:01] to the righteousness of god
[1:45:03] because you want to do it yourself
[1:45:06] and you're going to suffer
[1:45:08] amen
[1:45:09] for christ
[1:45:11] is the end of the water
[1:45:13] so the law has an end
[1:45:15] you want to stop the law in your life
[1:45:18] where do you have to reach
[1:45:23] for christ is the end of the law for
[1:45:25] righteousness to everyone
[1:45:29] that understand
[1:45:39] to everyone that do whatever
[1:45:42] simple
[1:45:44] the simplicity of the gospel
[1:45:47] is what you knock the devil with
[1:45:52] easy
[1:45:53] easy let me stop there the other one
[1:45:55] we're going to get it on sunday maybe
[1:45:58] amen
[1:45:59] it's so simple church
[1:46:01] you can manufacture this
[1:46:04] you can push this
[1:46:06] you cannot bring it in your briefcase
[1:46:09] you're not going to be able to do it god
[1:46:11] have his own program
[1:46:14] fall into line
[1:46:16] surrender yourself
[1:46:18] just believe
[1:46:21] just believe
[1:46:24] and you're going to see what god will do
[1:46:27] i told you about justification
[1:46:30] you can knock the devil out
[1:46:33] just by faith
[1:46:35] what did luther have
[1:46:36] more than that
[1:46:40] what else did luther have
[1:46:42] you have more than looter
[1:46:44] it's so easy the message that's why you
[1:46:46] hear me saying all the time the message
[1:46:49] is not complicated
[1:46:51] it is very simple
[1:46:53] very very simple until brother branham
[1:46:55] explained everything into a detail
[1:46:58] and you can grasp it you say god now i
[1:47:00] see it
[1:47:01] amen
[1:47:02] it is not your work you didn't start it
[1:47:05] god
[1:47:06] started and god is going to finish it
[1:47:09] the way he started
[1:47:15] hallelujah
[1:47:17] he's going to finish it the way that he
[1:47:19] started
[1:47:21] he made the way
[1:47:22] you didn't do it
[1:47:24] just believe
[1:47:25] like the brothers say who want to be you
[1:47:28] raise your hand
[1:47:29] that simple hand
[1:47:31] can get devil out of your house
[1:47:36] we want to do work
[1:47:38] we want to fast 20 days
[1:47:41] so when you come out there everybody's
[1:47:43] watching what happened you lose pond
[1:47:45] that was fasting
[1:47:50] doesn't want it
[1:47:53] do you want to get well
[1:47:58] no you know the situation is like i
[1:48:00] didn't ask that do you want to get where
[1:48:05] yes
[1:48:06] walls up there
[1:48:09] take up your bed and just go
[1:48:13] is it complicated
[1:48:16] how many devils did jesus get out of
[1:48:18] that
[1:48:21] how many therefore did jesus cast out
[1:48:23] because we expect jesus to stand and say
[1:48:26] you demon of paralysis you did one of i
[1:48:28] believe it was prostate come out and
[1:48:30] this come out and come out now was an
[1:48:32] hour walk

[1:48:36] yes
[1:48:37] see you
[1:48:42] i'm a man under authority
[1:48:44] speak the word that's what you want
[1:48:48] go ahead
[1:48:51] son of god you're a dog
[1:48:54] do you think jesus was calling him a dog
[1:48:57] by any chance
[1:49:00] do you know what jesus was doing
[1:49:03] he was telling her
[1:49:04] this is your healing
[1:49:07] okay i'm gonna give you the key
[1:49:09] to your healing
[1:49:11] take it
[1:49:13] sometimes his key comes different
[1:49:20] if you pick it up you say it's a dog you
[1:49:22] throw it away
[1:49:23] you don't understand he cannot call you
[1:49:25] dog just like that who made that woman
[1:49:29] understand the revelation of a dog
[1:49:34] who started to name the name dog
[1:49:37] the woman
[1:49:39] why did he start it why he didn't say
[1:49:41] you parrot
[1:49:46] when he's calling you there is something
[1:49:49] there
[1:49:50] he just handed her the key like hey the
[1:49:52] door is tight here and you keep pressing
[1:49:56] and because you're pressing i need to
[1:49:58] find something
[1:49:59] to reach out in his pocket
[1:50:01] dog
[1:50:02] take it
[1:50:03] and the woman take you say thank you
[1:50:06] i am really a dog
[1:50:08] and then the revelation when you accept
[1:50:11] what he tells you
[1:50:13] then the package unfold
[1:50:18] once once you accept it when you say
[1:50:20] this message is true then the message
[1:50:23] package unfold
[1:50:26] then you receive the revelation
[1:50:29] of the package that you receive
[1:50:32] that yes i am a dog
[1:50:34] and i take the crumbs
[1:50:38] that fell from the master table jesus
[1:50:41] stop
[1:50:42] say this one you must receive it from
[1:50:45] somewhere
[1:50:49] go
[1:50:50] your daughter
[1:50:52] did he cast out devils
[1:50:55] that's the gentile faith
[1:50:57] but random top that woman with hardy
[1:51:00] right
[1:51:02] church we have a true and living god
[1:51:05] you don't need me to pray for you
[1:51:07] because the preaching of that word was
[1:51:10] removing devils
[1:51:13] if you don't believe then we can lay
[1:51:15] hand on you like jewish
[1:51:17] until you get to the gentile
[1:51:21] if you want to i don't mind it we can
[1:51:23] still lay hand
[1:51:24] but the preaching of the gospel the way
[1:51:26] that anointing was flowing here
[1:51:31] just go home believe you're going to see
[1:51:33] some of the stuff you didn't even
[1:51:35] mention
[1:51:36] will be gone
[1:51:39] amen
[1:51:41] amen just remember that some of the
[1:51:43] stuff you didn't even mention
[1:51:45] [Music]
[1:51:47] if jesus would stand on the cross to
[1:51:50] count your your sin
[1:51:52] how long will it take how many days will
[1:51:54] it take
[1:51:56] and to count all the sicknesses and the
[1:51:58] syndrome and all the stuff how many
[1:52:04] seven names compound of jehovah jehovah
[1:52:08] rapha jehovah nisi jehovah chicano
[1:52:11] jehovah this this this god say let me
[1:52:14] make it simple
[1:52:15] he took all of them
[1:52:17] mix it together
[1:52:18] and put one
[1:52:20] just get one
[1:52:23] when you're saying jesus
[1:52:25] when jesus comes
[1:52:27] he's gonna look when the word jesus
[1:52:29] comes to you
[1:52:30] he screams you
[1:52:32] and he says what they wanted is
[1:52:35] something to be provided then jehovah
[1:52:37] jairo pull off
[1:52:40] if he looks at you he says this is not
[1:52:42] jehovah it's a situation of sickness
[1:52:45] then refer pull off
[1:52:50] that's why when you say jesus
[1:52:53] that's it
[1:52:55] jesus then the baby resurrected they
[1:52:57] didn't say jesus the baby resurrect
[1:52:59] when they said jesus jesus went there
[1:53:01] and look and say this is what is going
[1:53:04] on resurrection up so when the word is
[1:53:07] preached
