[46:13] unless you go sit with somebody who
[46:15] really really really really was paying
[46:16] attention and they can tell you
[46:18] everything all over amen
[46:20] blessed be the name of the lord so let's
[46:22] go to our scripture this morning
[46:25] it's going to be genesis chapter 14.
[46:30] yeah that was a heavy meal
[46:33] last sunday
[46:35] when you get to the mathematics of god
[46:38] it's a problem
[46:40] but don't worry one of this day we will
[46:42] sit and talk to you about how the math
[46:44] in the bible works
[46:46] amen
[46:47] do you know that even your name have
[46:49] numbers
[46:52] your name have numbers there is a way
[46:54] they read numbers in the name
[46:58] you see there is more in this message
[47:00] than you even think amen
[47:03] blessed be the name of the lord
[47:05] oh my let me just leave that alone
[47:08] genesis 14.
[47:12] if you dare you can say amen
[47:15] genesis 14
[47:17] verse 18. you know this very well
[47:20] and you need this
[47:22] because
[47:23] to get to the holy place you definitely
[47:26] have to understand melchizedek
[47:29] and i believe we went through
[47:30] melchizedek before you should have an
[47:32] idea who melchizedek is amen
[47:36] amen verse 18
[47:38] and
[47:39] melchizedek
[47:41] king of who
[47:43] you know what it means right you might
[47:44] be seated
[47:47] now pay attention because your boss is
[47:50] reviewing this so we don't want to miss
[47:52] you
[47:58] if you have reviewed the sermon then it
[48:00] will be easy on you
[48:02] amen
[48:03] and melchizedek king of selima
[48:08] this man called melchizedek
[48:11] we went through this before
[48:13] depending on the old testament or new
[48:16] testament there is a way to write it but
[48:18] he's a king a king of selem which was
[48:22] speaking about jerusalem not the earthly
[48:25] but the heavenly because at that time
[48:27] jerusalem was not even existing amen
[48:31] king of selem
[48:33] brought forth water
[48:35] bread and water
[48:37] this man when he came to
[48:40] oh brother robert is getting that
[48:42] quickly
[48:43] bread
[48:44] and what
[48:49] amen
[48:50] he brought forth bread
[48:52] and wine
[48:54] and he was the priest
[48:57] of the most high god so this man was not
[49:01] only a king as you know already but he
[49:04] was also a priest so every time you see
[49:07] priest
[49:08] connected with king
[49:11] you already know that he's speaking
[49:12] about who
[49:14] that's how you read the bible so when
[49:16] you see king priest automatically
[49:18] melchizedek
[49:20] amen
[49:22] verse 19 and he blessed him and say
[49:26] blessed be abram
[49:28] of the most high god
[49:30] possessor of heaven and earth
[49:33] and blessed be the most high god
[49:36] it looks like he's blessing himself
[49:38] blessed be the most high god
[49:41] which has delivered your enemies
[49:44] into your hand
[49:46] this is not a visitor
[49:50] this is a family member
[49:52] that's why i say i welcome all the
[49:54] family members but i need to give a
[49:56] special attention
[49:58] we got brother sam's daughter and her
[50:01] family here
[50:02] god rich you bless you and welcome
[50:07] amen
[50:08] they move down here so they're living
[50:10] very close by so you saw them on
[50:13] wednesday when i say his family members
[50:15] sometimes we don't get it but family
[50:17] member means really family member so
[50:20] you're not visitor here we already knew
[50:22] one another before the foundation of the
[50:24] world long long long time ago amen
[50:28] all you have to do is just talk to
[50:29] somebody before you know it it looks
[50:31] like
[50:32] like i know you 10 years yes we know
[50:34] each other from eternity right my
[50:36] brother so you're welcome there is no
[50:37] visitor amen
[50:39] blessed be the name of the lord and
[50:41] blessed be the most high god verse 20
[50:44] which has delivered your enemies into
[50:47] your hand
[50:48] and he gave him tithe of all everybody
[50:52] clear there i'm not going to preach on
[50:54] path you already know what it means
[50:56] let's go to genesis chapter 28.
[51:00] if you're not doing it that's between
[51:02] you and your god
[51:10] so genesis 14 king priest that
[51:13] combination speak about melchizedek
[51:15] which we know melchizedek is guarding
[51:17] tiophony everybody clear now we already
[51:20] went through this this is god in
[51:22] tiophony
[51:23] and he often speak of the word
[51:26] the word body
[51:28] of god amen
[51:31] or the pillar of fire
[51:33] genesis 28 verse 10. if you dare you can
[51:36] say amen
[51:38] and jacob went out from beersheba
[51:42] and went toward heron
[51:44] so he's fleeing because his brother is
[51:47] trying to kill him
[51:48] he stole the blessing everybody okay
[51:51] verse 11 and he lighted up on a certain
[51:54] place
[51:55] and terry there
[51:57] all night
[51:58] so he got to a certain place at the
[52:00] sunset because he was traveling they
[52:03] were
[52:04] he was going by the light of the day
[52:06] which is the sun but it reached a point
[52:09] where the sunset began to come in and he
[52:12] stopped to a place and the night was
[52:14] there so the light changed from the
[52:16] light of the sun to the light of the
[52:18] star
[52:22] at night you don't have the sun
[52:25] at night you have the stars
[52:28] so jacob is in this place at night
[52:31] so the sun is no longer shining what is
[52:34] shining now is depending on the light of
[52:36] the star
[52:39] that's how you read the bible
[52:42] amen you don't just read at night and
[52:44] you continue that's why brother branham
[52:46] said you don't read the bible like a
[52:48] newspaper
[52:49] he said and he lighted up on a certain
[52:51] place and tarry there all night under
[52:54] the light of the stars
[52:57] because the sun was water
[53:00] so the sun is no longer there so knights
[53:03] speak of the absence of the sun
[53:06] and the reflection of the star everybody
[53:09] so when you see a star automatically you
[53:11] know that we are at night
[53:13] you need to depend on the light of the
[53:15] star to help you move in
[53:18] we okay now because the sun is not there
[53:21] but the star are speaking of the sun
[53:24] that is somewhere
[53:25] everybody okay
[53:26] because the sun was set
[53:29] and he took off the stones of that place
[53:32] so that place was filled with stones
[53:34] and put them for his pillows some of us
[53:37] don't even want to sleep with a pillow
[53:40] because it's uncomfortable sometimes now
[53:43] this man uses stone for a pillow
[53:46] how can you put a stone for a pillow
[53:49] is that comfortable
[53:51] how can his head rest on the stone
[53:55] which is a rock
[53:58] that's why brother branham say put your
[54:00] head in the word
[54:04] amen
[54:09] and he amen off the stone of that place
[54:12] and put them for pillows
[54:15] and lay down in that place to sleep
[54:18] sleeping on the stone
[54:21] and he dreamed and behold
[54:25] a ladder
[54:27] set up on the earth
[54:29] and the top
[54:31] the top of it reached to heaven so there
[54:34] is a connection between our heaven and
[54:35] earth
[54:36] and behold the angels of god
[54:39] ascending and descending on it ever
[54:43] clear
[54:44] and behold the lord stood above it right
[54:47] on top in heaven and say i am the lord
[54:50] god of abraham
[54:52] your father
[54:53] and the god of isaac
[54:55] the land whereon you lie
[54:58] to you will i give it and to your seed
[55:01] he's repeating the same thing he told
[55:02] abraham
[55:04] verse 14 and your seed shall be as the
[55:06] dust of the earth he already told
[55:08] abraham this and you shall spread the
[55:10] broad to the west
[55:12] and to the east and to the north and to
[55:14] the south the fourth point and in you
[55:17] and in your seed shall all the families
[55:20] of the earth be blessed the same
[55:22] blessing of abraham has been handed down
[55:25] to somebody
[55:26] verse 15 and behold i am with you
[55:29] and will keep you in all places
[55:33] wherever you go
[55:34] what a protection
[55:36] and will bring you again into this land
[55:39] for i will not leave you
[55:42] until i have done that which i have
[55:45] spoken to you off amen
[55:48] what a promise verse 16 and jacob
[55:52] awakened out of his sleep and he said
[55:54] surely the lord is in this place and i
[55:58] knew it not
[56:00] and he was afraid and say how dreadful
[56:04] how awesome is this place
[56:06] this is no other but the house of god so
[56:10] he recognized that that place was the
[56:13] house of god
[56:14] what do you do in the house of god amen
[56:17] and this is the gate of heaven everybody
[56:21] okay
[56:23] and jacob rose up early in the morning
[56:26] and took the stone one
[56:29] that he had put for his pillows
[56:32] ever here and set it up for a pillar so
[56:35] the stone turned into a pillar
[56:38] a memorial
[56:39] ever here it was a stone for him to put
[56:42] his head now that stone is immorphy into
[56:45] a memorial good to see you mama
[56:47] amen
[56:49] he's turned into a memorial amen
[56:52] and then he poured oil
[56:55] upon the top of it everybody clear
[56:59] he poured oil upon the top of it
[57:04] and he called the name of that place
[57:06] bethel
[57:08] ever care
[57:09] but the name of that city was called
[57:12] lowe's
[57:13] at first everybody care so jacob rose
[57:17] what he did he set up the pillow and he
[57:20] took oil and he poured upon the top of
[57:22] it he consecrated that place everybody
[57:25] clear and that place became the place of
[57:27] god verse 20 and jacob vowed a vow
[57:31] saying if god will be with me and will
[57:34] keep me in this day that i go i will
[57:37] give and will give me bread to eat and
[57:40] remnant to put on so that i come again
[57:43] to my father's house in peace then shall
[57:46] the lord be my god and the stone which i
[57:49] have set for a pillar shall be god's
[57:52] water
[57:53] house and all that you shall give me i
[57:56] will surely give the tenth to you who
[57:59] taught him that
[58:02] abraham gave the tenth this one give the
[58:04] ten who taught him that
[58:09] let's go to second samuel chapter 23
[58:11] then we pray
[58:16] melchizedek bread
[58:18] and wine
[58:20] jacob oil pour on top of a stone
[58:28] with jacob we have oil
[58:35] it out
[58:38] everybody
[58:40] second samuel chapter 23 verse 15. if
[58:43] you're there you can say amen
[58:46] and david longed
[58:50] it was just his desire
[58:53] he didn't force anybody
[58:56] david longed
[58:57] and said
[58:59] oh
[59:00] that one will give me drink off the
[59:03] water
[59:04] of the well of bethlehem which is by the
[59:07] gay did he designated anybody
[59:12] he just said i wish somebody can give me
[59:14] water from bethlehem
[59:17] for some reason
[59:18] somebody when they heard that
[59:21] something in them
[59:23] turned on
[59:25] amen
[59:26] and the three mighty men who told them
[59:29] to go
[59:30] david just wished somebody could give it
[59:32] to him
[59:34] but the wish turned into a command
[59:37] everybody
[59:39] somebody heard the wish say oh he's just
[59:41] wishing that's fine i keep going my way
[59:44] somebody else heard he said
[59:46] that's not a wish that's not really a
[59:48] wish i need to go get the water for my
[59:50] team
[59:51] one got into action
[59:53] one just heard and continued doing what
[59:55] he was doing amen
[59:58] and the three men mighty man broke
[1:00:00] through the host they begin to do some
[1:00:03] work some labor
[1:00:04] he was not a host where you're going

[1:00:20] the host of the philistine
[1:00:22] and drew
[1:00:24] water out of the well of bethlehem
[1:00:29] karma that was by the gate
[1:00:33] and took it and brought it to david
[1:00:36] nevertheless
[1:00:38] he would not drink thereof
[1:00:41] but he did what
[1:00:43] he poured it out to him
[1:00:46] so david gave god an offering of
[1:00:51] water
[1:00:53] so the offering is not only an animal
[1:00:56] or a beast
[1:00:58] an offering can be also in liquid form

[1:01:29] is not this the blood that water when
[1:01:32] david is looking at that
[1:01:34] to him it's a bladder
[1:01:39] the water that you're looking at water
[1:01:41] david is calling that it's a blood
[1:01:44] it's a blood because it took some
[1:01:46] sacrifice
[1:01:48] it took some work
[1:01:50] it took some labor it took somebody's
[1:01:53] sweating
[1:01:55] everybody
[1:01:56] to bring the water so it's no longer
[1:01:58] water it turned into blood
[1:02:00] and that blood turned into an offering
[1:02:03] unto the lord
[1:02:04] okay
[1:02:06] and he says
[1:02:07] is not this the blood of the man that
[1:02:10] went in jeopardy of their lives
[1:02:12] therefore he would not drink it these
[1:02:15] things did these three mighty men
[1:02:18] melchizedek brought bread and wine
[1:02:21] jacob brought oil and poured that out
[1:02:24] and david water and poured that out
[1:02:28] let's pray heavenly father

[1:03:49] jesus christ
[1:03:51] amen
[1:03:52] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:03:56] the bible says in the book of hebrews 13
[1:03:58] here that wherefore jesus also
[1:04:01] that he must sanctify the people with
[1:04:05] water
[1:04:06] with his own blood
[1:04:08] suffer without the gate so the blood
[1:04:12] is what sanctifiers
[1:04:14] my subject this morning
[1:04:16] is the four phases of roof
[1:04:19] the drink offering
[1:04:23] everybody okay if you notice we still
[1:04:25] have the table of the showbread but we
[1:04:28] see jacob there pouring oil upon a stone
[1:04:32] but here
[1:04:33] when we started this series in the roof
[1:04:36] we found out that the tabernacle have a
[1:04:39] language of the plan of redemption that
[1:04:42] man that god is trying to save man or
[1:04:45] god is trying to bring man unto himself
[1:04:48] amen and we took roof and through the
[1:04:51] stages of roof we found out how roof
[1:04:53] moves into the gate her roof moves
[1:04:56] straight and enter into the uh into the
[1:05:00] tabernacle and then begin to interact
[1:05:02] with the brazen altar which is
[1:05:04] repentance and from there he moved she
[1:05:07] moves into the level from the level she
[1:05:09] enter into the holy place where we are
[1:05:13] now roof is in the holy place or roof
[1:05:16] under
[1:05:17] luther on the wesley roof under
[1:05:20] sanctification roof serving or roof
[1:05:22] under armenian amen
[1:05:25] now
[1:05:26] brother branham says this just as a
[1:05:28] remember he said christ is in all the
[1:05:31] old testament
[1:05:33] in all the old testament that's why
[1:05:36] brother branham said if you read the
[1:05:37] bible you don't see jesus christ what do
[1:05:39] you have to do you need to go back again
[1:05:41] and read it again amen because christ is
[1:05:44] the very theme of the entire bible
[1:05:48] brother branham say had the hazard
[1:05:51] and the cedarwood and all mixing
[1:05:54] together had the wood in the tabernacle
[1:05:57] had the brazen altar deliver the
[1:06:00] showbread which we touched on last
[1:06:02] sunday everything is pointing to
[1:06:06] christ everybody here
[1:06:08] and they so when you look at the tab and
[1:06:11] i call it crust
[1:06:12] when you look at the gate it's crushed
[1:06:14] when you look at the door it's cast when
[1:06:17] you look at abraham it's christ you look
[1:06:19] at david's castle you look at joseph's
[1:06:22] crust everything that you're looking in
[1:06:25] the entire book of the bible is speaking
[1:06:28] about jesus christ
[1:06:30] ever here but you need to read christ
[1:06:37] everybody okay
[1:06:38] because the crust in the showbread
[1:06:41] is a different crust than the crust in
[1:06:44] the river but it's still the same person
[1:06:49] i'm refreshing so i pick up whoever i
[1:06:52] lost last week everybody okay so far
[1:06:55] the crust in the brazen altar is
[1:06:58] different than the christ in the ark of
[1:07:00] the covenant but both of them are still
[1:07:03] speaking about christ
[1:07:05] their brother stephen in this church now
[1:07:08] is different than the brother stephen in
[1:07:10] eagle chamber dentistry
[1:07:13] but he's still the same person the
[1:07:15] brother stephen here is a pastor the
[1:07:18] brother stephen tomorrow he's going to
[1:07:20] be a dentist
[1:07:22] but he's still the same person
[1:07:24] if you come on my work tomorrow you will
[1:07:27] see me pulling teeth out
[1:07:29] but if you come here this morning you
[1:07:31] will see me preaching the gospel so you
[1:07:33] need to know how you approach me whether
[1:07:36] you want to approach me as a doctor or
[1:07:38] you want to approach me as a pastor or
[1:07:41] you want to approach me as a brother or
[1:07:43] you want to approach me as a neighbor or
[1:07:45] you want to approach me as a father or
[1:07:48] you want to approach me as a husband oh
[1:07:50] you want to approach me as
[1:07:54] anybody okay depending on how you
[1:07:57] interact with me
[1:07:59] but i'm still the same person
[1:08:01] so christa is the showbread christ is
[1:08:04] delivered christ is the house of
[1:08:06] christies everything into the tabernacle
[1:08:10] now when we looked at the way the
[1:08:12] tabernacle was placed on the on the
[1:08:14] wilderness the tabernacle was placed
[1:08:17] right in the middle of israel and all
[1:08:20] the camp of israel were camping all the
[1:08:23] tribe were camping all around over there
[1:08:26] everybody here and the interest of the
[1:08:29] tabernacle was from the east
[1:08:31] and now we're talking about melchizedek
[1:08:33] i need to stress up this one
[1:08:35] if you coming into the east
[1:08:38] and you're trying to enter into the
[1:08:40] tabernacle you need to put your seat
[1:08:42] belt because we're going up everybody
[1:08:44] okay when you're coming from the east
[1:08:46] and you're trying to enter into the gate
[1:08:49] of the tabernacle you don't just come
[1:08:51] and enter into the gate
[1:08:53] you are actually crossing certain parts
[1:08:56] of the camp of israel
[1:08:58] before you enter into the gate my
[1:09:01] brother in the computer stay tight
[1:09:03] everybody here so when you are
[1:09:05] approaching over there for some reason
[1:09:07] when god told israel to camp around the
[1:09:10] tabernacle god told israel that the camp
[1:09:13] of judah
[1:09:14] should camp on the east side
[1:09:17] everybody here and this camp of judah
[1:09:20] here was a camp that was given the
[1:09:23] promise for kingship
[1:09:26] in other words all the king of israel
[1:09:29] must come through judah
[1:09:32] did i lost you
[1:09:34] so judah
[1:09:35] is a tribe
[1:09:37] that is responsible to produce king in
[1:09:40] israel
[1:09:41] anybody care and for some reason
[1:09:44] once you cross this tribe responsible
[1:09:47] for king as you begin to move you found
[1:09:50] out that before you enter the tabernacle
[1:09:53] there is a lever that is step right
[1:09:56] there
[1:09:57] everybody here and deliver toward the
[1:10:00] priest
[1:10:04] amen did i lose you
[1:10:06] are we okay so far you need to stay
[1:10:08] awake amen
[1:10:10] so delivered was the tribe that was
[1:10:13] producing the priest
[1:10:15] so before you enter the tabernacle of
[1:10:18] god you are crossing the king
[1:10:23] everybody okay then you cross the priest
[1:10:26] then you arrive at the gate
[1:10:29] but when you have a combination of a
[1:10:31] king and a priest
[1:10:33] it is speaking about her
[1:10:36] everybody okay so far this is how you
[1:10:38] read the tabernacle did i lose anybody
[1:10:41] anybody care so far and then as soon as
[1:10:44] you move right there you find that under
[1:10:48] this priest
[1:10:49] you have liver himself you have moses
[1:10:52] and you have aaron because the bible
[1:10:55] says that moses and aaron are the
[1:10:57] priests of the lord moses was a prophet
[1:11:00] but according to psalm 99 verse 6 the
[1:11:03] bible says moses and aaron among his
[1:11:06] water
[1:11:07] there were certain other livers that
[1:11:09] were there among around the tabernacle
[1:11:12] but those levers were not priests
[1:11:15] anybody here you can be a levite and not
[1:11:18] being a priest but you cannot be a
[1:11:20] priest if you are not a leaver
[1:11:22] you remember that so far so as you enter
[1:11:25] in the tabernacle you are crossing the
[1:11:27] king and you are crossing the priest and
[1:11:30] as soon as you finish that
[1:11:33] the next thing that follows you is what
[1:11:36] is the gate
[1:11:37] now in hebrew chapter 7 verse 1
[1:11:40] the bible says for this melchizedek who
[1:11:44] is king of salem we already seen that in
[1:11:46] genesis 14
[1:11:48] and priest of the most high god who met
[1:11:51] abraham returning from the slaughter of
[1:11:53] the king and bless him to whom also
[1:11:56] abraham gave what
[1:11:58] the tenth part of all first being by
[1:12:01] interpretation king of righteousness
[1:12:06] so melchizedek
[1:12:09] has a problem
[1:12:11] melchizedek
[1:12:13] if i can get another one
[1:12:15] he's king
[1:12:16] of righteousness
[1:12:19] everybody okay
[1:12:21] he's king of righteousness
[1:12:23] and after that also he's king of water
[1:12:28] king of selem which means kings of water
[1:12:31] so melchizedek is king of righteousness
[1:12:35] and his king of peace
[1:12:37] in other words under melchizedek
[1:12:40] we have two kings
[1:12:42] [Music]
[1:12:45] everybody here so far
[1:12:47] melchizedek is king of righteousness the
[1:12:50] first kingship and he is also king of
[1:12:53] peace the two kings are under
[1:12:55] melchizedek
[1:12:57] everybody okay so far i'm trying to
[1:12:59] catch you up over there
[1:13:00] in romans 14 verse 17 the bible says
[1:13:04] that the kingdom of god
[1:13:07] when we talk about the kingdom of god
[1:13:11] we have a kingdom the kingdom of god the
[1:13:14] bible said the kingdom of god is not
[1:13:18] meat
[1:13:19] and drink
[1:13:21] when you take meat
[1:13:24] and drink
[1:13:26] everybody okay
[1:13:27] this is in the natural
[1:13:30] everybody okay so the kingdom of god is
[1:13:33] not meat
[1:13:35] over there and it's not drink but what
[1:13:38] is it
[1:13:39] the bible says but
[1:13:42] it is righteousness
[1:13:45] everybody okay
[1:13:47] amen
[1:13:48] and it is water
[1:13:51] anybody okay
[1:13:52] and melchizedek is king of water
[1:13:56] and he's king of water
[1:13:58] so the kingdom of god is home
[1:14:05] everybody okay so far
[1:14:06] are we coming okay
[1:14:09] everybody okay so far
[1:14:11] so mercy said that the kingdom of god is
[1:14:14] not really a natural meat
[1:14:17] and a natural drink because we know that
[1:14:20] when melchizedek met abraham
[1:14:23] he brought abraham water
[1:14:28] bread is a meat
[1:14:31] and wine is a drink
[1:14:33] [Music]
[1:14:34] everybody okay
[1:14:36] we found out that the kingdom of god is
[1:14:39] not meat and drink but yet when
[1:14:41] melchizedek met abraham he gave him
[1:14:44] bread
[1:14:45] and he gave him wine
[1:14:47] and wine is a drink
[1:14:50] and bread is a meat
[1:14:56] anybody okay so the kingdom of god
[1:14:59] is not meat and drink but it's
[1:15:02] righteousness come on it's peace and
[1:15:05] it's water
[1:15:08] righteousness and peace speak about
[1:15:10] melchizedek
[1:15:11] what about joy in the holy ghost
[1:15:16] speak of what
[1:15:17] we figure it out anybody here so far
[1:15:20] brother brown says this
[1:15:24] brother problem says this he says
[1:15:28] if you notice here when you pass the
[1:15:30] king
[1:15:31] when you pass the priest which is
[1:15:33] melchizedek what follows straight after
[1:15:36] that is the gate
[1:15:38] in other words once you cross
[1:15:40] melchizedek everybody okay
[1:15:43] the next station that follows in the
[1:15:45] tabernacle is the gate
[1:15:48] and we know that jesus said straight is
[1:15:50] the gate because the gate was jesus
[1:15:53] christ himself ever here so when you
[1:15:56] coming to enter the tabernacle
[1:15:59] you are crossing first god
[1:16:02] in his revelation as melchizedek
[1:16:05] everybody okay
[1:16:06] but melchizedek will turn into a gate
[1:16:15] brother branham says this
[1:16:17] brother bonham said to remember that
[1:16:19] great melchizedek bucky under who had no
[1:16:23] beginning of days
[1:16:25] he never had a father
[1:16:27] nor a mother everybody here he never had
[1:16:30] an end of life
[1:16:32] that still lives today
[1:16:34] then was what
[1:16:36] kisadek was incarnated
[1:16:40] anybody okay
[1:16:42] called jesus christ he became flesh
[1:16:46] died
[1:16:47] went back to it again he's still the
[1:16:50] king of peace the king of righteousness
[1:16:53] promising us these great eternal things
[1:16:57] brother branham said in this message in
[1:17:00] the message who is this melchizedek
[1:17:02] he said he was at the beginning the word
[1:17:06] and in morphe body which is the
[1:17:08] theophany he came in and lived in that
[1:17:12] in the person of melchizedek everybody
[1:17:15] okay
[1:17:16] then later we never heard no more of
[1:17:19] melchizedek
[1:17:20] because he became who
[1:17:23] melchizedek was the priest but he became
[1:17:26] who
[1:17:27] so as you move from the from the tribe
[1:17:31] of judah and from the tribe of
[1:17:35] of liver as you live in melchizedek the
[1:17:38] first thing that receives you in the
[1:17:40] tabernacle is the gate because
[1:17:43] melchizedek
[1:17:44] will become the gate merchandiser that
[1:17:47] will become jesus christ this man who
[1:17:50] was a theophany this man who was a word
[1:17:54] would turn from the word and the word
[1:17:56] will be made flesh
[1:17:58] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:18:01] word was with god and the word was god
[1:18:05] but that word was made flesh and that
[1:18:08] word dwell among us so melchizedek
[1:18:11] turned into the gate and melchizedek
[1:18:14] become jesus christ that's why the gate
[1:18:17] of the tabernacle had four pillars
[1:18:20] because the ministry of jesus christ is
[1:18:23] contained in four gospel look matthew
[1:18:26] john and oh mark
[1:18:29] did i lose anybody
[1:18:31] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:18:34] brother branham says this he said notice
[1:18:36] his title he is king of righteousness
[1:18:40] king of righteousness and king of peace
[1:18:43] he's two kings
[1:18:44] he is two kings everybody okay
[1:18:48] king of righteousness also the king of
[1:18:51] peace he is two kings there already
[1:18:54] regarded written there now since he has
[1:18:57] come in the flesh
[1:19:00] he was married made flesh
[1:19:02] and received his own body god became
[1:19:05] flesh in the person of jesus christ in
[1:19:08] revelation 21 16 he is called the king
[1:19:12] of king everybody okay
[1:19:14] he's all three of them together
[1:19:18] king god
[1:19:20] anybody okay
[1:19:21] king theophany and king water
[1:19:24] we got three kings over there everybody
[1:19:27] but two of those king are written under
[1:19:30] melchizedek
[1:19:33] everybody okay so far
[1:19:35] brother branham continued he said it's
[1:19:37] all met just like soul body and spirit
[1:19:41] all come to make harmony
[1:19:43] and he is the father which was the first
[1:19:47] then the sun and the water
[1:19:49] the spirit king of righteousness which
[1:19:52] is the spirit attribute
[1:19:56] the king of righteousness brother
[1:19:58] branham say it means the spirit of god
[1:20:02] everybody care
[1:20:03] and then theophany which is king of
[1:20:06] water
[1:20:07] so king of peace is speaking about the
[1:20:10] tea or fanny of god which is the word
[1:20:14] everybody okay
[1:20:16] amen and in the flesh
[1:20:19] everybody when the world was made flesh
[1:20:22] ever here he was king of water
[1:20:27] right here he becomes king of king
[1:20:33] what is going on
[1:20:35] the spirit of god was living alone
[1:20:40] in the beginning was god
[1:20:42] hey but here god was eternal and god
[1:20:46] left that state of being just a spirit
[1:20:50] invisible and god changed into a
[1:20:53] theophany everybody here so the spirit
[1:20:56] enter a light body that is called the
[1:20:59] theophany ever here when the spirit
[1:21:03] enters the light body back here the
[1:21:06] first king
[1:21:08] enter the second phase he becomes two
[1:21:11] king
[1:21:13] mark here when these two king enter into
[1:21:17] the body of a flesh they made three
[1:21:20] kings
[1:21:21] but all these three are one
[1:21:24] open first john chapter three
[1:21:29] so somebody doesn't struggle
[1:21:32] let's go to first john chapter 3
[1:21:35] hallelujah

[1:22:25] everybody okay
[1:22:26] watch verse seven
[1:22:28] for there are how many
[1:22:31] three the bear record where
[1:22:33] in heaven come out the first is
[1:22:37] come water
[1:22:37] the second is water
[1:22:39] kama and the third is water
[1:22:42] and these three are water
[1:22:44] any question
[1:22:47] everybody okay so right here melchizedek
[1:22:51] is king of righteousness which is the
[1:22:53] spirit attribute of god he's the king of
[1:22:56] peace which is the word attribute of god
[1:22:59] he's talking but when melchizedek or the
[1:23:02] word was made flesh in the man jesus
[1:23:05] christ melchizedek the god now took the
[1:23:08] title of king of king hey back here so
[1:23:11] you got two king over there and here you
[1:23:14] got one of them
[1:23:16] that one put everybody together
[1:23:18] everybody okay so far
[1:23:22] amen so when you enter into when you're
[1:23:25] coming into the tabernacle you crossing
[1:23:28] melchizedek you crossing the king then
[1:23:31] the priest then he turned into the gate
[1:23:34] everybody okay and once you enter into
[1:23:37] the gate then you start your redemption
[1:23:41] everybody okay
[1:23:43] when you enter into the gate and you
[1:23:46] cross the gate everybody
[1:23:48] your redemption started right there why
[1:23:51] because god had a promise to israel and
[1:23:54] god told israel that if you will obey my
[1:23:58] voice indeed and you keep my covenant
[1:24:01] then you shall be a peculiar treasure
[1:24:04] unto me above all the people for all the
[1:24:07] earth is mine the melchizedek and you
[1:24:09] shall be unto me a kingdom of water
[1:24:13] and the holy water so god wanted the
[1:24:16] entire nation of israel to become a
[1:24:18] kingdom of priests why because god
[1:24:22] himself was a priest and a king
[1:24:24] everybody okay but what happened when
[1:24:27] the word was made flesh the book of john
[1:24:30] said that he came unto his own to the
[1:24:32] jews and his own receive him not and
[1:24:35] guess what they rejected jesus christ
[1:24:37] and they crucified him and the blessing
[1:24:39] went into the gentile
[1:24:41] now in revelation 1 verse 5 the bible
[1:24:44] said that from jesus christ who is the
[1:24:47] faithful witness and the first begotten
[1:24:50] of the dead
[1:24:52] and the priests of the kings of the
[1:24:54] earth
[1:24:55] unto him that loved us
[1:24:58] and watched us from our sin
[1:25:01] in his own water
[1:25:03] and has made us water
[1:25:06] who is king and priest
[1:25:10] anybody okay so when christ is coming
[1:25:13] when you are entering the gate of the
[1:25:16] tabernacle the purpose of god is to turn
[1:25:20] you into a king and to a priest
[1:25:25] [Music]
[1:25:27] everybody here because brother branham
[1:25:29] said the normal way we should come on
[1:25:31] this earth we should have left the
[1:25:34] thought of god
[1:25:35] and enter in our telephony and then
[1:25:38] after we enter into our theophany like
[1:25:41] jesus christ then we come into flesh
[1:25:44] because this is what god did god left
[1:25:47] the spirit form enter into a theophany
[1:25:50] and then god was made flesh that's why
[1:25:53] jesus was not able to sin
[1:25:56] ever here but the problem with you and
[1:25:59] me we move from the spirit all the way
[1:26:03] to flesh and we never pick up our
[1:26:06] theophany everybody okay and our
[1:26:08] theophany was melchizedek in melchizedek
[1:26:12] that's why god is coming so that he can
[1:26:15] bring you back again so you can go back
[1:26:18] to the step that you've
[1:26:20] missed you bypass a step so jesus christ
[1:26:25] by dying he's bringing you back again so
[1:26:28] you can recuperate the step that you
[1:26:31] miss you need to go get your own word
[1:26:35] body your antiopening
[1:26:38] then your spirit your body and your
[1:26:40] teeth and it will make you exactly like
[1:26:43] god
[1:26:44] because god was a spirit god was a
[1:26:47] theophany and god was also flesh we got
[1:26:51] our spirit we got our body our flesh but
[1:26:54] we're missing our tiopani that's why our
[1:26:57] tea often is calling our tea off and
[1:27:00] he's longing to join with you but there
[1:27:03] was no way your theophany can come to
[1:27:06] you because of sin so somebody must come
[1:27:09] down and die and pay the price and go to
[1:27:13] the grave and resurrect it again and
[1:27:16] because of easter because of his
[1:27:19] resurrection now we have the right to go
[1:27:22] back in the tabernacle and to recuperate
[1:27:26] our theophany
[1:27:30] everybody okay so far
[1:27:32] that's why you heard brother branham
[1:27:34] saying he's borrowing my body
[1:27:36] because that is not the body of god
[1:27:39] that was the body of brother branham so
[1:27:41] god have to borrow to do something but
[1:27:44] god has his own body which is the body
[1:27:47] of jesus christ which is the body that
[1:27:49] looked like this man that you see right
[1:27:51] here when you see this man you see god
[1:27:54] philip when you see me you see god
[1:27:57] because me and my father we are one
[1:28:01] [Music]
[1:28:03] everybody okay so far
[1:28:05] first peter says that he also has lively
[1:28:08] stone
[1:28:10] i build up a spiritual water
[1:28:13] a holy water
[1:28:15] not ironic priesthood he's bringing you
[1:28:17] into a new priesthood which is the
[1:28:20] priesthood of melchizedek to offer up
[1:28:22] spiritual water
[1:28:24] not natural sacrifice because israel was
[1:28:27] offering natural sacrifice anybody okay
[1:28:30] spiritual
[1:28:32] sacrifice acceptable to god by whom
[1:28:35] by your a chosen water
[1:28:38] you remember that a royal water
[1:28:41] a priesthood that is combined with a
[1:28:44] king
[1:28:45] royal king priesthood royal prison you
[1:28:49] are children of melchizedek
[1:28:53] it doesn't have anything to do with your
[1:28:56] nationality
[1:28:57] it doesn't have anything to do with your
[1:28:59] blood
[1:29:00] it doesn't have anything to do with your
[1:29:02] race
[1:29:03] you only have one race which is the race
[1:29:06] of god
[1:29:07] [Applause]
[1:29:09] everybody here a royal priesthood a holy
[1:29:13] nation a peculiar water
[1:29:15] that you should shove off his the praise
[1:29:18] of him who has called you out of
[1:29:20] darkness
[1:29:21] into his marvelous water which in turn
[1:29:25] pass you another people
[1:29:26] you were far from god
[1:29:28] but are now the people of god which had
[1:29:31] not obtained mercy but now have obtained
[1:29:34] who
[1:29:34] mercy by who by jesus christ ever here
[1:29:38] that's why it's important for you to
[1:29:40] understand how you are approaching the
[1:29:42] gate you are approaching the gate by
[1:29:44] moving this way and when you move you
[1:29:47] find jesus christ and jesus christ open
[1:29:49] the gate and but here when you're
[1:29:51] entering dead then your redemption
[1:29:53] starts
[1:29:55] everybody okay so far so when you enter
[1:29:58] the tabernacle in the tabernacle now
[1:30:01] you're gonna find out that you have
[1:30:04] station you have sixth station
[1:30:07] everybody okay because this sixth
[1:30:10] station six speak of the number of men
[1:30:12] are we okay so far
[1:30:14] and we found out that christ
[1:30:16] was the tabernacle christ was delivered
[1:30:20] christ was the showbread christ was the
[1:30:23] president christ is everything but that
[1:30:26] crust have a meaning or a message behind
[1:30:29] it
[1:30:30] but here they crushed in the brazen or
[1:30:32] to have a message the crust in the level
[1:30:35] has a message and the sooner you decode
[1:30:38] the message you're going to understand
[1:30:40] what god wants to do for you everybody
[1:30:42] cares so far so as you entering now the
[1:30:45] tabernacle everybody here your first
[1:30:48] interaction you must interact with the
[1:30:50] president
[1:30:53] everybody okay
[1:30:55] when you interact with the president the
[1:30:57] president although we already explained
[1:30:59] to you that it's the cross
[1:31:01] you must first come at the cross
[1:31:05] everybody here that's why you repent
[1:31:08] that's why you ask forgiveness that's
[1:31:11] why you talk to jesus christ you
[1:31:13] recognize yourself as a sinner whether
[1:31:16] you were born in a message or not you
[1:31:18] are still a sinner
[1:31:20] but here whether you went in a nightclub
[1:31:23] or not you are still a sinner because we
[1:31:25] were born in sin sharpening iniquity
[1:31:28] coming into the world speaking what
[1:31:31] everybody must meet jesus christ at the
[1:31:34] cross
[1:31:35] if you were born in this message and
[1:31:37] never met christ at the cross you are
[1:31:40] still a sinner
[1:31:43] but here when you meet jesus christ you
[1:31:45] must remind yourself that lord i am a
[1:31:49] sinner even if you never drunk any drink
[1:31:52] in your life
[1:31:53] because when you were a leader you were
[1:31:55] lying
[1:31:56] because when you were leader you were
[1:31:58] taking things and hiding you were doing
[1:32:00] shady things but you just didn't smoke
[1:32:04] but that doesn't make you a believer
[1:32:06] that make you a sinner as much as the
[1:32:08] sinner that is on the street
[1:32:10] so when you come your first interaction
[1:32:12] is with the president and the president
[1:32:15] this is where you die this is where you
[1:32:17] die from your country you die from your
[1:32:20] family you die for your kindred you die
[1:32:23] for your friend you die from everything
[1:32:25] that was connected to you
[1:32:27] everybody here as you did then you take
[1:32:30] a decision at the president then you
[1:32:33] move to the next station
[1:32:37] and your next station is a water baptism
[1:32:40] you don't stop right there except if
[1:32:42] you're dying right there in the hospital
[1:32:45] when you meet the second stage you must
[1:32:47] be baptized it is essential everybody
[1:32:50] here the baptism you are showing
[1:32:53] everybody that this is the side i'm on
[1:32:55] now
[1:32:56] i was a sinner before but because i met
[1:32:59] jesus christ as the altar i am no longer
[1:33:01] a sinner i'm going to show everybody
[1:33:03] that i belong to the christian family
[1:33:06] that's why you get baptized as an
[1:33:08] outward big witness to the entire church
[1:33:11] that now i'm part of you
[1:33:13] everybody okay so far but you cannot
[1:33:16] stop right there because you're still
[1:33:18] outside
[1:33:19] when you reach these two levels or when
[1:33:22] you have interacted with these two
[1:33:25] furniture of the tabernacle you reach
[1:33:27] the summit
[1:33:29] of justification you have fulfilled the
[1:33:32] message of luther
[1:33:36] i'm letting that soak in
[1:33:38] but you must be careful because the
[1:33:41] longer you stay here there is a danger
[1:33:44] and the danger of staying in this state
[1:33:47] longer is calvina
[1:33:51] calvin will take the grace that save you
[1:33:55] at the altar the grace that brought you
[1:33:58] from darkness and brought you into the
[1:34:00] christian family and will turn that
[1:34:03] grace into a disgrace
[1:34:06] ever here
[1:34:08] until you are christian for a long time
[1:34:11] in a message but you are still doing
[1:34:13] mean things to other people
[1:34:16] because for you grace is everything
[1:34:19] as long as grace is there you're going
[1:34:21] to go to heaven you fell under the trap
[1:34:24] of kavanaugh
[1:34:28] are we okay so far so as soon as you get
[1:34:31] baptized you need to move forward
[1:34:34] and your next station will be under the
[1:34:36] golden candlestick which is the third
[1:34:39] level and under the current candlestick
[1:34:42] there is a program god wants you to
[1:34:44] understand
[1:34:45] god wants you to understand that for
[1:34:47] each age
[1:34:49] he's dealing with a specific person
[1:34:51] and that person is the message of the
[1:34:54] the messenger for that age
[1:34:56] and that messenger is the candlestick or
[1:34:58] the chief reaper
[1:35:00] and you must find a pastor that is
[1:35:03] following the message
[1:35:05] and you must stay under that pastor in a
[1:35:08] church that follow the light that has
[1:35:10] been given for your age because that is
[1:35:13] god filled for your redemption
[1:35:16] everybody here so far and once you go
[1:35:19] over there into the candlestick the
[1:35:22] candlestick doesn't stack you to them
[1:35:27] [Music]
[1:35:30] i never started a move to bring people
[1:35:33] to me
[1:35:34] the candlestick always point you towards
[1:35:38] something else
[1:35:39] if you notice the candlestick heavy
[1:35:41] light and the light will shine upon
[1:35:44] something so as soon as you recognize
[1:35:47] the candlestick
[1:35:49] ever here off your edge you need to
[1:35:52] check and not add the candlestick
[1:35:54] anymore but at what the candlestick are
[1:35:56] shining that is what brings you all the
[1:35:59] way to the table of the show bread which
[1:36:02] is your footage
[1:36:04] everybody okay so far anybody okay so
[1:36:07] far then you begin to eat the bread
[1:36:10] that is illuminated
[1:36:13] or that is shown upon by the candlestick
[1:36:16] but here when you reach this stage you
[1:36:20] reach the top of sanctification
[1:36:23] you have fulfilled the message of wesley
[1:36:27] everybody okay so far but you need to be
[1:36:30] careful for staying here longer
[1:36:33] because armenians will come down and he
[1:36:36] will pull you out again and bring and
[1:36:39] take the message
[1:36:41] of the day and make it a legal message
[1:36:45] for you
[1:36:48] everybody
[1:36:49] until you begin to obey the message as a
[1:36:52] legalist
[1:36:56] don't worry
[1:36:57] we are coming down the road to roof
[1:36:59] under sanctification
[1:37:01] you will understand what sanctification
[1:37:03] is everybody here the commandment of god
[1:37:07] are not supposed to be a burden
[1:37:09] [Music]
[1:37:12] anybody here when the word of god become
[1:37:16] a burden to you something is wrong
[1:37:19] when you are doing this thing because if
[1:37:22] i don't do it i'm going to go to hell
[1:37:24] something is wrong
[1:37:26] that is a minion
[1:37:28] everybody here armenian will work
[1:37:31] themselves for their own salvation
[1:37:34] showing god that they are worthy to go
[1:37:36] to heaven
[1:37:41] everybody here
[1:37:42] there is a danger there okay so as soon
[1:37:45] as you come here you enter there you
[1:37:47] move there you must remember there is
[1:37:49] another furniture in the holy place
[1:37:52] i'm giving you a journey
[1:37:54] so this help you anybody care that
[1:37:56] furniture that is there is the altar of
[1:38:00] instance which is water
[1:38:02] but here so as soon as you are eating
[1:38:05] the bread brother branham say if you
[1:38:08] want to get closer to god what do you do
[1:38:11] read your bible and do what
[1:38:13] read your bible and do what read your
[1:38:16] bible and do what
[1:38:18] everybody okay so far as you praying and
[1:38:21] you begin to consecrate yourself more
[1:38:24] everybody okay somebody will appear to
[1:38:27] you
[1:38:30] everybody okay
[1:38:31] that person is seymour
[1:38:39] do you know him
[1:38:41] how many know him
[1:38:43] how many know him
[1:38:44] in 1906
[1:38:47] in azusa street
[1:38:50] amen a group of people begin to pray god
[1:38:54] they want to see the manifestation and
[1:38:56] the move of god and they begin to pray
[1:38:59] and fast and pray and pray and they did
[1:39:01] it for so many days
[1:39:03] until the holy spirit drop down
[1:39:06] like in the day of pentecost everybody
[1:39:09] here and when the holy ghost jump upon
[1:39:11] them they begin to speak in tongues
[1:39:14] that's what started the pentecostal
[1:39:16] movement
[1:39:20] anybody okay so far everybody okay so
[1:39:23] far so your prayer life will open the
[1:39:26] door to certain gifts
[1:39:29] that's why cornelius without the holy
[1:39:32] ghost
[1:39:34] could pray and see the angel of god
[1:39:40] but no holy ghost yet
[1:39:42] do you follow me but you don't stay here
[1:39:44] longer
[1:39:45] because there is another danger right
[1:39:48] here
[1:39:49] everybody are following me they are
[1:39:51] danger is billy graham and all of robert
[1:40:01] brother branham said if there is
[1:40:03] somebody that knows how to preach
[1:40:06] repentance better than anybody he knows
[1:40:09] was billy graham
[1:40:11] everybody here billy graham is pulling
[1:40:14] you back again to the present altar
[1:40:17] and after you give your life to jesus
[1:40:19] christ you are left alone and brother
[1:40:22] branham said before you know it 30 000
[1:40:24] people receive jesus christ they come
[1:40:27] next year nobody comes to church
[1:40:29] everybody's gone back into the world
[1:40:31] because they stuck at the present altar
[1:40:33] they could not move anymore and the
[1:40:36] devil just pulled them back again into
[1:40:38] the world and they back again into the
[1:40:39] world amen and the other stream is oral
[1:40:43] robert
[1:40:44] oram which means month which deal with
[1:40:47] the pentecostal and the gift over there
[1:40:50] they're going to take you in their
[1:40:51] anointing and speaking in tongues and
[1:40:54] leaving all kind of anointing by
[1:40:56] dressing and living like a devil
[1:41:00] [Music]
[1:41:02] so the gift of the spirit begins to work
[1:41:04] in your life but your life doesn't
[1:41:06] change
[1:41:08] that's why jesus said many will come in
[1:41:10] that name and say have we not done cast
[1:41:14] out devil in your name do many miracles
[1:41:16] in your name and jesus said i never what
[1:41:19] they were suck unto aurora robert that's
[1:41:21] why brother brother say billy graham and
[1:41:23] oral robert both of them their gospel
[1:41:26] blinds the people
[1:41:30] everybody okay so far everybody okay so
[1:41:33] far so as soon as you get there there is
[1:41:35] one more station for you and that
[1:41:38] station is number six which is dealing
[1:41:41] with the ark of the covenant this is
[1:41:43] where god will meet you right there
[1:41:50] everybody okay so far if you look there
[1:41:53] this picture is in green
[1:41:55] this picture is in green this picture is
[1:41:58] in green this picture is in green these
[1:42:01] are your red spot that you need to watch
[1:42:03] why because luther preached
[1:42:05] justification
[1:42:07] wesley preached sanctification this
[1:42:09] brought the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:42:12] we go restoring back the gift
[1:42:14] so justice sanctification justification
[1:42:17] made way to water
[1:42:19] sanctification made what way to what the
[1:42:22] baptism of the and the baptism of the
[1:42:24] holy spirit made the way to do
[1:42:32] everybody okay so far
[1:42:33] everybody okay so far so until you get
[1:42:36] here
[1:42:38] then you know
[1:42:39] you in the rest with god
[1:42:41] when you're moving here be careful your
[1:42:43] snake is there
[1:42:45] be careful your snake is there be
[1:42:47] careful the snake is still there when
[1:42:50] you get here this is what killed the
[1:42:51] snake
[1:42:52] anybody here hey back here that's why
[1:42:55] when brad abraham came he began to
[1:42:57] condemn organized religion he began to
[1:43:00] preach why where did the pentecostal
[1:43:02] fail he began to show all this kind of
[1:43:05] stuff to remove everything so that god
[1:43:07] can come and kill the snake in your life
[1:43:10] everybody okay so far remember this
[1:43:13] journey so roof under lute
[1:43:16] roof under calvin roof under wesley roof
[1:43:19] under armenian roof under seymour roof
[1:43:22] and the oral robert and billy graham and
[1:43:24] roofing the message of brother branham
[1:43:27] hallelujah
[1:43:28] everybody okay so far did i lose anybody
[1:43:31] okay let's go back to our showbread when
[1:43:34] we were dealing with the showbread last
[1:43:36] week praise god we found out that the
[1:43:39] bible says that the showbread was made
[1:43:42] of twelve cakes
[1:43:45] two tenths a deal because the ark in the
[1:43:48] car of the covenant have the
[1:43:51] uh the mana and the measurement of the
[1:43:54] manner was one tenth
[1:43:56] and this is two tenths which is twice
[1:43:58] the mana everybody okay let's leave it
[1:44:01] alone and those two row and and those
[1:44:04] twelve cake the bible said that they
[1:44:06] were set in two rows of six rows per
[1:44:10] terrible everybody here and they put
[1:44:12] frankincense on them and they were
[1:44:14] changing them every sabbath and the one
[1:44:17] who was cooking that bread must be a
[1:44:19] liver
[1:44:20] or a consecrated person to cook the
[1:44:22] bread
[1:44:24] remember the one who cooked the bread
[1:44:26] must be a consecrated person
[1:44:28] everybody okay so far so when we look at
[1:44:31] the measurement of the table of the
[1:44:33] showbread we found out that we compared
[1:44:35] those measurements with the ark of the
[1:44:37] covenant
[1:44:38] we found that the left of the of the
[1:44:41] table was two cubits
[1:44:43] the breath was one cubit
[1:44:46] the height was a cubit and a half and in
[1:44:48] the arc of the covenant the left was 2.5
[1:44:53] the breadth was 1.5 and the height was
[1:44:58] 1.5 and the difference between the arc
[1:45:01] of the covenant i'm picking you up so we
[1:45:03] can go up whoever lost it last week
[1:45:06] everybody here so the difference between
[1:45:09] the oak and the table of the show bread
[1:45:11] because this has bread this has bread
[1:45:14] the difference was on the breath and on
[1:45:16] the left
[1:45:19] everybody okay
[1:45:21] when you take for instance the breath of
[1:45:24] the ark
[1:45:25] which is 1.5 and you take the breath off
[1:45:29] the table which is one and if you make
[1:45:32] the difference between them it gives you
[1:45:34] 0.5
[1:45:36] everybody okay so far
[1:45:38] i have to do this because your boss want
[1:45:40] me to do it everybody clear everybody so
[1:45:43] far when you take the life of the ark of
[1:45:45] the covenant and you compare it with the
[1:45:48] length of the table and you make the
[1:45:51] difference it still gives you 0.5
[1:45:54] and the height did not change because
[1:45:56] the height was 1.5 and if you compare
[1:45:59] the height to the other height it's
[1:46:00] gonna give you zero so the difference
[1:46:03] between the arc of the covenant and the
[1:46:06] table of the showbread was half
[1:46:09] and but here that's where we ended up
[1:46:11] with the difference being a half
[1:46:13] but if you notice this table here there
[1:46:16] is two rows in this table right here
[1:46:18] number two and each row have six bread
[1:46:21] you remember that
[1:46:23] so when you take six bread and you
[1:46:25] multiply by two raw it gives you what
[1:46:28] 12 which is a number of water and we
[1:46:30] found that six was the number of a man
[1:46:37] whoever lost it let's get it
[1:46:40] everybody here
[1:46:42] we found that we have two rows
[1:46:44] everybody here we have a table right
[1:46:47] here we have two row the first row has
[1:46:50] six bread the second row have six bread
[1:46:52] and six is the number of men and six is
[1:46:55] the number of men both of these men are
[1:46:58] in the same table
[1:47:00] about here and when you take six plus
[1:47:03] six he gave you 12 which is a number of
[1:47:06] worship everybody so these two men are
[1:47:10] in this table for worship
[1:47:14] everybody okay so far do you want me to
[1:47:16] repeat or i lost somebody
[1:47:18] everybody okay so far so we got two men
[1:47:21] sitting on this table and both of them
[1:47:24] bring worship unto god and we found out
[1:47:27] that the church of god is made out of
[1:47:30] jews people and it's made out of agenda
[1:47:34] you remember the body of a samaritan
[1:47:36] america and these two are in one church
[1:47:40] worshipping god because jesus said that
[1:47:43] the hour cometh
[1:47:45] that's the true it's not in jerusalem
[1:47:48] where the jews are where we worship the
[1:47:51] lord it's not gonna be again in samaria
[1:47:53] to worship the lord but the true
[1:47:55] worshiper will worship god in spirit and
[1:47:59] in truth all that god is required is
[1:48:02] somebody to worship him in spirit and in
[1:48:05] truth regardless of their language
[1:48:08] regardless of their country regardless
[1:48:11] of their place of birth as long as you
[1:48:14] worship god in the spirit and in the
[1:48:16] truth then god pick you up
[1:48:19] so the temple right here is no more for
[1:48:22] jewish people only he got both jews and
[1:48:25] he got the gentile mixed together in one
[1:48:28] table and the two of them bring worship
[1:48:30] so you got the blood of jesus christ
[1:48:32] mixed with the jews and the gentiles and
[1:48:35] the gentiles are bringing worship unto
[1:48:37] the lord everybody clear so far
[1:48:40] paul says this in first corinthians
[1:48:43] chapter 10 he said for we being many
[1:48:47] are what
[1:48:49] everybody okay
[1:48:51] we are jews we are gentle we are many
[1:48:54] people for in the blood of jesus christ
[1:48:56] but all of us we are harmony bread
[1:49:02] one bread
[1:49:03] even though it looks one two three four
[1:49:05] five six seven all the way to twelve all
[1:49:07] those bread
[1:49:10] everybody okay
[1:49:12] we are many but we are one bread camera
[1:49:15] and we are how many body
[1:49:16] for we are all partaker of that what
[1:49:20] both the jews and the gentiles we are
[1:49:22] eating of jesus christ
[1:49:25] and then we become one bread that's why
[1:49:26] we stuck in one table
[1:49:29] did i lose somebody
[1:49:31] amen so when we talk about the half we
[1:49:35] found that the half was hidden in the uh
[1:49:38] in the rainbow
[1:49:40] when we pulled the rainbow if you
[1:49:42] remember the candlestick was sending the
[1:49:45] light towards something according to the
[1:49:48] scripture the bible says in the book of
[1:49:50] uh exodus 25 that that shall make the
[1:49:53] seven lamps thereof and they shall light
[1:49:57] the lamps thereof they need to put
[1:49:59] lights on them
[1:50:00] that they may give light over against it
[1:50:04] so if the light if the lamps are here
[1:50:07] the light cannot go this way
[1:50:11] they have to go in the opposite
[1:50:14] everybody here if the lamp are looking
[1:50:16] like this they have to give light this
[1:50:18] way
[1:50:19] if the lamp are looking this way they
[1:50:21] have to give light this way so the lamp
[1:50:23] were giving light on the opposite of
[1:50:26] them everybody okay
[1:50:28] and the bible say in exodus 26 that that
[1:50:31] shall set the table
[1:50:33] without the veil and the candlestick
[1:50:35] over against it so the table
[1:50:39] of the showbread and the candlestick
[1:50:42] were up were opposite to one another
[1:50:45] everybody care and then the table was on
[1:50:49] the staff and the uh i'm sorry the table
[1:50:52] was on the north and the candlestick
[1:50:54] were on the south side everybody
[1:50:56] so which means that when you enter the
[1:50:59] tabernacle like we already said
[1:51:01] this lamp are shining straight
[1:51:04] toward the table where the breads are
[1:51:07] everybody okay and the light here of the
[1:51:10] candlestick we found out that it was the
[1:51:13] light of the star anybody care so you
[1:51:15] got the bread right here that are
[1:51:18] receiving the light from the star
[1:51:20] everybody
[1:51:21] which the bread we know it's the word of
[1:51:23] god so the messenger of the age when he
[1:51:27] comes in the edge
[1:51:29] do you follow me god will give him an
[1:51:32] inspiration
[1:51:34] and that inspiration is a light
[1:51:37] everybody okay
[1:51:38] and then luther will open the bible and
[1:51:41] he will find a place that says the just
[1:51:44] shall live by faith
[1:51:46] and when looter take his light and he
[1:51:49] shine it in that scripture luther bring
[1:51:52] a message of justification and that
[1:51:54] become the bread of god for that hour
[1:51:58] if you want to go to heaven in that hour
[1:52:00] you need to come on the looter to preach
[1:52:03] to hear the word that looter is giving
[1:52:06] light through it
[1:52:09] everybody cares so far so you look at
[1:52:12] every single messenger brother branham
[1:52:14] said they were seven colors of the
[1:52:16] rainbow but where did this rainbow start
[1:52:19] from in the book of ezekiel chapter one
[1:52:22] the bible says
[1:52:24] above the filmman that was over the head
[1:52:27] the head of the caribbean was a likeness
[1:52:30] of a throne
[1:52:31] as the apparent the appearance of
[1:52:34] sapphire stone and upon the likeness of
[1:52:36] the throne was the likeness as the
[1:52:39] appearance of a man above it
[1:52:42] so we got a throne
[1:52:45] somebody is there sitting on the throne
[1:52:47] on the throne we got a man sitting there
[1:52:49] everybody here
[1:52:51] you're dealing with a throne and a man
[1:52:53] and the bible says
[1:52:54] that and i saw as the color of ember
[1:52:58] we went through this in a hotel as the
[1:53:01] appearance of fire round about within
[1:53:03] him
[1:53:04] from the appearance of his loins upward
[1:53:06] you remember in the hotel and from the
[1:53:09] appearance of island even downward i saw
[1:53:12] as it were the appearance of fire
[1:53:14] somebody that looked like fire everybody
[1:53:16] here and he had the brightness round
[1:53:19] about it
[1:53:20] so around this person
[1:53:22] right here 360. there is an appearance
[1:53:26] anybody here
[1:53:28] and the bible says as the appearance of
[1:53:31] the bow
[1:53:32] that is in the cloud in the day of water
[1:53:36] so the rainbow right here in the book of
[1:53:40] uh ezekiel was all around god like this
[1:53:44] we gotta run about 360. everybody but in
[1:53:48] the day of noah when god exposed that
[1:53:51] rainbow he only gave half of it
[1:53:56] amen
[1:53:57] that's why when you when you go you're
[1:53:59] going to see half of it everybody okay
[1:54:01] so far and the bible said that he was
[1:54:03] last so as the appearance of the
[1:54:05] brightness round about it this was the
[1:54:08] appearance of the likeness of the glory
[1:54:10] of who
[1:54:12] the glory of the lord is a rainbow that
[1:54:14] is 360
[1:54:16] which is a circle of eternity but god
[1:54:19] split the two
[1:54:20] anybody here ah but the the bible says
[1:54:24] in the book of revelation chapter 4 that
[1:54:27] immediately as i was in the spirit a
[1:54:29] throne was set in heaven
[1:54:31] another throne the same one and one sat
[1:54:35] on the throne we know it's god
[1:54:37] not two person and he does saturn
[1:54:40] so that's that was to look like jasper
[1:54:42] and sadist serving stone and there was a
[1:54:45] red bull how
[1:54:48] 360. everybody here but when the rainbow
[1:54:52] appear it's only appearing half of the
[1:54:55] rainbow everybody here
[1:54:58] for you to have god
[1:55:00] the glory or the full glory of god
[1:55:03] everybody clear you need to have the
[1:55:06] first rainbow and the second rainbow
[1:55:08] pulled together
[1:55:10] everybody here so what did god do to the
[1:55:13] rainbow
[1:55:14] anybody okay
[1:55:16] god split the rainbow
[1:55:18] into everybody here
[1:55:20] this rainbow have seven colors
[1:55:22] everybody okay
[1:55:24] and the second rainbow have seven colors
[1:55:27] everybody clear
[1:55:29] these colors are not different
[1:55:34] anybody here
[1:55:35] they are the same everybody here and as
[1:55:38] long as you're dealing with seven colors
[1:55:41] you are still missing god
[1:55:45] hey back here for you to have god you
[1:55:47] need to have this half plus this half he
[1:55:50] gave you one everybody
[1:55:52] so the church ages only gave us half of
[1:55:56] god
[1:55:58] everybody
[1:55:59] so when god was splitting the rainbow
[1:56:02] follow me carefully
[1:56:04] god took
[1:56:05] a portion of revelation and hid it on
[1:56:08] this son
[1:56:10] and gave portion here
[1:56:15] anybody here so far
[1:56:18] lord help me
[1:56:20] all the mysteries at this time should be
[1:56:23] finished at the sanding of this
[1:56:25] messenger now here is the messenger on
[1:56:29] earth
[1:56:29] and another angel mighty messenger come
[1:56:32] down
[1:56:33] that's in revelation 10.
[1:56:35] we have brother branham here and we have
[1:56:37] the mighty angel coming down everybody
[1:56:39] here so this engine was an earthly angel
[1:56:43] or an earthly messenger brother branham
[1:56:45] down here but here come one down from
[1:56:48] what
[1:56:49] a rainbow covenant only who
[1:56:53] so brother branham said in revelation 10
[1:56:56] he is down here
[1:56:59] a messenger and there is another
[1:57:01] messenger that is coming down here but
[1:57:03] when this one is coming there is a
[1:57:06] rainbow that is there with him
[1:57:09] everybody okay so far
[1:57:11] brother bonham said just exactly
[1:57:15] like was in revelation what
[1:57:20] which chapter
[1:57:22] the first chapter standing in the midst
[1:57:25] of the seven water
[1:57:27] god then came the stick with what
[1:57:30] so when the golden scandal stick was
[1:57:32] here
[1:57:34] in the church ages there was already a
[1:57:37] rainbow here
[1:57:40] everybody here but this rainbow was only
[1:57:43] half of it
[1:57:44] that's why paul could tell you that i
[1:57:46] preach in part because there is
[1:57:48] something that paul cannot get to it
[1:57:51] because god took it away
[1:57:53] and back here luther can preach he's
[1:57:55] going to put somewhere and he stop
[1:57:57] because there is a portion that was
[1:57:59] taken out of him every seven of them god
[1:58:02] took some colors out of him everybody
[1:58:05] so when we reach revelation 10
[1:58:08] god bring the missing part of the column
[1:58:13] ever here so when you take what was in
[1:58:16] the church edges plus what is coming up
[1:58:19] then you receive god in his fullness
[1:58:24] brother what i'm saying and here he
[1:58:26] returned back in the 10th chapter after
[1:58:30] the coming that after the coming time
[1:58:33] that all the mysteries to be finished
[1:58:35] and the seals are to be broken and
[1:58:38] proclaiming that time is what
[1:58:40] why because he's bringing that brother
[1:58:43] branham said the whole revelation of
[1:58:45] jesus christ is completed in the world
[1:58:49] everybody here
[1:58:51] the servants here was only revealing
[1:58:55] what they did what
[1:58:59] everybody okay
[1:59:00] what they left off back there
[1:59:03] and he opened it up what they have left
[1:59:06] what luther
[1:59:08] what wesley
[1:59:09] what all the reformer and the
[1:59:11] pentecostal on down to the present water
[1:59:14] so the servant seal that's why the seals
[1:59:17] doesn't bring something outside of the
[1:59:20] bible
[1:59:21] [Music]
[1:59:23] it was something that was in the bible
[1:59:25] but it was just hidden
[1:59:28] so god gave a portion and kept a portion
[1:59:31] for the end time
[1:59:33] and in the end time when the mighty
[1:59:36] angel is coming he's bringing the
[1:59:38] portion so that everything that luther
[1:59:41] missed everything that was remit
[1:59:44] everything the pentecostal missed god
[1:59:47] bring them together and now we can see
[1:59:49] the arrow in calvin
[1:59:51] we can see the error in armenian we can
[1:59:54] see the error in billy graham we can see
[1:59:56] the error in oral robert we can see the
[1:59:59] error everywhere and when the elect of
[2:00:02] this edge is walking now you are walking
[2:00:05] carefully watching the arrow until
[2:00:08] you're gonna make it to the other side
[2:00:10] because this brad is not gonna fail
[2:00:12] anymore
[2:00:13] [Music]
[2:00:13] [Applause]
[2:00:18] hallelujah
[2:00:19] hallelujah
[2:00:20] brother branham says this let's go back
[2:00:23] i'm sorry to the showbread the showbread
[2:00:27] have harmony crown
[2:00:33] everybody here
[2:00:36] i have to work twice to get you back
[2:00:39] back online amen
[2:00:41] the showbread have two crowns
[2:00:45] here and those crown were just the
[2:00:47] border and we found that the two crown
[2:00:49] the bible says they were separated by
[2:00:51] handbreadth
[2:00:53] the hand breath according to david david
[2:00:56] says that lord
[2:00:57] make me know my name and the measure of
[2:01:00] my water
[2:01:03] behold that has made my days as a water
[2:01:06] so the measure of a human
[2:01:09] day is a hand breath which is short
[2:01:13] which is not too long
[2:01:15] because we missed eternal life ever here
[2:01:18] and on the earth of the covenant we have
[2:01:20] one crown a back here
[2:01:23] and we know that the table have to have
[2:01:26] bread which is the number of worship
[2:01:28] because the true worshiper that god is
[2:01:30] looking must worship god in water
[2:01:33] and in water
[2:01:35] the truth which is what
[2:01:37] the spirit the spirit and the truth the
[2:01:40] truth which is what the word the gospel
[2:01:42] the bible say and how shall we shall
[2:01:46] they preach except they be sent as it is
[2:01:49] written how beautiful are the feet of
[2:01:52] them that preach the water
[2:01:55] gospel of water
[2:01:58] and your feet showed with the
[2:02:00] preparation of the gospel of water
[2:02:03] the gospel of water
[2:02:08] everybody here
[2:02:10] everybody here so the spirit attribute
[2:02:13] speaker for
[2:02:14] speak of the king of righteousness
[2:02:16] remember and the word which is the
[2:02:19] gospel of peace speak of who
[2:02:22] do you see on melchizedek
[2:02:24] do you see a maltese edict and he's
[2:02:26] bringing you bread and water
[2:02:29] what is here is what
[2:02:31] do we see one yet
[2:02:33] we're getting there
[2:02:36] everybody okay so far everybody okay so
[2:02:38] far
[2:02:39] brother branham saying what is the crown
[2:02:41] he says a crime means you have the water
[2:02:45] you are a king if you are crowned
[2:02:47] because you want us to be kings and what
[2:02:51] you understand now and then and we are
[2:02:54] sons of god when we are what
[2:02:57] with what

[2:21:11] everybody okay
[2:21:13] all right then in the book of luke we

[2:21:18] that when the man was
[2:21:21] placed there half dead when the good
[2:21:23] samaritan came and began to restore the
[2:21:26] man we found out that he burned him if
[2:21:28] his wound and poor what
[2:21:31] and what
[2:21:32] from the old testament
[2:21:35] everybody okay now now in the book of
[2:21:37] revelation the bible say i heard a voice
[2:21:40] in the midst of the four be saying a
[2:21:42] measure of what
[2:21:44] what do you do with wheat you make what
[2:21:47] a measure of what
[2:21:49] what do you do with barley you make what
[2:21:51] and penny and that shall not hurt what
[2:21:55] and what
[2:21:56] so the table of god through the church
[2:21:59] ages have bread
[2:22:02] made out of wheat
[2:22:04] and made also out of barley but here
[2:22:08] remember roof have to go in the harvest
[2:22:11] of wheat and the harvest of barley you
[2:22:13] remember roof amen but that table also
[2:22:17] have oil and what one so the devil
[2:22:21] entered and begin to temper with the
[2:22:23] bread he began to manipulate the word of
[2:22:26] god god said okay you playing with the
[2:22:29] world but do not touch the oil and do
[2:22:32] not touch the bread or wine ever here so
[2:22:36] when you enter in my table of show bread
[2:22:39] i got bread i got oil in it and i got
[2:22:42] also wine tempered with the bread but
[2:22:46] don't touch the oil and the wine
[2:22:49] don't touch my drink offering
[2:22:53] everybody here
[2:22:54] don't touch my drink often
[2:22:56] everybody here you temper with the word
[2:22:59] you begin to teach them all kind of
[2:23:01] false doctrine i understand but when you
[2:23:04] come to the oil when you come to the
[2:23:06] wine do not touch my oil and one
[2:23:10] do not touch my drink coffee
[2:23:18] can i drop something
[2:23:19] when joseph was in the prison
[2:23:24] you okay now
[2:23:26] two officers of pharaoh
[2:23:28] made mistake
[2:23:30] one was a baker

[2:23:35] and the one other one was the water
[2:23:38] a battler responsible for water
[2:23:41] they killed the baker
[2:23:43] but not the one who was handling wine
[2:23:47] the battle have to be restored back

[2:37:59] we are serving now in the middle of
[2:38:01] melchizedek where we get bread and we
[2:38:04] got drink that's why melchizedek when he
[2:38:07] comes bring abraham water
[2:38:10] and water the table of the showbread
[2:38:14] amen everybody okay so far brother
[2:38:17] branham say i do not believe that
[2:38:19] crochet bread should be substituted for
[2:38:22] a cracker
[2:38:23] i believe that it should be a holy
[2:38:26] unleavened bread
[2:38:28] the top of unleavened bread that was
[2:38:31] made in egypt i believe that the blood
[2:38:34] should not be grape juice but it should
[2:38:37] be water
[2:38:39] are you seeing there
[2:38:41] grape juice sour
[2:38:43] and spoil
[2:38:44] as he get water
[2:38:46] but one get water
[2:38:48] and water
[2:38:50] and what
[2:38:51] and he never loses his water
[2:38:54] the blood of jesus christ does not sound
[2:38:58] hospital
[2:38:59] as he gets old he gets stronger
[2:39:02] he gets better as the day goes back
[2:39:06] by the
[2:39:08] water everybody here
[2:39:11] you remember the priest in the old
[2:39:13] testament have to sprinkle the mercy
[2:39:15] seat with blood seven times
[2:39:17] but here the more the gospel is moving
[2:39:20] from paul to arrest to luther to all the
[2:39:23] way it's getting more
[2:39:28] but here
[2:39:29] ever here what about them say and it is
[2:39:31] a little water
[2:39:34] and water
[2:39:35] which speak about water
[2:39:40] so when you're taking communion
[2:39:43] melchizedek
[2:39:45] bread and wine
[2:39:47] it becomes a worship to you
[2:39:49] that's why brother branham said it's a
[2:39:51] duty for the believer to do that because
[2:39:54] you're eating his bread and you have
[2:39:55] your drink offering
[2:39:57] both of them together ever here and
[2:39:59] communion bread should be made by the
[2:40:02] people who is what
[2:40:04] themselves and consecrated themselves to
[2:40:07] who
[2:40:08] the showbread has to be made by the
[2:40:12] you remember
[2:40:13] that's why communion must be made by
[2:40:15] somebody who is consecrated
[2:40:17] because the showbread was speaking about
[2:40:20] a priest that is consecrated so your
[2:40:22] communion spiritually speaking is
[2:40:25] speaking about the table of the show
[2:40:27] bread
[2:40:29] amen
[2:40:29] everybody okay so far everybody okay so

[2:40:58] but what does that drink offering do
[2:41:00] not only does he stimulate you does he
[2:41:03] give you strength in the trial but about
[2:41:06] the wine in the bible means water he
[2:41:09] refreshes you
[2:41:11] but here this is the refreshment that
[2:41:14] comes from the presence of who
[2:41:16] that's why he was called show bread the
[2:41:19] bread of his presence
[2:41:21] the show the show him showing the show

[2:48:46] that scripture that you were reading all
[2:48:48] the time and you don't understand who
[2:48:50] handed to you
[2:48:55] who who who handed you that revelation
[2:49:00] you were sitting reading the bible you
[2:49:01] don't understand and suddenly oh i see
[2:49:03] what brother stephen was preaching oh
[2:49:05] that's it right here somebody's
[2:49:08] [Music]
[2:49:15] corn and she did eat and was water
[2:49:19] so fast and water
[2:49:24] get bread
[2:49:25] but get also water
[2:49:27] vinegar you need a refreshment
[2:49:30] why vinegar
[2:49:33] white vinegar roof is there
[2:49:35] sitting there
[2:49:36] and then they give her bread and there
[2:49:38] is water why vinegar
[2:49:40] the bible says in the book of john
[2:49:43] after this jesus knowing
[2:49:50] [Music]
[2:49:51] that all things well now
[2:49:56] i finished the label i have been beaten
[2:50:00] they spit on me i took the cross
[2:50:02] i finished everything now i'm at the end
[2:50:07] i'm at the end
[2:50:08] i finished the label i'm already tired
[2:50:12] my blood has been dripping all along
[2:50:15] i'm losing water
[2:50:17] there's no more strength i'm crucified
[2:50:20] ever here when he knew that everything
[2:50:24] now was accomplished that the scripture
[2:50:27] might be what
[2:50:29] he said i do what
[2:50:34] everybody okay so far did i lose
[2:50:36] somebody
[2:50:37] and there was such a vessel full of what
[2:50:42] why only vinegar
[2:50:47] everybody here
[2:50:48] he labors a lot
[2:50:50] he needs a refreshment
[2:50:52] everybody
[2:50:54] hey
[2:50:55] remember they give him vinegar before he
[2:50:57] spit it out
[2:50:59] because they mix it with god
[2:51:01] and he spit it out
[2:51:03] and then and the soldier changed
[2:51:06] and they took vinegar now but they
[2:51:08] change it to with something else and
[2:51:10] then there was a set they were there was
[2:51:13] set a vessel full of water
[2:51:15] and they feel a sponge with water
[2:51:19] and put it upon what
[2:51:21] he's up in the scripture means what
[2:51:29] anybody here when they took the
[2:51:31] refreshment
[2:51:32] you cannot bring the refreshment without
[2:51:35] combining with faith
[2:51:37] because the refreshment is always a
[2:51:39] stimulation by revelation
[2:51:44] everybody okay the stimulation by
[2:51:47] revelation that's your drink offering is
[2:51:50] stimulated by revelation so they took
[2:51:52] the drink offering and combine it with
[2:51:54] faith and then they put it and he put it
[2:51:57] in his mouth when jesus therefore had
[2:52:01] received the vinegar he said it is
[2:52:08] game over
[2:52:10] devil game over
[2:52:12] [Music]
[2:52:13] here why because the drink offering when
[2:52:16] it comes
[2:52:18] the game is over
[2:52:20] because you turn your eyes into red like
[2:52:22] judah that's why the bravo says touch
[2:52:26] not the oil do not touch the wine that's
[2:52:29] why when the devil beats you down beat
[2:52:31] you down beat you down after a while all
[2:52:34] it takes is just a refreshment after the
[2:52:37] refreshment comes then you suddenly rose
[2:52:39] up again
[2:52:40] i'm ready to fight
[2:52:42] it is finished level i'm coming back
[2:52:45] again i'm gonna take my child i'm gonna
[2:52:48] take my husband i'm gonna take my money
[2:52:51] i'm gonna take my uncle i'm gonna take
[2:52:54] my job i'm gonna take my business i'm
[2:52:56] gonna take my health i'm gonna take
[2:52:59] everything that you took i'm taking that
[2:53:02] back again because i have been refreshed

[2:53:24] ghost everybody
