apologize for the Lord's Supper the water was cold so I want to knock that devil out to where he heals it amen so we put the water out and left it outside it was so cold and the water got cold cold cold and by the time we pulled the water it was frozen so I'm Sorry by God's grace this year believing that we would do it in house amen so our apology I have to put that out and then make sure

the 22nd the Merit couple meeting part five it's on March the 22 amen and I believe I got everything clear so far brother Glenn amen I don't see brother patient here probably he's working today but uh brother patient probably you know him his wife is pregnant sister Isabel yes so we need to find out this this is going to be his uh their first uh child so somebody need to do something about the baby shower we clear not the second one this is the first one so my wife C whatever how you cook stuff you go ahead and do all the mixing and pop up with something and let's do something special for them amen they went through something that was really really horrible somebody either on the third floor or whatever left the fire on and the whole apartment come complex that they were living thank God the sister was at home sleeping she woke up because of the noise and the run outside so they have to lock their building and relocate all of them it was a fire and somebody even died so thank God our sister was kept alive with the baby and everything is amen so so you remember them in prayer I don't see them here probably that he's working but uh Lord's willing if we can do something to make sure everything is okay amen uh last Sunday I mentioned about the meal offering and I gave two uh uh option for the meal offering but I didn't finish reading the scripture so I thought I need to make sure I read the scripture the meal offering can come in three forms so I'm going to read it to make sure it's there so he was not left alone because I only gave two options so you bear with me we got a lot to download but by God's grace all will be okay amen the Bible says in the Book of Leviticus this is from last Sunday it says in uh verse one Leviticus 2 that and when any will offer a meat offering which brother brandham call a meal offering so when you see brother Branham saying meal offering this is exactly what he's referring to he say when any will offer a meal or a meat offering unto the Lord he's offering shall be of fine flow so the meal offering will come as a fine flow this is the first uh option and he shall pour oil on upon it and put Frankin SS there on we can't get into this that's another teaching there and if th bring an oblation which is an offering of a meat offering baked in the oven it shall be on leav cake this is the second one of fine flour mingle with oil all or unle waffer or wafer Anointed with oil so either it's a fine flour or it's an UNL cake or it's unle wer so we got three option right there I just want to make sure you got it because I only gave two I was dealing with Gideon and the 11 cake so I forgot the last one so make sure when you read the scripture if you see 11 cakes or you see a Le waer or you see a fun flour all of them are coming for a meal offering we clear yeah brother te mentioned u a quote on uh New Year's Eve and somebody told him that the pastor preach on Christmas so he mentioned a quote uh brother brandham say without any Christmas there is no resurrection that Christmas that brother brandham was referring was not December the we not parot we are not parot parot repeat things without understanding are we together are we together when you repeat the message of the hour you need the spirit that spoke the message to catch exactly what brother Bram said because brother Bram cannot contradict brother BR let me start it this way Bible doesn't contradict the Bible am even though he say one mad man here and two M men here there is no contradiction the contradiction is in you you need the inspiration of God to understand why is this one and why is the other one too and the same apply to the message of brother BR the message cannot contradict the message brother Bram was trying to say that without the birth of Jesus Christ you cannot have a resurrection Jesus must be born for you to have a resurrection amen are we together so brother T call me say brother Stephen I do not celebrate Christmas you know I said brother Tim don't even worry about it I already cut the court the court is correct and I understand where you standing so don't even worry about it so I just want you to know if somebody was weing brother timan that's his position are we clear amen you know I told you I'm going to uproot this thing from the from the root and when it's gone I have to give some chemotherapy we clear we clear so if you miss go back again and listen there is one from the hotel one from last week and today I'm just going to give two treatment of chemotherapy then we move to what we are supposed to be doing amen you know what Shake somebody's hand say God let let let's let's losen somebody [Laughter] after amen we clear amen when you clear you tell me amen ah praise God the children of Malachi 4 they love the word of God they love the coats and they eat everything amen no selection to the court if you cannot swallow what is coming up now what is behind this is even more important than this amen so make your life easy get this as a topical treatment then you can get the other one amen oh praise God I don't know how she made it but she purposed to be here on New Year's Eve I could not do it she say I want to be in service and finally she made it my mother made it welcome Mom amen so let's go and deal with this chemotherapy quickly and we go with it amen amen I'm sorry I had to take the lollipop out of you man so baby's crying Amen brother Bram says in paragraph 82 make sure you can take a note or something brother brandham say and every man or woman that go to church today I was thinking of the cathedral a ringing out and the bells a toing and so forth like that and people going to church and making ready and the women buying their what so it's not about just Christmas okay when we get to Easter I handle it probably amen women buying their what Easter hats and so forth what has this come to my how I cannot understand where a rabbit rabbit has anything to do with what the resurrection no sir how a what a Christmas tree has anything to do with the what the birth of Christ it is what Pagan friends don't say Amen it is Pagan friends we got off the path somewhere that's right but this is what you need to swallow now a what real Born Again a real born again man or woman realizes because there is life within you tells you that that is wrong is that right congregation says amen so if you got the Holy [Applause] Ghost if you got the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost in you will tell you that Christmas is wrong don't say [Applause] Amen exposition of the seven Church ages then the most of them go to church when on Sunday that is good but even there they had no idea of how to approach God and how to worship Him Jesus said that true worship was how in spirit and in truth John 4:24 but what kind of worship can you get in a church that knows so little of God he put up a what a Santa Claus at what Christmas and B is where at Easter where did they get get that they got it from what pagans and he made it part of the church What doctrine but when one turns to the Lord and he filled with what the Holy Ghost he does what seizes from all such things do you have the Holy Ghost how many have the Holy Ghost raise your hand if you got the Holy Ghost if you got the Holy Ghost you should stop from this thing [Applause] [Music] are we together are we together are we together amen my subject this [Applause] morning is our journey through Joseph's five garment part 43 and the theme today is ignorance in unbelief ignorance Amen in unbelief my brother please give me some time okay give me some time okay we got to download this thing amen amen amen let's go to our scripture Psalm 82 you will dream about deep song amen amen right brother Bernard they will dream about it amen amen good to see you brother Tony amen Psalm 82 verse1 you need to keep your seat belt Backle up because this might be strong but I'm going to tell you at the beginning I am not preaching to serpent seed hallu I am not preaching to serpent [Music] seed invisible audience I am not preaching to serpent seed if you serpent seed you try to get this it will take you quick you quickly to hell but if you're a Son of God he will free you completely are we together amen so flight attend and prepare for take off let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we approaching you humbly this morning again father we thank you for your presence for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us through this year that have passed and that which you were about to doing this year Lord father vindicating it by your anointing and your presence this morning Lord Jesus Christ thank you for sense of like Precious Faith thank you for protecting us Lord father this is as far as I can go with the ability you have given me when it comes to speaking to your brde father I am not fit and worthy for that Lord he only take the Holy Spirit to come Lord father use a human vessel and to speak and to also understand listen and comprehend what the spirit is saying father move me completely out of the way move also dis orience completely out of the way may you come and bless our fellowship and heal us as your word is coming forth deliver your children fill them and transform them in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Psalm 82 verse one a Psalm of aav God stands in the congregation of the mighty he God judges among the gods you understand this now you may be seated verse six I have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high again verse six is talking about the Divine part of each one of us amen the part of deity we clear amen then we have verse seven God himself say but there is like a contradiction you shall die like men and fall like one of the princes the second part is the human part or the human record amen and this record is dealing with sin yes with fall suffering and so forth are we together amen the one who spoke these two records is God so God is mindful of the good part and the bad part and matter of fact God himself partook on both of [Applause] them in the beginning was the word yes and the Word was with God and the Word was God are we together and the Word was made flesh now we hear amen did the man Jesus died yes he did yes he did not God because God left Jesus in gony are we together the man Christ died yes sir Jesus matter of fact died as a sinner Jesus did nothing sin but jesus carried the sin of the world that's what took him back to hell that's what took him to hell because he died as a sin so Christ himself fulfilled the Divine part and he also fulfilled the human part that's why brother Bram say he was 100% God and 100% man but as a man he never die as a sinless man Christ died as a sinner brother Bram says this glory to God in the message adoption 1960 paragraph 105 follow me carefully he says when was our names put in the lamp's book of of life in other word what time when Byam say when the lamb was slain come on now when before the foundation of the world we already spoke that this human part here is a part connected to the Earth that's right because our body come from the dust of the Earth are we together so be before the material of your body was formed because brother Bram say all our bodies were laying here since the Garden of Eden are we together before your body was existed on this Earth are we together the atonement was already slain so your atonement came before the part of you that will cause you problem praise God brother Bram says when God was Jehovah El Elohim the self existing one just like one great big diamond and he could not be nothing else but inside of this diamon he's what attribute was What A Savior when God created The World God displayed the attribute of creation amen are we together God displayed the attribute of how powerful he is amen how M he is how he can speak something and something will come into existence but whatever God was doing God was not able to fully manifest himself because certain attribute could not be displayed when everything is [Applause] perfect I hope you following me I hope you following me when everything is perfect God is limited Oh Glory to his expression Jes God will only reveal himself a certain way but you will not know God in another [Music] way this is God okay inside God is the third pole everybody loves this are we together amen inside God is savior yes are we together third pool doesn't have anything to do with sin come on now third pool doesn't have anything to do with the atonement amen I don't know if you get me that's why Jesus spoke to the tree before his death yes Jesus was not dead yet and Jesus gave they disciple that power before he died and brother Bram was puzzled yes he was brother Bram say wait a minute the lamb must be dead then we can receive the power of creation how can God give that power without even the lamb being dead brother Bram say so that power is not in the atonement God say he was in the atonement amen are we together but the atonement was not killed yet yes are we together so the third pool will Express itself regardless are we together but the attribute of God as a savior cannot be expressed until there is a [Applause] sinner I don't know if you get what I'm saying if everything is perfect amen there is nothing to save God is locked but God doesn't want to be locked that's why the glitch on a female on a woman have a secret the glitch that God did on Eve was actually a pipe it is Eve that releases the tension of [Music] [Applause] God I don't know if we together you are slowing me down so I don't have any choices God have attribute right in God there is perfection in God there is creation Amen in God there is savior in God there is healer you cannot heal if there is no sickness are we together are we together so God Express this good part here came out am are we together this one was building tension inside of God are we together and God could not use Adam sir mer do you understand what I'm saying do you understand what I'm saying God could not use Adam to release the tension God uses the woman because the woman is the one that releases the tension Hallelujah see you on March 22 my friend are we together are we together when the tension is built up Hallelujah it is the woman that releases the [Music] tension I don't know if we together there when the T because there are some attribute that need to come out that need to Express itself and those attribute needed a woman so women are [Applause] special Hallelujah the blood of Jesus Christ is [Applause] pre don't worry sister say Amen am and me as the blood of Jesus Christ I say amen that's why we are special am [Applause] [Music] I'm going to let God himself shock you can I continue brother Bram say diamond his attribute was What A Savior in this attribute on the inside of him was what a Healer follow me now well there was nothing to save and nothing to do what to heal are you ready MH you can swallow this right but his attribute did what produced it so who produced sin God sir don't look at me look at the [Applause] bo there was nothing to do what nothing to do what heal but his attribute did what produc it so it's the attribute of a savior that produce the sin don't say Amen let me start it again it's hard to swallow right let me help you up who created the [Music] devil who created the devil how can God create a devil yes sir I'm asking you a question who created the devil God how can God create the devil a bad man Hallelujah now it's okay now we okay now we okay we not okay yet let me start it again who created the devil God why did God created something that he knows will trouble everything because God already [Applause] knows who chose [Applause] Judas who chose Judas Jesus said I am the one who pick people why did Jesus pick up the devil in flesh and Jesus said I'm the one who pick all of you and one of you is a devil who pick that devil it is necessary because without Judas they won't kill the lamb it is the Lamb that produce [Applause] Judas I warn you I'm not preaching to the serpent seed I warn you I know exactly what I was warning you for are we together it is the attribute of God that produces that am this mess here was caused by God don't worry my friend you are slowing me down you have to I have to recuperate all this minute if God create something what do you think that thing should come up bad or perfect per perfect good who created this world why did go why didn't God create that perfect the Bible said the world was in darkness it was a mess who created the mess why did he create the mess so he can use the mess to display his power amen when God begin to change the mess and transform the mess now we see the power of God God need mess [Music] wonderful I am not preaching to the serpent seed sir all it is God who says ye are gods and he said but you shall die like men God saw this sir but God needed this part here to express his [Applause] attribute God needed sickness so he can display as Jehovah Rafa God want you to lack something so he can be Jehovah [Applause] jar it is God that created those things why because the atonement requires it I don't know if you're getting what I'm saying this atonement here when you have an atonement like a an attribute like savior this attribute automatically call for a sinner are we together are we together when a sinner appear on the scene The Sinner actually Quicken that attribute the sner The Sinner Quicken the attribute savior so when God sees a sinner savior begin to cry like let me go let me go let let me go let me go let me jump on this let me [Applause] jump when you are sick then the Healer begin to pop say move out of the way it is my time it is my time it is my [Applause] time are we together are we together remember the power of Moses could create something and remove it you remember Moses he could create something and he can also remove it so the atonement create the mess and express itself and remove the [Applause] mess I don't know if you understanding me the atonement will will will bur mess and when the mess exists then the atonement come and swallow a mess and there is no more mess so this part here was created by the atonement so when the atonement is coming it is not looking for this this is God but the atonement is looking for your human part when God sees you as a man then God is is not fighting let me go let me go now because this is the time I can show him I am his savior I am the Healer I am the provider I am the protector because you don't protect [Applause] God the Holy One of Israel does not sleep God don't sleep but the man can sleep so when you sleep then God become your [Music] protection are we together so he took your yes it took this one Amen to release the attribute of God in the fullness of it because this part here is perfect this is a clean part the clean part doesn't need atonement to handle [Music] it let me finish my friend brother Bram say so then before the foundation of the world when he know that the great display in here of him that he will be What A Savior that he would come and be made flesh and dwell Among Us he know by the by his trap we were what you that's when he slew the Lamb on his book before the foundation of the word and wrote your name on that book amen before the foundation of what the world amen amen are we together amen are we together amen so take all the messes that you have in your life do me a favor collect them as I'm moving now begin to collect them get in your closet pull them up put it in the garbage can collect all of them okay collect all of them all the messes all the mistake you made collect all of them because those mistake will show how poent that's why the Pharisee missed Jesus Christ because Jesus was always among the Sinners they didn't understand they say wait a minute if he's a prophet why is he around bad people he look at them he said the sick are the one that are looking for the doctor I'm a doctor I need sick people [Applause] don't know if you get me the Publican and The Prostitute were around him because he can display his power [Applause] amen they even caught a woman on adultery and they brought the case with a video Jesus said good job let me show you the atonement he said woman where is your accuser they miss the atonement and you who look false on me who are looking trouble on me you will see the power of my atonement amen my atonement will stand for me am [Applause] I'm saying me because I have to put myself on you put yourself on whoever is looking to point you finger tell him I got an [Applause] atonement because in this message we got BMS and we got bails they always look at the bad part but they miss to see the pillar of fire they miss to see the atonement they miss to see the cloud the cloud the cloud has [Applause] come are we together are we together are we together why is a man Friend of Sinners friend of Publican he's always around people with m why because the atonement require [Music] messes and he look at the Pharisee he said you good then you're going to die in your sin when they bring Mary Magdalene 7 demons then the atonement was sitting and say let her wash the feet when he finished it he said listen your sins are forgiven and everywhere they preach the gospel they will preach you Mary Magdalene become part of the gospel and this day this scripture is fulfilled I am not preaching to the serpent seed are we together are we together Pastor thank you you we are way off no I was just taking off from the airport are we together let's go to Leviticus 4 Oh Glory to God brother brandham went somewhere and saw a woman with two men Bram look he say God bring fire Amen brother Bram didn't know he was a daughter of Abraham ah God say William Marion Bram you back to the wrong door you come outside [Applause] you come outside brother Bram say yes yes Lord he said look over there who is sinning brother Bram saw himself he didn't know the atonement was for [Applause] him hallu brother Bram thought he's walking with us the atonement was constantly watching brother Bram and the atonement is watching you because the wrath of God could have kill him if you will let me reach where I wanted to go [Applause] today let's go to Leviticus 4 my friend Oh Glory to God amen amen these things we got to come to a Clarity of what are we believing in this message because the devil can't be playing with for so long like this no we need to know what we believe in amen you need to know who you are hallelujah how can you marry somebody without sin how is that going to happen how are you going to marry the Lamb of God without a sin and you must be without spot and without wrinkle how can you reach be without spot and wrinkle so there got to be something to make you with spot and without wrinkle so when God say the Brad will be with us spot and wrinkle it means the Brad will have wrinkle and spot so God is already aware of the wrinkle of s but when you have wrinkle of spot then the power of transformation begin to work this is already white how can I turn this white again it's already white it need to be dark then when I turn it toward you say wow look at the power of course look at me you will see the [Applause] power let's go to Leviticus 4 my friend Lord help me are we together amen verse one the Bible say and the Lord spoke to Moses saying speak to the children of Israel saying if a soul shall sin through what we clear on that one I'm reading this again for a reason amen if a soul will sin through ignorance against any of the commandments so this ignorance take care of all sin I'm reading the Bible it is one ignorance but in that ignorance it might be ignorance maybe you lie maybe you did this maybe you did so all of them are put together in one thing ignorance that's right ignorance can fit anything in your [Applause] life father please help me reach where I want to go he says any commandment of the Lord concerning things which ought not to be done and shall do against any of them so you already know there are certain things you're not supposed to do but you do it we call that iniquity amen here Moses is calling that ignorance follow me my friend I'm not preaching to serpent seed verse three if the priest that is Anointed do sin according to the sin of the people then let him bring for his sin which he has seen a what a young Bullock without what blemish so if a priest the priesthood which is the brde you already know now amen sin amen you bring a young Bullock that's right you remember this now yes sir which is called a calf right but that Cal must be without blemish and we already seen that all sacrifices of the Old Testament type who Christ Christ because without blemish already tells you who that person is are we together he said without blemish to the Lord for a what sin offering are we clear amen the sin is ignorance but the offering is for sin offering we got ignorance and sin offering let me start it again the sin is ignorance but when the sacrifice come it comes for sin but your sin is for ignorance but the sacrifice come for sin are we together verse four and he shall bring the Bullock to the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord and shall lay his hand upon the Bullock's head and kill the bulock before the Lord and the priest that is Anointed shall take off the Bullock's blood and bring it into the Tabernacle of the congregation what are you trying to say here because this is The Book of Leviticus we need to go slowly you recall we went through the temple sir the temple have three parts yes sir follow me my friend one 2 three you got the braen alter here yes we got the lever here amen they were killing animal and put that in the and the blood over there wash it and kill it and put the blood are we there then when you enter the holy place this is the other court this is the holy place this was the holiest are we together over here we got the Candlestick you remember and we got the altar of incense and the table of the showbread are we together then the last one has the Ark of the Covenant with the mercy it and the Carib are we clear now so what Moses is saying is when you kill the lamb are we together you come into the door of the Tabernacle this portion called The Holy place was also called The Tabernacle of the congregation follow me that's why when you go to Hebrew n you will understand why Paul is calling this the first Tabernacle and the second Tabernacle because over here it was outside you can see the light in the Zodiac but over here he was covered are we together praise God let's go to verse uh five and the priest that is Anointed shall take off the Bullock's blood and bring it into the Tabernacle of the congregation in other word in the Holy place are we together verse uh six and the preach shall deep his finger yes sir so that priest must use his finger Hallelujah follow me my friend follow me my friend the priest number one will use his finger amen he will use the finger and dip the finger where in the blood so the blood have to be sprinkled with a finger that's if you can help me we will s quickly the blood will be finger with a finger finger with blood are we together amen glory to God Amen the speak he will sprinkle uh he will shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle the blood how many times seven times are we together so the spr will dip the finger and use that same finger with the blood seven time and he sprinkled the blood with a finger seven time where the blood number two is sprinkle seven time sir where the Bible says he spring of the blood seven time before the Lord before the what the veil of the what of the sanctuary do you follow me now please turn your attention toward the board they killed the sacrifice here are we together there was a curtain right here we already went through that and here there was another Veil right here amen so when the priest enter there is another third Veil here are we together he will enter into the holy place with the blood then he takes the his finger and dip it inside the blood and sprinkle this Veil here follow me carefully he sprinkling this Veil here seven times but remember this Veil behind it was God right because God was upon the Ark of the Covenant between the Carib beams that's where the pillar of fire stood so it's a veil that was veiling [Applause] [Music] God Have I Lost You Have I Lost somebody jum to verse uh jum to verse uh we on verse 6 jum to verse uh 13 father help me if you thereare you can say amen amen now that was the priesthood if the whole Congregation of Israel sin through what ignorance now it's no longer the priesthood the Brad now it's Israel are we together now if Israel sin amen through the same thing he says that and the thing be hidden from the eyes of the assembly and they have done somewhat against any of the Commandment of the Lord concerning things which should not be done and are guilty amen when the sin when the sin which they have sin against it is known to the congregation is known I'm sorry then the congregation shall offer what same sacrifice for the and bring him before the Tabernacle of the lord of the congregation and the Elder of the congregation shall lay their hand upon the head of the Bullock before the Lord and the Bullock shall be killed before the Lord and the priest that is Anointed again shall bring the Bullock's blood to the Tabernacle of the congregation and the preach shall dip his finger are we together in some of the blood and sprinking it how many times seven times before the Lord even before the what the veil so when the priesthood sins and the congregation sin the sacrifice is the same and the procedure is the same and we found out that we gent we were without God we were elated from the common wealth of Israel in other word we didn't know any God so everything we were doing were was by ignorance because you didn't know God we didn't know the Commandment of God are we together and the Jews also killed Jesus by ignorance glory to God the Bible says this in the Book of Luke 23:34 then said Jesus father do what forgive for they know not what they do are we together Jesus asked to ask God to forgive Israel because Israel was ignorant follow me my friend to the killing of the Messiah the Pharisee were under iniquity because they knew better but the people were under ignorance are you following me the people of Israel and the ruler of Israel were ignorant they were influen by the Pharisee to say let his blood be upon us and our children but they didn't know let's go to the book of act am am so we can travel this good let's go to the book of act Lord help me Lord glory to God let's go to the book of act chapter 3 so I see why the spirit of God give me this in the office let's go to the book of act if you understand this Foundation then we s the book of act chapter 3 if you dare you can say amen amen verse 16 you there and his name through faith in his name has made this man strong whom you see and know yet the faith which is by him has given him this perfect sness in the presence of you all because the man was healed are we together let's go to verse 15 so it makes sense you there amen and kill who the Prince of Life whom God has raised from the dead whereof we are what witness so they killed Jesus Christ we clear on that one jump to verse 17 uh verse uh 17 if you dare you can say amen amen and now Brethren I know that you that's through what ignorance you did it as did also your what Your rulers so Israel did it by ignorance this ignorance doesn't go on the Pharisee follow me my friend he go on the people of Israel not the Pharisees and God is saying here Peter is saying here you did it ignorantly sir let's go to First Corinthian so let's stabilize again oh glory to God let's go to First Corinthians 2 Oh Glory to God thank you these things have to be taught so the devil will never remove it from your life if you thereare you can say amen amen 1 Corinthians chapter 2 verse 7 you dare you can say Amen am but we speak what the wisd the wisdom of God in a what mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world to our what Glory which what none of the princes none of the princes of this world knew they didn't know for had they know it if they knew it are we together they will not have crucified the Lord Of Glory so Israel did it through ignorance they were blinded by God are we together now am are we clear now so Israel did it ignorantly we clear thing is clear now coming back to this so if the people sin ignorantly are we together the priest will go and get the blood and kill the sacrifice do you follow me and then take his finger and deep into the blood amen and we know that our priest is the Lord Jesus Christ are we together now we need to know what is the finger of our priest because the priest must take the blood the Bible say Jesus took his own blood and went and sprinkle on the Tabernacle that was not made by hand so we need to know what is the Finger of God are we together are we together let's go to the Book of Luke hallu look Oh Glory to to god let's go to the Book of Luke chap 11 if you thereare you can say amen amen oh praise be to the name of the Lord Luke 11 verse 20 this is Jesus speaking Are We There are we there please make sure you read it because when I will begin to S it's like I put Dynamite now I'm moving with an iPad and I'm just blowing them left and right okay so make sure you know where the dynamite are I'm putting the dynamite on your trouble so when I'm going to S I will just push the button and the but and it's going to start blowing are we together verse 20 but if I Jesus Christ with what the Finger of God cast out Devils no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you Jesus say that he cast the Devil by the Finger of God we need to know clearly what is the Finger of God let's go to Matthew Matthew chapter 12 Oh Glory to God don't you love the scripture amen with the message of the hour the Bible become a new book let's go Matthew 12: 20 8 if you thereare you can say amen amen same thing are we together amen but if I jesus Again cast Devils over there he says the spirit with The Finger of God watch here I cast a devil by what the spirit of God so the Finger of God is what the spirit of God are we clear now are we clear now so the high priest that goes with the sin of the people uses the finger which was stopping the spirit of the Lord sprinkling seven time but we know God have seven [Applause] [Music] Spirit my friend it's written in the Bible how many knows that God has seven Spirit brother Bram say it is not seven different Spirit it is one Spirit manifested seven times and the priest must use the Finger of God the spirit of the Lord and the Seven manifestation to sprinker the blood what do he mean seven times I'm blowing the stuff my friend what does he mean seven times glory to God brother Bram says this in the message Fellowship he said the blood off of this innocent substitute was struck how many times seven times like that as a what a public testimony seven is God's complete what number the seven what church ages the seven last Church ages Church of Philadelphia Church of lodia and the church every what church age must come through the same sh are we together amen because the bride is made of seven churches amen so every portion of the blood must receive a deep of the sacrifice of ignorance because it's a gentile bre so God must forgive you for your ignorance for what you did when you were not in your right mind [Applause] are we together are we together are we together amen are we together amen follow me carefully now we clear the spirit of the Lord will come seven times are we together because the children of God will be caught under ignorance so God the high priest under the Son of God the church ages he have to dip his finger and when Paul comes I'm going to show you even Paul I'm going to show you Paul when arus comes the spirit brings the blood in word without the message of your hour there is no blood the blood comes with the anointing the spirit of the edge the anointing of the edge brings the blood and my blood came under fall so when I am under the Malachi fall I am under the blood under the blood Oh Glory we need to amen people in the message you need to understand what is blood because the blood of Jesus Christ Christ is already gone where is the blood the blood is in the spirit it's a toen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] because the blood the blood is what changed the the Judgment seat into The Mercy [Applause] [Music] Seat The Mercy Seat and the Judgment seat is one thing when the blood is there it's Mercy seek when the blood is gone it's Jud [Applause] so when you leave this message you are moving from the [Applause] blood are we together are we together are we together let me push the break my friend if I lost you raise your hand because I see some people quiet if I L you raise your hand we good let's move are we together are we together are we together now if you notice father please give me time if you notice this Blood was sprinkle on the veil are we together this Veil here was made of budget [Applause] [Music] in other words in when you heard that and the veil of the temple was right it is this Veil here if you if you cut that Veil and you open like this you will see God but if you close the Veil so we got a bad skin there and we got God behind the bad skin there is your verse [Applause] seven it's an animal nature but if you cut the animal [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you Jesus hold on my friend this type of preaching it brings the Holy Spirit to you I don't need to lay hand on you the spirit of the Lord will enter you let me help you let me help you we talking about the veil it was a veil of badger skin that was covering God so if you pass that Veil you see God if you come out then you Veil God are we together listen to this we need to know the veil what is the veil right my brother brother Angel say we need to know the veil listen my friend are we together the Bible said don't tremble my friend this is revelation are we together Hebrew what 10 verse what 20 by a new and a living way which he Jesus Christ has consecrated for us through the water Veil that is to say his what his flesh I'm reading please verify your Bible so the veil that was in the the other is your body spirit and soul so the Tabernacle was a person it was a human being now Paul is explaining to us that the veil that was ripped over there amen was the Flesh of Christ that's why when Christ was on the cross being peace the veil in the temple which was the the the the an so when they caring this they caring over there in other word it's telling you this flesh is what was in the [Applause] Tabernacle if I lost you raise your hand if I lost you raise your hand I'm going to start again I'm going to start again the veil was in the temple amen and Jesus was on the cross but when they catch Jesus the veil on the temple also responded so their veil was in type the body of Jesus Christ that's why Paul say that the veil was the Flesh of Jesus Christ are we together are we together are we together so when you cut the Flesh of Jesus Christ who was supposed to be inside are you ready you ready to swallow this you are ready to swallow this are you going to swallow it yes sir say you swallow it okay she say she's going to swallow what is the Flesh of Jesus Christ [Applause] can I continue can I continue the Bible say in Ephesian 5 for we are what members of his body of his what his flesh and of his his [Applause] bones so the veil of Jesus Christ the veil of God is you that's why the blood the blood are we together are we [Applause] together Glory are we together for this cause for this cause shall a what man leave his what his father and mother and shall be join to his his wife and the two shall be one one flesh one what one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning who Christ and the church [Applause] remember that veil was veiling [Applause] God that veil was veiling [Applause] who notice the old Veil that he what the glory the what old Badger skin there was no Beauty to be desire of nether was his flesh that is the reason say I mean people say a little old stupid fellow like that probably 30 years old and gray and he's

preaching jumping when the preacher is preaching amen Oh Glory Oh Glory Glory to [Applause] God are you ready are you ready he says sitting together in a what a heart building like this you never got they called them no much Beauty to be what desired but what was on the inside [Applause] I am sure it is veiled from what many heart you see all right you ready to swallow this you ready to swallow this glory to God we notice another thing in the Old Testament I have scripture here in Exodus that the old what Badger skin what did he do he hid what the glory of God from the people the Bader skin even the people could not see it because he was a skin that did what held it the skin the glory of God was behind skin and now now now the Glorious God is behind amen are God Amen there at that time it was Jesus Christ in this time it's not Jesus Christ it is me the glory of [Music] God are we together are we together Oh Glory are we together it says now the glory of God is out your skin that is right and the tradition don't see it it is inside the veil where his word [Applause] was are gods and all of you are children of the most high you are the one hiding his glory Christ in me the hope of [Applause] glory are we together are we together we understand now whatever happened in Leviticus now let's go to Luke 15 Oh Glory thank J you shall know the truth my friend and the truth shall set you free that's why you hear Brother Bram say whatever spoke of the groom speaks of the BR you don't understand what he's saying hallelujah Oh Glory let's go to Luke 15 my friend Lord help me thank you Lord father Hallelujah if you thereare you can say amen amen look 15: 11 Oh Glory to God the Bible say and he said are we together a certain man had two sons and the younger one of them said to his father father give me the portion of good that falls to me and he divided to them his living and not many days after the youngest son gathered all together and took his journey where into a far country into a far country oh God help me are we together remember the younger son tap the brother we clear on that one okay the younger one tap the brother and the Elder is Israel we already went through this but something happened to the younger one he says and to a far country and there he wasted his substance with what righteous living with rightous living amen we need to be specific rightous living was with who with Harlot are we together amen if you have a question on that one you can look on verse 30 and you'll find it are we together now jump to verse 17 Oh Glory and when he came to himself he said how many highed servant of my fathers have bred enough and to spare and I perish with what hunger when he came to himself are we together so this boy before he left home lost his mind is my Bible different than yours please don't slow me time I mean the door don't slow me down I'm trying to move on this boy a home he has a mind amen a mind worthy of a son are we together then when he left home he went with a different mind because remember uh job to verse 18 I will arise and go to my father and will say to him father I have sin against heaven and before you watch verse 19 and I am no no more worthy to to be called who thy son because what he did is not worthy of the son of that father are we together so there is a way a son of that father behaves to bring respect to that father are we together so a home he had mind he was worthy of a son of that father are we together when he left to a far country amen when he left to a far country amen he left with [Music] mind outside of home into a far country amen amen the son had another man amen and that mind brought him to a [Music] prostitute not the mind at home the mind at home would have protected [Applause] him the mind at home is verse six the Mind outside of home is verse seven go are we together but the problem is even though he left with another man L are we together God loaded the first mind in [Applause] him are we together and put a time when that mind will kicking [Applause] [Music] are we are we together are we together are we together so when he left home he left with another man and that man is to enjoy sin with prostitute he lost everything he destroyed the inheritage of his father the good voice God gave him he was singing in the nightclub the strength God gave him he was beating his friends so he spare everything but in him there was another man with a [Applause] time in other word are we together when he was at home he didn't have any age he was eternal he didn't have a beginning he didn't have a ending he didn't have a mother he didn't have a father but when he entered to a far away country he pick up a father and a mother and maybe he was born in 1960 with this man I don't know who born in 1960 I just pick it up then God took this mind and wrote Under This mind are you following me 19 1985 so two man are moving 1960 kicking shaping sin shaping iniquity coming into this world speaking lies then he begin to display the attribute contrary to his father Hallelujah are we together then in 1985 he came to [Applause] himself the computer begin to pop [Applause] up are we together are we together in other word whatever he did from 1960 all the way to 1985 25 years he was out of his [Applause] mind he was not him but remember he cannot go back home without the first man it is the F man that will change his position and begin to pull him toward home [Applause] are we together in PL word what he did in 25 years amen amen he did it [Applause] [Music] ignorantly why the stepen he was doing it enjoying it you say he did it ignorantly let's start claming my friend Oh Glory to God are we together are we together amen we found out that brother Bram last Sunday says that the spirit of BM is another form of the spirit of Jezebel this ignorance will spare you a lot of stuff you did you will see it sooner amen brother said bam was Jezebel in another form the quote is there bam was a male Jezebel was a woman how can brother Bram say they were the Same Spirit remember the message and the Bible are perfectly in line when you don't understand brother Bram push the break humble yourself accept what he said first then God will vend and illuminate you when brother says this he never gave a scripture but watch what the spirit of the Lord does are we together Revelation 2 I have few things against it because that has them that hold the doctrine of who B who taught B to cast stabing block before the children of Israel are we there the doctrine of bam to eat what these things things sacrifice unto idols and commit what fornication so bam taught them to eat think sacrifice unto ad and to commit fornication we clear now not withstanding I have few things look I have few things do you see that I have few things against thee not withstanding I have few things against same thing because that suffer that woman who Jezebel which call herself a prophet to teach are we together and to seduce my servant to do what commit fornication commit fornication and to eat things sacrifice and to what Idols so jel and Bam are the same thing if I you raise your hand bam sacrifice to Adam commit fornication Jezebel sacrifice to Adam commit that's why brother Bram say Jezebel and B were the same thing only different name or different form but the characteristic is the same Hallelujah Jesus and brother Charles are the [Applause] [Music] same only different name and different form but the characteristic is the same because Jesus say the work that I do you shall do also amen are we together oh glory to God are we together then when we Trace Jezebel we found that Jezebel according to Revelation 17 she was mystery B on the great the mother of what har and we found the youngest son was CAU with what harot which was the Gentile church but the catching of the Harlot was ignorantly so he required a sacrifice that's why the father say kill the F dead Cal because the blood of the Cal can be can be speak seven times are we together are we [Applause] together brother stepen so you mean somebody who did something bad and

didn't know because have you known you would not have done it have you known you would not have crucified the Prince of Peace even though you say let his blood you didn't know that's why Jesus said forgive them they don't know what they're [Applause] doing listen the mind that you were born with is not your right man there is only one right man it's the mind of Christ so all of us were out of our [Applause] mind as much as you think you knew you didn't know and matter of fact 5 years later you say I wish I knew what I know now 5 years and we shall know what I know now but the mind of Christ you don't teach it he knows everything we byass that man through our but now before we go back we must meet that [Applause] man are we together are we together brother Sten somebody enjoying

home review this again and Lord's willing we pick up on Sunday and we clam again higher are we together are we together are we together are we together there is a calf there is a lamb there is a sacrifice that have been sent to pray to plead for our ignorance everything you have ever done amen outside the message and for those that were born in the message and were doing bad things like Paul God summarized all of that and put it under the scene of ignorance in sin in unbelief and because it's ignorance and the sin of unbelief God is under obligation to wipe it completely because it's the atonement it is the attribute of God that produced are we together are we together Hallelujah tell that devil whatever you keep bringing I don't know what you're bringing because we have a difficulty saying that we didn't do it your natural conscience block you brother Bram say you never done it but your conscience say I know brother Bram say that but you know better that you did it so today get another answer and tell that devil I did it ignor IGN [Applause] L because this is what you want I did it ignorantly in unbelief now go ahead and handle that one because Paul suffered Paul suffered A persecuted the church I'm not worthy to be called Apostle and then he he he he he he stagger and stop somewhere he say but I am what I am but in other words you got to make put a stop to your blaming and say listen God knew this there is nothing new in my life that God doesn't know before he sent me this word he already so and he provided the lamb and he's telling me everything I did was under ignorance so therefore from today Satan I did it under [Applause] ignorance so that the grace of God can be expressed through me because without that ignorance I would not have known Jesus as a savior I would not have known Jesus as a redeemer I would not have known Jesus as a Healer he took that ignorance to produce the attribute of God God richly bless you let's stand my [Applause] friend hallu hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you shall know the truth and the truth shall send you free amen either you cling to your own idea of trying to justify yourself and keep regretting that I wish I

made manifest in your life amen amen amen so when brother CH brag and say Jesus loved me and I say yes he loved me too he saved me I say he saved me too he loved me more no no no no I don't think so he loved me more because I know what he did for me and he become an individual Revelation between you and Jesus Christ let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this afternoon

to the man but because the way the man was wired a presidential letter must come maybe from the mayor of the city maybe from the Prime Minister maybe he have to be looking like a golden leather with the stamp of the United States brought by a sheriff all kind of protocol to bring that letter and because of that twisting of mind the man lost his pardon and was shot and killed because he didn't understand the Simplicity of the pardon father this sermon might not be compared with other big preacher sermon but Lord father you choose to bring this truth in a simple way to make your children understand that it's very simple everything that we ever done was produced by the atonement and we did it ignorantly so that the atonement can be effective in our life and have its place to manifest it so that you can show through us the vessels of Glory The Riches of your mystery of your kingdom of Lord father your saving power so that at the end you can show us Lord father as a trophy of Lord your Redemption but Lord let none of us here Lord neglect Lord such a Salvation let no one Lord father despise Lord father the way this message are coming Lord but may we take it as a pardon because it won't be accepted as a pardon if we don't recognize this as a pardon father you gave a sacrifice to free us to Deliver Us from all our guiltiness of the past those time that the devil has been using to beat us up up and down up and down up and down until we lack joy and we feel like we miserable under this truth Lord but this truth came to set us free to make us a joyful Pride knowing Lord father that we are your children we are the children of the most high God we are god father Lord Jesus Christ because of us you left Heaven you came down to shed that blood so that that blood can be
