[42:22] redemption of the soul

[42:27] devil was really mad

[42:56] uh david
[42:57] give me more and he removed from there
[43:01] and dug another well that's the third
[43:03] one which we saw on sunday was the
[43:05] baptism of the holy ghost
[43:07] amen and for day
[43:11] for and for that destroy of note in
[43:13] other words there was no fight
[43:14] no struggle over there once you get the
[43:17] holy ghost there is no more fighting
[43:19] amen no more fighting with yourself
[43:22] there is a different fight that you get
[43:24] in
[43:26] and he called the name of it ryoboth
[43:29] and he said for now the lord has made
[43:33] room for us that was referred them there
[43:36] is a lot of
[43:37] rest not a resting place for one person
[43:40] but for many
[43:41] people everybody clear so there is room
[43:43] for everybody
[43:45] for now the lord has made room for us
[43:48] and we shall be fruitful in the land you
[43:51] might be seated
[43:52] so when they reached the third step here
[43:55] which is real about
[43:58] which gave them more room
[44:02] that was the place that jacob explained
[44:05] or expressed that they're going to be
[44:08] fruitful now
[44:09] in the land in other words once you
[44:11] reach the third one
[44:13] once you get or you enter into the rest
[44:16] then
[44:16] you can begin to produce fruit or you
[44:19] can become
[44:20] fruitful everybody clear so far let's go
[44:23] to john chapter 15.
[44:33] john chapter 15 verse 1.
[44:36] if you dare you can say amen
[44:40] jesus says that i am the true vine
[44:44] and my father is the husbandman
[44:47] in other words the fine dresser every
[44:50] branch in me
[44:51] so that branch must be in christ
[44:54] you cannot be outside and expect to be
[44:57] fruitful
[44:59] amen to be fruitful you need to be
[45:02] connected
[45:03] or grounded in christ you need to drink
[45:06] from the water
[45:07] from the rock that was stricken by the
[45:10] prophet
[45:11] everybody clear every branch in me that
[45:14] bear not
[45:14] fruit again we're talking about fruit
[45:18] okay every branch in meat that bear not
[45:21] fruit
[45:22] he takes it away and every branch that
[45:24] bears fruit he purges it
[45:27] that he may bring forth more fruit
[45:30] everybody clear verse 3
[45:32] now you are clean through the word
[45:36] which i have spoken to you so
[45:39] right here you can see that
[45:41] sanctification
[45:43] comes by the word
[45:47] anybody clear if you're a little sleepy
[45:50] just
[45:50] shake your hand wake up
[45:54] amen verse 4 a body in me
[45:57] and i in you in other words remain there
[46:02] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[46:04] itself
[46:05] except it abide in the vine
[46:09] no more can you expect except you abide
[46:12] in me so there is no way you can bear
[46:16] fruit
[46:16] if you are not grounded in christ amen
[46:20] you must reach the third well of jacob
[46:24] at that point you become fruitful in the
[46:26] land
[46:27] verse 6
[46:32] verse 5 i am divine you are the branches
[46:36] he that abides in me and i in him
[46:39] the same brings forth much fruit
[46:43] for we that mean you can do what
[46:46] so you must be connected to christ
[46:49] without christ you can do nothing
[46:54] amen verse six if a man abide not
[46:58] in me he is cut he's cut forth as a
[47:02] branch
[47:03] and he's withered and men gather them
[47:06] and cuts them into the fire and they are
[47:09] burned
[47:10] if you abide in me and my words
[47:15] abide in you you shall ask what you will
[47:19] and it shall be done unto you
[47:24] verse 8 herein is my father
[47:27] glorify or honor that you bear much
[47:31] water
[47:32] so that you shall be my disciple
[47:35] if you are a true disciple you must
[47:38] manifest the fruit of god
[47:41] if there is no fruit in your life you
[47:44] need to stop your car
[47:45] and go back to the shop anybody clear
[47:49] so something is wrong job to verse 16
[47:53] you have not chosen me
[47:57] that's what i like about it your car
[48:00] is neutral you have not chosen me
[48:04] but i have chosen you
[48:07] whether you like it or not you have been
[48:10] chosen by god
[48:12] amen and oh damn
[48:16] you or predestinated you
[48:19] or i have appointed you and ordain
[48:23] you that you should go and bring forth
[48:26] water
[48:27] so those fruit you don't have to
[48:30] manufacture them
[48:32] you just need to be connected to christ
[48:34] and
[48:35] automatically by predestination
[48:38] you're going to begin to bring the fruit
[48:40] that god ordained you to bring forth
[48:44] amen and bring forth fruit
[48:48] and that your fruit should what remain
[48:51] it's eternal
[48:52] that whatsoever you shall ask of the
[48:55] father in my
[48:56] name he may give it to you
[49:00] over there he says that his word have to
[49:02] abide in you
[49:04] amen once his word abiding you then you
[49:07] can ask
[49:08] and here he says that if you are
[49:10] fruitful you can ask
[49:12] in other words to get to that point you
[49:14] need the holy spirit
[49:16] you need the rest of god let's go to
[49:19] romans
[49:20] 7 then we're going to pray
[49:23] amen hallelujah
[49:27] romans 7 verse 2.
[49:32] we gave you the scripture a lot of time
[49:36] if somebody is not receiving text
[49:39] message
[49:41] and need to vote you need to contact me
[49:45] or contact one of the deacon or the
[49:47] trustees so we make sure we clear that
[49:50] up
[49:50] we don't want anybody feel like they
[49:52] were left behind
[49:54] and they were not given opportunity to
[49:56] speak
[49:57] because you speak by your vote romans 7
[50:01] verse 2 for the woman which have a
[50:04] husband
[50:06] is bound by the lord to her husband
[50:09] so long as he lives
[50:12] but if the husband be dead
[50:16] she is losed from the law of her husband
[50:19] that's the reason why david have to kill
[50:21] uriah
[50:24] verse three so then if while her husband
[50:28] leaves
[50:29] she be married to another man she shall
[50:32] be called
[50:33] an adulteress but if her husband
[50:36] be dead that first nature she is free
[50:40] from that law so that she is no
[50:43] adulteress
[50:44] does she be married to another one so to
[50:47] be married with christ
[50:49] your first husband must die amen
[50:52] verse 4 wherefore my brethren
[50:56] you also are become dead to the law
[51:00] by the body of christ by being
[51:03] identified in the body of christ you
[51:06] become dead to the lord
[51:08] amen that you should be married
[51:11] to another one to a new husband
[51:14] even to him that's the husband
[51:18] even to him who raised from the dead
[51:22] and the husband that rose from the dead
[51:24] his name is who
[51:26] okay jesus that we should bring forth
[51:29] water
[51:30] unto her if you're not
[51:34] married with him there is no way you can
[51:37] bring
[51:38] fruit anybody clear verse 5
[51:42] for when we were in the flesh in other
[51:44] words living in a flesh
[51:46] because paul was still in the flesh when
[51:49] we were in the
[51:50] flesh the motions of sin
[51:54] which were by the law did work in our
[51:57] members
[51:58] to bring forth fruit to die to death
[52:01] so they are fruit and unto life and
[52:04] fruit unto death
[52:06] when we were married with our first
[52:08] husband which is the world
[52:09] we were bringing fruit unto death things
[52:12] that were not good we were cussing
[52:15] lying cheating stealing doing all those
[52:17] kind of stuff
[52:18] but once you are married with christ you
[52:21] must bring a
[52:22] different kind of fruit in other words
[52:25] when you call yourself
[52:26] christian we are expecting something
[52:29] different than what you had before
[52:31] you cannot be a christian and continue
[52:33] to lie
[52:35] you cannot be a christian and continue
[52:37] to cheat
[52:38] a christian everything is dead and you
[52:41] become
[52:41] a new creation ever clear
[52:45] let's pray then heavenly father
[52:48] lord we thank you again for your grace
[52:50] you love your mercy father
[52:52] and for everything you have been doing
[52:54] for us lord thank you for giving us
[52:56] another opportunity
[52:58] to gather together in your house around
[53:00] the revealed word of the hour
[53:02] lord this is a mid-week service
[53:05] where your children have been at work
[53:07] and from work they made their way
[53:09] all the way lord father to this house
[53:12] lord our body are tired but you know
[53:15] lord that our spirit are still
[53:17] yearning to hear from the lord father
[53:20] you the god
[53:21] that gives strength you are else shadow
[53:24] lord father may you give strength and
[53:26] energy to your children
[53:28] lord may you remove every spirit of
[53:31] tiredness lord
[53:32] every spirit lord of sleepiness lord may
[53:35] you observe
[53:36] an anointing tonight lord that can lord
[53:38] father geared
[53:40] our mind our heart has so lord
[53:43] to be centered into the word of life
[53:45] lord
[53:46] that can produce fruit lord father we
[53:48] committed
[53:49] unto the hand be the alpha and the omega
[53:52] the beginning and the end of the service
[53:54] lord as we ask it in the name
[53:57] that is most powerful name which is the
[53:59] name of jesus christ
[54:01] amen god bless you you already
[54:04] been seated we are continuing for where
[54:08] we left on on sunday on king ahazares
[54:12] three fists and esther's two banquet we
[54:15] already seen the first
[54:16] fist the second the turn we finished the
[54:19] first banquet this is in preparation
[54:21] to the second banquet because if we
[54:23] enter there without these
[54:25] elements it's going to be difficult for
[54:27] you to catch what is hidden
[54:29] in symbol in the scripture because the
[54:31] bible
[54:32] is written in mysteries on sunday
[54:35] we stop in referendum and we say that
[54:38] referendum means rest or
[54:41] resting place and there were not only
[54:43] one rest
[54:44] but there were many rest or many resting
[54:47] places
[54:48] which spoke about rio above which is a
[54:51] place where there is room for
[54:53] everybody because the promise of the
[54:55] holy spirit is not only for one person
[54:58] amen he came in jordan but jesus says
[55:00] that it is expedient
[55:02] it is better for me to go because if i
[55:05] don't go
[55:05] there is no way that i can send the holy
[55:07] spirit amen
[55:09] and when peter spoke in the day of
[55:11] pentecost
[55:12] he says that the promise is unto you to
[55:14] your children
[55:15] and as many as the lord your god shall
[55:18] call
[55:18] so until the lord shut the way i mean
[55:22] the door
[55:22] like he did the ark of noah there is
[55:25] still room
[55:26] for everybody and that everybody means
[55:29] the predestinated
[55:31] seed of god everybody clear so far
[55:35] now when we spoke in referendum
[55:38] moses went to horrible when he went to
[55:41] all to horeb
[55:42] he struck the rock and when the rock was
[55:45] squeaking we know that that rock spoke
[55:47] about christ we gave you the scripture
[55:49] on sunday water came out of that water
[55:52] and brother branham explained to us that
[55:54] the water was the holy
[55:57] spirit which was quenching the thirst
[56:00] of the soul because david have two tests
[56:03] to thirst he says that my soul was
[56:06] testing after the living god
[56:08] and we also demonstrated to you that not
[56:10] only was the soul
[56:12] testing but the body also was testing
[56:15] for
[56:16] their living god so there was a test for
[56:18] the soul
[56:19] and it turns for the body there is a
[56:21] redemption for the soul
[56:23] and there is also a redemption for your
[56:27] body that's the reason why even though
[56:29] you have the holy spirit
[56:31] you are subject to sickness you are
[56:33] subject to pain
[56:34] you are subject to aging you are subject
[56:37] to many different temptations
[56:39] because your body is not redeemed
[56:42] yet everybody clear no problem
[56:45] so the holy spirit or the drinking of
[56:48] the water
[56:49] in referendum deal with the inner man
[56:52] which is the soul
[56:53] and complete the redemption of the body
[56:56] or the redemption
[56:58] or the redemption of the soul or the
[57:00] redemption
[57:01] of the inner man the first part is
[57:04] completely done
[57:05] but it is not finished you still have
[57:08] one more step to go
[57:09] anybody clear praise the name of the
[57:11] lord now
[57:13] how this
[57:16] does this process of the holy spirit
[57:19] get into you amen we spoke about we need
[57:23] to drink water from refuge
[57:26] we understand that we need to drink that
[57:28] spiritual water
[57:29] so that we can receive rest for our soul
[57:32] so how does that rest happen
[57:36] you ready let's go to ephesians
[57:40] chapter one
[57:44] now we are moving
[57:47] ephesians chapter one you really need
[57:49] your bible
[57:51] you need the scripture
[57:54] ephesians chapter 1 verse 13
[58:05] we preach you need the holy ghost you
[58:06] need the word ghost you need the holy
[58:08] ghost how does it happen
[58:10] you need the holy ghost you need the
[58:12] holy ghost you need the holy ghost how
[58:13] do we get the holy ghost
[58:17] amen young people you need the holy
[58:20] ghost how do you get the holy ghost
[58:26] ephesians chapter 1 verse 13 if you dare
[58:29] you can say amen
[58:32] in whom let's go to verse 12 so you get
[58:35] the background
[58:37] that we should be to the praise of his
[58:40] glory everybody
[58:41] get me pretty good clear honestly okay
[58:45] that we should be to the praise of his
[58:48] glory
[58:49] who first trusted in who so we are
[58:52] talking about
[58:53] christ anybody clear that rock
[58:56] that was moving that living rock
[58:59] amen in whom in christ
[59:04] in whom you also did what
[59:07] so the first thing there is a trust
[59:10] into christ everybody clear we are going
[59:14] deeply here come on
[59:18] after that you heard the word of water
[59:21] so number one when we are talking about
[59:24] the holy spirit
[59:26] you must first hear the word of truth
[59:32] clear and when you hear that word of
[59:35] truth
[59:36] you must trust in that word
[59:40] everybody clear i'm giving you the bible
[59:43] prescription
[59:45] this is before the door of the gentile
[59:47] closed
[59:48] in whom you also trusted
[59:51] kama after
[59:54] that you heard the word of truth
[59:58] what is the word of truth comer the
[1:00:01] gospel of your salvation
[1:00:05] so this word is the gospel and this
[1:00:08] gospel
[1:00:09] is meant for your salvation
[1:00:13] are you following me praise the name of
[1:00:15] the lord
[1:00:17] in whom also the same man
[1:00:21] christ after that you what
[1:00:25] so we are talking not only a trust
[1:00:28] in god but this choice goes deeper
[1:00:32] to the point that you must believe
[1:00:36] amen
[1:00:40] praise the name of the lord come on you
[1:00:43] are what with the
[1:00:47] holy ghost of what so there is a promise
[1:00:51] of the holy spirit amen
[1:00:54] that promise must be preached unto you
[1:00:59] amen we must present unto you
[1:01:02] the plan of god or the purpose of god
[1:01:05] for your life god does not
[1:01:09] want you to work for christianity
[1:01:13] god does not want you to labor
[1:01:16] for your christian life god doesn't want
[1:01:19] you to struggle
[1:01:21] to be able to live a christian life
[1:01:24] god have a remedy for you
[1:01:28] god have an answer for you
[1:01:31] and the answer somebody must present you
[1:01:34] the promise
[1:01:36] and that promise is for everybody
[1:01:39] that promise is in referendum that
[1:01:42] promise spoke about
[1:01:43] robot there is room for everybody
[1:01:47] but when the promise comes it comes in
[1:01:50] the form of the word of the truth
[1:01:53] which is the gospel of your salvation
[1:01:56] and once the word is preached unto you
[1:01:59] your responsibility is number one you
[1:02:02] must trust
[1:02:03] into christ are you following me
[1:02:08] then you must believe the world
[1:02:11] amen once you believe that word
[1:02:14] according to paul
[1:02:15] then you gonna be what still with the
[1:02:19] holy spirit
[1:02:20] amen if they preach the word
[1:02:23] and you are not sealed so something
[1:02:27] is wrong in this process
[1:02:30] if the car doesn't crack there is
[1:02:34] something missing somewhere there is a
[1:02:37] glitch somewhere
[1:02:39] either you heard the word intellectually
[1:02:43] but you never believe or trusted in that
[1:02:46] world
[1:02:49] and if you don't believe you can never
[1:02:52] be
[1:02:53] sealed because the ceiling
[1:02:56] is the recognition of your faith
[1:03:02] abraham believe god
[1:03:07] amen amen god spoke to abraham
[1:03:12] then abraham believed god
[1:03:15] and it was what imputed unto him for
[1:03:19] what
[1:03:20] then they gave them the seal of what see
[1:03:24] concession
[1:03:27] is that clear from the bible if you miss
[1:03:30] the holy ghost
[1:03:31] it's going to be on you amen
[1:03:35] how do we get the holy ghost how do we
[1:03:38] receive this rest
[1:03:40] go to james chapter 1.
[1:03:44] hallelujah we're going to deal with this
[1:03:47] redemption
[1:03:48] then we go to the body and we enter your
[1:03:50] second banquet
[1:03:55] because there there are symbols the king
[1:03:57] is mad the king getting and the king get
[1:04:00] out
[1:04:00] and they can come and hang a man
[1:04:03] there's a lot of stuff there you need to
[1:04:06] be prepared
[1:04:07] so once we begin to open those symbols
[1:04:11] it click like
[1:04:13] we get it james chapter 1 verse 8
[1:04:17] if you dare you can say amen
[1:04:29] hallelujah
[1:04:34] i'm trying to get it here i hope i wrote
[1:04:37] it right
[1:04:40] give me a minute
[1:04:46] and i'm going to try to find it pretty
[1:04:49] good
[1:04:52] chapter 1 verse 20 one
[1:04:57] i hope i wrote this correctly
[1:05:05] james let's go to verse seven
[1:05:10] or six actually if you're there you can
[1:05:13] say amen
[1:05:15] but let him ask in what
[1:05:18] you see that nothing weathering
[1:05:22] for he the weather is like
[1:05:26] a wave of the sea driven with the wind
[1:05:30] and tossed for let not
[1:05:33] that man think that he shall receive
[1:05:36] anything of the lord
[1:05:40] anybody clear praise the name of the
[1:05:42] lord
[1:05:45] job to verse 18
[1:05:49] 17 actually every good gift
[1:05:53] and every perfect gift is from water
[1:05:58] ever clear you shall receive the
[1:06:01] gift of the holy spirit it's a perfect
[1:06:05] gift
[1:06:05] it's a good gift it is a gift that
[1:06:08] brings you
[1:06:08] rest everybody clear every good
[1:06:12] gift every good gift and every prophet
[1:06:16] gift is from above and comes down
[1:06:20] from the father of lights plural
[1:06:24] with whom is no variableness need a
[1:06:27] shadow of what
[1:06:28] turning verse 18 of his own water
[1:06:35] everybody clear of his own will
[1:06:39] father he has with water
[1:06:44] are you looking in that of his own will
[1:06:47] the will of the father he works
[1:06:50] everything according to his own will
[1:06:52] of his own will further he in other
[1:06:56] words he
[1:06:56] buffs us everybody clear
[1:07:00] father he has with the word of what
[1:07:03] so our birth depend on the word of what
[1:07:08] everybody clear here that's why paul
[1:07:11] said that first
[1:07:12] you heard the word of truth because you
[1:07:15] are giving birth
[1:07:16] by the word amen
[1:07:19] but that word is not the letter
[1:07:22] it is a living word that is preached
[1:07:25] unto you
[1:07:26] everybody clear verse 18
[1:07:29] of his own will father he has
[1:07:32] with the word of truth that we should be
[1:07:36] the kind of first fruit of his what
[1:07:39] creature ever clear
[1:07:41] so james is again insisting to us here
[1:07:44] that when we get birthed by the father
[1:07:47] we our birth comes from the
[1:07:49] word of truth which we know it's the
[1:07:51] gospel of our
[1:07:52] salvation everybody clear praise the
[1:07:55] name of the
[1:07:56] lord let's go to first peter chapter one
[1:08:02] amen
[1:08:06] if you dare you can say amen peter
[1:08:09] follow james
[1:08:12] first peter chapter one verse two
[1:08:16] polish peter is talking to him
[1:08:20] first two can you read with me
[1:08:25] it's a chosen one not everybody
[1:08:29] elect anybody clear he left
[1:08:32] according to what the full knowledge of
[1:08:36] god the father
[1:08:38] amen predestination through
[1:08:41] sanctification of the water are taught
[1:08:44] to hear they say
[1:08:46] sanctification of the world
[1:08:50] amen let's continue through
[1:08:53] sanctification of the spirit
[1:08:56] to obedience and speaking of the blood
[1:08:59] of jesus christ
[1:09:01] grace to you and peace be what multiply
[1:09:04] drop to verse 22 now amen
[1:09:08] seeing you have
[1:09:13] seen you have purify your water
[1:09:18] so this is speaking about the
[1:09:20] purification
[1:09:21] of your soul in other words the
[1:09:24] redemption
[1:09:26] of your soul your soul you were born in
[1:09:30] sin
[1:09:31] shaping iniquity coming into the world
[1:09:34] speaking lies by nature
[1:09:36] you heard a wrong nature that's why
[1:09:39] david said my soul
[1:09:41] percept for the living god amen by the
[1:09:44] purifying of the soul
[1:09:47] everybody clear saying you have purify
[1:09:51] your soul
[1:09:52] in obeying water do you see right here
[1:09:56] amen so believe here goes with obedience
[1:10:05] if you don't have the holy ghost keep
[1:10:07] checking those
[1:10:08] amen saying you have purified your souls
[1:10:13] in obeying the truth through the spirit
[1:10:16] you see that to unfair
[1:10:20] love of the brethren genuine love
[1:10:24] see that you love one another with a
[1:10:27] pure
[1:10:28] heart fervently watch verse 23
[1:10:32] being water born again
[1:10:36] not of what corruptible seed
[1:10:40] but of what incorruptible
[1:10:43] by there we are back again right here
[1:10:48] amen by the word of god
[1:10:51] but that word brother stephen just told
[1:10:54] you it is not a letter
[1:10:56] that word come out from the by the word
[1:10:59] of god which what
[1:11:01] so it's a living word it is a word that
[1:11:05] move
[1:11:06] it is a word that can talk it is a word
[1:11:09] that can
[1:11:09] jump it is a living being
[1:11:13] by the living word amen by the word of
[1:11:17] god which lives and what
[1:11:19] a bad for ever in other words by the
[1:11:24] logos
[1:11:26] clear that's why it is important
[1:11:30] to keep the word of god pure
[1:11:35] amen when we preach the word of god
[1:11:39] the word of god must be delivered the
[1:11:42] way
[1:11:42] it is intended by god to be delivered
[1:11:47] because the birth of god children
[1:11:50] depend on the word of god
[1:11:57] hallelujah romans 10 verse
[1:12:00] 17 so faith
[1:12:03] cometh by what
[1:12:07] we're talking about belief here right
[1:12:10] are we okay believe it you got stressed
[1:12:14] it goes deeper belief believe speaking
[1:12:17] about faith
[1:12:19] faith cometh by what hearing what
[1:12:23] we're back again at number one
[1:12:27] everybody clear faith cometh by
[1:12:31] hearing and hearing of the word of god
[1:12:36] so that's why the word delivering this
[1:12:39] pupil
[1:12:40] must be pure the bible says
[1:12:44] brother branham says if you mix it with
[1:12:47] something
[1:12:48] you're gonna cause a mess
[1:12:51] to the birth of the children of god why
[1:12:55] do until we see the holy ghost the way
[1:12:57] it's supposed to be
[1:12:59] amen second corinthians chapter 2 verse
[1:13:02] 17.
[1:13:04] for we are not as what
[1:13:07] there are many not few we are not
[1:13:10] as many which do what
[1:13:14] so there are many people that are
[1:13:17] corrupting the word of god
[1:13:20] and by corrupting the word of god
[1:13:23] you are closing or you are inhibiting
[1:13:27] the channel of birth by the holy ghost
[1:13:34] which corrupts the word of god but as of
[1:13:37] sincerity
[1:13:39] but as of god in the sight of god
[1:13:42] speak within christ ii corinthians
[1:13:45] chapter four verse two
[1:13:48] but have renounced to the hidden things
[1:13:51] of dishonesty
[1:13:53] not working in craftiness
[1:13:56] not handling the word of god what
[1:14:00] to deceive the people it will never
[1:14:03] bring birth
[1:14:08] but by manifestation of the truth
[1:14:12] commanding ourselves to every man's
[1:14:14] conscience in the sight of
[1:14:16] god first thessalonians chapter 2 verse
[1:14:19] 3
[1:14:20] for our exaltation was not of what
[1:14:25] nor uncleanness nor in what
[1:14:28] paul is insisting on the word
[1:14:31] because the word is very important
[1:14:34] if god say hey you must deliver a
[1:14:38] if god say be you must deliver be
[1:14:42] that's why we must repeat the prophet
[1:14:49] when i say when brother branham said
[1:14:51] come on
[1:14:52] we put camera people got
[1:14:56] where is he taking us to because of this
[1:15:00] amen i am not talking about the
[1:15:03] grammatic
[1:15:05] call error of the message
[1:15:09] or the grammar of the message i am
[1:15:12] talking about
[1:15:13] the message as christ
[1:15:17] the concept the channel of inspiration
[1:15:20] of brother problem
[1:15:22] repeat it the way he was given
[1:15:25] i'm not going to stand here and brother
[1:15:28] branham says 700
[1:15:29] and i'm going to repeat 700. that is not
[1:15:32] what i'm saying
[1:15:33] amen when brother brother says 700 i'm
[1:15:37] not better
[1:15:38] and i'm gonna tell you seven thousand
[1:15:40] and he already corrected it amen
[1:15:43] but what i'm saying to stay with the
[1:15:45] word
[1:15:46] is to repeat it according to the
[1:15:49] aspiration he was given
[1:15:51] because if you change the inspiration
[1:15:54] you are affecting the birth
[1:15:56] of the children of god amen
[1:16:00] oh i have to give that rope so somebody
[1:16:03] can hang himself up
[1:16:05] i'm not going to listen to him anymore
[1:16:07] thank god
[1:16:08] amen in the message the greatest brother
[1:16:11] ever thought
[1:16:13] but your mind accepted in other words
[1:16:16] when we are preaching the word
[1:16:19] we showed you in the church where we
[1:16:21] came out
[1:16:22] that in our body we have the brain
[1:16:26] everybody following me and the brain who
[1:16:29] explained it to you
[1:16:30] we gave you code that is operated by the
[1:16:32] spirit
[1:16:33] anybody clear then we have the heart
[1:16:36] which is the occupancy of your soul amen
[1:16:40] if i stand on a pulpit here and i say
[1:16:43] blah blah blah blah blah blah it doesn't
[1:16:46] make sense
[1:16:47] you don't understand what i'm saying
[1:16:49] that's why paul said when i pray
[1:16:51] or what i see when i sing i can sing in
[1:16:54] tongues but i also have to sing with
[1:16:56] what
[1:16:57] understanding and paul said that if
[1:16:59] there is no translator
[1:17:01] don't say anything because we don't get
[1:17:03] the message
[1:17:04] the trumpet must give a clear sound so
[1:17:08] we know what to do whether it's for war
[1:17:10] or something else
[1:17:11] anybody following me so when we come and
[1:17:14] say
[1:17:15] but we don't know what you're talking
[1:17:16] about but when i say jesus
[1:17:18] love you the first
[1:17:22] line inside your body that grasp
[1:17:25] the word is your brain amen
[1:17:29] that's why we have translator so that we
[1:17:32] make sure
[1:17:33] what was preached in french is
[1:17:35] translated in english
[1:17:37] so that the one in english can catch it
[1:17:40] first
[1:17:41] by the brain you understanding what they
[1:17:44] are saying
[1:17:45] but it is not mad for the brain
[1:17:48] are you following me because the spirit
[1:17:52] have father let he have memory
[1:17:55] he has imagination he has conscience all
[1:17:58] of that faith
[1:18:00] ever clear so you don't send the word
[1:18:03] in the intent to hit the brain
[1:18:09] i'm gonna go slowly
[1:18:12] so it's gonna help you brother branham
[1:18:15] say
[1:18:16] your mind accepted that's where it comes
[1:18:19] from

[1:18:56] when life comes down that channel
[1:18:59] into you the word of god is manifested
[1:19:03] in what
[1:19:04] so brother brother doesn't say that that
[1:19:07] word when it comes
[1:19:08] it stop here brother branham said you
[1:19:11] catch it here
[1:19:12] then you need to drop it all the way
[1:19:14] down there
[1:19:16] are you following me thank god
[1:19:20] if you abide in me am i
[1:19:24] you see now you see now a bad
[1:19:28] in you then ask what you will and it

[1:19:32] for you then what does
[1:19:35] that do from the middle
[1:19:38] of the heart right here anybody clear
[1:19:42] which is the we already explained to you
[1:19:45] from there god's fault feeding what
[1:19:48] every channel brother branham is saying
[1:19:51] when we preach the word
[1:19:53] it comes and you grasp it
[1:19:56] if you lay it here it's not gonna do
[1:19:58] anything
[1:20:00] are you following me if that word drop
[1:20:03] down here
[1:20:05] this channel is another mission
[1:20:10] amen whatever you put in the soul
[1:20:14] he puts it up amen they soul
[1:20:17] doesn't reason like the brain
[1:20:21] the soul just take what you gave to him
[1:20:24] and he just gave it to you amen
[1:20:28] i gave you the top of the boat i don't
[1:20:31] know how many remember that
[1:20:33] brother branham said usually there were
[1:20:35] somebody on top of the boat
[1:20:37] they were looking over there he says but
[1:20:40] the
[1:20:41] the the pallet of the boat was laying
[1:20:44] down here somewhere
[1:20:46] so he is the one that have the steering
[1:20:48] wheel and brother branham say
[1:20:50] this man right here is the soul
[1:20:53] amen and the man on the top right here
[1:20:57] is the spirit your spirit amen
[1:21:00] so when this dark man here
[1:21:04] give direction the one ander
[1:21:07] doesn't see what is going on over there
[1:21:10] he just goes according to the orders
[1:21:15] that are coming from above if the man on
[1:21:18] top of the boat say
[1:21:19] to the right he just take his boat and
[1:21:22] he moved to the right
[1:21:24] amen if he said to the left he moved
[1:21:27] to the left are you with me so the man
[1:21:31] right here only take instruction to what
[1:21:34] you give him
[1:21:36] that's why brother problem say many
[1:21:38] people have
[1:21:39] intellectual mind of faith
[1:21:43] when you ask him you say do you believe
[1:21:45] yes
[1:21:46] he's believing here but this man doesn't
[1:21:49] believe
[1:21:50] this man is afraid he's gonna die so no
[1:21:53] matter what you tell this man
[1:21:56] you can tell him we pray for you yes do
[1:21:58] you believe yes
[1:21:59] but down here he's scared the boat is
[1:22:02] going to ship
[1:22:04] to where you are scared everybody here
[1:22:07] and when brother branham saw that in
[1:22:09] john ryan
[1:22:11] he understood that john ryan is a
[1:22:13] catholic
[1:22:14] and he need to get grasp to something
[1:22:17] brother branham said don't worry
[1:22:19] if he said not to mention there is a way
[1:22:22] to go
[1:22:22] over that automation amen it is the
[1:22:26] power of the widow woman
[1:22:28] just keep begging the judge back the
[1:22:31] judge go
[1:22:32] over and over and over and over until
[1:22:34] the judge get tired
[1:22:37] and the judge will say you know what let
[1:22:39] me take care of this widow
[1:22:41] then she won't come again and disturb me
[1:22:44] that's why brother branham told john
[1:22:46] ryan he said
[1:22:47] go ahead and begin to confess because
[1:22:50] with your
[1:22:51] mouth you confess right here
[1:22:54] everybody there that's your mouth but
[1:22:58] with your
[1:22:59] heart you believe are you there so when
[1:23:02] you start confessing praise the lord i'm
[1:23:04] here

[1:23:07] lord i'm healed
[1:23:08] praise the lord i'm here praise the lord
[1:23:11] i'm here
[1:23:12] automatically this person begin to get
[1:23:15] the message
[1:23:15] one two one two one two after one
[1:23:19] he wakes up he said oh okay you're
[1:23:20] talking about healing all okay let's go
[1:23:22] ahead and do the healing
[1:23:24] amen and that's the way the healing
[1:23:26] happened
[1:23:28] everybody clear so as long as this man
[1:23:31] doesn't get the message
[1:23:34] nothing is going to happen to you we can
[1:23:36] pray as we want it
[1:23:38] yes mommy understand what you're talking
[1:23:40] about no you have not
[1:23:41] understood yet once you understand
[1:23:44] if you drop in the heart that's say

[1:23:51] she looks beautiful and nothing happened
[1:23:53] you are right here
[1:23:55] amen but let this man
[1:23:58] strike amen once you see
[1:24:02] the young sister and you're trying to
[1:24:04] get married
[1:24:05] and once this man goes boom
[1:24:09] that's it they can bring twenty thousand
[1:24:12] sister you don't see none of them

[1:24:43] and they tell you in the morning do you
[1:24:45] know that we brought the fire and you
[1:24:46] did this you won't remember

[1:29:15] mother will see you in heaven she's
[1:29:16] gonna be happy
[1:29:18] then for the love of your mother
[1:29:21] not the love of god you're going to the
[1:29:24] altar
[1:29:25] you're not going to be born again
[1:29:32] a memory see you can't do that
[1:29:36] it's got to come down the line of water
[1:29:41] free moral urgency in other words we
[1:29:44] gotta bring the word
[1:29:46] straight to you and you have a right to
[1:29:49] either reject the word
[1:29:51] or accept it just like it is
[1:29:56] hallelujah you yourself
[1:29:59] let the word of god you don't come
[1:30:02] because your mother was a good woman
[1:30:04] you don't come because you are a good
[1:30:07] neighbor
[1:30:08] you come because that god caused you to
[1:30:12] come
[1:30:14] amen you cannot be saying that i did
[1:30:17] that because my mama wanted me
[1:30:20] to do that i went there because all the
[1:30:23] young people went there
[1:30:24] if i don't go there i'm gonna look bad
[1:30:27] don't come
[1:30:29] stay where you are
[1:30:32] we're trying to copy one another oh mom
[1:30:35] is there in church so i'm gonna act like
[1:30:37] a christian
[1:30:38] that's why you were there the way you
[1:30:40] are amen
[1:30:41] come because that god called you to come
[1:30:44] and accept him
[1:30:46] on the basis of what no feeling
[1:30:53] that word is what means what
[1:30:56] that's why paul would say we don't
[1:30:59] handle the word
[1:31:00] deceitfully amen you don't
[1:31:03] give the word by trying to
[1:31:07] please the people like if i said this
[1:31:10] they're gonna leave the church
[1:31:11] give it to them let them leave the
[1:31:14] church
[1:31:19] that word if you can get everything out
[1:31:22] of the way
[1:31:23] all conscious spirit all senses
[1:31:27] and just let the word coming that word
[1:31:30] will
[1:31:31] produce just what because the spoken
[1:31:34] word
[1:31:35] is the original
[1:31:40] everybody clear so far praise the name
[1:31:43] of the lord
[1:31:44] we continue death was not only
[1:31:48] the seed of a false vine but even in the
[1:31:52] true vine
[1:31:53] there was a creeping paralysis and
[1:31:56] impotence because they had already
[1:31:59] drifted
[1:32:00] from what an adulterated
[1:32:04] truth of the first few years after what
[1:32:08] and no true believer is any stronger
[1:32:13] and spiritually healthy and alive
[1:32:18] than his knowledge of and adherence to
[1:32:22] the what
[1:32:23] pure word
[1:32:28] praise the name of the lord
[1:32:31] amen in every age we have exactly the
[1:32:35] same pattern
[1:32:37] that is why the lord come through some
[1:32:39] god-given messenger
[1:32:40] in a certain area and then from that
[1:32:42] messenger
[1:32:44] there spread the light through the
[1:32:45] ministry of others who have been what
[1:32:48] faithfully taught but of course
[1:32:51] all those who go out with the message
[1:32:55] don't always learn how necessary
[1:32:59] it is to speak only what the messenger
[1:33:04] has what
[1:33:05] spoken don't change it
[1:33:09] the landing was not unto you
[1:33:13] right to the angel of ephesus the letter
[1:33:17] is to the angel to the messenger
[1:33:21] not you
[1:33:25] the messenger just take it and give it
[1:33:27] to you just read it the way he was given
[1:33:32] remember paul won the people to say only
[1:33:36] what he said
[1:33:37] first corinthians 14 37 if any man think
[1:33:40] himself to be a prophet
[1:33:42] or spiritual let him acknowledge that
[1:33:44] the things that are right unto you
[1:33:46] are the commandments of the lord what
[1:33:50] can the word of god add from you oh came
[1:33:52] it
[1:33:53] on to you only they add here
[1:33:56] you see now and take away there
[1:34:00] and soon the message is no longer what
[1:34:05] and the word so
[1:34:09] the the fire of revolver is connected
[1:34:13] on the purity of the message
[1:34:19] how careful we must be to hear
[1:34:24] one voice for the spirit has by water
[1:34:28] which is the period the bible says
[1:34:33] brother branham says amen god
[1:34:37] gave the reverend of elijah
[1:34:40] an instruction there was famine in the
[1:34:43] land
[1:34:44] everybody was starving and god gave the
[1:34:47] reverend the ability
[1:34:49] to take bread and to bring it to elijah
[1:34:53] there was famine in the land there was
[1:34:56] no rain
[1:34:57] but the raven respected the brethren
[1:35:02] are you following me it could be a
[1:35:04] temptation for that raven
[1:35:06] to take that bread and eat it
[1:35:10] amen but the raven took the bread
[1:35:13] just as he was given and delivered the
[1:35:16] bread to elijah
[1:35:17] without tempering with the bread
[1:35:22] are you following me david took a letter
[1:35:27] and wrote the death of uriah
[1:35:30] and gave it to uriah and uriah
[1:35:33] took the letter of his death
[1:35:36] but never tempted to open the letter
[1:35:39] but to deliver the lady where he was
[1:35:42] and he produced exactly what the letters
[1:35:46] say
[1:35:46] must come to pass
[1:35:51] if uriah would have opened the letter
[1:35:54] and said let me change the word
[1:35:56] what david intended for him would never
[1:35:59] happen
[1:36:00] amen david said kill uriah
[1:36:03] you pick up the letter deliver to job
[1:36:06] job look and they kill you
[1:36:10] amen he ordered the heaven
[1:36:15] his servant you see those raven
[1:36:18] bless them bird his servant that keep
[1:36:21] the voice of what
[1:36:24] elijah alive during the time of his
[1:36:27] isolation from the
[1:36:29] so as servant of god we must
[1:36:32] always strive to keep the word of god
[1:36:35] pure why because the birth of the
[1:36:38] children of god
[1:36:39] depend on the purity of the
[1:36:42] word of god brother branham say there is
[1:36:44] something about a child of god
[1:36:47] that went once that when you once
[1:36:50] are born into the spirit of god receive
[1:36:53] the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:36:55] there is something about the person that
[1:36:57] can cease the enemy
[1:36:59] you can take a man when he's taking the
[1:37:02] scripture
[1:37:03] and reading the scripture and try to
[1:37:05] what
[1:37:06] inject something to that scripture that
[1:37:09] is contrary to the scripture
[1:37:11] a man that is filled with death
[1:37:15] can says that right quick
[1:37:18] that's why you need the holy ghost amen
[1:37:21] there is something out of the way when
[1:37:24] he gets
[1:37:25] into a place that leads a certain sense
[1:37:27] in there
[1:37:28] that it's done to protect you
[1:37:31] you must not you must never
[1:37:35] go for anything unless it's exactly the
[1:37:40] word of god you must stay right exactly
[1:37:42] with that
[1:37:44] word and now and we are secure
[1:37:48] with that says as long as we are in the
[1:37:51] holy spirit everybody clear so far
[1:37:54] many times we subject it we substitute
[1:37:58] so much instead of the word especially
[1:38:01] today
[1:38:02] we are substituting phenomenals we are
[1:38:05] substituting
[1:38:06] a lot of other things that should not be
[1:38:09] after all
[1:38:10] church each folder you understand now
[1:38:14] the preaching of the word testimonies
[1:38:17] are fine
[1:38:18] and different things we do is wonderful
[1:38:21] but we must give the word
[1:38:24] first place you understand now
[1:38:29] because it is further number one
[1:38:32] come on and for the people that has
[1:38:36] their
[1:38:37] holy spirit also
[1:38:40] those that are born again and those that
[1:38:42] are not born again the holy spirit feeds
[1:38:45] on the
[1:38:46] word of god he takes the word
[1:38:50] and places it into your and it makes you
[1:38:54] grow
[1:38:54] in strength good baba exposit
[1:38:58] i love to sit and hear a good bible
[1:39:00] teacher
[1:39:01] who can take the bible and lays it out
[1:39:04] then the spirit of kindness
[1:39:06] in and meekness with it where it takes
[1:39:09] root
[1:39:09] in good soft ground and goes to what
[1:39:12] growing everybody clear so far okay
[1:39:16] now you are you said a while ago you
[1:39:19] were a christian
[1:39:20] what made you a christian because god
[1:39:23] called you
[1:39:24] before the foundation of the world to be
[1:39:26] christian
[1:39:27] and you become a christian then you get
[1:39:29] saved
[1:39:30] filled with the holy ghost you got
[1:39:32] eternal life
[1:39:33] why did he give you the holy ghost
[1:39:37] as a seal of your word
[1:39:40] you remember abraham believed god
[1:39:42] everybody clear
[1:39:44] you had faith what so once the word of
[1:39:47] god comes
[1:39:48] number one you must believe that word
[1:39:51] just the way it's given
[1:39:54] now if you say well you said a while ago
[1:39:57] about billy graham
[1:39:58] and them hollering well how many want to
[1:40:00] accept christ as personal server
[1:40:02] has you up your hand is that all right
[1:40:04] certainly that's all right
[1:40:06] that's good but that is just the
[1:40:08] beginning then if you
[1:40:10] really believe you see now
[1:40:14] and really have what
[1:40:17] you open the door anybody clear
[1:40:23] believe it and accepted it in your heart
[1:40:27] and now what you see the problem in the
[1:40:30] message
[1:40:33] can i read it loud believe it and really
[1:40:36] accepted
[1:40:37] it and taught right
[1:40:41] you thought wrong hinder the birth
[1:40:45] misplace the word hinder the birth
[1:40:50] then the holy spirit will come as a
[1:40:53] circumcision that he give abraham
[1:40:57] after his faith er confirmation that
[1:41:01] your faith is okay
[1:41:02] i put my seal on it then you are born
[1:41:05] again
[1:41:06] everybody clear
[1:41:09] if that is it what about this faith you
[1:41:12] talking about brother stephen
[1:41:15] hebrew 3 you remember last sunday but
[1:41:18] with whom was he grieved 40 years was he
[1:41:21] not with them that had seen
[1:41:23] whose carcass fell in the wilderness
[1:41:26] and to whom sure he that you should not
[1:41:29] enter
[1:41:30] into his head but to them that believe
[1:41:34] you see that you see that now
[1:41:39] so we see that they could not enter in
[1:41:43] because of what the word was preached to
[1:41:47] them
[1:41:47] and they never receive it they never
[1:41:50] believe it
[1:41:52] for unto us was the gospel preached
[1:41:56] as well as unto them israel but the word
[1:42:00] i'm here number one the word
[1:42:03] preached did not work he didn't help
[1:42:07] them
[1:42:08] why not being mixed with what
[1:42:11] they never moved from the first one to
[1:42:14] the second part
[1:42:15] that's why you are not born again not
[1:42:18] mixed with faith
[1:42:19] in them that did what because faith
[1:42:22] cometh by what
[1:42:24] hearing what their but you don't stop at
[1:42:27] their hearing you must believe it
[1:42:30] and accepted it hallelujah
[1:42:33] for we which have believed do enter into
[1:42:36] what
[1:42:37] paul is telling you that we which heard
[1:42:40] the word
[1:42:41] and believe it we enter into what
[1:42:44] which is the ceiling of the holy ghost
[1:42:46] everything clear
[1:42:49] first corinthians 10 but with many of
[1:42:52] them
[1:42:53] god was not what we're talking about the
[1:42:56] word please
[1:42:58] hallelujah
[1:43:02] i read it to you that you must be taught
[1:43:04] right
[1:43:05] so let's go slowly amen
[1:43:10] please he didn't please god
[1:43:15] right yes with many of them
[1:43:18] not few god was not well pleased
[1:43:22] for they were overthrown in the
[1:43:25] wilderness the same one
[1:43:27] that were overthrown there how do you
[1:43:29] please god
[1:43:34] take hebrew chapter 11
[1:43:42] hallelujah if you dare you can say amen
[1:43:49] it's impressive how time goes quicker
[1:43:54] hebrew chapter 11 if you dare you can
[1:43:57] say amen
[1:43:59] everybody there
[1:44:03] verse six everybody there
[1:44:07] but without what we back again
[1:44:10] on part two you see that
[1:44:14] you see this
[1:44:17] i imagine just letting the scripture
[1:44:19] speak to yourself
[1:44:22] but without faith it is what
[1:44:26] there is no way you can please god
[1:44:29] impossible
[1:44:32] i'm reading the bible without faith
[1:44:36] it is impossible to do what
[1:44:40] with many of them the lord was not what
[1:44:43] pleased to please god you must have what
[1:44:47] and with that faith it is
[1:44:49] impossible to please god that's why
[1:44:52] there is no holy ghost
[1:44:54] without faith it is impossible
[1:44:57] to please him for he that cometh to god
[1:45:01] must what
[1:45:03] believe that he is and that he is the
[1:45:07] what
[1:45:08] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:45:11] what
[1:45:12] so when you are approaching god you must
[1:45:15] believe him
[1:45:16] and not only do you believe him you must
[1:45:18] believe that he is able to give you
[1:45:20] for that which you gonna ask him are you
[1:45:23] following me
[1:45:26] brother stephen if to please god
[1:45:30] it takes faith how do i get faith
[1:45:37] you ready praise the name of the lord go
[1:45:40] to galatian 3.
[1:45:48] hallelujah
[1:45:54] let me go back there galatians 3.

[1:46:06] galatians 3 verse 2
[1:46:09] amen all right verse two

[1:46:16] paul

[1:46:21] the holy spirit the rest of the soul
[1:46:23] receive you the spirit by the works of
[1:46:27] the law
[1:46:28] what you are doing come on oh by what
[1:46:33] do you see that again do you see that

[1:46:38] everybody clear job to verse five
[1:46:41] he therefore the minister to you the
[1:46:44] spirit in other words he that provides

[1:46:54] the spirit and work miracle
[1:46:57] among you so the giving of the holy
[1:47:00] ghost

[1:47:09] diminished to you the spirit and work
[1:47:13] miracle among you does it
[1:47:16] by the works of the law or thereby the
[1:47:19] hearing of what

[1:47:24] comes from the hearing of faith
[1:47:28] everybody clear job to verse 8
[1:47:32] and the scripture forcing that god
[1:47:36] will justify the hidden through what

[1:47:59] that we might receive the what promise
[1:48:02] of the spirit through what the only
[1:48:06] channel the blockage to part three

[1:49:55] who is reaching mercy for his great love
[1:49:59] wherewith he loved us even when we were
[1:50:03] dead in sin has quickened us together
[1:50:07] with whom
[1:50:09] so when jesus christ died on the cross
[1:50:12] and jesus rose again you were already
[1:50:15] represented then
[1:50:17] all you need to do by birth is to
[1:50:20] join back your representation in christ
[1:50:27] your work is already finished that's why
[1:50:29] when they present salvation
[1:50:31] they tell you to accept the work of the
[1:50:34] cross
[1:50:34] because you are identified there
[1:50:38] even when we were dead in sin has
[1:50:41] quickened us together with christ
[1:50:44] by what grace are you
[1:50:47] saved and has raised us up together
[1:50:52] and made us sit together in heavenly
[1:50:54] places in christ
[1:50:55] jesus why that in the urges to come
[1:50:59] in the future he must show the exceeding
[1:51:03] riches of his grace
[1:51:05] and his kindness to others through
[1:51:07] christ jesus in the future he's going to
[1:51:09] show you how much
[1:51:11] of a great love that was verse 8
[1:51:14] for by grace are you saved through what

[1:51:49] that not of yourself
[1:51:54] that faith it is not your faith
[1:52:00] it is not a fifth that you manufacture

[1:52:04] it is manifest that you produce
[1:52:08] in other words from start to finish
[1:52:11] you have nothing to do
[1:52:18] all you have to do is surrender to god
[1:52:24] isn't this life easy we want to
[1:52:27] complicate it

[1:52:33] faith and that not of yourself

[1:52:54] money without price because it's already
[1:52:57] been
[1:52:58] paying calvary it is the gift of god

[1:53:03] believe
[1:53:06] amen lord help man believe
[1:53:09] do you believe lord remove that unbelief
[1:53:13] let god bring his own faith

[1:53:21] and automatically you are born again
[1:53:26] do you have something to do no put your
[1:53:29] car
[1:53:30] in your chair
[1:53:35] not of yourself it is the gift of god
[1:53:40] verse 9 not of what
[1:53:43] you don't work for it i'm going to
[1:53:45] believe i'm going to believe
[1:53:47] oh that's where the pentecostal miss it
[1:53:51] i begin to feel so fire fire fire fire
[1:53:53] fire fire fight they come out
[1:53:55] living like devils and then finally you
[1:53:58] get discouraged
[1:54:00] it's like i did everything they told me
[1:54:02] to do and it's still not working
[1:54:08] amen not of work verse 9
[1:54:12] lest any man should water god block it
[1:54:15] to himself
[1:54:17] so when you get to heaven nothing but
[1:54:19] amazing grace
[1:54:25] amen verse 10 for we are his what
[1:54:31] created in what to what
[1:54:35] you were already being ordained to bear
[1:54:38] fruit
[1:54:43] you are built built for that
[1:54:47] to good work which god has what
[1:54:50] before or them that we should do what
[1:54:54] so if you want to walk a christian life
[1:54:56] it's already been predestinated
[1:54:59] there is a program just receive
[1:55:02] the word of god the way he comes don't
[1:55:06] play game with the word if brother
[1:55:09] branham said this is wrong i'm just
[1:55:11] going to tell you exactly like brother
[1:55:13] brad i'm saying
[1:55:14] if i see a scripture i'm just going to
[1:55:16] give the scripture just
[1:55:18] like it is it might hurt you but it's
[1:55:21] gonna do you good
[1:55:23] because if we play with the prescription
[1:55:25] we have a trouble
[1:55:28] amen is it difficult to be born
[1:55:32] again take second timothy chapter one
[1:55:36] young people is it difficult to receive
[1:55:38] the holy ghost
[1:55:49] was paul praying for the holy ghost
[1:55:53] i'm just asking you when paul was going
[1:55:57] on the road to matthew to damascus was
[1:55:59] he saying that oh lord this is my time i
[1:56:02] feel the pool
[1:56:03] i need to get saved did paul do that
[1:56:06] he didn't even know they caught him off
[1:56:08] guard
[1:56:10] amen and he got there and and he became
[1:56:14] blind
[1:56:15] and he was praying to get his vision
[1:56:18] back
[1:56:19] and by getting his vision back he also
[1:56:22] give him the
[1:56:23] holy ghost because the one who give the
[1:56:26] spirit and work
[1:56:27] miracle give the spirit and work miracle
[1:56:31] by the hearing of faith
[1:56:35] and he told ananias he is a chosen
[1:56:38] vessel i already programmed him

[1:57:15] for the ungodly and for sinners for our
[1:57:18] holy
[1:57:19] and profane for murderers of fathers
[1:57:22] and murderers of mother for men slayer

[1:58:10] be not you therefore ashamed of the
[1:58:14] testimony of our lord
[1:58:16] know of me his prisoner that's paul
[1:58:19] but be you partaker of the affliction
[1:58:22] of the gospel according to the power of
[1:58:25] god
[1:58:26] watch verse 9 who has what
[1:58:30] and what with holy
[1:58:35] not according to our
[1:58:42] you see that not according to our
[1:58:45] work but according to his own
[1:58:49] purpose and grace which was giving us
[1:58:52] in what before the world what
[1:58:56] the whole program of your salvation
[1:59:00] from start to finish was already
[1:59:03] programmed
[1:59:07] you don't have to work for it nothing
[1:59:10] go to titus chapter 3
[1:59:14] titus chapter 3 verse 3.
[1:59:22] for we ourself if you dare you can say
[1:59:25] amen
[1:59:26] also we're sometime what foolish
[1:59:29] disobedient deceived serving diverse
[1:59:32] lust and pleasure
[1:59:34] living in malice and envy our first
[1:59:37] husband
[1:59:38] hateful and hating one another
[1:59:41] verse four but after that the kindness
[1:59:46] and love of god i will save you toward
[1:59:48] men did what
[1:59:51] it appeared to paul you clear now
[1:59:55] verse 5 we on tatters three first five
[1:59:59] not by what work of righteousness
[2:00:03] which we have there is nothing you have
[2:00:06] to do
[2:00:07] that's why brother branham said there is
[2:00:09] nothing you have to do to be saved
[2:00:12] amen not of work of righteousness which
[2:00:16] we have done
[2:00:17] but according to his mercy he did what
[2:00:20] served us by the washing of what
[2:00:25] and renewing off the world
[2:00:28] with that price without money
[2:00:33] let's head somewhere then we're going to
[2:00:35] stop
[2:00:36] once the holy ghost entered
[2:00:41] from the word of truth the gospel of
[2:00:43] your salvation
[2:00:44] you accept the word receive it
[2:00:48] accept it obey what the word say repent
[2:00:51] be baptized in the name of jesus christ
[2:00:53] go under the obedience of the word
[2:00:55] automatically
[2:00:57] he comes to you you are sealed with the
[2:00:59] holy spirit once the holy spirit seals
[2:01:01] you
[2:01:02] your first part of your job your
[2:01:04] redemption
[2:01:05] is finished because you are still until
[2:01:07] the day of your
[2:01:09] redemption that takes care of the enemy
[2:01:13] now when you get into that the second
[2:01:16] part is activated
[2:01:19] the first part was not a problem to you
[2:01:23] because you are a sinner
[2:01:25] on the inside you are black dark
[2:01:30] on the outside you are dark so
[2:01:33] everything you do
[2:01:34] is correct you're a sinner
[2:01:38] you drink you still you go home sleep
[2:01:40] wake up in the morning
[2:01:41] continue casting duels all kind of stuff
[2:01:44] amen
[2:01:45] so by the new birth you move
[2:01:48] from this stage which is sinner
[2:01:51] in a man sin assad sin
[2:01:55] you move into the second stage where the
[2:01:57] enemy
[2:01:58] now is right are you following me
[2:02:02] but the outside man is now
[2:02:06] still dark here
[2:02:09] nothing bothers you because he was your
[2:02:11] nature
[2:02:14] are you there the american was fine
[2:02:18] the devil was quiet because you were
[2:02:21] doing his work
[2:02:23] you were manifesting fruit unto death
[2:02:26] everything you were doing was a
[2:02:29] reflection of the kingdom of satan
[2:02:32] that's why satan was quiet keep drinking
[2:02:35] come still do whatever you do no problem
[2:02:38] but once you receive the word of god
[2:02:41] you believe into the gospel that is
[2:02:43] presented to you
[2:02:45] and you are born again that first nature
[2:02:48] the first husband died are you following
[2:02:52] me
[2:02:52] then you are married to the second
[2:02:54] husband as soon as you get married to
[2:02:57] the second husband
[2:02:59] this man is a different nature
[2:03:03] than this man war is declared
[2:03:07] amalek pool disorder
[2:03:11] makes sense now because we're going to
[2:03:13] deal with amalek
[2:03:14] in the book of esther are you following
[2:03:17] me
[2:03:18] now let's head home once watch that we
[2:03:21] talk to you about the engine chief
[2:03:24] since he got served received the holy
[2:03:27] spirit
[2:03:28] they asked him to say chief what's going
[2:03:30] on he said pretty good pretty bad
[2:03:32] what's going on there is a fight why
[2:03:34] there is two dogs
[2:03:35] we have a white dog and the dark dog the
[2:03:38] white dog is right here on the inside
[2:03:40] the black dog is still up there over
[2:03:42] here you have black dog
[2:03:44] black dog they all get along together
[2:03:48] on the east on the second stage you kick
[2:03:51] the inside black dog out
[2:03:53] and you put the white dog in then the
[2:03:56] two nature begin to fight
[2:04:01] i thought rest
[2:04:05] means no war
[2:04:08] it seems like i got in rest now i'm in
[2:04:11] trouble
[2:04:13] a paradox amen
[2:04:16] let me hit something here and then we go
[2:04:18] home
[2:04:19] go to uh roman chapter seven
[2:04:25] where is it yeah few minutes and i'm
[2:04:28] going to stop and we pick up on sunday
[2:04:32] if you dare you can say amen romans 7
[2:04:37] verse 15
[2:04:42] this is paul filled with the holy spirit
[2:04:45] job to verse 18 to save time
[2:04:48] for i know that in me that is in ma
[2:04:53] you see right here you see everybody
[2:04:56] clear now
[2:04:59] that is in my flesh dua no good thing
[2:05:04] he already started from your birth here
[2:05:07] no good thing
[2:05:08] no good thing any flesh
[2:05:12] for to will is present with me
[2:05:16] the good will is now on the inside it's
[2:05:18] present with me
[2:05:20] but how to perform that which is good i
[2:05:24] found not
[2:05:25] in other words paul is talking about
[2:05:28] the state of a restful christian
[2:05:32] he said i paul i'm born of the holy
[2:05:35] ghost
[2:05:36] i met christ i had experience they
[2:05:38] prayed for me
[2:05:39] i received the holy spirit but since i
[2:05:42] got the holy spirit like the
[2:05:44] indian chief i found myself in trouble
[2:05:47] amen now when i checked myself i found
[2:05:51] out
[2:05:51] that in me within the same framework of
[2:05:55] the church brother greg
[2:05:57] there's two spirits that are fighting
[2:06:00] amen
[2:06:01] on the inside i am trying to live for
[2:06:04] god
[2:06:05] but sometimes i feel like i need to bite
[2:06:08] his finger
[2:06:11] amen jump to verse 19
[2:06:15] for the good that i would i do not
[2:06:18] but the evil which i would not that i do
[2:06:22] now if i do that i would not
[2:06:26] it is no more i that do it but sin that
[2:06:29] dwells in what
[2:06:31] that sin is not in the soul of paul
[2:06:36] you got to say now don't say that i'm a
[2:06:38] christian i can sin
[2:06:39] no that sin is on the outside man
[2:06:44] amen job to verse uh
[2:06:48] job to verse 21 i found them a law
[2:06:51] that when i will do good evil is what
[2:06:55] you are going with that amalekite all
[2:06:57] the time
[2:06:59] you sleep with him you wake up with him
[2:07:01] we gotta see how we gonna destroy him
[2:07:05] amen amen
[2:07:08] verse 22 for a delight in the law of god
[2:07:11] after
[2:07:12] the word because the inner man have the
[2:07:14] holy ghost the holy ghost feeds on the
[2:07:17] word you see now let's go down to verse
[2:07:22] 23 but i see another law in my members
[2:07:27] that is doing what now america to begin
[2:07:30] his war
[2:07:32] you see now after you have drunk from
[2:07:34] the water of
[2:07:35] rephidim that's when amalek attacked you
[2:07:39] amen praise god now
[2:07:42] warring against the law of my mind
[2:07:45] and bringing me into what captivity to
[2:07:48] the law of sin which is in my
[2:07:51] in other words the sin that is in the
[2:07:53] body is trying to
[2:07:54] pull you back to the old life amen
[2:07:59] and then the new nature is trying to
[2:08:01] pull you back
[2:08:02] to be transformed into the image of god
[2:08:09] watch verse 24 oh what
[2:08:13] that time who shall what
[2:08:17] for the what now paul which were david
[2:08:21] walls
[2:08:22] paul begin to cry for the redemption
[2:08:26] of the body you see now
[2:08:30] paul said who can deliver me not from
[2:08:33] the inside man
[2:08:34] but from this my soul thirst
[2:08:37] after the living god my soul already
[2:08:40] satisfied
[2:08:41] resting now i got in trouble paul
[2:08:44] begin to groan like david now my body
[2:08:48] also lord
[2:08:49] is wretched everybody clear
[2:08:53] watch verse 8 chapter 8
[2:08:56] verse 1 and we stop here there is
[2:08:59] therefore what
[2:09:01] call is telling you when you get that
[2:09:04] stage
[2:09:04] don't be condemning yourself don't be
[2:09:07] like uh
[2:09:08] since i'm a christian don't do that
[2:09:12] don't do that there is a way we're going
[2:09:14] to teach you now how to leave from there
[2:09:16] on amen
[2:09:18] because once the american comes you need
[2:09:22] to call joshua
[2:09:24] you don't do the fighting
[2:09:28] hallelujah you get into all but it's not
[2:09:32] your world it is the war of the white
[2:09:34] dogger
[2:09:37] just give the place to the white dog
[2:09:40] and let him handle the black dog all
[2:09:44] that you do
[2:09:45] continue to give the white dog more food
[2:09:50] the more food you give him the more he's
[2:09:53] slain
[2:09:58] verse 1 there is therefore now no
[2:10:01] condemnation to them which are in what
[2:10:05] who walk not after the but after the
[2:10:10] for the love the spirit of life in
[2:10:12] christ
[2:10:13] has made me free from the law of what if
[2:10:16] you
[2:10:16] found yourself under this pressure in
[2:10:19] life
[2:10:20] it's not a state of condemnation
[2:10:23] because on the inner man you are trying
[2:10:26] the best that you can
[2:10:28] to live for christ that's why he's an
[2:10:31] advocate
[2:10:32] so when you do something wrong just
[2:10:34] repent
[2:10:35] and go back in line and live joyfully
[2:10:38] don't repent and then you go down like
[2:10:40] this because
[2:10:41] once you repent he takes her put it on
[2:10:44] the sea of god forgetfulness
[2:10:46] even though you remember he doesn't
[2:10:48] remember
[2:10:50] you can remember all you want god does
[2:10:52] not remember
[2:10:53] therefore you are free from what
[2:10:56] condemnation
[2:10:58] it is not a life that puts you in
[2:11:01] sadness
[2:11:02] it is a joyful life because your faith
[2:11:06] rests death on christ let's stand
[2:11:19] [Music]
[2:11:22] if it's a life of condemnation why do we
[2:11:24] why are we christian
[2:11:27] because we're living more uh in
[2:11:30] wilderness
[2:11:31] and sadness than what we wear it seems
[2:11:33] like when we were in a nightclub we had
[2:11:36] fun
[2:11:37] and when you become a christian it
[2:11:39] becomes a problem
[2:11:41] like there is no fun no there is a true
[2:11:44] fan
[2:11:45] in christianity in a nightclub there was
[2:11:47] a perversion
[2:11:48] because when you were going home you are
[2:11:51] regretting on the life that you are
[2:11:53] living
[2:11:54] but you don't regret if you are born
[2:11:57] again
[2:11:59] amen the one who's born again is
[2:12:02] groaning
[2:12:03] that paul said we in this body we grown
[2:12:07] why are you groaning because you are
[2:12:09] pulling god
[2:12:10] to bring the second redemption amen
[2:12:14] so once you get the second redemption
[2:12:17] the devil
[2:12:18] will not have anything to do with you
[2:12:21] anymore
[2:12:22] the second redemption takes away sin
[2:12:25] all your sickness all your trouble all
[2:12:28] your heartache
[2:12:29] all your white hair
[2:12:34] forever to be younger
[2:12:38] we urging because of death and the devil
[2:12:41] bagged just that it's like a cocker bird
[2:12:44] the devil just heaven
[2:12:46] as you move out
[2:12:50] amen let's pray heavenly father

[2:13:01] around the lord these things father you
[2:13:04] prophet studied
[2:13:05] spoke that these things must be taught
[2:13:08] right
[2:13:09] lord all that we are doing is presenting
[2:13:12] the word
[2:13:13] as pure as we can to the best of our
[2:13:15] ability
[2:13:16] so that the holy spirit himself in your

[2:13:23] will quicken them
[2:13:25] father we thank you for unfolding these
[2:13:27] things to us
[2:13:28] where christianity is not a work
[2:13:31] it's not a labor it's not a forceful
[2:13:35] work that we have to do
[2:13:37] to please you lord but the only thing
[2:13:40] that we have to do in this life is just
[2:13:43] to put ourselves
[2:13:44] in the hand of the living god and
[2:13:46] surrender our life
[2:13:48] surrender our right surrender our
[2:13:51] ability

[2:13:57] authority
[2:13:58] to do that which you have predestinated

[2:14:04] life is a good cleanse lord

[2:14:10] the plans of destruction

[2:14:14] were born
[2:14:15] from the many different ways that we
[2:14:18] grew up in our life
[2:14:20] and where we are today lord we can truly
[2:14:23] testify
[2:14:24] that for sure the hand of the lord is in
[2:14:26] my life
[2:14:27] i can see from where i started where i
[2:14:30] am
[2:14:30] i am not the same man i was i am not the
[2:14:34] man i wanted to be
[2:14:35] but for sure i'm going somewhere lord
[2:14:38] father
[2:14:39] may you give a revelation to your
[2:14:41] children lord
[2:14:42] about this walk lord because the time is
[2:14:44] gone
[2:14:45] we are in the long suffering time lord
[2:14:48] and sooner
[2:14:48] you're gonna close the door lord father
[2:14:51] of mercy
[2:14:52] and you will turn to the jewish people

[2:14:56] may the holy spirit continue to minister
[2:14:59] to your children lord
[2:15:00] father take a full preeminence in the
[2:15:02] life of your children
[2:15:03] you spoke to us tonight lord that that
[2:15:06] faith
[2:15:07] is not something that we work for but
[2:15:09] it's a gift of god
[2:15:11] and those that have not lord father god
[2:15:14] oh lord met that gift may you be
[2:15:16] merciful to them lord tonight
[2:15:18] to give them the gift lord the gift of
[2:15:21] faith so that you yourself
[2:15:23] in your life lord o father can believe
[2:15:26] your own word
[2:15:27] and we can come up to the same testimony
[2:15:30] like the apostle paul
[2:15:31] who says that the life that i live now i
[2:15:34] live
[2:15:34] it by the faith of the son of god father
[2:15:37] may you grant it to your children lord
[2:15:39] to the young people to those that are
[2:15:41] old that have not

[2:15:56] someone else has begun to take over my
[2:15:58] life that's the time when
[2:16:00] somebody else is living their life
[2:16:02] that's the time that i change
[2:16:04] that i'm not even having the desire
