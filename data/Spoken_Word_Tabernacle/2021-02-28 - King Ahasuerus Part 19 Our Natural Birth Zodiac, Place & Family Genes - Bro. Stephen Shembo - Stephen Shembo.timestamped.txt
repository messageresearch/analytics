[54:27] the church which is the Garner of God
[54:30] God has said You shall not eat of
[54:33] it this is not an
[54:36] apple neither shall you touch it this is
[54:40] not an apple because Paul say in 1
[54:42] Corinthians 7 it is not good for a man
[54:45] to touch a woman that is not this
[54:51] amen lest you die and the serpent said
[54:55] to the woman you shall not surely
[54:59] die for God know that in the day eat you
[55:02] eat thereof then your eyes shall be open
[55:07] so the eyes of Adam and Eve you might be
[55:09] seated were
[55:12] sealed
[55:14] amen go back to the 25th verse on
[55:17] chapter 2 so it makes sense for
[55:21] you chapter 2 verse 25th I just want you
[55:24] pick up that then we get it and they
[55:26] were both what naked the man and his
[55:30] wife and were not what asham there was
[55:33] an innocence that blinded them amen but
[55:38] the one who came to Open the Eyes is not
[55:42] God it's the black
[55:45] dog amen praise the name of the Lord now
[55:48] let's go back where we were for God see
[55:51] for God knows verse five that in the day
[55:54] you eat thereof then your eyes shall be
[55:58] open why do you want to open their eyes
[56:01] God blinded them God put a holy Veil on
[56:05] them now you want to Blind
[56:07] them you want to open their eyes why
[56:11] amen the only way you can come back to
[56:14] this state temporarily on this in this
[56:17] world you must be lawfully
[56:20] married remember the quote last week
[56:23] brother random say you can be married 50
[56:25] years and when God look at you he sees
[56:27] you like you never like you
[56:31] virgins amen if you get in into marriage
[56:35] correctly automatically you back again
[56:38] temporarily in a minor way you back
[56:41] again into Eden amen that's why you and
[56:45] your wife you can talk together and
[56:48] there is
[56:50] nothing amen but don't open your eyes
[56:54] with
[56:54] adultery right that's the black
[56:57] dog amen praise the name of the praise
[57:01] the name of the Lord and when the woman
[57:03] saw it's a perception that the tree was
[57:07] good for food and that it was pleasant
[57:10] to the eyes the last of the flesh the
[57:12] last of the eyes and a tree to be desire
[57:15] to make one wise she took off the fruit
[57:19] thereof and did eat and gave also to her
[57:23] husband with her and he did
[57:27] eight verse 7 and The Eyes of both of
[57:30] them were what open who opened the
[57:36] eyes
[57:38] amen praise the name of the Lord and
[57:41] they knew that they were naked and they
[57:44] saw fig leaves together and made them
[57:48] themselves apron amen when they were
[57:51] under the state of innocency nobody car
[57:55] about the clothing
[57:57] amen amen but when the eyes were open
[58:02] then he opened the door to how you
[58:04] should dress because in the Book of
[58:07] Ezekiel when God saw that woman being a
[58:11] baby God never worry about clothing her
[58:15] until she reached puberty then God begin
[58:18] to be very careful about the way that
[58:21] woman was
[58:23] dressed amen praise praise the name of
[58:26] the Lord hallelujah and they saw fig
[58:30] leaves which is religion a covering
[58:33] together and made thems what apron they
[58:37] want to find a temporary solution jum to
[58:40] verse 10 and he said I heard your voice
[58:44] in the garden this is Adam replying to
[58:46] God and I was afraid for the first time
[58:50] because I was naked and I hid myself and
[58:54] the first time she could he could talk
[58:56] to God and nothing happened don't even
[58:58] realize until the devil open his eyes
[59:03] amen let's go to verse
[59:07] 21 to Adam also and to his wife did the
[59:13] Lord God make coats of skin so a beast
[59:17] was killed there the first priest in the
[59:20] Bible was God himself amen killing the
[59:25] lamb you say where did he say the lamb
[59:27] where did he say the lamb brother Ram
[59:29] say the lamb where is that lamb I have a
[59:31] scripture for it and I'm going to give
[59:34] it to
[59:34] you amen and Adam call uh verse 21 to
[59:39] Adam also and to his wife did the Lord
[59:42] Co did the Lord God make coats of skin
[59:45] and did what and cloth them so once the
[59:48] Eyes Are Open by a sexual act God is
[59:53] coming straight to clothe the children
[59:56] once that woman in Ezekiel reach puberty
[59:59] amen then the Lord come and begin to
[1:00:02] take care of the outer appearance so
[1:00:04] there is something to do with the way we
[1:00:07] dress amen let's go to the Book of Ruth
[1:00:11] chapter
[1:00:14] 3 I hope I'm going to get to that
[1:00:17] because your slide is pretty
[1:00:22] loaded Ru chapter 3 verse eight to
[1:00:27] overcome you must recognize the devil in
[1:00:30] his tactics the devil play when you
[1:00:33] ignorant when you don't know the devil
[1:00:36] will play play play play I have four
[1:00:41] people that had the same condition and
[1:00:44] one asked me a question and he didn't
[1:00:46] even ask me a question about the
[1:00:48] situation he just ask me a question that
[1:00:52] I'm going to paraphrase like how can I
[1:00:54] get focused to meditate
[1:00:57] amen then I just took some
[1:01:00] quotes and I say I asked a question I
[1:01:03] say do you have this this in your life
[1:01:05] say yes I took maybe six or something
[1:01:08] seven quotes and
[1:01:10] ascended and the person replied that
[1:01:13] that's exactly what is going
[1:01:15] on and the Lord put somebody else in my
[1:01:18] heart and I took some of the quote I
[1:01:21] said and the person say that is exactly
[1:01:23] my
[1:01:24] life amen
[1:01:27] amen and brother brandham even gave a
[1:01:29] solution how to overcome that amen and
[1:01:33] then I was talking to her
[1:01:35] sister and she mentioned she said my
[1:01:38] sister is suffering with this this this
[1:01:40] this I say is she having this problem
[1:01:43] this problem she said yes I say I'm
[1:01:45] going to send you six or seven quotes
[1:01:48] you read it and you tell me they read
[1:01:51] the same quote came back again one was
[1:01:54] almost crying say thought I had heart
[1:01:57] condition it was not the heart it was
[1:02:00] something else and brother Bram describe
[1:02:02] everything and give even the solution
[1:02:05] amen and this was going on for years in
[1:02:08] their life they thought they have blood
[1:02:10] pressure and heart condition but it was
[1:02:12] not that it was something else so you
[1:02:15] must know the devil will play with you
[1:02:18] with ignorance Ruth chapter
[1:02:20] 3 four of them and I believe if I open
[1:02:24] that up I might find more
[1:02:27] it's a spirit a demon of anxiety and
[1:02:33] nervousness it will make you think you
[1:02:35] have hard
[1:02:37] situation and it's going to affect your
[1:02:39] belly and you will have constipation and
[1:02:42] all kind of stuff I will give you quotes
[1:02:44] rather I'm explaining
[1:02:47] that and you think something is wrong
[1:02:49] something is wrong something is wrong
[1:02:51] it's just an anxiety demon and usually
[1:02:53] comes in the evening
[1:02:56] and make you
[1:02:59] weary let me go back to Ru chapter
[1:03:03] 3 Hallelujah don't worry we're going to
[1:03:07] dig that devil
[1:03:09] [Music]
[1:03:10] out Ru 3:8 I didn't even pray for none
[1:03:16] of them they begin to claim their
[1:03:19] healing amen say I accept the healing
[1:03:22] the Lord Heal Me I took more scripture
[1:03:25] and I loaded them I say get the
[1:03:28] scripture because I know how the devil
[1:03:30] will come back to fight their mind I
[1:03:32] loaded them with more scripture I say
[1:03:34] come back
[1:03:35] again I didn't pray for any of them four
[1:03:38] of them
[1:03:40] nobody you shall know the truth and the
[1:03:43] truth shall do
[1:03:47] what without prayer just he
[1:03:52] come
[1:03:54] easy roof chapter
[1:03:57] 3:8 and it came to pass at what and
[1:04:00] midnight that is the time the Midnight
[1:04:02] Cry of Matthew 25 the foolish virgin at
[1:04:08] midnight that the man was afraid this is
[1:04:11] boas and turned himself and behold a
[1:04:14] woman lay at his
[1:04:16] feet and he said who are you and she
[1:04:20] answered I am rof your
[1:04:22] handsman spread Therefore your skirt
[1:04:25] over me
[1:04:26] why is this woman asking for a skirt to
[1:04:28] be spread over her she's asking for
[1:04:30] something for Redemption you're going to
[1:04:32] see that in Ezekiel chapter
[1:04:35] 16 spread Therefore your skirt over your
[1:04:38] handmaid for you are a near what Kinsman
[1:04:42] she's asking Redemption but that
[1:04:45] Redemption comes with a
[1:04:49] marriage amen Redeem Me by marrying me
[1:04:57] amen let's go to Second Timothy chapter
[1:05:01] 1
[1:05:03] Hallelujah before you get
[1:05:06] married
[1:05:08] naturally you must be married to
[1:05:10] somebody
[1:05:14] first if you are not married to that
[1:05:17] person don't engage into marriage I'm
[1:05:21] going to prove to you
[1:05:26] so our normal marriage should be our
[1:05:31] second Hallelujah second Timothy chapter
[1:05:35] 1 if you dare you can say
[1:05:38] Amen my goodness don't know why time has
[1:05:42] been my enemy one of this day is going
[1:05:45] to be swallowed up in
[1:05:47] eternity second Timothy chapter 1 verse
[1:05:50] 5 if you dare you can say Amen this is
[1:05:54] Paul talking to Timothy
[1:05:56] he said when I call to
[1:05:58] remembrance the unan the sincere the
[1:06:01] genuine the unan faith that is in you so
[1:06:07] when Paul look at Timothy he found out
[1:06:10] that Timothy has a gift of
[1:06:17] faith
[1:06:19] amen but Paul is a
[1:06:23] spiritual man that knows had to study
[1:06:29] genetics
[1:06:31] amen everybody was talking about Abraham
[1:06:34] MC Abraham madc when Paul came he looked
[1:06:38] he said uhuh in the ls of Abraham L was
[1:06:43] there nobody saw it only
[1:06:47] Paul amen he could trace a gen and go
[1:06:50] this way and catch it when I called to
[1:06:54] remembrance the unan faith that is in
[1:06:56] you Timothy which DW dwell first in your
[1:07:01] what grandmother
[1:07:04] lo How can Paul Trace
[1:07:07] that Lo have a faith amen and lo is a
[1:07:15] woman she's not a man but Paul when he
[1:07:19] look at Timothy he said the gift that
[1:07:22] you have came from your grandmother
[1:07:27] yes I'm just reading the
[1:07:30] Bible dwell first in your grandm Louis
[1:07:36] and your mother who
[1:07:39] Unice so Louis give it to
[1:07:44] Eunice and Eunice hand it to
[1:07:49] Timothy
[1:07:51] jeans are you there and your mother un
[1:07:56] and I am persuaded that in you also so
[1:08:00] Paul is showing here that there is
[1:08:03] certain things in the life of Louis the
[1:08:07] grandmother that by lineage were
[1:08:10] transfer or handed down all the way to
[1:08:15] Timothy amen and Timothy ending up
[1:08:18] having this gift plus the ministry that
[1:08:21] he had but we can trace it on the mother
[1:08:25] side
[1:08:27] and Paul when he spoke about MEC he
[1:08:30] Trace liver on the father
[1:08:36] side Paul with melchisedek he traced
[1:08:40] liver on the father's
[1:08:44] side so you get stuff from
[1:08:47] Mama and you get Stu from Papa and What
[1:08:51] Mama Gave You Came from somebody else
[1:08:55] and what does somebody else gave
[1:08:57] somebody else came from somebody else
[1:09:00] and you cut into a
[1:09:02] trouble and you don't understand if it's
[1:09:05] something good like Timothy praise God
[1:09:09] but most of the time it's trouble they
[1:09:13] just hand it down and you got to deal
[1:09:15] with it open Ezekiel chapter 16 then we
[1:09:19] going to pray these Sharpies are th
[1:09:26] hope this is going to
[1:09:27] help we need one with a fat
[1:09:32] tip probably this will

[2:38:52] what all the old stuff are what the
[2:38:57] black dog because Joshua have entered
[2:39:00] and he's neutralizing the black dog and
[2:39:03] pushing you toward Redemption that's
[2:39:05] right hallelujah hallelujah and the
[2:39:10] father raised up brother bam is

[2:39:21] Jesus Christ and what the Baptist mean
[2:39:23] the PO say I know my son has come to
[2:39:26] Christ he's arguing with the prophet I
[2:39:30] say that may be all right all the
[2:39:33] outward motions he might be identified
[2:39:36] as a Believer with the believer that's
[2:39:39] why you seen young people running the
[2:39:41] altar do stuff pray pray pray pray
[2:39:43] tomorrow they go a w again and they sit
[2:39:46] like I thought I pray they told me to do
[2:39:48] whatever thing I did but why am I still
[2:39:51] like this are you there but until he's
[2:39:56] what born again I shall advise the young
[2:40:00] men to never what marry a woman you
[2:40:04] cannot get married until you first
[2:40:07] married with
[2:40:09] Christ when you are married with Christ
[2:40:12] as the son of righteousness when he come
[2:40:15] through your life he conquers your birth
[2:40:18] he conquer your origin he conquer your
[2:40:22] birthplace and he make you
[2:40:25] suitable not to be a hell to
[2:40:27] somebody are you there but many enter
[2:40:31] into the marriage with that's why you
[2:40:33] fought 15 years you felt like I need to
[2:40:36] come out of

[2:40:40] daddy who told you he was your
[2:40:43] daddy he's not like my mom who told you
[2:40:46] that is your mama
[2:40:49] are you there that may be all right but
[2:40:53] until he's regenerated Born Again advise
[2:40:57] that young man to never marry a woman he
[2:41:00] shall make Heaven on Earth for
[2:41:07] her you see how you play games and

[2:43:28] another except be with what you must

[2:43:42] forever you are not a none if you a none

[2:43:54] I'm not going to play games I'm going to
[2:43:55] tell you queer you didn't get in the
[2:43:58] marriage to be a
[2:44:05] nun
[2:44:07] H
[2:44:10] that a quote is coming up in my mind I
[2:44:13] can give you a quote where brother BR
[2:44:14] I'm saying that if a woman says that
[2:44:18] marriage is not something something like
[2:44:20] this ask me I'm going to send you the
[2:44:25] quote Hallelujah def fraud we play too
[2:44:30] much with the devil in this marriage in
[2:44:32] this message def fraud not one another
[2:44:36] except it be with a consent with consent
[2:44:39] for a time that you may give yourself to
[2:44:42] what and what and come together again
[2:44:47] that's what
[2:44:49] tempt you not for
[2:44:52] what so the black dog have a right to
[2:44:56] tempt you if you start playing around
[2:44:58] with
[2:45:03] this do you hear me that's why the Bible
[2:45:07] say not
[2:45:09] divorce amen because you're going to
[2:45:12] make her
[2:45:14] commit because you open a door that the
[2:45:18] black dog will be fighting there amen
[2:45:22] amen amen amen amen amen come back again
[2:45:27] because what Satan when you go longer
[2:45:30] the black dog is
[2:45:32] coming amen because of lack of
[2:45:36] self-control by getting into marriage
[2:45:38] you open a door and you must be clo you
[2:45:41] must know how to close that door you
[2:45:43] don't learn it you're going to be in
[2:45:45] trouble
[2:45:49] I'm going to drop
[2:45:51] this I'm going to drop
[2:45:54] this that's why when your spouse is
[2:45:58] sick you need to pray
[2:46:04] hard are you there yes sir are you there
[2:46:08] when you hear somebody's husband is sick
[2:46:10] you need to pray for them when you hear
[2:46:13] somebody's wife is sick you need to pray
[2:46:15] for them they've been sick for two month
[2:46:18] 3 months you need to pray because a
[2:46:20] sister or a brother might be under
[2:46:23] attack of the black
[2:46:26] dog and you are sitting you don't
[2:46:29] understand this thing and the brother is
[2:46:31] under attack the sister is under attack
[2:46:33] because they are block they can't go
[2:46:35] nowhere the black dog is right
[2:46:41] there your wife is sick you shouldn't be
[2:46:44] praying your husband is sick you should
[2:46:46] not be playing
[2:46:51] Hallelujah he said gentle he shall make
[2:46:54] hell on Earth for her until that gentle
[2:46:57] sweet forgiven Spirit of Christ comes in
[2:47:01] then there will be a what a paradox in
[2:47:03] itself to take the very nature of a boy
[2:47:07] that is breathed between father and
[2:47:09] mother and yet in his intellectual he's
[2:47:13] trying what his best to do what he can
[2:47:17] do it he shall never overcome that's why
[2:47:22] Young Folks you can do all you want to
[2:47:24] do you w overcome
[2:47:28] it are you there you try to be Christian
[2:47:31] you try to be Christian suddenly you
[2:47:32] flip you do something and then you come
[2:47:34] back again I'm I want to put my life in
[2:47:37] order you get out you get out you will
[2:47:39] never you are trying intellectually to
[2:47:42] overcome the black
[2:47:45] dog are you there Christ will have to do
[2:47:50] what not
[2:47:52] you that's why he comes at puberty and
[2:47:55] he say I'm here let me hander this for
[2:47:59] you and I'm going to make your life
[2:48:02] easy are you there when when he lets
[2:48:05] chust in then he's
[2:48:08] what as soon as God get in your life the
[2:48:12] black dog react
[2:48:16] hallu are you there then he's already
[2:48:19] overcome then it shall be a what a
