[46:11] Ephesians chapter
[46:13] 4 uh let's read the 10th 11th and 12th
[46:16] verses and you could be seated I'm going
[46:19] to uh just be reading Ephesians 4 10 11
[46:23] and 12 and then we'll go from there and
[46:25] he that descended is the the same
[46:27] also that ascended far above all the
[46:32] heavens that he might
[46:34] feel all things yes sir and he gave some
[46:39] Apostles and some prophets and some
[46:42] evangelists and some pastors and
[46:44] teachers for the perfecting of the
[46:47] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[46:50] the edifying of the body of Christ let's
[46:55] bow our hearts Heavenly Father we thank
[46:56] you tonight Lord we ask you father for
[47:00] your grace upon this meeting tonight
[47:02] that you would come Lord and that you
[47:04] would bless it God with your presence
[47:07] Lord we know we stand here tonight we
[47:09] stand under the opice of the very
[47:11] command of almighty God in the written
[47:14] word and commission that you have placed
[47:16] upon Our Lives to preach your word we
[47:19] ask you now that you would come by this
[47:21] way this evening Lord and that you would
[47:23] Minister to the specific needs of this
[47:26] church Lord and now as we commit this
[47:28] into thy faithful hands we pray in the
[47:31] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and
[47:34] amen and God bless you as you could be
[47:36] seated tonight I just want to speak to
[47:38] you if I can I'd like to talk to you
[47:40] about the ministry of the New Covenant
[47:43] yes sir the ministry of the New Covenant
[47:46] now when you're reading here in the book
[47:48] of Ephesians uh of course this is the uh
[47:51] this is the New Testament book of Joshua
[47:53] it's a powerful book and in this book
[47:56] there's a a lot of uh things that Paul
[47:58] is doing that is positioning and
[48:00] actually the next chapter Paul gets into
[48:03] Ephesians 5 he starts talking about
[48:04] marriage which is pretty pretty new to
[48:07] the gentile people amen but he's
[48:09] bringing unto them new things and he's
[48:12] positioning him into things they don't
[48:14] understand and and and one great thing
[48:17] they're not going to understand is
[48:18] they're not going to understand God's uh
[48:20] a dispensing of his authority and of his
[48:23] word through human beings this is this
[48:25] is going to be new to the gentile people
[48:28] altoe amen maybe Israel had heard some
[48:31] things but even Israel was going to be
[48:33] receiving some different uh different
[48:35] instructions on God's way and how he was
[48:38] going to do things but if you if you're
[48:40] reading Ephesians 4 you can kind of back
[48:42] up above it and you can see a little bit
[48:44] how he begins by saying that we're
[48:46] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[48:48] peace and and that there is one body and
[48:50] there is one Spirit even as you're
[48:52] called into the hope of one calling and
[48:54] there is one Lord there is one Faith
[48:57] there is one baptism see there's only
[48:59] one God and the father of us all above
[49:02] us all and through us all and in you all
[49:04] now now now Paul is saying something
[49:07] powerful by saying that there is only
[49:09] one Lord there is one faith and there is
[49:11] one baptism right amen now the prophet
[49:14] teaches us very clearly there's only one
[49:16] Lord amen and there's only one faith and
[49:19] people talk all the time so well my
[49:21] faith brother B said you know it's not
[49:23] your faith it's the faith amen that
[49:25] there is a the faith and that Fe faith
[49:28] is the faith of Jesus Christ that's what
[49:31] Jude was contending for not too long
[49:34] after the death of Christ Jude was
[49:36] talking about the faith and that's what
[49:38] Janis and jambers in the end time what
[49:40] they resist is the faith that's and
[49:43] there is only one one Lord one faith and
[49:46] one baptism so we look tonight at well
[49:48] there's two baptisms but actually there
[49:50] just one baptism there's a baptism of
[49:53] spirit amen and that's the prophet said
[49:55] that by one spirit
[49:57] baptized into one body but it's water
[50:00] baptism is only an outward expression to
[50:02] put you in the Fellowship of the church
[50:05] sir but the spirit baptism amen is the
[50:07] baptism Paul is talking about because
[50:10] he's talking about bringing you into the
[50:12] spirit isn't that powerful amen that
[50:14] here's a man bringing the gentile people
[50:18] he's bringing the race of of of people
[50:21] under abrahamic Covenant and listen let
[50:23] me say this very clearly as a natural
[50:25] man they had no hopes of the Covenant of
[50:28] Abraham amen so to come into the
[50:31] Covenant of Abraham it was a spiritual
[50:34] Covenant am you you can't come into the
[50:36] New Testament without the baptism of the
[50:39] Holy Ghost you can't be a Christian
[50:41] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[50:43] see people say well I I'm going to just
[50:46] read the word going to believe the word
[50:47] amen and that's only a part of that amen
[50:50] you believe unto something but you're
[50:52] not but you're not a part of the New
[50:54] Testament because it is a blood Covenant
[50:57] or a spirit Covenant that God has made
[50:59] with the church and that's Paul saying
[51:01] here in the eth verse he said wherefore
[51:03] he saith when he ascended upon high he
[51:07] led captivity captive and gave gifts
[51:10] unto men now that he ascended what is
[51:13] but that he also descended first into
[51:16] the lowest parts of the earth and he
[51:19] that descended is the same also that
[51:21] ascended up above all Heavens that he
[51:24] might F all things so Christ had a work
[51:28] to do and he was going to fulfill all
[51:30] things amen I love when you start
[51:33] reading Apostle Paul because Paul is
[51:35] reaching back into the Old Testament
[51:37] where he has been schooled and now he's
[51:40] bringing up Messianic prophecies that
[51:43] that the Israelites and people have told
[51:45] for years and now Paul is assigning
[51:48] these prophecies to being fulfilled by
[51:50] the man Christ Jesus Amen in Psalm 68 if
[51:54] you'll watch the scripture now and
[51:56] Ephesians 4 and8 amen Paul says
[51:59] wherefore he saith he ascended he's
[52:02] quoting Psalm 68 and8 that thou has
[52:05] ascended on high thou has led captivity
[52:09] captive and thou received gifts for men
[52:12] amen Paul also assigns psalm 16 veres 9
[52:16] and 10 therefore my heart is glad and my
[52:18] glory rejoiceth My Flesh shall Rest In
[52:21] Hope for thou will not leave my soul in
[52:24] Hell see he descended first
[52:27] I will not leave my soul in hell and
[52:29] neither will I suffer my Holy One to see
[52:31] corruption so Messiah was prophesied
[52:34] Amen to go to hell but he wasn't going
[52:36] to stay in Hell amen he had to go there
[52:39] to do a work but he wasn't going to stay
[52:41] there but he was going to send up on
[52:43] high do you see it was our lord Jesus
[52:46] that went there for us as a man amen I I
[52:49] say today it's a powerful thing because
[52:51] listen my fear of going to hell is
[52:53] already gone amen cuz somebody went
[52:55] there for me
[52:57] I don't have to go to hell cuz Jesus
[52:59] went for me he became My Sacrifice he
[53:03] became my Escape go and he carried my
[53:06] sins far away and he carried them into
[53:09] hell amen where he laid them amen back
[53:12] in hell where they come from now the
[53:15] prophet of God tells us here in Hebrews
[53:16] chapter 2 Paul will say For unto us
[53:19] Angels ha he not put in subjection to
[53:21] the world to come wherefore we speak but
[53:24] of certain place testified saying what
[53:27] is a man that thou art mindful of him
[53:30] and the son of man that thou visit him
[53:32] now there's there's great titles and
[53:34] subjects every quote every scripture I'm
[53:36] reading for what is a man that thou art
[53:38] mindful you ever thought about what is a
[53:40] man that God is so mindful of you why
[53:43] can't he just let you go why why
[53:45] couldn't he just let you go with a tide
[53:47] and and and let the enemy take you
[53:49] because man amen is an attribute of God
[53:52] that came from God so God can't just let
[53:55] that go he has to redeem that amen but
[53:58] he couldn't redeem it as God he had to
[54:01] redeem it as a man so he couldn't come
[54:03] here as an angel our lord Jesus had to
[54:06] come lower than the angels and take upon
[54:09] Him amen the the form of a man take your
[54:12] time put all things in subjection under
[54:15] his feet and he left nothing that is not
[54:18] put under him but now you see that we
[54:21] see Jesus who was made lower than the
[54:23] angels for the suffering of death amen
[54:26] was made lower than the angels for the
[54:28] suffering of death crown with Glory and
[54:30] Honor that he might by the grace of God
[54:32] should taste death for every man yes sir
[54:35] now the Bible tells us in Hebrews 2:6 he
[54:38] took not on him the nature of an Angel
[54:41] but upon him the Seed of Abraham is that
[54:45] right now this is a man then Jesus was a
[54:48] man amen I don't have time to preach
[54:50] these subjects but if you believe it
[54:52] just say Amen Jesus was a man somebody
[54:55] said well we 50% man 50% God no sir he
[54:59] was all man and he was all God that's
[55:02] right amen I think it's called a
[55:04] hypostatic union there's actually a
[55:06] union amen that allows two things to
[55:09] come together without dissolving one
[55:11] another you know amen you can make God
[55:13] and man come together and that's the
[55:15] union between Father and Son that was a
[55:18] union that could remain all man and all
[55:21] God and you could put them together
[55:24] don't that tell you a powerful thing
[55:25] tonight God to become in Union with you
[55:28] and he's still just as much God as he
[55:31] was when he was in the man Christ Jesus
[55:34] when he's in the Church of the Living
[55:36] God now he was the man Jesus was a man
[55:39] but that man come from Heaven amen amen
[55:43] you see it was in John chapter 8 he said
[55:46] if God were your father you would love
[55:48] me for I proceeded forth and came from
[55:51] God neither I came from myself but he
[55:54] sent me for the father himself loveth
[55:56] you because he have loved me and he has
[55:59] believed that I came from God Amen I
[56:02] came forth from the father and I am com
[56:05] into the world John 16 and 28 and I
[56:07] leave the world and go to the father and
[56:10] his disciples said unto him Lo now
[56:12] speakest thou plainly but speak in no
[56:15] proverb and now are we sure knowest all
[56:19] things and needest not that any man
[56:21] would ask thee but by this we believe
[56:25] that thou come forth from God yes my
[56:28] look this man come from God EX look in 1
[56:31] Corinthians 15 and 45 Paul says this and
[56:34] so it is written the first man Adam was
[56:37] a living Soul that's right the last Adam
[56:40] was made a quickening spirit that's
[56:42] exactly how be it this was not first
[56:44] which is spiritual but that which is
[56:46] natural and after that which is
[56:48] spiritual the first man is of the earth
[56:52] sir Earthly but the second man is the
[56:55] Lord from heav
[56:57] oh Hallelujah that second Adam was a man
[57:01] from Heaven I tell you this the son of
[57:03] man which we are speaking of tonight is
[57:06] from heaven in John 3 and13 it said the
[57:09] son of man which is from heaven now I'll
[57:12] tell you this he descended Out of Heaven
[57:15] let me tell you this he didn't leave
[57:16] Heaven behind sir amen but when Jesus
[57:19] Come Out of Heaven he brought heaven
[57:21] with him amen amen amen he brought the
[57:24] kingdom of heaven with them now when
[57:28] Jesus came the Kingdom of Heaven came to
[57:31] the Earth that's right Hallelujah my
[57:34] brother do you know that brother randam
[57:36] said that God expanded heaven for the
[57:38] Redemption of man yes sir how did he
[57:40] expand Heaven he sent a man from Heaven
[57:44] down to this earth and when we couldn't
[57:46] go to him he came to us that's right and
[57:49] when we couldn't go to heaven he brought
[57:51] Heaven down to the Earth and when Jesus
[57:54] was on the earth heaven came down to man
[57:58] that's why amen that Jesus seen the
[58:01] Angels coming out of heaven and
[58:03] descending upon the son of man that's
[58:05] exactly you see we find out that he
[58:07] brought heaven with him amen it was
[58:10] Jesus in the expanded Place between
[58:12] heavens and the Earth it was an
[58:14] atmosphere of heaven but yet it was on
[58:16] the earth listen do you know that's
[58:18] where brother Ram said you and I were
[58:19] going to meet Jesus sir he said we won't
[58:22] meet him here and we won't meet him
[58:24] there we'll meet him in that place
[58:27] amen there's an atmosphere there is a
[58:29] dimension that comes with God when he
[58:32] comes down to the earth I think about it
[58:35] tonight that we find kingdom of God came
[58:38] to the Earth with this man Jesus amen
[58:42] you know he brought heaven with him when
[58:43] he could stand on the bow of the boat
[58:45] and say peace be still and the winds and
[58:48] waves had to obey his voice You Know
[58:50] that heaven was with him when he could
[58:52] stand there and he could tell the dead
[58:54] to rise up and walk when he can tell the
[58:57] cripples Amen to take up your bed and go
[58:59] walking off but he didn't just do that
[59:01] he said is it easier for a man to
[59:03] forgive sins he said or to heal the sick
[59:06] and he told him go sin no more you see
[59:09] he forgave sins he healed the
[59:11] amen the blind saw the deaf heard amen
[59:14] what was it he controlled nature itself
[59:17] that's right amen I'm talking about God
[59:19] came down to man he lived in this realm
[59:23] that we're living in but heaven was
[59:25] right here with
[59:26] listen it was even even the Gentile amen
[59:30] recognized the authority this man had
[59:33] when he looked at him and said I need
[59:35] you to come to my house and I need you
[59:37] to pray for my servant and Jesus said
[59:40] I'll come down and pray and he said but
[59:42] wait a minute I don't need you to come I
[59:44] just need your word to come
[59:47] hallelujah hallelujah I I I don't want
[59:51] to get deep into it but the prophet of
[59:53] God said it like this amen that Jes
[59:56] Jesus didn't do the work but it was his
[59:58] father that dwelt in him that's right
[1:00:00] how many knows brother BR said the
[1:00:02] father was the Dynamics in the mechanics
[1:00:04] of the sun amen and it was the Dynamics
[1:00:07] that was dwelling in him amen the
[1:00:09] atmosphere moved with the word of God I
[1:00:12] was spoken out at the mouth of Jesus he
[1:00:15] never physically went down there no sir
[1:00:18] because it wasn't his physical body that
[1:00:20] did the work it was the atmosphere that
[1:00:23] accompanied the word which he spoke
[1:00:26] and I say something tonight that same
[1:00:29] word that issued out of the mouth of our
[1:00:31] Lord Jesus is still alive tonight and
[1:00:34] that atmosphere still moves with this
[1:00:37] word because this word can come in your
[1:00:39] deepest darkest trial it can come in the
[1:00:42] hell of your homes and the troubles and
[1:00:44] the struggles but it brings an
[1:00:46] atmosphere when it comes my brother yes
[1:00:49] sir oh yeah I know what I'm talking
[1:00:51] about I'm talking about the word
[1:00:53] bringing something to you yes brother
[1:00:57] take your time yes when Jesus came yes
[1:01:00] sir see the atmospheres themselves have
[1:01:02] been blocked off from from the fall of
[1:01:05] Adam that's right amen since the days of
[1:01:07] the Garden of Eden and sin committed
[1:01:09] there was a Gloom over the earth and the
[1:01:12] prophet said prayers couldn't even reach
[1:01:13] under the heavens because the Gloom and
[1:01:16] superstitions and sin had blocked man
[1:01:19] off from Heaven that's right oh but when
[1:01:21] Jesus came yes sir amen when Jesus came
[1:01:25] amen he br brought Heaven down to the
[1:01:27] Earth yes sir and then he himself became
[1:01:30] sin sacrifice that's right yes now now I
[1:01:35] I don't I can't preach all night so I
[1:01:36] got to I got to hurry but let me just
[1:01:38] just say this clearly to you take your
[1:01:40] time he descended before he ascended
[1:01:43] that's exactly right and when he
[1:01:45] descended he went to hell now y'all
[1:01:47] don't nobody sugarcoat this amen he
[1:01:50] became a sinner the Bible said he who
[1:01:52] knew no sin became sin that he might
[1:01:55] take our sins upon Him amen what was it
[1:01:59] he became sin and died a sinner's death
[1:02:02] and he went to a sinner's Hellen but he
[1:02:05] wasn't a sinner he was The Lord Of Glory
[1:02:09] he descended into hell to defeat hell
[1:02:11] that he might take the
[1:02:13] keys that he might take the keys away
[1:02:16] from the devil because he took the
[1:02:18] Triple Crown of death hell in the grave
[1:02:21] and he conquered them and Rose up on the
[1:02:23] third day to prove to the devil you have
[1:02:26] not power which you won in the days of
[1:02:28] Adam you lost it you lost the power of
[1:02:31] hell you lost the power of the Grave you
[1:02:34] have lost your power amen I have thou
[1:02:37] the keys am now look at what he was
[1:02:39] going to do with these
[1:02:41] Keys when he went back into the Earth
[1:02:44] sir now this is a powerful thing folks
[1:02:46] because when he went back into the Earth
[1:02:48] our lord Jesus when he was seen there
[1:02:50] early in the morning at the tomb there
[1:02:53] was a woman standing there and he said
[1:02:55] why weep
[1:02:56] and she went over to touch him and he
[1:02:58] said don't you touch me take your time
[1:03:01] don't you touch me take your time for I
[1:03:03] have not yet ascended unto my father yes
[1:03:07] sir but if you ever noticed it's only a
[1:03:09] few days later that's right that he
[1:03:11] appears in the room with his disciples
[1:03:14] and he says to Thomas come and touch me
[1:03:17] that's right something had happened
[1:03:20] between that morning at the resurrection
[1:03:23] and the evening when Thomas was
[1:03:25] commanded to touch him I tell you what
[1:03:27] the prophet said he said his work wasn't
[1:03:29] done when he was resurrected but he yet
[1:03:32] had the work of the high priest to do
[1:03:35] brother and if you look in the Old
[1:03:36] Testament the high priest had to take
[1:03:39] the blood into the holies of holies and
[1:03:42] only one man could enter the holies of
[1:03:45] holies and he could atone for the sins
[1:03:47] of many my brother and our lord Jesus
[1:03:50] tread The Wine Press of the wrath of God
[1:03:52] Alone yes my and he resurrected alone
[1:03:56] yes sir and he went in the presence of
[1:03:57] God Alone yes sir amen but after he had
[1:04:00] atoned for our sins he turned around and
[1:04:03] came back into the Earth hallelujah
[1:04:07] hallelujah and preached 40 days of his
[1:04:10] kingdom and how it would be upon the
[1:04:12] earth when he did this amen our lord
[1:04:16] Jesus standing there having done the
[1:04:19] work of the Ascension amen he had broke
[1:04:21] through the death's hell he had broke
[1:04:23] through now listen folks y'all know this
[1:04:26] he had broke through every barrier of
[1:04:28] unbelief he had broke through every
[1:04:30] barrier of sin he had paid sin's debt he
[1:04:33] Whi the devil and all of his angels He
[1:04:36] took power over Heaven he took power in
[1:04:39] the earth and he took power in the hell
[1:04:41] and that he could stand there and say
[1:04:43] all power in Heaven and Earth is given
[1:04:46] unto me let me tell you what he did when
[1:04:49] he was getting ready to leave this earth
[1:04:52] he didn't just leave he gave a
[1:04:54] commission that's right
[1:04:56] yes after after hell was conquered after
[1:05:01] the Crave was conquered after sickness
[1:05:03] was conquered yes sir he gave a
[1:05:06] commission to his church go ahead now
[1:05:08] you know I think about this sometimes
[1:05:10] you you you read the words of a man but
[1:05:13] I want to know what kind of man I'm
[1:05:15] listening to you read what somebody said
[1:05:18] but I want to know where they were
[1:05:19] standing when they said it that's it you
[1:05:22] know you know what I'm saying amen we
[1:05:24] saying all is well well that's song's
[1:05:26] okay until you hear the story behind
[1:05:29] it and it takes another level that's it
[1:05:32] that's it Nearer My God to the takes a
[1:05:34] different level it matters where a man
[1:05:37] was standing when he said it see when
[1:05:39] Paul said that the victory amen where
[1:05:42] grave is thy Victory amen it's been
[1:05:45] given to me now that's one thing to say
[1:05:47] that sitting in a comfy chair in your
[1:05:50] church but that man had his head on a
[1:05:52] chopping block amen so the words become
[1:05:55] more powerful according to who said it
[1:05:57] and where they said it at amen when you
[1:06:01] read Mark 16 you can see that our lord
[1:06:04] Jesus had taken power over death Hell In
[1:06:06] The Grave he had conquered the
[1:06:08] atmospheres of sin sickness and death he
[1:06:11] had took complete control of Heaven amen
[1:06:14] and we know that he's now going to be
[1:06:16] ascending to heaven to sit upon the
[1:06:19] right hand of the father that he might
[1:06:21] bring his authority back to the Church
[1:06:24] of the Living God and the last words he
[1:06:26] said to his church he said unto them go

[1:09:28] into heaven and they set upon the right
[1:09:30] hand of God do you see tonight we're
[1:09:32] talking about words that were spoken the
[1:09:35] last words that Jesus gave to the church
[1:09:38] amen the last thing he said amen so is
[1:09:41] it's in 1965 in your language amen this
[1:09:45] ain't something that you can you you can
[1:09:47] cast off for another time this is
[1:09:49] current events this is current word this
[1:09:53] March 16 was a commission of a new
[1:09:56] gospel that was being preached unto that
[1:09:58] generation because it was the Covenant
[1:10:00] of almighty God yes sir his last and
[1:10:03] final words he's ordaining a new order
[1:10:07] amen oh
[1:10:09] Hallelujah Jesus is ordaining a new
[1:10:12] order yes sir brother Jesus himself
[1:10:16] ordained this foolish thing that I'm
[1:10:18] doing
[1:10:20] [Music]
[1:10:21] tonight hey what you call foolish the
[1:10:24] Bible said don't you forget this by the
[1:10:27] foolishness of preaching man shall be
[1:10:32] saved amen your physical body your
[1:10:35] spiritual body salvation comes from the
[1:10:38] word of the Lord yes sir amen you see he
[1:10:42] ordained a new order he was changing the
[1:10:46] priesthood that's exactly right Aaron's
[1:10:49] priesthood has now ended and there's a
[1:10:52] new order that's come on the scene a new
[1:10:54] way
[1:10:56] a new way of doing things I love how
[1:10:59] Paul said in a new and a living way amen
[1:11:02] it would be the preaching of the Gospel
[1:11:05] that's right see this would be under the
[1:11:07] order of
[1:11:09] maledict this would not be under the
[1:11:11] order of Aaron this would not come under
[1:11:13] the order of Levi this would come under
[1:11:15] the order of
[1:11:17] maledict do you see in Hebrews 7 the
[1:11:20] Bible tells us Perfection was not
[1:11:22] brought under Aaron's order amen the the
[1:11:25] Bible says therefore Perfection were by
[1:11:27] the levitical priesthood for under it
[1:11:29] the people received the law what further
[1:11:32] need would there be for another priest
[1:11:34] that should rise after the order of
[1:11:36] Mount cdct see if if Aaron's tribe did
[1:11:40] it if the Levis did it then what need
[1:11:43] would there be for another order to come
[1:11:46] but because it was weak in its law and
[1:11:49] it's weak in what it could do there was
[1:11:52] need for another it had to be a
[1:11:54] priesthood change but there also had to
[1:11:57] be a change of the law do you see their
[1:11:59] priesthood was weak because of the law
[1:12:02] because the law amen was something that
[1:12:05] was making through the carnal flesh I
[1:12:07] love how the scripture tells us that
[1:12:09] there had to be a change of law there
[1:12:12] had to be a change of priesthood that
[1:12:14] God had another sacrifice now he had
[1:12:17] another system now and he had another
[1:12:19] priesthood now it would be a gospel
[1:12:22] system it would be a gospel preacher and
[1:12:25] it will be the sacrifice of his own
[1:12:28] blood do you know amen that our Lord
[1:12:31] never sprang out of Judah our Lord who
[1:12:34] was the high priest of this church never
[1:12:36] came from Judah but the Bible said amen
[1:12:39] of whom things spoken pertained to a
[1:12:41] tribe which no man gave attendance to
[1:12:44] The Altar for it is evident that our
[1:12:46] Lord spring out of Judah at which Moses
[1:12:49] spoke nothing concerning priesthood yet
[1:12:52] it is more evident that the similitude
[1:12:55] of mecdc there ariseth another priest
[1:12:59] who is made not after the law of carnal
[1:13:02] Commandments but after the power of an
[1:13:05] endless life Hallelujah Jesus was not a
[1:13:09] he was not a high priest by law he was
[1:13:11] not a high priest because he was in the
[1:13:13] levitical law he was a priest by the
[1:13:16] power of endless life that's what it is
[1:13:18] there are a priest Forever After the
[1:13:21] order of mecdc the 18th verse says this
[1:13:24] there is there therefore a dising of the
[1:13:26] Commandment before the weakness and
[1:13:28] unprofitableness thereof for the law
[1:13:31] made nothing
[1:13:33] perfect can somebody help me tonight the
[1:13:36] law made nothing perfect can we say it
[1:13:39] again the law made nothing perfect see
[1:13:43] who has Bewitched thee Oh galatian that
[1:13:46] thou have begun in the spirit you that
[1:13:50] began in the spirit will you now be made
[1:13:53] perfect in the law will you leave the
[1:13:56] spiritual attitude will you leave the
[1:13:59] spiritual word for the carnal
[1:14:01] Commandments of man for the laws and
[1:14:03] traditions of the altars amen but I say
[1:14:06] that there was nothing made perfect by
[1:14:08] it there was never a man made perfect by
[1:14:11] matter of fact somebody had to come from
[1:14:13] outside of it to fix the whole
[1:14:17] thing for the law made nothing perfect
[1:14:20] but the bringing of a better hope did
[1:14:22] that was Christ by which we draw nigh
[1:14:26] unto God see what the law Paul says in
[1:14:29] Romans 8 what the law could not do in
[1:14:32] that it was weak through the flesh God
[1:14:34] sending his own son in the likeness of
[1:14:36] sinful flesh condemn sin in the flesh
[1:14:39] you see in Hebrews 10 he said it's not
[1:14:42] possible somebody say possible possible
[1:14:45] it's not
[1:14:47] possible it's not possible this is the
[1:14:49] beauty it's not possible that blood and
[1:14:52] goats could take away sins and me it's
[1:14:55] powerless to remove sins then he said lo
[1:14:59] I come to do thy will oh God and he
[1:15:01] taketh away the first so he could
[1:15:04] establish the
[1:15:06] second listen if he hadn't to took away
[1:15:08] the first I don't even have a right to
[1:15:11] preach to you
[1:15:12] tonight the Gentile can't even preach
[1:15:15] the gospel because we're not Israelite
[1:15:18] by birth amen we're not of the tribe of
[1:15:21] Levi we have no rights to the attendance
[1:15:23] of the altar but out of Judah spring a
[1:15:28] line and this was the order of mecdc
[1:15:32] became God became the priest of the
[1:15:34] church let me say something to you
[1:15:36] tonight your pastor is not just a pastor
[1:15:39] but it's God's office to speak to the
[1:15:42] Church of the Living
[1:15:45] God hallelujah amen in Hebrews 10 he
[1:15:49] said by one offering he perfected
[1:15:51] forever them that are Sanctified do you
[1:15:53] see what it is when Levi and and and and
[1:15:56] and had been spoken to concerning his
[1:15:59] tribe and the tithing that would go to
[1:16:01] his tribe you remember what he said to
[1:16:03] him he said to him he said Levi you were
[1:16:05] in the loins of Abraham when he paid
[1:16:08] tithes under meaned so the priest who
[1:16:11] descended from the natural loins of
[1:16:13] Abraham through the Levites and there
[1:16:16] they had attendance at the altar but
[1:16:18] just as Levi was in Abraham so is today
[1:16:22] the bride was in the loins of meaz
[1:16:25] we were as much in mdict as Levi
[1:16:30] was Hallelujah listen we are not a
[1:16:33] levitical law we are the order of mecaz
[1:16:36] that God has come into his church it's
[1:16:41] God the priesthood it's God of the order
[1:16:44] do you see for ordained gifts the Bible
[1:16:47] tells us that they ordained the prophet
[1:16:49] of God said the gift of ministry he said
[1:16:52] was ordained before the foundation of
[1:16:53] the world do you know the Prophet said
[1:16:55] gifts and callings are even without
[1:16:59] repentance I know I know what I'm
[1:17:01] talking about long even sometimes after
[1:17:03] men disqualify themselves they're still
[1:17:06] gifted amen I you know what I'm talking
[1:17:08] about down here in the South some of
[1:17:10] these guys have went out amen and done
[1:17:12] everything amen everything they could to
[1:17:14] disqualify their Ministries but because
[1:17:17] they still got a
[1:17:18] gift because they still got a gift don't
[1:17:21] mean they're qualified to use the gift
[1:17:23] in the house of God see see repentance
[1:17:26] does not change the gift of God because
[1:17:29] the gift is for ordained of God that's
[1:17:32] why you don't receive gift by laying
[1:17:33] hands of the elders amen you can lay
[1:17:36] your hands on a man till you turn blue
[1:17:38] in the face but if God ain't called him
[1:17:40] to preach amen he'll never be a
[1:17:44] preacher I know I know in this
[1:17:47] generation we got some guys calling
[1:17:48] other guys to preach well I tell you
[1:17:50] what some of the guys they called ain't
[1:17:52] much preachers and I think they are to
[1:17:54] have to preach them if they call them
[1:17:56] but if God called them God will preach
[1:17:58] them amen the Bible said that a gift
[1:18:01] will make a room for
[1:18:03] itself come on it's not brother Steven's
[1:18:06] job to make a room for your gift it's
[1:18:08] God's job to make room for your gift
[1:18:11] amen
[1:18:12] oh hey somebody help the preacher in
[1:18:15] here
[1:18:16] tonight a gift from God is ordained from
[1:18:20] God and God will take care of the gift
[1:18:23] he ordains
[1:18:24] [Applause]
[1:18:26] Ministry comes from God it's not it's

[1:18:37] gospel my uncle does it so I'll do it
[1:18:40] not this gospel this is not the law of
[1:18:43] carnal Commandments this is the power of
[1:18:46] endless life this is mdic order this is
[1:18:50] God ordained gifts God ordained
[1:18:53] men
[1:18:54] [Music]
[1:18:56] Hallelujah hey now my Bible said that
[1:19:00] Jesus amen brought us into him and made
[1:19:03] us new
[1:19:04] creatures and old things passed away and
[1:19:07] All Things become new and all things are
[1:19:10] of God who reconciled himself by Jesus
[1:19:13] Christ and hath given to us the ministry
[1:19:16] of
[1:19:18] reconciliation
[1:19:19] Hallelujah to Wi that God was in Christ
[1:19:23] there's your order amen there's the
[1:19:25] order God was in Christ reconciling the
[1:19:29] world to himself not imputing their
[1:19:31] trespasses but hath now committed unto
[1:19:36] us the word of reconciliation and we are
[1:19:41] ambassadors for Christ Hallelujah then
[1:19:44] that means you can't treat me any way
[1:19:46] you want to I come from a Heavenly
[1:19:50] place you can't talk to me any way you
[1:19:53] want to you can't talk about me any way
[1:19:56] you want to I Come From Heaven and I'm
[1:19:59] going back to heaven and I'm here to do
[1:20:02] the will of My Father which is in heaven
[1:20:06] Hallelujah listen I know people's got so
[1:20:09] so lazy with how they talk to one
[1:20:11] another in this age but listen in the
[1:20:12] message respects brother B said if you
[1:20:14] respect one another you're respecting
[1:20:16] God and sometimes I think the church
[1:20:19] ought to go back and listen to the
[1:20:20] message respect because they think they
[1:20:23] can talk to their Pastor anyway
[1:20:25] they think they can talk to the Deacon
[1:20:27] anyway they talk to the Evangelist
[1:20:29] anyway I know this might be an Apostolic
[1:20:32] anointing but it's the truth anyhow we
[1:20:34] need to watch how we talk to God's
[1:20:37] laborers who are in the vineyard they
[1:20:39] belong to
[1:20:42] him somebody said to me some time ago
[1:20:45] they said well I tell you what brother
[1:20:47] Wayne so and so's doing certain and so
[1:20:49] and so doing certain thing what do you
[1:20:50] think I said I don't judge another man's
[1:20:52] servant they ain't my preachers I'm not
[1:20:55] judging them amen God will judges
[1:20:58] men we're not a
[1:21:01] denomination we are not a
[1:21:04] denomination amen we are a
[1:21:07] kingdom and God is in control of our
[1:21:11] kingdom come on church do you see what
[1:21:15] it is it's the gospel of Christ and this
[1:21:17] is the power of God unto salvation to
[1:21:21] everyone that believeth it's the power
[1:21:24] of God no I'm not ashamed of the Gospel
[1:21:28] no I'm not ashamed to preach the gospel
[1:21:31] it is the power of God unto salvation
[1:21:34] you can try to get saved any way you
[1:21:36] want to but God set it up in his
[1:21:39] Covenant that the hearing of the word is
[1:21:42] the way salvation is brought to your
[1:21:47] life I know that people think they can
[1:21:50] fire the ministry you can't fire the
[1:21:52] ministry you didn't hire me you can't
[1:21:55] fire me you didn't put me in you can't
[1:21:57] take me out God sent me to this earth he
[1:22:02] sent me here to preach this message they
[1:22:05] said well you preach the message of
[1:22:06] William Brandon when you'll be put out
[1:22:08] that's all right I'll be in good company
[1:22:10] cuz they put Christ outside the church
[1:22:13] amen and the Bible said they went
[1:22:15] outside the camp to fellowship with him
[1:22:19] Hallelujah you can't fire a man of God
[1:22:22] you can't fire somebody God sent to
[1:22:26] you oh you you now y'all y'all know I'm
[1:22:29] in the Bible Jezebel tried brother said
[1:22:33] he said Elijah was her pastor
[1:22:38] anyhow Elijah was her pastor whether she
[1:22:41] liked it or not and she was given space
[1:22:44] to
[1:22:46] repent look at what I'm talking about
[1:22:48] it's the gospel it's the good news
[1:22:51] coming from God but if we waited till
[1:22:53] there wasn't a controversy to preach we
[1:22:55] wouldn't never preach if we waited for
[1:22:58] permission from the Deacon board to
[1:22:59] address situations they would never get
[1:23:02] addressed people are more interested in
[1:23:04] filling the pews than filling heaven I'm
[1:23:06] not interested in congregation sizes I'm
[1:23:09] not interested in crowds I'm interested
[1:23:12] in the power of God that'll put a man in
[1:23:15] the
[1:23:17] Rapture
[1:23:19] Hallelujah you know what I'm talking
[1:23:21] about we don't need to take a poll to
[1:23:23] see what we can preach and can't preach
[1:23:25] amen well we got to leave this part of
[1:23:26] the message alone and we can't get over
[1:23:28] here and we can't do this listen let me
[1:23:30] say this if a prophet of God said it we
[1:23:32] can say it if the Bible said it we can
[1:23:35] preach it amen and I say this if hell
[1:23:38] don't like it hell better get out of the
[1:23:40] way cuz the ministry in this hour won't
[1:23:43] be retreating they won't be surrendering
[1:23:46] they'll be standing in the place of God
[1:23:49] they've been anointed to preach the
[1:23:51] gospel for therein is the righteousness
[1:23:54] of God
[1:23:56] revealed me you my brother take your
[1:23:59] time I'm talking about
[1:24:01] Jesus I'm talking about the one that
[1:24:03] controls everything said I I commission
[1:24:07] you to preach the
[1:24:11] gospel now back in the old days they had
[1:24:14] they had the sounding of the trumpet
[1:24:16] y'all know that every 50 years the
[1:24:18] trumpet was sounded for Jubilee right so
[1:24:21] what it would mean is if you sold
[1:24:23] something in 50 years and you lost your
[1:24:25] house you lost your car you got in debt
[1:24:27] whatever every 50 years he cleared all
[1:24:29] the debts let you get all your stuff
[1:24:31] back and start over again that's what it
[1:24:34] meant actually it's what it meant don't
[1:24:36] do don't do dealings with God's people
[1:24:40] cuz the devil you're going to lose every
[1:24:43] time cuz God's going to clear all my
[1:24:45] debts and laugh at you when you come to
[1:24:47] tell him I owe
[1:24:50] something yeah he
[1:24:53] will and then the Old Testament do you
[1:24:56] see they they would only sacrifice up
[1:24:58] there in Jerusalem and the blood would
[1:24:59] be people who wasn't at Jerusalem how
[1:25:02] did they know that there was blood up
[1:25:04] there how did they know the sacrifice
[1:25:06] had come on the Jubilee the Bible said
[1:25:09] that they would blow a jubilee trumpet
[1:25:12] which was a Ram's
[1:25:14] Horn which was a winded instrument which
[1:25:17] had no power within itself it had to be
[1:25:20] blowed through so the breath that blowed
[1:25:23] through it would be the sound to say
[1:25:25] atonement if you heard it if you heard
[1:25:28] it you could tell your neighbor the
[1:25:31] atonement is
[1:25:32] made come on y'all we can go home how do
[1:25:35] you know we can go home didn't you hear
[1:25:38] that did didn't you hear that well I I
[1:25:41] heard it but what does it mean it means
[1:25:44] the debts are
[1:25:46] paid see a lot of people hear the gospel
[1:25:48] but they don't know what it
[1:25:50] means let me tell you what it means when
[1:25:52] you hear this gospel it means the debts
[1:25:55] are paid it means the thing is cleared
[1:25:58] up and God has forgiven you your sin it
[1:26:01] means you can go home you can go back to
[1:26:04] Daddy's house you can come back in the
[1:26:06] presence of
[1:26:10] God do you see every 50 years every 50
[1:26:15] years the Levites would sign that horn
[1:26:17] and they would do it they would sound
[1:26:18] the Rams Horn and they would do it in
[1:26:20] the 50th year at the right time under
[1:26:22] the right atonement and that that was
[1:26:24] the acceptable year from Isaiah
[1:26:27] 61 but when Jesus comes in Luke 4 he
[1:26:30] picks the Bible up he picks up the
[1:26:33] scripture and he says I have been
[1:26:36] anointed to preach the acceptable year
[1:26:39] he's not going to blow a horn like they
[1:26:41] did he's not acting like Levi's tribe
[1:26:44] he's not acting like Aaron's tribe he's
[1:26:47] commissioning a new way of Jubilee it's
[1:26:50] not a Rams Horn it's a man preaching the
[1:26:54] go Gospel of Jesus
[1:26:57] [Applause]
[1:26:59] Christ but hey but he's still just an
[1:27:04] instrument he's still just an instrument
[1:27:07] and he can only say what comes through
[1:27:12] him oh yeah the inspiration comes which
[1:27:16] is the wind of God my Bible said that
[1:27:18] the Bible is good for Doctrine and it
[1:27:22] was written by the breath of almighty
[1:27:23] God
[1:27:25] so when when the scripture comes through
[1:27:27] a god anointed man it's the breath of
[1:27:31] the atonement breathing out upon the
[1:27:34] church I'm not talking about a dead
[1:27:36] letter I'm talking about the Gospel of
[1:27:39] Jesus
[1:27:40] Christ Life coming out God has ordained
[1:27:44] another way it's to preach the
[1:27:46] acceptable year now the anointing has
[1:27:50] come to preach the gospel to stand
[1:27:53] before people and declare to them that
[1:27:56] the blood of the Lord Jesus has come to
[1:27:58] set the captive free to bind up the
[1:28:01] Brokenhearted that the poor might have
[1:28:03] the gospel preached unto them amen the
[1:28:06] atonement is made known by the preaching
[1:28:09] of the
[1:28:11] Gospel now
[1:28:13] y'all y'all the the the the cross was
[1:28:16] 2,000 years
[1:28:18] ago you can't see it you can't smell it
[1:28:23] you can't feel it but you can hear
[1:28:28] it but you can hear the cross for the
[1:28:31] preaching of the Cross is to them
[1:28:33] foolishness but to
[1:28:35] us it's the power of God under salvation
[1:28:39] do you see the preaching of the
[1:28:42] Cross oh I'm talking about the preaching
[1:28:45] of the blood of our Lord Jesus you don't
[1:28:48] see it you ain't there but you can get
[1:28:50] it the same as if you were standing
[1:28:52] there
[1:28:54] because it's not the liquid blood that
[1:28:57] we're putting on you it's the life that
[1:29:00] was in the
[1:29:02] blood now now come on I'm going to go
[1:29:04] back to the first of my sermon now when
[1:29:06] that word come from Heaven it brought
[1:29:09] heaven with
[1:29:10] it and when the word of God comes it
[1:29:13] brings heaven with it the word comes
[1:29:17] Anointed with a Heavenly atmosphere
[1:29:20] because the word is not from man the
[1:29:22] word is from God
[1:29:24] oh my goodness listen there will never
[1:29:27] be another
[1:29:28] Calvary there'll never be another
[1:29:30] shedding of the blood y'all remember
[1:29:33] what Moses did wrong don't y'all he Smit
[1:29:36] the rock the second time brother Bram
[1:29:39] said what he did is he broke every tight
[1:29:40] in scripture he should have spoke to
[1:29:42] that
[1:29:43] rock he should have spoke to it cuz it
[1:29:46] was already smitten and the Church of
[1:29:48] the Living God we don't have to have
[1:29:49] another Calvary but it's time for us to
[1:29:51] speak to the Rock
[1:29:54] and we can get the same Waters that they
[1:29:56] got in the first days in the last days
[1:29:59] if we just speak to the Rock if you
[1:30:02] speak to that rock do you see there will
[1:30:05] not be another
[1:30:08] Calvary won't be another Calvary but
[1:30:11] there'll be a preaching of this gospel
[1:30:13] now I know people today you know you
[1:30:15] preach the message and they come say
[1:30:16] well you don't preach enough the but of
[1:30:18] blood I tell oh my
[1:30:20] goodness amen I don't mean to make fun
[1:30:22] of somebody but that's scripture
[1:30:25] ignorant come on church amen this is the
[1:30:29] product of the
[1:30:31] cross the prophet of God said him and
[1:30:34] his message was one listen let me tell
[1:30:36] you the greatest message you ever heard
[1:30:38] was not a preach and not just a preach
[1:30:41] sermon but a lived
[1:30:43] one y'all know what I'm talking about it
[1:30:45] wasn't just brother Ram's words it was
[1:30:48] deity
[1:30:51] speaking it was deity speaking when
[1:30:54] stood there and created that squirrel
[1:30:56] you tell me what that meant when he said
[1:30:57] let there be a squirrel and he didn't
[1:30:59] say in the name of the Lord and he
[1:31:02] didn't say thus sayeth the
[1:31:04] Lord because he didn't say it for the
[1:31:06] Lord it was the Lord that said
[1:31:09] [Applause]
[1:31:10] it come on Church the blood the blood
[1:31:16] the blood broke the curse and it put man
[1:31:19] back in Eden again so that a man could
[1:31:22] speak he could speak again he can bring
[1:31:26] creative atmosphere again he could bring
[1:31:28] creative anointing
[1:31:31] again I'm talking about the
[1:31:34] blood a man in his message is
[1:31:38] one do you see the the gift of healing
[1:31:41] doesn't mean that I have a gift myself
[1:31:44] to
[1:31:44] heal brother B said it don't mean that
[1:31:47] it means a man has got faith in Divine
[1:31:50] Healing so he points the people to the
[1:31:53] finished work of
[1:31:57] Calvary now listen I know some of you
[1:32:00] feel like you got saved 10 years ago and
[1:32:02] some of you feel like you got saved 20
[1:32:04] years ago but I'll tell you what brother
[1:32:06] brandom said he said you wasn't saved 10
[1:32:08] or 20 or 30 or 40 he said you were saved
[1:32:14] 2,000 God did everything he could ever
[1:32:17] do for you at
[1:32:18] Calvary come on church if Jesus was
[1:32:22] standing here tonight
[1:32:25] all he could do is to point you at the
[1:32:27] finished work of Calvary that's all he
[1:32:30] could do is stand here tonight cuz
[1:32:33] there's where he broke the backbone of
[1:32:35] Satan I know these are simple points
[1:32:38] let's let's remember this that it was at
[1:32:41] Calvary where he broke the backbone of
[1:32:44] the devil because he destroyed sin
[1:32:47] through one
[1:32:49] sacrifice now it's not every day we're
[1:32:52] trying to figure out how to not be a
[1:32:54] sinner it's not every service we're
[1:32:56] trying to figure out how to not be a
[1:32:58] sinner but but the blood atonement the
[1:33:01] blood atonement of Jesus Christ took sin
[1:33:04] away from
[1:33:05] you and you didn't know it it was that
[1:33:09] way for 1900 years and you didn't know
[1:33:11] it but one night you were sitting in a
[1:33:13] gospel meeting and somebody said the
[1:33:16] blood did it for you and all you did is
[1:33:18] in your little heart begin to believe
[1:33:21] the blood did it for me and right there
[1:33:24] you accepted the atonement of sacrifice
[1:33:28] Hallelujah now listen I I I I think that
[1:33:31] it's important for us to know this that
[1:33:33] we got to have something Beyond The
[1:33:34] Altar we got to have something Beyond we
[1:33:37] come to the altar we receive the spirit
[1:33:38] of God but then
[1:33:40] what but then what are we lost and saved
[1:33:43] every week are we lost and saved every
[1:33:45] time something comes along every
[1:33:47] struggle but my Bible said grieve not
[1:33:50] the spirit of God whereby you are sealed
[1:33:53] unto the day of your
[1:33:55] [Applause]
[1:33:57] Redemption I know I know that really
[1:34:01] hurts the legalist Doctrine but I didn't
[1:34:03] get called to preach the legalist
[1:34:04] Doctrine I found out that legalism don't
[1:34:07] do anything but kill the
[1:34:10] church and let me say this just as clear
[1:34:12] as I know how most legalist preachers I
[1:34:14] know has got more sin in the back room
[1:34:17] than 90% of their churches and they're
[1:34:20] hiding behind their critical spirit
[1:34:25] well glory be to
[1:34:28] God well somebody holler
[1:34:32] preach it's the truth Brothers it's the
[1:34:38] truth you wasn't saved two years
[1:34:41] ago you wasn't saved five years ago
[1:34:45] everything he did he did at
[1:34:47] Calvary now that's why Jesus sent his
[1:34:51] disciples into the Earth to preach the
[1:34:53] gospel because it would be the good news
[1:34:57] of what he had done for you and
[1:34:59] me the good news would reach our heart
[1:35:02] and we find out this is why in Galatians
[1:35:05] 3 and8 Paul will say this the scriptures
[1:35:09] foreseeing God would justify the Heathen
[1:35:13] through
[1:35:14] faith oh my
[1:35:16] goodness the Heathen that's me and you
[1:35:20] that's idop packing heathen polytheist
[1:35:23] IC believing come on church we were Idol
[1:35:28] worshippers but God who is rich in Mercy
[1:35:32] sent a preacher to your house he sent a
[1:35:35] preacher in your
[1:35:36] [Applause]
[1:35:38] life no wonder the Bible said beautiful
[1:35:41] are the feet of them that carry the
[1:35:44] gospel I don't care if he got the
[1:35:46] ugliest feet that ever was beautiful are
[1:35:48] the
[1:35:50] feet he's bringing the good news
[1:35:59] this Heathen would be saved through
[1:36:02] faith how did Rahab get saved even under
[1:36:05] the old
[1:36:06] Covenant how'd she do it she had Faith
[1:36:10] the Bible said she was justified by her
[1:36:12] works is that right but she was
[1:36:15] justified by the works because she
[1:36:17] believed so her Works were the works of
[1:36:20] Faith come on your works are works
[1:36:22] that's fine but they got to be works of
[1:36:30] Faith now I don't I don't have a week to
[1:36:33] preach on the Bible but how many
[1:36:34] believes the Bible is the word of
[1:36:37] God I believe it's the word of God and I
[1:36:40] believe it's given for inspiration and
[1:36:42] instruction and correction is that right
[1:36:45] and Doctrine for who soever shall call
[1:36:48] on the name of the Lord who
[1:36:50] whoever I like that don't you whoever
[1:36:53] the Heathen will be justified by faith
[1:36:55] so you're not too far gone to call on
[1:36:57] the name of the
[1:36:59] Lord listen Jonah was in the belly of
[1:37:02] the well and called on the name of the
[1:37:03] Lord the Hebrew children was in the
[1:37:06] fiery furnace and called on the name of
[1:37:08] the Lord amen listen you can't get too
[1:37:11] far that you can take the prayer out of
[1:37:13] a Saint's heart Samson thought he was
[1:37:16] too far but the prophet of God said he
[1:37:18] caught a vision that a prayer meeting
[1:37:20] would change
[1:37:21] things whosoever whoever shall call on
[1:37:24] the name of the Lord
[1:37:26] shall be
[1:37:30] saved but how but how listen whoever
[1:37:35] calls on his name will be saved but
[1:37:39] how shall they call in whom have they
[1:37:42] not
[1:37:43] believed and how shall they believe on
[1:37:46] whom they have not
[1:37:47] heard and how shall they hear without a
[1:37:51] preacher come on a preacher ain't
[1:37:53] somebody you can take or put away it
[1:37:56] ain't somebody you can just say well we
[1:37:57] want them we don't want them it's God's
[1:38:00] office it's what God done for this
[1:38:03] generation do you see how they call upon
[1:38:06] him who they not believe say how shall
[1:38:08] they hear without a preacher and how
[1:38:10] shall they preach except they be
[1:38:13] sent for it is written how beautiful are
[1:38:15] the feet of them that preach the gospel
[1:38:17] bring Good
[1:38:18] Tidings see but not all have obeyed the
[1:38:21] gospel Isaiah said Lord who ha belied
[1:38:24] our report so then Faith
[1:38:28] cometh Faith
[1:38:30] cometh listen to this you said brother
[1:38:32] Wayne I don't have any faith faith
[1:38:36] cometh you say I don't have enough Faith
[1:38:39] to be saved Faith cometh I don't have
[1:38:42] enough Faith to be healed Faith
[1:38:44] cometh I don't have enough Faith to
[1:38:47] speak squirrels Faith
[1:38:49] cometh I don't have m ming faith faith
[1:38:54] cometh you said brother I need faith
[1:38:56] faith cometh how does faith come Faith
[1:39:00] cometh by the hearing of the word of
[1:39:04] God listen can I say it can can I say it
[1:39:08] Faith don't come by the hearing of
[1:39:11] psychology Faith don't come by the
[1:39:13] hearing of good
[1:39:14] music Faith don't come by TNT or CNN
[1:39:21] or I'm going to say it
[1:39:24] es
[1:39:28] being that's not how Faith
[1:39:31] Comes Faith cometh by the hearing and
[1:39:35] the hearing of the word of God I say God
[1:39:38] give us some gospel preachers I say God
[1:39:41] give us some Brands out of the fire I
[1:39:44] say God give us some men that would
[1:39:46] rather preach the gospel then breathe
[1:39:48] their next
[1:39:50] breath I tell you you ought to pray for
[1:39:52] Laborers you ought to pray that God
[1:39:54] sends you
[1:39:58] preachers the only thing a minister can
[1:40:00] do is he can explain the word in such a
[1:40:02] way that you believe Christ and then
[1:40:04] healing takes
[1:40:06] place do you see the preaching of the
[1:40:09] word of God brings a blood
[1:40:12] Veil it'll bring a blood
[1:40:14] Veil amen now y'all y'all know in Acts 2
[1:40:18] 3,000 people got saved right how'd they
[1:40:21] get saved
[1:40:23] Peter preached the
[1:40:25] gospel and they got saved you know what
[1:40:28] Peter did he sprinkled them with the
[1:40:32] blood but the words he spoke wasn't
[1:40:34] empty words they were words carrying
[1:40:39] life the preaching of the word of God
[1:40:41] brings down a veil it brings down a
[1:40:44] gospel trumpet to bring blood to your
[1:40:47] life listen the prophet of God tells us
[1:40:50] this when a minister walks in a
[1:40:52] Congregation of people praying and the
[1:40:54] anointing of the spirit you are bound to
[1:40:57] hear from
[1:40:59] Heaven do you want to hear from Heaven
[1:41:02] get to praying and invite A Gifted
[1:41:06] preacher you want to hear from Heaven
[1:41:08] get to praying and invited A Gifted
[1:41:10] preacher because the Bible said the word
[1:41:13] of God is a discerner of the thought and
[1:41:15] the intents of the heart no we might not
[1:41:17] sit here and call your name but this
[1:41:19] gospel will
[1:41:22] [Applause]
[1:41:24] Supernatural words will be spoken over
[1:41:26] your life do you see what it is it's the
[1:41:29] way God anoints a man and then you're
[1:41:31] bound to hear from Heaven I I know what
[1:41:33] I'm talking about some of you call up in
[1:41:35] a prayer closet you pray and pray and
[1:41:36] pray and you ask God to speak God speak
[1:41:39] God speak and then he'll send a man of
[1:41:41] God by and he'll preach exactly and then
[1:41:44] you don't want to line up with
[1:41:47] that I know what it is people would
[1:41:49] rather Kill the Messenger than receive
[1:41:51] the message
[1:41:54] but if you get to praying and you get a
[1:41:57] Gifted Man in the Pulpit you're going to
[1:41:58] hear from
[1:42:01] heaven now there's a lot of ways to hear
[1:42:04] from God I I I I I agree with you but
[1:42:06] let me hear see what a prophet said and
[1:42:08] what is a vision he said listen he said
[1:42:11] I think and I'll say this from my heart
[1:42:13] the greatest and highest form that there
[1:42:15] is for God to give a message to his
[1:42:17] people is for the people to believe the
[1:42:20] word the highest form is preaching the
[1:42:24] gospel it is the highest
[1:42:27] form the gospel is not a Ouija
[1:42:31] board the gospel is not a guessing gain
[1:42:35] the Gospel of Jesus Christ is sure and
[1:42:38] steadfast and unmovable and
[1:42:41] Incorruptible it is the word of
[1:42:44] God God uses
[1:42:48] men God could have used the son to
[1:42:51] preach he could have used the wind to
[1:42:54] preach but God chose man to
[1:42:59] preach do you know man is God's
[1:43:03] agent God come and visit us and he sends
[1:43:06] an
[1:43:07] agent an agent that's the hardest thing
[1:43:10] that there is is God to get one mortal
[1:43:14] to believe
[1:43:17] another what is your credentials God
[1:43:20] called me
[1:43:23] all God sent men stand on the same
[1:43:28] grounds the church don't send you God
[1:43:32] sends
[1:43:33] you listen if you standing on the church
[1:43:36] sent me or the church had me the church
[1:43:38] did me listen they could change on you
[1:43:40] all of the sudden
[1:43:42] like but when God sends you you come as
[1:43:46] an agent of the Holy Spirit and you know
[1:43:48] where you're standing see God needs men
[1:43:52] who know where they
[1:43:55] stand come on Church the problem with
[1:43:58] this America is not the Polish
[1:44:01] politicians the problem with this
[1:44:03] America is not your school teachers or
[1:44:05] your parents the problem with this
[1:44:07] America is weak pull
[1:44:10] pits well it's the
[1:44:12] truth that was a time homosexuality
[1:44:15] couldn't get in this
[1:44:16] America but a bunch of wimpy
[1:44:19] preachers backed up to it and the thing
[1:44:22] come in
[1:44:23] there was a time amen that Holiness was
[1:44:26] a standard in
[1:44:31] America but they formed
[1:44:34] denominations and the pullit crucified
[1:44:37] our Lord Jesus
[1:44:40] Christ they didn't hang him on a Roman
[1:44:43] Tree they put him on a wooden pull pit
[1:44:46] and they crucified him that's what the
[1:44:48] prophet said and he said I indict this
[1:44:51] generation for the second crucifixion of
[1:44:53] of our Lord he did not indict the
[1:44:56] people he indicted the church he
[1:44:59] indicted the pull pit for their
[1:45:01] crucifixion not of his flesh but of the
[1:45:03] effects of his
[1:45:07] word listen God needs somebody that
[1:45:10] knows where they
[1:45:11] stand he wants a man with an
[1:45:14] absolute brother Ram said what we need
[1:45:16] in a Methodist or a Baptist or a
[1:45:17] Pentecost or a Presbyterian Church is an
[1:45:20] absolute a man of God that will stand
[1:45:23] tied to the word and bring the
[1:45:25] congregation under that condition where
[1:45:28] each member walks in the condition of
[1:45:30] the
[1:45:31] word I don't care where you put him if a
[1:45:34] man ties himself to Christ as an
[1:45:36] absolute he'll bring those people under
[1:45:38] the right condition or they'll get rid
[1:45:40] of
[1:45:42] him God wants a man that knows what he's
[1:45:44] talking
[1:45:46] about I'm preaching to you God wants a
[1:45:49] man who knows what he's talking about do
[1:45:51] y'all know the Bible says that he had a
[1:45:53] man named Steven in the
[1:45:56] Bible he had a Steven in the Bible was a
[1:45:59] deacon and become
[1:46:01] [Applause]
[1:46:04] preacher Heen that's Fresh Off The Grill
[1:46:11] brother God had a man named stepen you
[1:46:13] know what they did they stoned that man
[1:46:16] you know why they stoned him because he
[1:46:18] told the truth
[1:46:20] [Music]
[1:46:23] he told the truth and they stoned him
[1:46:25] for it you remember what he done he
[1:46:28] preached against the elders didn't he he
[1:46:30] preached against the traditions and the
[1:46:32] elders and said you were circumcised
[1:46:34] heart and ears he said you do always
[1:46:36] resist the Holy Ghost and they took the
[1:46:39] tradition rather than the power of God
[1:46:42] and they killed the messenger to destroy
[1:46:45] his message and when they started
[1:46:47] stoning him the Bible said amen that he
[1:46:50] remember what he did amen he looked up
[1:46:52] into the the
[1:46:54] heavens cuzz that's where his message
[1:46:56] was coming from he didn't look to the
[1:46:58] San
[1:47:01] hedron he didn't look over at the elders
[1:47:04] and say if I change my mind will you
[1:47:05] quit stoning me but he looked up into
[1:47:08] heaven because that's where it was
[1:47:09] coming
[1:47:12] from and the Bible said when he looked
[1:47:14] he seen the heavens
[1:47:17] opened amen he knew the revelation of
[1:47:21] the Ascension work of Christ he seen the
[1:47:24] heavens opened and knew there was no
[1:47:26] barrier between him and God you can
[1:47:28] Stone me if you want to but just in a
[1:47:30] few
[1:47:31] minutes I'll be standing in the presence
[1:47:33] of my
[1:47:35] savior do you see what he did the Bible
[1:47:38] said his face shined like an
[1:47:41] angel brother said he was no angel CU
[1:47:43] angels Don't preach the gospel you know
[1:47:45] what he was he me his face shined like
[1:47:48] an angel brother B said it's because he
[1:47:50] knew what he was talking about he was so
[1:47:53] anointed because he knew where he was
[1:47:55] standing he knew what he was talking
[1:47:57] about he was an ambassador given and
[1:47:59] ordained of God with an authority to
[1:48:02] stand for God in the place of tragedy
[1:48:05] listen let me say something to you
[1:48:06] tonight amen I know people don't like
[1:48:08] amen now you people are of course you're
[1:48:10] and this tap public going all over the
[1:48:12] world right now there's people working
[1:48:14] against the moving of God they're
[1:48:15] working against the preaching of the
[1:48:17] Gospel but it's still the truth and you
[1:48:20] can bang on it and you can hit it and
[1:48:22] you can try to dismiss it but it's God's
[1:48:24] [Music]
[1:48:28] program do you know it's God's way to
[1:48:30] impart eternal life for I go unto the
[1:48:33] father and Greater Works than this you
[1:48:35] you do for I go Greater Works brother BR
[1:48:38] said greater than Jesus he said yes he
[1:48:41] said he didn't even preach the baptism
[1:48:43] of the Holy Ghost he said but he gave it
[1:48:45] unto his disciples to impart eternal
[1:48:48] life by the preaching of the word of God
[1:48:53] brother you so you can't impart eternal
[1:48:56] life a Son of God
[1:48:59] can a Son of God can do you see now the
[1:49:03] prophet of God said inside of you is the
[1:49:05] supernatural outside of you is physical
[1:49:09] and if you're a spirit-led by God you
[1:49:11] become a messenger of God or an angel
[1:49:14] God's messenger God's angel it's the
[1:49:17] same word now who has more Authority an
[1:49:21] angel at the pull
[1:49:24] pit he said or an Angel that's in
[1:49:27] heaven a messenger at the pull pit or
[1:49:30] one in heaven see the angel Anointed
[1:49:32] with the holy spirit with the word
[1:49:33] stands next to
[1:49:39] God my goodness a man of God standing in
[1:49:43] the Pulpit Anointed with the word stands
[1:49:47] next to
[1:49:50] God God did not ordain an angel to
[1:49:53] preach to you
[1:49:54] tonight now I know it would be much more
[1:49:57] advantageous If I Was An
[1:50:00] Angel it would be more advantageous if
[1:50:03] your pastor brother Steven was an angel
[1:50:06] because then he wouldn't have any quirks
[1:50:08] it wouldn't be no peculiarities there
[1:50:10] wouldn't be no conflicts there would be
[1:50:12] no failures there would be no weaknesses
[1:50:14] there would be no place to criticize
[1:50:16] amen but God had Angels but he didn't
[1:50:18] choose them he had the son but he didn't
[1:50:21] choose it he had the stars but he didn't
[1:50:23] choose it he chose man with his
[1:50:26] weaknesses and his
[1:50:29] problems and when God wanted to save man
[1:50:32] he became man showing the work of
[1:50:35] redemption is through
[1:50:38] man Hallelujah somebody said well I wish
[1:50:41] an angel would appear to me and teach me
[1:50:44] do you know what the Bible says an angel
[1:50:46] came unto unto the house of
[1:50:50] Cornelius and told him go get Peter
[1:50:54] an angel came to his house and said go
[1:50:57] get Peter Cuz if you want eternal life
[1:51:00] it'll have to come my provided
[1:51:02] way go get Peter and Peter was up on the
[1:51:06] housetop and an angel appeared to
[1:51:09] him and said go preach the
[1:51:12] gospel Peter sees and looks and says
[1:51:15] Lord hey man I'm not going to I'm not
[1:51:17] going to eat anything unclean he said
[1:51:18] don't you start calling
[1:51:21] unclean what I have cleansed and he went
[1:51:24] down and preached the gospel to him the
[1:51:26] Bible said while he yet spake these
[1:51:30] words come on not while he had an alter
[1:51:33] call and and y'all know me I believe in
[1:51:35] alter Calla but it wasn't while the
[1:51:38] elders laid hands upon them it wasn't in
[1:51:40] the middle of the prayer line it wasn't
[1:51:43] at the altar but the Bible said while he
[1:51:45] yet spake these words that the Holy
[1:51:48] Ghost fell upon them
[1:51:55] God has ordained man for this purpose
[1:51:58] and he never changed
[1:52:00] it I'm reading direct quotes he never
[1:52:04] ordained
[1:52:05] denominations he never ordained groups
[1:52:08] of men he ordained men to preach the
[1:52:11] gospel not
[1:52:13] Machinery not Mechanical Devices or
[1:52:16] Angelic
[1:52:17] beings it it's a man
[1:52:22] so what is what is the offices of God in
[1:52:26] this
[1:52:27] church it's God's dress
[1:52:31] wear it's God he gets dressed up inside
[1:52:35] an apostle a prophet a Seer Satan gets
[1:52:38] to it done told it what is it God
[1:52:40] dressed up in the church these offices
[1:52:44] is his dress wear and when you see the
[1:52:46] office of a pastor or a teacher or an
[1:52:48] evangelist what is it that's God's dress
[1:52:51] wear God God's presence God's spirit
[1:52:56] working through that man listen let me
[1:52:58] can I can I just say it to you like this
[1:53:00] God unzips a
[1:53:05] man and he gets in
[1:53:09] him and then he Zips it back
[1:53:12] up and God puts on a tie and then he
[1:53:16] starts speaking through a man's mind and
[1:53:18] an anointing comes and he starts
[1:53:20] preaching things and you you think it's
[1:53:23] just a man but it's God dressed up in a
[1:53:27] body God is still speaking in this
[1:53:30] generation that we live God didn't
[1:53:34] die but God still speaks to man through
[1:53:41] man now you might say to me tonight you
[1:53:43] say well preacher you preached A good
[1:53:45] sermon it's not true Pastor you preached
[1:53:48] A good sermon it's not true brother B
[1:53:51] said he's speaking Holy Spirit speaks
[1:53:53] through mortal lips and he said these
[1:53:55] ministers and Brethren here he said you
[1:53:58] never preached a sermon in your
[1:54:00] life the Holy Spirit preached through
[1:54:03] you a sermon We Don't Preach the Holy
[1:54:06] Spirit does the
[1:54:07] speaking you might read something write
[1:54:10] it out and read it but preaching is when
[1:54:12] inspiration comes and preached by
[1:54:15] inspiration the holy spirit gives
[1:54:17] unction we can read something but it
[1:54:20] don't matter but when the Holy Spirit
[1:54:22] takes a hold of people something takes a
[1:54:24] hold that's not your pastor preaching
[1:54:28] that's the Holy Spirit
[1:54:32] preaching God is transmitting his
[1:54:38] voice I want to hear from God God is
[1:54:41] transmitting his voice through

[1:56:25] greatest truth that has ever struck the
[1:56:27] Earth the seals that have been sealed
[1:56:30] from the foundation of the world truths
[1:56:32] that nobody has ever heard in their
[1:56:35] lives and God's going to reveal that and
[1:56:38] we ain't supposed to preach
[1:56:40] it but this ministry of the end time is
[1:56:43] a final voice to a final age and they
[1:56:45] become the messengers of God with the
[1:56:48] same message that they have heard and
[1:56:51] become a channel to speak the word of
[1:56:53] God they become not just preachers but
[1:56:55] they become conduits for the message of
[1:56:58] the hour we have been anointed to preach

[1:57:43] preacher isn't that
[1:57:47] something God could have done it any way

[2:06:55] somebody to preach the gospel and to
[2:06:59] bring the word to
[2:07:00] you
[2:07:06] amen there are many
[2:07:10] errors that happen among the message
[2:07:15] rank some of the Elder fought good after
[2:07:20] a while the air
[2:07:23] or they made some statement that were
[2:07:26] contrary to the word of
[2:07:30] God instead of staying to the
[2:07:33] word a door open
[2:07:36] up where we got Forum we got group chats
[2:07:41] online on Facebook on Instagram on many
[2:07:46] platform where people talk about
[2:07:49] preachers very lightly all over the
[2:07:51] message all over the world that's right
[2:07:55] I'm saying what God put in my heart and
[2:07:58] I have to say it amen amen so it become
[2:08:02] easy you will see even young people
[2:08:03] sitting and they just talk about
[2:08:06] preachers until the respect of the
[2:08:09] ministry went completely down and the
[2:08:12] people feel like they
[2:08:14] entitle Amen to speak
[2:08:17] about a pastor or somebody and sometime
[2:08:20] you don't even know the
[2:08:23] story and the scripture say you should
[2:08:26] never take an
[2:08:28] accusation against an elder without how
[2:08:32] many witness two or three witness in
[2:08:35] other word if you hear something about a
[2:08:38] pastor you should not believe it am amen
[2:08:43] until you got witness amen and the Bible
[2:08:46] never stop there the Bible say and those
[2:08:48] witness must be proven amen
[2:08:53] am amen am and you will find yourself in
[2:08:56] a big
[2:08:58] trouble when you hear two three years
[2:09:00] later on the true version of the story
[2:09:03] and it was completely different than
[2:09:06] what you hear there are things that I
[2:09:09] will go to heaven with
[2:09:11] it even my wife would not know and this
[2:09:15] God built me since I was a deacon my
[2:09:17] wife is there I never came home and then
[2:09:20] tell my wife what we spoke in the Deacon
[2:09:22] office my wife is there never my wife
[2:09:25] could hear some something from somebody
[2:09:28] and ask me and I say who told you that
[2:09:30] because I know it I don't even tell you
[2:09:33] amen so there are things that I will go
[2:09:35] to heaven with
[2:09:36] it I'm not saying I'm going to die with
[2:09:39] it because there is a promise that not
[2:09:41] everybody will
[2:09:45] die amen I will go to heaven with it so
[2:09:49] no matter how much you want me to prove
[2:09:51] something there are certain things
[2:09:53] because I'm a pastor I will never open
[2:09:56] that to
[2:09:58] you amen and because I do not open that
[2:10:02] to you you will never know the true
[2:10:04] story about something I'm going to take
[2:10:07] a simple example if it's brother Charles
[2:10:10] tells me something and I know exactly
[2:10:12] what it is and you see brother Charles
[2:10:13] misbehaving he can misbehave all he want
[2:10:17] he knows that I'm not going to say it
[2:10:19] because I'm under commission as a Pastor
[2:10:21] to keep it and as long as I don't say it
[2:10:24] you will never know the truth unless
[2:10:26] brother Charles repent and tell you that
[2:10:28] brother Sten brother Wayne was correct
[2:10:31] because if I speak it I'm breaking like
[2:10:33] a covenant that I have with God so the
[2:10:37] reason why I'm saying that is regardless
[2:10:39] of how much you're going to heal be
[2:10:41] careful you don't know the full story
[2:10:45] you're going to judge a man of God
[2:10:47] you're going to temper into something
[2:10:48] that you don't know what I will
[2:10:50] encourage the church as always I remind
[2:10:53] you of every Sunday put your head in the
[2:10:57] word I went to a reception and I got
[2:11:00] there and I saw people and they asked me
[2:11:01] they say did you hear what happened over
[2:11:03] there I say I don't know they say really
[2:11:06] I said I don't know I said my mind I
[2:11:09] mean I need even time to read brother
[2:11:11] Bram I don't know what time do you have
[2:11:13] to be listening to everything that is
[2:11:15] going on I say I don't know they asked
[2:11:17] my wife my wife say we don't
[2:11:19] know in the word I keep my head focused
[2:11:24] on the word that's why you begin that's
[2:11:26] when you begin to see things in the
[2:11:28] scripture that other people probably
[2:11:30] don't see because you keep yourself line
[2:11:32] up into the word if somebody calls you
[2:11:35] and begin to talk about a preacher push
[2:11:37] a break tell him hey slow down and not
[2:11:41] only preacher even one
[2:11:43] another because we are God's children
[2:11:46] amen you don't know what preachers
[2:11:49] suffer to bring the word of God here
[2:11:51] you'll be sleeping snoring the preacher
[2:11:53] can't sleep 3:00 a.m. in the morning
[2:11:55] they got to wake up they got to stay
[2:11:56] away from their family away from their
[2:11:59] children I mean cooked up in the room
[2:12:01] somewhere just trying to get the mind of
[2:12:03] God be
[2:12:04] careful if they put you here you don't
[2:12:07] know what it takes you say they're
[2:12:08] sweating come here and you feel what we
[2:12:10] feeling when we are here it takes the
[2:12:13] grace of God to even stand here to talk
[2:12:15] to you we are
[2:12:16] unworthy to be talking to you we are
[2:12:19] completely unworthy to be talking to you
[2:12:21] you get here you do the best that you
[2:12:23] can you say God at least help me to say
[2:12:26] exactly what you want to say because I
[2:12:28] don't want to be held
[2:12:30] accountable and the day you want to
[2:12:32] preach you will see how much the devil
[2:12:34] is fighting left and right we already
[2:12:36] got used to that so Church stay with the
[2:12:39] word appreciate the ministry appreciate
[2:12:41] those that God bring here the brothers
[2:12:44] here sisters Church appreciate and stay
[2:12:47] focused stay away from hearing this and
[2:12:49] there commenting this and sitting there
[2:12:52] in dinner and go over you know this you
[2:12:55] know this you don't know what's going on
[2:12:57] when we meet with preacher we can talk
[2:12:59] between us and we can tell one another
[2:13:01] look at this look at this look at this
[2:13:03] and it finish between the preacher and
[2:13:05] we move forward everybody got it God
[2:13:08] cannot speak the way he spoke here for
[2:13:12] nothing the rain will never come back
[2:13:14] without our watering something amen amen
[2:13:18] amen we are most privileged and you are
[2:13:20] here to preach the gospel you might be a
[2:13:23] lady not to preach on a Pulpit but your
[2:13:25] life is a gospel amen Amen brother Wayne
[2:13:30] did I tell you to talk about Steven
[2:13:32] here so I'm saying that to remove some
[2:13:35] of the cloud
[2:13:37] away amen he feel led I never tell a
[2:13:40] preacher what to preach here because I
[2:13:43] know you are instructed you've been
[2:13:45] taught in the word let the preacher give
[2:13:48] them Liberty and let the Holy Spirit
[2:13:49] take over and we always get blessed over
