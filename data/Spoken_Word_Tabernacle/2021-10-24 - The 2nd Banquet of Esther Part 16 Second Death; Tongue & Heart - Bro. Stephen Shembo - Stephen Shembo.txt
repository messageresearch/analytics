it's a big responsibility it's good to be a boy good to be a man but he goes with a lot of responsibility and the society that we have is shifting things into a different way like 50 50 50 50. that's not correct we already told you about it that is not correct and sometimes the woman take the lead and goes way up and the man is relaxing over there that is completely contrary to the word of god

can get the trustee's wife or somebody there that's going to be sitting there to help you if you have if we can't understand your language talk to them let's talk let's sit down and say the certain things where no boys are there is it in order i have a quote everybody don't start trembling amen if you're not ready yet stay quiet stay in your home eating food mommy cook and everything don't seek for trouble paul say i spared you do you remember that paul said i trust i i spared you because you're gonna have trouble right you don't want to trouble mommy's still cooking daddy still take care of you stay home but if you want to get there let's sit down and begin to talk because i don't want somebody say we were not trained because some of the stuff you do you just do it because you don't know we thought you know but you don't know so i can bring the hammer and bid on you what we have not showed you first what is the correct way amen we cannot put a pressure on the laity to pull blood out of them when there is no blood in other words we can't pull blood out of a turnip you didn't put the holy ghost there you asked them to grieve the holy ghost which holy ghost are they going to bring it to you get them the holy ghost they will bring you the holy ghost amen some of the stuff you didn't know some people grew a certain way some people grew up with to the best that their parents knew but now let's sit together as a family and let's talk amen so don't get there trying to impress me you're wasting your time don't impress me because if you impress me i would know that oh you know everything praise god go ahead before you know it today lost on the highway and i'm gonna come back and then pull you with a tall car and take you home and sit down and begin to talk to you over again amen so don't try to impress me just be you if you impress no problem the showdown will come you're going to blow up don't impress me just be normal say brother stephen i have an anger then we can talk with it brother stephen i am nervous no problem let's talk about it amen but stephen i spend money like i can't get control of that when you get to my hand i got holes amen let's sit down and let's talk about it hallelujah don't worry you're going to like me later [Laughter] let's go to the book of proverbs you asked for i believe it was a request but i felt like it's time yeah so the normal monthly meeting will be there every month question and answer no problem so this is just special we sit down we talk like man amen amen yes you don't open the door for your fiance when you're coding here and when you're in a marriage forget about it why did you even start opening the door the woman carrying the car seat and you there moving your suit try the car seat one time you're not ready stay home and the one who's single the one who's not married worry for the things of the lord how to please god the best husband the best sister never to disappoint you he always understands you stay there that's the best that's what paul said that is the best and paul stop he said but we have different callings so if you want to add somebody in your life fine now understand you're not adding you oh my god it's coming [Laughter] oh my god do you think it's easy to stay 40 years in marriage you bat's head with your father your bad heads with mama wait till you get the right one you will love mama let's go to proverbs 4. she's not like my mother you didn't get married to your mother [Music] when i was talking my dad you always say yes yes yes this is not daddy you say left he said right it's interesting right let me pull that gun back [Laughter] let's go to proverbs chapter 4. you see the adult saying amen they wish they had time meeting like what we're trying to do they wish they didn't get that they have to read their own books and read and read and read and sometimes they fall into the wrong stuff proverbs chapter 4 verse 23 we labor with this a lot in the old church but it looks like the boss wants me to go that route keep your water with all keep your heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of what you might be seated solomon open up here to keep our heart i know the last couple weeks when we were talking the emphasize was put on the tongue refrain the tongue refrain the tongue keep the tongue keep the tongue now solomon is going beyond what we can see because when we talk we can see our tongue somebody you can look at somebody talking you can see their teeth you can see their tongue now solomon goes beyond what you can see and solomon say take care of the heart what is wrong with the heart solomon say out of the heart are the issues of life so the things that you see in life the things that you see that you witness or the course of the event in your life according to solomon they are all originating they originate from where from the heart life and death in the power of god so if your life is in trouble who did it the tongue solomon say the heart is are they contradicting watch verse 24 put away from you a water do you see where solomon start solomon start first at the heart amen he said guard this man then from the heart which is number one solomon move to the mouth or to the tongue we already understand this now mouth tongue lips all these things amen solomon say on verse 24 put away from you a forward mouth and perverse water put far from you so who command is the lips speaking really or it's the heart talking amen if i take your tongue i put it there is he going to talk so who's really talking anybody clear let's go to mark 7. blessed be the name of the lord with everything that we have we should be having the lowest case of divorce in the message with the word that we have amen mark chapter 7 if you dare you can say amen verse 6. he answered and said to them well has isaiah prophesies of you who hypocrite as it is written these people honor me with their so a hypocrite has a problem a hypocrite say something else with his lips or mouth or tongue amen these people honors me with their lips but that's a contradiction there their water is far from who so the heart of a hypocrite says something else amen and his tongue is also saying something else so there is no continuity between the heart and the tongue anybody clear in other words i love you but really i hate you but what hypocrites don't understand is the issues of life comes from the water so regardless of how much they can talk amen their heart sense vibrations their heart creates a milky atmosphere amen that if a person is spiritual that's what they're catching and sometimes when they naive they will say lord i don't want to think bad about them i'm sorry you didn't decode that [Music] [Laughter] it's time to eat chew to chew hard food let's go to verse 15. there is nothing from outside a man that entering into him can do what or can make him unclean it's not about the food it can cause you problem with your cholesterol or something like that but it's not really in front of god that's not it amen except if you go beyond what you're supposed to eat then you sin amen that entering into him can defile him but the things which come out of who those are they that defile the man not the food that enter make you unclean but it is what is coming out of you that makes you unclean if any man have ears to hear let him hear and when he was entered into the house from the people his disciple asked him concerning the parable we didn't understand that and he said to them are you so without understanding also do you not water in other words do you not understand that whatsoever things from outside enter into the man he cannot defile him because he entered not into the water make sense in other words your food doesn't go in the heart your food goes to the stomach amen biology besides because he entered not into his heart but into the water and goes out into the drought purging all meat that's your digestive system that have nothing to do with it and he said that which come out of the man that defiles the man for from inside which inside from inside out of the water the heart of a man proceed water evil thoughts adulteries fornications murderers theft covetousness wickedness deceit lasciviousness an evil eye blasphemy pride foolishness all these evil things come from water and default the water so now you understand why solomon is saying keep your heart because this is the one that caused you trouble the mouth is just expressing what is coming under anybody clear praise be the name of the lord let's go to mark 11. you're talking about the heart and the tongue we talk about the tongue and the hell the tongue and the power now we're talking about the tongue and the heart anybody clear mark chapter 11 if you dare you can say amen some are still turning their pages you're there verse 12. and on the morrow they were come from bethany he was hungry that's jesus and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves he came if happily in other words perhaps he might find anything there on and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves we already talked to you about it for the time of fig was not yet why did he go at the time when figs were not there he got to curse that thing from eating amen and jesus answered and said to it in my name are you awake if you're sleeping i'm wondering no man eat fruit of you here after forever and his disciple heard it was that hard to talk was that hard you just turn around you say hey no man will eat food then he continues and nothing happened but something happened nothing happened to the eye but something happened jesus never stood there and said i'm going to sleep here until i see this tree falling down that's not his problem amen verse 19. and when the evening was gone what was come he went out of the city he finished what he did he went to the city they never even heard him talking about that tree like peter go ahead and check again the tree that i talked about he he spoke and he forgot and he continued his daily life when he finished he went out of the city and in the morning now the next day as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the what see now okay and peter peter is a problem calling to remembrance say to him master behold the fig tree which you cursed is withered away and jesus answering said to them have faith in god for verily i say to you that whosoever shall say to this water how can you move from a tree to a mountain a tree is small everybody can believe that so jesus take you to the stream to blow up to get you out of the box to get you to a different height what you really look and you say this is too big wow look at this mountain jesus say forget about the tree look at that mountain there that whatsoever shall say to this mountain be that removed and be that cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his jesus is saying if you go in two right and if you handle number two okay and you don't doubt in number one that mountain will move so who is really moving the mountain out of the heart come the issues of life so their heart can move something really yes if you don't really like somebody you don't even have to tell him if you really mean it the problem is you must mean it if you don't mean it then it's a different story amen if you take a decision in your life for something it depends on how you're taking decision if you really took decision on something even if that person is in europe he will understand it you don't understand it yet let me help you up again if you at your house okay in your home and you take a decision really you mean that decision and if you're taking a decision for brother robert brother robert will know that you took a decision let me help you up again brother branham says if he goes somewhere out yes and he forgot his nice pocket amen do you hear me do you hear me brother branham said if he just stand where he is far away from his home if he can really believe that knife will move home and begin to travel without an airplane and get into brother branham pocket and brother branham will reach out to the pocket and pull the knife it is not magic what you call magician they are impersonator [Music] it's a perversion did i lose somebody have you ever sat somewhere and you talking to someone [Laughter] and suddenly you will see your head move and when you move you watch somebody there long way back is watching you have you seen that before have you seen that before who told you that person is watching you who was the radar that was around there going and then goes there and take your head and when you turn and as soon as you see that person you will see them how did you communicate how what was the telephone did you text him texting is a copy amen how can you come out of the bathroom and you meet a young man and you shake his hand god bless you god bless you fine and you go wednesday you meet him but let that young man begin to think different about you you know what i'm talking about right right if he comes again and shake your head you wouldn't know this man is there's something funny about him now who told you that and before you know it when you see him this way you go that way when you see daddy you should go mommy i love you so much you just want him to go away who taught you he's thinking about you let me go back and shall not doubt in his heart but shall do what believe that those things which he shall say come to pass he shall have whatsoever he says therefore i say to you what things so ever you desire when you believe that you did water and you shall [Music] if you don't have it it means water you have not believed you have not you have not amen don't worry we'll be okay let's go ahead and pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you for giving us another opportunity to gather together around the reveal world of the hour father i'm rebuking every demonic spirit of destruction of sleepiness everything that is trying to trouble the mind of your children not to focus to the word i rebuke them away from this place to the dry places in the name of jesus christ father may you come and speak to us so may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to this church and minister to us be the alpha and the omega the beginning and the ending of this service as we committed all unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you all in 1st peter chapter 3 last week and the week before we read for he that we love life and see good days let him do water refrain his strong from water and he sleeps that they speak no water you want to see good days you're going to love life avoid the headache amen we are here on part 16 the second death we're talking about the tongue and the heart before we go into the lake of fire everybody clear so far when we talk about this rich young ruler we saw the rich young ruler in hell and when we saw him in hell the rich young ruler pointed out to us one spot that was burning more than any other spot that was the tongue now we know what goes in hell is not the body of a man what goes in hell is the spirit and the soul of a man put your belt because i'm going to travel a different avenue anybody clear the bible say in ecclesiastes 12 7 then shall the dust return to the earth as it was the dust here is your body because the body is made out of the earth the 16th element of the earth so the scripture here is saying that your body will return to the earth that's why we take the body to the cemetery and we bury it there but eventually it's going to return back to the earth and the spirit shall return unto whom unto god who gave it so when you die your body goes somewhere else but your spirit picks up and go to a different place anybody clear in luke chapter 23 verse 46 the bible said that when jesus had cry with a loud voice he said father into the hand i command what and having said that he gave up though because the spirit goes to whom but not all spirit goes to god but here it depends on the origin it depends where you come from if you came from god you're gonna return back to god if you didn't come from god then your spirit will go into a different place anybody clear in first peter chapter 3 verse 19 by which we also by which also he went and preached unto the water the spirit in water and that prison is hell ever clear for us the body without the water the spirit is water we know that man is a trying being we are body we are spirit and we are soul and here when you look here all this scripture are talking about the spirit none of them is talking about the souls everybody and james here is saying that the body without the water the spirit is dead why is james not talking about the soul anybody clear i told you to keep your seat belt blessed be the name of the lord in psalm chapter 16 verse 10 david said for thou will not leave my water my soul in water so james is talking about what happened when you're alive anybody care but when you depart from your body david picks it up and begin to talk more about the soul hallelujah amen neither will that suffer than holy one to see corruption for great psalm 86 for great is that mercy toward me and that has delivered my water my soul from the lowest health anybody clear in first kings chapter 17 verse 21 the bible said and he stretched himself upon the child three times the child was dead and cry unto the lord and say o lord my god i pray thee let this child water come think to him again why he didn't call his spirit and the lord heard the voice of elijah and the soul of the child came into him again and he revived anybody when it's living we have a tendency to say spirit when he dies then the soul picks it up anybody clear in revelation 6 verse 9 the bible said and when he has opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the water anybody clear the bible say in the book of first peter that he was the spirit in prison but when brother branham comes and one brother branham preaches brother branham called that the souls in prison are you there when you are leaving everybody here we have the body which is the outside then we have your spirit and back here then the inside of the inside is what we call the soul anybody care this body that you enter in when you are born when you enter into your body your body was designed as a computer everybody clear if your body was designed with the element to contact the earth anybody care anybody clear when a person leaves their body they can be standing right there but if they touch you you don't feel it do you follow me the only way you can make contact with them they need to go back again into the body anybody clear so when you really enter the body of a man there is two spots in the body that are very important the first one is the brain and the second one is the heart anybody clear so when you're coming from the lord and you enter the body your spirit in the body usually take the first place i'm are you following me are you following me are you following me your body what he does he gather information for you but the body cannot process your information anybody clear if you take a computer you put it here you can put a computer here as much as you want that computer will do nothing to you anybody here you must take that computer and plug it to the wall did you follow me then something will come from the wall that is called electricity do you follow me and that electricity enter into the computer ever here and begin to turn on the computer on the day you cut off the electricity the computer is dead [Music] do you follow me the computer without power is dead the body without the spirit is dead the power that moves your body is your spirit do you follow me so when your spirit enter the body will look and say i see a man that is sitting there that wear a suit and he have a tie and he's a caucasian and he has beard and everything that's what your body pulled and your body bring it and leave it there then your spirit enter and work on it say he's like this his name is brother abel the body cannot tell you it's variable the one who reasoned the one who decoded the one who understand who work on the information is your spirit so your intelligence is not in your brain are you there the brain is just the software the brain is a hardware that the power must enter and begin to use the material day when you die you will withdraw completely and everything that is there will be destroyed do you follow me so when you enter into your body when you are born your spirit take the lead do you follow me quick is everybody okay and your soul take the second place did you follow me so when you entering you coming from god when these two elements enter the body the spirit take over your brain and your soul take over your heart everybody here so the one that functioned a lot that make a lot of contact with the body is your spirit because he's the one doing the reasoning he's the one doing the affection he's the one working with the conscience here the body have five senses and the spirit also have five senses that's why they're both matches but the soul doesn't have five senses are we okay if you're sleeping you can stand up back there everybody so when you are still living your soul is usually your back part anybody care so a human being has a tendency to work with his spirit this spirit here is what solomon called understanding everybody clear that understanding is the center of your intelligence that's why solomon say lean not unto their own anybody here everybody here everybody here but when you die you follow me when you die paul says when this tabernacle is dissolved we have a different tabernacle that is coming up everybody here that tabernacle that comes is called a theophany we okay when that your family comes ever clear the leadership is no longer to your spirit anybody here that your family which is that spiritual body ever hear your soul take over the theophany in your natural body your spirit is first and your theopha annual and your soul is in the back but when you enter your theophany the soul take the leadership hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord brother branham said the difference between an animal and a man god put a soul in a man and he didn't put it in the animal because they saw that was in the man is that water how can a soul be a theophany theophany is a body soul is a part of you but brother branham said that so is that theophany in question and answer on hebrew brother branham say his body was in there that's jesus and his son was in water preaching alive what about that he was in his water in his theophany again he saw everybody clear was down there with those people that were in the theophany also so in the theophany the soul take over that's why when a sinner wants to die you're gonna hear him say i am lost what is speaking is no longer his spirit it is the soul that he grieves is taking over because he's going to a theophany anybody clear who is this merchandise after you recognize the very word of god was ego food then you left the other things you have been formed into the living image of the water you heard from your water the wonder heard is not your intellect it is the that soul have a communication with your theophany [Music] anybody here so when the rich young ruler went to hell and was talking it was his soul that was talking and he saw pointing out to us the tonga anybody clear so far praise be to the name of the lord now that in james chapter 1 we found out that if any man among you seems to be religious and brother not his water he but deceiveth his own water why is the connection between the two because the heart that's where the soul stays hey this man religion is water then blessed be the name of the lord the bible says in proverbs 21 23 who saw keeping his water and his water keep his water we okay now you okay now what was the witch young ruler talking that he was burning in hell everybody clear so now we see that there is a connection between the tongue and the soul or the heart anybody clear what is going on with the heart blessed be the name of the lord in proverbs 21 verse 2 the bible says every way of who amen is right in his own eyes but the lord pondered the water let me go back again every way of a man is right in his own eyes man is a big trouble anybody care everything that a human being does it is good for him anybody care anybody here everybody here everything that man does the way man was wired the way man was built whatever he does it's good everybody here that's why we have trouble a high opinionated man is a curse opinion that woman is a curse anybody here a proud spirit is a curse everybody because the way man was wired everything he does is correct that's why we have stubborn children that's why we have stubborn father we have stubborn wives we have stubborn husband because everything they do is right if you tell a child don't put your hand in a fire they don't get it you don't understand why they're getting why they don't get it because what he does is correct if you put water over there and a lot of mud there you let the little child go the child will go and jump on a mud when an adult look he said don't do that he said why that's not fair why because everything he does to his own eyes his water you see why you gotta die you see why you gotta die you see why you gotta die mama say something no i know what i'm doing daddy said something no i know what i'm doing this is my life nobody can tell me what to do i can choose what i'm doing if everything you do is right why are you in this condition you are you posted facebook picture facebook picture facebook picture facebook picture for three years no husband did you stop did you stop because what you do is right in your eyes and guess what you keep changing you keep changing you keep changing take first corinthians 13. it is not me it's your boss [Laughter] hallelujah this is why people have a hard time changing it takes 10 years for you to realize that your wife was right it takes five years for you to realize that your husband was right you must go through a lot of headache to realize that the pastor was right everything that man does in his own eyes is water let's go to first corinthians 13. hallelujah the tongue and the heart everybody clear first corinthians 13 verse 11. amen we have a lot of pharaohs egypt to destroy egypt destroy egypt destroy still he's stubborn you spend five years you wasted and you're still insisting on what you're doing don't you see egypt is destroyed no first corinthians chapter 13 verse 11. are you there when i was a water i spoke as water and i understood as what i thought as a what there is three words there paul say when i was a child i did what speak spoke which is talking about what the month everybody clear then i did water you understand where i understand with my heart and the first and the third one is what thinking what do you think you're reasoning baby your heart baby you're talking baby and when they try to correct you i know what i'm doing hallelujah but when i became a worker i put a white water so if you didn't listen to mama how many mistakes you gonna make if you didn't listen to daddy how many mistake are you making because daddy was dead daddy made the same mistake and that is telling you don't do it it's gonna be hard for you to understand daddy because the way you are wired everything that you do is right you must understand this so you can break yourself and begin to open your ear to begin to be subordinate to someone else hallelujah the bible says in luke chapter 2 52 and jesus increase in water why didn't jesus preach before 30 years old i'm asking you a question why did jesus why didn't jesus preach before he was 30 years old the only time we encountered something he was 12 years old when the black dog opened up all he did he corrected by the word but he has to wait until the jordan eva do you follow me when the holy ghost enter into him then jesus started the ministry everybody here so far the bible said he grew increasing wisdom the heart and stature the normal body in favor with god and with who it didn't happen the same day in john chapter 8 verse 28 then jesus said unto them when you have lift up the son of man then shall you know that i am who and i do nothing of water has done what i speak this water i do nothing i have to wait for him because everything that i do is going to be right in my eyes hallelujah and he that sent me is with me the father has not left me alone for i do what does prince that do what father not my but what his will let this cup passed away it is right because i don't want to go through suffering but the father will you must go through this trial because the whole race of adam need to be john chapter 1 verse 3 and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we kept his water and do those things that are water pleasing in which cycle who are you trying to please who are you pleasing galatians 1 chapter 10 4 do i now persuade man oh god there's two masters there who are you persuading on your facebook god so when you put a picture you are saying god i'm putting up this picture so you can see how i am today god i'm gonna post this video so you're gonna see how i was dancing at home who are you pleasing who are you pleasing who are you pleasing who are you pleasing because you're waiting for that like like a like waiting for somebody to say it is beautiful you look gorgeous everything that you do in your own eyes persuade men of god or do i seek to please who for if i yet please man i should not be the servant of water are you servant of christ who are you pleasing who are you pleasing you're not fooling me every way of a man is righteous in his in his own eye but the lord pondered the water god is looking at the motive everybody here in the exposition of the seven churches brother branham said the name laodicea which means what notice the name laodicea means what people's right or what this age is prone to give you a high opinion of yourself it is an edge that gives you right this is my right you don't listen to nobody nobody can tell you something hallelujah jeremiah 10 verse 22 oh lord i know that the water the way of who every way of man is water but the way of man is water so even though you are programmed even though you are created that everything that you do is right the purpose of god was not for that do you follow me the purpose of god it is not in man that worketh to direct his water man was made to be dependent on the higher power hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord jesus said abide in me and i in you as the brunch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye accept he abiding me i am divine ye are the branches he that abided me and i in him the same bringeth forth much water for without me he can do so the way you were brought in this world everything you do correct in your eyes but god is speaking through jeremiah that you are not supposed to be directed yourself you are supposed to be depending on order everybody clear everybody clear so far blessed be the name of the lord how can we get to that order the bible says that the brother branham said you say the church has to go through the persecution the church for the perfection of it the blood of jesus christ perfected the water there is a difference between the church and the bride the church goes to the tribulation not the blood because he has perfected us on calvary a man who chooses a wife don't put her through a lot of punishment he's already found grace too with her she has found grace with him he engages to her and if there is anything he shall keep her from every place to turn her hand his grace is so great upon them so will it be upon the bread and so is it on the brand we are worthy creatures deserving of hell but his grace holds us through it look at how many people lost and blind how many how many sinners was there in the world the hour i got saved god saved me for a water god served me for a purpose and i am determined by his will to do that i don't care what anything else goes i want to do it so the purpose of god to perfect you to serve you to redeem you to rescue you is for a purpose what is that purpose that god is trying to get you let's go to james chapter three why does god want to rescue you what is that purpose you were born everything you do right we need to humble ourselves and we need to be mindful of our weaknesses recognize the strength in your husband recognize the strength in your wife recognize the strength in your children recognize the strength in your parent james chapter 3 verse 7 he saved me for a purpose everybody you there verse 7 for every kind of water and off and of serpent and of things in the sea is and has been tame of water man had the dominion of everything he controlled they see he controlled the animal kingdom he control the bird he controls everything everything that man does he can claim it and control it everything is working perfect thank god verse eight but the water he saved you for a purpose but the tongue can water do you have control over your tongue no you cannot control it you need somebody else it makes sense but the tongue can no maintain it is a water an unruly evil full of deadly water but solomon said what is in the tongue really comes from the heart hallelujah verse nine dare with we bless god even the father and dare with because we men which are made after the similitude of god in other words in the image and likeness of god out of the same mouth proceeded what and what my breath and these things are not so to be he saves you for a purpose does a fountain send forth us at the same place sweet water and bitter can the fig tree my brethren bear all his berries either a vine figs so can no fountain both yield salt water and water so we found here james is saying man can control everything but man cannot control himself he can control the animal that's why we have the zoo because man master the lion and put him in a zoo he mastered the elephant put him in the zoo he mastered the serpent put him in the zoo he mastered the bird put him in a zoo but man cannot control himself he cannot control his mouth he cannot control his tongue he cannot control his heart so who's going to control everybody the bible's brother problem say christ died that cavalry how that he went up to that cross i was reading a little book here not long ago that onto some kind of a research and in this research i found something more startling i sat down and i laid the book down and raised up my hands and praised god got up and walked around a little bit and sat down and read it again so brother branham got a hold of a research and when he was reading that research got brother branham on fire brother branham job the research he raised his hand he praised god he praised god he went back again pick up the research and read it again what was in that research brother bonham said i thought oh is that so that on this same hill where jesus was crucified adam died and was buried on the same hill that jesus died on and was buried on the same hill where adam died he died on golgotha and was buried on golgotha and i thought what appropriate whether he was right or wrong let's say he was right then the first adam died and was buried and there yet in the dust because he represented the water the world and the people to sin but the second adam being the god of heaven when he died on golgotha there was not enough earth to hold him there he rolls on the third dead and he's alive forever more but the sin problem is what where are them represented as of a day as soon jesus claimed on the same place and died right there to represented us as redeemed and served by the grace of god hallelujah he saved us for a purpose what is the purpose he saved me because i could not enter myself i could not control my tongue i could not control my mouth i could not control my lips i could not control my heart i needed a savior but thank god that savior came and crammed on god and gave his life to save me [Music] hallelujah when man was saved the veil of the temple was ripped into showing to man that now we can enter the presence of god and not only do you enter the presence of god but god himself can enter men hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord now on the day of pentecost the atonement went received in heaven then christ came and divided himself and sat like a pillar like tongues of fire and the first thing we did he did he entered anybody here as soon as he entered the heart the first member he catches is there [Music] are you there now paul please son of jesus christ [Music] i do nothing except today hallelujah and they were all filled with the holy ghost and begin to speak with other what he catches the heart he catches the tongue what is going on when he catches the heart brother bottom said the first throne was in water the judgment seat the second throne was in the third tron is in water [Music] so god is perfected in three so god finish his strand when he can empty man what is a man he's a trying being body soul and spirit how many knows that watch god approach watch god approach what is his heart you remember my message god chooses demands for his water the devil choses his water for his control tower he makes him see things look through his eyes but god in his heart make him believe things that he cannot everybody here god is on his heart in the heart of man is the throne of who you gathered man god made it strong in the heart of no man can tame the tongue there is only one man that there was no fault found in him so when he went up he came down entered the heart so he can control the tongue anybody clear anybody clear the little the reason that that little compartment that is in your heart god murdered you that way that was for uh that little part in your heart all the rest of your body belongs to him to you but that heart belongs to us [Music] gents say if i can control the tongue i'm going to control what brother branham said the body belongs to you but he want to get the heart because once he get the heart you're not even controlling the body anymore anybody clear but the heart belongs to god that god made himself a little room in there so he could set in the controlling and that he could do what because you were programmed not to leave for yourself anybody oh if i would let him beat the water and the water we will be guarded over the water it is his control so now when christ enter he already programmed a control room he get into the heart he sits there as a pilot go to james chapter 3 again let's go to verse 3. behold we put water in the horse's mouth remember last sunday when they put bits in beats on horse's mouth it means there is a carriage there is a load that is coming up there is a workforce that is coming up for the horse to carry so when jesus enter into you he also put beats on you he brother your tongue because he has something to do with you he has work that he have not finished he's going to finish it in the brother anybody clear now no more your will but the wheel off there everybody here behold we put bits in horse's mouth that they may obey us so you may obey us and we turn about their whole body behold also the sheep which though they be so great are driven a fierce wind yet our dead turnabout with a very small water so james is saying that there is a ship a big ship anybody clear in this ship there is a room where the pilot goes all the master goes anybody care in that little room there is a little helm in other words a steering wheel anybody care anybody clear but that will jim say that turn about with a very small ham verse four wherever they were the governor the governor is the pilot in other words wherever the pilot desire that's where the pilot works so james here is showing us that there is a boat that boat has a control room you follow you you follow me then that control room has a steering wheel but you need a pallet clear and brother branham said the pilot is crushed and he's going to move the plane or he's going to move the boat where he desire regardless of what the wind is doing outside you follow me you follow me even though the wind is big even though the wind is strong even though you feel like you are touched left and right let the pilot do the steering do you follow me one day the pilot slept here and he put the what in automatic pallets and when the devil saw that the devil came and began to ship to move the ship left and right instead of the disciple remembering that the pilot was there the disciple begin to do work instead of the disciple awakening him they begin to do work we were fishermen we know what to do so what do we do we have a lot of luggage throw the luggage out lost throw the luggage out lost throw the luggage out let's go this way let's go they're sweating and the pilot is sleeping he never walk and say what kind of noise is there let them keep doing what they're doing until they get tired he was just sleeping there and their work their work their work until they got tired one remember say wait a minute where is jesus are you there he's sleeping over there master wake up we're dying he walks we're perishing what's wrong look look what's going on they thought he's gonna look at that he just went peace be still are you there and suddenly if you have called him a long time would you have worry would you have lost what you lost how many luggage did you throw out how many headaches did you have in life how many troubles did you cause yourself how many things did you lose how many bad debts did you put yourself into that your credit is bad that your debt is high because you forgot to call on him are you there so peter so james is saying there is a pilot here all he needs is give him the steer don't worry about the wind he's going to move the plane hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord james says here in verse five even so that tongue is a little member and booster water behold how great a mother a little fire does what you started like a little fire before you know it they called the fire department anybody clear watch verse six and the tongue is a what why is the rich young ruler wanting to tame his tongue the tongue is a fire a water a cosmos of iniquity so is the tongue among our water that he defies the whole world but jesus said the one who defiled the body was there we okay now jesus said out of there now james say from there you see now that he defers the whole body and set on fire the water i thought solomon said the course of nature comes from the the issues of life we okay and set on fire the course of nature and is set on fire of what who set the tongue on fire the rich young ruler was where war was on fire and who set the tongue on fire hell everybody here but when you redeem it's a different story when god made man he made him dust for he made this little certain compartment in the man for his own throne his control tower god wants to lead men but man wants to lead himself therefore there is a water constantly the man wants to go after what he sees with his eyes that is where he is deceived that is what satan deceived by what she could see the fruit was present today but it was death to the what god want to lead man so he made himself a little contact control tower in the midst of his heart so that man will be led by the water getting off on his own is what separated him from his water ever here god doesn't want you to lead yourself in revelation 10 we found out that the bible said and when i went to into the angel i said to him give me the little book you remember last sunday and he said unto me take it and do it not only take the book because you are worthy now but when you take the book to what why do you eat it in school i had a classmate in high school and he was cheating anybody care and you know back in the days when we were cheating when the the students were cheating before they tested the exam they would take little papers and write stuff on the paper and keep the paper so when the test started they pulled the paper and began to cheat so the teacher was there in the front and the teacher saw him and he said hey you that stop you teach you you are cheating so the teacher was coming to get the evidence do you follow me off the little paper in order to get him and to give him a zero do you follow me my friend stood and took the pepper and folded the pepper and put it in his mouth and eat it and swallow it are you there the evidence was gone in other words there is no more that the teacher can get the paper out of his belly because the book was in the hands of adam when adam sinned the book was taken out of adam and brought into heaven so now this time in revelation 10 when god brought the book don't keep it in your hand swallow the book [Applause] swallow the book when you swallow it you and the book are one even god cannot pull the book from you again when you move the book move when you jump the book jump when won the book one you and the book are water [Applause] hallelujah there is nowhere again that the book can leave you and go back to the original serum that was in adam in christ it's forever the book is in the bread digested there is no way you can put the book again hallelujah the bible says eat it up [Music] no more coming and say give the book because you sin when god come he said give me the book you say which book the book i gave it to you go ask the one on calvary the book is already blood it had been digested enter into my bloodstream so i don't know which part of the bread the blood is your book if you want to take the book there is one way you must take me too [Applause] are you there you must take me to your right hand again you can't pull the book without pulling me hallelujah he said eat it up and he shall make the water not this belly the belly be there but it shall be in the mouth what so the book is making contact in two area it's making a contact in the mouth and a contact anybody care in the mouth it's sweet as honey i took the little book out of the angel hand and head it up the angel have no more book he's going to go back to heaven empty because to begin with it was not his book it was given to men now it's back to man again never to be lost again [Music] hallelujah and he was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i added my belly was water and he said unto me damn much water why you didn't prophesy before you eat the book i want the book to touch your tongue and back here and then to go and sit in your heart when the book has purged your tongue and touch and sit in your heart because malachi 4 comes to return there everybody here now you can everybody clear the bible say all things happen brother branham said all things are possible to them that believe we got the untapped resources of god at our hand to display who we are sons and daughters of who when god made man he made him he gave him a dominion over the earth but his fallen state job but what they lost by he was restored by what he died on the same hill he said if you say to this water be moving don't doubt in you but believe what you say shall come you can have whatever you all thinks whatsoever you desire when you pray believe you receive it and you shall water he restored to us all that was lost in hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord brother branham says that he had a little book that john had eat to eat and when he did he got into his belly and he was bitter but in his lips it was sweet when you have to digest it then he gets against you everybody telling you you are holy roller you are decent doctor when you begin to have that sister charlene the book is getting digestion everybody here you are off your head so it is hard to digest it but when you are water of his glory it is what [Music] that's all when you stand up in a meeting you say glory to god the book is what hallelujah but then when you are out of that great siege you can testify often then it is sweet in your lips see that is right blessed be the name of the lord this issue with the book started from the old testament let me see where i am okay that word were found and i did eat them and that word was unto me the joy and the rejoicing of my for i am called by the name o lord god of host in ezekiel 2 god say but that son of man hear what i say unto thee be not that rebellious like that rebellious house open the mouth and eat that i give you and when i look beyond a hand was sent unto me and lo a roll of a book was therein and he spread it before me and he was written within and without and there was written during lamentation and mourning and so what the prophet was saying was what was in the book after they have eaten the book everybody ezekiel 3 moreover he said unto me son of man eat that darfundus eat this room and go speak unto the house of water so what the prophet was really speaking was not their thought it was what they have eaten i opened my mouth and he caused me to eat that room and he said unto me son of man cause that belly to eat and fill the bowels with this wall that i give you then i did eat it and it was in my mouth as honey for water and he said unto me son of man go get thee unto the house of israel and speak with my word unto we found out that prophecy was not given by the will of men the bible says that prophecy no prophecy of the scripture is of any prophet interpretation for the prophecy came not in the old time by the will of man it was not ezekiel who wanted to speak he was not jeremiah who wanted to speak god wanted to speak god took his word and put in the prophet and the prophet repeated what god say are you there for the prophecy came not in the old time by the will of man but holy men of god speak as they were moved by the water exodus 4 i'm heading to the airport and moses said unto the lord oh my lord i'm not eloquent neither he the toefl nor sins that has spoken unto that servant but i am slow of speech and slow of tongue and of slow tongue and the lord say unto him who has made man mouth and who maketh the dumb or death or the seeing or the plan have not i the lord now therefore go and i will be with that and teach thee what dasha so when the holy ghost enter into your heart he take a hold of what anybody care when the prophet was speaking they were not speaking with their own self somebody hold their mouth everybody clear blessed be the name of the lord but when they deliver you up did you deliver yourself who delivered you somebody what happened when somebody put pressure on you take no thought how and what you shall speak for it shall be given to you in that same hour what you shall want when you go to trial when you go to pressure when people begin to oppress you or to attack you are you there god also approaches do you follow me you need to learn [Applause] to relax in trouble are you there when the enemy comes like a flood the water the spirit of the lord so when somebody is attacking you god also is preparing himself do you follow me the problem is when we go through trial we get ourself in it then when god speaks we don't catch him are you there god is saying when you see a battle stand quiet are you there when you stand quiet you're gonna hear his instruction for that specific battle are you there somebody run against you don't get upset somebody spit on you don't get upset just relax the more you relax you're gonna hear a direct bullet coming up are you there that bullet is specific for what you're going through four it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father which speak in so when somebody attacks you god is trying to say move assad move asad movie sad he spit on me move assad be quiet move assad because you were defaulting you're gonna fall on my feet he was not brother branham talking he was not brother branham he was somebody talking through brother branham and the man fell there and never was delivered anymore crippled they pulled him outside without brother branham fighting are you there

but one day shall lead you and deliver you up take no thought beforehand what ye shall neither do you what tomorrow he will see don't do that don't do that don't do that are you there but whatsoever

never fought with pharaoh pharaoh was destroyed by water what israel was doing was dancing israel was just dancing let's pray heavenly father lord we again approaching you humbly this morning father thanking you for your grace for your love and for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father you opened the doors yourself where man was completely forbidden to enter into the presence of the lord father you put a flaming sword you block it with the caribbeans but you never stopped there because you knew there was a true atonement that was coming to take over lord father the burden that was on man lord you came down and you climbed the same hill that adam clam adam climbed onto that wheel hill and was buried lord but you came as our representation and you took our sins father you pay the debt and you open the way so that we can go back again to the presence of the lord father man everything that he does in his own eyes looks good but you came to give us a true and a perfect example of a lamb who is constantly depending on the dove father you never started even your ministry until the dolph came you waited for the dove to come and to lead you and that same dove led you all the way to calvary and that same dove came and pulled you out of the grave father lord jesus christ you are speaking to your children that now you are restoring back that power of the spoken word and father many times we have lived our own life resolving things by our own thinking our own reasoning our own abilities but lord you training your children because the hour is getting very tight you only take the squeeze lord father to pull out completely that third pull into its completeness lord and father you are training us lord father to begin to take our hands off the steering wheel off lord further our lives and to begin lord to relax and to understand that you never leave us nor even are you going to forsake us but you are always there to guide us and to lead us all the way until the end father may you help your children to realize lord that we are lambs because you are the lamb of god that we have been sent on this earth to depend unto the dwarf lord father your prophet even stated that the dove came the seventh dove came to lead the ego home lord and father that dove never stopped there but that dove is still with the brother and that dove is here to lead us and to guide us in every detail in our lives lord father may you help us relax may you help us lord father to begin lord to yield more and more to the holy spirit so that we can begin to receive instruction that can make our life successful that can make our our marriage successful that can make our career our businesses everything that we do successful lord and may we learn how to speak the right thing at the right moment under the right inspiration and the right anointing of the holy spirit and at that point it's not gonna be us speaking but it's gonna be the holy spirit talking and the holy spirit resolving the holy spirit healing the holy spirit doing everything and we're just gonna be as much as a servant as you were here when you were here on earth lord because your prophet told us lord that in the age of laodicea the age is no cold it is not even heart lord and because of that lukewarm situation lord father you spew them out of your mouth and your prophet explained to us that spewing them out of your mouth it means that they were no longer your mouth peace because now you're taking the bread to be your mouth's priest to speak again to prophesy again the second time father that's why you gave instruction not only to take the book but to take the book and eat it so that we can be one with the book and when we speak lord we will be speaking the word of eternal life that can bring peace to our family peace to our children peace to our people peace well father to our worker peace to everywhere we going lord and that can handle every single situation no matter what the devil is going to bring in our life father we thank you for giving us this time and this service we are committing the few words that were spoken unto the hand may the holy spirit continue to minister to your children lord as we ambly ask it father in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you church we love you [Music] hallelujah [Applause] [Music] glory to god
