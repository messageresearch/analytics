========================================

God bless you all and this is Brother Stephen chamble local pacifier in spoken word Tabernacle of Gastonia here in North Carolina in the United States this is an expo that we have done in uh about music and music has been such a treacherous subject very contradictory in the past until that we noticed that the music that the message Believers are listening to up to now got into the way that is swayed to the world there is no gauge there is no standard for it and we felt impressed in our heart to be able to address this subject before humility and uh according to the message of the hour and we trust that this exposition of music will be a tremendous blessing to you and for those who are local Shepherd that are Shepherd many group all over the world if you come across this uh table this video you can use it as a baseline And I know there are several quotes that brother Branham mentioned about music but I was not able to put it all there but at least we have a call from where we can work together and then you can add every single remaining code into it for the betterment of your church so enjoy music part one and then don't stop at part one because that's not all you will continue with music part two all the way to part three and I believe by the grace of God the Holy Spirit Will Enlighten you and make sure that whatever predicament the devil tried to bring into this message will be stopped and the children of God will be free to worship God in the spirit and in the truth with their clapping with their dancing with the music and music that is acceptable and appropriate for the children of God God richly bless you we love you of Bride of Jesus Christ but Stephen Shea thank you thank you [Music] amen I stand for the reading of the scripture amen God richly bless you sorry we lost 30 minutes trying to give a little bit of time for the people that were coming behind because of the weather or some I don't know if if there was a traffic or something so I was already here on time so it's not on my end it's on the uh somebody else and amen I was here but we just extended some long suffering just like God he did it in the time of Noah amen it's a little bit of long suffering let's be like our father amen Hallelujah let's go to First Corinthians chapter 11. I had everybody with thumbs up but people are still not here First Corinthians chapter 11 verse 29 same scripture and we will recap a little and take off amen I hope I trust everybody is good there is fight going on everywhere with the Devil but we are fine amen amen amen if I want to give you some encouragement you should be stronger than me I went to sleep really late after 4 AM okay and I have to wake up bike phone call amen and since I woke up I can't go back to bed so you should be stronger First Corinthians 11 verse 29 if you're there you can say Amen I appreciate the sacrifice some of you got birthday like brother Angelo and he's here sister that is here I know what's going on at home with Grandma's uh birthday and everything so God will reward you for the sacrifice 20 uh nine fajita Edith and drinketh unworthily Edith and drinketh dalmatian to himself not Discerning the Lord's body you might be seated we all know that the Lord's body is the church amen the Lord's body is not what the Catholic told us by the Lord's body is the church and the key there is getting among the believer and doing things that are not correct amen not Discerning the Lord's body not Discerning the church that God is in the midst of his church he can get you in trouble amen Paul says in verse 30 that for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep you know what that word means we don't want that to happen amen verse 31 for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged that makes our life easy but how do you judge yourself with which caliber which standard there is only one standard not brother Stephen Stander but it's the word of God amen glory to God thank you my brother but when we are judged we are chasten of the Lord if it happened that God is pointing something out it is not really the preacher it is God who's chastening you that we should not be condemned with the world so all that God is trying to do is to avoid you from going into condemnation with the world God doesn't want you to get lost he doesn't want you to go to hell God want to save you and he's chastening you not because he want to lose you but he want to save you amen that's the way we should take correction amen wait for my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him let him eat a home that she come not together unto condemnation we don't want any pressure anything going on here if you're hungry eat it at home because here you can get in trouble by the presence of the holy spirit in the midst of the people amen and the rest will last said how so we got some order there we'll set we'll add set in order so having order in the church is something good when you don't have order then we need help amen let's go to uh chapter 14. glory to God Chapter 14 verse 33. if you dare you can say Amen amen for God is not the author of confusion so when you see confusion it's not God we don't have to argue we don't even need quotes if it's a confusion it's not God because God is not the author of confusion he said God is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the sin and we want a peace of God in this church not confusion as soon as you see confusion in the church just know don't jump into that confusion don't be partaker of it because it's the devil amen God is the author of Peace amen job to verse 40 let all things be done how and how so if something is not decent is it good everything must be done two ways we want it to be done decently and we want it to be done in order if you don't see these two words into a clip song turn that clip off everybody okay if you look at the video it's not decent don't even sit there arguing whether this is uh a religion song or something just take it out amen glory to God let's go to tadas then we pray so the first scripture is talking about the order the second scripture it's talking about doing everything in order amen because God is not the author of confusion the third one it's in the book of tardis speaking again in God order chapter 1 verse 4. if you dare you can say Amen to tell us my own son after they come on faith grace mercy and peace from God the father and the Lord Jesus Christ Our Savior for this cause left eye in Crete left Rd in Crete that that should set in order the things that are wanting so certain things were not correct in the church but Paul gave instruction so that tadas can put those things in order can put the church in order and Paul was the messenger of the church and he gave it to Titus so Titus can bring that order back into the church that's why the order will get we get it from the messenger of the hour amen he says that should set in order the things that are wanting that are lacking and ordained Elders in every city as I have appointed thee so the way Titus was doing it is exactly according to the instruction of Paul not the instruction of Titus but the instructor of the instruction of the messenger because he was the one that God give the letter to and that's God on provided way amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly again father this evening Lord thanking you once again for your grace for your love for your mercy and for this great opportunity that you have given us to sit together as a family and to speak about the things that belongs to the kingdom to your children especially this uh important crucial topic of Music Lord father if there is anything that we have done in our life that we have grieved the Holy Spirit Lord we ask you forgiveness father we pray that the blood of the Lamb purify our body may you purify our spirit and soul may everything Lord father be done and put under the blood Lord and may you look at us through the blood because when you look through the blood that's the only way Lord father we can be acceptable in your sight father be the beginning and the ending of this session Lord father may you move everything contrary to your divine nature away from this place and for those that are still coming on the road Lord father may you protect them and give them travel Mercy they are your children Lord the some have Lord left some important things Lord father to be here tonight I pray that a special Lord father blessing be granted unto them Lord give us the action for the work we committed unto that hand and we rebuke the devil away from this place in the name of Jesus Christ amen everybody good I'm just gonna go with a quick recap because we had a big gap between the time that we had part one to part two so if I continue straight ahead we might have a gap or somebody can get lost somewhere if you put your name on to have uh this quote I gave them to the Deacon and they will hand it to you whoever put the name on they will have it if you didn't put the name on so uh you don't have one amen glory to God last time we start the topic of music and we established the first point was the two Kingdom you remember that we had two Kingdom and the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the devil amen this kingdom are two sources or two power whichever way we're gonna call it we got two power we got two sources we got two Kingdom everything that is in this world or outside of this world is either directed by God or it's directed by the devil amen there is no middle ground that is there and we found out from these two sources we also have two musics amen the first is a Godly music which is a Divine music which is a music that we sing in church which is a Christian music we call that Spiritual music and the other one is a devilish music or a satanic music or a secular music or a worldly music amen and we found out that both God and the devil seek worshiper you remember that I'm just refreshing so we can take off amen both of them need worshiper but there is one person who is the devil the devil really doesn't care about how you worship him as long as you worship Him amen the only person that care about the way you worship Him is God because God wanted to be worshiped in the spirit and he wanted to be worshiped in the truth so if you have the spirit you must also have the truth everybody okay if you have the anointing of God in you make sure that anointing is traveling through the truth because you can get the anointing of God but you're in error everybody remember that amen we want to make sure whatever you do if you get the spirit of God he must be in spirit and in truth everybody okay and then we found out that God is in music by the right kind of music God is indexing the right kind of dancing God is in shouting the right kind of shouting amen so there is a good kind of shouting and a wrong one there is a good kind of dancing and there is a wrong one there is a good kind of singing music and there is a wrong one amen then the third point if I'm not mistaken that we had we established the condition of the age what is going on in this age which age are we living in amen what is the this uh the deception of this age and we found out that this Sage is an age that by prophecy it's a lukewarm age amen because God gave the prophecy either you're gonna be hot and to be at ease on the camp of God or you're going to be called and to be called you are in a camp of Satan amen but the age is not that way the age is an age of lukewarmness in other words if we bring something Godly you will swallow without any problem because it looks like God it is Godly there is no problem if they bring something that is satanic a worldly music from a nightclub or from a secular musician automatically you will reject it because you know that you come up from the world you're already a Christian you're already baptized you're already serving the lord automatically you're going to reject any artist that is uh Wordly or secular amen but the problem the reason why really we have this subject of music it is not about the satanic music because if someone is here instead of listening to satanic music then we got a big problem in other words you're not Christian yet you are not a Christian you're not even born again you're still living in sin so that's not the big question it's easy to see if something is Godly there is nothing wrong if we sing here only believe all things are possible nobody will have a problem with that if we sing Amazing Grace even in the uh presidential inauguration they will sing Amazing Grace everybody can sing you can say Amen there is nothing wrong with Amazing Grace but the reason we are here the reason we are LED into talking about music is because of this music Amen in the laodicea churches you have a music that is not really hot amen it is not even really cold but it's a music that is mixed amen this is the hardest music that you're gonna have because this music have Godly stuff in it amen the reason why it's deceiving because it's Godly it won't deceive you if there is nothing of God inside of it hey everybody okay and I'm gonna read this scripture again so we can really get this refresh pretty well let's go to Matthew chapter 7. glory to God amen normally everybody should be here I have people that are not part of this church that are begging to get this music someone even put on YouTube they say brother Stephen can you in other words can you release the tape amen Matthew 7 verse 21. if you dare you can say Amen I was on the wrong spot okay 7 21 amen the Bible says not everyone that say unto me now I'm gonna refresh this because it's important as we're gonna move these people are not calling Satan correctly I know everybody okay if your perspective about music is because they're saying Jesus it's a good music you're wasting your time and you're gonna get full amen so saying Lord doesn't mean that it's something God like it's something you might like because it's they say God Amen but that's not it they're not saying Satan certain because if they say certain you won't even waste one second you will shut down your computer and remove and reboot the whole computer maybe a virus got into it amen because you don't want nothing to do with Satan but when they say Lord Lord you say wait a minute I understand but he's praising the Lord this is where our fastest come from amen which music are you listening I'm using it to a Christian music amen so the Bible say not everyone that say Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of water but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven so there are many people that are calling God their God but they are not living the Christian Life and because of that they're going to miss heaven verse 22 the Bible say I don't know what's wrong my brain my brother amen amen amen glory to God so he means something is really bothering him oh it's not you my brother there I know who start those kind of stuff he's the prince of the power of the air amen okay verse 22 many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in the name how can somebody prophesy something in the name of the Lord and he is right in his prophecy and you're going to prove to me that that person is wrong that's the level of laodicea amen so don't expect your biggest star this day to be singing for the devil he says and in that name have cast out what devils and in that name done many wonderful works so to cast that devil to prophesy to do many miracles Amen in the name of the Lord not in the name of Satan verse 23 and then we love profess this is Jesus unto them I never know you so every song they have sung every album every work they have done for the Lord every fast thing they went 30 days fasting before they go to the big convention and there is mass healing all of that in the eyes of God zero in the eyes of the Republic everybody knows about it if I need to change that fun you want me switch okay should be the best one praise God amen and the Bible says and I will profess to unto them and never know you thank you my brother thank you uh brother said I never knew you depart from me or from me ye that work what so the age of flower this year this mixing is coming with iniquity amen iniquity means something that you already know about you what you continue to do it so this mixing is mixed with iniquity everybody okay so it doesn't mean they don't know the word they just don't want to do it it doesn't mean that they don't know that a man or a woman should dress properly no they just don't want to dress like that but they want to sing for the Lord they want to do service for the Lord they want to cast out therefore they want to have convention they want to have big concert in Charlotte everybody okay but they don't want to be conformed to the word they are workers of iniquity that is the condition of the age this is where the problem is this is where I have a hard time getting the young people to understand this thing because it's in the name of the Lord amen now the fifth point or the fourth point that we got is the music itself amen we Define music as vocal sound you remember that all instrumental sound amen or a combination of both amen that are combined in a way to produce a beauty of form remember that which is the genre which is the type of music a beauty of Harmony I'm almost done with the review and produce some expression with expression either it's going to be some Joy some lifting of hand some clapping of hand and some dancing amen Etc everybody okay and by vocal we found out that the vocal part have a lyric or words part amen and you have also a non-word on non-linguistic part you remember that right you can play music without using any word brother Branham say that the bird remember that remember even the scripture they were playing music but the bird don't use word they're just singing It's music amen but by word this is what we usually do most of the time and then we got instrumental amen instrumental we went through First Corinthian and we found out all kind of instruments that Paul says amen now the fifth point which was the dangerous Point amen was about the sound everybody okay it was about the sound this is probably where we stop and the sound we found out that this sound carries messages amen so when we talk it now what are we taking off amen so when we're talking about music amen especially the kind of music we we have among the question most of them it's a combination of vocal with instrumental amen but the biggest key if you don't get this you won't understand brother Branham and we will continue to fast all the time the biggest key is usually when we say vocal we're looking at our messages to be carry on the vocal but that's not the case amen the message of music is carried before amen you get a let me write it this way vocal and you got an instrumental amen there is a message that is planned easy to decode amen easy to decode that is the vocal as long as you know the language amen if I sing in French some of you will know some of you don't know even though I'm speaking vocal amen even though I'm singing vocal but if you can get a translator then you know exactly what I'm talking about everybody okay so vocal is plain it's very easy to see because it's in Word everybody okay we clear the biggest problem of the sound of the music is when it's instrumental usually we think instrumental does and carry the message but that is where the devil usually hide everybody okay the devil will not attack you on the vocal because if the devil tells you clearly that hey you need to worship me you will refuse because that's a vocal it is planned everything is clear you can decode the devil and say no this is devilish it's out the problem of music and if you go through across the message what brother Branham was pointing about the music was not really the word of music no problem we will get to that Amen brother Branham was not really pointing about the word because before a music can be accepted in this church it must be Christian we okay now if it's not Christian you're gonna reject it so every word must match the Bible so if you bring me a music from any artist you want to put it here you already know that he must have word from the Bible and some of you will even argue that what they already what they are talking about is exactly like the message of the hour some of you will say no no no no no when I listen this is uh we are a generation prayers for them how do you sing that again huh I know who I am all of that you know what I mean if you sit in the message you follow all of that no problem he zeroed in with the message we are the new generation I know who I am amen amen that is not a problem the devil knows that the problem is what is the message within the message everybody okay the danger of music is not the vocal they know that we must put it Christian the problem is the devil work with the instrumental I have everybody okay by Instrumental we are talking about the Rhythm we are talking about your tap we are talking about your genre you remember our God is an awesome God do you remember you can sing it good or you can wrap it amen whoever sang it and Rapid if we put it in writing both of them look the same but the problem is when you wrap it you have another beat and the beat have another message within it because sounds carries water every problem any problem let's go to second king we just had it recently ah man if you don't understand this you will be in love with Kirk Franklin you see when I say those names you heard amen because to Kirk Franklin everything that was sung before have to be changed he's not sometimes he doesn't even change the music itself the vocal he changed it in a certain way so that the young people can go let's go this way that's it [Laughter] ah the pastor sees a lot amen amen let's go to second king chapter seven glory to God oh my my my my second king chapter seven music is a very difficult situation even in the message churches amen you there ARA you know this story right verse 5. if you were there on Wednesday you know that story it's about the four lepers you remember when they took when they made the decision they say we're going to go to the camp of the Syrian verse 5. the Bible says and they rose up in the Twilight to go on to the camp of the Syrian and when they were come to the other most part of the camp of the Syrian behold there was no man there a whole army with tank with airplane Air Force all kind of army deserted and went away who chased them away amen who chased them away who fought against them watch verse 6. for the Lord has made the host of the Syrian to hear a water so there is a sound that was sent from God everybody okay but when God sent the son he was just not an empty sound that sound had a message and when you understand the message it's going to do something to you am I reading a different Bible but the message that was coming from the sound now let me ask you a question was there any Chariot coming was there any horses coming so music can make a chariot where there is no chariot everybody okay everybody okay music the sound sound can make something sound exactly like a car when there is not a car what I'm trying to show you is these people didn't see the army these people never witness and say let's wait and check and see the Army before we start running away everybody okay the sound penetrate them you're following me when he penetrate to them he begin to create images are you with me let's preach like Sunday man everybody okay in other words when the Sun get there the Sun have something built in itself in other words God wants you to think about a car amen so for you to think about the car God must take the sound of a car and put it in your ear when you leave room what comes in your mind you see a car if they if God can make sound create images in you what can the devil do everybody okay if the if if if somebody wanna really get you in love they can play a sound amen and before you know it you will see somebody who's already thinking like they are in a restaurant and they are giving her a spoon and she's eating and she's but she's sitting home everybody okay do you see the danger of sand this is not word I'm not I'm not here this is not vocal amen the sound only has a message so God wanted those people to heal like a great armies coming with Chariot with horses and things like that God just took the sound and play with the sound and when God begin to play with the sand after a while they sat down they say wait a minute do You Hear What I Hear man wait a minute this this let's get out of here amen but there was nothing but the sand made a difference in their life the sun affected them the sun influenced them and the son put them in action believing exactly that what the sun say is the truth so the psalm carries a message [Music] everybody okay let me read it for the Lord has made the host of the Syrian to hear a noise of what Chariot and a noise of what even the noise of a great water and they said one to another low now they begin to interpret the king of water was the king of Israel there and has higher against us the king of water the height that and the king of water to come upon wherefore they arose and fled in the water do you see how much you can get in trouble because of the sound amen what I'm saying is most of our music are a combination of vocal with instrumental most of our music I like that amen when you listen to the vocal you will decode music you can say no this is not the message holy father I worship you Precious Jesus Holy Spirit saying that sounds like Trinity cut it off because you're getting divorced the vocal everybody okay but if they put to the instrumental this is where you don't get this is the power of rock and roll amen amen it is when they get in the instrument so you got music and music in one everybody clear everybody clear oh God help me let me see if I can find it Lord help me let's go to first king chapter one glory to God so when we are talking about your music is not good musician we're not talking about your words we know you already heard the word that's the reason why you say it's a Christian music the problem is not the word message believer argue all the time because all of them are arguing about the word you will hear people but that's exactly what some say they took the music from the book of Psalm and they sang it what is the problem because it's a Christian music and it's coming from the Bible that is the deception of the devil it is not the psalm that was taken out the psalm is coming from the Bible that's not the problem the reason why your soul is kind of fishy about it it is not really the sound it is this guy here that is holding another message and the Soul can pick up this one he'll say you know what maybe let's tune it down a little bit everybody okay first king chapter one verse 39 if you dare you can say Amen everybody okay all right and zadok the priest took a horn of oil out of the Tabernacle an anointed Solomon and they blew the trumpet and all the people say God save King Solomon watch now and all the people came up after him and the people did what pipe with water a celebration we got a new king now everybody's getting happy and when we got happy what do we do bring music amen that's the first thing where is that guitar bring it let's go ahead and rock the place everybody okay and the people piped with pipe and rejoice with great water so that the Earth the Earth did water ran with the so a sound can make the Earth even Shake I'm reading the Bible if the Earth can shake with this sound what about human being everybody okay music can make your heart go boom boom boom boom everybody okay the Influence of Music is even shaking the ground how can we shout and the ground begin to shake do you see now do you see now amen verse 41 and at the nature and all the guests that were with him heard it as they have made an end of eating and when johab heard of heard the sound of the trumpet he said wherefore is this noise of the city being in an apple in other words what is the meaning of the Sun because Paul said when a trumpet give an uncertain sign remember we must know what it is because the trumpet doesn't just blow they trumpet the sound of the trumpet is a message everybody okay so joab is like okay we hear the sound we need to decode because if you don't decode you don't know what is coming whether it's peace or you can get killed we okay job two verse uh 45. and zadok they begin to dig no let's go to 42 then 45. and while he yet speak behold Jonathan the son of abayator the priest came and I do not just say unto him come in for thou art of Iron Man and bring his good tithing in other words let us know the interpretation of it what is it what is the meaning verse 45. uh verse 45 and zedok the preached the net and the prophet have anointed him the giving them the interpretation have anointed him King in gajon and they are come up from their rejoicing so that the city wrong again disease the noise that she have heard in other words it was not just a noise he has a message what was the message Solomon became a king if you don't know that message you can get killed everybody okay so sounds are not sounds only sounds carries message everybody okay so our problem with the Christian music it is not really the lyrics it is not really the word amen because the word will say Lord Lord the word will say Jesus Christ the word will say Jehovah that's not the problem the danger of music is on the sound which sound the sounds that carry the word because the sand itself has a message amen and that's the message that will make you act Wild our God is an awesome God you will be sitting there now moving if I say our God is an awesome God who moved but there is a bit if I say our god this is an awesome God you won't sit that quiet some of you will have your head going this way amen what makes you move your head it is not the word everybody okay it is the message that is coming across the message say You must dance rap that's what we want you to do you must worship Jehovah in rap if you don't worship Him in rap that's not what we're talking about everybody okay let me read William Marion Branham because that make my life easy hey everybody okay in the message brother uh Caleb it's in 56 where you say rock and Boogie in a message making the valley full of dishes amen full of ditches brother Branham say this in paragraph 38. he says that is what America wants today Pentecost here it is get ready Pentecost is full of Hollywood evangelism amen they are preaching the gospel but in a Hollywood fashion everybody okay why in Louisville Kentucky a bunch of people coming there not long ago and I went over there to a Revival Center for to get my soul all fed up brother Branham was going there under expectation that oh there is a Revival let me go ahead and be partaker of the Revival so I'm gonna feed my soul with the things of God brother Branham say and I got over there I believe you got it and I got over there and a woman on the platform with great big water earrings hanging down do you see that on YouTube comma and with the clothes on look like she has been poor into them brother Branham is not describing the music yet everybody okay everybody okay because your Eternal destination remember depend on what you the discernment of what you see and what you you remember and remember God is not the author of confusion and the problem is we were in the age of lukewarmness so when you're trying to decode the music you gotta turn the volume down first because the volume will fool you when they say Lord Jesus I love you then you begin to get blinded turn Lord Jesus off take Jesus off first let's deal with the real thing what am I looking at this is what brother is saying I came in a Christian setting I'm expecting to see Christians what am I looking at first before we talk about music everybody okay everybody okay I got over there a woman on the platform with great big earring hanging down and with the clothes on look like she has been pouring to them in other words the clothes are so tight you wonder even how did they put that in everybody okay and the woman is running up and down the answer hollowing what devil what is she hollering you see the confusion somebody who looks sexy but yet I said wait a minute this is how can she dress like this then before you know it hallelujah hallelujah now it's a mixed message the dressing is wrong but it's coming with a Hallelujah this is where young people you open up you say wait a minute but she's saying hallelujah come on now cool down you're getting the Trap Of The Devil everybody okay he said Alleluia who will give the next 50. brother Brian I'm saying I never heard such and the music brother Branham is not talking about the lyrics of the music Amen brother Branham said the music sound you see where brother Branham is attacking the music not the word if he was satanic brother Branham is off Amen brother Branham said the music sound like some kind of water rock and roll that is not the word the rock and roll is on the Rhythm everybody okay that's what the prophet is pointing you need to be very careful when you read Bible he said it sounds like rock and roll Kama like Boogie Woogie Daddy's got its place brother Branham is not touching what is has been sung on the song that's not the problem of brother Branham because he knows that it must be Christian amen if it's the book of Psalm there is nothing you can do it is the word of God we got to say Amen but Brahma is catching the devil where he is in other words when brother Branham is coming he say I know you not here who's here rock and roll Boogie Woogie Amen brother Branham say rock and roll and Boogie Hoagie got its place in other words there are places that if you put your head and you see rock and roll we say yes you belong here everybody okay if you go somewhere else you find Boogie Woogie we say no problem this kind of environment yeah that's a perfect environment for Boogie Woogie but the problem is called in a church environment are we okay brother Brad I'm saying that that is garbage place but not on the water brother Branham didn't say that this woman should not sing Christian song on the platform brother Branham is saying that the sound that I'm hearing is the sound of rock and roll amen it is the sound of Boogie Woogie and brother Branham saying I got a coat that rock and roll is of the devil [Music] everybody okay so you cannot christianize rock and roll something can you take the devil and make him a Christian everybody okay the very origin of rock and roll is from hell that's what brother Branham said everybody okay so how can you take that one and make a Christian it will never happen because to begin with it comes from hell everybody okay brother Branham say but not on the platform amen I guess almost I thought the building might do what water yeah so in other words what you heard in the book of the king that was renting

brother Branham saying now I do not like to call people name but I'm going to have to call somebody's name now but I pray for the young man and I pray all the time for him but he is an instrument in the hands of the devil amen amen everybody okay you know when we talk about Elvis Presley like this you are looking at the Elvis Presley on TV Elvis Presley was double amen Elvis Presley was singing worldly music and he was also singing Christian music that one you don't know most of you don't know you only know Elvis Presley on the crazy TV brother Branham is not talking about Elvis Presley on the concert he's talking about Elvis Presley in a different level listen to brother Brown brother brother I'm saying and that is this man Elvis Presley watch where brother Branham is holding Elvis Presley not in his Christian song watch where he's getting it he says the people are gone you got it on the puppet on the screen he says the people are gone Boogie Woogie again you see where brother Branham is holding it people has gone and they are trying by that same spirit amen to get the thing into the church not the song I don't know if you're getting me not the lyrics the lyrics is Christian the problem is the Rhythm they are bringing into the church that's what brother Branham has a problem with it everybody okay brother Branham continue he say I like church music play like what church music and not water in their Church so the problem is the beat the problem is the Rhythm take the Christian song you wanted but choose the appropriate Rhythm that you can play with it because the Rhythm itself separately already got a message loaded and that's the message that will get into the people unconsciously just the same way God I mean the devil sealed the message that's the way he get into you unconsciously before you know it you begin to feel strange things in your body and you don't know how you're feeling such thing it is that beat that was working there was playing with your hormone everybody okay brother brought them say but when they get this Spirit there is something behind this and the devil put itself out a challenge and it happened to be that this poor box leading Pentecostal boy say that they that say the way he learned his maneuver of jerking and shaking he caught it and learned it in the Elvis Presley didn't learn it in the nightclub how did he get into the church he is a member of the First Assembly of God and Memphis everybody okay Tennessee his Pastor is a friend of mine everybody okay let me go to this one and then we continue oh my let's go to the message thirst oh my God glory to God everybody okay I hope I'm not killing your favorite but if I kill him that's very good if he's dead you call me so I cremate him everybody okay thirst verse 65 176. brother Branham says this now what about all this carrying on they done today in the name of the water do you see the problem brother Branham continue he say practicing square dancing in the you remember where Elvis Presley got it Banco Bingo parties teenager water the Rhythm rock and roll twist all this stuff look at this Elvis Presley you see where it's coming from a devil standing in shoes I'm reading brother Branham he called bread of expressly a devil standing in his shoes amen Pat bone Ricky Nelson today you can flip him into Jay-Z whoever you call it Beyonce you can put them all together amen okay the biggest indictment this nation has ever had that is right watch the your trouble they say oh they are very Elvis Presley that you know in the world sometime he was religious brother Branham say they are very religious Karma they sang ah they sang water why are worldly musicians singing Christian song amen why are they singing Christian song amen the song is good when it's written but what they're changing is the Rhythm Amen brother Branham said they are singing the sun Christian song they ought not in other words you should not even touch Christian song but because of the age that we're living in the age is giving them permission they have permission by prophecy that they can mix the things of God and the things from the Devil everybody okay brother Branham continue he says the church ought not to even permit a thing like that some of these guys go out here tonight they are on the Roadhouse out here dancing and playing music and everything that music they're playing is worldly that's on Saturday night on Sunday morning day on the night they they're in church that's the problem with this guy so when you talk to somebody no he's a Christian we know the faith of Beyonce we know the pastor of Beyonce good luck everybody okay he says that and the next night they come to the Altar and do what weep and the next night they are playing music on the what platform oh goodness gracious how far can filth how far could fifth go anywhere anyhow yes sir prove himself how first to be a water a man of God not all these are not all this stuff just because he can beat a not guitar or what what brother Branham is saying is when you get a musician converted push the brick on him don't give him an instrument in the church he still wired with stuff that is coming up from there don't let him play in the church as much as he's gifted in the piano please don't bother Brother John [Music] let him sit down let him prove to us that he changed first because if he get on the piano here your hip will move from here it's going to go on the side over there it is not his song that move your hip it is his beat he knows which bit to beat and then every woman on the nightclub will go a certain way that's what he's gonna do here receiving you should have used a white background probably first uh 65. brother Branham say a fellow called me say come here preacher come on down here a minute I want you to see a television program and there was one of a great denomination in the church had some of these things cover over my that was not a Catholic Church this was Protestant church cover over the thing and was practicing this rock and roll the beat and they said and they say that long has the church Forsaken and overlooked the beautiful art of reckon roll if that ain't a perverted spirit I don't know what it is brother Branham rock and roll is of the devil everybody okay I don't care how many religious song people I have the some of you have it you can verify with me but when I'm saying I don't care how many religious song people can sing rock and roll and Boogie woogly and that kind of stuff come out of the Jungle of Africa that is exactly right it is the devil everybody okay brother Branham say I don't care how many religious song they sing so the problem is not the lyric of the song the problem is the rhythm of the song the beat of the song the genre of the song the type of the song that is where you get the trouble that's where the devil entering that's the one that will make you act any kind of way so when you fasting don't fuss about it oh brother Stephen he's a he's a Christian singer that's not my problem what is the Rhythm he's using to bring his message because the Rhythm itself got a message in itself amen you asked people that went to rock and roll World they would take their music the music will play a certain music and when they stop the music you know that you take a CD you move it on the reverse it will play a satanic worship on the same CD if you don't know that go search it amen the same the same city if you put the CD your way it will tell you a secular music but if you go on a reverse it's a different thing everybody okay everybody good all right now part six point six it's the theme of the music amen what is the theme of the music amen who are you singing the music to let's go to Psalm 45. part three Psalm 45 if you dare you can say Amen Glory Glory Hallelujah sincerely my burden down verse one Hallelujah the Bible says to the chief musician upon social name for the sons of Korah mascule a song of water a song of loves which love between you and your wife you see what is going on amen my heart is endearing a good mother is filled with good man I speak of the things everybody okay which I have made my inspiration that I have made touching who so the one David is singing to is not his wife David is not there singing oh my beautiful wife that's not what he's singing It's a song of love but not a song of love to his wife a song of Love To The King everybody okay I'm singing I'm touching the king my tongue is a pen of a ready Rudder everybody okay so the theme of David's song are directed toward God when you hear a song who are they singing to they say it's a Christian song who are they singing to why do they have to quote people name the god of so and so the god of so and so who taught you God is his God you hear that even among message believer the god of Pastor so-and-so the god of oh okay if tomorrow that Pastor backslid what are you gonna do thank you where do you get that let's go to Psalm 149 . let's see the theme of our song amen amen who are we singing our song to amen Psalm 49 if you dare you can say Amen verse 1. amen the Bible say praise you few people some are still moving there 149 I'm sorry 149 my fault apology 149. amen verse 1 praise you the Lord sing unto who so everything is unto God everybody okay the theme of a Christian song should be directed toward God nobody else everybody okay I can even shock you not even brother Branham everybody okay not even brother Branham praise ye the Lord sing unto the Lord a water we can get to that and his praise in the congregation of the saint so the theme of the song goes only to the Lord because when it's not directed to the Lord he brings trouble brother Stephen you say when it's not directed to the Lord he brings trouble let's go to First Samuel chapter 18. let's see another song first Samuel chapter 18 let's see another song and usually it's the sisters everybody okay everybody okay first Samuel chapter 18 if you dare you can say Amen you there verse verse six you there few people okay and he came to pass as they came when David was returning from the slaughter of the philistine that The Who ah the sisters everybody okay the women came out of all the cities of water doing water and water is that a problem it's not a problem because it's a joy everybody oh God gave the victory sister so and so God healed there also and so was in the hospital they out this one did something everybody's coming whoa praise the Lord no problem what are you doing with your song you ready you ready they came out of all the cities of Israel singing and doing what dancing to meet King Saul with what to our breath we fought and with instrument of water you there now let's see what are these sisters singing and to whom are they singing to maybe they were coming with they say oh praise God you have given us the victory over the Philistine the Philistine are dead we got the victory that's what we thought let's see what they are singing everybody okay everybody okay the theme of your song amen and the women answer one another as they play and say Saul has slain and his weapon do you see God there do you see God today now they start talking about the big preachers in the message everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay they grow they preacher they're seeing this uh that's what we're talking about watch what it's doing everybody okay Saul has slain his water and David his water who slain according to the song David and who who won the battle in the truth who won those battle who was fighting for Israel who was killing the Philistine but now when they are singing they're singing for who and they're singing for who brother they they wonder God used ah what is the problem we're not really worshiping them but we just saying the things you know how God heals them everybody okay everybody okay he prayed for me he lay hand on me and I got healed oh the god of so and so he's the servant of the Lord fine let's see the result it's all over the message buddy I have to vaccinate you pretty good are we there we're talking about the theme of the song who are we singing this song to now these women are coming singing David and so David where were they intent wrong they were just in Joy they said praise the Lord the new preacher is risen he's slaying so much more than the old preacher he's slaying so much praise the Lord he doesn't play a new crop everything a new generation they are slaying the devil and the old preacher are sitting like that we preached the message 50 years these boys just came out now you giving the boys more credit than us because of the theme because of the theme you sing if the glory was returned unto God there won't be any because Saul will say okay all the glory is going to God but because of missing the theme you open the door to a trouble for a brother the rest of his life the sister started the trouble the poor all David was coming and don't know if maybe tired and they cause him trouble now in the convention they don't want him they say Don't call David if you call here he's going to outshine you [Music] oh yeah [Music] the day I will release this it will be a good fire but I'm already got used to fire anyway because God take the heat out of it so I can walk in there amen he said verse 8 and Saul was very let me ask you a question when the women were coming they were coming to a welcome home King who King Saul but why is Saul angry they're coming to welcome you but Saul got upset amen because of a wrong team of the song the Bible say and Saul was very rough and the saying displeased him because the music now is directed towards celebrities it is no longer directed toward God the theme have changed now you open the door to a spirit right he says he displeased him and he said they have ascribed unto David ten thousand and to me they have ascribed by the thousand and what can he more but the water and sold I David from that day and water the brother got in trouble because of his song the trouble of David started because of a song from the women because the theme of the song was not directed unto God the theme of the song was directed unto the people he opened the door to jealousy and a brother suffered the rest of his life until so was there even after the death of Saul he still suffer with the family of Soul who started with the theme of the what is the theme of the song what are we singing unto everybody okay let's go to First Corinthians 14. and then we move to the next point I hope I'm moving good amen amen First Corinthians 14. if you dare you can say Amen glory to God amen I wish all of you even if you don't sing we're here because when you sit down you listen to the song This is How Spirits are getting in people's home people houses in the message have spirit because they open doors to songs and those rock and roll stuff are ringing into the bedroom and you don't know why the fusses are going on all the time you don't know you're chasing the devil in this in this and this and the Very music you're bringing in is loading devils

he speak of what amen but it's not edifying anybody whatever we want to do make sure it is aim to edify amen if it's not under edification you can start trouble we okay let's go to Philippians 4 then

everybody okay seven music set the atmosphere everybody okay music set the atmosphere I'm gonna go straight quickly but I'm gonna give you the scripture you can write it down so we can move on Amen in second king chapter 3 verse 14 we found out that elasha was angry amen amen he didn't know how to get under the anointing amen the garden they ambushed him with a situation everybody okay maybe he was a preacher he argued with his wife but he was not married I'm making a point amen then he's already upset and somebody make a phone call they say hey I'm sick I want you to pray for me now he's already upset with his wife his uh GPS is now correct because you need to refocus again but he doesn't want to say in front of the person Lord forgive me for the sin I just need he need to go repent with his wife he's ambushed he don't know what to do amen amen okay he ran away he said honey I'm sorry I need to pray for somebody then he sat down he's trying to push it's not coming he need the anointing how can I set the atmosphere of the anointing let's go to first king second king chapter three so we read it I was trying to skip it second king chapter 3 verse 14. if you dare you can say Amen amen amen Chapter 14 verse 14. and Elijah say as the Lord of hosts leaveth before who must stand surely worry not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah I will not look toward thee nor City a very high temper amen but now bring me a water he didn't say bring me a singer do you follow me he didn't call for a singer he did Elijah didn't ask for a vocal are you following me remember the danger of Music are you okay Elisha asked for the instrumental he didn't need any singer I don't need somebody to be there with a beautiful voice that's not what I'm looking for I'm looking for a mystery what is in the sound that pulls God if a son can pull God if you flip it on the other side a sand can also pull who do you see her Satan get in the home do you see how certain getting your ears young people you put that Bluetooth on you loading devils when you take it out you already have enough of it everybody okay the Bible says in verse 15 but now bring me a mixture an instrument of music not a singer and Mister and he came to pass when the mixture was doing water so there was somebody that was playing that mystery there was a musician that was not singing but a musician just got the guitar and began to run amen but whatever they were playing there amen catch the Holy Ghost and stop the Holy Ghost and tell the Holy Ghost come this way come this way everybody okay he said and he come to pass when they missed your play that the hand of the Lord came upon him and he says that's safe the Lord make this Valley Water the music the lyric here got something in there that caught God and begin to bring God down he was not playing foolishly he was probably playing a song that is Godly everybody okay but just the the instrument itself pull God down amen that's why you have a piano brother set coming here and begin to play before even the musician come up here we're trying to get the spirit of the Lord come in this place amen if music can bring the spirit of God music can also bring the spirit of the devil everybody okay let's go to First Samuel chapter 10. I don't have a lot first Samuel chapter 10. if you dare you can say Amen first Samuel chapter 10 verse 5. very familiar amen they try to get poor soul to change they want to get the spirit of God in the life of Soul how are we going to put the spirit of God soul is with a prophet the prophet doesn't lay hand on him to put the spirit he poured the anointing but the prophet say keep moving uh we need to find a scenario where we can pull God down so God can come in your life how is God coming verse 5 after that that shall come to the hill of God where is the Garry son of the Philistine and it shall come to pass when the outcome tether to the city that that shall meet a company of what coming down from the high place with water and what a tablet and what and what a heart before them and they shall water so you see that prophecy and music was Blended together I will show you that later on everybody okay it was not just Prophet that were coming and saying that serve the Lord thyself the Lord that's safe the Lord know the prophet were coming singing as they coming singing with music and everything and moving on they are prophesying that's the environment they needed to bring the spirit of God in a believer you there jump to verse 10 amen and when they came theater to the hill behold the company of prophet met him and the spirit of God Came Upon him and he prophesied among them why the prophet were already prophesying with the atmosphere of the music and when Paul when Saul joined that company he got the spirit that was on the prophet I don't know if we're together the prophet were prophesying with the anointing of God everybody okay when Saul joined that company the spirit that was on the prophet jumped also on him and Saul begin to prophesy the company you join with music you're gonna pick the spirit [Applause] ah it's on the wedding day everybody start dancing all the young sisters are getting on the puppy and they begin to dance you're gonna pick up a simple Spirit today everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay Oh Glory to God Amen let's go to First Chronicle I'm moving quick first Chronicle chapter 25. why are music bringing God why our music bringing the spirit of God what is the law between music and the spirit of God first Chronicle chapter 25 verse 1. if you dare you can say Amen first Chronicle chapter 25 verse 1. if you're there you can say Amen more of a David than the captain of The Host separated to the service of the son of Assaf and of him and of the jeditum who should prophesy everybody there with harp so these people to prophesy they need music amen they are already gifted but for them to enter in as soon as you put music then the gift kicking am I reading a different Bible the Bible say to prophesy with herb Karma we fought sultry and with symbols and the number of the workmen according to their service was of the son of azerf zakul and Joseph and netanyah and azarella and the son of Assaf under the hand of azath which prophesy according to the order of the king watch verse 3 of jeditum you will see their name in The Psalm the son of jeditum gedalia and Zera and Josiah and heshabaya and matataya six under the hand of the father Judith who prophesied with the up to give thanks and to praise the the spirit of Prophecy was working with instrument with music everybody okay everybody okay go to Second Chronicles chapter five why are these people to prophesy to bring the spirit of God down they always need music Elijah Elijah music he brought God so music he brought God these they put them there but they must start playing music first then once the music get them to a certain atmosphere then the anointing job on them and they begin to prophesy the power of music if music can bring the people to this level what do you think music will do to the other oxide second Chronicle chapter 5 verse 13 if you dare you can say Amen also they live at which were of the singers all of them of Asaf and Haman and jeditum you saw him with their sons and their Brethren being arrayed in white linen having symbols instrument of music and sultry's instrument of music and harps instrument of Music stood at the East End Of The Altar and with them a hundred and twenty pre-sanding the water so we got a band right here in the church this one is playing the drum this one is playing this one is playing all of them I'm in second Chronicles chapter five verse 12. yes now I'm in 13. and he came to pass he came to uh and he came even to pass as the trumpeter everybody okay and singer where as water so when the drum and the guitar and the piano do you follow me when the drum the guitar the piano the bass when all those instruments blend together to produce one music there is a danger ready if the God is coming down or Satan is coming down everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay I hope you following okay when there and he came to even pass as the trumpeter and the singers were as one the voices in unity the backup singer are singing the song leader is singing all of them now hit the break the sandberry you usually see that on Sunday when they start singing after a while you hear like a worship goes up and people begin to scream because we broke the sun bearing now God is coming down everybody okay when they begin to be as one to make one sound to be heard in pressing watch the theme and doing water thanking who the theme is correct and when they lift up their voice the backup singer with the trumpets and symbols an instrument of music and praise who saying what you look at the theme for he is good for his Mercy endurethra and there that then the house was filled with the water even the house of the what brought the cloud down the sermon was by the brand I'm saying pre-singing is preaching the gospel you remember that you remember that what is the principle about God whenever music is played he come down what is the principle where is that law let's go up to Psalm 22 and I give you the law then we move to the next if you fool you let me know Psalm 22 anyway I'm standing you sitting and not just sitting sitting in comfortable chairs amen Psalm 22 if you dare you can say Amen verse 3 Elisha music bring the spirit of God saw music bring the spirit of God to prophesy music they start prophesying the dedication of the temple put the singers put their backup singer put the song leader stop playing music wait till everybody blend together and become one when they come one God come down what is the key Psalm 22 verse 3 are you there but there are holy oh da da inhabitants the presence of who it is a law it is a law when you stop praising him you are actually building a throne of praise and once that Throne is well established then God will always inhabit the Praises of his people music set the atmosphere to pull God everybody okay everybody okay remembering that in the in the in the jail Paul and Silas you remember the part one when they were singing the music they set up the tune to bring the spirit of the Lord when the spirit of the Lord came in this case they were dedicating the temple he filled the temple in the case of Paul they're looking for something to happen something happened everybody okay I'm gonna read brother brought them brother uh brother Caleb you don't have this one I got it today and let me read this in the message Paradox brother Branham says that I know you are here you some of these fan singers Mel Johnson for one that I know he's sitting here I have asked him to sing for us that song that I just can't get off my mind constantly I'm Hamming it about the tears come running down I like that that was the the title of the song the tears coming down I like that and I think he's going to sing to sing at the businessman breakfast or somewhere for us Jim I want you to be sure and get that for me brother brand I want that song to be recorded and if you get if you have a little tape put it on that put it on that for me special so my children want to hear it when I kind of get down a little I hear that it makes me feel good to hear good singing and Billy I'll go in the office down there and he has constantly got them tapes of singing going all the time and I think it kind of helped him the step of singing all the time is helping him why why how do we remove a demon from Soul bring David and let David begin to play when David begin to play song amen David is pulling the spirit of God and when the spirit of God is coming the demon of Soul have to leave and the Bible says so feel refresh it is the spirit of God that came in everybody okay everybody okay Point number eight the order if you're tired you let me know amen oh God helpless tired the order of Music in service in church everybody okay why do we play music in church everybody okay amen amen let's go to Second Chronicle 20. and then I'm gonna read brother second Chronicle chapter 20. I'm giving you scripture and quote so what I'm telling you by that is whatever I'm telling you doesn't come from me become from God second Chronicle chapter 20 amen oh my somebody's full you ate too much chicken mm-hmm amen second Chronicle 20 they start with wings you jump on it drinking strawberry lemonade now you're in trouble second Chronicle chapter 20 is a sense of humor verse 20. if you're there you can say Amen and there was early in the morning and went forth Into the Wilderness of tecoya you know the Battle of Jehoshaphat and as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood and say Hear Me O Israel and ye inhabitant of Jerusalem believe on the Lord your God so shall ye be established believe in his Prophet so shall he Prosper watch now the order you there and when he had consulted with the people he appointed who singers unto the we must keep the theme correct Kama that should praise the beauty of Holiness as they went out before the please how can you go with an army with singer before because the first one they're gonna get the bullet are singers that's why musician when we have service the devil will first start shooting at you need to stay consecrated if we got service tomorrow morning spend some time praying if you're gonna play the piano if you're going to be the song leader if you're going to touch an instrument if you're going to be a backup singer watch out what you're doing because bullets are flying they already put you first everybody okay so the order of the church a start with musician that's why when we start service who stand here brother John or brother set stand here because that is the order the biblical order of the fight we're starting a fight in other words when brother John stand here and say I hear the Lord just know the fight Heaven is on come on just now we already started the world started amen the singers are placed first and then be what follow it's the army the Bible says that when they did that and to say praise the Lord for his Mercy endures forever so when the enemy begin to look at the camp of Israel they say oh they're coming and everybody set up for the battle but as they coming they look coming up the hill they probably were looking at the general or job or whoever the general was was coming on the horse coming up and say but for that place they begin to see people singing Hallelujah Hallelujah really you're kidding me singers what does that do what is disorder what is the power behind this order verse 22 and when they begin to fight okay when they begin to sing and to do what praise the Lord set a water the Lord didn't set ambushment until the song goes up because the Lord we just seen is God inhabit water so as soon as we start music God is on the sin nobody even fought this battle amen because they invited God Amen the Bible says and the Lord set ambushment against the children of Ammon Moab and monster which were come against Judah and they were water they begin to kill each other so the army that look weak was really very powerful the musician office that people usually see around the message like they just singer we waiting for the word you don't know how powerful the song Services you who are not here who may be one day if the Lord direct me to release this step you who always come late you who always miss the service the song service you who don't see the importance of the song service even if you live next to this church here you will be late amen amen you don't see the importance of the song service I will come there when brother John is just about to be done oh brother cities are just about to be done when I get there we're looking for the word brother we're looking for the word who put the song amen who put the song brother Branham say singing is preaching the gospel so your word is only coming for the preacher not from the singer you who don't value the importance of song service song service itself can give you an answer to your problem before even I stand here on the pope song service can heal you because God heals by music just in the song service you get it they didn't say call someone to come and to begin to preach to Saul they call a musician to heal him okay the order is right here it is a very important and a powerful weapon that the people don't understand in the message and neglecting this office oh no uh we just singing I'm not a preacher why should I even worry to be uh praying 30 minutes before tomorrow no I pray five minutes and then I'm there I know the song already I'm already gifted I'm gonna shoot it you'll be empty

with musician then we start with a narmi the Army need to be trained everybody okay do musician need training where is he written in the Bible where is the training of the musician everybody okay let's go to First Chronicle 25. everything that you saw brother Branham said the church and he just didn't have time to give you scripture scripture scripture scripture line up oh my do we need training do we need to rehearsal do we need coming to the rehearsal oh no that Saturday you take my time my fun time to go hang out amen this is Saturday man we need to have some time we go to the restaurant thing all the time church this Saturday question answer this one in the in the same people in the old church when are we going to have question answer Lord when are we going to have somebody we can pray and then when they bring it the same people complaining first Chronicle verse chapter 25 verse 7. if you're there you can say Amen let's start by verse six other everybody okay need to be instructed do they need a training so all these verses were under the hand of their father for what in the in the house of the SE people were musicians for the house of the Lord with symbols solderies and herbs for the service of the House of who according to the king's order to Assaf jeditum and human everybody okay so the number watch verse 7 of them with their Brethren that were somebody distracted them that were instructed in the you need to be instructed in songs am I reading a different Bible okay their Brethren that were instructed in the songs of the Lord even all that were cunning was 204 square and eight so somebody really know how to play they have to instruct someone watch verse 8 so it nails and they cast a lot against world as well the small as the there Asda so somebody was teaching music I'm giving you the scripture and somebody was also learning music [Music] everybody okay everybody okay jump to verse 22. glory to God let me see if I'm on the right one oh sorry let's go to First Chronicle 15. that was 25. go to verse chapter 15 verse 22. do we need to be instructed do we need brother said to teach us some of us had to play yes there were people that were skilled that were teaching other everybody okay do we need a rehearsal yes we need a teacher you there let's go to First fifth uh first Chronicle chapter 15 you going to verse 22. if you there let's go to 16 so I can nail This Together amen 16. and David speak to the chief of the what to appoint their Brethren to be there so who are singer in the Tabernacle so a singer in the Old Testament was a Levant the singer that were professional musicians that were coming to play in the house of the Lord were not ordinary people they were consecrated people so if you're a musician just know your life is different than anybody else you will live at amen they were appointed their present to be the singer with the with instrument of Music Sultry and harps and symbols and ascending by lifting up their voice with what so when your voice is lift up in the Tabernacle with water because the joy of the Lord is water job to verse 22 now we were talking about the instruction are you there and can Anaya Kama chief of the Wars for what the song leader he did what about the because he was how so whoever Got Talent can instruct others it is scripture everybody okay everybody okay Lord help me let's go to the musician themselves 10. you understand the order you understand that we need training we gotta we need to have a leader somebody to train and somebody's learning now what about the musician themselves ah God let me hurry up amen musician themselves we found out that according to First Chronicle 15 16 that musicians will live at they were singing and everything that they have to do they have to do it with joy amen amen jump to verse 27. we know that David was a musician too right but David was not delivered but everybody okay but David opened another priesthood where he can get in the temple and eat bread and nothing happened to him because he was coming from the tribe of Judah he was talking about another priesthood which was Melchizedek so if the levitical priesthood produced singer the Melchizedek priesthood also must produce we okay we okay and the Judah anybody we ready verse 27 and David was clothed with Pharaoh buff water and all the liver that bear the ark and the singer and kenaniah the master of the song song leader you saw that right there brother John Rather is there in the scripture with the singers David also had put upon him a knee forward of what I don't know if you see what I'm trying to point musicians have to be dressed a certain way am I reading a different Bible amen David singer fine linen or delivered fine linen so you don't sing for God dress any kind of way everybody okay your artist look at the stuff on YouTube how are they dress singing for who everybody okay according to the scripture when the singer was singing they have a robot all of them were robbed with fine linen what is fine learning you know that right you know where it is right in the Book of Revelation chapter 19 right the Bible say for the final Anem is the water the righteousness of the question your clothing that you're wearing on Sunday or on Wednesday as a musician as a backup singer as a song leader as a one who's trying to sing special does he reflect the righteousness of God we're not telling you go find fine learning oh this is what I'm trying to wear that was a tap in the Old Testament but they'll find Lennon was speaking about the righteousness of God another word a musician clothing a musician either apparel must reflect the righteousness of God when people look at you before they even hear your music before they admire your voice your attire the way you look the way you dress your time your suit your pet must speak of the righteousness he said that skirt speaking about the righteousness of God he said shut that I have a cleavage open here speaking about the righteousness of God is your high heels speaking about the righteousness of God is tight pain speaking about the righteousness of God is are you coming with a shirt that is unbuttoned left like this and coming and singing for the Lord does he reflect a Christian look at all the singers now look at them on Tick Tock every musician he used to be singers were wearing uh uh I mean suit to go to a concert to praise the Lord look nowadays all singers even preachers nowadays in Hollywood they don't wear any more suit to come on the puppet they're putting a t-shirt with a gin and some sneakers and they're coming to preach they remove all the sacredness offer look at your singer look at your Mavericks you get all of them look how they're singing for the Lord they can have a pen that is cut here cut here they say God see the heart he doesn't see the art look but the musician have to have fine Lenin are you reflecting the righteousness of God where do we see you do we see Holiness because Elvis Presley learned the bad move in the church why are you saying this your boss just told me to read the quote our boss told me to read the quote brother Branham says this in the message influence 1963 where you say musician and entrance musician and interest for Hollywood you there praise God Hallelujah I'm sorry it's not in order almost leadership oh God yep right there everybody okay everybody okay all right let's go Hollywood through television has took the pulpit over you there our women has bowed to the goddess of fashion of Hollywood long ago and uh and then the pulpit get into it through who I'm reading brother this is after the sales they Pulpit got into Hollywood through singers and so forth talented men people with gift Talent that's the very door that will bring Hollywood here because our younger body here are watching you when they say sister so and so she said good she has a beautiful voice oh she dresses like this why are me a man not allowed to do this one sister so and so who singing there is doing that why a man not allowed to dress like this when brother so and so who's singing there is doing this you become the door to trouble in the families because you don't understand the power of your office oh how should a man the devil is watch brother Branham you can mix what with what laudisha everybody okay everybody good everybody good everybody good praise God what are you trying to say the priesthood of the old Leviticus produces musician let's go to First Peter 2. let's look at the Melchizedek priesthood did he produce musician did you produce somebody first Peter I'm almost done so don't bear with me so we can get it now first Peter chapter 2 verse 9. if you dare you can say Amen very familiar scripture everybody okay but ye are a chosen what I talked about this before right a royal water a holy water A peculiar water you see how God is separating you why that he should show forth the of him who has called you Adolf into His Marvelous so when they see you they must see somebody who has been changed they must see somebody who has been transformed they must look at someone that is reflecting a Christian that they look they say okay so when God Save Somebody this is how he looks but today if you look at nowadays clip on YouTube of musician you look at them singing for God and you look at the one on the street both of them look the same tight dresses big earring banging and all kind of stuff tattoo everywhere they look the same they cannot reflect that this is the light this is Darkness they both reflect the darkness under the song Under the pretest of singing for the king everybody okay let's go to Hebrew 13. verse 15. amen almost done buddy almost done Hebrew 13 Hebrew 13 he almost said the Finishing Line Hebrew 13 verse 15. amen by him therefore let us do what offer the sacrifice of what to who the proper theme continually that is the fruit of our giving thanks to his that's the purpose God Made You everybody okay everybody good so what are you pointing about musician what are you really talking about let's go to First Samuel chapter 16 then we nail it there follow me carefully and we nail this point first Samuel chapter 16. before I go there I'm gonna remind you that musician you can be born or you can be taught everybody okay I got caught there is somebody they don't teach you music they just pick up the instrument they can play brother Brown I'm talking about it some of your birth coming from maybe a gift in the family comes from a mother or somebody and you pick it up everybody okay but some you probably don't know you were not born you sit there they teach you and before you know it you begin to play an instrument but there is somebody that before they teach him you can tell when they teach him he's now a maestro everybody okay so what I'm trying to say here everybody okay this one you can build you can learn but this one is very dangerous everybody okay why because gifts and water ah what so before you even come to the Lord your voice was already beautiful so don't think when you got sin your voice will change a Pentecostal understanding don't think if you go to the nightclub you come tomorrow then the voice will be no it will even go very good after you slept with a woman because gift and calling are without water it won't come off you will go to hell with it the hell he'll fill with people with beautiful voices the hell is filled with American adults people that sing and everybody put ten ten ten ten ten ten ten they inhale Michael Jackson and the other one the Elvis Presley all of them you're going to see them there everybody okay everybody okay because gift and calling are what with our repentance amen why are you studying here because this is the danger of musician first Samuel chapter 16 if you dare you can say Amen verse 12. you there you know this story descend forth to anoint a King David I know you know the story but I want you to follow me even though you know the story you okay the Bible says in verse 12 and he sent and brought him in they brought David now he wants to rooted and without of all beautiful continents and goodly to look to and the Lord say eras and anoint him for this is he the first time David appeared on the Bible amen the first time David is making his appearance because God said go to the house of Jesse I have somebody there Samuel said if I go Saul heard he's going to kill me he said no go ahead and organize a Revival and invite Jesse by the time he get there with his truck with his van and his children you bring them there one of them you're gonna anoint him David God they got there and Samuel began to preach preach preach preach the anointing came he felt the anointing he said Jesse come here with your children oh Jesse begin to line them up God God said the anointing left he said father this one said save me send me I'm looking down there I'm not over there okay first out second hand third down but God he told me Jesse Jesse is here say wait a minute you have one more uh uh he was supposed to cut the grass somewhere everybody okay I'm just actualizing okay they say go get him why did you left him we fixed such a big convention like this go get him you see how God can organize a whole meeting for one person for just one person and everybody fell in the church but it's for one person everybody okay okay they brought David in as David is coming boom ah the anointing struck the men he said oh that's him amen so the first entrance of David in the scripture amen has nothing to do with his gift the first description of David in the scripture is not about his gift is not a bad being musician it's about bringing first the spirit of God in his life I don't know if you're getting me a musician verse 12 13 amen then Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his Brethren and the water the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward so Samuel rose up and went to water the first thing as soon as David arises on the sin God bring his Spirit down and the Bible said when the spirit came down on David he doesn't leave the boy why A Gifted boy should need a spirit we okay now job to verse 18 if you dare matter of fact let's keep there let's go to verse 14 but the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him everybody okay now a case open up this case did not open until David came on the scene the case opened up and Saul's servants say unto him behold now an evil spirit from God's troubled what I'm trying to say is Saul lost the anointing a bad Spirit entered him now they need a solution for him amen but they are calling for a solution then the solution is coming after the anointing not before the anointing are we okay verses 16 let our Lord Now command that servant which are before thee to seek out a man who is how coming player on water we need a musician we need a Gifted Man that gift that you were born with that is without repentance now is called on the sin they want to use it [Music] everybody okay when any shall come to pass when the evil spirit from God is upon thee that he shall play with his hand and that shall be well the requirement here is to fund a musician according to these people if the musician come and begin to play saw somehow will get deliveries amen so the requirement is only to find a musician was David the only musician he was not the only musician we got musician there now these people were sent to pick the musician what is the qualification they are picking up the musician you there and Saul say unto the servant verse 17 provide me a man that can play well and bring him to me are you there then answer one of the servants and say behold I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehem that is a coming in player so he already fulfilled the requirement we send him when you pass through the road there you will hear somebody really playing the guitar left and right you say who is that boy over there they say oh that's the son of JC you know that boy man he was born with that boy can really play the guitar yeah everybody okay everybody okay David is playing the guitar if you pass they say that's David that's his talent we already know watch verses 18. then answer one of the servant and say behold I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehem that is scanning in playing and a mighty fired man comma a man of war amen comma prudent in water comma Anna calmly person comma and uh you need a musician to deliver you but are no one he's not just a musician it is not just about playing music about playing music the boy knows how to play music but the reason why I'm suggesting this boy is because this boy is more than a musician everybody okay this boy not only is he a musician he's a good boy this boy is prudent in manners in matters and not only that the highest thing is when you approach this boy you will sense the spirit of God amen what are you trying to say by that job to verse 23. and he come to pass when the evil spirit from God was uponso that David took a harp and played with his hand so Saul was what and was well and the evil spirit did water war was chasing the demon out amen this was not just a musician David entered into function when this after the spirit of the Lord came upon him he was not just a singing he was an anointed singer what are you trying to say even though you are born with the gift of singing even though you are born as a musician even though you have been taught musician from your home or from somebody because you love music that is not the end of it my brother you still open to the devil amen as a musician you must strive the best that you can to make sure you got the Holy Ghost amen William Marion Branham let me nail by this I can get this other quote let me see if I can get this right here glory to God in a church order where he said the one playing with the instrument you need to go back amen go ahead my brother oh wait no leadership you far away let's say yeah right there amen Church order 1959 paragraph 22. everybody there okay praise God brother Branham say I believe amen the Branham Tabernacle at what somebody's tired the brother because sometimes can I hear it the Branham Tabernacle at all time should have air spirit filled water who would come how fill with the water and would play how very and what kind of music such as Dan at the cross where my savior die down there for clean sing from sin a crime dare to my heart was the blood I applying glory to his name something on that order near my cross today Rock of Ages cleft for me or near The Cross or something on that softly slowly as he's doing water constantly on the water he or whichever it may a musician should be having the spirit of God amen if you don't have the Holy Ghost you need to cry out and you need to guard yourself because you can easily by your gift can be pushed one way to the other in other words the level of a consecration of a musician will bleed through everything that you do that's the message amen your level of consecration your attachment to the word your level if you are on ten everything you do for music will be ten if you want to everything you do for music will be two because your level is low amen amen everybody okay if not you're gonna sing empty songs if not you're gonna do things that you don't even know what to do should we sing new song yes the Bible says Sing a new song there's nothing wrong with a new song the problem is what is the instrumental of your new song if it's a new song and the lyric are according to the word we already went through that if the lyric are according to the word and the beat of your music The Rhythm is correct it is not reflecting loudisha then the new song is normal there's nothing wrong with your new song everybody okay but as the age is continuing to go through Darkness very few songs very qualified good song are coming up from the Pentecostal Realm I'm not saying they won't come out because gift and calling are without water but they will blend it in the way of audition and you will bring devil on you especially if you don't have the Holy Ghost when you don't have the Holy Ghost that's when you suck every song and when you sucking you sucking even their Spirit remember you get into an environment you're gonna pick up that Spirit you put your head into an environment you're picking up that Spirit that's why you watch a singer you will see their dressing and everything how it's changing most of their weight they dress go check exactly what kind of music they're listening to you what kind of clip they're watching that's exactly what has been bleeding into their life because the holy spirit is not there to guide you to give you a sense like no don't get this one this is not correct you are sucking everything and those music once they get into you before you know it you will change your way of dressing you will change your way of Behaving you might even change your temper you will change your behavior you will become stubborn all of that is coming from the music you pumping the music I'm talking about is not Lord Lord have we not prophesy it is not the vocal it is not the word the word may be coming from the Bible but the music is what is Behind the Music within the music that is the one that get the kill duad that is the one that can make a child jump that is the one that can make somebody shoot someone this is the music if the holy spirit is not there to catch it you don't have no filter my friend you're gonna suck any kind of thing and because and before you know it your way of cutting your hair you will match those people you will match them the way they're cutting the bill you will match their way they're doing their hair you will match their way they dress before you know it you will see your dressing are changing your behavior are changing and we want the why are we struggling why are we struggling why are we struggling we're looking for demon here demon there while the very beautiful demon you're getting is in the religious Realm okay because the devil cannot make you swallow pure rock and roll he cannot make you swallow pure rap he won't make you sorrow whatever secular musician is there he cannot make you swallow that you already been born and raised up if you come brother Stephen will show that everything he knows that he will take something else and put two cup of things and blend it together and hook it before you know it you're thinking you're getting the song you're really not getting the song you will find out that your behavior have changed why are you looking at someone and before you know it you want to copy them who's influencing who you're not going to influence them in meaning that song is taking over you amen watch what you're doing watch your changes watch your behavior but when you got the Holy Spirit you can sit down you can look at something and you say not this you can pick this one and say get this out and you remain the same and you don't change but if you begin to change to blend with them because that's what we're trying to do with young people even in a message we're trying to get the music and to blend it together so the young people because they're so exposed to this music on uh on Facebook this is what they listen all the time they post the young people in the message they post the music almost every day on social media one of them or five will always post the music and most of the music they post on social media are Pentecostal singer all of them what caught you is the beautiful voice what probably caught you is the word what probably caught you is the beautiful clip because whoever is singing is driving a BMW and looking at the clothing and looking at the sun that's what you want to watch you don't see what is being loaded later by learner it won't happen at night it will go one after the other after the other before you know it you won't see why is this wrong I don't see why is this wrong you're fighting you're not fighting really with it you have been loaded with other things those things are not loaded by the words you can read They're loaded through the instrument they wrote it to the genre they loaded through the music even military when they go to war they put something here when you really hit the air they can shoot without any problem and they can shoot with Precision music is a dangerous game it's a powerful tool if it's used correctly it will bring God down it will deliver somebody it will deliver you it will uplift you at home it will put you in a good atmosphere all of that is the benefit but remember the devil is up there to give you something else and it will do everything the opposite Why by music you will learn something without knowing it by music music can put you in the mood music can make you angry go see the people that are rapping that got angry because you don't know go at the barbershop and sit there because Barbershop are the prime number one to put music whether you like it or not they should do whatever they did so as you're sitting there 45 minutes that thing is hitting you boom boom until you're praying you say Lord made this stop that radio it's just a barbershop it's just the salon everybody okay and before you know it you come out there you begin to struggle like where did that list where did this music come you sit down two hours ago you were sitting there somebody registered that and put it here have you seen how hard it's for boys who look at pornography to remove those pictures it's easy to get in try to remove it you will suffer for months of praying try to get that thing out try to get that thing it's not getting out because they they really know how to put it when they put it they nail it the nail it they seal it they lock it until before you remove it you will really struggle it's easy to put a tattoo try to remove one it even costs more money to remove it until you doom to stay with it like that and you gotta wear a long seal so nobody sees what was going on there that's the devil any question any question any question let's stand there are few quotes that I didn't read but the quotes are here those who put their name we got them the coat oh my yeah some of them if you want you can read it at home if you look at the vision of the Bride coming up all of that it is there you will see all of this brother Branham said the new golgota of God where they are really killing God he says they're killing him in those short wearing women bob hair painted face singing in the choir like Angels said that is the gogota that is killing Christ I have it here amen so what you think praising God they actually killing God God is in music the right kind of music God is in singing the right kind of singing God is in dancing the right kind of dancing do we sing yes do we praise yes do we dance yes whatever you do do it decently and in order everybody okay so in this church we set the tune for the music it has nothing to do with my culture everything I put here he doesn't mention the word congoles here did you hear me mentioning anything did I mention American here you have nothing to do with anybody's culture he have to do with the word of God so when you want to filter a music tick part one take part two listen to the qualification of music through the word not through your culture through the word and look at that music over there filter it through that if he pass through it you can listen to it and you know that you're on a safe ground on something that you don't know amen when a man fell in love with a woman they have song they call slow they're not going to dance with you quickly they will dance with you slow and they put Whitney Houston and Whitney Houston will take you love you and then you go you go before you know it you'll find yourself in a hotel because that music is actually preparing you with the love the love the loading the Lord and all they're doing they are raising your passion they are raising your passion they're raising your past until you cannot resist that boy why is that boy when you're talking he want to push plagues so you can hear some slow some lovely song and things like that why do you why why why do they need that for because music will set the atmosphere that will actually take they will take over you amen oh no I listen to those kind of music I love them you will find yourself with a weakness when a boy speaks to you you don't know how to resist because you already wired with those kind of I'm insensible you become super sensible because of the music you're exposed to but Steven uh fell uh stood up again and then I made a mistake I fell I stood up again I felt before we go look at the parent to the genes and everything look at the music you're looking at check what you're listening to look at the clip you're looking at look at the women that all the time are playing on your on your screen on your video screen all the time these are the women you see all the time all the time it is getting in your soul it is registering it's register it's when sometimes you look at somebody say I love this boy you say this one really you wonder you don't understand in other words they already the the the heart is already changed what used to be wrong is now good a boy that have beard that they didn't shave for three months they don't even come they took the hair they mess it up it looks beautiful today how can something like that look beautiful so we who put ties we become ugly so something is wrong I know I have a family member I'm going to a wedding and I was there going to a wedding I thought he's going to shave and look good he come in a wedding with all the kind of like Jesus Christ and then I need to take picture with you you see what I'm saying why because everybody is leaving the bed like that they're leaving the crow or they cut hair here they leave something like that and they make it like they didn't come them for three years and that's what they're coming up they say that look good and the more you expose yourself to those kind of figure before you know it you are desensitized now you begin to say oh there is nothing go he looked cool really cool that's trouble right there one shot pregnancy then marriage and divorce I will be the one in the middle everybody will be sleeping at home and be the one getting the phone call trying to see whether they need to marry you or free you all kind of stuff so avoid those music sister I know you love music you want to study with a music all the time please watch what you're doing you want to post post music watch
