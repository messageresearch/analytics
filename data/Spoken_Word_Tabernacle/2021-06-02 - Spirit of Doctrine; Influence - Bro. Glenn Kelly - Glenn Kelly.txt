lord a clap of offering amen hallelujah despite everything that is going on throughout the week we're still here and we're still serving the living god under god's provided way of worship which is the message of your day the message of the hour amen how many enjoy the service on sunday it's eye-opening right so when you read the prophet you need to read to study amen not just reading reading reading reading i read it i read it if you study the message you're going to see things in the different ways especially if you study with the author of the message amen you can know the book but brother branham said i know the author amen when brother branham was challenged he just put the bible he said come get the bible and disprove me and nobody could do it amen because the author of the book was standing right there hallelujah amen you hear people saying things polygamy this this ghost study what brother branham say go in the message take the scripture sit down and go one by one and sometimes the things not the way you heard it you put the tape yourself and you go slowly and you read line by line you're gonna see things differently than the way things were portrayed but we thank god for his grace bringing these things into more clarity now you understand what is the designing from the devil amen it is not designed by creation it is designed by perversion after defiling eve that is the design that's the teaching he put on here amen so the eve at the creation was not the eve after being devoured that was a different eve that was an eve that was now designed by the devil amen abraham never wanted to be a polygamist you see how tough it is did you see that it was sarah that made abraham polygamist you see now he just opened another door you see now not abraham abraham didn't want to marry two wife he was fine with one it was the teaching of sarah that opened a door to another woman now abraham ended having you see now i will hold it quiet before we get into marriage and divorce we have brother kelly preaching for us tonight there is nothing i can say to introduce brother kelly you know brother kelly one of our decon wonderful brother we had one of our house meeting at his home so you all know brother kelly pretty good i still have now received a response for the question there was somebody that asked a question about go into a cosmetic uh school and they have to wear makeup because they're working on to somebody so they wanted to know whether it was good to wear makeup or not so if you are the one who asked that question i'm not gonna call your name just tell the deacon so i will see how i can answer that question amen you pray for us for the service this sunday there has been a mix-up on the time and the manager that you will use to work with us is no longer working with us so i have to meet somebody new and talk to them just this sunday every other sunday is good it's just this sunday we're not sure so you stay put online on your text and keep watching everything will tell you exactly what will be the time of the service just this sunday trust me church i push a thought i explain everything but for some reason it's just the way it is but by prayer things might change so i have to talk to the new manager tomorrow and know exactly what time we will have service this sunday only everything else is still good every wednesday it's just this sunday the 6th there is a company doing something here and for some reason there was a mix up on the schedule amen but pray that everything worked together good and there won't be any too late services and we want to enjoy the lord the way we have been enjoying and i know it's a signal we're approaching our own building somehow amen without taking longer let's call brother kelly again only believe oh [Music] amen oh [Music] praise the lord amen you're happy to be in church tonight amen so am i i tell you the lord is good well i'm not going to prolong the time because it's almost like the sunday school lesson tonight so we're going to get right into the word and um just almost pick up with the where the lord left off sunday huh i tell you that was rich huh our hearts and mind the clear thank you musicians we thank the lord for brother steve and all the uh deacons and saints and prayer warriors and musicians and we all here tonight come to hear from the lord is that right so so we know the devil's in trouble tonight all this power in here hallelujah let us bow our hearts with mind lord god is clear now father we come before your throne of mercy and grace father we thank you lord god for the opportunity lord jesus just to come here to be in thy presence lord god we come lifting up your holy name lord jesus father and those that are not able to be here have mercy upon their souls and those that are alive streaming lord god strengthen them lord god let them feel the presence lord god so lord jesus we look unto the hill to where our strength and our help cometh from lord god we get ourself out of the way and let you have your way on tonight lord god we bring every spirit on this objection by the authority that you have given us lord god so we're looking for you lord god to come and anoint the word nothing new father just anoint what you have given us lord god and we promise to give you the praises the honor and the glory and by faith we claim it all done in jesus name we pray amen and amen this is going to two passages of scriptures we're going to read from let's go to revelations 2 and 20. in revelations 2 and 20 and once you have it you can say amen okay it says notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because they suffered that woman jezebel which called of herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols and let's go to ephesians chapter six and then you may be seated after this scripture he says and we'll go to verse 10 we'll start at verse 10. finally my brother be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil remember now we're talking about our topic tonight is is going to be us uh um it's going to in influence but it's going to be enticing spirits okay but but as we're going to country so you be prayerful with us because you're in there because it's all going to tie together by the grace of god we're going to let him just tie it together and have his way verse 12 he says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated yeah we're here by the grace of god we thank him for his grace and his mercy we didn't really know the direction it was a lot of thoughts coming through but then i had an opportunity to listen to the message there on sunday and i'll tell you it was really rich it was a confirmation because when i was up about five that morning i was telling brother um steve i was just i got stuck there on on subtle that's subtle it worked subtle and i just looked at it you know they always talked about subtle but something what what struck me was you know that devil he's smart too he's smart you know so the only thing that you see only thing that's going to overpower him in his kingdom is ye having the baptism of the holy ghost the spirit of god in your life you've got to have it so there's no reason for us to live okay moping around living not a victorious life is that right everything that god has given us in this hour here now so we don't want to get ahead of ourselves but we want to what you want to look at let me pull these out here god help me okay here's the one i want to start with because we got a lot and i want to just get through as much as we can if not i'm going to just stop where he tell me to stop at okay influence we here talking about look at enticing enticing is something it's attractive or tempting okay an attack of attempted and just bear with me because brother branham worked there but we know with influence he went over to uh second chronicles and and he was over in 26 but we're going another way we want to look at this the spiritual aspects of it i believe the holy spirit have told us sunday morning he identified to us way back to how the devil attacks and his tactics is that right so we're going to read some things that brother branham claiming he's telling us his people don't really know how to fight these devils and how these devils that's down in their soul is that right so we're not talking about demons in the spirit we're talking about demons in your soul tonight you know when he preached the message of the holy ghost what is the holy ghost and why was it giving for and how do you know that you have it he said that was a soulful meeting is that right so when we read we got a lot of reason to do tonight so be prayerful with me but i'm not going to take you past the time is that right we're going to be mindful you know brother steve when you go into the conducting order you love your conduct in order those that haven't see you're going to find out some of the things in there we're doing it maybe brother branham didn't agree but he still saw the grace it has to be grace that was given him is that right he said he know that the message just shouldn't have been longer than a certain period of time but he have a message to get out is that right so that's why you hear me say don't put the pressure on your pastor when he's up there because i'm gonna read some things tonight see we're gonna ambush the devil tonight he's in trouble tonight there's some people in condition and they don't want to be that way but the word in the beginning was the word the word was god the word was with god and the word was made flesh is that right so it will defeat the devil anywhere or any place at any time they're the enticing in these spirits and god help me we looked at these now we know the devil we're talking about the the demons of doctrine the demons of doctrine we know doctrine is the teachings it's the teachings so you're wondering why you want to go home if you're ready to go home and get out of here the holy spirit showed us that first we was in the mind of god is that right we was in the mind of god before the foundation of the world and when he spoke us now out there let there be light is that right the logo he said it went out and when it went on out there and after when i've been the lord brought his people and they sent adam and eve's sin is that right the lord showed us that they're sunday so what we're doing they teach brought us and then we needed a redeemer is that right we needed the kinsmen redeemer to redeem us back so now we're walking we don't want to rush tonight i want to take the time because i said lord even if i have to come back i said brother steve i want to i have to come back because i believe that the lord has something for all of us it's something that was hidden down in there and when brother steve was saying that you have to catch it and see why when he said slow down and when you slow down and you study in this message and once you pray and you invite him in once you invite him in in that presence he's obligated to meet you there because you met his conditions is that right the last time that we were here we were saying we were talking about that mental attitude is that right but we said everything was based upon the conditions i don't want to get ahead of myself because we want you to realize you are the bride of jesus christ son god did not hide this from you god hid this for you he waited and he saved the best for last stop huh we're in a war but we got the victory is that right you got some battle scars down in your soul but god come to shut your feet tonight hallelujah look what it says doctrine the demons of doctrine see the nature of these demons that we're talking about they're intelligent and they're wise they're powerful and then bond is spirits they're not angels they're not humans they look to get in a body that's what they're looking to do they want to dwell in a place is that right satan has an organized army but we're going to expose some things on him tonight how he's been troubling some people making you think that this is something some doctor i mean some kind of trees or dogma this is not a tree or dogma this is the word that's being straightened up that had been messed that satan satan deformed but god sent a word to transform bring you back but it had to be restored and it has to be restored back to the original world is that right [Music] hallelujah help me lord he said now look enticing doctrines of devils he says here in the message 7 24 he says where brother branham he was saying here now may the lord have a blessing to his word is the reading he said we'll call it enticing spirits or the word of god we're going to drop down he said now knowing he says i want to speak on enticing spirits which would be really titled the demonology so we're really you're dealing with satan's kingdom you know so you have to understand now it's going to go a little deeper than when we first started when he first started in this ministry because this is laodicea i can't go through all those we're going to do that and later we're going to go through that later but we want to see you show you that that teaching has to be tore down that old teaching has to be torn down because it was an influence in every age it was an influence hallelujah he said now look he says you hear so much about demons of these days but you hear so little about how to get rid of them ah he said what did he say he said it has so much how to get rid of it he says we are well aware that devils but the next thing is how to get rid of that thing he said having by the grace of god much opportunity to deal with these things called demons he says they're meeting them at the platform excuse me and in a daily walk and why i like to look into the scripture this morning and find out where this evening and find out just those things what they are now look we know that he talked about for the the demons in the flesh is that right the atomic the demons in the flesh which we know is cancer tuberculosis and all these things but when that cancer or when it pops up on you or not that what you're not looking at is the knot what you're after is the life that's inside of there it's the life that's inside of that then that knot so what we have to understand that somewhere along the line unless a man is born again you're going to trouble with something that one of your parents trouble with in that flesh and that natural is that right so you have to understand so that's why you know our parents when we grew up they didn't have what we have they used to look at and say oh boy could acting like your daddy you know when they wasn't living right or something you know because what they was recognizing the behavior that was there is that right they was recognizing the spirit and the holy ghost said faith come by hearing hearing the word of god is that right but he also said you know each and every one of us has the spirit of discernment you could discern what's right and you can discern what's wrong is that right now once you get the holy ghost come inside of you you are going to be able to be discerned if the word is of the if if it's the word of god for your hour is that right hallelujah he said now look he says this he said that's in the physical form now we're getting ready to jump down to the spiritual form he said now this morning we're going to talk about demons in the spiritual form in the soul and this is what is evening he says they're in the soul the same as they're in the body he says and and we are bound to admit that we see them in people's bodies such as cancer and different diseases within the human bodies he says just reached and said now but now cancer in the body or cancer in the soul the demon can come in either place now there's many times and many peoples who who have good thoughts now you catch them here they got good thoughts he said help me good thoughts and good people who tried many times rest upon some little theology see some little theology some wrong teachings something that couldn't move the devil some organizational teachings that's why the ministry here is not telling you not to stay away from that individual for a purpose you understand we're going to look in the scriptures and we're going to show you they are being taught of demons and doctrines of demons of the devil is that right that's what has come it don't matter who it is you walk away from this word you walk away from this message you're the enemy of god hey all right you're our enemy is that right we come in this hour here now because the scripture says we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers this is the organized army of satan that we come to take him out huh we come to take him out we're not playing with no devil this is our hour god has put a power in you that the looser huh loose your child it's trying to steal your joy the joy of the lord is our strength is that right hallelujah [Music] thank you jesus he now they are taught since it says and rest upon some little of theology that they have or something that they have been taught since a child and still find that down in there being down in their soul that they still have something that's not right let me put you know down in your soul it's something that you're struggling with satan can't make jesus with lust of the eye lust of the flesh and in pride of life he's going to come at you body spirit and soul is that right he's going to come with you to us the same way but god told us no weapons formed against us shall prosper is that right brother rabbit not a thing uh sometimes uh i begin to pray you know and brother robert your name come up and when your name came up i said lord he let him wherever he had sometime he'd be over there in that building doing the work for you lord but you said no weapons formed against you can prosper lord give him a word encouraging lord and letting him encourage himself in the lord [Music] hallelujah he said look he said now help me lord he said down in there he says no doubt he says you many are here no doubt he says wherever you find christians gather together you find people who has those spirits in them he says that he says it's it's undesirable you really don't want to be that way you see what i'm saying we got to understand if the if the if the deacons or if the pastor if someone tell you something that comes from the word of the lord then you do it okay then okay then you turn around you end up doing again what they asked you not to do you end up doing it again what they asked you not to do somewhere down in there you got a stubborn spirit a disobedient spirit that's down in there you need to get it out of here [Applause] [Music] i told you the devil didn't the devil's getting ambushed tonight this ain't no play play playing church is over with i've got no use for the devil messing with god's people hindering god's kingdom he's nothing but come to kill steal and destroy huh don't tell me it's not a revival coming on we're going to read something to you a revival is going on in the bride you got something speaking in tongues interpreting you got trouble that's having dreams you got children that's prophesizing you got strongest doing the revival is going on in the individual that's in the body of jesus christ because brother steve the world is open is that right the road is open the third pole is already here moving it it's been here they came in and hallelujah it's undesirable they don't want them you see they say oh only if i could quit lying if i could just quit lusting if i could just quit this or that he says now that is the devil you say you see and now they come in the form of religion that's what they're coming in [Music] they're getting ready to hit him we gonna knock him out huh huh i know his ambushing tonight remember when we were six seconds smith so you're getting ready to move into another dimension you've been adopted god's on brother you've been adopted and when you get in the room you got to know how to fight then we got a six second swift he told brother branham and they get around there he said bow he said oh why you hit me like that because your body never went through nothing like that you got to know how it feels you got to know how your experience you got to take your experience through the word you got to take it through there and see if it lines up with god is that right hallelujah remember the last time we was here we were there talking about them with the lion king i didn't come to entertain you that wasn't entertain you that was showing you you got to look at things through god eyes you got to see it through god eyes you're going to see with this lion when we get to it huh we got another part of the line whether they brother steve when you slow down and read then the holy ghost quickens something to you hallelujah look what we got here the religious devils they get around the doctrines of devils so when you come in there let me read it look what he says he says now if i could just quit lusting if i could just only quit this he said that's the devil and now they come in the form of religion many times now they come in the form of religion many times now you see see it was a mixed multitude came out of here the lord came and showed us about a certain office having a right he's got that book isn't that right here's the other right when paul was saying that it was not by the commandment when he was talking about the marriage and he was talking about a young man getting married he said but it's rather for him to get married and burn but what he was saying because god gave me the permission because of his position you say right brother polycarp you might be out of place but we're never out of position you're always a son and a daughter of god no matter what you struggling with no matter what you're dealing with no matter what you're going through no matter what the devil accuses you you're never out of position look what he'd tell him he'd come around in there see he knew that he could get that grace so when he came there he knew about his position so when it came you got to realize you don't want to come with an intellectual a conception moving up in here if you go back and you have to realize that the lord says christ and god is what what is that right when christ and god is one he says now then the pastor of the age it has to be the one that brings the message of the age so he is round in this hour here now we've got a message that has tied up all the loose ends that can tear down any doctrine any false teaching any antichrist spirit is that right so then he's the pastor is that right of the age if it's a grace this is the age of grace and god has put it in you god has put it in me is that right now when the prophet of god he knew if he would have stuck to the letter of the word i'm trying to help you brother i'm trying to keep it slow if he held me by the letter of the word then they were to torch some families up it would have tore homes up it was torn up but he went and did what he went and prayed he went and got with god he needed a answer for his people the pastor of the age is that right what did he tell us a pardon is not a pun unless you accept that is that right he went and got grace for his children he went up there and he says now be on your way and do what the lord doubt no more what are you doubting about this day and time huh oh death where's thy sting oh grave where is thy victory glory be to god is that right keep your mind on the blood now keep your mind on calvary what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of jesus what can make me whole again nothing but the blood of jesus and the blood today is the baptism of the holy ghost down in your soul hallelujah let me keep reading help me lord he said now look he says there is a religion he said now in the scripture once there was a man by the name of jehoshaphat a great man he was a religious man and he went over to another king which was the king of israel and jehoshaphat being the king of judah and he went down to ahab the king of israel and they got all buckled up together and made an alliance with one another to go to fight at guild get raymath gilead and they did it without praying first you had to meet the condition at the time and the condition it was a prophet in the land and with the prophet in the land they should have went and prayed and they would pray god would have sent him to the right man is that right joe hasselfactor my wife and i we were in a place a couple of weeks ago and it was a sister she came out and when she came and she she's in still in the message and she still have her family in the message and we just asked we hadn't seen her in a while and she's the lord that brought us to her heart we were riding down the road and we got to the church she was there and my wife was asking her you know how's she doing she said such and such you know since she left from over the church that she was at but she says well i called someone so you know she's still my friend so you know you look at those things i thought about jehoshaphat and ahab ahab was a make-believer is that right now you're seeing through the scripture what the holy ghost is giving the pastor like how can unless you can't possibly walk together unless you agree that's bible the word cannot offend the word if you get off the wall now you're going to move on the ground for the devil is that right she says she's going over there with him going over and visit them she's calling her i thought about that what the holy ghost said yeah how many times do they come to you huh they're not coming to you is that right yeah and i don't come over there you keep talking about jesus you keep telling them about jesus you keep telling them about the goodness of jesus you tell them about the message for the hour is that right you're getting the word of the prophet wisdom comes from god one day we're going to get in a series and show you about that wisdom christ is the wisdom of god but it's a lot of channels to that to christ you know a lot of channels that you can go through there and so god will teach you these things is that right that's why he's saying with faith virtue what knowledge is that right i remember when the holy ghost stopped me right there in knowledge he said you can't go no further he said you got to have wisdom and understanding to handle the knowledge that i'm giving you [Music] you want to see hallelujah let me get the going help me lord he said now he says what's wrong he said i say why do you question he's saying if you question something then you're doubting about it just don't do it just don't even do it don't even thinking about do it he said now look he said because you get he said i'm positive sure if men and women could only get into the position of where their soul their thinking their attitudes he said we'll be perfect in the sight of god he said that would be one of the most powerful churches that ever exist when the holy ghost when the prophet of god has instructed us to come in early about 30 minutes and get reverence and pray and get yourself set in your position we understand situations occur but you're only cutting yourself short is that right he's bringing you in to the word he said his vomit go what on all the tables is that right let's look at that scripture there hallelujah wasn't it but i'ma turn to let's turn to it that's uh isaiah 28 hallelujah i think isaiah 28 and 5. look what he says help us lord we thank you for your presence we thank you lord for ambushing the devil because we can't do it without you but i want to lay a foundation i don't want to rush because we want to lay a solid foundation with the bible say what the prophet says and when they come in there and you bring it because why because the prophet is saying what god has given him to say hallelujah he said now look at isaiah 28 and let's start for the sake of time let's look at verse 5. he says in that day shall the lord the host be where he crown of glory and for his diadem of beauty unto the residue of his people who for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate he said but they also have error through wine through strong drink and out of the way he said the priest and the prophet ah how are they going to get uh how are they going to get it thus say to the lord brother steve if they got the priest and the prophets out of order huh we bring it into something huh he says now he says but they are there he said the priest and the prophets had error through strong drink and they are swallowed up uh of of wine see that's why we went over with that spirit of jezebel is that right we had that cup is that right or those demon forces those those cups that come to seduce a man we're talking about digging deep now is that right he told peter in them now okay we could pass justification [Applause] we pray sanctification hallelujah we passed the holy ghost is that right now we're moving which you should be in the adoption position is that right god has given us the authority now to speak in great life is that right those that's live streaming if you don't understand contact the pastor hallelujah he said look he said aaron through strong drink they are swallowed up of wine they are out of the way through strong drink he says in an error in a vision and they stumble in judgment he says all tables are full of what vomit and filthiness so that there is no place clean you can shut your bible and just start running that god has put you in the right place before the foundation of the world because he knows that this teachings that he sent us is that right we got us a double poison he sent us brother rabbit a pastor and a teacher but you know what hallelujah and i got so many deceitful why you can't recognize the gift of god bring any man bring any pastor stand up against them i'm on his side i'm on the lord's side is that right come on down there you know what why how come the world can recognize god that obama was a smart man they ain't gonna tell you but he's smarter than president kennedy and they said president kennedy could sit there and he could sit there and tell you and have a conversation with you read the newspaper and do something else why didn't say that how is it god told us these demons these leaders that's being led by the devil these are smart people we got a pastor we got a teacher and we got a smart man and i'm not ashamed to say it god send it to us god don't give you the second best god give you the best freedom up here [Applause] there's nothing wrong with being smart especially when you led by the holy ghost when the holy ghost is leading and guide you you know as you tell them we played ball we played sports you got athletes you got student athletes i've never told them i said you know what i said yeah i'd rather have a student athlete any day because the student athlete can excel higher than just a regular athlete huh he's putting more in us is that right i don't want to get ahead of ourselves let me show you let me show you what to get ready to say he says filthiness so that there is no place clean whom shall he teach knowledge whom shall he make to understand what everybody can't receive this this is not for everyone this message is not for everyone god said who shall i teach doctrine he chose you before the foundation of the world however the scripture his bible huh an uneducated prophet god only gave it to us to be able to recognize you got to recognize what he's given you is that right you know when you go around and you think those guys are just drafting people you think they just drafting people paying them uh 10 15 20 million dollars for no reason at all no a businessman invests in something that's proven is that right they don't invest in them that's not proven huh we don't have to worry about you investing your money in places and what pray you want to work so hard you ready to go home pray let god send the finances over there i pray all the time i'm looking every day for it to come i'm looking every day for it to come i'm looking for the finances to come because that's his building that's his place for his glory for his honor for his praises for his people hallelujah [Music] look what he says help us lord he says now look he said to make understand doctrine you see they couldn't understand it this is the resurrected christ here this is the opening of the word when christ came down there and was resurrected when he came there when he got there and it was walking down this side why are you sad on the road to emmaus is that right because they were looking at him carnally minded intellectually they didn't recognize and that what he promised that he's going to do every promise that's in that bible it belongs to you what you won't have to realize we you have to realize we serve a supernatural god is that right hallelujah my god help me lord i i better get to moving look what he says he says who can understand doctrine then that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the from the breast for what precept must be upon what that is a precept upon precept commandment by commandment commandment by commandment you know what the demons of doctrine is telling them this is too strict huh this is too strict we don't want to go over there is that right if you love the lord with all thy god and all thy heart and all thy mind now if the seed of god is there in you before the foundation of the world huh hallelujah the word cannot offend the word is that right hallelujah look what he said then the lord tell you huh the more bad women come at you you know what you look at him and tell me all some handsome fellas not only you got to be careful than bad women you got to be a couple of homosexual spirit out there too huh you got to watch for them things trying to attack you is that right don't let nothing negative come out of your mouth they'll try to attack you come at you and try to find out they try to discern is that right but you got the discernment in there see you're not void of understanding no longer because god opened the word to you god don't show you about these women in the eyes is that right then these demon forces that coming at you now the lord is telling you that you don't have to worry about it now because you recognize she's coming with what with that unclean spirit she's coming trying to seduce you i was i used to teach my son don't try that devil by no sign don't try to find no sign and do that the lord said try the spirit by the spirit you decide them by the words and don't you learn the word is inside of you when the woman had the issues of blood she pulled on the gift is that right she used the gift at that time because now she has exalted all of her funds and things so now she went and she poured on the gift so that god can get the glory is that right when jesus christ went to the grave it was now god using the gift through jesus christ is that right so he's done it all through the what through the word of god is that right don't you try to do it because what's going to happen is going to become an intellectual thing satan's going to pull you over there he's very very subtle is that right you got to be careful so you let god do it i mean stop i don't know how we got on that but i'm telling you he'll get there he's tricky hello help me lord he said lie in the pine line he said line up on here a little there a little so now the lord is telling you line a pine line this message this message is the measuring line this is the measuring line huh you see what god says you see what the prophet said about it is that right hallelujah so if you get in there and you won't you don't have to worry about us failing you is that right if this word abide in you and we hereby do you whatever you ask you can receive is that right hallelujah the line the pine line hallelujah let me go back to my notes because there's some things i want to get to god help me he said truth help me a little i'ma have to jump a little bit for the sake of time he says now look he says therefore if a man or a woman could ever get their thoughts and their testimony and their lives so line up with god until the channel of the holy spirit will be perfectly one with god what would take place if the man and the woman could ever get lined up we're with the freedom from their heart with faith from the innermost huh down in your heart we got to get out of this intellectual walking with the word of god the devil should have no authority over you remember when they went especially a demon remember god jesus gave those the apostles authority when he gave them those authority they came back rejoicing they came back rejoicing because the devil was subject to them but he said so you're supposed to be this but that was supposed to be subject to you huh he's supposed to be subject to you but we rejoice because our name is written in the land's book of life before the foundation of the world is that right the blood of jesus he knew he knew that you was going to get in situations hallelujah let me keep going help me lord he said now look many people come to the altar to be prayed for they have intellectual faith i'm getting ready to hit home now huh they have intellectual faith they believe in their mind they believe it because they heard it they believe it because they know it's the best policy but that's not what god looks at he looked down at your intellect down oh he don't look he don't look at your intellectual faith he looks on your heart he says that's why he said love thy god with all thy heart and all thy mind and all thy soul and all thy strength do you have a burning desire in your heart for winning souls do you have a burning desire to read your bible do you have a burning desire to stand in the gap and pray for someone do you have a burning desire in there see where there's no desire there's no temptation if satan cannot tempt you the scripture says daniel did what purposed in his heart is that right even though he had the word but daniel was going to purpose in his heart not to go against his god if his oracles was to pray three times a day is that right daniel was going to do it is that right because he was going to look he knew if he looked towards that temple anytime because of what solomon had prayed and asked god for is that right in the finishing of the temple hallelujah let me keep going help me lord he says but when your confession see that's what i was saying all those within that and hear me good hear me with your spiritual ear the whole world is waiting for the manifestations of the sons and daughters of god if someone come here and i see all my saints most of my brothers and sisters standing here in a bad light i'm gonna tell you it hurts because you have to understand what times we're in now and they even extended the grace the pastor said we should have numerous testimonies where was the testimonies where is the testimonies that just came to me he said now you look you come around here because you have the authority god has given it to us that same spirit that was here that morning is the same spirit that's in your pasta that's in your dickens that's in any one of y'all remember the lady she came i'm gonna tell you my wife i'm gonna tell you about it was a lady and i heard she had twins and the babies died i'm talking about a month ago some of y'all may know about it right there in america a baby died and then one of them died and it was the boy i believe and the girl lived and they came in and the doctor told her a baby died and when she came and she said doctor i want to see my baby said doctor i want to see my baby she called her husband and she got her husband i'm not talking about a message believer god honors faith when he got in there and he got in and he gave it she said i want to see my baby they lay the baby on the hospital bed her husband got up there and laid between her and she said lord you're the life giver she said lord you gave me the son he said lord you have to come back bring life back into her so he can take care of her sister booming god brought the life back [Applause] i huh don't tell me it's not in you it's based upon the condition it was the lady that was waiting for her prayer and when she was waiting near before her baby her baby had died early that day and brother brennan was having a meeting and when he was having that meeting and he got there and in that meeting the lady sat there and she sat there she got there and there's a lady sitting next to her and she was saying ma'am if you want me can i pray for you baby she said yes you can pray for him you go and pray for him so he got over there the lady made it up into the altar when she made it into the altar when she got there he said sister she said your baby is already healed it was a lady sitting out there next to you she laid hands on your and your baby got healed and he said the reason why god did that is because she's a mother and she can feel your unfairies better than what i could have he's your pastor who else can feel your family more than your pastor the same spirit that's in him we ain't pushing the devil this is how i preach when i go out to the jails in the prisons i need to pray my wife always give me but i can't help i got many testimonies there many testimonies there we take it in there we bring it down and you know why because they never heard one speak as they spoke such as this because jesus comes in there he gets the honor he gets the glory in your position i'm not boasting i'm boasting in him because i know who i am i know where i come from i know what he's given me in this end time [Applause] you don't go out there playing with the devil right now you're dealing with doctrines of devils doctrines of devils hallelujah look what he says he said but when your confession say one thing and your life lives another there is something wrong somewhere this is our this is our prophet huh so i don't worry about the devil i don't care nothing about him you know why because you think that some of the devil thought he was going to run me off when i first came here oh i know you think god don't give us been the spirit of discernment well i can't help but i come around there preaching when we go into prison you don't do a lot of quoting i preach the same message you just don't do a lot of quoting you got to give wisdom he said it take wisdom to win a soul he said when you got around in there you preaching why they got all the books they got the seals they got the ages they can get free bibles they can get anything now you see you do what god says do then god when he tells you the minute you minister that way the way he thought you get yourself out of the way i let him use this gift is that right oh i want to be in the message i want to visit the message you think the holy ghost didn't tell me huh the same holy ghost was back then is the same holy ghost right now i'm not moving on my own i'm moving by him the spirit the footsteps of the righteousness is ordered of the lord is that right that's what we're talking about in this hour here now so you come around here you know why he's sending us here because god knows for it to come at the right time i know he's the man you know why because i got thus say the lord i got it from god and i'm not ashamed to say it you better have contact with god yourself this is an individual walk they're looking for the revival huh what are you talking about i'm looking for souls to be crying out i'm looking for them to come around there to the altar how could they come around it was individuals sitting back in there they know they want to be set free they were sitting there like this they didn't know which way to go because beam is a doctrine hat when you have to face them you'll face them first time brother brandon had to face the more devil too running that old demon was in that woman running around there he ran out of there didn't he huh you got to be prepared to face these devils huh i'm just talking about him me the first time i call myself getting out there young fellow boy going through some work for the lord getting out there huh then and the lord didn't see me there go and then pray for a fellow the devil looked and raped my face ha ha i'm still here he knew he was right i was still learning he knew was right so you see what about the seven sons of skipper you think they ain't alive come on now huh they tried to handle this holy ghost they tried to go up against them devils they saw something they saw something that they needed they saw a power that they wanted is that right the seven sons of skeeper skipper mean intellect they try to handle that word through intellectual and when they come around in there and they couldn't move that devil he said jesus we know paul we know but who are you he said them demons jumped on them and whooped them naked is that right tell me the devil ain't real you better but we got a greater power greater is he that is in thee than he that is in the world god has given you a word and i'm telling you what you got you want to go home let me float around there look what he says let's see what's down in that soul let's see what's down in that soul some of you brothers don't bend around get in your position moved in your position let god be able to use you come on it's almost going home time is that right look what he says he said now he says but there is something where he said that's because you've got an intellectual faith and not a faith from your heart and that shows that outside here is a knowledge of god see that's what brother branham when his brother preached in the hebrew series he said they're coming to the knowledge of the truth is that right they never came and received the baptism of the holy ghost it was only an intellectual conception of the message and the only one knew it was that person in god is that right because god is the only one can give you the holy ghost he gives you he knows you're soaking your heart is circumcised by what by faith is that right hallelujah look it's not hard faith is a revelation you want the revelation what the past what the lord has given the pastor you want to go too deep huh you want to go to the deeper all you got to do is believe all you got to do is believe when i return to the earth shall i find what faith you got to believe on whom now i've sent some of you dropping some of the some of the devils dropped in your spirit you come wondering is that right that's like you got the message from the men in the in the message here you know some of them over there streaming who has some of them live streaming because they're wondering you know why you're wondering you know why you're wondering because the demons the doctrines got to hold to you so when you got around in there they're looking rather than when god has given us you're going to tell me that i'm going to worry about the mass sure we respect the laws of the land but we had a prophet that told us way before the pandemic came is that right he told us they was going to be doing what a stern war he called it a germ war a demon war is that right so that demon that come in there he told us something was going to do what stay home son was going to stay home he said something was going to do well had to put a mask on is that right some is going to do what we couldn't even keep light saw on the shelf at walmart huh some say that we was going there was going to buy about a light saw and he said something was going to have a what a mask and then to get around this is that right didn't he prophesy that but he told us the only thing that's going to keep it all for you is the blood of jesus christ the baptism of the holy ghost i'd rather stick with the words of the prophet that's what i'd rather stick with you know what jesus wasn't popular i ain't want your money i don't want popularity i don't want no position you're going to let god people go with your false teaching in this out here [Applause] god sent this god's opening this up this church says you had to be ready we shaking them up around here researching these message people up around here they never heard of teachings like this like they heard before tell them to come against it how can you come against it when they're ready to from the dead we don't came from the dead mixed multitudes came out of here you had the son of god and the sons of the prophets the sons of the prophet stood far off for the rally they never really believed uh they stood off and they wondering is that right elijah but he lucia he saw what he saw the spirit that was on him we didn't see the man we ain't worshiping the man we saw the spirit that was wrong the man the spirit of elijah huh thought they was getting away brother steve you know why well brother branham is not here that gift's not here that gift's not here he don't care he can discern those things we got a man uh one two three four we got a man sitting back in here he's got a blue jacket and bailey's pants his name is polycarp is that right yeah believe go on your way you know what but what they're missing is now when the third paul claimed it's the opening of the word is that right they just didn't open now we got understanding of it when understanding comes your confidence comes when confidence comes your faith come we have faith come it's a revelation is that right so we have to fight in this war that's why he said cast down every imagination that try to exalt itself against the word of god obsession oppression possession obsession is receiving the wrong start stay away from them doctrines of the devil is that right then if you receive it he'll oppress you with that thing and then you know what he'll grab ahold of you is that right but now we still got the discernment the word of the lord is able to discern the thoughts and the intents of the heart is that right and able to go down between the muscles and the morals of the bones hallelujah you want to go home with this had to come you don't see this had to come let me read something to you i know i'm jumping around but that's okay how your way lord he said now look look this had to come this message the way is coming through here now god hit him god hit him for 15 god hit him for 13 14 15 years hit him as a deacon hidden brothers there is that right they thought they they thought they had us no no no no no no god is in control of everything look what they say this is in the uh seven churches now you can read this out of the old blue book church age on page 377. he says and i'm gonna jump a little bit he says now the true church will take away from this this world to be with the lord see we're looking for the lord that's why the lord told us and when abraham got in the promised land you would think that was it is that right but the scriptures didn't say that it's natural to abraham it's the same thing with us the spiritual abraham he told us he was what looking for a city and a builder and a maker and a foundation that was who it was god is that right this is not our home don't get comfortable here is that right hallelujah he said now he says they they god will catch away his bride for the great marriage supper of the lamb he said now as the concluding chapter was given in order to these two churches and two spirits from pentecost to their consummation we will take this final time to show this in the lay of the sea age is that right it had to come in this age he chose you because you're going to be victorious you are overcomers in this age is that right he said this age started just after the turn of the 20th century as it was to begin this age the true church will return to being the bride she was at pentecost our pentecostal experience is that right we know that there must necessity be a return of the dynamic power huh it must be a return of the dynamic power but how is it going to return something got to happen and god put you in the place hallelujah the believers sensed this in their spirits and began crying to god for a new outpouring such as was in the first century what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues manifest the gifts of the spirit the restoration they thought this was the restoration but it wasn't the restoration yet huh look what has to come still with me let me slow down look what has to come it was then believed this was indeed the long-awaited restoration he was talking about the pentecostal denomination he said it was not for the latter rain can come only after the former rain i'm and you're sitting in the midst of it he said which is the spring or the teaching huh they got to come to tear down the teachings of the devil of the doctrine of the demons that these denominations them poisoned people with amen got to come and god joshua god have you in the midst of it god is cleaning us up he says now the latter rain then is the harvest ring how could this be the real thing when the teaching reign had not come look what you're getting now this is that this is that what we've been waiting god you can't have the mechanics and you've got to have the dynamics and the mechanics got to go in one according to the scripture everything had to be restored god said i shall restore what the palmer worm the cankerworm the caterpillar the locust and what have i eaten up what the catholic what the baptist what the method is what the lutheran what the presbyterian what the pentecostal even muslims oh that what you have eaten up i shall restore huh help me lord he said it has to come thus was that what he says teach the people he says now how could this be the real thing when the teaching reign had not come he said the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children back to the pentecostals fathers had not yet come see how the lord said malachi 4 luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 us hallelujah look what you're sitting up in that's why you ought to be blessed and thank the lord bless the lord thank the lord you children that the god is keeping you keeping you pure keeping your virginity god has sent you a word that's going to keep your virginity to keep you pure to keep you right until your husband coming to you is that right you know without a shadow of a doubt he talked to us over there in what ecclesiastic i mean song of solomon 4 when he told us is that right paul talked about first son when you got her in you little sarah sarah when you come around in there your husband first got to be your brother is that right and after you become your brother then he become your husband ain't that what the lord has told us you see so now god is restoring all of these things back he's bringing back the absolute when malachi 4 came the absolute it will not be moved is that right it's infallible hallelujah help me lord my god my god trying to follow somewhere help me lord the harvest ring it says it says thus what was thought to be the restoration and the final quickening unto the rapture had not come in it was a mixture of unrighteous partaking of the spiritual blessing and manifesting in the holy ghost hallelujah nicely brother charles nick's multitude always been always was prophet god said it was twins the holy ghost as we have kept pointing out to you in it also was devil power as men were under the control of devils see why the pastor keeps saying the devil with demons is hiding demons is hiding and demons was hiding in you hallelujah let me let me let me jump back to where i was at because i want you to see this here you can go if you want to finish reading that like i said it's on page 377 in the old church age book he says now look he says he says now when the kings he says let me read this once more so you can get it when your confession says one thing in your life lives another what's in there see here it's a demon of doubting i believe in divine healing but my life is showing something else somewhere is a demon of doubting you went through justification you went through sanctification and now you're swept clean still with me and now by your being swept clean he says now he said the devil said the house is clean and he said i'm going to come back because you never moved to get the baptism of the holy ghost and got sealed and now when you move in there because now somewhere you didn't get the holy ghost is because you doubt it you're doubting something and god cannot give it to you cannot seal you like that so the demon of doubt comes back with that demon of doubt and it comes back seven times worse seven other demons you're worse off than when there once was before is that right so we have to understand in the garden of eden that's what got even trouble don't reason the word just believe the word if you don't understand it just believe it and god will bring it to you gotta break it open remember brother branham talked about that you just keep confessing remember the man that came up into the prayer line he was old catholic he had blinded he was around and never been to a holy ghost field meeting and when he never been to the holy ghost field meeting he got there and he came up in there to brother branham spoke just paraphrasing it for the sake of time he told me he came in the prayer line go on your way you're healed said he went out there he said he was blind the man said he was blind is that right he went out there they mocked him it got right scoffers came at him then he came back to the meeting the next night he said he came up in there he said you told me i was healed he said you told me you believe why you back in the prayer line hallelujah why are you back in the prayer line you said god said when he returned to the earth shall i find what shall i find faith is that right you got to stand in the gap in those young children you got to show your children that our god is a supernatural god our god is a real god he's able to defeat any devil any sickness any what any headache any lust any pornography any drinking any smoking any drug in any of your financial situations any mental situations anything that you're going through any homosexual any pornography anything that you're struggling with that's a demon of doubt don't let the demon of doubt come and get down in your soul we're getting there we're showing you how to fight now the demon of doubt ah the demon of doubt give me five more minutes he said look help me lord he says i believe he says now this these kings see before they started out they should have before they started out joe hasselhoff ever made an alliance with ahab he should ought to have first said let us pray he says and see what the will of the lord is so the first thing to start to fight this battle is pray you got to have your prayer life see if you're not communicating with the source if you're not communicating with the counselor see that's why he says he's like a lion like a lion i don't know if i had that in there god help me he said like a lion like a roaring lion satan is the influence he got always here hallelujah nothing to what brother brandon was working with here brother steve when you was talking there i tell you that thing came to me and i was looking to listen to the message invading of the united states he said invading of the united states and but steve you said something we would fellowship he didn't realize he said you had to come through hollywood i said hollywood but but remember the scripture says like a roaring lion and hollywood the number one uh producers at the time was mgm mgm juiced the lion and when they came around in it and their locals was aurora and when they came in there brother branham said he entered in through the television he entered into the movies let me read it to you i'm trying to start rushing because of time help me lord he said he was like a roaring lion he said he came through hollywood he just came through the movies he said he came through the fashions he said he came through the television and now i entered and i and i added the internet so when he came there she went a lion ross what he's doing is saying this is my domain now now i'm starting to take i'm going to move in now i'm going to invade your home i'm going to invade your privacy that's why when we call it the television you got to monitor my grandchildren and my children i let them watch christian movies and different ones but i made sure that i don't have no television there because you have to realize what the prophet i don't have time to get into it right now but you can go in the first i mean first peter five and eight and you see why the prophet of god started talking about this because when they invaded the united states these demon forces was now coming out and all these different movies all these things now it was supposed to be entertaining the people they were demons forces getting in their souls you see what he was doing so now sooner or later remember he also taught us what did he say he said those demons that he saw on that woman then sears and robots when he went down there to hell now all these demons that people have been watching for years is now is being manifested out of their lives is that right so now these now what they're looking to do is get back to their normal sinful life back to the filthy beaches back to running around on their filthy garments walking around and these things are demons of the of the the doctrine demons of the devil so these demons doctrines of the devil we have to realize they're real they are full i tell you what let's just look at a couple uh scriptures if you give me by the grace of god god help me first um timothy i think it's first timothy four he said lord it's time for him it's time to take off the the the uh uh training gloves it's over with saints we're getting ready to get out of here god showed us the teaching the teaching reign is here so they got to under un understand the the true believer been waiting on this hallelujah let me see is that the one i said was the first corinthian first timothy four did i say help me lord he said get to it so we have to realize the time and the hour that we're living in hallelujah come on now thank you jesus thank you lord thank you jesus he said now look he says i charge thee therefore before god and they let me see was that the scripture no that wasn't a scripture god help me i don't think that was the scripture for the second oh i'm in second timothy yeah i said first thank you jesus he says now the spirit is speaking expressively that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith see he already told us he says giving he to what seducing spirits and doctrines of devils he said speaking lies in hypocrisy so you're looking at these tactics of the devil the first thing the holy ghost told us what rusty he told a son he told you sunday the first thing he come to do is allow you to get you off of the message of the hour is that right he come to get you off the message of the hour and try to make you think this message of the hour is not true and just bear with me we bring the musicians you can come on up please it says speaking what lies see lies in hypocrisy now we're showing you his tactics he said his proxy having their conscience seared with a hot iron see they ain't going to listen to nothing you can't bring them into nothing he says he says darling souls that their souls their souls are mocked with sin with unbelief he said now forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from meats which can have created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth for every creature of god is good and nothing to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving for it is what sanctified by the what the word of god with what with prayer he says if you put the brethren in remembrance in these things thou shall be a good minister of jesus christ nourish all in the words of faith and of good what doctrine whereunto thou has obtained he says but refuse profane and old wise fables and exercise thyself rather unto godliness for bodily exercise prophecy but godly is profitable unto all things having promised of the life that now is and of that which is to come it says this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptations he says for therefore we both labor and suffer reproach because we trust in the what living god who is the savior of all men especially of those that believe these things command and teach you know we i know i didn't get to near what i wanted to get to but i'm going to stop there stop there and we want you to realize why the lord is bringing what he's bringing this is a glorious time in the place that they have us in right now you know so we don't need to be discouraged we need to stay in courage because as the lord finish we'll bring it all he'll bring it all together and when they bring it all together it won't be long before we go home hallelujah let

read you something get matthew chapter 16. i'm going to let you go home i kept the first team on t4 and here brother kelly search it all up and pull it amen the doctrines of devils matthew chapter 16 today verse 6 are you there then jesus say unto them take heed and be aware of what the leaven of the pharisee and of the sadducees this was two class of people under the law of moses but they were separated by doctrines if you want to know their doctrine shoot me a text i'll give you scripture and you're going to see what the pharisees believe and what the side you see one did not believe in angels and resurrection and the other one did believe it so he formed a doctrine but both of them still under moses that's why jesus said he listened to what they say but don't watch them because they sit on moses see they're going to tell you brother brother i'm saying brother brother i'm saying. but when you watch them it's contrary to what moses says now then jesus said unto them take heed and be aware of the leaven of the pharisee and of the sadducees what is the leaven of the pharisee and the sadducees what does steven say no job to verse 11. how is it that she do not understand that i speak it not to you concerning i'm not talking about the yeast amen it's right here in the scripture i'm just reading you the scripture amen sometime i see it i read the scripture i'm just wondering what was going on in this message amen concerning bread that you should be aware of the what the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees so lord jesus would you please explain us verse 12 then understood today how that he begged them not be aware of the leaven of bread comma but of the water the dog train of the water and off the water you see the trouble and doctrine means what the teaching when i got in the message back home i'm moving came in here i ordered sermon books and i began to sit down and read myself the first sermon book that was handed to me was the seven seal [Laughter] maybe that's why i love the seals amen and when i got here i order more and i begin to read and as i was reading and i was reading and i stop i call the minister say wait a minute i'm just asking a question what was the problem back home because there were this one believed this this one believe this and it was war all over the message wars of doctrine all over amen and the souls of the people were neglected and that spirit of war got into the congregation and the congregation be we begin to fight one with another congregation then there were names all over the country big names that pop up and there were ministers under the name minister under a certain person and those ministers have the churches behind them and it was like a war zone and this one said the seven seal is being revealed this one said it's not revealed all over like 20 30 years people just have been so when people sit and they are fellowshipping about the word of god they don't fellowship for revelation they are fellowshipping for argument and debate it's all over debate they can sit and argue three hours when they leave this one kept their position and the other one kept their position and not they didn't learn anything they go back and live the same way and the people were caught up under that amen and begin to talk about what is going on in the message instead of talking about what is going on in the message in the world amen when i begin to read i ask a minister a question and say what was going on back home he said what do you mean i say look brother branham says this here brother branham said this here brother branham says this here brother branham says this here the minister told me say i don't understand i said but the problem is so clear and i come to find out it was battles of individuals and that got the congregation into a fight and the same thing happened all over the world and god now is shaking everything up and down amen everything has been shaken amen now it's no longer about a personality it's about the word of god amen we heard so much we don't see the power we heard so much we still we're having demon we're still struggling amen why because that religious devil got onto the people the people got comfortable with demon we know also and so we are fine too so and so we ate with saw and so we slept in so and so how we dine with so and so we fellowship with so and so and they think with that they are entitled to go to heaven amen amen and when you bring the message you say brother branham says this watch how they fight you with brother brother message amen you can bring 20 coats and the people still hanging on to what they believe because so and so who has a big name told them that he was right you can bring 11 coats and they still hang on to that why because so and so say that religious demon amen the temple did not change the life did not change the demon are still there the attitudes are not changing and before you know it the younger that are coming up on this church will begin to challenge the older one amen because when they're going to see the scripture they will turn around and look at mom and say but what you're saying is not what is written here and you're going to wake up amen when the younger one will turn around and say wait a minute daddy you say this but the pastor showed us in the scripture in the message that brother branham said this it is amazing how i sit with people and they still reason with the word after everything that the lord opened their priority is what is logical to their mind amen in other words if it doesn't make sense they don't care but branham is just a man ah we already know that amen david was a man the whole bible was written by the lives of men now how can you take this bible and show me which part of death within the bible is human and which part is not human while it's in the word of god the life of david is right written in here how can you demonstrate to me that brother stephen from chapter 1 till chapter 13 it's not inspired that's just the man david the bible says all scripture is what which one are you going to take off amen you see david crying my god my god why have that forsaken me oh brother stephen this is just a man that was going through depression later on somebody had a cross crying my god my god why have that forsaken me what are you gonna do no no this is not brother branham this is the human part even the people that work with brother branham if you look at their name if you just humble yourself you just look at leo you see what i'm saying how can two homosexuals work on the tapes and god let it go you see how we pass other people you know that leo and gene were we're homosexual right and who are taking care of the tapes how can god let two people like that taking care of the trips before they get kicked out later on amen look at their name you will understand look at their name one is leo one is gene look at their name and they were homosexual and they were handling the tape seed amen because the ministry of malachi 4 comes with luke 17 30 under a sodomite condition you see what i'm saying and because he comes under the sodomite condition leo speak of the second coming amen the gene the message of the second coming is coming when the world is under the sodomite condition that's why you see leo and gene together handling the tape yet under that anointing of homosexuality because that's the seed that's gonna break that anointing and present you before your grandmother fight brother branham again you see you see now it is a prophetic message all you do humble you're proud humble your knowledge humble your education humble your experience humble all your knowledge your friends in the message just humble yourself when somebody shows you the scripture and the message just say amen and move forward amen if not you're going to be left behind with demons that's why i can't pull toward the surface i tried to pull and he keep holding me because somebody's still there hiding something and the more i preach the more i preached pop it pop up the more i preach the more i preach it pops up until everything is clear then we go back up to the surface amen it is not to belittle you it is just the grace of god he doesn't want you you suffer so long with holding yourself i don't want to look at this i don't want to look at that's too much that's stress that's a lot of headache amen that's a lot of headache you have that desire still burning burning burn and you are controlling that by law it's a headache if you gotta get upset get upset amen because you're cussing within yourself you don't want to cuss because people will see you but in yourself no it's too much let that thing come out let it be exposed let it come on the surface and let's go and clean it up then you won't have to worry about it but i'm saying when somebody casts him he turn around he said i'll pray for you but i'm stop he say then i knew something happened to me it was no longer by the bottom it was somebody else who was holding brother branham that's where we want you to be that's where we are taking you to amen where the burden of christ is light you bring your burden you give it to him he gives you his burden and then you ride in your life easily it is no longer you that lives it's going to be christ that lives in you period amen let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy and for speaking to us tonight lord father you have been all over the country searching and lord killing this spirit of religion that have been hovering your people and lord protecting demon lord it has been a covering all along and the pharisee took it by tradition and father continued with it not even realizing that they were crucifying the very word that was made flesh and i was promised in lord the old testament lord father they could sit with the old testament and read all the scripture not even realizing that that scripture was made flesh right among them and they really miss it lord jesus christ this is homegoing time father may you move that demonic spirit of religion away from this place away from every family of this place lord father may people realize that there is no comfort zone beside being in christ jesus father may all that we have in our mind everything that we hold dear that we thought lord that we have a right we were born in a message we sat here 20 years 30 years and everything but we don't even realize that our life have not even progressed a bit with you we are praying our prayers are not answers we are lord father fighting against left and right lord and we keep using our intellectual over and over although all of the lord even for the lord of things that happen in our life we can't even rely on you father it's time to realize that we need you we need you in our life we need you more than ever we want a lot further if it's possible to start afresh father we would rather start afresh and make sure that we started on our good standing versus continuing to progress while the world that we took before is not giving us any better hope lord father we commit everybody unto the hand may you continue to minister lord father may you move on about the service coming up this sunday lord that may your door open in a supernatural way may you move this demon that is trying to withhold this service lord and father may you take a full control lord you're the miracle working god as we committed all and father pray for travel mercy for your children as they go into the respective place in the name of jesus christ amen god bless your church [Music] can't you see [Music] [Applause] why i'm
