[10:36] if anyone has a
[10:37] prayer request on their heart this
[10:39] evening
[10:41] does anybody have a testimony i have on
[10:43] here that a sister has a testimony
[10:46] she want to go ahead and make it known
[11:01] god bless you all the testimonies
[11:04] regarding my daughter abigail
[11:06] it has been three years that i went to
[11:09] the
[11:10] doctor for her physical and your checkup
[11:13] when i went there
[11:14] you know normally they would tell them
[11:16] to cover their eye and say out the
[11:17] letters
[11:19] and i noticed myself that she was having
[11:21] a hard time saying those letters out
[11:23] and then i talked to her when the
[11:25] daughter came in i say i noticed that
[11:27] she's having her
[11:28] issue i mean difficulty is saying the
[11:30] letters out
[11:31] and the daughter said that since she's
[11:32] just six we can just observe and see
[11:35] if she will maybe improve because some
[11:37] of the people will
[11:38] improve later on i said okay that's fine
[11:41] and we checked it we'll see it at the
[11:42] next checkup
[11:44] a year after i went to the doctor's
[11:46] office again
[11:47] i noticed again she was having a hard
[11:49] time saying those letters out again
[11:52] and then the doctors say it is truth is
[11:54] having a hard time
[11:56] but the teacher in school have not said
[11:58] anything yet but he said that's good to
[12:00] go ahead and
[12:01] refer her to the eye doctor for
[12:03] preventive measure
[12:04] i took her to the eye doctor they did a
[12:07] test again
[12:08] and again she had an issue again to say
[12:10] the letters out
[12:11] and they prescribed to her eyeglasses
[12:14] and then i was like at this age wearing
[12:16] eyeglasses it's not really easy and
[12:18] she's small she has to wear this for the
[12:20] whole
[12:21] her entire life i took her to another
[12:23] eye doctor to have a second opinion
[12:26] and it was something and even the second
[12:28] doctor prescott behind those of the
[12:29] eyeglasses
[12:31] and i told her okay they said you have
[12:34] to wear eyeglasses you have to choose
[12:36] the firm that you want so they can put
[12:38] whatever they have to put in the
[12:39] eyeglasses
[12:40] she chose the eyeglasses and i said the
[12:43] doctor said you have to wear this all
[12:45] the time
[12:46] and she said she went for a few days and
[12:48] after she said mama i don't want to wear
[12:50] eyeglasses because i don't want to look
[12:52] like a scientist or a teacher i said
[12:54] but you have to wear this because they
[12:56] say you have to wait
[12:58] and i was it on that 2019 i remember it
[13:01] was in november i had an accident i
[13:03] didn't go to church
[13:04] on that sunday and we met we went to a
[13:07] wedding
[13:08] on that sunday evening and brother
[13:11] stephen was called to pray
[13:13] just to spread before the wedding
[13:15] started
[13:16] and when he was praying i can feel the
[13:18] anointing coming out of him where i was
[13:20] sitting i was like
[13:21] oh my god does he really feel that he
[13:23] had that strong anointing on him
[13:25] and that was it and then my husband and
[13:28] i were left with her home
[13:30] and it happened at the same sunday
[13:32] evening they came to my house to say hi
[13:33] to my mother-in-law
[13:35] as we were talking most of the time we
[13:37] talked about the word of god and i say
[13:38] how was the church you preaching the
[13:39] church tell me what was happening in the
[13:41] church he preached to me
[13:42] he told me what happened in the church
[13:44] as he was talking to me i can feel again
[13:46] that strong anointing and in my heart i
[13:48] felt like to ask him to pray for my
[13:50] daughter because i was really sure that
[13:52] if he prayed
[13:53] my daughter would be here but for some
[13:55] reason i got distracted i didn't ask him
[13:58] and then when he left like oh my god i
[14:00] should ask him to pray for my daughter
[14:02] what happened
[14:03] i said lord if you give me another
[14:05] opportunity i'll ask him to
[14:07] to pray for my daughter a year after
[14:09] again i went to the doctor i
[14:11] office again he had the same issue they
[14:13] referred me again to the doctor to the
[14:15] eye doctor i said i don't want to go
[14:16] there because
[14:17] she doesn't know what she doesn't want
[14:18] to wear the eyeglasses they said you
[14:21] still have to go because you have to
[14:22] encourage her
[14:23] otherwise she might have trouble seeing
[14:26] i said okay that's fine i took her
[14:28] the same issue this time they gave a
[14:30] higher dose of eyeglasses
[14:32] i took her to the eyeglasses to buy
[14:36] eyeglasses that said now you have to
[14:37] choose the best one that you would like
[14:39] because you have to wear this
[14:40] i'm spending a lot of money on these
[14:42] glasses and you're not wearing them she
[14:44] chose she said mom at this time i'm
[14:45] going to wear eyeglasses i said okay
[14:46] that's fine
[14:48] and then she wore the eyeglasses for a
[14:50] few days again she said mama i don't
[14:52] want to wear eyeglasses i said okay
[14:53] you say don't want to wear eggless see
[14:55] the lord see able to hear
[14:57] to hear you because he's a healer we
[14:59] pray
[15:00] and everything was fine and then it
[15:02] happened that last year
[15:04] i was around my brother's wedding but
[15:06] stephen was at my house
[15:08] and they asked him to dismiss because he
[15:10] they was ready to leave
[15:12] and i told him please whenever you
[15:14] prayed for this message just remember my
[15:15] daughter abigail
[15:16] in prayer because she has an eye issue
[15:20] and she doesn't want to wear eyeglasses
[15:22] and he prayed at that time after he
[15:25] prayed for my daughter i believe
[15:27] on august the 28th i don't know where i
[15:29] was
[15:30] i just had a strong conviction in my
[15:32] heart like a voice telling me that
[15:33] abigail is here from her eye
[15:34] issue i was like oh lord you told me but
[15:37] i'm not really sure the doctor said they
[15:38] have to confirm that
[15:40] and then yesterday i took her to the
[15:42] doctor office
[15:43] again they told her to cover her eyes
[15:45] and this time she was much better myself
[15:47] i noticed that
[15:48] she only said instead of saying he she
[15:51] said f instead of saying f she said eat
[15:53] and they told us to wait for the doctor
[15:56] and sooner the doctor came in the office
[15:57] he said oh
[15:58] abigail you're doing just fine you don't
[16:00] need to wear eyeglasses anymore or go to
[16:02] the doctor's office
[16:04] and i was like praise the lord we pray
[16:06] for this issue the lord has healed us
[16:08] began i'm so happy
[16:10] i called my husband i told him about the
[16:14] issue
[16:14] we're all happy in the evening time my
[16:17] husband was eating i told him since
[16:19] you're eating i'm just gonna go and get
[16:20] the girl ready for night because they
[16:22] have to wake up in the morning to go to
[16:24] school
[16:25] i went up i started to my kid and i
[16:27] remember the lord told me that on this
[16:29] day abigail was here
[16:31] i said i pray with them i said oh i
[16:33] remember writing this down let me just
[16:35] go and check my
[16:36] red on my notebook and see when was the
[16:38] date
[16:39] i went on my notebook and i saw was
[16:41] exactly on august
[16:42] 28 2008 or 2020 where the lord has told
[16:46] me abigail was here
[16:47] so i'm just happy that the lord has
[16:49] really honored her faith because she
[16:51] defeated my faith i was encouraging her
[16:54] to wear eye glasses but she was like
[16:55] mama i don't want to wear eyeglasses
[16:57] so i just want to thank the lord for
[16:59] giving her that strong faith
[17:01] and for honoring our faith

[17:09] for us

[25:44] [Music]
[25:46] did you listen you caught up
[25:49] [Laughter]
[25:52] if you are not make sure you guided
[25:57] because we're going to get into more
[25:59] territory
[26:00] of the black dog amen
[26:04] don't run from the church
[26:08] stay in the church we're going to get in
[26:11] the nail
[26:12] get in the hair we already touched the
[26:15] painted eyes
[26:17] not that you're doing it because the
[26:20] fight has been
[26:22] where is he written in the bible where
[26:24] is he written in the bible
[26:26] this is only brother branham who says
[26:28] that
[26:29] not even having the knowledge that the
[26:32] message
[26:32] is perfectly lined up with the scripture
[26:36] so now if you're not doing it that's
[26:38] fine
[26:40] if you're doing it it's god grace that
[26:42] is coming to unfold it to you that it's
[26:44] not about a religion
[26:46] it is a life amen so now you're going to
[26:49] see in the scripture
[26:50] why does brother branham says this and
[26:52] never give you a scripture
[26:54] you're going to see it in the scripture
[26:55] that okay this is the reason why we
[26:57] don't put makeup
[26:58] this is the reason why we don't keep
[27:00] nails this is the reason why we don't
[27:01] have high heels
[27:02] all of them we're going to pull them up
[27:04] from the scripture one
[27:06] by one so when you talk to somebody and
[27:09] they say
[27:10] you message believer you're wearing
[27:11] shoes like this you say it's not me
[27:13] it's the word amen not my pastor
[27:17] remember
[27:18] only the bible says brother branham say
[27:20] the bible say brother branham said when
[27:22] you are there
[27:24] ministering then you pull the sword you
[27:27] say it is written
[27:28] it is written it is written it is
[27:31] written
[27:31] that's the way you're going to defeat
[27:33] him everywhere
[27:35] anytime anywhere under any
[27:38] circumstances amen so make sure you are
[27:42] caught up
[27:42] because on sunday we're gonna pull up a
[27:44] little bit and go deeper amen
[27:47] you already know the principle of the
[27:49] god of variety
[27:51] the god of big mountain little mountain
[27:54] tall people
[27:55] short people but all of us we are
[27:58] wonderful christian
[27:59] amen wonderful creature wonderfully made
[28:03] marvelous work amen so you must be proud
[28:06] of what god
[28:07] made you if he made you tall you're
[28:10] proud of it remember sunday
[28:12] he made you short like zacchaeus you're
[28:14] proud of it
[28:15] whatever god puts you in you're proud of
[28:18] it
[28:18] god gives you a black tone be proud of
[28:22] it
[28:22] cherish it a white one be proud of it a
[28:25] nation
[28:26] be proud and stay under your category
[28:30] if you understand that principle you
[28:32] won't have a trouble
[28:33] with brother branham amen people missed
[28:36] the prophet
[28:37] and they thought brother branham was a
[28:39] racist he was not a racist
[28:41] go back to the scripture lay the
[28:43] principle of the god of variety you're
[28:45] gonna see that he's a god
[28:47] that have his bread like a bouquet amen
[28:50] out of every kindred every nation every
[28:53] tongue
[28:54] he's pulling his bread and that's the
[28:56] way we're gonna be in the resurrection
[28:57] and that's the way we're going to
[28:59] stay for eternity amen and brother
[29:02] branham even say when he created you the
[29:04] way you are
[29:05] he's actually expressing himself by the
[29:08] way he's creating you
[29:09] amen so if god created you tall you must
[29:13] be proud to be told
[29:14] you must be happy to be told and you
[29:17] must cherish that height
[29:19] if god created you to be a little bit
[29:21] shorter stay that way
[29:22] don't put on high heel because actually
[29:27] going the right of michael jackson you
[29:29] are insulting
[29:31] the maker because he's the one that made
[29:33] your nose the way it is
[29:35] amen i have another scripture
[29:38] for sunday where you're gonna see god
[29:40] did it for
[29:41] not only on last sunday we seen that
[29:43] it's only it's for his pleasure
[29:45] but on sunday i'm gonna give you a
[29:47] scripture where the bible say he did it
[29:50] for his own glory
[29:52] amen he did it for his own glory
[29:56] so you there is a way you must cherish
[29:59] the glory of god
[30:00] amen and keep it just the way god
[30:04] did it i'm not talking about if you sick
[30:08] because if you sick that's not correct
[30:11] amen
[30:12] in john chapter 9 there was a man
[30:16] that was born how blind
[30:20] and they asked jesus the question who
[30:22] did committed sin
[30:23] was it him or his parent jesus said this
[30:26] one
[30:26] i am the one who look at the
[30:29] manufacturing
[30:31] i am the one who say omit this when i'm
[30:34] gonna come up i'm gonna heal him for the
[30:36] glory of god
[30:37] amen that's why when you seek you need
[30:40] to strive to go back to health
[30:42] amen anything if you're born with a club
[30:45] foot or whatever it is that's the reason
[30:47] why he's the high priest that can be
[30:49] touched by the feeling of your what
[30:51] infirmities amen
[30:53] because he wants you to look exactly
[30:56] like the picture
[30:57] he had in the mind that sometimes the
[31:00] sins of the parent
[31:01] the sins that happen the smoking of
[31:04] cigarette
[31:04] can affect a child and then destroy the
[31:07] eyes
[31:08] now you need to go back to the original
[31:10] funding creation
[31:11] that's why the third pool when it's
[31:13] coming up missing lamps will pop up
[31:16] why does the power of the third part
[31:18] bring missing lamps
[31:19] because you must go back to the original
[31:21] creation where you're going to be
[31:23] perfectly fine
[31:24] perfectly here perfectly uh happy
[31:27] just the way god created you amen so
[31:32] stay
[31:32] deep in prayer it is the holy spirit
[31:35] working
[31:36] amen some of you if you caught it on
[31:39] sunday

[44:39] amen amen matthew chapter 16 verse
[44:44] 13 when jesus came into the coast of
[44:47] caesarea philippi
[44:48] he asked his disciples saying whom do
[44:52] men say that i the son of man am
[44:55] and they said some say that thou art
[44:58] john the baptist
[45:00] some elias and others
[45:03] jeremiah or one of the prophets
[45:06] and he saith unto them but whom say ye
[45:10] that i
[45:11] am and simon peter answered and said
[45:15] thou art the christ the son of the
[45:19] living god
[45:20] and jesus answered and said unto him
[45:24] blessed art thou simon bar jonah for
[45:26] flesh
[45:27] and blood hath not revealed it unto thee
[45:30] but my father which is in heaven
[45:32] and i say also unto thee that thou art
[45:35] peter
[45:36] and upon this rock i will build
[45:40] my church he's going to have a church
[45:44] and he's going to be the builder of it
[45:47] and
[45:47] the gates of hell shall not prevail
[45:51] against it and i will give unto thee
[45:55] the keys of the kingdom of heaven and
[45:57] whatsoever thou
[45:58] shalt bind on earth shall be bound in
[46:01] heaven
[46:02] and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[46:04] shall be loosed in heaven
[46:06] then charged he his disciples that they
[46:09] should tell no man
[46:10] that he was jesus the christ may the
[46:13] lord bless the reading of his word as
[46:15] you're seated
[46:16] this evening i want to speak for the
[46:18] next
[46:20] the next little while we'll try to be
[46:23] conscious of the time but
[46:26] we want the lord to have his way tonight
[46:28] and we always
[46:29] feel a welcome spirit to the word of god
[46:32] when we come here and we thank the lord
[46:33] for that
[46:34] we want to speak tonight on the
[46:36] prevailing power
[46:38] of revelation amen the prevailing power
[46:42] of revelation jesus said the gates of
[46:45] hell
[46:46] shall not prevail against it
[46:49] they're going to try they're going to
[46:52] fight and they're going to battle and
[46:53] they're going to do everything they can
[46:55] to stop
[46:56] it but jesus said the gates of hell
[46:59] shall not prevail against it jesus
[47:02] was establishing the basis or the
[47:05] foundation
[47:06] that his church would be built on now
[47:09] there's going to be all kinds of people
[47:11] there's going to be all kinds of
[47:12] churches there's going to be all kinds
[47:14] of ideas
[47:15] and all kinds of religions there's going
[47:18] to be all kinds of religious leaders
[47:20] rise up
[47:21] and and attract a following and a
[47:23] religion be formed as a result of that
[47:26] but there's going to be one that's his
[47:29] amen
[47:30] he's going to have one jesus said i'm
[47:32] going to have a church
[47:33] and i'm going to be i'm going to build
[47:36] it and this
[47:36] is what it's going to be built upon and
[47:39] it cannot be defeated
[47:41] amen it would be the revelation of
[47:45] himself
[47:46] that would give the church the power
[47:49] to be invincible amen not just to defend
[47:54] the attack of satan
[47:55] amen not not just to come away with a
[47:57] few wounds or a few casualties
[48:00] but the the power of the revelation of
[48:02] jesus christ
[48:04] to the individual to the church amen
[48:07] would be an invincible power against
[48:11] every attack of satan
[48:14] no matter what weapon he employs amen no
[48:17] matter what he tries
[48:18] amen no matter how powerful the attack
[48:21] he puts against the church
[48:23] we have already been given the assurance
[48:25] amen
[48:26] that the power of revelation will make
[48:29] us invincible against every attack of
[48:32] satan
[48:35] amen and the prophet of god says here in
[48:38] the revelation of jesus christ
[48:40] he says it is the revelation of god
[48:44] that will give you authority over
[48:47] the devil amen it is the revelation of
[48:51] god
[48:51] that will give you amen every every man
[48:55] every woman every child amen every
[48:59] husband every housewife amen you may not
[49:02] have an
[49:02] education you may not have a dime in the
[49:05] bank account
[49:06] but if you've got this revelation you
[49:09] have authority
[49:10] over the devil tonight amen
[49:14] and you can see why they who would add
[49:16] or take away from it would be cursed
[49:19] it would have to be so for who can add
[49:22] or take away
[49:23] from the perfect revelation of god and
[49:26] overcome the enemy it is that simple
[49:30] there is nothing of such prevailing
[49:32] power
[49:33] as the revelation of the word
[49:37] amen now i'm not going to turn to it
[49:39] tonight but you can read this in daniel
[49:41] chapter 10
[49:42] if you would like to to to look at it
[49:44] later
[49:45] daniel kneels by the riverside one day
[49:50] the river is the river high decal and he
[49:52] begins
[49:53] praying for revelation
[49:56] he has seen uh he in chapter 9
[50:00] he realized by books that he was
[50:03] in the time of the fulfillment of
[50:05] jeremiah's prophecy
[50:07] and so he he he he didn't just want a
[50:10] general idea
[50:11] of where he was in the unfolding he
[50:14] wanted to know exactly where he was
[50:16] so he began praying and in chapter 9
[50:19] this takes place
[50:20] and then in chapter 10 it happens again
[50:22] i think some years later
[50:24] so that this time daniel begins praying
[50:27] for revelation
[50:28] and the bible says that for 21 days
[50:34] daniel prayed and he fasted
[50:37] he stayed right there on his knees
[50:41] praying for revelation for
[50:44] 21 days and when the angel
[50:47] finally reached daniel he said daniel
[50:50] i'm
[50:51] come to give you wisdom and
[50:53] understanding
[50:55] for this is great he said this is
[50:57] actually something that's going to take
[50:59] place
[51:00] in the latter days but i'm going to
[51:02] reveal it to you now
[51:04] but he said and he said daniel i i
[51:07] hadn't been waiting 21 days
[51:09] to to start my journey here he said i
[51:13] started here on day one he said from the
[51:16] moment you begin praying for revelation
[51:19] i started my way to come and bring it to
[51:22] you
[51:23] but he said daniel something happened
[51:26] that's
[51:27] never happened before in all the history
[51:30] of the bible
[51:31] we don't have a recorded instance where
[51:33] it took
[51:34] 21 days for something one of his
[51:37] children was praying for
[51:38] to be answered and to be heard
[51:42] so why would satan fight
[51:46] this so hard
[51:51] i wonder why and you might have a good
[51:54] idea tonight
[51:56] of why but i want us just to take this
[51:58] for a moment
[51:59] and maybe imagine a little dramatization
[52:03] what may have begun taking place in
[52:07] other realms when daniel knelt by the
[52:10] riverside
[52:11] and began praying for revelation now we
[52:15] know the devil
[52:16] is roaming to and fro seeking whom he
[52:19] may devour
[52:20] he's got evil spirits spread all over
[52:23] the earth
[52:24] amen to steal to kill and to destroy
[52:29] amen to entice to tempt amen to destroy
[52:33] the lives of men
[52:34] and women boys and girls he's working
[52:36] around the clock 24 hours a day
[52:39] in all the regions of the earth anywhere
[52:42] souls are present
[52:43] satan is fighting and he's got his
[52:46] demons on
[52:47] missions amen these demons they grow
[52:51] in rank and they grow in uh they gain a
[52:54] victory record they they become
[52:56] skilled at their craft of deception
[53:00] amen of enticement of destroying souls
[53:04] and destroying lives and so
[53:05] they ascend and rank amen they
[53:09] they they they are working all
[53:11] throughout the earth to achieve the
[53:12] devil's purpose
[53:14] and the devil is in headquarters
[53:18] lucifer is at the central command
[53:20] station
[53:22] and he's there giving the assignments
[53:24] and he's watching the effects of these
[53:26] demons
[53:27] and he's he's hearing the reports come
[53:29] back and he knows who the
[53:31] who the uh active demons are and the
[53:33] successful demons and
[53:35] he knows who the juniors are and the the
[53:37] slackers and
[53:38] and the ones who are just getting
[53:40] started you know
[53:42] and the devil's got a big red
[53:45] button on the control panel of hell
[53:51] and this button the purpose of it
[53:54] is to send out a message or a page
[53:57] i guess in today's terms we would say a
[53:59] text
[54:01] to every demon they've got a a device
[54:04] on their side and when this signal goes
[54:08] out the signal is to return
[54:11] to base immediately
[54:14] there is an emergency that requires the
[54:18] attention
[54:19] of every demon and so when daniel
[54:22] knelt by the riverside to begin to pray
[54:26] satan saw what was happening and he goes
[54:29] over
[54:29] and for the first time in history he
[54:32] smashes
[54:33] the red button and so the demons begin
[54:37] streaming in from their their
[54:39] assignments throughout the earth you
[54:41] know some of the slackers
[54:42] they was just right outside the gate it
[54:44] didn't take him any time to get in there
[54:46] and find a seat
[54:47] but some of these senior demons and and
[54:50] the real
[54:50] skill in the ones that had the the top i
[54:53] mean most critical assignments
[54:55] it took them some time to get back
[54:58] because they'd been tempting believers
[55:00] i mean they'd been attempting a new
[55:02] converts and and they've been
[55:04] veteran believers they've been enticing
[55:06] and working against and fighting against
[55:09] mothers and fathers and children pastors
[55:12] and
[55:12] evangelists and they were out here you
[55:14] know in all sorts of missions
[55:18] and this had never happened before so
[55:20] they were wondering
[55:21] what could be so important
[55:25] that for the first time ever this
[55:29] alert is going forth and calling us back
[55:31] to the home base
[55:33] and so they gather in and they're
[55:35] they're all they're all excited
[55:38] they're all you know kind of this has
[55:40] never happened before so they're all
[55:42] wondering in their mind what
[55:46] has prompted this
[55:50] what has caused you know what what is
[55:52] going on
[55:54] and and and they're bumping one another
[55:56] do you know what it is
[55:57] no do you know what it is no and so
[56:00] finally
[56:02] finally the lucifer clears his throat
[56:04] and gets all the demon's attention
[56:07] and he says now you're all wondering why
[56:09] i've gathered you here
[56:10] at such short notice but i want to tell
[56:13] you
[56:14] why i've done this and that is the
[56:16] prophet daniel
[56:18] is kneeling by the river high decal and
[56:21] he's praying for revelation
[56:26] and and some of those demons were
[56:28] disgusted
[56:33] they said did did i hear him correctly
[56:38] uh did the only reason we're here
[56:44] is because one man
[56:47] by the name of daniel
[56:50] is praying for revelation
[56:54] could that be so important that i had to
[56:57] drop
[56:58] everything i was doing and travel all
[57:00] this distance
[57:01] and come back here to headquarters just
[57:04] to hear
[57:05] that daniel the prophet is praying for
[57:07] revelation
[57:09] they began to get upset they begin to
[57:12] you know they get they get angry real
[57:14] easy
[57:15] and so they begin to wonder and so they
[57:17] begin to speak up
[57:19] and said listen here i'll i'll have you
[57:21] to know i was i was
[57:23] tempting a minister to commit adultery
[57:27] and it was just on the verge of him
[57:30] giving in i just felt like i was just
[57:33] right at the threshold
[57:34] of succeeding and then this this beeper
[57:37] went off and i dropped my assignment
[57:39] and came back here and no one spoke up
[57:42] said yeah
[57:43] said i had a young person on the verge
[57:47] of suicide
[57:49] i've been working with them for days and
[57:51] for weeks
[57:52] and for months discouraging and
[57:55] depressing and
[57:56] turning them you're turning their
[57:58] friends against them and turning the
[58:00] church against them and
[58:01] all these different things i've been
[58:03] split up the parents had unbroken home
[58:05] i was brought them through a church
[58:07] split and all these different things and
[58:09] they finally got a bad report card and
[58:12] oh my they're beginning to feel these
[58:14] pressures and
[58:15] was just on the verge of suicide
[58:18] and i dropped the assignment to come
[58:21] back here and then they all
[58:23] had their story and satan finally said
[58:28] i don't need to hear no more this he
[58:31] said this is why you are all junior
[58:34] devils
[58:35] and i'm the chief devil because here's
[58:38] what you don't understand
[58:41] all your efforts to make people commit
[58:43] adultery
[58:44] all your efforts to make people stop
[58:46] going to church
[58:48] all your efforts to split people's homes
[58:50] and marriages and commit suicide
[58:52] and all the other things that you're
[58:55] attempting
[58:56] what you don't realize is that that
[58:58] revelation
[59:00] ever reaches that profit
[59:04] and there's people ever catch that
[59:07] revelation
[59:08] your your suicide your adultery
[59:12] your temptation all your other things
[59:15] your depression
[59:16] your discouragement your church spin and
[59:19] church quinn
[59:20] will all be in vain
[59:23] [Applause]
[59:26] because if that revelation ever strikes
[59:30] those people
[59:32] they will become invincible
[59:35] hallelujah and i will become
[59:39] powerless
[59:43] we don't have enough guns we don't have
[59:46] enough bombs
[59:47] we don't have enough viruses we don't
[59:49] have enough enticements
[59:51] we don't have enough temptations we
[59:53] don't have
[59:54] anything in the playbook
[59:57] for revelation
[1:00:01] [Applause]
[1:00:03] so every one of them began fighting
[1:00:06] every one of them joined swords
[1:00:08] and went out there to try to stop that
[1:00:10] revelation
[1:00:11] but daniel just kept praying he kept
[1:00:14] praying he wasn't like some believers
[1:00:16] they'd give up after five minutes he
[1:00:19] didn't give up after seven days
[1:00:21] he didn't give up after 14 days he
[1:00:24] didn't give up after 21 days
[1:00:27] and he was still praying for the carlos
[1:00:29] he was still seeking it
[1:00:31] because the bible says knock and the
[1:00:34] door shall be opened to you
[1:00:36] seek and ye shall find
[1:00:40] amen he just kept on praying
[1:00:43] kept on pressing amen i'm not asking too
[1:00:46] much of god
[1:00:47] i'm asking for what's rightfully mine
[1:00:49] i'm asking for my inheritance
[1:00:52] you're not asking too much when you ask
[1:00:54] for your children
[1:00:55] you're not asking too much when you ask
[1:00:57] for your husband
[1:00:58] you're not asking too much when you ask
[1:01:00] for your wife you're not asking too much
[1:01:02] when you ask for your healing
[1:01:04] amen god just wants to know are you
[1:01:06] really convinced
[1:01:08] that it's yours because if you are you
[1:01:11] won't stop praying
[1:01:13] you can't be defeated you can't be
[1:01:15] discouraged
[1:01:16] you know where your help comes from amen
[1:01:21] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:01:25] hey man amen
[1:01:29] god's gonna move here tonight amen
[1:01:32] somebody's been praying somebody's been
[1:01:35] believing
[1:01:36] somebody's been holding on god i don't
[1:01:39] see nothing changing but i'm gonna keep
[1:01:41] praying
[1:01:42] i'm gonna keep believing i don't see the
[1:01:44] circumstance i don't see them out there
[1:01:46] moving
[1:01:46] but you said speak to the mountain
[1:01:50] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:01:54] that's the determination of a son and
[1:01:57] daughter of god
[1:01:59] amen oh my
[1:02:07] satan knows if god sends a prophet
[1:02:10] there's a people who are ordained
[1:02:13] to hear and believe that message
[1:02:15] [Applause]
[1:02:17] satan did not even know who all the
[1:02:19] people were but he knew if god had a
[1:02:21] prophet on the scene
[1:02:22] there must be somebody on that earth
[1:02:25] that was gonna hear that prophet
[1:02:27] and believe every word that god
[1:02:30] spoke through his lips amen
[1:02:34] because when god sends a prophet he's
[1:02:37] already got a predestinated people
[1:02:40] you know elijah got to the place one
[1:02:42] time he said lord i'm the only one
[1:02:44] lord it's just me and you i'm the only
[1:02:48] one all my preaching all my prophets
[1:02:50] sign all the judgments all the wrath of
[1:02:52] god
[1:02:53] all the drought and all the red it's
[1:02:56] just me and you
[1:02:58] god said elijah it ain't just me and you
[1:03:01] i got
[1:03:02] seven thousand i got
[1:03:05] seven thousand that you don't even know
[1:03:07] about
[1:03:08] they may not even be born till you go
[1:03:10] off the scene
[1:03:12] but there's seven thousand that is not
[1:03:14] about the need to bail
[1:03:16] they're ordained to hear that message
[1:03:19] god's got a people on the earth tonight
[1:03:21] amen that's ordained to hear the message
[1:03:26] daniel kept praying and the revelation
[1:03:29] prevailed
[1:03:31] the message reached daniel you know the
[1:03:33] message was so great over it took daniel
[1:03:36] two chapters
[1:03:37] to describe it but over over in the
[1:03:40] beginning of chapter 12
[1:03:42] the the the the the the bible says that
[1:03:46] it was such a great vision it was for
[1:03:49] the
[1:03:50] end times when there would be a time of
[1:03:54] trouble such as never was
[1:03:58] since but it also said
[1:04:01] your people will be delivered
[1:04:05] the ones whose names were written
[1:04:09] in the book
[1:04:12] my amen it's going to be terrible times
[1:04:15] there's never been a time like it
[1:04:17] and never be a time after it like it but
[1:04:19] there's a people who will be deliberate
[1:04:21] and their names are written on the book
[1:04:25] amen
[1:04:26] it would have to be sealed up again
[1:04:29] by daniel amen
[1:04:33] it was so wonderful that satan fought
[1:04:35] his hardest
[1:04:37] to keep it from reaching daniel and then
[1:04:40] when it reached him
[1:04:41] and it was explained then he said seal
[1:04:44] it up again
[1:04:47] but it ain't going to stay sealed
[1:04:48] forever
[1:04:50] oh my god this was a jewish prophet
[1:04:55] god said seal it up but i'm gonna bring
[1:04:57] a gentile prophet
[1:05:00] and it's gonna be unsealed again amen
[1:05:05] let me just share some things with you
[1:05:08] now remember this
[1:05:10] brother branham says remember this
[1:05:14] don't let this slip from your memory
[1:05:19] christ in the true church is a
[1:05:22] continuation
[1:05:24] of the book of acts
[1:05:26] [Applause]
[1:05:28] but the book of revelation shows how the
[1:05:30] antichrist spirit
[1:05:32] would come into the church and defile it
[1:05:36] making it lukewarm
[1:05:39] formal and powerless
[1:05:44] any or all of those traits coming upon a
[1:05:47] church
[1:05:48] are an indication that the antichrist
[1:05:51] spirit
[1:05:52] is attempting to defile it
[1:05:57] it exposes satan revealing his works
[1:06:02] the attempted destruction of god's
[1:06:04] people and the discrediting of god's
[1:06:06] word
[1:06:07] right down to the time he is cast into
[1:06:10] the lake of fire
[1:06:12] he fights that he cannot
[1:06:15] stand it he knows that
[1:06:19] if the people get the true
[1:06:22] revelation of the true church
[1:06:25] and what she is and what she stands for
[1:06:30] and that she can do the greater works
[1:06:34] she will be an invincible
[1:06:38] army if they get a true revelation of
[1:06:42] the two
[1:06:42] spirits within the framework of the
[1:06:45] christian church
[1:06:46] and by god's spirit
[1:06:50] discern and
[1:06:53] withstand it oh
[1:06:57] my you say brother tim i can see what's
[1:07:00] happening well that's discerning
[1:07:03] that's discernment thank god you can see
[1:07:05] what's happening
[1:07:06] but now the next thing is can you
[1:07:08] withstand what's happening
[1:07:11] oh brother tim it's just oh brother tim
[1:07:14] i'm not a preacher
[1:07:16] i'm not even a choir leader i'm not a
[1:07:18] sunday school teacher
[1:07:20] i just warmed the pew
[1:07:23] well let me give you a little insight to
[1:07:26] when the
[1:07:26] antichrist spirit tries to creep into
[1:07:29] the church
[1:07:30] and how you can discern and withstand it
[1:07:33] this probably never happens at this
[1:07:36] assembly
[1:07:37] but let's just say hypothetically
[1:07:40] speaking
[1:07:41] coming to church on sunday morning
[1:07:44] and it's cold outside and the car
[1:07:47] wouldn't hardly start
[1:07:48] and the kids forgot their shoes and
[1:07:51] somebody spilled a coffee all over your
[1:07:54] suit or your brand new dress
[1:07:56] and then you come into the church just a
[1:07:59] little bit late
[1:08:00] and your least favorite song leader is
[1:08:02] up at this pulpit
[1:08:04] and your least favorite musicians are
[1:08:05] playing the music
[1:08:07] and nothing is going your way and the
[1:08:09] service is feeling a little sticky
[1:08:11] and a little cold and a little tight
[1:08:15] the antichrist spirit wants to make it
[1:08:19] lukewarm formal
[1:08:22] and powerless so to just
[1:08:25] blend in it would be the natural
[1:08:28] tendency to try to slip in
[1:08:30] find your seat and make as little
[1:08:33] disturbance
[1:08:34] as possible and just hope by the time
[1:08:37] the pastor makes it up to the pulpit
[1:08:39] he can salvage this service
[1:08:42] but that is not discerning and
[1:08:46] withstanding
[1:08:49] when you walk into church and you
[1:08:51] realize the devil has been
[1:08:52] fighting me from the time i woke up this
[1:08:55] morning
[1:08:56] he fought through the spouse he fought
[1:08:58] through the children
[1:08:59] he fought through the car he fought
[1:09:01] through everything he could
[1:09:03] to defeat me in this service not only
[1:09:06] that that is my least favorite song
[1:09:08] they're singing
[1:09:09] and the least favorite they're playing
[1:09:11] but i'm gonna withstand
[1:09:14] i'm gonna clap my hands i'm gonna stomp
[1:09:17] my feet
[1:09:18] i'm gonna lift my heads i'm going to
[1:09:20] lift my voice
[1:09:21] i'm not going to blend in i'm going to
[1:09:24] create
[1:09:25] a disturbance in this service i'm going
[1:09:28] to let the devil know
[1:09:29] whose side i'm off i'm going to
[1:09:31] withstand that
[1:09:32] spirit that wants to kill me down
[1:09:37] cool me off and make me powerless
[1:09:40] and formal you don't have to be a
[1:09:43] preacher
[1:09:44] you don't have to be a sunday school
[1:09:46] teacher all you got to do is have
[1:09:48] hands and a voice amen
[1:09:51] a lot of us could cast out devils just
[1:09:53] by clapping our hands
[1:09:55] and lifting our voice amen and say i'm
[1:09:58] going to praise god
[1:09:59] whether i feel like it or not and any
[1:10:02] devil that's brave enough to stay on my
[1:10:04] back
[1:10:05] will just have to tolerate me while i
[1:10:07] get on and praise god
[1:10:10] hallelujah i didn't come here to be
[1:10:13] given something
[1:10:14] i come here to get something i come here
[1:10:17] to lay hold
[1:10:18] on what's mine god can take that pasture
[1:10:21] off his sermon
[1:10:22] off his notes and speak just what i need
[1:10:26] amen i'll take it from the devil if i
[1:10:29] have to
[1:10:31] amen if they discern and withstand the
[1:10:36] antichrist spirit
[1:10:38] satan will be powerless
[1:10:42] before her he will be as definitely
[1:10:46] thwarted today
[1:10:47] as when christ withstood his every
[1:10:49] effort to gain power over him
[1:10:51] in the desert yes
[1:10:55] satan hates revelation
[1:10:58] but we love it
[1:11:01] hallelujah amen he says with true
[1:11:05] revelation and he doesn't say in our
[1:11:08] minds
[1:11:10] or in our heads he says with true
[1:11:13] revelation in our lives
[1:11:17] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[1:11:22] us
[1:11:23] but we will prevail over them
[1:11:28] so so jesus asked this question in
[1:11:30] matthew 16
[1:11:32] whom do men say that i the son of man
[1:11:34] and
[1:11:36] and it just it's interesting to me that
[1:11:40] everything they said spoke of former
[1:11:42] characters
[1:11:44] some say you're elias some say you're
[1:11:47] jeremiah's
[1:11:49] some say you're one of the prophets they
[1:11:51] all mention
[1:11:52] a historical person
[1:11:56] whose life had made a significant impact
[1:11:58] on the earth
[1:11:59] but yet they were dead they had fallen
[1:12:03] subject to the curse of sin
[1:12:06] that adam brought into the earth
[1:12:10] oh my and all they could say was maybe
[1:12:13] you
[1:12:14] are a a relapse
[1:12:17] or a resurrection or
[1:12:20] a revisiting you know maybe you're the
[1:12:22] sequel
[1:12:24] to some previous act
[1:12:28] or display oh my
[1:12:32] but i want to tell you he's not the i
[1:12:34] was
[1:12:36] he's the i am
[1:12:37] [Applause]
[1:12:39] amen and you know jesus
[1:12:42] jesus didn't call the world to be his
[1:12:44] disciples and he wasn't so interested in
[1:12:47] the public polls
[1:12:48] so we made the question more direct
[1:12:52] and he said but who do you
[1:12:56] say that i am
[1:12:59] because this would really be the
[1:13:01] vindication
[1:13:03] that his disciples that he had chosen
[1:13:06] were actually his attributes
[1:13:10] and had the ability amen to become
[1:13:14] microphones for the same voice
[1:13:18] that was speaking through him he said i
[1:13:21] do nothing till the father shows me
[1:13:23] amen so he was he was really he was
[1:13:25] wanting to hear something more
[1:13:27] than their mind he was wanting to hear
[1:13:30] something more than their
[1:13:32] emotions or how they were feeling
[1:13:35] just at the moment so when he asked the
[1:13:39] question the second time and he made it
[1:13:41] personal
[1:13:43] something spoke through peter
[1:13:46] that was obviously from a different
[1:13:48] source
[1:13:50] than most everything that peter had ever
[1:13:53] said before
[1:13:54] [Applause]
[1:13:56] because when this voice spoke through
[1:13:58] peter's lips
[1:13:59] he said thou art the christ
[1:14:05] exclusive he wasn't ashamed to say it
[1:14:08] you're the only one thou art the christ
[1:14:13] the son of the living
[1:14:17] god amen in so many words he was saying
[1:14:21] you are jehovah of the old testament
[1:14:25] you are that god in spirit form amen to
[1:14:27] reveal itself in
[1:14:28] all matter of expressions
[1:14:32] but now you have become flesh
[1:14:35] now you have become humanity now you
[1:14:38] have become a kinsmen
[1:14:40] thou art the christ
[1:14:44] the son of the living god
[1:14:47] amen you know in order for you to know
[1:14:51] who you
[1:14:51] are you first have to recognize who he
[1:14:54] is
[1:14:56] and after peter recognized who christ
[1:14:58] was christ
[1:15:00] immediately responds and says and thou
[1:15:03] art peter
[1:15:05] [Applause]
[1:15:07] thou art peter amen now that he has
[1:15:10] had established who christ was christ
[1:15:13] was going to establish who he was
[1:15:15] thou art peter and upon this rock i'll
[1:15:17] build my church
[1:15:18] and the gates of hell shall never
[1:15:20] prevail against him
[1:15:22] and he went on to say i'll give you the
[1:15:23] keys to the kingdom
[1:15:25] whatsoever you bind on earth i'll bind
[1:15:27] in heaven
[1:15:28] whatsoever you loose on earth i'll loose
[1:15:30] in heaven
[1:15:32] so the voice that spoke from peter
[1:15:34] wasn't his mind
[1:15:36] it wasn't his thinking but it came from
[1:15:39] something god had deposited there
[1:15:43] eternal representation
[1:15:46] gained a voice amen the same thing that
[1:15:50] made him leave his nets
[1:15:51] and follow christ
[1:15:54] peter this doesn't happen to just
[1:15:58] anybody
[1:16:01] some call them blc bob some call them
[1:16:04] illegitimate
[1:16:06] but here peter calls him the christ
[1:16:08] peter this doesn't happen to just
[1:16:10] anybody
[1:16:11] but you have recognized the manifested
[1:16:15] word
[1:16:16] in your hour you
[1:16:20] are blessed amen
[1:16:24] now you know only a few verses later
[1:16:28] jesus begins to tell them
[1:16:31] how he's going to become
[1:16:35] their sacrifice how he's going to be
[1:16:38] taken
[1:16:38] and tried and crucified and buried
[1:16:42] and peter says oh no lord
[1:16:45] peter's uh you know peter's
[1:16:49] own ideas of what jesus
[1:16:52] ministry would mean and do in his his
[1:16:55] own involvement with that
[1:16:57] begin to try to block
[1:17:00] the very purpose and the very key
[1:17:05] that would enable peter to become a
[1:17:07] recipient
[1:17:08] of the holy spirit indwelling
[1:17:12] not just an anointing but in a feeling
[1:17:15] amen
[1:17:16] so when peter begins to speak oh no lord
[1:17:18] they'll never they'll ever take you
[1:17:20] they'll never
[1:17:21] they'll never take you captive they'll
[1:17:22] never crucify you jesus said
[1:17:24] get behind me satan
[1:17:28] so peter made misstatements
[1:17:32] but jesus did not excommunicate him
[1:17:35] he knew the revelation would prevail
[1:17:39] and when peter was filled with the holy
[1:17:42] spirit on the day of pentecost amen
[1:17:44] and when he come out into the streets
[1:17:47] and the world said what mean is this
[1:17:50] when peter began speaking jesus never
[1:17:53] had to retract his statement
[1:17:57] jesus never had to apologize anymore
[1:17:59] jesus never had to cover up
[1:18:01] peter's mistake because now the same
[1:18:04] voice that spoke to jesus
[1:18:06] was now speaking through peter as his
[1:18:09] mouthpiece amen
[1:18:10] and he said these men aren't drunk as
[1:18:12] you suppose
[1:18:13] [Applause]
[1:18:17] and now peter was able to identify
[1:18:23] his behaviors as having
[1:18:26] a scriptural origin
[1:18:30] and that a prophecy hundreds of years
[1:18:34] old
[1:18:35] was no longer a potential
[1:18:39] waiting to be fulfilled but peter was
[1:18:41] saying
[1:18:42] i am the potential of that prophecy
[1:18:47] this is that that was spoken by the
[1:18:50] prophet joel
[1:18:51] what you are seeing display now is the
[1:18:55] continuation amen
[1:18:56] is the written word becoming living word
[1:19:01] amen i always like to say peter never
[1:19:04] denied they were drunk
[1:19:06] he didn't deny they were drunk he just
[1:19:08] said we're not drunk as you suppose
[1:19:10] he was quite drunk but he wasn't drunk
[1:19:13] with natural wine
[1:19:14] he was drunk with the stimulation of
[1:19:17] revelation amen
[1:19:19] and it made him appear intoxicated
[1:19:22] because you know when a person is
[1:19:24] intoxicated
[1:19:26] they lose some of their feeling things
[1:19:29] that would once hurt them
[1:19:30] don't hurt as much oh my
[1:19:33] friend i think if we get good and drunk
[1:19:36] in the holy spirit
[1:19:37] [Applause]
[1:19:38] maybe things that bother us right now
[1:19:40] would not bother us so much
[1:19:43] if we were just good and intoxicated by
[1:19:46] the holy ghost
[1:19:47] and you could just forgive your brother
[1:19:49] forgive your sister
[1:19:51] you can just brush off those little
[1:19:53] things amen that bother you right now
[1:19:55] and say oh it's no problem i'm still a
[1:19:58] son of god
[1:19:59] i'm still a daughter of god nothing's
[1:20:01] going to change that
[1:20:02] i'm not worried about it i'm going in
[1:20:04] the rapture
[1:20:06] amen hallelujah
[1:20:10] i believe in spiritual drunkenness
[1:20:14] i believe in drinking of the new wine
[1:20:17] man and maybe it's gonna bust some old
[1:20:19] bottles
[1:20:20] but i want some and say man new skins to
[1:20:24] put that wine in
[1:20:26] oh my i've got to move along but
[1:20:31] do you believe the prophet of god said
[1:20:33] that john
[1:20:34] the revelator was a type of the true
[1:20:38] overcomer in each or
[1:20:41] every age you believe that i believe he
[1:20:46] was
[1:20:46] also and so here we move
[1:20:50] over into revelation chapter five
[1:20:54] this is one of my favorite chapters of
[1:20:56] the bible
[1:20:58] and here we see a scene taking place
[1:21:02] now we know the story john was banished
[1:21:04] to patmos
[1:21:06] for the word of god and the testimony of
[1:21:08] jesus christ
[1:21:09] and we know that patmos was an island
[1:21:11] for
[1:21:12] criminals to be sent to die
[1:21:15] because they were unfit to dwell with
[1:21:17] regular society
[1:21:19] all hope was gone or lost that they
[1:21:22] would ever become productive citizens
[1:21:24] so they were all banished to patmos to
[1:21:26] die as the worst criminals
[1:21:29] and a holy ghost pastor
[1:21:33] was classified as one of the worst
[1:21:37] criminals they they grouped him right in
[1:21:40] with the worst death row they just sent
[1:21:44] him to death row
[1:21:46] you say well i want a pastor i can be
[1:21:47] proud of
[1:21:49] i want to i want a pastor amen that that
[1:21:52] gets big headlines in the paper and and
[1:21:55] it's a relationship with the mayor of
[1:21:57] the city and
[1:21:58] and the governor of the state and and
[1:22:00] the pastor that when the president comes
[1:22:02] to charlotte
[1:22:03] he wants to shake his head friend if
[1:22:05] that's the kind of pastor you're looking
[1:22:07] for
[1:22:08] about the only affiliation i ever see a
[1:22:10] holy ghost minister
[1:22:11] having with a king or a leader is a
[1:22:14] trial
[1:22:17] where he's being tried for what he
[1:22:19] preached he's been falsely accused for
[1:22:22] what he believed
[1:22:23] amen and so the preachers standing there
[1:22:25] trying to convince felix
[1:22:27] trying to convince agrippa trying to
[1:22:29] convince herod and even
[1:22:30] hey you need to believe this too you
[1:22:33] need to be saved too
[1:22:34] amen paul was still evangelizing
[1:22:38] and he said almost now persuades me to
[1:22:40] be a christian paul
[1:22:42] that's about the only association with
[1:22:44] the world leader a holy ghost field
[1:22:46] minister is ever going to have
[1:22:48] the rest of the time they're going to be
[1:22:49] in prison they're going to be in jail
[1:22:52] they're going to be in stocks and bonds
[1:22:53] but the angel of the lord will be there
[1:22:55] to deliver them out
[1:22:57] amen so we understand the circumstances
[1:23:02] of the isle of patmos and here is john
[1:23:07] placed in these conditions but he said
[1:23:10] i was in the spirit on the lord's day
[1:23:15] that just shows you no matter what's
[1:23:17] going on around you
[1:23:19] you can still be in the spirit and in
[1:23:22] chapter 5 of revelation he says and i
[1:23:24] saw in the right hand of him that sat on
[1:23:26] the throne
[1:23:27] a book written within and on the
[1:23:29] backside
[1:23:31] sealed with seven seals and i saw a
[1:23:34] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[1:23:36] voice
[1:23:37] who is worthy to open the book and to
[1:23:40] loose the seals thereof
[1:23:42] and no man in heaven nor in earth
[1:23:45] neither
[1:23:46] under the earth was able to open the
[1:23:49] book
[1:23:50] neither to look there on
[1:23:54] now catch what to me
[1:23:57] is a key and i'm not a teacher your
[1:24:00] pastor is a real teacher
[1:24:02] but what i see in this is the same
[1:24:05] worthiness that it took to open the book
[1:24:10] was equivalent to the worthiness that
[1:24:13] was required
[1:24:15] to look upon the book
[1:24:20] now that's a key because at this point
[1:24:24] no man was worthy no man was found
[1:24:27] worthy
[1:24:28] and so in verse 4
[1:24:31] we find john's emotional
[1:24:35] condition it was not the circumstances
[1:24:40] of patmos
[1:24:41] that made him this way it was not the
[1:24:44] rejection
[1:24:45] of his peers or his community
[1:24:48] or the jewish religion that made him
[1:24:51] this way there was one thing that placed
[1:24:53] john
[1:24:54] in this condition and i wept much
[1:24:58] because no man was found worthy to open
[1:25:02] to read the book neither to look there
[1:25:05] on
[1:25:06] [Music]
[1:25:08] not as some people has taught it i was
[1:25:11] hearing a man teach this one time
[1:25:13] said john wept because that he found
[1:25:14] himself not worthy
[1:25:17] oh any man under the holy spirit would
[1:25:20] know different from that see
[1:25:22] under the inspiration of god would no
[1:25:24] different from that but
[1:25:25] john wept here's what i think he wept
[1:25:28] for
[1:25:28] now i'm interested in what a prophet
[1:25:31] thinks
[1:25:32] here's what i think he wept for because
[1:25:35] if no one was worthy and could open
[1:25:37] this book of redemption
[1:25:41] the whole creation
[1:25:45] was lost everything from
[1:25:48] adam on was lost
[1:25:52] now remember this is the man
[1:25:57] who stood at the foot of the cross
[1:26:01] he did not forsake jesus at calvary
[1:26:05] he was still there he saw
[1:26:08] the blood dripping down
[1:26:11] he's he heard jesus last words
[1:26:14] he was there at the tomb
[1:26:18] the morning it was discovered
[1:26:21] that he was not there
[1:26:24] he was not as they had left him
[1:26:28] but he was risen and john had
[1:26:31] met the resurrected christ had
[1:26:34] witnessed the glorified body amen had
[1:26:37] dined
[1:26:38] amen of fishes and they were uh baked
[1:26:41] over rolled over the fire amen
[1:26:43] and had seen the ascension of jesus
[1:26:45] christ
[1:26:46] into glory and had been at pentecost
[1:26:49] when the holy ghost fell
[1:26:51] and fielded and yet
[1:26:54] when he realized if nobody is worthy to
[1:26:58] take this book
[1:27:00] everything is lost he begins weeping
[1:27:05] [Music]
[1:27:06] of course john wept everything was lost
[1:27:10] but you know what sometimes
[1:27:14] it's good to have a brother
[1:27:18] or it's good to have a sister it's good
[1:27:21] to have somebody
[1:27:22] standing close to remind you
[1:27:30] john was looking at the present
[1:27:34] situation he was looking at the present
[1:27:38] circumstances and he forgot
[1:27:41] this isn't the conclusion
[1:27:46] this is an unfolding of something
[1:27:50] oh my that is so precious
[1:27:53] and so wonderful that god has kept it a
[1:27:56] secret
[1:27:57] for thousands and thousands of years
[1:28:01] and thank god there was an elder there
[1:28:03] thank god there was a brother there
[1:28:05] there was a sister that who kind of
[1:28:07] grabbed john and said
[1:28:09] don't weep john don't weep don't be
[1:28:14] discouraged
[1:28:16] don't be defeated remember who you
[1:28:19] are remember why you were sit here
[1:28:23] remember you were sent to watch and to
[1:28:27] write
[1:28:28] now john get your eyes off your
[1:28:31] surroundings
[1:28:32] get your eyes off a situation get your
[1:28:35] eyes
[1:28:36] off the circumstance and look up john
[1:28:39] moore is developing more
[1:28:43] is happening there's more going on in
[1:28:46] the world than coven
[1:28:47] there's more going on in the world than
[1:28:49] meeting in a hotel room
[1:28:51] there's more going in the world than
[1:28:53] your past
[1:28:54] and your trials and your battles and
[1:28:57] all the things that's going on in your
[1:28:59] life there's more happening
[1:29:02] because you're still alive and god's
[1:29:05] still on the tone
[1:29:06] and there's something more that god
[1:29:10] wants to make known to you
[1:29:12] [Applause]
[1:29:13] god couldn't reveal himself as a healer
[1:29:15] if he was never sick
[1:29:17] he couldn't reveal himself as a redeemer
[1:29:19] if he was never lost
[1:29:21] he could reveal himself as salvation if
[1:29:24] he was never in prison
[1:29:25] so sometimes god allows things in your
[1:29:28] life
[1:29:29] so he can reveal another characteristic
[1:29:33] of his
[1:29:34] power to you personally
[1:29:40] to produce a higher worship
[1:29:45] than before to produce a greater
[1:29:49] appreciation to produce a greater bond
[1:29:54] a greater connection john
[1:29:58] lead on jesus prison at the last supper
[1:30:02] john was on his prism but god was fixing
[1:30:05] to show
[1:30:06] john something that would give him a
[1:30:08] greater love
[1:30:09] for jesus christ than anything
[1:30:13] he had ever experienced before
[1:30:20] oh now would not be a good time to be a
[1:30:22] devil
[1:30:24] because i feel the liberty of the holy
[1:30:25] spirit right here in this place tonight
[1:30:29] there's some sons and daughters of god
[1:30:30] amen
[1:30:32] hallelujah praise god
[1:30:35] [Applause]
[1:30:38] one of the others saith unto me
[1:30:42] weep not behold
[1:30:47] lift your eyes john look up
[1:30:50] your redemption draweth nigh weep not
[1:30:54] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:30:58] the root of david
[1:31:00] [Applause]
[1:31:01] prevailed this is a prevailing
[1:31:06] revelation the lion of the tribe of
[1:31:09] judah
[1:31:09] for the man said prevail means to
[1:31:12] wrestle with
[1:31:13] and overcome there might have been a lot
[1:31:16] of wrestling
[1:31:18] and then there was wrestling in
[1:31:19] gethsemane oh
[1:31:21] father if it beat i will let this cup
[1:31:24] pass for me
[1:31:25] his sweat became his blood and then
[1:31:28] wrestling
[1:31:29] wrestling oh power but not my will
[1:31:32] but time be done he was overcoming
[1:31:36] his own will his own desires as a mortal
[1:31:40] man
[1:31:41] he overcame them hallelujah why
[1:31:45] to give birth he had to overcome that
[1:31:49] that mortal man's desires because there
[1:31:51] was a bride
[1:31:53] waiting to be born there was a bride
[1:31:58] waiting to be released from his side
[1:32:02] glory to god thank you jesus
[1:32:06] when he stood on the mountain in the
[1:32:08] temptation in the wilderness
[1:32:09] satan said if you'll fall down and
[1:32:12] worship me
[1:32:13] i'll give you all these kingdoms you can
[1:32:15] bypass calvary
[1:32:16] you can bypass gethsemane you can bypass
[1:32:19] the scourging
[1:32:20] you can bypass the rejection the
[1:32:23] misunderstanding
[1:32:24] oh i'll give it all to you right now but
[1:32:27] he wrestled
[1:32:29] and he wrestled and he wrestled with
[1:32:32] that idea
[1:32:33] of the easy way versus the predestinated
[1:32:37] way
[1:32:38] and he wrestled and he wrestled and he
[1:32:41] contemplated in his mind
[1:32:43] and then he remembered some attributes
[1:32:51] he remembered something on the inside
[1:32:55] could only be birthed when a roman
[1:32:58] spear would be thrust into his side
[1:33:03] and he would say into thy hands i come
[1:33:05] in my spirit
[1:33:08] hallelujah
[1:33:12] i want to tell you when he was wrestling
[1:33:15] he wasn't just wrestling his own trials
[1:33:17] he wasn't just wrestling his own battles
[1:33:20] he was wrestling for every son of god
[1:33:23] every daughter of god
[1:33:24] every man hallelujah every woman
[1:33:28] every boy and every girl that would ever
[1:33:30] believe on his name
[1:33:32] he was wrestling on their behalf
[1:33:35] and when he overcame
[1:33:38] he did not overcome only for himself
[1:33:42] but he overcame for you and for you and
[1:33:45] for you
[1:33:46] and for you every one of you tonight
[1:33:51] amen and they overcame him
[1:33:54] by the blood of the lamb and the word
[1:33:57] of their testimony
[1:34:01] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:34:04] a prevailing revelation
[1:34:07] a revelation that would make satan
[1:34:11] powerless against you hallelujah
[1:34:13] [Applause]
[1:34:16] hallelujah
[1:34:18] [Applause]
[1:34:20] what looked like the greatest defeat
[1:34:23] what appeared to be the most humiliating
[1:34:26] death
[1:34:28] was the most glorious life and the most
[1:34:31] glorious
[1:34:32] victory that could have ever been fought
[1:34:36] and hallelujah
[1:34:39] hallelujah
[1:34:43] and i be held in low in the midst of the
[1:34:44] throne in one of the and of the four
[1:34:46] beasts
[1:34:47] in the midst of the elders stood a lamb
[1:34:49] as it had been slain
[1:34:51] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[1:34:53] are the seven spirits of god
[1:34:56] sent forth into all the earth and he
[1:34:59] came
[1:35:01] and took the book out of the right hand
[1:35:03] of him
[1:35:04] that sat upon the throne and when he had
[1:35:08] taken the book
[1:35:09] the four beasts the 420 elders the mode
[1:35:14] of everything was transformed
[1:35:18] when they saw him take that book because
[1:35:21] they saw their identification in him
[1:35:25] and they saw their worthiness in
[1:35:28] him and if you
[1:35:31] have been made worthy to look
[1:35:35] upon the book and to see the mysteries
[1:35:39] and for it to be revealed it is
[1:35:42] understood
[1:35:44] that he has imparted to you
[1:35:48] his all worthiness
[1:35:51] [Music]
[1:35:53] no sin no guile
[1:35:56] no shame no stain
[1:36:00] and when he took the book he was
[1:36:03] claiming the names
[1:36:04] or the identities of every son and
[1:36:07] daughter of god
[1:36:08] in that book and he said i wrote them in
[1:36:11] my blood
[1:36:12] and i've washed them in my blood and i
[1:36:15] redeemed them in my blood
[1:36:16] and there is no difference
[1:36:20] between who i am and between who they
[1:36:24] are we are one and the same
[1:36:28] as i am worthy they are worthy
[1:36:31] as i have been accepted they have been
[1:36:34] accepted
[1:36:35] as i have overcome they have overcome
[1:36:38] [Applause]
[1:36:43] hallelujah what a mighty god we serve
[1:36:47] tonight
[1:36:48] no wonder we shout no wonder we sing
[1:36:52] no wonder we praise him no wonder we
[1:36:54] love him
[1:36:55] no matter we come to church no wonder
[1:37:00] how can you be silent when you
[1:37:03] see what the lamb has done
[1:37:06] [Applause]
[1:37:11] if these hold their peace the rocks are
[1:37:13] going to cry out
[1:37:15] but they're not going to hold their
[1:37:16] peace hallelujah oh my
[1:37:20] god
[1:37:23] [Applause]
[1:37:26] they all fell down they took their harps
[1:37:30] their vials and they sung a new song
[1:37:35] if if you watch in chapter 4
[1:37:38] they sang a song they sang a song and
[1:37:42] they said
[1:37:42] thou hast created us
[1:37:46] for thy pleasure all things for your
[1:37:48] pleasure
[1:37:49] that has created us
[1:37:51] [Music]
[1:37:52] well he created a lot of things
[1:37:57] he created lucifer
[1:38:00] he created angels which fell and became
[1:38:04] demons
[1:38:06] he gave life in the womb to
[1:38:10] reprobate and unregenerate
[1:38:14] so to know him as creator
[1:38:17] is one thing but open book worship
[1:38:22] like we see in chapter five
[1:38:25] brought their relationship
[1:38:28] with the lamb up to another level
[1:38:32] [Music]
[1:38:33] now they see him as creator
[1:38:36] and redeemer
[1:38:40] for thou hast redeemed
[1:38:44] us by thy blood
[1:38:49] and it broke all national barriers all
[1:38:52] cultural barriers
[1:38:53] all racial barriers amen all statuses
[1:38:57] out of every kindred every people every
[1:39:00] tongue
[1:39:01] and every nation
[1:39:02] [Applause]
[1:39:04] those were all temporary conditions
[1:39:08] that became a result of things like
[1:39:10] babylon the tower of babylon in the fall
[1:39:13] of adam in the garden
[1:39:15] but to be redeemed
[1:39:18] means that you were somewhere
[1:39:22] and you had a certain value
[1:39:26] in the first place so when they said
[1:39:30] thou hast redeemed us what they were
[1:39:34] saying was
[1:39:35] we have been restored
[1:39:39] back to everything
[1:39:43] that we were before any of this happened
[1:39:48] before adam fell before he fell before
[1:39:51] abraham lied
[1:39:52] before david committed adultery before
[1:39:55] moses
[1:39:55] grew angry and smote the rock
[1:39:58] [Applause]
[1:39:59] thou hast redeemed us
[1:40:04] by thy blood and has made us
[1:40:07] unto our god kings and
[1:40:11] priests
[1:40:12] [Applause]
[1:40:15] and you know what all those created
[1:40:18] angels
[1:40:19] all those created angels begin to
[1:40:21] realize we're about to get a break
[1:40:25] we're about to get a break
[1:40:29] from our worship because
[1:40:32] those people can worship god
[1:40:36] in a way that we cannot
[1:40:39] [Applause]
[1:40:40] they know god in a way we know not
[1:40:44] and when they begin to worship god
[1:40:47] our worship will settle amen our worship
[1:40:50] amen will subside
[1:40:53] to make room for the worship of the
[1:40:55] redeemed
[1:40:57] oh my praise the lord
[1:41:04] john said i heard the voice of many
[1:41:06] angels around about the throne and of
[1:41:08] the beasts and the elders
[1:41:10] remember those beasts were represented
[1:41:11] by men
[1:41:13] those elders are represented by men the
[1:41:16] patriarchs the 12 disciples
[1:41:18] matthew mark luke and john and they were
[1:41:21] all saying with a loud voice
[1:41:24] worthy is the lamb that was slain to
[1:41:26] receive power and
[1:41:27] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[1:41:30] and glory and blessing
[1:41:32] and john said in the midst
[1:41:36] of all of them
[1:41:40] worshiping god with a loud voice
[1:41:45] yet every creature
[1:41:48] every creature which is in heaven
[1:41:52] and in earth and under the earth and
[1:41:55] those that are in the sea you know it's
[1:41:57] kind of hard for sound to travel through
[1:41:59] water
[1:42:00] but john said he did everything in the
[1:42:02] sea
[1:42:04] he said it god thought enough of it to
[1:42:06] put it in his bible
[1:42:08] it must be the truth see
[1:42:11] this prevailing revelation gave
[1:42:14] john a voice
[1:42:18] that could drown out every other voice
[1:42:24] oh it took preeminence
[1:42:29] over every other voice brother solomon
[1:42:32] the voice of the redeemed overcomer took
[1:42:35] preeminence
[1:42:37] over the websites over the critics
[1:42:42] over the doubters i mean if it could
[1:42:44] take preeminence over the other
[1:42:46] worshipers
[1:42:47] you know there was no doubters there
[1:42:49] were no skeptics
[1:42:50] there were no websites there was nothing
[1:42:53] john's voice
[1:42:55] took preeminence over every
[1:42:58] other sound and every other voice
[1:43:03] in all the creation hallelujah
[1:43:10] you know something they say there's two
[1:43:11] things you can't talk and listen at the
[1:43:13] same time
[1:43:14] so if you're praising god you can't be
[1:43:16] listening to the devil
[1:43:18] if you're praising god you can't be
[1:43:20] listening to what the doctor
[1:43:21] or your unsaved husband or your unsaved
[1:43:24] wife or your lost boss or whatever
[1:43:26] if you're praising god surely you can't
[1:43:28] be hearing those other voices
[1:43:30] [Applause]
[1:43:35] every creature heard i saying blessing
[1:43:39] and honor
[1:43:40] and glory and power be unto him that
[1:43:42] sitteth upon the throne
[1:43:44] and to the lamb forever and ever
[1:43:47] oh my is it okay just to take a few more
[1:43:51] minutes
[1:43:53] notice he is not an animal
[1:43:57] he took the book out of the right hand
[1:43:59] of him that set up on the throne
[1:44:02] who was it the original owner
[1:44:05] that had the book of redemption in his
[1:44:07] right hand remember brother bannon said
[1:44:09] satan's filthy hands couldn't hold on to
[1:44:11] it
[1:44:12] he thought he would take it from adam
[1:44:13] and then he found out even his hands
[1:44:15] couldn't even hold on to it
[1:44:17] i like that satan has no control over
[1:44:20] you or me
[1:44:22] he couldn't even hold the book for a
[1:44:24] split
[1:44:25] second when adam forfeited it it went
[1:44:28] right back into the hands of god
[1:44:30] amen and no
[1:44:33] angel could take the place this bloody
[1:44:36] lamb walked out and took the book out of
[1:44:38] his hand
[1:44:39] what was it brother this is the most
[1:44:42] sublime thing in the scripture an
[1:44:45] act that not an angel not nothing could
[1:44:48] do it
[1:44:49] and the lamb come and took it from the
[1:44:50] right hand of him that set upon the
[1:44:52] throne
[1:44:53] what is it now it belongs to the lamb
[1:44:56] amen god's law is required he's the one
[1:44:59] that holds it
[1:45:00] god's law required a kinsman redeemer
[1:45:02] and the lamb come out holding it
[1:45:04] i am their
[1:45:07] kinsmen
[1:45:08] [Music]
[1:45:11] you don't have to worry about
[1:45:15] claiming to be sons and daughters of god
[1:45:19] he claimed you
[1:45:22] he said i am their kinsmen
[1:45:26] i am blood relation to them amen it's
[1:45:29] not so much a matter of whether or not
[1:45:31] you feel worthy
[1:45:32] to be identified with him he identified
[1:45:35] himself
[1:45:36] with you he said i am their kinsmen
[1:45:40] amen i am their kinsmen
[1:45:44] i've made intercession for them and now
[1:45:47] i've come to
[1:45:48] claim their rights for them amen there's
[1:45:51] the only one i've come to claim their
[1:45:53] rights in that they
[1:45:54] have a right to everything that
[1:45:58] lost in the fall and i've paid the price
[1:46:02] oh brother don't that make you feel
[1:46:03] religious inside
[1:46:05] not by good works which we have done but
[1:46:08] by
[1:46:09] his mercy
[1:46:12] you know the next time we see this book
[1:46:17] it's in revelation chapter 10.
[1:46:21] i saw another mighty angel come down
[1:46:23] from heaven
[1:46:25] and he had in his hand a little book
[1:46:28] open and he said his right foot upon the
[1:46:32] left his left foot
[1:46:32] punchy or see and lead i may have those
[1:46:35] crossed but you see
[1:46:36] the book is here again
[1:46:40] and if you read down a little further
[1:46:45] there's another prophet
[1:46:50] and all the devil can try to do
[1:46:54] is stop that revelation from reaching
[1:46:57] that prophet
[1:46:59] the same way he tried to stop that
[1:47:01] revelation
[1:47:02] from reaching daniel so what does he do
[1:47:06] when this prophet is on the earth and
[1:47:08] it's coming up to time to begin laying
[1:47:10] in the teaching and the foundation and
[1:47:12] the preaching
[1:47:13] he throws a tax case
[1:47:16] he throws every distraction every
[1:47:19] obstacle
[1:47:20] every smear every state shuts down the
[1:47:23] campaigns
[1:47:24] sends them back to jeffersonville i'm
[1:47:25] not even sure he could travel overseas
[1:47:28] because of having to deal with this
[1:47:31] court case
[1:47:33] it was like a brother branham was being
[1:47:37] charged as a criminal
[1:47:44] he's being charged as a criminal that's
[1:47:46] the same thing they
[1:47:48] booked al capone for was tax evasion
[1:47:51] and here the gods profit amen which
[1:47:54] would take a hundred dollar a week
[1:47:56] salary after no doubt
[1:47:58] thousands and thousands in offerings
[1:48:00] amen and turn the rest of it over to
[1:48:02] to the missions and the ministry
[1:48:03] expenses here comes the federal
[1:48:06] government of the united states the irs
[1:48:08] and charges him with tax evasion
[1:48:12] i guess the devil didn't learn with
[1:48:14] daniel he didn't learn with john
[1:48:18] and he didn't learn with god's prophet
[1:48:20] either
[1:48:24] and i'll just read to you here from the
[1:48:25] breach
[1:48:27] you say is my name there
[1:48:31] i don't know i hope it is
[1:48:34] but if it is it was put on the book
[1:48:36] before the foundation of the world
[1:48:39] but the first thing that represented
[1:48:41] that redemption
[1:48:42] come the lamb that had been slain be
[1:48:44] from the foundation of the world
[1:48:46] and he took the book opened the book
[1:48:50] and tore off the seals
[1:48:53] now notice this is this is christ doing
[1:48:57] all of these he
[1:49:00] took the book
[1:49:04] and tore off the seals and
[1:49:08] sent it down to earth
[1:49:13] to his seventh angel to reveal it
[1:49:16] to his people
[1:49:24] the devil failed again
[1:49:28] all that in hell failed again
[1:49:32] once again the revelation has made it to
[1:49:35] the prophet
[1:49:36] and as of making it to the prophet
[1:49:40] there's also an ordained people on the
[1:49:42] face of the earth
[1:49:44] amen
[1:49:46] [Music]
[1:49:47] i'm going to read that again just
[1:49:49] because i like it so much
[1:49:52] it wasn't the prophet that did this it
[1:49:55] wasn't brother breton that did this
[1:49:57] it was jesus christ that did this
[1:50:00] he took the book opened the book
[1:50:05] tore off the seals and set
[1:50:08] it down to the earth
[1:50:11] to his seventh angel to reveal it
[1:50:15] to his people oh
[1:50:18] my god
[1:50:22] and you know what they wrote right here
[1:50:24] you know what they wrote right here
[1:50:25] after that
[1:50:26] you know what they put congregation
[1:50:30] greatly rejoices
[1:50:42] they did the same thing in
[1:50:43] jeffersonville that they did
[1:50:46] on patmos what john saw on patmos say
[1:50:49] man
[1:50:50] is again happening in jeffersonville
[1:50:52] when these people amen begin to realize
[1:50:55] they are included in that great work
[1:50:58] of redemption hallelujah
[1:51:03] congregation rejoices
[1:51:07] he says there you are oh my what
[1:51:09] happened
[1:51:10] the screams the shouts the hallelujahs
[1:51:13] the anointed the power
[1:51:14] the glory the manifestation and old john
[1:51:18] who had been standing there our brother
[1:51:20] crying why he said everything in heaven
[1:51:24] everything in the earth and everything
[1:51:27] in the sea
[1:51:28] heard me holler amen amen blessings
[1:51:32] honor and might and power
[1:51:34] be to him that lives forever and ever
[1:51:38] amen i'm closing tonight musicians can
[1:51:41] come back
[1:51:42] but i want to say this there is an
[1:51:43] ordained channel
[1:51:46] for god to reveal himself
[1:51:50] satan couldn't prevent the revelation
[1:51:52] from reaching the prophet
[1:51:55] now all he can do is try
[1:51:58] to keep you from receiving
[1:52:02] it and if he can occupy your time
[1:52:06] he can occupy your attention if he can
[1:52:10] weaken your confidence if he can make
[1:52:13] you ashamed
[1:52:15] if he could make you doubtful if he can
[1:52:17] do anything
[1:52:18] to hinder that channel
[1:52:22] he's got you but there's some people
[1:52:26] that's got the same level of
[1:52:28] determination
[1:52:30] that daniel had i know it's for me
[1:52:34] and all the devils in hell ain't gonna
[1:52:37] stop me
[1:52:38] from receiving what god has sent
[1:52:42] for me
[1:52:45] you know in in daniel's day when he
[1:52:48] couldn't stop it from reaching daniel
[1:52:51] the next thing he tried to do was make
[1:52:52] them worship
[1:52:54] daniel
[1:52:57] the same thing's happening again the
[1:53:00] revelation has already reached the
[1:53:02] prophet
[1:53:03] and he holds the scriptural position and
[1:53:05] we shouldn't take anything away from
[1:53:07] that
[1:53:08] or fail to give respects to that amen
[1:53:11] but to try to worship him doesn't do
[1:53:15] away with what god did in him amen
[1:53:17] and that's just a smoke screen that the
[1:53:20] devil has put there
[1:53:21] to try to weaken people's confidence
[1:53:25] in the vessel that god used
[1:53:28] amen he tried to make an idol out of him
[1:53:33] but the three hebrew children did not
[1:53:37] lose confidence in what god had done in
[1:53:40] daniel and they did not worship him
[1:53:43] they stood for the truth and
[1:53:46] god fought enough of their stand
[1:53:51] god had such high esteem
[1:53:54] for the three hebrew children stand
[1:53:57] for what daniel pointed them to that
[1:54:00] when they went in the fiery furnace
[1:54:02] god would not let a substitute angel
[1:54:06] go down there god said they stood for me
[1:54:11] on earth and now i am going to earth
[1:54:16] to identify myself with them
[1:54:21] and i believe in the fiery furnace of
[1:54:24] 2021
[1:54:26] if you will stand for the truth
[1:54:30] god will come from glory
[1:54:34] and appear in the skies to identify
[1:54:38] himself with you
[1:54:39] and to call you up to glory amen
[1:54:42] amen in a glorified body to identify you
[1:54:46] as the bride of jesus christ
[1:54:50] amen if you can be a proud enough
[1:54:53] tonight if you can have enough
[1:54:54] understanding to stand for this
[1:54:56] revelation if you can see
[1:54:58] it was not god revealing a man it was
[1:55:01] god revealing himself
[1:55:02] if you can see christ in the message
[1:55:05] if you can see christ in those seals if
[1:55:08] you can see
[1:55:09] the revealing of the son of man and you
[1:55:12] can realize
[1:55:13] it's the invisible union of the earthly
[1:55:16] bride
[1:55:17] and the heavenly bridegroom then god
[1:55:21] god has already i mean he's already on
[1:55:24] his way i just believe that tonight
[1:55:26] i believe the rapture is in motion amen
[1:55:29] i believe
[1:55:30] we're still praying we're still pressing
[1:55:32] we're still believing
[1:55:33] amen but the rapture is already in
[1:55:36] motion
[1:55:38] soon the lamb will take his bride to be
[1:55:41] ever at his side

[1:58:30] when he was making the ultimate
[1:58:33] sacrifice
[1:58:34] and suffering for their redemption
[1:58:38] but after his resurrection
[1:58:42] he made a little fire there on the
[1:58:46] on the shore by the sea
[1:58:49] and he said come and nine
[1:58:53] you might have deserted me you might
[1:58:55] have fled
[1:58:57] you might have forsaken me you might
[1:58:59] have cursed
[1:59:00] swore and denied

[2:06:58] i can show you scripture that i was
[2:07:00] writing
[2:07:01] and it's going to amaze you the deacon
[2:07:04] knows exactly where i'm coming from
[2:07:07] church we have been tremendously
[2:07:11] blessed by almighty god
[2:07:14] people's life are changing people are
[2:07:17] getting filled
[2:07:19] people are receiving deliveries
[2:07:22] and to see a message in this manifold
[2:07:26] this is nothing but the grace of god
[2:07:29] amen even when we are disclosing the
[2:07:33] black dog
[2:07:34] there is a key to that and brother
[2:07:37] robert even whispered to me
[2:07:39] tonight and the brother read the message
[2:07:42] here
[2:07:43] why do we go to those details why do we
[2:07:46] have to expose the devil like that
[2:07:49] you don't know what kind of fight we are
[2:07:52] putting up
[2:07:52] with just by opening those avenues
[2:07:56] amen brother tim cross read the
[2:08:01] quote tonight and i'm going to read it
[2:08:03] again
[2:08:05] he says he knows
[2:08:09] that if the people
[2:08:12] get the true revelation
[2:08:16] of the true church
[2:08:19] you know we demonstrated here that god
[2:08:23] lived in the tabernacle then from the
[2:08:27] tabernacle
[2:08:28] he went to the temple of solomon
[2:08:31] amen then the promise says that the lord
[2:08:34] will come
[2:08:36] and enter his temple
[2:08:39] and when jesus look at the building he
[2:08:41] says destroy this temple
[2:08:43] and in three days i'm going to rebuild
[2:08:46] it
[2:08:46] they thought god was still pointing to
[2:08:50] the temple of solomon
[2:08:52] god already changed to a human temple
[2:08:56] and that first temple was jesus christ
[2:08:59] amen that was actually the archetype
[2:09:03] that was the main thing
[2:09:06] all at the temple were only taps and
[2:09:09] shadow
[2:09:10] but he was the temple of god amen
[2:09:14] then on the day of pentecost he said i
[2:09:16] think it's pigeon for me to go
[2:09:18] and to send the same holy spirit now
[2:09:22] not on that temple but on many
[2:09:25] others temple and paul came and unfold
[2:09:27] the revelation
[2:09:29] and paul said that we are the temple
[2:09:32] of the living god amen so when we refer
[2:09:36] to
[2:09:36] church sometime we have a tendency to
[2:09:39] look at a building
[2:09:41] we have a tendency to look at a
[2:09:43] gathering
[2:09:44] which is true we also have a tendency to
[2:09:46] look at the church age
[2:09:48] as a whole as the church of laodicea
[2:09:51] which we
[2:09:52] are specifically called the blood of
[2:09:54] jesus christ today
[2:09:56] but i want you to look at the church as
[2:09:58] yourself
[2:10:00] as you as an individual brother branham
[2:10:03] said the same way god deal with the age
[2:10:06] that's the same way he's dealing with a
[2:10:08] local church
[2:10:09] and that's the same way he's dealing
[2:10:11] with you as an
[2:10:13] individual so when i'm gonna read this
[2:10:15] quote put yourself
[2:10:17] as the church don't look at spoken word
[2:10:20] tabernacle
[2:10:21] look at yourself as the church and
[2:10:24] listen to what he says
[2:10:25] amen hallelujah
[2:10:29] he says when
[2:10:33] he knows that if the people if you
[2:10:37] get the true revelation of the
[2:10:41] true church of who truly you are
[2:10:44] amen and what she is
[2:10:48] esther esther we are still on 24.
[2:10:52] esther are you there
[2:10:55] she stand for on sunday we showed you
[2:10:59] that you were made for a purpose
[2:11:01] remember that
[2:11:03] you were made specifically wonderfully
[2:11:07] marvelously for god pleasure and for a
[2:11:11] purpose
[2:11:12] amen he said what she stands for
[2:11:16] and that she can do the greater works
[2:11:20] she will be an invincible army
[2:11:24] now watch this if they
[2:11:28] get a true revelation of the true spirit
[2:11:32] you follow me within the framework of
[2:11:36] the christian church
[2:11:38] which church am i talking about
[2:11:42] who if you understand
[2:11:46] that within you there is two dogs
[2:11:50] you understand now if you get the
[2:11:52] revelation of the black dog
[2:11:55] that is in your flesh that paul spoke in
[2:11:59] romans 7 that
[2:12:00] whenever i want to do good there is the
[2:12:02] spirit
[2:12:04] if you understand the revelation of the
[2:12:07] two spirit
[2:12:08] the two dogs working inside of you
[2:12:12] in your framework church
[2:12:15] if you understand that that's why we are
[2:12:18] opening the black dog
[2:12:20] because once you catch that revelation
[2:12:23] once
[2:12:24] esther unfold amen
[2:12:28] watch again blessed be the name of the
[2:12:31] lord
[2:12:32] hallelujah if she get the true
[2:12:36] revelation of the two spirit
[2:12:39] within not outside that's why paul said
[2:12:43] i see a law within me
[2:12:45] within the framework of the christian
[2:12:48] church
[2:12:49] and by god's spirit which is the white
[2:12:52] dog
[2:12:53] if you let the white dog dominate you
[2:12:56] let joshua handle that a malachite
[2:12:59] are you there hallelujah within the
[2:13:02] framework of the christian church
[2:13:05] and by god's spirit discern
[2:13:08] and withstand the antichrist spirit
[2:13:11] that black dog satan
[2:13:14] will be powerless before her
[2:13:18] all we are folding is just to show you
[2:13:22] give preeminence to christ
[2:13:25] let the black dog rule let the white dog
[2:13:29] rule and he's gonna tame the black dog
[2:13:33] amen he's just gonna be there like in
[2:13:35] the millennium
[2:13:37] he will be there but he will be
[2:13:38] powerless until redemption
[2:13:41] until the full redemption comes when our
[2:13:44] bodies are changed they're gonna kick
[2:13:45] him out
[2:13:46] and he goes back to hell but that takes
[2:13:49] the second feast of esther
[2:13:51] to kick aim and completely out amen
[2:13:55] when we get to that you're gonna see
[2:13:56] even the the even the place that
[2:14:00] the the the second fist the second
[2:14:02] banquet was organized
[2:14:05] and you see exactly that place is
[2:14:08] telling you
[2:14:08] it is no longer in laodicea he was in
[2:14:11] the bright age
[2:14:15] church we have been tremendously blessed
[2:14:19] this brother moved completely out of the
[2:14:21] way
[2:14:23] he doesn't know what's going on you
[2:14:25] don't know how many
[2:14:27] people are getting delivered
[2:14:30] some of those stuff i cannot say them
[2:14:32] here because it's people
[2:14:33] private life it's one after the other
[2:14:37] one after the other one after the other
[2:14:40] one
[2:14:40] after the other why because you stirred
[2:14:43] the devil
[2:14:43] right where he said amen
[2:14:47] we need the power of resurrection if not
[2:14:50] we will be housing
[2:14:51] demon for years and we're going to be
[2:14:54] called
[2:14:55] formal just be message believer and no
[2:14:58] fire
[2:14:59] we need a fire that can disturb the
[2:15:01] devil
[2:15:02] amen amen so don't run
[2:15:07] come on sunday let's disclose
[2:15:10] couple sunday ago we disclosed that even
[2:15:12] men are not supposed to wear bracelet
[2:15:15] we showed you by the scripture now
[2:15:18] nobody can say i don't know it we're
[2:15:21] gonna show you
[2:15:22] everything by the scripture and back it
[2:15:24] up by the message of the hour
[2:15:26] and you will see why and it's only
[2:15:28] tricks that the devil
[2:15:30] is trying to give you a different
[2:15:32] identity
[2:15:33] than what god already gave you amen
[2:15:37] and lord willing you're gonna see how
[2:15:39] can satan comes and tell
[2:15:41] eve that if you partake of the tree
[2:15:45] of the knowledge of good and evil you're
[2:15:47] gonna be like god
[2:15:49] what was eve to begin with
[2:15:53] what was eve what was adam
[2:15:58] the bible says in luke 3 2 3 38
[2:16:01] adam the son of who and the son of god
[2:16:05] is whole
[2:16:06] so what kind of god was lucifer trying
[2:16:09] to give them
[2:16:12] you see what i'm saying if was already
[2:16:15] god
[2:16:16] i'm going to show you in the scripture
[2:16:17] on sunday
[2:16:19] and satan said you're going to be like
[2:16:21] god
[2:16:24] amen you are already beautiful the way
[2:16:28] god made you
[2:16:29] [Applause]
[2:16:31] you are already wonderful the way god
[2:16:33] made you
[2:16:35] but certain want to put something else
[2:16:37] in you
[2:16:38] to destroy your identity
[2:16:42] you see what i'm saying you see what the
[2:16:44] devil is trying to do
[2:16:46] because according to ezekiel 16 that we
[2:16:49] have been digging deep on
[2:16:50] it god came and was worrying about
[2:16:53] failing that woman
[2:16:55] at puberty why is the clothing important
[2:16:59] when the woman turned to puberty we
[2:17:01] disclosed all of this in ezekiel 16.
[2:17:04] why was god worrying about
[2:17:08] failing adam and eve after they ate
[2:17:10] their eyes become open
[2:17:13] if you don't understand that trial in
[2:17:15] teenager
[2:17:17] that trial will come back in menopause
[2:17:19] exactly the same thing
[2:17:22] because teenager was turned on by
[2:17:25] hormone we
[2:17:26] demonstrated to you by the prophet and
[2:17:28] by the word of god
[2:17:30] by ezekiel 16. it was the hormone that
[2:17:32] opened the black dog
[2:17:34] amen and then when you get to menopause
[2:17:37] your hormones are
[2:17:38] shut off and that same temptation you
[2:17:42] have as a teenager
[2:17:43] is coming back again to meet you
[2:17:46] you got to be prepared for it we thank
[2:17:49] god for his deliverance
[2:17:51] it's good to be in church it's
[2:17:54] very good to be in church brother tim
[2:17:56] thank you very much
[2:17:58] that's why i love people who knows how
[2:18:00] to handle the sword
[2:18:01] amen that was a tremendous
[2:18:05] blessing amen
[2:18:09] you know what happened to peter you know
[2:18:12] what happened to peter because he got
[2:18:13] the revelation jesus said peter i
[2:18:16] pray for you
[2:18:19] and not only did he pray when he
[2:18:21] resurrected he said god tell my disciple
[2:18:23] and
[2:18:24] that peter i don't want him to build a
[2:18:27] complex
[2:18:30] then he goes again he said peter do you
[2:18:32] love me why he didn't ask anybody else
[2:18:34] only peter
[2:18:36] why only peter why in the day of
[2:18:38] pentecost only peter
[2:18:42] why peter do you love me three times do
[2:18:45] you love me do you love me why do you
[2:18:46] keep insisting on peter
[2:18:49] he was the one that got that revelation
[2:18:51] of christ
[2:18:52] peter say christ the son of god do you
[2:18:55] know what the son of god means
[2:18:58] do you know what the son of god means
[2:19:01] take john chapter 5 and we go home
[2:19:07] usually people when they say son of god
[2:19:09] they're looking at the
[2:19:10] father and a son
[2:19:15] that's what we look usually
[2:19:18] i'm sorry it's not me it's brother tim
[2:19:20] cross who preached
[2:19:22] so he's the one that kept bringing this
[2:19:24] stuff to me
[2:19:26] you there go to john chapter 5
[2:19:30] verse 18. oh my god
[2:19:36] i'm already sweating under the anointing
[2:19:42] amen i thought to keep it even on sunday
[2:19:46] but i'm going to say it
[2:19:48] when brother john began to pray for me
[2:19:50] on sunday here
[2:19:53] i felt an anointing coming back straight
[2:19:55] and hit me on my right side
[2:19:58] my heart my right shoulder i was sick
[2:20:00] sitting there
[2:20:01] and preparing to preach and suddenly
[2:20:06] i was delivered i could bend move

[2:21:03] anointing
[2:21:05] how did she know i was healed there
[2:21:08] while nobody else knew
[2:21:10] it is called the gift of the word of
[2:21:13] knowledge
[2:21:15] if you need the code see me i will send
[2:21:17] you that quote
[2:21:19] but what i'm saying a gift of a word of
[2:21:21] knowledge is a gift that can tell what
[2:21:23] happened already
[2:21:24] or what is in the future amen
[2:21:28] it was not sister royal it was god
[2:21:31] who did it then i came after her
[2:21:34] and testify
[2:21:37] [Music]
[2:21:38] god is in this church
[2:21:42] are you there
[2:21:43] [Music]
[2:21:46] let's go to john chapter 5 verse 18 then
[2:21:49] i'll let you go home
[2:21:51] if you dare you can say amen
[2:21:55] therefore the jews sought the more to
[2:21:57] kill him
[2:21:59] because he not only had broken the
[2:22:03] sabbath
[2:22:04] but said also that who
[2:22:08] god was who if you stop right there
[2:22:12] there is a father there is a child
[2:22:15] that's a gentile understanding that's
[2:22:17] why you need a prophet
[2:22:20] amen watch now god
[2:22:23] was his father karma making himself
[2:22:27] what we thought in other words when
[2:22:31] jesus was saying
[2:22:32] i am the son of god the jews
[2:22:35] understood clearly that jesus was
[2:22:39] telling them
[2:22:39] i am god this is a deity
[2:22:44] without a court
[2:22:47] i can sit with you an hour and give you
[2:22:49] code scripture scripture scripture
[2:22:52] about the deity of jesus christ the
[2:22:54] message is
[2:22:55] perfectly in line with the scripture
[2:22:59] amen so the revelation when jesus said
[2:23:03] when peter say i am you are the son of
[2:23:05] god
[2:23:06] just like brother explained to man jesus
[2:23:09] peter was telling jesus that you
[2:23:11] are christ the son of the living god in
[2:23:14] other words you are
[2:23:15] crust you are amen
[2:23:18] that's why when satan was tempting jesus
[2:23:22] jesus said you shall not tempt who
[2:23:25] the lord your who who was straight and
[2:23:28] tempting
