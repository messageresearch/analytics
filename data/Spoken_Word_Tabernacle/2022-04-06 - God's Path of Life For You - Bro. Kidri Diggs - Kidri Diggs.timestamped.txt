[40:33] and then we're gonna go to romans
[40:35] chapter nine
[40:37] praise the lord
[40:48] and we're very familiar with the story
[40:49] this is where paul was converted
[40:53] amen he had
[40:54] he had an
[40:56] old testament experience with god
[41:00] but god wanted to show paul this is a
[41:02] season of change
[41:06] hallelujah
[41:08] listen church uh let's start at verse
[41:11] um
[41:12] let's start at verse 11.
[41:15] the bible says and the lord said unto
[41:17] him arise
[41:18] and go into the street which is called
[41:21] straight and inquire of the house of
[41:23] judas
[41:25] for the one called saul and of saul of
[41:28] tarsus
[41:29] for behold
[41:31] he prayed
[41:32] and have seen in a vision a man named
[41:36] ananias coming in
[41:38] and putting his hand on him
[41:41] that he might receive his sight
[41:44] hallelujah
[41:46] paul was already waiting on ananias
[41:49] but listen listen he said the enemy is
[41:51] answered
[41:52] lord i have heard by many of this man
[41:56] how much evil have done
[41:59] done to the saints at jerusalem
[42:02] and here he has authority from the chief
[42:05] priests to bind all that call on thy
[42:08] name but the lord said unto him go thy
[42:11] way for he is a chosen vessel unto me
[42:16] and he's the chosen of us unto me to
[42:18] bear my name before the gentiles and
[42:21] kings
[42:22] and the children of israel
[42:24] for i will show him
[42:27] how great things he must suffer
[42:29] for my name's sake
[42:32] amen let's go to romans chapter nine
[42:40] romans chapter nine and just to make the
[42:42] reading short let's start at verse 11.
[42:46] my it's so refreshing to hear bible's
[42:48] turning
[42:50] amen praise the lord
[42:53] glory
[42:55] romans 9-11 the bible says for the
[42:58] children being not yet born neither
[43:00] having
[43:01] done any good or evil that the purpose
[43:05] of god according to election might stand
[43:09] not of works but of him that call it
[43:13] it was said unto her the elder
[43:17] shall serve the younger as it is written
[43:20] jacob have i love
[43:22] but esau have i hated
[43:24] oh my may the lord bless you of his word
[43:27] you can have your seats
[43:29] praise the lord
[43:32] tonight i want to use for a subject uh
[43:35] god's path
[43:37] of life for you
[43:39] god's path of life
[43:41] for you amen
[43:43] now i want us to just just i want to
[43:46] lift your spirits tonight hallelujah
[43:48] because we're called to walk by faith
[43:51] and not by sight
[43:52] but there's too often certain things
[43:54] happen in our life
[43:56] and we step back to walk by sight
[43:58] hallelujah no i want to say to you
[44:00] tonight god is in control
[44:03] he's in control of the good days he's in
[44:06] control of the bad things
[44:08] he's in control when you're happy he's
[44:10] in control when you're sad hallelujah
[44:13] he's in control when you got plenty he's
[44:16] in control when you got lacked
[44:18] see god has a purpose for your life
[44:21] hallelujah and it's time for us to
[44:23] realize that there is nothing out of
[44:26] order
[44:27] there's nothing out of order no matter
[44:29] what it looks like there's nothing out
[44:31] of order no matter where your children
[44:34] are there's nothing out of order no
[44:36] matter how the church condition might
[44:38] look there's nothing out of order no
[44:41] matter what it took to get you here
[44:43] there's nothing at all
[44:45] hallelujah
[44:46] god has a plan for your life
[44:49] and he wants us to find that path walk
[44:52] in that path and live victorious
[44:55] because when we find the path that god
[44:58] has ordained for us
[45:00] satan can't do nothing
[45:02] you become untouchable
[45:04] when you find the path that god has
[45:07] ordained for you before the foundation
[45:10] of the world there's nothing that you
[45:12] can do to stop it
[45:17] hallelujah
[45:18] there's nothing he can say
[45:20] there's nothing he can set up
[45:22] when you find the plan of god when you
[45:25] find the path that god has put you in no
[45:29] matter what the obstacles are you will
[45:32] overcome
[45:39] [Music]
[45:45] because if it's god's plan if it's god's
[45:49] path
[45:50] who gonna stop god from making it come
[45:51] to pass
[45:54] hallelujah
[45:55] listen church we go back and we look at
[45:57] the story
[45:58] paul hallelujah
[46:00] he was a man
[46:02] with an old testament revelation
[46:05] but then god hallelujah wanted to show
[46:07] paul that now
[46:09] it's a season for change
[46:12] hallelujah and i think sometimes
[46:14] hallelujah when we go through a change
[46:17] we misunderstand what god is doing
[46:20] he's not hurting us but he's making us
[46:23] stronger he's bringing us into a greater
[46:26] place in the kingdom he's bringing us
[46:28] into something we would have never got
[46:31] to if that didn't happen
[46:33] so i want you to go back look at your
[46:35] life and look at something that you
[46:38] didn't like that had to happen to get
[46:40] you here
[46:44] hallelujah
[46:46] amen so you know church paul was
[46:49] persecuting the church
[46:51] he had orders he was going back and
[46:52] forth he saw people get stoned all these
[46:55] things so power had a reputation
[46:58] and his reputation exceeded him church
[47:00] let me tell you something god allowed
[47:03] that reputation to get out there
[47:05] god allowed paul's reputation to get out
[47:08] there so certain people would treat him
[47:11] a certain way
[47:17] those people that treated paul a certain
[47:20] way they were ordained
[47:23] they were put in his path honey there
[47:26] were people that had the whipped paw
[47:28] there was a viper that had the bike paw
[47:30] there were people that had the stone
[47:32] power there was a boat that had to break
[47:34] up on fire there was a gripper there
[47:36] were festus there were people who tried
[47:38] to stop paul but all those people were
[47:40] in his path
[47:45] god put them there
[47:49] why to keep paul on track
[47:53] whoa
[47:55] god put struggle in your way to keep you
[47:58] on track
[47:59] god allow paul to have bad eyes to keep
[48:03] him on track
[48:06] [Music]
[48:11] my family brother kelly's sister kelly
[48:13] they know it took a brain tumor to get
[48:15] me here
[48:18] so the devil don't get no credit
[48:21] that brain tumor was what god used
[48:23] hardly to bring forth a season of change
[48:26] in my life
[48:29] god used a sickness to bring up a
[48:32] revelation of healing wow
[48:36] that revelation was already in there
[48:40] cancer was in my path
[48:43] [Music]
[48:47] and god
[48:48] used cancer to bring out healing
[48:55] now you ask yourself what is he putting
[48:57] in your path
[49:00] church the thing about god
[49:03] when we go through things it's not for
[49:06] us to backside
[49:08] but it's it's to encourage us
[49:12] it's to show us what god has placed in
[49:14] us
[49:15] for that certain situation
[49:17] you look in the scripture hallelujah
[49:19] mostly everybody that was chosen of god
[49:22] they went through things unexpectedly
[49:29] and the prophet preached the message and
[49:31] he said god hallelujah moving at an
[49:33] unexpected time in an unexpected way
[49:36] hallelujah god ordains things hallelujah
[49:40] just to help you grow
[49:45] hallelujah
[49:47] but sometimes hell yeah brother stephen
[49:49] when we're going through a change we
[49:51] start complaining
[49:54] no why are you allowed this
[49:56] no why do you allow all those things to
[49:58] happen at that old church so you can get
[50:01] here
[50:07] see church there's a bigger picture
[50:09] hallelujah
[50:10] see hallelujah if i can see if i can
[50:12] make it plain y'all know me i don't like
[50:14] being around the bush if i can make it
[50:16] plain there was a pastoral gift inside
[50:26] there was a pastoral gift
[50:29] so god had to stir up some things
[50:32] god had to make somebody believe in
[50:35] something else
[50:36] just to get him in his position
[50:44] and he says my sheep know my voice so
[50:47] god began to speak by another voice
[50:50] because you were the only sheep that
[50:52] could follow that voice
[50:58] if you would have stayed listening to
[50:59] the other voice you would have died
[51:02] because you were not connected to that
[51:04] gift you're connected to this gift
[51:12] hallelujah
[51:18] look
[51:19] look
[51:20] and let's not get it twisted
[51:22] nothing against them
[51:24] nothing against him
[51:26] but god used him for my season of change
[51:29] [Music]
[51:30] [Applause]
[51:33] so i thank god for him being what god
[51:36] made him to be
[51:38] jesus had to be judas higher so that
[51:41] jesus could be crucified
[51:47] hallelujah
[51:48] now who gonna say jesus wasn't used of
[51:51] god
[51:55] [Music]
[52:01] see god is a great orchestrator
[52:03] god knew that there were other gifts
[52:05] lying here so god had to stir the pot
[52:08] because somebody else was supposed to
[52:10] some lead somebody else was supposed to
[52:12] play somebody else was supposed to be a
[52:14] deacon somebody else was supposed to be
[52:16] a trustee somebody else was supposed to
[52:18] sing somebody else was supposed to pray
[52:21] so what god did god allowed a season to
[52:23] change to come
[52:25] what happened he was putting us in the
[52:28] path of our purpose
[52:36] i ain't gonna be long now
[52:38] i don't have no punch lines
[52:40] you pull i preach
[52:48] hallelujah
[52:49] you quit pulling i stop
[52:52] you resist i sniff
[52:54] hallelujah
[52:56] that's how it works church this gift
[52:58] belongs to you
[53:01] [Music]
[53:04] hallelujah
[53:06] church
[53:07] but if we can
[53:08] look at paul
[53:10] paul now he's entering into a season of
[53:13] change what happened in his change he
[53:15] got knocked off a horse first
[53:19] and i know founder of that horse
[53:21] probably hurt
[53:22] but that hurt was for his good
[53:24] not only did he fall off the horse and
[53:26] get hurt he also got blind in his season
[53:28] of change
[53:32] everybody else walking around when they
[53:34] sight paul in order to see more god he
[53:37] had to get blinded first
[53:40] [Applause]
[53:43] he had to get hurt he had to get blinded
[53:46] then he said who art thou lord
[53:51] see church
[53:53] in your hurt
[53:54] hallelujah in your pain
[53:57] you ought to say god what are you doing
[54:00] church satan can't touch you unless god
[54:03] allows it
[54:10] [Music]
[54:12] but look
[54:14] god i love god he's working on both ends
[54:17] paul hallelujah
[54:19] in his heart
[54:20] the gift of god was still working in his
[54:22] life because the scripture says paul had
[54:26] already had a vision of ananias coming
[54:28] to see him
[54:30] i wonder when you get hurt is your gift
[54:32] still working
[54:34] or do you tell brother brother stephen i
[54:36] ain't coming to church gas price is too
[54:39] high
[54:40] god let that gas go up to test your
[54:42] faith
[54:48] no i ain't searching for cheap gas
[54:55] i'm gonna take what i got put up to the
[54:57] pump and expect god to be god he said as
[55:01] long as i break to his storehouse first
[55:04] he said see if i won't open the windows
[55:06] of heaven
[55:07] that's a promise
[55:13] but in a season of change we riding
[55:14] around looking for cheap gas
[55:19] we're looking for a cheap way out no
[55:21] god is bringing you higher
[55:24] you know what we do we say something
[55:26] that we say ah man these guys get up to
[55:28] five dollars i ain't paying no five
[55:30] dollars you know what you do
[55:34] be right up there
[55:35] every time it go up you'll be right at
[55:37] that pump you know why because god will
[55:39] put you in position where you ain't got
[55:41] no choice
[55:46] all you can do is believe hallelujah
[55:49] and that's what he did to paul he put
[55:50] paul in a position
[55:53] where his change was coming and he
[55:55] couldn't stop it
[55:56] nobody could stop it the people he was
[55:59] running we couldn't stop it his teacher
[56:01] gamalia couldn't stop it
[56:03] the sadducees and pharisees couldn't
[56:06] stop it
[56:08] it was his season of change
[56:10] and when your season of change come your
[56:13] job can't stop
[56:14] it your family can't stop it your church
[56:17] family can't stop it
[56:24] church
[56:26] the scripture says now this is what i
[56:28] want you to understand we sing a song
[56:31] what god has for me is for me
[56:35] hallelujah
[56:37] church
[56:38] and there
[56:39] ananias is going back and forth with god
[56:42] about not wanting to go lay hands on him
[56:47] but ananias
[56:49] was a part of god's vision whether he
[56:52] like it or not
[56:58] and whether they like it or not
[57:00] we are a part of malachi 4's vision
[57:04] [Applause]
[57:09] whether they like it or not we got thus
[57:11] had the law
[57:14] whether they like it or not we will come
[57:16] into perfect faith
[57:18] we will come into perfect love we will
[57:20] come into a divine healing we will take
[57:23] a rapture
[57:26] [Music]
[57:32] god already showed it to malachi
[57:36] he already showed it to him
[57:39] and you can't stop a vision that god
[57:41] gave from coming to pass
[57:44] no matter what kind of friction you got
[57:46] no matter what your status is in the
[57:49] church
[57:50] now ananias was a big shot in god's
[57:53] church
[57:54] he was a man used of god but you know
[57:57] what he couldn't stop the vision
[57:58] pertaining to paul

[1:00:16] life comes to pass now all i got to say
[1:00:19] is look at me now
[1:00:26] church we are living by vision
[1:00:37] church
[1:00:41] in the night say no god
[1:00:43] i can't go down to this man and got
[1:00:44] orders he ain't got papers he didn't
[1:00:47] kill some people
[1:00:49] god said he's a chosen vessel
[1:00:54] oh hallelujah no matter what you think
[1:00:57] about me it can't change god's mind
[1:01:00] [Applause]
[1:01:03] no matter what you saw me do
[1:01:05] no matter what you heard if god got
[1:01:08] something for me your criticism can't
[1:01:10] stop it
[1:01:18] now i'm not making excuses for sin
[1:01:21] but what i'm saying is harley
[1:01:24] when paul's season came
[1:01:26] no matter how many people had already
[1:01:28] walked with god they couldn't stop paul
[1:01:31] from having his chance
[1:01:33] why because it was what god had to say
[1:01:36] about the matter
[1:01:37] it wasn't what the brothers or sisters
[1:01:39] had to say about the matter it was what
[1:01:41] god had to say about the matter and
[1:01:43] usually what you think about somebody
[1:01:45] ain't what god think about somebody
[1:01:48] [Applause]
[1:01:50] because entertainer said he's a murderer
[1:01:53] he does he that he throws stones and he
[1:01:55] got papers and all these things and god
[1:01:57] said he's a chosen vessel
[1:02:04] and then he says
[1:02:06] i'm going to show him
[1:02:08] how great things he must suffer
[1:02:11] for my namesake
[1:02:14] so suffering is a part of your change
[1:02:18] hallelujah because remember brother
[1:02:20] branham said i preached what paul
[1:02:22] preached holy so if we preach what paul
[1:02:24] preached there's a measure of suffering
[1:02:27] connected to that journey
[1:02:31] and it's the suffering that helps us
[1:02:33] grow it's the suffering that helps us
[1:02:35] mature
[1:02:36] it's the suffering that gets us to the
[1:02:38] next level
[1:02:45] at church finally
[1:02:47] in the night goes down there
[1:02:49] he lay hands on paul
[1:02:51] and paul receives his sight why
[1:02:54] why does he receive his sight
[1:02:56] because he will say the lord
[1:02:59] [Music]
[1:03:01] ananias
[1:03:02] was in paul's path of life
[1:03:06] and paul's path of life
[1:03:08] was the path that god ordained for him
[1:03:12] so what we need to do is be obedient
[1:03:14] hallelujah to the path god has chosen
[1:03:17] for us
[1:03:18] because when you get in that path you
[1:03:21] become invincible
[1:03:23] [Music]

[1:16:30] drink
[1:16:31] see he was looking for a woman that
[1:16:34] could fulfill his vision
[1:16:36] [Music]
[1:16:40] see the only wife of isaac was the one
[1:16:43] that could fulfill hallelujah eliezer's
[1:16:46] fishing holiday and the only wife of
[1:16:48] jesus is the one that could fulfill
[1:16:51] malachi 4's vision
[1:16:56] hallelujah
[1:17:04] the only one
[1:17:06] the only one eliezer was looking for was
[1:17:09] the one that could catch the vision
[1:17:13] [Music]
[1:17:16] and not only just catch the vision
[1:17:19] but make haste
[1:17:21] and be diligent with it
[1:17:27] it's a seasonal change
[1:17:30] see
[1:17:31] rebecca
[1:17:33] was in eliza's path
[1:17:35] hallelujah
[1:17:36] she had to be there
[1:17:38] to fulfill
[1:17:40] the steps god had ordained for eliza

[1:17:47] called us to step into the prophet's
[1:17:48] past

[1:18:10] baptists
[1:18:12] oh robert's voice was here why aren't we

[1:18:22] even though the vessel was gone
[1:18:25] we're not connected to the vessel we're
[1:18:28] connected to the voice

[1:19:28] with the vision of eliza

[1:20:38] part of who she was
[1:20:40] there was something about her that just

[1:20:44] with the scene that was unveiling in a
[1:20:46] spiritual realm

[1:20:56] into the vision
[1:21:04] [Music]
[1:21:06] church we're so much like rebecca

[1:21:46] we weren't there
[1:21:47] we didn't preach spoken word authority

[1:21:51] situations when it happened we just
[1:21:54] stepped into it
[1:22:00] why
[1:22:01] that's just who we are
[1:22:10] see what i want you to catch
[1:22:13] rebecca
[1:22:14] wasn't even thinking about eliezer
[1:22:17] [Music]
[1:22:20] it was just a part of her makeup
[1:22:23] and she just started fulfilling the
[1:22:25] vision

[1:23:03] and by the time she was finished she
[1:23:05] actually gave out 200 gallons of water

[1:24:49] [Music]
[1:24:53] church
[1:24:55] but rebecca laboring
[1:24:57] and working
[1:24:58] she didn't even realize
[1:25:00] she stepped into a vision that was going
[1:25:02] to change her life
[1:25:03] forever
[1:25:10] very simple just by being diligent
[1:25:13] it changed her life forever
[1:25:19] [Music]
[1:25:28] [Applause]
[1:25:32] it was a seasonal change
[1:25:35] but rebecca
[1:25:36] holly
[1:25:38] was in the path of eliza
[1:25:42] and isaac
[1:25:44] was in the path of rebecca
[1:25:48] and god put it all together
[1:25:51] and look
[1:25:52] the family trying to stop it from
[1:25:54] happening
[1:25:56] but let me tell you something the only
[1:25:59] one that could make up the mind and make
[1:26:00] it go forward was rebecca hallelujah
[1:26:04] amen hallelujah what's going to stop us
[1:26:06] from getting to heaven
[1:26:08] nobody
[1:26:09] because we will have to say so
[1:26:12] whether you want to go or not
[1:26:14] you have the safe zone whether you want
[1:26:16] the holy ghost you got to say so whether
[1:26:19] you want to be healed your mama can't
[1:26:21] stop you your daddy can't stop you your
[1:26:23] brothers can't stop you
[1:26:26] [Music]
[1:26:31] mama said don't leave
[1:26:33] brother said don't leave and then the
[1:26:35] prophet came and said let her choose for
[1:26:37] herself
[1:26:39] [Applause]
[1:26:42] hallelujah
[1:26:44] and right there in that moment
[1:26:46] it didn't take a revival it didn't take
[1:26:48] a prayer service rebecca said i will go
[1:26:52] [Music]
[1:26:53] i will go
[1:26:56] i will go
[1:27:00] it don't take a special meeting i will
[1:27:02] go
[1:27:07] now is the time for my season to change
[1:27:10] i will go
[1:27:14] [Applause]
[1:27:18] see nobody knew who she was
[1:27:21] she was riding that camel the very thing
[1:27:24] that she gave drink but now she got a
[1:27:26] veil over her head nobody knows who she
[1:27:29] is
[1:27:30] church the bride has a veil overhead
[1:27:32] nobody knows who we are but we're on our
[1:27:35] way to meet our isaac
[1:27:37] [Applause]
[1:27:42] we're on our way to see isaac
[1:27:48] and only isaac is going to reveal who i
[1:27:50] am
[1:27:53] [Applause]
[1:27:58] bulma got to come down to a close
[1:28:02] church
[1:28:05] but you look
[1:28:07] how god had things pre-planned
[1:28:09] how do you go from isaac abraham had to
[1:28:12] fight for a season to change
[1:28:14] hollywood to get in the right path
[1:28:16] because you know isaac was in abraham's
[1:28:18] path holland but you know who was in
[1:28:20] isaac's path jacob
[1:28:25] and god said
[1:28:27] the two being born
[1:28:29] nobody done either good or evil
[1:28:32] but jacob have i loved and he saw have i
[1:28:35] hated
[1:28:36] and he held herself served the younger
[1:28:40] so no matter what esau could have did
[1:28:42] better than jacob he was never going to
[1:28:45] get the birthright
[1:28:47] because god had already pre-planned to
[1:28:50] give it to jacob
[1:28:55] because jacob was fulfilling the vision
[1:28:57] of the promise that god gave to abraham
[1:29:00] [Music]
[1:29:03] but you look at how this how this vision
[1:29:05] unveiled honey one day he was sitting at
[1:29:08] the house
[1:29:09] and esau came in the prophet of god said
[1:29:11] he was a twin hardly and y'all know when
[1:29:13] they came out the womb they were
[1:29:14] fighting
[1:29:16] and esau looked like to be the better
[1:29:18] man
[1:29:18] jacob looked like a little sister boy
[1:29:20] sitting at home with his mama but that
[1:29:22] boy know how to cook
[1:29:24] [Laughter]
[1:29:27] sitting at home learning how to cook was
[1:29:29] going to benefit him one day
[1:29:31] nobody knew that that was the plan of
[1:29:34] god
[1:29:35] every brother kelly everybody want to be
[1:29:37] like the prophet totten god's going
[1:29:39] hunting hallelujah but somebody might
[1:29:41] need to learn how to cook
[1:29:47] hallelujah
[1:29:49] you might can't hunt you might can't
[1:29:51] fish but you so know how to cook this
[1:29:53] word
[1:29:55] [Applause]
[1:29:58] you might don't hunt you might don't
[1:30:00] fish but when you get on that pulpit you
[1:30:02] know how to cook this word
[1:30:05] [Applause]
[1:30:08] hallelujah
[1:30:11] because god gonna use that ability one
[1:30:13] day
[1:30:17] because all those who know how to
[1:30:18] imitate the prophets one day they ain't
[1:30:20] going to be able to use imitation it's
[1:30:22] going to have to be something real
[1:30:25] internship hollywood
[1:30:27] esau comes back one day
[1:30:29] hallelujah he says he said man i'm
[1:30:31] hungry
[1:30:32] and jacob just because the way he was
[1:30:35] it was pre-planned by god he was built
[1:30:38] that way he said hey i got some food
[1:30:45] i got what you need
[1:30:48] i'll tighten you right on up bro
[1:30:52] [Music]
[1:30:54] hey kayla hey he's all looking man
[1:30:58] i'm hungry give it to me he said but
[1:31:00] look the only way you're going to get
[1:31:02] this is
[1:31:03] you sell me your birthright
[1:31:07] now god
[1:31:09] start to put things in place
[1:31:12] amen he had to give hallelujah amen he
[1:31:15] had to get isaac a wife hallelujah that
[1:31:18] would lie to him
[1:31:24] so so that her son
[1:31:26] could get the birthright
[1:31:28] because she was there hallelujah
[1:31:30] in isaac's in jacob's life hallelujah
[1:31:33] she was in his path that he may receive
[1:31:36] the birthright
[1:31:40] i ain't telling none of you sisters are
[1:31:41] lying to your husband
[1:31:43] hallelujah
[1:31:44] but there was a purpose of election
[1:31:47] there
[1:31:48] hallelujah
[1:31:50] so so so so so she had to be hallelujah
[1:31:53] she had to be a woman
[1:31:55] that could say okay son i'm gonna help
[1:31:57] you trick your prophet daddy
[1:32:04] this is what you do let's put some hair

[1:32:09] stuff we're gonna spray you down so you
[1:32:11] can smell just like esau
[1:32:14] you know what was happening it was a
[1:32:16] season of change
[1:32:19] and god made sure isaac's eyes were dim
[1:32:23] so he couldn't see it was jacob
[1:32:31] and that day his discernment was a
[1:32:33] little off because he said you smell
[1:32:35] like esau but you sound like jacob but
[1:32:37] nevertheless let me bless you
[1:32:44] there's nothing that's going to stop
[1:32:46] your blessing
[1:32:47] [Music]
[1:32:51] let me speed up a little bit church this
[1:32:54] season being in god's path holly you
[1:32:56] know what was in his path
[1:32:58] anger was in his path
[1:33:02] because now that he got the birth right
[1:33:04] esau say i'ma kill him
[1:33:07] and now jacob
[1:33:09] hardly he turns into usain bolt
[1:33:14] running for his life
[1:33:15] he got to leave see sometimes change
[1:33:18] you got to leave everything behind
[1:33:22] i want you to understand
[1:33:24] let's understand what this change meant
[1:33:26] to him
[1:33:27] he had to leave his mama
[1:33:29] he had to leave his daddy holly and he
[1:33:32] couldn't even grow up with his twin
[1:33:34] brother
[1:33:36] [Music]
[1:33:38] he had to give up everything
[1:33:41] that the will and the cause of god may
[1:33:44] be fulfilled
[1:33:48] and he had to run for his life
[1:33:52] you know why he did it because there was
[1:33:54] something inside of him yearning for
[1:33:56] change
[1:34:00] and some of you they gave up everything
[1:34:02] for this message
[1:34:06] some of us they gave up jobs some of us
[1:34:08] they gave up family so they gave up
[1:34:11] churches
[1:34:14] why
[1:34:16] for greater cause
[1:34:18] what is it it's a fulfilling of god's
[1:34:21] thoughts
[1:34:25] see jacob didn't even realize
[1:34:27] he was fulfilling
[1:34:29] what god had already told rebecca
[1:34:34] the older gonna serve the younger but
[1:34:36] what did it look like he looked like
[1:34:37] jacob running away
[1:34:43] but it was the vision being fulfilled
[1:34:45] that god had already spoke over them
[1:34:48] it was election getting in place
[1:34:51] hallelujah
[1:34:53] but then we look at holiday jacobs gets
[1:34:55] down to where naming them at hollywood
[1:34:58] we're laying in a man and he sees a girl
[1:35:00] and he falls in love
[1:35:02] and he says you know what i got to have
[1:35:04] her he goes and does it right he goes
[1:35:06] and talks to the father
[1:35:10] he didn't slide into her dms

[1:35:24] he didn't go around the mama none of the
[1:35:25] parents he didn't go around the pastor
[1:35:28] see when you ain't got nothing to hide
[1:35:30] you go straight to the past and talk to
[1:35:32] him
[1:35:32] you go straight to the daddy and talk to
[1:35:34] him

[1:41:13] whatever they want to do
[1:41:18] oh my god
[1:41:22] let me get out of here church
[1:41:24] but look
[1:41:25] jacob he works
[1:41:27] seven years
[1:41:28] holly
[1:41:29] but then he gets to the altar and leah
[1:41:32] is there
[1:41:34] because the father had another plan
[1:41:36] but don't you know that was the will of
[1:41:38] god
[1:41:42] hallelujah
[1:41:43] that was the will of god
[1:41:45] harley jacob he would have gave her back
[1:41:47] why did he give her back he couldn't
[1:41:49] give her back you know why because she
[1:41:52] had went to the bad chamber
[1:41:54] she had seen this mystery she's seen his
[1:41:57] secret parts hallelujah and i'm here to
[1:41:59] tell you if you ever go to the bad
[1:42:01] chamber with jesus christ he can't give
[1:42:03] you back
[1:42:05] [Music]
[1:42:07] you can't go back
[1:42:08] no matter what they say about you you're
[1:42:10] not the one he originally won't yeah he
[1:42:12] originally wanted the jews but too late
[1:42:15] i didn't grip behind the bad chamber
[1:42:19] and he has injected his seed hallelujah
[1:42:26] but you look at the plans of god you
[1:42:28] look at hollywood a season of change
[1:42:30] not jacob has two wives one can have
[1:42:33] children and one can't and the other one
[1:42:35] is jealous of the one that can have
[1:42:36] children
[1:42:38] we'll start pushing them babies out and
[1:42:40] rachel got mad she said you know what
[1:42:42] i'ma give them my hands man
[1:42:44] then the hands may start having children
[1:42:46] then little say you know what i'm gonna
[1:42:48] give them my hands man and the hands may
[1:42:50] stop having children now i look like
[1:42:52] there's four women fighting over one man
[1:42:59] but that was the path hallelujah god
[1:43:02] ordained for jacob hallelujah because
[1:43:04] there are four women hallelujah who had
[1:43:06] the children of israel inside of them
[1:43:09] hallelujah
[1:43:10] and the only way that was gonna come out
[1:43:12] from leo rachel and two hands made
[1:43:15] that was god's plan hallelujah
[1:43:19] so sometimes what could look out of
[1:43:21] order is the order of god
[1:43:27] hallelujah
[1:43:29] but then we go past jacob and we get to
[1:43:31] joseph hallelujah
[1:43:35] and we look at it
[1:43:37] i'm gonna try to close with this
[1:43:39] you look at the church
[1:43:40] the promise of god still had to be
[1:43:42] fulfilled
[1:43:45] but now joseph he started to have dreams
[1:43:49] and his brother started to get mad at
[1:43:50] him you know i'm sick of you having
[1:43:52] dreams
[1:43:53] but just getting mad wasn't good enough
[1:43:56] he had to turn to something else
[1:43:58] so his daddy one day he made a coke
[1:44:00] y'all remember that he made a coat and
[1:44:02] he gave him that coat in front of his
[1:44:04] brothers
[1:44:05] and jacob put that coat on that coat of
[1:44:06] many colors
[1:44:08] he put that coat on in front of his
[1:44:09] brothers and he probably spent around
[1:44:11] like he was ric flair
[1:44:13] [Music]
[1:44:23] and right there from being mad from
[1:44:26] being angry turned into hatred
[1:44:30] because hatred was the only thing that
[1:44:33] was going to get him in the pit
[1:44:35] and he had to get in the pit because the
[1:44:37] the the caravan was on the way and the
[1:44:40] caravan how he was the only way he could
[1:44:42] get back to where he was supposed to be
[1:44:48] well it was a season of change but you
[1:44:50] know what it started with hatred
[1:44:55] and then god wasn't done what was in
[1:44:57] joseph's path jealousy and hatred from
[1:44:59] his brother and hallelujah then he got
[1:45:02] him part of his house and the next thing

[1:46:52] that's where we mess up hallelujah we
[1:46:54] start going through stuff and we come to
[1:46:56] church angry
[1:47:01] [Laughter]
[1:47:04] brother
[1:47:16] i hear it calling
[1:47:26] i say people like that you know what you
[1:47:28] are
[1:47:29] you like a broken washing machine
[1:47:35] because when it's balanced
[1:47:37] you can't even hear it
[1:47:40] talk to me sisters
[1:47:41] you can put that load in there and
[1:47:43] everything balanced it's just smooth
[1:47:49] even when it speeds up
[1:47:52] you can't even hear it but when that
[1:47:54] thing gets unbalanced
[1:47:58] you can hear a second in the living room
[1:48:00] you can hear a second in the kitchen you
[1:48:02] can hear it shaking in the bedroom
[1:48:04] and that's what happened when people
[1:48:06] hallelujah when they life get unbalanced
[1:48:08] and they come to church and tear up the
[1:48:10] whole anointing
[1:48:16] coming here don't want to praise him
[1:48:18] don't want to say hey man don't want to
[1:48:20] dance don't want to clap don't want to
[1:48:22] shout you want everybody to know you
[1:48:24] going through something
[1:48:35] [Applause]
[1:48:39] whether rebecca was having a bad day or
[1:48:41] not nobody knew about it
[1:48:44] she came out there with that water pot
[1:48:46] and she started working and she started
[1:48:48] working she started working she stepped
[1:48:51] into that vision
[1:49:00] he's fighting bondage
[1:49:01] he's in jail then the baker and butler
[1:49:03] comes down there
[1:49:05] and they start talking they have a dream
[1:49:06] both of them have a dream
[1:49:09] and joseph says my lord can interpret
[1:49:10] your dream
[1:49:11] so he interprets the dream three days
[1:49:13] one of y'all gonna die one day y'all
[1:49:14] gonna be restored
[1:49:15] and the one that was supposed to die he
[1:49:17] died the one that was supposed to be
[1:49:18] restored
[1:49:20] when he was getting restored when he was
[1:49:22] leaving the jailhouse
[1:49:24] now joseph has to fight being forsaken
[1:49:29] because he says remember me when you get
[1:49:31] back to your position
[1:49:34] and that's what happened to people
[1:49:35] hallelujah when they get back where
[1:49:37] they're supposed to be they forget the
[1:49:38] people that didn't pray for
[1:49:41] they forget the people that didn't call
[1:49:42] them and ask them how they doing they
[1:49:44] forget the church that they kept a good
[1:49:46] atmosphere when they was there
[1:49:50] and now he has to fight through being
[1:49:52] forsaken because the man had been
[1:49:54] restored hollywood but then
[1:49:57] god's plan
[1:50:00] all of them was in the path
[1:50:02] because through all of that
[1:50:04] joseph remained faithful
[1:50:08] through hatred
[1:50:09] through jealousy through lies
[1:50:12] through uh lust
[1:50:14] through being uh in bondage and now
[1:50:16] being forsaken god say i got another
[1:50:19] plan for you hallelujah now i'm gonna
[1:50:22] let pharaoh have a dream
[1:50:25] and the servant said i remembered my
[1:50:28] mistake
[1:50:30] there's a man down in your jail
[1:50:34] there's a man in your jail
[1:50:36] who has the gift to interpret
[1:50:40] he said bring him up he said wash him up
[1:50:43] clean him up put a ring on him change
[1:50:45] his clothes cause he finished stand
[1:50:46] before the king y'all know what that was
[1:50:48] that was a preview of the bride
[1:50:57] he wasn't even positioned yet but he was
[1:50:59] getting washed up he was getting dressed
[1:51:01] up to stand before pharaoh only to take
[1:51:03] his spot
[1:51:10] hallelujah
[1:51:11] so you let me go through trials you let
[1:51:14] me go to temptations and tribulations
[1:51:16] god has a spot that he's about to
[1:51:18] elevate us to
[1:51:21] [Music]
[1:51:28] all of that was in this path
[1:51:31] but then when he got there
[1:51:33] the gift of god just started working
[1:51:36] he said it gonna be seven years of
[1:51:37] famine
[1:51:38] seven years of increasing and then then
[1:51:40] the pharaoh said oh my god
[1:51:43] i need somebody to put over such a task
[1:51:50] and in that moment
[1:51:51] there was only one person
[1:51:54] that could get through that change
[1:51:58] there was only one person
[1:52:00] that could bring everybody else through
[1:52:02] that change
[1:52:05] and it was joseph hallelujah and now
[1:52:07] they put joseph in his seat hallelujah
[1:52:09] and joseph running the whole kingdom
[1:52:15] and the character of god when he met
[1:52:17] back up to the ones holly can you
[1:52:19] imagine now he's on the seat can you
[1:52:21] imagine zaddy what fair what uh
[1:52:23] potiphar's wife was doing every time she
[1:52:26] saw him
[1:52:29] because she know she had to lie
[1:52:33] can you imagine what the servant was
[1:52:34] doing they had forgot about him for all
[1:52:36] that time every time he saw him
[1:52:41] can you imagine hallelujah what the
[1:52:43] warden was doing in jail hulu who
[1:52:45] probably mistreated him while he was
[1:52:47] down there
[1:52:50] now he's in position hallelujah
[1:52:54] listen to me good
[1:52:56] everybody that treated them wrong
[1:52:59] they've come back around in his path
[1:53:01] where he got authority now
[1:53:05] because the bible says i make your
[1:53:07] enemies your footstool
[1:53:13] but what i love about god he gonna give
[1:53:15] you that kind of power if you can't
[1:53:16] handle it
[1:53:19] now he put everybody back in his hands
[1:53:22] why because he got the character to deal
[1:53:24] with it
[1:53:25] [Music]
[1:53:35] [Laughter]
[1:53:39] he even played a little game with his
[1:53:40] brothers but then he couldn't help but
[1:53:42] he started crying out ah it's me your
[1:53:44] brother
[1:53:49] what was it
[1:53:51] there was something in joseph harlem
[1:53:54] where he couldn't help but reveal the
[1:53:56] mystery
[1:54:07] and let them talk about you
[1:54:09] let them forsake you
[1:54:10] let them accuse you but there's
[1:54:13] something in you
[1:54:14] that can only reveal the mystery
[1:54:25] [Music]
[1:54:30] he said god has a way
[1:54:32] hallelujah
[1:54:33] we have a way
[1:54:35] but our ways are not his ways
[1:54:37] and we cannot be in our way and god's
[1:54:40] way at the same time
[1:54:45] so what i want you to do tonight i want
[1:54:47] you to examine your life and ask
[1:54:50] yourself are you living for you are you
[1:54:52] living for god
[1:55:00] he said just like a road map
[1:55:03] when i get ready to go home i don't say
[1:55:05] well now i'll set a campus that perhaps
[1:55:08] i might have direct east and north and
[1:55:10] from here well if i just took out if i
[1:55:13] just took out in that direction it would
[1:55:16] get me out the city but there's been a
[1:55:18] provided way made for me
[1:55:21] hallelujah church this message is a
[1:55:24] provided way back to heaven
[1:55:27] [Applause]
[1:55:28] [Music]
[1:55:29] he says he says i get a road map see
[1:55:33] which way the road turns the mark where
[1:55:36] i turn to the left or turn to the right
[1:55:39] and so forth and follow that map closely
[1:55:42] hallelujah
[1:55:43] i'll make my way home by the grace of
[1:55:46] god if you follow the map you'll make it
[1:55:49] back home by the grace of god
[1:55:51] that's why god
[1:55:53] the messenger hallelujah so that we
[1:55:56] could see the map plainly because
[1:55:59] there's a lot of people in here who
[1:56:01] can't read a map
[1:56:02] so god sent the prophet to spread the
[1:56:05] map out and show us that it was easy to
[1:56:08] read
[1:56:16] and when i used to have a job i used to
[1:56:18] be a truck driver and when they sent you
[1:56:20] the truck driving school one of the
[1:56:22] things you had to do is learn how to
[1:56:25] read a map
[1:56:26] but nowadays now you got gps drivers
[1:56:32] and if the gps go out they can't get the
[1:56:35] load to its destination
[1:56:40] we got too many gps christians
[1:56:45] living off the revelation of somebody
[1:56:48] else
[1:56:49] no you got to know how to read the map
[1:56:51] yourself
[1:56:53] [Music]
[1:56:57] you got to know the revelations of jesus
[1:57:00] christ for yourself
[1:57:02] you got to know why god sent the prophet
[1:57:04] yourself
[1:57:08] we're not living in a glare of another
[1:57:10] day you got to know god for yourself
[1:57:24] he says well god
[1:57:26] god has made god has a map he has a
[1:57:29] provided way for us to go home to glory
[1:57:32] he has to provide a way for salvation he
[1:57:34] has to provide a way to provide divine
[1:57:36] healing he has a provided way for the
[1:57:38] world to be operated he has a provided
[1:57:42] way hallelujah
[1:57:44] oh my i love it i love it church he says
[1:57:47] and we each one of us have a life that
[1:57:49] god has given us and we must live it
[1:57:53] there's a life that god has given each
[1:57:55] of one of us and we must live it
[1:57:58] hallelujah he said to my humble opinion
[1:58:01] if you listen to this if you get this he
[1:58:04] said i think the most best life in the
[1:58:07] world no matter whether it be
[1:58:08] up or down listen whether the best life
[1:58:11] in the world whether it be up or down
[1:58:14] somebody say up or down
[1:58:17] whether the life be up or down if we'll
[1:58:20] find god's path
[1:58:22] and work in it where god has ordained
[1:58:26] for us to walk hallelujah if we always
[1:58:30] we find victory no matter what
[1:58:38] hallelujah
[1:58:40] if you find god's path and walk in it
[1:58:43] you will walk in victory no matter what
[1:58:47] whether it's covet hallelujah 1916
[1:58:51] 18 if you walk in god's path you will
[1:58:54] have victory
[1:58:57] [Music]
[1:59:22] to show that paul's life was ordained
[1:59:25] of what god told him god told him what
[1:59:27] he said
[1:59:28] he said let me show him what he must
[1:59:31] suffer
[1:59:33] and listen paul says
[1:59:35] of the jews
[1:59:36] five times receive our 40 stripes save
[1:59:39] one
[1:59:40] thrice was beaten with rods once was
[1:59:43] stoned twice suffered shipwreck a night
[1:59:45] and day hallelujah have i been in the
[1:59:47] deep
[1:59:49] but none of that could stop him
[1:59:52] from fulfilling what god had for him
[1:59:55] hallelujah what did suffering do
[1:59:58] hallelujah
[1:59:59] oh my listen church in romans romans
[2:00:02] paul says who shall separate us from the
[2:00:04] love of god shall tribulation or
[2:00:07] distress or persecution or famine or
[2:00:10] negligence
[2:00:11] or sword hallelujah he says no what
[2:00:14] shall separate us nothing can separate
[2:00:16] us paul was speaking by revelation
[2:00:18] because he been through it
[2:00:20] [Music]
[2:00:22] paul was saying i was chosen to go
[2:00:24] through this to be an example to you
[2:00:31] hallelujah
[2:00:33] you just got to find your place where
[2:00:34] you find your place hallelujah you walk
[2:00:37] in triumph
[2:00:43] he says don't despise where god has got
[2:00:45] you
[2:00:46] but serve your purpose
[2:00:48] there's coming a great victory day one
[2:00:50] of these days
[2:00:51] where the battle is over
[2:00:56] when you find your purpose you'll be
[2:00:57] like john they say john who are you it
[2:01:00] was already prophesied by but isaiah
[2:01:02] there'll be a voice of one crying in the
[2:01:04] wilderness john stepped into that vision
[2:01:06] he said i'm the voice of one crying in
[2:01:08] the wilderness
[2:01:13] hallelujah
[2:01:14] but what was god doing in paul
[2:01:16] hallelujah why did he have to go through
[2:01:18] so much suffering because there was
[2:01:20] something in paul that god wanted back
[2:01:25] there was something he put in paul
[2:01:26] before the foundation of the world and
[2:01:28] god had wanted it back and the only way
[2:01:31] he could get it from him is through
[2:01:32] suffering hallelujah
[2:01:34] and what did it start hallelujah it
[2:01:36] started hallelujah in paul was the book
[2:01:39] of corinthians in paul was the book of
[2:01:41] ever since in paul was the book of
[2:01:43] philippians in paul the book of
[2:01:45] galatians imposed the book of colossians
[2:01:48] in paul with the book of romans in paul
[2:01:50] was philemon in paul was timothy
[2:01:55] and it took suffering to bring those
[2:01:58] books out
[2:01:59] because paul would start the book i paul
[2:02:02] an apostle
[2:02:10] paul in jail writing books of the bible
[2:02:15] what was it was the suffering bringing
[2:02:17] it out suffering was a part of god
[2:02:20] bringing out revelation
[2:02:21] [Applause]
[2:02:24] see god will put things in your path to
[2:02:27] bring out what he has in you
[2:02:29] that's why david was always in a battle
[2:02:31] why because the book of songs was in
[2:02:33] david david would go through a battle
[2:02:35] and david would begin to say the lord is
[2:02:38] my shepherd
[2:02:43] whom shall i fear the lord is on my side
[2:02:50] [Music]
[2:02:53] you know
[2:02:54] am i closing
[2:02:56] bethsheba
[2:02:58] was a part of david's suffering
[2:03:03] and david had to go through that
[2:03:05] david had to lie
[2:03:07] david had to produce premeditated murder
[2:03:10] david had to put the man on the first
[2:03:12] line
[2:03:13] then david had to be addressed by the
[2:03:14] prophet that was the only way he was
[2:03:16] going to see himself
[2:03:22] because he didn't see anything wrong
[2:03:23] with the way he was living but when the
[2:03:25] prophet came and began to show him his
[2:03:28] self david fell to his knees and said
[2:03:30] lord i have sinned
[2:03:33] so it took this message holy to bring
[2:03:36] forth a real repentance in the church
[2:03:42] because we were not living up to the
[2:03:43] standard of what was revealed
[2:03:47] that's why we repent
[2:03:49] we repeat because we've been called to a
[2:03:51] higher calling in god
[2:03:53] and we say lord i'm sorry lord i should
[2:03:56] be living with perfect love i should be
[2:03:59] walking with perfect faith i should be
[2:04:01] producing divine healing
[2:04:10] and it was by
[2:04:12] that mistake
[2:04:14] with beersheba
[2:04:16] that we got one of the greatest psalms
[2:04:18] ever
[2:04:21] creating me
[2:04:23] [Music]
[2:04:34] cast me not away
[2:04:37] from thy presence
[2:04:40] oh lord
[2:04:43] take not thy holy spirit from me
[2:04:48] now listen to david confess david say
[2:04:51] restore
[2:04:52] unto me
[2:04:55] the joy of thy salvation
[2:05:00] and renew my spirit within me
[2:05:07] took david to go through all that to
[2:05:09] give us that song
[2:05:15] it took paul to go through all that
[2:05:17] to give us half of the new testament
[2:05:23] and what you're going through
[2:05:25] is for the benefit of somebody else
[2:05:32] somebody's watching you
[2:05:35] somebody's watching you
[2:05:37] what are they watching they're watching
[2:05:39] you produce life
[2:05:42] [Music]
[2:05:43] because it's a season of change
[2:05:47] church
[2:05:49] that caterpillar
[2:05:51] for the first half of his life he
[2:05:52] struggles
[2:05:53] everywhere he goes an inch it's an inch
[2:05:55] it's an inch and then he gets to a stage
[2:05:57] where he just looks downright
[2:06:00] ugly
[2:06:02] he's in a cocoon looks like a mess
[2:06:06] nobody understands what he's going
[2:06:08] through
[2:06:09] he ain't fellowshipping with nobody
[2:06:11] he's still in the same place he ain't
[2:06:13] moving he's doing nothing he in a mess
[2:06:17] but that stage of his life is ordained
[2:06:19] of god
[2:06:22] but then there's gonna come a season
[2:06:25] where the cocoon gets weak hallelujah
[2:06:28] and the thing that once bind him he's
[2:06:30] stronger than it now huh and then he
[2:06:32] gets one wing out hallelujah then he
[2:06:34] gets the other wing out he gets the head
[2:06:36] out and then he begins to fly away from
[2:06:40] his past
[2:06:42] whoa he begins to fly away from his
[2:06:46] troubles he begins to fly away from that
[2:06:49] thing that once bound him
[2:06:51] never to return again
[2:07:03] [Music]
[2:07:06] so church
[2:07:08] you go back how many other years it was
[2:07:12] and you look at all the confusion
[2:07:14] and god did all that
[2:07:17] so that he could come out of his cocoon
[2:07:20] and the rest of y'all could come with
[2:07:22] him
[2:07:29] if i could be frank if i could be frank
[2:07:32] if things would have never happened
[2:07:35] you'll still be there
[2:07:38] y'all still be there
[2:07:41] but god allows certain things to take
[2:07:43] place
[2:07:44] why
[2:07:46] so new life
[2:07:48] and new growth
[2:07:50] could come forth
[2:07:56] spoken word tabernacle
[2:07:58] so when i see spoken word tabernacle
[2:08:00] hallelujah
[2:08:01] i see new growth
[2:08:05] hallelujah
[2:08:07] it's not a different plant
[2:08:08] it's the same plant but it's just new
[2:08:11] growth
[2:08:12] why because it's a new season
[2:08:14] oh yeah

[2:08:18] other tree it comes from the same tree
[2:08:21] hallelujah
[2:08:22] it comes from the same tree it's just
[2:08:24] pushing out new growth
[2:08:27] hallelujah
[2:08:28] so y'all may be in a different location
[2:08:30] but y'all still on the same tree
[2:08:36] [Music]
[2:08:40] god know what he doing
[2:08:48] sometimes
[2:08:49] what we need to do
[2:08:51] is just throw our hands up and say yes
[2:08:53] law
[2:08:58] because you're going to have to go
[2:08:59] through things that you don't understand
[2:09:02] but just notice if you're a child of god
[2:09:06] there's a divine purpose in it
[2:09:13] there's a purpose that election may be
[2:09:16] fulfilled
