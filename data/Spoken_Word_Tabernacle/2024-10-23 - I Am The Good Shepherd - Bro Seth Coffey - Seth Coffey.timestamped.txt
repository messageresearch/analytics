[54:38] unto you he that entereth not by the
[54:41] door into the Sheep F but climbeth up
[54:43] some other way the same as a thief and a
[54:46] robber but he that entereth in by the
[54:49] door is The Shepherd of the sheep that's
[54:52] right to him that Porter openeth and the
[54:55] Sheep he he his voice and he calleth his
[54:58] own Sheep by name amen and leadth them
[55:01] out and when he putteth forth his own
[55:04] sheep he goeth before them and the Sheep
[55:07] follow him for they know his voice and a
[55:11] stranger will they not follow but will
[55:13] flee from him for they know not the
[55:15] voice of strangers that's right this
[55:18] Parable Jesus this Parable spake Jesus
[55:21] unto them but they understood not what
[55:23] things they were which he spoke unto
[55:25] them then Jesus said unto them again
[55:27] verily verily I say unto you I am the
[55:30] door of the sheep all that ever came
[55:33] before me are thieves and robbers but
[55:35] the Sheep did not hear them I am the
[55:39] door by me if any man Enter he shall be
[55:42] saved and shall go in and out and find
[55:45] pasture the thief cometh not but for to
[55:49] steal and kill and to destroy and I am
[55:52] come that they might have life and that
[55:54] they might have it more of
[55:56] abundantly I am the Good Shepherd yes
[55:59] sir the Good Shepherd giveth his life
[56:02] for the Sheep am but he that is a
[56:05] hirling and not a Shepherd whose own the
[56:08] Sheep are not seeth the wolf coming and
[56:11] leaveth the sheep and fleeth and the
[56:14] Wolf catcheth them and scattereth the
[56:16] Sheep the hirling fleeth because he is
[56:19] in hirling and careth not for the Sheep
[56:22] he said but I am the Good Shepherd and I
[56:25] know my sheep and am known of mine as
[56:28] the father knoweth me even so know I the
[56:31] father and I Lay My Life down I lay down
[56:36] my life for the sheep and other sheep I
[56:38] have you better be thankful for this and
[56:41] other sheep I have which are not of this
[56:43] fold that's the Gentiles amen them also
[56:48] I must bring and they shall hear my
[56:50] voice I want you to notice there it's
[56:52] not a if it's not a maybe they shall
[56:54] hear my voice and there shall be one
[56:57] fold and one Shepherd therefore if doeth
[57:00] my father love me because I lay down my
[57:02] life that I may take it again no man
[57:05] taketh it from me but I lay it down
[57:07] myself I have power to lay it down and I
[57:09] have power to take it again this
[57:11] commandment have I received of my father
[57:15] there was a division there again among
[57:18] the Jews of these sayings and many of
[57:20] them said he hath a devil and is mad why
[57:24] hear ye him see but they couldn't help
[57:26] but hear him cuz they were his Sheep
[57:28] amen others said these are not the words
[57:31] of him that have a devil can a devil
[57:33] Open the Eyes of the Blind and it was at
[57:35] Jerusalem the Feast of the dedication it
[57:38] and it was Winter and Jesus walked in
[57:41] the temple in Solomon's porch then came
[57:43] the Jews around about him and said unto
[57:46] him how long to thou make us to doubt if
[57:49] thou be the Christ tell us plainly Jesus
[57:51] answer to them I told you and you
[57:54] believe not the works that I do in my
[57:56] father's name they bear witness of me
[57:59] but ye believe not because ye are not of
[58:01] my sheep as I said unto you my sheep
[58:05] hear my voice and I know them and they
[58:11] follow me and I give unto them eternal
[58:15] life and they shall never perish neither
[58:19] shall any man pluck them out of my hand
[58:22] my Father which gave them me is greater
[58:25] than all and no man is able no man is
[58:29] able to pluck them out of my father's
[58:32] hand I am my father are one amen amen

[59:25] take take over the preacher almighty God
[59:27] but take over the congregation Lord be
[59:30] the one Among Us father God be the
[59:32] welcome one in this place Lord we pray
[59:34] that tonight almighty God it wouldn't
[59:36] just be a regular service father but but
[59:38] Lord I we could have what we expect Lord
[59:40] and I expect you to do great things
[59:42] tonight Lord Lord I don't understand why
[59:44] you went this way but God I know the
[59:46] Good Shepherd knows why and father I
[59:48] pray that tonight Lord Lord you would

[59:56] hearted almighty God lord encourage and

[1:00:08] the service when the last amen is said
[1:00:10] father we're not going to lift up any
[1:00:12] man outside of the man Christ Jesus
[1:00:14] tonight Lord father we pray that you
[1:00:16] would have your will and way in this
[1:00:18] service Lord touch each and every heart
[1:00:20] father for such a time as this Lord in
[1:00:23] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may
[1:00:26] have your seats tonight amen you as I
[1:00:28] said the Lord was dealing on me I am the
[1:00:31] Good Shepherd you know I've never
[1:00:32] preached on the shepherd and what a
[1:00:34] Shepherd is and different things but but
[1:00:36] it just came to my heart and and I begin
[1:00:38] to look into it and you know we'll just
[1:00:40] we'll just go through here it might be
[1:00:41] kind of simple tonight but I believe
[1:00:43] it's just simply good because it's the
[1:00:44] word of God Amen but what is a Shepherd
[1:00:47] in the Bible a Shepherd is a person that
[1:00:50] tends to feeds and protect sheep and you
[1:00:53] know a Shepherd knows his sheep there's
[1:00:56] no end of what a Shepherd will do to
[1:00:58] protect his sheep if he's a good
[1:01:00] shepherd there's nothing that he won't
[1:01:01] do to be able to try to take care of
[1:01:04] those sheep and and you know he'll even
[1:01:05] lay his very life down for those sheep
[1:01:08] and and you know he is faithful to the
[1:01:10] sheep and and we look back in the Bible
[1:01:12] and I think when we think of a Shepherd
[1:01:14] probably the first person that we think
[1:01:16] of is King David in the Bible because
[1:01:18] before he was ever a king he was first a
[1:01:21] Shepherd amen and he knew what it was
[1:01:23] like to take care of the father's sheep
[1:01:25] and and we find in first Samuel that
[1:01:28] that you know but I thought it was so
[1:01:30] amazing that that that David thought so
[1:01:33] much of being a Shepherd that that even
[1:01:35] when the king came to or when when when
[1:01:38] when Samuel came to pick out a King
[1:01:40] David couldn't make it to the meeting
[1:01:42] because David was too busy taking care
[1:01:44] of the father's sheep that was that was
[1:01:46] his whole life was to take care of the
[1:01:48] father's sheep come what made he was
[1:01:50] going to take care of those
[1:01:52] sheep we find in 1 Samuel when when he
[1:01:55] would go to the battle when he would see
[1:01:57] Goliath and and not trying to dwell on
[1:01:59] that as much but what David said here is
[1:02:01] powerful and he said David son said unto
[1:02:04] Saul thy servant kept his father sheep
[1:02:07] and there came a lion and a bear and
[1:02:09] took a lamb out of the flock now I want
[1:02:11] you to notice that how powerful this is
[1:02:13] because it wasn't multiple Lambs but it
[1:02:15] was one lamb that compelled David it
[1:02:19] wasn't multiple Lambs but just one lamb
[1:02:21] was too many for the enemy to come in
[1:02:24] and take that lamb amen thank you Lord
[1:02:27] and a bear and it took a lamb out of the
[1:02:29] flock not the multiple ones but the
[1:02:31] heart of the shepherd one is too many
[1:02:34] one is too many in the heart of the
[1:02:37] shepherd and he said and I went out
[1:02:39] after him and and I smoted him and
[1:02:41] delivered it out of the mouth and when
[1:02:43] he arose against me I caught him by his
[1:02:46] beard and smote him I love that because
[1:02:49] he not only set the little lamb free he
[1:02:51] not only set the captive free but he
[1:02:53] killed the Lamb's Enemy at the time
[1:02:56] [Music]
[1:02:57] [Applause]
[1:02:59] Hallelujah and my servant slew both The
[1:03:01] Lion and the
[1:03:03] bear we know that a pastor is considered
[1:03:05] a Shepherd of the flock and and you have
[1:03:07] a wonderful Pastor you know a real
[1:03:10] pastor and a real Shepherd of the flock
[1:03:12] you know if he's a good shepherd he's
[1:03:14] always watching The Flock he's always
[1:03:17] trying to notice things he's always
[1:03:18] trying to to look and for the benefit of
[1:03:21] you it's not for the benefit of himself
[1:03:23] but it's because he cares for the Sheep
[1:03:27] you know he he will begin to notice when
[1:03:29] you're not your normal self he'll be you
[1:03:31] know what I'm talking about you're
[1:03:33] sitting there in church and you're going
[1:03:34] I hope he don't look at me I hope he
[1:03:36] don't look at me because he knows that
[1:03:38] he'll know that something ain't right
[1:03:40] he'll know that I'm used to Jumping Up
[1:03:42] and praising God and today I'm a little
[1:03:44] bit cold and I'm sitting right here but
[1:03:46] that Shepherd will begin to discern that
[1:03:48] out and you know he he'll be looking for
[1:03:50] that you know when you're missing when
[1:03:52] you're missing from church he'll begin
[1:03:54] to notice he'll begin to look and he'll
[1:03:57] begin to say you know there's something
[1:03:58] not right here he's not here and you
[1:04:00] know and you know what else he'll do
[1:04:02] he'll make sure he'll make sure he'll
[1:04:05] take his time and he'll study to make
[1:04:07] sure the Lambs are feeding on the right
[1:04:09] things he'll make sure you're not just
[1:04:11] feeding on garbage or anything that'll
[1:04:13] make you sick but he's a real
[1:04:19] Shepherd he's constantly at the
[1:04:22] door making sure no evil spirit will get
[1:04:25] in that's you know a lot of times and
[1:04:27] I'm going to say this here for your
[1:04:28] benefit there's a lot of times that a
[1:04:30] spirit will try to rise up on you
[1:04:33] because your pastor will try to bring
[1:04:35] something out of the church and you'll
[1:04:36] begin to say oh he's just being mean no
[1:04:38] it's because he cares for you it's
[1:04:39] because he's sitting there at the door
[1:04:42] and when he sees something come in the
[1:04:44] church that ain't supposed to be there
[1:04:45] he's a good
[1:04:47] [Applause]
[1:04:51] shepherd but you know if something does
[1:04:54] happen to you uh-huh and you find
[1:04:57] yourself out there you know what a good
[1:04:58] shepherd does he comes looking for you
[1:05:00] that's right he'll call you over and
[1:05:02] over again and you'll let that phone
[1:05:04] ring but that Shepherd will continue to
[1:05:07] call he'll be continue to text are you
[1:05:09] okay what's because you know why he's a
[1:05:12] shepherd He will do everything yes sir
[1:05:15] that he can to help
[1:05:17] you but you know what there wouldn't be
[1:05:20] no need for a Shepherd if there weren't
[1:05:24] sheep there wouldn't be no need for a
[1:05:26] Shepherd if there weren't
[1:05:27] [Applause]
[1:05:31] sheep you know why there's a Shepherd
[1:05:33] cuz sheep need
[1:05:36] [Music]
[1:05:37] one brother BR says we learned a lot of
[1:05:39] thing about
[1:05:41] sheep if we would just notice them and
[1:05:44] watch their actions and a sheep is a
[1:05:47] sacrificial animal little innocent
[1:05:50] fellow that don't mean you got I'm not
[1:05:53] even trying to go this way but it just
[1:05:54] keeps coming up that don't mean you have
[1:05:56] to argue with your pastor over every
[1:05:57] little thing that he does he's a
[1:06:00] Shepherd that's free that's free brother
[1:06:03] St and sheep is a sacrificial animal
[1:06:07] little innocent fellow and he's totally
[1:06:09] helpless when he's lost that's right and
[1:06:11] I think that's why Jesus likened us unto
[1:06:13] sheep because they just can't seem to
[1:06:15] find their way around they have to
[1:06:17] depend on someone leading them listen I
[1:06:20] don't know if you know this but before
[1:06:22] you were born again you tried to lead
[1:06:24] yourself and and you tried to do
[1:06:26] different things and even even after
[1:06:27] you've got born again there was times
[1:06:29] when you tried to lead yourself and you
[1:06:30] said God I know you said to go this way
[1:06:32] but but I think it'll be better if I
[1:06:34] just go this way and before you know it
[1:06:36] you're a little lost sheep because sheep
[1:06:39] need someone to lead
[1:06:42] them yes
[1:06:44] sir they have to depend on someone
[1:06:47] leading them and they cannot lead one
[1:06:50] another you know when I thought of that
[1:06:52] I thought of that story in the Bible and
[1:06:54] that that that was told there when when
[1:06:57] Ahab wanted to go up and take the land
[1:06:59] and he began to say I've got 400
[1:07:02] prophets you see how they tried to the
[1:07:03] Sheep of Israel tried to lead themselves
[1:07:06] and they were trying to find their own
[1:07:08] way and then Jehoshaphat said well is't
[1:07:10] there just one more isn't there just one
[1:07:12] more and they went to Micah and you know
[1:07:14] what Micah said he said I won't say
[1:07:16] nothing save what the shepherd says if I
[1:07:18] can word it that way he said I'm not
[1:07:20] going to say nothing but what what what
[1:07:22] the Lord God says and they begin to say
[1:07:24] well if you do it this way you you know
[1:07:26] you'll get you'll get a better position
[1:07:27] in church and you'll you you you'll
[1:07:29] flourish and different things but he
[1:07:31] said no I'm only going to say what the
[1:07:33] Lord thy God says and he came out and he
[1:07:36] gave him the word of the Lord and he
[1:07:37] said go on
[1:07:39] up go if you want to go in your own way
[1:07:41] going on up but I seen Israel scattered
[1:07:45] like sheep without a Shepherd you can't
[1:07:49] lead
[1:07:51] yourself if you try to lead yourself or
[1:07:54] let man lead you you're going to fall
[1:07:56] and
[1:07:59] fail they just won't do it and that goes
[1:08:01] to show me one thing if we are likened
[1:08:04] to sheep in God's Heritage then we
[1:08:06] cannot lead one another we are helpless
[1:08:09] and we've got to depend on the great
[1:08:11] Shepherd don't look for a great ministry
[1:08:14] don't look to follow another brother
[1:08:16] listen a brother can fall but the
[1:08:18] shepherd can never
[1:08:19] [Applause]
[1:08:22] fall hear his voice that's right you
[1:08:25] know you can go ahead I say like my if
[1:08:27] you want to follow your own voice go
[1:08:29] ahead but don't be surprised when you're
[1:08:32] scattered if you want to follow your own
[1:08:34] ideas go ahead but don't be surprised
[1:08:36] when it leads you to
[1:08:38] destruction but you need a Shepherd but
[1:08:40] if you listen to the shepherd the
[1:08:42] shepherd will never lead you astray am
[1:08:45] scripture says he goeth before them and
[1:08:46] the Sheep follow him for they know his
[1:08:48] voice oh church I I watched a little
[1:08:51] video before I came and and there was a
[1:08:53] shepherd and this Shepherd begin to step
[1:08:56] out and and and and there was a whole a
[1:08:58] whole herd of sheep there and they
[1:09:00] brought different people up and and I
[1:09:02] don't know what language it was but he
[1:09:04] was telling to call the Sheep call the
[1:09:06] sheep and somebody that wasn't a
[1:09:08] Shepherd be to step up and it be to call
[1:09:11] under the sheep and that and that person
[1:09:13] began to say in so many words come here
[1:09:15] sheep come here and the Sheep didn't
[1:09:18] even raise their
[1:09:19] head and then they let another person
[1:09:22] come out and say well call the sheep and
[1:09:24] the person began to call the sheep and
[1:09:26] and you know the Sheep never even moved
[1:09:28] they didn't even act like they heard
[1:09:33] anything then the next person walked out
[1:09:35] and it began to say something and it
[1:09:37] might have been the right words but it
[1:09:39] wasn't the way the master said
[1:09:42] it they know the master's voice and a
[1:09:45] stranger they would not follow but when
[1:09:47] the Fourth Man stepped out he began to
[1:09:50] say come here sheep and when he said
[1:09:53] that they went
[1:09:56] you know why because the fourth man was
[1:09:58] The Shepherd of the
[1:10:00] flock and when they heard the shepherd's
[1:10:02] voice they begin to rise up and one of
[1:10:06] them begin to look at the other one and
[1:10:07] was like that's was the Shepherd that
[1:10:10] was the shepherd and the next one look
[1:10:12] at the other one and they begin to go ba
[1:10:15] b b and they begin to bleat and they
[1:10:18] begin to cry and they begin to run to
[1:10:21] the
[1:10:22] shepherd because they knew the voice of
[1:10:25] the shepherd and a stranger they would
[1:10:27] not
[1:10:28] follow you know that you you know let me
[1:10:31] just tell you something powerful tonight
[1:10:32] you are so blessed to be able to hear
[1:10:35] this
[1:10:36] message you are so
[1:10:39] blessed because you know what you can't
[1:10:42] take a pig and turn him into a
[1:10:45] sheep you can take him and you can try
[1:10:47] to paint him up brother brandham said
[1:10:49] you can try to take a dog and make it
[1:10:50] look as much like a sheep but you know
[1:10:52] the life that was in that was never a
[1:10:54] sheep
[1:10:56] but if you're a sheep tonight you're an
[1:10:58] elected called out
[1:11:00] person for a
[1:11:03] purpose you always were a sheep you
[1:11:05] never were a pig or a dog turned into a
[1:11:07] sheep that is impossible for every kind
[1:11:10] of Life produces the same kind and
[1:11:12] there's no change in species as we were
[1:11:14] in the thought of God then expressed in
[1:11:17] flesh we had to come a day when we would
[1:11:20] hear his voice the word and hearing that
[1:11:22] voice become aware that the father was
[1:11:25] calling us and recognize that we were
[1:11:28] the sons of
[1:11:31] God think about a shepherd He will not
[1:11:33] lose a sheep now another thing you
[1:11:35] notice about sheep and the shepherd you
[1:11:37] know it's a disgrace for the shepherd to
[1:11:39] lose one sheep did you know that it's a
[1:11:42] reproach on the shepherd now I'm going
[1:11:45] now hold wide now oh my yes sir if the
[1:11:48] shepherd loses one sheep it's a disgrace
[1:11:50] on him all the father has given me will
[1:11:53] come and none's L oh see that all that
[1:11:56] comes to me all right the shepherd can't
[1:12:00] afford I'm going to say this Jesus has
[1:12:03] twoo much in you to lose
[1:12:05] you he's done too much for you to lose
[1:12:08] you and none's law all the father gives
[1:12:11] me will come in none's Lost see that all
[1:12:14] that comes to me all right the shepherd
[1:12:16] can't afford to lose the Sheep that's
[1:12:19] the reason you backslider tonight he's
[1:12:21] still hanging around your heart trying
[1:12:23] to draw you back to the f because once
[1:12:26] he's kissed you and you kissed him and
[1:12:28] told him that you loved him and raised
[1:12:30] your hands and praised him and you
[1:12:33] backslid and went out there and got all
[1:12:35] butchered up and wounded up in your
[1:12:38] spirit but he still holds around you all
[1:12:41] the
[1:12:42] time you see your condition doesn't
[1:12:44] change the shepherd your condition
[1:12:47] doesn't change how the shepherd thinks
[1:12:48] about
[1:12:52] you come back wondering sheep
[1:12:55] I just can't afford to let you be lost
[1:12:58] maybe the little sheep that he had to go
[1:13:00] away on that mountain to find all
[1:13:03] through the place maybe you're that
[1:13:05] sheep tonight laying out there wounded
[1:13:07] somewhere but the shepherd can't afford
[1:13:10] to lose one sheep Hallelujah let me just
[1:13:13] say tonight all the times that you
[1:13:15] thought you didn't give up it was never
[1:13:17] you that didn't give up it was the
[1:13:20] Shepherd that wouldn't give up on you
[1:13:25] all that the father hath given me will
[1:13:28] come to me Satan can't pluck you out of
[1:13:31] his
[1:13:33] [Applause]
[1:13:34] hand the shepherd knows your name he
[1:13:37] knows everything about you can I say
[1:13:40] this the shepherd knows more about you
[1:13:41] than you know about
[1:13:42] [Applause]
[1:13:44] [Music]
[1:13:44] [Applause]
[1:13:48] yourself oh what a shepherd He is he had
[1:13:51] he gives account for every sheep every
[1:13:54] hour of the day no matter where you're
[1:13:56] at he knows where you're at glory to God
[1:14:00] you know sometimes I think we make God a
[1:14:02] little bit too distant sometimes I think
[1:14:04] we get put God so far but let me tell
[1:14:06] you even right now tonight God is the
[1:14:09] shepherd He knows everything about you
[1:14:12] he knows everything that you're going
[1:14:13] through he knew about it before you got
[1:14:16] there because he's the door he's laying
[1:14:21] there no matter where you're at he gives
[1:14:24] you he knows where you're at he knows
[1:14:26] all about you the reason he can stand
[1:14:28] here at the
[1:14:30] platform through yielded people and
[1:14:32] reveal and tell and talk he knows he
[1:14:35] knows where you was at a year ago he
[1:14:38] knows where you're at all the time he
[1:14:40] has to give an account for his sheep
[1:14:43] ever and especially they're all
[1:14:45] renumbered again after they're gathered
[1:14:46] into the fold I thought what a beautiful
[1:14:48] picture Gathering them into the fold and
[1:14:51] numbering them listen I want you to
[1:14:53] realize that that same God let's Oh
[1:14:56] Glory to God when when the when when the
[1:14:57] son of man was revealing himself again
[1:15:00] in this day you know what he did he
[1:15:02] revealed I'm still that
[1:15:04] Shepherd he came out I love that and I
[1:15:06] came remember the story but I know
[1:15:07] brother Billy Paul told a testimony
[1:15:09] where where a man was watching and and
[1:15:11] he began to watch that discernment going
[1:15:13] on and it said you're such and such from
[1:15:15] so and so and I heard that that was
[1:15:17] exactly right and they said you're such
[1:15:19] and such from so and so with this
[1:15:20] problem and he said that was exactly
[1:15:22] right but then a little sister walked up
[1:15:24] and he to say you live at 102 Elm Street
[1:15:27] or something like that and he said oh he
[1:15:28] missed it there I missed it what said he
[1:15:31] said he missed it there because I know
[1:15:33] she lives down here at a such and such
[1:15:35] place and they begin to go out and that
[1:15:38] woman got healed and rejoice and they
[1:15:40] came out and he said I was I he said I
[1:15:42] was so discouraged because I I just want
[1:15:44] to say it this way I was so discouraged
[1:15:46] because I thought the shepherd got it
[1:15:48] wrong I thought the shepherd didn't know
[1:15:50] where one of his sheep were I thought
[1:15:52] the shepherd had it all figured out and
[1:15:54] the shepherd knew every hair on their
[1:15:55] head but the shepherd got this one wrong
[1:15:58] Hallelujah and you know what even the
[1:16:00] Sheep got it wrong and everyone else in
[1:16:02] the congregation got it wrong but the
[1:16:04] shepherd never gets it wrong because he
[1:16:06] walked out there and he heard him
[1:16:08] talking to some other sisters and said
[1:16:10] sister he he he he he said you live you
[1:16:13] live at 102 Elm Street we know you live
[1:16:15] over here and oh I forgot to tell you
[1:16:17] I'm
[1:16:19] moved you see the shepherd will never
[1:16:22] lose his own he will never forget his
[1:16:26] own and what others may not know about
[1:16:29] you almighty God
[1:16:30] [Applause]
[1:16:33] [Music]
[1:16:34] does the shepherd will do whatever it
[1:16:37] takes he will do whatever it takes to
[1:16:40] get to one of his sheep you know there
[1:16:43] was a little story in the
[1:16:44] Bible Oh Glory to God in St John 5 there
[1:16:49] was a little
[1:16:50] woman there was a little woman at a wh
[1:16:53] and and Jesus began to begin to look at
[1:16:55] the disciples and said I have needs to
[1:16:57] go by
[1:17:00] Samaria why do he have needs cuz there
[1:17:02] was a lamb down there there was a little
[1:17:05] lost lamb down there and they they begin
[1:17:07] to say Lord don't go down there don't go
[1:17:10] down there in that field don't go down
[1:17:11] to that
[1:17:12] place but you see one lamb is too
[1:17:17] much I will not lose a
[1:17:22] one he said I have needs to go back by
[1:17:27] Samaria Peter didn't want to go by
[1:17:30] Samaria John didn't want to go by Sam
[1:17:33] they you know Israel would make a point
[1:17:36] to try to go around Samaria they would
[1:17:39] add time in the day to try to go around
[1:17:43] Samaria but the Good Shepherd said I got
[1:17:46] to get to one of my
[1:17:48] [Applause]

[1:17:52] mountain is how low the valley is you

[1:21:30] church to entertain the pastor or the
[1:21:33] person beside you but it was about
[1:21:35] entertaining Jesus
[1:21:37] Christ when it was your full objective
[1:21:40] and motive to serve Jesus Christ when
[1:21:43] you could hear his voice when his voice
[1:21:46] spoke to you and it said don't do
[1:21:48] something you didn't do it hallu and
[1:21:50] when it told you to do something you did
[1:21:52] it
[1:21:56] [Applause]
[1:22:01] the shepherd's calling
[1:22:03] tonight that ain't me I wasn't going to
[1:22:05] say
[1:22:08] that I don't ever say things like that
[1:22:11] unless the Lord says
[1:22:13] [Applause]
[1:22:15] saying where did it go where did it go
[1:22:18] you know where it is where we left
[1:22:21] it you know where that love is that you
[1:22:23] once had to serve God with all your
[1:22:25] heart and with all your might you know
[1:22:27] where it is right where you left
[1:22:29] it you know one thing I've learned in my
[1:22:32] life you don't really realize
[1:22:34] something's missing till you go looking
[1:22:35] for
[1:22:39] it you know I know I know I have a
[1:22:42] certain gun a muzzle loer that I'll have
[1:22:44] in a case somewhere put up and I need
[1:22:46] that for deer season I go oh I I I know
[1:22:48] I got it and I'll begin to go look for
[1:22:51] it and I thought I put it in my basement
[1:22:53] but I put it in the top of my cloth
[1:22:55] but see I thought it was I thought it
[1:22:56] was right there in the safe but it was
[1:22:58] in the top of my closet but I didn't
[1:23:00] realize it was missing till I went and
[1:23:01] looked for
[1:23:04] it and there'll be something in a
[1:23:05] service that comes up and you'll begin
[1:23:07] to go you know I used to worship over
[1:23:09] that I used to praise God over that you
[1:23:11] know when those things came up in my
[1:23:13] life that thing didn't used to bother me
[1:23:14] but now it bothers me why because you
[1:23:16] lost it because you started looking at
[1:23:19] other things you know what it was you
[1:23:20] started listening to other voices
[1:23:22] outside of the shepherd
[1:23:32] brother I'm a million miles off from my
[1:23:35] notes I don't even know I don't even
[1:23:37] know how to get
[1:23:41] [Applause]
[1:23:47] back it's not that we lost our salvation
[1:23:50] but I think sometimes we lose the joy of
[1:23:52] it that's it
[1:23:54] [Applause]
[1:23:58] let's just try to continue
[1:24:00] on you see
[1:24:02] church when a sermon is going forth and
[1:24:04] the word of God's
[1:24:07] speaking it's not you searching for God
[1:24:09] it's God searching for
[1:24:14] you this
[1:24:16] evening this evening you said I'm going
[1:24:19] to go to church when the whole time it
[1:24:22] was God calling you to church
[1:24:24] [Applause]
[1:24:29] you would you wouldn't have made it you
[1:24:32] wouldn't have lasted had it not been for
[1:24:34] the
[1:24:37] [Music]
[1:24:39] shepherd then after he gets them all
[1:24:41] numbered and they're beded down the
[1:24:43] shepherd goes down by this hole where
[1:24:46] the Sheep come in and lays yes sir
[1:24:49] himself down across the hole right then
[1:24:52] no wolf can come in uh-huh no Thief can
[1:24:55] come in no harm can come in unless it
[1:24:57] comes over the shepherd
[1:24:59] first what a picture of Christ laying
[1:25:01] himself down for us that nothing can
[1:25:04] harm us unless it comes over him that's
[1:25:07] right so if you're sick and you say
[1:25:08] brother brandom sickness crossed over
[1:25:10] him but it was for the glory of God
[1:25:13] that's right he wants to maybe give you
[1:25:15] a testimony as the fellow said one time
[1:25:18] he seen a shepherd and it's was packing
[1:25:22] a sheep and he said well it had its leg
[1:25:23] all band Ed up and he said well what did
[1:25:26] you do what's the matter did it fall off
[1:25:28] a cliff he said no I broke its leg I
[1:25:31] tell you church sometimes we need God
[1:25:33] just to break our
[1:25:36] leg oh he said you must be a cruel
[1:25:38] Shepherd to break your own sheep's leg
[1:25:40] said no the Sheep wouldn't mind me so I
[1:25:43] had to break her leg in order in order
[1:25:46] to hold her pet her love her give her a
[1:25:50] little special food so that she would
[1:25:53] love me and follow me
[1:25:55] and so sometimes God has to do that let
[1:25:58] the doctor say oh it's all over nothing
[1:26:00] could be done and then God takes you up
[1:26:02] in his arms and Pat you a little bit
[1:26:04] says child of mine don't you know I love
[1:26:07] you don't you know I'm the Lord that
[1:26:09] Health all thy disease but Lord I was
[1:26:12] taught that the days of Miracles has
[1:26:14] passed he said I know you was but I just
[1:26:17] had this happen so I could show you a
[1:26:18] little special favor now don't you love
[1:26:21] me just a little more now am I'm going
[1:26:24] to let you get well did you ever have
[1:26:26] that just come to you I have many times
[1:26:29] let something happen just to check me
[1:26:31] down a little to let him Express his
[1:26:35] love don't be mad when a preacher gets
[1:26:38] up here pulls the rug out up from under
[1:26:41] you but let me tell you something we
[1:26:43] know that all things work to the good of
[1:26:47] them that love
[1:26:48] God you see you might be going through
[1:26:51] the hardest trial of your life but I'm
[1:26:53] here to encourage you tonight the
[1:26:55] shepherd isn't left you alone the
[1:26:57] shepherd hasn't left you in a place
[1:26:59] where he can't get to you because all
[1:27:01] things that you're going through are
[1:27:02] working for the good of you if you love
[1:27:06] God I think of the disciples on the
[1:27:10] boat brother brandom tells that story
[1:27:13] the winds were blowing the waves were
[1:27:16] you ever felt that way before the winds
[1:27:18] were blowing the waves were beating in
[1:27:20] the ship and they thought they were
[1:27:21] alone but brother brandham said Jesus
[1:27:23] climbed up on a high mountain he climbed
[1:27:27] up on a high mountain just to look down
[1:27:29] on the sheep and make sure the Sheep
[1:27:31] were okay to make sure his disciples
[1:27:33] were okay and you know and you you feel
[1:27:36] like I know how it feels you feel like
[1:27:37] there's so much pressure on you but
[1:27:39] don't worry he won't let you drown he
[1:27:41] won't let you fall there he will come
[1:27:44] walking on the water see there so many
[1:27:46] times that we'll try to figure out God
[1:27:48] and how God's going to take care of a
[1:27:50] situation and we wonder if he's going to
[1:27:52] if he's going to do this but we don't
[1:27:53] take for a count God can do whatever he
[1:27:55] wants to for a situation God don't need
[1:27:57] our approval or our opinion but he can
[1:27:59] actually come walking on the water to
[1:28:01] meet you in your
[1:28:03] [Applause]
[1:28:04] situation the storm the master was on
[1:28:07] the mountain the whole time watching
[1:28:09] them so many times it feels like our
[1:28:12] life is in turmoil it feels like we
[1:28:14] don't know what to do but I promise you
[1:28:16] this the shepherd said he will not lose
[1:28:18] a
[1:28:19] one and you feel like you're so alone
[1:28:21] and and you go God does anybody care
[1:28:23] about me but let me tell you one thing
[1:28:25] about the shepherd the shepherd is the
[1:28:27] kind of Shepherd that'll leave the 99 to
[1:28:29] find the
[1:28:30] one that's our God you say well God I
[1:28:34] feel so forgotten sometimes but listen

[1:28:37] you might be forgotten by your sister
[1:28:39] you might even be forgotten about your
[1:28:41] mother and your father but you can never
[1:28:42] be forgotten by God because he promised
[1:28:45] in his word he he promised in his word
[1:28:47] and Isaiah he said but Zion said the
[1:28:49] Lord hath forsaken me and my Lord hath
[1:28:51] forgotten me but he said can a woman
[1:28:53] forgive her suckling child now how
[1:28:56] powerful is that a can a woman forget
[1:28:58] her suckling child he said yeah that
[1:29:00] they should have not compassion on the
[1:29:02] son of her womb yay they may forget oh
[1:29:05] how powerful that is because my wife is
[1:29:08] is in that part of life right now where
[1:29:09] she has that little Reagan and she's
[1:29:11] holding little Reagan and she's taking
[1:29:13] care of Reagan all day long everything

[1:29:22] watch everything that you constant just
[1:29:23] taking care taking care taking care and
[1:29:26] God has promised that she has a better
[1:29:28] chance of forgetting that she ever
[1:29:31] existed than God than the mighty
[1:29:33] Shepherd would ever forget about
[1:29:36] you but Z said the Lord has forsaken me
[1:29:40] and my Lord has forgotten me can a woman
[1:29:42] forget her suckling child that she would
[1:29:44] not have compassion on the son of her
[1:29:46] womb yet they may forget yet I will not
[1:29:49] forget thee behold I have Graven thee
[1:29:51] upon the palms of my hands and th walls
[1:29:54] are continually before me I'm here to
[1:29:56] tell you tonight the shepherd has not
[1:29:57] forgot about
[1:29:59] [Applause]
[1:30:01] you he told Jeremiah I think it's is so
[1:30:05] beautiful before Jeremiah knew himself
[1:30:07] God knew
[1:30:08] him before Jeremiah ever came into a
[1:30:11] conscious decision that I'm Jeremiah God
[1:30:15] said when you were in your mother's womb
[1:30:16] Jeremiah I already knew you and I
[1:30:19] already ordained you to be a prophet
[1:30:24] amen he says I know the thoughts that I
[1:30:27] think towards you thoughts of peace and
[1:30:29] not of
[1:30:32] evil you know when you're a sheep and
[1:30:34] you hear the voice yes
[1:30:36] sir there's something in you you can't
[1:30:38] help but respond to that
[1:30:41] voice there's something in you that
[1:30:44] that's the
[1:30:46] master brother Bron says here why it
[1:30:48] must be a Shepherd Why must a Shepherd
[1:30:50] be on duty at all times he must be sure
[1:30:53] that none of his sheep's lost aren't you
[1:30:56] glad of that if the Sheep her loses if
[1:30:58] the shepherd loses one sheep it's a
[1:31:00] reproach on the shepherd He that heareth
[1:31:03] my word and believeth on him that sent
[1:31:05] me hath everlasting life and shall never
[1:31:08] come to judgment but pass from Death To
[1:31:10] Life Shepherds won't lose his sheep you
[1:31:12] know if you're a sheep all the father
[1:31:16] has given me will come to me and all
[1:31:18] that will come to me I will in no wise
[1:31:21] cast out but will give him everlasting
[1:31:22] life and though oh The Undertaker puts
[1:31:25] him in the ground he my sheep will hear
[1:31:27] my voice and raise him up at the last
[1:31:29] day praise be to the Living God see
[1:31:32] there's nothing that can keep you from
[1:31:33] hearing the voice my sheep hear my voice
[1:31:36] Jesus said at that day all that is in
[1:31:39] the grave shall hear the voice of the
[1:31:40] great Shepherd and shall come forth
[1:31:42] Hallelujah come forth the everlasting
[1:31:45] life oh to that great day of the coming
[1:31:47] of the Sheep's Shepherd Sorrows of Tears
[1:31:50] can never keep the shepherd away
[1:31:53] corruption he proved it at the grave of
[1:31:55] Lazarus this is beautiful Lazarus was
[1:31:57] one of those little lambs Lazarus was
[1:31:59] one of his little lambs and he was
[1:32:01] laying in the B he was laying in the
[1:32:03] body the bottom of a pit a stone rolled
[1:32:06] over it his body was molded then nose
[1:32:10] dropped in the skin worms were eating
[1:32:12] him up but the chief Shepherd come up to
[1:32:14] the grave and he knows his Sheep by name
[1:32:19] and if he speaks your name now and calls
[1:32:22] you answer for there's going to be a
[1:32:24] time said the prophet that he will call
[1:32:27] and I will answer him Lazarus was 4 days
[1:32:31] dead his body was corrupted but the
[1:32:34] shepherd spake in corrup corruption knew
[1:32:37] its master and the soul that was dead
[1:32:39] four days
[1:32:42] journey turned back into that body in
[1:32:45] the body that had been in baled no blood
[1:32:48] the cells was broke he was rotten in the
[1:32:50] grave but the Shepherd Of Life spoke the
[1:32:54] name of his lamb and his lamb let out a
[1:32:58] bleach and said here I
[1:33:02] come when the shepherd begins to talk it
[1:33:05] don't matter what's there there is
[1:33:07] nothing that will keep the shepherd's
[1:33:09] voice from getting to you and when
[1:33:11] you're a sheep there's nothing that'll
[1:33:13] keep you from
[1:33:15] [Applause]
[1:33:17] responding when the shepherd begins to
[1:33:19] call that's right yes sir when the
[1:33:22] shepherd calls let let me tell you
[1:33:24] something when the shepherd calls he
[1:33:26] isn't going to be saying something
[1:33:28] negative that's right so when you hear a
[1:33:30] voice if it's negative it's not the
[1:33:33] shepherd but you know when you go to
[1:33:35] church you'll hear the shepherd and the
[1:33:37] shepherd will begin to speak and it'll
[1:33:39] begin to call things out and it begin to
[1:33:41] say give that to me give that to me that
[1:33:44] don't belong to you that's not what
[1:33:47] remember what a good shepherd will do
[1:33:48] he'll keep the evil spirits out of the
[1:33:51] church and when there's something in
[1:33:53] your life and the and the shepherd
[1:33:54] begins to call to you a deep call to the
[1:33:57] deep and there's a deep to respond that
[1:33:59] says not my will but thy will oh Lord
[1:34:02] he'll come to you in a service and he'll
[1:34:04] begin to call out that depression he'll
[1:34:06] begin to say that's not who you are
[1:34:08] that's not what you belong to you are
[1:34:10] not depression you are my
[1:34:13] sheep you are not sickness you are my
[1:34:16] [Applause]
[1:34:19] sheep I've never seen it so much in my
[1:34:22] life where young people are battling
[1:34:23] suicidal thoughts and suicidal spirits
[1:34:26] that is not the shepherd's voice talking
[1:34:28] to you you are not supposed to follow
[1:34:31] the voice of depression or the voice of
[1:34:33] anxiety or the voice of fear we are to
[1:34:35] follow the voice of the
[1:34:37] [Applause]
[1:34:42] [Music]
[1:34:47] shepherd you said brother Seth I feel
[1:34:49] unreachable I'm closing here s
[1:34:53] the great
[1:34:55] Shepherd leaves the
[1:34:57] 99 to find the
[1:35:00] one he'll put a service together like
[1:35:04] this for one
[1:35:05] [Applause]
[1:35:13] person he came to be a shepherd and he
[1:35:17] was a
[1:35:18] Shepherd a Shepherd is one who goes
[1:35:20] after his sheep a famous picture I don't
[1:35:23] think we have it on our walls here but
[1:35:25] I've set it in room and and lo and
[1:35:27] looked at it I just can't call the
[1:35:30] artist's name but when he lost that
[1:35:32] little black sheep and he leaves the 90
[1:35:34] and
[1:35:37] n and goes to look for
[1:35:39] it how many's thankful for
[1:35:44] that Satan told you you were
[1:35:47] insufficient not good enough but listen
[1:35:50] he'll go after you
[1:35:54] what does he do he Strays through the
[1:35:56] Wilderness he cuts himself with Briars
[1:35:58] he pulls through the dangers prows all
[1:36:00] through the night until he finally finds
[1:36:02] way down on the side of the mountain
[1:36:04] hanging by a little Bush risking his own
[1:36:06] life he reaches and takes the little
[1:36:08] fellow out that's falling condition then
[1:36:10] brings it back to himself and another
[1:36:12] artist painted a picture of him bringing
[1:36:14] it home now it looks like the shepherd
[1:36:17] would just stick him under an arm and
[1:36:19] and keep the sheet and start bringing it
[1:36:20] in like that but you notice the the
[1:36:22] spirit caught the AR his brush and he
[1:36:24] didn't put it under his arm but he put
[1:36:26] it on his
[1:36:30] shoulders now I want you to see the care
[1:36:32] of the shepherd now Jesus when he was
[1:36:34] casting out Devils he done it with a
[1:36:36] finger now if a devil's bothering you
[1:36:39] the only thing he takes of God is just
[1:36:40] an insignificant till he takes his
[1:36:42] finger and casts it away but when a
[1:36:44] sheep comes home where's the strongest
[1:36:47] part of a man across the shoulders you
[1:36:49] notice how a man always his shoulders is
[1:36:52] the biggest when he can pack the Great
[1:36:53] greatest load across his shoulders where
[1:36:55] is the most shest of when the load's
[1:36:58] across his shoulders so he takes the
[1:37:00] Sheep lays around his shoulders and
[1:37:02] gently walks it back all the powers of
[1:37:05] God wrapped up in the little lost fellow
[1:37:07] bringing him back but a devil so easy he
[1:37:09] just cast it away with his finger but
[1:37:11] he's a Shepherd Hallelujah I'm so glad
[1:37:14] that he's on duty day and night he'll
[1:37:17] said I'll never leave thee nor forsake
[1:37:19] Thee I will be with thee always even to
[1:37:22] the end of the world
[1:37:24] church I'm here to tell you tonight he
[1:37:26] ain't going to leave you wherever you
[1:37:28] find you wherever you're at he'll get to

[1:38:02] known me for years we've been buddies
[1:38:04] for years and and he asked me he said he
[1:38:08] said brother he said how do you deal
[1:38:10] with anxiety and disappointments and
[1:38:12] when you don't feel the presence of the
[1:38:14] Lord and man it just kind of caught me
[1:38:17] out of nowhere and I said let me you
[1:38:18] know Lord let me answer this the right
[1:38:21] way and I began walk around and I walked
[1:38:26] and I thought about it and I said now
[1:38:27] ask me that again he said well you know
[1:38:30] how do you he said you know I recently I
[1:38:33] was searching the Lord so hard and and
[1:38:35] he said I began to have an anxiety
[1:38:37] attack he said do you go through
[1:38:38] disappointments and
[1:38:40] absolutely buddy I go through
[1:38:42] disappointments I go through low valleys
[1:38:44] I I go through times where where I can't
[1:38:46] seem to find God can we be honest this
[1:38:48] evening I go through times where where
[1:38:50] I'll be walking and and and if we're all
[1:38:53] being honest there's times where we go
[1:38:55] Where's God at and and and and you know
[1:38:57] it seems like the weight of the world is
[1:38:59] coming down on
[1:39:00] us but you know there's one thing that
[1:39:03] came to
[1:39:05] me his name's Ben I said Ben let me tell
[1:39:08] you something you know he's he's taken
[1:39:10] this time and and he's gave up
[1:39:13] everything to try to know
[1:39:15] Jesus and he's he he's given up
[1:39:18] everything to try to get closer to God
[1:39:20] and closer to God and closer to God and
[1:39:22] closer to God
[1:39:23] and I finally told him I said
[1:39:26] Ben things are going to get a lot easier
[1:39:29] for you when you realize it was God
[1:39:31] calling you and not you searching for
[1:39:37] God I said he says all that the father
[1:39:39] has given me will come to me and all
[1:39:43] that comes to me I will in no wise cast
[1:39:45] out I said you see Ben the whole time
[1:39:48] you thought you were searching for God
[1:39:50] when the whole time God was searching
[1:39:52] for you
[1:39:54] Church we're not relying on our own
[1:39:56] ability and what we can
[1:40:00] do but being confidence is the very
[1:40:02] thing he that which ha begun a good work
[1:40:04] in you will perform it till the day of
[1:40:07] Jesus
[1:40:08] Christ yeah there's days when we have
[1:40:10] bad days yeah there's days when we fail

[1:40:26] yourself brother bham says after through
[1:40:29] the services this week trying to show
[1:40:31] the people that there's no need of being
[1:40:33] scared that's right the worst thing the
[1:40:35] devil can put upon you is fear that's
[1:40:37] right if you even had a Cancer and
[1:40:39] didn't fear and believe God would heal
[1:40:41] you you couldn't be in too bad a shape
[1:40:44] God take care of that if you were sick
[1:40:46] whatever it is if you didn't fear so
[1:40:50] fear is one of the worst things that
[1:40:51] Satan can place upon a person
[1:40:54] now this week I've tried to prove by the
[1:40:56] scripture that the man that's born of
[1:40:58] the kingdom of God has nothing to fear
[1:41:01] you're absolutely safely secure in
[1:41:04] Christ all the father has given me he
[1:41:07] said will come to me and no man can come
