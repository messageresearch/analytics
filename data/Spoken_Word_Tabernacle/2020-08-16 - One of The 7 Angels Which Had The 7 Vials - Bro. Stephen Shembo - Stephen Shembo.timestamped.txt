[7:49] we asked lord jesus that you would
[7:51] continue to anoint the singing this
[7:52] morning lord the musicians
[7:54] but most of all lord jesus that you
[7:56] would anoint your word
[7:58] that you would anoint brother stephen as

[8:23] ask lord god that they just bow their
[8:27] heads lord and
[8:28] let everything any distraction at home
[8:30] may go away lord god that they can
[8:32] receive
[8:33] what you have for us this morning lord
[8:35] this portion is important as any other
[8:37] lord god and we
[8:39] want to grasp ahold of any and every bit
[8:42] of it lord
[8:43] have your perfect will in our lives lord
[8:45] jesus and we ask these things in your
[8:47] precious name oh god
[8:49] amen and amen hallelujah let's give him
[8:52] a clap offering this morning
[8:55] hallelujah
[8:58] praise the lord it is good to see
[9:02] everyone i'm sure there'll be more
[9:03] coming in

[9:06] thing before we get started

[9:12] anybody
[9:13] is having any trouble
[9:16] getting what's being put up here and
[9:19] over here
[9:20] brother stephen has encouraged us to
[9:23] come to him
[9:24] if we need to now i'm sure most of us
[9:27] are getting it
[9:28] it's very good it's very good stuff and
[9:31] it's only for us but i mean it's us
[9:33] you know it's only for those that god

[47:04] mom and dad with us here
[47:06] you're more than welcome
[47:10] and we had brother paul i see brother
[47:13] joseph there there's so many of you god
[47:15] richly bless you
[47:19] amen and amen if you would let's go back
[47:23] to the scripture
[47:29] we spoke couple weeks ago on who is
[47:32] the robobale i believe all of you
[47:36] know who zarova river belize last week
[47:39] we got into the trumpet
[47:41] and everybody in this church should know
[47:43] what a trumpet means
[47:45] sister should be able to exhort
[47:49] and brothers should be able to preach it
[47:53] so we know what a trumpet is
[47:56] we know the difference between the last
[47:58] trump which is the message of this hour
[48:02] and the seventh trumpet which goes to
[48:05] the jews
[48:07] in this church we believe a hundred
[48:10] percent
[48:11] on the message of the hour so
[48:15] if you don't have if you have a problem
[48:16] with the message
[48:18] you better answer scrub
[48:21] respect what we believe and leave us
[48:24] alone
[48:27] but we stand for the message of the hour
[48:30] in this pulpit it's only the bible says
[48:33] and brother branham say
[48:35] know what td jakes or the baptist or
[48:38] whatever say
[48:40] no it's the message of devourer
[48:42] interpreting the scripture
[48:46] praise the lord amen
[48:49] isaiah 29 now
[48:54] if you dare you can say amen
[48:57] the bible say and the vision of all
[49:01] in other words the entire book of isaiah
[49:05] the entire vision remember as we went
[49:08] through the series
[49:10] of the unchanging pattern of god we
[49:13] showed you by the prophet
[49:14] that isaiah wrote to the entire bible
[49:18] how many believe remember that isaiah
[49:21] had
[49:21] 66 books and what branham said all those
[49:25] 66 chapters represented the book of
[49:29] the bible in other words isaiah wrote
[49:32] the entire
[49:33] bible now isaiah is saying here that the
[49:36] entire vision
[49:38] or everything that he spoke in other
[49:41] words the entire
[49:43] bible everybody clear now
[49:46] you might be saying the entire
[49:50] bible the entire vision is become to you
[49:54] as the words of a book that is
[49:58] sealed everybody clear
[50:01] so the entire bible now is sealed
[50:06] everybody clear which
[50:09] men deliver to one that is learned in
[50:12] other words
[50:13] somebody who is educated
[50:17] saying read this i pray you
[50:21] and he say i cannot for it is
[50:25] sealed in other words when
[50:28] a book is sealed
[50:31] with a sale that seal
[50:36] is a lock to the
[50:39] educator
[50:43] are you there if you give a person or
[50:47] somebody who went to school
[50:49] this bible they can read it they don't
[50:53] have a problem
[50:54] with the riding because they went to
[50:56] school they're educated
[50:58] but if you fill the book then regardless
[51:02] of
[51:03] the education there is no way
[51:06] they can decode the scripture
[51:09] and isaiah is saying that the entire
[51:11] bible the entire book
[51:13] has been sealed and that still
[51:16] is to block the wise
[51:20] and the prudent but to reveal
[51:23] that only to the babes and brother
[51:27] branham said those
[51:28] bread are the predestinated seed of god
[51:33] hallelujah verse 12
[51:36] and the book is delivered to him that is
[51:40] not
[51:40] learned so the problem is not only
[51:44] for the one that is educated even the
[51:46] illiterate
[51:48] but the illiterate is double-blind
[51:52] he cannot read and they still lock him
[51:55] up as well
[51:57] are you there he said and the book is
[52:00] delivered to him that is not learned
[52:03] saying read this i pray you and he say
[52:06] i am not learned so the one who's
[52:10] illiterate doesn't even worry about the
[52:13] seal
[52:14] because to begin with he cannot even
[52:16] read
[52:17] but the one that is educated that is
[52:20] able to read the scripture
[52:22] is locked by the seal it is
[52:25] only to a specific class of a people
[52:29] to understand prophecy everybody clear
[52:33] let's go to daniel chapter 2.
[52:39] so this book is a problem to those that
[52:42] are educated
[52:43] and those that are illiterate
[52:48] in other words whether you go to school
[52:50] or not
[52:52] you need to connect to the god
[52:55] that wrote the bible are you there
[52:58] you cannot say that i was uneducated
[53:02] you're still in trouble
[53:07] daniel chapter two verse one
[53:10] and in the second year of the reign of
[53:13] nebuchadnezzar
[53:16] naboo can nebuchadnezzar dream
[53:19] dreams where with his spirit was
[53:21] troubled
[53:22] and his sleep broke from him then the
[53:26] king commanded to call
[53:27] magician very educated on that time
[53:32] and astrologer phd's
[53:35] and the sorcerer and the calvins
[53:40] for to show the king his dreams so they
[53:43] come
[53:44] and stood before the king and the king
[53:46] said to them
[53:48] i have a dream a dream and my spirit was
[53:52] troubled to know the dream
[53:54] then spoke the carvings to the king in
[53:56] sarriac
[53:58] o king live forever tell your servant
[54:02] the dream
[54:03] and we will show their interpretation
[54:06] if you notice as long as the king have
[54:10] not spoken the dream the magicians are
[54:13] locked
[54:15] are you there so they're telling the
[54:18] king
[54:19] give us the dream give us
[54:22] the spoken word give us the scripture
[54:27] because once they have the scripture
[54:30] anybody can give you an interpretation
[54:34] we have the bible and we have none more
[54:37] than 900 denominations
[54:40] because we all have the scripture are
[54:42] you there
[54:43] as long as we have the scripture you can
[54:46] make this bible
[54:47] everything you want to brother branham
[54:49] said that even the unbeliever
[54:52] the hidden use the bible for debate
[54:55] because they have the scripture but if
[54:58] it's still
[55:00] then it's a different thing praise the
[55:03] lord
[55:05] verse five the king answered and said to
[55:08] the caudans
[55:09] the thing is gone from me
[55:14] praise the lord if you will not make
[55:18] known to me the dream that's not a
[55:21] problem
[55:22] with the interpretation thereof you
[55:25] shall be cut in pieces
[55:27] and your houses shall be made there dug
[55:30] here
[55:31] they were waiting they got used to it
[55:33] you give us a dream
[55:35] because you're a king we're going to
[55:36] tell you things that are going to please
[55:38] you
[55:39] and that's how we go whether it happened
[55:41] or not no problem
[55:42] and the king said this time is different
[55:46] for me to know that you really have the
[55:49] gift
[55:50] of interpretation of dream you must
[55:53] first tell me the dream
[55:56] in other words the king sealed the
[56:00] vision
[56:02] hallelujah verse 6 but if you share the
[56:06] dream
[56:07] and the interpretation thereof you shall
[56:10] receive of me gifts
[56:12] and rewards and great honor therefore
[56:15] show me the dream and the interpretation
[56:18] thereof
[56:19] verse seven they answer again and say
[56:23] let the king tell his servant the dream
[56:26] they are locked
[56:27] educated are you there and we will show
[56:31] the interpretation of it
[56:33] the king answered and say i know of
[56:36] certainty
[56:37] that you will gain the time in other
[56:39] words you need to hurry
[56:41] because you see the things is gone from
[56:43] me
[56:44] but if you will not make known to me the
[56:46] dream
[56:47] there is but one decree for you decree
[56:50] for you
[56:51] for you have prepared what lying the
[56:54] king understood
[56:56] you see now you have prepared lying and
[56:59] corrupt word
[57:01] to speak before me till the time be
[57:04] changed
[57:04] therefore tell me the dream and i shall
[57:07] know that you can show me the
[57:09] interpretation
[57:10] thereof in other words i always study
[57:13] you i know you
[57:14] all you want is for me to give you the
[57:16] clue then you can run with loose end
[57:20] all kind of way but for this time i
[57:23] steal the vision
[57:25] you need to be able to go beyond the
[57:28] seal
[57:29] to interpret the vision everybody clear
[57:33] praise the lord verse 10 they calvin
[57:36] answer before the king and say
[57:38] there is not a man
[57:42] yes there is upon the earth
[57:45] that can show the king's mother
[57:48] therefore there is no
[57:49] king lord no ruler
[57:53] that asks such things at any magician
[57:57] i thought they have power an astrologer
[58:00] i thought they can read the zodiac
[58:03] or cardinals they are educated
[58:07] and it is a rare difficult thing
[58:10] that the king require and there is no
[58:13] other that can show it before the king
[58:16] except the gods
[58:20] only gods
[58:23] not big only small gods
[58:27] and jesus said did not your law
[58:30] say that you are gods
[58:35] you must be a god to go
[58:38] into somebody's mind and to decode the
[58:42] seal
[58:46] hallelujah only god
[58:49] whose dwelling is not with flesh
[58:54] praise the lord let's jump to verse 27
[58:59] daniel answer in the presence of the
[59:01] king a prophet and say
[59:04] the secret you see it's a secret now
[59:08] which the king has demanded cannot the
[59:12] wise man
[59:13] the astrologer the magician
[59:16] the shuffle show to the king in other
[59:19] words
[59:19] this is a different level it is a
[59:23] different
[59:23] category it is not to the educated
[59:27] there is nobody that can tap into this
[59:30] level
[59:32] verse 28 but there is a god
[59:36] in heaven that revealed secret
[59:40] [Applause]
[59:42] and makes known that to the king
[59:44] nebuchadnezzar
[59:45] what shall be in the latter days your
[59:48] dream
[59:49] and the vision of your head upon your
[59:52] bed

[59:57] for as much as you saw
[1:00:01] in other words i'm skipping this daniel
[1:00:04] was able to
[1:00:05] unlock the vision he took a prophet
[1:00:09] to decode the seal
[1:00:13] when they still see the face of a
[1:00:15] prophet
[1:00:16] he automatically pop up
[1:00:22] are you there the key to the seal
[1:00:25] is in the prophet
[1:00:31] praise the lord so daniel decode the
[1:00:35] vision

[1:00:47] and that he broke in pieces
[1:00:50] in in pieces the iron the brass the clay
[1:00:53] the silver and the gold we spoke about
[1:00:54] this last week
[1:00:56] the great god has made known to the king
[1:00:58] what shall come
[1:00:59] to pass hereafter and the dream is
[1:01:02] certain
[1:01:03] and the interpretation thereof sure

[1:01:38] that nobody else can decode
[1:01:41] except god nebuchadnezzar
[1:01:46] fell down before daniel
[1:01:53] then the king nebuchadnezzar fell upon
[1:01:56] his face

[1:03:40] and who nebuchadnezzar
[1:03:44] the king of babylon my
[1:03:48] let's go back to daniel
[1:03:52] so the man who was worshiping daniel
[1:03:55] was a servant of god
[1:04:03] a god then the king nebuchadnezzar fell
[1:04:08] upon his face when he sees the level
[1:04:12] of revelation that daniel unfold
[1:04:18] the king fell down and worshiped
[1:04:21] daniel we're not going to worship a
[1:04:24] prophet
[1:04:25] relax
[1:04:29] relax
[1:04:35] i know somebody's like
[1:04:39] maybe online especially online
[1:04:42] because there's a scrub and they are
[1:04:45] putting thumbs down
[1:04:46] he's like go ahead go ahead we got him
[1:04:49] now
[1:04:50] you want to get your answer today
[1:04:58] then the king nebuchadnezzar fell upon
[1:05:00] his face
[1:05:02] and worshiped daniel and commanded that
[1:05:05] they should offer
[1:05:06] an oblation and sweet order to him
[1:05:12] a servant of god the king answered to
[1:05:15] daniel and say
[1:05:16] of the truth it is that your god is a
[1:05:19] god of gods
[1:05:20] and a lord of kings a revealer of secret
[1:05:24] saying you could reveal this
[1:05:28] sacred secret nebuchadnezzar
[1:05:31] a hidden number one
[1:05:35] number two uh servant of god
[1:05:40] he only happened to heed and brother
[1:05:42] stephen not jews
[1:05:44] let's go to revelation 22.
[1:05:47] that's why i like brother kalima
[1:06:00] a revelation written by john a
[1:06:04] jew
[1:06:08] a servant of god
[1:06:13] an apostle
[1:06:17] a prophet
[1:06:21] a christian
[1:06:27] revelation 22 verse 6.
[1:06:32] and he said to me these sayings are
[1:06:35] faithful and true
[1:06:37] and the lord god of the holy prophet
[1:06:39] sent his angel
[1:06:42] there was an angel sent
[1:06:46] to show to his servant
[1:06:49] are you there so in the book of
[1:06:52] revelation
[1:06:53] god sent an angel and that angel
[1:06:56] was the one showing john everything
[1:07:02] and when the danger keeps showing
[1:07:04] showing
[1:07:05] showing and the level of decoding was so
[1:07:12] high
[1:07:14] show his servant the things which must
[1:07:16] shortly be done
[1:07:18] verse 7 behold i come quickly
[1:07:21] who is speaking there
[1:07:24] who is talking to john this word
[1:07:30] let me go back again who is talking to
[1:07:33] john the angel by who is speaking here
[1:07:38] using the voice of that angel
[1:07:42] [Music]
[1:07:45] so this angel sometimes when he speaks
[1:07:48] [Applause]
[1:07:50] he have to go back and listen to his
[1:07:53] own tape
[1:07:58] because he was not him that was speaking
[1:08:09] behold i come quickly blessed is he that
[1:08:13] keeps the saying of the prophecy of this
[1:08:15] book
[1:08:18] i john the servant of god
[1:08:23] the apostle who leaned in the bosom of
[1:08:25] jesus
[1:08:27] saw these things and heard them and when
[1:08:31] i heard
[1:08:32] and sin i fell down to
[1:08:36] worship
[1:08:43] worship before the feet of the
[1:08:46] angel which show me this
[1:08:49] the level of revelation is so high
[1:08:54] until john fell down to
[1:08:57] worship
[1:09:02] verse 9 then say he to me the angel
[1:09:06] see you doing not for i am your fellow
[1:09:10] servant and of your brethren d
[1:09:14] so this angel is a prophet
[1:09:19] and dania was a prophet
[1:09:26] and of them which keep the saying of the
[1:09:29] books
[1:09:30] so he also have to keep the word of god
[1:09:33] worship who
[1:09:34] [Music]
[1:09:36] and he says to me still not the saying
[1:09:39] of this prophecy of this book

[1:09:46] heavenly father lord we thank you for
[1:09:48] your grace your love your mercy
[1:09:50] and for everything you're doing for us
[1:09:52] father we are getting into
[1:09:54] a part that seems to be very difficult
[1:09:58] challenging being attacked lord
[1:10:02] attacking the entire message buy it lord
[1:10:06] but father it is not great it is not
[1:10:09] difficult
[1:10:10] for you because you are the holy spirit
[1:10:13] who wrote the bible and you know why you
[1:10:16] permitted everything
[1:10:18] your prophet told us that if this book
[1:10:20] was a hebrew
[1:10:22] jewish book they would have hide these
[1:10:23] things but it was not a hebrew book
[1:10:26] it is the book of god that's why you put
[1:10:29] in everything
[1:10:30] knowing that one of this day you're
[1:10:32] going to unveil this mystery
[1:10:34] through your seven angel lord father we
[1:10:36] commit ourself
[1:10:37] unto the handmaid the holy spirit may
[1:10:39] the inside teacher
[1:10:41] come down lord father and teach us your
[1:10:43] word to your children
[1:10:44] be the alpha and the omega father in the
[1:10:47] name of jesus christ
[1:10:49] amen god bless you we spoke about
[1:10:52] zerubbabel we spoke about the seven
[1:10:55] angel
[1:10:56] this morning we're gonna spoke about one
[1:10:58] of the seven angels
[1:11:00] which had the seven vows
[1:11:04] in the scripture there are seven angels
[1:11:07] like we saw last week
[1:11:08] there were seven angels with seven
[1:11:10] trumpet
[1:11:12] there were seven engines with seven
[1:11:14] trumpets that belonged to the deuce
[1:11:16] and there were also seven angel with
[1:11:18] seven trumpets that belonged to the
[1:11:20] gentile we saw that last week but in the
[1:11:23] scripture
[1:11:24] we have also seven angels which carry
[1:11:27] seven vows and one of them is a
[1:11:30] particular angel
[1:11:33] and it's an angel that was actually
[1:11:36] revealing the book of revelation
[1:11:39] to john that angel
[1:11:43] that john fell down to worship was the
[1:11:46] angel
[1:11:47] that was carrying the seventh vow but
[1:11:50] the bible referred to him as
[1:11:52] one of them in other words not every
[1:11:55] angel
[1:11:56] but there is one among the seven
[1:11:59] that have a particular ministry to
[1:12:02] unfold
[1:12:04] the book of revelation unto john
[1:12:07] are you there now we found out here
[1:12:11] i put him like the last one but we're
[1:12:13] gonna see who he is
[1:12:16] we have a word there called the vow
[1:12:19] what is in the message why
[1:12:24] are we not a denomination brother
[1:12:25] branham says
[1:12:27] how many knows that wisdom is one of the
[1:12:29] gift of the spirit
[1:12:32] now what kind of a group is he talking
[1:12:34] to them
[1:12:36] he must be talking to a group of people
[1:12:38] that have the gifts plural
[1:12:41] of spirit operating in this church
[1:12:44] we preach about them here is the mind
[1:12:47] that has wisdom
[1:12:49] but continue he said now you stop
[1:12:52] find that all through these church ages
[1:12:55] here
[1:12:56] pulling out the holy spirit speaking out
[1:12:59] how those gifts to be working in the
[1:13:02] last day
[1:13:04] now we got gifts of healing working it's
[1:13:07] going good
[1:13:08] well brother there is that a gift that
[1:13:10] is just one of them
[1:13:12] that is just a little minor thing that's
[1:13:15] healing
[1:13:16] well here is a far greater gift right
[1:13:20] here
[1:13:21] which will be the best the gift of the
[1:13:25] holy ghost of
[1:13:27] wisdom to put the word
[1:13:30] of god together and to show the church
[1:13:34] where
[1:13:35] we are standing then
[1:13:38] just get somebody's heal in other words
[1:13:41] brother branham is saying that the gift
[1:13:43] of healing
[1:13:44] that can put the word together and
[1:13:47] position
[1:13:48] a believer is more important
[1:13:51] than the gift of healing of your body
[1:13:56] what upon him say we all want to be well
[1:14:00] but i rather have my soul well
[1:14:03] then my body where any time
[1:14:06] you better be here first in your soul
[1:14:10] but that healing comes by the word of
[1:14:12] god
[1:14:14] not the written word but the reveal word
[1:14:17] of the hour
[1:14:18] because god said i send my word and my
[1:14:21] word
[1:14:22] healed them everybody there
[1:14:25] now last week we found out that there
[1:14:27] was a pattern
[1:14:29] brother bonham called that pattern a
[1:14:31] plan
[1:14:32] and we found that when a seal broke in
[1:14:35] heaven
[1:14:36] a thunder was revealed you should be
[1:14:38] familiar with this
[1:14:40] in that thunder there was a message
[1:14:43] and when a messenger will pop up a man
[1:14:46] of the hour
[1:14:47] having a ram's horn we spoke about the
[1:14:50] last week
[1:14:51] he was the message of the hour but in
[1:14:54] our part we already know our messenger
[1:14:56] is brother branham so he will blow the
[1:15:00] trumpet
[1:15:01] not our trumpet but the rams run
[1:15:04] trumpet because the rams run spoke about
[1:15:07] the death of a
[1:15:09] are you there and that trumpet was
[1:15:12] called a
[1:15:13] gospel trumpet we saw it last week
[1:15:17] i'm just building then we're gonna fly
[1:15:19] are you there
[1:15:20] when he blows the trumpet the sound of
[1:15:24] the trumpet was called
[1:15:26] trump a trumpet was an instrument
[1:15:30] but the sound of the trumpet was called
[1:15:32] trump
[1:15:33] and that trump is create war
[1:15:38] and in that trap was the message
[1:15:41] of the hour everybody clear
[1:15:44] in the message of the hour there is
[1:15:48] all the equipment the believer of the
[1:15:51] age
[1:15:52] need to withstand the evil of his day
[1:15:57] are you there that message provide
[1:16:00] your helmet of salvation are you there
[1:16:04] because paul said that i am not a shame
[1:16:07] of
[1:16:07] them because it's the power of god
[1:16:10] aren't you so salvation comes from the
[1:16:14] gospel
[1:16:15] which is the message of the hour are you
[1:16:18] there
[1:16:18] that message provides the breast spirit
[1:16:21] of righteousness
[1:16:23] and paul said in that gospel was
[1:16:26] revealed the righteousness of god
[1:16:28] so righteousness comes from the message
[1:16:31] that message also gives you the belt
[1:16:35] and the belt is the truth per se
[1:16:39] and jesus sacrificed to say my words are
[1:16:42] truth so the gospel the belt
[1:16:46] bring you also the gospel are you there
[1:16:49] and that same message gives you the
[1:16:52] shield of
[1:16:53] faith faith cometh by
[1:16:56] hearing what it comes from the message
[1:17:00] the word the gospel are you there
[1:17:02] and that same message also gives you the
[1:17:06] shoe the shoe which is the gospel of
[1:17:09] peace again the message and that same
[1:17:12] message gives you the
[1:17:14] sword which is the word of god
[1:17:18] so the message is enough to equip you
[1:17:21] to withstand the endeavor of your time
[1:17:26] hallelujah
[1:17:29] so when you receive the message
[1:17:32] heaven have to back you up are you there
[1:17:36] because the message is the word and we
[1:17:39] found out that
[1:17:40] we were temple of god jesus was the
[1:17:43] temple of god
[1:17:45] but paul also told us that you are
[1:17:47] temple of god
[1:17:49] but if you notice in the old testament
[1:17:51] when they were putting stuff
[1:17:53] into the temple nothing happened when
[1:17:56] they put the
[1:17:58] the candlestick nothing happened when
[1:18:00] they put
[1:18:01] the light nothing happened when they put
[1:18:03] the anchor
[1:18:04] nothing happened but when the world the
[1:18:07] ark
[1:18:08] was received into the temple then the
[1:18:11] pillar of fire came down
[1:18:14] so if you need god in your life you must
[1:18:17] first receive the message
[1:18:19] then heaven will back you up
[1:18:22] hallelujah hallelujah so god
[1:18:26] will send an anointing to back you up
[1:18:29] and the children of the devil will be
[1:18:32] also
[1:18:32] anointed by another anointing come from
[1:18:35] hell
[1:18:36] because when heaven open up hell also
[1:18:40] turn loose so the batter is not
[1:18:43] karma the battle
[1:18:46] is not fleshly the true battle
[1:18:50] is between seed it is the wheat
[1:18:54] against the terror but once
[1:18:57] god finish his work he will pull
[1:19:00] completely direct out with the messenger
[1:19:04] and he will drop the vow which was the
[1:19:07] judgment upon those that rejected the
[1:19:10] message you remember that
[1:19:12] now brother branham says this
[1:19:15] notice what happened here is the plan of
[1:19:18] it i'm repeating this
[1:19:20] the first thing happened is an
[1:19:22] announcement in heavens first
[1:19:24] what happened a seal open what is that
[1:19:28] a mystery unfold see
[1:19:31] and when a mystery unfold then a trumpet
[1:19:35] sounds gospel trumpet he declare
[1:19:38] war a plague fall
[1:19:42] are you there and a church edge open
[1:19:46] what is the war part the angel of the
[1:19:48] church catches the mystery of god
[1:19:51] not fully yet revealed but when he dies
[1:19:54] he catches this mystery of god and then
[1:19:57] he goes forth to the people
[1:19:59] after the mystery has been given to him
[1:20:01] goes forth to the
[1:20:02] people what does he do out there
[1:20:06] he begin to proclaim that message
[1:20:09] and what does it start a world
[1:20:12] a spiritual world so every time
[1:20:16] the true message of god is preached
[1:20:19] it's gonna create woe and we are ready
[1:20:22] for war
[1:20:25] and then god take his messenger
[1:20:28] with the lack of that edge and lays them
[1:20:31] away
[1:20:32] asleep and then he dropped oh plug
[1:20:35] but branham didn't say val he said
[1:20:39] prague
[1:20:40] i say vow i am not more than brother
[1:20:43] branham
[1:20:44] i must be behind brother branham are you
[1:20:47] there
[1:20:48] and then he dropped a plug upon them who
[1:20:51] rejected
[1:20:52] a plug means what a temporary
[1:20:55] judgment everybody clear
[1:20:58] let's continue and he sent forth the
[1:21:02] the first messenger and he preached and
[1:21:05] a trumpet sounded as we picked it up
[1:21:07] after a while
[1:21:08] and the trumpet was declaring war
[1:21:11] trumpet always denotes worry the
[1:21:14] messenger the engine come on earth
[1:21:16] the messenger of the hour like looters
[1:21:19] like
[1:21:19] any of the messenger that we have talked
[1:21:22] of
[1:21:23] what does he do he arrives and is still
[1:21:26] open
[1:21:27] reveal a trumpet sound war declare
[1:21:30] and awake they go and then the messenger
[1:21:33] dies
[1:21:34] he seals away this group they are put in
[1:21:37] and a plug fall upon those who rejected
[1:21:42] them
[1:21:43] so here brother branham is speaking
[1:21:45] about a plague
[1:21:47] but we have spoken of her val
[1:21:51] what is going on and now as we study
[1:21:54] this
[1:21:55] we are comparing it now the first three
[1:21:58] books of the bible
[1:21:59] of revelation which we have pretty
[1:22:02] somebody want to see
[1:22:04] right i caught you thank you
[1:22:09] it just came by like a wave thank you
[1:22:12] the church
[1:22:12] now there is seven church ages seven
[1:22:15] seals
[1:22:16] seven trumpet and vows
[1:22:20] and unclean spirit like frogs and
[1:22:23] all these guys together
[1:22:26] are we following praise the lord
[1:22:29] there is seven verse you know there is
[1:22:32] sevens
[1:22:33] as we are going through they all happen
[1:22:36] right there the same
[1:22:38] time everybody clear following the
[1:22:42] plugs following the churches
[1:22:45] that's the same because it is all set up
[1:22:48] into one book everything and everything
[1:22:51] happened just in
[1:22:52] rotation everybody clear
[1:22:56] one goes right into the other and
[1:22:59] the other and the other there is two
[1:23:02] spirit working god and the
[1:23:04] devil brother branham
[1:23:08] this is necessary in order to study and
[1:23:11] understand the rest of revelation
[1:23:13] for out of the church ages the edges
[1:23:16] comes the
[1:23:18] seal and out of the seals come though
[1:23:21] gospel trumpet and out of the trumpet
[1:23:24] comes though
[1:23:25] here he doesn't say plug
[1:23:30] take revelation 15.
[1:23:40] if you dare you can say man
[1:23:43] we're gonna navigate in revelation today
[1:23:46] back and forth so we need your bible
[1:23:49] revelation 15 verse 1 and i saw
[1:23:53] everybody there and i saw another son in
[1:23:56] heaven great and marvelous
[1:23:58] seven angels everybody clear having
[1:24:02] seven what
[1:24:04] last place everybody clear
[1:24:07] for in them is philip though
[1:24:11] so right here in revelation 15
[1:24:14] the bible said that when you look at the
[1:24:17] plague
[1:24:18] the plague is something that is filled
[1:24:20] with the
[1:24:21] wrath of god
[1:24:25] everybody clear john two verse five
[1:24:29] it's speaking about a plague not a vow
[1:24:34] verse five and after that i look
[1:24:37] and behold the temple of the tabernacle
[1:24:40] of testimony in heaven was opened
[1:24:42] and the seven angel came out of the
[1:24:45] temple the same angels
[1:24:47] everybody clear heaven seven what
[1:24:52] plagues you already seen that clothes in
[1:24:55] pure
[1:24:56] and white lemon so this angel
[1:25:00] number one they have plagues
[1:25:03] number two they are cloves
[1:25:06] and their clothing is in what
[1:25:10] white and
[1:25:13] pure what lenin
[1:25:17] we are trying to decode that angel right
[1:25:22] and having their breasts girded with
[1:25:25] what
[1:25:27] number three this angel
[1:25:30] has a belt that is a golden
[1:25:36] brother god speak of deity
[1:25:41] you need a court you see me everybody
[1:25:44] there
[1:25:46] having their what
[1:25:51] a little bit louder heaven there
[1:25:54] so the belt is not where we put our belt
[1:25:58] here
[1:25:58] [Music]
[1:26:01] everybody the belt of this angel
[1:26:04] are where the breast goes in the bible
[1:26:07] it says the paps
[1:26:13] it's a breast or in a perhaps position
[1:26:19] praise the lord seven
[1:26:22] and one of the beasts
[1:26:26] who is that beast i put a lie on there
[1:26:29] but the bible didn't say it the bible
[1:26:32] said
[1:26:32] one of the beasts let's repeat
[1:26:36] what the bible say i put here as a
[1:26:40] star one
[1:26:44] of the just the way it's written though
[1:26:48] four beasts
[1:26:53] we don't know who he is but stephen put
[1:26:55] a lie on there
[1:26:57] one of the four beasts gave
[1:27:00] this is not that he give he gives
[1:27:04] so when dos angel before they come out
[1:27:06] of the temple
[1:27:08] inside the temple one of the beasts
[1:27:11] gave them something are we there
[1:27:16] one of the beasts gave them gave to the
[1:27:19] seven angel
[1:27:20] seven golden vowel
[1:27:24] so we have number four here
[1:27:28] golden deity
[1:27:32] valve everybody clear
[1:27:35] seven golden vowel full of what
[1:27:40] i thought that the plague
[1:27:43] had the wrath of god
[1:27:47] right now the vow
[1:27:51] have the wrath of god
[1:27:56] in other words these two things
[1:28:02] are the same a trumpet
[1:28:06] is an instrument a trump
[1:28:10] is the sound of the trumpet are you
[1:28:14] there
[1:28:15] a valve is a container
[1:28:18] a plug is what is inside the valve
[1:28:25] we clear now we clear now
[1:28:31] go up to verse 6 to chapter 16 verse 1.
[1:28:36] and i heard a great voice out of the
[1:28:38] temple saying
[1:28:40] to the seven angel go your ways and pour
[1:28:43] out
[1:28:43] there vowel of the
[1:28:46] wrath of god upon the earth they don't
[1:28:48] say again poor the plague
[1:28:50] because the vow contender plug
[1:28:53] all of them life of god
[1:28:56] one is a container one is what is
[1:29:00] content
[1:29:01] inside but when you say
[1:29:04] poor the plug poor the valve it is the
[1:29:07] same
[1:29:08] thing
[1:29:12] we clear now as we look at this angel
[1:29:16] [Music]
[1:29:18] we see seven of them we just read them
[1:29:22] and they were given dosba by
[1:29:26] one of the four beasts and i put
[1:29:29] there that he was a lion

[1:30:02] angel
[1:30:03] the engine have to let jacob win
[1:30:08] so i want you to win
[1:30:11] okay i'll leave it alone revelation 4
[1:30:14] brother branham said when the pastor
[1:30:16] stand on the pulpit he's god's angel
[1:30:22] that was it revelation 4
[1:30:26] let's go to verse 7.

[1:32:29] let's leave it alone don't interpret
[1:32:32] leave it alone
[1:32:33] one of the four beasts
[1:32:37] say come and see let's just leave it
[1:32:40] alone we don't know him
[1:32:42] okay job two verse three
[1:32:47] and when he had opened the
[1:32:50] second seal i heard there
[1:32:53] now we have the order we have the order
[1:32:56] the second business who is
[1:33:00] oh let's check him
[1:33:03] we don't know the other one let's go to
[1:33:06] verse five
[1:33:08] and when he opened the third seal ahead
[1:33:12] there we have another
[1:33:16] who is the third business
[1:33:19] thank you let's go to verse seven
[1:33:23] and when he opened the fourth seal i
[1:33:26] heard the voice of the
[1:33:29] who's the foggiest
[1:33:34] now let's go back one of the four
[1:33:37] beasts we already know this we already
[1:33:41] know this
[1:33:42] we already know this so who is that
[1:33:44] beast
[1:33:48] any question so when the bible say one
[1:33:51] of the four beasts
[1:33:53] it referred to her
[1:33:56] it is hide to the eyes of the wise
[1:34:00] and reveal only to baby predestinated
[1:34:04] baby so this beast is a lion
[1:34:08] why a lion
[1:34:12] he leaves the throne to be an
[1:34:15] intercessor
[1:34:16] as a slain lamb to be a
[1:34:23] king to bring the word to
[1:34:27] to judgment who have rejected his
[1:34:31] a plague is given to those that have
[1:34:33] rejected what
[1:34:35] and the lion who's responsible for
[1:34:38] judgment
[1:34:39] must be the one to give it to
[1:34:46] everybody clear now are you there
[1:34:50] the lamb cannot speak because the lamb
[1:34:53] bring grace
[1:34:55] but once you reject once you
[1:34:58] eject the message the throne of god is
[1:35:02] turned
[1:35:02] into a throne of judgment are you there
[1:35:06] then there is no blood on the mercy seat
[1:35:10] because the blood is the message of the
[1:35:13] hour
[1:35:14] that's the token
[1:35:17] are you there once you reject the
[1:35:20] message
[1:35:21] you reject the blood then god speak to
[1:35:24] you as a lion
[1:35:31] remember the old testament teaching now
[1:35:33] as we heard it
[1:35:35] when the blood went off the mercy seat
[1:35:37] what was it
[1:35:38] judgment seat and when the lamb slain
[1:35:41] walked forward from eternity
[1:35:44] out of the father's throne and took his
[1:35:46] right he was a
[1:35:48] judgment seat then he became naughty
[1:35:51] at all king notice here he come
[1:35:55] leaves the children as an intercessor as
[1:35:57] a slain lamb to become
[1:35:59] a thing to bring the whole world into
[1:36:03] that is what rejecting the message
[1:36:07] turn god into an eye on you
[1:36:12] everybody clear but one of this
[1:36:15] angel is peculiar
[1:36:19] he's the one revealing the book who is
[1:36:22] this angel
[1:36:25] you ready we just saw that this
[1:36:28] angel one of them i just pulled one out
[1:36:32] because the bible said one of them so i
[1:36:34] leave the other one i just pulled one of
[1:36:36] them
[1:36:37] are you there this one has a plague
[1:36:42] a golden vowel val means the judgment
[1:36:46] plague have the wrath of god judgment
[1:36:48] golden
[1:36:49] means divine judgment the
[1:36:52] same moses that could pull israel out
[1:36:57] was able to destroy egypt
[1:37:00] the same word that said noah
[1:37:03] was the one that destroyed the
[1:37:06] unbeliever
[1:37:08] are you there you're following me so
[1:37:11] the golden vine is divine judgment
[1:37:14] divine vow it is an angel
[1:37:20] what kind of angelosi

[1:37:46] are free messengers that god
[1:37:49] dwells in
[1:37:53] to bring his earthly message
[1:37:57] and these are messenger angels of the

[2:07:59] to the marriage stopper of the lamb
[2:08:02] are you there and he says to me these
[2:08:04] are the true saying
[2:08:06] of god and i fell
[2:08:10] i thought jonah fell already in
[2:08:12] revelation 22
[2:08:13] when we read this is in 19.
[2:08:19] and i felt at the feet to do what
[2:08:25] to worship him so if you see people
[2:08:28] worshiping
[2:08:29] do you think it's crazy
[2:08:38] and i fell at his feet to worship him
[2:08:42] and he said to me who you who are
[2:08:45] waiting online
[2:08:46] just wait
[2:08:50] and i fell at his feet to worship him
[2:08:53] and he said to me see you do it not
[2:08:56] i am your fellow servant and of your
[2:09:00] brethren
[2:09:01] they have the testimony of
[2:09:04] he added that he has this testimony of
[2:09:06] jesus christ
[2:09:08] the testimony of jesus
[2:09:12] that's what he says he has the testimony
[2:09:15] of jesus
[2:09:17] worship god for the testimony of jesus
[2:09:20] is the spirit of
[2:09:22] in other words this man is a prophet
[2:09:27] he says he has the testimony of jesus
[2:09:29] christ
[2:09:31] what does that mean take revelation 6
[2:09:37] bear with me
[2:09:40] i don't want somebody to shoot you up
[2:09:42] there and say hey
[2:09:44] you are worshiping brother brown i'm in
[2:09:46] the message we got to deal with it
[2:09:49] revelation 6 verse 9
[2:09:52] and when he opened the fifth seal i saw
[2:09:56] under the altar
[2:09:57] the souls of them that was slain for the
[2:10:00] word of god
[2:10:01] and for the testimony which there
[2:10:05] did you see here he said the testimony
[2:10:07] of jesus
[2:10:12] brother branham these souls under the
[2:10:15] altar
[2:10:16] these souls are understanding now that
[2:10:19] is under the altar
[2:10:20] they were martyred by sinful men like
[2:10:23] eichmann
[2:10:23] talking about the jews see they are
[2:10:26] they are holding right on them million
[2:10:29] of them see
[2:10:30] but they are remain jews everybody clear
[2:10:34] verse 10 and they cry out with a loud
[2:10:37] voice saying
[2:10:38] how long o lord holy and true do you not
[2:10:42] judge and avenge our blood
[2:10:44] of them that dwell upon the earth so
[2:10:46] these souls
[2:10:47] have the testimony of god but they are
[2:10:50] crying for vengeance
[2:10:53] are you there now remember what is it
[2:10:57] they were killed for the word of god's
[2:10:59] sake
[2:11:00] not for the testimony of christ
[2:11:04] did you understand that remember the
[2:11:06] church comes in
[2:11:08] the mighty of the church was for the
[2:11:10] word of god
[2:11:11] and the testimony of christ but branham
[2:11:14] is explaining to you
[2:11:16] that the testimony of christ belonged to
[2:11:18] the bride
[2:11:22] whatever guarana they were slain for the
[2:11:26] testimony of god
[2:11:28] for the word of god the testimony they
[2:11:30] held
[2:11:31] now we found out that the bread was the
[2:11:34] word of god
[2:11:35] and the testimony of
[2:11:38] this had no testimony of jesus christ
[2:11:42] and you got to have the token
[2:11:46] and when the token comes it testifies
[2:11:49] off
[2:11:51] he said he would and christ is the word
[2:11:54] and how can you deny that the bible is
[2:11:56] true
[2:11:57] part of it and still say you have the
[2:11:59] token when the token is there
[2:12:03] off so the testimony of jesus christ is
[2:12:08] the
[2:12:09] token this angel had their
[2:12:18] token
[2:12:20] nothing particularly that none
[2:12:24] of this under the altar were killed for
[2:12:27] the testimony of jesus none of them
[2:12:29] they were not they were not like antipas
[2:12:31] who was slain for holding first his name
[2:12:34] these are not born-again ones
[2:12:39] no token with eternal life as their
[2:12:41] possession
[2:12:42] they come up in the resurrection and
[2:12:44] receive life
[2:12:46] because of their stand on the word and
[2:12:48] notice how they are crying out for
[2:12:52] they cannot be bright material
[2:12:55] their bread turned their cheek and
[2:12:58] christ
[2:12:58] forgive them father for they don't know
[2:13:01] what they
[2:13:02] are and you on the internet that
[2:13:05] follow me like a pharisee i forgive you
[2:13:08] this church forgives you because you
[2:13:10] don't know what you're doing
[2:13:13] but repent lest you find yourself
[2:13:15] fighting against god
[2:13:17] these are jews they have to be because
[2:13:21] they are in the fifth seal
[2:13:23] they are crying for what vengeance
[2:13:26] so this angel is a part of the
[2:13:31] blood and he has a token
[2:13:36] and in revelation 22 he is a prophet
[2:13:40] he's a saint he's a proud of the brother
[2:13:43] he's a man he's a prophet
[2:13:46] his message comes in book and audio
[2:13:49] he's a part of the bride he have a
[2:13:52] talking message
[2:13:53] who is this angel this is your angel
[2:13:59] [Applause]
[2:14:04] are we clear are we clear
[2:14:07] the problem we have brother stephen john
[2:14:10] fell down to do what
[2:14:15] why you ready
[2:14:20] there is brother branham said when you
[2:14:22] look at the scripture
[2:14:24] superficial you want to come up with a
[2:14:27] superficial understanding there is a
[2:14:30] double mystery to this
[2:14:34] okay number one john
[2:14:38] by nature he was a jew
[2:14:42] are you there but in this book of
[2:14:46] revelation
[2:14:48] who is john
[2:14:51] john being taken up immediately
[2:14:55] after the church age was the top of the
[2:14:58] rapture
[2:14:59] [Music]
[2:15:00] this is a gentile church
[2:15:06] it's coming this
[2:15:09] immediately after the church age is over
[2:15:13] this long audition churches then
[2:15:16] comes though so
[2:15:20] the church goes up like john did
[2:15:23] in the presence of the of god
[2:15:27] that just wings up my soul around
[2:15:30] caught up at the rapture of the church
[2:15:33] this place
[2:15:34] the book of revelation was written at
[2:15:37] the end of the day
[2:15:40] so john is dealing
[2:15:43] with this angel this angel
[2:15:47] is a messenger are you there
[2:15:50] but john represents the bride
[2:15:55] but the brand have two
[2:15:58] kind of people
[2:16:02] the fourth mystery of the new testament
[2:16:06] as one body composed of what jewsen
[2:16:11] so the bride of god help
[2:16:14] jews and gentiles because the bride
[2:16:18] started in jerusalem are you there
[2:16:21] but as we progress more and more
[2:16:24] after the italian church age brother
[2:16:27] branham said
[2:16:28] the jews drop and the church turn around
[2:16:31] completely to the gentile that's why
[2:16:34] brother branham always say
[2:16:35] luther wesley panicle luther wesley
[2:16:39] particle because that's the pride
[2:16:41] the part of the blood that is purely
[2:16:45] gentile are you there so
[2:16:48] john worshipping the angel
[2:16:52] is bringing up a behavior
[2:16:55] of gentile
[2:17:01] in other words the part
[2:17:04] of the bride that will be dealing
[2:17:07] with that angel will be a gentile
[2:17:12] blood not a jew
[2:17:20] we found john is a type of the gentile
[2:17:24] take out to chapter 10. we're gonna run
[2:17:27] sooner
[2:17:27] toward the airport but let's deal with
[2:17:31] this
[2:17:32] are you there at the chapter 10
[2:17:37] if you're there you can say amen verse
[2:17:40] 25
[2:17:42] and as peter was coming in who
[2:17:47] who was cornelius
[2:17:50] a jew what
[2:17:54] a gentile in the house of cornelius
[2:17:58] and as peter was coming cornelius met
[2:18:01] him
[2:18:02] and fell down at his feet and did what
[2:18:09] are you there so john
[2:18:12] felling down to worship was a signal
[2:18:16] that the part of the blood that's gonna
[2:18:19] deal with this angel
[2:18:21] will be a gentile brother
[2:18:29] we clear we just found another gentile
[2:18:32] here
[2:18:34] when the angel came and said call peter
[2:18:37] he's going to tell you when he said
[2:18:38] peter what did he do
[2:18:41] john was behaving like a gentile
[2:18:44] are you there when king nebuchadnezzar
[2:18:47] they opened the vision what did he do
[2:18:51] a gentile
[2:18:56] take act 14 you are attacking things you
[2:18:59] don't understand
[2:19:03] step up to chapter 14 verse eight
[2:19:08] and then started certain men had
[2:19:11] lystra was it jews
[2:19:15] was that jews okay
[2:19:18] elisha important in his feet being a
[2:19:22] cripper from his mother womb
[2:19:24] who never had walk the same heard paul
[2:19:27] speak
[2:19:28] who stand fastly beholding him
[2:19:31] and perceiving that he had faith to be
[2:19:34] healed
[2:19:34] said with a loud voice stand up right at
[2:19:37] your feet
[2:19:38] and he leap and walk a miracle and when
[2:19:40] the people saw what paul have done
[2:19:43] they lift up their voice saying in the
[2:19:46] speech of the la
[2:19:48] la canyon the gods are come down
[2:19:52] to us in the likeness of what gentile
[2:19:56] do you see their behavior every time the
[2:19:58] supernatural open what happened
[2:20:02] watch verse 12. and they called barnabas
[2:20:07] and paul mercurius because he was the
[2:20:10] chief
[2:20:12] then the priest of the of jupiter which
[2:20:15] was before
[2:20:16] the city brought oxen and garland to the
[2:20:19] gate
[2:20:19] and would have done sacrifice with that
[2:20:23] it's a gentle behavior
[2:20:27] are you there it is a signal that the
[2:20:31] part of the bride
[2:20:32] that's going to deal with this message
[2:20:35] of this angel
[2:20:36] will be a gentile

[2:21:17] mine
[2:21:18] so the image nebuchadnezzar made
[2:21:22] was the image of who
[2:21:26] you see now you see now

[2:22:02] verse 18 but if not
[2:22:06] these are the three people be known to
[2:22:09] you
[2:22:09] o king that we will not serve your gods
[2:22:13] adult no worship the golden image
[2:22:16] another
[2:22:17] statute which you have set up
[2:22:20] jews don't do that
[2:22:23] are you there it is a gentle behavior
[2:22:27] are you there naboo kenesa
[2:22:31] was the one that made a statute
[2:22:34] to daniel are you there and ask
[2:22:38] the people to worship it
[2:22:41] the three review refused
[2:22:44] but they never rejected daniel
[2:22:52] are you there the three people never
[2:22:55] says
[2:22:56] because daniel they are making your
[2:22:58] image from now on you are a false
[2:23:02] prophet
[2:23:05] are you there if somebody make a statute
[2:23:08] of brother branham
[2:23:10] and want us to worship we will refuse
[2:23:13] but the picture of the pillar of fire
[2:23:16] was not made by
[2:23:18] men it was the mechanical eye
[2:23:21] that caught the picture
[2:23:27] you need to know what an angle is
[2:23:32] are you there one day elisha was with
[2:23:35] gazi
[2:23:36] and he said there are more with us
[2:23:39] there's he doesn't see
[2:23:41] and he said lord open his eyes when they
[2:23:43] open his eyes
[2:23:45] gazi with a human eyes saw the
[2:23:48] supernatural
[2:23:49] but this time not human eye but
[2:23:52] a mechanical eye
[2:23:56] the mechanical does not fabricate
[2:24:00] like nebuchadnezzar he only declared
[2:24:04] it is not an adult
[2:24:10] in this church we have to lift the
[2:24:13] picture off the pillar attire
[2:24:15] [Applause]
[2:24:20] are you there it is not a jewish church
[2:24:24] it is a gentile church
[2:24:29] number two number one everybody clear
[2:24:32] it is a signal that the part of the
[2:24:34] bride
[2:24:35] will be gentile number two
[2:24:38] take luke 17.
[2:24:42] why is john falling down to worship
[2:24:45] this i have to put all of this down
[2:24:50] so we take off everybody clear
[2:24:54] verse 17. are you there i want everybody
[2:24:58] to read this
[2:25:00] you only have one service let's handle
[2:25:02] this
[2:25:03] before you get in the war up there are
[2:25:05] you there
[2:25:07] verse one then say he to the disciple
[2:25:10] it is
[2:25:15] it is impossible for what it is
[2:25:18] impossible for do you know what offense
[2:25:22] means
[2:25:24] do you know what offense means in other
[2:25:27] words
[2:25:27] it is inevitable for a stumbling
[2:25:31] block not to happen
[2:25:36] you want to remove stamping block
[2:25:39] god said it is impossible it must
[2:25:42] happen
[2:25:47] you need to understand god
[2:25:50] it is impossible that offense will not
[2:25:54] come
[2:25:55] but who will
[2:25:58] woe to him through whom they
[2:26:02] come we cannot stop
[2:26:05] somebody for doing things that are
[2:26:08] stupid
[2:26:10] but the problem is to him
[2:26:13] not as needed the message
[2:26:22] if somebody worship brother pronoun
[2:26:25] it is impossible matter of fact
[2:26:28] if nobody expressed that brother branham
[2:26:32] will be a false prophet
[2:26:34] [Applause]
[2:26:39] take matthew 26.
[2:26:49] take matthew 26 you acting like peter
[2:26:54] the scripture says jesus must die
[2:26:57] and peter is there lord they're not
[2:26:59] gonna kill you they're not gonna kill
[2:27:01] you
[2:27:01] like he loved jesus more if you were
[2:27:04] there
[2:27:04] you're gonna say oh peter he really
[2:27:07] loved
[2:27:08] jesus do you know what jesus said he
[2:27:11] said he was satan
[2:27:14] are you there he said get out of here
[2:27:17] devil
[2:27:18] are you there the one who was
[2:27:21] blocking the fulfillment of the prophecy
[2:27:25] was satan through credit
[2:27:31] he doesn't want jesus to be rejected
[2:27:34] but of faith must come
[2:27:37] to him for jesus to be good messiah
[2:27:40] jesus needs to stay alive
[2:27:44] for this message to be true there should
[2:27:47] be
[2:27:48] no adult achieving the message
[2:27:51] the same spirit
[2:27:56] verse 24.
[2:28:01] verse 24 if you dare you can say amen
[2:28:04] the son of man goes as it is
[2:28:09] but whoa to that man by whom the son of
[2:28:13] man
[2:28:13] is betrayed it has been good for that
[2:28:17] man if he had not been
[2:28:19] in other words somebody must fulfill
[2:28:22] a scripture but
[2:28:26] what to him for fulfilling that
[2:28:28] scripture
[2:28:29] it was better for judah not to be born
[2:28:33] but judah must be born
[2:28:36] and he must betray the messiah to make
[2:28:40] the old testament prophecy
[2:28:42] become true
[2:28:46] somebody must worship brother branham
[2:28:50] it is bad it is not good but
[2:28:53] he get to make the center true
[2:28:57] [Music]
[2:28:59] if nobody expressed that spirit of
[2:29:02] idolatry
[2:29:03] brother branham does not qualify to be
[2:29:06] that angel
[2:29:08] offense must come but woe
[2:29:11] to him the offense comes
[2:29:14] offense is proving to us it is
[2:29:18] the messiah it is the message of the
[2:29:20] hour it is the truth
[2:29:25] you don't take your mind and understand
[2:29:28] the bible with human mind
[2:29:31] take a look 24.
[2:29:36] we want to stop judah if judah didn't
[2:29:39] kill him
[2:29:41] how would we have power over the devil
[2:29:45] huh how
[2:29:48] joseph expressed clearly that he was
[2:29:51] sold for 30 pieces of
[2:29:53] of silver you don't want judah to do
[2:29:55] that
[2:29:56] no judah must do that and when we see we
[2:30:00] look at the old testament we say that's
[2:30:01] the messiah
[2:30:04] are you there but we acting like peter
[2:30:07] no we don't want
[2:30:08] judah to do that judah must fulfill
[2:30:11] prophecy would dictate the event
[2:30:16] but woe to judah
[2:30:19] it was good for judah not to be born
[2:30:22] but judah must be born
[2:30:30] luke 24 20 44. the bible says
[2:30:35] and he said to them these are the words
[2:30:38] which have spoken to you
[2:30:39] one was yet with you that all
[2:30:42] things must be fulfill
[2:30:46] which were written in the law of moses
[2:30:48] and in the prophet
[2:30:49] and in a psalm concerning what so if
[2:30:52] this century was worshipped in
[2:30:56] the book of revelation that must be
[2:30:58] fulfilled
[2:31:01] not for us to worship him but it is
[2:31:04] a cleaner determination that we are
[2:31:07] following
[2:31:08] the right thing
[2:31:14] is a dollar tree in a message a problem
[2:31:16] again
[2:31:19] no word to him who does that
[2:31:22] word to him who worship brother branham
[2:31:25] but to me it's a signal that
[2:31:28] our brother branham is a true
[2:31:31] messenger
[2:31:39] then then john the revelator the whole
[2:31:41] book of revelation
[2:31:43] was wrote when he was wrote he said
[2:31:46] i have sent my angel jesus did and john
[2:31:50] fell down to worship the angel
[2:31:52] but the angels said stand up worship god
[2:31:55] see a true angel of god won't stand to
[2:31:58] be worshiped
[2:32:00] and he said that he was a prophet and
[2:32:03] was his fellow man
[2:32:04] that had been sent to signify these
[2:32:07] things
[2:32:08] therefore angelic being is ordained
[2:32:10] minister of god
[2:32:11] to come to the earth to bear record of
[2:32:14] the
[2:32:14] word so no true angel will stand to be
[2:32:18] what
[2:32:20] brother branham what did you do when
[2:32:22] people begin to worship you
[2:32:28] is this something new you went to asia
[2:32:31] you see people worshiping brother
[2:32:32] branham
[2:32:33] they did it when he was alive
[2:32:36] it is not new news it's not good news
[2:32:42] it is not breaking news it was
[2:32:45] there when he was alive
[2:32:48] and he must be when he is alive if it
[2:32:51] happens when he's dead
[2:32:53] it's a problem it must happen when he's
[2:32:56] alive
[2:32:56] [Music]
[2:33:01] i heard a few more times and the other
[2:33:04] day in canada yeah
[2:33:07] i thought he was hidden i thought he was
[2:33:10] a heater who's who's going to do that
[2:33:12] naboo caneles are mine john
[2:33:15] yeah apostle prophet
[2:33:19] christian who did this here

[2:34:23] listening you who put thumbs down
[2:34:26] your times will go up
[2:34:34] [Music]
[2:34:36] if he had been an enemy if he had been
[2:34:39] my enemy

[2:34:44] a precious darling
[2:34:47] john beloved john
[2:34:51] the beloved john
[2:34:58] come up to confess his sins and he's
[2:35:02] wrong
[2:35:02] and say his faith is me as being
[2:35:06] jesus christ
[2:35:10] and i got all kind of leather that has

[2:35:43] i went to the lord here not long ago
[2:35:46] when i first heard it about a year ago
[2:35:49] and then when i went to the lord
[2:35:51] and he referred to me today
[2:35:55] instead of god saying don't worry about
[2:35:57] that god say
[2:35:58] go look at there
[2:36:01] [Music]
[2:36:03] instead of god say you are right what
[2:36:06] they are doing is bad
[2:36:08] god is telling brother branham look at
[2:36:09] that
[2:36:13] look at that that when john
[2:36:16] came forth preaching that they had not
[2:36:19] had a prophet
[2:36:20] on the earth for so many years until
[2:36:24] there was all a mess in the heart
[2:36:26] thinking maybe
[2:36:27] john was there in other words instead of
[2:36:31] god saying william bradham don't be
[2:36:34] broken-hearted god look at brother
[2:36:36] branham he said why are you crying
[2:36:38] look in the scripture when john came
[2:36:41] with the spirit of elijah they did the
[2:36:44] same thing
[2:36:45] and you also have the spirit of elijah
[2:36:48] what do you expect
[2:36:50] [Applause]
[2:36:51] do you expect less do you expect less
[2:36:57] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[2:37:00] and
[2:37:01] forever god does not
[2:37:03] [Applause]
[2:37:11] let me see if i can i can pull that i
[2:37:14] can pull that
[2:37:19] where are you yeah that's it
[2:37:22] john he said he was not he even give the
[2:37:26] scripture
[2:37:26] remember if you ever believe me
[2:37:30] if you ever believe me to be huh
[2:37:35] remember that is hell it is
[2:37:40] the self the lord it is
[2:37:43] a has nothing to do with it i am y'all
[2:37:48] in 1961 why didn't you reject
[2:37:52] the message
[2:38:01] who is this angel it's your messenger
[2:38:05] there is seven church edges seven plugs
[2:38:08] seven seal seven trumpet and by god's
[2:38:12] help
[2:38:13] and with the book of history i can prove
[2:38:15] to you
[2:38:16] that we are living in the seventh
[2:38:18] trumpet
[2:38:19] gospel champion for the seventh plague
[2:38:23] and for the seventh seal to be open and
[2:38:26] the seven
[2:38:27] vow to be poor everything together
[2:38:32] we have more stricter fundamental proof
[2:38:36] of it
[2:38:37] than that we do we have more stricter
[2:38:40] fundamental proof i believe by faith
[2:38:44] and what if the angel of the lord was
[2:38:46] standing here now
[2:38:48] circling and every one of your eyes
[2:38:51] would be visualized
[2:38:52] to see that would be pretty good but
[2:38:56] to look at this picture often
[2:38:59] is far more proof
[2:39:03] than what if you was looking with your
[2:39:08] eyes
[2:39:11] see isn't that right because you could
[2:39:14] have an
[2:39:15] optical illusion but that camera
[2:39:19] won't take an optical illusion it won't
[2:39:22] do it because it's a camera
[2:39:24] it will take the action he has to be
[2:39:28] there
[2:39:28] to strike there this is not another
[2:39:38] if you wish to sell it make it enough
[2:39:41] so every person poor people can get it
[2:39:45] but i say look another thing i will
[2:39:48] require for the
[2:39:51] this picture is sacred
[2:39:55] it is not something to play around we
[2:39:58] are not worshiping brother branham
[2:40:00] brother branham is the seven angel the
[2:40:03] one who have a commission
[2:40:05] to unveil the book of revelation
[2:40:08] but if somebody worship him word to them
[2:40:12] but scripture must be fulfilled
[2:40:15] any question let's stand
[2:40:19] sunday the mystery of the tuesday
[2:40:22] [Applause]
[2:40:33] you saw who jerobel was you saw who the
[2:40:36] seven angel
[2:40:38] with the last trump was you saw who is
[2:40:42] unveiling this book of revelation which
[2:40:44] is the revelation of the entire bible
[2:40:47] it is still to the alleged to the to the
[2:40:51] to to the educated it's only revealed
[2:40:54] through prophet
[2:40:55] but he has a mystery connected to it
[2:40:58] that ninja
[2:40:59] is not a heavenly it's an earthly manger
[2:41:02] he's a saint he's part of the blood he's
[2:41:05] your brother
[2:41:06] he's a prophet he's a man he's a human
[2:41:09] being
[2:41:10] but he have been commissioned to unfold
[2:41:13] the entire book of revelation
[2:41:15] and if somebody fall down to worship him
[2:41:19] two ways number one we are gentile
[2:41:22] it's a gentle behavior showing to the
[2:41:24] people that he's gonna deal
[2:41:26] with the gentile broad and number two
[2:41:29] offense must come to line up with the
[2:41:33] scripture
[2:41:34] wrong to him that does it but he have
[2:41:37] nothing to do
[2:41:38] with the vindication of the message the
[2:41:40] message
[2:41:41] stands true and that offense of judah
[2:41:45] make jesus christ more the messiah
[2:41:49] let's pray heavenly father
