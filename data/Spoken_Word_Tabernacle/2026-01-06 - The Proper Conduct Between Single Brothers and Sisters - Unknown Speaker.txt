TRANSCRIPT
========================================
When we talk about these things, this is not things that we talk and you forget. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; David says in Psalm 119, he say, "Thy word have I hidden in my heart &gt;&gt; so that I do not sin." So whenever we going through these kind of things, you need to take them, put it in you and keep it and use it. &gt;&gt; If you just here to listen and once you leave here, you begin to think about anything else beside what was preached, the devil will ambush you. That's right. &gt;&gt; So whatever we talk about, whether we talk about high heel, we demonstrated, we put a chart on high heel, we talk about uh makeup, we talk about earring, all these kind of things, you need to keep it for yourself, keep the scripture, keep the code. So not only do you need it for yourself, but you need to teach the oncoming generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we tell you that a boy and a girl should not be friend, a boy and a girl cannot be friend. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where is my friend? You there? &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No. Cut it on. It's not on. &gt;&gt; So when you don't say amen, I'm fine. I got my co-pilot here. It's not on. Let me give you one so we can preach together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In this church, we don't believe in boys and girls being friend. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; And texting each other. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody okay? &gt;&gt; Everybody okay? &gt;&gt; If you have any relationship with a boy, you need to talk to your parent first &gt;&gt; and let the parent know that you are courting or you are in relationship with a boy or a young girl and your parent will guide you. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. But we don't believe in young sisters and young men in this message texting each other, calling each other and things like that. Parents, if you find those kind of relationship, cut it off. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you want to have a friend, get married. &gt;&gt; If you want to have a friend, get married. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And sit with your friend and you can talk all day. And I don't have any problem with that. IF YOUR WIFE CALL ME SAY BROTHER STEPHEN MY HUSBAND talk to me all day I will be clapping hand &gt;&gt; I don't have any problem but NOT TALKING TO THIS SISTER AND THIS SISTER and this brother and this brother no sir &gt;&gt; under no circumstances should be in any relationship without your parent knowing that &gt;&gt; and parent if you know it cut it off because they came from the back door. &gt;&gt; We don't want back door relationship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want front door relationship. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you love me, come straight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; COME TO OUR HOUSE. SIT ON THE living room and tell me how much you love me. &gt;&gt; Your attention. &gt;&gt; Everybody okay? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Everybody okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE WHO are texting at 2:00 a.m. IN THE MORNING. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHY YOU TALKING TO A YOUNG LADY AT 2:00 a.m.? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say at 2 a.m. the activity of devils are increased. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the most danger is calling you on FaceTime. &gt;&gt; To see what &gt;&gt; See what it &gt;&gt; CUT IT OFF. &gt;&gt; CUT IT OFF. &gt;&gt; Everybody okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cut it off. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; CALLING YOU ON VIDEO CALL. CUT IT OFF. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Why do you need a video call? &gt;&gt; Come to our home. &gt;&gt; Come and see me. &gt;&gt; See me the way I am. &gt;&gt; Not the way I'm airbrushed. See me if I have a little pimple &gt;&gt; and get the package the way it is. &gt;&gt; Brother, &gt;&gt; can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we do not believe in those kind of relationship. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Who you who have many friends when you get married you're going to get in trouble. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is this 10,000 friends? &gt;&gt; How are you going to manage them now? You're married. &gt;&gt; How are you going to cut them off? &gt;&gt; So begin to &gt;&gt; cut them off. All right. &gt;&gt; Cut them off right now. &gt;&gt; So by the time you get married, you'll be free. &gt;&gt; And you worry about your children and your husband. &gt;&gt; Everybody okay? &gt;&gt; We clear so far. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Whether you don't say amen, I say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You want to get married, we believe in getting married. Very good. Go to the parent. Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell my father, "Daddy, mommy, I'm interested in so and so." And over there, they give also the report. When the two families are okay now, you can go ahead and begin to talk. And when it's finished, you bring it to me. We bring you here. Bless you. And then &gt;&gt; we're waiting for the remaining of the stuff. Everybody okay? &gt;&gt; That's what we want. Glory to God. Those who
