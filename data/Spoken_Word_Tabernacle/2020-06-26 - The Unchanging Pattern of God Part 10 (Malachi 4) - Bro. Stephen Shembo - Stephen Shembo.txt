brother Branham say they should be far today in modern day every day but today is special for the fathers so sisters treat them a little bit more special praise God everybody happy everybody can hear me pretty good like they praise the Lord let's go straight to our scriptures I know you had a break for couple weeks so we Maori boot our systems a little bit second King chapter 1 beginning by the third verse if you dare you can say Amen what David we put this board here and set the pulpit here so everybody can get up from there if you don't mind please you can put right in the middle there can everybody see it it's pretty good he's the connection between me and the board I can't help it second king chapter 2 which after 1 verse 3 the Bible say but the angel of the Lord say to Elijah the Tishbite you might be seated because we need to build by the in the Lord say to teach so here we know the actual bodies are dressing his word and to woman or to somebody we don't know it's very bad everybody ready and inheritance the land I have been sent by the King to do a special mission he said to me the messenger of the Samaria and say to them is he not because there is not a God in Israel that you go to inquire of Belgium open the god of Ekron now therefore does say the Lord they Modell's they open the god of eco now therefore does say the Lord they meet aloud and they also meet Elijah with a word from the Lord Elijah had a dad saved the Lord these were messenger from Samaria the work Samaritan so we suppose that they should know Elijah the prophet everybody did now therefore that say the Lord you shall not come down from the bed in which you go a truly die and Elijah depart these people met Elijah the prophet this messenger spoke to Elijah the prophet this messenger heard has prophet Elbert clear now verse 6 and they say to him there came a man let me go back to verse 5 and when the messenger turned back to him he says to them talking about the king of Samaria why are you now turned back in other word I sent you for a mission written you didn't go to the mission you soon came back to me why did you come back so we expect this messenger to tell the king that we met a larger the Prophet we met Elijah the prophet with the save the Lord and Elijah give us a message but for some reason even though these messenger met Elijah the Prophet even though the metal the profit under the anointing of God even though they met Elijah the Prophet under the anointing of the Holy Spirit with that save the Lord despite the fact that they come encounter with the Ministry of the larger the Prophet yet they did not know or recognize who the man owes when they asked them why did you come in verse 6 they say there came a man so the metal aaja they didn't know was Elijah Elijah miracle in Israel Elijah will turn on the heart of Israel back to God Elijah Prague and I met him and still did not know him profit normally they should say we met a man of but they say a man of God they just say we met a man who is this man Allah we are and they say to him there came up a man a man up to meet us and say to us go turn again to the king that sent you and say to him that said the Lord he is he not because there is not a God in Israel that you sent to inquire of Beelzebub the god of Ekron therefore you shall not come down from the bed on which you are gone up but shall surely die I want to draw your attention to verse 7 and he said to them the king what manner of men in other words you are just telling me a man meet you but can you please describe me the man you said we met him and with that saith the Lord you are supposed to know who that man based on his worldwide ministry in Israel but you met Elijah you don't know him can you please describe me the man that you met give me a little bit more detail give me a little bit more description about the manner in what manner of man was he which came up to meet you and told you twirled verse 8 and they answer him he was a hairy man and girl with a girdle of leather and run a blood is launched and he said it is a larger the tisch body so the King needed more characteristic the King needed detail they came needed some more future the King needed a lot of description to identify who was the man that this Samaritan did not know about it so when they give him a prf physical appearance a physical karate mystic of the larger than the king understood that demand uh spoke with you was Elijah the prophet so Elijah the prophet was identified by his body future he was identified by his appearance he was identified by his characteristic everybody clear thank God let's go to second King chapter two just the next chapter to it you should be right on second Kings chapter 2 verse 8 if you dare you can say Amen and Elijah took his mantle this is Elijah with Elijah we all know the story and Elijah took his mantle and wrap it together and smote the orders and they were divided here and there so that day two went over on dry ground so Elijah and Elijah came in front of Jordan when they came in front of Jordan Elijah took his mentor repair on smite the order the water separated and they both went away and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said to Elisha ask what I shall do for you before I be taken away from you and Elisha say a prayer you let a double portion of your spirit be upon me so a larger was asking for the anointing of the Spirit that was on Elijah the Prophet to come upon him but how are we going to recognize that the spirit of Elijah came upon Elijah how are we going to identify the spirit or the anointing of Elijah upon Elijah we know Elijah is a friend we know Elijah is brother rabbit we know Elijah is brother Abel but how can we look Robert how can we look and brother Abel and tell that it is not brother Abel who's working it is the anointing of God that is working upon ever it is not brother Robert who's working because it's the anointing of God working upon brother Robert even though the name is different but the anointing must be determined you need to understand these things if not you're going to miss God because God can change hell you got to know him by his characteristic everybody verse 13 hallelujah he took up also the mentor this is not Elijah Elijah is gone he dropped the mantle this is Elijah who took Demento we are trying to identify how are we going to be sure the spirit of Elijah came upon Elijah the Bible say he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the Bank of Jordan as far as the mentor we can say yes he is killing the mantle of Elijah he is carrying the tapes he's showing the books but how are we going to know if the god of Elijah is with you Alleluia the devil is a liar please God everybody and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smote the world in other word he went back and did exactly the same thing that Elijah did other and brother Branham say Elijah was the type of Jesus Christ and we say Elijah was the top of the church and Jesus said that the work that I do you shall do it also so to prove to us that Jesus is in your life we must see the same work that Jesus did because he's the same yesterday today and everybody clear he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smote the orders and say where is the Lord God Marja not really God well is the anointing that work with Elijah you know I want the specific anointing I met Jordan just like my master met Jordan I asked him a double portion of his spirit if the Spirit came upon me I must cross Jordan the same way he crossed with me very clear and the Bible say and when he altos meet in the orders they did what the warrior obeyed him the water for the father here and there and Elijah not we 15 and when the sons of the Prophet in other word when Elijah was doing this some people were standing afar off watching him okay they saw him with the mentor but because he was carrying the mental they didn't say anything you can carry the book no problem we've seen so many of that you can listen to the tape it's good no problem we've seen people listening to the tape and acting crazy but those songs of the Prophet we are watching for something everybody let lets see you in front of Jordan then we're going to tell whether you have the anointing of the larger or not everybody there and when verse 15 and when the sons of the Prophet which were to view a Jericho so him they say the spirit of Elijah does rest on Elijah and they came to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before him they identified the spirit of Elijah by the anointing they identified the spirit of Elijah by the works that he produced the man is not larger his name is Elijah but when they were talking to him they always see brother Elijah brother Elijah brother Elijah but when the anointing of Elijah manifested himself through him they didn't look at him anymore like Elijah they never look at his natural name anymore at the beginning they could say brother Billy at the beginning they could say brother anima but when the manifestation of the anointing cancer you need to check you from a natural standpoint all the way to a higher level where you don't look at the men anymore you don't look at the name anymore you don't look at the rest anymore but you identifying the man by the anointing hallelujah let's go to John chapter five then we going to pray if you dare you can say a man the first identification was by the body by the appearance the second identification was by this spirit by the anointing everybody clear at the opening of the seals the barber became a new book John chapter father verse 36 if you dare you can say Amen this is Jesus speaking but I have greater witness than that of John for the works we already talked about the works for the works which the father has given me to finish the same works that I do bear me witness of me that the father has sent me in other word our works the work of the Spirit through me is testifying to you that I am the Messiah if you have a difficulty with my complexion if you have a difficulty with mothers if you are because the woman at the well when she met Jesus Christ she was approaching him through his race she said you are a Jew I am a Samaritan she was in the church but she was caught up with the flesh and then that's why you need to be very careful you can miss God by being caught up with your preference you can miss God with your flesh God can be there in an African man God can be very in a white man God can be ver in a Hispanic man now you can be fair in the bloodline you need to move from the flesh oh we don't get along with sorry so this rest don't get along with fine so you can mix god hallelujah Jesus look at her you say if you do if you do who was asking you the order you should be the one asking me are you do and when Jesus opened the second pool the woman forget about the flesh the woman forgot about the country the woman forgot about the racial she went a little bit higher and she says sir I perceive that you hire let Roger I don't look at your sister like your sister you can miss God God can be talking to society if you still get cut up it's stable it's very John father's wife so I know how you can miss God God might be talking to her God might be talking to sister data God might be talking through sister Karima she study you must be able to design God most of the time we sit down oh it's Sister Dee but we don't talk to her much we just shake hand you can miss God hallelujah verse 37 and the father himself which has sent me has borne witness of me everybody there you have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape and you have not his word abiding in you for whom he has sent him you believe not watch verse 13 on search the scripture in other word you struggle so much with the work you struggle so much with my breath you struggle so much with my natural history I want beyond natural history prove to you that I am the Messiah but still you don't understand so since the body part does help you even go I was grown in Bethlehem because when the coal Netanya the center we have found the Messiah Nathanael said where is he from oh he's from South Carolina oh he's from Canada oh he's from Ohio the Messiah cannot come from Nazareth the Jordan stop are you Jesus opened the second pool well he is when you pray he forgot about Nazareth he forgot about your honor he forgot about Africa he forgot about America he went higher you are the king of Israel hallelujah if the Holy Spirit shipping things away because you have a difficulty with my body you have a difficulty with my work you have the difficulty with man ministry despite my ministry is clearly Rand Academy used to have a problem with it now let me help you up father search scripture verse steady man search the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal eyes and they are there which one testify of me if you can stand the body part coming will be higher look at the anointing look at the work look at the life look at the ministry if you still have a problem go back to the world go back to the scripture now search the scripture because over there we don't argue if it's broken it is spoken heaven else must pass away but my word job let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your grace for your love your mercy and we thank you for being such a great father to us to give us opportunity to gather together around your world not just the N word but they reveal word of the our Lord we are committing this service unto the hand may the Holy Spirit may the inside the teacher may you come download and teach this word to your children may you touch those that are feeble and may you strengthen them Lord may you touch those that are sick and may you heal them Lord may you touch those that have been struggling may you stabilize them Lord may you touch those that have been under long influence that you deliver them Lord may you take this entire service unto the head for the glory of your name in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you we will continue with our subject the unchanging pattern of God Malachi full portend brother Branham say in the message the identified cost of all ages he said the unchangeable God because God does not change he is the same yesterday today and forever he's poking the book of Malachi he said I am God and I changed not the unchangeable God with the unchangeable character everybody clear and he is corrupt lipstick remember to identify Elijah they must have his characteristic everybody clear his characteristic remain the same he cannot change his characteristic he cannot do it anything is known by its character will state what David who is he a tree there is something missing here if you can adjust that screen a little bit I don't want people to say brother Steve and say yeah you need to read it yourself the Bible say brother Branham say everybody there just adjust a lot of it so they might be able to see characteristic I don't want any question okay you know you might bring it down probably there might be something that yeah just let's see what's there okay everybody's in there anything is known by each characteristic everybody clear all right brother Branham continues here they can see that service order Finnegan he said now everything that we found can be identified by each characteristic Elijah has to be identified by his characteristic a man matters who is the man we don't know him we don't know his name can you give the description when the gaff the description the men say it is a larger the Fischbach he didn't need the picture he didn't need the video by characteristic he could tell it is a larger profit everybody there now we notice like in animal life you take like in bird life now you take a yellow hammer one is flying and a jaybird they look a whole lot like when you look at girls two bugs flying you can get easily confused between them everybody clear but the characteristics you need to be trained on how to recognize God the Jews were training the Samaritan were trainer but the gentle natural that's why we have a difficulty recognizing a prophet hallelujah but the characteristic of a yellow hammer he flaps his wings and job and then up and down and up and down that's the characteristic if you noticed the j-bird flies more in a beeline you watch the quail when he comes up the bobwhite yah he flies watch the Gambel quail when it comes up you hunters you see there is a difference watch the judge denied and the Wilson snipe the characteristic determine what is everybody well that's why I'm taking my time showing to you what happened in MO horrible will happen in more sunset mantle what happen in this because by the description of the characteristic you gonna come back you want to come down to your own conclusion that truly I believe that brother Branham is Molokai so it's not going to be again mama told me Papa told me the preacher told me I was born in the message but you need to see it for yourself a great ship standing on the mountainside if he has his button the bad part of the rant his wife the other part is great if you didn't know the characteristics of that ship could be a deal see you have to know the characteristic of them to detect what is and what is not who is the Landers to you he was holy man girded with a little bed that Elisha the prophet everybody clear God identify himself by his characteristic even God is identified by Hills characteristic and then the God working also there is a characteristic in a god and a ship that you would have to know the difference in them when you were high because they both dwell high in the mountain are you there he said you have to know the difference but if you notice a god stumble himself as he walk either let you are in your Christian walk you are not stumbling everybody when where a ship city's feet done like this and ship work a God is always stumbling the characteristic of the way he makes his truck you identify your game by the characteristic of what he does and how he acts and what he feels if you are still feeding on pornography you need a changer hallelujah and everything in identify itself by each characteristic and then you jump one and watch what happened you can tell the way to go you can tell by that characteristic of a different animal here is the key everything that is on earth today in the way of spiritual things now we are not in the nature such as the Spirit of God and the spirit of the devil and all the coach and everything that we have today in the world they began in Genesis so if you see a crowd today it should be in the book of Genesis the devil is in the book of Genesis God is in the book of Genesis everything that you see here is already written in the Bible because history repeats itself Genesis means the beginning and all those things yet under another name don't be caught up by the name either when they come in the Bible they meant a man by the name of John the Baptist either the name of John the Baptist was not in his family either he was born the son of Zechariah but the name of John came from the angel of the Lord and when they give the child a name their family say wait a minute where is this name coming from which this man coming from they say no no no just give him the name John that came from the angel so when John begins to grow he begin to express a ministry one inch the ministry everybody knew him who is there that is taking the people and drowning them in order it is John Baptist who Israel over there it's John the Baptist who is preaching over there it's John the Baptist but when the Pharisee sang people from Jerusalem when they came to John the Baptist they already knew his name already knew his father his history another thing and they asked him who are you today that question did it mean that they didn't know his name either the Jews don't look at things like ours the true meaning behind that was who are you in the scripture over here you are doing things that are strange you are talking strange way you came up with a strong sermon you came up with with a strange way of preaching the world we want you to identify yourself in the scripture either Joel never look at them and say I am understood their question are you there in other word the Jews will not cut up under the label they understood that the name can be a different name but you need to see who is very indiscreet today when General John say I am the false crying in the wilderness in other words go up in your Bible go to Isaiah 40 when you read Isaiah for the that is me did you see in the Bible the Pharisees say no no no no no we are asking you your true name we want to see a passport we want to see your ID no they were asking identity don't be caught up in the name Oh John the Baptist John the doctor told about this when Jesus came and they asked him a badge earner Jesus say the man that you call John the brother that you call Colima that's not kolima Daejeon Jeju coach on the help or dr. ko ever his true name is a large of the Prophet brother the name of John the Baptist is not in the Old Testament it's not dead I'm not gonna accept this show me the name of John the Baptist in the Old Testament I know that while brother Branham say yet under another name another for under the first Army might be a terminal the second term he may be shot he may be a big man he might be a white man he might be a black man he might be an Hispanic name don't be caught out by the former don't be caught up by the name look at the anointing behind the lemon it's not you're gonna miss God if not God can pass through you and you miss him because you were caught up by phone you were caught up by the name I don't like that name I don't like that see I don't like the brother I don't like the way Jesus you can miss God are you there yet under another name under another phone but the same spirit that began in Genesis brings it out watch their characteristic then you're going to identify who is working there why in Genesis 18 somebody come down and begin to walk and begin to walk people saw him on the road they say hello he say hello hello hello you three come here they say is a you three come here the cerebrum these are strangers not citizen body you want to entertain strangers look beyond stranger this is God himself in human flesh other and one God enter there he took the back and we put into the tent and we begin to dissolve form a Jewish man American man different neighbor not the Lord Jesus Christ but the land brother branham we see he's doing this you need to know you seek he's an American citizen he is brother branham he was born in Kentucky go higher than that look at the characteristics and when wanna say go back to Genesis 18 I am giving you a sauna I am turning my back you can miss God if you are not showing well everybody clear the way we're going I don't know if I will finish this I even shrank things we found out that the spirit of Elijah comes first five which is great I'm touching quick so we can come back on board he said all right remember yet future now he could not have been the coming of the earth he was delighted his name was John but spiritually speaking his Elijah here but he comes first comes now Jesus ji j esus faith grace father is the number of grace Elijah makes for appearing one term Elijah another one Elijah different name different form by the same spirit in other word in a depressed journal different name different form the same spirit at the end of the general this is one of our problems and author with losses to the Jews now perfect number the profit profit profit messenger stone ball in the fictional notice this manner capitalized by God from the original ministry for future service they serve it so well just fill that spirit of Elijah ministers phantoms Moses to what capital F of father of further services so the first time Elijah the prophet the second term Elisha Tom John the Baptist the fourth the fifth time Elijah and Moses back to the Jews but the fifth the fourth time it is where we have a struggle his name is Elijah here appear he changes them appear he again change the name either do you expect him to be called a larger or a different name everybody clear the first one Jew ii jus they turned a Jew the fifth one Jews this one gentle to establish our foundation of the spirit of Elijah working with the Jetta we took the the top of the claw and we found that the crew first is a scavenger and the crew was living with lower eating knowledge food under North Ministry but he waited for an opportunity to live Noah's Ark when the window open when the internet open when that believes the Sun crazy internet open up the emotion opportunity for the crowd to feed on something else which was dead rotten bodies and leave the message are we there brother branham say this he said notice the vultures of Jesus belly was also casting out Devils so don't think somebody who's living the message doesn't have a ministry [Music] Anointed One on the carcasses living the message to the living the message back to the Methodist living the message back to the world dead carcasses is the right they were casting out Devils Jesus said so and remember they had prophets in those days Caiaphas the high priest prophesied how many knows that care first professor notice the mission of the week the anointing words from God but he was not a grain of wheat are you there as far as the crow is with the dog both of them are bird but the nature are different hallelujah notice the position of the wielding the field its water by the same anointing why did the Bible say he professor because he was high priest that year rotten scavenger careful a we agree so saving among the will lock the crew was selling in the okra flour all this time yet he will still a crew everybody there but selling among the wheat but the spirit was upon him they genuine Holy Spirit of God the Holy Spirit of God was upon him to preach to prophesy to foretell it to come to pass and after preaching the message after prophesying the message after telling four things about the message yet he end up the name and crucifying the very very candid world of the hour everybody brother branham the spirit can come out here and unknown tieu to do a certain things and you do it but that girl maybe was changed this is where we trust in the message need to wake up you can preach the message here but what's your heart you can be anointed but what is the condition of your heart think of it Kieffer's professor Judah has that devil see the spirit anointed him this rain falls on the just and the unjust the weeds can rejoice with the wind just like normal screeching the grinded of where both of them enjoying are there but it's what is in the heart Malachi 4 came to turn the heart there is were you intellectual can accept it say oh sure that look good I believe that the still don't do it no sir and the spirit can actually make witness of it and still it is not so because it's God show has now come from God he can make all the impersonation out there but he cannot be real he's still a crowd to begin with he was judah the son of what perdition he came from hell he need to go back to her yet before going back to hell he is going to go through the church health ministry cast out never be under the ministry and yet crucified the ministry you cannot healing you cannot like you have you cannot like you receive wisdom can out like they are Christian God bless you all how are you doing oh let's thank you let's we'll be good oh god bless you let's bow our heart let me go god bless you sister you cannot do that and be ever so good at it but that government they are says the lawyer that's exactly right their spirit envy day their real genuine through the Holy Spirit can anoint you that still don't mean you are self it is that inside so that never dies it's got eternal life he always was eternal I see it come from God he goes to God it is the soul watch the condition of your heart if not you're going to miss God now when we approach Elijah with the gentle we look at the crew in a different angle are there because the jente were always unclean Jesus look at the syrophoenician woman he said it is not good to take the meat of the children and give it to dogs either so we found out Elijah was entertained by clothes but these clothes were commanded by God they were bringing him bread and lead they were not bringing Elijah dead rotten food so the nature of this group changes on the outside they are gentle on the outside they are clothed but they are tied to have changed they don't no longer live like gentle they begin to eat green food either if somebody look at the scripture superficially brother Branham say you're going to come up with a superficial understanding are you there then brother Branham called them the servant of God and they were human beings and 1 Peter received a vision to go to the house of Cornelius we find out that they were all kind of ant and there was an unclean bird and one decision was translated God told him the gentle that you Jews were calling uncleanly I am calling them that they are not clear they are not unclean but they are now clean and brother branham explained to us that he was speaking about the gentle so that was showing right here that there will come a time when the Ministry of Elijah will have an interaction the spirit of Elijah will have a connection not with the Jews but with the gentle everybody clear that's a recapitulation the first Elijah do they second a Jew they herded you they fear a Jew but the fourth one shota everybody clear now when we look after Raja finish the ministry God told him go leave Israel either go to the shelter go to Cerreta and there you will find that there is we Roman the widow woman was not a Jew she was a gentle brother branham how that this lead woman must have been of the calibre of Elijah let's do a little surgery this woman that call her woman is a delta and this is a larger medicine illogical that you but brother branham say when this term of the Ministry of Elijah when discerned into this woman larger there interacted with this woman helped the same caliber they are the same nature this is a gentlewoman so this a larger must be also a gentle slowly because usually your action shows what you are your works and again she has been chosen to entertain God's prophet but random now is underlining something he said remember she was in other word that Elijah that's going to interact with the woman will be a gentle not their economy is telling you something and the land was burning up Israel was under judgment they're going to reject the Messiah and they're going to be under the curse and then the Messiah will go to the gentle and when the Messiah goes to the gentle by the cross by the two sticks that the human head there will be a spirit of Raja also going over there no doubt Delhi human being of that caliber being over Howard she a gentle and a believer you see now it was Peter look at God he said I cannot eat that it is unclean God said there are which you think is unclean don't call it no more unclean are you there so we see that God will not have called her if she had not been worthy to learn to entertain God's prophet for he would never send his prophet to the house the walls around so when God's to Elijah the Prophet that means you are I will send you Elijah death when they send you Elijah the Prophet it means God look at your DNA God examine you God chosen you and instead you are worthy to entertain Elijah the Prophet in fact taking larger the Prophet and I send him to you you gonna treat him good you going to accept his ministry you can accept this world you wanna take on the seed of Atlanta oh my god it was not his choosing not you it is me sending you Elijah the Prophet it was God's choosing he was not her bidding him she didn't see - she said Elijah come come come no while we were yet sinners Christ died for you he was God bidding he had been placed by a book the Raven were feeding him but he was God command for something to take place and God surely went to a believer of the sermon nature of what so whatever this Elijah is you are on the same nature oh my god what are you talking about if I brought you a Methodist message it would not no effect on you because it is not your nature [Music] you are program for a different message speed the right man with the right message at the right time in order to wake you up this is brighter it's Moses thought the message of North it would not take away if Jesus thought Moses message it would take no effect because the predestinated cedar are laying them that will only only be water by that type of water that is given for the silk trade about the you our work despite the mental disorder you will work but when they sprang and larger the Prophet something work you up he won't grow any other condition it must be the conduct condition to make it grow I will send you Elijah death prophet why is this important if Elijah have the same nature as a woman what is that important there is a teaching in Leviticus 23 that is called the teaching of the word shift make sure you baccala are there when you have a field and in the field you grow you plant train are you there and you are wondering your see those plant will begin to grow those words will begin to grow and come up but there will be one plank in the field that grows quicker than any other place everyone here so that plant will reach maturity quicker before the other one are you there but this plane and this plane the same nature same caliber but one reach maturity first Aveda when we reach maturity first they carry mas and take him to the high priest everybody following me and when the hike will take him the high priests will go to the field and begin to are we following me the working of a multi field means that him him and filled the same nature with which the maturity the same as him with the maturity notice it was the first crown of God which God which there had been raised from the dead God's first corn of wheat by God quickening power God had quicken his life raised him up from the dead talking about Jesus and he was the first fruit of those that slave the first fruit he was that she that is why they had to work that shift so it was the first one that come to maturity and he was worth as a memorial of what Thanksgiving believing that girl the last of them who come who come to work to my children why do you come to maturity because he and larger of the self-nature hallelujah he was worth at the day of pinnacles that's Jesus Christ when they came a son from heaven like a wave that was up at Pentecost waiting for the blessing to come are we clear and to be well again you know why again here he was moved all the Jews everybody but to be well again all the gentle a leader we realized in the last day according they again in the day that the Son of Man will be revealed well again over the people wanna see well because there is a woman on the cell nature on the same caliber that needed maturity now who is the son of man I love brother Branham who is the son of man in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and if all the teaching that we have and confirmation of the world by by Word of God by sons by wonders we see today that in the Book of Luke that was that as we just coded from look the 17th chapter intelligence and Malachi 4 and the different scriptures why different scriptures this just jobs were tunnel vision when the same a wave sheaf chief is a bundle of which it is you with with with with all of them and they banded them together it's a shift it is not one with it is a bundle of scripture either that's why rather Branham use many Scripture look 1730 Malachi 4 revelation 10 Zechariah 14 Eliezer in the book of Genesis he pulled the scripture together and the mayorship of his military either John the Baptist was prophesied by Isaiah but John the Baptist was also prophesied by Malachi so it's a scripture here that's why Jesus when he was on the road to a miles either he begins by Moses and show them that he was the word Shiva he said Moses a job say Abraham say this one say this one this one's Alleluia Malachi 4 and the different scripture that we are acquainted with that word again is worth over there people that the damn tradition of man is dead and the Son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Spirit but among God and is given us life hallelujah really as Christ was the first one to learn from all the profit and so forth although tapped in many places he was the first fruit of those as well with her in the bride indeed filled in this woman either in the broad coming of Christ not the Jews in the broad coming of Christ coming out of the church they came out of the ADEA they are here in the broad field either in the broad coming across coming out of the church - I have to be there is somebody among this week either that is a either there should be a shift to be worth the gamble in the last day oh my waving of the ship what was the ship the first one that come to mature the first one that proved he was a will that prove he was a she hallelujah I am sure you see what I am talking about I am sure you are detecting that the characteristics I am sure you are reading between the lines I am sure you are seeing resulted here because I don't wanna say it friendly they see touch the deform a pick that up I was messin for the seed of the devil our shall send you an alter the process you must read between the rock hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about he was well over the people the first time they will come forth for the brothers for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism came out from Loudoun sir will be a message the message and the messenger are there the four maturity of the world has turned back in its full power bring wealth over the people by the same Sun and one day as I did back there Elijah we have shift this woman same nature same caliber you ready Oh God same sermon hallelujah his God has predestinated for them Church woman in the Bible table for them church he know his God sons and daughters and broad whirring some way he knew there was a widow woman waiting somewhere I will send you Elijah the prophet Elijah will send you a gentle woman are there when the Holy Spirit begin to fly over the wave sheaf oh my is the same yesterday today and forever not some mythical story but air they are the same caliber they are the self what does he mean to you today I worry discomfort is not for the seven church age messenger only everybody there every true believer is in the hand of God that's why you are on the same nature in other day they were the world she was drawing benefit from God it is not a show you need to wake up that I can also do the same thing every true believer is in the hand of God and can draw from his love and power and we see the foo-foo-foo-foo Queen answer ask which one in which half of the kingdom under the full benefit of all that God is to the believers what God gives them and how he blesses and uses death messenger is me example so when you read brother branham praying for somebody remember it is an example the 12 jesus said the work that I do we're just example for you to do the same thing what God gives the message how he blesses and uses the messenger it is a example to all believers of His goodness and care to all member oh please I will send you the right order let's go to first Kings chapter 17 brother John am i okay I'm not even and a half but let me know it's Father's Day you gotta let fathers go eat food everybody there you there or you tired first Kings chapter 17 verse 10 he's talking about this woman and so he arose and went to zurafa tarifa and when he came to the gate of the city behold the woman was there gathering of sticks and he call her and say bring me appeal a leader what it's only a few people a little water why did he'll ask for water why did he ask for order when Eliezer met Rebecca worried I asked Rebecca are we clear are we clear when Jesus met the woman of the world what did he ask the woman what is it was a and when a large approaches this woman he has fought and brother branham's told us that in John chapter 4 was the version of the second pool the first Ministry of Elijah is entertaining with club bringing him bread and flesh either then he moves to a different step of his ministry and he begin to approach the ministry with the second pool okay bring me what water in a vessel that are may drink let's go to verse 11 and as she was going to bring it he called to her and say bring me I pray you a morsel of wood bread now first of all Elijah guy used to brain he was eating bread and flesh but when he approached the woman bring me water the woman wanna move he said bring me bread now if you recall when the crew were bringing Elijah bread they were bringing him bread and meat okay but there is a difference brother Branham call that a sandwich but there is a difference between the savage of Elijah and our sandwich the sandwich of a Naja has bread and flesh or meat our servants have bread lettuce tomatoes - or buttermilk because all kind of stuff but a larger sandwich is bread and in flesh bodies bread I want to save you time there was a woman you can write it down a self initial woman that approaches Jesus Christ and was crying son of man son of David son of David and Jesus keep working when he says son of God Jesus stop because she lined up correctly with the scripture and when Jesus went around say what do you want my daughter is sick I want you to hear Jesus said it is not good to take the children's bread and give it to the dog so Jesus identified they bread as divine healing the valley healing was the children's bread yet I would not pay attention no attention to her he ignore him and finally she got in her way and could not get around her and he told her say I'm not saying to you he always and 2-year in your way is nothing but a bunch of dogs and I'm now going to take the children's bread it's not right for me to take the children's bread healing to this group and give a gooda the first interaction of the spirit of Elijah with the gentle it is going to be entertained by divine healing everybody there because Malachi for say the Sun of righteousness he is going to rise up wilfer healing are you no are you no but the healing is couple with me are you there it is the first school everybody jesus said except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man are you there that's why you notice brother branham at the beginning of his ministry he was more healing and preaching healing and preaching dragon meat bread and meat bread and meat the people of bread divine healing but they didn't want the meat other and Jesus say not except you eat bread but except you ate the flesh of the Son of Man and you also drink is in other word this flesh must be covered with blood it is a pretty flesh a breeding water if you don't get done you are not worthy how can we eat flesh and blood did you ever seen people eating flesh and blood do you know who eat flesh and blood do you know do you want me to show you do you wanna see that in the scripture do you wanna see that in the scripture can we vote take your Bible number chapter 23 keep first being 17 also I'm gonna let me know buddy John number tapped at 17 chapter took me three I'm sorry numbers chapter 23 are you their number such after turning three hurts 23 everybody there everybody there I surely there is no enchantment against Jacob neither is there any divination against Israel according to this time it shall be of Jacob in Israel what get what God wrote everybody they behold the people shall rise up as great word eye on everybody clear as great lion and lift up himself as young lion he shall not lie down we know lion eat meat he shall not write down until he eat of the prey eating meat and what drink the blood of their so the animal does eat flesh and drink blood is who let's go to the book of Job everybody their job is before so on job 39 job chapter 39 verse 27 everybody turning pages everybody there everybody their job to 139 verse 27 does they want ego I thought he was only alive does there he go Monta patio commend and make her

what were the choruses that were there either and suck up the blood and we're thus learner there she were the carcasses dare she so the lion and the ego both intimate and drink and we know that Paul was a prophet and Paul was under the anointing of L everybody here and rather brand among the internals and you are rather the unknown to your faith the mystery of Billy Paul the Apostle Paul and Billy brother branham your lion and ego it's a prophetic anointing are you there and in Revelation 10 when the manager comes down he's rolling again like a and on his heart and he has a little book to open and that book was the Word of God and when the grand-am expanded the Word of God was the very gene of God the lion Leo Leo engine working in tips Leo and Jean working in tips yet both of them were homosexual because Luke 1713 said as he was in the dagger of Sodom the word coming down they seed coming like environment and the environment of Sodom homosexuality is wrong but the prophecy must be fulfilled Leo and Gina but sodomite that's why when the servant seal was to the Jews it is called the seventh trumpet and the Bible said Moses and Elijah will be killed in the great city that is spiritually called Sodom rather say give me water and the woman reply I have a cake enlarges a bread the woman say cake Prabhavati and that cake the woman said I have a handful of meal and then of all what is Vera Branham saying he say now the meal all those things has a meaning men represented Christ what was the me lovely when they grabbed a meal for the wave offering for Christ which was Christ in a wave offering in the Old Testament they granted with a certain type of birth but every little piece of meal must be cut just the same because Jesus Christ is the same yeah stay there so that woman has a meal that was granted and the same way she was carrying the Deemer of Jesus Christ being the same yesterday today and forever what are you trying to say now just before we start praying for the sick I certainly covet your prayers of all of you with me for midnight I want to take the regular theme of my campaign always people happy men a large Alpha Delta must carry the people must carry the middle of the woman he must carry the team all the time that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and that is the team that we use our subject tonight is the resurrected Lord Jesus it's kind of a basic theme for our campaign is dealing with the gentle they must be the meal offering granted together and why brother Branham which more than anything else Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever identify Elijah by his characteristic that he is the same in principle the same in love the same in power the same all just exactly the same he said in his church she carried acoustics which we know it's the cross already preaching and then later on Elijah the woman have a baby dad died and when the baby died they brought the baby to Imagi are we there Elijah that dealt with the gentlewoman when they brought the baby to him in order to resurrect that baby Elijah claim on the baby he put his mouth to the mouth baby he does to the baby's eyes he lies upon the baby and the baby resurrected if the larger that work with the gentle crammed on somebody to bring them to life God is still the same yesterday today and forever that's not change buckle up a brother Alec was laying there dead we have been very good buddies a friend of brother branham bed fish on the river you know how we dig so much together and he got hurt out there a railroad riding the spider well imagine his longing he was bleeding he bled and took TBM I start to move away this way where the random went to the hospital and brother branham beat him to go then I felt the hand again the angel of the Lord put a hand on brother branham like you cannot go remember you are Elijah the prophet we had the dead person there a turn back he would not get off of me in other word God hold him like you must go back I left and before I know what I was doing under the anointing brother Branham lost would control of himself because the man was bleeding blood all over and he was dead with blood all of it and God look he say if he goes with his right man he is going to run away let me take his mind away Selena not unto their own understanding then brother branham lost his GPS and the Holy Spirit took the GPS and begin to direct him and why they all agrees the what did the Holy Spirit to do to him I was laying on top of them with my lips against his lips I was as bloody as he was laying there on darlin crying out to God and I felt something come up around my ear he was his hand brother branham learning about him put his foot put his mouth against his MA and before you know it is a billy already resurrected you have read instant here and testify of faith right why because a larger entertaining the gentlewoman much bring a resurrection but not only one there was a boy in Finland who
