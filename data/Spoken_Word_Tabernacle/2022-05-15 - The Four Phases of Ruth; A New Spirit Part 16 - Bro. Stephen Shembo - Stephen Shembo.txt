yes before somebody shoots you a text hallelujah let's go to ezekiel chapter 36 my friend on the computer stay tuned if you pray throughout the week and you pray before coming to church you will see how the holy ghost work in everything you will see the song service blending with the special the special blending with the sermon and even the one who work on the computer the holy spirit will take over you you will see those slide blending because everything is orchestrated by the holy ghost if somebody didn't pray you will feel it like somebody's dragging and now they have to push and pump somebody that's not good ezekiel chapter 36 verse 23 if you dare you can say amen blessed be the name of the lord yep i will sanctify my great name which was profane among the hidden we're still dealing with this which you have profane in the midst of them and the hidden shall know that i am the lord say the lord god when i shall be sanctified in you before their eyes you might be seated for i will take you from among the hidden you understand this language now and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land then we last sprinkle clean water i want you to remember again that clean water you already know about the fission the washing of the water by the word right back here i will sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness because you still something you are justified and from all your adults which are cleansed will i cleanse you a new heart you already understand this now also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of you out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of flesh and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statute and you shall keep my judgment and do them ever care there are three steps here very important the first one is a new heart where does a new heart happen everybody care which is in the outer court and the second one is a new spirit where does a new spirit happen in a holy place here and the third one is my spirit which is the holy spirit which happened in the holiest everybody cares so far blessed be the name of the lord let's go to romans 6. lord help me because we got to deliver this again we stopped last sunday on how to get sanctified we got to know that amen verse 11. if you dare you can say amen likewise you reckon you remember this last sunday reckon you also yourself to be dead indeed to sin anybody care but alive to god through jesus christ our lord our lord let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body sin is somewhere but do not let that scene rain everybody because before sin was raining was ruling you now that you went through the bar through the brazen altar no more let that sin rule amen that you should obey it in the last thereof there are passions desire neither yield your members as instrument of unrighteousness to sin we see the verb there that was obeyed and we seen the yielding you remember that and then we are servants that was last sunday amen but yield yourself to god verse 13 as those that are alive from the dead you were dead before in your sin and trespasses and your members as instrument of righteousness to god ever care because your body is a billboard your body is a billboard do you know what a billboard is do you see when you go on 85 you see the sound that say mcdonald's here that's a billboard your body is a billboard in other words your body gives information it's telling people something anybody care verse 14 for sin shall not have dominion or control over you for you are not under the law everybody here but underwater the covenant changed i hope you're alive lord help me what then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace calvin did you see calvin there because we are on the grass let's go ahead and sing calvinism so paul is warning you be careful of calvin right here in other words you already been justified in the other court be careful calvin is here calvin is because grace is there let's go ahead and leave any kind of way we already said by grace god forbid because that's confidence anybody verse 16 know ye not that to whom you yield yourself servant to obey his servant you are to whom you obey whether of sin to death or of obedience to righteousness but god be thanked that you were the servant of sin that was before karma but you have obeyed from the heart at the brazen altar that form of doctrine which was delivered to you somebody preached to you now after the bears and altar verse 18 being then made free from sin you gave your life to christ you became servant down to water now you're moving as a servant forward hey mark here i speak after the manner of man because of the infirmity of your flesh the snake is still there for as you have yielded your member servant to uncleanness and to iniquity to iniquity even so yield your member servant to righteousness to water this is the result you're going to be holy to your sanctification everybody clear so far job 2 verse 22 but now being made free from sin and become servant to god you have your fruit onto water that's the result and the end everlasting water then you get into the holiest in other words once you move from the other court you go as a servant to the holy place and from the holy place you go to the holiest there you get the baptism of the holy spirit everybody cares so far let's go to hebrew 10 and then we pray i took a little bit of time on the announcement so be gracious to me so we can deliver this cargo these stuff are very very important we have been confused a long time in the message but the time of confusion is over amen if you dare you can say amen verse 16 this is the covenant you remember this that i will make with them after those days say the lord the lord i will put my law you remember that into the heart not a stony heart now because you are born with a stony heart you remember that a heart of flesh and in their minds will i write them can you give me a little bit brother david and the sins and iniquity will i remember no more you cross the brazen altar god take everything and put them into the sea of god forgetfulness your sins only your iniquity everything that you've done god wipe it if you ask god after the present altar where is my sin god doesn't know where they are if you ask your neighbor they can remember everything that you need in the neighborhood not god but i don't care what my neighbor think as long as everything is good with god everybody clear verse 18 now where remission of of this is remission of sin there is no more offering for water because now we're dealing with the cross one time the offering is made it's over by christ verse 19 having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus christ by a new and living way which he has consecrated for us he has prepared for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having a high priest over the house of god let me stop here so you understand what you're reading this is the tabernacle again everybody here we got the outer court we got the holy place we got the ark of the covenant here hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord let me go slowly we got the ark of the covenant here with the kerry beams right here over here you got the altar over here you got the table of the showbread you got the candlestick right here everybody here we got the liver here and we got the brazen altar here everybody here paul is saying that you came here and god removed everything every sin in your life and put it in the sea of god forgetfulness everything is forsaken everybody now paul is telling you that there is a high priest his name is jesus christ that high priest already opened your way right here back here that's why he say and then you don't have to be afraid you must have boldness to approach now this place this place when you were approaching that before it was something scary because you can get killed everybody but today staying outside of this place you can get killed on the outside everybody so paul is saying that we have now baldness to enter into the holiest right here everybody here by the blood of jesus christ because jesus already prepared a way through his flesh the um the veil of the temple already was whipped into we can enter but you can never enter this holiest here with our first passing through the holy place now this is what paul is saying here now let's drop to verse 22. you are at the present altar paul is talking to you paul is telling you that your end your finality is the holiest because jesus already opened the way but here you're not there yet you are still on the other court but i'm going to give you instruction how to go now through the holy place everybody this is the instruction verse 22. let us draw near you see now paul is standing he told you you are right here there is a place here but i want you now to come closer in other words move forward everybody here let us join near with a true heart because your heart is already changing everybody okay you already got a new heart here you remember you remember you gotta have sincerity joy with a new heart in full assurance of faith having our heart sprinkle from water that's what happened at your presentation everybody here come on and our body washed with water pure water verse 23 let us do water hold fast water remember what happened at the present altar keep it close with you don't forget what you spoke at the present order in other words do not forget the day that you give your life to jesus christ remember the decision you taught jesus christ hold first to that decision because you're gonna get into some shaky water so every time the devil shake you remember i already met him at the brazen altar i already confessed my sin i already professed that i'm a christian i am not turning back everybody cares so far he continued he said let us hold fast the profession of our faith you did it at the brazen altar without water anybody okay without wavering for his faithful da promise everybody here verse 24 and let us consider one another to provoke to love and to good water so you already been dealt with here your end result is here we want you to draw near when you draw near always keep your salvation here as you're moving forward everybody care so far let's go ahead and pray now heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly father this morning thanking you for your grace for your love for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we have done what any man that you give ability to do can do it is just lord to read the scripture but when he comes to interpret that scripture and to give a revelation and bless your children he only take the supernatural work of the holy spirit that's why i pray father that you move me completely assad may you come down and speak to your children bless this church and those that are streaming may you remove every demonic spirit everything that is contrary to your word may you move it completely away from this place may every spirit of sleepness or destruction be completely off this place but may the holy spirit have freedom this morning to talk to heart to heart lord father and that the people will leave from this place different than the way they came in we commit and we ask everything in the name of jesus christ amen blessed be the name of the lord the bible says in hebrews 13 verse 12 wherefore jesus also that he must sanctify the people with his own blood sanctification happened with the blood of jesus christ everybody here so far now my subject this morning [Music] is the four phases of roof a new spirit the new spirit happened where in a holy place hey back here so we're dealing with roof following the maiden roof dealing with the table of the showbread and under that we're still in the holy place which is dealing with wesley everybody so far in our language tabernacle here we are with roof in the holy place this is where we place roof which is this gentle blood that is moving forward to receive rest and later on being rewarded with the rapture hey but here when we started this journey in the middle of faith we included ezekiel hey but here by including ezekiel we inserted the new heart you ready on the computer the new spirit uh back here and my spirit which is the holy spirit the new heart happened in the other court the new spirit happened in a holy place and the holy spirit happened in the holiest of all everybody here now how do you read the tabernacle as a summary before we move on number one roof is in the other court everybody here roof in the other court this is our way the way our reading goes roof first of all is in the other court anybody care roof in the other court means roof is deciding are we clear there roof deciding how do you decide you decide at the present although everybody care where you give your life to jesus christ hey mark here this decision here have three components to it there is a time of decision there is a power of decision and there is a result of decision brother branham preached the time of decision brother want to preached the power of decision and brother branham preached the result of decision there is a time in your life that you must come and make contact with jesus christ as the perfect atonement for your salvation everybody here that time and the experience that will happen at the president got power to change you everybody here so far and when the changes happen it doesn't happen outside it is a change that happened inside of you and the result will follow ladder everybody cares so far so roof deciding after she decides she is justified everybody there has roof under justification everybody here so far everybody cares so far this justification gives you a new heart everybody here so far this is the message of luther everybody here any deviation for luther any relaxation from luther will bring you to coven roof in the other court deciding at the present altar after decision she is justified and she moves into the level to be baptized and when she is baptized she's showing outside people that she has already made a decision inwardly with her lord and that experience gives you a new heart which is the message of luther and any deviation give you calvin this is your first reading any questions so far we're clear number two we got roof in the holy place roof in the holy place means what according to hebrew chapter 9 verse 1 the bible say that then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine services and a worldly sanctuary for there was the tabernacle made the first tabernacle which we know paul called that the holy place wherein was the candlestick the table and the showbread which is called the sanctuary now when these things were that's or then the who so when you finish your present although ever here you are entering this presentator not under the levitical priesthood you are entering that you are entering this present altar under the melchizedek priesthood because the mercury that priesthood make you priest and water and king so you are entering the holy place as a priest everybody here as a priest to do service unto the lord that's why roof is laboring i'm helping you to summarize everything we started up to this point so we can move forward but here it is roof that is surfing ever here this serving of roof when she enter she first meet the candlestick and it's very important to meet the candlestick because the candlestick will give you the absolute amount [Applause] [Music] hallelujah he said the priest went always into the first tabernacle accomplishing the water so you are entering the holy place for service as a servant of god roof serving and you need to go first at the candlestick to get your absolute for your edge hallelujah what are we talking about brother branham say i am not trying to absorb authority or something like that but you see a man or anything with two heads he doesn't know how to go you cannot have two head pastor in one church everybody okay you cannot have a committee directing a church anybody okay so far because when you got two heads or seven heads like the beast in revelation you don't know which direction you're going god is one god here your israel the lord your god is water brother bonham say god never did had two heads to his church he never did it's only he always dealt in every generation as i have studied through the scripture there is always one individual that he deal with because when you get to man you get water and it's got to come to one final water and my absolute is the water the world which is water [Music] everybody okay so far i'm gonna rock you up a little bit and as a pastor here of the church my absolute is the water and i know you our brother you kinda look to me to be your water everybody okay everybody okay so far the baba is your absolute but for your age your messenger do you follow me your messenger is your absolute [Music] why is a messenger an absolute everybody okay so far everybody okay so far are you all right why is the past why is the messenger in absolute he said i to be your absolute as long as i do whatever [Applause] how many believe brother branham follow christ everybody here so far why because our spouse said the scripture you follow me as a follower brother branham follow jesus christ when paul is following christ and you are following paul you are not really following paul you are following the class that paul followed the messenger is the absolute when he follow christ because now it is no longer the messenger it is crushed in the messenger reflecting his life to the church [Applause] we found out that when a man comes sent from who ordained of who with the true water the message and the messenger are one and the same because jesus is sent to represent the save the lord word by word so he and his message is what [Music] i was trying to spare you that but somebody's struggling somebody's struggling i believe it's 15. brother robert would you help me with that scripture moses is read every sabbath everybody here out to 15 let's go to verse 21. if you dare you can say amen everybody care everybody here i want you to read the word for me for god oh moses was who for moses of all time has in water damn god do what stop where they're preaching moses when you were going to the synagogue did you see them standing and saying moses moses moses moses moses moses go home they were preaching the law [Music] the law of moses ever care about but the bible called that moses not moses the man but moses the prophet more this the lord because the messenger and his message are one and the same that's why brother branham said you are not feeding on the word of amen you are feeding upon the unfailing body world of the water every sabbath they have to read moses on the pulpit so when you come to church they say moses said moses said moses said moses said moses said even when they meet jesus christ they say moses said and in this church brother branham said brother branham said brother branham said hallelujah paul say in romans 2 in the day when god shall judge what the secret of men by whom according to water did paul heard the gospel did paul heard the gospel why did he say my gospel in other words when jesus christ judge you he cannot judge you without me paul that's why when brother branham was up there he said are those of paul gonna enter [Music] i preach like water paul said if they judge you jesus christ judge you he won't judge you without me i have to be there everybody here what is the message of paul and back here first timothy according to the glorious water of the blessed water which was committed to water it is the gospel of god it is the message of god that was given to paul when he comes to paul paul and the message are one that's why paul said if somebody come and preach something different then what me power preaching chase that preacher away everybody here ever hear the candlestick you must go here to find your absolute and your absolute is not a man it is the message of the hour that came through your messenger [Music] and you cannot separate the message from the messenger you bring in confusion [Applause] this is what we believe in this church and it's gonna stay like that until jesus come [Music] hallelujah hallelujah when you enter the holy place you go to the candlestick the candlestick shoots you to the table of the showbread but here when you go interact with the table of the showbread it's going to shoot you to the altar those three interactions sanctify you hence roof under sanctification roof serving roof in the holy place and sanctification give you the new spirit and this is the message of wesley and every deviation from wesley bring you into armenianism second part any question so far three roof in the holiest yes roof in the whole yes she entered how does she enter into the holiest god help me hallelujah he said into the second not the holy place went the water hey nobody could enter this place only the high priest but thank god melchizedek came down in the person of jesus christ and jesus became our high priest and he ripped the veil of the temple that's why paul said come and journey come not fearfully come boldly and enter the holy of holies why because the holy ghost did signify that the way into the holiest of all was what while the first tabernacle was yet water he needed jesus christ over here you're going to meet the ark of the covenant with the caribbeans and with their mercy seat here over here when you interact with the ark of the covenant something will happen to you it will put my spirit this is not the the the restoration of gift but it's the restoration of the person himself of the holy spirit everybody here so far i hope you will get that let's go back to our sermon roof and the new spirit what is going on with a new spirit brother branham says this hallelujah let me drop this before you enter into the holiest ever here you must pass through the holy place in other words there is no shortcut you cannot cross here and enter there ever here you cannot come straight here and enter here you must go through the normal process you must go through the court and then to the holy place and then to the holiest are you okay in other words what your pastor is saying you can never receive the holy ghost if you are not sanctified [Applause] [Music] what about cornelius the bible says this it's justification hey what follow sanctification and what follow the baptism of the holy ghost ever care of the holy ghost in the book of acts chapter 10 verse 22 the bible says cornelius the centurion a whatever any question and one that fear god and for and of a good report among all the nation of the jews was worn from god by an holy angel to send for thee into his house and to hear the words of thee act 10 verse 1 there was a certain man in caesarea called who a centurion of the band called the italian man a water everybody clear any questions so far a devout sanctified man and wonderful god with water cornelius was not the only one sanctified [Music] connections everybody here was sanctified with his house [Music] hallelujah which gave much arm to the people and did what to god water altar of incense anybody okay anybody okay verse 10 chapter 10 verse 24 and tomorrow after they enter into caesarea caesarea and cornelius waited for them and had called to gather his water and near what the king's men of cornelius and their friend work on the friend do you know what he means it means close friend you ready the kingsmen of cornelius and the close friend of cornelius all of them were sanctified [Music] you can never have a friend that doesn't believe like you [Applause] do you hear me young people you can never have a close friend that is not at your level let me repeat it again the friend of cornelius all of them were sanctified why because all of them receive the holy spirit i want to see it that's a deduction let me see if i can see it act 10 verse 15 and the voice speak unto him again the second time what god has wanted that called not the water all of them god gave peter the vision of the house of cornelius and the friend of cornelius and the kingsmen of cornelius when peter looked he thought they were unclean because they were gentle god said all of them are sanctified but here then peter opened his mouth and said of the truth i perceive that god is no respecter of water but in every water he that do water and work of water roof working roof working here so cornelius justify sanctify working already righteousness roof serving everybody okay he's accepted with him brother branham saying jehovah jarrah in the house of cornelius when peter went in and showed him about the vision he saw from the housetop if you know the story peter sin who he seen who and them he seen what all of them were what that was the son of the messiah the resurrection while peter spoke this word the holy ghost fell on water everybody okay ain't it too bad today that our heart our what [Music] the hearts tony you are still outside so brother branham is telling you that cornelius and his friend already have a new heart anybody okay a stoney heart can we tender ourself up because with a stony heart there is no way you can move with god god have to put his law but he need the heart of the flesh and cornelius was justified sanctify that's why as soon as peter spoke the holy ghost fell my message what i'm trying to tell you you can never receive the holy ghost if your life is not clean [Music] they are not lost you are not lost you are saved certainly sanctification is the same work of grace the same the same grace that save you jesus said no man can come to me except my father joseph it is the holy spirit all along but that is a portion of the holy spirit this is a water of the water sanctification is the biggest portion of the holy spirit it is bigger than the other coat that's why sanctification most of the time is mistaken to the baptism of the holy ghost that's where message believer are stuck in let's see what's going on you ready whether you are born in a message or outside of the message you must enter by one gate brother kelly you must meet jesus christ at the cross you follow me because all both of you your heart are bad everybody here after the present hunter you change and you receive a what a new heart listen to me carefully the one who comes from the world has an easy way to see a change because they were filthy they were smoking they were drinking they were wearing paint they were wearing shorts they were at the beach with bathing suit all kind of tight and everything they can tell quickly that something changed everybody here if somebody never believed the message before when they come through the message and they give their life to jesus christ you can tell quickly that's that person changed amen because that person would take earring off that person would take one makeup off that person would take the pants off that person would keep uh change their haircut they would stop smoking all those stuff the change is they themselves can tell that i was bad now i'm changing and those people have an easy road to move quickly to the holy ghost ever here the biggest trouble is the one who was born in the message [Applause] never smoke never smell a nightclub never drunk any beer or whiskey was never in a movie theater [Music] what is happening there is two form of sanctification [Music] thank you there is sanctification by training i hope everybody is awake all sanctification by learning and there is a sanctification by experience with the holy spirit amen everybody here so far sanctification by training is what happened to message children everybody here you are sanctified not by god the bible said bring up a child in the way that he should go so you are sanctified by the training of your parents everybody your parents sanctified the outside of you your parents touch you since you are a child don't worry pants your parents said you cannot pinch your ear your parents said we don't go to the movie theater but here everything to you came as a lawyer are you following me it is a school master that will lead you to christ do you follow me your father didn't mean hormone mama didn't mean harm they were doing the best to keep you away from satan but sometimes you thought they were abusive you interpret them have been too hard [Music] ever here they were trying to block you not to go to the bad road but they have to do it that way you need the download [Applause] do you follow me you needed a mama that tells you you must wake up and go to church it's he was under the law everybody here everybody here you are going to church not because you want to go to church because if you don't go to church you get in trouble with daddy hey but here hey here and your parents did the best without beingness but here they didn't know the difference between westlake and armenian so some went into the extreme and became abusive do you follow me but they didn't mean to abuse you they didn't mean to put you as a prisoner they were trying the best that they can to block you from not going to the bad way not going with the bad friend not getting the bad influence because they already seen things far off but they have to do it by training according to the word of god because the law is a school master that must bring you into what it was the law that brought roof into the field of boaz everybody okay so far are you talking about i was born in a message in acts 22 verse 3 the bible say i am verily a man which i am a jew born in texas a city of water i was born outside of israel once you say that to the jews do you know the law everybody here paul changed he said yet in other words don't start your judgment let me finish yet brought up in this city at the feet of who and thought according to the water of the water the law of the father and was zealous toward water zenos in church paul began to play an instrument paul became a musician in church anybody okay i am persecuted this way unto water binding and delivering into prison both men on water how can you be taught in god and persecute god because when christ meet paul he said paul paul why are you what but paul was taught in the law of christ he was crushed that gave the law ever here here the quickest way for you to understand that you are not born again can i continue the quickest way for you to understand that you never met jesus christ in this message because you were born you have enmity between you and the message [Music] do you follow me when they preach the message on the pulpit the message come to you as something that disturbs you the message comes to you as a law all the time don't do this don't do this don't do this don't do it's too much when your heart thinks like that you have not met jesus christ yet let me repeat it again you were born in a message fine if when you are born in a message if when they preach the message ever here and something in you resent the message you are not under you have not met jesus christ yet another world you and jesus christ you are enemies but here you cannot meet jesus christ and persecute the word made flesh shake your heart when they give you instruction from brother branham how do you react if you relax like huh another lord another lord all the time skirt skirts kurt skirts my skirt is already here i don't see what's the problem the skirt is here they want the skirt to be here you have not met jesus christ here but here but here that's why you have a tendency to fight against the message if they say put the skirt here you will put it here if they say put it here you will see yours goes here don't fool yourself you will see your hand here going this way tomorrow it's this way it's this way it's this way because you have not caught it yet i'm doing this because of daddy because of mommy the message is good but there are certain things in the message i don't want it you are not you have not met jesus christ yet you are just born in a message [Applause] i am trying to help you i'm trying to help you you cannot continue like that everybody here ever here until your father and you have a fight constantly you have a fight with mama mommy's trying to tell you don't dress like that it's not good you are getting upset because you have not met christ at the president yet in this message [Music] i wish the whole church was born here and you will see that you are not even born again what am i saying my manner of life from my water i was born into the message from my youth i know i know the seals are not the trumpet anybody here as long as the trumpet don't rob you you good if they start rubbing you you react you are in enmity with the message that's why anything that will shake you away from the message when you leave the message you put don't be surprised somebody left the message and they're wearing paint they were not they never met jesus christ before you gave them the holy ghost you are the one that gave them the holy ghost they didn't have the holy ghost amen you met them at the church 40 years that's the way they dress but they never sat and take a decision and right here they were sanctified by training and learning that he was under the law he was heavy they need just one quote when brother branham said a sister second way a little tight oh they will jump on that everybody here [Laughter] my money of life from my wife which was at first among my own mission at jerusalem known on water everybody knows you you were born in a message these people believe the message but here which knew me from the beginning if they would testify that after the mosque of our water training sanctification by training is religion that's what paul have anybody here straight paul everything straight if you look at paul he looks like he doesn't have any sin let's see if paul doesn't have any sin i leave a pharisee brother uh the bible continues i thank christ jesus our lord who has enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry who was before a what how can a man that was born in the jewish religion taught a jewish religion at the straightest sect pharisee of the pharisee under gamaliel a good teacher but paul found out that he was a blasphemer karma and a water karma and the water if you met paul you would have given paul the holy ghost because he was born into it but paul figured out when he met christ that no i was a blasphemer i was bad i was as bad as the drunker at the nightclub everybody here i persecuted but i obtained mercy because i did it hell in what how can paul be trained in the law and yet have unbelief born in the law grew in the law trained in the law under a great teacher in the law yet unbelief and belief means paul was a sinner that's why you can be born in this message and they can train you sanctify you by training by learning by religion but you're still a sinner a sinner the way you will see it look your disposition with the message you will see that once in a while you and the message you bap you you you bad heads i'm going slowly everybody here the grace of our lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love with which is in jesus christ this is a faithful saying and worthy of all water that christ jesus came into the world to save who of whom i am water [Music] if they take you to the life of power you won't find anything wrong but paul said i was not only a sinner in other words when you see the gangster on the street ever here and they're going with the bike and all the hell hanging out the top chief per se even though i look clean i was like that person already but sitting under religion so the problem is the one who was born here ever here usually is sanctified by the training of the father or the parent but here but he's still as filthy as the one that came from the street about here and this person has a tendency to think that he doesn't have anything to do anymore [Music] everybody here when a sinner come in the church oh and now the young people come in the church he's quick to tell her she's not dressing well she's not doing well in other words she's good she can point the other one she can see the stuff that is in the somebody's eye but she cannot see on her own everybody okay everybody okay but the one that come here would turn around and say i was smoking i don't smoke anymore and that person have a tendency to to move that's why brother branham said even in the praying line a prostitute will come and get healed quickly than somebody who was in the church what i'm saying is what forget about your birth your mommy your daddy was in the message or not in the message forget about that check yourself and examine yourself what is your disposition toward the way toward the message he will tell you whether you already made a decision with christ or not if not you're gonna spin around in this church for so long what am i saying then if sanctification that was by training or learning but there is another sanctification which is the sanctification by experience what is that sanctification remember here the bible uh brother branham say as many as i love i rebuke and trust him be this is the same message that john had uh had as he cried out to that religious with uh uh wilderness of pharisee and sadducee and hidden telling them pharisees knew the law sadducee knew the law the difference between them was in doctrine let me put it home pharisee is a message believer did you hear me a sort of a message believer sadducee is another form of message believer the difference between them is their doctrine one belief jesus already come one say he doesn't come one believe the thunder one believe the return ministry that's the difference between them everybody okay so brother branham is telling you that the message of john was with the people the religious people and the different doctrine and the hidden who didn't know anything the person born in the religion and the person from the street but all of them repent i was born under a return ministry church repent i was born under dignity that believed god was made flesh repent i was born under the thunder movement repent i was born under jesus is coming three times repent i was born in the ghetto repent there was nobody cause them there is no other course now there was no other way to get back to god and there is no other way now it is what change your what do whatever check how you bad heads with the messenger so you gotta repent means you gotta change your heart toward the message because you are batting against jesus christ but here paul the bible says this we're moving to the candlestick let's take ephesians 4. hallelujah i'm trying to run quickly because many that are born in the message give themself the holy ghost and they give other people the holy ghost and the people that they think they have the holy ghost are the people that deal good with them that's a good sister she has the holy ghost the day that she said her bad heads that sister doesn't have the holy ghost anymore let's go to ephesian four if you dare you can say amen i hope it's helping you this is not a transfer from an old church to this and we continue you come from the old church we stop we need to check the host we need to evaluate everything because we don't want again to go through what we went amen everybody here 17 amen this i say therefore and testify in the lord that you here after everybody walk not as other gentile work in the vanity of the water from now on you came from the present altar do not walk like gentle again how do gentle walk verse 18 having the understanding water darken yeah it's there having the understanding darken being alienated from the life of god through their water remember paul said he was also ignorant said there is an ignorance under religion and there is an ignorance under hedonism both of you need to repent but here through ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of the heart who being past feeling have given themselves over to lasciviousness all kind of sensuality and work all uncleanness with greediness they still want to do something bad but you have not so do what paul is telling you now this is not the way you learn christ you just give your life to christ at the altar you cannot continue like the way you did don't continue like that you don't do that to christ this is the way you deal with christ how do you deal with christ if verse 21 if if so be that you have heard him and have been water taught by him as the truth is in jesus that you pulled off concerning the former what that word conversation means the manner of life the old man that you were before which is corrupt according to the deceitfulness according to the deceitful last and be what into the water of your water paul is saying you have passed the president everybody do not leave again like you were outside but here your next step you need to be with you are you following me in your water you need to have a new spirit you already got a new heart don't do again the things that you were doing before but remember your next step you need a new spirit everybody okay verse 20 verse 23 and be renewed in your spirit no more in your heart be renewing your spirit in the spirit of your mind verse 24 and that after you are renewed in the spirit and that you put the water you cannot put the new man without the new spirit do you follow me watch the board you cannot put the new man the holy ghost is a person you cannot put the new man without the new spirit paul is saying you already got a new heart you need to receive a new spirit and once you receive the new spirit then you can put on the new man that new man is how verse 24 and that you put on the new man kama which is after who is what it's a man that have been created you are now converted back here that is created in righteousness and in true water in other words you can never receive the holy ghost if you have not first received a new spirit what are you trying to say brother stephen this is what i'm trying to say brother branham say when we enter sanctification he said the next step she had to do she had to do water she become a water not the law of moses but the law of christ and but here she had to work out her own salvation with fear and water as you did she was trying to find favor with boaz so she worked her way through the stage of water roof under sanctification laboring means water how do you get sanctified this is it now elect according to the full knowledge of god the father through sanctification of water not sanctification by training or learning or religion now with sanctification by there which is sanctification by an experience how do you get sanctified sanctification by the spirit onto obedience remember the word obey right there and sprinkling of the water the blood is the word which is washing you how do you get sanctified you go to the uh uh table of the showbread we talk about the showbread having the frankincense you remember now right this is where we stopped last week what is the work that you have to do as roof laboring roof under sanctification roof being legalistic work on the work brother branham said work is first expressed you remember this everybody here what show that faith has already worked works is showing you that the faith that started at the president everybody here is working in other words if you don't produce work hey mark here you what you did at the president did not work do you follow me again do you follow me again if you give your life to jesus christ and you try to move forward and you don't see any changes in your life something is wrong where you started because when you take a decision there is a power with that decision everybody okay so far brother branham continue he says shows that faith has already took a hold we talked about rahab who believed and she produced work what is work you ready grace everybody okay is what god did for me i want you to listen closely i'm still good in time in case you are wondering anybody here grace is what god did for me grace is your breast and altar ever you didn't die for your somebody died for you hey somebody went to calvary they spit on somebody they didn't spit on you they beat somebody they didn't beat you christ did all the package he did it for you that is grace ever here you have nothing to do inside of there jesus never told you to come be included he never told you to go at the cross with you he never told you to be whipped he didn't tell you anything he started and he finished it without you that's grace everybody okay what is work the first definition of work we found out that it was faith expressed anybody here the second definition of work is what work is what i do for god what you do for god anybody care what how do you do it now they shall make a doctrine out of it brother branham is catching you because by default man always tried to do something when adam fell the first thing he tried to do something god said take your hand off take your hand off of them this is what i gave you in the old testament you made a mess take your hand off you ended up with pharisees sadducee herod take your hand off number one remember i did everything for you keep that in mind number two you gotta do something how do you do it and what is the benefit of doing it and what does it do in your life are you ready they shall make a doctrine out of it they think that work is what wins your water if it is it is not a water this work you are not doing it to gain something are we okay remember i told you there is hell there is heaven there is punishment you remember that and there is reward ever here if you do work to win heaven wrong i'm going slowly if you do work because you are afraid you will go to hell wrong if you do work because you want to get a reward from god wrong if you do work because if i don't give that i'm going to get whip wrong you better keep your thoughts and god will whip you anyway everybody okay everybody okay you do it not to marry something but how do i do it without meriting in other words you are doing this are selfish help me brother stephen grace is what god did for you by yourself and work is what you do in appreciation of the grace that he showed you that's why paul keeps saying as you moving keep your profession remember your profession in other words never lose the sight of the present altar of that day that you give your life to jesus christ but here whatever you do i'm doing it because of what he did for me i was a bad man i was casting everybody i could not tolerate everybody i was somebody that nobody could even approach i was a nobody but because of jesus christ i am what i am and because of what he did to me in appreciation to that i'm gonna do this period let me continue brother of adam say work is what you do in appreciation of the grace that he showed you if you do what you like to do the work of who take your bible so he help you here get mark chapter 12. so this will sink in because this is a very fine line that if you don't pay attention you will find yourself in armenia and then you begin to boast we don't wear those kind of dresses like that have you heard that before somebody's boasting their holiness everybody here they're boasting their holiness right let me leave it alone let's go to verse mark 12 28. if you're there you can say amen you there and one of this crap came as having heard them reasoning together and perceiving that he answered them well ask him which is the first commandment of all i read you some other places but not this one and jesus answered him to the best of my knowledge the first of all the commandment is heal o israel the lord your god is water and you shall love the lord your god with all your karma with all your come out with all your karma with all your this is the first commandment and the second is like you remember this namely this you shall love your neighbor as yourself there is no other commandment greater than what you remember this watch the next verse and the scrub said to him well master you have said the truth for there is no one god and there is no other but he you can make jews swallow three gods verse 33 and to love him everybody okay with all the heart with all the understanding brother robin and with all the soul and with all the strength and to love his neighbor he's summarizing what jesus told him amen and with all and to love his neighbor as himself watch what jesus didn't give him but he caught it by revelation watch that because everybody heard it but what they were looking for give us one commandment and we do it but that one commandment that jesus gave them still had the revelation locked in now the man is unlocking the revelation jesus never told him that it's coming from the man himself ever here watch the revelation is more than all hope burn offering and what did jesus told him that where did he get that watch verse now 34 and when jesus saw that he answered what he said to him you are not what from water because you approach you right here am i here jesus told him what you just say you already right here just a little bit of step buddy you get it anybody everybody so the law that you do is killing it's not something that you are painful to be doing it it's an appreciation you are suffering with a bill i'm just giving an example you went to the hospital you came back five thousand dollars bill you put your hand like this you say my god what can i do they fire you from work you

you didn't do it ever here it is the money that did it do you follow me the money the action that brother kalima did to you in generate the work do you follow me you don't manufacture that work it comes with inspiration no maybe we need to take him to a good restaurant no no no no not a cheap one brother he gave you 5000 in america give him to a good restaurant let him give a good meal let's swap our credit card no problem give him the credit card oh that worked you didn't plan it you didn't figure it out what the the the action brother kalima did to you automatically loads you with work everybody here and when you do work it is not tiresome even if brother can even call he said i'm sorry we are on the traffic do you know how you're going to answer don't worry brother we're still waiting for you [Music] everybody here so far that's the way you do it with god when you remember what he did for you on calvary he took your place he died for you he paid the price he helped you have a job he gave you children he gave you a husband he gave you a pastor he gave you a church when you think about all of that automatically automatically [Music] but here automatically you begin to do work and that burden is not grievous it is light you don't feel like it you even feel like if i can do more everybody here you will never miss shaking brother kalima hands in church [Music] do you know why you know why because that will remain as a memorial everybody okay so far that is the work that you do and because that work is based on what he did that work has a power what is the power everybody okay so far hallelujah and if you love him you do the work of the lord certainly because you do what what is work hallelujah oh there is so much of this legalism today touch not test not you don't do things legally anybody care don't do this don't do this don't do this they're going to cross the red light because it's too much love everybody here i didn't come to this church tonight legally anybody okay i feel tired i have been nervous i am upset i am wondering about something that is out before me my heart is burning even as much as much till my heart is flattering feels like i don't know chest pain coming up i got cramp pain right at this minute just shooting back and forth up and down there weak nervous trembling catch a hold here and squeeze a little bit north carolina allergies got my toes squealed up in my shoes i felt anything but come down water in other words brother branham have all the right to stay at home correctly brother i'm sinning i'm sneezing i hit my toes it's hurting everything is not going well the first thing you say brother you need to stay home and rest look what brother branham said he said why did that come then after everything that i described you me william branham i'm in church why did i come because i'm a deacon wrong because i'm a trustee wrong because i'm a musician wrong because that one you just want to do work but your mind is not there why did you come brother branham because i love god live or die i must stand here for it's not because i have to i'm helping you to get the legalistic off of you so you don't come to church like mama push you back here he would not care about whether i did or in other words even if i stay home god will understand me [Music] if they give somebody like that he stays home because god will understand you falling on the calvinist anybody here he said he would not care about it whether i did or not if i die i go to heaven anyhow but i'm coming because i love him you serve god because you do what not because you just got to do it because you love him [Applause] [Music] so nobody have to wake you up to go to church [Music] if they still have to push you to go to church you're not where you're supposed to be yet you have not understand what god did for you yet anybody here legalism won't let me do it is because that i know i get punished for doing but the real truth of it is when the love of god comes into your heart till you want to do it that is the truth of it there is to school not all water you got both end like this you got a stake right in the middle what am i doing brother stephen because you would love him so much to think that he loved you so much when you were unlovable and before you had anything to do with it you chose he chose you how could you turn anything down like that why he looks to me like that would just set that would set election so much higher than the law he would he would set he would set legalistic idea why he would just go beyond anything to think that when i was unlovable he loved me and to think when i had nothing i could do about it he picked me up and save me of his grace i surely should be grateful enough to do what to serve him and love him so that is the way we feel about him when we count the blessing water everybody okay so far everybody okay so far everybody okay so far now you notice brother branham said he was tired brother branham said he was nervous but random say he had a heart problem brother branham said he had pain in his back he has pen on his knee what is going on with work when that work come you ready it is usually against your own feelings [Music] do you follow me he won't come when you feel strong do you follow me do you follow me it will come when it's it's like a challenge of your love towards christ everybody do you love me more than high heels [Music] do you love me more than facebook do you love me more than your pant do you love me more than your friend do you love me more than your job do you love me more than your trip everybody here there will be something that when you do this work it's opposing to you it is it is fighting against you anybody okay let me ask you a question how many times you were at home you felt sick before church and you felt like i cannot go to church it happened to how many people how many of you made it to church and after church you are here how many times question who healed you everybody here who make you feel better question who cast that devil away because at home there was a demon you could feel like he hurt you get here dancing you go hey this thing is gone who took the devil away you can remove devil from life without prayer do you get what i'm saying you can remove devil in your life by and water that say and the devil get up everybody so when you coming from the brazen altar you get a new heart but with filthy habit you remember now the way to get rid of those habits is not for you to fight against them do you follow me you don't stand up you stubborn go go in jesus name go in jesus name tomorrow you go back again about here love god [Music] here love god and begin to just do what god is telling you to do in appreciation to him here you will realize those habits one by one are going away why are the habits going away you okay this is what happened when you begin to eat the word as simple as it is to read your bible as simple as it is to listen to the tip as simple as it is to go to church as simple as it seems to obey but here in conjunction with prayer do you follow me this is sanctification this is

good to you even if the day is bad think about what god did for you good father thank you i came from home the children are doing good we praise you for that when you do that what happened to your habit is this everybody okay everybody okay you see your habits still hanging the more you interact you will see one popping the second one pops here after a while don't pay attention to them they will go after a while they go after a while they go after a while they go after what they got the color around you begin to change yes [Applause] [Music] everybody okay so far everybody okay so far until your color will so change everybody here and those habits will go what makes the habit go brother brother i got the slogan do what it is your duty to go think right that is your duty to water and you got to come out how and if you should just try to do what practice the water he shall do what just like water and he shall do it somebody will be taken over don't worry as he's moving the habit have to give away not you taking the habit away hallelujah hallelujah and when the habit take away the atmosphere you have been created you created a chain do you follow me you follow me that chain does something to the snake do you follow me the snake that was activist bound [Music] do you follow me do you follow me brother branham said when they say that the devil will be banned for one thousand years with a chain by the venom said it doesn't mean the angel is coming with a big shed and bandage you know like that that's not the way you do brother branham said it is the chain of circumstances you created an atmosphere around your life until the devil cannot handle that anymore it is an atmosphere that paralyzed the snake follow me carefully brother branham says this oh how we need in jeffersonville thousands of water that is the water thundering out in water and what and what and what walking around in earth today without water yes sir real water that is a thunder against the snake everybody okay the devil don't care how loud you can do what in jesus name in jesus name you're making him stronger everybody the devil don't care how much you can jump how much you can do this or shout but what everybody here is to see what everybody okay a sanctified holy life consecrated to god say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as he can be so the herding of the snake is the life that you are producing as an appreciation to the things god did for you but here as you doing that towards god it is hurting the devil it is in other words you begin to beat the snake you beat the snake you beat the snake you don't beat it like in jesus name in jesus name no because the more you pay attention to him the more he's going to bite you forget about him what did brother branham say brother branham said don't wear a tight dress do i have that dress god i love you so much if this is what you want no problem that dress go to salvation army something say you know you look sexy don't worry don't worry about that person even if the desire is still there because he will try to tell you you say you still have the desire you still longing for that that's not my problem i already did that in obedience period not in feeling in obedience your feeling will not be there when you do it don't focus on the feeling keep focusing on the action you did father i did this not because of me you told me that's why i did it after a while you will hear that voice quieten you have overcome that demon then you move to the next demon then you come to church then he exposed the second one before you know it you find yourself a different person amen and you will look at the same that dress and you say how was i wearing something like this everybody you don't even understand why you change the reason why you begin to question why you change because what happened to you you got a new spirit any question what does the new spirit do now that spirit is not god's spirit that is your spirit god gives you a new spirit then he say i shall put my spirit in you but the thing god has to do is give you anew make your nature a little more and water or he could not even live with you so he has to get you fixed up first before he can come in i will give you a new spirit then you take him anywhere you go all play kind of places he's got to get you fixed so you can entertain him well so you will see a big change happening in you compared to before you begin to love coming to church quickly and you think ah it seems like i got the holy ghost now i don't get upset anymore i don't cast people anymore you just got a new spirit you just completed sanctification let me finish here i got to stop here brother robert you put a new spirit god has to give you a new spirit or you could not even get along with him you can't get along with yourself that all devil spirit that you had in you so he's got to put a new spirit in you so you can get along with his spirit i will put a new spirit in them and i'll put my spirit in them after he has give you a new spirit that is you don't get it confused with god's spirit it is not it is your new spirit so you can get along with them if he ever gives it to you because you are you in your condition never get along you can get along with your wife you can get along with your husband can get along with your neighbor how are you gonna get along with god so he has to give you a new spirit before you can get along with him so he put a new spirit in you then he put his spirit in you give you a new spirit a new what a new what you change on the outside not because you want to please mama not because you want to please brother stephen but because if i come to church they're going to preach against me that's not a anybody here you're doing that in appreciation to what he did for you and when you doing that in appreciation don't pay attention to what you're struggling take your hand on what you're struggling don't handle it obey and yield even if it's hurting leave it alone you will notice afterward it's gone you didn't take it away you didn't master it therefore you know who overcome he will never come back again if every time at the end of the year this is why brother bottom say at the end of the year people turn new pages and they fail because they come they sit down let's sit down me and my wife my wife we live 20 years in marriage you know i did something bad i'm sorry from this day i trust and i will be a good husband after two weeks [Music] they are smiling they know what i'm talking about you're going to have 20 talk on 101 it's still not happening because you're focusing on the wrong thing leave your wife alone go fix yourself leave your wife alone leave daddy alone leave mommy alone go fix yourself with christ once you fix yourself you turn around sometimes you are the one causing the trouble everybody here ever here if not you will have confidence after conference after conference and then tomorrow you fight you fight again because you're focusing on the wrong thing ever here go love christ mama daddy go love christ and come back together back here as long as the habit is taken off here taken off here you get along it was not you it was the habit that was in between you that is bumping your head one to another you are you you you focus about it 20 years you read the book that you bought on amazon how to be good how to be this how to do this how to live a perfect marriage it's not working you have a lot of books like this because you're focusing on the wrong thing how to be a sweet wife you're wasting your time everybody here love christ [Applause] give jesus christ the first place in everything in your life he will put the work in you and when you do the work the demon that has been bothering you one by one will leave you until one of this day you will sit with your husband and you say why were we fighting all the time all the time i'm sorry i didn't understand no demons flew the staff that you came with it from your father that you were born with it from your family don't worry about it they will keep biting you by the bottom they say how can i get away of a stubborn street he said don't pay attention to it do you know that question and answer but i'm saying don't pay attention to it because you're playing with a rattler snake he's

have to let go and the next demon that was there from your child who wrote a birth and it was going with you suddenly they say uh the fire is too much guys we need to get out and before you know it everything is quiet and when somebody look at you you say is this cesare no that is not you what happened to you it is not me there is nothing that i have done is this brother angelo yeah it's me what have you done nothing and you won't have nothing to boast ever here you cannot tell anybody i did this the demon go you will know that you didn't cast the devil you don't know how he left it is not you all the glory goes to [Applause] everybody okay we will dig onto what is the new spirit i have to stop here time is gone amen amen remember you suffered a lot that's why it's important to obey and to yield as simple as the same please obey when you're obeying it's not obeying according to your desire because you still have a snake your desire will be contrary to what they want you to obey in other words what god asks you to do is different than what you want to do you feel tired you want to stay home but god is pulling you to go to church if you obey you get to church that demon will be off you stay home you stay with that pain and that sickness and condemnation come back i wish i have gone to church why did that stay you're going to feel bad plus a demon anybody here amen praise god i'm going to read this brother ebo was stored after the doctor looked at the scan that he had broken his back again 30 minutes later the doctor came back in and said there was no evidence of a broken back they sent him home still in pen but no breakage everybody who did that now when brother able have to come to church in appreciation to the one that prayed that heal his back how many blessings do you have in your life how many times you miss death in a hospital bed how many times people you heard people die with coronavirus there is a whole lot to look at that and because of that god that is giving you the breath of life don't do it because you must do it wrong take your hand off don't pay attention to what's going on don't pay attention to yourself pay attention to the cross and do what they ask you to do obey regardless of how you feel keep obeying that thing will leave you let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again father for your grace for your love and for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we struggle years not even understanding these things sometimes we drop into a channel when we begin to read our bible we begin to pray more and suddenly we see things going we don't even understand and if we would have caught those key quickly we would have removed a lot of stuff off our life and our life would have been painless without much effort without seeing the christian life like it's a burden but the christian life would have become a joy and something that we live for and something that we are father many of the habit have hanged around the people until they got so discouraged because they are reminding them that it seems like there is no progression in their christian life they're still moving up and falling moving up and falling moving up and falling like the man that came to you and you ask him did you give your life to jesus christ and he was talking to you he was talking to the prophet about the cigarette until brother branham turned around and told him forget about the cigarette look into christ and when they baptized the man only a few times brother branham said go buy him a cigarette and put it on his desk he's not going to touch it and that was the end of cigarette nobody cuts the devil but these are laws and keys that you left for your children further so that you can make this labor not a labor of law not a labor of suffering and pain but it's a labor of love where we're working in the field of boars the one who love us the one who understand us the one who told us to go get a drink the one who purposely sent the reapers one after one dropping blessings here and there until we understand that you know what really it's not even a work he just want me to build something that's why he want me to do this because many maidens were laboring in that field roof found them in that field but none of those maidens became the wife of boaz they were stuck into that sanctification they were stuck into that legalistic nobody could progress and they remain maiden workers in the field and roof who came from an outside country only spent a few times with them in the holy place and after a while roof left that field and never came back again to work the other remain maiden roof was the wife of boaz and they were now working for roof father we found many people in this message we found many people in many stages but further this is not the time to get stuck on the stage this is the time that you are calling us to a higher calling where you want us to meet you into the holiest so that further our life will be a life of rest so that we won't have to worry about what next step what to do because it's not us directing our life it is god himself living through his brother and working his good pleasure according to what what he already planned and purpose father may your children be yield may your children father take their hand off and obey may your children give you the preeminence may your children remember that if they got into this message and never even met you or still fasting with the message still fasting with the coat still fasting with the ministry may they take the faces away it's as simple as it is stopping that altar doesn't have to be in church that altar can be in the pig pen the altar can be a home that alter can be in the living room that alter can be on the sideway of the highway we don't have to travel all the way to jerusalem to find that altar because you're the present help in the times of trouble father we can meet you even in a bush we can meet you at the mountain we can go even into a bathroom and sit down and just make a contact with you and that contact will make a difference and from there on lord father we will begin to yield we will begin to obey we will begin to serve you in appreciation to what you have done in our life in appreciation father how can a young sister stand in this country growing and staying years after years without flirting [Music] it is nothing but your grace and we appreciate that lord father there are many things that we can sit and count blessing one by one and we won't even have a time to do all further in appreciation to your protection in appreciation to your blessing in appreciation to the ministry in appreciation to the life the very breath that we're breathing lord we want to live for you we want to obey you may you help us lord yield may you help us obey may you help us surrender may you help us take our hand off and leave everything we're struggling with and focus on the main thing and you will take care of the rest and before you know it we will be undo with a new spirit and ready for the new man and at that point we will be resting waiting for the coming of the lord father we commit everything unto the hand and may you take lord father the word of baptism lord unto the hand and may lord father the holy spirit be available because he's pentecost we don't have to wait your child is obeying because you spoke to him may you also remember what is connected to this blessing because when you enter into the water and when you were coming out of the water the holy spirit came and met you father may you do it again for brother chris in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you church we love you [Music] lord prepare me to be a sanctuary [Music] yes that would be great y'all can make your way out to the baptismal pool [Music] how [Music] r [Music] for you
