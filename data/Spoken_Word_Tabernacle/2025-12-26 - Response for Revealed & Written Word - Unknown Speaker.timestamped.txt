[0:16] more than 5,000 people online. So we
[0:19] want to welcome them also to spoken word
[0:21] tabernacle. We see new subscriber. God
[0:24] richly bless you and welcome to the
[0:27] channel where we believe the message of
[0:30] brother Brandham 100%.
[0:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:36] &gt;&gt; In this church the message and the Bible
[0:39] are
[0:42] &gt;&gt; if you have a problem you see me I will
[0:44] spend time with you and drill that in.
[0:46] Amen. You know, I I I made a mention
[0:50] here because folks are taking my sermon
[0:52] and chopping them,
[0:54] &gt;&gt; slicing them up
[0:56] &gt;&gt; and putting new sermon and everything.
[1:02] &gt;&gt; And one time I even mention here, I say
[1:07] you cannot take the written word
[1:10] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to repeat it again.
[1:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't have time for bickering.
[1:19] &gt;&gt; I seen that in the message all over.
[1:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. The fighting between minister and
[1:26] the back and forth the pingpong. I don't
[1:28] have time for monkey game.
[1:32] Amen. My ministry I'm delivering what
[1:36] the Lord gave me and I keep moving
[1:38] forward.
[1:39] &gt;&gt; That era of fasting whatever I don't
[1:42] have time. So this is the only time I'm
[1:45] going to say something about it and I
[1:46] won't even mind it anymore.
[1:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50] &gt;&gt; You don't take the written word,
[1:53] &gt;&gt; the Bible,
[1:54] &gt;&gt; to challenge the reveal or the word made
[1:58] flesh.
[2:07] &gt;&gt; The person took the quote. Brother
[2:09] Brandham say that you need to check me
[2:11] by the word. We don't need to check
[2:13] brother Brandham by the way.
[2:15] &gt;&gt; The message is already vindicated.
[2:19] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together.
[2:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham took his Bible
[2:23] &gt;&gt; and put it on the pulpit
[2:26] &gt;&gt; in front of preachers
[2:27] &gt;&gt; and told them to come and show one thing
[2:32] &gt;&gt; that he preached that is contrary to
[2:34] that.
[2:35] &gt;&gt; NOBODY SHOWED UP. SO DON'T COME today
[2:40] &gt;&gt; and TRY TO BEGIN TO TELL ME you're going
[2:43] to verify what brother Brandham say.
[2:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47] &gt;&gt; If you can show me the error of brother
[2:50] Brham, who are you?
[2:53] &gt;&gt; So the entire bride need to listen to
[2:55] you
[2:56] &gt;&gt; because you WILL TELL US WHICH PART IS
[2:58] right and which part is wrong. We don't
[3:00] need you.
[3:02] &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE IS VINDICATED.
[3:05] 100%.
[3:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:12] &gt;&gt; The Bible say in the beginning was what?
[3:14] &gt;&gt; The word.
[3:15] &gt;&gt; And the word was with God. And the word
[3:17] was who?
[3:18] &gt;&gt; God.
[3:19] &gt;&gt; And the word was made what?
[3:20] &gt;&gt; Flesh.
[3:21] &gt;&gt; And do you know what the Pharisee did?
[3:23] &gt;&gt; They went to challenge the word made
[3:25] flesh
[3:26] &gt;&gt; by THE LAW. WHEN JESUS HIMSELF WALKS THE
[3:30] WORD
[3:32] &gt;&gt; INSTEAD OF GOING TO JESUS CHRIST AND LET
[3:34] JESUS CHRIST WALK THEM THROUGH THE
[3:36] SCRIPTURE
[3:38] &gt;&gt; LIKE HE DID TO THE TWO DISCIPLE ON THE
[3:41] ROAD TO EMMAS. HE STARTED FROM MOSES ALL
[3:44] THE WAY DOWN
[3:45] &gt;&gt; TO SHOW THEM WHO HE WAS.
[3:48] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[3:50] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? HUMBLE YOURSELF BEFORE
[3:53] BROTHER BRHAM.
[3:54] WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS SOMETHING,
[3:56] SAY AMEN.
[3:58] &gt;&gt; EVEN IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, SAY AMEN.
[4:01] &gt;&gt; THEN THE ANOINTING THAT WAS ON THE
[4:03] PROPHET WILL COME UPON YOU AND WALK YOU
[4:06] THROUGH THE BIBLE AND YOU WILL SAY,
[4:09] "PRAISE THE LORD." NOW I SEE WHAT
[4:11] BROTHER BRAN WAS TALKING ABOUT.
[4:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[4:18] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[4:22] WATCH WHO YOU watching on YouTube.
[4:24] &gt;&gt; I'm going to show you the error of
[4:26] brother Brham. What is error?
[4:28] &gt;&gt; Where were you at?
[4:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham. The angel of the Lord.
[4:33] Maybe you don't understand who brother
[4:36] is. The angel of the Lord touched
[4:38] somebody
[4:40] &gt;&gt; and let and and left an imprint of a
[4:43] hand.
[4:44] &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE HAND OF THE ANGEL OF THE
[4:46] LORD. They took the hand of brother
[4:48] Brana AND THEY PUT THERE AND HE FIT THE
[4:52] HAND.
[4:54] I hope WE TOGETHER. THAT'S WHY THE SWORD
[4:57] OF THE KING FIT HIS HAND.
[5:00] &gt;&gt; NOT YOUR HAND, NOT MY HAND. ONLY THE
[5:04] PROPHET HAND.
[5:10] &gt;&gt; DO YOU SEE MY FACE OVER THERE?
[5:12] &gt;&gt; NO.
[5:13] &gt;&gt; DO YOU SEE MY FACE OVER THERE? DO YOU
[5:15] SEE ANY PREACHER FACE OVER THERE? ONLY
[5:17] ONE VINDICATED BY THE PILLAR OF FIRE.
[5:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[5:26] &gt;&gt; IN THIS CHURCH, WE SAY AMEN.
[5:29] &gt;&gt; WE SHOUT.
[5:30] &gt;&gt; WE JUMP IN THE SPIRIT. WE ARE FREE IN
[5:33] THE SPIRIT.
[5:34] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[5:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[5:36] &gt;&gt; If this message is hard for you to
[5:38] swallow, please, we don't beg people for
[5:41] the message. The predestinated seed, we
[5:44] don't beg them.
[5:45] &gt;&gt; They will stick with THE MESSAGE. IF THE
[5:47] MESSAGE IS TOO HARD FOR YOU, WALK OUT
[5:49] SLOWLY.
[5:51] &gt;&gt; LEAVE US ALONE. BUT AS FOR ME AND THIS
[5:54] CHURCH,
[5:56] THE MESSAGE IS RIGHT.
[5:59] &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE IS 100% LINE UP WITH THE
[6:03] BIBLE.
[6:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[6:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Which Bible did you
[6:12] read?
[6:13] &gt;&gt; When you were reading the Bible, we were
[6:15] all Catholic over there.
[6:17] &gt;&gt; The Catholic got the Bible. The
[6:18] Protestant got the Bible. The Methodist
[6:20] got the Look at the mess where we are
[6:23] &gt;&gt; and God send you a vindicated prophet.
[6:26] &gt;&gt; And the Bible SAY IF A PROPHET says
[6:29] something
[6:30] &gt;&gt; and what he says happen, what do you
[6:32] have to do to that prophet?
[6:34] &gt;&gt; Listen to him.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; LISTEN TO HIM. HOW MANY PROPHECY DID YOU
[6:37] SEE? A WOMAN IN PURPLE. AN AMERICAN
[6:40] POPE. IT'S NOT THAT ENOUGH FOR YOU. HOW
[6:43] MANY PROPHECY DO YOU WANT?
[6:48] &gt;&gt; An American president. Catholic. It
[6:51] happened. Woman in purple. It happened.
[6:53] An American pop. How many prophecy do
[6:55] you still want?
[6:58] &gt;&gt; You still waiting for Los Angeles. H.
[7:00] You will go down with Los Angeles. We
[7:03] are going up.
[7:09] Amen.
[7:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So, this is my last time I'm
[7:14] responding to you. You who put that
[7:16] thing online.
[7:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:19] &gt;&gt; I know what I'm talking about.
[7:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; Never take the Bible and say, "Brother
[7:24] Brandham, show me, show." No, no, no,
[7:26] no, no, no, no, no. If we understand the
[7:28] Bible, my mother look at me, she say,
[7:30] "How where did you learn this Bible like
[7:32] this?" I say, "Bye, brother.
[7:36] Amen. The one who makes me love my Bible
[7:39] is brother Brandham.
[7:40] &gt;&gt; The more I'm I'm listening to brother
[7:42] Brandham, I begin to love my Bible so
[7:45] much and the BIBLE BECAME A NEW BOOK
[7:49] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THE MESSAGE.
[7:55] &gt;&gt; How do you challenge brother?
[7:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[8:01] &gt;&gt; Were you in that cloud?
[8:03] Did they pick you UP
[8:07] &gt;&gt; when you were born? Did somebody come to
[8:09] visit you?
[8:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:17] &gt;&gt; Do you have a name written in seven
[8:19] hills?
[8:22] is your name with ham.
[8:29] &gt;&gt; And the man that CAN TURN THE BACK TO
[8:31] THE CONGREGATION.
[8:36] &gt;&gt; Manifesting who?
[8:41] &gt;&gt; Say it.
[8:42] &gt;&gt; Elohim.
[8:44] &gt;&gt; Elohim.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; Not in the flesh of Jesus Christ. Glory,
[8:52] glory, glory, glory.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; That's why he say he's borrowing my body
[8:55] &gt;&gt; because God could not borrow the body of
[8:57] Jesus Christ.
[8:58] &gt;&gt; The body of Jesus Christ belongs to God.
[9:01] But when he take another body, he's
[9:02] borrowing.
[9:10] &gt;&gt; Play with all the Pentecostal, but don't
[9:12] touch Malachi.
[9:17] Do you know the Jews when you speak
[9:20] about Moses they take
[9:21] &gt;&gt; stone BROTHER
[9:23] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY KNEW WHO MOSES WAS. When
[9:26] the bride will understand, brother
[9:27] Brandham, you won't let anybody COME TO
[9:30] YOUR HOUSE and begin to blabber garbage.
[9:34] I WILL OPEN THE DOOR. I SAY LEAVE RIGHT
[9:37] NOW
[9:38] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU DON'T TOUCH THE PROPHET. YOU
[9:40] DON'T TOUCH A VINDICATED PROPHET FROM
[9:44] ENOCH ALL THE WAY HERE. THERE IS NO ONE
[9:46] LIKE HIM.
[9:48] &gt;&gt; THE ONLY ONE ABOVE HIM IS THE LORD JESUS
[9:50] CHRIST.
[9:55] THE MAN WHO made me love Jesus above
[9:58] everything is brother.
[10:00] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF BROTHER BRANDHAM, I LOVE
[10:02] JESUS AND UNDERSTAND THE DEITY OF JESUS
[10:05] CHRIST.
[10:06] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN I'M WORSHIPING, I'M WORSHIPING
[10:08] IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH BECAUSE THE
[10:10] MESSAGE IS THE TRUTH.
[10:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[10:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[10:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.

[10:22] want to use my name to pick up views,
[10:25] you wasting your time.
[10:27] &gt;&gt; I don't have time for views.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; Keep that unclean money to yourself.
[10:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:37] &gt;&gt; Don't use my name. Unsubscribe. Go
[10:39] somewhere else
[10:41] &gt;&gt; here. Brother Brandham say the Bible say
[10:43] brother Brandham say the Bible say
[10:44] that's how we preach here. The Bible say
[10:46] by the brand I'm saying. The Bible say
[10:48] by the brother say that's how we preach
[10:49] it
[10:50] &gt;&gt; because both of them are one.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[10:54] &gt;&gt; I believe we all up to date with the
[10:56] sermon.
