18th that's our question and answer and then December the 2nd I'm going to correct it again it's not the young men meeting but it's the young Sisters Meeting where we we're going to talk about Finance Finance is the third um aspect or the third element that causes problem in marriages there is three of them we already handled one in church the second one in the meeting the third one we're going to handle that in the meeting if you have those three line up your marriage is already 95% quiet amen you there my brother amen thank you can you say Amen am okay blessed be the name of the Lord I know what I'm talking about yes it's three element if you got those three of three in order that's how you find in marriage if any of the three are is in trouble don't worry M you heard it [Laughter] yourself one of the three it's a all three must be like a three-fold cord if you got those three together everything is okay they will balance everything back and forth and you keep moving if those three are not lined up you will be a PhD in [Music] faking try this microphone my brother amen glory to God thank you go ahead and say Amen there amen thank you that's that one is working so if you don't say Amen everything is all right I got my copilot with me amen so brother Abel wherever you are so remember to give me the date for the Young's men meeting amen amen amen glory be to God I'm going to say something normally uh we are in the subject dealing with roof and last Sunday we talked about the faith of Phoenix so today we were supposed to continue with rof again yes but your boss give me a different direction okay so I tried to go back in my computer to get into roof and he's locking me and I tried again he's locking me I tried the third time and every time I go back to teachers how to pray the anointing keep coming over me it keep coming over me amen so certain things I don't know how to explain that until you are in my in my shoes then you know what I'm talking about and then I have to obey I even have to repent to him because I say I was trying to go this direction and he's telling me go this direction so he's the boss I'm not the one preaching he's the one preaching so I have to follow his instruction that's why you going to see this the title is changing here but as I submit myself to him he begin to unfold to me clearly that whatever is going on in teachers to pray is actually capping that's the position the condition of rof before the Rapture that's it are you up to date with the sermon amen were you here on Wednesday did you follow Wednesday sermon amen and he showed me clearly that whatever is going on in teachers had to pray is actually capping the condition of roof before the Rapture clearly amen so once I finished this portion of teach just this portion of teachers how to pray then we going to go back to the airport with roof and you see what happen when we are taken up on the Rapture Day what will happen in the Rapture Day how are we raptured what happened how are we changed what will happen in that day we're talking about the Rapture the Rapture the Rapture faith for the Rapture now you need to know what happened and you need to be under expectation and whenever happened you're not surprised you're going to say that's it this is exactly what is happening everybody good so far we clear so far so keep your Bible stay tight with me because we're going to dig a little bit amen we clear amen glory to God let's go to our scripture thank you Jesus I changed the title on Wednesday because we didn't even touch where we were going so that's why I changed the title to give us father amen Deuteronomy chapter 8 if you never learn it you need to always obey the spirit of the Lord regardless of how many promises you made if God say go to the right you repent to the one that's you gave a promise and just go to the right so whoever was under expectation of Ru I'm sorry just hang tight we will go back again but I have to follow the direction of the Holy Spirit I have no choice he's the boss he's the one that owns the church he's the one that speak to the to his children I'm just a servant and I don't have any will we are unique we don't have any seed we have to deliver the original SE amen because unique were given to guard the brides uh so we cannot inject our own seed we have to put Only The Original Seed amen Deuteronomy chapter 8 if you miss Wednesday you're going to be ah I didn't say it I just approved that message verse one no let's go to verse two amen and you shall do what remember God want us to remember God want us to remember we need to remember remember what and you shall remember all the way which the Lord your God LED you these 40 years in the what Wilderness God want Israel to always remember what happened in the wilderness amen amen amen was a was Wilderness a good place why should we remember the Wilderness we don't want to remember those scorpion we don't want to remember the hard time we don't want to remember the desert where there is no water where there is no food where we hunger but you need to understand the language of God Amen he say remember all the way which the Lord your God LED you these 40 years in the wilderness come to do what humble thee you might be seated why does God want you to remember how he humble you amen is that really the message is that really the message God want you to remember how you were humbled let me ask you a question because I'm still I have to reboot somebody or maybe jump start someone okay so we can flow quickly is Calvary something good when you look at Calvary is it something good no without Calvary what can you do to the devil nothing nothing huh huh for your for your prayer to be answered you have to remember what Calvary when you remembering are you remembering the suffering what are you remembering of so what look like bad is not really bad he has a message in it what look like bad is not really bad there is a message there and that message will help you defeat the Devil come on Lord come on [Applause] Lord if you quickly with me we move on because what is here is loaded I'll have probably toward 30 something slider you see what I'm saying so let's move on don't do me like this okay all right let me do this way when uh the lion attacked David was it something good good no Hallelujah when the bear attacked David was it something good maybe David woke up and he said you know what I don't know maybe I didn't pray that's why this thing happened to me oh thank you Jesus I killed a bear oh I could be dead today yesterday he was a lion he was a bear today no yesterday he was a lion today he was a bear so maybe I'm cursed maybe there is a curse in my family that follow me that all the time things bad happen to me come on come on come on was David curs no sir all those things were preparing him to meet Goliath when Goliath faced David David begin to remember the bad stuff he begin to remember the lion he begin to remember the what the bear when he remember the lion he gave him strength when he remembered the bear he gave him more strength then when he look at Goliath he said you're not even a lion you don't even look like a [Applause] bear God want you to remember the Wilderness where he humbled you where everybody else in there is in the house enjoying playing on the cell phone you the one keeping the Sheep until before they see you they have to call you down the road there everybody's playing on the iPad you the one holding the the sheep in the wilderness he want you to remember those time that you look like you were humbled can I continue amen he says the Wilderness too humble you come and to do what prove thee but the David give him some volume I don't know why I can't hear him to prove you Amen to know what was in your heart you see the purpose you see the purpose I thought God knows everything why does he want to know what is in your heart if he already knows to know what is in your heart amen am amen amen he continues and he says whether you would keep his commandment or no you read verse three and he humbled you we need to see that kind of what kind of humbling was that he humbled you and allow you to do what hunger amen who brought the hunger God so he brought the hunger to kill you no sir what is he bringing the hunger for why didn't he bring plenty this humbling amen brings hunger to hunger he allowed you to hunger K and did what fed thee with men so when you hunger he didn't stop at bringing hunger on you in other words before he make you hunger he already have the solution for your hunger that's it that's it Hall everybody okay everybody okay he already have the [Applause] deep that will respond to that deep and when you hunger you probably were expecting to get food from McDonald but he gave you food that nobody in this world can produce it so a Divine hunger require a Divine food everybody okay everybody okay and what is the name of the food my friend man the name of the food is Mana if you read the Bible just like this you will miss things we need to understand what is Mana the Bible call Mana the food of angels amen and uh brother Branham also says this glory to God brother Branham say now there is some connection between him and Jehovah because he was created creating that bread and that fish I hope you're getting where I'm going right there before me no one else could do that but who Jehovah in other words Jesus was Jehovah in flesh and that's the same God that my mother told me about in the wilderness back there who brought what bre down from what creation so Mana was a cre yeed bread Mana was a bread that was created amen a created bread from creation out of what heaven we with our own eyes seen him today do what create bread right before us let's go back to our scripture and read it again verse three and he humbled you and allowed you to hunger and fed you with Mana which you knew not remember on Wednesday nobody knew this before you're the first one to test it is that hunger good or bad is that hunger good and bad so you can go to a trial to experience something nobody in your family experience that's it that's it nobody in your family will will even experience it because man had the beginning and stop somewhere that's right that's right amen he says and your neither did your father knows that he man make you know so the purpose of Mana in other word the coming down of Mana has a message that's right Mana didn't just come to satisfy the hunger Mana had a message the first message is a natural satisfaction to quench the hunger but there was a message within the message if you miss that that's when we get in trouble so when Mana comes he brought a message which is to take care of the hunger and the second message now God explaining he says to make you know that man does not live by what bread only because the bread that you receive nobody brought it it was a bread that was created are we together but by every word that proceed out of the mouth of who the Lord does what man live he's showing Israel that I gave you food that was created not by you nobody created it I'm the only one who created this food to teach you that even if you don't pack something in your bag even if you don't go shopping amen it's not a problem amen whether you pack enough food from Egypt amen for the journey or not that's not what I want you to understand amen I want you to understand that I am a God that can [Applause] create and the creation comes by the word of God Amen in other word if you can have just the word of God the word of God will create whatever you want amen so the are we together so the message of Mana is a double message it's a two-fold message it's a message M to take care of the necessary food but he also tells you that God is telling you that I can take care of you no matter what's happening whether your father left you a bank account or not that's not the problem men shall not leave by bread alone but by every word in other words if you get the word you can leave with it that's right if you just have the word God you can live with the word matter of fact you can eat bread and die everybody okay but the word of God can stop even you're dying amen am amen because Mana had a temporary was given had an expiration date you cannot keep Mana all the way to the next day so the Mana was the food for one day but when they took Mana into the the holiest man remain forever don't worry my friend we will get there amen verse four your Remnant works not old upon you neither did your foot your car swell these how many days 40 years so God took care even of their clothing and he took care of their health amen amen amen amen amen amen Mana was created for the children of Israel by God because Israel was under a prophet and that Prophet was called Moses and Moses was given two sons and one of his son was in the hand everybody okay and Moses already experienced the third pool himself amen that's right amen yes sir everybody okay because Moses would speak and flies come nobody else experienced that except Moses but when they get into the Wilderness God didn't want to stop that experience to Moses alone amen now God begin to to extend the experience to Israel am so that everybody can experience the creative power of God listen to brother Bram on this glory to God brother Bram says this he says now I want to ask you something if the blood of BS bull and a and or a goat be used for the for a bleach which can only do what cover could put a man in a position to do what speak the creative word of God and bring what flies into existence and which blood go Moses spoke Moses experienced the third po under the blood of Bo and goats that cannot bring the worshiper to Perfection and brother brandham continue he said why would you stumble at the bach of Jesus Christ blood who could cre who could do what speak a squirrel speak a squirrel or something into what existence if a man under the blood of bull and God can create how much more the perfect blood of Jesus Christ amen if you have faith in the Bible that Moses did something how can you doubt brother Bram amen because brother Bram is in the perfect lamb when John said Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world what do you expect the blood of Jesus Christ to do because Moses fault was still covered and yet with a covered sin Moses could speak but your fault nobody can find it amen even God himself cannot find what you did yesterday as long as you confess your fault even God cannot see it amen so if God cannot see your fault why do you doubt yourself [Applause] amen we take a little trial and we make it like a big deal you need to minimize trials When Trials come you laugh amen you don't cry anymore because when you cry the devil is happy when a trial is coming you start laughing you say Satan is this all you got is this all you got you have not learned a lesson yet I am a phoenix when I go down I will come up amen I will come out out of chaos out of Ru one out of nothing I have a power to play my down my life down and to pick my life again amen I will restore the years that's the the pal so no matter how much you are taking up I will have it a double person amen don't you remember job don't you remember job you took away his stuff that's my great great great grandpa do you remember what God did to him he double everything everything double double so the same thing will happen to me because he's the same yesterday today and forever so you need to know which door you parking amen stop crying in the midst of your trial laugh at the [Applause] [Music] devil You Are Not Alone God will never leave you nor forsake you he will be with you all the way when you hungry it doesn't mean God is not there he's the one that allow [Applause] it brother Bram say don't you do it don't stumble over what Simplicity do what believe that he still remains God oh my pardon my sin oh how I wish I could Mark what 11:22 what do it say if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you've said will come to pass you shall do what you can have what you said if Moses have it in the Old Testament how much more me [Music] God told Moses you're not going to enter in the promised land who said that what was he doing in mon [Applause] Transfiguration do you think the devil will keep you from the [Applause] rapture use let's go to Psalm 123 hallus thank you Lord Oh Glory to God the Mana has a message Glory Glory Hallelujah Psalm 123 sometime people tell me stuff as soon as they tell me I say it's not a big deal and they look at and feel like really I know what I'm talking about I tell my patient I say when you go I say you're going to make this procedure harder chill out in few minutes I'll get you out of the door chill out before you know it they say it's finished I say look over there look at your tooth there I say from now on you graduated when you come to my office no more anxiety when you laugh at the situation it trouble the devil because the devil expect you to [Applause] panic why does a lion have to attack a prey from the [Music] back why why Psalm 123 if you dare you can say amen amen why stepen you don't know how painful it is if you want to cry cry like a fish because a fish is in the ocean when he cry the tears are mingle with water so you don't know what what's going on with a fish you don't know whether it's water or whether it's tears have you ever seen a fish crying go check the ocean ah and you are a rainbow [Applause] [Music] Tru be something slow down is this the first time something happened to you amen you said trouble the way you come the same way you going to go ask your brothers who came before you ask them what happened here so you want to experience something too I'm going to make you you're going to get an experience today and you go back to hell and tell your friend over there don't go to that address that one is those are bad boys amen Psalm 12 three to you lift I up my what eyes so David is looking unto who God oh you that dwell where in the heavens remember we are in prayer so somebody's in heaven and somebody's where Earth on the earth the one on the earth is looking up to the one toward the heaven amen amen verse two behold as the eyes of of servants look to the water hand of their Masters they're not looking at their masters they are looking at what so what is in the hand of the master so when the servant is coming he's looking at the hand of the master what is in the hand of the master because God also have a right hand as a servant look where to the hands hand of who the Masters listen to David as a Ser as servants look to the hand of their masters and as the eyes of a maiden to the hand of who her mistress not to her mistress they're looking at the hand so the hand got something you cannot look at the hand that is bare it means the hand holding something right so when the the the master is coming the servant is already looking over there in the hand like uh what's going on there for me uh what is the meaning of what the boss is carrying there are we going to get a bonus today or is it a paycheck or uh what's going on have I done something good to be the employee of the month that's what they're looking at amen he says as the made in the hand of a mistress so our eyes wait can an ie wait our eyes wait upon who the Lord Our God until thou have what mercy upon us so the same expectation amen a servant is having toward a master or a maiden toward her mistress David said that's the same expectation I'm looking toward God and I'm waiting until God have mercy amen what does mercy means amen David is waiting for Mercy he's waiting for Mercy under expectation we clear amen we clear let's go to uh Luke chapter 11 then we pray glory to God Luke chap 11 we read it it's just if it's your first time so you know where we coming from Luke 11 verse1 glory to God amen amen and he came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place when he sees this this is Jesus one of his disciples said to him Lord do what teach us to pray so we can teach somebody to pray as John also did what taught his disciples so Jesus was not the first one to teach people how to pray amen amen and he said unto them when you pray say what Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name your kingdom come we went through this your will be done as in heaven so in Earth do what give us this day by our daily give us day by day Daily Bread this day is Matthew give us what day by day give us day by day am give us day by day what our daily bread Our Daily Bread in Matthew it says give us what this day give us this day our daily bread give us our daily bread amen day by day our daily bread amen amen and as a theme again let me pull this up in 1 Peter chap 5: 7 the bible say casting all not some all your cares upon who him so every care should go to who God why for he carth for you we're not casting our cares into somebody who doesn't care that's right we casting our cares into somebody who care for you so we have a health care [Applause] amen we have a healthc care and when you have a problem you go to your [Applause] healthare what kind of problem oh your problem we clear we clear amen you ready to go amen you ready to go amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning Father we thank you for your grace for your love your mercy and everything you have been doing for us father this is as much as I can do by the ability you have given me Lord father May you help me move completely out of the way may you come Lord and once again teach us to pray as we committed unto the hand in the name of Jesus Christ amen like I said the subject this morning is teach us to pray Our Daily Bread provider on Wednesday we started with Matthew where where the Bible say give us this day our daily bread everybody clear from this sentence here we stated or we establish again a the relationship that existed between the father who is God you remember and his child meaning his son or daughter amen and this appear as us amen and from this give us this day we found out that this statement speak of dependency you remember on Wednesday dependency on the side of a child amen and on the side of the father is speaking about responsibility you remember that yes amen then from there we found out that there is also an assurance amen that goes with this because the child cannot just come to the father and say give me bread just like that because the child knows exactly that the father have bread as we go back to our slide here brother Bram says this Amen brother Bram says if you need healing like if you come say brother Bram I am broke I didn't have any supper tonight and yeah I know if you had a dollar you will give it to me amen we clear and brother brandham say now see you don't have to say that to God brother if I can get batteries uh triple amen he said you don't have to say that to God you don't have to say what you don't have to say to God if you got healing power why because he has it amen when we talk to one another we usually say if you can help me because we are not sure whether you can help or not and brother bam say when you going to God you don't talk to God like that am because God goes with Assurance when you go to God he already have what you have need of and brother Bram say he has it you have to say to me if you got it that's me brother Bram but to him you don't have to say it you don't have to say if you have he has so you say like brother Bram would you give me a dollar I need something to eat why of course I would you know that if I had if I had it I give it to you anytime I it would uh I would have a a horrible heart if I didn't thank you my brother and me being how a cruel sinful man who's saying that brother BR brother brandham say and me being a cruel sinful man and who be that good-hearted to somebody like you what will God be amen remember on Wednesday amen amen God have what you have need of brother Bram continue he say if you being evil know how to give good gift how much more will your heavenly father give them the spirit that ask for it if you ask for a fish would he give you a serpent ask for bread would he give you a stone certainly not brother Bram said say why if you just ask him in that way with faith believing that you will get it from him how a million times quicker a million times quicker than you will get anything from me so God not only give but he give it quickly everybody okay and you know he will help you you know I'll help you I do anything I could any of this brother would we dig every penny out of the pocket to help you we do anything we could but this is something you got to believe by what faith so with God between you and him when you asking there is an assurance that whatever you ask God will give it to you by Assurance we talking about a confidence we talking about a certainty we talking about a word of Honor we talking about a guarantee that God will grant it to you everybody okay and when we spoke about it we reinforce this by scripture where Jesus say if we ask for bread will God give you what a stone the one who can give you stone is the devil because when Jesus was hungry and the devil came to him he didn't give him bread he turned him to the stone he said take this Stone and turn them into bread only the devil can do that and Jesus say It is written amen and do you know what happened to Jesus Christ the Bible say the angel came and brought him food Elijah went through trouble and an angel bring him food amen because men shall not live by bread alone amen but by every word even if there is nobody to give you food Heaven is always open amen Heaven is guaranteed am everybody okay are we together he says if you ask for a fish fish would you give you what a serpent and you ask for what egg would you give you what a scorpion and Jesus moved from bread to fish to egg and he went down to give you remember on Wednesday and from gift plural he went down to things plural gift we don't know what it is anything can be a gift anything can be a thing and then he dropped down to the Holy Ghost which is the gift of God the good and perfect gift of God because James say anything that is good and perfect it comes from the father above everybody clear so when we look at this two here in the Book of Matthew Matthew uses the word bread and fish he said if they ask you for bread he's not going to give a stone if they ask you for fish he's not going to give you a serpent look at these two things that Matthew Ed right here let's go in our scripture Into the Book of John chapter six let's look at fish and bread hallu John chapter 6 if you dare you can say Amen John 6 verse 5 glory to God you there amen the Bible says when Jesus then lift up his eyes and so who a great company come unto him a great company come unto him he says to Phillip where where shall we buy bread Who start the word bread where shall we buy bread that these may eat so he's not a God that only D to preach to you the word but he has to care for your need after you listen to the sermon God have to take care of something that is not a sermon that's it everybody okay he's a God that goes beyond the sermon because we have a tendency to look at God I need spiritual food I need spiritual you fooling yourself don't worry stay stay that way amen am amen amen he say and this he says to do what prove him to prove him for he himself what knew what he would so before God put you into a test God already know amen hallelujah are we together amen before you go through a test God already know what he's going to do so before he ask philli a question he already have a backup plan amen yes sir are we together oh glory to God he says then he says to prove him for he himself knew what he will do amen amen Phillip answered him humanistic way 200 penny worth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one of them may take a what little maybe in their bank account the treasury look and say you know what we only have 200 they say with 200 look at the number of these people can 200 bread feed this people it's not going to work but Jesus knew Jesus didn't ask that question just like that he was trying to train his disciples into something amen that even if money in the bank is not enough to take care of the need I'm trying to teach you something there is no Bank in this place the money that you have in the treasury is not sufficient but there is always a solution are we together father help me he says verse 8 one of his disciple Andrew Simon Peter's brother says to him there is a lad amen here which have what five barley loaves bread and what two small fishes and this is what Matthew asked he says if if your son ask you for a bread and a fish now we got bread and a fish that came together why only bread and fish why they didn't have maybe a tomato over there let's see the father in the sun everybody okay two two small fishes but what are they among so many and Jesus say are we together Jesus say make the man sit down now there was so much grass there was much grass in the place so the men sat down in number of about how many people 5,000 and Jesus Took the Loaves and and when he has given what thanks Thanksgiving he distributed to the disciple and the disciple to them that were set down and likewise of the fishes as much as the what wood so something begin to happen in the hand of Jesus Christ Jesus begin to create remember when there was no food in the wilderness Jesus created bread amen and when there were no food to feed 5,000 people and More Jesus be to create amen so the miracle here is the miracle of creation on on everybody okay am the miracle of creation everybody okay am he says when they were filled verse 12 he says to his disciple do what gather up the fragments that remain if you notice verse 11 the Bible say as much as they would in other words everybody have their portion but God didn't stop at the portion because God can give how exceedingly and how abundantly he didn't stop at the portion my God always give Bon am am come he gave beyond what was expected verse uh 12 when they were filled he says to his disciple gather up the fragments that remaineth that nothing be what lost you clear verse 13 therefore they gathered them together and filled 12 basket with the fragment of the five barley loaves which remain over and ab to them that had what this is a multiplication of the bread and the fish to take care of his children that were hungry we clear Amen jop to verse 26 this is where I'm going you there the next day the people came and they didn't see Jesus and they told them you know what Jesus went to the other side and everybody follow him they say Lord we come look at Jesus when he saw them verse 26 Jesus answered them and say verily verily I say to you you seek me not because you saw what the Miracles but because you did itat what of the loaves the Loaves and were what were filled so when Jesus was creating bread he was not really just creating bread he was saying something when Jesus was creating Mana he was not just creating Mana to take care of the immediate hunger Mana has a message amen everybody together so Jesus now begin to bring two aspect he says with what happen I didn't just took care of your natural immediate need everybody okay but I perform a miracle because of something but the problem with you instead of being caught by the miracle you were cut by the result of the miracle is are you following me amen even if I give you bread and you enjoying the bread don't look at the bread look at the source of the bread amen remember remember first what is the condition this bread came out of it what is the setting that this bread came out of how was this bread coming out is he a bread that somebody work and S and reap and work on it is a bread from creation amen everybody okay so get what you want but remember where it's coming from and remember how did I produce it remember the creative power of of God because it's the creative power of God that gave you bread in a difficult time if you remember only bread you going to get [Applause] stuck if I L you raise your hand if you only remember bread anytime you see me you will just remember bread bread bread and brain will be a bread brain I don't want you to be a Brin of only bread and Fishes I want you to see that no matter what you put in my hand I can reproduce it [Applause] am what happened to the bread and the fishes can happen to anything amen that was just an example because bread is not the end you need clothing you need a house you need a car you need so many thing you need a healing I'm just not limited to bread amen you need to rise higher you need to open your mind you need to think outside of the box spoken word don't be Christian that are lock in the Box this is what we do to God God can only do this Square was only an example did Moses create a square no that was his error he have to create what he needed brother Bram needed Square I don't hunt why should I create a square if not all of us need to be Hunters so that we can create Square you are stuck you don't understand God it is not the square it is the creative power of God [Applause] am let's go to the Book of Mark let's go to brother Mark let's see what brother Mark said Mark chapter 6 every time I sit at home this thing keep happing this thing keep happening I sit and it keep coming up it keep coming up just one statement is opening all of this the power of the seals my friend we have a powerful message amen Mark chapter 6 stay with me my friend I have not I'm I'm I'm just you know the asber you know this thing right here that goes like this I'm right here wow with everything that you just got I'm already right there so tell your tummy hey hey open up okay tell your tummy open up there is more coming up that was just the appetizer the bread and the and the and whatever food is still coming up okay don't get fill quickly Mark chapter 6 if you thereare you can say amen amen let's go to verse 35 I'm taking the same story according to brother Mark you there and when the day was now far spent his disciple came to him and say this is a what desert place which place did Jesus multiply the bread wild in the wilderness which place did the Mana fall amus I put you in this Wilderness I want you to remember the Wilderness amen because in the wilderness that's where I'm creating [Applause] stuff [Applause] amen listen listen to what your boss is saying listen to what your boss is saying listen very good to what he just taught me every day you woke up you healthy right you healthy you healthy you healthy you healthy you healthy what do you know about healing what do you know about healing you will think you just woke up and go like that but get sick one time your sickness is an opportunity for God to show you something you are not really realizing because when you healthy you don't see that God is protecting you but when you seek and he hear you he bring an awareness that God truly is with me that's why God wants you to remember your sickness because your sickness bring you quickly to remember him and to remember his power am father help me where are we my friend verse 35 verse 35 and the place is Desert and now the time is what far past send them away that they may go into the country where round about into the villages and do what buy themselves bread in other way the disciple look they say hey we're going to get in trouble here we hold these people with a sermon we need to give them food listen Master the time is f spent if you keep them here you need to take care of their Resort you need to put them in the hotel Hilton is a lot of money we cannot pay for the hotel you need to send them quickly so they can go to their places some are for South some are from uh Georgia some are from somewhere send them quickly because they're going to sit here they will spend more money we don't have money in the church send them quickly everybody okay amen and and and and do what and let them buy let them spend their own money H we don't want to spend Church money they they need to spend their own money that's what the disciple say but look at the Father the responsible man the one who own responsibility when he look he said these children came because of me and you telling me to send them like that you don't know what you're talking about I must show them that I'm a [Applause] father everybody okay verse uh 37 he answered and said to them do what give ye them to eat in other way don't let them spend their money you give them food that's right look they say hey we trying to get this thing off our hand he's putting the stuff on our hand you don't know how much money is in the treasury he say and they say to him shall we go and buy how many 200 penny worth of bread and give them to what in other words they're going back and forth with Jesus like you are telling us to buy food do you know how much money we got in the church only 200 look at the am of people in out the word god do you realize what you're talking about oh you under the anointing look at the people over there look at the money but Jesus knew what he was doing am it's a god of paradox can I continue he says in verse 38 he says to them how many loves have you he didn't even ask them how much money do you have because money you will go to buy and you need uh uh I mean uh I mean a delivery from Uber to bring it to you no no no no no no how much give me the finished product how much do you have I just need something how much do you have how many loves do you have go and see investigate and when they knew they say how many five and what fishes and two fishes everybody okay everybody good you know the story now jop to verse 44 he multiply and the eight I want you to see something verse 44 and they did and they that did eat of the loaves were about how many men 5,000 men and immediately he constrained his disciple to get into the ship and to go to the other side before Bida while he send the people what away now he can send the people away because he's a responsible man he need to take care of did you eat you finish okay now you can go to your home God bless you good to see you love you we see you next time God bless you God bless you just like we speak to one another amen and he tell his disciple I need to get in the car and I meet you on the other side amen amen everybody okay amen verse 30 46 amen and when he sent them away he departed into the mountain to pray and when evening was come they the Sheep was in the midst of the water sea and he alone on the water land so everybody's in the ship going he stay on the other side because he knew how he's going to get to the other side he didn't need any ship amen thank you and he saw them toing in rowing for the wind was contrary to them about the Fourth Watch of the night he comes to them doing what walking upon the sea and would have passed what by them can we read this together can we read this together Who start The Who start traveling before the disciple but a man walking is taking over and did you see what he did to them when he saw them he even bypassed them God bless you God bless you what is God teaching us what is he teaching us can I continue he sees you in trouble and he's waving like he's going what is he teaching us watch what he's teaching you my friend you there and would have passed by them verse 49 but when they did what saw him doing what walking upon the they suppos he had been a what a spirit and they did what cried out now it's another problem a problem with the Sheep now a ghost in the midst of a ship everybody okay verse 50 for they all saw him and were how trouble watch and immediately he talk with them and said to to them be what of good cheer it is who I what Be not Afraid and he went up to them into the sheep and the wind did what ceased and they were so amazing themselves beyond measure and did what Wonder spoken word watch verse 52 for they consider not the what Miracle of the laws what has the loes to do with a wind this is the wind in the midst of the sea but the Bible says they got in trouble not remembering not understanding the loes so God did the loaves to prepare them for the trip let me start it again let's read it again verse 52 I'm going this way because I cannot move faster if you don't get it verse 52 for they consider not the miracle of the water Lo for their heart was how hardened so when the trouble came in the sea Jesus expect the disciple to remember the loaves amen not to remember the loaves that they ate but to remember the miracle of the loav in other words if God can save us in the midst of the Wilderness and create bread there is nothing that God cannot take care of it you need to use that Miracle to win the devil on the [Applause] next are we together what has loves have to do with a wind it's two different things but Jesus say they should should have remembered the loaves if you remember the loaves like David he give you power he give you Revelation now you can look at the wind and you can win the wind based on the Miracle of the loes but if you miss the loaves you're going to get in trouble with the wind are we together amen are we together amen what are you trying to say listen to this the Bible says in the book of in the Book of Matthew chapter 16 Jesus said to them take heed and be aware of what the leav of the what Pharisees and the what the Sadducees Jesus uses only the vocabulary leav as soon as Jesus say leav in their mind bread watch the next verse and they did what reasoned among them themselves saying it is what because we have taken no bread all Jesus say is just leav to them it's not just Le they say what why did you hear him saying 11 what do you think he say 11 one say I know him if he start 11 like this meaning because we didn't pack bread so maybe he's hungry everybody okay everybody okay he needed a lunch boox listen my friend verse eight which when Jesus preach ceive he said to them oh what ye of little faith do you see what is going on why reason ye among yourself because ye have brought what no bread do ye not do ye not yet do what understand in other words the miracle of God have a message amen father help me glory to God can I raise hear the miracle of God has something and God say did you not from the miracle did you not understand understand what did you not understand K neither what remember God in the wilderness told Israel do what remember did you not understand or what remember two word or remember remember what did you not understand neither remember the what Five Loaves of the 5,000 and how many basket yet what took in other word you don't remember how I multiply the bread and even gave you more than what was needed you didn't understand and you don't even remember two words verse 10 needed the what seven loaves of the 4,000 and how many basket what he took so I did this miracle twice and I did it the same way and gave you over but it looks like you don't understand and you don't remember it is there is a power in understanding what God is doing and not only understanding but remembering what God did for you amen amen amen everybody okay amen what are you trying to say brother Steven listen to this in Psalm 10 106 verse 7 the bible says this David Our Father what understood not stop our father did what understood not do you see the word of David understood not what thy wonders in Egypt th th what wonders what is a Wonder so our father did not understand the miracle of God in Egypt so when God was doing miracle in Egypt he was not just displaying his power he was teaching Israel something amen and he want Israel to understand something Our Father did not understand your Miracle or your wonders follow me carefully Hallelujah give us this day amen Our Father uh Our Father understood not that Wonder in EG Egypt they what remember not do you see those two words understanding and what remember they did not understand and neither did they what remember remember they didn't remember not the what multitude of thy mercy so what was Miracle was not really Miracle am everybody okay what you call Miracle God doesn't call that miracle God is calling that Mercy amen when you got sick and God heal you you calling that a miracle God is saying that is my mercy and he said Israel did not understand my mercy and don't even remember my Mercy listen my friend remember not the multitude of what thy mercies but provoke him at the what even at the what R sea how did they provoke God what happened at the sea because at the sea it's appearing like they are locked like they cannot go over and the Red Sea is blocking them and when they look this way the Wilderness when they look this way the mountain and they look behind them pharaoh and they begin to cry and God is saying that by doing that they provoke him in other words God God begin you begin to get in the nerve of Godus I'm saying that in plain word in other way you begin to trouble God how many time am I going to do something for you to understand everything I did in Egypt is to create a confidence to create a certainty to create an assurance that whatever you face in your road remember what I did yesterday understand what I did yesterday I am still the same God I can destroy whatever is in front of [Applause] you listen to brother Bram glory to God brother Bram say to misunderstand is not just it's it's just not to say well I didn't hear what he said that's right but to see something done and what misunderstand what it is for amen so when God do something if you don't understand what the purpose of what God is doing you are misunderstanding God and brother brother say that you are missing the water mark or completely them now God does not do Miracle just to say see I am God I want you to soak that in I want you to soak that in because we say God show your power show your power God doesn't show your power just to show your power to show his power but the problem I'm say God does not do Miracle just to say see I am God God does a miracle for what an understanding that's why he's telling Israel you didn't understand me I brought you into the Wilderness and humble you and gave you Mana I want you to understand me I want you to understand that I care amen that I am your father am that I'm responsible for your life Oh Glory to God it's going to change your way of praying my friend he says God does a miracle for what understanding an understanding God does it for a what a purpose and did you notice the reading of the psalm here in the seventh chapter which we did Brother Bram say they did not understand why that God down where in Egypt performed this miracle he was trying to show them his what Mercy he was trying to get them to understand that he was what God in the in the what let's continue again he was trying to make them understand that what he was God in their midst so when God do something for your life God is not just showing off he's trying to tell you that I'm in the Mist amen I am in your life amen I got everything under control amen when he heal you he's telling you I'm there amen when he blesses you he's telling you I'm theread amen when he spay you from a car accident he's telling you I'm theread amen you need to understand God Amen [Applause] glory to God we are right here my friend glory to God can I continue I love that listen to brother Bram brother Bram say that is what God was doing to Israel you know he said as the water Eagle stir up her nest that is the same thing he found Israel where in a hallowing land down there he brought him up out of what Egypt and did what took him into the promised land on the what wings of an eagle and what was God doing this miracle he was trying to get his people that he was the water Mighty Jehovah that is what he's trying to do today amen are we together he just doesn't heal people just because he can heal my brother read that again in red he just what he maybe my English is complicated read in your English he just doesn't heal people just because he can heal he's trying to get you that he is what the resurrection that he can make you well he can raise your body he can do what whatever he wants he's Jehovah he can do whatever he wants to he is what Jehovah [Applause] so whatever God does in your life you need to understand and you need to remember because whatever he's doing he's trying to tell you I am with you I am standing with you I am protecting you I am blessing you I will be with you even to the end until the day of redemption amen though I walk in the midst of the Valley of the shadow of what you won't be with me that road and that stuff they do [Applause] what he prepareth your table where before who who put the table he didn't see your enemy he want your enemy to see you on the [Applause] table and when you are in the table facing your enemy what is is he doing to your head he's doing what anointing he's bringing you more power more anointing that's why he's giving us a table a seven Co table and he's anointing us every service amen every Wednesday every Sunday he's pouring up oil in the face of our enemies amen surely what goodness and what Mercy shall be where follow how many days all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord how glory to God blessed be the name of the [Applause] Lord Our Father which are in heaven give us this day what our daily bread because he is a father with responsibility you are depending on him and we have Assurance everybody okay are we together amen glory to God what else brother Steven can you draw from this place give us this day our daily bread amen amen amen amen glory to God amen amen before God can be responsible for your life he must have what you need [Music] amen everybody okay everybody okay Jesus is telling us go to him and say do what give us before you come to God to ask him something God already have it [Music] when he asked philli the question he already knew what he was doing am when he told Israel to go to the Wilderness he already knew what he was doing in other word he provide before you come [Applause] am glory to God let's listen to this my friend brother Bram says this look how your Earth what before you come here hallu are we together are we together before you come where here before they know you was what coming made what ready for your [Music] coming your cradle for the baby did you find the Cradle or they I mean did you see how they

is only a what a type of a Heavenly parent if we know how to give good gifts to our what children continue my friend how much more does your heavenly father knows how to give good gifts to his what children Jesus spoke this word see they made ready your what coming they made a little what CRI or got a little a little what booties or what little clothes and so forth they made ready everything for you to what arrive how prepare when before you even come on the earth Jesus has gone to make ready our what coming there in my father house is what many mansions so God not only prepare for here even for over there amen hallelujah he said I'm going to prepare a for you before the Rapture there is already a [Applause] place you don't understand the New Jerusalem already existed before I get there because I can I don't have time to sit down and to wait for the construction a provider must provide before I get there [Applause] amen before many of us were born he already sent Malachi 4 I will send you elij the prophet before you were born this message was already preached so when I come I have the full message everybody together everybody together let's look at our provider let's go to Genesis I'm good in time my friend let's go to Genesis chapter one glory to God Genesis chapter one if you thereare you can say amen amen glory to God Genesis chapter 1 yes verse 27 give us this day Our Daily Bread he cannot give you the order to ask him if he doesn't have it God first provide then he then he comes and tell you ask me now so when God is telling you ask me you might as well begin to [Applause] Rejoice do you feel there is something in your life that surprise [Applause] God you there amen Genesis chter 1 verse 2 uh 7 let's go my friend the Bible say God created who man in his what own image in the image of God created him who him who male male and who female and we want to be specific he created male male and female woman and men boys and girls boys and girls man and woman so everybody's included everybody okay everybody okay now let me ask you a question if you notice God never started by creating men no sir come on Brother come on I'm I'm I'm giving somebody time to catch up man was the last thing that was created do you know that God first start creating the tree creating the animal creating the fishes when he finish everything then the last thing he created was who why [Applause] why Hallelujah the tree was created for who the animal was created for who Hallelujah your steak was created for who your fishes your salmon was created for who your salad was created for who all of them came before you even bread came before you your orange came before you your Apple came before you because God must lay down your storage [Applause] first he's our provider he must provide first before he can birth his baby before the baby is born you must put something for the baby first so God when he was created in Genesis he was was making a baby shower [Music] [Applause] amen everybody okay because God have twins a boy and a girl had to be born so God was making a baby [Applause] shower can I continue can I continue glory to God let's go to verse oh let's go hey we good on time my friend let's go to verse 28 amen you there amen and God did what bless them and did what God and say to them be what be fruitful and what multiply and what and replenish the Earth and what subdue it multiply where the Earth replenish what the Earth between the Earth and man who was created first Hallelujah so the habitation of Man was created before men Adam was not outside and waiting like Daddy it's taking too long Daddy Daddy I need it now no when Adam come the Earth was finished when the Earth was created it was bad and God have to make sure he clean up everything for a safe environment amen can I continue can I continue because you pent your home before the baby's coming so God has to pent his home and bring amen he says have dominion over the fishes of the sea over the foul of the air over every living creature uh thing that moveth upon what the Earth you ready amen you ready amen let's go slowly on verse 29 go my friend and God said behold uh-huh I have given you every her bearing seed uhhuh stop God have given what every her bearing SE her doing what bearing seed for what which is upon the face of all the Earth for what and every tree and every tree and what in the which is the fruit of a tree uhhuh the fruit tree for what to to you it shall be for meat let me ask you question let's go slowly if you notice God is telling a Adam and Eve their diet am I am I reading a different Bible amen don't do me like this he's giving them a diet right and if you notice he use the word shall notice he said and shall be because man was still a spirit he cannot eat food yet but God already prepared food can I continue am he gave man his diet for the future because man was first a spirit amen and the diet he gave is seed and what and herbs and what fruits fruit and all of these were created before Adam so Adam came in into his food yes I don't know if you get what I'm saying Adam was born with his food when he was born his food was already there all that God has to do is indicate him which food to take he's a provider sir are we together he's a provider before you ask him he already provided he already stored he's not telling Adam that okay now since you are created I need to figure it out what can you eat no so when God was creating herb when he was creating fruit true fruit tree in his mind he was seeing Adam where is Adam go what is Adam going to eat wait wait wait wait before you created the fruit I will I I will bring uh a baby over there two babies make sure whatever you bring they it's going to be compatible with the digestive system can they have food okay okay so whenever God is creating in his back part man he have his children what do you think about you can I continue let's go to verse 30 my friend Ander every beast of the earth to who Beast every Beast this food this diet was for Adam and who and Eve this verse 30 he says he's creating something for who for for every what beast of the Earth every beast of the earth and who to every foul of the air and foul of the air and what else and to everything that creepeth upon the earth and the creeping thing and the creeping thing what wherein there is life uhhuh and what else I have given every green herb for Meat Stop he gave them what for what for me and what else it will so so God not only provided for human can I continue can I continue you're going to see the level of this provider he didn't provide food only for Adam and Eve but he provide food for the Beast amen for the foul and for the creeping things are we together amen are we together amen are we together amen why is God doing this listen to Paul in book of 2 Corinthians chapter 12 Paul says behold the third time I'm ready to come to you and I will not be Bome to you for a Seck not what yours but what you for the children what ought not to lay up for the parents that's right amen can you say amen amen can you say amen amen can say amen amen so when we working as a parent we need to lay stuff for our children a can you say can you verify your [Applause] Bible you need to go beyond just paying bills I will get on your finances my friend don't worry he says for the children ought not to lay up for the what parents but who the parents for the children hallah so every parent must lay feeds for their children if your children are sleeping outside it's your fault if food is not in the table it's your fault it is not the fault of the children the children are dependent in your taxes you put dependent and you are the head of the household but they are the dependent and it's a principle every parent must lay things for their what children because we are responsible amen if you don't have enough money don't bring them [Applause] forth do you follow me do you follow me that's why before you get married brother want to make sure a man has a job because you must provide for your family you must provide for your family you need to provide a shelter their clothing their food it is your [Applause] responsibility can I continue what kind of job do you work how much did they pay you you can't even afford an apartment leave the sisters alone leave the sisters alone because you cannot even pay a house leave the sister alone we need men that are responsible because the desire of your wife shall go to you if you are not sufficient back up my friend marriage is not just sex it is more than sex am Adam and Eve live after the marriage without sex the one who introduced the sex is the devil So Adam and Eve were living without sex and they were eating without sex so marriage is not just sex it's about [Applause] responsibility I wish I can shake Boys in this message and get them away from craziness of dancing dancing dancing around Stop Dancing go back to work am go back to school go back to work have a decent job for your [Applause] family everybody together patriarch you on a hot potato seat my friend but I have no choices amen it is a respon responsibility it is a principle for parent to lay down for their what and God being a parent God being a parent must be the first example and as the first parent he first laid down for his [Applause] children you don't lay down things only for them to enjoy your responsibility goes even when they make mistake because when Adam and Eve made mistake God came with the [Applause] medication so God was a Healer before Adam and Eve got sick God was a savior before his children fell so when his children fa he doesn't impress God God just bring the medication and kill a lamb and take care of the situation marriage have a big responsibility not just providing food but to take care even in their mistake everybody okay everybody good amen everybody okay amen so God as the father have to lay down food for his children listen at the second principle my friend glory to God in first Timothy 5 verse 8 but if any what provide not for his stop then the word provide provide provider provider provider provider amen if any do what provide not for his own and especially for those of what his own house he has done what denied the faith and he's what worse than an Infidel say amen

a raven he Hearth The Cry of the beast of the sea he Hearth the Roaring of a lion he must hear a cry of a human being of his own child that's why the Bible say look at the bird they do not do what nor do what if you go to Matthew Matthew say look at the bird but which bird we don't know look at this and I stop here for the time ver Luke 12: 24 consider who the Ravens so now we know which bird consider the heaven the The Raven for they nether do what so no what which nether have what store house no what barn I don't know if you understanding this they don't go to work they don't have a job they don't store nothing they don't cook anything everybody okay and God do what feed them so who feed them God do do they have to store something no do they need a saving account no do they need a retirement plan no so who's giving them food God read the next now how much what more are ye what better than the fouls so the Raven God take care of the food and the Raven are below you and God can give the r even human food right yes Lord first king chapter 17 and it shall be that that shall drink of the water Brook I have commanded who the Ravens to feed thee there to feed who you Elijah I have commanded the what Raven so God to bring food to Elijah he put the Raven where did let's see what kind of food did the Raven bring verse six and the Raven brought him what bread stop can a can a raven bake bread no where did they get bread God who created the bread God where did they get bread and they brought bread and what flesh where did they get a [Music] steak so God can give even a RAV a sandwich how did the Raven make a sandwich amen bread and flesh in the what morning and bread and flesh in what the even to m a day amen from the r amen so God can give the Revan their food and God commanded the Revan to take food and to bring to his Prophet Elijah in other words God can take care of everything amen when the disciple needed money for the tax [Applause] [Music] and the AR need his money God didn't go to the bank he went to a fish open he said open the mouth of a fish and draw water because he go Jehovah that provided is Jehovah JRA he provide for your [Applause] need if God can take care of a grass that today is and tomorrow is going to be burned how much more you of leader Faith sufficient unto the day is the trouble thereof do not worry about what you eat and what you clothe because your father know this thing before you ask him [Applause] am everybody okay God is your provider amen God will provide before you even ask he already Heaven because he have to lay a store because of you that's why when we come to God we don't hesitate in other word if a need come in your life it is just a signal that God has [Applause] [Music] that if a need come in your heart it means there is a deep somewhere that's going to respond to the deep and when a need arise in your life you you don't have to be trouble you know to your make and you go you say the r cry I am made in your image in your likeness when you come to this world you look like me you are human like me me and you are human I look like you I have your DNA I have your blood you created deserve for me you have to give me what I needed give us this day our daily bread amen give us because he has it because he wants you to ask he's expecting you to ask because he already have it what is God going to do with a bread let's [Applause] stand teach us to pray am our provider Our Daily Bread amen amen this is where we stop amen God doesn't do things in your life just like that amen you struggle with something and God open up the way that's right you struggle with something God open up the way it is not for you to Rejoice to testify and forget it is is a purpose God is telling you something that I'm with you he's teaching you something he want you to understand and to remember appreciate what he gave you but look more at where is that coming from look how tight I was and God help me that's what God wants you to get the message so that on the uncoming trial you will remember what he did and you will stop being worried when they say you begin to think about bread some of us when they say something you are upset all the time because you worry worry worry too much it the miracle of God is to take tension off our life so that the next time when they say something you say you know what we went through a lot and God Deliver us you know what let's go to sleep everything will be taken care of in the morning that's what God want you to do because the pressure is not to the children the pressure is for the father to lay down for the children and God laid down everything on Calvary that's it that's why the scripture say how can he not give you freely all things that's right because he already did everything on Calvary he prayed the full price and brother Bram comes back he say he give you a check that's right these thing are not words that we speaking I'm showing you why God wants you to ask let's pray you pray on your own before I pray [Music] the bird do not worry about who's next to them a baby don't care who's in the house when the baby's hungry the baby cry the baby doesn't see that he going to disturb Church order when he's in need they cry so forget about who's beside you talk to God the position of the Brad before the rapture we cannot continue in [Music]

miracle and the great things that you have done in the ministry of our prophet and in our individual life and in the lives of our brothers and sisters but father you brought a new light so that we understand that this miracle has a message behind them and the message is that you want to tell your children that you are right there in the midst of trouble where they think like there is no help where they thinks that they're going on their own and they feel like they just about to bust the ride at the corner and they can't take it anymore father you are still there and we don't want to be like the disciple who when we are tossed to and fr in the midst of trouble we are forgetting the miracle that you have done for us yes Lord father help each one of us remember and Ponder on the things

cometh upon the the just and the unjust amen if the unjust can receive the rain how much more your children how much more your elect that are crying day and night you want us to strengthen our confidence in our prayer to know Lord father that when the we approach you we are approaching with full Assurance we are approaching with confidence we are approaching with faith amen knowing Lord

abundantly and you can give us all good and perfect gift you can give us the Holy Spirit and you can give us a habitation because you give it Lord father for the foul and you give it for the creation

children those that are present here or streaming online and those that will stream down the road but father may you manifest yourself like Jehovah Jara whatever they have need of Lord may you provide
