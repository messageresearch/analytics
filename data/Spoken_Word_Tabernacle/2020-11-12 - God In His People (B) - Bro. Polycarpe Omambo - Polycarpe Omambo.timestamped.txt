[14:45] he's one of our local here with buddy

[14:56] direction so brother caleb is in a boot
[15:00] camp

[15:07] we're going to give him his liberty what

[15:17] and if somebody can record i don't know
[15:20] if your cell phone or something
[15:22] that would be great until the connection
[15:24] comes
[15:26] let's sing only believe don't be
[15:28] distracted let them work
[15:30] let's focus on the word amen well lord
[15:46] all things are
[15:49] possible
[15:52] all
[15:57] [Music]
[16:06] oh
[16:08] [Music]
[16:20] lord i believe lord
[16:30] i believe
[16:34] all things are possible
[16:53] [Music]
[16:58] all things are possible
[17:07] one more time jesus is here jesus
[17:22] all things are possible
[17:27] [Music]
[17:30] jesus
[17:32] [Music]
[17:50] [Music]
[18:04] i greet you all in the name of the lord
[18:06] jesus christ
[18:10] i thank the lord jesus christ
[18:27] there are many that are sick that are
[18:29] still in the hospital
[18:33] the more some are already declared to be
[18:36] dead
[18:40] but you and me by his grace we are in
[18:43] his house tonight
[18:46] that's the reason why we are thanking
[18:48] him
[18:51] and we believe that his presence is here
[19:08] before you came to this building the
[19:10] angel of the lord was already here
[19:14] god was already here
[19:18] god richly bless you
[19:21] i thank the pastor
[19:33] it is not up to everybody to do it
[19:48] they will not open their door to bring
[19:50] other ministers to preach it
[19:53] but if you notice
[19:58] not only to local minister did he open
[20:00] the door
[20:02] but he is calling either minister from
[20:05] other churches as well
[20:08] and they all are contributing to bring
[20:10] in the word of god
[20:14] and i believe with my heart that's the
[20:16] leadership of the holy spirit
[20:19] [Music]
[20:33] and those five ministries are not in one
[20:36] person
[20:39] it's the firefall ministry that edifies
[20:42] the body
[20:46] today the world are making fun of the
[20:48] churches
[20:50] they are making fun of christians
[20:56] they are even asking questions where is
[20:58] the power of god
[21:13] we must be the carrier of the entire
[21:16] power of god
[21:21] that's the reason why we are grateful to
[21:24] our god for our pattern
[21:26] and we always support him with prayer
[21:29] that the lord protect him
[21:30] and bless him and bless also his family
[21:35] his children and his wife if we love our
[21:39] pastor
[21:41] we are supposed to be praying for him
[21:45] why because he's a target
[21:48] if the devil wants to struggle
[21:52] he will first start by the shepherd amen
[21:56] amen
[22:04] but we should pray for him in our home
[22:08] may the lord richly bless you hallelujah
[22:11] hallelujah
[22:13] his presence is already here the
[22:16] presence of the lord is here
[22:20] it's not by any chance that you hear
[22:22] tonight
[22:23] this
