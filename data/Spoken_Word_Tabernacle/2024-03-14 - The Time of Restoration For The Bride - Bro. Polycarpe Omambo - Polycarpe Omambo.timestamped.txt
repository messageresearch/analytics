[46:06] Amen Genesis

[46:45] and all that are
[46:47] dine amen amen
[46:54] amen may the Lord bless his
[46:57] word that we just
[47:04] readel if you would go with me also in
[47:07] the Book of Ezekiel I would like to read
[47:10] something there as
[47:13] well or maybe we can read it
[47:19] later but the two chapters the two books
[47:23] that we read in the scripture
[47:25] tonight
[47:32] this is where we are drawing our tle
[47:36] tonight the restoration of the Brad
[47:40] tree the prophet William
[47:43] Mario Brother Bram preached the same
[47:52] message and brother Bram Jo this ttle
[47:55] after the sermon of brother
[48:00] Neville and the word that brother
[48:03] Neville was using that
[48:06] morning and he used the word
[48:11] restore and when brother Bram heard
[48:15] that he went straight
[48:20] home and he searched the word in the
[48:25] dictionary to really the meaning of the
[48:28] word amen
[48:36] amen and from Dance come the title The
[48:39] restoration of the Brad tree amen
[48:42] amen and you will
[48:45] notice in the two books that we read
[48:51] tonight in the Book of Genesis CH 20:
[48:55] 7
[49:01] God was speaking to AB just a
[49:06] portion and he was telling him to
[49:08] restore Sarah back to
[49:15] Abraham and brother Bram interpret that
[49:18] scripture such as
[49:20] this that's to
[49:22] [Applause]
[49:24] restore it means you taking something
[49:29] and bring it back to the original
[49:32] owner to bring it back to the original
[49:38] state noticed that Sarah was more
[49:43] beautiful since he was a just man in his
[49:47] heart God acknowledged his righteous
[49:52] heart and God forbade him to touch Sarah
[49:57] because Sarah was a wife to the
[50:01] prophet that's why he gave him
[50:03] instruction to restore her
[50:09] back if you don't do it you will die you
[50:12] and your house and everything that is
[50:14] dine amen
[50:17] amen that's why we read that
[50:23] scripture God told him to restore SRA
[50:26] back you know and you are acquainted
[50:28] with the
[50:31] story just to give you an idea what a
[50:33] restoration
[50:37] means and where we read in the Book of
[50:42] Joel they talk to us or they mentioned
[50:45] three or four
[50:48] creatures and they were there to destroy
[50:50] as an
[50:52] army to destroy the life of the children
[50:55] of Israel
[50:57] maybe a work maybe a
[51:00] health maybe uh
[51:05] families it was the great Army that the
[51:07] Lord
[51:08] sent and that Army was completely
[51:11] destroying Israel and how were they
[51:16] doing meaning when the first Army step
[51:19] in the first
[51:20] group they will
[51:23] attack when they
[51:25] destroy
[51:29] they will make way before you regroup
[51:34] again they will prepare the ground for
[51:37] the next Army coming
[51:39] in and the next one will take
[51:45] over until the scriptures say everything
[51:48] will be wiped away amen
[51:54] amen and that's the way God sent this
[51:56] Great Mighty
[51:59] Army God remembered his
[52:04] people and God say I will restore them
[52:07] amen
[52:10] amen and God to restore his
[52:15] people God himself doesn't come down to
[52:19] do God uses his servant that he
[52:25] ordained
[52:27] he will use those servant to do his
[52:31] work and this is what we will try to
[52:34] investigate
[52:38] tonight if you go to the book of 1
[52:40] Samuel chapter
[52:43] 1 in verse
[52:48] five you know you are in quainted all of
[52:50] us with the story of Hanah amen
[52:55] amen and we as
[52:59] preachers we are led by the spirit of
[53:03] God to interpret
[53:06] that the way that God inspires
[53:10] us as brother BR mention
[53:15] it that he can take one scripture and
[53:18] preach many
[53:21] ways but the book that I mentioned in
[53:24] the book of First Samuel
[53:27] 1 Samuel 1 verse
[53:33] 5 they were talking or they were
[53:35] describing how
[53:38] El I know that this is a
[53:44] story was the husband of
[53:48] Hannah he had two old two two wives it
[53:51] was Hannah and
[53:55] Pana sacri and every time he goes for he
[53:59] year for his yearly
[54:05] sacrifice he will give to Pana and her
[54:09] children a portion to each
[54:12] person but when he belonged to
[54:16] anah he was giving Hannah the
[54:19] double because he L
[54:22] Hannah but the only problem she was
[54:25] barren
[54:28] was
[54:31] fine was good because she already got
[54:34] children but that was not the case for
[54:36] Hannah amen
[54:38] amen and in verse
[54:43] 11 Hanah vowed to the
[54:46] Lord and she said
[54:49] this she said Lord of
[54:55] host if thou will indeed look on the
[54:58] Affliction of the
[55:01] hand and remember
[55:06] me and forget and and not forget
[55:13] handmade but will give unto the hand man
[55:16] a man
[55:20] child then I will give him unto the Lord
[55:23] all the days of his life amen
[55:28] and you notice here anna was
[55:32] praying just as any believer can
[55:37] pray Hanah was
[55:39] praying and God heard
[55:43] her but if you notice God never replied
[55:46] to her amen
[55:48] amen God knew about the
[55:52] situation and it's God that allow her to
[55:55] be barren amen
[55:58] amen because sometime we ask ourselves
[56:01] questions why did such a situation
[56:04] happen why am I going through this
[56:08] trials why did I find myself in the
[56:11] valley have I seen somewhere no
[56:15] no it is not that you seen or done
[56:18] something wrong yes of
[56:21] course we are
[56:24] victims of
[56:26] people's uh ideas
[56:30] speeches or maybe statement people say
[56:34] or behavior of people
[56:36] toward or maybe the people around
[56:40] us we are victim of those
[56:43] circumstances but we are also victim of
[56:46] our own self about our own
[56:50] actions for instance one
[56:53] day the day they were crucifying Jesus
[56:55] Christ
[56:57] the people that were screaming crucify
[57:01] him they say let the sin be upon us and
[57:04] our children in upon our
[57:08] children can you imagine the children
[57:10] were completely
[57:12] Innocent but now they are
[57:14] victim of something that they have not
[57:18] done and it goes from one generation to
[57:21] another that's why I said that we are
[57:25] victim some
[57:27] of maybe somebody else action or maybe a
[57:30] behavior of somebody or maybe a
[57:32] statement someone
[57:35] made or maybe something somebody wrote
[57:38] or to condemn you and when you read that
[57:41] message and you find
[57:44] yourself and you cannot even
[57:46] move because somebody told you something
[57:49] and that you don't like
[57:51] maybe and
[57:53] also we are also victim of our
[57:58] the
[57:58] cross there were two
[58:02] thevs according to them it was legal for
[58:06] them to be
[58:11] crucified because they were guilty of
[58:13] the action that they condemned them for
[58:16] amen
[58:18] amen that's the reason why
[58:21] I so sometime we could be victim one way
[58:24] or the
[58:25] other
[58:27] if you notice
[58:29] now Hanah prayed God heard but God never
[58:34] replied to
[58:37] her but in
[58:42] Samu chapter 1 verse 26 to verse
[58:50] 28 let me go back first in verse
[58:55] 17
[58:56] God who allow Hannah to be
[59:01] Barren when Hannah vowed and the Lord
[59:04] heard her
[59:07] vow God spoke to his
[59:10] servant El amen
[59:15] amen it was that
[59:24] spoke he was the one that spoke to
[59:29] an and listen to what changed the life
[59:32] of
[59:35] Hannah he
[59:38] say go in
[59:41] peace and the god of
[59:46] Israel Grant the that petition that th
[59:50] has asked of
[59:55] him was not the one who
[59:57] prayed do you listen to
[1:00:00] me he just
[1:00:02] took an
[1:00:05] authority as brother Bram
[1:00:07] says we don't have
[1:00:10] power but we have authority am amen he
[1:00:15] said go in
[1:00:18] peace may the Lord of
[1:00:20] is Grant thee
[1:00:24] that ask
[1:00:27] him this is what solved the matter am
[1:00:32] amen this is what gave her the
[1:00:36] child and in verse
[1:00:38] 26 all the way to
[1:00:42] 28 when she got the
[1:00:46] baby she kept her vow and brought the
[1:00:50] child back to the
[1:00:51] Tabernacle in the house of the Lord for
[1:00:55] the service of the Lord
[1:00:58] now imagine she only have one child at
[1:01:01] that
[1:01:02] time how many times me and you my
[1:01:05] brother my
[1:01:06] sister when we go through
[1:01:09] problems when we are
[1:01:12] praying how how many promises do we vow
[1:01:15] unto the
[1:01:17] Lord maybe you are looking for a
[1:01:20] job maybe you want to get
[1:01:23] married maybe you are looking for
[1:01:25] children
[1:01:26] but when God bless
[1:01:29] you when you didn't have something you
[1:01:32] saw the pastor you were coming to church
[1:01:34] when you when you didn't have anything
[1:01:37] you were praying but when God give to
[1:01:41] you only few people comes
[1:01:46] back to be to acknowledge what go what
[1:01:50] they spoke to the
[1:01:52] Lord now I'm still going into the same
[1:01:57] road to show you
[1:02:00] this
[1:02:02] everything
[1:02:04] the God says this in the
[1:02:07] Bible that trust believe the
[1:02:10] Lord and you will be
[1:02:14] established do you listen to
[1:02:17] me to be
[1:02:19] established you must look unto the
[1:02:22] Lord but you must look at his servant
[1:02:25] and then you prosper because your
[1:02:28] Prosperity is always connected with a
[1:02:33] servant with a man of God Amen
[1:02:38] why just like now we are
[1:02:42] here we are not here to speak our own
[1:02:46] words but we want to give God's verdict
[1:02:49] to you
[1:02:51] amen how is God going to speak to
[1:02:54] you God will speak to you through his
[1:02:57] word by his servant am
[1:03:02] amen and you will noce something we will
[1:03:04] see something
[1:03:06] here in the book for in the book of
[1:03:09] Exodus chapter
[1:03:12] 3 I'm just going to save time God Called
[1:03:16] Moses it was God that chose Moses god
[1:03:20] establish and he was a leader amen
[1:03:24] amen
[1:03:26] but you will notice in Exodus
[1:03:29] 31 from the first to verse
[1:03:32] 6
[1:03:34] God
[1:03:36] chose he chose B amen amen
[1:03:41] B
[1:03:45] and God chose both of
[1:03:48] them but if you noce in the scripture
[1:03:50] God never spoke to them directly that I
[1:03:53] chose both of
[1:03:54] you I chose you to work for me with
[1:03:57] Moses God never done
[1:03:59] it because God worked through his
[1:04:02] servant God deal with the authority he
[1:04:06] has established he is a god of
[1:04:10] order God spoke to Moses he said
[1:04:14] Moses I have chosen a chosen Bel
[1:04:19] and for my
[1:04:22] service that I see over
[1:04:24] there I want them to build the
[1:04:27] Tabernacle they have the wisdom that I
[1:04:30] put in them I chose both of
[1:04:33] them but God didn't tell
[1:04:35] them because they will come with their
[1:04:38] pride spirit and come and say Moses oh
[1:04:42] the Lord sent us oh God told
[1:04:45] us we are also leader God also chose us
[1:04:50] do you see the way God
[1:04:52] work God chose Moses chose those people
[1:04:57] but God don't speak to those people I
[1:05:00] chose you am
[1:05:02] amen Moses himself who have to make the
[1:05:06] choice of God in the congregation to
[1:05:09] pick this and this one to work with him
[1:05:12] amen
[1:05:14] amen and when Moses chose
[1:05:17] them they will respect
[1:05:20] Moses and there will be order in the
[1:05:24] congregation of working amen
[1:05:28] amen blessed be the name of the

[1:26:59] or restore a claim can be
[1:27:04] enforc to bring anything back to its
[1:27:07] rightful owner where it
