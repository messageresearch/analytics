TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[music] We had our young sisters meeting 4 hours meeting. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the first meeting that we have so many questions like that. Unbelievable. 4 hours meeting. So we cover we we we even went back a little bit on courtship and move back and cover everything on engagement. I sent to sister Adasa the database all the document of the court &gt;&gt; they printed out for free. So everybody you go ahead and get those copy and you know exactly what the prophet say about everything that we spoke about. Amen. For those who missed yesterday, the copy will be at the deacons. So you go visit Sister Joanne. She'll be more than happy to sit with you and you can watch that with Sister Joanne and make sure you catch up yourself. But if you miss, I'm going to still hold you responsible &gt;&gt; for the material that was delivered. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. So these are very difficult and tough and very tough subject when it comes to vow and everything. Like I say, I am preaching to the young people. I don't want to come and deal with a divorce. I'm going one time you go there and then we finish we seal it. The next day we see you in the rapture. You and your husband and your children over there. I'm dealing with the old generation that had that didn't have the teaching that you have. And I'm even giving you things that me myself as a pastor didn't even know. &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't know that brother Brandham did a proposal under the tree. &gt;&gt; All of those are in the quote over there. &gt;&gt; Amen. And me that have to correct brother Brandham about the proposal and tell him you don't put a ring on me until you talk to my parent. I got the quote over there. &gt;&gt; I got the quote over there. &gt;&gt; Amen. I gave you all the quotes. The quotes are over there. Amen. [applause] Like I said, if a young man was not taught like you, you have a responsibility to recalibrate the young man and bring him back again online. Amen. Every single quote is over there for free. &gt;&gt; So that has been said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is no fusses. There is no problem now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm saying this before something comes up &gt;&gt; because some people wait till there is a problem and they run on the problem and say I'm going to leave the church but they already purposed to leave the church. They were waiting for a problem. So there is no problem now. &gt;&gt; Okay there is no problem now. So parent everything that I have been teaching these children they gathered I print out everything and this is the standard [snorts] that we have for this church. Amen. &gt;&gt; I am not going to lower any standard. &gt;&gt; I am not going to change any standard. I am not going to I mean compromise any standard because everything that was brought up came from the Bible and the message of the hour. You voted me to preach the Bible according to the message of the hour. Are we clear? So if a child, a young man or a young sister in this church go against what has been taught. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? If the parent compromise with it, &gt;&gt; count me out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Count me completely out. &gt;&gt; Amen. In other word, if you go against everything that we discussed yesterday &gt;&gt; and that I taught you in courtship and whatever, &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't put pressure on me. &gt;&gt; I am not going to bless your marriage. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well. &gt;&gt; If I have to preach this and go home, that's fine. &gt;&gt; Let's make sure because there is no problem. &gt;&gt; No, sir. If an unbeliever is coming from denomination &gt;&gt; and they don't know anything about the message &gt;&gt; and they come to me they have been probably leaving as a boyfriend have children and they say brother Stephen we want you to bless the marriage it's a different story &gt;&gt; I will sit with them I will go through the teaching and everything and make sure everything is clear before I lay my hand &gt;&gt; that's why when they call me in uh Ohio I have to make sure everything is correct if not I don't lay my hand on Are we together? You are not off the street. &gt;&gt; God gave you a best privilege ever &gt;&gt; that we didn't have. [applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? If you didn't show up, that's your problem. That's not my problem. God gave you the best privilege ever. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. We taught you everything before you get in trouble. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, if you turn around and you go against the word of God, &gt;&gt; that's it. Let's be clear, parent. I am not going to bless your marriage. You need to find another pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't even invite me &gt;&gt; because I won't be there to support what I know is against the word of God. &gt;&gt; Don't put the pressure on brother John &gt;&gt; to announce your marriage right here. &gt;&gt; Don't put the pressure on the song leader to announce your marriage here. DON'T PUT THE PRESSURE on the YOUNG PEOPLE &gt;&gt; to pull them to the marriage that is contrary to THE WORD OF GOD. DON'T PUT A PRESSURE ON THE CHURCH &gt;&gt; TO BRING PEOPLE TO SUPPORT YOU BECAUSE you're doing something contrary to the word. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Count me out. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I preach church order here. I preach every single office in the church order here. every single of them. The copies are there. If you want to know, it's right there. I even invited the whole church to be there. So if you don't comply with what has been preached, sit down on the pew. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; I preach about music part one, part two, part three. Everything about music is right here. If you don't comply as a musician, sit down. &gt;&gt; But don't bring any influence right here. And don't pull somebody. Don't put, in other words, do not put any pressure right here. Amen. We already establish everything. Parent, they going to have the code. You can take the quote from them. You can read all the code. We can be on the same page. If you want to see the tape, the deacon have it. You go to the deacon. You can review everything clear. Are we together? &gt;&gt; So don't put pressure on me. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to bless your wedding. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to even be there because you're going against the word of God. There was a young man that came to me. I told him I said what you're trying to do is against what brother Brandham say. He left the church and went married. Thank God he didn't even call me because I would not even go. Are we together? So if it get to the point we got to separate, let's separate in peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is no problem. Are we together? But as for me and this church, I'm going to stay behind the word, &gt;&gt; behind the message of the hour and behind the word. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Your parents do not make those daughter to compromise &gt;&gt; because there was a question yesterday. We are trying to stand on the ground on the message and the parent are compromising. &gt;&gt; So brother Brandham say no daddy's saying that's okay you can go ahead and do it. Mom is saying that's okay you can go ahead and do it. That's not correct. I taught them I gave them quote even about the gift yesterday. &gt;&gt; When should a man give you a gift? All of them are in the quote over there. All of them are in the court according to brother Brana. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So parent, let's stick together. I already called you and I told you do not be aggressive to old men. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Young sisters, do not be aggressive to old men. &gt;&gt; Courtship is not marriage. &gt;&gt; Amen. In courtship, you don't go to the man's house and BEGIN TO WASH DISHES &gt;&gt; and begin to wash the bathroom and begin to be a a door DASH FOR THE young man to bring him and deliver food over there. Parent, WHEN YOU SEE THINGS LIKE THIS, CHASE THEM AWAY FROM HOME. Tell them [laughter] don't come home. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you got it. &gt;&gt; I don't know if YOU GET IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE CLEAR TOGETHER. You are not married. You are not a married woman. They are calling you. Amen. If your husband is in Mississippi, you don't leave here to go to Mississippi. I already told you yesterday. The husband leave Mississippi and come right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To see you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't leave here and book a hotel to go see your boyfriend. DON'T BUY HIM GIFT. &gt;&gt; HE IS THE ONE to win your soul. &gt;&gt; I'm talking. Some of you are laughing. THIS IS NOT A GAME. THIS IS NOT A GAME. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; RESPECT YOURSELF and the young men will respect you. &gt;&gt; GIVE YOURSELF HONOR. &gt;&gt; You are not sheep. &gt;&gt; You are daughters of the king. &gt;&gt; You are God's. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; You are not. I don't know where this came up of of young sister begging men &gt;&gt; like it's the last marriage in the entire world &gt;&gt; who put you under pressure &gt;&gt; and parent don't put them under pressure. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say you should not marry a boy because your mother love him. &gt;&gt; That's what brother Brandham say. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you get beaten your mother won't get beaten. You'll be the one beaten. &gt;&gt; Amen. So make sure you find the head. &gt;&gt; A true Christian. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Parents, ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; IN COURTSHIP, DON'T BEG THE YOUNG MEN. &gt;&gt; DON'T GO TO THE HOUSES AND WASH DISHES AND VACUUMING THE HOUSE. DON'T DO THAT. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So I put heaven and earth to be witness between me and you &gt;&gt; that everything is clear. The video and the deacon the courts are over there. Youngsmen once we finish the the finances then we start courtship with them. All of them need to be on the same page. &gt;&gt; Is it a false vow? Is it a true vow? Whatever. Every answer was answered yesterday with quote after quote after quote after quote. So don't come and search for trouble again and say this is this. I'm not going to be part of it. I'm going to be at home sitting with my family and you have your marriage over there where you going to go to hell. That's your problem. There was a man, it's not in this church, a young man who left the message. And he was putting pressure on his siblings to leave the message. And I was talking to the father. The father told me that I told him you go to hell yourself. &gt;&gt; So don't pull people with you. Are we together? Young people, watch what you supporting. &gt;&gt; Watch what you supporting &gt;&gt; because what you supporting, you'll be held accountable according to the scripture. &gt;&gt; Oh, I just want to show a support.

Amen. &gt;&gt; You want to go the hard way. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Steven, I was not there. You are responsible to go to the deacon and listen to it. But I'm not going to lower my standard. I am not going to lower my standard. I was talking to somebody. I said, "This is what I taught in church." He's not a member of this church. I said, "This is what I taught in church. I'm not changing the standard because what I brought came from the message of the hour and from the Bible. I'm not going to back up. Are we together? Because the only protection we have is the message. &gt;&gt; When you start playing with the message, you are destroying the protection. Then we're in trouble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh you are our honeys. I gave you the quote. &gt;&gt; So I'm jealous &gt;&gt; of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My babies in the gospel.
