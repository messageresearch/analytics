not only what he's done but where we're going with him amen it's just a wonderful thing who knows it may be our last thanksgiving here but we can give thanks to him every day amen amen praise the lord yes ma'am went home yesterday she's recovering well that's my aunt that had the hip surgery my aunt that had heart surgery she came out of surgery everything was fine in the middle of the night something happened and she went from being laughing joking everything okay to icu critical condition she had to be rushed back to or she died on the table the lord brought her back so just keep us in your prayer because we're still fighting she's here she's at downtown okay what's her name larry marie so somebody grab hold of sisters um aunt marie and hold that one to your heart amen anybody else have any other prayer requests hey man sorry i don't want to take up too much time but i've been meaning to give this testimony for a while i wasn't going to i was just going to let it go but my drive here i was listening to worship music and i was just crying the whole drive um um so i know at this point everybody here knows zach thanks to my dad um but um i met him a couple months ago in june and um getting to know him and visiting his church his church really like emphasizes receiving the new birth and you know um i kind of assumed i had it i went to a camp in a in 2014 and had an experience there and um i always thought that was like kind of referenced that day as the day that i'd gotten saved um but you know within the last two years nope and so um so um his family kind of um told me you know have you heard about this new camp in south carolina that um it's their first year um brother brother burley's camp and says first year doing it um i'd i've never been to camps i'm not one to put myself out there and go to camps or visit other churches um but this year i decided to go out of my comfort zone and you know see what happens because the last couple months um i've been very very sensitive to the word and i think god had been working on my heart the last six months and so i figured this might be exactly what i need so i went to the camp and the first night i believe it was brother um jason watkins that had preached the first night and as soon as i walked in there i could feel in the atmosphere you know that god was there and i knew some like i'm i was not going to leave that camp the same person and i didn't want to either so i prayed that you know with everything zach had been encouraging me with and you know he had been praying for me that i would receive the new birth as well so um throughout the camp the services were amazing the music was amazing and so that saturday night we walked in and i decided i had been praying god i i'm not leaving this building or this service tonight until i have it excuse me so um they announced there was going to be a prayer line and i decided i was going to be the first person in that prayer line and so i two hours went by just straight praying and crying and exhaust you know being exhausted just wanting to receive it and by the end of the service i knew like i had had it i had received a new birth and um i i still had been wondering why the last six months i was so sensitive to the word into preaching and even in here excuse me um and brother john andes was preaching and said that if that has been happening god will will bring in these labor contractions in your heart and even if it's through a course of a few days or weeks or months he's getting you closer and closer to receiving to to opening your heart to receiving the new birth and it just occurred to me that the last six months that i was so sensitive were those labor contractions getting me ready for that night that i received it so that's i just wanted to give that testimony [Laughter] [Applause] amen praise the lord amen yes sir yes sir this week tomorrow to twip up [Music] even though the pastor prayed last wednesday if you may receive a prayer success i would like for you all to pray to pray with our sisters i would like that the assembly may think of us in your prayers [Music] because we are leaving for about a whole week reports because when my wife was still living we had already made arrangement that we were supposed to go as a family to orlando florida florida uh thanksgiving anniversary because every thanksgiving is her birthday please so this 25th will be her 50th would have been her 50th birthday her jubilee [Music] program [Music] because we have already pre-arranged this before she passed away with other brethren we wanted to celebrate her 50th birthday even though she's not here we will still memory commemorate the that day for her and so that is my prayer that you all pray for us that everything goes well while we are thinking about her thank you amen amen and i think it might be good for y'all amen praise the lord anybody else i got one here to read yes sir brother sam the labor amen okay what's her name okay okay praise the lord i want to bring this up on i want y'all to remember me i've been having uh it's called a front hip pain it's it's you know kind of where your leg bends in the front and i you know you kind of google it and try to self um you know i got a i got an appointment with the va coming up in about a month and i'm going to bring it up that's not what the appointment's for but i'm going to bring it up but it's very painful google says it's osteoarthritis what does google know right everybody says google knows everything i don't think so god knows more he built this body and

musicians be all you know i tell you you pray for me there's different sunday mornings and versus wednesday but all is well because it's the same god is that right so we um thank the lord and brother sam's a blessing um uh of wednesday night then if i don't know that we would have switched i would grab you and switch with you but all is well was that right so um we asked you to turn your bibles to genesis we have three passages of scriptures that we're going to read from uh this morning just pray with me the lord's really been doing some great things for us i see what he's doing with the musicians you know continue to and those that are gifted and those that have songs in their hearts continue to bless us is that right okay i was truly blessed when i see our precious brother colleek don't stop on us now you came up here you always sing and sing to the glory of god is that right and everything that had breath praise the lord hallelujah genesis 22 and we'll read the 16 and 17th verse he says and said by myself have i sworn say the lord for because thou has done this thing and has not held thy son thy only son that is that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the saiyans which is upon the sea sure and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemy now we want you to keep that in mind we're going to go to galatians he was three and then we have three more passages the scriptures and then you can be uh seated appreciate your patience uh galatians 3 and 29 says and if ye be crisis then are ye abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise and over to the next uh chapter four and verse 23 it says be he who was of the but he who was of the bond woman was born after the flesh but he of the free woman by was by promise may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated just a little thought here we got the inspiration from um the uh scriptures uh i mean the messages possessing the gates of his enemy but it's after the trial after the trial you know we we're going to read something but the lord is going to take us to another level this morning because you didn't come to hear from a man you came to hear from him no one can call god set the audience this morning so he know what each and every one of us need the anointing is sweet brother john god is doing the things the devil don't like that it don't matter how good you can teach it no matter how good you can preach no matter if the anointing is not right when you walk out here you still have to fight these demons so we're talking about giving him the praises giving him the honor giving him the glory continue to go higher saints we're going to walk right on out of here just like enoch did is that right god bless you i try to do my best and stay slow i know we got the uh interpreter back there but y'all pray with me now we know that abraham had a promise but it was two seeds is that right it was a natural seed is that right and it was the royal seed it was a spiritual seed it was the faith seed and that's what i'm looking in this hour here now so don't think it's so far-fetched what the pastor the anointing that's on him to bring you to this level is that right this is the hour this is for it is that right this is going home time this is rapturing time um god have saved the best for last is that right he's telling us some is just seeing the messenger in the natural is that right all they see him is in the flesh but now paul said i pray without ceasing that you coming to the knowledge and the revelation and the wisdom and the understanding of our love the lord and savior jesus christ is that right the anointing that came in the last age was anointing of christ is that right christ was there then because christ identified him the difference in his age here now we got the signs we got the wonders we got things working with us is that right we're just in the beginning same son so god is going to be dealing with you in mighty ways but you got to humble yourself had the last time we was here and i saw the holy spirit was talking about it wednesday night we was talking about a faith that worketh by love and that was the incentive they worked together and that faith is i mean that love is not the affiliated love it's the agape love he's no one can call him the christ only but by the what by the holy ghost is that right so we're going to show you this morning we're going to knock everything out that the devil is trying to hinder that's why god thank you brother pray with me preach with me that's why we're talking about in this hour here now god send a message by a messenger malachi 4 luke 17 30 luke 17 30 and what did he say in revelation 19 his name was william marion branham is that right he was the only messenger that has seven letters and three names is that right perfection and completion we're talking about now living a victorious life we know abraham abraham was tried abraham he was tested is that right but he staggered not at the promises of god he knew that he could not god could not fail once god said something is that right so now we're talking about saying hold on every promise in the scriptures is yours you're talking about huh hallelujah you gotta hold me brother sam you talking about power i love that power that was in you wednesday night you talking about meekness huh it's power under control and i get loose sometimes you gotta pray for me huh hallelujah but if i come up here preaching like brother steve preaching like brother sam preaching like brother polycarp you're going to wonder if god called me to preach huh hallelujah that's right brother huh i can only be to see the way you put it in me i got no use for the devil and his behavior all he does is steal kill and destroy and we come to take back everything that's on pentecost you don't look like a message preacher to me you know what i asked him one time brother sir but click i said what is a message preacher huh huh i don't know about no pentecost i ain't got a pen because god brought me from the streets all i know when the fire come now i know what he's delivering me from i'm going to give him his praises i'm going to give him his honor i'm going to give him the glory possess the gates of your enemy after your trial after your test hallelujah we're talking saints hallelujah let me read abraham he knew that god gave him a promise look at genesis 15. and when he gave it to him he staggered not after he knew who it came from look what he says he says here i'll just read a few verses genesis 15 and verse 1. he says now these things the word of the lord came unto abram in the vision saying fear not see come from god why you got to fear anything if god told you something how are we going to move into something huh god didn't give us the spirit of faith for love peace joy in a way in a sound mind is that right you can stand on what is this does say the lord god vindicated that messenger you don't have to get caught up with the foolishness out there just ignore them is that right how you going to argue with something that's proven you want to see a spirit of or you see our spirit of a fool the spirit of a fool they're always trying to argue about something that's proven is that right huh don't like correction is that right huh that's the spirit of the food why are you talking about the spirit of a fool i'm not going to argue with them this is christ son no man can unfold those kind of things that being unfold that's christ back on the scene it was the son of man come now bringing the revelation to a son of man in the land look what he said he said the lord came amen his division saying fear not he said i am thy what god's your shield what are you worried about abraham didn't have to fail he didn't have to worry about none of those promises failing he got the word from the angels he said what he said i am your shield i am your fortress i am your buckler i am your refuge the name of the lord is a strong talent and the righteous run into it and are saved look what he says he says and thy exceedingly great reward look what he told them he said their neighbor said lord god what would thou give me seeing i go in the steward of my house this eliezer of damacus and abram said behold to me thou has given no seed and love one born in my house is my heir and behold the word of the lord came unto him the word of the lord that's what we're getting now the word of the lord and saying this shall not be thy air but he that shall come forth out of thy own bowel shall be thy ass now remember he already told me it's going to be two right abraham abram caught the revelation it's not what's going to be isaac that was going to be another seed is that right let us keep going he said now look but but he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward the heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and he believed in who in the lord and he counted it for for righteousness remember the holy spirit was just telling us how that faith work he believed that because he heard the god's word he received god's word and then second he had to do what he had to confess it is that right and then after you confess these things we're going to show you about speaking this word under the anointing of god it's no longer you as god using you working through you huh he says now look and he believed in the lord and he counted him on the righteousness let me read something for you before i get too far ahead i get if i got my timer up here don't worry about it and i'm going to read some things to you that the prophet said he said now look this is out of possessing the gates of the enemy after the trial i'm getting ready to hit you with something ah he said abraham belief patriarch stayed true to the promise he says and he give the he give the promise that you're seized because you believe my word and regardless of what the circumstances your seed shall possess the gate of its enemy you understand the condition something that you're struggling with has nothing to do with the conclusion in the promised word what god promised us is that right it's come to strengthen you it's come to move you closer to getting out of here is that right oh death where's thy saying what are we worrying about the devil for he's no good he's a defeated enemy is that right the blood of jesus christ we will share that on calvary the atonement paid for it see that's what happened to bellamy barack when he got around i'm just preaching now that's what happened to bellamy bettack when he got around in there he wanted to curse god's children and when he got there he wanted to curse god's children he got the word from god that's exactly right brother he's trying to do it he know being a prophet he couldn't move past the word of god so when he come down in there he's trying to persuade that try to persuade him because he's seen us growing in numbers so you know that you're growing you're maturing so the battle is getting heated up but that's all right when the enemy come in like a florida he would lift up a mighty standing against them huh he wanted to move he wanted to mess with god's people but he know he couldn't he said what balaam even testified himself but you know you can't curse what god is blessing is that right he can't curse you god has blessed you god chose you god called you god finishing the word he called you as overcomers in this age hallelujah huh we never switched that devil we getting ready to knock him out somebody's going to get set free somebody's going to get their salvation this morning i'm singleton good to see you huh hallelujah look what he says he says now he says that that possession help me lord he said the word and regardless of the circumstances your seed shall possess the gate of its enemy i don't have no board so you got to bear with me he said why every enemy that come up against abraham see the enemy of two old abraham didn't listen to him is that right because abraham had to be a type in the scriptures for us bride is that right he was going to show us that god had to change this body now he was going to change this body back into a young man again is that right he's staggering not at the promises of god so abraham knew that god said it as he told him over in genesis 15 he believed it he's standing on it and he's waiting for it to come to pass if it didn't come to pass that day the next day would be even greater and the next day would be even greater and the next day would be even greater why because god cannot lie is that right hallelujah look what he says he says then the two where he started the devil couldn't move him off of being too old he said he still stayed right true to that promise he said now no man that possesses that faith still will take now will take god's word regardless of the circumstances you see because now because he says give remember the world was framed by the word of god and so now he says now if you cannot do that getting ready to hit you if you cannot do that then you're not abraham sees you you're coming up to another level this morning huh huh this is what the lord he said huh this is what the lord spoke to your prophet look what he said this is for this age you want to see you're not just of royal blood just to say you're of royal blood huh you're a true vindicator royal blood you were in the mind of god before the foundation of the world our origin comes from heaven don't look at what you're struggling with don't look at your condition your origin is from heaven we come from god we go back to god we feel thank god for what he did we looking for the rapture to come but we having a good time right now is that right in the world of god because the word is being revealed because the joy of the lord is my strength hallelujah don't worry well let me finish reading hallelujah he said look what he said he said now you say right truth to the promise he said now if you cannot do that then you're not abraham seeks he said now remember there's always a mixed multitude huh does it make small truth why i think the holy spirit put up there about with uh brother branham you got the cardinal minded the spiritual minded and you got division huh because all some of them see it's just a man see they got to realize it's twofold if he say they came in with a man with uh uh daniel right when they worship daniel they're gonna leave out with a man what works in the pope is that right you got two spirits in the message too is that right there's always two c's you got the sons of god which come from god and the spirit of god and you got the sons of the prophet is that right and who's ever streamlined and go tell them yeah you said it because god gave me grace to set it you know why he gave me grace to say it because he's told us he's assigned us to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints is that right you're trying to twist the word you're trying to take away the five-fold ministry you're trying to mess around with the ministry that god has put here it's jesus christ and all he's doing is getting the pastors getting himself out of the way and let god use the gift that he saved for the end time is that right he said father why do we buy him we're not bothering anyone we're just spreading our love is that right he said father when they came down from that transfiguration he took faith hope and charity up there when it came down from now transfiguration he said father they're casting out devils in that name they hear the sick in thy name he said well if they're not against you well let me do what let them be huh hallelujah jump on the bear wagon religious demons oh my see i'm telling you now we was in that prison y'all need to go to the jails in the prison that's why i tell when i say brother abel when i first came here i said pray for me i need a lot of prayer because when i came i'm used to just laying it out there hitting them demons because if a man leave out if a man leaves out of that jail or that prison if he don't get the holy ghost before he leaves there he may not make it back he may not get the grace of god delivered it to him at that time so this is no time to be playing with the devil that god told us everything shall be done everything everything shall be crossed every eye shall be dot everything that's hidden is going to be uncovered is that right god's bringing a word and revealing his word and what revealing hidden and revealing his simplicity is that right and it's hid the same way hidden in simplicity and revealing it the same way it's going right over their heads is that right you got to make a decision it's it's checking it up time saints huh we're looking for greater things to come they say the rapture going to take place we're looking for the rapture only thing going in the rapture is perfect love in the pure unadulterated word is that right hallelujah look what he said oh help us he said now he said now you can do that he says that's the faith that abraham had his seat amen oh boy he said now the promise of abraham was that his seat now his royal seat that's us see there's the royal seat he said that came help me lord his royal seed as i told you a while ago and this seal that he give abraham was a seal of promise he says and the royal seed according to ephesians 4 and 30 what grieve not what the holy spirit of god which by you are what sealed until the day of your redemption he said now is the sealed by the holy ghost after they stood the test see they tried to now you think of it many think they got the holy ghost many claim to have the holy ghost he said but many can show many evidence and signs of it but still if it can't say if it can't stay with this word it's not the holy ghost [Music] self-examination huh the holy ghost is not going to dwell in any any kind of temple the spirit of god is not going to dwell there i don't care what you can get out there and manufacture and fake this and fake that but if you can't receive the message for your day now it is not just receiving it it's the manifestation of the word for your day these signs shall follow them that believe see that's what happened with balaam and baylor the difference when they came in remember balaam i mean bay back he called them some demons is that right those princesses those princesses were chief demons they were kings they were rulers they were leaders god told us in his end time we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and wickedness and rulers we're at in high places this is an organized army of satan but you know what there's no weapons gonna fall against and prosper against his end-time message because god came and turned over every hidden thing that satan had then that religious demon is that right he would give us the first seal the second seal the third seal and the fourth seal is that right look at the grace that's been extended enough it was no more right as that to the fourth huh god extended his grace he saved all this this this until this time because he know he had a seed in this age here he has some we had someone that he has chosen to go and finish this plan of redemption the holy ghost came so that you can become one with god you can become partnership with god again you can finish this redemptive plan of work with god is that right we will let me keep reading i don't want to get too far ahead i want you to see this by god's grace if he help me he said now look he says many of them they got think they got the holy ghost many claim to have the holy ghost he says many can can show many evidence in the signs but it's still if you can't stay with the word it's not the holy ghost he says you believe every word then you are sealed after the test see how simple it is huh see how simple it is see sin is what just unbelief he said god said man should not live by bread alone but by what every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord is that right all of it has to do with god said it i believe it that's it close the book dance shout praise the lord go about rejoicing at what the lord said look at here he said now look he says when when we believe every promise in the word see then we are sealed by the spirit to confirm the promise he says no that's why he said what put on the whole armor of god when you put on the whole arm of god so that you may be able to do what withstand the devil's trickery in this end time and the word of god is the word of god that god has sent this hour here which is anointed by the spirit of god when the spirit of god anoints the message of the hour satan recognizes it and he know he can't touch it so when he come down and put on the helmet of what salvation is that right put on the breastplate of what righteousness is that right put on the shield of what faith going to learn with what truth is that right put a preparation of the what gospel of peace upon your feet is that right yeah i'm telling you saints it's not hard it's easy all you have to do as the holy spirit was saying wins wednesday night build up thy most holy face doing what praying in the holy ghost is that right when you're in there praying don't think that your prayer is not being reached your prayer is being reached your prayer is accomplishing what it accomplished it's just by faith you got to realize every time he said god said what you're buying on earth i was abing in heaven what you loose on earth shall be loose in heaven you have been given the authority saints huh against satan's kingdom so we're fighting a defeated enemy is that right he's afraid of you when you walk in the place you recognize the anointing that's on you what he don't want you to do is speak the word if you speak the word it's going to accomplish what it's going to accomplish is that right well that's just a family that testimony with that lady with that baby is that right huh that was god using you because he vindicates his word [Music] god does it he said look help me lord he said you believe he said you believe every word he says then you are sealed after the test when you we believe every promise in the word then we are sealed by the spirit he said to confirm the promise he says that's what it's what abraham the way he did it then the only the thin only have we the right to possess the gates of the enemy let me slow down right there that's the only way you got the right to possess the gates of the enemy if you believe in every word that a promise that god has given you is that right god will bring it to pass when he sees fit to bring it to pass you just keep testifying remember that brother noah forget his name the brother that was in fort wayne um indiana we just took our son there and i was listening to that message and i saw what brother branham said oh fort wayne indiana was it and i think and we got there and the brother i can't remember his name but he went to the meeting and he was a catholic and he didn't have what we had he was a catholic and when he got around in there he heard about the holy ghost meeting is that right when he heard about the holy ghost meeting he see he went to the meeting and when he went there brother branham prayed for him and when he prayed for him he got around there he told him you were healed your eyes will be open is that right i'm just paraphrasing it and then after he got there and said his eyes was open the man went out he went out and he couldn't see he said he came back later on back in the prayer line he said he was still blind is that right he said what you you told me i was going to be able to sing he said what he said now i told you told me that you believed and why you come back up here he said just go on doing what testifying that he can see that's right brother sam speak the word testify it god have to bring it to pass if you believe it god will bend it that's what he said brother ah extra extra i can see i can see it didn't happen that day it didn't happen that week it didn't happen that month it was after a month then it happened to him and where is the worst place you can be to want to look like a oddball is in the barber shop is that right they talk about it see i don't go to the barber shop i ain't been in the barber shop yes you can go to the barber shop i can afford to go to the barber shop and go to the barbershop i already know where my hair comes i know where my hair went and i know where it's at and i know i'm gonna get it back so i just cut it off and just come over like is that right cut it off and come on up in there i got a wife we've been married 46 years looking for no woman let me tell you around there now but when you get around in there and you start talking about men talk you go in the barber shop around a bunch of men huh talking about women gossip oh oh you get around in there right and he went in that barber shop and he started praising the lord i can see i can see i can see and you know they was mocking him is that right he said the man had the razor in his hand and right in the chair it says eyes popped open is that right his eyes popped open he said he ran out the out the barber's chair and ran down the street and start praising the lord giving god the glory you don't have to be ashamed of when you're waiting on deliverance from something just keep testifying keep testifying keep testifying keep testifying keep testifying sure the challenge is going to be there so it's going to be there but god gave you a promise if god said it is going to happen in his time he said look he said now and then we are sealed by the spirit to confirm the promise he says that's what abraham then and then only we had the right to possess the gate of our enemy he said you cannot do it until you reverse you become that seat let it sink in let it sink in baby we might want to mute this i want nobody out there that's the uh for the gospel see you you say you must be what born again born again that means you had to come from god to go from god that seed inside of you had to be germinated seed it has to have a life there inside that life has to be there and god put that there what before the foundation of the world see that's why balaam couldn't do nothing to israel because they forgot about the brazen serpent that was there in the wilderness they forgot about the atonement that god had made for israel sure they didn't know israel got in the mess sure they were doing things they wasn't supposed to be doing but god did what he slew a lamb of god before the foundation of the world you can always look to the cross look to the cross look into the hill to where my strength and my help come from at the cross at the cross where i first saw the life and the burdens of my world away and was there by what faith and i received my what sight and now i'm what happy win all the day why because your salvation has already been paid for when he asks you paul asked him have you received the holy ghost since you believed he wasn't de-christianizing anyone he wasn't taking anything away from him jesus already paid for that huh he just as you have ye received the holy ghost since you believe see that's baptist doctrine is that right he said no we have not yet what heard of any holy ghost then they told me they had to get what re-baptized those that haven't been baptized you have to repent be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost it's a promise unto you and your children you're not going to get out of here without the holy ghost is that right i heard the pastor when he came up last time we ministered he went to romans 5 and 5. and he was just showing him there so we got to understand why did the lord put that on on his heart because he was showing us now that the love of god the only love that you're going to be able to produce that works with your faith it has to be the baptism of the holy ghost is that right it got to be hallelujah help me lord see where we at he said now look he says now he says now now you notice here we're talking about natural seats we're talking about abraham abraham abraham and they were there they were the natural seed of god abraham was a powerful man propheter in his time but abraham was up there of the natural seed is that right let's look at now daniel i'm just going to come as they come to me look at daniel daniel was a prophet is that right but daniel was a powerful man and he would stood the test is that right he possessed the gates of his enemy after the trial is that right we want to possess the gates of the enemy but you're going to have your tests you're going to have your trials and abraham and i mean in daniel he would stood it with the lion's den is that right so when they put him in there and that lions then then daniel they tried to make a decree they made a law see they're going to start making laws against us to bring pressure against us i heard the holy spirit say wednesday night you have to understand that the catholic church is already in position they're already there it's just a matter of time our three leading financial institutions in america has to report to the pope once a year they're getting these things lined up the prophet of god already told us these things who have believed our report and to whom has the arm the power of the lord been revealed to you only get the revealing comes to you when you believe all the word and the only one can unfold it to you the only one can grant you the holy ghost is god he knows if you really believe all the word so daniel what stood the test is that right how about shadrach meshach and abednego is that right they was mighty men of god they're our brothers we're going to see them we're going to ask daniel what happened in the lions then when we see him ah we're going to ask sharack meshach and the bendigo what is it is that right but shattered be shack and have indigo there was young men just like y'all they wanted to try to get you to bow down but the world out there recognizes something inside of you there's something inside of you children they know that it's a different character they know it's a different anointing they recognize as something different even your dress code is bringing them to a conviction is that right don't look at the mirror if you look at your nose and you don't like your nose leave it alone if you don't like your ear leave it alone if you don't like your lips leave it alone if you don't like your skin leave it alone god don't make no mistakes god made you that way for a purpose is that right when they come in there so we got to understand shadrach meshach and abednego mighty men brother sam they were mighty men to god he would stood the fire they did what put them in the fire is that right when they put them in the fire seven times greater not even the smoke got on them that was showing us a supernatural god we serve a supernatural god look what he said when he got there oh it looked great don't it yes they did i'm brother abel he got around in there but he said i thought i've seen three in there but i seen what a fourth one huh he looked like what the son of god he come around in there the angel of the lord came down in the test time why because god the word is bringing you through the test it's for his glory for his praises for his honor we worshipping him that's what he brought us here for now we got over there right meshech and the bendigo they were powerful men in their times you know but we have to realize do you know what they're going to see you know what they're going to ask you they're going to say brother khalid yeah what age did you come out of ah it was in what age did you come out of huh they say wait a minute brother charles on saturday shack and have been the goat gonna say i appreciate you wanting to know my testimony but you came out of laodicea tell me how you made it through layered the fields with 200 million demons loose there what do you want to say by the grace of god they want to know all these demons loose and god's keeping you god's watching over you huh huh you are a mighty god hallelujah tell me lord look what he said he said no lord he said you look at moses mighty great men joshua keller joshua came in joshua a mighty warrior in his time but joshua was there the natural seeds when they come around in there and joshua he told joshua joshua knew he had a word from god he said moses is dead my servant is dead as i was with moses so shall i be with you he said every other souls i tell you what look at this it turned to joshua 1 and 3. i want you to see this hallelujah help me lord thank you jesus i told you the devil know you're in trouble this morning somebody getting set free that's what i like because jesus set us free he said you're free and you're free indeed hallelujah to do the work of the lord look what he says hallelujah he says joshua 1 1 2 3. he says now after the after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nun moses minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this jordan he says now all these people jordan he says unto the land which i do do what give to them even to the children of israel he says every place that the what of your what so trade upon right that have i what as i said unto who but he said what that's not there but you're going to have to fight for every inch of it after the test how are we fighting you're fighting a spiritual war it's a spiritual battle pray read your bible when you pray you read your bible and when the enemy come in like a flood god will resurrect the word that's already there that's already inside of you he will speak it through you how do you guys i'm telling you saints we're living below our standards don't be afraid to take god at his word speak the word if you got a husband that's struggling speak the word if you got a wife that's struggling speak the word if you got a child that's struggling speak the word if you got a worker that's struggling speak the word if you know you got a troubling in your flesh a migraine headache or something speak the words if you got an author that tried to get on you and again you know when i used to work and i was busting this whole leg up by the colleen i was a rock man too like you were the rock man huh and that thing got the acting up is that right they said brother what happened to you got arthur i said no after who you get around i said after you i keep getting on moving giving god the glory what do you say angelo lord i command my feet to praise the lord i command my hands to praise the lord i command my voice to praise the lord you never see me later on when i start singing a song he never failed me yet he never failed me yet jesus christ never fail me and everywhere i go and all of a sudden [Applause] [Music] lord i want to give you the glory i want to be able to dance for you i want to be able to praise you lord i need your spirit to come down on me lord don't tell me he's not real our god is real huh look what he says he was a natural seed joshua look what he says in verse four he was dropping verse five he said there shall not any man be able to do what before thee all the what what's the difference same holy spirit this is joshua minister hun brother polycarp keep on preaching that faith brother huh this is the hour for it you're going to get on there faith and love encourages one another come on you see nothing no demons could be able to stand before them those are these are organized demons they plot and they know who you are is that right but once the once you get the holy spirit inside of your life is that right oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy victory glory be to god look what he told him help me lord he said there shall not any man able to stand before thee all the days of thy life i was with who moses and i will be with thee he says will and i will what oh what ah huh huh what are we worried about god's saying this the same word that he had there that's why i remember he says where is the god of elijah we want the same god the difference between when balak and bala and moses see brother branham said he said the problem was with balaam he was jealous of moses that's a rough demon go dig into the message you'll see what he said he said when he came around there these demons are still here is that right we have to understand the forces that you're fighting against so once they recognize that's what happened to the young rich ruler when the young rich ruler saw jesus okay he had what religion he did not have his salvation but he had all those other things great riches and things and he kept the 10 commandments but when he saw jesus he saw a character that he did not have you young ladies don't be conformed to the world your father said be ye not conformed to this world but be what transformed by the renewing of your mind is that paul said i beseech you brethren by the way by the mercies of god never forget the mercies of god that's been extended to us someone out there we are not to conform to the world they see something different inside of you that they're thirsting for we got the goods because we know every human being was created to be in the image of god when they were there to be in the image of god so we know that they're really thirsting for god now we're just looking for that open door to tell them about jesus to tell them about the goodness of the lord i heard brother brown even say oh do all that you can for someone out there because don't let them come down to hell don't let them you don't want them to go to that place so we doing all we can is just to so souls can we can become salty so they can desire what we have saints what you're getting now god is just unfolding the mysteries into his special bride because you're hungry and thirsting and the scripture has to be fulfilled is that right so the difference between balaam and balak bellam what he had balaam was jealous because moses was the messenger on the scene at the time but moses had the signs and wonders following them they had the vindication the vindication has to be here so when those that last time we were here we were saying they were bowing down at their feet of faith that worketh by love with that love that has been working they ran they bowed down at their feet they humbled yourself but what god is calling for us to do in this age not to run and bow down at a man's feet or not to do it in that type of work but he want us once we receive the holy spirit it's your character it's a lived life is what he's requiring from us in this time now so you don't have to worry if you stumble if you stumble here if you stumble there but what you have to realize you can always look unto the cross remember what the blood of jesus christ have done for you that's why he put up that brazen serpent for israel in the wilderness so they can always look and believe on the cross it was a type is that right it was a type of over there when abraham when his test came when he had to slew isaac and even after 25 years and god told him to go through isaac which god don't tell us to do those things anymore but god he had the slew isaac but he was but it was a type of him going to that mountain as christ going to calvary for you and i as we were in the mind of him before the foundation of the world we were at calvary also so we have to understand what god is bringing us into now to finish the plan of redemption always looking for that lost soul no matter where you're at you're out there we know where we come from we know where we're going we know we're going in the rapture is that right god promised it according to the scriptures let me keep reading i want you to see this here help me lord he said now look but he told them verse 6 be strong and be of a good courage for unto this people shall thou divine for an inheritance the land which i swear unto thee father to give verse 8 he said this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall what meditate therein day and night and thou mayest do what observe doing according to that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy way what you want to know why some of you struggling what is it that you're not doing god god promised that you should you could ask abundantly also if you're not asking in a selfish motive you can also you can get why aren't you prospering you see if god now is is that the perfect willing for you did you ask god he i send a quote to a brother one time and i was saying you want to see a real christian that's successful a real christian that's a housewife a worker no matter what they are they'll always seek christ first so then if it doesn't work lord now you gave me this that's why the last time when we was here remember the widow woman when a child dies she went to elijah is that right [Music] he said that's what she said you get by his grace but he knew a woman still want a child being a mother is a female she want a child but if you really down inside you want that child is that right start getting things ready get the crib ready go buy the clothes on if you get a little later in years go buy twins buy something for twins is that right lose the frightful because why because god's promised you that you should not be unfruitful or burned you got right bring it to god she went she ran take him to that level saints we're living every promise in the scriptures is done i'm trying to talk to them he says turn psalms 103. holy holy let me finish reading this in 9. let me finish reading 9. he says to prosper then thou shalt have good what you going to college but y'all hearing the college asking for the best job there is don't answer no 30 000 job ask for six digits what's wrong with it let me know your standards god know your motive god know you ex um is your motive and objective i talked to him i said i didn't talk to him trying to spear one day very mature young man sure he can handle that huh you gotta understand what you you're living below your standards huh some of y'all come all the way from over the water huh you come from over the world and fail no no no no no no no no no no no none of god's children are failures you're over achieving is that right your achievement is that right you got to look unto the heel he said ask and ask abundantly you know what ask for it what do you say ask and it shall be what seek you shall find knock and then shall what be open white people don't have western what's the first letter and ask ah where's the first letter and seek what's the first letter in knock [Music] you have not because yes not yes not because your motive ain't right look what he says he says now he says have not i commanded thee be strong a commandment he said be strong and of good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord god is with thee whistle ever thou goeth turn to psalm 103. one of my favorites let me get this water psalms 103. do you have it help me lord he said now look here my favorite scriptures there in in the bible i tell you we have to stop living below our standards he said now look you don't claim nothing in this age you don't have to claim it look at it he says bless the lord oh my what and all that is what bless his what why this holy day in the name of jesus in the name of jesus we have a victory oh in the name of jesus in the name of jesus you have to flee why know what they say oh tell me who can stand me for us when we call on his great name what is jesus it shakes the kingdom takes the kingdom prove it then the demons they had that man cutting him have it in the tombstone had him in the graveyard having killed trying to kill him throwing him in the fire when they saw jesus was coming they said one always calls it all the fuss first one look for mercy run in jesus then the holy spirit tell us even the devil don't want to go to hell the demons don't want to go to hell always running looking for mercy call in the name of jesus when you're praying buying them demons up buying them up in the name of jesus christ that holy name look what he says he said bless the lord o my soul and forget not what this is the only age you got all the benefits all the benefits the book is open ah the book is open what the holy spirit said the other week he said we got an open book test isn't that right huh if your fellow open book there's something wrong huh let me keep going he said look he said forget not all his benefits now you see why i said you don't have to claim a headache you don't have to claim if you if you if you don't have to say you don't have a vehicle you need a vehicle ask the lord for a vehicle make sure the vehicle is for the glory of god you'll need some shoes ask the lord for some shoes is that right you'll need a coat that's the lord for a coat if you need help about saving your money ask the lord to help you save your money stop spending your money righteously is that right if you got an elbow problem ask god to help you with the elbow problem is that right you got to ask him for these things just ask the lord you have all the benefits in this hour here now hallelujah look what he says he says forgive forgive us all thy what iniquity who healed of all thy what all thy what oh i tell you i know kobe got there but you know everybody you passed the test when the devil tried to flick your flesh and thought he had you right but he did what but you pleaded the blood of jesus christ on them look at you now you possess the gates of the enemy after the child hallelujah don't tell me about nikoi huh yeah i know he's out there why would you talk you believe this message probably god told us about this way before it was gonna come pledge was coming didn't he tell us that he said so i'm gonna have the mask he said he he said something's gonna run in the house and put it on he said something's gonna have to disinfect huh huh yeah that's right huh some of them are gonna have he said some of them said they're gonna go in the mountains they could run into a cave ain't that what he said huh he told us these things the prophet of god warned us these things he said some of them going who's going to run the doctor fuji fruits is that right of course the prophet said dr jones in there but they run to dr fousey and ain't that right how he told us all these things he told us all these things before he came here huh you're in the right place huh you're in the right place you know that's why i was telling you last time we was here the doctor was sitting there with my wife and i went to the doctor he said have you had your shots i didn't look up because i wasn't a patient you know i was on my phone she was sitting there said miss kelly and i said no she said oh no don't you know that uh people were dying and things that happened i looked them i said doc let me tell you something you're wrong now i said let me tell you something first of all the american people when we were little we had no problems getting shots i said but you're trying to force something on people huh you're trying to force something on people that's not proven doc and he looked at me and that's when he backed up why because they know i thought about samson and delilah anything that is persistent that's not according to the words it's the sequel you gotta you got you gotta you you you you got to understand what's going on don't be afraid why because the prophet of god told me this was going to happen before it happened and he gave me the solution he said you gotta know before you can have a cure you gotta know the cause is that right he know because it is sinful life america and the world have dropped their moral stand nuts and there's no coming back for them but he told us what's the solution he said it's all under the what the blood put it up under the blood the blood today is the baptism of the holy ghost saints the life is in the blood and you can look them in their eyes is that right because you're the apple of god's eye god is going to keep and keep an eye out for his apple is that right you don't have to receive anything that doesn't line up with the word of god let me keep going hallelujah look what he says he says now who redeemeth he said who healeth all thy diseases all dies diseases don't you let nobody try to say you afflict you with anything and they come with you speak the word you can get hit sick you can get sick and get healed you can get sick again but you keep claiming the blood of jesus christ and what god has done for you don't ever back up because you got a scripture right there you say lord in psalms 103 you say you are the lord god that you heal of all thy diseases and you can't move until i speak it and lord i spoke the word and now you're the healer it's your faith lord let me look what he says he says now help me lord he says who who redeemed thy life from what how many of us was out there living that sinful life huh and the lord watched on me he said i watched over you even when you was yet in your sins you see you gotta you gotta stand with staying the test okay because your test is coming little children you go to school teachers say you got a test on friday you only you only shake it if you didn't do your homework you ain't doing your homework you didn't study see everybody get around any way you could get around the boy you try to get around it but all you don't know what to do next time though don't you huh hallelujah help me lord he said now look he says who redeemed thy life from destruction who crown of thee with what and what i just want you to say to see these things he says who satisfy thy mouth with what good things so that thy youth is what renewed like eagles so that's why when the holy spirit was telling the pastor he says what blessings come from our mouths not curses blessings come from our mouth you know when the lord you know you got to know and how the lord deals with you when we get in there we was fellowshipping the place one time but charles i believe the lord wanted you to be here this morning david you want to put that up there for me david we had some influential brothers good brothers we were staying in the place and they told me i didn't have to go if i would yeah i had i didn't have to go and i told him i said yeah the lord told me i gotta go we had to leave our house had a little moved into a small place moved to the northeast up in pennsylvania he said i said yeah i gotta go we went there i don't know we got about three different pictures there i don't know if you can see that real good but to see the gentleman in the white shirt stand up about y'alls that was brother charles that's who the lord had sent me after and we stayed up there for five years that's his father that's his uncle sister sarah is not here and we had a little pool in there i don't know if that one david show you where we're baptizing them at and we're baptized you know where that little trough was at that was right in my front room that old door as soon as that door right there you go outside as soon as you come in the door you're in the front room and we were right there we put that trough in there we filled it up with water and we went up there for four or five years had to stay for five years i didn't know brother charles was there but i know the lord was sending me and so you got to understand god will test you god will tried you but he will not forget the faithful and we went up there and we were baptizing them and we worked there and when we sat there i never forget we went to that business brother charles was just sitting there by himself and something pricked my heart when i first saw him but i'm showing you every god is going to try and test you and you don't know where he'll send you in but he'll send you that's the club that's my time i don't know if you have time to show those other ones david but uh can you see it clear i mean that's brother charles on the right i said the white that's me and the white shirt that's brother charles on the right side we're getting that wrong but i say that and so when we came back he was a young fella and he was a young face still a young fellow to me when he came back there and and oh boy i didn't realize i realized it been that long but uh i'm glad i had a chance to show that but you know i say that because every test but it's a testimony that comes after that test if god send you to do something god will vindicate it and that was the difference with moses and with balaam and balak moses had god with him and god was vindicating that he was with him and so that's the reason why if you down in her soul there's always a burning desire for those lost souls that's there with that true believer now true believer no matter what something and god put a seed inside of you and if you just pray and whatever he whatever he sent you here to do but one of the things he sent all of us to do is to become co-workers with him and we finish this plan of redemption boy i'll tell you before i before let's turn to um uh first peter let's turn to first peter and god help me chapter two first peter chapter two in musicians you can come forward he says unto you therefore which believe he is precious he says amen did i get am i right okay verse nine i'm sorry verse nine first peter chapter two verse nine but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people he says that ye should show forth one of who who have what out of what into his what i tell you saints those praises and that's what the holy spirit is ministering through the pastor is words of blessing sweet and bitter water cannot come out of the same fount the royal seed everyone in the natural seed had to die but the royal seized you're the royal sea i'm not even worthy i'm not even worthy to stand up here before you you have been bought that's right brother abel you have been bought by the blood of god that's right brother the blood of god and it even came down because he no man was worthy the angels wanted to come but he said no i can't send an angel after you i gotta come myself he got in the body created that seed and that egg he said that's why i said i would not leave my what holy one my holy one should not seek corruption and whether i will not leave them where in hell is that right leave his body in hell you can go to psalms 16 10 16 and verse 10 i think he worked it in there he said i wasn't going to do it so when christ came got in that body he formed that seed he knew all of our infirmities he know what each and every one of us is going through but we you are the royal seed of abraham you don't have to claim nothing they had to die in the old testament mighty men of god conquered what god sent them to do but it was two seas abraham caught the revelation when god told him to look in the skies see the stars he knew it was going to be a royal scene a faith seed that had to come but this seed all we have to do is walk in it claim it walk in it brother the revelation brother polly carty giving you a faith keep ministering brother sam you labored you labored you labored god said he will not forget the faithful we love you brother thank god for being with us [Music] just be the way he made you but if you see someone that's struggling tell them about the mighty conqueror tell them about the one who could deliver you from drugs deliver you from drinking deliver you from smoking delivering you from pornography delivering you from cussing deliver you from your temper deliver you from your pride [Music] the mighty conqueror the faith seed the royal sea we just walk right in it is ours we don't have to die jesus died for us we were in his mind upon that cross too [Music] god said our origin is not here we're pilgrims and strangers you're of a royal family roll your blood so that's not the last one you'll make somebody day in that hospital why the guys are you sisters remember when the lady came there with a baby and they were sitting out there [Music] and the lady watched her she gave her a seat yeah you can see that but she said sister can i pray for you sisters is in you she said can i pray for you she said yes she came to the prayer line with brother branham [Music] and when she came there he wanted a prayer for a baby [Music] she knew that when it came there she said sister it was a lady that was up in the balcony she gave you her seat she was sitting next to you she already prayed for you your baby's already healed your prayers it's just like jesus prayers [Music] i don't have time to go to go to john 17. you are a royal seed what you're buying on earth shall be buying in heaven what you loose on earth shall be loosened in heaven [Music] simple but powerful [Music] you can set someone free that's right brother your words if you go on into the message i don't have time to go no but if you look going and go back and looking at possessing the gates of the enemy after your trial after your test you don't pass it well it's coming again don't pass it it's coming again see there's two seeds remember we're always the sun remember when we put on the royal garments they talked about the prophecy i remember the lord had the pastor work that with the royal garments in those royal garments when they started with hillary but it wasn't hillary but it was uh a harris and she had on her royal garments and was here in the royal garments we know that the prophecy was being fulfilled but what the lord showed me when brother branham also said when this message of adoption it was two sons and one of his brother was always a son but one of them got the royal garment because he was obedient until the word of god he had just as right as the father but what that show me now it was time for us to step up and be all put on our royal garments we're living below our standards start moving into what god has given us in this hour here now somebody i was in if some of you were in certain positions might be there maybe on your job or whatever stop running [Music] you know what god calling you to do [Music] i don't know who it's for but for somebody now step into your royal garments that faith is no longer your faith it's his faith he's working it through you let us bow our heads [Music] lord god it was like a shotgun
