amen does anyone have a prayer request on their heart this evening or a testimony amen well i have a testimony and it's it's not um something that happened recently it was something that happened when i was younger and uh the story kind of came up today my wife was asking me about it and after i got done telling her about it i thought about i was like man this is this is a testimony and i don't really share it much but i'm like i should share it more because god you know god has done a lot of great things for me but um one day when i was like 15 16 years old i was working outside and i was weeding a yard and there was a thunderstorm and i was trying to get done before the thunderstorm before it got worse and it was it was there i mean i was in florida and a lightning bolt struck the ground beside me and it shocked me it shocked the weedier and i felt electrocuted and i shook and i dropped the weed eater and i i ran i went up to the guy i was working for he saw it he said he saw me get struck like he saw me get shocked and he asked me if i was okay and i told him i was fine he told me to go to the truck so i waited in the truck for him and we loaded up and left but my wife just mentioned that somebody was somebody died recently from a lightning strike and i thought like you know that bolt was so close to me but yet it just missed me by so much and it i felt the effects of it but god protected me and that that could have been my last day but it wasn't and i just wanted to thank the lord for that i know something in the past but god is god is god and he uh he was keeping me in that situation so i'm thankful for it [Applause] the pressure was higher was 168 over 128. question [Music] was changing i gave you the power uh at night about 2 a.m in the morning i felt this happen and i was sweating j regarded and i looked on it and it went all the way down 10 over 4. 100 before excuse me and i said this is way too low it has to come back a little bit higher this is almost close to death [Music] a amen angelo i wonder if you can come pray for us yes sir god we just want to thank you for giving us a brand new day jesus christ for giving us the opportunity

tonight uh by god's grace and mercy i tell you we just thank the lord amen amen everyone feeling good okay well we got something that's going to knock the devil out okay okay the lord has given us grace to go into our area to where next time when you come in here brother abel he will have greater support is that right you'll see where the last time we was here we was working with we're meditating is that right but you know the lord kind of brought something to my remembrance so we got to take a another step in the same area but we want you to look what the lord has given us on tonight you have in matthew 6 and verse 3 verse 24 and 25 once you have it say amen so we're going to go ahead and get the movement because we have a lot of food tonight amen he says no man can serve two masters for neither he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve god and mammoth you can't serve god in the riches of this world is that right verse 25 he says therefore now we're going to be coming out of 25 and some other scriptures he says therefore i say unto you take no what thought for your life see what what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink nor yet for your body what ye shall put on it is not not the light it's not the life more than meat and the body then raiment amen and let's turn to mark chapter 10 and we'll just look at this last scripture and then you may be seated uh just just look at uh verse 27. you have it say amen and jesus looking upon them said with men it is impossible but not with god for with god all things are possible may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated you know tonight we want to look at who thought i was just looking at a message but the thought came to me was a mental attitude you look at mental attitude you know we know satan you know god and we hear this i heard this numerous times some of you have been around a message for a while you've heard us numerous time your attitude you know your attitudes determine what direction that you're going in but you know we want to look at that you know our prophet he kind of went in a little more about this attitude this mental attitude you say it's more than what you think it is you see we have to recognize in this hour here now that you are the victorious you are the overcomers we're going to read we got a lot more quotes better rather than what i normally read but we're going to read it tonight is that right because we're coming in god give me grace and i don't want to miss the opportunity to bless his precious children is that right because we're going to knock the devil out tonight is that right every time god brings something to us we come ahead and knock the devil out so we can grow closer and closer to god is that right it's not by power it's not by might but it's by his spirit say the lord see i want to look at this one quote here it came out of blind with barnabas it says think um if this is if you're writing it down and those that are home if you're writing it down you get your pen and your pencil tonight because i'ma read a a lot of quotes and scriptures i want to take my time and not normally preach like i normally do unless the holy spirit takes me off then i will but uh it says think on these things that's positive what we have what we've given it should never be nothing negative come out of your mouth say devil in trouble tonight yeah he in trouble tonight he said now look he says think on things that's positive never let a negative thought pass through just or don't let it stop anyhow you know don't let it stop cast down any imagination and try to exhort itself against the word of god anything that comes across your brain that tried to come higher than the word of god cast it down challenge it rebuke it you have no right he said look at it he said if and anyhow if it starts true keep your thoughts what positive jesus don't think it says just because they're sitting out there just because you're sitting out there when you came through that door maybe you had an issue we all did is that right and many afflictions come upon the righteous is that right but the lord the promise deliver us out of them all is that right so when you come to an then you come to get refilled is that right will you come to get a refilling when you come here into the house of the lord the lord is doing some great things for us in here so when you come through that door is that right we know maybe you're troubling with a migraine maybe you're troubling with a bill maybe you're troubling you with your transportation maybe you're troubling with your finances but the lord is what he's going to take care of is always that right you've never seen the righteous forsaken or is she begging for bread every promise in the word belongs to us in this hour mental attitude he said now look the mental admittance relating to the mind intellectual it executes or performed by the mind that's dealing with your mind is that right we know a car is all right to start then but you cannot let it stay there is that right it has to drop down into the heart is that right so as a man think of in his heart so is he hallelujah i try to slow it down brother forgive me i forgot you back there hallelujah he said now look hallelujah it says all relating to the total emotional and intellectual response for an individual to his environment so now remember the prophet that god taught us um brother steve he said perfect faith has control over every situation [Applause] every situation we should have control over you see because he teaches us to be slow to speak quick to listen slow to wrath is that right hallelujah i tell you he's in trouble tonight he said now look it says to know jesus christ as your redeemer in all situations is that right you know jesus christ in all situations god has given us the revelation of the seven compound redemptive names is that right hallelujah that's what he's giving us and i'm telling you somebody's going to get something real good you know why i won't say what it is but i was praying today brother steve i was praying for that individual today and god brought him here tonight [Applause] thank you jesus he said now look the attitude the attitude runs into the mind to add it to a mental feeling or emotion toward a fact or state of a mental position now and then the other one i'm going to look at is conditions you'll see why i'm looking at i'm going to read to you the definition of conditions it's stipulation it's a covenant it's a state of affairs that must exist or be bought about before something else is possibly or permitted here with me hallelujah look what can happen to you i'm just going to read a few things if you worry worrying that scripture means be anxious be anxious for nothing you get a spirit of anxiety on you you'll be running thinking 100 miles an hour and the prophet of god said you'll be way ahead of yourself and you'll never get it done anyway isn't that right all you're doing is opening yourself up for a spirit but the lord has said that he said what i'm your provider he said isn't life better than the rainman he better than i'm able to take care of the birds and the fowls huh can i take care of you can i meet all your needs huh we're gonna run him out of here tonight saints huh so when you come through that door he said enter the gates with what thanksgiving is that right is that right because the lord why brother robin because they gotta understand see if you're coming in the devil want you to put pressure on the song leader is that right but hey brother abel it'll be different we claiming it tonight by faith brother and they come in here when you into that door we're going to have a what a positive thought on our mind is that right before you come in here you're into this gates with thanksgiving why this is the only place that you can get to what you come looking for every time you enter in the gates mental attitude he said now look if you worry look what the devil would do to you i won't read i got a few written down here he says it's sinful worrying is simple and produces fear it says it's a it could produce a mental and physical suicide see satan has an army and he has organized army that's why he said wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and wickedness in rulers in high places now that means that force is against our force but what he told us to do what put on the whole armor of god so that you maybe be able to withstand the wild of the devil in the end times saying hello mental attitude see that's why i don't know some of you were there at the old um um building we were there and the holy spirit was ministering us about that mind remember he said now while you're alive you can get away with it if they ask you something it's because intellectually you can tell a lie right and you still can get away with it he said but then after the brain dies is that right now after the brain dies he's dealing with what down that spirit your soul is that right have that area so if god just sense of god sent you ever to the hospital to pray for someone no matter what the condition is subconsciously if they can tell you they can still hear you what you want to do make sure that they have their salvation is that right don't give up on them is that right don't give up on anyone because that's what the gospel has been sent for with power and demonstration sometimes god has to put someone on their death bed down sometime he had to get him in accident son sometimes they have to get cut sometimes they have to lose a job sometimes they have to do some kind of trial and test has to come towards them to get them back is that right hallelujah they look at the prodigal son is that right we're going to look at some scriptures and we're going to look at the attitude remember his attitude his mental attitude he wanted to go out there humble robert he wanted to go out there give me my goods is that right let me have my goods his father didn't argue with him is that right hallelujah because his father knew that he had raised him up training him up in the way that he should go when he grow old he won't depart from it his dad didn't die back he didn't have a mental revelation i mean he had us down in the soul revelation is that right but what happened with the prodigal son is that right he came at the bible said he came into his what senses is that right i believe that theophany spoke to him and he came to his sensor who he really was and when he spoke to him he'd come back at home he never said he sinned against daddy he never said he sinned against mama he said i have sinned against god against heaven is that right mental attitude look what he says another thing the devil would do to you if you worry it says needless and waste time and effort see you're overthinking huh you're going to pull up a quote brother random talked about the nervousness in there he said now look he said look out look outs what uh uh um worrying does a robber of faith is a robber of peace and trust in never failing heavenly father it says it is a disgrace to god and should never be indulged in by christians one day we're gonna get into that city of refuge one day we're gonna see you it'll show you what you really got ah we're gonna see if you're really in christ those that are in christ jesus there's no condemnation that those that are in christ walking out after the flesh but in the spirit it says anxiety over what is nothing today unless tomorrow in view of faith that's what worrying does and i'm just touching some things it says it's a torment over something that will likely be a blessing if it comes ah worrying you're rushing you're trying to get something is god not necessarily god not saying no to you but what he may be saying not now not yet wait a minute he's telling you what first seek ye the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all other things will be what added unto you mental attitude hallelujah he said listen worrying look what else is worrying to do for you it's mentally cruel to self and others it's foolish for whatever is going to happen cannot be stopped by worrying ah but what can stop it if you believe in the promises of god if you believe in the word of god if you mark those uh promises in that bible when you're reading your bible is that right hallelujah we're getting somewhere just bear with me he said now look he he says don't worry should and should adversities uh adversities come and may still be victorious by trusting in god hallelujah y'all pray with me now i've got my timer on up here you got a lot but uh but i i i won't keep you i know it's the school night but we're going to let the lord have his way too i want to read something expectations 4-5-50 mental attitudes mental attitudes that you have remember this and never forget it this is our prophet now the right mental attitudes towards any promise of god will bring it to pass the right mental attitude towards any promise of god is that it doesn't it doesn't take gifts of healing healed to sick people it says any person in here has the right to meet satan anywhere anytime ah on in the ground see it's in you it's already in you exercise see you have to understand the ministry that's here god has brought here now let me pause a little bit he said now that this ministry here we we know when you read in the scriptures is that right when you see laying hands they're laying hands is on the jews we are the gentiles it was going to be a time that they talked about in the book of acts where the gentiles we will receive the word and receive what we need by receiving the word of god that's what we're moving into we're having supernatural acts here those supernatural acts you got young ministers pray for them around the young brothers pray for them god rising them up i'm just a spare tire around here i want to get back there and get some of that word that cinnamon i say hallelujah get in the amen corner god is doing something in here you gotta recognize what he's moving us into now now you have been moving to the adoption is that right what's there you'll be moving into the adoption you have the same right as your father has the prophecy now whatever the other part of the prophecy that came forth that the lord showed us that the prophet of god talked about the part of the prophecy that stuck with me was when he put the purple garments on the adopted child is that right hallelujah see if you don't want to take the other part of the prophecy you got to take all the prophecy then when you take all the prophecy now with you being adopted son and daughter of god it's a certain character comes with it it's a certain authority comes with it the devil know who you know that he can't touch you is that right look what he says i better get the going there i got a lot so i better keep going he said look when jesus christ was here on earth and in he dwelt at the fullness of the godhead bodily all the great powers of god was in his son christ jesus for the scripture tell us that god was in christ reconciling the world to himself all things was delivered unto him though he spoke nothing but what father the father told him he healed no one but what he saw being healed for he said verily i say the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees what the father is that right what he sees the father doing that was that was there now i tell you what let's turn to this scripture here john chapter 5. i know it won't be able to get to them all but if you're writing down you can write down john 5 9 um 19 deuteronomy 16 16. but right now we want to go to john the gospel with john chapter uh five let's look at verse one after this there was a feast of the jews and jesus went up to jerusalem now there is now there is that jerusalem by the sheep market a pool which is called in the hebrew tongue bethesda having the rough five porches now bethesda has been mercy is that right the house of mercy he says in this lay a great multitude and potent folks verse four it says for for an angel went down at the center season into the pool in a certain season into the pool and troubled the water whoso so ever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had he said and a certain man was there which he had an affirmative thirty and eight years when jesus saw him lie and the and when jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he said unto him will thou be made whole look at the important event look what he said the important man answered him sir i have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while i am coming another step down before me look at that mental attitude towards the lord when he came to him 38 years is that right some of you haven't even lived that long yet and you're coming in hallelujah the joy of the lord is my strength huh look what i said look at that attitude look at that attitude his trouble he said but while i am coming why i am coming another step down before me see i always thought he couldn't walk but you're going there brother brandon said he could walk that's what he said that's right brother steve he got in there because when you look at the scriptures he said every time i moved to get in somebody go in before me hallelujah he said now you get around and say now you look he said jesus said unto him rise up thy bed and walk and immediately the man was made whole and took up his his bed and walked and on the same day what was the sabbath he says and the jews therefore said unto him that was cured it is the sabbath day and it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed he answered them that who made me whole the same unto me take up thy bed and walk he said then as they him what man is that which said unto thee take up thy bed and walk and and he that was healed was not who was who it was for jesus had conveyed himself away in multitude being in that place he said afterward jesus fine of him in the temple and said unto him behold thou art made whole sin no more lest a worse thing come unto you now jesus came in not that only granted but now what was jesus displaying jesus was displaying the messiah ship to him is that right he started moving now to that messiah ship because the jews had healing is that right they knew about healing already the pool was already there so when they got there the the jews knowing the laws that who get this man right is that right who give him right to to do this on the sabbath day why who was it it was the lord of sabbath hallelujah noun is becoming in a revelation to god's children is that right it's coming to us now he said now look and expectations he said now he had passed by the pool of bethesda and there was great multitudes of lane hunt blind wither waiting for the movement of the water and when the waters be troubled then the first person stepped into the world by what by faith received healing is that right we're going to look at some things we're going to look at another one here mental attitude see some just was saying the mental attitude but the reason why i said mental attitude is also you're going to find out as we continue but it's based upon the condition the condition has to be right the condition has to be there it has to be according to the word of god is that right hallelujah he said i must i must have been john a young fella this one here you if you're writing down is one 1763 it says now a young fella who no thinking fast must have been best have been him that and just think of it and i want you to bear with me on this because this is the point that one of the points we want to really bring out to you the one that could can make the five biscuits uh five biscuits and two fish and feed five thousand the one that knows the secret of the heart he he's with us in the ship see he's with us he's here he can meet all of your needs everything that you need is no needing for you not to have the joy of the lord is that right it's what's beating you when you come through that door what's getting them brother able is that mental attitude that mental attitude is blocking you from your blessing that mental attitude right because he said lean not to thy own understanding trust in the lord in all thy ways he will lead he will guide he will direct your past uh you see go in matthew 6 25 see these are demon forces that are troubling people we wrestle not against flesh and blood these demon forces and they're coming to you and they're affecting your thought pattern is that right and the reason why is affecting your thought pattern because he said he that keep their mind on me i will grant you perfect peace is that right you got to keep your mind all the time on the word of god on what god is teaching us he's bringing us into what unto the sons and daughters is that right he cannot that's why the holy spirit is doing what he's doing he's telling you about your dress code he's telling you about the way that you you're supposed to be presenting yourself as a christian you are a peculiar people i'm a peculiar person we have a royal priesthood you have your royal blood you from from god you come from god you go back to god is that right hallelujah he says now look we're talking about here when he was in the ship but we're

right ain't that mufasa he was god is that right simmer was going to be jesus is that right the little baboon he was the one he was the prophet is that right the little bird he was the holy spirit is that right and the demons was what the demons was the hyenas always laughing there's something persecuting is that right huh i'm telling you you got to look through god eyes you got to keep it on his mind is that right god will show you those kind of things is that right now it's time for what did he tell him is that right when the baboon when the prophet came huh we need a prophet brother steve when the prophet came is that right what did he say [Applause] is that right it's the same way now is that right jesus is alive he's not dead he's alive he's living the world he told him jesus is alive is that right we got the testimonies to prove it jesus is alive [Applause] [Music] look what he says he says now he says the doctor he says i know he said let me come go what may doesn't make a bit of difference it's there i know it is you say bless the lord doctors say you're going to die with the cancer just say glory to god quick trip home see and that don't and then they don't mind talking to a group she was talking to a group of doctors he said i read your book of divine healing i said i guess you criticized it no sir he said i said thank you dr showing he said brother branham we have recorded that when we tell a person that's got a malignancy or something's going to kill him ulcers ready to bust or tuberculosis it depends on listen to this it depends on what attitude they take greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world [Music] he said if they get all tore up and said they died to see if you get tore up behind it if you believe where the doctor we had a sister then we have a sister honey that sister we went this is what about a month ago she said she went to the doctor there was he went there and the doctor robert said she had cancer and she said it was she said the doctor said it was on the screen she looked at the doctor and said something wrong with your screen ain't nothing inside of me huh that's an elective god they know where they stand hallelujah they criticize he says but he said on what attitude they take if they get all tore up said they'd die right away but said if they take the attitude well dying is just part of living it's all right when i die says you know it's almost retards the case that means it will stop it it'll push it back it'll hold that thing i'm telling you faith is that right faith in the promised word today we don't see the condition you've got the word the word that came to us god sent the prophet the seventh angel covenant prophet is that right the condition has to be also it's a what it's a covenant is that right let me keep going hallelujah he said now he he says you know it almost retarts that case now i just thought if that mental attitude taken like that what will it do when the holy ghost strikes that inner man when the world strikes down in there mixed with faith is that right what will happen huh thank you jesus he said now look he says what would it happen if it strikes the holy spirit strikes that inner man there it is i asked him he said certainly that's right if you can move into a spot move up to that one of the best surgeons and doctors that's in the southland he said mr branham it can be proved if a man will move up into that spot until even his own mind don't even know he's got it to think he's got it and don't even pay attention to it said it would do it's a it would do it see if he can believe that that's the truth all you gotta do is block it out once something come upon you if you got a problem with a migraine cast that thing down in the name of jesus christ if a cancer demon try to come at you cast it down in the name of jesus christ if you got an ulcer cast it down in the name of jesus christ if you fight the intellectual demon cast it down in the name of the lord jesus christ i have already take authority over the devil thing [Applause] mental attitude the mental attitude you take towards it you see will bring now the mind won't do it but

knowing that your situation will be taken care of huh that's your mental attitude don't bring satan in there with you don't let satan ride in your brain uh he's trespassing he has no right in your

on what the lord had promised us is that right some of you you keep your mind on god you have your schooling and you're there there's nothing wrong with education the prophet of god preached the

take a quote from brother brahman bring it bring it to me now i'll tell you i wish i would have started serving the lord sooner myself it's a beautiful thing that's why that's why you got around there

i'm warning you warning before judgment brother greg warning me for drugs i'ma look at you just like this if you bring unbelief i do not like unbelief around me it's no good see there's only two seeds down in there it's either faith or are he the doubt and god is feeding us off the revealed word right now is that right god is bringing us hidden manner right now is that right god is moving us into something your children the things that you got that you're getting now that god is opening up god knows i wish i would have had it to tell my children i wish i had to teach my children and if you ever god extended his hand of grace and mercy to you because the ignorance is just a lack of knowledge it was not made known to us now huh hallelujah look what he said help me lord he said now and now

for you to ask he said ask abundantly that your joys might be full he said cry until his word is vindicated now friend let's watch just a minute cry until the word is what it's vindicated is that right now let's just turn the turn to luke 18 hallelujah [Music] you're standing god god is bringing us into and teaching us by the grace of god and showing us what's inside of us but we also have to understand satan's tactics you see that thought pattern you got to control that thought pattern that thought pattern it at least it directs your path you go in a negative or you're moving into a positive is that right he says now look luke 18. he says there is that there was in the city i mean verse one and he spayed a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to what and not what was you worrying about he said saying there was in a city a judge which feared not god neither near regarding man see and there was a widow in the city and she came unto him saying avenge me of my

out that's god provided away for his people hallelujah he said always is to take his word and hold on to it until it's vindicated now see follow to hold on to the promise until it's made manifest to you he says hallelujah see god has got to be a condition let me find that god help me hallelujah i know time is getting close but i wanted to bring this to you by the grace of god thank you jesus hallelujah let me look at this one see help me lord he says just because you believe you said he said just because you believe it's there that don't make it so thank you jesus it's so until what happened be prayer for whitman we got a few more minutes he says them pharisees and sadducees was just as religious with those sacraments as they could be but god said that's a stink in my nose there was no sincerity there was nothing to it that should be you've got to come upon basical promise and upon your mental attitude towards it he says now at those those 400 prophets remember when he went down and let me drop down he says but remember that belongs to us so he made him he's talking about he's talking about with micah and he talked about jehoshaphat and we talked about with ahab i tell you when he got there right we know that on that conditions i'll tell you what i got to read this turn the first um uh what was that king's first kings i think it's 22 is it somebody help me is the first kings 22 let's see yeah first kings 22 help me lord now look at the condition hallelujah look at the condition here first kings 22. once these once you have it say amen we'll just look at the first five verses he said now look and say they continue three years without war between syria and israel and it came to pass in the third year that jehoshaphat the king of judah came down to the king of of israel she sees jehoshaphat was a righteous man he said then the king of israel said unto his servants know ye that raymond gilead is ours and we be still and take it not out of the hand of the king of syria and he said unto jehoshaphat will thou go with me to the battle to raymond gilead see how the holy ghost told us that suddenly see he learned his lesson on that third time is that right but you can't go out there and socialize with somebody two can walk together right like they can't walk together unevenly yoke is that right you can walk together unless you agree he says and he said unto jehoshaphat without but with me to the battle to raymond gilead and jehoshaphat said to the king of israel i am as thou art what my people as thy people my horses that died the horses but now here's what we're talking about the condition see people is taking this word they're taking this bible and they're taking this bible and for the season it gotta be in season is that right you can't grow a watermelon in the wintertime is that right so you got to understand god now we're in what we're on the backside of the bible is that right we got to understand what god is bringing us into right now is that right the conditions had to be right is that right so you could not move into it without the word of who the prophet is that right look at what he say here look that's why i say the condition it got to be under condition it's got to be based upon the word of the prophet because god cannot curse what the prophets say and and the prophet can't curse what god says is that right no way god can curse because the words of the prophet comes from god is that right huh oh man i tell you i tell you i can preach all night the atmosphere in here let me keep going help me lord he says now verse five here's the condition verse 5 he says and jehoshaphat says unto the king of israel inquire i pray thee at the word of the lord today see is that right now you've got to inquire from the prophet then the king of israel gathered the prophets together about 400 men and said unto them shall i go against raymond gilead or shall i bear and they said go up up the law go for the lord shall deliver it unto thy hand now for the sake of time we know that them what lion prophets is that right a spirit came on them but the real problem was micah is that right they didn't want to hear what micah had to say is that right they want to hear what william mary and branham got to say is that right that's only come to the elected seat is that right that's why i tell them he's a vindicated prophet is that right he's vindicated by the word of god uh like he told him in his hour here now see you got to listen to god is that right i'm telling you it was so many that walked with him and it hurt him is that right after the african trip when he was there on that african trip come on up musicians he was there on an african trip and when he was there on that african trip he got there and god told him not to go is that right same spirit when god told him not to go he was there but he told them brothers god told him not to go you got to realize things if god give you a word i don't care if the prophet i don't care if his father mother preacher deacon anybody when god give you a word you stick with the word of god even when he got around there he told the brother they were laying up in there and he told the brother i think the brother that was walking with him we've been on the stage with him many times on the platform with him many times and seen god do mighty works and he looked at rather random and he told him he said you know what he said brother adam you're wrong he told you he was wrong and he looked at it the thing was odds were his brother i think it was brother bob's worth i think it was and he turned around and he looked at him he looked turned around and he said but brother bosworth god told me when god tell you something when he tell you something then it's going to happen but it's going to happen in his time under his conditions when he see fit for it to happen but the condition here god said when jesus came jesus came because he had to fulfill the word of the prophet the word that come from moses he had to fulfill the office of the messiah and then in his hour here now somebody had to fulfill malachi 4 luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 it had to be fulfilled and the vindication shines is there is that right he says scriptural sign the same sign that was that was not given to the gentiles but it had to be given to the gentiles when it was melchizedek when he came into the tent of abraham is that right once he came into the tent of abraham so many talks about the signs that went down to sodom and gomorrh the two angels went down to sodom and gabor billy graham and oral roberts the two that went down there but the sign that we was looking at was discerning the thoughts and the intents of the hearts that was our sign now that we were looking for he'd come to turn the heart of the children to the father in the hearts of the father to the children unless you do read your bible pray and study the message mental attitudes will be directed hallelujah letters bow hallelujah i tell you saints we didn't even touch it we didn't even touch it but god knew god knew all hearts and mind are clear heads bowed someone need prayer or

paragraph 18. brother branham saying now paul speaking here of the valley or the shadow rather the law being the shadow of a good things to come could never make the worshiper perfect then he goes on to show what the perfection is now it's a strange thing that this is so much thought of people they say well i am weak my faith is not very much i am not a very good christian this is what people say brother branham say that is just what the devil wants you to say [Music] amen you are just talking his language right then so when you say you are weak you are talking the devil's language because let the weak say they are water amen blessed be the name of the lord he said that is just what the devil wants you to say you are just talking his language right then see you must never say that don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time i am saved i have god in my heart i believe him with all my heart do you believe in divine healing with all my heart let your testimony always and your thoughts everything never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it when he start that don't entertain it amen keep your thought always positive amen every mental right mental attitude toward every divine promise because the word of god is a seed and in the world there is life if you need something just relax pick up a promise keep it in your heart and begin to confess it not for one day not for today you hold on to that promise you confess it until it is vindicated to you in other words it's made real to you amen if your car is broken down and you suffer with a car go ahead claim a promise and wake up in the morning you say lord thank you for this beautiful car where is the car that's not my problem the problem is we think too much with our mind instead of looking at the word of god with god all things are possible amen my car is broken down you're a priest you're walking on feet while slave that's what solomon say are walking riding on chariot amen just claim the promise and put it there you wake up in the morning you say lord thank you jesus for giving me this car and to be more specific tell him the car that you want amen brother branham said there is a faith for buick you need a coach you see me brother branham said there is a faith for buick there is a faith for ford there is a fair for cadillac amen depending on your faith let it be done according to your faith don't go to heaven and regret and look back and say i wish i was exercising this world when i was in the world amen while there is a need there is a promise for the need if they need prop up there was already a promise being given to take care of the need found a promise hold on to the promise and begin to confess in the morning you say praise the lord for

redemption you're not going to be there worrying again because somebody took the burden over it is not your burden anymore but by him bringing you peace it is just telling you i just pick it up and i'm taken care of amen now it's up to you to make preparation for that promise to receive it not to wait until it happened you start making preparation again just like esther she made the banquet

course of surgery and our instructor pulled up a slide and put somebody who was wounded in the brain with blood all over and he said what do you think and everybody was like whoa then they took that same person and they wipe everything and it was just a little tiny tiny wonder right there just to hit an artery and the teachers say when they bring a case to you don't panic amen no matter how big you look it might be just a little bit of something like this but the devil can blow it blow it blow it blow it blow it and when you sit down it was nothing but a lot of lord a lot of time thing you can cast a hundred thousand demons while there is nothing there amen no matter what happened do not panic because the attitude you take eeg there it's gonna or speed it up if just a mental attitude can your sickness do you know why because when you get when you look brother branham say if you look and you say well this is life everybody dies brother branham said he the diseases do you know why because that attitude send some vibration to your cells and the cells get strength again and they're trying to hold on amen fighting now when you put that and you couple that with divine healing with
