Leo amen okay so we bring brother Leon in prayer amen so invites his daddy to give us a testimony then by the Charles Hamilton amen so I just wanted to give this testimony for the glory of God um I'm going to be brief I just wanted to read the scripture Revelations 12 11 it came to me just a moment ago and it says and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the words of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death I just want to give glory to God because um on Friday um on Wednesday when we were leaving out um we got to Florida and um we got some food I believe we took some got some shrimp from a Jamaican place and I believe the shrimp wasn't well I didn't notice at the time and by the time I woke up the next morning to get on the flight to go to Jamaica I had a rash in my back I thought it was um maybe like fake jewelry poisoning or something like that so I took my jewelry off by the time I got to Jamaica the rash had gone all over my back and the next morning by the time I was there for a day my skin started to get irritated and then my rash came all the way up to my face um and it swole up and I wasn't sure what happened being in the third world country a lot of times you don't really want to go to a hospital in those places because they don't have the best care and I remembered the reason my main reason for giving this testimony is because I thought lightly of prayer at that moment I wasn't looking to the Lord for help I was looking just for help and my mom simply just put her hands on me and spoke the word and within two days and I would say through the things of that God through God's creation he allowed natural healing to come to my body I went to the Mineral Springs in Jamaica and it's a place where the water is infused with all these minerals and within 30 minutes after leaving the bath my my swelling went down and my skin started to heal and I went back the next morning and it was completely gone so I just wanted to thank the Lord for that natural way and prayer for being combined to heal my body to come back with nothing to deal with and now I have nothing so I'm so grateful [Applause] and it's super charge after um the testimony if he can bring our prayer requests to the Lord amen amen I just want to give the testimony for the glory of God as well and I am on Tuesday Tuesday I believe it was I was on the job site and um the pump is really I operate a concrete pump and um I lost the remote I lost the remote because my Outriggers were falling in the ground and I almost I kind of panicked because I had to swing the boom around which is very heavy it would turn over hurt somebody probably kill somebody so I had to hurry up and get back around to get everything situated and I left the remote on a mixer truck and the mixer truck took off he gave me the grout and he took off and I said I I didn't know where it was at I'm looking around for it I'm like oh my God I was on the mixer truck so I'm in panic mode I'm calling I'm calling everybody say can somebody call them on the phone or something like that and I remember normally brother John is at work at that time on dispatch so I ran and got my phone I said brother John let it know I was waking him up I said brother John that that driver that was here can you call him to make sure he give me the uh the remote back so don't break or something and brother John said but I'm not at work I said Lord have mercy I said okay he said well brother what's wrong and I told him what was wrong he said okay brother he said I'll check I'm not in for another hour he said I'll come I'll call back and check on you so by that time I'm walking to the end of the road and I'm looking for it and I'm praying the other um gentlemen are looking for it as well and I'm like Lord Lord I don't know what to do I don't know what to do Lord I don't understand why this is happening now I said Lord I need your help I said I need your help Lord I don't know where this remote is at the remote is about fifteen thousand dollars just for the remote I said Lord I need this remote so I'm getting frustrated I'm getting upset I'm like I don't understand this now this is the second time that happened so I'm like Lord what is going on you're trying to tell me something here because I remember the Lord had brother Stephen say when the situation happened stop or you'll miss God I stopped and I said Lord you've been preaching to speak the word I said Lord I don't know what to say I said Lord but I need that remote back and by the time I lift my head up the driver was coming over saying hey he found it on the road and he came back but the driver came back with it it was Jimmy and he came back with it and he said well you just owed me breakfast but I but I thank the Lord for it because I was in panic mode but at that time brother John told me he said him and him and uh his wife was praying for me so it was it was a unified thing and I thank the Lord Heavenly Father we thank you Lord Jesus Christ for all your grace Lord and your love and your favor towards us Lord God father so many times Lord God things can go the other way heavenly father but go through your teaching Heavenly Father you bring us into subjection to your word Heavenly Father well at times I'm learning about all we have to do Lord God is just take our time and trust in you Lord God we don't have to be super spiritual Lord God we just have to be humble Lord God we just have to take our place underneath the word Lord father help us Lord God to continue to walk on the things that

you and we sure love the Lord for his mercy and Grace and we just go run into the word amen excited happy oh my amen amen amen turn members to the Book of Genesis chapter 2. I want to read verse 16 and 17 and um pray unless you be seated I want to take a little Atomic tonight by God's grace on appetite change appetite change amen he said in verse 16 and Genesis 2 it says in the Lord God commanded the man now notice that he's commanding him he's given him a commission here he's giving him one of his Commandments he commanded him saying of every tree of the garden thou must eat freely but of the tree knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day you eat that in the in the day that thou eatst thereof Thou shalt surely die amen let us pray father God oh Jesus father we are humbled by your presence Lord father we realize Lord as your Apostle told us he said I ain't seating me quake in your presence father Lord is the reverence we have for you father it's the honor we have for you Lord is the the love we have for you Lord knowing that father without you we can do nothing Lord Father Here I am once again Lord and a place Lord no man can do any more Lord but oh God fathers you sent your disciples one day said go loose the coat tonight Lord God that you might be the rider of god father you said the master have need of him go loose him oh God I pray you'd lose your power here tonight God I pray you lose your mercy Lord loose your grace Lord father I pray you'd lose this father God that we might receive your ungrafted word Lord hear this this evening God and Lord that we may leave with this in our heart Lord did not our hearts burn within us as you spoke to us along the way oh God grant it to us Lord and we'll be so quick to give you all the praise honor and Glory before we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ the righteous one our savior amen and amen you may be seated amen I love this as we look at this we look at God and he's here he is he's telling them to go ahead and eat whatever you hungry you know whatever you desire here whatever you because see that there hadn't been no sin there'd been no no attachment to nothing but him and and we see that Satan and when he come he had to change he couldn't he couldn't take away the hunger they had because he can't take away your hunger but he can pervert your appetite amen and we see here that he told him he said you can eat anything you want here but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatst therein Thou shalt surely die let's go to chapter three and start right here look Satan had to get into so he had to have an agent to work with Satan knew he could not work with Adam or Eve unless he had an agent to get into the to this to this way to in order to change man's desire to change man's appetite to change the way he looked at God to the way he approached God the way he he worshiped God and we see Satan's still using the same tactic says now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God hath made and he said unto the woman yea God hath God said You shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it least you die so he wanted her to see what her response was there's no telling how long he he worked on her no longer no telling how long he approached her either that's the way he is with me and you his first approach is not he's not his he's not he knows he's not going to weaken you with you with his first approach all he's wanting you to do is is to catch your attention just for a little bit and and get and cause you to stop your time and and to come in reason with him and and try to figure out what God wants to wants you to do and he see here he begins to preach to the woman he begins to tell her and then she then she gets anointed and she begins to preach back to him huh I see both of them was out of their position and both of them began to speak and but an amazing thing about it is that that when this was happening that the first thing you'll see that the appetite was beginning to change the way she looked at the word of God was no longer the same the way she looked at it first because all through the scriptures as we go through the first two chapters of Genesis it says the Lord God hath said the Lord God has said the Lord God but right here they started calling God and anything can be God see Satan knew that Satan knew that he knew I have to has to be very crafty I have to be very wise with her she's she's a creative being God has created her she's she's come right out of Adam so she's not going to be easy to deceive but seeing that she's the weaker vessel I'll have to work on her I'll have to work on her for a while and he began to tell it to him Sheen again instead of saying the Lord God she began saying God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it at least you die and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die for God does know in the day that you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as Gods knowing Good and Evil they had never had the appetite to want to understand between Good and Evil until the serpent had to inject this the prophet said it wasn't the act that was the thing it was what happened at first he he had to bring the ACT to the mind already took place in her mind in order for the action to come That's what Satan knows about you for it to happen Brother Sam it has to start here first Satan said I've got to sow here first I've got to change the appetite of her thinking I have to change the way she thinks I got to change the way she looks at God I got to change the way she speaks to God and she began to talk differently she began to act different and he was offering her something she already was because of Satan because the serpent had no power had no power he had no Authority but he was wanting her to trade hit their Authority for his knowledge hmm he wanted he wanted them to step down into a lower position because when you're in this in that position Satan is powerless so Satan wants us to step back and get out of our position that's why the prophet of God come to tell us when you get in your position and recognize Who You Are oh glory be to God then Satan becomes powerless [Applause] [Music] but as long as he changed the appetite when he changed their approach brothers and sisters see how crafty Satan is see how dangerous it is with the ministry brother John a man that's all he has to do is just change one word then if you listen and you react and you eat then you respond then you become another being [Music] you're taking lower position because you've took the oh my goodness you've took it the appetite of another oh glory be to God glory be to God said you'll be gods now already was God's they didn't need to be opened they was already opened they were spotless they was blameless they were sinless whatever possessed where we're at right now through the blood of Jesus Christ glory be to God well I love the prophet of God said the number six is the number of man it just didn't happen in verse 6 for a reason it showed that they had lost their position they had lost their position they started catering to the flesh then no longer responding to the spirit of God the the hunger in their heart had changed oh glory be to God listen what he says what she says here and when the woman saw when she saw that the tree was good for food and was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he didn't eat and the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons see what happened they didn't need a covering then because they was under that Holy Veil not on her lust Veil as long as they was on that Holy vehicle they didn't look at each other like that but when this happened they began to look at one another like that they begin to oh that's what happens we can tell what you're eating because the way you look at one another oh glory be to God oh my see that's why you could say that he says you're say you're rich and increased and goods and have needed nothing but I say to you you're miserable blind and naked and north at night right back to the same position in the wrong position oh glory be to God Hallelujah Oh What a Mighty God the first thing man does when he sins he has to cover up he has to cover up he looks for a covering he didn't need a covering until he sinned he didn't need the blood until he sinned he didn't need Mercy till he sinned he didn't need healing until he sinned when he changed her appetite she probably said her desire and change their desires to speed on this oh glory be to God look at us look over here first John chapter 2 verse 16. let's look at this he said for all that is in this world the lust of the eyes I mean the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father so what she took was not of the father [Music] so her appetite had changed from feeding on the word of God to satisfying the desires of the flesh oh glory be to God I'm glad the prophet told us taught us this he said he said you want to know where a man stands he said you'll give him the word test [Applause] you tell me you believe this message and you reject it you say you believe the word of God and you reject it you say what the Bible says to him and you tell them and they reject it and you tell me you're a son and daughter of God no your appetite's wrong we cannot just take one quote from here one scripture from there and make it satisfy that's what it is they want satisfaction we need Redemption we need the blood of Jesus Christ we need Deliverance he said it's not of the world but look at this or what she how she does it look I'm it's wonderful how the scriptures are so beautiful how they tie together and he here it goes we know Genesis is the sea chapter where everything was planted and John's here's telling him it's coming up let's come up now and I'm telling you these things are not of God I'm telling you that that the lust of the flesh is not of God what does desire desire to be popular desire to be recognized desires to have a position That's what Satan wanted and only the way he could take his position because he'd already been cast down was they had to step back they had to step back in order for him to get try to get in their position the only way Satan can get in your position is you have to step back and let him step down that's what he wants he wants you to take a side road he don't want you to stay in the highway he don't want you to stay in the middle of the road that's why we got so many people going off on this side and we've got so many going off on that side because they're failing to hear they hear the word of God Hallelujah she said the first thing she said that the tree was good for food the less of the flesh unless they're the fish he created a different hunger he knew he could not abolish that hunger for The Fellowship Of God so he had to change Oh my he had that Oh my he had to give her an appetite suppressant Satan is a very shrewd man but he has to give you a suppressant you know what a suppressant is is something that satisfies you that ain't real that's why we see the natural world is always after diets things and they won't suppressants what the suppressant is you must just suppress the desire to want to feed the flesh same way in the natural as it is in the spiritual you have to you have to control the desire of it you don't need to suppress it you need an impression of the Holy Ghost [Applause] glory be to God he said listen this then here comes the Lusty eyes it says and that it was pleasant to the eyes Satan said I got her looking I got her feeding I got her wanting something else besides the voice of God oh Hallelujah he said I'm gonna I'm gonna suppress that's why you come to a lot in a lot of churches and the people are so damn priced and cold and formal because they're not doing what the word of God's saying he said take the book John and eat eat the book John it's the book John says well I give them a little religion make them feel good we're not here to feel good we're here to we're here that God might change us to good Governor said every time we come to church we have two choices we leave better or we leave worse it's according to what your appetite is when you come in if you're looking at your watch saying well you know the time is running out I'm hungry you're feeding the flesh come on now he said Revelation ought to be more to you than meat and bread on your table [Music] I feel like shouting glory be the god the supernatural power of God to transform glory be to God she said it's the luster yeah oh it looked look what she said that it was pleasant to the eyes and look at this the lust oh my the pride of life she said to make one I don't want your wives he wants you humble hey he said he hid it from the wise and the prudent and revealed it to beige such it would eat oh glory be to God the first thing they did was they said we're still Christians but we need a religion we need to approach we need to cover up no they needed the cleaning up they need a cleaning up I see that so much they say well I'll just sweep it on the rug but the rug still got dirt it's just dirt under the rug but that's worth it that's where the inspection comes that's why the Holy Ghost come he said he was a discerner of the thoughts in the intend the heart he dug down under the rug he said you look nice on the outside but on the inside he said you speak well of me with your mouth but your heart far from me I've seen many speak well of this message but their heart was far from it [Applause] it's the desire you're just a hunger it's the appetite he said blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness they shall be filled foreign you got to come back to that forget about your Earthly needs that's why the scripture said I pray that you prosper and be in good health as your soul prospers for the Bible said the soul that sinneth shall surely die glory be to God to make one wise wow that's what's setting you that's what he used on her she wanted to be like the serpent more septum take my position he said then I'll take yours oh see when you take your position against the word then you take Satan's position and then you become a powerless dead Church and look when their eyes opened it didn't bring them to repentance because they'd done took a lust of hell right they said when their eyes open they sew together thickly I like what people say oh they ate an apple then why didn't they put leaves over their mouths why didn't he ain't your glad God sent us a prophet I like what Birdman says he said if it was Apples let's pass out the apples it's the Holy Ghost that opens the eyes to the unbeliever it's the holy ghost that brings all things to us he said behold I'll sin unto you a god what did we receive in this earth a god sent us a son of man to reveal these son of man to restore us back to the appetite of the fathers not the appetite of a denomination but the appetite for God down see when David said my soul thirsteth after thee Oh Lord for a living God see Satan wants to worship a dead God look what happened in Rome's Romans 1 . that's what happened their appetite was changed he said they worshiped the creation more than the Creator that's what Adam and Eve did they worshiped The Serpent and didn't even know it why because they took his word over God's word shows you where you're at right oh I like the old saying you are what you eat I can tell if you eat your word because you received the word and that is a paradox in this age when the Bible tells me and you there'd be a hunger for the hearing not that it wouldn't be preached but when they reject it their ear is bored and they can no longer hear so they no longer hunger they're hungering for something but it's not God because when the word of God comes it sets you free he says you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free and he said who the son is set free is friend dead but Satan wants to suppress that do you know within yourself there's three kind of believers no you know the prophet preached in an audience but right here body Spirit soul that's why you got to have the born-again experience because these two other Albert courts are ruling if there's not a king on the inside there's a devil on the outside come on now [Music] we're not here to have a form of godliness That's what Satan wants you to have he said they had a form of godliness but denied the power thereof to be changed he said don't be conformed to this world but be he transformed by the renewing of your man [Music] for as a man thinketh in his heart so easy [Music] [Applause] glory be to God this man is the you've heard nobody says you cannot convert him until immortality takes over because of the Fall the old glory be to go because of the Fall they bypassed immortality to take on mortality they bypass Incorruptible to take on corruptable that's why God said I got one on you Satan I got one on you I Gotta See I have a c and that seed will hunger for my word [Music] glory be to God we see that we see the scriptures being fulfilled right here in verse eight after their eyes were open they still heard the same voice huh he says and they heard the voice of the Lord God the Lord God not God the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and Eve hid themselves from the presence of The Voice oh glory be to God the Bible says the spirit and the bride said come the same voice walking in the garden is in the bride now that's what the Prophet come to do is say tell us that the voice is not only in me it's in you that's why Paul said get your eyes off Paul it's Christ in you the hope of glory [Applause] glory be to God hid themselves from the presence hmm that's why people don't want to see the spirit of God moving this church because they got sin hides the preacher's preaching let me let me put my head down let me let me look like I'm reading see he's got your eyes focused on something besides what God is saying it's not the man I'm just a donkey it's the rider on the donkey that's speaking through the Donkey it wasn't the power of the donkey that rebuked Balaam it was the power of God that spoke to the donkey to forbid the madness it's amazing how man was called for 120 years and it still wouldn't come and the Animals was called one time and they started lining up caused their aperture their appetite never changed for the voice of God thank you that's why brother Bram said a man without the holy spirit is nothing more than a brute Beast what was what was the serpent he was a brute Beast he was knowledgeable but he was a brute Beast and he wanted them to want got them to where they wanted to eat like he eat he eat from his own desires not from the word of God that's where it shows where we're at what you're eating home brother now say do you want you want me to know where I'll know where a man is living bring me to his house brother John let me sit down in this table let me look at the books about his reading why can't we say this look at the thong let's go back and scan the phones he's pulling over on you again huh he's pulling one over on you again he said I'll give him a cell phone I'll give them contact to the Book of Knowledge and they'll eat that more than they'll eat with me he said I'll still have fooled them I have changed their appetite I have given them ever learning and never coming to the knowledge of the truth but brother Stephen I know everything now I know what how it is to that a tadpole has formed into a frog you know more about the life of a frog than you do about the life of God huh what do we want to know about what did the prophet said he said you want to get closer to God he said read your Bible and pray read your Bible and pray read your Bible and pray [Applause] oh but that's too simple too simple huh what do you want you want you want to show your intelligence there it is oh you want to show how magnificent you can speak before Paul shut that down if anybody could have come with words of wisdom and all those things because he was eaten off the tree of knowledge and thought he was eating off the tree of God because he was listening to the wrong voices It produced the wrong nature it made him want to persecute the church to death glory be to go I would love that brother elect does never persecute if you run your brother down if you belittle your sister if you talk about him you're not eating off the tree of life [Applause] that shows me you have no prayer life because the prophet told us brother that when you get in that presence you can't talk about anybody all you can do is say how dirty I am God help me in my condition and help my brother help my sister [Applause] [Music] notice they hid themselves do you know that's when man first started lying that's when life of knowledge of Good and Evil drunk lies and the Bible said a liar will have his part in the Lake of Fire he said Satan was alive from the beginning and the truth's not in him why oh my why did they hide and then tell a lie why the head and the Lord called unto Adam and he said unto him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden he never hid before they never hit before a change of appetite now they they used to walk with him hand in hand let's go let's go father let's walk hold your little children's hand you know why how I can tell when a man's walking a gun he's holding on to God's hand you know why you see so many people falling because they've let go of God's unchanging hand [Music] oh glory be to God hallelujah the appetite changed what did he they begin to make excuses and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid first time man ever had fear on him Brother John this was not a reverence fear anymore this was a fear because they was wrong remember when the one man said in Martin's day in the prophet told us about I said I've got it I've got it I've got it he said there's a white robe that comes on me I'm the one that speaks the word of God he said then talk to Martin oh no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no why because Martin was the urethaneman to them guess what they made him go before him and the road vanished if it would have been of God it would have still been there see he was robed in his own righteousness and he was not robed into righteousness of God amen your own righteousness will not stand before God he will make you naked once again oh Hallelujah so I hit myself and he said who told thee thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree where have I commanded thee that thou shouldest not heat he already knew what that was going to do when they ate it that's why he put out a word don't eat that one I'll give you everything right to eat them right this one here is probably the prettiest tree in the garden the tree of knowledge of good name it's just beautiful because he said it was one it was one to make one why it was one to make one desire it was one to make them hunger by the sand it was one that changed their appetite then their their attitude oh glory be to God their attitude when your appetite changes your attitude changes because your attitude determines your altitude we say we're up here we say we're up here but we're still on the runway we've got the vehicle but we can't crank it glory be to God he said and the man said the woman whom thou gavest me to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did we do the same thing we get caught when these little Johnny did it Fred made me do it Susie was doing that and I just followed her but I love the way James caught that he said you did that because of the lust of your flesh you can't say the devil made you do it it's because you yielded your flesh to his desire you fed your flesh that's why you got in trouble oh Hallelujah glory be to God listen to this and God and the Lord God he's trying to show him look this is where I want you to keep me I'm going to I want you to be but I said everybody wants you to be the healer the savior but very few wants him to be Lord you know what that means he's in control that's why so many people are out of control because they've not yielded to him to be controlled by oh my goodness what we needed to do is we needed to have our GPS reprogrammed Satan put our destination hail and Jesus said wait a minute all I'm going to ask him to do is push the button I agree see you never agreed to go where you was going you was tricked to go where you was going but God said if you agree what do you say he said total obedience to every word of God entitles you to the Holy Ghost please what's that degree means means ah he's trying to get him back to agree with him and then oh they could do this instead of agree and said Lord we made a major mistake a real Christian when he messes up he repents he don't hide it under a bushel he don't sweep it under a road he said let's clean it off let's get it all out let's be pure and holy before God you know why people don't see God anymore because he said blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God you know why people didn't see God working through brother now because their heart was not pure glory be to God called then she said the serpent he gave up she didn't did he did he hold a gun on her you do this Eve I'm going to cut you I'm going to take this rope and I'm gonna choke you to death if you don't do this he had to change her appetite she desires it it's one to make one wise she wanted to have the ability that the serpent did subtle knowing all things but yet not knowing god glory be to God that's my brother I preached that message why we're so tossed about because this but it's unbeliever you'll never convert him he said he'll be a cuckoo bird Paul said he's a thorn in my flesh Paul said when I go to do good Evil's always present he was not talking about Silas he was talking about him this the flesh and see the spirit of man it works under conditions it's stormy today I don't know if I'm going to make it I don't know if I'm a Christian I don't know when the sun shines oh I got it I got it and the storm comes in the wind I don't know if I'm going to make it um but when you get it on the inside he says cast down all those senses cast down every imagination and bring every thought under the openness of Jesus Christ and let this mind that was in Christ be also in you I'm going to change your thinking so your attitude your appetite will change and with the attitude change your attitude changes he don't hate your brother no more hmm well the prophet said this is the way I love what brother Peter Paul said he said I couldn't tell my dad's enemies because he treated them the same as he did his friends help us help us Lord we need help we need help Jesus did that what did he tell Judas he said friend go do what you got to do he didn't say that yes there's that lie that's the one that's the devil he said go do what you got to do and do it quickly he said Judas thou betray us the son of man with a kiss be careful who you let kiss you glory be to God many have come up to the messaging but yet did betrayed the very life of the message saying yes I believe this message but I live so Unholy having a form of godliness and denying the power their appetite changed let's look over in in Matthew chapter six just for a minute amen I'm trying to go I'm trying I'm trying just be patient with Jesus Matthew 6. let's start at verse 26. and look at G trying to get across to them what is the main thing the main source he told him he said don't rejoice because the Devils is subject to you don't Rejoice because you've cast out devils don't Rejoice because you prayed for people and they've been healed he said but Rejoice because your name is in the books that means you're my seed see Jesus was talking and people was not listening because they didn't have the appetite for the voice of God they seen him as an illegitimate child a heretic a a vampire an illegitimate child but the seed seen him as God he tells them look Jesus said and answered him and said verily I say unto you you seek me not because you saw the Miracles but because you did eat of the Loaves and were filmed my goodness you know what brother Stephen A lot of people come to church and they just want their flesh son amen that shows what is the greatest appetite in your life preach me happy preacher Don't Preach on my life preacher don't walk in that room don't open the door of Pride preacher Holy Ghost don't go there make my flesh happy make me happy you know what makes me happy when God gets down in there and he sees the dirt in the corners and he begins to sweep it out [Applause] that's what's wrong we need a house cleaning and a soul feeling and a god revealing word but we're so full of Facebook and and and so full of our phones and we're looking at this and we're looking at that and then we wonder why we come to church and say oh brother Stephen preach me happy make me happy I say oh God lord if I'm not happy because of your word then God take me to the altar that I might be happy at your voice again he said labor not for the meat which perisheth but for the meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath God the Father sin he's saying you need a ceiling you need a ceiling that's why you'll be able to understand the revealing that's why I told him he said he said Peter James somehow no more you need a Feeling you need an appetite desire they were saying oh lord lord who's going to be the greatest when you go will it be me John will it be James just not for me to give well we see that around the message everywhere who's the greatest preacher it's easy it's the Holy Ghost [Applause] Satan has deceived many by personalities they're looking at the personality of a man and failing to see the personality of the Holy Ghost he said if you don't believe me but believe the works I do but they are they that testify me search the scriptures for in the end you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify me appetite what you've been feeding on huh oh glory be to God he said heed it hungress and thirsteth for righteousness shall be filled they thought because look Jesus warned him he said don't be like this and then he explained it to him with great wisdom and if they wasn't able they wouldn't be able to catch it he said many will come to me in that day and cry Lord Lord did not we cast out devils in your name did not we heal the sick in thy name he said depart from me I never knew you you never received my word you never was born in my spirit you didn't have Oh Glory people get people get offended we've got so many doctrines around the message so many attitudes around the message one man says you don't you don't receive the seed till you go to the altar when the Bible said the seed he cannot sin for his seed remaineth in him the seed is what had to be quickened brother Bram told us non-seed cannot be quickened that's why when they go to the altar they get nothing they get her appeasement of their flesh they wake up and they get up and they have their own little rights look at me robed in embarrassment but not robed in humility instead of coming to him and said Lord we could have done nothing right except you would have done it to us father we are no more than the burning bush when your presence left the Bush was still a bush but when he was there it was Holy Ground Hallelujah glory be to God you love the Lord you love his word Pete John I mean Paul warns us in second Corinthians 11 3. he said but I fear right leashed by any means as the serpent he's taking it back to Genesis as the serpent the same serpent was there with Paul when he was there he was battling the church then he said that Antichrist spirit will come and already is working he'll be in full fruition right right he'll be in full maturity at one time that's why people can't hide stuff no more you know why because it's Harvest Time what did the son of man come to do to reveal thoughts and the intents of the home oh God he said at least by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtility your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity come on and I thought it was supposed to be wise I thought we're supposed to say things and people just like that's just too that's too simple brother Steve when you you bring it out so that's too simple you got to make it big or we can never get it it's like the horse chasing the carrot you never can't get it what we got to do is give the horse the carrot thank you that's what God does when you receive the Holy Ghost he rewards you to eat luring them away with deception that's Satan's greatest weapon is deception Paul said I don't come to you with enticing words of men and wisdom but I come to you in the power and the demonstration of the Holy Ghost I come to you to see to let you see a real living God that's why he said you'll be written Epistles red of all me you know why they they can say oh they want to about us but you know what they read Jesus when they really look Hallelujah that's just thankful for the grace of God oh my turn went to St John 6. just for a minute verse 35 your attitude your appetite toward the word shows you know what we didn't come here for the for the song leader to work us up we didn't come here for the preacher to work us up we got to be like David he said I was glad when they said David said I was I'm already prepared for the house of God I've already been eating I've already been drinking maybe Jesus is going to come by my way and he's going to be thirsty and I'll have to give him some of my life some of some of the spirit back I may give him an offering of love and peace and joy and happiness instead of turning my back on him glory be to God he said then Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hungry see right here he had to change their Hunter they was hungering for the desires of the flesh see the blood oh can I say it like this see the blood of bulls and goats could not take away this appetite it could cover it it could cover it but it could not remove it until the spirit of God comes I can tell if you receive the holy spirit because of your appetite he said he that coming to me shall never hunger oh I love the Lord but but what the what what he's not gonna take your cane offering by the fruits of your false praise in your false altar your flowery outward appearance Cain thought that would get him by he'll say look I just give him fruits and the vegetables and I'll give you this how it'll be so much more prettier than Abel's we know he'll love the beauty he said I don't want an altar of one to be desired I want a bloody lamb I need a blood oh Hallelujah that's why they had to take their hand and lay it upon the lamb giving all of their SI all of their sins and their iniquities and their transgressions upon him oh Hallelujah but it becomes so ritualistic to them God said I see they need me because they then no longer did they bring in Lamb that they had raised that they had fed brother Stephen they said we'll come and buy from the priests and the priest was getting rich off of the people's sacrifice right how many are we seeing around the message getting rich off the people's sacrifice glory be to God we're not here to get rich off the people's sacrifice had just three things that get a man money women popularity everybody wants to preach on the money and the women but very few want to walk into the popularity hmm oh didn't that Spirit say you got to watch out you'll get the spirit of the servant on you like they did they said oh we are of Apollos I'm a poor I'm a Stephen I'm a josh he said who is Paul who is Apollos true he said Paul plant us Apollos Waters he said but it's God that give an increase I don't care how much brother Stephen plants how much I water if God don't bring the increase we're going to be a rotten Dead Sea [Music] unless they quickly power of the Holy Ghost hits us we're going to be dead and rotten [Applause] glory be to God foreign I wouldn't even understand the Bible if it hadn't been for a prophet oh Hallelujah when Satan give the appetite suppressants to the people he started giving them certain vitamins he said I'll give you the vitamin of P for pleasure seen that it was good I'll give you the the vitamin of P for popularity you'll be one you'll be a god people will look at you and be amazed at your greatness didn't Satan say the same thing he said I'll go I'll sit in well he's sitting in there he said I'll set in the synagogues of God and be worshiped as God he's done capture the denominations what is he after now your seat my seat [Music] he don't want us to come and worship God and he said ah give you a little vitamin C I'll make this word come coming to you you'll hear it but it won't have the same effect I'm not going to take away your hunger but I'm gonna make message common to you I've heard this that's what I hear more people I've heard this for years I've heard this for years and it ain't happened you know why because you've got to be spiritual to see what God's happening amen he said I'll give you a little common so that way you can reason with the message you can make it modern I'll even throw in a good old vitamin of him you can make it modern to them you can make Jesus modern you can make him money won't that be more better everybody will want to come worship a modern Jesus won't that be wonderful Brother John but he gave us this GPS that say that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he gave us a GPS that said I'm the Lord thy God here ye o Israel I'm the Lord thy God and I change not but you have to change him a little bit to draw the people now you know brother Stephen we have to cater to these young people we have to have certain programs that'll draw them that'll keep them in church let's give him a certain music a certain beat that makes their flesh Rejoice but yet they don't want the Holy Ghost [Music] [Applause] oh glory be to God but you know what I see when people desire the contemporary music and the things and that I see they've never had a nature change [Applause] let me tell you what Satan does he wants you to worship him under the umbrella of religion [Music] he wants you to feel it did you feel that it's not my feelings oh leave me I believe and when God does something to your heart hey when I used to get drunk I felt something I felt something I felt something when I partook of the wine when I took of the strong drink I felt something you know why guess what happened to them when they actually got to drink to change their nature and receive the Holy Ghost they thought they was drunk hey you know what Jesus didn't take my staggering out when the oil of the water when the when the when the oil when the wine of the word come I steal wobble when he comes it's not stimulating this it's stimulating this [Applause] he said we'll give him a modern music something that'll try you know we have to pay by thousands we must make a program for the people we must cater to them let's don't say everything God says anymore oh that kind of sounds like the the serpent doesn't it please come on that's why the Bible said try out the spirit and know whether it's of God or not then brother Brown said he seen the Prelude of the American bride she was being led by a witch to the beat of rock and roll twisting turning um the Holy Ghost knows how to present itself the Holy Ghost is a gentleman the Holy Ghost does not make us dance provocatively the Holy Ghost let's get there Hallelujah I feel the spirit of God to say this we're not here to entice our Lord we're not here to make the music sensual sexual perverted we're not here working to make love to God with a natural flesh we're here to make love to him through the spirit of God to the praise of God [Applause] you see those people they they sing so sensual [Music] what is the world what did President say when the man when they got the Holy Ghost those people in Africa that know nothing they didn't know the clay said they covered themselves and guess what the church world's doing she's uncovering herself she's showing she's a testimony of just what Revelation said she'd be miserable wretched blind and naked in North they're so happy at their tattoos they're so happy with their earrings have you heard this song brother Richie no I have not don't do something for you I said yes it makes me sick [Music] if sin does not make you sick I can see you're still have the appetite of the flesh if you walk and see perversion and it doesn't bother you now you need a change of appetite you know what our problem is we've let the world become so common to us that we can't determine what's God and what's the world you can't tell me you're a daughter of God and shack up with Satan all week [Music] people don't even know it and they're under the spirit of leprosy because their appetite is the flesh why did the leprosy attack the flesh because that's where the weakness begins door record Jesus said you'd been better off you hadn't known what about people that do know and they're still doing it do we not understand that is Iniquity he that knoweth to go good and doeth it not God help us brother you know the only way we're going to line up we got to be born again we don't need a modern music what's wrong with the music we already have Brother John let me ask you this question I'm going to ask you a question now let's say brother Stephen you love this certain kind of candy bar maybe it's a Mars we'll say it's Mars candy bar and you you'd eat it if I give it to you because that's what you like that's what that's what you have this let's just say it's something good I mean it won't hurt you ain't no seeing anything but here I'm going to wrap it in in full and I'm going to drop it in the port of John and I'm going to tell you is brother Stephen it's in there but you're going to have to keep reaching out and get it if you want it think about it think about it when you reach into those CDs to pull those songs out and you come to church and say Pastor pray for me I'm depressed where did you reach what did you obtain when you reached was it worth the reach [Applause] was it worth it then you come to church and you stink you come smelling like the table of vomits and you expect my God to sit down and eat with you didn't David tell us he said he'd leadeth me Miss dad still waters Steel Waters cause a lamb gets nervous Troubled Waters I can't drink from there to move too fast too and everybody wants to speed everything up then brother Graham said they'll speed up not us huh we'll get right in there oh Hallelujah you gotta cross and the dimensions at the rights the same speed is the only thing that'll bring you in there don't be too fast don't be too slow just stay steady Reverend said I love the more oak trees they stay steady when the storm comes oh Hallelujah praise be to God as you're thankful for the truth oh my listen to this in The Thirst I'm gonna try to let you go trying to I'm trying to try and hand it up here he said and there's nothing can satisfy that thirst that's in the human being serpent knew that look we just talked about that nothing can satisfy that amen I don't care what you do when I was out in the world nothing satisfied me I look for it in drugs brother Stephen I look for it in alcohol I look for it in rock and roll I look for it in Soul music I look for it in jazz music but I could not find Jesus no I didn't you know why the people say you're so hard but originally because I used to worship Him I know what he's like brother Steve I never forgot what he desires he desires worship hmm do you know music was the only thing that was created in heaven for worship and he put Satan over it Satan says I know I can't stop them from worshiping him but we're going to worship him like I do foreign God help us oh my then we got another one that wants to change the appetite we're going to jump in I'm in the water now I like it I like swimming in the truth it's up to us to swim or sink you know why many drown because they never learned how to swim you didn't God didn't taste the fish how to swim he just put him in the water God has not taught us to believe he's created the believer in US oh Hallelujah Hallelujah my goodness thank God Hallelujah but we got one Spectrum but just listen to tapes hey I am if you get to the place where I have to tag you my brother Stephen has to tell you to listen your appetite's messed up but see you don't really know he takes a good thing like listen to it we shouldn't listen we should ask how we know the word because we needed a teacher we need to profit ain't you thankful for the truth we needed somebody to tell us scriptures Never Lie he said I'll not reveal nothing until I reveal it to my servants to Prophet first but we got this spectrum and brother Stephen as I begin to look at that you know what it is it takes away the value just don't like people don't make people happy birthday makes people mad but I'm going to tell the truth and if it makes you mad then get right [Music] because the truth don't make people mad if you're not doing right you could do right he took away the value and then when they do preach they put it in they sit there like they're looking and listening to a tape they lose the ability to pull from the Life Ministry Satan does this have to stay home and listen to tape go ahead you can't do it and be a real Christian you'll die the longer you lay in the water the rotner you get until you learn to swim you're rot that's the truth a good thing brother Stephen see how crude he is how subtle he said I'll just change their appetite and they say you've got to put brother Brown back in the Pulpit God took him out how can man put him in foreign the fivefold ministry is the prophet to the bride that's exactly right the revelation of the word we're just repeaters of the word I know they say oh you're just a parrot I'd rather be a parent than a death mute you know what we're doing what did the prophet say he said just say what I say he said you preachers you take this message which was the Bible show me where he missed it in the Bible show me show me I can't find it [Music] then I'll show you where you missed it in the Bible [Music] oh Hallelujah it has to come that way but it takes away the value yeah I'm against that if you don't want to listen to the tapes I don't care who you are if it ain't in your heart to do it you're not going to do it I mean if I and after Pastor tell you you want to listen this because I just want to preaching on that's all right I mean we we did a man that's ordained of God to do things you're supposed to do it I know this God help me say it in the word it's balanced not to where it throws you off to one side or the other I'm staying in the middle of the road I'm Walking the Tightrope I'm coming The Razor's Edge I like what brother Neville said one time he said unless you've been can become a spiritual tapeworm you'll never ever be able to walk across the sword of the word because it will cut you off one way or the other you must know how to walk when you're crossing the word because the word Cuts going and coming well and I heard a brother one time he said man I'm gonna throw that out there I'm just gonna cut that people up I said brother it's a boomerang I said you throw it out there I said it's coming right back at you we don't throw it out there [Music] we let God use the sword but we got to have a balance yes we should listen and I listen to him nobody has to tell me to listen to it God might move on brother Stephen listen to this message he might move on me to listen to this other message but when we come together we're saying the same thing that's the paradox is the spirit and the bride are saying the same thing when the Bible tells us do not stay home but assemble yourselves together even more so [Applause] oh my God I almost want to read something right here can I go here no Satan's running my time I see him jumping on that on that clock because he's a creature of time I told him and I said Satan you know what I'm glad you are a creature of time I really am because I don't have an expiration date and you do because you're going to decrease and I'm increasing the Holy Spirit speaking in the scriptures tonight said we might serve him all the days of our life in Holiness before him that cleanliness and Holiness but today you can mention the word holy and people laugh at it that's the first thing they do they tell you you think you're better than you than I am because you don't cut your hair you think you're better than me because you don't wear pants you think you're better than me no I don't I'm a sinner saved by grace really that's their appetite he said without Holiness no man shall see God that's why people don't see that's why they don't see Brothers then he said laugh at it see how Satan's got the people all wrapped up I love what he said he said you are a slave and if you are a Christian you're a spawn slave to the Lord Jesus Christ what does that mean when you become a slave that shows that he he has become Lord over your life Paul said I'm not my own I've been bought with us with a price that means I don't have a say coming I don't have a word in myself I am a eunuch I have been circumcised of all my thinking all of my reasoning all my abilities to interpret the word under my own but only speak the word as it's interpreted to us you know what the fivefold ministry is it's dietitians you know when you're all messed up and your body's messed up they had to put you on a certain diet foreign not a suppressant never wants you to stop eating God don't want you to become bulimic he wants you to eat the right thing what is a dietitian it's a professional who has this special training in diet and nutrition that's what he made John he said eat the book John then you become the book John what are dietitians they're just ones that gives the nutritions that God has for us gives us the real vitamins we need to eat and the right kind of food to eat to make sure you're eating the right diet why people are so spiritually dead is because their diet is ruined look in Ephesians 4 11 and he gave some apostles some Prophets some evangelists I thought brother Stephen was going to get on my topic tonight and some pastors and some teachers for what for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ turn women to Second Timothy can we let's just show if we really think you know how bad we need to find full ministry let's just look um oh my goodness praise God second Timothy 3. amen let's just look at the diet that Paul told Timothy to feed the people oh glory be to God verse 14. let's go with verse 13. he said but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived he said oh I love I read a quote the Abraham said I'm right here and I know I know time's running but you know what he said he'll let you brother Stephen he'll make you believe a lie when you reject the truth and he'll damn you for believing it said he turned you over to a reprobate mind oh look at this verse 14 he says but continue thou continue thou in the things which thou has learned and has been assured of knowing of whom thou Hast learned them don't repeat to God this was not a man it was God speaking through a man he said and that from a child that thou know the holy scriptures which are able to make the wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus all scripture is given by inspiration of God it is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly Furnishing unto you all good works in Ministry that we might Supply God may give us the understanding of the word to give to you that you might know the instructions of God he said do what I have instructed you with have you noticed let's check our appetite before we go do you know when a woman brother Abram when your wife pregnant and she she has a strained appetite for things sometimes huh because there's a vitamin in there one day she may want pickles and ice cream that sounds crazy to you but there's a certain vitamin in that pickle and there's a certain vitamin in that ice cream that that baby wants [Music] um just obey the appetite of the spirit and feed not the appetite of the flesh the Bible tells us no no man after the flesh not even the man Christ Jesus we have to know one another by the spirit he said try the spirit in the words of God your appetite is what shows you are in the message perseverance this is it I'll let you go he said now that's the way to get something done he said now that's the way you congregation out there ought to be about your pastor that's when God will answer he said that's when God will answer that's right you've got to approach God's gifts the right way you cannot give a gift unless you know how to approach the gift Hallelujah he said that's right you've got to approach God's gifts the right way with reverence where's the reverence for the message anymore what's the reverence for the final four Ministry God help us oh that's just brother Stephen that's Brother Sam is it is it that's what they say oh it was just brother Brown's opinion I guess it was just Paul's opinion too I guess it was just Matthew's opinion Isaiah's opinion I guess it was Moses opinion when he told when God spoke and said write this I said on that same old devil brother Stephen he said reverence and the ministry is Minister gifts their gifts in the body five spiritual gifts that's predestinated and foreign of God to the church he said I know there's nine local gifts there's gifts anybody don't disrespect those either but these are God's office gifts I love how he says that the office of Apostles prophets teachers pastors and evangelists and we must respect them if we expect something from God let us stand that's where Satan is wanting to get us to do to disrespect the word of God and this if he can't get you to disrespect the word of God it just to get you to disrespect the man of God then when you disrespect the man of God little do you know you're disrespecting the word of God he said give double honor I'm not trying to get honor to me or brother Stephen or any of that ministers he said give double honor to those who labor in the house you know what I wanna I want to if you do that I'm going to give that back to him I'll take the rose and give him the bouquet amen do you know what brother Brown said we're missing out on the Vitamin Power of the Holy Ghost that's the greatest vitamin you have need of oh Hallelujah in the message countdown he said when a when a man is filled with the Holy Ghost something's in him he said that's full of God's spiritual vitamins he said makes him praise God shout and get and act different because why he's no longer Earth bound Ary he is a he is setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus ever hit by a rock lives he'll say tonight Lord please help me to have a better appetite for you father I have filled it with too much time on this and that and this other things father your Prophet said we can do too much of everything we can read too much we can Fellowship too much but we can never pray too much Lord father God give us a stronger prayer life than we've ever had God give us a greater a greater appetite for your presence than we have ever had because father you'll respond because you said David hunger and thirst for righteousness shall be filled father help us Lord you're the only one brother Stephen can't help us I can't help us the singers can't help us the only way we're going to leave better is because of you father you said my sheep know my voice and a stranger they won't follow oh God help us help us Lord Jesus tonight father to stay in that message God to eat the book lord so we may become a word bride that we may be exposed to you as the chase virgin not a naked lady dancing to the beat of rock and roll but a lady that knows how to worship her her husband gone followed by honor and respect God grant it to us in Jesus Christ name amen amen is that the Lord amen amen sure appreciate the Lord appreciate your hunger the hunger will bring up him praise God amen let's give the Lord the clap of me thank you amen appetite change what else can we say we need to check our appetite amen check what we're doing with our phones check what we're doing with our time and those in the music check what you are pulling or feeding on as a resource to sing a special or to sing here make sure you are checking screening the resource with the word that has been presented here amen amen when I wrestle with someone in counseling and I'm wrestling over and over and over and over it is telling me they're already struggling amen because when the word your attitude shows the level of your spirituality amen there is things about Christians that when we speak we click quickly and we agree and we move on and we see okay I see if you're wrong you just say I was wrong and that's it amen but when the word is being brought and you are wrestling and you're fighting and you're fighting all I'm seeing is you have exalted something above the word of God that's why you don't submit anymore you're trying to reason it out amen amen now I have to struggle we feel like the angel in Jacob and I have to find a uh uh a correct spot to punch you pretty good heart so I'm speaking spiritually I'm not going to punch anyone I'm speaking spiritually let me say this way the holy spirit will show me where to strike pretty hard and to bring you a little bit to make you a little bit weaker so you can receive the word of God amen don't fight with the word humility is the ability to be able to humble yourself before the word when I say the ability to humble yourself before the word it doesn't means when the word come all the time you will say Amen sometimes when the world comes it's contrary to what your flesh is craving okay now that's where the true Son of God is now brought to a test now you need to rise above and say father I'm still struggling with this but because your word said let me humble myself maybe I don't understand why I don't understand why we go in this direction I don't understand why it's going this way but in obedience to your word let me stop down and step down as soon as you do that the devil is powerless everybody okay everybody okay so don't struggle with the word amen if you're wrong just admit you wrong amen if staying at home missing church is wrong when somebody bring you the word and say staying at home is wrong don't wrestle with it don't begin to explain anything just say Lord help me the Lord knows my heart brother I'm trying the best that I can but I know what I'm doing is wrong but don't try to push to push to push because before you know it we get in a habit if you miss one Wednesday service you miss the second Wednesday service the third one is the service the fourth if you miss two months there is more chances you will never come to Wednesday and the devil will always convince you that you right to stay and to stream he will do that on Sunday he will do that for one month for two months and you will see people missing services for just a little bit of reason but they're going to Walmart they don't want to miss Walmart every program in the uh in the day is is kept except the church every program if you have to go to work you will go to work you will not cancel work because you're not feeling good but you will cancel church because you don't feel good if you're wrong don't wrestle amen when the word comes when you see the scripture coming the first time the second time the third take your hand off amen because you might find yourself fighting against God humble yourself check your appetite if you're watching something that is wrong take it out God didn't come to put you down he came to help you to zero Dean where the devil is trying to pull you say watch that area clean it up quickly because the enemy is working there get it off and then we keep moving that is the purpose of coming into the house of Lord amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly tonight Lord father thanking you once again for your grace for your love and for your mercy and for speaking to us tonight Lord father many things has been spoken many Avenues has been touched Lord and father you know
