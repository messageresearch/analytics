Shalom bride thank you Lord thank you [Applause] Lord Divine amen God bless you Church um I want to give this quick testimony of what God has done for me this year um I kind of want to start off with um after I graduated high school a month after that I went to um an Institute like a skin care Institute um and it was like a one-year Institute because just just like just by my character I just kind of like getting things done so you know in my whole like my vision I was like okay I'll finish high school went straight to the Institute and then after that you know I'm GNA see what God's going to do and just continue on with school or you know career wise but then um so after I graduated um High School the month after that you know Co it was around that time so everything was kind of shut down I was in school um via zoom and then after a while for the Practical the physical things that we had to do we we finally went back to school so um that was done and then when it came to um my exams I have to take two exams one practical which was in Raleigh um and then a theory exam which was 110 questions and um so I took the test twice because you have to you basically have to take both you have to pass both in order to um get get your um your um your license through the state so I took my test twice um and I failed twice it was 110 questions was really hard and we only had an hour and 30 minutes to finish it off um I was always that student in school that um would take every single minute left um when we had exams and tests and everybody was like I hurry up and finish the test but um so that was just pressure on me but um especially around that time the first time I took it um that was right after school so I kind of had all the material in my head so I tried my best and I failed it and then the um the second time I took it I was with my mom so after I took it I think I think I I think I took it like four months after that I took the exam and I failed again um and then after that my mom passed and everything so I was just kind of like not motivated to do anything and around that time um we basically had three limits so basically if you take the test the third time and you failed it you basically have to kind of go back in school again and you know we don't have that system again here in North Carolina so I have to go to like a l or anything or something like that and the school was already expensive it was like 10K so and I know that God um you know wanted me to be in this path cuz you because he provided the funds through financial AED and grants so um I just you know kept pressing on and then um so after I graduated and everything um I usually go back to school just to get like skincare products again because we can get skincare products discounted for us um so I went to the school and then I was talking to my administrator who actually became the director after cuz at first the one who was there before she told us that you know as long as she's that she's the director we can get our skin um our product discounted so I went to school and then I came there and she said oh you know the lady left so I was kind of disappointed I was like oh my God she left now I can't get my skincare products discounted because they're so expensive but then I was just telling her I was like oh I took the test twice already I failed it twice and then she was like oh no um don't worry um you know they actually took off the pinch and now you can take as much as you want and you know you won't get penalty for it so that was just that was like my the first Tes well part one kind of um I was very happy because that kind of relieved all the pressure of like you know the third time I take if I fell again then I have you know basically my life is over or whatever so so then um that definitely um helped me and and and motivated me to kind of you know to start um um practicing again and studying again and going over my books Etc and of course with the preaching of the word that was coming forth about faith and um um you know speaking um the word and then I was just telling myself over and over the third time I'm going to take this test the third time I'm goingon to take this test I'm going to pass I'm G to pass and then I remember Sister Rosemary who gave her testimony about taking the test and knowing that she failed but you know God you know um basically answered all the questions for her and she knew that she passed and then zaddy um talking about how you know all her test was examed I was like Lord can you just like can you please give me a call and say that you know they made a mistake all those years I passed the test instead just something um but and then um one time when I was talking to brother stepen sister Sharon um he really motivated me and then I remember um prior to that the next Sunday he preached about non and and and the little girl girl and it was the little girl Faith you know that healed n in so for me I was like brother Stephen was like the little girl and my dad because they kept kind of pushing me to you know you got to take the test you know and then he kind of gave me like a um a study guide way to kind of do it so I was just you know I was okay I have two months so 2023 I already told myself you know one of my things I went to I wanted to take this test and then the year kind of went by and then I only had like three months um before the year is over so then um I just I just kind of calcul I was okay two months I'm going to take this test um and I'm just going to start taking like I'm practicing at least 20 to 50 questions every day so that's what I was doing and then one time I was actually at on my cousin's house and I met this girl she was just talking and she actually was an aesthetician too so she ended up kind of um helping me to kind of get a study guy a study Guy where I can um um practice the test too so I just kept every day 20 Questions 50 questions a day um and then I officially took my test Thursday I took my test Thursday and I brought my sister I think I thought that um you know cuz the third time I'm going to take it I'm I'm going to give my results the same day um so you know it's just just I can get um so I can read my uh uh my results so I went down I went down that day I took the test and then usually like I said the test was um 110 questions and only had an hour and 30 minutes so I actually finished the test um under in under 30 minutes and I had a whole hour just to kind of go back and review and I was shocked to myself because I I know myself I take every single minute um and and I just knew at that moment that I passed it so I was just glorifying God I was like thank you Lord thank you Lord for helping me pass cuz I knew I passed this test i l just stay I literally just said my seat just to be humble so I won't make everybody else nervous cuz I was finished like this but then I realized everything that I studied was exactly on the test the words the wording everything so um so I was just I just knew God was with me so I took the test and then um um Friday came um actually didn't get the results the same day the the email did to me so the email did to me I didn't want to look at it I was like I know I passed I know I passed so I gave it to my sister so she can um so she can email it to herself so we can like make a video of us like reacting to the um the score so yeah so the next day come I think last Sunday um we went out and then we um we all like I was just waiting and then she read my score to me and it said that I passed 82% out of a 100 that mean that meant that I only made out of0 questions I only missed 18 so I got 91 correct I just want to give glory to God that um I officially got my [Applause]

the meeting of David let's push the break there just to give you a background David was running away because Saul wanted to kill him amen so David decided to leave the Kingdom of Israel because the kingdom of Saul have rejected him and remember David is a type of Christ he he has been rejected by his own people so David now is running away are we together as David begin to run away for some reason his GPS change I have to go this way so you catch where I'm going when his GPS change his GPS begin to turn him toward the Tabernacle yes are you following me yes sir and maybe his military men look they say but boss we are going over into the Philistine in Gaza uhhuh okay we are going over the Philistine in Gaza whatever happened as a war it's in the scripture we are going over there in Gaza and he said no for some reason I need to go through knob what was the knob the sanctuary the Tabernacle the priest were there what is pushing David toward that direction we clear verse one and said to him why are you here alone why are you alone and no man with you it doesn't mean that David was alone right but David did not have the company of Saul they usually see him with the company of Saul Now they see him without anyone pertaining to the kingdom of Saul amen at the beginning of his ministry he was going through campaign he was going through battles using the army of Saul he was supported by Saul he was financed by sa his expedition were organized by S am but after while Saul David have to pull like a Shar like the grand he has to be separated from Saul Saul was a Jew David was a Jew but there must be a separation between the Jew and the Jew amen am are you following me amen now David separated or dissociate amen from the Full Gospel Ministry amen all the Full Gospel businessmen that were sponsoring his ministry at the beginning and having healing campaign David reached a point that he has to dissociate am the ministry of BR Bram reach a point where he have to be separated the Shar the seed cannot be held with the shack are we together amen are we okay I tap it and I went to what's going on Amen when he separate they ask him they say hey we usually see you with so and so where are they why are you alone but he was not alone he was with a company that doesn't belong to Saul he belongs to David we clear now okay verse two and David said to aimc the priest the King has commanded me a business and has said to me let no man know any anything of the business where about I send you and what I have commanded you and I have appointed my servant to such and such a place now therefore what is under your hand give me what five loaves of bread so what was David looking at so David as he fleeing instead of going to any other city of Israel to go find bread for some reason something came over him to go only toward the Tabernacle toward the priest and when he reached the priest he said priest you know what what do you have in your hand yes the priest say what do you mean he say bread yes David was looking for bread amen amen amen am amen amen praise God verse uh three and give me Five Loaves how many loaves five which means one give me five loaves of bread in my hand or what there is what present I need five or whatever you have but what I desire is five Grace a bread of Grace amen amen in other word PRI do you have any food here can I have five loves but something happened in that place before David get there for some reason when the chef was working in the kitchen the chef cooked so good are you following me that every priest finished all the food and there was no food how can David go in a place where there is no food and asking for food let's go verse uh four and the priest answered David and say there is what no common bread under my hand in other word there is no normal bread in this Place everybody finish it whatever was cook is gone yes amen amen we are in the state of emergency now somebody needed bread there is no bread where can we find bread amen amen why did it happen that when David get there there's no bread David got there in the day where there is no bread amen if there was bread all they had to do is take bread give it to him but because there is no bread it down amen yes sir whatever push David to that area begin to open a different door am are you following me whatever push David to the city of Knob yes sir amen first ask for bread when they say there is no bread David should have said okay no problem let me go to the next city but whatever took David there doesn't give that opportunity in other word the GPS already say you have arrived if you have arrived bread must come out am I don't know if you get me amen I'm in other word I'm not going to leave this place if there is no bread if the bread is finished am you a manufacture some bread if you if you understand where I'm taking you your life is going to change amen amen amen so in this life when there is a blockage never back up quick [Applause] [Music] amen blockage doesn't mean it's not there the block the obstacle you find in life sometime doesn't mean go back im mean whatever is there is not your [Applause] level are you getting what I'm saying because sometime we get discourage quickly oh I came here it's not there you want to go no no no no no no no who Tau you to go because you don't see it doesn't mean it's not there maybe what your caliber don't require that David was coming for the bread there is no bread the best thing to do is okay thank you let me go to the next McDonald but David say uh-uh this GPS took me here and if you notice David is precise yes he says give me five loves so in other word he knew there is food there but when he get there they say there is no food he say okay there is no food look what kind of food comes up you there amen verse four and the priest answered David and say there is no common bread under my hand but there is what hallowed [Music] bread there is no common bread so if you search everywhere no bread but there is only one type of bread what is going on with this bread amen follow me carefully so I make sure this sinking okay this is not a sermon we run quickly amen amen in The Book of Leviticus 24 the Bible says this in verse 5 he say and thou shall take fan Flur we went through this in the mystery of the table of the showbread and bake how many cakes 12 cakes thereof oh 12 breads thereof two1 a deal shall be in one cake we already went through this and thou shall set them in how many row two rows in other word for reminder the Tabernacle have three part you know that amen amen amen we have the other court we have the Holy place and we have the holiest everybody clear in here you only have the Ark of the Covenant which have the Mana and the road and everything here you have the brais and alar you have the lever when you enter there you got the Candlestick everybody remember and then you have the altar of incense right but somewhere here there was a table and the table have food yes sir you remember that amen we went through that the Bible says in verse 6 and thou shall set them in how many r two rows six on AOW which is a number of men upon the pure table before who the Lord and thatou shall put what pure frankincense upon each roow so those bread had frankincense on it you already know what it means sir frankness means the service sir so it's a bread when you eat it put you in service you cannot eat that bread and be quiet once you eat that bread you begin to do stuff he put you in the service for Jehovah amen are we together that's why only the priest were allowed to eat it amen because the priests were working for Jehovah amen amen but we got a problem here a normal man is looking for bread but there is no bread but that one amen the answer is simple you're not a priest we can't give it to you you need to find another station we clear verse three uh seven and it shall put pure frankincense upon each Ro that he may be on the bread for a what Memorial even an offering made by fire unto who the Lord watch this every Sabbath He Shall Set it how in order before the Lord continually stop so the bread that changed when the Sabbath was which day the seventh day yes sir so you have the first day the second the third the fourth the fifth the sixth on the seventh day on the seventh day is the day they swap the bread in other word this bread cannot be eaten until the seven days he have to stay before the Lord six days no one can touch it are we together have I lost anyone the Bible says every Sabbath He Shall Set it in order before who the Lord how continually in other words there cannot be a day that the Tabernacle do not have bread amen amen when the when the seventh day happen they just take those out and they put new one in other word if you run out of bread in Israel there is one place guaranteed to bread and that place is in the Tabernacle if nobody have bread elsewhere in Israel just change your GPS to the Tabernacle the Tabernacle always have a bread are we together and David ared that day amen amen and there is no bread are we together sir but if David arrive the first day they cannot give him bread amen amen amen because you don't change the bread on the first day you cannot change the bread on the third day the only way that bread can be available you have to reach that spot on the seventh day are we together are we together the Bible says this being taken from the children of Israel by an Everlasting Covenant verse 9 and it shall be to who Aaron and he water and they shall eat it in the water so you don't even take that bread and eat it somewhere else whenever they pull it away whoever take the bread out is in the Holy place and when he's in the Holy place he sit there and eat right there am but the holy place no one can enter there only the priest how are we going to get access to that bread we clear amen the Bible says for it is the most holy unto him of the offering of the Lord made by fire by a Perpetual water stat 1 Chronicle 9:32 and other of their Brethren of the son of the croat were over the what showbread he prepared it how every Sabbath so the bread was cooked on the Sabbath and was replaced on the Sabbath amen if you come before the Sabbath that bread is not available even though it's there and even if that bread is available you must be a priest to eat it but whatever push David there amen amen amen have the power to break the law amen everybody okay what brought David into the Tabernacle if you don't have common bread that thing won't go back it will find a way to find bread and to pull the bread from the Tabernacle and give it to David what is that thing are we together yes let's go back to the where we are verse four and the priest answered David and say there is no common bread under my hand but there is what hallowed bread which is the show bread there is hallow bread if the young man have kept themsel at least from what women if you sanctify yourself I can give it to you but remember remember according to the law no one can eat this only lied where is this new law coming out according to the Mosaic law there is no one can eat it only the Le David is not a Le David is not a priest David is only a prophet amen so why is delivered taking a risk to give David something that is not lawful where did he get that Authority verse five and David answered the priest and said to him of a truth what women have been kept from us about these three days about these three days we didn't mess around with churches amen amen so there were three days that David went without getting into churches three days am amen the bread is change on which day Sabbath day and David said three days we consecrated ourself amen are we together so are we okay so in the fifth day and the sixth day and the seventh day is when David ra am we okay thank you let's go verse uh five and then David answerer the priest and said to him of a truthful women have been kept from us about these three days since I came out and the vessels of the young man are how holy you must be holy to enter there and the bread is in a in a man how because we are consecrated that bread we can also eat it but the Lord say you cannot eat it if you're not a priest so what brought David there open the door not only for David but for also those that were following David amen he says yeah though he were how Sanctified do you see that word this day in the what vessel so the priest gave him what hallowed bread did David enter there he didn't enter there the priest went and took the bread but God say where do you eat eat that bread who gave the priest the permission to take that bread out of the Holy place and gave it to David when David ate did he die how can you eat something that belong to the priest and nothing happened to you are you following me praise God verse six so the priest gave him Hall bread for there was no bread there but the what show bread every bread was finished but the showbread and the showbread had the Restriction what I'm trying to show you is whenever circumstances are blocked whatever push you there amen have another gear that he can push and open another door even though it seems to be no door amen amen are we together it says there was no bread there but there what showbread the showbread which I read to you that was taken from what before the Lord stop if he was taken before the Lord it was which day so David arrive which day why did David AR there only the seventh day and every bread is finished only that bread is available whatever push David there open David for the first time in his life to taste of the showbread that no one else can taste only the priest amen there are seven days here which you can see the seven churches there are three days only that he kept himself which is Luther Westley and Pentecost justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost that's when he reached I'm not going to get into that you already seen that amen amen and then the Bible say and then the sh bread that was taken from before the Lord to put what hot bread in the day when he was what away when he was taken away so this bread was hidden for seven days yes and was available on the seventh day and David came and and and and recuperate that on the first day nobody ate it the second day nobody ate it the third no one only the seven day and David come and pick it up amen amen what give David the authority to eat a bread that do not belong to a common person the Bible says this in the book of Hebrew verse 7 that for he of whom these things are spoken pretend to what to another tribe another tribe of which no man gave what attendance at the altar do you know that person right it's called melkisedek for it is evident that our Lord sprang out of what Judah of which tribe Moses spake what nothing concerning priesthood and it is yet far more evident that after the similitude of who there arise another what so the tribe of Judah had a priesthood that was hidden amen it was a secret priesthood that no one knew about it everybody okay that priesthood was not in effect yet because the levitical priesthood was in in effect amen but when David reached that point and he was in need amen amen and the bread the common bread was not available that priesthood open the dooren and gave David the permission to eat something that he's not lawful to eat because David was from the tribe of Judah and David was a type of Christ amen are we together are we together job to verse uh 8 you're almost there my friend verse 8 and David said to aimc is there not here under your hand what spear or sword amen for I have neither brought my what sword nor my what weapons with me because the king's business require what haste and the priest said the sword of who the the who the Philistines whom you do what SL in the valley of a behold it is here wrapping the what a CL behind the what the E the EOD was the so they took the sword and they put it behind the I'm reading the Bible when David killed Goliath yes sir amen David took the sword from golad you know the story and cut the head of golad when the battle was over they took that sword and they wrap it in other word they put a sheath on a sword and they took it and they went not in front of the eord they put it behind on the back side on the back side of the eord on the back side of the r that's where they put the soul are you following me because the backside of the Bible have a seal are we together are we okay have I lost anybody so we found out that whatever brought David to this place open the door not only to the showbread but to a sword a sword that is behind the EUR a sword that is on the back side amen amen what trigger David to go to that place who push him there are we together verse n he said the sword of Goliath amen who you slew in the valley of hila behold it is here wrapping a clo behind the what if you would take that do what take it for there is no other save that here the only weapon in the Tabernacle is a sword amen remember that sword came from Goliath yes you cannot take a new sword to kill Goliath you cannot take a new Bible to destroy denomination amen you have to take what Luther and the other did and you pull the Bible and you slay them am amen you cannot fight without this Bible but this Bible came before the message came but the problem is something was sealed the Bible was sealed amen praise God he said for there is no other save that here and David said there is what none like that do what give it David is saying that he never seen a sword that look like that one it's a different sword Al together amen so David changed sword from his own sword to the sword that he did kill Goliath before the sword that gave him the greatest victory of Israel he's using the back sword that same Ministry that help him kill Goliath he's using back that same Ministry now to begin to do something else amen amen amen what are we drawing from here there is something that happened to David that changed his Direction he pushed him toward the temple when David went into the Tabernacle he found out that there were no common bread amen amen but then David never stopped there right whatever pushed him there open him the door to go beyond the law and to eat the showbread and nothing happened to him and he take the showbread and give also to the people that came with him and nothing happened to them then David move again furthermore he said do you have any weapon here and they brought him a sword so he got the bread and the SW together and left the Tabernacle what pushed David there Matthew 12 we already pray my friend if you dare you can say Amen Matthew 12 verse one if you thereare you can say Amen which day did David attend the Tabernacle which was called the Sabbath amen and there was no restriction for David Matthew 12 verse1 at that time Jesus went on the water Sabbath day which day David went into the Tabernacle Sabbath day which day Jesus is going to the field the Sabbath day why he went on the Sabbath day through the what corn and his disciple not Jesus his disciple were how in hunger who gave them the power to to enter the corn Jesus who gave them the power to enter the H yes L who was hungry Jesus who was hungry the disciple the disciple being hungry under the Lord they break into somebody else cornfield but it happened on the Sabbath day we clear he says and the disciple were hungry and begin to plug the ears of corn you remember the scripture now and to eat but when the Pharisees saw it they said to him behold your disciple do that which is not what lawful to do upon the what Sabbath day they did the Pharisee didn't have a problem with them eating because they knew the lord gave them permission to eat but the problem that the Pharisee had is they are eating on the seventh day on the Sabbath day there should be a home but this hunger is breaking the Sabbath this hunger not only is breaking somebody else property but it's also breaking the law of Sabbath are we together let's blend this with David verse three but he said to them have you not read what who David when when he was what in hungry David did that when he was what hry David did that again when he was what hungry so what pushed David to the Tabernacle what are we together now are we together now now you begin together it what pushed David to the Tabernacle hunger the hunger of David amen gave him access to the showbread amen and gave him access to a sword that hunger when he took David to the Tabernacle that hunger was looking for food and the priest said there is no food that hunger said mm me when I'm tricked I don't go back without food what kind of food do you have here no we have the sh I mean showbread you are not supposed to eat it that that hunger say me I can eat it he won't do anything we clear now he said David when he was hungry and they that were with him how he enter into the house of God and did eat what the showbread which was not lawful for who this is Jesus saying Jesus is saying that he was not lawful this is not a PRI this is God himself God Jesus is saying that he was not correct for David to eat the showbread Heaven and Earth will pass away but his word will not but God is saying that David was not supposed to eat the showbread but his hunger gave him the showbread and me God I kept my mouth quiet instead of killing David I could not do anything whyl Jesus say he ate the sh bread which was not lawful for him to do what eat neither for them which were what in other way David extrapolate he went over instead of stopping at himself he even take the showbread and give it to normal people and Jesus said he was not right but David did it and now Jesus is using that scripture that experience to combat the Pharisee amen what seems to be like it's against the law amen hunger open the door to it amen am am amen father help us amen amen he says with him but only for The Who PRI so Jesus is saying here that there is no one who's lawful to eat of the showbread except the priest but David did it why because he was hungry Jesus is replying to the Pharisee that you try to condemn me because I'm eating my disciple are eating on the Sabbath day okay I want you to remember do you remember David in the Old Testament he was just on the Sabbath day he was just so hungry as much as my disciple are hungry but he did worst because he went and took bread that he is not lawful to eat and he even give it to the people that were not lawful to eat so hunger open doors where there is no door amen are we together have I lost anyone hunger can get you into the field amen when it's not lawful amen amen hanger hunger gave permission to the disciple to break the Sabbath amen and we find out that hunger open the door for David Amen to behave like a priest why he ate the showbread amen and then also he took the sword from the Tabernacle and nothing happened to him amen amen amen now follow me carefully now as we claming in the Book of Luke let's go to Matthew 4 when I will begin to clim then you will SAR with me Matthew 4:1 if you dare you can say amen amen you there amen then was Jesus led up of the spirit into what who sent Jesus to the Wilderness do we have food in the wilderness do we have water in the wilderness who sent him there God sent Jesus Into the Wilderness God sent Jesus Into the Wilderness into the desert no food no water we clear and what happened to be tempted of the devil yes and when he had fasted how many days 40 days and how many Night 40 nights he was after what what and hunger when Jesus was fasting the devil was quiet amen yes he was now follow me carefully y please are you following me yes sir on the first day the devil was quiet second day the devil was quiet but after Jesus finished Jesus begin to hunger amen you following me David hungered he pushed him to the Tabernacle the deci hunger he pushed them into to Breaking the Sabbath are you following me if you hunger in the Old Testament you can enter a field and eat it and Jesus also hunger do you follow me as soon as Jesus begin to hunger the devil woke [Music] up you following me let's see what the devil is telling Jesus Christ verse three and when the tempter came to him he said if you do what be the Son of God do what command that the stones be made bread when Jesus hungered amen the devil came to him with a Temptation and the Temptation that the devil was asking Jesus Christ was to take a stone and to move it into a bread as a sign of a Son of God you following me yes in now the word a Son of God when he is hungry I don't know if you getting me I told you I'm taking off now a Son of God when he's hungry he he give him access to a power Hallelujah are you following me are you following me if you're not hungry nothing can happen but if something a desire begin to come in you it tells you that the power is also there I don't know if you following me amen because the devil understood that he say let me make him do what I want to do God because I know if it's a Son of God and he's hungry anything can happen to him Hallelujah are you following me amen are you following me hunger in your life open your door to the [Applause] impossible I don't know if you get mejah Hunger

because you're not spiritual enough everybody okay sometime you will feel something coming in you and you don't know how to catch it because you are not trained right because you were not taught before you thought it was you thinking it is not you [Applause] thinking Have I Lost somebody Chief have I lost you listen to this my friend verse four but he answer said and say what it is written man shall know what live by bread alone where did Jesus get the scripture I'm going to show you where this scripture came from amen Jesus turned around he said you know what men shall not leave by what bre alone but by every what word let's keep that I'm going to get to that later amen amen amen the Bible say Jesus was in the wilderness follow me carefully and Jesus was hungry so Jesus must have food can you find food in the wilderness no can you find water in the wilderness so that food must be created are you following me are you following me jop to verse 11 let's see the food Jesus ate if you dare you can say Amen if you dare you can say Amen amen few people amen verse 11 then the who devil did what leaveth him and behold who Angels came and did what ministered unto him who gave him food Angels what kind of food do they give Jesus Angelic food in which place in the wilderness do you know that Israel when he was in the wilderness God gave them Mana amen and Mana was angel food amen do you know that am do you know that so when you get into a difficult situation and it seems like there is [Applause] no when you reach a desert A wilderness in your life and it seems like everything is blocking shake your desire amen if your desire is coming up it tells you the third pool is [Applause] there you don't you don't desire things when you are satisfied you desire things when you don't have it when you are [Applause] lacking if God give you a house do you desire a house again so if you desire a house it means that because you don't have it sir so the desire of a house is only something telling you what you missing yes sir are you following me are you following me so the hunger of Jesus Christ require a creative power and the hunger of Jesus Christ produce a food created Serve by Angel cook by Angel not not not your Chef the Angelic Chef in other way that food could not be given if Jesus was not hungry are you following me the food was not available on the first day it was not available on the 10th day it was not available on the 30th day it was not available on the 40th Day the food was available after the 40th Day when hunger kicking he opened the door to a spiritual food have I lost somebody did you sleep well follow this my friend I thought you going to swallow this very good which scripture is there my friend Mark 11 um verse 12 14 which scripture is there please BR this is strong I know why I'm dropping this okay okay if you are sleeping Shake somebody okay wake up my friend okay which scripture is there Mark 11 Mark 11 right Mark 11 we speak about it all the time in the message Mark 11 Mark 11 Mark 11 okay let's see what happened in Mark 11 please follow me carefully Mark 11 verse what 12 what does the Bible say on the water tomorrow when he come from what bethan he was how hungry who was hungry Jesus the hunger of Jesus what does he do are you are we together verse 30 and seeing a what a big tree a far off what pushed Jesus toward the Fig Tree hunger are we together the hunger of Jesus Christ push him toward the Fig Tree as the hunger of David push him toward the Tabernacle are you following me and he came if what happily perhaps he might found what anything there on and when he came to it he found what nothing but Le when David entered to the Tabernacle did he find common bread did he back up what happened to David he got his bread that was reserved for the pries when Jesus got to the tree he was looking for food there was no food his hunger didn't back up are you following me the Bible say and when he came to it he found nothing but what for the what time of figs was not yet so Jesus went to look for food when it was not the season of food amen hunger doesn't care about the season hunger doesn't look who is in the power whether it's a Democrat or Republican hunger doesn't look the stock market hunger doesn't look at the economy hunger look for the [Applause] desire because normally Jesus should have stopped and say wait a minute this is not the season this is not the right place but his hanger his hunger was looking like where is the a tree there must be food there amen when he got there there is no food amen look what anointing open up a normal just a normal hunger just normal I'm hungry and when Jesus get there an anointing drop on him what level of anointing verse 14 Jesus answered and say unto it what no man eat fruit of be Hereafter forever and the disciple did what heard it and what happened the next day wither down the tree was what wither so brother Bram used this you heard it all over the message to show the power of the spoken word where you speak to this mountain and say be removed and Jesus Jesus opened the power by hunger So Hunger open the door to the creative power of God Amen in other word when that hunger come if that which the hunger is looking for is not there the hunger will created it Hallelujah sir sir are we together are we together the hunger of Jesus Christ the devil P show him that as a Son of God Son as a Son of God that hunger intitled Jes the power to create bread in the wilderness amen the power of Jesus Christ before the tree the hunger gave Jesus power to even curse the tree amen until the disciple that not even the tree if you have something that you're looking for and you look at this mountain and your mountain is in the place speak look at that hunger that hunger will move Mountain my subject this [Music] [Applause] morning is Teachers to pray the secret of thirst and hunger amen am my time is good if you fool you tell me we are dealing with givers this day what our daily prayer or givers how day by day our what Daily Bread this Daily Bread here call us to a walk of Faith because what God give you today you see it but you don't see what is tomorrow but because God provide day by day you can enter tomorrow by faith amen even though you don't see tomorrow yet that's why Paul say for we walk by what fa or Not by what sight are we together when Israel was coming out of Egypt Paul is mentioning of two things Paul say and all did what eat the same spiritual meat and did what drink the same spiritual drink if you notice at the meat and the drink are both spiritual that's right spiritual doesn't mean imaginary because Israel ate man amen Israel didn't just have what the imaginary water Israel drunk water amen so when Israel was hungry he brought forth a food from a supernatural Angelic food amen are we together yes sir are you following me when Israel was thirsty Israel got water yes sir but water from what amen the Bible says in verse four and did all drink water the same spiritual drink and the drunk of that water spiritual Rock So The Rock was natural or spiritual spiritual Rock that Rock that did what follow them have you ever seen a rock following somebody never never have you ever seen a rock following somebody and that rock was who so Paul is saying that the water that was given to Israel that fill 2 million people and the Beast was coming from an individual am are you following me so if you look at that individual he look like a human being amen when you go 300 around him you don't see water but if you hit that individual are you following me you will see that individual begin to produce water and you drink when you finish he stop and he begin to follow you are you following me are you following me so the thirst of Israel and the hunger of Israel both receive Supernatural respon es from God he receive a supernatural food and a supernatural water are you following me Lord help me brother Bram says this in why little Beth uh uh uh Bethlehem he said that's why he was born in Bethlehem of Judea he crowed him and brother the place he want to be crowded today is in your own being your own what heart that he may display from you the what Waters of life to a perishing people and the bread of life to a water starving people he is the bread and the water water of life which is the two what essential things to a man's living is bread and what water so the two essential things to a man living came from the supernatural in other words your very Foundation amen am is Supernatural am am father help me you're going to catch me later my friend you're going to catch me later in Israel when Israel was in the in the wilderness the Bible says this this is where Jesus Took the scripture the Bible say and thou shall remember all the way which the Lord that God led the this water 40 years where in the wilderness in the wilderness this is where what was created in the wilderness this is where Mana was created in the wilderness this is where Jesus multiplied by the bread in the wilderness this is where Jesus beat the devil in the wilderness this is the place that Jesus also had the power to create or to change uh Stone unto bread everything happened in the wilderness and God is telling Israel remember the Wilderness what happened in the wilderness he said thou shall remember all the way which the Lord that God LED thee this 40 years where in the wilderness to do what humble thee and to do what prove thee to know what is in the heart whether that would keep his commandment or no listen to this and he humbled thee amen and did what suffered thee to hunger who brought the hunger God if God brought the hunger who's going to satisfy the hunger in other word who brought the desire who's going to satisfy the desire who pushed David to the Tabernacle God who brought Jesus to the Wilderness God who took Jesus to the tree God hallelujah are we together Hallelujah are we moving together he says and he suffered the to do what hunger and fed thee with what Manner which thou what knewest not nether did your father no the food manner was already in the plan of God are you there and God had that plan for Israel in the wilderness do you follow me do you follow me but in order to draw that plan out you need hunger am amen God have to push you to a circumstance that will create hunger because there is something that you need to have am am let me go again slowly amen God could have taken Israel three time three three days and put them in the promis land brother Bram even said that but God had a plan God say this generation here I'm going to let them taste Mana but the only way I'm going to let them taste Mana they must desire it because I already plan I already predestinated Mana for them and that manner they father didn't know that that's right because the father was in Egypt and their mother didn't know that and they themselves did not know it what are you trying to say Pastor never limit yourself to the level your parent [Applause] reach I don't know if you're getting me because God have a plan for you that is different than your mother amen that is different than your father you must open up yourself to receive whatever God has for you I don't know if you're getting what I'm saying sometime most of the time we grow up in circumstances and those circumstances put us in bondage in other word those circumstances create complex you begin to desire certain life based on what you live with your parent if your parent were poor you want to also live in that poverty you find it that it's normal I don't know if you get me if your parent always wear in depth for you to live in depth is normal but God doesn't work like that no God has a program for your life that your parent have nothing to do with it that you yourself don't even have to imagine that you never thought the one who thought that is God I don't know if you're following me that's what he's telling Israel that when I gave you food I gave you food you didn't know I gave you food that your parent didn't know your parent have a a a a slave mentality slity the mentality is to work for the task [Applause] master they have to be under somebody who beat them all the day who yell at them but your Covenant is different your Covenant is different Jesus Christ [Applause] your level is higher your parent was stuck with what they know but I'm pulling another generation that can be free mind and not the generation that can believe me in the impossible am and not the generation that will accomplish things that nobody did before do you follow me that's why Jesus said the work that shall do you shall do it but you will do how [Applause] greater your heavenly father want you to accomplish more than him spoken word 2024 open your mind open your heart [Applause] break the limitation of your family if your mother divorce you not going to divorce if your father divorce you're not going to [Applause] divorce my voice Lord help me if everybody in your family always strive for poverty not you God will do something different that my mother doesn't know my father doesn't know my uncle does know because you under a different lineage amen you are a son of God [Applause] hallelujah sometime I speak with people and after a while I watch certain streak in their life but I won't tell you until the boss tell me to tell you and then I can see people that got into certain situation for a long time until they think it's spiritual until they think it's normal normal amen until they think that is what humility is all about but they don't know it's a strength from a family amen Adam died abble died SE died all of them died but not Enoch amen Enoch broke the circle [Applause] am if your family always have blood pressure not you amen this body is a different breed this body will see something that my father never saw I will be always happy always healthy no sugar diabetes no blood pressure no caner nothing in this [Applause] body so take your family limitation off God Incorporated you into the Heavenly family the name of your family is Jesus everybody together everybody together everybody together so God has plan that no no nobody know have it even yourself don't know it but in order to pull that plan in order to bring that plan in order to bring something new in your life that you never thought about God you have to hunger So Hunger has a secret yes sir hunger doesn't mean that God have abandoned you hunger doesn't mean that God is making you suffer hunger is an opportunity for God to now bring his plan into your [Applause] life oh God we start climbing up now time is start running amen the Bible say says this he humbled thee and did what suffered thee to do what hunger and fed thee with what Mana which what thou knowest not now you understand what it means nor what neither did thy fathers know that he man make ye what know that not your father God doesn't care about your father he want you to know he want you to know what he wants you to know that what man does not live by bread only but what by every word that that proceeded out of the mouth of God by doing that was trying to get Israel from a natural level into the level of the world because everything that existed was created by the word you remember that the lordos created everything there is nothing in this world that existed that was not created by the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God God and the Word was God are we together so everything that is created is created by the word so God when he fulfilled that to Israel he was trying to get Israel to the point that listen to me the natural life is not what really matter you see I took you to the Wilderness you don't have bread and I produce Mana I was not producing Mana just to show you how big I am I was producing Mana to give you something as a lesson that when you have the word am amen am even if there is no bread just like you were in the wilderness where there was no bread the word will create bread are you following me are you following me so that word combined with your thirst or your hunger yes sir yes sir the word the creative word the logos the Lord the anointing of the word usually is released by a desire are you following me if you don't cry that word is hiting that word usually work by thirst amen or by hunger yes sir if Israel didn't cry no manner if Israel didn't cry no water when Israel thirst the word bring water when Israel hunger the word begin to bring food when Israel hunger for flesh the word begin to bring Quil the word work with the hunger and The Thirst am am we are dealing with thirst and we are dealing with Hunger follow me carefully my friend amen the spoken word in Jesus Christ work with his hunger when Jesus hunger that's when the spoken word came when Jesus hunger that's when he begin to beat the devil every time am under any circumstances it is written it is written it is written that power came when he was hungry amen amen Jesus conquered the devil when he was hungry I just read to you the Bible father help me what is a hunger what is a thirst brother brother say to be an eagle of God you got to do what follow the word how day by day you got to do what continue and do what upon the word if you want to be an eagle am day by day you must follow the word because everything is in the word the word is the fullness of God if David didn't follow the word he would have missed the showbread the one who took Jesus to the Wilderness is the word amen am what is thirst please follow me carefully I don't know I thought brother Robert I don't know if I will reach 30% I have to lay the scription now we claming follow me carefully my friend okay what is thirst follow me carefully in the message thirst follow me carefully please brother Bram say then I was looking and doing what thinking about the word thirst so I look up in the dictionary to see what it means and here is what what Webster says that it is a what a painful desire so thirst is a desire I want you today to flip the word thirst and begin to call a desire because when we say thirst you always think about what oh Coca-Cola my friend amen but brother Bram say thirst is what painful desire it is a desire that is [Music] painful I don't know if you get it why painful follow me carefully why painful why painful let me give you an example please I'm just giving this with all humility this is the best I get I just got it now okay that's why I'm going to give it to you I'm not trying to show off anything okay please okay I beg you please okay please remember say please okay amen if you brush your teeth uhhuh and you see a little bit of blood and you spit out and you put salt and warm water are you going to go to the dentist no are you going to go see the dentist it's not but if you want

night you said brother stepen I can't sleep see before even I get awake I will see you on the parking lot because the desire is painful amen [Applause] [Music] hallelujah brother Kelly when it begin to get juicy time is running away are you together so brother BR I'm said thirst is a desire that is what painful God have to make it painful amen because human being have a tendency to [Music] relax in other word when God wants you to fulfill something he will squeeze you [Applause] amen until you wake up amen and you go do what he want you to do [Applause] Have I Lost somebody brother Bram say Webster says pain thirst is a what a painful desire it's a desire if it's just a desire you will I mean put it off ah it's just something I can't get it no problem oh I wish that was for me let me do something because it's not painful but when it's painful when it's painful is when you begin to roll on the bed and you fall down and you sit down and you eat the hamburger you don't taste it you say why a man like this I don't get married I went every other place it looks like no man see me yes sir yes sir the food is ready no I don't need it because the desire begin to get [Applause] painful it begin to disturb you you cannot sleep because of it you have to be in church because of it you have to pray at 3:00 a.m. because of it it is a good son Hallelujah it is a good [Applause] son listen to what God just told me to tell you Israel was living good in Egypt amen amen amen they have everything they want they have privilege because of Joseph no thought of the promised land but God be to make Israel painful when he made them painful Israel begin to cry and God himself came down what listen to what he's telling me to tell you the desire Israel begin to cry when it was time when the time to the fulfillment of the promise was approaching amen did you hear what he told me amen did you hear me what he tell me did you get what he told me he told me to tell you that remember Israel begin to be begin to cry when the time was getting closer to the end so thirst that painful desire is only a signal that the arm of something is approaching oh God Lord help me I can't go let me try my friend the Bible brother Bram say it is a what it's not it's a painful what desire a what a painful when you want something how so bad as long as you don't want it so bad it is not time [Applause] yet brother my sermon is the secret of thirst and hunger Hunger have a secret we are now peeling those secret one by one there is more to that amen when you wanted how so bad sister mam so bad when you want it so bad so bad until it become how painful to you it become painful to who to you to sister jerus to who to me so your desire is individual Hallelujah in other word never go as a collective people like okay brother Mickey GED now it's matter no no no no no no no no no no no God will paint you at your own time but the he has his own time it's painful to you in word when you telling people it's cold amen everybody's like it's not cold but you the one feeling it in other word it's your [Applause] own let's let's let's rush if I can get somewhere now it is not what an unnatural thing to do what thirst thirst is a what unnatural thing he just simply what something that God has given us that he could give a what a desire for something maybe you didn't get it can you read it again my friend somebody miss it brother Bram say it is not an unal thing to thirst thirst is a what a natural thing it is just simply something that God has given us that we could to give us a what desire for something in other word when God built you he built a software and God synchronize with that software when that software begin to click God also begin to remember what he put in you Lord father help me it is something to give us a what a control a desire for what something so thirst bring the desire of something and who did it God sometime God has also what has given you a control tower something that set inside what of you that control what these different desires so thirst is like a radar uhhuh follow me carefully please I know my time is up amen and this thirst this water control tower sits where in a man's heart stop put a seat belt my friend according to science your thirst and hunger is controlled by the brain go very far my friend I didn't want to start demonstrating here somebody will say now he start uh uh uh what teaching biology to his church intellectual I do that that's why I put it aside hunger and thirst in the nature is controlled by the hypothalamus go very fire it is a part that is in your brain but brother Bram is saying here that this thirst is not in your brain it is a thirst that is in the heart Hallelujah it is a thirst that come from your soul the taste off your brain look for bread the taste off your bread look for water the taste off your bread look bread look for Coca-Cola the taste of your your your the hunger of your brain look for [Applause] Fufu are you there but your heart is in a different level it thir for something else amen it thir for what is not really natural [Applause] [Music] amall are we together let me ask you a question does your belly need a house no I'm asking you a question does your biley ever tell you that I need a clothing no so every time the Bell is calling he calling for what food that's it any problem any problem every problem so whatever you need in this belly it's only natural but man is more than natural man is also spiritual so they got to be another control tower that control all the things that are not food man shall not live by what bread alone but by every word [Music] Hallelujah father help me he says he has given a control tower for some no uh and this thirst this control tower sit where inside of you no no in the man's heart is something that God give what to him to do what warn him warn him of what the desires that's needful for him the tast of your soul Lord help me the thirst of your soul according to brother Bram it's a warning it's a warning of things that are needful for you in other word when your soul begin to hunger it tells you you need that [Applause] thing father help me help me help me help me Lord he says and there is two different kind of what third there is a what a thirst physically and there is a thirst how Also spiritually everybody clear now give me a few minutes my friend I will get where to Lear this brother Bram say you can do without food for a what a long time but you can't go without what drinking 80% of your body is made of what water the first thing God ever move on the spirit of God ever move on was what the water in Genesis and you can't go without water water watch now and if your soul all is what hungering to worship listen Mr Pentecostal and Pilgrim of Holiness and Presbyterian Baptist whoever you are if you are what hungering and you are what thirsty satisfy your thirst with who Christ and make Christ your who your God are we together please give me some minute and I'm going to land this ship my friend brother bam says this the greatest cry that there is where in all the world I hope none of you ever heard it but if you ever did there is no cry to equal to the Cry of what hunger when you see a mother with her baby and she can't walk she's house so weak and the baby and the little baby is doing what dying with its belly swell out from what hunger he have consequences hearing them so coming from the mother's heart see that baby with its cheek drawn in until there's skin and bone and a little gum shining and can't make a noise hardly his little eyes are what bugged out there is no cry like the hunger and the what thirsty Lord help me Jesus The Cry of hunger listen is what a great cry because it's a what distressful cow the person is what dying oh if we could get to that place amen if this nation could get to a place where it's so what hungered for God do you see that it's in the worse starvation than the nation like what India that is starving how physically the belly this nation is starving where spiritually but after you hunger so long it get to the place you don't know you are what [Applause] hungry father help me this is is the problem in the message churches amen when a church stays so long without preaching the true message the believer of that church WIll hunger for the word hunger for the word hunger and they get into a place where they don't and the church dies and when you get in d a church it looks like a Baptist Church it looks like a Methodist Church because the people got hungry for so long and they didn't get the pure word let me continue my friend The Thirst also is a what an alarm it's what an alarm clock that is what that thirsty the soul sets off a what alarm clock like a what a little buzzer inside of you that tells you that what death has lurking now that if you don't get water pretty soon you're going to do what die it gets how louder and louder until he finally what you keep putting it all and you shall do what die because it's a what a long CL let me get this and I drop the Sheep my friend Jesus said blessed are they that do what hunger and thirst after righteousness blessed are they that do what hunger so to hunger is a blessing amen amen blessed are they which do what hunger and do what thirst for what righteousness what is righteousness listen to Paul 1 Corinthians 1:30 but of him are ye where in Christ Jesus in who who of God in in who Christ Jesus who of God is made unto has what wisdom and what righteousness so who's our righteousness Christ Jesus let's go back now blessed are they which do hunger and thirst for who righte who is righteousness Christ Jesus they shall be what filed so whenever you begin to seek [Applause] God whenever you begin to thirst for God it means it is the time of your feeling father help me up let me state it again the Bible say blessed is they that do what and do what thirst for what righteous and they shall be what fil so if you thirst for righteousness you shall be fair so once you begin to thirst amen and hunger for righteousness it is a signal that the time of your feeling have come when you begin to seek for deliverance to leave Egypt it's because the time is drawing n when we begin to get tired of this world and everything that is going on is because the time begin to get closer something is pulling you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] up give me five minute I stop if I can get this down brother Bram say than Lord in Luke 5 I'm going to leave you with this and it came to pass that as the people did what pressed upon him the people were pressing Jesus Christ yes to do what hear the word of God and Jesus did what he stood stop so Jesus stood because the people begin to press on him when brand bimus begin to cry out the cry your bir may stop Jesus Christ amen amen listen to this brother Bram say they said they did what pressed upon him to do what hear the word of God my that shows they was what hungry doesn't it you can't in people for what food until they get how hungry but when they get how hungry then they can really what talk about food so as long as it doesn't bother you they they cannot talk about it when it be when hunger comes you will begin to talk about all kind of restaurant and before you know it a solution will be found on the parking lot you will realize you will choose one restaurant so your conversation your conversation is a signal that something is lurking around when they the we on the road of EMAs when they were talking about him because somebody was lurking around I'm going to stop here my friend that's the way it is if you are not interested in who God you can't talk god to who people but whenever they are what get hungry and what thirsty after what God say they shall be what but the first but first there has to be a what a hunger and thirst you have to what really want it before you can be F you must really want it you must have thirst and you must have hunger once hunger comes you blessed once thirst come you blessed I am no longer talking about Hunger of food oh hunger oh oh Taste of water but a real taste when it begin to it means the time is [Applause] ahead time is up let me stop here you have have a big load go home and chew okay and I'm going to pick up again on the characteristic of thirst and hunger everybody okay everybody okay remember hunger can give you power to enter a field and to satisfy itself whichever hunger comes have a power of its own satisfaction hunger opened the disciple to get into a field on the Sabbath day hunger took David and even opened the door for David to get the showbread and to even get back to the sword of Goliath hunger took Jesus Into the Wilderness to beat the devil the greatest beating ever and Jesus beat him him with the lowest at the lowest state right and brother brandham said to show that any Christian whichever Lev you are your normal natural hunger can beat the devil any time anywhere under any circumstances hunger took Jesus to the tree and expressed the third pool hunger was given to Israel to bring God's plan that Israel did not know and their father did not know blessed are you when you hunger when you thirst it is a good thing brother brandom say just to thirst you are blessed because it's telling you you're going to get filed in other words your hunger has a guarantee your hunger is coupl with a guarantee whenever hunger comes you're going to get what you're hungering for whenever a thirst come you're going to get what you're thirsting for let's stop right here and we'll pick up let's stand the secret of hunger and thirsting I thought I'm going to finish this but I'm going to show you by the grace of God where he goes and you begin to discern your life differently amen the bosses keep dropping thing do you know when David went to the battle yes he was not even going to the battle he was going to get food that's right true amen that's right his father gave him food to take food to his brother he didn't intend to fight but when his brother saw him amen David when he got to the battlefield he begin to hear Goliath amen Goliath was speaking for 40 days everybody shut up but when David heard Goliath speaking amen he turned around and begin to ask a question he said what are we going to do to the man who's going to kill kill them man that's right right do you follow me what I'm trying to show you is something yes his own Brother Blood Brother this is what I'm trying to show you came and told him that we know your audacity you always try to show off you trying to always show that nobody knows anything it's only you who have the entire Revelation they were doing that to quench him quench him but the hunger of David was calling for something different what I'm telling you is be careful what you're hearing be careful what somebody else is telling you because our covenant are different am don't let anybody discourage you for something that you feel in your heart like it's poting I don't know if you get what I'm saying because the one that will try to push you down is your own brother it's your own message believer that's true that's true because they don't understand why you always come up with plan amen everybody will be quiet you the only one that will come up like no uh this window is bad everybody's quiet with the you always the one coming up with it it's not you you were built like that and if you let yourself in itting you're not going to break that Goliath but when Goliath head was chopped down even his own brother forgot what they told him they also jump in the battle and they begin to enjoy the killing so don't stop because your battle Cann now up brother Bram say David when he chopped golad he held his hand as a testimony to tell Israel that you see what you can do yes amen there are many complexes in the families and those complexes will try to shut you down yes but God might be might have chosen you to break that thing if you back up you blocking the family but if you broke that he will give courage to your other family member to say that wait a minute if he did it we can also jump on that's what I'm trying to say am thank you Lord amen thank you Lord what will stop you is the coming of the Lord if you meet him in the air fine but if the Lord have not come yet amen don't let anybody tells you you cannot do this based on what who say that who are you am do you did God give you the program of my life for you to tell me what I need to accomplish and not to accomplish man your own business if my plan seems to be too high for you ah don't call me proud I stay with your humble plan but I have a different commission amen because our thirst and hunger are different God say when you get in the field you eat at your own pleasure if you already at your own pleasure and you fool please give me my space let me finish man I'm a 18 wheer I need a big diesel go with your 87 you're going to burn on the highway amen heavenly father thank you Lord Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning this afternoon father we thank you for your grace for your love and for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father now we begin to understand why Satan always fight our thirst yes our desire to pervert it and to take it to a different rra than what you intended because your Prophet told us that you put those desire to thirst after thee and at the end of the day people find themselves in wreck because they were they has been deceived by Satan following the wrong path but Lord today you have unfolded to us what the purpose of a desire is what he can do in our life and why do we feel strange why do we feel the way we feel why is there anything something in our soul that always call for something higher when everybody around us don't see it when everybody around me doesn't seems to be even interested in it am when
