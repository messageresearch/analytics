TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you you basil really like there but can you get in the spirit of the composer [Music] so the symphony you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you this reading and thank you sister and the Lord just seem to put a little something on my heart to bring to the church and I thought it's time to do it and now this when I arrived and then not knowing we'd be here this Sunday I've announced that I have a message for the church and I won't - if God willing bring this message next Sunday and there will be a quite a lengthy time so it probably will not get out before 12:30 1:00 o'clock maybe if at that time it's been on my heart for a long time and I think I owe the public an answer why that I haven't been active out in the field and I've preached all around it but I'm sure it hasn't ever just come right out to where it should be so I think the Lord willing next Sunday I just want to take my time and just lay out a reason and why and let you know scripturally what's going on and just why it's all about because I'll probably be going overseas or somewhere right away I'm waiting now to see which way he will call me to go last about three nights ago or two nights I had a phone call near midnight and it was to pray for some woman that was in the hospital and they call me and said pray and I forget the name that they gave me that said it was a friend to mrs. James Bell our sister here at the church a colored sister a very loyal fine woman Hobley the name a shepherd was giving so I got out of the bed and knelt down and and told my wife for the phone ringing woke her up and I said we must pray for mrs. Shepherd a sister that's called it's a friend to mrs. Jane Bell so we prayed for her got back in the bed and then long about 10 or 11 o'clock the next day I got a call again his Billy and he said it wasn't miss Shepard so it was Miss Bell herself not miss bells friend it was mrs. Bell and she's in the hospital very seriously and rushing at the hospital but she was gone the Lord had called mrs. Bell home mrs. Bell has been a faithful gather with us here at the church for years her husband James and I worked together with my father many years ago out running we run these Spurs in from the Pennsylvania into the Colgate sir many years ago I guess 30 years ago or more and we love sister Bell she was a grand person and I understand she had a cute attacked of gallbladder condition and they her physician that knew the case real well was out of town at the time and a new physician came to look at her and it advised emergency operation and she never survived and and she was I think her way I understand it that her regular physician wouldn't have prescribed the operation because she was heavyset and her gall bladder was bad and she'd have stones I think or something in it and and the Lord had been merciful she'd had those attacks before and the Lord and taking care of those many times but just happened to be that well if we bring it to a full measure we'd say this God had called her sister Vail and that's what it had to be taken he's yeah and how that he Miss Brown around to me that I thought it was mrs. a miss Shepherd I don't know miss Shepherd the lady maybe you're the morning and I'm a nor for look at her face but it was said it was a Mrs Shepard and whether it's all done like that so that fitted by Noah been mrs. Bell have been in that shape I'd probably went out there and been interceding far right away and then see that God didn't want us to do that perhaps so we know that all these things work together for good to them that love God and I'm sure that sister Bell loved our Lord and she was a good woman now she's one of us in here we don't have any lines of color the family of God doesn't draw lines of color whether we're red brown black or yellow it doesn't matter white whatever it is we are brothers and sisters in Christ and so we we love her and we'll miss her the tabernacle how will I miss sister bells I'm great big course a man back there in a corner and take her up home should talk about the Lord Jesus and if I understand it right never knew it you'll just a few moments ago but I think her funeral is being held right here in the church this coming Tuesday after one o'clock and I think you and I are two fish ate in this funeral service but just in a congregation that were one weaker this morning in a respect of our sister Bell that sustained to her feet testimony as we bow our heads God of life who gives and takes life a job of old said the Lord [Music] you found me when I was oh oh [Music] you found me when I was so blue you found me when oh [Music] when [Music] so let me walk with you Jesus oh [Music] don't ever ever me [Music] without you I know [Music] no never

fulfill your promise or to make yourself known to us this moment though we ask that you make our sacrifice of worship acceptable Lord that you just be pleased with it this morning and especially Lord

report and a prayer request on brother Jewell it's nothing short of a miracle we've all agreed that we does that have spoke that for a man that has given such a such a dedicated life to serving God around the world that it's no surprise that God would honor the prayers of the saints in his behalf because of all that he's done so let's hold him up for complete recovery amen and also we received a

is he Oh things are possible Jesus easy Jesus is here Jesus easy all things are possible Jesus easy amen god bless you this morning it's good to have people here and people online the visible and invisible audience so this day that code has been fulfilled praise God we thank brother Mutombo for extending his church opening his church so we can stream here so we really appreciate both brother Mutombo and brother Paul's toward but opposed toward give us his fellowship all brother Mutombo opened his church so we have two ways we can stream double stream whichever way we prefer and by God's grace I didn't know about this there were two sisters that express their concern and they wanted to be baptized both of them are 17 years old they are twins and they have given their heart to the Lord and by the grace of God I spoke to brother Mutombo and he has a pool back there and he filled the pool with water so at the end of the service when with probably you Dada on the online you might probably not have that opportunity but the folks that I hear will go back there and baptize those two sister one soul worth a thousand word two souls 20 if it's ten thousand word it's twenty if it's a thousand it's two thousand so you make the Martha or you do the math if you would let's go straight to the word I was doing those drawing yesterday brother David was a witness it doesn't look pretty but this is pretty loaded so by God's grace I will really encourage you to stay put so pay attention do not move if you need your water or coffee get it at home close to you because we don't want to leave anybody behind Genesis chapter 15 beginning by verse 3 I'm gonna read one or three words and you might be seated because I need to build from there I don't want you to be standing at home or wherever you are Genesis 15 verse 3 if you dare you can say Amen and Abram say behold to me you have given no seed you might be seated for his God and lo one born in my house is my hair talking about Eliezer of Damascus and behold the word of the Lord came to him saying this shall not be your heir in other word it's not the one you thinking that's going to take your place but he does shall come forth out of your own bowels shall be your hair now what is important is verse five now and he brought him forth abroad al-saad and say look now toward her so [Music] because we prove to you that the solar system brother branham call it disorient you to the heaven they have an Abraham whose lieutenant is what we refer as a sky or the firmament or the heaven so Abraham was looking right here everybody here okay praise God we put my Bible here he said look toward heaven and tell the Stars now if you take an airplane like we spoke before and you went into the cloud here you not gonna see any stars they star are outside the earth your son is not who I hear your son is outside the earth the planets are not within the earth salut the planet are outside the earth so God spoke to Abraham he said look through the firmament and we know that the firmament is like a glass it's like a mirror it's like a stream and God said look the stream but what I want you to pay attention to is not the cloud I want you to pay attention to the star in other words the screen right here or the sky or the firmament reflect the zodiac everybody praise God I know you're saying Amen online so tell the star if you be able to number them and he said to him so shall be your seed singular not plural your seed B and we know when we spoke about the seed of Abraham we used to take that seed as a natural seed then in the book in the New Testament when Paul came out Paul say ah if you notice when God was speaking to Abraham when God say your seed God spoke about that seed not plural it's in the book of Galatians he said not plural but singular which was speaking about Christ are you there so God is telling Abraham look true because and whatever you see there is trust so the zodiac reflect Christ oh my god I don't want you to say brother Steve insane the third one Abraham covenant the third one wrote on paper because this is the great educational age that we are living in and neither will none of them contradict one another we spoke about the first bubble be the zodiac the second bubble in the pyramid and the third bubble is the written word brother branham is saying none of those bubble contradicts one another in other word whatever is in it you can follow through the lineup together and brother Branham continued he say you see the great solar system speak of Christ everything that you see of crust if you just look at it look at the church today in its condition weak bucks leading gone back into the world that speak of Christ exactly what he's so the plan I'm pulling right here is whatever God told Abraham to look at was the solar system but that solar system spoke about Christ brother branham spoke if you recall when we went through the mystery of the three heaven brother Branham said the solar system is the clan of Jesus Christ and run run on explains that the clan is a kingdom so this solar system reflect cross it is Christ's Kingdom everybody there now let's go to the second scripture still in the book of Genesis Genesis chapter 37 if you dare you can say Amen you now going nowhere so give me time and let me unload myself so don't put me under pressure brother Robert should be smiling somewhere where he is it Genesis chapter 37 verse 9 if you dare you can say Amen and he dreamed talking about Joseph they dream of Joseph and he dreamed yet another dream are you there if you dare you can still you can begin to see something riding ok praise God and told it to his brethren and say behold I have dreamed a dream more I have dreamed a dream more and behold the Sun and we call again the Sun is not here the Sun is in the zodiac so Joseph is drawing our attention to the first bubble God drew Abraham attention to the first bubble are you there praise God he said look behold the Sun and the moon your moon is not in the firmament here your moon is outside the earth and the moon and the Eleven stars right the star of sad world zodiac the Sun zodiac the moon zodiac but now he's not like Abraham with Abraham he said look at them all that is Christ but with Joseph he turn around he said look there is only 11 star so we got right here 11 stars right there the Sun the Moon and Eleven stars if you notice at this stage of Joseph's life Benjamin was not born search your scripture if you have any question after church give me a call are you there so in this stage of life Benjamin was not born and Joseph is saying I saw the Sun a solar moon I saw 11 star they were are bowing to me so we have Sun Moon 11 star plus Joseph 12 but even though it's 12 Benjamin is not born in other word Benjamin already existed in the zodiac before he was even born into the earth if you give me time I'm going to show you yourself in the zodiac are you there Joseph was already speaking about Benjamin before even Benjamin was born praise God and the Eleven stars made obedience to me and he told it to his father and to his Brennan and his father rebuked him and say to him what is this dream that you have dreamed now Jacob as a prophet is going to give the interpretation but he's going to miss Benjamin Joseph came and I was telling to him like daddy you still have a boy that is going to be born in the future but daddy got angry interpret only the superficial part of the vision and left the other one are you there because when Benjamin was born Joseph was in Egypt let's see the interpretation praise God shall I Oh so Jacob is putting himself in the vision so Jacob is saying that the son that you sold is me are we clear so Jacob call himself a son praise God and your mother Oh so Joseph is saying Jacob is saying that the moon represented your mother but we know that Jacob had four women are you there the first one was Leah Leah gave him six son and she had two daughters if you have a question with two daughters see me after church I will show it to you I know your bind he's saying Dinah one one one there is two okay you have any questions see me I'll show you that in a bubble and then the second woman will see oppa which was a concubine to sons then the third one was Billa a concubine to sons then the last one was Rachel and from Rachel first came Joseph one then later on Benjamin came - if you take 6 plus 2 8 plus 2 10 plus 1 xi plus Joseph they are bowing so Benjamin was already here by he was not even born yet either but when Jacob is referring the moon he picked Rachel he didn't quit Leah he didn't pick Zappa he didn't pick Bella he picked Fletcher so natura here is represented as the mother of the 12 tribes as the mother of Israel let me help you up before we get there if you recall when Jeremiah was prophesying about the death of children at the coming of Jesus Christ he said that there is lamentation in Ramah who was crying brother Robert where you are it is Rachel that was crying for his children he was not Leah he was not Shilpa because the zodiac recognized Rachel so when those prophets are lining up they are lining up with Livadia because whatever information is in the zodiac he must be reflected all the way down to the written word everybody there oh my God where am I so I am your mother and your brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to you to the earth last Scripture let's go to the book of Revelation so just by the reading of the scripture you've already got a message if you dare you can say Amen revelation 12 beginning by verse 1 okay all right and they appear a great wonder in what another heaven that's why we have to teach the mystery of the three heaven and that heaven again we see whether it's right here or over there Abraham here Joseph here what about this one praise God and they appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the Sun so it is not this heaven ah here we back again in the zodiac who is the son is it Jacob again at the opening of the 17th all the mysteries of God must be revealed with God a woman clothed with the Sun and the moon under his feet we found out that there is another Sunday and there is another moon there who is that moon I'm not going to tell you brother Branham you tell us you need a prophet and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of water Joseph's vision Sun Moon eleven star plus him twelve and this book of Revelation we see another Sun Moon with a woman and then twelve stars who are those twelve star in Joseph's vision we know it's the twelve patriarch clear what about in Revelation we're going to ask Malik - are we the twelve star and she being with a child with child cried travailing birth and pained to be delivered and they appear another wonder in heaven and behold a great red so in this area here a dragon appeared I didn't want to get into it but there is a constellation that is called Draco it's the constellation of a dragon if you check whatever you want to check you and that there is a zodiac sign called the dragon and the revelation the book of Revelation also spoke about the dragon in the heaven they are three lineup together are we there and they appear not a wonder in heaven and behold a great dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven clan upon his head that's a message by itself and he still they tell Jude the third part of the stars of heaven stars of heaven who are those stars indeed cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to deliver for to devour her child as soon as he was born and she brought forth a man child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up clawed up it's the word for Russia caught up to God and to his throne if you notice the event happened in the zodiac but there was a rupture to God so God is in another dimension are we there so let's pray and we go Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have done for us father we are committing this service unto the hand may you be the Alpha and the Omega of this service father may you move me completely away because I'm surrendering myself unto thee expressing in front of your children that I do not know anything Lord father made the holy spirit made the inside teacher may you come down and teach your word to your children Lord bless them Lord Father wherever they are Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen all right now our subject is part 4 of the unchanging pattern of God we spoke that God does not changed and we also expressed that God has three bubble the first bubble was in the zodiac the second bubble was in the pyramid and the third bubble was also in the written word if you don't mind I can us distinguish ear but brother branham also mentioned about another bubble but I wanna say that when he was a sinner he says that nature was his bubble but brother branham told us that there is three bubble and what what I'm saying that God is perfected in three so if you add another bubble how are we going to put that together was brother Graham I'm making a mistake or what I told you whenever you hit the bone eat the flesh leave the bone alone because if you mess around with it you can either take your way of getting trouble so brother branham say that the zodiac itself was a bubble and when you look at the zodiac the earth as a planet is also part of the zodiac so when you are reading the zodiac a star is a scripture a planet is a book are you there are you there because it's God babu-brother God I'm saying when he was placing those sir when he was pressing those planet God was riding his bubble so when you're looking at the star you are looking at scriptures when you looking at the planet Pluto March Jupiter you are looking at books of the heavenly Babel are you there so if you look around the planet there is a planet called Earth and brother branham say within the planet Earth are you there there is a whole bubble that is written there so the earth bubble is a bubble with in a bubble I'm going slowly I don't know if I will finish this message are you there so when you look at Pluto it's written about something when you look at Jupiter it's talking about something when you look at large it's talking about something when you look at earth it's talking about something but when you enter earth there is also a bubble written in Earth so still three bubble but in one of the book of zodiac there is a whole bubble retaining that book on earth hallelujah brother branham say here in the message Lord show us the father and it sufficeth us did you ever notice my first Bible was nature if you here say man so they came here because if somebody don't see there I want them to see not brother Steven saying the Bible says brother branham say my first Bible was in nature and God does dwell in his universe are you there the solar system in his nature praise God let's go on again the choosing of the blood as we see that all of the natural things is the top of the spiritual things I believe I'd miss something okay that's a writing why some people can keep the victory in studying in study of nature as I have been preaching because he was my first Bible to lead me to classroom by the Brannen first father was nature this is even written in the book of Romans if you going Roman chapter 1 you will see the Bible say that God express himself through the visible things if you need a scripture see me I will send it to you we never had the Bible in our home and I was 20 years old we never seen a Bible as far as I know in a home so by the branham Baba was nature praise God now we can go to the choosing of the blood see that all of the natural things is the top of the spiritual things as we went through in our lesson this morning as the Sun and his nature that was my first Bible before I ever read the page in the Bible knew God because the Bible is written everywhere in nature that's brother Branham and it just correspond with the Word of God are you there so in the Soviet bubble there is Co the earth and in the book there is another bub and brother branham say when you look at the three Bible you learning up together they don't contradict one another when you go to the written word the Bible in the written word has 66 books are you there but there is a book in the Bible called the Book of Isaiah and the Book of Isaiah has 66 chapters it is a book within the Bible but this book wrote the whole battle where do you get this stuff I'm say Isaiah what Finke of crust if you don't see the co2 good you need it let me know as there was a major profit he wrote a barber in itself brother Branham was not contradicting himself either you leave it alone or you wait till the unknown income there is sixty-six books in Isaiah 66 chapter in Isaiah 66 books in the Bible right he start off with the question large Genesis right in the middle of the book where the New Testament came John the Baptist comes up and then in the end he ends it within the Millennium build houses inhabit them plant vineyard and eat thereof he wrote a whole Bible he was one of the prophet that God got by the top of the neck raised him up and let him see from end to beginning then they're beginning to the end back and forth and as they rotted so just like the zodiac a bubble but another bubble within the bubble the written word also have 66 book Leviticus Genesis our zaiah whatever you call it but within there there is another book that also have a Bible in itself are we clear so as we studying our subject now which is the unchanging part of God we were trying to put a basis a foundation to show that we are not following any cunningly devised message this message is not fabricated by men this message was confirmed in the zodiac the teaching of the message are in the zodiac the Ministry of brother Branham is in this order the birth of brother Branham who came from the zodiac and even brother branham himself either not only is his ministry is in the zodiac even in nature in the within the earth the name of brother Branham was written in nature swallow that pretty good but we're gonna get there are you there so this message is confirming the zodiac confirming the pyramid and confirm in the written word so last time we spoke about the message in the pyramid we showed you how we started by the virgin then you come up as a lion now we want to go back to the zodiac finish the zodiac today then we will drop down into the written world now there is 12 major son of the zodiac we spoke about it we want but by the grace of God today we're gonna go through one of them each one and clear the whole thing are you there now when we spoke in part 1 and part 2 just to catch whoever is left behind we spoke about areas which is one of the 12 sharp 12 sign we found out that areas spoke about how Jesus Christ will be born and aliens told us that Jesus will come as friend and brother branham say if you notice he was born in April when he was in Apple he said that's the mass where areas is covering and if you notice at the birth of Christ starts line up and Jesus was born and in this end time again three stars line up and brother Branham was born and he was born also in April so that areas not only spoke about crust he also spoke about this anthem messenger I'm going slowly are you there when we look at Taurus Taurus was the sacrifice of Jesus Christ we show you completely that cars have to be killed because in the Old Testament they pick up the blood take it to the mercy seat and sprinkled emergency seven times which was speaking about the seven churches then we showed you please which was speaking about seven dove seven stars and seven sisters which were the seven churches with the messenger and the seven spirits of seven manifestation of the Holy Spirit that were through the messenger that's why brother Branham was waiting on that seventh dove take the message in the seventh in the wings office not dog then we spoke about Orion which were speaking about Nimrod the spirit of Babylon then we touch up on the two bears which was the bigger bear and a little bit it's called in the United States then little deeper and a big deep deeper when you connect those stars all of them have seven stars when you connect them they appear like a deeper that's why the United States called them a bit deeper and a little deeper but when we look at those two we found out that in the deeper there were two stars we spoke about them when you trace a line and you line up those two stars automatically those star points you to the North Star and they were using these two star as navigational guidance if you miss the lobster and you cannot find enough star go ahead and sand those two star those two star will point you directly to the north star and we showed you that we have seven messenger but in between those messenger in between them when you start at the beginning with Paul at the end and they only truth our prophet and when Paul came Paul say follow me as a father random said they're not presented oh my god William Mariota Branham their solar system has not changed they thawed yuck the morning star rises on it poster duty every morning just exactly the way when the earth was created the evening star taking place every star deliver deeper because the Little Dipper is the only constellation that contained the lost art he had seven stars at one of those star is the lobster are you there and right at the time of season is just exactly where it's supposed to be the North Star stand steady and never moves hallelujah the whole thing the whole zodiac Northstar you got through March Northstar every star connected to the North Star the whole fish it is right in the center of the earth so if you wanna know your center of the earth you need to Center it with the lobster praise God that is Christ that's why brother Branham say if you look at the zodiac brother branham said the zodiac speaks of Christ and run run and say the center of the zodiac is the North Star which everything in the zodiac revolve around it so if you look in the zodiac and you don't see a connection with the North Star you have not read the zodiac pretty well because the zodiac because the knob starts one speaks about crust that's why I brought upon him saying if you read your Bible and you don't see Christ you ran around go back again and read because the entire Bible revolve around crashed Alleluia da he stand there command his army like a great captain let me know about the time buddy John for instance here is an old trick to a garden you know if you can see the Stars anyone can tell which way you are going if you shall watch the star and you always want to watch the one true star there is only one true star and that is the lobster see only one he stand in the same place that represent trust the same yesterday today and forever are you there so when we look on the Little Dipper we found out that crust is one of the seven angels everybody here and we found that this time the cloud came and when we look in the cloud brother branham said the coming of the cloud was the fulfillment of Revelation 10 and when when I'm saying in Revelation 10 the Lavi angel that came down was Christ and when brother Branham entered the constellation when we look around brother Branham saw that there was one angel which was different than all the six and one random said there was the seventh year and that was Christ so your zodiac spoke about the cloud before the cloud happened in Arizona so the cloud is not a mistake it's not a rocket it's not something that happened by any chance and matter of fact when they took the picture they turn it to the right he was the picture of who the picture of who crashed a thousand rocket and pull me the picture you are spoken in the zodiac before it happened because what a Branham said before God does anything on the earth put it out today he was already waiting in that bubble under the little different there was a constellation of seven stars one of them was Christ are you there so one evil came and enoch built the pyramid are you there let's see how he put up the pyramid praise God in the message paradise they had the secret they know how to do it they had a greater and greater instrument that pyramid said so perfectly in the center of the brother branham just told us that the center of the zodiac which is the Sultan so when we knock brother pyramid his eyes was well at least enough star as long as the pyramids lined up with the knob star no matter how the sun is shining around it no shadow are you there if you don't want a shadow in your life line up with Christ if you don't want any trouble in your life line up with Christ when you land up with Christ with all the shadow will run away from you because he's the father of light in him there is no turning nor shadow are you there praise God let's see them heal an up with the start why is this star important if you are a woman young sister wherever you are if you are a young woman dedicate your morals young sister take your passion take that first that you want a companion take your virtue or clearly of rigidity taking a body dedicate that to somebody who's that person crust let's keep reading you say he is talking to the sisters because we have a tendency to point hand or fingers to Sister Sister Sister Sister Sister

yourself I hope you want to love me if you are a young man dedicate your morals young woman you are a young man so not only sisters have to dedicate their body to the Lord but brothers also you don't have the right to go party and come back and impose people who you want to marry daddy catch your morass what do we mean by morass brother Stephen you teaching the zodiac what do you have to do with this it's the misery thirsting for life I will come about go back to that code woman was made woman for a man not woman made men God does not make mistake that's a provision woman was made woman for a man man was not made for women woman was made for man not man look at what rebel a machine not men many of them in other word not pure but cellular sister you are made for one man clear that's right but when they shall Demarest when they scandalized themselves who is talking to the sister and man the same thing you two brothers you are providing the vehicles that God made you a woman or a man

the church living any kind away whether you are sister or a brother it's perverting the very thing that God intended you to be the first that putting you to be like him and to love him and test after him let me give more clarification then we go back to this audio yo Mars will be one sister and brother if you can see that code call me I will send it to you brother since the end brother you shall never live it down as long as you live on this earth no matter how much you forgive here not long ago a beautiful young woman at the altar she was weeping and weeping and could not get her to accept us and I went back a leader in a room and asked her I see what's the matter sees sin she was to be murdered in other words she was already pregnant by the bernam is trying to find out what is wrong with me sister she say and she told me she said brother branham I was raised in a Christian home my parents believed the message I was raised in the message home my father and mother are Nazarene and we have been raised a strict life holiness and she said I went out with a boy at one time not to time just one time the devil just need one shot everybody doing it they don't get pregnant you try one time you get it please God at one time and had the flask in his pocket he was very popular he could dance I didn't want to do such as that I was always different in other words you are compromising

they gave her coca-cola Oh us sister we understand you take coca-cola we wanna drink the whiskey dad I got a drink of clock one night and he was spiked with some kind of knuckle tear they put it in

dedicate your morale you young man dedicate your morale dedicate your mind dedicate your thinking dedicate your heart dedicate your soul dedicate all you are and let trust work through that what are you talking about what a glorious thing why do we have to dedicate that brother brother he said God deliver to cross you get bridges to govern you get the young you are you get the briar patches

trouble ahead coming up they are stuck in life that's gonna put you in a corner so before you get there before you cross there dedicate yourself Alleluia what are you doing someday you shall have to stand and look back see where you come from and you are going to be judged by the course you take either put all your mind and your thought on what the most are we back again in the zodiac are you there brother Branham says the centre of God the centre of God is the North Star the centre of the earth is the North Star the centre of the Soviet is the lobster enough studies Christ and don't move from it stay right with it it shall bring you straight like you did imagine the major are you there why do we need to stay with the North Star brother branham say in first ten had only had a spiritual application as he had the physical application as he studied there's laws of what the laws of the Bible say God is right when our son was studying like he begin to study automatically God and so forth he could have got something when I heard his message on that great Center are you following me great center somewhere in the sky in heaven so Ashton look and so a great Center in the sky and brother branham say the center is the lobster but the regulation is the monster represent Christ ever contacted with that Center if you ever make contact with that center what's going to happen to you you want to know they turn blue get contact with that center brother branham say ever contacted with that center you can create earth the power of the spoken word lies in clasp louia do anything and the power will be limited so young men collect yourself to Christ young sister connect yourself to cross brother daddy lonely connect yourself to Christ and that class will give you that unlimited power you are talking about the third pool everybody clear so now as you be glow by the 12 Sun we all care what it you're on a time okay when we look at the 12 Sun I want to buckle up pretty good here that was maybe an appetizer this is deep so make sure you got yourself pretty good if you need the move move around if we were in school I give you ten minute break so shake around and we go when you look at the twelve star sign of the zodiac we spoke about the virgin we already explained that the Virgin spoke about the first coming of Christ Christ have to be born by a woman by a virgin then we also spoke about Leo de Lyon we was the second coming of Christ but keep in mind when you look at a star you are looking at the scripture when you're looking at the Sun of a constellation you are looking at it scripture are you there because the Bible was written like that are you there so when you look at the virgin it's a scripture when you look at the lion it's a scripture everybody clear so after that we just explained to you Aries which was speaking about the birth of Christ are you there because when Christ came down Christ have a reason to come he came to Christ the word of the devil are you there that's why when Moses met the serpent when Moses took his Lord God said pride on the earth I told you I would explain it to you when he had rolled on the floor God said not yet - bye they tell not the head the head is not you Moses in English at all he said throw he throw it turned to a serpent Moses by Capilouto be God's a showdown Moses you are not Christ you are not the seed of the woman you are only a shadow a type of Christ so what I want you to do go by the tail not the head why the tail and not the head are you there in the book of Genesis when Adam sinned Eve sinned God come and draw his judgment when they were living after God clothed them with lamps as they were living the Garden of Eden God look and he began to it he looked he looked and he looked at even he said there is a seed coming up and your seed would you want to discern it will crush the head of the serpent not the tail are you there so when Moses came he told Moses ah don't go to the tail don't go to the head that is reserved for somebody it's like when then your camera he said what does those standards means God said Daniel I know you want to know this but this is not for your tongue my sweet boy sleep there is a time in the end time when somebody was appropriate predestinated for the ministry when he will come automatically the thunders will be revealed are you there because the law there were two trees in the Garden of Eden there was the tree of good as Pro when look at those tree a tree I'm not a good job especially now we have a tree going on the earth is there underneath we have roots are you there then when that tree put fruits you have maybe an apple there an apple there or there is fruit and if you go to the book of Galatians you will see that there are the fruit of the Spirit are there and they are also the fruit of the work of darkness are they stealing murdering whatever you see them they are also fruit because there is two trees one tree produces fruit and another tree produces fruit and Jesus say you will recognize a tree by its fruit so what Moses came closest brought the law are you following me and their law was dealing not with the problem I'm going slowly but the law was dealing with the attribute of the problem let me repeat myself slowly I don't want to miss it when Lock em there law was not dealing with the loot because the life of the tree brother Branham said he stays in the root but when they lock him the law was dealing with their branches multiscale him say don't commit adultery brother branham say adultery is not sin are you there Moses say don't steal cut here when you cut across a branch guess what it's going to come up again that's why they're worshipper when they were going to the temple they come up bring a lamb put it there Oh Lord forgive me as soon as they leave they are living with the same desire to do that son finger D and one day they come to Moses I don't like my wife anymore Moses say brother what is going on he said ah I can't stand that woman anymore Moses look he said can't you just bring the de sister we can talk no no no no no no no I can't stand that woman anymore Moses looked he looked he said my ministry is different I'm dealing with the attribute I'm dealing with the branches there is no way you can control a man by dealing with the attribute I can tell him to smoke but there is something in him pushing him when he comes he can even still to go by cigarette most salukis day I'm going to find something in a jurisdiction law to kind of help this man he said if you don't like your wife anymore just right here a letter of divorce bring it to me send her away I'm not tomorrow you want to bring another one for marriage I want to get married to the second look he was not dilated you were already looking at another lady you are already committing adultery in your mind that's why you are looking for a sin that one the Pharisee said wait a minute Moses called us to give the letter of divorce Jesus say I know I don't have any problem I am the one who sent Moses but the problem the reason is give it to you because your heart where hard because of the hardness of your heart so no matter what Moses can preach unto you you will not listen because if sin is that dealt with it in there so God told Moses don't touch that serpent by the head that's the serpent by the hair by the tail your ministry does not crush the head of the serpent you'll deal with the attribute the tail of the serpent not the head where do you get those stuff brother Steven where do you get those stuff praise God brother Adam say for instance like this if a big word if a big serpent was here or a great big something that had me by the side with his paw what a Bonham is saying if I'm fighting with a big beast or something brother branham say and was hurting me with his pal maybe it's a bear or something he said now it's not necessary for me to have to cut the animal part off but rather we say if you fighting with a bear and you cut his now it's not helping if you cut his hand you in other word you making the animal more angrier than you think you are not solving a problem because the threat is still there are you there if you cut the tree Moses it's not helping if you tell them don't smoke it's not helping if you give them a bunch of commandment it is not helping you just make their life miserable they are thinking like they are in prison they are thinking like believing this message they are a certain bond of rule about the message don't just like this conscience like this they presented to you the message in the wrong way they presented to you the message like legolas take the heart change the heart then the bed then the burden of crust is light then oh I need to dress right oh thank you sister what did you say my my dress was a little bit tighter thank you sister next time I will change it it's not a problem if ITIF you not born again when the Sailor dress is that I don't want to come in that church they think that the only holy one under Moses are you there oh my god but if something hits him in the head I'm leaving mother panel and kill his head that killed him all over are you there and when Jesus atone for sin I'm reading brother branham he kills him it's attribute that's one when he died because he said it is finished that Chicago that the law was not able to deal with it it is finished hallelujah he killed the serpent from it I hope you had people here if you can see the code he killed the serpent from its head do you believe that that's true then if he atone for steam he atoned for sickness because sickness is secondarily coronaviruses nothing I'm gonna get to karana an attribute of sin our worry our trouble our field all those things are ultra beautiful sin oh my god the fundamental foundation of faith you cannot deal with sin on any major without dealing with sickness for sickness is an attribute of sin you can touch sickness or see more without dealing with sickness and all of its atrophy for sin is the man in other word the big start is sin kills him take care of the other one are you there it's the head of the serpent that's why he told Moses not the head that's not your ministry your ministries the law God touch that serpent by the tail I'll kill the head you have actually killed the body and you can kill it at the head without killing the body so if he just come to heal us and not save us we could have something to say about salvation but he come to deal with salvation for their soul which is the head from the heart that's why Moses say give them later of divorce cross say I know why he gave it to you because Moses was not dealing with sin from the soul a better come I am the Lamb of God I am the perfect land I'm coming to deal with him at the very root that's why when John the Baptist came to introduce Jesus Christ John the Baptist say the answer is Linda in the root in other words the ministry that is coming up he won't cut the branches anymore it's gonna cut the root it's going to deal with sin in it's very problem oh my god praise the Lord we saw the dragon with its tail drew the third part of the heaven of the star of the heaven you know what that was now his tell was not like a forked L like they say they dare for his gun he was that tell da ly not happen in the Garden of Eden are you then let me see if I can skip something brother branham say I said that's nothing unbelief is see that is the attribute of sin you don't do that because you don't believe we talk about they tell being the line right what about them say because you don't believe on Jesus Christ that makes you then you can lie you can still all of that that's why they told Moses don't touch it touch the other one so we enter by the Virgin you understand Leo DeLong you understand the ministry of the realm and we explain to you that the Ministry of the option was to provide that sacrifice so they can spring up the seven churches with the emergency are you there then later on with under Sun on the top so one two three four dealt with we still have eight I don't know if I will get to we're going are you there so there is the Sun there which is the water-bearer one time when Jesus came because this peak pursued by the coming of Christ when Jesus came before his death the disciple were looking on the last stepper they didn't know where to get the supper remember your Bible I'm giving you time so you can go in your Bible in your mind then kill them they asked Jesus where are we going to go to celebrate the supper because in that supper he have to afford the ministry of Judah because all this time Judah was a good man Judah was a preacher but at that time the ministry of Judah have to change from being a man supporting Jesus Christ to a man who's going to betray Jesus Christ are you there so to hit the room and to also inform the mystery of Melchizedek because Jesus thought that this is the last time I am drinking with you wine and taking bread I will do I won't do it this anymore until I meet you in heaven and that was one of the mystery of Melchizedek because the key select brought to Abraham bread and wine are you there so let me just wipe myself up so when they were looking for that room they didn't know where to go then Jesus told them he say you don't have to worry you go down some way search your scripture in your mind I'm giving you town he said you shall find a man carrying water peachwood with this message the Bible is a new book my brother in other words Allah taught me that there is some where are you dad when you go there you want to see it in the Bible are you ok ok if you need it call me this is not the time where we preach and you go home you don't understand ah if you don't understand call us let's sit down let make sure nobody is left behind we don't want to leave no children not no uncle everybody must go to the rapture yesterday I spoke most an hour and 30 minutes for water baptism and I have to skip a lot of stuff we used to do that 15 minutes we get you baptized I say no more any more this is not just a church this is not another message church we need to sit down and make sure you are grounded brother branham say when Paul was preaching and when he got a comfort he stand down with that prophet till they get the Holy Ghost we get the Holy Ghost come get the girl go they go nothing come back nothing well nothing and then we don't have to say coldness in the message no no more game are you there so he told them you go ahead you're gonna a man with a picture that man is gonna show you the last room I'm gonna take the Lord's Supper I'm gonna fold you that there the water girl gives the signal and when they saw they saw a mankind what the zodiac say already to see this meant a long time ago are you there now after that we spoke about the two twins I'm gonna go with the twins because every time from Genesis all the way to Revelation we got wings brother branham help me now therefore the great church making itself ready we found that Esau and Jacob before either child was born God said he loved one and he hated the other and remember there were twins I mean the zodiac didn't say mother Sam father get it twins every revolver produces twins even in the message certainly does there is twin born in natural men and spiritual men he was back in the Garden of Eden can enable the same thing started from there just keep on down and look at the church Jesus the pastor Judah the treasurer brothers out of the same tribe right in the same group same church one pastor the other one treasurer one a devil and one God Emmanuel which means God with us that's the way he goes Jesus saying the last day the two spirit will be so close it will deceive the very elect if he was possible if he was possible but it is not oh they shall never do it alright if you notice it's always been twins all alone can a neighbor we're twins even Jacob were twins Judah and Jesus come out of the same tribe in the same church even the Holy Spirit and the Antichrist is to be twins the Seventh Seal is opened Christ is coming down going the fist of the trumpet brother Branham say and opening of the Seventh Seal there is a losing of a necklace and ecclesiastical spirit under that same suit in a it's releasing crust it's also releasing the devil power of trans men were formation they are just like Judas Jesus both brothers in their child just like Esau and Jacob their crew and the dog even in the Noah's Ark sitting on the same roost and everything is a twin it's great work for it's in this great warfare that we are in so we are dealing with twins this is where I'm going to transition to move to the next one we found out that Judah have the Antichrist spirit and Jesus have the Spirit of God both of them twins and the zodiac already spoken look at this look at this look at this look at this even in the church there is a True Vine and a first time are you there watch out so I'll leave it alone what Jesus was upon the earth so it was Judah each came from different spirit and upon death each went to his own place either Judas a son of perdition son of hell Jesus is son of heaven he said I come from God I go from God and at the same time Peter committed a mistake but he never committed suicide but Judah middle is dead and he went he took his life away because his twins is living Jesus his living death he has also to leave the earth and when Jesus was living the earth brother branham say there were two sinners and Jesus has to happen so the other one has to be backed by Judah my god the spirit the spirit of trust letter came back upon the true church and the spirit of Judah came back upon the four church in his right in the revelation 6 and what what I begin to read the seals in other words brother Branham is telling you what happened in Pentecost was there spirit Devils in Jesus Christ that's why Jesus said it is expedient for me to go and then I'm going to send you a comforter Judah also has to go to take the spirit that was working on him and sell the spirit back to the church that's why when that spirit come he cannot work outside of the church he have to come in the church just like do you think the at request is already there drinking no holiday it's a religious spirit let me drop down see how Judah spirit came back as they rode a Honda so the antitrust law that came on the white horse when they opened the first seal brother branham say it was Judah again but Robin that's why brother branham said Judah once did devil incarnated are you there he said see Judah the spirit come as a rider on the white horse he was white so close to the wheel just as Judah was so close to Jesus so after the death the death and the resurrection of Jesus Christ when Jesus when Jesus pour his spirit back in the church and Judah also came and pour his spirit back again as an antichrist and when they fulfilled the world was rather which is Judah open up what we see we see a horse coming up with what check your Bible with a ball there is a horse amen if you look at this son it is called the Sagittarius the Sun is a central it's a creature that is most part men with a bow [Music] this message is very candid in the zodiac vindicated in the pyramid fabricated in the weakened world either so the zodiac already spoke about the other cluster he said hey look that one who come as a rather on the horse who is a Judah and when Judah came God because he pour his spirit on the church he was as the lion anointing if you noticed st. areas and lion are on the same line brother Stevens slow down you told us that the lion is the second coming of Jesus Christ because brother branham say it is the Lion of the tribe of Judah it is the second coming now you begin to say again that the lion is also fighting with the Antichrist spirit what are you talking about all the Sun our scripture in your written word scripture and other what I'm saying as this scripture have a compound meaning he can say this and then he can turn around and say this either so one dare to cross Spirit came up the lion rose again and begin to fight him your honor gracefully the lion was where do you get this stuff Fox you in the first stage was a what a long edge there was the Lion of the tribe of so Leo the Lion not only is he speaking about the second coming in spurts also of the anointing that was coming down upon the Apostle Paul to fight Judah the land of the tribe of Judah who crushed his own affluence of life taken damage the influence not of Judah of Christ the six healed this rather he was one he was one rather they wrote these horses let me drop down here the first edge of lion that was the word of course Christ let me help you up again Paul the Angel of the Church of Ephesus Paul funding this church being the messenger to it are you there and the spirit was in the land that time was a lying spirit and the lion is the Lion of the tribe of Judah which is crust and crust is the word Paul with the word - oh my god relax at home we are in deep trouble in water now so just hang on we on board with Captain Jesus Christ he's the one fighting this blood sooner we're going to get to the airport - hang on tight are you there revelation for God's chosen place of worship first one was found out was that ion that was the first beast that went forth to meet the challenge of that day the land of the tribe of Judah so when the lion work work and the Antichrist could not make his way up he flipped the host and he got into the red horse then the zodiac unfold the Scorpio Scorpio raddest even a scorpion scorpion is the battle it's just a bad bug but one we won't make the Scorpio so special is this thing if you take this thing off of swamp you nobody will feel Scorpio anymore he designed to Scorpio they're now running away from the bug they're running away from this thing the sting is very important when I rub it wherever you are Paul was riding one day he said that where is your let's go there we then turned by power I often said sometime there is where he look this thing out of death that is where Paul say Oh death where is your sting I have been told that many insect bees and things they get stinger and they are posing with it but one time they sting they their senior deaf had this thing in it one tom but Christ on Calvary took the Stinger out of this hallelujah and wanna think of it there he pulled the sting out of death for me and you all the sting of death that's why when it believer die he does not scream when you see a believer dying the Bible said they are sleeping if you see somebody dying and they're coming to get me you are not a believer because crust you are not heed I identify with Christ if you born again you are identified with Jesus Christ he takes your sting out so when they've come it's only a vehicle taking you to the presence of God Paul when he was going to get his head kind of watch something they were trying to kill Paul God never stopped the process of killing Paul but he only took the sting of death away from Paul are you there he said in Roman prison he said death where is your sting pointing back to cover and days were distinct was taken out of death so what does Scorpio say when Scorpio comes out God said the Ox anointing stem plane and brother branham said the Earth's is a beast that sacrifices in other word when you want to kill him he's not afraid it's an anointing that doesn't have the sting of death when death comes he say welcome that's why when they were burning the Christian in the early churches they were even singing Jesus but he's burning undercover and and that's a and he died but he they're brilliant gun right here everybody few because we are ego we are not to look you bring a gun a multitude a fight we are not torches we re go I'm there but one day also and they say if you don't win us Jesus Christ they cut off your head they say I'm ready when they put him there Paul is laughing he say hahaha they're gonna cut my head Oh death where is your sting I got people and they chop him off oh my god that's your second sure if you spiritual I'm already preaching the skills are you there in the future but Aryan age after the Antichrist gasps settle down and coming to that area age the little church could not do but simply level and another thing the Ox is a beast of sacrifice they give their life just as freely as they could give it in that dark age and they just went right in yes or no they didn't mind Danny people look and say these people are strange it is not the people it was the anointing on them that anointing the sting of death is out are you there and they just went right in they didn't man died if he was death that's all right they went and died anyhow why the very spirit of the age the Beast that went to meet him the second horse was an ox and a Nazis the beasts of sacrifice they weren't done in martyrdom during the dark ages are you there he said here that in the Dark Ages age they all spirit well full work level and sacrifice and give their life talents Tom Tarzan fell asleep under martyrdom and everything when they'd ever found out that he killed he killed he killed six dead like 68 million it's not workable they'd ever change yours he got to the Turtles when the seal broke when he was coming up the Bible say I see the Radha with what in his hand a balance or what a skill I hope you did Libre open up in the zodiac are you there Libra say don't worry sorry you see this curve that's the Antichrist he's going to come there with a scale a measure of Valley and the measure of wheat for measure of that God don't touch the earth and don't touch the wine brother branham saying if you look at barley and wheat by the random say barley and wheat are they stop they make bread either on the other side we are dealing with one and on everybody if you much bread is handled by a baker brother of a Taleggio swallowed up and that wine is handled by a Buckland I let you swallow that are you then shake yourself are you there are you there if you remember when Joseph went to prison he has a baker and a betrayal they killed this one that's where the arch across Mesaba but God said don't touch the old the bad way was restored back to follow and this message is going to respond us back together [Applause] that's your third Syria now these presents dealt with one two three four five six dealt with we still have three sons I don't think I will show you your place in the zodia are we okay okay we got to stop with this zodiac we will pick up in out of town let me finish that run around and say when this Antichrist spirit came back something happened he said God said the unknotting of men under looter and Wesley in order to fight it if you notice there are two signs day we found a clock week on there we found the passage there and we have one more Sun which is the cancer over there let me deal with it we want to deal with that another time and show you yourself in the zodiac brother Branham in the zodiac the bride in the zodiac and we deal with revelation 12 and everything else are you there now when you look at a Capricorn the Capricorn is a creature that is hot fish and has got he starts as a fish he ended as a god oh my god brother branham say in the world falling apart they suffer all worship and we spent the birthday of the Sun God which was Jupiter each one the Sun from December the 23rd the first until December the 25th it does not change its passing each Capricorn I gave you a quote from the message what does he mean we found out that fish represent the gospel and first I'm going to run quickly represent also the believers because when Jesus met Peter and after Peter get a big what a dolt of a big cultural features Jesus said from today I'm going to make you fishermen of men not anymore of fishes are you there so this this was speaking about the image that started as a good edge of the gospel of believers but damaged and that being a good brother branham a god always leave the ship to the sudden you've well you have seen you have seen that in a short time their God will run right up there and leadership and then he would jump out and let the ship going that's what he does he always does he was the god that led Jesus the lamb to the slaughter the Roman gods I'm going slowly spirit of Rome are you there that's right it is the denomination of God God represented denomination it's a denomination of God today that is leaving the innocent sheep to the slaughter put their self their name on the book yonder and so forth so image that started good that stagger with the gospel and that H ended up in the denomination your zodia told you that in the Saudis age age of Luton are you there because the Bible said I have one thing about you you carry a name look in your scripture you are living by a name that name was a denomination idea it was the age of Luther Luther started good they judge shall live by faith then ended up denomination watch they in the southeast churches now I just said this era gave tremendous growth to the denominational spirit God standard good ended up denomination in if the Koran tonight - dove I am appalled I am of Cephas was exhibited he was now such fragmentation of the body was deplorable they were living a name but we're dead that's why by the venom said once you become a denomination you are dead are either dead certain linear again they died the minute death organize the first this is the first denomination of repute that came out of what hallowed they flee the Catholic system they started group instead of keeping up they ended up again into the same mistake the Capricorn say look it's a fish by the end up as a goat let me finish with this and then we're gonna let you go brother branham say you know what man has to leave the ship today goat and you know what the God leads them to right to the slaughter them leadership they don't know where they are going so the goat goes up to the slaughter and the ship don't know no more than to follow a leader so it leads them right up in this slaughter then the G God jumps over the truck and the ship goes and get killed they're good they're good and what a long delay that's why we don't want a leader we don't want a pastor that's going to leave us from the message and bring us back to denomination because you're going to lead us back to the shredder let's deal with this the cancer and the passage I want to put them together because bada branham say this is the party sale this is the cancer this is the procedure this is the cancer you say oh brother branham made a mistake slow down you don't understand leave the bone okay let's get a cancer God call it devil where did the word cancer come from it comes from Latin word which used in medical term meaning a quad using the cancer day a crowd that you see along the sea sure he gets all them legs I'm gonna speak quickly the word cancer is crab let's go down here a cancer in them days was called a devil there were Devils Tormentor okay today the word cancer comes from the Greek or the Latin rather which means a club they have legs that spread forth so brother branham say that Leo the Lion we know that he said their cross fishes of what we are in now they cancer age by the random say the cross fishes of what we are in now and then he said the cancer age the Pisces the two fishes is another sound the cancer is another side why is brother branham putting them together because we already seen Luther you wanna see Wesley and separating from brother branham are you there that we go from there Diane Shabab oh brother Burnham say in the zone Jackie start off and running every age just before there is across reaches which is the cancer age that we are living in now he called that for cross-species he called that also cancer age okay let's separate it from the cancer first as Moses was given to son so will you be given to son first would be that you shall be able to detect the disease by the hand taking the patient in the right hand and left and if you be sincere and pray get them to believe you and business you when you pray nothing shall stand before your prayer not even cancer he spoke cancer that's the only disease he said among all the disease God spoke he only mentioned cancer are you there to brother branham because there is story not a different kind of diseases do you know that I'm gonna finish here I won't touch it we're going to go to the other side okay let me say that then we close we want to pick up when Paul was bitten Paul came back he say that they bit me funny that's one if you need the scripture see me he said funny - one is Teddy now if you go to the Old Testament they lost say when you beat somebody you must not be someone above 40 so the maximum bidding was 40 so when they beat Paul for some reason the man that was bidding Paul stop at any nine and we know that the anointing that was on Paul was the anointing that came from the fluence of the Lion of the tribe of Judah then Paul came back he says in my body I bear the mark of Christ in other words Paul was telling you that the number of building a gap was exactly what Jesus Christ said I'm gonna finish you this was too loaded brother branham say I said him see the sister already gathered but I wanna say I've seen him with his backbeat talking about Jesus to a Pope were 29 strap where did brother branham know Jesus had 39 strap it is not written in the Bible slow down a my brother slow down this is not a prophet like any other prophet slow down are you there they could not put 40 so they didn't stop at Paul by mistake either because the anointing of Paul was the anointing from the Lion of Judah either did you know there is famine non-major disease in the world today rather fear c'est tellement strapped across his back with kind of Mantell that's why when he died he's saying his finish every single category of sickness was their body strap we were here so no matter any disease that can appear in this world it's already in the atonement green coronavirus I will say Lord among the thirteen on you pull you see coronavirus there he was already covered there is nothing to fear we are the Savior he is the Lord our Redeemer let's stop here god bless you brother John [Applause] I'm sorry I went over I'm already probably half of water head hallelujah let's sing you're gonna sing Jesus the light of the world because we have the revealed word and the light of it and there's nothing that we should walk in more hallelu o ye Saints of life proclaim Jesus the light of the world g'bye and mercy in his name Jesus the light of the world will walk in the line such a beautiful light come where the dew drops of mercy your eyes shine all around us by day and by night Jesus the light oh just open sing that again and and pray for dismissal let's remember each other let's remember to cut the name of Jesus above everything that's a new revelation for me about the stripes and the number of diseases but it makes it so much easier knowing that there's already an atonement made and it's just a name Coronas just the name of something the devil jesus's name is greater than that just as it is with cancer and everything the others so let's let's go to him now and then we'll sing this one more Lord Jesus Lord what an honor and a privilege and just an overwhelming Lord sense of your presence here this morning Lord this afternoon Lord how we've enjoyed this Lord the time is long now Lord God we just asked Lord this message today Lord and the message
