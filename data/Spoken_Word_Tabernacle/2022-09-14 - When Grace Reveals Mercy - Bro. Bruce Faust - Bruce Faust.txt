TRANSCRIPT
========================================
that he's been able to do to build a beautiful homes like up on Campbell's Back Mountain Cavalier mountain is a pass through there a 35 years ago that was a desert we run Burrows through their own horseback and over on South Mountain here chasing Burrows the horses and now it's become a great metropolitan area of this great fabulous City that's growing into the tens of thousands times thousands just stretched out until now their own decay of the Cities bring it to a chaos smogs coming in your humidity is as bad as it is in Jeffersonville Indiana and Ohio valleys irrigation man always pollutes the world when the Indians had it it was a beautiful place but when white men come in he brought his sins and liquor and immorality and he's polluted the lands that has become nothing but a almost assessed pool what a thing to look up on God will wipe it from the face of the Earth one of these days and he's choosing a people of Ryan righteousness that shall reign upon the Earth As He Reigns his King he is now taking his people for his name the people for his kingdom now would this smart intelligent intellectual group of Israel it's great powerful intellectual president or King jeroboam who was a smart man and what they hear this little unknown problem would this great message that's burning in his heart would he be able to walk through the streets and the people with women would dress themselves nicely again A man should leave the taverns and the places of sin and turn to God at the preacher this little unknown fella that was a question might have come into his mind or does mine when I seen standing there in his little bald heads shining in the sun his Gray beard hanging around his coat looking down through there and looking up on that sit in his air eyes narrowing his heart beaten yet and I saw the kingdom of God that should be established there all waited in sin and with the rebuke from God that would rebuke from the King to the beggar in the street every priest preacher King potentate Monarch whatever he was he had the curse of God to put on him because they would receive him on whether you're understanding remember he had no recommendation he come different from our evangelists of the day he had no recommendation from the priest they didn't even know who the fellow was but there's one who knowed who he was as the one that's standing that's all counted to him as long as he knows where he was sent from his message had to go forth just the same and regardless he had no denominational credentials to back him up when he went into the city to come to the Ministerial Association and say my brethren I of this certain group this religious group I belonged to the certain certain he had not that foreign neither did he had a fellowship card the show that he even stood in good fellowship with the minister of associations from the country came from [Music] yaddle cooperation for his campaign you never even consulted anybody about it that little fella was standing in a difficult place it'd be enough for a man to turn and go back and take up his hurt again don't take off where you left if he was just a thought but you see the man didn't take no second thought he didn't think about any credentials neither did he think about a fellowship card he only thought about one thing and that was the word of the Lord God had given a dream of the charge that he must go over there and prophesy that's all made any difference to him he had the word of the Lord and therefore he felt he didn't need credentials or any recommendation or any cooperation the only thing he needed was he had cooperation with God and that's all it took long as he was in the will of the Lord what differs did it make as long as he know that his message was from God God would vindicate that message you had to and when he broke the message it looks like that there would be a all the priests and preachers and the prophets of that age would have come and repented because they would have seen the condition of the place the scene the moral corruption but when you begin to prophesy with the word of the Lord it was thought [Music] foreign [Music] Bible

brother Stephen and inviting us the and just allowing us to be here with you this evening amen it's a blessing amen humbled to to get to stand in the presence of God's children this evening amen now if we could I'd like to just go into the scripture turn with me over to the book of Saint Luke the 18th chapter Saint Luke the 18th chapter let us begin reading at the ninth verse amen Jesus here and he spake this Parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others notice the Lord himself is speaking a parable these aren't necessarily real people he's talking about but he's given them a a story parable and who he's talking to them that trusted in themselves and they despised others two men went up into the temple to pray the one a Pharisee and the other Republican the Pharisees stood and prayed thus with himself God I thank thee that I am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican I fast twice in the week I give tiles of all that I possess and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinner and Jesus said I tell you this man went down to his house Justified Justified rather than the other for everyone that exalteth himself shall be amazed and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted dear heavenly father we thank you tonight God Lord that you'd call upon us father but Lord in this word that we've read in this time that has set aside God we pray father for your presence God that made these lips of clay speak only thy words let us not run asunder in our own faults but God let every heart be thinking upon you continually let us humble ourselves tonight under Thy Word God that we might receive of thy kingdom let it become tonight father we pray and bless every heart every need God and let it our ears be inclined to hear you this evening in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen you might have your seat and I'd like to look tonight if I could upon this scripture and the Lord is laid upon my heart this title that when Grace reveals Mercy when Grace reveals Mercy tonight when we look at when is a Time is a time when there becomes a a certain time Grace is the unmerited favor of a living God unmerited favor election I would call it Grace is the election of God Upon A people Grace was the election of God that looked upon Moses and he found Grace in the sight of God when he looked upon the whole earth that he couldn't see anything there but he saw Noah and something of Noah found a Grace in the sight of God I believe Noah's name was written in a book somewhere and God said this name is going to carry forth my very word in this hour and by that Grace that that God had chosen he revealed unto Noah the mercies of God in the midst of the Judgment that was coming upon the Earth and it was at that time when all of the sin had heaped up when that when we would say in this hour that the cup of the amorites had come to fulfillment and was overflowing that God would look and he would have Grace and his election would stand that he would find Noah there in the midst of it he would reveal Mercy unto Noah that would show him a way out of the Judgment that was coming upon the face of the Earth and so to look upon this we would look and we would see that Jesus has given a a parable it's not not necessarily two real people but it's it's God expressing himself and showing to to those there that thought that they were righteous in their self they thought that what they were going to do was going to achieve something great but yet Jesus comes and he gives the parable of I don't know I want to look not at the Pharisee but I want to look at that public and that was standing there he was standing to where he couldn't even approach it would seem that he would stand afar off he'd come into the temple but he didn't enter in so much but he he would he would stand afar off and he wouldn't he wouldn't wasn't even able to raise his head up to heaven to look into the face of the one that he was come to him but as he bowed his head and he beat upon his breast and this here was an Israelite this here was that God was referencing was just a a an Israelite that would understand the laws and he would understand the the offerings and he'd understand the Tabernacle in a in a sense of of he had been raised up and he'd understand all the all the all the ins and the outs all the all the eyes that were dotted all the t's that were crossed he would he would had been raised to understand he wasn't a Pharisee but yet he was still an Israelite he knew the laws of what they were he knew the understanding of the Tabernacle he knew how that the priest could approach into that place of Mercy and so he stands there and he cries out he beats upon his breast and he cries out and he said Lord God be merciful merciful Mercy he was looking for a place to find Mercy from God because in his life he understood that Mercy he wasn't just talking about just any Mercy but you followed that through and he was looking for a place of where that Mercy Seat laid he was looking for that Mercy Seat and this was The Mercy Seat standing there tarot telling the parable of a republican of a somebody that would understand about a mercy seat and he would be crying out and show me mercy show me the entrance into the place of Mercy show me an Open Door a place that God has been sprinkled with the blood of an innocent one show me a place God that I can release all of my cares somewhere God that I can find an atonement show me God where I can find my position in this place foreign and and we see this and this is what I'm that that I look upon and we see that here it wasn't just a a mercy of Lord be Mercy you know you know Lord just just lift a little burden and be merciful but this was this was a cry for show me that Mercy that show me that perpetuation that perpetuation that is a continual God where that blood was sprinkled to where I know that all of the sins of the past all of the sins of the present all of the sins of the future show me the place of perpetuation show me the blood that is the perpetuation show me the just God that has given a just law but not only that but he gave a just fulfillment to that law show me a God show me a place God that where all of my burdens yes are covered all of my all of my oppression is relieved all of my sin is dealt with all of my fears are vanquished show me God reveal unto me your mercy and you know Revelation isn't something we just learn about because this man had known about it the public the the Pharisee understood it the Pharisee had set in church all his life he wasn't even looking for Mercy because he thought he had done worked his way into it but this man was looking for Mercy he was looking for a place and mercy is that release amen Mercy is that release you know it reminds me of a time that that an eagle found himself scratching in a barnyard amen and he was looking for a release of that burden of this that was nothing of his very nature you know he'd go over here and he'd nibble a little bit and it didn't satisfy he'd walk over here and talk to this group and he'd try to talk to him and they'd cluck back at him amen he'd go over here and you know he'd look at he'd stand beside of him and somebody would snap a picture and he didn't look like they looked he'd go and they'd look in the same mirror and they'd stand side by side and they'd look one way but he'd look another way hey man he was birding with something that you couldn't explain he was burdened with something amen that nothing could teach him out of it they were trying to teach him you hold your beak down like this and you and you plug down like this but he just couldn't he he couldn't he couldn't conform to that image amen he couldn't conform to what everybody else wanted him to conform to and he was seeking mercy God show me your mercy and and deliver me from this vile place that I'm under to give me a revelation God I'm not satisfied with with these with these chickens teaching me all about what an out to me see it was deeper than that it was deeper than that there was a bird and there was a long and that that public and that public and when he he stood afar off in the temple he really wasn't like the rest of them he couldn't even lift his head up and praise in the midst of all that they were doing because he knew in him seeing new in reality that all of this workings all of this carrying on wasn't going to satisfy God opened mine I revealed to me give me Revelation I don't want knowledge I want revelation I don't want a head knowledge but God give me the very knowledge of the Living God [Applause] burden in the desire design of this that the word of Jesus himself standing there where did this story come from where did that story come from he wasn't just just making up some story but but God himself was delivering a parable a story of the very burden of the heart of what he had come to give answer to amen there was a question there was a question who are these what do these are right but he was the one that asked the question but he was the same one that had the answer Hosea would find over in the book of Hosea chapter 6. we'd find over there and as we look there in Hosea chapter 6. we find them talking of of the remnant they're talking about my how great and and how God's going to give Deliverance in the first but he comes down to the the sixth verse and he says and this is God being in response and he's talking about Ephraim and how that my their goodness is like the morning Cloud it just vanishes away under the heat of the Sun and he says in verse 6 for I desired Mercy I desired Mercy and not sacrifice this was the god that had given them the law of sacrifice and to where they had sacrificed and sacrificed and sacrificed and sacrificed until it became a stink in the nostrils of God for he desired Mercy he desired Mercy he desired that mercy and not sacrifice and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings that knowledge of God is not a head knowledge but it is a a recognition of a living God I'd say it like this in this hour it is the recognition of your message and your day somebody that can recognize that God that was standing present not a god of a book or a law or a tradition not a god of somewhere in the future but to recognize God standing in their midst because God wanted somebody to fellowship with he wanted somebody not to be able to do it on their own but to come and cry for mercy he wanted to show somebody the love of almighty God the mercy that would show them who they really are and to acknowledge who he is who he is so it's not that uh that the works would get us there it's not the ability of our ourselves to attain it's not how long I've been in it but it's God that you would give a revelation of Mercy that your election would show your people who and what has given them their freedom you know job one time job you look at job and you and you and you find that job was was was a man that that needed Mercy he needed he was under a a place in the whole book of Job and and you can read it and I know we have and we've studied it but you look at job and job the whole book of Job is a showing of what man and the Devil Himself had presented to man that if if if God is good to you you'll serve him and if you're good God will be good to you and so job in all of us and job is way before the law it's given way before the law so job's not running on just law he's running on tradition of what the devil had implemented in the Garden of Eden that you do this and you get this you do that and you understand this you take this and you become as God laughs see so it always placed in the heart of man trying to attain to something and so job The Book of Job was all about somebody trying to obtain under the under the place of God but as job was there he was found of God and he was found a place of that he was perfect and astute evil and he was he was in the sense of everybody else he lived a higher place but then so the devil come to God and and and and and said now if you take all of this away he won't serve you foreign he didn't know the truth of what was leading job so Joe had offered a sacrifice a burnt offering notice he had burnt us offering for his kids and all of his family in case that they did something or got somewhere he had a burnt offering and so we know the story The Devil coming he took everything under the hand of God he took everything this and that and and then we find job and this is where I want you to look we find job sitting on an ash Heap and he's scratching himself with a pot shirt he's he's got this utensil that he's scratching and he's oozing and and he's under this this this place of where all my friends now they didn't want to come to him because he was filthy and dirty now they thought man this was the this was the one that everybody come to ask question this is the one that every body comes seeking wisdom but now nobody would even come talk to him to where even his wife would sit there and say Joe why don't you just Curse God and die but job was sitting there and I want you to look at where he was sitting on that Ash Heat but as he you look at what was it it was a remnants of a burnt offering and what was job and his heart doing job was taking all that he could muster and he was trying to return back to where he knew God was because he thought maybe I left him somewhere maybe I've ran off from him maybe I maybe there's something I can do so job in all of his humility runs back to the ash pal and he gets down in that ass pile and he's seeking God with all that is within him and he's not finding the answer foreign but he finds three friends that come to him amen and one comes he's a Pentecostal like none other he says listen Joe Ma I woke up in the night and I saw a vision and man I felt chills run all over my body and so you listen to me job I've got the answer for you I'm going to teach you how that you can get out of this situation another of his friends said listen to her we've got Traditions to handle this we've got a long list of church Traditions that if you do this this is going to lift and you'll be okay another one come to job and he said listen job I don't know how it is but I just know and if you do what I say and do it perfectly you're going to get you're going to get delivered and so they sat and we know the story they they talked around everywhere they talked and they talked and they talked but then one day God come one day God and he asked job he said job he said you've been talking about all of this you've been discussing things you had no knowledge of but he said I want uh job I want you now to pull up your bootstraps I want you to stand here like a man and I'm going to ask you a question where were you Joe whatever you when I called for the sun to rise where were you when I fed every beast in the field where were you job if you're so perfect if you're so right Joe where were you and all of this brother Brandon would say that here he was taking job to a lower level and showing job who he really was and then and then we find job I want you to notice where we find job then after God talks to him hot dogs joke we find job over there at 10 and what is he doing he is repenting he is him hard with himself and he is repenting where in dust and Ashes because he recognizes Abraham who am I talking to God but dust who am I he said I have uttered things that I don't know and right there he said I have heard but now I see and when the revelation of Mercy comes by grace that God has chosen a time he has chosen a place and he is chosen a people that he is going to express his Mercy to so when Grace reveals Mercy it changes the situation but it's the revealing of that Mercy that is shown and you watch job how that he changed everything about him changed he changed I want to read I want to read over and look because there is as as Hosea would say that my I desired mercy and not sacrifice the knowledge the recognition of God more than burnt offerings and Jesus would talk to him over in Matthew the ninth chapter and the 12th verse and they were talking about why do why does why does this happen why do your disciples do this why do you eat Republicans and sinners why do you mingle with this crowd and he'd say but when Jesus heard that he said unto them that they that behold need not a physician but they that are sick but go ye and learn what that meaneth I will have mercy and not sacrifice for I am not come to call the righteous but Sinners to repentance there's a place that brings us to an understanding a revelation a revelation changes the situation all that we can learn of our own ability all that we can study of tradition all that we can gather of our own ability will lead us to not but when Revelation comes when Revelation comes then it all changes it all changes now watch when you go to that and that Republican he was looking at that Mercy Seat he was looking for a place of Mercy and over and over in Romans chapter 3 in the perpetuation on read in verse 22 even the righteousness of God which is by faith we know bioluminescence faith is a revelation it's not something we must it's not something we work it's not something that we can we can we can do this this and this and gather Faith but it is a revelation given by God Alone amen which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and above all them that believe for there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God what being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom God has set forth to be a perpetuation there he is there he is there is that Mercy that that public and Jesus was expressing through that Republican he was looking for this this is what mankind is looking for but even more than just mankind but the Bride of Jesus Christ is looking for that Mercy above everything [Music] they're looking for that place of perpetuation the Prophet would even preach a message that God's provided place of worship there's no other place it's got to be in there it's got to be in there where it's granted it's not granted just in a church building it's not granted under some School of Theology it's not granted under my good tutorship of raising a child it is granted by the mercies of almighty God and the election of God what whom God has set forth to be the perpetuation through faith in his blood through the Revelation in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just who God has to be just that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus now you go into you go back into Exodus the 25th chapter and we begin to look and we see the the the Tabernacle and god-given direction to Moses and he's telling him all about the the the Tabernacle and the place and Heaven he puts it in there and he establishes the place of The Mercy Seat amen he establishes the place in Exodus 25 and 22. and he's built it all up he's expressed the golden and overlaying the cherubims and placed in there for wings up over the top of it and lay in The Mercy Seat in verse 22 and God says and there I will meet with thee foreign that he was going to give and there he tells and expresses there in the Old Testament in Exodus 22 there I will meet with thee and I will commune with thee from Above The Mercy Seat now if Jesus himself the word of God was talking about this public and that was expressing a desire for this Mercy Seat to see this Mercy Seat he'd heard about it he had been told stories about it he had studied about it he has there had been offerings on it for him but it ain't the same it's not the same when you're just hearing about it job heard about it but he had to see it had to see it had to see it what she said Above The Mercy Seat from between the two cherubims which are upon the Ark of the testimony of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel now here he's telling Moses he said in this place I'm going to meet you under the under the under the wings of the cherubims in between there Above The Mercy Seat and then you go back and you study the mercy said I'm sure the pastor here's preached on it how did The Mercy Seat was sprinkled out of the air and the priests would come in the high priest would come in and he had taken he'd take the two uh bullets and he'd bring one for himself he'd bring one for the congregation he'd bring in the realm for the sins of the whole thing and he would bring him and he would bring the fire and he'd place it upon the presence and in the presence there upon that Holy Fire it burst up into a into a cloud or a a sweetened smell and it would burst up and he would sprinkle that mercy seat seven times over with the blood and as he was sprinkling that blood what was it doing it was making an atonement for adjustment that God could come and dwell in the place where he's so long to dwell the low is not to keep man away but the low is to make provision so that God could have Fellowship that God could come down and talk and fellowship with the very creation that he had made it was in this evil thing to keep man away but it was the very love of God that he knew that I am a clean would just God holy and I can't commune with filth and my whole creation has become filth so I've got to make a way and he presented a law and he gave a dressing and he gave an ordinance and he gave away that he could be just in communion with his people Glory why did Jesus stand there with that woman at the well when she said not in this matter in this mountain we're supposed to and over here we're supposed to and Jesus said nowhere in any of that but God seeking the true worship to Worship in spirit and in truth not in a church not under some tradition not under some law but to worship the true worshiper worships in the presence of God and God only has one place for true worship and he had to make a way when the whole thing was filthy he had to make a way in all of the world and a tent on the backside of the desert he made a way he laid out a list of commands he chose a person he chose a people he chose a tribe he chose an order he chose a blood he chose a he chose a place a place of perpetuation he chose a mercy seat he chose everything that he could make way together that he could bring Fellowship back it was all in Shadow of time until when a Time that all of that wouldn't be a tabernacle made with a hands oh my because he was going to come himself and make a way toward the law would even mention a place of this Hebrews would pick it up and say where this pie priest would not offer an offering he wouldn't bring in two Lambs or two Bullocks one for him and one for the congregation because he was offering himself he was Harvard in himself that he would be the once and for all oh my God Paul would pick it up in Hebrews over there in the in the ninth chapter and he'd pick up the emergency scene he said not in any particulars not in detail he brings it up but he begins to talk and he begins to express and show and he talks to the high priest and then a high priest was the entrance and by that high priest he would come and he would walk out and he would tell everyone and they would watch as he would walk in and go and do the service and he'd and he they would listen for that Holy Holy Holy they'd wants and they'd see the things taking place from the outside but they never saw what was going on never and so they would sit there see there was tribe their Levi and them they were the only ones that would go in and touch anything and wrap it all up and put it away and establish and pick it up and move it forward nobody outside got to see that and only the high priest got to stand under the Shekinah Glory and here here he was and as he was standing there that Republican was crying out to see this not just to hear about it to see it I just hear about it but to see it amen I'd be merciful show me mercy show me your place of Mercy show me that place of Mercy show me and look number seven in verse 89 and when Moses had was gone into the Tabernacle of the congregation to speak with him then he heard the voice of one Speaking unto him from all for the mercy seat that was upon the Ark of the test of testimony from between the two cherubims and he spake unto him all right so now he's speaking and he's deliberate and he's telling us telling each and every one by the mouth of Moses and he goes out and he expresses but listen the heart of the believer is not satisfied it's not satisfied we're just hearing something no they're not satisfying but they need Mercy because Mercy changes everything Mercy is the release of the pressure and the least of the burden Jesus was coming and say take my yoke upon you for my burden is light this was the word of God the mercies he's standing there showing this is the place of Mercy this is the release of the pressure and the burden of this life this is the mercy when we cry Lord have to be merciful be mercy God we're about to be in the car wrecking Mercy Lord Mercy but see we say it in vain so often but the Publican was crying out mercy God show me show me this place of mercy and here Moses he was there and and job discovered and looked upon it but but we look and we see that that revelation of what God had come that when that place of Mercy or when that Grace that election had revealed Mercy I want to look because Paul would talk about it over in Hebrews and he'd go through it and we don't have time here this evening but look I want to I want to go on jump on over in the Book of Revelations because we we know that there is the place of the mercy in this hour amen because it's that Mercy in the book of Hebrews he'd talk about that high priest you know they didn't have to offer one for self because he was an offering continually right there he was that that high priest and he'd go and he'd Express Mercy he would be tempted and come and and be as we are so that he could he could provide true Mercy that he would come and make a way that that this could be delivered unto his children amen Grace when when would Grace come when did when did Grace give the the revelation of Mercy he gave it over there in in the book in the four gospels he gave it over there at the day of Pentecost he gave it through the scriptures of Hebrews he's given it all down we've had men have picked it up through the church ages and talked about it and then tried to explain it and and tell about it but it takes a revelation to really know this Mercy why would the prophet in himself he would say that I would push a quarter down the street if that would get you healed with my nose that's the burden in a man that knows this Mercy but it's but is has a weakness that he can't provide it you know what that's called it's called an infirmity it's called in infirmity and we are we have a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities because why did he become flesh so they can suffer like we suffer so that he would sit over there he said so he could secure or he could bring help in the time of need Paul would look and he'd say salt the Lord three times gone to deliver me of this this infirmity that that buffets me continually he'll talk about that infirmity that would grip him so that God if you would just deliver me of this thing but God would would deliver back a truth to him and he'd say hold on Paul but my Grace is sufficient [Music] my grace is sufficient see what was he showing Paul he was showing Paul it's not the infermin to everybody's got him but it's my grace that is sufficient that my strength is made perfect in your weakness what is the desire of the True Believer it is that perfect faith it is a perfect love it is where Jesus said be thou perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect he'd have never said that if he didn't have a way he'd never give us that but when we mess up we say Mercy when we come short we say Mercy when we see somebody struggling that we can't help we cry Mercy now why because that is the infirmity of the weakness of the human being that I cannot help another for I need help myself man can't help man but God is the only one but through the through the Avenue of of Revelation that is delivered [Music] oh it's carried in these Earthen vessels though where's that hidden it's hidden in these Earthen vessels the Earth and vessel can't help you but under the revelation of who is this Melchizedek [Applause] the high priest he begins to show us that there's something in the believer he said he said there he said what by the foolishness of preaching he chose I love when he I love it when he chooses something because this is the god that cannot lie a God that does not make mistakes but he chose by the fullness of preaching to do what to save them which believe they never said he'd save the unbeliever but he had saved them which believed see we think oh everybody out there but then we believe those are the chosen elected of God they are the ones that believe they believe when nothing else will because there's something in them there's a desire in them why I remember walking into a restaurant one time this this stands with me I walked into a restaurant one time and there was a lady standing there Sunday afternoon I'd I believe at a place and and I looked at her she had her earrings and she had her her makeup she had her you know her bobbed hair and she had her worldly attire on and and as I was looking I'm thinking what is it and people don't desire anymore and at that point I realized that's all that they desire They Don't Really desire Mercy they desire the ability to do something and to hopefully be good enough to one day make it into heaven because everybody wants to go to heaven who wouldn't who wouldn't that's that's recognizing a story of streets of gold it's recognizing hearing stories about a wonderful place who wouldn't want to go there brother Steve but what makes somebody that could serve this God and be in communion with this God and so desire a closer walk and a revelation that he would stand there and say that if God if I get there on that day and he kicks me into hell I'll still love him there was there was something to desire in him that would stand there and say that if he desired me to be Antichrist that's what I would want to be see it's aligning with the revelation so Desiring of Mercy show me God watch Revelations I want to get over the revelations it's it's it's it's it's common understanding in the around the message forgive me for my weak eyes but once you're in Revelations we know that we know in Revelation the fourth chapter we know the the the the the church ages are are over chapter 4 we know that this is the the calling up that John would look in verse one after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne now here John is gathering a revelation like he's never had and he that said was to look upon he begins to talk about the throne and the elders and he comes down to his Express and he sees all of heaven and he's beginning to see things now that he's never seen before he's heard of these things he's watching and he's come up hither to another place amen amen but if you notice there and after this I looked when when is the time when is a Time when after this after this John recognized another voice was calling for it not another but the same boys was calling him to something else to show him and then we know that we're going down into verse 5 and we see there and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne of book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals after this is when he saw this after this and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice he's asking the question who is Worthy who is Worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and the response of John and I wept while no man in Heaven Nor nerve neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I John wept wept wet of infirmity who can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities but here John is is weeping under the bird and who's Worthy and he we know that he he looked all over Heaven he looked all over Earth he looked he he he he would say he shot instruments Down Under the Earth he he he sent messages all through Heaven he got on if it was present day he'd got on he'd got on social media and he asked and he looked and he'd find and he'd seek and he'd find where who is worthy to take me and show me mercy who can give me the revelation of this Mercy that I'm looking for why John was under a burden he was under a burden he was under a burden a time for the bride here in this hour he's under a bird and he was looking he was looking he was looking he was looking he had heard he'd heard he'd heard he'd gone through all the churches he'd studied all the Traditions he'd read all the books of all the preachers he had studied all the schools of theology he'd gone this way and he'd gone that way but he come to something and that that when he stood there and he said there's something more [Music] something more than just going to church there's something more than just living a good life there's something more because they don't satisfy me because there's something deeper there's something crying out on the inside and look he said those are none's worthy what were they looking for somebody worthy not somebody that was that had that had done good man that would one of these study that we look it out it's the one that is elected for a position [Music] looking for that was elected where were they elected before the foundation so John had he he's where'd he search he searched all through Heaven All Through Time he searched everywhere and he's looking and he's looking and he wept but then all of a sudden the voice comes to him don't weep John we found one what book is he in what tape is he on what church does he show up at what preacher does he hang out with where is he he said behold the lion of the tribe of Judah he hath prevailed what did he Prevail to do he was one Worthy and John turned around to look he'd heard about it he he had been there with it he had been standing there looking at he'd watched it in real life come on Saints he said we were Witnesses [Applause] first John he gave witness of it little children he stood there with Peter and James and they witnessed with their eyes but over here he couldn't find out who was Worthy takes a greater Revelation why Paul would say no man Nothing by the flesh now you know the frustration when you're trying to witness to somebody and tell them the hope that lies within you you can't tell them but he's got to give it to him John was looking for one worthy he knew there was one that died on the cross he knew that there was a prize that had been paid but who was going to be worthy to take the book what was it about that book what was it about that book he looked and he looked he said behold and John turned around and there he saw the very thing he saw the bloody Lambs standing there the bloody lamb watch what he said there but in the breach between the Sea of the church ages and the seals John looked at that lamp and that lamb looked like he had been slain and then he noticed he was wounded and cut and bruised and bleeding oh my a bloody lamb that's what took our place that's what took our place is an exchange of simple lamb had to take our place and he saw the lamb he proceeded out talking about the lamb the lamb proceeded out because listen John it doesn't looked everywhere John hadn't saw him because he had been way back into the eternities Glory when when has this come to pass watch now and brother Adam says there where was he he was back there into the eternities even making intercession and showing that those who had come to God under the offering of the blood of bulls and of goats of substitutionary offering because them who believed it pointed to him for every offering that was offered in forever for every burnt offering that was given for every blood that was sprinkled every lamb that was slaughtered every single one they all sat there when the True Believers when they offered it and and their conscience was was was was was just washed over for another year and they would sit there and they were doing what they were pointing to one to come not seeing him but knowing about it about him my brother Brandon said what she said now look because them who believed it pointed to him and the blood had not been shed yet as back there so he was there to clear them he was there to clear them he was there to clear you and I I know God I hope he's here tonight for every sinner of the Lamb been slain how can Jehovah see anything but that Bloody lamb standing there that's all that he sees and the lamb proceeded out watch and the lamb proceeded out into the vision now where'd he come to where'd that Bloody lamb appear out of Eternity to he come from all eternity and where did he come he come here brother Brian said he'd come out of that Vision John was watching what was John watch he was watching a vision but the Visions got to speak the vision has to come manifest the vision cannot stay a vision it's got to become reality John was the type of that bread that bread has got to recognize she's not recognizing a church she's not recognizing a tradition she is recognizing that Bloody lamb that is steadforth out of Eternity she knows it wasn't an altar that she got saved at the bride knows it wasn't some night she got saved she knows hey a minute want some Sensation that saved her she knows it wasn't some work they put her there but now she's understanding she's getting revelation she's getting revelation of a bloody lamb she's getting a revelation what is it something is coming to her something is expressing through this message when he said them divinely revealed mystery truths would literally turn her heart where's it taking her he'd say in another place this is not a repeat or return to Pentecost where is he taking his breath he's not taking her just to the garden but before there ever was where was he talking to job about before he ever was what is he doing he's taking her back to the place taking her back what is he doing he's calling forth he's calling forth for his little eagle [Applause] where is he taking her before that burn yard why don't she fit why don't she Gaggle repeat in because he's taking her to where she come from she's beginning to realize now I'm not of this world she's getting a revelation mother reading of the word by the study to the books by night vision blood bloody lab oh that before I was here I was somewhere before I stepped but here I'm going back to that before I ever lost a hair I'm going back to it [Applause] what was it the wind Grace win the election chose a place and a people that he was going to reveal this to and here she is this bad what is this bringing her to the marriage of the Lamb why because she has made herself ready not by her works hoping in Christ she has been found in that provided place of worship she has found herself what did you what did John look and see what did John look to see he's sitting there and he's watching that Bloody lamb what does that Bloody lamb do he comes and he takes that book what does he think he takes the title deed book of redemption and he's taking that buck and he's bringing it across from him that's head on the throne and he's taking that book and brother Brandon said what did John see when that in the book was crossing hands what did he see he saw his name Glory Oh Heaven under the Earth above the Earth heard high jump what glory and Hallelujah because John so Mercy he's so true living Mercy he found one Worthy it wasn't a church it wasn't a preacher it was a tradition it wasn't a law but it was a man Worthy and that man wrote a book and his name was on it oh my Saints when we recognize when those seals come to your life you don't get it by just reading the book but when God puts you in certain times and he chooses to open to you the mercy that you so long for he is going to show you your name on that book and when you know your name is on that book every devil out of hell is defeated she has become an invincible Army wow because she has found herself unbeatable amen glory that she cannot be defeated there's not a death [Applause] she finds herself in the body of Christ her place and her position and she knows that the word of God has told her that all things were made by him and for him and that includes every devil out of hell every sickness that would come every darkness that he created everything was for her who are you tonight where does the mercy come to who are you that God has made it all for you a paradox Murder My Name said he created the whole world to take a bride out of it and here we are here we are the Bride of Jesus Christ the love then she has to hip she's not worthy oh but she found herself in one that was Worthy she found her place in the provided place of God oh saint what about this message that the world don't understand what about this message that they can't go any further because there's a gate and there's a camp and they can't go beyond it oh but this bride has found herself beyond the gates of time hey what did that Revelation give her the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against her she has gone and took of them Gates put them upon her shoulders and marched into the eternities she is a Simpson was that the Gates of Hell cannot contain her she's going somewhere oh say so Church tradition can't container [Applause] [Music] an eagle I'm closing that eagle what did that eagle do he was there and he was pecking with the old chicken it don't taste good it don't taste good all but one day he recognized this message as Eagle food [Applause] he recognized it by Stephen he recognized that this message was Eagles food and what did he do he left that other thing and it heard from his theophany where was his elfeny it was over an eternity [Applause] oh brother Branham said in one spot we bypassed it but now he's telling us we're hearing from it Oh Glory before we didn't understand it but now we're so close we're starting to hear from that other side and win when Grace has given us Mercy that our theophany now is calling us home we found a place we found a place by the county we found a place [Applause] that's why brother Brandon would look at them seven angels and he'd look at that one and he'd say that one meant more to me than all the rest well he was hearing from his word body he was hearing from that the opening All Saints when we are standing as Christ stood and we are hearing standing what did he call that book he's calling for he's claiming her he's calling for to come stand by his side let's stand to our feet the scene All Saints hope Mercy Mercy let's sing that song If we can Mercy rewrote my life see my life I wrote it with my with my Deeds you wrote your life with all your deeds and you think that's all you amount to Homer when he comes and shows you Mercy he shows you another book and he shows you another life and he shows you justification that you never did it in the first place oh my Mercy Mercy [Music] re-roll my life Y'all Gonna help me I can't sing oh God's mercy rewrote my life I should have fallen my soul cast down but your mercy [Music] rewrote my life oh yes [Music] mercy God that Mercy the revelation where we come from this message has given us that understanding see [Music] all like that publicly ah I should have fallen oh my soul [Music] cast down oh but your mercy [Music] God bless you [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen amen when Grace reveal Mercy Hallelujah do you know that Mercy is also a person who's that person but do you know that Mercy is also another person I knew when I say Mercy is a person you're going to put it on Jesus which is true that Mercy is also another person you want to know it do you want to know yes sir are you tired to Romans chapter 9. Hallelujah glory to God you see the praise and altar coming back up again see the Tabernacle coming back up again see melchizer they're coming back up again amen amen I hope you understand the language of God Romans chapter 9. if you dare you can say Amen verse 11 the Bible say for the children being not yet born so does he have anything to do with your birth so take your birth out come on neither having done any good or water if they would have said any good and stop there somebody would have said something the Lord said not only good good or evil some did things good some are evil so does he have to do with what you did it's difficult for human being to accept this amen Kama that the purpose of God not your purpose but the purpose of God according to election must end so God won't establish his election and that election have nothing to do with your birth or nothing to do with what you have done it is all about God's sovereignty amen what he says and what he picked that's what gonna matter Amen in other words you can be 100 good it doesn't matter and somebody might be 100 bad what matter is what did God say about you do you hear me what God says I don't have time everybody okay in other words if God say yes amen if then if they find you in evil yes we'll take evil and change that evil to make the yes of God stand do you understand what I'm saying I wish I have time I would have set some people free by the preaching of the word do you hear what I'm saying usually the way human being operate this is God and this is you amen and you want to be good amen so you can tell God that you deserve it amen what Paul is saying is this one doesn't matter to God everybody okay this one have nothing to do with God what matters to God is what he spoke do you understand it is what God determined in other words it is God's own personal decision thank you everybody okay amen if God decided no you can make Judah a disciple [Music] I can make this I don't have time do you know who chose Judas who chose him how can he choose somebody and lose him your boss is speaking now but you you don't have time everybody okay everybody okay who chose Judas how can Jesus choose something and lose him because the scripture said do you hear me the scripture says that accept the son of perdition everybody here so no matter how much good how good Judah will do things Jesus will be forced to lose Judah remember Judas came and returned the money do you understand what I'm saying Judas returned the money but even the returning of the money which look good cannot make Judah back again he cannot restore Judah back because the decision for Judah was no do you understand what I'm saying but Peter deny Jesus how many times with a three Witness everybody okay he even cast everybody okay but Peter's decision was yes do you follow me so when Jesus looked at Peter about to go to Temptation he goes quickly he begin to pray for Peter he said Lord not Peter not Peter not Peter not Peter not Peter why didn't Jesus pray for Judah he said Peter I pray for you why he didn't pray for Judah why he didn't pray for Judas only Peter because the decision the election say Peter is right here anybody here so when he goes down to Hell when he comes back up the first person is who was struggling he was feeding God tell Peter do you see the message of the hour you see the message of the hour can I read or you good you already got it can I read you sure verse 11 he says that election must stand not of what are you reading not of works but of him that do what so it doesn't matter what you want to work or how much you want to do stuff verse verse 12. he will say the unto her the Elder Shall Serve the when before they were even born amen so what can you do to help Esau if you understand these things you will take your hand off your life and you will stop having high blood pressure amen verse 13 as it is written Jacob Heather but he so ever what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God humanly speaking you will say that's partiality the Bible say God forbid in other words the harsh you can't say that everybody okay verse 15 for he said to Moses I will have on whom I will have and I will have compassion on whom I will have so then it is not of him that nor of him but of God that showeth water what can you do [Music] amen what can you do jump now to verse 22 so you're going to see who is Mercy what if God willing to show his water he's wrath and to make his power known endureth with much long suffering the vessels of what fit into water in other words this vessel is a human being you know vessels we already talked about it's a human being so there is somebody that is prepared but he's programmed for rough am I reading a different Bible the Bible say he was a vessel of Wrath which was faded for Destruction so they made him to destroy him everybody okay everybody okay okay that's the vessels of Wrath and verse 23 that he might make known the water The Witches of his on the vessels of water so why Mercy come to you because you are because you are a vessel of Mercy just the way you are you are the vessel of Mercy in other words if you are not a vessel of Mercy you will not have mercy Mercy The Vessel of Mercy which he had what do you know what a four means a four prepare unto what so a vessel of Mercy is a vessel that was prepared Before Time for Glory so do you need to manufacture Your Glory there is something in you that will produce Glory if you learn to just obey God that's why I told you if you're doing something wrong take it remove it that's all you have to do and that's it amen Jesus Christ he said verse 24 even as whom he has called not of the Jews on me but also of the water of the Gentile and he said also in Hosea I will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved it's a woman so Mercy is a woman I'm gonna call that woman her beloved which was not what because we were Gentile but he's going to take a Brad from The Gentile amen and he shall come to pass when that happened that in the place where he would say unto them which is a people in the brand ye are not my people because we were not Jews they shall they there shall they call the children of the living what else can you do amen what else can you do I could have tell you more than this but I'm gonna stop because you're already tired you need to go home I know I know what I'm trying to say but it will set somebody free amen maybe Lord willing one day you will understand that amen if you understand the power of this thing I'm gonna say it in in in in a very close sentence so you understand the Publican prayed when he finished praying that he has a vision did he had a vision did the priest come and lay hand on him did the priest came and tell him that now your sins are forgiven did the priest come and say you know what my son everything is okay God heard your prayer who justify him who told him you were Justified okay I'm going to give you the second one so you meditate the woman in the world Jesus look at her he said this is your problem and the woman look he say I perceived that you are a prophet I know when the Messiah come of Jesus say you know what I am that prophet she was a prostitute who cast the devil out of here did somebody pray for her did Jesus pray for her did Jesus told her that my daughter now you are delivered from now on your life is going to change [Music] [Applause] she was dealing with Jesus we expected Jesus to say now that you recognize move forward come here let me lay hands on Luke now my daughter you demon that have trouble here all the day of her life now come out of her I commend you come out [Music] did Jesus do that the woman left so who delivered the woman how did they tell me what mechanism we removed the devil huh you complicate your Christian Life for nothing for nothing for nothing your Christian Life instead of being joyful in your life you are making your life a mess because you want to go fasting praying the Lord will talk to you you saw an angel she didn't see an angel it is as simple as that brother brand I'm saying she took her water pot and she dropped it out but I'm called that a denomination she just drop it and that was it and she turned around she said behold come let me show you who taught her to testify did somebody say now that you are changed you need to start winning souls go testify on the street who told her to testify do you understand what I'm saying I was trying to explain it to you but you're tired some of you are already sitting down so let's stand and pray and you will learn it later you're the one giving me signal everybody okay maybe one day we will sit even in a house meeting and we will open it and you will see what it is Deliverance is very easy because you don't understand God amen you do not understand God amen that's why you see people suffering crying and today you cry tomorrow you cry today you cry tomorrow you cry today you cry the more you cry today you cry and I thought somebody I say when you bring your your your past sin back to your remembrance you are insulting God I will explain you that one day don't worry I will explain you that don't worry don't worry I will explain you that one day you will see what you're doing to God you will understand that one day yeah you will understand that yeah because you wanna you wanna come to God making yourself so big so nice and pitiful you don't understand that you do not understand that Deliverance is easy sometimes we will pray and cast that devil sometimes there are things that you need to let go amen when you let go don't worry about what was troubling you that's the problem the problem is you let go something you go back and you pick it up and you bring the spirit back again on you and when he comes back it's going to come back double or maybe seven times you you pick the high heel off you take it off and you go you put it back up now it's going to be hard again to deal with you because you don't understand when they say take it off Jesus didn't say now that I spoke to you what you need to do separate yourself from that husband mm-hmm so what what was teaching that woman everything why is the shout telling somebody walk up and clean up the vessels and check the oil it's a package everybody okay it's just a package let things go you will be okay don't bring demon on you by trying to be famous in in in compassions so everybody will have compassion on your mercy the rabbi on the back stop it stop bringing demon on you everybody okay stop playing that pitiful stuffing and then the people will come and then you know everything is good you everything will be okay you you are pampering demon

do you see is that there and you go in the treadmill the brother preached a simple message powerful the man didn't say Lord you know how fasted he just said you know when you send Moses and Moses came and he brought the Tabernacle and he brought the boys did you hear me saying that be merciful that was it that's the prayer what is the complication in that prayer that's why you heard Jesus say people think by multiplying their words they're gonna be heard Pentecostal stuff let's pray and you get lost God is not complicated it's God Who hide and reveal himself in Simplicity do what God tells you to do obey the word of God pray keep moving God will take care of it amen your deliverance in the hand of God your blessings in the hand of God that work that you need in the hand of God that healing in the hand of God everything you need of in the hand of God if a sinner can sit down and put his hand and say Lord have mercy on me how much more if I am a vessel of Mercy you tell Jesus you say you don't see me don't you see Mercy when you see my face you don't see mercy so why should I even beg for it my name is Mercy I'm coming because my name is Mercy Mercy Seat I said and that blood
