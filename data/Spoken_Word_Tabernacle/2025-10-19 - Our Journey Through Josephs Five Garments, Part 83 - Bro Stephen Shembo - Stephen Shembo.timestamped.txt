[0:00] you won't mind if he goes he said would
[0:03] you don't mean to tell me you got low
[0:05] enough down do you have to carry a
[0:06] preacher with you wherever you go and so
[0:10] he said well I said and I thought about
[0:12] time me get out
[0:15] I got out of the car and walked around
[0:18] the side and I said how do you do and
[0:21] Mr. Wood was going to introduce me
[0:23] before he had time to do it and all
[0:26] whiskers two weeks long and squirrel
[0:28] blooded stank like a pcat. So I I
[0:32] started around there and I said, "How do
[0:34] you do, sir?"
[0:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "And you're a preacher." I
[0:38] said, "Well,
[0:39] &gt;&gt; I'd like to be." And he said, "Well, I
[0:43] just, you know," he said, "I'm supposed
[0:45] to be an infidel."
[0:48] I said, "Not much to brag about, is it,
[0:51] sir?" He said, he said, "No, I reckon
[0:54] it's not." He said, "It's just one thing
[0:59] that I got against you fellas." And I
[1:01] said, "Yes, sir. It's just one thing
[1:03] that you're pretty good shape."
[1:07] Some of them I met
[1:10] I got a lot of Christians that supposed
[1:11] to be got more than that against me.
[1:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14] &gt;&gt; I said I said well that's that's pretty
[1:18] good. He said what I got against you
[1:21] guys is this. You're always hollering
[1:24] about something that you know nothing
[1:26] about.
[1:28] I said for instance what sir? And he
[1:31] said you're talking about God and there
[1:34] is no such a thing. Oh, I said, "That's
[1:38] what it is." He said, "Yeah, that's it."
[1:41] Oh, Lord, you help me.
[1:44] Now, there are just two ways to approach
[1:47] anything, my brethren.
[1:49] That's the right way and the wrong way.
[1:53] &gt;&gt; I think, may I stop here a moment in my
[1:55] story and say, I think that's what's the
[1:57] matter with me and many of us, brethren.
[2:00] We got a great product here, but we're
[2:04] approaching the public wrong with it too
[2:06] much.
[2:07] &gt;&gt; Making us isolationist.
[2:12] &gt;&gt; It'll sell itself.
[2:16] &gt;&gt; Just live. You're the salt of the earth.
[2:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.
[2:20] &gt;&gt; And salt, as long as the savior's in the
[2:23] salt, it'll save if it contacts. But if
[2:26] it's lost its savior, no matter how loud
[2:28] we shout down here and how much we jump
[2:30] up and down, there's got to be a life
[2:32] out here that backs fed up.
[2:36] &gt;&gt; So I looked at the old gentleman and I
[2:38] thought, Lord, poor old fella hammer
[2:40] around on these old clouds here. My
[2:43] daddy would live that about that age.
[2:46] Now there's just a little something here
[2:48] that you could help me to say. No doubt
[2:50] that it helped the old fella to see. And
[2:53] I've seen many that call themselves
[2:55] infidels. And I've stood by some of them
[2:57] when they were going. They're not
[2:58] infidels. They're just popping off. And
[3:01] so that's a street expression, but
[3:03] that's way you'll understand it. Popping
[3:06] off and uh letting off steam.
[3:12] And I said, "Well, it's
[3:14] of course I said that's the pinion, of
[3:16] course." And we stood there a moment and
[3:19] we were sitting under an apple tree. He
[3:22] said, "I've been to them meetings and
[3:25] they're just like a lion dog."
[3:29] He said, "I used to have an old lion dog
[3:30] and I shot him." He said, "I'd follow
[3:33] him every night, take him out here, and
[3:35] he'd be barking and go up there and he's
[3:37] supposed to be a dog." And said,
[3:39] "The would be up the tree." And
[3:42] said, "Then the first thing you know,
[3:43] he'd be barking up this tree like that
[3:44] and I go around there and shine the
[3:46] light all up. The had done went out
[3:48] through the top."
[3:50] I said, "But sir, after all, the
[3:53] was there.
[3:57] It's just a dog."
[4:00] I hope he got what I meant. I'm sure you
[4:02] do. So, he said, "Um, so I shot him."
[4:06] And he said, "Uh, I don't I don't like
[4:10] anything that'll lie. I think if a man
[4:12] talks, you already know what he's
[4:14] talking about." I said, "I certainly
[4:16] agree with you."
[4:18] He said, "There was one preacher that I
[4:21] heard that if I ever get to see the man,
[4:24] but I never heard him, but I heard of
[4:26] him. If I ever get to see the man, I'm
[4:29] going to hear him."
[4:31] And I said, "That's very nice." He said
[4:34] he come to a little place over here
[4:36] called Actton at the Methodist
[4:38] campground. And brother Woods looked at
[4:40] me and shut me.
[4:43] He said, "Old sister so and so up on the
[4:46] hill here. I forget her. Never call her
[4:48] sister. Miss somebody is about 65.
[4:52] Said she was dying with cancer in the
[4:54] stomach." And said she had doctors out
[4:57] of Louisville here and said they got a
[4:59] nice farm up there and said they could
[5:01] afford it. They took her up to
[5:03] Louisville for an operation that knew
[5:05] one bit of good. cut her open, sewed her
[5:06] up. Cancer done wrapped her all through.
[5:09] Said she gradually died here for several
[5:12] months. Said finally got to a place that
[5:14] she is so bad. And I, excuse me, my
[5:18] brother, sister said they I'm just going
[5:21] to express it the way he said it. She
[5:24] couldn't even get onto the bed pan. They
[5:25] could never put one under. They couldn't
[5:27] raise her that high. They had to use a
[5:28] draw sheet, rubber sheet, and a draw
[5:30] sheet. said wife and I went up there
[5:32] every morning and would change her wife
[5:34] change her bed and I'd help get the
[5:37] sheets out from under and so forth and
[5:39] said she just the doctor said just give
[5:41] her a little uh morphine or something to
[5:44] keep her as easy as possible until she
[5:46] died said she had about two weeks to
[5:48] live and he said um they come a preacher
[5:52] down here from Indiana and had over here
[5:55] at the Methodist campground he said this
[5:58] uh several hundreds of people gathered
[6:00] over there. They said, "Do you hear this
[6:02] preacher?" And he said, "Um, and that
[6:04] night said while he was preaching said
[6:07] her sister was sitting back there, which
[6:09] is Mrs. So and so it lives over here on
[6:11] another ridge." And said this preacher
[6:13] was supposed to have something another
[6:16] that he could uh uh tell the people
[6:19] about uh what they had done and why they
[6:22] were sick and all about that. and said
[6:25] I'd heard about it because of course I
[6:27] didn't believe such a radical thing is
[6:30] that and uh he said but however this
[6:33] woman that night was sitting in the
[6:35] meeting and while the minister was
[6:36] speaking he turns to this woman and her
[6:39] sitting in the back of the building and
[6:41] said when you left home tonight back
[6:44] there miss so and so said you picked up
[6:47] a little blue h or little handkerchief
[6:49] with a blue figure in the corner of it
[6:51] off of the dresser and you put it in
[6:53] your purse
[6:55] and said, "Uh, you're praying back there
[6:58] for your older sister who's dying by the
[7:01] name of so and so that lives over here
[7:03] on the hill." Said, "The Lord has heard
[7:06] your prayers. Now take this little
[7:08] handkerchief and lay it upon your sister
[7:12] and the cancer will leave her."
[7:16] was said about round close to midnight
[7:19] that night. I thought they had the
[7:21] Salvation Army on the hillside up there.
[7:25] All the screaming and hollering.
[7:28] I don't want to embarrass anybody,
[7:31] but that was Ben.
[7:35] Brother Ben, you know that familiar
[7:38] squall of an amen he gives out every
[7:40] night in the meeting down there that
[7:41] shakes the place. Brother Ben had took
[7:44] the woman up there her to her sister and
[7:47] had laid the handkip on her and Ben
[7:49] believed it. So he just started shouting
[7:51] before it happened. So he was just
[7:53] getting at it first. So brother Ben he
[7:56] said I thought the woman had died. Well
[7:59] said it was around midnight. So the next
[8:01] morning said the wife and I went up
[8:03] there and said you know what said that
[8:07] woman was up cooking her breakfast
[8:09] eating fried apple pie.
[8:12] How many of you rebels know what a fried
[8:15] apple pie is? Oh my, do I love them? I
[8:19] like them to put molasses on them. See,
[8:22] and I I I'm not a Methodist. I'm a
[8:25] Baptist. I like to baptize them with
[8:27] molasses, you know, put plenty of them,
[8:29] then eat them hot butter. And
[8:32] so then when uh she was eating these
[8:35] fried apple pies and said it really like
[8:38] to tuck wife and I off our feet and
[8:41] said,
[8:42] And if you don't believe that point is
[8:47] [Music]

[36:09] together Lord God Lord that the
[36:11] omnipotence meet Lord God and whatever
[36:13] we stand in need of Father we shall have
[36:15] Lord God. Father, we first pray, Lord
[36:18] God, for those, Lord, that are standing
[36:21] in perilous times, Lord, in situations,
[36:23] Father, that only you can touch, Lord
[36:25] God. And Father, I pray that you
[36:27] remember our precious sister Edie, Lord
[36:29] God, and her family, Lord. You know,
[36:33] how would we feel, Lord, if it was our
[36:35] mother, Lord? If it was our loved one,
[36:36] Lord, going through such a time, Lord,
[36:38] help us to truly put ourselves in that
[36:41] place, Lord God, and truly cry out for
[36:44] strength, Lord God. uh whatever your
[36:45] divine will and purpose desires to
[36:48] express, Lord God. Help us to tap into
[36:50] that channel, Lord God, that we might
[36:52] pray for our precious sister and her
[36:53] family, Lord God. And even so much the
[36:56] more, Lord, we pray for the Anderson
[36:58] family, Lord. We we see, Lord God, that
[37:01] our sister, Lord, she shouted a song of
[37:03] victory, Lord. And Lord, now, Father,
[37:07] she's going home to be with you, Jesus.
[37:10] Lord, I know that they are believers,
[37:12] Father, but we Lord, we long to be with
[37:15] one another, Father. And
[37:18] Lord, if that was my wife or the wives
[37:20] of any other brothers in here, Lord,
[37:22] that would that would just take a
[37:24] tremendous toll on us, Father. I you are
[37:26] the high priest that can fill our
[37:28] infirmities, Lord. And I I pray for
[37:30] comfort. I pray for strength. I pray for
[37:33] direction, Lord. I Lord, I don't know
[37:35] what's needed, Lord. I'm I'm I'm I'm
[37:37] limited in my abilities to pray, Lord,
[37:39] in such a manner. But I know, Father,
[37:41] that whatever they stand in need of,
[37:43] Father, you're able to supply, Father.
[37:47] Remember them, Lord, all thy grace and
[37:49] all thy mercy, Lord. Be merciful to
[37:52] them, Father. Lord, we thank you, Lord,
[37:54] for the birthdays, Lord God, for our
[37:56] precious brother Robert and our precious
[37:59] sister.
[38:01] Lord, I pray, heavenly father, that you
[38:02] allow them just to take a moment to
[38:04] themselves, Lord God, to see what you
[38:07] have done in their lives over this year,
[38:09] Father. How they've grown, Father. How
[38:11] they stood for your word, Father. How
[38:13] you've unfolded your mysteries to them,
[38:16] Father. And let them know that they
[38:18] stand before you, Lord God, spotless,
[38:20] Lord, and they are your sons and
[38:21] daughter that you will continue to
[38:22] perfect until that precious day, Lord
[38:24] God, we shall see you. Bless them, Lord,
[38:27] and guide them and keep them, Father, in
[38:29] all they say and do, Father. Let it be
[38:31] done in the word of the Lord. Father, I
[38:34] pray for the tithes and offerings, Lord
[38:36] God, that you use them for the
[38:37] furtherance of your kingdom, Father.
[38:38] Touch the hearts, Lord God, of your
[38:40] people that desired to give but could
[38:42] not, Lord, you know the situations,
[38:44] Father. And because you are teaching us
[38:46] such things as the season, Father, I
[38:48] pray, Lord, that the season come upon
[38:49] your children to where we can all give
[38:51] to the kingdom of God, Father. We
[38:53] continue to pray for the building, Lord
[38:55] God. and you know the erection thereof
[38:57] and what you're trying to do. Father, we
[38:59] just touch and agree. Father, knowing,
[39:01] Lord God, that it shall come to pass,
[39:02] Father, whatsoever we touch and agree
[39:04] on. Father, going to take three minutes
[39:06] of this service. Father, bless the
[39:08] pastor, Lord God. Bless each and
[39:09] everyone here, Father, that we can enter
[39:11] in in one mind and one accord, Father,
[39:13] and hear what your spirit has to say,
[39:15] Father. In Jesus Christ's precious name
[39:17] we pray. Amen.
[39:25] God bless. We got a quick testimony real
[39:27] quick.
[39:29] God bless you, Saints. I just have a
[39:31] quick testimony about something that
[39:33] happened to me yesterday. Um, so I was
[39:36] working and me and Lily have been
[39:39] wanting to get an air purification
[39:41] system in our HVAC system because we
[39:43] have bad allergies and dust problems
[39:46] living out in the country.
[39:47] So, um, it's about $400 to get this part
[39:51] through the company that I work for. Um,
[39:54] so I was planning on getting it this
[39:56] next upcoming week, next time I went to
[39:58] the shop. And so I called one of my
[40:01] co-workers yesterday. I was working. And
[40:05] uh, I told him about how I was wanting
[40:07] to get it and, you know, when I was
[40:09] going to get it and everything. And he
[40:11] was like, "Oh man, don't even worry
[40:12] about it." He was like, "I got one and
[40:14] I'm I'm not even going to have time to
[40:16] put it in my own house, so you can just
[40:17] have it for free." So that is wonderful
[40:20] how God is just mindful of the little
[40:22] things in our lives.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; I told you God already made a way.
[40:32] [Applause]

[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Not according to your intelligence,
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; according to the word of God and the
[1:09:43] message of the hour. Because the people
[1:09:45] don't come to hear you.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; they want to hear what God is saying.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Even in the counseling, they need to
[1:09:52] hear what God want to tell them.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; So, you need to make sure you are

[1:13:04] field
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; and where?
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; We don't know. According to them, maybe
[1:13:13] the dream he was seeing because they
[1:13:15] were going to the field. Maybe the field
[1:13:17] he saw was where they usually work with
[1:13:20] his brother.

[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And a sheath represented a person.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; You know the wave sheath.

[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; The wave she chief is Jesus Christ.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; A sheath represent a person.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; But a she is a bundle of wheat.

[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; It's a vision.
[1:18:20] The problem is where is that vision
[1:18:23] going to happen?
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Where
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; which place?
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Which country?
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; We don't know
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; so far. Job to verse 8. And his brethren
[1:18:40] said to him, "Shall you indeed reign
[1:18:43] over us?" So they understood something
[1:18:46] from the vision. or shall you indeed
[1:18:49] have dominion over us?
[1:18:52] And they hated him yet the more for his
[1:18:56] dreams plural
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; and for his words,
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; the vision, the dreams and the word
[1:19:04] caused problem.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Verse nine, and he dreamed yet another
[1:19:09] dream.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; And told it to his brethren, and say,
[1:19:14] behold, I have dreamed a dream. I have
[1:19:17] dreamed a dream more and behold the sun
[1:19:21] and the moon,
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; husband and wife, daddy and mommy.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; And the 11 stars, even the one who was
[1:19:31] not born yet.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Joseph was number 11.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; But Joseph say he's in the middle and
[1:19:42] they were 11 star. So there was a baby
[1:19:45] somewhere
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; in heaven in the zodiac.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; And the zodiac is a Bible.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; We already went through that.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; So there was a baby already there.
[1:19:57] Benjamin was there. BJ, you were there.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; So Benjamin already existed in eternity.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because Jacob at this point have
[1:20:13] only had only 11 children
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; and Joseph was already in the middle. So
[1:20:18] 11 minus one it's 10.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; So where is the other 11 star?
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; So you can read prophecy but you don't
[1:20:28] see.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; You are getting a superficial.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Even Jacob miss it.
[1:20:39] What got him upset is the sun and the
[1:20:42] moon. So he say me and your mother
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; are bowing down to you.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; You going too far with these things.
[1:20:50] [Laughter]
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; He said the sun and the moon and the 11
[1:21:01] stars did what?
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Made obeisance to me.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; In other words, bowing down to him.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where is this going to be
[1:21:08] fulfilled? We don't know. Verse 10. And
[1:21:10] he told it to his father and to his
[1:21:13] brethren. And his father rebuked him
[1:21:16] because he was there.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; And he was inside bowing. He didn't like
[1:21:20] the bowing.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; I'm your father. How should I bow down
[1:21:23] to you?
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So his father rebuked him.
[1:21:27] Amen.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; And said to him, "What is this dream
[1:21:31] that you have dreamed?" Did he cause the
[1:21:34] dream?
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; No. He said, "What is this dream that
[1:21:37] you have dreamed? Shall I
[1:21:40] and your mother who told you he was it
[1:21:43] was Rachel?"
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Because Rachel died
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; and Rachel was never in Egypt.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Is my Bible different than your Bible?
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; So who fulfilled this vision?
[1:22:04] Let me leave that alone.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Let's let's stay on the highway. Amen.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; He says, "And your mother and your
[1:22:11] brethren indeed come to bow down ourself
[1:22:15] to you to the water."
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; So we found out that there is there are
[1:22:20] vision concerning this boy here
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; called Joseph.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; But this vision are not just dream.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; They are not just vision.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; These vision have messages in them.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; I just gave you an example.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Benjamin was hidden there.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; If you look at this vision, it's talking
[1:22:45] about she and the field.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; But Egypt was there.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:51] [Applause]
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. If I tell you Egypt is there, you
[1:22:55] will say, "Brother Steven, how did you
[1:22:57] decode Egypt? It's not written Egypt
[1:23:00] there." No, Egypt was there.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; But Egypt was not visible.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; What I'm trying to draw this morning is
[1:23:09] does vision require a certain
[1:23:12] environment?
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Those visions. Amen.
[1:23:23] require a certain environment
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; or a certain place
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; or a certain country.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; A certain setting.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Say sister Sharon.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; With certain season. Amen.
[1:23:47] [Applause]
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; The season connected to that place,
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; connected to that country,
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; connected to that setting.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; For the vision to come to pass.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; In other words, that vision could not
[1:24:04] happen in Africa. No sir.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; No matter how much you pray in Africa.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; That vision could not happen in America.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; The vision was locked with an
[1:24:19] environment.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; The vision was connected with Egypt.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; And Egypt has its own season.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wow.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; And he required this environment and the
[1:24:42] season of the environment to bring the
[1:24:45] dream to come to pass.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Everybody okay?
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; But we talking about a Hebrew,
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; a Jew,
[1:24:58] an Israelite that receive instruction
[1:25:01] from God. divine uh vision for God and
[1:25:06] you trying to tell that Egypt that uh
[1:25:09] that Israelite that your vision is for
[1:25:13] Egypt
[1:25:17] the God of Israel
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; bringing a vision
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; and my vision the vision of my life
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; won't be fulfilled in Jerusalem
[1:25:33] Not in the promised land.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; It have to be fulfilled in Egypt.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Which Egypt to us represented the world,
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; not a Christian world,
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; a sinful word.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; I don't know about that interpretation.
[1:26:02] Amen.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; The field that I saw, it was me and my
[1:26:05] brother.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; We were together.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Me and my brother. So probably as we
[1:26:10] grow up, when daddy will die,
[1:26:13] I will be taking things in charge and I
[1:26:16] will be the king right here. We will
[1:26:19] make a little kingdom and you guys will
[1:26:21] bow down. Mama is right here. So mommy
[1:26:24] at a certain time will bow down.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; We are we together. Are we I'm I'm just
[1:26:30] warming the engine before we go there.
[1:26:31] Amen.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Job to verse 13.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; And Israel said to Joseph, "Do not your
[1:26:40] brethren feed the flock in shikim.
[1:26:44] Come, we went through this already. And
[1:26:46] I will send you to them." And he said to
[1:26:49] him, "Here I am." Wonderful boy. Verse
[1:26:53] 14. And he said to him, "Go, I pray you,
[1:26:57] see whether it be well with your
[1:26:59] brethren and well with the flocks,
[1:27:03] and bring me word again."
[1:27:07] Joseph was sent to return.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Little did he know it was his ticket.
[1:27:24] It was his flight.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; He thought he's going to go
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; and come back.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; That was it.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; He was not coming back.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; So this vision have this thing.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:27:43] Wow.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; This vision of people bowing down
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; and him reigning had this element locked
[1:27:52] in.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Because those element were necessary to
[1:28:00] activate.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; That's correct, brother. Amen.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Or to crank the vision on.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; So, Joseph in his mind, he said, "You
[1:28:10] know what? I'm going to go. I know she
[1:28:12] came. I'm going to arrive, see them, and
[1:28:14] then talk to them a little bit and come
[1:28:16] back. Amen.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; So God was preparing to take him without
[1:28:20] his will.
[1:28:24] [Applause]
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Because he was the only boy of his
[1:28:30] mother.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; There was no way his mother would have
[1:28:37] left him after all the years
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; that she have waited to have a baby for
[1:28:42] this boy to go to Egypt.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; So God has to permit Joseph to be
[1:28:48] kidnapped.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; What he thought was a going and coming
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; was only one way ticket.
[1:29:00] Jesus.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Verse 14, he says, "And he says to him,
[1:29:09] go, I pray you, see whether he be well
[1:29:12] with your brethren, and well with the
[1:29:14] flock, and bring me word again." So he
[1:29:17] sent him out to the valley of Hebron,
[1:29:20] and he came to what?
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; So we we probably see our brother Joseph
[1:29:25] going happy.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. singingh.
[1:29:30] Fly away. Oh, glory.
[1:29:33] Fly away. Amen.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Not knowing he's already flying.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; He's going there. Hallelujah. Maybe he's
[1:29:46] on the bush. Hallelujah. Glory. He get
[1:29:48] under the anointing. Oh, he say the
[1:29:50] presence of the Lord is right here.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. verse uh um 15. And a certain man
[1:30:00] found him, and behold, he was what?
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Wandering in the field.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; So, Joseph got lost.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. Right. Amen.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; He got so joyful and he got lost.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; He can't find his way. Amen.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Maybe he begin to pray, Lord God of
[1:30:19] Abraham,
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; father, Lord of Jacob,
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; please help me to find my way in the
[1:30:26] name of Jes I'm putting that today. In
[1:30:28] the name because Jesus name was not
[1:30:30] there revealed yet. Ah, in the name of
[1:30:33] Jehovah. Hallelujah.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Whatever you ask, believe that you
[1:30:39] receive it.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Father, you going to bring me to the
[1:30:42] right path.
[1:30:44] Are we together?
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Please help me. So we move.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Verse 15. And a certain man found him.
[1:30:51] And behold, he was wandering in the
[1:30:53] field. And the man asked him, saying,
[1:30:55] "What seek you?"
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I seek my brethren. Tell
[1:31:01] me, I pray where they feed their flock."
[1:31:05] And the men say, "They are departed from
[1:31:07] here." Oh, praise the Lord. You see, you
[1:31:09] see how God work.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; You see how God work. So God knew I will
[1:31:13] get lost
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; and he put a man that already seen my
[1:31:16] brother. Oh, thank you Jesus for
[1:31:18] answering my prayer. You see, God is
[1:31:21] with me. God is there.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; I just pray it happen.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, when I go home,
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell daddy the testimony.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Daddy, you know what? I have a testimony
[1:31:33] to give tonight. When we have church
[1:31:35] tonight,
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; I will give my testimony
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; that I was lost in the bush. Brothers
[1:31:42] and sister, Jesus is alive.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; I was lost in the bush of chicken. And
[1:31:49] then suddenly a stranger appeared to me
[1:31:53] and he knew the direction and he put me
[1:31:55] on the right and I found my brother. So
[1:31:59] tonight I have a testimony. That
[1:32:01] testimony is going to Egypt.
[1:32:07] [Applause]
[1:32:13] Are we together?
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; So here, Joseph sees God.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. That's
[1:32:20] right.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; He see the presence of God.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; The mercy of God.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. The on time God.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; A present help in the time of trouble.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; I was in trouble. God sent somebody.
[1:32:32] Amen.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Not just anybody, somebody who knows the
[1:32:35] the uh place.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Uh verse uh where are we at? Uh
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; 16.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Verse uh 16:17. And the men say, they
[1:32:52] are departed from here, for I heard them
[1:32:54] say, so he knows.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went
[1:33:00] after his brethren and did what?
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Found them in Doth.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Here they are. Judah,
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; is
[1:33:08] where were you at
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; up to this time? It's God
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; for Joseph.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Because God has been so good to him.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; I hope the testimony continues.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together?
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Verse 18.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; And when they saw him a far off, because
[1:33:34] he was having a coat of many colors,
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; which was showing the love of the
[1:33:39] father.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Above every brethren.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; And when they saw him a far off, even
[1:33:47] before he came near to them, they
[1:33:50] conspire against him.
[1:33:55] You see how we all responding?
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; So was this God or the devil
[1:34:04] [Music]
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; because of the danger God should have
[1:34:08] made him get lost and go back home.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Uh now it looks like God opened up a
[1:34:15] blessing and the blessing is putting him
[1:34:16] to a trouble.
[1:34:22] Amen.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; The problem was Egypt was calling.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; My God.
[1:34:29] [Applause]
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Egypt and the vision were communicating.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Egypt and the vision were talking.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together?

[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; When he came out of the pit, he looked.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "Who are you?"
[1:38:54] [Music]

[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; They pull him up and suddenly they turn
[1:39:09] him on the ground. Boom. Bam.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; In the back. Huh?
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; B him.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; They say quiet.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Judah.

[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Is Zabulon,
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; please don't leave me like this.
[1:39:30] My brother,

[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; He turned around and the man came. They
[1:39:52] say as agree.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Joseph say agree. What?
[1:39:59] He He's already like this. Agree. What?
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; I have to do this so you pick you up.

[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; He saw the man pulls the wallet
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; and Judah over there.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Are you serious, guys? Shut up.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; I don't know. Maybe Simeon
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; because he put Simeon in prison.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; You know the story.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; I don't know why. I'm just saying. So
[1:40:36] don't come after me after church. Maybe
[1:40:38] Simeon say we will see what happened to
[1:40:40] your dream. La.
[1:40:45] [Applause]
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; 30 pieces of silver.
[1:40:56] Thank you very much. So you saw me move
[1:40:59] on.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; But he was crushed.
[1:41:04] [Applause]
[1:41:06] [Music]
[1:41:08] [Applause]
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; I hope are we together. I mean I hope we
[1:41:12] are together. Yeah.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; In other words, the ministry of Jesus
[1:41:16] Christ was working on Joseph.
[1:41:19] [Music]
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; And God took him as a slave.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; As a captive.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; To fulfill his dream with that against
[1:41:33] his own will.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; Because if he was given a chance to
[1:41:37] pick,
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; he would not have gone to Egypt.
[1:41:42] Are we together?
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; So I can imagine the testimony all along
[1:41:49] toward Egypt.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; The devil is bad.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Maybe I didn't pray too much.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Maybe I was not consecrated enough.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; That's why this happened to me.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Maybe this. Maybe this. Maybe this.
[1:42:05] Amen.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Everybody knew his story. How his
[1:42:08] brother hated him. The devil enter into
[1:42:10] his brother and everything. We clear so
[1:42:13] far.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; So now let's go to Genesis 45.
[1:42:20] Ah, glory to God. Amen.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; I'm doing this to help you.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Cuz when we begin to soar, we soaring.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Genesis 45, if you dare, verse seven,
[1:42:33] you can say amen.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:36] cuz some of the stuff will ring to your
[1:42:38] ear. Verse 7, "And God," this is Joseph
[1:42:42] talking to his brother. They came, he
[1:42:45] says, verse 7, 45:7, "And God sent me
[1:42:51] before you to do what?
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Preserve you
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; a posterity in the earth and to save
[1:42:58] your life by a great what?"
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Deliverance.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; He's saying, "Who sent him?"
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:43:08] Now his understanding have changed.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; What was the devil years ago?
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; It's no longer the devil.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; Verse eight. So now he was not you.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; So he begin to remove the credential.
[1:43:33] That's right.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Off of off I mean from his brother
[1:43:38] because all along
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; he was telling people how his brother
[1:43:42] sold him.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; They my brother sent me to Egypt.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; But at this time he turned around he
[1:43:48] said you know what don't even get I mean
[1:43:51] I mean this this mother have nothing to
[1:43:53] do with you guys.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't even take credit because you
[1:43:58] will say, "No, no, no, no, no. Joseph,
[1:43:59] you see, we sent you to Egypt. That's
[1:44:01] why you are where you are." Don't take
[1:44:04] No, no. You didn't send me in good
[1:44:06] speed. You sent me with an evil heart.
[1:44:09] [Music]
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; But I got a news for you. It was God in
[1:44:14] that evil heart.
[1:44:17] [Music]
[1:44:17] [Applause]
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. If someone hates you,
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; just know who you are.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; If you are a child of God,
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; that hatred will turn into a good thing.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Don't even get upset toward them
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; because they are giving you gasoline
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; to move on to the right direction.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Verse seven, he says, but verse 8, so
[1:44:59] now it was not you that sent me here,
[1:45:02] but who?
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; And he removed all the credential from
[1:45:06] them.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; And he has made me a water,
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; a father to Pharaoh
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; and lord of all his house, and a ruler
[1:45:13] throughout water,
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; all the land of Egypt.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; So Joseph now begin to describe
[1:45:18] everything that I described to you as
[1:45:21] God. Amen.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Are we clear so far?
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Are we clear so far?
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; The vision requires that.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Jeremiah 24.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; If you dare, you can say amen.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; You're doing wonderful
[1:45:41] by God's grace so far. If you dare, you
[1:45:46] can say amen.
[1:45:49] I have to do this because things were
[1:45:52] presented a certain way in the message
[1:45:56] and it block people from moving.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Because of preachers.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; That's sad. That's it.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; And there's so much zeal.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; That's exact.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; And he left people illiterate.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Illiterate.
[1:46:18] Amen.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; He left the people in the low level
[1:46:23] [Applause]
[1:46:25] [Music]
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; and we have created our own religion.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; Something that brother Brham didn't say.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:46:45] friend. Verse 20 uh chapter 24
[1:46:50] stay back up. Chapter 24 verse one. If
[1:46:54] you there you can say amen.

[1:47:33] Nebuchadnezzar. Who went into captivity?
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Jeaniah.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; And who else?

[1:48:04] what? Jerusalem.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they were going to Babylon.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; And the one who did it was
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; And we already seen that Nebuchadnezzar
[1:48:18] was a servant of the Lord.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; As much as he looked bad.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; He was a servant of the Lord.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; So they carried him away to Babylon. was
[1:48:36] done by a king.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; A hidden king.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; The one that even God gave him a

[1:49:18] certain things especially when I deal
[1:49:20] with message believer. Keep your finger

[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; the heart of the president
[1:50:02] Say amen.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; The heart of the president,
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; every president, their heart,
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to help you up.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to help you up.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; The heart of the king.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Today there is only one king maybe in
[1:50:19] England, but our king I call president.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; The heart of the president.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; The king's heart is where? in the hand
[1:50:28] of the Lord.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; So the heart of the president is in the
[1:50:31] hand of who?
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; The Lord.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; He didn't say that president is is a is
[1:50:36] a sent.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; He didn't say that president is the seed
[1:50:41] of Abraham.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; All he says is the heart of the
[1:50:44] president
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; is in the hand of God.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; That's why God could harden Pharaoh.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. church. Are we
[1:50:57] together? Yes,
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; ma'am. Yes, ma'am.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Tony, sit back there and shoot a
[1:51:03] man from that corner.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; So, I need to hear fire coming up from
[1:51:07] this way. Amen. That's why God could
[1:51:10] harden the heart of Pharaoh and liberate
[1:51:13] the heart as he will.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; So, if you come and Pharaoh say no, God
[1:51:18] is the one turning it off
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; and God is the one turning that off.
[1:51:23] That's why don't seek the favor of men.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Seek the favor of God
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; because God is the one in control of
[1:51:32] everything.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; Don't beg any man. Beg God.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Worship God.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; Don't sugar anybody.
[1:51:45] [Music]
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Sugar body God. Worship him. Exalt him.
[1:51:51] Adore him. magnify him because he's the
[1:51:55] one that control everybody.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; He's controlling Donald Trump.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[1:52:03] [Applause]
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; The heart of Donald Trump is under the
[1:52:09] control of God.
[1:52:16] [Applause]
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Keep your seat belt. We just left off,
[1:52:19] my friend. Are we together?
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; You need to understand these things
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; because you see the devil everywhere.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; But today you need to change your eyes.
[1:52:33] [Music]
[1:52:33] [Applause]
[1:52:40] King's heart is where?
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; In the hand of the Lord.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; As what?
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; The rivers of water.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; He does what?
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; He turneth it whethersoever he will.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; So who's turning the king's heart?
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; The Lord.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; According to whose will?
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; God's will.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; The will of who?
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; The God.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; So God can turn the king left or right?
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; So when you see Nebuchadnezzar, who do
[1:53:04] you see?
[1:53:06] [Music]
[1:53:07] [Applause]
[1:53:09] Can you say amen?
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; When Nebuchadnezzar is carrying people
[1:53:13] to Israel, God say it's my servant.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; And you over there, you are praising
[1:53:21] Nebuchadnezzar. There is a big king.
[1:53:24] He's so mighty.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; He's so powerful.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; He's winning every battle he's going.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; It was not Nebuchadnezzar winning. It
[1:53:33] was not the strength of the calin. It
[1:53:36] was God who already established
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; that I'm going to make Nebuchadnezzar do
[1:53:41] this.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; We clear so far.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; We clear so far.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Because we're trying to understand when
[1:53:49] we say Nebuchadnezzar, the servant of
[1:53:52] the Lord. So the captivity of Israel was
[1:53:57] with a king
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; by the name of Nebuchadnezzar,
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; a hidden king and yet a servant of the
[1:54:04] Lord. Let's go to the book of Daniel.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Please give me my time.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; I'm reading my third scripture
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; and I'm just explaining the third
[1:54:20] scripture.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.

[1:54:24] you can say

[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; You need to balance how you living.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Because message believer are the most
[1:54:38] suffering and the suffering not because
[1:54:40] of the message,
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; because of the way the message was given
[1:54:44] to them.
[1:54:46] [Music]
[1:54:47] That's why I always encourage you, you
[1:54:50] yourself,
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; listen to brother Branam yourself, read
[1:54:53] brother Brham yourself so you will know
[1:54:56] the truth
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; and the truth will set you free.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; The disciple of Berea verify.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; That's why I love to put my quote here
[1:55:07] so me and you can read the same thing.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Daniel 1 chapter chapter 1 verse one. If
[1:55:14] you there you can say amen. Amen.

[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Your big prophet Daniel
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; work with Nebuchadnezzar.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; He even helped Nebuchadnezzar
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; understand dream
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; and God gave him the interpretation for
[1:55:36] Nebuchadnezzar.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together?

[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Let's go to chapter 6. We're moving
[1:56:54] pretty good.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Daniel chapter 6. We need to clear this
[1:56:58] thing up.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Daniel chapter 6.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Verse 25. If you there, you can say
[1:57:04] amen.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; Verse 25. Are you there?
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; This is King Das.

[1:57:58] Babylon.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; The God of Moses and the God of Joshua
[1:58:02] in Babylon. Because in Joshua the pillar
[1:58:06] of fire became a man.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; Both manifestation in Babylon.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.

[1:58:21] came from the lion's den to he said he
[1:58:24] did what? Wrote to all people and what
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; nations
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; and what languages
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; because you know through the image after
[1:58:30] the Babylonian the middle Persian came.

[1:59:12] Daniel.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; That's why major came to worship Jesus
[1:59:16] Christ because of Daniel.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Daniel preach in the gentile.

[1:59:26] living God. Kama and water
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; and steadfast forever.

[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; I hope you are learning something.
[2:16:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; In other words, God works not in the way
[2:16:13] you think.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; Uh let's push brother Brandham now.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; Listen brother Brandham keep on Jeremiah
[2:16:27] 24. Brother Brandham say now Jesus say
[2:16:31] in the word he said that if you do water
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; ask the father anything in my name
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; he shall water
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; I'll do it
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; but sometime when God performs something
[2:16:42] and does something that we ask for yet
[2:16:46] we don't it comes how
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; in unexpected way
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; come and sometime in what
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; in an unexpected place
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; come and where
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; at an unexpected time
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; unexpected way
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; unexpected place
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; Egypt Babylon
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; an unexpected time
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham say but God will answer
[2:17:11] in his own
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; way
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; if you just what
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; believe it
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham continue he says what
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; think of it
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; so sometime we think because what
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; we're 35
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; or what
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; or 40
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; or what
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; whatever you are
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; you are never too old
[2:17:26] [Applause]
[2:17:36] Because we give our own retirement
[2:17:39] ourselves.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; Who told you you retired?
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; When did Caleb retired?
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; When did Caleb retired?
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; Retirement means what?
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; Sit down and do nothing.
[2:17:57] That's what we have there.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; Because when we say retire and
[2:18:01] retirement, all of us are looking at
[2:18:03] going home and sit down. You wake up in
[2:18:05] the morning and drink coffee. You will
[2:18:07] do that for two weeks and you get tired
[2:18:09] and you become bored.
[2:18:13] [Applause]
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say you are what?
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; Never too old.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; You got the soul that got to leave how
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; forever. So just remember it's always
[2:18:26] water
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; that way.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; A God what type of God
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; unchangeable God
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; in water
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; in an unexpected time
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; and water
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; unexpected way
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; and water
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; in an unexpected place.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; Who would have expected God in Babylon?
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Brother Bradam say we have
[2:18:46] a what
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; an unusual subject tonight
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; and God is how
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; unusual.
[2:18:53] You who know God
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; because now you realize God was in
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; Abuchanza.
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; You realize God was in Sy.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; Unusual.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; Your God is what?
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; Unusual.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; Unusual. And he does what?
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; Unusual things.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; Not in his own way.
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; Not unusual to him. But in our way of
[2:19:15] what?
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; Thinking.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; It is not unusual to God. It is unusual
[2:19:22] to us
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; because of religion.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; And the way we were taught before.
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:19:33] [Applause]
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown. I'm saying now this is
[2:19:38] rather a what?
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; An unusual scene
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; and what?
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; An unusual test.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; But you know God is how
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; unusual.
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; God does things how?
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; In an unusual way.
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; And what?
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; In an unusual time.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; And what?
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; In an unusual place. And sometime to
[2:19:51] what?
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; Unusual people.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; So God is what?
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; Unusual.
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; He does the unexpected many times.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; I'm still dropping this down.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown continue. He said this is
[2:20:06] rather a what?
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; An unusual scripture.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; But you know God is how
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; unusual.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; And he does things how
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; in an unusual way.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; And so we can just expect what
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; the unusual
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; when we are dealing with what?
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:20:22] You didn't get me well.
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; I have repeated four codes
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; to show you four or three code to show
[2:20:28] you that God is unusual.
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; In other words, when you dealing with
[2:20:32] this God,
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; the God of this message,
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; this God here,
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; you need to open up your mind
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; because God is an unusual God.
[2:20:44] [Music]
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well.
[2:20:50] Hallelujah.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; In other words,
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; the way God operate,
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; it will be not working according to your
[2:20:59] thinking.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; So don't put God in a box.
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; Let him be God.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; If he come this way, it's God.
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; This way it's God. This way it's God.
[2:21:14] Even if he come this way,
[2:21:19] [Applause]
[2:21:23] Because God is unusual.
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; God woke on King Nebuchadnezzar.
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "That is where
[2:21:36] God
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; dwells."
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; He dwells where?
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; In the unusual.
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; When you see things funny,
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; be careful.
[2:21:45] Amen.
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; My brother betray me. Be careful.
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; It could be the beginning of your
[2:21:52] journey.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; It could be the beginning of your
[2:21:56] deliverance.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; It could be the beginning of your
[2:21:59] season.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; The beginning of a new start, but it
[2:22:03] happened in an unusual way,
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; in the way you didn't expect.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; But it's God.
[2:22:12] Amen.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; God knew
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; God knew all of us
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; that if he would have given us our own
[2:22:23] choice
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; in the churches that we were before
[2:22:27] spoken word, none of us would have left
[2:22:30] [Applause]
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; because we love the pastor so much. Our
[2:22:35] human love
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; became more than a divine love
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; until when the pastor was deviating. We
[2:22:43] were still there
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; being cooked like frogs,
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; slowly frying us.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; So God moved
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; in an unusual way and open up a demon
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; to reject the message so you can come
[2:23:00] out
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; from where you are. And when you came
[2:23:04] out, it was another season.
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; It was another church. It was another
[2:23:09] moving of the Holy Spirit. Look where
[2:23:12] you are today. He was God in an unusual
[2:23:16] way.
[2:23:22] [Music]
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; Joseph went to Egypt with a lot of
[2:23:28] tears.
[2:23:29] We left the church with a lot of regret,
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; a lot of tears. I never thought
[2:23:35] something like this will have happened.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; Ah, God said that is good because that's
[2:23:41] the only way I can get you where I want
[2:23:43] you to be.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; To gain you. It took a preacher to
[2:23:55] backslid
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; to gain you. It took a big preacher to
[2:24:01] backslid. So who are you?
[2:24:04] [Applause]
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; What is in you?
[2:24:08] [Applause]
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. God have to
[2:24:15] liquidate
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; a preacher just because of you.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; A well-known preacher because of you. So
[2:24:21] what is in you?
[2:24:23] [Applause]
[2:24:27] [Music]
[2:24:29] Are we together?
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; Many people are sitting in dead message
[2:24:34] churches because of human family ability
[2:24:39] because of family problem because of
[2:24:42] family connection and the children are
[2:24:45] dying and people are dying. That's why
[2:24:48] God put a fire
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; so you can make a decision.
[2:24:54] [Applause]
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; You who are still staying where your
[2:25:07] children are dying.
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; Every child in the church is already
[2:25:11] committing fornication and you still
[2:25:13] hanging on there because of old
[2:25:16] friendship. Your fire is coming.
[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; Your fire is coming. Put me online. Your
[2:25:23] fire is coming.
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; God is going to shake you.
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; What do you regret today?
[2:25:44] [Music]
[2:25:46] What do you regret today?
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; Did you see that at the beginning?
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; Because your God dwell in unusual.
[2:25:56] [Music]
[2:25:58] [Applause]
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; Now I'm sowing like an eagle, my friend.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm sowing now like an eagle
[2:26:12] because I know my God is an unusual God.
[2:26:16] So I must be expecting the unusual.
[2:26:20] When it's unusual, it is the territory
[2:26:23] of God.
[2:26:27] A virgin shall conceive. It's unusual.
[2:26:31] That's his territory.
[2:26:32] [Applause]

[2:30:15] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together."
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; Your wife will come in an unusual time.
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; In an unusual way
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; and it's God.
[2:30:26] [Applause]
[2:30:26] [Music]
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[2:30:34] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Jeremiah 24.
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; I'm reading my third scripture.
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; Then we start preaching.
[2:30:48] &gt;&gt; Are we there?
[2:30:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; You heard the head deacon say, "That's
[2:30:50] right."
[2:30:51] &gt;&gt; Let's go, my friend. The Lord showed me
[2:30:54] and behold what?
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; Two baskets of figs
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; were set before the temple of the Lord.
[2:30:59] After that who
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar
[2:31:01] &gt;&gt; who
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; king of Babylon
[2:31:03] &gt;&gt; had carried away away captive who
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; Jeaniah
[2:31:06] &gt;&gt; it's on the board the son of Jehoakim
[2:31:09] &gt;&gt; h king of Judah and the princes of who?
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; Judah
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; with the carpenter and the what?
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; And smiths
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; from Jerusalem and have brought them to
[2:31:17] what?
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; Babylon.
[2:31:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:19] &gt;&gt; These people are brought to Babylon.
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; And brother Steven, you just
[2:31:23] demonstrated that Babylon to Persia God
[2:31:26] was there. He was the beginning of the
[2:31:29] exile
[2:31:30] &gt;&gt; or the ex the the the the captivity all
[2:31:33] the way to the end of the captivity
[2:31:35] because he's alpha and omega.
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; So he hold the beginning and the end.
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[2:31:40] &gt;&gt; But the problem is he took them in
[2:31:43] Babylon.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; What does Babylon have to do with us
[2:31:47] today?
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:31:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together? In the book of
[2:31:53] Revelation 17, we went through this all
[2:31:57] along.
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; We found out that there was a woman,
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; you know this a wrong
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; that was sitting on the beast
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; and the beast have seven head.
[2:32:06] &gt;&gt; And the Bible say the seven head were
[2:32:08] the seven mountain.
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; We already went through this.
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that woman was called mystery
[2:32:15] what?
[2:32:16] &gt;&gt; Babylon.
[2:32:16] &gt;&gt; So Babylon exists today in the name of
[2:32:20] Rome.
[2:32:21] [Applause]
[2:32:23] [Music]
[2:32:26] I hope we are together.
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says in the message the
[2:32:30] second seal in paragraph 303 he says
[2:32:33] anybody knows that what
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; Babylon
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; is what? wrong
[2:32:41] &gt;&gt; because there is only one church that
[2:32:43] sits on seven hill
[2:32:44] &gt;&gt; and it's in the Vatican and that church
[2:32:46] is the Catholic church and a woman is a
[2:32:50] church
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; and he sat right there and she sat right
[2:32:53] there and she's called mystery what
[2:32:55] &gt;&gt; Babylon
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; so it's a Babylon in a mystery
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; and all the king of the world
[2:33:03] &gt;&gt; are drinking from her
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; but even though the king are drinking
[2:33:07] from there. The heart of the king is in
[2:33:11] the hand of God.
[2:33:12] &gt;&gt; In other words, God controlled the
[2:33:15] devil.
[2:33:16] [Applause]
[2:33:19] [Music]
[2:33:22] [Applause]
[2:33:22] [Music]
[2:33:26] Tell the devil that. Tell the devil you
[2:33:29] are controllable.
[2:33:34] &gt;&gt; Controllable my friend.
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; Tell the devil you are controllable.
[2:33:38] [Music]
[2:33:39] &gt;&gt; In French they say metric.
[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; You are controllable.
[2:33:44] [Music]
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? In
[2:33:50] other words, no matter what you do, how
[2:33:53] whatever you do, God is under control.
[2:33:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. We talking about
[2:33:59] Babylon. Brother Brandham says this in
[2:34:02] the sound of the town. He said he was
[2:34:04] also the great what?
[2:34:05] &gt;&gt; City
[2:34:06] &gt;&gt; of what?
[2:34:07] &gt;&gt; Had garden.
[2:34:07] &gt;&gt; The city of Babylon. Great garden all
[2:34:09] along. What?
[2:34:10] &gt;&gt; These walls
[2:34:11] &gt;&gt; and the palace set where?
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; In the center of the city.
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; And every street led straight to the
[2:34:16] palace.
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; That's how Babylon was built. So the
[2:34:20] city had the palace of the king in the
[2:34:22] center and every street goes straight
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; to the center. And for some reason Rome
[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; because you heard the saying say all
[2:34:34] street lead to Rome.
[2:34:35] &gt;&gt; It came from Babylon.
[2:34:37] &gt;&gt; So Rome duplicated Babylon.
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. Brother Brham
[2:34:45] said and and the palace set where
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; in the center of the city
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; and every street led what?
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; Straight to the palace.
[2:34:53] &gt;&gt; Rome is built the same way.
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; It was called by our babble what?
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; Modern Babylon.
[2:35:00] &gt;&gt; And all roads leads what?
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; To Rome.
[2:35:03] &gt;&gt; All street leads to what?
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; The palace.
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; Where did they get that architecture
[2:35:08] from?
[2:35:09] &gt;&gt; It came from Babylon. Amen.
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; And why did they choose to only rebuild
[2:35:14] everything like the city of Babylon?
[2:35:16] &gt;&gt; Because your modern Babylon today is
[2:35:19] Rome.
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:35:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this. He say there
[2:35:26] is only what?
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; One city
[2:35:28] &gt;&gt; that I know of in the world. There is
[2:35:30] actually what?
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; Two cities
[2:35:32] &gt;&gt; that I know of that have what?
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; Seven or more mountains in it.
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; It is what?
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; Cincinnati is one of them. which is
[2:35:38] supposed to be a fiction story of what?
[2:35:41] &gt;&gt; Cincinnati.
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; It's what?
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; The mother wolf.
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; Keep your seat belt, my friend. The
[2:35:48] mother wolf, you know that so forth. But
[2:35:51] he has what?
[2:35:53] &gt;&gt; More than that in it.
[2:35:55] &gt;&gt; When the prophet says something like
[2:35:57] this, you need to push the break because
[2:35:59] the prophet already gave you a door.
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; He just opened the door and he left the
[2:36:05] door. All the
[2:36:09] eyes,
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; the anointed eyes can enter into that
[2:36:14] door to see what more is inside of
[2:36:17] there.
[2:36:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:36:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:23] &gt;&gt; Because brother Brandham is saying the
[2:36:25] city of Cincinnati have seven hills
[2:36:29] &gt;&gt; and Rome has seven hills.
[2:36:32] &gt;&gt; And if you notice, Cincinnati is in the
[2:36:34] United States.
[2:36:41] Are we together?
[2:36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:42] &gt;&gt; So there was already a ground of Babylon
[2:36:48] &gt;&gt; in the United States
[2:36:51] &gt;&gt; naturally
[2:36:53] &gt;&gt; because according to Revelation 13, we
[2:36:56] see two beasts.
[2:36:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:00] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. There is a beast
[2:37:02] that come from the water which is Rome.
[2:37:06] But there is a beef that come like a
[2:37:08] buffalo. That is the United States. But
[2:37:11] he will speak like a dragon
[2:37:13] &gt;&gt; which is Rome.
[2:37:15] &gt;&gt; So Rome had already a ground in the
[2:37:18] United States.
[2:37:21] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:37:23] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. And the ground
[2:37:26] of Rome was in Cincinnati.
[2:37:29] And brother Brown say you know the story
[2:37:31] about what
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; mother.
[2:37:34] &gt;&gt; The mother wolf. Do you know what mother
[2:37:36] wolf means?
[2:37:38] &gt;&gt; Buckle up my friend.
[2:37:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; This is mother wolf.
[2:37:45] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Yes sir.
[2:37:51] &gt;&gt; This is mother wolf.
[2:37:54] &gt;&gt; He was put in Cincinnati.
[2:37:56] This mother wolf is a legend
[2:38:00] &gt;&gt; of the foundation of Rome.
[2:38:03] [Applause]
[2:38:07] &gt;&gt; I thought you guys study history.
[2:38:11] &gt;&gt; Rome was formed by Romeulus.
[2:38:13] &gt;&gt; Ramulus
[2:38:15] &gt;&gt; and Rome.
[2:38:16] &gt;&gt; It was two twin brother that made that
[2:38:19] laid the foundation of Rome.
[2:38:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:38:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And according to the legend, they
[2:38:26] were nursed by a wolf.
[2:38:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:38:33] &gt;&gt; So the emblem of Rome is a wolf
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; with two twins that are nursing from a
[2:38:40] wolf.
[2:38:46] &gt;&gt; Now you begin to understand what brother
[2:38:48] Brandham is saying. So for some reason
[2:38:50] if I'm not mistaken Moselini take this
[2:38:54] big statute
[2:38:55] &gt;&gt; and came and gave a gift
[2:38:58] &gt;&gt; not to anywhere only to the state of
[2:39:01] Cincinnati
[2:39:05] &gt;&gt; only to the city of Cincinnati and they
[2:39:08] went in Cincinnati and they put the very
[2:39:11] emblem
[2:39:12] &gt;&gt; of Rome in Cincinnati. Why?
[2:39:20] I hope now you understanding.
[2:39:22] &gt;&gt; And when brother comes, brother say,
[2:39:25] "Look at that city have seven hills
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; just like the Vatican
[2:39:31] &gt;&gt; to show the connection between the two
[2:39:34] &gt;&gt; that the beast is already here
[2:39:36] &gt;&gt; and Donald Trump wore the clothing of a
[2:39:40] pope.
[2:39:41] [Applause]
[2:39:43] [Music]
[2:39:43] [Applause]
[2:39:46] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together." Amen.
[2:39:47] &gt;&gt; I hope I'm going through a trembling
[2:39:49] gun. Amen. And and few days after he did
[2:39:53] that, an American pop up
[2:39:56] &gt;&gt; for the first time.
[2:40:00] [Applause]
[2:40:04] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:40:05] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:40:07] &gt;&gt; I hope you are together.
[2:40:09] &gt;&gt; And in the midst of all that, you are
[2:40:11] there.
[2:40:12] &gt;&gt; So we also are found in Babylon.
[2:40:21] [Applause]
[2:40:22] I hope we are together.
[2:40:24] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:40:26] &gt;&gt; The pope is an American. So, American
[2:40:29] Rome have united. The two beasts has now
[2:40:32] reunited. Now they are one.
[2:40:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So we are in modern
[2:40:38] Rome now
[2:40:40] &gt;&gt; because the Roman is already in America
[2:40:43] dominating this entire world and God
[2:40:46] took you captive
[2:40:48] &gt;&gt; in the midst of Rome.
[2:40:51] [Applause]
[2:40:54] [Music]
[2:40:58] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:40:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. God took you and me and placed us
[2:41:02] in the midst of Babylon
[2:41:05] &gt;&gt; with a major prophet,
[2:41:07] &gt;&gt; a Jeremiah model.
[2:41:12] [Applause]
[2:41:16] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:41:18] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:41:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:41:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:22] &gt;&gt; Listen to this my friend. Brother
[2:41:24] Brandham said, "Don't you remember how
[2:41:26] who
[2:41:26] &gt;&gt; that Nimrod,
[2:41:28] &gt;&gt; their hypocrite built water,
[2:41:30] &gt;&gt; this big tower
[2:41:31] &gt;&gt; and made water?
[2:41:32] &gt;&gt; All the other little cities pay tribute
[2:41:34] to it.
[2:41:34] &gt;&gt; Babel and Babel is what?
[2:41:36] &gt;&gt; The same thing.
[2:41:37] &gt;&gt; It's just changing what
[2:41:39] &gt;&gt; it name
[2:41:39] &gt;&gt; and as it's on as it's coming on up.
[2:41:42] It's Rome now is what?
[2:41:45] &gt;&gt; Babylon.
[2:41:45] &gt;&gt; And the whole world is brought to what?
[2:41:48] &gt;&gt; To Babylon.
[2:41:49] &gt;&gt; And it's brought in by what? the world
[2:41:51] council of churches
[2:41:52] &gt;&gt; which sh which will make every one of
[2:41:55] them to do what?
[2:41:56] &gt;&gt; Bow to her.
[2:41:56] &gt;&gt; So God pick you and me
[2:41:59] &gt;&gt; and put us in the age where Rome
[2:42:03] &gt;&gt; is dominating where Babylon
[2:42:07] [Applause]
[2:42:08] &gt;&gt; is dominating the world
[2:42:10] &gt;&gt; and we find ourselves trapped
[2:42:15] &gt;&gt; captive
[2:42:17] &gt;&gt; without our own will. We are finding
[2:42:20] ourself in the midst of Babylon.
[2:42:22] &gt;&gt; But remember, the one who brought you
[2:42:24] here is God.
[2:42:29] &gt;&gt; The one who put you in this age is God.
[2:42:32] &gt;&gt; The one who put you in this time is God.
[2:42:36] &gt;&gt; So God will start and God will finish.
[2:42:41] [Music]
[2:42:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:42:44] &gt;&gt; And in the age of God say I am the amen.
[2:42:49] So he's the one finishing the problem.
[2:42:55] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:42:57] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. So brother
[2:42:59] Stephven in the midst of Babylon God is
[2:43:02] there.
[2:43:03] &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. In the book of Psalm
[2:43:06] 3139
[2:43:08] verse 8 the Bible says what?
[2:43:10] &gt;&gt; If I ascend up into heaven
[2:43:12] &gt;&gt; this is David. He say what
[2:43:13] &gt;&gt; thou art there.
[2:43:14] &gt;&gt; How many believe that God is in heaven?
[2:43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. David say if I go to heaven he
[2:43:19] said God is there everybody of us will
[2:43:22] say amen.
[2:43:23] &gt;&gt; David didn't finish.
[2:43:25] &gt;&gt; David says that if I make my bed where
[2:43:28] &gt;&gt; in hell
[2:43:29] &gt;&gt; he said behold what
[2:43:30] &gt;&gt; thou art there.
[2:43:33] [Music]
[2:43:34] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:43:36] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham say heaven is
[2:43:38] already on earth.
[2:43:40] &gt;&gt; So if we make our bed in her so where is
[2:43:43] God?
[2:43:47] You are not alone. Someone is here.
[2:43:57] &gt;&gt; Because he say I shall not leave you
[2:44:00] &gt;&gt; nor forsake you. I will be with you all
[2:44:03] the way to the end.
[2:44:07] &gt;&gt; The problem is the way you are looking
[2:44:09] at God.
[2:44:12] Amen.
[2:44:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:44:16] &gt;&gt; How do you see God?
[2:44:19] &gt;&gt; When they say God, you only see God like
[2:44:22] this.
[2:44:22] &gt;&gt; But I just show you God in
[2:44:24] Nebuchadnezzar.
[2:44:25] &gt;&gt; I show you God in Cy.
[2:44:27] &gt;&gt; I show you God in the hatred of Joseph.
[2:44:32] [Applause]
[2:44:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says this, my friend,
[2:44:36] there was something in me, something
[2:44:38] down way
[2:44:39] &gt;&gt; in me
[2:44:40] &gt;&gt; that did what? couldn't hold my peace.
[2:44:42] &gt;&gt; I could see God where
[2:44:43] &gt;&gt; in the rainbow
[2:44:44] &gt;&gt; I could see God where
[2:44:46] &gt;&gt; in the sunset
[2:44:47] &gt;&gt; I could hear God where
[2:44:48] &gt;&gt; calling through the wolf.
[2:44:50] &gt;&gt; Even a wolf, brother Brandham sees God.
[2:44:53] [Applause]
[2:44:57] &gt;&gt; I know it's hard to swallow, my friend.
[2:44:59] &gt;&gt; It's spicy. Let's continue. He said, "I
[2:45:02] could heal God."
[2:45:03] &gt;&gt; Calling everywhere.
[2:45:04] &gt;&gt; If you get God way
[2:45:06] &gt;&gt; on the inside,
[2:45:07] &gt;&gt; you shall see God where
[2:45:08] &gt;&gt; anywhere you look.
[2:45:11] That's right.
[2:45:12] &gt;&gt; He come to the water
[2:45:13] &gt;&gt; in here first.
[2:45:15] &gt;&gt; In other words, we need to anoint our
[2:45:17] eyes.
[2:45:19] [Music]
[2:45:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:23] &gt;&gt; Listen to this, my friend. Brother
[2:45:25] Brandham says, "And you know God is
[2:45:28] what?
[2:45:28] &gt;&gt; Just so everywhere.
[2:45:30] &gt;&gt; You can see him where?
[2:45:31] &gt;&gt; If you'll just get him on the inside of
[2:45:33] you.
[2:45:33] &gt;&gt; If you just get God where?
[2:45:35] &gt;&gt; On the inside of you. That is what makes
[2:45:37] it so hard for people to see and
[2:45:40] understand God because he's not where
[2:45:43] &gt;&gt; in their heart.
[2:45:44] &gt;&gt; If God is where
[2:45:46] &gt;&gt; in the heart
[2:45:47] &gt;&gt; he shows you he shows you what
[2:45:49] &gt;&gt; himself to you.
[2:45:50] &gt;&gt; And I seen the sunset and there was God
[2:45:52] where
[2:45:53] &gt;&gt; in the sunset
[2:45:54] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to tell you God is in this
[2:45:57] Babylon.
[2:46:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:46:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Listen to brother
[2:46:06] Brandham. Are we together?
[2:46:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:46:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this. We read
[2:46:11] this. Brother Brham say we are facing
[2:46:14] talking about Isaiah 60. He said we are
[2:46:16] facing here in in our two subject that
[2:46:18] we read the water.
[2:46:20] &gt;&gt; The two scriptures
[2:46:20] &gt;&gt; rather a very water
[2:46:22] &gt;&gt; contrast one to the other.
[2:46:23] &gt;&gt; In Isaiah he says what?
[2:46:25] &gt;&gt; Arise and shine
[2:46:26] &gt;&gt; for water.
[2:46:27] &gt;&gt; The glory of God has come upon you.
[2:46:29] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:46:29] &gt;&gt; The light is here.
[2:46:30] &gt;&gt; And the next verse he says what?
[2:46:32] &gt;&gt; Gross darkness is upon the people.
[2:46:34] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And then when we see when we are
[2:46:37] in the midst of what
[2:46:38] &gt;&gt; of light and darkness
[2:46:40] &gt;&gt; and then my address to the church is
[2:46:43] what?
[2:46:43] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[2:46:44] &gt;&gt; In other words, my message to you who
[2:46:46] are in Babylon
[2:46:48] &gt;&gt; today brother say shalom.
[2:46:50] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[2:46:54] &gt;&gt; Shalom means what?
[2:46:55] &gt;&gt; Peace.
[2:46:56] &gt;&gt; In other words, don't be troubled.
[2:46:58] Whatever the pop is doing, whatever the
[2:47:01] president is doing, whatever is going on
[2:47:04] on all the earth, shalom.
[2:47:07] &gt;&gt; Why shalom? The master is here.
[2:47:10] &gt;&gt; The master of the wind is here.
[2:47:13] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[2:47:15] &gt;&gt; God didn't put you in trouble.
[2:47:20] &gt;&gt; Listen, my friend. He says, "Let's find
[2:47:22] out all all about. Let's find found find
[2:47:26] out what it is all about. We are facing
[2:47:29] water
[2:47:29] &gt;&gt; this year
[2:47:30] &gt;&gt; with water.
[2:47:30] &gt;&gt; Both darkness and light.
[2:47:32] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And the world is one of the
[2:47:34] water.
[2:47:34] &gt;&gt; The most chaotic times of darkness that
[2:47:36] it's ever stood in.
[2:47:37] &gt;&gt; And yet it's standing in against the
[2:47:40] water.
[2:47:41] &gt;&gt; The most blessed light that it ever did.
[2:47:43] &gt;&gt; It depends on where you see.
[2:47:47] &gt;&gt; It depends on your understanding, your
[2:47:50] interpretation,
[2:47:52] your revelation.
[2:47:55] I hope we are together.

[2:51:56] &gt;&gt; In other words, bad fig.
[2:51:59] &gt;&gt; They were water. So bad.
[2:52:01] &gt;&gt; So there is two baskets here with fig.

[2:52:06] &gt;&gt; So we need to know who are this basket?

[2:52:53] &gt;&gt; Captive of Judah.
[2:52:55] whom
[2:52:56] &gt;&gt; I have sent out of this place into the
[2:52:58] land of the cowines for their good.
[2:53:00] &gt;&gt; Who sent them?
[2:53:01] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:53:05] &gt;&gt; Who sent them captive?
[2:53:06] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:53:07] &gt;&gt; Yeshua.
[2:53:08] &gt;&gt; So God is sending somebody captive.
[2:53:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[2:53:14] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:53:15] &gt;&gt; To Babylon.
[2:53:17] &gt;&gt; And God say I send the good fig,
[2:53:19] &gt;&gt; the very good one
[2:53:21] &gt;&gt; to Babylon
[2:53:22] &gt;&gt; captive. In other words, I sent the
[2:53:24] elite.
[2:53:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:53:27] [Applause]
[2:53:28] &gt;&gt; I didn't send any type of fig.
[2:53:31] &gt;&gt; The elite.
[2:53:33] [Applause]
[2:53:34] &gt;&gt; There was a basket. In that basket there
[2:53:37] were figs.
[2:53:39] &gt;&gt; Very good figs.
[2:53:40] &gt;&gt; And he took those figs and he sent them.
[2:53:43] He shipped them to Babylon for a
[2:53:45] mission.
[2:53:46] &gt;&gt; Ezra in Babylon. Nemiah in Babylon.
[2:53:50] Daniel in Babylon. Ezekiel in Babylon,
[2:53:54] Shadrach in Babylon, Mach in Babylon. So
[2:53:57] when you try, that's why Nebuchadnezzar
[2:54:00] have to all the most mighty men.
[2:54:04] &gt;&gt; Because of the caliber of those that
[2:54:07] goes in Babylon.
[2:54:10] &gt;&gt; Babylon is a ground of the devil.
[2:54:13] &gt;&gt; It is Satan Eden. You don't send just
[2:54:16] anybody in the ground of the devil. You
[2:54:19] need to send the special force.
[2:54:22] The force that knows how to camouflage
[2:54:25] and make things happen.
[2:54:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:54:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:54:33] &gt;&gt; You don't send anybody in Babylon. You
[2:54:35] need to evaluate them.
[2:54:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together? What are you doing in
[2:54:43] this Babylon? And who are you? And why
[2:54:47] has you been sent in the most darkest
[2:54:50] age?
[2:54:51] &gt;&gt; What is in you?
[2:54:53] &gt;&gt; What is God waiting for you?
[2:54:56] &gt;&gt; What is God counting on you for?
[2:54:59] [Applause]
[2:55:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:55:04] &gt;&gt; Let's go, my friend. Where are we at?
[2:55:06] &gt;&gt; Verse six.
[2:55:07] &gt;&gt; Verse six. For I will do what?
[2:55:09] &gt;&gt; Set mine eyes upon them for good.
[2:55:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:55:14] M
[2:55:15] &gt;&gt; those that went to Babylon,
[2:55:18] &gt;&gt; God will set his eyes upon them for
[2:55:20] what?
[2:55:20] &gt;&gt; Good.
[2:55:22] &gt;&gt; So going to Babylon, you going with a
[2:55:24] favor.
[2:55:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:55:27] &gt;&gt; Let's continue. Come on. And I will do
[2:55:29] what?
[2:55:30] &gt;&gt; Bring them again to this land.
[2:55:32] &gt;&gt; So whoever goes to Babylon,
[2:55:36] &gt;&gt; have a have a tag.
[2:55:40] &gt;&gt; It's a round trip. Right?
[2:55:42] &gt;&gt; When you go, you will come back.
[2:55:46] &gt;&gt; In other words, you will return home.
[2:55:49] &gt;&gt; So, you are guaranteed not to stay
[2:55:51] there.
[2:55:52] &gt;&gt; But you have a mission
[2:55:54] &gt;&gt; and your mission must be fulfilled in
[2:55:56] Babylon
[2:55:57] &gt;&gt; in the midst of the devil.
[2:56:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:56:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:56:04] &gt;&gt; Let's continue, my friend. And I will
[2:56:06] bring them again to this land. And I
[2:56:08] will do what?
[2:56:08] &gt;&gt; I will build them.
[2:56:09] &gt;&gt; And what? and not pull them down.
[2:56:11] &gt;&gt; And I will do what?
[2:56:12] &gt;&gt; I will plant them.
[2:56:13] &gt;&gt; And not water.
[2:56:14] &gt;&gt; And not pluck them up.
[2:56:15] &gt;&gt; And I will give them a heart to know me.
[2:56:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:56:19] &gt;&gt; That I am who?
[2:56:20] &gt;&gt; The Lord.
[2:56:20] &gt;&gt; That they shall be what?
[2:56:22] &gt;&gt; My people.
[2:56:22] &gt;&gt; And I will be who?
[2:56:23] &gt;&gt; Their God.
[2:56:24] &gt;&gt; Then therefore they shall return to me
[2:56:26] with their water.
[2:56:27] &gt;&gt; Whole heart.
[2:56:28] &gt;&gt; So when you go into Babylon, Yes sir.
[2:56:31] &gt;&gt; When you are returning to Babylon from
[2:56:34] Babylon, how are you returning
[2:56:36] spiritually?
[2:56:38] You are returning spiritually better
[2:56:41] &gt;&gt; than the way you came in.
[2:56:46] &gt;&gt; Some of you didn't get it.
[2:56:48] &gt;&gt; The way you came in this world, you came
[2:56:52] shaping iniquity.
[2:56:54] &gt;&gt; Coming in this word speaking lies. But
[2:56:56] the way we are going back,
[2:56:59] &gt;&gt; we're not going the same.
[2:57:00] &gt;&gt; We are going in the glorified state.
[2:57:08] In other words,
[2:57:10] &gt;&gt; in other word, Babylon is our developing
[2:57:15] ground.
[2:57:16] [Music]
[2:57:19] &gt;&gt; Everything that happened in Babylon is
[2:57:22] only meant to bring me out.
[2:57:25] [Music]
[2:57:30] &gt;&gt; My friend,
[2:57:31] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to head to the airport,
[2:57:34] &gt;&gt; brother. Adam say being what?
[2:57:36] &gt;&gt; Eternal with him.
[2:57:38] &gt;&gt; The beginning
[2:57:38] &gt;&gt; the eternal life that you had.
[2:57:41] &gt;&gt; He thought of what you was.
[2:57:46] &gt;&gt; If you tired, you tell me.
[2:57:49] &gt;&gt; He thought of what you was only. He
[2:57:52] wanted you to stand where?
[2:57:54] &gt;&gt; In the pulpit.
[2:57:55] &gt;&gt; Say he wanted you to sit where?
[2:57:57] &gt;&gt; In the seat tonight.
[2:57:58] &gt;&gt; Then we are serving his what?
[2:58:00] &gt;&gt; Eternal purpose. And the one that left
[2:58:03] home only come to the earth to do what?
[2:58:06] &gt;&gt; Serve his purpose.
[2:58:07] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:58:08] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:58:08] &gt;&gt; Then after it's finished, it is brought
[2:58:11] back in the water
[2:58:12] &gt;&gt; glorified state.
[2:58:13] &gt;&gt; It's what
[2:58:13] &gt;&gt; matured
[2:58:14] &gt;&gt; and water
[2:58:15] &gt;&gt; and brought back again.
[2:58:16] &gt;&gt; And God say whoever goes to Babylon will
[2:58:19] come back better.
[2:58:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:58:23] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.

[2:58:50] amen.
[2:58:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:58:52] &gt;&gt; And the word of the Lord and the word of
[2:58:55] the letter Du.
[2:58:58] &gt;&gt; Verse 20. Uh chapter 29:1 I'm sorry. Now

[2:59:31] &gt;&gt; has what
[2:59:32] &gt;&gt; carried away captive from Jerusalem to
[2:59:34] Babylon.
[2:59:34] &gt;&gt; So you know who to whom Jeremiah is
[2:59:36] talking to.
[2:59:37] &gt;&gt; Follow me please and then we can hand to
[2:59:40] the airport. Verse two. After who
[2:59:43] &gt;&gt; that Jeaniah the king

[2:59:46] After who?

[2:59:52] &gt;&gt; And the queen.
[2:59:53] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:59:53] &gt;&gt; And the Unix.
[2:59:54] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:59:54] &gt;&gt; The princes of Judah.
[2:59:55] &gt;&gt; Look right here.
[2:59:58] So the same people of 24 continue
[3:00:00] &gt;&gt; and the carpenters

[3:00:11] &gt;&gt; Jerusalem.
[3:00:12] &gt;&gt; From Jerusalem. Amen.
[3:00:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:00:14] &gt;&gt; Now Job 2:4.
[3:00:16] &gt;&gt; Thus sayith the Lord of hosts.
[3:00:18] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[3:00:18] &gt;&gt; The God of Israel.
[3:00:20] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[3:00:20] &gt;&gt; Unto all that are carried away captives.
[3:00:22] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[3:00:22] &gt;&gt; Whom I have caused to be carried away.
[3:00:24] &gt;&gt; Who caused to be carried away?
[3:00:26] &gt;&gt; God. Aha. Away from what?
[3:00:28] &gt;&gt; Jerusalem.
[3:00:29] &gt;&gt; Remember we coming from Jerusalem.
[3:00:31] Heavenly Jerusalem.
[3:00:33] &gt;&gt; Me and you were in heavenly Jerusalem.
[3:00:36] &gt;&gt; We came from eternity.
[3:00:38] &gt;&gt; And we were job in Babylon.
[3:00:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together? But we we have a
[3:00:43] mission in Babylon. We need to finish
[3:00:45] our mission and go back to Jerusalem.
[3:00:48] But we won't go back the same way. We
[3:00:50] are going back in the glorified state.
[3:00:53] But what do we do when we are in
[3:00:54] Babylon?
[3:00:56] &gt;&gt; Instruction of Babylon.
[3:00:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:00:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:01:00] &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse four. Thus sayith the
[3:01:02] Lord. Go ahead.
[3:01:03] &gt;&gt; Thus sayith the Lord of hosts.
[3:01:05] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[3:01:05] &gt;&gt; The God of Israel.
[3:01:06] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. The God of the army. Go ahead.
[3:01:08] &gt;&gt; Unto all that are carried away captives.
[3:01:11] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[3:01:11] &gt;&gt; Whom I have caused to be carried away
[3:01:13] from Jerusalem unto Babylon.
[3:01:15] &gt;&gt; Can I erase this?
[3:01:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:01:17] &gt;&gt; Okay. Continue, my friend.
[3:01:18] &gt;&gt; Build ye houses.
[3:01:21] Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Watch out.
[3:01:26] &gt;&gt; Watch out. We starting our instruction
[3:01:28] now.
[3:01:29] &gt;&gt; We starting our instruction.
[3:01:34] &gt;&gt; Who want to go home?
[3:01:36] &gt;&gt; Who want to go home?
[3:01:38] &gt;&gt; What is the instruction?
[3:01:40] &gt;&gt; Building houses.
[3:01:42] &gt;&gt; When they were going to Babylon, did
[3:01:44] they carry the house?
[3:01:45] &gt;&gt; No.
[3:01:46] &gt;&gt; But God says do what?
[3:01:48] &gt;&gt; Build houses. So they they had houses in
[3:01:51] them.
[3:01:52] [Applause]
[3:01:58] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to move on and drop to the
[3:02:01] airport.
[3:02:02] &gt;&gt; Instruction one is what?
[3:02:04] &gt;&gt; Build ye houses.
[3:02:06] &gt;&gt; Build what?
[3:02:08] &gt;&gt; Build houses.
[3:02:10] &gt;&gt; How am I going to build a house? I'm a
[3:02:11] captive.
[3:02:15] &gt;&gt; And God is saying build a house.
[3:02:17] &gt;&gt; So what is in you? a house.
[3:02:21] &gt;&gt; In other words, God begin to reveal to
[3:02:24] them
[3:02:25] &gt;&gt; what was in them
[3:02:26] &gt;&gt; when he sent them.
[3:02:28] &gt;&gt; Exactly right, brother.
[3:02:30] &gt;&gt; And there is a reason why there is a
[3:02:32] reason why Jeremiah is telling them
[3:02:35] this.
[3:02:39] &gt;&gt; Let's let's get the reason and then we
[3:02:41] come back to this.
[3:02:42] &gt;&gt; Go to verse eight. Let's skip to verse
[3:02:44] eight.
[3:02:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:02:45] &gt;&gt; Let's go. For what? For thus sayith the
[3:02:48] Lord of hosts,
[3:02:49] &gt;&gt; the God of Israel,
[3:02:50] &gt;&gt; let not your prophets, and your divers
[3:02:53] that be in the midst of youth,
[3:02:55] &gt;&gt; deceive you,
[3:02:56] &gt;&gt; neither hearken to your dreams, which he
[3:02:58] caused to be dreams.
[3:02:59] &gt;&gt; And we went through this for the water.
[3:03:01] &gt;&gt; For they prophesy falsely unto you in my
[3:03:03] name.
[3:03:04] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[3:03:04] &gt;&gt; I have not sent them, sayaith the Lord.
[3:03:06] &gt;&gt; Verse 10. Follow me. For thus sayith the
[3:03:08] Lord, that afterward
[3:03:10] &gt;&gt; 70 years be accomplished at Babylon.
[3:03:12] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[3:03:13] &gt;&gt; I will visit you
[3:03:14] &gt;&gt; and do what? and perform my good word
[3:03:16] toward you
[3:03:16] &gt;&gt; in causing you to do what?
[3:03:18] &gt;&gt; Return to this place.
[3:03:19] &gt;&gt; So God already have a date.
[3:03:24] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together that will come to
[3:03:26] rescue those people from Babylon and
[3:03:29] take them back to Jerusalem.
[3:03:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:03:32] &gt;&gt; But the problem is those people were
[3:03:35] confused by prophet.
[3:03:37] [Applause]
[3:03:41] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[3:03:42] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. Yes sir.
[3:03:44] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[3:03:47] &gt;&gt; The beginning of the Exodus, the
[3:03:50] beginning of the captivity, every
[3:03:53] prophet agree with it.
[3:03:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[3:03:55] &gt;&gt; Follow me please.
[3:03:57] &gt;&gt; But the disagreement was on the return.
[3:04:02] [Applause]
[3:04:03] &gt;&gt; The return back home.
[3:04:06] &gt;&gt; The return back home has many doctrines.
[3:04:15] I hope we are together.
[3:04:17] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[3:04:19] &gt;&gt; Some say in two years.
[3:04:21] &gt;&gt; Some say in three years. Yes sir.
[3:04:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:24] &gt;&gt; And all those uncertain sound
[3:04:28] &gt;&gt; were causing confusion.
[3:04:31] &gt;&gt; And then the behavior of the people did
[3:04:34] not know what to do
[3:04:36] &gt;&gt; because when the Paul say when a trumpet
[3:04:39] give an uncertain sound
[3:04:41] We don't know what to do.
[3:04:43] &gt;&gt; Should we stay or should we go?
[3:04:46] &gt;&gt; Should we engage and integrate
[3:04:49] &gt;&gt; or should we stay as stranger?
[3:04:53] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[3:04:55] &gt;&gt; So the beginning was not a problem.
[3:04:58] &gt;&gt; The speculation,
[3:05:00] the prophecy, the dream were about the
[3:05:04] time of return.
[3:05:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:05:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[3:05:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:05:11] &gt;&gt; If somebody will stay two years,
[3:05:14] &gt;&gt; why do they need to build a house?
[3:05:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:05:21] &gt;&gt; If somebody will stay one year,
[3:05:23] &gt;&gt; do they need to build a house?
[3:05:25] &gt;&gt; Do they need to go to school?
[3:05:28] &gt;&gt; But if you tell that person that listen
[3:05:30] you will stay here 70 years,
[3:05:32] &gt;&gt; then that person changes. Amen.
[3:05:37] &gt;&gt; So there were too many voices
[3:05:40] &gt;&gt; that were fighting the voice of
[3:05:42] Jeremiah.
[3:05:44] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[3:05:46] &gt;&gt; There was a major prophet
[3:05:48] &gt;&gt; that already spoke,
[3:05:50] &gt;&gt; but there were other voices that were
[3:05:53] misinterpreting
[3:05:55] &gt;&gt; and speaking things contrary to
[3:05:57] Jeremiah.
[3:05:59] &gt;&gt; And because of that, the people were
[3:06:01] stuck.
[3:06:03] Amen.
[3:06:04] &gt;&gt; They didn't know what to do.
[3:06:05] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[3:06:05] &gt;&gt; That's why Jeremiah sent a letter.
[3:06:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:06:08] &gt;&gt; And say, "This is what you do."
[3:06:10] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[3:06:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:06:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:06:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this, my friend,
[3:06:13] in the message, the voice of God for the
[3:06:15] last day, he says what?
[3:06:17] &gt;&gt; And today,
[3:06:17] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[3:06:18] &gt;&gt; one reason that the church is in the
[3:06:20] condition that it's in
[3:06:21] &gt;&gt; is because there is what?
[3:06:23] &gt;&gt; So many voices.
[3:06:24] &gt;&gt; So many are the voices to attract the
[3:06:27] church from what?
[3:06:28] &gt;&gt; The voice of God.
[3:06:29] &gt;&gt; Until it is very what? doubtful
[3:06:32] &gt;&gt; that many would hard would hear the
[3:06:34] voice of God though he spoke what
[3:06:37] &gt;&gt; right in their midst
[3:06:38] &gt;&gt; they perhaps would not even understand
[3:06:40] it
[3:06:40] &gt;&gt; uh-huh
[3:06:40] &gt;&gt; because it would be a what
[3:06:42] &gt;&gt; a foreign thing to them
[3:06:43] &gt;&gt; they have gotten themselves so much
[3:06:45] center on
[3:06:46] &gt;&gt; the voices of the day
[3:06:48] &gt;&gt; too much confusion
[3:06:49] &gt;&gt; that's right
[3:06:50] &gt;&gt; about the return
[3:06:52] &gt;&gt; let me put it in our way
[3:06:54] &gt;&gt; too much confusion about when the Lord
[3:06:58] is coming
[3:07:01] Because our return goes with the coming
[3:07:04] of the Lord.
[3:07:05] &gt;&gt; But too much interpretation
[3:07:08] about when the rapture will take place.
[3:07:10] &gt;&gt; And because of that, we stuck.
[3:07:13] &gt;&gt; Some thought he was 77.
[3:07:17] [Applause]
[3:07:20] &gt;&gt; And they didn't go to school.
[3:07:25] &gt;&gt; They didn't want to start a business.
[3:07:28] Hallelujah.
[3:07:29] &gt;&gt; They were in two they were in 75. They
[3:07:32] didn't want to build a house
[3:07:34] &gt;&gt; because in two years we are going
[3:07:36] &gt;&gt; but another oil has open.
[3:07:39] [Music]
[3:07:40] [Applause]
[3:07:42] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[3:07:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:07:44] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[3:07:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:07:46] &gt;&gt; I can imagine what happened to message
[3:07:48] believer in 77.
[3:07:53] &gt;&gt; You want to go to college? It's 1977.
[3:07:57] &gt;&gt; The world is finished. Brother Mickey,
[3:08:00] why are you sending the children to
[3:08:01] college?
[3:08:02] &gt;&gt; And the children sat at home
[3:08:04] &gt;&gt; and the rapture didn't happen.
[3:08:12] [Applause]
[3:08:16] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[3:08:17] &gt;&gt; Can I continue? We talking about
[3:08:19] instruction in season.
[3:08:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:08:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:08:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[3:08:25] &gt;&gt; They brought you a mortgage company.
[3:08:27] &gt;&gt; All right. Get your loan.
[3:08:29] &gt;&gt; Get a new house. It's 77. What am I
[3:08:32] going to do with a house?
[3:08:33] &gt;&gt; I don't need a house. After 77, you are
[3:08:36] living on the apartment.
[3:08:40] &gt;&gt; You miss your season.
[3:08:46] &gt;&gt; If you tired, we see next Sunday.
[3:08:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because of so many
[3:08:52] voices.
[3:08:52] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[3:08:54] So many interpretation
[3:08:57] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham say there is what?
[3:08:59] &gt;&gt; So many voices on the earth today.
[3:09:01] &gt;&gt; So many voices in the earth today. That
[3:09:03] is what
[3:09:03] &gt;&gt; absolutely a hard thing
[3:09:05] &gt;&gt; because he deaden
[3:09:07] &gt;&gt; the voice of what?
[3:09:08] &gt;&gt; Of the supernatural.
[3:09:09] &gt;&gt; That's it my dear my brother.
[3:09:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is so many what?
[3:09:14] &gt;&gt; Intellectual voices
[3:09:15] &gt;&gt; what?
[3:09:16] &gt;&gt; Great voices of mighty men who are
[3:09:18] intellectual
[3:09:18] &gt;&gt; that in the intellectual condition even
[3:09:21] what?
[3:09:22] &gt;&gt; Shake the nations. stand
[3:09:25] &gt;&gt; all over the world.
[3:09:27] &gt;&gt; Move, move, move, move, move. Message
[3:09:29] moving.
[3:09:31] &gt;&gt; Where are we today?
[3:09:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[3:09:35] &gt;&gt; We came up. We said, "Oh, our is the
[3:09:38] shortest of age."
[3:09:40] &gt;&gt; Everybody was waiting for 2020.
[3:09:43] &gt;&gt; Everybody was waiting for 2000. Now this
[3:09:46] is the shortest of age. Now we cross
[3:09:48] that. Where are you today? That's why
[3:09:51] you need instruction.
[3:09:54] [Applause]
[3:09:58] &gt;&gt; Now this is the shortened age. Ephes
[3:10:02] and this and this. So let's watch which
[3:10:05] age was it? It's 2000. So and so
[3:10:07] everybody's waiting. It's September.
[3:10:10] It's November. It's December.
[3:10:16] &gt;&gt; Happy New Year. Happy New Year. The
[3:10:20] rapture didn't happen.
[3:10:23] &gt;&gt; Recently this year, somebody prophesied
[3:10:27] in the denominational word
[3:10:29] &gt;&gt; in the month of September. There will be
[3:10:31] the rapture. Even message believer were
[3:10:34] watching that he pass. Where are you at?
[3:10:39] &gt;&gt; Too many voices.
[3:10:43] &gt;&gt; Too many voices.

[3:10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:10:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10:56] &gt;&gt; My friend, catch this.
[3:10:58] &gt;&gt; Uh, go to verse four. So, let's finish
[3:11:00] this. Let's go to the airport.
[3:11:02] &gt;&gt; Thus sayith the Lord of hosts.

[3:11:06] &gt;&gt; Unto all that are carried away captives.
[3:11:08] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Good. Go to verse four.
[3:11:10] &gt;&gt; Whom I have caused to be carried away
[3:11:11] from Jerusalem unto Babylon.

[3:34:16] awfulst coat done there you ever seen.
[3:34:20] Each one of them every morning they go
[3:34:22] out and they say they ain't going to

[3:34:30] &gt;&gt; rapture.

[3:34:36] &gt;&gt; understand.

[3:34:39] &gt;&gt; down there.
[3:34:40] &gt;&gt; So yes sir, you ought take a lesson from
[3:34:42] the end. Uh-huh.
[3:34:44] &gt;&gt; The Bible say, you know, if they don't
[3:34:46] work, they don't water.
[3:34:47] &gt;&gt; That is what
[3:34:48] &gt;&gt; exactly.
[3:34:49] &gt;&gt; So what is your instruction today in
[3:34:51] Babylon?
[3:34:53] &gt;&gt; Live no more.

[3:35:03] your opportunity. God is in control of
[3:35:07] everything.
[3:35:10] When the time come for the rapture, we
[3:35:13] will drop what we doing and we will take
[3:35:16] off. But if it have not come down, be
[3:35:19] solid and send Christian.
[3:35:24] &gt;&gt; Parent,

[3:35:55] &gt;&gt; Instruction.
[3:35:57] &gt;&gt; Divine instruction from the season.
[3:36:00] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah years ago, brother Brham didn't
[3:36:04] give you any scripture here to show you
[3:36:07] that he and Jeremiah match.
[3:36:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. He spoke under the inspiration. The
[3:36:12] same God that spoke through brother
[3:36:13] Brham spoke in the Bible. And the same
[3:36:16] God anointed me to see that brother
[3:36:19] Brham and Jeremiah spoke the same thing
[3:36:22] under the same condition because he's
[3:36:25] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[3:36:28] God bless you. Let us stand.
[3:36:40] My friend, thank you very much for going
[3:36:42] over
[3:36:44] &gt;&gt; because he help move so next time we
[3:36:46] pick up the other one. Amen. Let's pray.
[3:36:49] Heavenly Father, Lord, we are
[3:36:51] approaching you humbly this afternoon.
[3:36:54] Father, thanking you for your grace,
[3:36:56] your love, your mercy, and for
[3:36:57] everything you have been doing for us.
[3:36:59] Father, this is as far as we could go.
[3:37:02] Lord, I went beyond our normal time, but
[3:37:05] I pray that you reward each one, Lord,
[3:37:08] Father, for being willing to let me move
[3:37:10] on so that Lord, Father, we can get to
[3:37:12] the next step. Father, these things has
[3:37:15] been messing around all this message for
[3:37:18] a while until young people never finish
[3:37:21] their schooling.
[3:37:22] &gt;&gt; Some never even went to a career. Yeah,
[3:37:25] &gt;&gt; they got stuck because of the way things
[3:37:27] were presented and they found themselves
[3:37:29] in difficult situation to be even able
[3:37:32] to provide for their family. But Lord,
[3:37:34] Father, there was an instruction given
[3:37:37] clear by your prophet Lord about what to
[3:37:40] do for the hour of return. You want us
[3:37:43] to be sane to be solid. If there is
[3:37:45] something wrong, we correct our walk. We
[3:37:47] keep our walk center into you, but we
[3:37:50] live our normal life just like Shadrach,
[3:37:53] just like Mach. Just like Abednego,
[3:37:56] Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, Ezekiel, all of
[3:37:59] them leave their part and Lord stood for
[3:38:02] you in the midst of Babylon. Father, you
[3:38:04] have chosen us to stand in this midst of
[3:38:07] this modern Babylon so that we can
[3:38:09] reflect you and shine according to the
[3:38:12] light that have come in the midst of
[3:38:14] darkness to show this world that Jesus
[3:38:16] Christ is alive. Father, I commit this
[3:38:19] sermon and what was spoken unto the
[3:38:21] hand. May you touch each young man and
[3:38:23] the young people to go back and the
[3:38:25] parent to really listen to this so that
[3:38:27] they can understand that they need to
[3:38:29] take things in charge and the time of
[3:38:32] decision has come
[3:38:34] &gt;&gt; because they got instructed to know how
[3:38:36] to move on until we meet you in the air.
[3:38:39] We thank you and commit everything unto
[3:38:41] the hand. Bless us all Lord Father in
[3:38:44] this oncoming week. Father may your
[3:38:46] blood protect me. I know when we going
[3:38:48] through this type of sermon, I know
[3:38:50] fight is waiting for me. May you protect
[3:38:52] my family, my home, my business,
[3:38:55] everything that I'm doing, even the
[3:38:56] church, Lord, so that you stand between
[3:38:59] me and the work of darkness. Father, I
[3:39:01] pray that you be with this church and
[3:39:03] protect each one of us in the name of
[3:39:06] Jesus Christ. In Jesus precious name.
[3:39:09] Amen. God bless you church. We love you.
