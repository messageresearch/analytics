[35:00] didn't know that's a surprise
[35:03] but it's wonderful lord's willing we
[35:05] shake hands probably after church amen
[35:08] i'm not sure where some people are
[35:11] probably they caught up on the traffic
[35:13] but
[35:14] maybe they will make it you pray god
[35:16] this is the time there is traffic on 85
[35:19] because of the
[35:21] the
[35:22] lights
[35:24] amen
[35:25] which we don't believe in those kind of
[35:26] christmas stuff amen
[35:28] but because it's traffic but by god's
[35:30] grace we're here tonight amen
[35:33] wonderful how many are still chewing on
[35:35] that melchizedek amen
[35:37] amen amen amen blessed be the name of
[35:41] the lord ruth have to come through the
[35:43] land of judah
[35:45] and she have to enter the only door that
[35:48] the moabite could enter into the
[35:49] congregation was through the door of
[35:52] judah amen because the scripture already
[35:55] said there is no more about
[35:57] that can be part of the congregation of
[35:59] israel so there is only one tribe
[36:02] that can override that power
[36:05] amen amen because judah have the scepter
[36:08] and the scepter have a power to override
[36:11] the law that's why esther could enter in
[36:14] the presence of the king
[36:16] regardless of what how many i mean the
[36:19] uh
[36:20] the risk that was there
[36:22] she faced death completely but when the
[36:24] stretch the scepter the scepter can
[36:28] overpower the law and get there so even
[36:30] though the law say no more about should
[36:33] be part of the congregation of israel
[36:35] but by entering judah that was the
[36:38] perfect entrance
[36:40] and not only the perfect interest but
[36:42] that's an entrance of melchizedek
[36:45] because over there you can get the
[36:47] kinship and the priesthood together
[36:50] amen amen blessed be the name of the
[36:53] lord
[36:54] my god wonderful thing keep opening up
[36:57] with this land of judah amen
[37:01] lord
[37:02] willing just remember the oncoming
[37:05] service the new year's eve and

[45:42] these nations are more than i
[45:46] how can i dispossess them
[45:51] that shall not be afraid of them
[45:55] but shall we remember
[45:58] what the lord thy god did
[46:00] unto pharaoh
[46:02] and unto all egypt amen
[46:05] the great temptations which the eyes saw
[46:09] and the signs and the wonders and the
[46:12] mighty hand and the stretched out arm
[46:15] whereby the lord thy god brought thee
[46:18] out out

[46:25] of whom
[46:26] that are afraid
[46:28] amen shall be seated while i read some
[46:30] few more verses from the bible

[46:44] let's read verse nine
[46:50] have not i commanded thee
[46:53] be strong
[46:55] and of a good courage
[46:58] be not afraid
[47:01] neither be doubt
[47:03] this me
[47:05] for the lord thy god is with thee
[47:09] whether so ever that goeth
[47:13] hallelujah
[47:15] let's read one more scripture
[47:22] from the gospel of saint matthew
[47:26] the gospel of matthew you can get all
[47:28] through the scripture when god tells his
[47:30] children not to be afraid
[47:35] brother said god don't want us to fear
[47:41] god wants us to believe
[47:45] yes
[47:48] so matthew let's read verse 14 chapter
[47:52] 14
[47:55] matthew chapter 14.
[47:59] let's read from verse 26
[48:03] and when the disciples saw him
[48:07] walking on the sea they were troubled
[48:09] saying
[48:12] it is a spirit
[48:14] and they cried out of fear
[48:17] but straightway jesus speak unto them
[48:20] say be of gucci
[48:22] it is i be not afraid
[48:27] may the lord bless the reading of his
[48:29] word amen
[48:31] so for this little time we just want to
[48:33] encourage ourselves with being unafraid
[48:38] amen
[48:39] the prophet of god said there is nothing
[48:41] out of cater
[48:45] god is behind every move
[48:49] and everything
[48:51] there might be things you don't
[48:53] understand
[48:55] and i don't understand
[48:57] and we don't understand but he
[48:59] understands
[49:02] so
[49:03] be not afraid
[49:08] you might be trying to find answer to
[49:10] this and you don't but be not afraid
[49:14] why because we are not here by chance
[49:17] and we are not here accidentally
[49:20] you are not here accidentally
[49:22] i'm not here accidentally
[49:25] and you are not even here
[49:28] accidentally for none unto god are all
[49:31] his ways we have been taught his
[49:33] creature that he knows every flea and
[49:36] every fly
[49:38] and we should remember
[49:40] that
[49:41] he pre-planned and pre-arrange our
[49:44] journey here on earth
[49:46] god bless you
[49:48] amen
[49:49] hallelujah amen
[49:51] isn't it wonderful
[49:54] there are things you don't understand of
[49:56] course you would not understand and i
[49:58] would not understand but we have a
[50:00] promise that when the morning comes we
[50:02] will understand
[50:06] the prophet said
[50:08] you know before it rains you know
[50:10] there's a rugged and rough skies and
[50:13] thundering enlightening and this he said
[50:16] but out of that comes life
[50:18] the rain comes and life comes in
[50:21] so you know god is great
[50:24] and his ways are past finding out
[50:27] amen
[50:29] and as i have said you know
[50:32] did that inform you the scripture tells
[50:34] us he predestinated yes
[50:37] and do that he predestinated he called
[50:40] and though that he called he justified
[50:43] and done that he has justified his
[50:45] glorifies
[50:47] so the works were finished
[50:50] before the foundation of the world
[50:53] and i said listen
[50:56] you are being here
[50:57] man being here listen you could not be
[51:00] born earlier than the day you were born
[51:07] you understand that
[51:08] your mother could not have given birth
[51:10] to you earlier than the time she gave
[51:12] back to you
[51:14] because that is the time god planned it
[51:20] and therefore you cannot even live here
[51:24] anytime
[51:25] you can live here on your own
[51:28] because you didn't bring yourself here
[51:32] somebody brought you here
[51:35] and he will see to it
[51:38] so be not afraid
[51:42] like i have said i have said to people
[51:44] since this pandemic broke and you know
[51:47] everybody living in fear
[51:50] because the world leaders are confused
[51:53] the doctors are confused
[51:55] the scientists are confused
[51:58] everybody is confused
[52:01] everybody is afraid
[52:03] there was a time
[52:10] [Music]
[52:13] people would run away
[52:28] thank god that he has brought us through
[52:37] do you know
[52:38] that a lot of
[52:40] people have died in this mandate
[52:43] but why are you doing
[52:44] that
[52:46] why have you know that
[52:48] amen
[52:52] are you there
[52:53] be not afraid
[52:58] you can't go out of here
[53:01] until god's purpose has been
[53:02] accomplished in your life
[53:10] you believe that
[53:11] that is what i believe
[53:13] because that is what the prophet taught
[53:17] [Music]
[53:21] hallelujah
[53:24] praise the lord
[53:25] i said you can't live here until god has
[53:29] finished with you
[53:31] and that settles it
[53:35] now i want to say this to you
[53:37] don't compare your life to anybody
[53:40] [Applause]
[53:43] because
[53:45] you cannot be anybody
[53:47] you just have to be who you are
[53:50] because that is the way god made you
[53:53] and that is how you will be you cannot
[53:56] be me
[53:57] and i cannot be you
[53:59] [Music]
[54:02] amen
[54:04] the bible says
[54:06] those who compare themselves to
[54:08] themselves are not wise
[54:13] are you following that
[54:16] are you following that
[54:18] so don't compare yourself to anybody the
[54:20] bible says
[54:22] soon through the flood
[54:24] sun through the fire
[54:26] sun through great sorrows
[54:28] sun through great fires
[54:30] but all through the blood
[54:40] so
[54:41] the one that plan you are coming here
[54:45] it is for purpose
[54:48] and until that purpose has been done
[54:51] there is nobody that can take you out of
[54:54] here
[55:00] [Applause]
[55:01] hallelujah
[55:04] listen we are made differently for
[55:06] different purposes
[55:09] the prophet of god said
[55:11] god can treat a man for 40 years and use
[55:14] him for five minutes
[55:17] five
[55:18] minutes and that is it
[55:21] it's finished
[55:23] hallelujah
[55:28] nothing can take you out of here
[55:31] hey listen even if you want to die you
[55:33] will not die
[55:40] do you know that there are people that
[55:42] try to kill themselves and they don't
[55:43] die
[55:48] so you can't go nowhere
[55:52] no matter how you desire to go
[55:54] you will not go
[55:56] until the one who brought you here
[55:58] says that
[56:00] go
[56:02] but until then settle yourself
[56:05] settle in your mind that i am not going
[56:07] anywhere so lord help me to do
[56:10] what you want me to do so the earlier
[56:13] you do it the better you get your peace
[56:19] [Applause]
[56:22] amen
[56:23] hallelujah
[56:25] [Music]
[56:26] so stop crying and do what you have to
[56:29] do
[56:32] stop complaining
[56:34] start memory
[56:36] stop worry
[56:37] [Music]
[56:38] stop that because it will never help you
[56:43] you remember one time david
[56:46] had problems his people
[56:48] were against him the people his brothers
[56:50] and they wanted to stone him said
[56:51] because of you they have taken our wives
[56:54] and then we begin to further and he was
[56:56] crying
[56:58] and the bible said but david encouraged
[57:01] himself
[57:03] he realized that crying will not solve
[57:05] the problem
[57:06] worry will not solve the problem
[57:08] complaints will not solve the problem
[57:10] he has to do something about it
[57:13] problem worry cry he doesn't solve
[57:15] problem
[57:18] and david encourage himself in the lord
[57:20] it's a lot
[57:22] should i go after them
[57:24] will i overtake them this yeah if you
[57:26] stop crying and you get up and you
[57:28] straighten yourself up and you make
[57:30] things right in your life and you quit
[57:31] you gather
[57:33] you overtake them
[57:35] and you redeem all
[57:38] [Applause]
[57:43] hallelujah
[57:46] hey
[57:47] be not afraid
[57:52] don't let fear rule your life
[57:57] the prophet of god said
[58:00] there are two elements
[58:02] two forces and two powers
[58:03] that controls every man
[58:07] every nation
[58:08] every bird
[58:10] every gang
[58:12] and that one is fear and the other is
[58:15] faith
[58:18] so
[58:19] what is controlling your life
[58:24] because
[58:25] you can say oh have faith oh you can but
[58:27] your action speaks louder
[58:33] your behavior
[58:34] your attitude the way you look at things
[58:37] the way you take things
[58:39] shows what is controlling your life
[58:47] hallelujah
[58:49] may the lord help us
[58:52] your behavior
[58:54] your actions
[58:55] it's just what is controlling your life
[59:00] brother branham said
[59:02] god does not want his children to fear
[59:06] he wants his children to believe him
[59:10] that's why i told the scriptures
[59:13] all from jesus he said be not afraid
[59:17] fear came in because of unbelief
[59:22] that's when adam said i am afraid
[59:25] because i heard your voice
[59:27] when did the voice of god begin to make
[59:29] you afraid
[59:32] that was not the first time god was
[59:34] coming to them
[59:35] god was the first prophet
[59:38] jehovah himself was the messenger
[59:40] that gave them the message
[59:42] so god has an order
[59:44] that in every age and at every time he
[59:48] sends a prophet
[59:50] the prophet may not be to your taste
[59:53] might not be to your test
[59:55] but he is a prophet
[59:57] hallelujah
[1:00:01] jesus said to the people your father has
[1:00:04] killed the prophet
[1:00:05] and you garnish the atoms
[1:00:07] why did they keep the prophets why did
[1:00:10] they destroy the prophet because they
[1:00:12] always thought the prophets were wrong
[1:00:19] there was not a prophet were wrong
[1:00:21] the bible said jeremiah isaiah was so
[1:00:24] asander
[1:00:25] the believers did that
[1:00:27] the church did that to him
[1:00:29] but he was a prophet
[1:00:33] hallelujah
[1:00:35] be not afraid
[1:00:38] there is nothing out of cater
[1:00:41] god is in control
[1:00:43] the creator
[1:00:45] the creator
[1:00:46] of the universe
[1:00:48] the god almighty the creator
[1:00:51] of the universe is in control
[1:00:54] over nature over everything that is
[1:00:57] happening today there is nothing
[1:01:00] out of cater so be not afraid he rules
[1:01:04] and erase he's above all
[1:01:07] he is the almighty god be not afraid
[1:01:24] biggest trouble there is in the church
[1:01:26] today is a bunch of fear
[1:01:29] fear people always cared
[1:01:33] and that is
[1:01:35] of the devil
[1:01:37] be scared
[1:01:39] be brave
[1:01:43] don't be scared
[1:01:45] be brave
[1:01:50] you don't have nothing there is nothing
[1:01:53] to be afraid of
[1:01:58] god said be brave
[1:02:01] he told you
[1:02:02] be of good courage
[1:02:05] whether so ever that goes i will be
[1:02:07] there with you
[1:02:09] i will not leave you
[1:02:10] and i will not forsake you
[1:02:13] oh yes church he promised never to leave
[1:02:16] us
[1:02:17] so be not afraid
[1:02:19] he is the god that controls the universe
[1:02:22] he is the almighty god
[1:02:25] hallelujah
[1:02:27] be not afraid
[1:02:29] why because he said i will build my text
[1:02:32] and the gate of faith shall not prevail
[1:02:35] [Applause]
[1:02:39] the prophet said that means there will
[1:02:41] be the gate of faith
[1:02:43] there will be challenges
[1:02:44] there will be difficulties
[1:02:46] there will be trials there will be
[1:02:48] disappointment
[1:02:49] but they shall not prevail
[1:02:53] there will be sicknesses
[1:02:55] trouble here and there but they will not
[1:02:57] prevail
[1:02:58] i will build my church the church is
[1:03:01] built by jesus christ
[1:03:03] he is the author and the finisher of our
[1:03:06] faith
[1:03:07] therefore
[1:03:08] be not afraid
[1:03:14] [Applause]
[1:03:17] praise the name of the lord listening
[1:03:21] he predestinated us
[1:03:25] unto adoption
[1:03:27] of sons and daughters
[1:03:30] the work has already been finished
[1:03:34] so be not afraid
[1:03:36] what are you afraid of

[1:33:50] what do you want me to do
[1:33:53] and we must find from god what does he
[1:33:55] want us to do

[1:38:36] wonder he never hyped anything
[1:38:38] all that we know today he said it
[1:38:40] himself
[1:38:42] he said it to himself
[1:38:44] my wife backed the door on me and this
[1:38:46] one he never
[1:38:48] let any brother preachers here come and
[1:38:50] stand behind the church and say that my
[1:38:52] wife banged the door on me my wife
[1:38:55] you have to live somewhere else
[1:38:59] you will go and live somewhere else

[1:39:19] but this man
[1:39:21] set a life
[1:39:23] there was nothing secret about it these
[1:39:25] messages was not preached in a corner
[1:39:28] the thing that god did was not done in a
[1:39:31] corner

[1:39:54] and yet he's the friend of god
[1:39:57] the bible says they were men of like
[1:39:59] persons as we are
[1:40:01] but god uses man
[1:40:04] irrespective of what they are in their
[1:40:05] shackles god uses them
[1:40:08] what is important to us today
[1:40:11] is the message

[1:40:15] resurrection he prayed the holy ghost

[1:41:06] i am committed to it
[1:41:07] i am showed up to it
[1:41:09] it's my life
[1:41:11] it has helped me
[1:41:13] i got this message when i uh 1978.
[1:41:19] and i've never been the same
[1:41:23] i was a pentecostal boy
[1:41:26] i was buying christian literatures here
[1:41:28] and there
[1:41:30] we had a little
[1:41:31] we preaching the buses
[1:41:33] we do bus evangelism we go to street
[1:41:36] evangelism we go to market evangelism we
[1:41:39] go everywhere preaching and i buy
[1:41:41] christian literatures
[1:41:42] and i go everywhere buying books here
[1:41:44] and there
[1:41:46] until one day
[1:41:48] all those years i never heard anything
[1:41:49] about prophet i don't know
[1:41:51] but one day
[1:41:53] grace came down
[1:41:55] and somebody introduced
[1:41:57] jesus look
[1:41:59] look look huh
[1:42:01] and i was preparing to go to bible
[1:42:03] college
[1:42:04] i wanted to go to bible college
[1:42:06] i tried that i want to go to that we'll
[1:42:09] be hearing about a alley that was a
[1:42:11] young boy
[1:42:12] miracle valley i want to go to miranda
[1:42:14] valley
[1:42:15] but one of the first messages that i
[1:42:17] read was a true sign that is overlooked
[1:42:21] i don't want to overlook that true sound
[1:42:26] true sign
[1:42:27] if you miss the sign
[1:42:28] if you misread the sign you will get
[1:42:31] lost
[1:42:34] when the signs are given
[1:42:36] the one who breaks the road desires
[1:42:38] everything and give no signs
[1:42:40] you must know the real science you
[1:42:42] should be able to read the wrong signs
[1:42:43] and you should be able to follow the
[1:42:45] road signs when you follow the roadside
[1:42:47] you reach your destination
[1:42:52] i read the message i think the second
[1:42:54] message that i was invisible you know of
[1:42:57] the heavenly bright room and there i
[1:42:59] didn't even understood it but something
[1:43:01] he said this is the truth
[1:43:06] and since then
[1:43:07] it has been coming from glory to glory
[1:43:10] from i mean
[1:43:11] i mean glory to glory the light keeps
[1:43:14] coming plain and plainer
[1:43:17] look into your own life
[1:43:19] what has the message done
[1:43:20] what has christ done in your life
[1:43:23] because all that the prophet preached
[1:43:25] was christ
[1:43:26] nobody exhausted christ like brother
[1:43:29] branham did
[1:43:31] he exalted christ
[1:43:32] everything about christ everything about
[1:43:35] christ everything about the world he
[1:43:37] said this is my absolute year everything
[1:43:40] is here
[1:43:41] nobody did it like brother brahm did it
[1:43:44] stay with the word of god
[1:43:52] god bless you
[1:43:54] don't be afraid
[1:43:55] fear will make you to faith
[1:43:57] if you have a doubt you're going to take
[1:43:59] a medicine and you have doubt whether
[1:44:01] this thing will work or not it will
[1:44:03] never work no double minded person can
[1:44:06] receive anything from god
[1:44:08] you must be settled in your mind
[1:44:10] convinced and consent
[1:44:13] this thing i thought will it work this
[1:44:14] thing
[1:44:16] you have doubt it will never work
[1:44:19] when they pray for me will i get where
[1:44:21] hey if you don't believe it will never
[1:44:22] work for you
[1:44:26] be not afraid
[1:44:29] don't look at the opposition
[1:44:31] don't look at the people in the land the
[1:44:33] oh this one said that and that was said
[1:44:35] this and this one said that and this one
[1:44:37] said that i don't care what anybody says

[1:44:43] don't care
[1:44:45] whether anakin's or jebusize or dwarf
[1:44:48] statement and i don't care about that i
[1:44:50] care about the holy ghost i care about
[1:44:52] the word that they preach i care about
[1:44:54] jesus christ
[1:44:55] [Music]

[1:44:58] don't be afraid
[1:45:00] they said
[1:45:01] in our own eyes we look like
