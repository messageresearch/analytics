[2:29] you
[3:54] when God can get amazing coming it
[3:59] senses conscience everything lead out
[4:03] into the stands with God behind it in
[4:06] the spirit it's not a devil in the world
[4:09] can poke it down here right he commenced
[4:13] so you don't feel any better your
[4:14] conscience is even God the fruit so
[4:18] clear shouts hallelujah the outlet
[4:22] those are whistle blowing I don't want
[4:24] to challenge I'm just a clean deep air
[4:28] for the word of God to work through the
[4:30] power of God
[4:31] see that's the main thing there's your
[4:33] battle ground your battle ground is back
[4:36] here at the beginning that care in the
[4:40] soul back in your mind that opens the
[4:44] the mind is the gate to the soul gate to
[4:47] the spirit rather your mind opens up and
[4:50] accepts the spirit all right rejects the
[4:53] spirit you're gonna have a little
[4:55] consciousness little feelings and little
[4:56] sensations all these things that has
[4:58] nothing to do with it
[4:59] that's those little sensations and
[5:01] things but when it comes to reality your
[5:03] mind opens it up your mind either accept
[5:07] it or reject it God let none of a miss
[5:14] it
[5:15] see it's your mind that opens up the
[5:19] door our closes the door and this is to
[5:22] your conscience
[5:23] this is to your memory this is to your
[5:26] affections but when your mind closes
[5:31] itself to these things and let God the
[5:34] spirit of his word come in it blows the
[5:37] rest of the stuff out ever doubt is gone
[5:42] ever fear is gone ever sensation of
[5:46] doubt is gone ever feeling is gone
[5:49] there's nothing standing there but the
[5:51] Word of God and Satan cannot battle
[5:53] against that no sir you cannot battle
[5:57] against it now we know that's true these
[6:01] battles has raged since the day of the
[6:04] Garden of Eden the battle in
[6:07] human mind Satan started it what did he
[6:11] do when he met Eve he didn't deny God's
[6:13] Word but he whitewashed it
[6:16] he stopped up some little channels here
[6:19] somewhere
[6:20] he said but surely God Genesis 3:1 think
[6:23] surely got all these things that he he
[6:27] promised he know the Word was right but
[6:29] he known he couldn't have come right out
[6:30] and blasted out Blair II like that but
[6:33] he sugar-coated it like mama used to get
[6:37] us take medicine and she try to put
[6:40] orange juice and cast on my just fella
[6:42] take the cast or without the orange
[6:44] juice anything it's hypocritical see she
[6:48] used to have to get up at nighttime
[6:49] she'd give us coal arm for crude and
[6:52] she'd put cold oil and put sugar on it
[6:54] see kind of hypocritical but his burn
[6:57] your tonsils out nearly going down I
[6:59] have to sugar that well that's the way
[7:01] it is friend Satan tries to to be
[7:04] hypocritical about it he tries to show
[7:06] you something better easier way a more
[7:09] sensible plan but there is no more
[7:11] sensible planning that God laid down at
[7:13] the beginning hole that word get a grip
[7:18] on it let he get a grip on you stay
[7:21] there with it that's that's the thing a
[7:23] battle rage when Eve opened up her mind
[7:28] to listen to her reasoning that's the
[7:33] fluid come in that's a shame that run
[7:35] down her reasoning she in her soul she
[7:40] reasoned her eyes were sight she saw the
[7:43] serpent is beautiful handsome flower are
[7:47] better than her own husband is the most
[7:50] stub still of all the beasts of the
[7:51] field and he was probably a fair man
[7:54] that her husband he looked like a great
[7:56] masculine be standing there how great he
[7:59] wanted he has tried to tell her what a
[8:00] great thing it was and first thing she
[8:03] did she opened up her mind and when she
[8:09] did human reasonings colic
[8:13] why wouldn't that be a thrill that's the
[8:16] thing he does to a woman today someone
[8:19] with a lovely little husband find some
[8:22] great big master man this man will try
[8:25] to open you up the reasons read that's
[8:27] Satan accidental or Vicey Versey manage
[8:33] a woman woman to man he's away what does
[8:36] he do work in that reasoning power that
[8:40] conscience or something begins to move
[8:42] through but give God's Word the first
[8:45] place a man can't even come to vacation
[8:51] honey here is this coming fresh a man
[8:57] cannot sin until first he cast aside
[9:01] God's Word he can't even see his
[9:07] disbelief until first he gets rid of the
[9:11] word of God the presence of God he
[9:13] cannot see him Eve could not see him
[9:17] until she laid aside god's word opening
[9:20] up her channel of reasons to her soul
[9:22] and begin the reason why certainly my
[9:26] husband's never told me these things but
[9:28] I believe that you he told me I
[9:30] shouldn't do this but you know you make
[9:33] it so real it's so clean I believe it
[9:37] would be wonderful because you're making
[9:39] it so plain to me see that was the first
[9:41] battle and through that battle has
[9:45] caused every other whatever bloodshed
[9:48] that ever comes cause right not even she
[9:51] disbelieved God's Word and if one little
[9:55] IOT of God's Word was this brief caused
[9:58] all this trouble how are we going to get
[9:59] back disbelieving the word you can't do
[10:04] it
[10:04] you've got to shut off all these other
[10:07] things conscience memories and say
[10:10] reasonings and all these are they
[10:11] casting down reasoning we don't reason
[10:14] about all nothing at all we just accept
[10:17] the word upon the basis God said so it
[10:19] sets a string between you and God every
[10:22] channel comes open between you and God
[10:27] the very first front line let's not use
[10:31] a 22 rifle let's get a comic bomb let's
[10:37] do the job right
[10:38] let's get God's atomic bomb why is it
[10:41] brother eh in his word that's coming mo
[10:47] sickness and devils right left get an
[10:51] item discreetly oh it it's it just
[10:56] destroys it disintegrates every king
[11:00] that's ungodly when that bomb of faith
[11:03] drops in there with the word of God
[11:05] behind it it blows ever devil ever sick
[11:09] he says that right brother branham is
[11:11] why does it own sermon are all others
[11:13] it's because of the channel you can look
[11:17] out and see it but you've got to have it
[11:19] in here looking this away not out there
[11:22] looking in you got the in looking out
[11:24] you can't come through reason you can't
[11:27] come through these other things you've
[11:28] got to come right down God's channel of
[11:30] it right into the soul how do you do it
[11:34] what's the last channel it'll read right

[12:49] conscience memory reasons affections he
[12:52] began to use all those different little
[12:53] channels as long as he could get in
[12:55] above this one here he's got to come in
[12:58] your mind first and you have to accept
[13:00] it he can listen it can batter against
[13:05] you but it can't get to you until you

[13:51] when he was a hundred and she was uh and
[13:53] she was 90 he still he he confessed that
[13:57] God's Word was true and he called those
[14:00] things which were not as though they

[44:17] this morning we greet you all in the
[44:21] name of Jesus Christ
[44:24] you say it again brother Stephen yes it
[44:27] is brother Stephen I spoke to the
[44:35] brother asked them to give me grace to
[44:38] lay this foundation but if anybody's
[44:42] burning the more than welcome to let me
[44:45] know and I will pass the ball so they
[44:49] have now express it you still got me
[44:54] it's just to answer that question that
[44:57] might be lingering somewhere sometime I
[45:06] get your question before you even speak
[45:08] them as they are chapter 40 it's not me
[45:15] I'm not a prophet by the discernment is
[45:19] in the body of the Lord as they are 40
[45:23] you start a little bit late one o'clock
[45:26] show you had plenty come to rest go on
[45:30] sleeping no one snoring so we stay awake
[45:34] just and I'd say put the spiritual
[45:40] jacket you know where we are as they are
[45:42] 40
[45:42] verse three if you dare you can say Amen
[45:51] the voice of him that cries in the
[45:56] wilderness a voice crying it's a person
[46:02] are we there he says a voice but that
[46:06] voice is crying
[46:07] how can a voice cry the voice and the
[46:12] person is same thing the voice of him
[46:16] that cries in the wilderness this person
[46:19] must be in the wilderness so when you
[46:22] see somebody moving in the wilderness
[46:24] you don't know why they go in in the
[46:25] wilderness because prophecy will dictate
[46:28] the event you might be seated as we
[46:31] continue the voice of him that cries in
[46:35] the wilderness prepare you the way of
[46:39] the Lord so there is a voice in the
[46:42] wilderness and the purpose of this voice
[46:45] is to prepare the way of the Lord father
[46:51] I thank you for this anointing repair
[46:56] you the way of the Lord is preparing the
[46:59] way of the Lord you will catch it later
[47:06] make straight in the desert a wilderness
[47:12] the desert same thing a highway for our
[47:16] God so this person is here to prepare
[47:20] the way to make a way for somebody who
[47:24] is coming everybody clear
[47:26] let's go to Malachi 4 remember God
[47:35] is a revelation and he doesn't change
[47:37] but he can add to that revelation to
[47:41] give you more clarity so you can receive
[47:44] the revelation when it comes alaka'i
[47:49] chapter 3 verse 1 if you dare you can
[47:52] say Amen brother David a day for its God
[47:55] behold I will send my messenger now it's
[48:00] talking about a messenger over there he
[48:03] was a voice but this time it's a
[48:05] messenger behold I will send my
[48:09] messenger when we you hear in the
[48:12] message
[48:13] we're talking about the messenger the
[48:15] messenger the messenger we not
[48:17] fabricating stuff brother branham did
[48:20] not fabricated it is in the scripture
[48:23] this man is called a voice this man is
[48:27] called a messenger what a Steven why do
[48:29] you say this man of Isaiah is the same
[48:32] man of Malachi 3 okay I will send my
[48:37] messenger and he shall prepare the way
[48:40] oh I thought he was the voice preparing
[48:44] the way it's the same person are we
[48:50] clear preparing the way of the Lord I
[48:54] will send my messenger and he shall
[48:57] prepare the way before me and the Lord
[49:01] it's very specific now the Lord over
[49:06] there in Isaiah we didn't know who was
[49:08] coming we only knew somebody who was
[49:11] preparing the way for someone who's
[49:13] coming now we know the one who's coming
[49:15] is the Lord he said the Lord whom you
[49:19] seek now not everybody was seeking the
[49:24] Lord remember the history group of
[49:27] people we got the juice we got a
[49:33] Samaritan and we got a Gentile where the
[49:40] god Branham get this stuff if you need a
[49:42] scripture see me I will give it to you
[49:44] everybody there
[49:46] but these group here the gentle we were
[49:49] not waiting for a messiah but they say
[49:53] the Lord whom you seek the one that were
[49:57] seeking a lord to come was the Jews and
[50:01] a Samaritan that's why the woman at the
[50:06] well is Samaritan says that when the
[50:09] Messiah will come
[50:11] are you there so not only were the Jews
[50:14] and this and not only were the Jews only
[50:17] waiting for the Messiah by the Samaritan
[50:21] also was waiting for the Messiah so when
[50:24] they say the Lord whom is sick it is
[50:27] hidden in the thunders when you read it
[50:32] you just see the Lord whom you seek
[50:35] you need a prophet then the Prophet will
[50:40] tell you he was the Jews and the
[50:42] Samaritan that was seeking for the
[50:45] Messiah
[50:46] so this men this Lord this God that is
[50:51] coming up it's telling you he is coming
[50:54] straight to the Jews and Samaritan clear
[50:59] rowdy now you're gonna realize that
[51:03] anointing the Lord whom you seek to
[51:09] nation do you know when this came to me
[51:12] I was sitting right there behind him
[51:17] that's when he drove the Lord whom will
[51:23] seek shall suddenly so you I want you to
[51:28] keep that one the Lord is not coming
[51:31] slowly sudden it's something quick that
[51:36] happened you need to remember that
[51:37] something quick the Lord suddenly so
[51:41] maybe something will be done and
[51:43] suddenly the Lord entered enter way the
[51:48] Lord shall suddenly come to his temple
[51:53] but we know the Messiah was Jesus Christ
[51:56] how many times Jesus went into the
[51:58] temple so many times
[52:01] did Jesus enter into the temple suddenly
[52:04] he was walking that's not a sudden
[52:08] enters but this Lord when he entered in
[52:13] the temple he's entering suddenly so
[52:17] it's a quick work and our Lord is in the
[52:20] temple is that temple a building or is
[52:26] it a person who in the surgery you need
[52:36] to get used to my sense of humor when I
[52:39] say deep water I'm telling you we are I
[52:43] need your attention we are deep in the
[52:46] message when I say put your life jacket
[52:49] all I'm telling you I'm gonna drop deep
[52:52] in the message I need your full
[52:54] attention when I say you were not
[52:57] exposed to this I'm telling you from
[53:00] where we came from I'm not talking about
[53:04] here I'm just clearing the air shall
[53:14] suddenly come to his temple even the
[53:18] messenger again of the Covenant whom you
[53:23] delight in behold he shall come say the
[53:27] Lord of hosts
[53:29] everybody clear now let's go to Malachi
[53:32] 4 next chapter ad if you dare you can
[53:38] say Amen
[53:38] I'm going to read this this entire
[53:41] chapter you need it for behold the day
[53:46] cometh it's a day that cometh that shall
[53:50] burn as an oven so there is a burning
[53:55] connected to this day when John the
[53:59] Baptist come did the earth burn let's
[54:04] continue that shall burn as an oven and
[54:08] all the proud it's talking about people
[54:11] yea and all that do wickedly people
[54:15] shall be stubble and the day that cometh
[54:20] shall burn them up so there will be a
[54:22] burning of people remember when the fire
[54:26] dropped down in the altar of Elijah I
[54:29] hope you follow this theory that fire
[54:33] burned the animal which is the flesh
[54:36] remember that fire also burned the wood
[54:40] which is botany the fire also took care
[54:45] of the stone and a dust everybody there
[54:49] the element of the earth shall melt
[54:51] remember your Bible and he also leaked
[54:55] the water because in Revelation chapter
[54:59] 21 we won't have water the Bible said
[55:03] there will be no sea but I will deal
[55:06] with that one on the mystery of the
[55:09] three heaven then you will see what is
[55:11] the sea okay and there shall come and
[55:17] the day that come shall burn them up
[55:19] saith the lord of hosts and that it
[55:22] shall leave them neither root rather
[55:25] abate if you remember is neither root
[55:28] nor botany botany
[55:31] your branches bodily right no branches
[55:36] but to you that fear my name shall the
[55:42] Sun of righteousness be created you read
[55:52] your Bible it is the rising of the Sun
[55:58] okay it is the rising of the Sun there
[56:03] will be a Sun that gonna rise go to the
[56:06] three mysteries of the mystery of the
[56:10] three heaven you will remember we're not
[56:11] spoke about the Sun there will be a
[56:13] rising of the Sun the Sun of
[56:16] righteousness it's a Sun with
[56:19] righteousness like a judge
[56:23] the Sun of righteousness arise with
[56:26] healing in his wings so this Sun has
[56:31] links you remember in the book of
[56:37] Revelation when we preach about the
[56:40] mystery of the three heaven we spoke
[56:43] about the angel that was standing in the
[56:46] Sun anybody remember that oh my god
[56:51] go listen to the sermon in Revelation
[56:56] there is an angel
[56:57] that was standing in the Sun and we
[57:00] prove to you that dad angels brother
[57:02] branham and God hwadam had a vision
[57:06] where he was spending in the Sun
[57:07] preaching as well so that son had an
[57:12] angel that was standing there and that
[57:15] manger was a prophet so there is a Sun
[57:19] connected to a prophet go listen to the
[57:22] message because I gave you the coat in
[57:24] that message it's on the one drive or
[57:27] something you can see the line everybody
[57:29] there now we see that there is a Sun
[57:32] that is rising up and that Sun for some
[57:35] reason have wings but when Israel was
[57:40] coming out of Egypt the Bible says that
[57:44] God told them that I carry you on the
[57:47] wings of an eagle are either and brother
[57:51] branham said the wings of that ego was
[57:54] Moses are there so those wings who are
[57:59] speaking about a prophet are you there
[58:03] so there will be another son that's
[58:06] gonna rise up with a prophet which
[58:10] connects you to the book of Revelation
[58:12] everybody seen but under the wings of
[58:15] that prophet there will be hearing there
[58:19] will be a gift of healing they will be
[58:22] healing companion shut the Sun of
[58:33] righteousness arise with healing in his
[58:36] wings and you shall go forth and grab as
[58:40] calf of the store but what I'm say
[58:43] that's the Millennium and you shall
[58:46] tread down the wicked for they shall be
[58:50] wantin remember it's burning off flesh
[58:54] right okay it's going to be ashes
[58:58] everything but any life everything ashes
[59:00] and they shall be what ashes under the
[59:04] soul of Europe so when this happened we
[59:11] will again touch the earth with our feet
[59:15] remember the first coming Jesus came the
[59:19] second coming I gave you caught he
[59:22] cannot touch the earth he is going to be
[59:25] staying in the air because we're going
[59:27] to meet him in the air
[59:28] my last week approved to you that when
[59:31] he comes on the third coming his feet
[59:34] are going to be upon the Mount of Olives
[59:37] not only his feet are upon the Mount of
[59:41] Olives but our feet also will be sitting
[59:45] on the earth because when he come in
[59:47] revelation 19 is coming with an army I
[59:51] wish I have four hours then I'll prove
[59:54] to you who is that army are you dead and
[59:59] under the sole of your feet in the day
[1:00:03] that I shall do this say the Lord of
[1:00:07] hosts
[1:00:08] now remember O God what do you want us
[1:00:15] to remember remember Moses my servant
[1:00:24] look at your Baba I don't want you to
[1:00:28] say brother Stephen say
[1:00:30] remember Moses my servant I remember the
[1:00:38] law Malachi 4 applied to the Jews know
[1:00:42] the Jews has Moses and Elijah we prove
[1:00:47] to you but now he's not saying remember
[1:00:51] Moses by remember the rule I know why
[1:00:56] I'm cleaning this up remember the law of
[1:01:00] Moses my servant which are commanded to
[1:01:04] him in Horeb horrid horrid horrible
[1:01:14] I thought God met Moses in Mehsana so
[1:01:20] there is another meeting in Horeb why
[1:01:26] horrible what is in Horeb why does God
[1:01:31] want us to remember God is about to say
[1:01:36] something but God is saying before I
[1:01:41] tell you what I'm trying to tell you I
[1:01:43] want you first to remember montipora
[1:01:50] remember the law I give in lot horrible
[1:01:54] why do we have to remember Horeb what is
[1:01:59] horrible remember the law of Moses my
[1:02:05] servant which are commanded to him in
[1:02:08] Horeb for all Israel with the statute
[1:02:13] and judgment behold behold behold behold
[1:02:20] I will send you Elijah the Prophet
[1:02:26] before he speak about Elijah the prophet
[1:02:30] he said I remember first
[1:02:35] horrible go back to Horeb girl fondant
[1:02:42] what happened in horrible once you get
[1:02:46] that clear then I will send you connect
[1:02:51] that with a larger the profit not just a
[1:02:59] larger why did he have to say a larger
[1:03:04] profit because usually the refer
[1:03:07] emergency emergency but this one he said
[1:03:11] Elijah the prophet why the Prophet why
[1:03:18] not Elijah Elijah the Prophet before the
[1:03:24] coming of the Great and dreadful day of
[1:03:28] the Lord so before that burning Elijah
[1:03:32] will come brother Steven you already
[1:03:35] proved to us last week that Oh Moses and
[1:03:38] Elijah will be there then the earth will
[1:03:40] burn so that's what you mean Roddy no
[1:03:44] problem and he shall turn the water
[1:03:50] do you remember what Elijah did with
[1:03:53] Israel he told Israel come closer to me
[1:03:58] first because he had to turn the heart
[1:04:02] so it's not Scripture were not written
[1:04:06] just like that to turn the heart of the
[1:04:10] father to the children okay and the
[1:04:20] heart of the children to the father it
[1:04:28] looks like it's the same person Lester
[1:04:35] come and smite the earth with a curse
[1:04:40] everybody clear here the Lord
[1:04:44] somebody will prepare the way of the
[1:04:46] Lord that day ooh burn there are people
[1:04:51] Jews and Gentiles that are waiting for
[1:04:52] him and I shall send you Elijah the
[1:04:56] prophet but there is a messenger that's
[1:04:59] gonna come when the messenger cometh the
[1:05:03] Lord will suddenly suddenly suddenly
[1:05:06] enter into his temple everybody clear
[1:05:10] let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank
[1:05:15] you for your grace your love your mercy
[1:05:17] and a full everything you're doing for
[1:05:19] us father we thank you again for giving
[1:05:22] us opportunity to gather together around
[1:05:24] the reveal word of the our Lord we are
[1:05:28] committing ourselves unto the hand and
[1:05:30] the people that are following virtually
[1:05:32] may the Holy Spirit break forth this
[1:05:35] morning Lord and may you teach a word to
[1:05:38] your children Lord father may you heal
[1:05:41] those that are sick may you bind up
[1:05:44] those that have broken hearted Lord may
[1:05:47] you seek those that are lost Lord may
[1:05:50] you open the eyes of those that are
[1:05:52] blinded may you stabilize those that are
[1:05:55] shaking may you feed those that are
[1:05:57] already solid and standing Lord may you
[1:06:00] be the Alpha and the Omega
[1:06:02] this service Lord we move every
[1:06:04] hindrance Lord speak to our soul modely
[1:06:07] in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:06:10] now before we can continue here we are
[1:06:16] on the unchanging pattern of God our
[1:06:20] theme is Malachi 4 part three part eight
[1:06:25] before we begin to where we are going we
[1:06:30] need to clear up something because
[1:06:33] brother Branham say that as usually as
[1:06:36] usually as usual when one regards a
[1:06:41] verse superficial he comes
[1:06:46] with a superficial understanding if you
[1:06:52] look at the verse superficially you
[1:06:55] gonna come up with a superficial
[1:06:58] understanding that's why I say deep deep
[1:07:03] we need to go deep so you can catch not
[1:07:07] the Rhema but the logos the thoughts
[1:07:11] behind the world that is there if you
[1:07:14] just look the Lord whom you seek you
[1:07:17] want to come up and say somebody was
[1:07:19] looking for the Lord when you dig deeper
[1:07:22] then you wanna find out that it's
[1:07:24] talking about two nations the Jews and
[1:07:27] Samaritans everybody clear
[1:07:29] now God's togas in the book of Malachi
[1:07:33] to remember the law that happened in
[1:07:37] Horeb
[1:07:38] I cannot move him without clearing
[1:07:43] horrible this came in last evening
[1:07:47] what is horrible horrible what is it
[1:07:53] more horrible what is it let's take
[1:07:57] Exodus chapter 3 I'm going slowly you
[1:08:03] had plenty time to sleep even if you
[1:08:05] sleep at 3 a.m. you have killed 12 or
[1:08:08] something Exodus chapter 3 if you dare
[1:08:13] you can say Amen unless you work a third
[1:08:18] shift Exodus the to everybody there
[1:08:26] verse 1 now Moses kept the flock of
[1:08:30] Jethro his father-in-law the priest of
[1:08:34] Midian and he led the flock to the
[1:08:37] backside of the desert and came to the
[1:08:42] mountain of God there is a mountain that
[1:08:46] is called the mountain of God a mountain
[1:08:53] of God Martin of God
[1:08:59] what is the mountain of God he said he
[1:09:02] came in the mountain of God even to
[1:09:05] Horeb horrible horrible
[1:09:08] I'm repeating three times because when I
[1:09:10] say he the people are now online are
[1:09:13] missing it when you're saying they can
[1:09:15] catch it so I'm going to start repeating
[1:09:17] so if not I'm putting an emphasis on
[1:09:19] something they came to the mountain of
[1:09:22] God that mountain is called horrible so
[1:09:26] from today Horeb is the mountain of God
[1:09:29] very clear and the angel of the Lord
[1:09:33] appeared to him in a flame of fire out
[1:09:36] of the midst of the bush and he looked
[1:09:40] and behold the bush burn with fire and
[1:09:43] the bush was not consumed and Moses said
[1:09:46] I will now turn aside and see this great
[1:09:49] sight why the bush is not burned and
[1:09:51] when the Lord saw that he turned aside
[1:09:54] to see God called to him out of the
[1:09:58] midst of the bush and said Moses Moses
[1:10:01] and he said Here I am so what I'm trying
[1:10:04] for you to remember here is that in
[1:10:07] Madhav that's where the burning bush
[1:10:11] experience happened so when we usually
[1:10:14] say Moses met the Lord in a pillar of
[1:10:17] fire the burning bush in a burning bush
[1:10:19] it happened in Maude Horeb everybody
[1:10:22] clear
[1:10:22] no problem let's go to at chapter 7 we
[1:10:26] are trying to decode something when once
[1:10:29] we be coded when they say remember
[1:10:32] horrid your mind will not never think
[1:10:36] the same again are we there let's go to
[1:10:39] the book of out to chapter 7 you need to
[1:10:43] keep your Bible it's a combination
[1:10:47] preaching teaching Bible study all of
[1:10:50] them mixed together so it's like a pizza
[1:10:53] you got mushroom where you got tomato
[1:10:58] you got everything
[1:10:59] it's healthy add to chapter 7 everybody
[1:11:04] there verse 29 and flag who Moses
[1:11:12] Moses Moses you know why I'm repeating
[1:11:15] now say he's repeating three times why
[1:11:17] he thinks we'd only signal then fled
[1:11:23] Moses Moses Moses and this saying and
[1:11:27] was a stranger in the land of Midian
[1:11:30] where he is far when where he fathered
[1:11:33] two sons and when forty years were
[1:11:36] expired there appeared to him in the
[1:11:40] wilderness of Martin Mont sana linear
[1:11:46] added Assad here Montana or sometime we
[1:11:51] call sauna with an I so you can see the
[1:11:55] Old Testament sometime I say Elias
[1:11:58] Elijah harass if you need a teaching on
[1:12:02] that you tell me you will see the
[1:12:04] difference are we there then he the Lord
[1:12:08] appeared to him in the wilderness of
[1:12:10] Mount sana an angel of the Lord in a
[1:12:14] flame of fire in the
[1:12:18] thought the mountain was called is
[1:12:29] coming the mountain in other word not
[1:12:34] Horeb is what any question if you need
[1:12:42] more scripture on that you see me our
[1:12:44] Lord you and the Lord appeared to him in
[1:12:48] the wilderness of Mehsana
[1:12:50] an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire
[1:12:52] in a bush when Moses saw it he wondered
[1:12:55] at the sight and as he drew near to
[1:12:58] behold the voice of the Lord came to him
[1:13:00] same story same experience different
[1:13:04] name Mount Horeb and Montana when they
[1:13:08] referred to our sauna they're talking
[1:13:11] about the same thing if you come to the
[1:13:14] book of Exodus when God came down there
[1:13:18] speaking about sauna
[1:13:20] if you go to the book of Deuteronomy the
[1:13:23] gonna tell you the same story but they
[1:13:25] use the name this is the Tron of me you
[1:13:29] need a scripture see me this series
[1:13:32] Exodus
[1:13:33] so when God says remember horrible God
[1:13:40] is telling us go back to the book of I'm
[1:13:48] going slowly are we clear
[1:13:51] so in this mountain Horeb
[1:13:54] God came down when God came down we
[1:14:00] found a man by the name of Moses because
[1:14:05] he says the law of Moses now what
[1:14:09] happened with losses in a horrid because
[1:14:13] we try to see the law of what Moses that
[1:14:16] happened in Horeb we trying to decode
[1:14:19] horrid let's go to Exodus chapter 32
[1:14:30] Exodus chapter 32 I would strongly
[1:14:35] encourage you to watch your Bible
[1:14:37] especially young people watch your Bible
[1:14:42] the devil is trying to destroy the next
[1:14:45] generation Exodus 32 verse 15 if you
[1:14:50] dare you can say Amen alright what
[1:14:53] happened and Moses turned and went down
[1:14:57] from the mountain from the Mount
[1:15:00] everybody there and the truth table of
[1:15:04] the testimony were in his hand so when
[1:15:08] was his wife covered it God gave him to
[1:15:11] table of the law everybody clear ok no
[1:15:15] problem
[1:15:16] the truth table of the testimony were in
[1:15:19] his hand the turbo we're waiting on
[1:15:22] buffs their side on the one side and on
[1:15:25] the other were they written I want you
[1:15:28] to notice verse 16 everybody sleep
[1:15:32] everybody clear
[1:15:35] where the work of Moses the work of God
[1:15:40] I did where the work of God and the
[1:15:45] writing was the writing of Moses the
[1:15:49] worries of God God God graven upon the
[1:15:54] table so first of all we found out that
[1:15:58] the two table were given by Moses but
[1:16:01] when those stable were given by Moses
[1:16:04] but the work of those table everybody
[1:16:08] following me and the writing of those
[1:16:11] table were done by who in other word man
[1:16:16] had nothing to do with this part of the
[1:16:21] world of the table idea and Robbie has
[1:16:29] no input into it it is completely
[1:16:34] written given man by God
[1:16:39] everybody clear for his God job to verse
[1:16:43] 19 Alleluia
[1:16:45] and he came to pass as soon as he came
[1:16:49] near to the camp that he saw the calf
[1:16:53] Israel was in a Dollar Tree
[1:16:55] are you there and they're dancing and
[1:16:58] Moses anger was hot
[1:17:01] gangrene and he cast the table out of
[1:17:04] his hand and broke them beneath them if
[1:17:08] you study you will see that underneath
[1:17:11] this mountain there was an altar and it
[1:17:16] was in that water that Moses crushing
[1:17:19] everything everybody clear
[1:17:21] so this first table here that was borne
[1:17:26] by God written by God was destroyed
[1:17:31] because of idolatry
[1:17:34] are we there okay
[1:17:37] we trying to decode Exodus let's go to
[1:17:41] Exodus 34 if you dare you can say Amen
[1:17:47] Exodus 34 verse 1 and the Lord said to
[1:17:53] Moses everybody you knew you'd ever go
[1:18:02] cut out to table the second table of the
[1:18:08] law have the work of the hand of him or
[1:18:16] the head of the Prophet everybody here
[1:18:20] the Prophet went and the prophet has to
[1:18:25] take it - and that - must be sharp and
[1:18:29] go to the rock and begin to cut the rock
[1:18:33] but a Robert hope you are they I can I
[1:18:40] can hear the damn man everybody there he
[1:18:48] was a red beacon and he was the one I
[1:18:49] was referring to all the time so just
[1:18:52] bear with me and the Lord said what a
[1:18:58] random say be you and people who know
[1:19:01] how to deal with you okay
[1:19:04] and the Lord said to Moses you out
[1:19:07] cannot - table of what stone like to the
[1:19:12] first don't make a difference and I will
[1:19:17] write upon this table the words that
[1:19:22] were in the first table the word on the
[1:19:27] second table is the work of the prophet
[1:19:30] Moses by deriving the interpretation
[1:19:37] again because right here they give to
[1:19:41] love this table with riding on it but
[1:19:45] the second table of the law
[1:19:51] [Music]
[1:19:53] are we clear Samar's this one to God
[1:19:59] with table with stone without any
[1:20:03] Scripture under stoner everybody
[1:20:07] following me and he was God who come to
[1:20:11] interpret again to interpret the stone
[1:20:18] without writing but following me but the
[1:20:23] interpretation not respond contradict
[1:20:28] the first table of the law let me start
[1:20:34] it again
[1:20:36] the first level God did it
[1:20:40] God wrote on Normandie the second one
[1:20:44] moses cut the table Moses had the tool
[1:20:49] in his hand he caught the table and then
[1:20:53] when he cut the table there was nothing
[1:20:56] written on that table he has to go into
[1:21:01] the mountain for God to give them to him
[1:21:04] the interpretation of they are written
[1:21:08] slowly the director protection is
[1:21:12] exactly line up with the first stone
[1:21:19] hallelujah God writing we okay but
[1:21:25] Elijah is it clear are they okay and be
[1:21:33] ready in the morning and come up into
[1:21:36] the month morning to the mountain which
[1:21:38] mountain everybody clear
[1:21:41] okay we know that is home and present
[1:21:45] yourself there to me in what in the top
[1:21:49] of the mountain of the month and no man
[1:21:55] shall come up with you Moses must be
[1:21:59] wrong
[1:22:02] the prophet Moses must be on top of the
[1:22:07] mountain alone when he goes for God to
[1:22:13] interpret the stone they have no riding
[1:22:17] on it he must be alone and no man shall
[1:22:27] come up with you neither let any man be
[1:22:30] seen to out of the mountain
[1:22:32] neither led the flock nor heard feet
[1:22:34] before the mountain and he you who you'd
[1:22:38] Moses to table of stone like today
[1:22:44] whatever Moses is doing he already have
[1:22:47] a reference he saw the first table and
[1:22:51] when Moses is cutting out he must make
[1:22:55] sure he line up with the first one
[1:22:58] hallelujah and Moses rose up early in
[1:23:03] the morning and Juana and went up to
[1:23:05] mung sana as the Lord has commanded him
[1:23:08] and took in his hand to table of stone
[1:23:12] do they have writing no everybody clear
[1:23:15] and the Lord descended in there
[1:23:19] so when Moses goes over there with that
[1:23:23] stone that is now written there is a
[1:23:26] cloud that's gonna come down on the
[1:23:30] mountain if you have not caught it yet
[1:23:35] just keep your seat belt
[1:23:38] this message is perfectly line up with
[1:23:43] the Bible where God and the Lord
[1:23:50] descended in the cloud and the Lord
[1:23:53] descended in the rocket and the Lord
[1:24:05] descended in the cloud
[1:24:08] and stood with him day and proclaim the
[1:24:12] name of the Lord
[1:24:14] let's job to verse 27 and the Lord said
[1:24:19] to Moses write you this word for after
[1:24:23] the tenor of this word I have made a
[1:24:26] covenant with you and with Israel and he
[1:24:29] was there with the Lord how many days
[1:24:32] let me write it here 40 days and what
[1:24:36] else 40 night
[1:24:39] so in horrible we have 40 days 40 night
[1:24:45] of Moses big winner Martin everybody
[1:24:50] follow we meet he did eat bread he
[1:24:55] neither eat bread nor drink water and he
[1:24:59] worked upon the table the word of the
[1:25:02] Covenant the Ten Commandment did Moses
[1:25:05] it no eating no drinking
[1:25:12] so no eating no drinking for forty days
[1:25:18] and no problem now let's see what's
[1:25:25] going on here how about when a little
[1:25:29] minister friend of eICU associate sister
[1:25:32] church junior Jackson come running up to
[1:25:36] us one night me down there say a head a
[1:25:41] dream Gino Jackson had a dream brother
[1:25:44] Branham that is bothering me I've seen
[1:25:47] all the Brethren gather upon a hill
[1:25:50] everybody following me and said upon
[1:25:54] this hill this Martin there you are
[1:25:56] teaching brother Branham was standing in
[1:26:00] the mountain teaching you are teaching
[1:26:03] us out of the letter that was work so we
[1:26:08] found out that in the vision of junior
[1:26:11] Jackson junior Jackson saw a big
[1:26:14] mountain and the mountain has leather
[1:26:17] already
[1:26:18] wheatondale there was a stone right here
[1:26:22] a mountain and they were the mountain
[1:26:26] but this letter pre-existed before
[1:26:30] brother branham get a holiday he was not
[1:26:34] the work of brother branham brother
[1:26:37] branham did not create the mountain is
[1:26:41] not right the letter in the mantle
[1:26:43] brother branham was only interpreting
[1:26:46] the letter Devils are already in the
[1:26:49] mountain hallelujah
[1:26:53] upon a hill you were teaching us out of
[1:26:57] letter that was world would look like in
[1:27:01] some letters that time he was before
[1:27:05] credible times had carved out he was not
[1:27:10] random Tom's have called out in the
[1:27:16] scripture in the rock okay when you
[1:27:24] finish that when bran randon finish
[1:27:28] interpreting that all Devils finish you
[1:27:33] told us say what when Elijah was about
[1:27:40] to start his show in the Bible he told
[1:27:42] Israel come water any question I will
[1:27:52] then do you see why we have to teach the
[1:27:54] way we go
[1:27:55] okay now come close and we we some of us
[1:28:01] and some of us and we will Elijah told
[1:28:07] Israel to come the Bible saying what or
[1:28:10] Israel gather together you remember now
[1:28:14] and we all gather up and you wish he
[1:28:20] finished with the first part which is
[1:28:22] the storm with the riding which is the
[1:28:26] first table which is the first table
[1:28:31] the help writing he finished with that
[1:28:35] everybody else then he moves to the
[1:28:39] second part then you reach from
[1:28:43] somewhere look like you got a clever
[1:28:47] brother branham got an instrument like a
[1:28:53] chroma in this not a clever akuaba is
[1:28:58] used to remove now but this look like a
[1:29:02] crowbar and a crowbar in the middle
[1:29:06] again then with the crowbar
[1:29:11] you will brother branham cut that stone
[1:29:17] everybody clear the first part written
[1:29:21] by God created by God but the second
[1:29:25] part the hang of the Prophet is holding
[1:29:29] an instrument and the Prophet is
[1:29:32] carrying the rock everybody clear and
[1:29:37] then you whip the top of this little
[1:29:41] pyramid open and when you did say
[1:29:46] granite rock with everybody clear when
[1:29:53] Moses cut the second table there was no
[1:29:58] writing on I am going slowly okay no
[1:30:04] writing on it as you told us to look
[1:30:07] upon this and notice he was going toward
[1:30:12] the west just as hard as you could
[1:30:17] toward the serving of the Sun a larger
[1:30:22] in the Bible weather until their
[1:30:24] offering of the evening sacrifice when
[1:30:28] the Sun is felling praise the Lord and I
[1:30:33] stood there a little bit till the Holy
[1:30:37] Spirit will fill this vision are you
[1:30:40] there what is the real in spirit say I
[1:30:43] said
[1:30:45] the bubble so this mountain with
[1:30:52] scriptures that were written before is
[1:30:55] your bubble but a Stephen say is brother
[1:31:04] branham himself who said that the entire
[1:31:07] bible as much as been revealed to men
[1:31:12] through justification sanctification the
[1:31:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism in
[1:31:19] jesus name and all these things has been
[1:31:22] so the first part of mother Branham
[1:31:26] ministry is to interpret the Bible are
[1:31:32] there but there is secret that is the
[1:31:39] Bible in such Department today because
[1:31:45] the Bible is sealed with seven seals I
[1:31:49] must go there to the west to find out
[1:31:53] what is the interpretation of the are
[1:31:57] written stone everybody clear Vera
[1:32:04] Branagh and notice the next thing now I
[1:32:07] took some kind of what about El Paradis
[1:32:12] Moses carried off second stage and on
[1:32:17] the inside of the rock they had nothing
[1:32:23] the second table
[1:32:25] nothing Raja Bullett and Adam have
[1:32:31] started to the west and I told them all
[1:32:35] I said don't go out west stay here and
[1:32:38] look on this till I return when once for
[1:32:43] what West so that blood there is a panda
[1:32:49] that comes me
[1:32:51] return back to the east after the
[1:32:55] experience of God coming down in a
[1:32:58] mountain on the cloud are you deaf
[1:33:01] with the Holy Spirit interpreting the
[1:33:06] our weekly world that's why when
[1:33:12] somebody came to brother Branham he said
[1:33:14] brother Branham this seven thunders are
[1:33:17] there gonna be something outside the
[1:33:20] Bible
[1:33:20] we're gonna say no you cannot add or
[1:33:24] take away from the Bible it is something
[1:33:27] that is in the Bible it was just hidden
[1:33:31] in other words the revelation of this
[1:33:35] message can never contradict the Bible
[1:33:38] because Moses when he went in with
[1:33:41] second he got to make sure whatever he
[1:33:45] does here much as the first table of
[1:33:48] shown we fear
[1:33:52] praise God will happen in Horeb that we
[1:33:57] need to remember jr. Jackson listening
[1:34:02] you remember the dream he had that I
[1:34:06] interpreted going toward the Setting Sun
[1:34:09] and this happened on on Sunset Mountain
[1:34:15] it is evening time Elijah waited until
[1:34:20] the offering of the evening sacrifice it
[1:34:23] is a fleeton sunset on dissociate
[1:34:28] message and it shall be light at the
[1:34:31] evening time upon sunset mountain in the
[1:34:34] Coronado forest remember the law of
[1:34:42] Moses on Mount Horeb
[1:34:45] then I will send you Elijah the Prophet
[1:34:52] everybody clear God to the pedicle
[1:34:58] structure this day the restoration of
[1:35:01] the gift my lord those men may be some
[1:35:05] present here some of them hearing the
[1:35:08] tape around the world many realize that
[1:35:12] this is the calling out of the blood not
[1:35:17] a pelican message you cannot step on
[1:35:24] this pulpit and begin to preach to us
[1:35:27] the message it parts for coming he said
[1:35:38] brother Steven Sasha I'm sorry I heard
[1:35:42] what happened to you is this true I say
[1:35:45] yes that's true what are you doing I say
[1:35:47] we got going together he say I was
[1:35:50] planning on a trip to come meet with you
[1:35:53] if I come will receive him I say as long
[1:35:56] as you preach the message don't get here
[1:36:05] and preach Baptist doctrine the preach
[1:36:10] metal destruction this is not a
[1:36:14] permaculture message the Pentecostal
[1:36:21] message wants to restore the gift back
[1:36:24] to the church but this is the calling
[1:36:27] forth of the blood another message that
[1:36:31] was just those two come just before
[1:36:34] so the wants to be that they shall burn
[1:36:39] like an orphan let them understand dear
[1:36:43] God
[1:36:44] first I believe this because it's
[1:36:47] revealed by your spirit though through
[1:36:50] the Word of God he has been vindicated
[1:36:52] and made manifest to the whole world
[1:36:55] certainly Lord in the minority always
[1:36:59] your group are that way when the Holy
[1:37:05] Spirit shall come he will glorify me
[1:37:08] what does glorify me Jesus
[1:37:14] you are the mad God you are the Prince
[1:37:16] of Peace you are the everlasting father
[1:37:18] you are the principal and acosta do that
[1:37:22] but that Jesus is the mighty God is them
[1:37:29] chemicals that do that what is glorified
[1:37:35] me Jesus said father the hour has come
[1:37:41] glorify thy self and the voice said I
[1:37:46] have glorified you and I will glorify
[1:37:48] you again when Jesus was working was he
[1:37:53] saying I am the mighty God
[1:37:55] I am the magic God this is a different
[1:38:04] message let's take the economy chapter
[1:38:07] father I have not even started autonomy
[1:38:16] chapter 5 we still
[1:38:22] according Horeb everybody there
[1:38:25] everybody there
[1:38:29] Chapter two everybody there the Lord our
[1:38:35] God made a covenant with us in her
[1:38:39] horrible horrible buddy seat do you see
[1:38:43] a bubble in horrid they Lord learned not

[2:13:42] right you ready
[2:13:50] the holy let me say this a whirlwind is
[2:13:59] the manifestation of God I hope together
[2:14:05] at under blasting it is the
[2:14:08] manifestation of God go with brother
[2:14:12] bran Rock flangers where God is
[2:14:17] manifesting his power are they can't
[2:14:22] quite put it God it's a manifestation of
[2:14:26] God the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost I hope
[2:14:36] I can get this straight
[2:14:38] praise God the Holy Ghost can make you
[2:14:43] speak in town you gather
[2:14:51] the Holy Ghost can make you professor
[2:14:57] you got it
[2:14:58] the Holy Ghost can make you to cast out
[2:15:01] the devil but a Brian speaking in
[2:15:07] tongues is not the evidence that you
[2:15:11] have the Holy Ghost the Lord passed by
[2:15:20] but the Lord was not in it
[2:15:27] prophesied in the Holy Ghost can make
[2:15:31] you prophesy but prophesy does not mean
[2:15:35] you have the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[2:15:40] can make you cast out Devils
[2:15:42] but everybody that cast ever have the
[2:15:47] Holy Ghost in that day they shall say
[2:15:53] Lord Lord have we not prophesied in
[2:15:56] earnest
[2:15:57] have we not cast out the devil in your
[2:16:00] name have we not speaking in tongue in
[2:16:02] you name the Lord was not there yet the
[2:16:06] Lord was the one speaking in town the
[2:16:09] Lord can make you prophesy the Lord can
[2:16:12] make you cast a devil but this is not
[2:16:15] where you focus the Lord is not there
[2:16:19] any question that interpretation came
[2:16:23] before I came to church this message is
[2:16:32] deeper than you think opening of the
[2:16:38] Seventh Seal the Bible it's a new book
[2:16:41] you don't preach like Pentecostal it's a
[2:16:47] different sound when you start preaching
[2:16:49] the message it takes you into a
[2:16:51] different level you cannot preach the
[2:16:55] message and you standing Baptist
[2:16:59] whether you an evangelist whether you a
[2:17:03] teacher whether you have profit whether
[2:17:05] you have pastor whether you an apostle
[2:17:08] when the sound of this message is going
[2:17:10] forth you going to sound different verse
[2:17:19] 11 and he said I'm going to stop in this
[2:17:23] slide I know I can God go Father
[2:17:25] and he said go forth and stand up on the
[2:17:29] mound behold the Lord and behold the
[2:17:32] Lord passed by and a great and strong
[2:17:35] wind went the rock the mantle and broke
[2:17:38] in the pieces the rocks before the Lord
[2:17:39] but the Lord was not in the wind you
[2:17:41] understand what it means that it was God
[2:17:44] doing that but don't get caught up there
[2:17:47] because the devil can impersonate there
[2:17:51] is an impersonal figuration of the first
[2:17:53] and the second pool don't get caught up
[2:17:55] they listen to the still and small
[2:17:59] that's where you need to catch yes what
[2:18:10] is your voice what is your voice
[2:18:15] good and spirits in good song what is
[2:18:18] your force but they're singing good what
[2:18:23] is the force are you there
[2:18:27] the rock and God was not in the
[2:18:30] earthquake but the Lord was not in the
[2:18:32] earthquake verse 12 and after the
[2:18:34] earthquake or fire my god after the fire
[2:18:47] ha but it's even higher we are talking
[2:18:51] about seven angels will win seven angels

[2:27:24] Fleming and brother Branham say when
[2:27:28] this angel were going up this flame what
[2:27:33] is what a bottom called the angel aflame
[2:27:35] why did the scripture say a flaming fire

[2:29:07] mighty angel they are talking about one
[2:29:11] here but that one has others with him
[2:29:15] but in Revelation 10 they are doing the
[2:29:19] attention to all of them being that's
[2:29:22] why brother Branham say when I enter the
[2:29:24] constellation one of them was looking at
[2:29:26] me with a chest like this that's the one
[2:29:29] they have the seventh year that's the

[2:38:07] when we were having our convention areas
[2:38:10] last time I was going through something
[2:38:13] with the man who led me to the message
[2:38:17] he was attempting to explain to me that
[2:38:21] it was wrong it was false and it and in
[2:38:27] the other church as I was leading
[2:38:28] singing one time I made a statement how
[2:38:31] could anybody that has seen this message
[2:38:37] turn their back up he wanted to meet
[2:38:44] with us and know he said I feel
[2:38:47] responsible for leading you to this
[2:38:48] message and now it's it's such a great
[2:38:51] deception he says I need time to to make
[2:38:55] it right and I was thinking wow and I
[2:39:02] told him I don't have a revelation that
[2:39:05] brother Branham was not a prophet I
[2:39:08] still do I wanted to sing this song at
[2:39:14] the end of this service
[2:39:15] [Music]
