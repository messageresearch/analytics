then we'll um i've got a one prayer request here okay sister yo you bet you can't help but can you gotta sing don't you it's because of seniors it doesn't matter about it [Music] um this happened [Music] was a week ago sunday um after we heard what we heard about the rainbow what brother stephen was bringing out and um i went home and my wife had uh dinner on the table and um i and she said she was going to go lay down and she would do the dishes when she got up well she went laying down and it was raining outside and um i said well i'll just go ahead and do the dishes for her so she wouldn't have to deal with it so i'm staying and right above our sink there is a window it looks out over the backyard and it is pouring down raining and i'm thinking of brother branham when sister media was all upset and you know he went and washed the dishes for that's what i was thinking about and like i was looking out there and thinking about this and it was pouring raining and all of a sudden the sun came out right there above the window and i'm thinking well there's a rainbow somewhere okay so i go and i open my front door you got that up there brother this is what i say i've never seen one that low to go to the ground a full rainbow i'm telling you brother and sister i had a jubilee right there and i yeah and after what we heard that sunday i just wanted to share that with you all because i don't believe that this was just for me this was for all of us you know to verify what we're hearing yes so i just wanted to share that with y'all it was that top half too here's the top half made it made the other half of the perfection amen praise god amen amen that's wonderful i have one prayer request here the um the asker is remaining confidential so we'll respect that um because god knows uh it says keep keep them in prayer it's a michelle a ricky a stacy and a cameron so if one of y'all each can just grab a name amen and just hold on to it as brother sam do you mind coming

we can't shout loud enough we can't clap our hands hard enough we can't sing any deeper from the depths of our heart but lord jesus just to think lord god that coming to meet you is just any time now all the signs satan just pressing in in the government and the social world in the political world in the in the ecclesiastical world he's getting everything all just arranged for his kingdom father but lord jesus that kingdom will bow that kingdom will bow lord god and lord sister teresa reminded me coming down the road that there's nothing that's above our god nothing lord jesus we don't have to worry about anything every kingdom will bow to this kingdom we we have nothing to fear the children of god should be so relaxed lord father i believe we're coming to that place that that the hebrew children had when they could walk into the fiery furnace and say i don't know whether our god's going to deliver us i know that he can but whether he will or whether he won't i don't know but it doesn't matter we're not going to bow to their to your image oh lord god and the faith that daniel had in the lion's den oh lord jesus that faith will be here when you return lord it's our commitment to you father as we sit here and we hear the words that come across this pulpit and we're just mesmerized lord god we're just so thankful father you're mindful to teach us these things and lord when i think of the dedication that the pastor puts out lord god and i know i've communicated with them at two o'clock in the morning three o'clock in the morning just send them a text and before i know it there's a response back up studying that late at night it just makes me feel lord how much more dedicated should i be lord how much more consecrated to the cause lord lord jesus we may not be 120 lord
