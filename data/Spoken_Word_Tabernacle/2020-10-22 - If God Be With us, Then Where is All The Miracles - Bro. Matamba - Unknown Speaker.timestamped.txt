[19:17] now uh we had quite a time trying to get
[19:20] here
[19:21] from charlotte and the 85 was
[19:25] blocked and so forth and and i asked the
[19:28] police officer what's the matter is that
[19:30] the president is in town and
[19:33] uh but he encouraged me that if you'll
[19:36] just wait here a little bit

[20:00] certainly appreciate
[20:01] brother stephen giving me the
[20:02] opportunity to come
[20:04] and i really appreciate brother stephen
[20:07] i
[20:07] i remember when he first came from the
[20:09] congo and very young
[20:11] and i could see that love for the word
[20:13] of god was there
[20:15] and i knew the lord had something in
[20:17] store for the young man
[20:19] so we thank the lord that he has given
[20:22] him this
[20:23] wonderful wonderful ministry my god my
[20:26] god when he came
[20:27] and spoke for us a few times you know
[20:29] the people who you know follow us online
[20:31] they say
[20:32] who was that preacher who preached that
[20:33] wednesday night i said
[20:35] brother stephen shame said oh that was
[20:37] magnificent
[20:38] so we certainly thank the lord for this
[20:40] ministry
[20:41] it's not his ministry it's me the
[20:44] ministry of the lord jesus christ
[20:46] and we all are the beneficiaries of that
[20:48] ministry
[20:50] and we thank the lord for that and so
[20:53] tonight just uh just to get acquainted a
[20:55] little bit with the place and
[20:57] you know uh we're not going to be
[20:59] lengthy i know it's wednesday night
[21:01] but it's just good to see all the folks
[21:03] here
[21:04] my pressing the battle knowing the
[21:07] coming of the lord is very near
[21:10] so let's just read for a little short
[21:12] talk here
[21:13] on gideon in the book of judges chapter
[21:16] 6
[21:19] praise the name of the lord
[21:25] gideon chapter 6 i mean judges chapter
[21:28] 6. and
[21:30] we'll take from verse 1.
[21:40] and if you're there say amen praise god
[21:45] and the children of israel did evil in
[21:47] the sight of the lord and the lord
[21:48] delivered them into the hand of the
[21:50] midian
[21:50] seven years and the hand of the of media
[21:53] prevailed against israel
[21:55] and because of the media knights the
[21:57] children of israel made them the dens
[22:00] which are in the mountains and caves and
[22:02] strongholds
[22:03] and so it was when israel had sown that
[22:07] the midianites came up and the
[22:09] amalekites and the children of the east
[22:11] even they came up against them
[22:13] and they encamped against them and
[22:16] destroyed the increase of the earth
[22:18] till thou come unto gaza and left no
[22:20] sustenance for israel
[22:22] neither sheep nor ox nor ass for they
[22:25] came
[22:26] up with their cattle and their tents and
[22:28] they came as grasshoppers
[22:30] for multitude for both they and their
[22:33] camels were without number
[22:35] and they entered into the land to
[22:36] destroy it israel was greatly
[22:38] impoverished because of the medianites
[22:41] and the children of israel cried unto
[22:42] the lord oh
[22:44] my mom i watch out now when the people
[22:46] of god go to crying unto the lord
[22:49] something happens always no matter how
[22:53] fallen we are
[22:54] when we can just turn and begin to cry
[22:56] unto the lord
[22:58] something always happens see
[23:01] and uh verse 7 and it came to pass when
[23:03] the children of israel cried unto the
[23:04] lord
[23:05] because of the midianites that the lord
[23:07] sent a
[23:08] prophet unto the children of israel
[23:13] which said unto them thus saith the lord
[23:16] god of israel
[23:17] i brought you up from egypt and brought
[23:19] you forth out of the house of bondage
[23:21] and i delivered you out of the hand of
[23:23] the egyptians
[23:24] and out of the hand of of all that
[23:27] oppressed you
[23:28] and drave them out from before you and
[23:30] gave
[23:31] them gave you their land and
[23:34] i said unto you i am the lord your god
[23:37] fear not the gods of the amorites
[23:40] in whose land you dwell but ye have not
[23:43] obeyed my voice
[23:46] now verse 11 and there came an angel of
[23:49] the lord
[23:50] and sat under the oak which was in
[23:53] ophra that pertained unto josh
[23:56] the abyr abby's right and his son
[24:00] gideon thrashed wheat by the wine press
[24:03] to hide it from the midianites
[24:05] may the lord bless the reading of his
[24:07] word you may be seated
[24:10] so just for a little talk tonight we
[24:12] want to look at gideon the prophet
[24:14] preached a message called
[24:16] if god be with us where are all the
[24:19] miracles
[24:22] if god be with us where are all the
[24:25] miracles
[24:27] because god himself is a miracle
[24:31] you and i we are standing upon this
[24:33] earth
[24:34] which is a miracle because
[24:37] where does it hang we think we are on
[24:40] the top of the earth if you go down
[24:41] there those fellows think they are on
[24:43] the top of the earth
[24:44] so so this is a miracle there was a time
[24:48] when there was nothing no creation
[24:51] nothing at all and that's beyond
[24:54] conception
[24:56] there was not even space there was
[24:58] nothing at all but yet
[25:00] before that time god was
[25:04] see he never had a beginning he never
[25:06] will have an ending
[25:08] if you don't believe in him it doesn't
[25:10] bother him because it doesn't diminish
[25:12] him god is before there was an atheist
[25:16] god was
[25:17] hallelujah see he he has no beginning of
[25:22] days he has no ending of life
[25:24] he is god and he he
[25:28] is waiting for somebody that will
[25:30] believe him
[25:32] amen see jesus christ said in yet

[30:05] hands unto the lord
[30:07] if it seems evil to you to stand up and
[30:10] say
[30:11] amen to the word then make your choice
[30:15] oh we don't want to go back to
[30:16] catholicism we don't want that
[30:21] we want freedom
[30:23] [Applause]
[30:25] blessed be the name of the lord we want
[30:27] freedom
[30:29] to worship the lord i remember my
[30:32] brother jewel forney when he told
[30:33] when i met him years and years ago he
[30:36] told me brother matamba
[30:39] you know that i used to have
[30:42] friends white friends
[30:45] black friends when i was in the world
[30:47] and we used to get drunk
[30:50] and when we would get drunk we would all
[30:52] act the same way
[30:55] the black and the white we would all act
[30:57] the same way
[30:59] is that true or not true he says but if
[31:02] you be drunk and the holy ghost
[31:04] how come there is a special holy ghost
[31:06] for the blacks and the special holy
[31:07] ghost for
[31:08] the white and the special holy ghost for
[31:10] this
[31:12] if you are drunk you are drunk doesn't
[31:15] matter what color of your skin
[31:17] hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the
[31:20] lord
[31:22] drunk people do not control themselves
[31:25] they are under the control the prophet
[31:28] of god says don't you say i got the holy
[31:30] ghost
[31:31] you should say the holy ghost got me
[31:34] praise god praise the lord
[31:38] you know brings to my memory a story of
[31:41] our
[31:42] i believe it was brother hiddlebrand up
[31:44] in canada i came down here in south
[31:45] carolina in north carolina many years
[31:46] ago and told a story
[31:48] of a little uh mouse
[31:52] a little mouse that was being chased by
[31:54] a cat
[31:57] and this mouse thought my life is in
[31:59] jeopardy
[32:01] and all of a sudden he finds a bottle
[32:04] and that bottle was just
[32:05] the opening of it was just big enough
[32:06] for the mouse to squeeze right in there
[32:10] and the cat was left outside but in
[32:13] there was a little
[32:14] remnant of some alcohol and when the
[32:17] mouse got to breathing
[32:20] see the alcohol was getting in the
[32:21] system the alcohol was getting in the
[32:23] system
[32:24] and after a while he began to feel so
[32:26] good inside the bottle
[32:29] and you're going to feel so good that
[32:31] the bottle became too small
[32:33] he said let me get out of this place and
[32:35] when he got out of the place
[32:37] where's this cat that was following me
[32:40] where's this cat that was chasing me
[32:42] and the cat looked never seen a mouse
[32:45] following a cat
[32:46] and the cat took off and ran away why
[32:50] that mouse was not in its right mind
[32:53] because it had been drunk and brother
[32:56] sister
[32:57] oh glory to god there was a bunch of
[33:00] people
[33:01] they were cowards they were in the upper
[33:04] room
[33:05] they were waiting on a promise
[33:07] hallelujah
[33:08] and all of a sudden there came a
[33:10] stimulation from heaven
[33:13] they came wine from heaven they were
[33:16] filled with a wine
[33:18] and the place got too small for them
[33:21] where's that old pharisee that was
[33:22] following me glory to god
[33:26] peter said hearken unto my words why
[33:30] he wasn't himself no more he was drunk
[33:33] with the holy ghost
[33:35] glory to god and that's what we need
[33:38] we need to be drunk on the holy spirit
[33:43] glory to god thank you jesus
[33:48] and so we find out my friends that
[33:51] joshua told them
[33:54] make up your mind if you want to stay
[33:57] dead as it were in need that's your
[33:59] choice
[34:00] but as for me and my house
[34:03] [Music]
[34:03] [Applause]
[34:05] we will serve the lord as for me in my
[34:09] house
[34:10] we will serve the lord hallelujah
[34:14] and you see the people said we will
[34:15] serve the lord too
[34:17] but it wasn't long until they and so
[34:20] forth and we find here and
[34:22] they were slaves practically to the
[34:24] midianites
[34:26] they would plant their crops and the
[34:27] medianites would come and oh my take
[34:30] all of it away and this is israelites
[34:34] these are children of the promise seed
[34:37] of abraham
[34:39] that god sent the promise that i'll
[34:41] bring them out
[34:43] i'll give them a choice land i took a
[34:46] vine out of egypt
[34:47] i have planted my vine in a choice spot
[34:51] and here they are afraid of the
[34:54] midianites
[34:56] we find gideon here he was actually
[34:59] threshing with hiding so the midnights
[35:02] wouldn't see him
[35:04] oh my my my my and so
[35:07] as i told you before the bible says
[35:10] they that call upon the name of the lord
[35:13] they shall be delivered and that's one
[35:16] lesson we have to learn
[35:18] we have to call on the lord
[35:21] that's god's principle we have to pray
[35:25] we have to call on the lord hallelujah
[35:28] here's a man that was perishing
[35:32] he was sinking peter
[35:36] on the water and the bible never says
[35:39] jesus rushed to him hey
[35:41] no jesus waited
[35:44] until peter said what lord save me
[35:49] lord save me we have to learn to call on
[35:54] the lord
[35:55] lord i need you lord help me
[35:59] hallelujah and when israel got to crying
[36:02] unto the lord
[36:04] my my mind the bible says that the lord
[36:07] sent a prophet
[36:11] unto the children of israel and we find
[36:14] that we don't know the name of this
[36:15] prophet
[36:17] the lord never told us the name of this
[36:19] prophet this is in the book of judges
[36:22] because we know after judges the first
[36:24] prophet we know of always samuel
[36:26] is that right but here's a prophet
[36:28] unnamed
[36:30] because it doesn't even matter it's the
[36:32] word that he has
[36:34] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[36:37] lord
[36:38] and now the prophet of the lord says
[36:40] this here let's just get this real quick
[36:43] here
[36:44] a prophet says my my my my now
[36:49] now and he began to show them what was
[36:52] taking place and immediately
[36:55] god came on the scene
[36:58] immediately after the prophet's message
[37:03] and it's always been the god
[37:07] now remember god moves
[37:10] behind the prophet
[37:13] if the prophets got the word of the lord
[37:16] amen for my word will not return to me
[37:20] void but it'll accomplish that from for
[37:23] which
[37:23] it was sent and remember see
[37:27] oh don't miss this
[37:30] after the prophet's message
[37:33] god steps on the scene and the prophet
[37:37] says what for
[37:39] to get in the word
[37:42] and activate the word
[37:46] not in everybody but in the ones
[37:49] that believe that word
[37:52] hallelujah see oh
[37:56] my see notice now
[37:59] every time after the prophet's message
[38:03] god himself steps on the scene
[38:07] now watch the scripture here judges
[38:08] chapter six
[38:10] it says this verse uh
[38:15] verse 10.
[38:18] and i said unto you i am the lord your
[38:20] god fear not the gods of the amorites
[38:23] in whose land you dwell but ye have not
[38:25] obeyed my voice
[38:28] the prophet now this is have having not
[38:31] sent thee 1962 january 24th
[38:34] so god spoke to this prophet and the
[38:36] midianites had taken
[38:38] all they had and they were starving to
[38:40] death
[38:42] and he said don't you remember that i'm
[38:45] the god that brought you
[38:46] up out of egypt don't you know
[38:50] that i performed all my miracles down in
[38:52] egypt
[38:54] don't you know i opened up the red sea
[38:57] i fed your fathers for 40 years in the
[38:59] wilderness
[39:01] i broke up the enemies around them did
[39:04] not i
[39:04] take out the amalekites and everything
[39:06] else from before you
[39:08] i am the lord just
[39:11] turn back to me hallelujah
[39:15] just come back to the word i am the one
[39:20] hallelujah that brought the mighty
[39:23] miracles in the life of the prophet
[39:27] amen i am the one that brought the seven
[39:31] angels over arizona
[39:35] i am the one that raised the dead from
[39:37] the floor
[39:39] and i am still god
[39:42] and after my prophet's message
[39:46] i am here to get in the message
[39:49] when you have become the message
[39:52] then god gets into you hallelujah
[39:56] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[40:00] and he he brings a salutation that's
[40:02] quite strange
[40:04] and if you notice in verse 12
[40:07] he says in the angel of the lord
[40:09] appeared unto him
[40:12] and said unto him the lord
[40:15] is with thee thou mighty man of valor
[40:20] that's how god addressed gideon
[40:24] a man that was hiding with his threshing
[40:28] and gideon said unto him oh my lord
[40:32] if the lord be with us why then is all
[40:35] this befall in us and where be all his
[40:38] miracles
[40:40] which our fathers told us of saying did
[40:43] not the lord bring
[40:44] us up from egypt but now the lord hath
[40:46] forsaken us
[40:47] and delivered us into the hands of the
[40:49] medianites
[40:51] now remember now this man is being
[40:54] honest
[40:56] and god will deal with every honest
[40:59] heart
[41:00] [Applause]
[41:03] this man was not ready to put on just
[41:05] some kind of fake
[41:08] he said lord i was born here i wasn't
[41:11] born in egypt
[41:12] [Music]
[41:14] but they told me that you opened up the
[41:17] mighty red sea
[41:21] they told me when they were hungry
[41:26] you baked bread from heaven and sent it
[41:29] down to them
[41:31] but look at my kids starving
[41:35] look at all my neighbors starving to
[41:38] death
[41:40] they told me that you opened up the
[41:42] jordan river
[41:46] but if that same god
[41:49] be with us what happened to all those
[41:52] miracles
[41:54] hallelujah
[41:57] and he said why would you call me a man
[42:00] of vailor let's read the scripture
[42:02] he says this in verse in verse
[42:05] 14 and the lord looked upon him and said
[42:08] go in this time might and thou shalt
[42:09] have israel
[42:10] shall save israel from the hand of the
[42:13] midianites
[42:14] have not i sent thee and he said unto
[42:16] him
[42:17] o my lord wherewith shall i save israel
[42:20] behold my family is poor in manasseh
[42:23] and i am the least in my father's house
[42:27] and the lord said unto him surely i will
[42:30] be with thee
[42:31] and thou shalt smite the medianites as
[42:33] one man
[42:35] brother this man was not going to be
[42:39] phony this man told the lord lord
[42:43] my family is the least and i
[42:46] am the least in my family in other words
[42:49] lord
[42:50] i don't want to dispute your word but
[42:52] why would you address me as a man of
[42:54] vailor
[42:56] why would you call me a man of failure
[42:58] when i'm the least of the least
[43:02] but here's the secret
[43:06] here's the secret gideon
[43:11] had a burden in his heart
[43:17] gideon had a burden in his heart
[43:21] the reason why god came to gideon
[43:24] is because there was a burden in
[43:26] [Music]
[43:30] and if that burden ever gets upon a
[43:34] believer
[43:37] if that burden ever gets upon a believer
[43:42] that will say lord god
[43:45] i have heard what you have done with
[43:48] brother branham
[43:50] i have heard what you have done in the
[43:52] past
[43:54] but lord we are raising children now
[43:59] let my children see the same god
[44:09] amen let my children
[44:13] see that same power
[44:18] see the prophet of god says
[44:23] if if you take ezekiel
[44:27] chapter 9 you'll find that there went
[44:31] out as sealer
[44:34] as silly angel and that ceiling angel
[44:39] was commissioned
[44:42] and the commission was go
[44:46] across the city
[44:50] and when you get to a place
[44:53] where you find them so
[44:56] burdened so concerned
[45:02] crying for the abomination
[45:06] that's committed in the city when you
[45:09] find that place
[45:11] where the people are so hungry for god
[45:16] that once in a while meals are left
[45:18] aside
[45:21] but they can turn off turn off rather
[45:23] than televisions
[45:25] they can tune off the telephones
[45:28] they can shut down this shut down that
[45:32] and say where is our goal
[45:35] lord if you be with us
[45:38] show your power brother branham says
[45:43] it was mary in the sea of nazareth
[45:48] a mean city but mary kept herself
[45:52] clean and virgin and gabriel came to her
[45:57] it was elizabeth is that right
[46:01] and zechariah who are righteous
[46:05] fearing god waiting on the consolation
[46:08] but gabriel came to them
[46:12] the prophet says you can run around with
[46:14] the world
[46:16] and expect visitations of angels
[46:19] hallelujah god has a program
[46:23] his program is consecrate yourself
[46:26] amen amen mean business with god
[46:31] and god will mean business with you
[46:34] hallelujah
[46:36] so the angel speaks to him
[46:40] oh my the prophet of god says this let's
[46:42] just look in the bible real quick in
[46:44] verse 20
[46:44] and the angel of god said unto him oh my
[46:48] take the flesh now first of all let's
[46:49] not skip this now watch this
[46:53] verse 17 and he said unto him if now i
[46:55] have found grace in thy sight
[46:58] then show me a sign the thou talkest
[47:00] with me
[47:02] depart not hints i pray thee until i
[47:05] come unto thee
[47:06] and bring forth my present and set it
[47:09] before thee
[47:10] and he said i will tarry until thou come
[47:12] again
[47:14] that's god almighty who appeared unto
[47:17] our humble man and gideon
[47:21] didn't just want to take some haphazard
[47:23] thing he wanted to be so sure
[47:26] he said lord if this is you talking with
[47:29] me
[47:30] i want you to wait here and i'll run
[47:32] home
[47:34] and bring an offering
[47:37] and brother branham says the lord waited
[47:40] there two
[47:40] three hours
[47:45] hallelujah we can wait two three minutes
[47:50] but the lord waited there two three
[47:51] hours waiting for a man
[47:54] to go kill a cow cook it bring them here
[47:58] everything and the lord was still
[47:59] waiting there
[48:02] you see we get in a hurry he is never in
[48:05] a hurry
[48:06] you know one time brother brother made a
[48:07] challenge in a congregation he said
[48:09] whatever you bring here the lord will
[48:10] heal
[48:12] and they brought and they brought a
[48:13] blind man
[48:15] and the prophet says i stood there and i
[48:18] prayed
[48:19] and i prayed and i prayed 30 minutes
[48:22] went by
[48:23] the boy was still blind 45 minutes
[48:26] boy was still blind one hour a boy was
[48:30] still blind
[48:31] today's congregation they would have
[48:32] gone get their hamburgers
[48:35] that's right but the prophet says
[48:39] one hour and 45 minutes
[48:43] hallelujah hallelujah the
[48:46] psyche why
[48:49] mr impatient will not see the glory of
[48:52] god
[48:55] the thing we need is to mean business
[48:58] here
[49:00] god is not a liar oh glory to god
[49:05] god is true if i die tonight
[49:09] let me perish believing god's word
[49:12] [Applause]
[49:14] because heaven and earth will pass away
[49:18] but the word of god will never pass away
[49:21] hallelujah so you see two three hours
[49:26] gideon comes back and he's got some he's
[49:28] got some meat and he's got some
[49:30] broth look what the lord instructs him
[49:31] to do and the angel of god
[49:33] said unto him take the flesh and the
[49:35] unleavened cakes
[49:37] and lay them upon this rock and pour out
[49:39] the broth
[49:40] and he did so then the angel of the lord
[49:43] put forth the end of the staff that was
[49:45] in his hand and touched the flesh
[49:47] and the unleaved cakes and the rose up a
[49:50] fire out of the rock
[49:51] and consumed the flesh and the
[49:53] unleavened case
[49:55] then the angel of the lord departed out
[49:57] of his sight
[49:58] praise the name of the lord now let's
[50:01] listen to the interpretation
[50:02] the prophet brings it here see
[50:06] now watch see now watch
[50:10] he took the stick from his hand and like
[50:13] an old man
[50:14] a staff and touched it and when he
[50:17] touched it the smoke went
[50:18] out and his sacrifice the sacrifice was
[50:21] consumed
[50:22] what was it he took him back to the
[50:25] scriptures
[50:26] to prove what he was the same god that
[50:30] was with elijah and mount carmel
[50:32] the same one i talked about this morning
[50:36] when you lay your soul upon his breast
[50:40] altar of judgment what takes place
[50:44] glory to god if he's the same god
[50:47] he'll take the sacrifice and you've
[50:51] over you've offered it in sincerity upon
[50:54] the altar
[50:55] he will consume the sacrifice and the
[50:58] world
[50:59] will be gone out of you
[51:02] just the smoke will fall away
[51:06] amen what is bothering the church today
[51:10] is mortalism
[51:13] the greatest sin of this age is wartism
[51:18] the world is creeping in our homes
[51:23] in our lives in our churches
[51:28] we should be past the doctrine of
[51:31] holiness
[51:33] we should be way beyond that
[51:36] the doctrine of holiness should be way
[51:40] past but when we still have to tell
[51:44] sisters how to dress
[51:48] and brothers even there's something
[51:51] wrong
[51:53] hallelujah when we let televisions
[51:58] invade our homes entertainment
[52:03] the place of the altar of god
[52:09] how do we expect angels to come
[52:14] you see the prophet of god says this
[52:19] how are you ever going to see a miracle
[52:25] until you become one
[52:29] that means you and i we got to become a
[52:32] miracle
[52:33] we're living in a time where people are
[52:36] seeking signs
[52:38] people want to see miracles and that's
[52:40] wonderful
[52:41] but the prophet says the first miracle
[52:45] should be you
[52:49] you should be a miracle of god's grace
[52:53] amen jesus said
[52:56] except the man be born again he can't
[52:59] even see the kingdom of god
[53:02] if you want to see a miracle become one
[53:07] let god work on you first
[53:10] he's got some over howling to do some
[53:13] different lenses to put on your eyes
[53:16] because you were blind dead in sin and
[53:18] trespasses
[53:19] spiritually blind double dead see god
[53:22] has to give you life
[53:25] amen touch your eyes so you can see
[53:30] amen you become the miracle
[53:34] hallelujah you lay yourself upon the
[53:36] altar of god

[54:09] and you say i thought there was going to
[54:11] be a rapture
[54:12] and some voice will say it's already
[54:15] gone

[54:19] because of wordlism wordlism
[54:23] is killing the church today oh god help
[54:26] us

[54:31] see gideon said wait here see
[54:34] god you know he says when you come to
[54:37] the house of god

[55:45] has told us you are my bride
[55:52] me lord with all my mistakes
[55:56] with all that i am you are my bride
[56:02] because the message he sent to william
[56:04] branham was
[56:07] such a tremendous message there has
[56:10] never been a generation
[56:12] that has ever been given what we have
[56:14] received

[56:18] things so sublime
[56:20] things so good he tells you

[56:27] knew you before the foundation of the
[56:30] world
[56:31] i chose you hallelujah
[56:35] i chose you and when you come he tells
[56:39] you
[56:40] i justify you
[56:45] [Music]
[56:47] you're standing as if you never did it
[56:51] in the first place
[56:56] who is going to believe that the bride
[57:00] will believe that
[57:03] amen
[57:09] when we confess our sins
[57:13] they go back to the devil
[57:18] they will never be remembered against us
[57:19] no more
[57:23] you may remember them your neighbor may
[57:25] remember them
[57:26] but in the mind of god they're gold
[57:31] never to be brought back to the mind of
[57:33] god again
[57:35] and if that is not enough for a person
[57:37] to come to the house of god
[57:40] full of praise full of joy
[57:43] full of worship than what is
[57:47] [Applause]
[57:52] brother
[57:55] the pentecostals they are seeking signs
[57:59] they want miracles they have no seed
[58:04] the seed is the word the seed is the
[58:07] original life
[58:10] and god gave us the original life
[58:14] the original seed and what we need to do
[58:19] is create the atmosphere
[58:22] the atmosphere of worship brother
[58:25] branham says this
[58:27] if you were going to a country let me
[58:29] see if this would work
[58:31] if you're going to a country away from
[58:34] america
[58:36] and you they speak a different language
[58:39] there
[58:41] he says now see could you imagine this
[58:45] is in
[58:46] faith is our victory could you imagine
[58:49] some of you slaying using christians
[58:52] using smutty dirty words and yet
[58:54] belonging to church
[58:56] could you imagine going over to another
[58:59] land
[59:00] and then going around through america
[59:02] learning all this american slang that
[59:04] you know
[59:06] see you wouldn't do that see
[59:09] you know if you're going to sweden
[59:14] and you try to pick up all the american
[59:16] slang all the bad words
[59:18] how are you going to use them in sweden
[59:21] you see
[59:22] i've told this illustration many times
[59:24] when i first came to america
[59:27] was a place i came from a place where
[59:28] they spoke chiluba
[59:30] and then i moved to place where they
[59:31] spoke lingala and then i
[59:33] when i got on the big plane a great big
[59:36] lufthansa
[59:37] plane they spoke uh no more
[59:41] our local languages it was just
[59:44] french and german french
[59:47] and german and we flew all the way to
[59:49] frankfurt
[59:50] germany and when i got there then i took
[59:54] another flight
[59:55] from frankfurt germany to boston
[59:57] massachusetts
[59:59] and that flight no more french
[1:00:03] german english german english
[1:00:08] no more french and when i got to boston
[1:00:11] i had to take another flight from boston
[1:00:13] to charlotte
[1:00:14] and on that flight no more german

[1:00:39] see see the thing you would want to try
[1:00:43] to do
[1:00:43] would be learn a few words of that
[1:00:46] language
[1:00:47] at least as much as to say how do you do
[1:00:49] in that language
[1:00:52] and i think it would behoove us
[1:00:54] christians more today
[1:00:56] if we were trying to learn some heavenly
[1:00:58] language
[1:01:01] the praises of god amen

[1:17:54] oh amen praise the name of the lord
[1:17:59] did you enjoy the service
[1:18:03] amen that was a masterpiece
[1:18:07] amen that's why i call them veteran
[1:18:11] they know how to do their work
[1:18:16] if you consecrate it you're going to see
[1:18:18] what the holy spirit is doing
[1:18:20] amen it is a no and it's so
[1:18:24] it's sacred it brings you
[1:18:28] a fear and respect of what god is doing
[1:18:34] when brother matama called me the 85 was
[1:18:38] closed
[1:18:40] and he was waiting for the old five to
[1:18:42] open
[1:18:43] and we have been in the book of esther
[1:18:46] we preach on the sovereignty of god
[1:18:48] and we blend it trying to get to the
[1:18:50] line of duty
[1:18:52] so i was already prepared i said if it
[1:18:55] happened that
[1:18:56] he can't make it i will get into the
[1:18:59] esther
[1:19:00] and the wine and
[1:19:04] here brother matama comes and begin to
[1:19:08] speak about the wine
[1:19:10] and the stimulation of the revelation
[1:19:14] i wanted to jump quickly into the line
[1:19:16] of duty
[1:19:18] because the lord decoded to me esther
[1:19:21] and the praises
[1:19:23] and i say let me stay in the line of
[1:19:25] duty
[1:19:26] and i tried to avoid it and brother
[1:19:29] matamba came tonight
[1:19:32] and stressed on the praises so in other
[1:19:35] words it's
[1:19:36] a signal to me that you can bypass that
[1:19:39] you need to speak to the church before
[1:19:42] you get to the line of duty
[1:19:44] amen and even the court that i read
[1:19:49] we spoke about the first chamberlain of
[1:19:51] esther which was haggai
[1:19:53] and then if you miss the king you're
[1:19:55] going to go to ches gaza
[1:19:57] and there is another type of chamberlain
[1:20:00] which goes after you are chosen by the
[1:20:04] king
[1:20:05] and i look at that i saw the quote
[1:20:08] brother batamba read about the angel
[1:20:10] coming into your home
[1:20:11] i say let me deviate that let me stay in
[1:20:15] the line of duty brother
[1:20:16] tamba spoke about it tonight again in
[1:20:19] other words they are telling me
[1:20:20] you need to pick all those stuff and
[1:20:23] pull it out
[1:20:25] to the church amen even when he
[1:20:28] mentioned at the beginning he said
[1:20:30] stay joshua stay with the message until
[1:20:32] he reached a point to
[1:20:34] stop the sun he was not here when we
[1:20:38] spoke about joshua stopping the sun
[1:20:40] amen how can a man
[1:20:43] orchestrate things like that amen
[1:20:47] last wednesday wednesday we spoke about
[1:20:49] esther you need to go to the
[1:20:51] purification six months
[1:20:53] under the murder where you gotta die and
[1:20:56] then you go to the perfume where the
[1:20:58] rules of sharon
[1:20:59] is broken to perfume you it was six
[1:21:02] months with murr
[1:21:03] and six months with perfume you go
[1:21:05] through murder to yourself
[1:21:06] dying and then the rose of sharon comes
[1:21:10] to perfume you
[1:21:11] here brother matamus comes and say lay
[1:21:13] your life
[1:21:14] on the altar it is not brother stephen
[1:21:18] it is not brother matamba it is god
[1:21:22] amen we are talking about being chosen
[1:21:25] by the king as esther
[1:21:26] and here he comes he said the lord have
[1:21:29] chosen you
[1:21:31] why is this thing keep coming he's a
[1:21:34] pastor in another church he's coming
[1:21:36] never probably he was not even following
[1:21:39] what we
[1:21:39] we have been preaching here and
[1:21:41] everything is lining up together
[1:21:44] on sunday everything lining up together
[1:21:47] a minister out of state wake up church
[1:21:51] god is doing something brother branham
[1:21:53] say bethlehem was a place where god was
[1:21:56] moving in a mysterious place
[1:21:58] we talked about you entering the king
[1:22:01] you remember you entered the presence of
[1:22:03] the king by meditation
[1:22:06] you spend your time thinking about him
[1:22:08] worshiping him
[1:22:10] and here he comes again he didn't listen
[1:22:12] even to that
[1:22:13] and he began to speak about the same
[1:22:15] thing over
[1:22:16] and over we are not preaching to feed
[1:22:19] your mind
[1:22:21] we are preaching the message to the
[1:22:22] heart because the message of malachi 4
[1:22:25] came
[1:22:25] to restore the heart amen if you take
[1:22:29] what we are preaching
[1:22:30] into the heart it's going to change your
[1:22:32] life if you take it into the mind it
[1:22:34] makes sense it makes sense
[1:22:36] then you're going to stuck in the
[1:22:37] intellectual part
[1:22:39] where you know mystery is in your mind
[1:22:42] in your head
[1:22:43] but it's not changing you we don't want
[1:22:44] that anymore we want mysteries in the
[1:22:47] heart
[1:22:48] and then those mysteries become flesh
[1:22:50] and you yourself become
[1:22:52] a thunder for the devil amen
[1:22:55] let's pray heavenly father lord we thank
[1:22:59] you
[1:23:00] for your grace we thank you for your
[1:23:02] love we thank you for your mercy and for
[1:23:05] giving us this great opportunity
[1:23:08] father we humble ourself like a gideon
[1:23:11] lord

[1:24:02] thing and here he's talking about what's

[1:24:05] which we already spoke about lord father
[1:24:08] we thank you for everything you are
[1:24:10] still insisting in those things
[1:24:13] because probably there are some that are
[1:24:15] still lagging behind
[1:24:17] they don't want to give away they don't
[1:24:18] want to get separated from the land of
[1:24:20] moab
