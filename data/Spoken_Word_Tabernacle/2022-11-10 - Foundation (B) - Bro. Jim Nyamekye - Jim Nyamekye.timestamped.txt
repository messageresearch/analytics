[0:00] now 2020
[0:03] 20 it's three almost two years now so
[0:07] yeah 2020 I guess it was yeah and so the
[0:13] first day they tested my my blood
[0:16] vessels had all collapsed
[0:19] they tried to get blood and the only
[0:22] finally the only places they could get
[0:24] blood for testing was in my groins
[0:28] it was so painful and they did
[0:31] everything and finally the first day
[0:34] they said uh uh the blood coagulation
[0:38] rate
[0:40] was so bad if they did it I could die so
[0:44] first day they didn't do it second day
[0:48] know that they know fourth day it got so
[0:51] bad until I was I could see that I was
[0:55] almost gone
[0:56] so I told them I said they should act by
[0:59] faith just go in there
[1:01] and I believe God will use
[1:05] their knowledge to help me out of the
[1:07] situation
[1:09] you know sometimes we get to feel that
[1:12] uh
[1:13] the doctors you know not needed I I put
[1:16] out this coat by the prophet and then he
[1:19] says that God heals in many ways
[1:23] a doctor asked me not long ago and said
[1:26] what is your opinion of medicine brother
[1:28] Branham I said well God is the only one
[1:31] that can heal say I said the Bible don't
[1:34] lie and the Bible said I'm the Lord that
[1:37] heals all your diseases
[1:40] and I said the Bible can't lie I said
[1:44] God heals by medicine God heals by love
[1:48] God heals by understanding God heals by
[1:52] care God heals my prayer and God heals
[1:56] my miracles
[1:58] the whole thing God heals that's all all
[2:03] there is to it he is the Healer
[2:06] the only healer
[2:09] we haven't got medicine that can create
[2:12] or create a cell in your hand to heal or
[2:16] create in your body to heal we can move
[2:19] a tooth we can cut out appendix or take
[2:24] out a gallbladder but who heals God
[2:29] no medicine will build tissue only God
[2:36] life builds tissue God is the only
[2:40] healer
[2:42] and he says we're talking on that and
[2:44] then in a message he cares do you care
[2:47] he says I hope that each one of you get
[2:50] that especially you people that is to be
[2:53] prayed for
[2:54] that's so uncomfortable this day with
[2:57] maybe troubles that the doctors cannot
[3:00] touch
[3:02] we believe that doctors help people
[3:05] I believe that God heals by medicine God
[3:08] heals by surgery God heals by
[3:12] understanding God heals by love just a
[3:17] little love goes a long way
[3:21] Amen Let somebody be all upset and just
[3:25] show them you care for them
[3:28] see God heals by love God heals my
[3:32] prayer God heals by Miracles God heals
[3:35] by his word he sent forth his word and
[3:40] healed them amen God heals whatever
[3:42] Source it is God heals by it
[3:48] God heals by
[3:52] proper dieting
[3:58] yes sir
[4:00] yeah it's God that heals
[4:03] for he said I'm the Lord that heals all
[4:06] thy diseases so all of him should work
[4:10] together
[4:11] a man in different Ministries
[4:15] should work together for that
[4:18] see now but they don't do it because
[4:21] sometimes they are forbidden to take
[4:23] certain stance upon God's word
[4:26] because there are certain denominations
[4:28] doesn't permit them to do that but that
[4:31] doesn't stop the truth
[4:34] just the same Gods God goes on
[4:38] healing just the same
[4:42] so after struggling the head of the
[4:48] Cardiology Department he came over and I
[4:52] I said
[4:53] just take me in there by faith and I
[4:56] know my God will be there to take over
[5:00] so why did he took my advice they took
[5:02] me over and they did their surgery they
[5:05] had they they were looking for uh a vein
[5:10] to use as uh I've forgotten where they
[5:13] use the terminology but they found one
[5:15] somewhere here and they had this central
[5:19] line or whatever they call it where they
[5:21] pass all the
[5:23] medication and water and whatever they
[5:26] wanted to do
[5:27] so then they drilled what do you call
[5:32] bear hole
[5:34] they drilled Bear b-u-r-r right here
[5:40] one here one day and I tell you what the
[5:44] the pressure
[5:45] that had built up in the head
[5:48] let off you know Brown said letting off
[5:52] the pressure so push shh
[5:56] about 600 Mills of blood came from this
[6:00] side and that side and then they put
[6:03] catheter through and and then I had to
[6:07] lay on my back for the remainder of the
[6:09] blood to come out of my head
[6:12] and everything I saw every light I saw
[6:16] was rainbow everywhere
[6:18] just rainbow rainbow
[6:22] and I remembered a brother in the
[6:25] message was dying and he told Brother
[6:27] promise ramp all of USA is a covenant
[6:31] Covenant Jehovah I'm the Lord that he
[6:34] left thee
[6:35] Hallelujah and by the grace of God I put
[6:39] through
[6:41] they were expecting that I will lose
[6:43] their use of my limbs and I couldn't
[6:46] move my hands and I couldn't do this and
[6:49] that but here I stand
[6:53] a testimony of the power of the Living
[6:56] God
[6:56] [Applause]
[6:57] believe us all over the places we're
[7:00] praying you can't tell me that my God Is
[7:03] Not A Healer
[7:06] I have tasted and tested and tried and I
[7:09] know that my God lives
[7:12] Hallelujah
[7:15] amen
[7:18] God's Not Dead
[7:21] he is alive my God's Not Dead
[7:26] he is alive my God's Not Dead
[7:32] he is a lot I feel him in my heart I
[7:37] feel him in my head I feel him in my
[7:41] feet
[7:42] feeling all over me
[7:46] oh yeah God's Not Dead
[7:50] he's alive my God's Not Dead
[7:55] he is alive
[7:57] God's Not Dead
[8:00] he's alive I feel him in my heart
[8:05] feel him in my
[8:07] I feel him in my feet
[8:10] amen
[8:13] [Music]
[8:18] amen
[8:20] that's the grace and mercy of God
[8:23] to me amen
[8:26] so
[8:29] to whom shall we go
[8:33] they say through this away so fine
[8:36] before I do so
[8:38] let me know the substitute
[8:42] [Applause]
[8:44] if you can give me the substitute
[8:47] I will examine it and compare it
[8:52] and see if it's anywhere near this one
[8:56] [Applause]
[9:00] can you imagine people
[9:02] who have never had one dream that came
[9:05] to pass
[9:06] judging a prophet like this
[9:10] not even one dream
[9:13] that came to pass
[9:15] [Applause]
[9:16] oh my goodness
[9:19] you know Paul was Paul had a Cod
[9:24] Corinthians the Corinthians
[9:28] so there are all kinds of questions
[9:31] and they wanted to question you about
[9:33] glossoloria
[9:35] speaking in tongues
[9:37] in First Corinthians 14 he said I speak
[9:40] in tongues more than you are
[9:43] but in the church I would rather speak
[9:46] ten words that can be understood than
[9:50] ten thousand words
[9:53] that cannot be understood so what do I
[9:56] get from that before you could correct
[9:59] people he had to have what they had
[10:02] and even more
[10:07] so before you can correct William
[10:10] Branham you have to have what he had
[10:14] more than he had
[10:16] [Applause]
[10:17] then you'll be in a position
[10:21] to correct him
[10:25] have you ever read from the scriptures
[10:27] where Paul said I don't even judge
[10:29] myself
[10:30] and no man can judge me
[10:37] Hallelujah
[10:40] but you know let's
[10:44] go let's
[10:45] what do men say that I am
[10:48] that's Mercy but now what do you say
[10:52] this is
[10:54] Hallelujah
[10:56] [Music]
[10:58] so
[11:02] you know the prophet of God made a
[11:04] powerful full statement he said people
[11:06] are not digging
[11:08] deep enough until they hit the rock of
[11:13] Revelation
[11:15] [Music]
[11:17] see you are building
[11:19] our Christian experience the Bible
[11:22] describes us as God's house
[11:25] you know that we are called the building
[11:28] of Jehovah in First Corinthians chapter
[11:31] 3 Paul says we are God's Building and we
[11:35] are God's husbandry
[11:38] amen and we are branches in the tree of
[11:42] life
[11:43] so you can see that if we are God's
[11:47] boarding then there's a foundation
[11:51] and if you don't build on that
[11:53] foundation and you put up a super
[11:56] structure and the storms hit the
[11:58] superstructure because it's got no
[12:01] Foundation you fall off
[12:05] we presumed on people so much
[12:09] because of maybe relationships with the
[12:13] Prophet this that and the other so we
[12:17] presume that people had revelation
[12:20] [Music]
[12:22] the days of presumptions are over
[12:27] now
[12:28] we must be certain of God
[12:34] we must know for sure
[12:36] why a Believer I believe
[12:39] I had believed this message and I didn't
[12:42] know any other person that believed it
[12:45] and I was a school teacher in the north
[12:48] the northern part of our country very
[12:50] close to the Sahara Desert
[12:53] very very dry in December
[12:56] now remember I was in this Christian
[12:58] group and everybody was telling me
[13:00] brother Brown is a false prophet not
[13:03] going to follow effort false prophet and
[13:06] I didn't know any other person that
[13:08] believed the message in my country at
[13:10] the time
[13:12] so I prayed I said Lord
[13:15] somehow in my heart I believe this is
[13:18] the truth but everybody is telling me
[13:21] it's not so so and unite I had a dream
[13:25] and I had met brother pranam
[13:28] and he said brother Jim for you to know
[13:31] my message is true
[13:33] it's gonna rain tonight
[13:36] in a very dry it's gonna rain tomorrow
[13:41] it was in the night and it's gonna rain
[13:44] tomorrow for you to know this message is
[13:47] true
[13:48] and brethren in the driest
[13:52] season in that part of the country
[13:55] without any rain clouds God began to
[13:59] pour down rain so before I ever met
[14:03] anybody
[14:04] Jehovah had convinced me that this is
[14:08] the truth
[14:09] I don't need anybody's opinion about it
[14:13] I have my personal revelation I was
[14:17] founded on a solid rock
[14:19] [Applause]
[14:22] and nothing can move
[14:25] amen hallelujah
[14:29] so
[14:32] Prophet talks about the foundation he
[14:34] says Jesus the reason why we have
[14:37] nowhere else to go is because Jesus is
[14:41] the right foundation
[14:45] First Corinthians 3 no other Foundation
[14:49] can any man lay apart from that which is
[14:53] all very late
[14:55] Jesus Christ is that rock Foundation
[15:00] and we have had a prophet to teach us
[15:04] and train us that
[15:06] it's not just Jesus but the revelation
[15:10] of who he is
[15:13] and if you have the revelation of who he
[15:17] is it shows that you were chosen in him
[15:20] before the foundation of the world to be
[15:24] part of the revealed word of this day
[15:28] God chose us for the last time because
[15:31] he has confidence in US
[15:34] [Applause]
[15:35] you know oftentimes in a relay race
[15:40] you know like the Jamaicans they are
[15:43] noted for
[15:44] running real fast and they have this
[15:48] Usain Bolt and even time they put him
[15:52] for the last you know and when he grabs
[15:54] the Baton
[15:56] it goes
[15:59] he bolts away like thunder
[16:02] like lightning which is gone
[16:05] and so if God should Reserve you and I
[16:08] for this end time he has confidence in
[16:11] US that we will not let him down
[16:16] he told us before the foundation of the
[16:19] world to carry this baton onto the
[16:23] rapture
[16:24] hold on to the Faith of Our Fathers unto
[16:28] the rapture
[16:30] and we have found it on the right
[16:32] foundation
[16:34] if you've got a little tree that is got
[16:38] apple trees
[16:40] it will bear apples
[16:43] if you just put it in the right
[16:46] foundation
[16:48] if you've got a heart
[16:51] hungering for God and you want to see
[16:54] the power of God you want to feel the
[16:57] vibrations of his eternal life you want
[17:00] to see if the holy ghost is real or not
[17:03] just plant to a little fit in his right
[17:06] foundation
[17:09] and you'll find out something goes to
[17:12] work
[17:14] oh he will begin to draw the Waters of
[17:17] life and that little tree will begin to
[17:20] Bear blossoms and fruits
[17:23] it will start growing
[17:26] certainly why because you are planted
[17:30] right
[17:32] you've got to get started right
[17:35] get the right Revival
[17:39] get the Revival right
[17:45] see
[17:52] is it just the Miracles of the prophet
[17:56] in my case
[18:00] each time I heard this prophet
[18:03] he was so scriptural to me
[18:10] our Sherry brought Stephen on phone
[18:14] I had visited a place in our country
[18:19] along the coast the British called it
[18:22] the cape Coast
[18:25] and in the night I had had a dream
[18:28] and I met this brother says yeah there
[18:31] you are brother Jim you believe that
[18:33] seven Thunders are revealed and the
[18:35] seventh seal is open
[18:37] brother Branham said the seventh seal or
[18:41] the seven Thunders who reveal the date
[18:44] of the rapture
[18:45] Christ's new name and the believer's new
[18:48] name in the Lamb's Book of Life so if
[18:51] you claim that the seven Thunders are
[18:54] revealed at the seven series of pain
[18:55] tell me the date of the Rapture tell me
[18:59] Christ's new name and tell me your new
[19:01] name in the Lamb's Book of Life
[19:05] and before am I seeing Jimmy there
[19:08] whoa brother Jeffrey God bless you oh
[19:12] Hallelujah
[19:14] okay so you know I said
[19:17] before I could say
[19:19] the word
[19:21] someone behind me said ask him
[19:25] if he thinks brother Branham was a
[19:29] scriptural prophet
[19:32] so I asked the fella I said Do You
[19:34] Believe William Branham was a scriptural
[19:37] prophet he said yes
[19:39] then the person said ask him where the
[19:42] Bible says anybody will know the date of
[19:45] the rapture
[19:48] and then I asked you tell me where let
[19:50] the bible promises that anybody will
[19:53] know the deed of the rapture
[19:55] he could he answered and then he said
[19:57] Christ had a name that no one else knew
[20:00] I said the Bible said no one else and
[20:02] you want me to to to to to to to what
[20:05] contradict the word
[20:07] and he said the new name that is
[20:09] revealed to the person is so personal
[20:11] nobody else it's not for it's not for
[20:14] for for it's not a kind of a Cooperative
[20:18] name
[20:20] is for the person in other words
[20:22] Revelation is so personal
[20:25] you cannot transfer it to your children
[20:30] it's gonna be personal to you and your
[20:34] children God has got no grandchildren
[20:38] you've got each person has to come the
[20:41] same way you did
[20:45] so the person was quiet and I woke up
[20:48] I said I told my brother that was with
[20:51] me I said we're going to have a
[20:52] confrontation
[20:54] and I tell you A lot of people are
[20:56] living on here say
[20:59] they allow somebody's misbehavior to
[21:02] affect their commitment to this world of
[21:04] their living God
[21:07] if this message is true will it produce
[21:11] this and that character tell me which
[21:13] age
[21:15] had preferred people
[21:17] [Music]
[21:20] what was it at the age of Moses
[21:24] when he went to the money talk for the
[21:26] Ten Commandments and came back all of
[21:29] them were worshiping idols
[21:31] so will you blame me to Moses
[21:35] was it because Moses message was false
[21:38] that he could produce Idol worshipers
[21:45] oh let me read First Corinthians chapter
[21:48] 5.
[21:49] I am great Paul how many billion Powers
[21:52] the Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ a
[21:55] great servant of the most high God all
[21:59] right now Paul you have raised up a
[22:01] church in Corinth
[22:04] so let's see your performance Paul
[22:08] I wonder if you qualify as a prophet
[22:10] because if these things can happen in
[22:13] your church
[22:15] it is reported commonly that there is
[22:19] fornication among you and set
[22:22] fornication as is not so much as named
[22:25] among the Gentiles that one should have
[22:29] his father's wife
[22:33] huh
[22:34] you mean to tell me that Paul's Ministry
[22:38] could produce such a character
[22:43] so you don't judge you don't judge the
[22:46] message by some people's behavior
[22:50] and the same thing is that they keep
[22:52] pointing to the wrong people
[22:57] but the grace of God some of us have
[23:00] been in this message for around 50 years
[23:02] plus
[23:04] and by the grace of God you can point
[23:06] anything like that
[23:08] we are doing our best to live by the
[23:11] word of the Living God why don't you
[23:13] look at the positive and we allow the
[23:16] negatives
[23:18] oh no sir it shouldn't be sold no sir
[23:23] by all it all goes to show
[23:26] that the point of entry
[23:29] the foundation
[23:32] wasn't founded right people don't even
[23:36] know who a prophet is
[23:40] [Music]
[23:44] you know some men
[23:47] expect their wives to be angels
[23:51] so one lady told her husband
[23:58] if you want me to be an angel
[24:02] create a Heavenly atmosphere for me
[24:07] because
[24:09] angels
[24:11] live in heaven
[24:17] [Music]
[24:17] [Applause]
[24:19] so how many want their wives to be
[24:21] angels in the church
[24:25] then is your responsibility to create
[24:28] Heaven around them then there will be
[24:30] there will be angels for you
[24:34] blessed be the name of the Lord
[24:41] there is
[24:43] there is a great danger in this Bible I
[24:46] tell you what a great danger Jesus spoke
[24:50] of
[24:51] when the unclean spirits have left
[24:53] people
[24:54] they go into dry places searching for a
[25:00] new Dwelling Place
[25:01] but if they cannot find a new dwelling
[25:04] conducive place
[25:07] they come not alone but they get seven
[25:11] more wicked spirits and the last entry
[25:15] of that person is worse than when they
[25:18] began
[25:19] so that is about where people have come
[25:23] too
[25:24] instead of going on and digging deep
[25:27] enough to strike Revelation and be truly
[25:30] Born Again by the spirit of the Living
[25:32] God
[25:34] which is a solid foundation for a
[25:37] Christian experience
[25:40] people go on and get a religious spirit
[25:45] and then
[25:48] when they begin to hear this and begin
[25:51] to hear that and they begin to hear that
[25:54] that's the Ephesians chapter 4.
[26:02] if I don't quit some of you cause me to
[26:06] preach till our faith in the problem
[26:09] I'm so glad about
[26:12] there's a big difference when people are
[26:15] not receiving
[26:17] you feel like you are hitting the wall
[26:20] but here I'm not hitting the world I
[26:23] have a home run you know
[26:27] [Music]
[26:29] so
[26:31] five-fold Ministry
[26:33] supposed to do this
[26:37] Ephesians 4 from verse
[26:40] face um there's 10 down he that
[26:45] descended is the same also that has
[26:47] ended up far above all Heavens that he
[26:49] might feel all things
[26:52] and he gave some Apostles and some
[26:55] profess some evangelists some pastors
[26:58] and teachers
[27:01] for the perfecting of the Saints for the
[27:04] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[27:08] the body of Christ
[27:10] till we all come in the unity of the
[27:14] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[27:17] God onto a perfect man unto the measure
[27:21] of the stature of the fullness of Christ
[27:25] now notice
[27:27] so that down here that we henceforth
[27:32] be no more children
[27:36] tossed to and fro
[27:39] carried about with every wind of
[27:43] Doctrine by the Slate of men
[27:47] and kerning craftiness whereby they lie
[27:51] in weight to deceive
[27:55] see
[27:56] wins of doctrines will be blowing
[28:02] cunning craftiness
[28:07] I I heard somebody say brother Branham
[28:11] must plagiarizing
[28:14] a plagiarized is to
[28:17] take somebody's work of literature or
[28:20] something without due reference to the
[28:24] person
[28:25] all right let's see if Isaiah was
[28:27] plagiarizing
[28:29] in Genesis chapter 3 15 the almighty God
[28:33] said the woman see shall preach the head
[28:36] of the serpent a woman has no seed but
[28:39] the man has so he was speaking of the
[28:42] Virgin conception then Isaiah is having
[28:45] 40 Come Thou serve the Lord
[28:48] amen a virgin shall conceive so Isaiah
[28:52] was plagiarized I tell you what he was
[28:57] remember there's only one Holy Ghost
[28:59] [Applause]
[29:02] and the spirit can reveal to somebody
[29:04] and reveal the same thing
[29:07] is the Holy Spirit
[29:10] is the author of true revelation
[29:14] and no individual has Monopoly on the
[29:18] Holy Ghost
[29:19] [Applause]
[29:20] [Music]
[29:21] yeah
[29:23] when brother Branham wrote the church
[29:26] age book and had Dr leeville to
[29:29] glamorize it
[29:31] I said I read many books or history
[29:36] he did not say that everything was by
[29:39] revelation
[29:40] he said I read many books on biased
[29:44] people history
[29:47] and he made references I mentioned some
[29:50] names but so numerous
[29:52] and there is there is something in
[29:55] literature that is if after a certain
[29:59] number of years
[30:01] books come into public domain
[30:05] how many know that
[30:06] so amen so that's how
[30:09] it is praise be to God
[30:11] however
[30:13] these things will continue
[30:16] prophet of God in the present stage of
[30:20] my Ministry
[30:21] he was saying that when a man stands
[30:24] true to the word not just in one meeting
[30:27] but in every meeting when a man stands
[30:30] true to the world the time will come
[30:32] when they will leave him
[30:36] let's follow the lord Jesus
[30:39] while she was getting closer to the end
[30:42] of his Road
[30:44] John chapter 6 he made a statement
[30:47] except you eat my body and dream my
[30:49] blood you have no life in you
[30:53] and some of the mixed multitudes
[30:57] okay he tell us that
[31:02] Leviticus 17.
[31:10] how can Jesus say a thing like that
[31:14] when in the Bible does this man know his
[31:17] Bible
[31:19] this man Jesus does he really know his
[31:22] Bible
[31:39] press 10 down
[31:48] whatsoever man that be of the House of
[31:51] Israel or all of the strangers that
[31:53] surgeon among you that eateth any manner
[31:56] of blood
[31:58] I will even set my face against that
[32:01] soul that eat of blood I will carry more
[32:05] from among his people for the life of
[32:08] the flesh is in the blood and I have
[32:10] given it to you upon the altar to make
[32:13] an atonement for your soul so for it is
[32:16] the blood that makeeth and atonement for
[32:19] the soul therefore I said unto the
[32:21] children of Israel no soul of you shall
[32:24] eat blood neither shall any stranger
[32:27] that's so jealous among you eat blood
[32:30] and then you come around and you tell
[32:32] them except you eat my body and dream my
[32:36] blood you have no life in you so do you
[32:39] think those people were fundamentally
[32:41] wrong
[32:43] when they turned away from him I said
[32:45] this man thinks we are vampires
[32:49] or candy bars
[32:52] they forsook him
[32:54] and flesh
[32:56] no more walked with him
[32:59] he was approaching Calvary
[33:02] and it had to be him alone
[33:05] if Peter had been crucified with him
[33:08] that day you can imagine what the
[33:11] Catholics would be doing
[33:14] I've mentioned it before one time I was
[33:17] flying from
[33:18] um
[33:19] from Belfast to
[33:22] the Irish Republic Northern Ireland
[33:26] and
[33:28] before you enter the plane they were
[33:31] displaying newspapers and I picked one
[33:34] on the front page
[33:37] 4.3
[33:40] is it 4.3 Roman Catholics
[33:43] are penned their signature
[33:47] 4.3 million or 1.3 million I forgot it's
[33:51] been a long while but they are painted
[33:53] their signature
[33:55] appealing to the pope to make Mary the
[34:00] fourth person of the Trinity so that
[34:03] they get a holy quartet
[34:10] oh my goodness
[34:14] yeah that's why you get if you if you
[34:18] get go away from that solid scriptural
[34:22] Foundation
[34:23] if you leave the way then you open
[34:26] yourself up for any kind of thing
[34:30] so that's why the prophet said if a man
[34:34] leaves the word leave the man
[34:37] because he becomes a very dangerous
[34:40] person
[34:41] very dangerous
[34:43] very dangerous
[34:46] so
[34:48] the foundation must be right
[34:52] or you are going to face problems
[34:57] we may not be what we ought to be we may
[35:01] not be what we want to be but there's
[35:03] one thing we know we are not what we
[35:05] used to be
[35:07] once we found Christ we come to the
[35:11] solid foundation
[35:14] amen
[35:16] yes sir that Foundation
[35:20] is so important
[35:25] people
[35:26] maturing out of
[35:29] childhood when I was a child he said I
[35:33] spoke as a child
[35:35] I thought as a child that when I'm a
[35:38] child
[35:39] I put away childish things
[35:42] that did not mean that he stopped
[35:44] thinking
[35:45] and he did not stop speaking but he
[35:48] thought and spoke with maturity
[35:53] amen
[35:54] amen if you are founded on the right
[35:58] solid foundation nothing can shake you
[36:03] look at an example in Jeremiah
[36:06] the book of Jeremiah chapter 35.
[36:10] something
[36:11] very similar
[36:14] and you can read all of it but I may
[36:18] give the summary of it
[36:20] the word which came unto Jeremiah from
[36:23] the Lord in the days of yahuwah came the
[36:26] son of Josiah king of Judah saying go on
[36:30] to the house of the rich abides and
[36:32] speak unto them and bring them into the
[36:35] house of the Lord into one of the
[36:37] chambers and give them wine to drink
[36:42] give them wine to drink
[36:45] thus serve the Lord through the mouth of
[36:48] his Vindicated Prophet to the rich
[36:51] advice
[36:54] then I took Jesus and I are the son of
[36:57] Jeremiah the son of habazar and I am and
[37:01] his Brethren and all his sounds and the
[37:03] whole house of the Rachel's and I
[37:05] brought them into the house of the Lord
[37:07] into the Chamber of their sons
[37:10] the son of IG the Lion a man of God
[37:13] which was by the Chamber of the princess
[37:15] which was above the Chamber of Messiah
[37:19] the Son of Shalom The Keeper of the door
[37:21] and I sat before the sons of the House
[37:24] of the Richer by his pulse full of wine
[37:27] and cups and I said unto them drink you
[37:30] wine
[37:32] but they said we would drink no wine
[37:35] for Jonathan the summer Rich about
[37:38] father
[37:39] commanded us say he shall drink no wine
[37:42] neither he nor your sons forever
[37:47] seed no plant Vineyard nor have any but
[37:51] all your days he shall dwell in tense
[37:53] that he may live many days in the land
[37:56] where he be strangers
[37:58] thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonah
[38:01] dab the summary Chapel our father in all
[38:04] that he attract us to drink no wine all
[38:07] our days we are wise our sons our
[38:10] daughters nor to build houses for us to
[38:13] dwell in either of weave Vineyard
[38:16] norfield nor seed
[38:18] we have dwelled intense and have obeyed
[38:21] and done according to all that Jonah
[38:23] they have our father commanded us but it
[38:26] came to pass when the Phuket nature king
[38:29] of Babylon came up into the land that we
[38:31] said come let's go to Jerusalem for fear
[38:34] of the army of the Guardians for fear of
[38:37] the army of the syrians so we dwell at
[38:40] Jerusalem
[38:41] then came the word of the Lord unto
[38:45] Jeremiah saying amen
[38:47] thus save the Lord of hosts the god of
[38:51] Israel go and tell the man of Judah and
[38:55] inhabitants of Jerusalem will he now
[38:58] receive instruction to hearken to my
[39:01] West save the Lord the words of Jonah
[39:04] Dev the son of Richard that he commanded
[39:08] his sons not to dream wine are performed
[39:11] For unto this day they drink Nam but
[39:14] obey their father's Commandments
[39:17] notwithstanding are spoken unto you
[39:20] Rising early speaking by hacking on unto
[39:23] me
[39:24] I have sent us unto you all my servants
[39:27] the prophets
[39:28] rising up early and sending them saying
[39:31] return ye now every man from his evil
[39:33] way and amend your doings and go not
[39:36] after other gods to sell them
[39:39] and you shall dwell in the land which I
[39:41] have given to you and to your fathers
[39:43] but you have not inclined your hearing
[39:45] or hacking unto me because the sons of
[39:48] Jonah died the son of Rachel have
[39:50] performed the Commandment of their
[39:52] father which he commanded them but these
[39:56] people are not acting unto me therefore
[39:59] thus saith the Lord God of hosts the god
[40:02] of Israel behold I will bring upon Judah
[40:05] and upon all the inhabitants of
[40:07] Jerusalem all the evil that are
[40:09] pronounced against them because I've
[40:12] spoken unto them but they have not heard
[40:15] I've called unto them but they have not
[40:17] answered and Jeremiah said unto the
[40:20] house of the Richer by thus save the
[40:22] Lord of those the god of Israel because
[40:25] he have obeyed the Commandment of Jonah
[40:28] dab your dad kept all his precepts and
[40:31] done according unto all that he have
[40:33] commanded you therefore thou saved the
[40:36] Lord of hosts the god of Israel to adapt
[40:39] summary job shall not want a man to
[40:42] stand before me forever
[40:45] now what is the Revelation in this
[40:49] those people
[40:51] had a revelation of what their father
[40:55] meant
[40:56] and they stuck with it regardless of
[41:00] what Jeremiah
[41:02] a true prophet of God could not even get
[41:06] them away from that Foundation
[41:10] they knew what they were doing
[41:13] they were not following any man's
[41:15] opinion
[41:16] no father mother but they were following
[41:19] what their dad had raised them to
[41:22] believe the solid foundation and they
[41:25] stood on it and no wind of Doctrine
[41:27] whether from a prophet or priest nobody
[41:31] can could sway them from that Foundation
[41:34] God wants you to get a perfect
[41:36] revelation of the word of God that has
[41:40] been sent in a day
[41:42] [Applause]
[41:45] so that remember all kinds of prophets
[41:48] all kinds of people
[41:51] Revelation 24 24 the answer is Matthew 4
[41:55] 4.
[41:56] false Christ false prophet shall rise
[41:59] and things are going to be intensified
[42:02] the pressure is going to be built up
[42:07] stronger ways are going to blow than
[42:09] have been blown and If These Wings can
[42:12] blow certain people deacons Justice
[42:14] ministers blow them off their feet what
[42:17] would they do when the squeeze comes
[42:19] down to where we are pressed down
[42:22] what would they do when the squeeze
[42:25] comes down to where we are pressed down
[42:28] and you stand alone
[42:30] no church around you
[42:32] you will be like Daniel and his friends
[42:35] in Babylon
[42:37] and yet they had this solid foundation
[42:41] so nothing could frighten them not even
[42:43] death threats
[42:45] not even the threat of Fire
[42:49] could swear them off their Foundation
[42:52] they stay true to their commitment they
[42:55] are the solid revelation of what they
[42:58] were committed unto
[43:03] have you come to that place
[43:06] where you are so settled in your heart
[43:10] this word is your life
[43:15] has this message become your life
[43:18] you know somebody can struggle with me
[43:20] and get away with this jacket but it's
[43:23] not my life
[43:26] if they try to pull my arm away I'll
[43:28] have to struggle with them because my
[43:30] life
[43:32] this message
[43:34] ought to become our life
[43:37] the no amount of demons from the pit of
[43:41] Hell can sway you away
[43:43] [Music]
[43:45] you are going to go under The Crucible
[43:48] of testings and trials
[43:52] to come from left right up and down
[43:55] but you've got to have a revelation
[43:59] that you are standing on the solid rock
[44:02] of revelation God has confirmed to your
[44:07] heart
[44:08] that this is my voice
[44:11] this is my message of life to you
[44:16] yes sir if it gets that far
[44:20] come Wind come whatever
[44:24] you will stay true
[44:27] but you cannot dwell on somebody else's
[44:31] testimony
[44:34] you have to have your own personal
[44:38] testimony
[44:41] at this point in your Christian Life we
[44:45] are so close to the end
[44:49] the prophet spoke of the King of the
[44:51] North
[44:52] watch the cane of the North
[44:56] watch Russia
[44:58] and we see it all happening
[45:01] every prophecy is being
[45:05] being fulfilled right before our eyes
[45:10] and the prophecies included Falling Away
[45:17] listen the falling away had nothing to
[45:20] do with denominations they were they
[45:22] were never they were never standing
[45:25] [Applause]
[45:28] they were never standing
[45:31] so they're falling away it's not about
[45:33] them it's about those who said they were
[45:36] strangled
[45:37] blown off their feet
[45:41] it's where we are
[45:44] and it's going to continue that's why
[45:46] the prophet brought us one in a million
[45:51] [Music]
[45:53] watch The Exodus the first Exodus
[45:56] three stages they're coming out the
[45:59] Wilderness and the entering in
[46:01] just before they entered in they hit
[46:04] carried
[46:07] the spies came back and brought a bad
[46:11] report
[46:14] if democracy worked at that time then it
[46:19] was turned against two they were they
[46:21] won the election
[46:26] Amen in the days of my career 400 false
[46:31] prophets they were in elections
[46:34] it's not always that the majority
[46:36] carries the fruit
[46:41] praise the Lord
[46:45] so here we are there we are just at the
[46:48] closing days of time and I just want to
[46:52] wind up because Reverend you have to be
[46:55] sure I have to be certain all these very
[46:59] good friends of mine here then
[47:02] when it comes to life friendship must
[47:04] stay away
[47:05] [Applause]
[47:06] [Music]
[47:07] [Applause]
[47:09] and I first believe this message my
[47:12] brothers and everybody stood against me
[47:14] they wanted to but it's my life
[47:18] stayed with it and now I had to bury
[47:21] every one of them and take care of their
[47:24] children
[47:25] I'm the only the the last one died a few
[47:29] days ago
[47:30] and uh
[47:32] he said uh you have changed your church
[47:34] and change this and change that but I
[47:38] will remain a Methodist forever I say
[47:40] well I'm sorry
[47:41] I'll be a Christian forever I'm not
[47:44] interested in denomination I thought you
[47:47] said you'll be a Christian forever well
[47:50] along the line he came around and he saw
[47:52] the influence and impact of the word of
[47:55] God he said brother I want you to
[47:57] baptize me
[48:02] stay solid
[48:04] stay true to the world
[48:06] [Applause]
[48:10] this is the only message
[48:12] designed by Jehovah to produce a bride
[48:16] without sport without blemish without
[48:18] breaking
[48:20] [Applause]
[48:21] show me any other message
[48:24] that's a creep to do that
[48:27] which
[48:30] so I want these people give me the
[48:32] substitute first and now we're examine
[48:35] it and compare and contrast it
[48:39] but they don't have no substitute and
[48:42] yet they reject what God has said
[48:45] may God be merciful
[48:48] oh and some of the childish things that
[48:51] some people can say
[48:54] burden of the word of the Lord by
[48:56] Malachi
[48:58] to Israel
[49:01] let me let me ask a question which of
[49:04] the books in the Bible was addressed to
[49:06] you and I
[49:08] thank you
[49:12] through the whole Bible away we none was
[49:16] addressed to us here in Gastonia
[49:20] so it's not even for us
[49:23] but thanks be to God
[49:26] I will read you second Timothy 3 16.
[49:31] oh boy
[49:35] second Timothy chapter 3.
[49:38] and verse 16.
[49:44] from a child that has known the holy
[49:47] scriptures that's 15 which are able to
[49:49] make thee wise unto salvation through
[49:52] faith which is in Christ Jesus
[49:54] all scripture
[49:57] is given by inspiration of God
[50:00] all scripture
[50:03] and is profitable
[50:05] for Doctrine how many of them oh
[50:09] profitable for Doctrine for reproof for
[50:13] creation for instruction in
[50:15] righteousness
[50:16] that a man of God may be perfect
[50:19] thoroughly furnished unto all
[50:22] good works
[50:23] well well if Malacca is not for us and
[50:27] it's for the Jews then don't take ties
[50:36] Malachi 3 8-12 speaks about bring you
[50:40] all the tithes and offering and people
[50:42] who have dwelled on tithes and offering
[50:44] now they are saying that book is not for
[50:46] us so we are thieves
[50:52] oh my goodness
[50:54] Brethren all these things please please
[50:57] please please
[50:58] for God's sake study this Bible
[51:04] everything that the prophet of God can
[51:07] be preached out of here
[51:10] if there is anything you cannot preach
[51:12] out of here
[51:14] something is wrong with your revelation
[51:23] don't bring your laziness
[51:25] to studying this Bible
[51:29] don't bring your laziness
[51:31] to prayerlessness
[51:36] study this word thoroughly
[51:40] and you find out that statements that
[51:42] brother Branham will make that appear as
[51:44] though they are not there are all day
[51:47] [Applause]
[51:51] that's why I haven't found any fault yet
[51:56] because if this word of God is in your
[51:59] heart and the prophet makes a statement
[52:01] he picks it up it brings her back
[52:04] you can say Amen
[52:08] oh bless that be the name of the Lord
[52:13] we are not following cunningly device
[52:16] Fables
[52:18] We are following the Vindicated voice of
[52:22] God for our day
[52:25] and as we get closer to the end of time
[52:28] we are going to appreciate this message
[52:31] more and more
[52:34] can you imagine a society little
[52:37] children are told not to say they are
[52:41] boys or girls
[52:45] when they grow up then they will decide
[52:50] goodness
[52:53] we are getting to a place where the
[52:57] people have become insane
[53:03] the prophet said they have become
[53:04] neurotics
[53:07] and it's going to get worse
[53:12] it's going to get where you have to
[53:14] stand alone
[53:15] on the revelation of God's word
[53:20] stand alone
[53:24] but God will stand with you
[53:29] Jesus had to stand alone
[53:33] the disciples got to a point they had to
[53:36] stand alone
[53:37] Paul said in a way that is called heresy
[53:41] so worshiped by the Lord God of my
[53:43] fathers
[53:45] this way will have to be called the same
[53:49] heresy
[53:51] Insanity We are following a man people
[53:54] that followed Paul I'm sure people said
[53:57] they were following a man
[53:58] people that followed Moses they were
[54:01] following a man
[54:04] study to show yourself approved a white
[54:07] man who needs not be ashamed rightly
[54:09] dividing the word of Truth
[54:14] that's the only way these wings that are
[54:16] blowing cannot blow you off your feet
[54:21] if you find that this is a scriptural
[54:24] message then you realize that to reject
[54:27] it is like rejecting the Bible
[54:31] then in that way you know your end
[54:35] the Lake of Fire
[54:40] so these rich abides will not be swayed
[54:44] a young Prophet sent from Samaria First
[54:47] Kings chapter 13.
[54:50] the Lord sent him to perform science and
[54:52] wonders and to show his power and when
[54:56] he did the king straight from his hand
[54:58] to strike him and
[55:02] it's weather
[55:04] the prophet prayed for the king he was
[55:06] restored the king said come home and eat
[55:09] with me said thus said the Lord I'm not
[55:12] supposed to do that
[55:14] then he set forth on a different route
[55:17] and as he was going
[55:19] his sons had attended the campaign they
[55:23] reported to their dad
[55:26] and dad said where did he pass and they
[55:30] sorrow the ass and he followed him and
[55:32] he met him he said hello he said yeah
[55:33] you die young prophecy yes I am
[55:36] oh come home and eat with me
[55:39] you always leave your foundation
[55:43] it's all
[55:46] thus save the Lord I'm not supposed to
[55:48] do this
[55:51] listen to the enticing ways
[55:55] stand with me in your Bible to Second
[55:57] Kings
[56:00] chapter 13.
[56:07] first king is 13.
[56:12] foreign
[56:14] he said unto him Verse 18 First Kings 13
[56:18] and verse 18 He said unto him I am a
[56:23] prophet also as Thou Art
[56:26] and an angel spoke unto me by the word
[56:30] of the Lord saying bring him back with
[56:33] thee into thine house
[56:35] that he may eat and drink water
[56:38] but he lied unto him
[56:41] so he went back with him and did eat
[56:44] bread in his house and drank water
[56:48] and he came to pass as they sat at the
[56:51] table
[56:52] that The Well of the Lord came unto the
[56:54] prophet that brought him back
[56:56] and he cried unto the man of God that
[56:59] came from Judah saying
[57:01] thus say of the Lord
[57:03] for as much as thou has disobeyed the
[57:06] mouth of the Lord now as you have left
[57:09] your foundation
[57:11] and has not kept the Commandment which
[57:14] the Lord thy God commanded thee but
[57:17] chemist back and has eaten bread and
[57:21] drawn water in the place
[57:24] of the which the Lord did say to thee
[57:26] eat no bread and drink no water
[57:29] thy caca shall not come unto the
[57:31] Sepulcher of thy fathers he came to pass
[57:34] after he had eaten bread and after he
[57:37] had drunk he settled for him he asked
[57:41] for the prophet whom he had brought back
[57:44] when he was gone
[57:47] a lion met him by the way and slew him
[57:50] and his carcass was cast in the way and
[57:53] they are stood by the lion also stood by
[57:56] the carcass behold Men passed by and saw
[57:59] the carcass casting the way the lion
[58:02] standing by the carcass and they came
[58:04] and told it in the city where the old
[58:07] Prophet dwelled the old Prophet went
[58:09] took his brother and had him buried and
[58:12] everything he said if I die Bury Me by
[58:15] him for the things that he said are true
[58:19] but watch out
[58:22] right look don't allow anybody whatever
[58:26] his credentials are
[58:29] to take you off that solid foundation
[58:36] it's very easy to be swayed by
[58:39] associations
[58:40] relationships and this that and yeah
[58:45] my problem is this
[58:49] I'm so sorry
[58:51] the Jimmy
[58:55] Dr James Humes
[58:58] and Mama
[59:00] and Big Brother
[59:02] and his wife are already here
[59:06] because they followed the false prophet
[59:16] it is
[59:17] if that is true then all of these
[59:20] parents are lost
[59:23] that we even know better than our own
[59:25] parents that raised us up
[59:28] and we persuaded that this word is true
[59:32] they encourage us to walk in the light
[59:36] now they will turn in their graves
[59:40] they will turn in their graves
[59:45] is Vindicated Prophet that went beyond
[59:48] the curtain of time and came back and
[59:51] told us
[59:54] my soul is satisfied
[59:57] my soul is satisfied
[1:00:01] don't open your ears
[1:00:04] to any other voice
[1:00:07] this young Prophet this young brother
[1:00:10] lost his life
[1:00:12] because he allowed
[1:00:15] I'm also a prophet an angel told me
[1:00:20] that's why Paul got his code from
[1:00:22] Galatians 1 if even an angel from heaven
[1:00:27] preaches any other gospel apart from
[1:00:30] that which I have preached let him be
[1:00:33] accursed
[1:00:35] and our Prophet said I preach what Paul
[1:00:38] preached
[1:00:40] and the whole house of Heaven said we
[1:00:43] are resting on God
[1:00:47] yes sir
[1:00:49] so
[1:00:50] if you're not satisfied with this what
[1:00:53] else do you want
[1:00:54] what else should God do that he has not
[1:00:57] done
[1:00:59] God has proven his word through this end
[1:01:01] time Prophet from Genesis to Revelation
[1:01:04] and Beyond
[1:01:07] and listen
[1:01:09] this message not only did God vindicate
[1:01:12] it through the prophet but those are
[1:01:14] sincerely believed it
[1:01:17] I'm an example
[1:01:19] I will show you a few pictures that I
[1:01:22] reserved for uh I wish I had come I had
[1:01:27] remembered it early enough so that we
[1:01:30] could see them
[1:01:32] Supernatural vindications
[1:01:36] people
[1:01:38] are
[1:01:41] I was in England
[1:01:44] and we had a convention
[1:01:46] and there was this brother Barry wire
[1:01:50] and uh
[1:01:53] bro don't Bailey
[1:01:56] late Don Bailey
[1:01:59] was baptizing
[1:02:01] and Wendy's brother
[1:02:03] was coming I wish you can see it from
[1:02:06] where you are let me stand here and see
[1:02:10] see the clouds surrounding him
[1:02:13] you can see the mirror you can look at
[1:02:15] them later
[1:02:16] but this one is so clear
[1:02:20] when the brother was baptized in the
[1:02:22] name of the Lord Jesus and pictures were
[1:02:25] taken
[1:02:26] look at the supernatural Shield
[1:02:30] can you see it
[1:02:35] God has Vindicated oh sorry
[1:02:38] yeah
[1:02:40] can you now see it
[1:02:44] look at look at the the picture here
[1:02:46] there was no Shield there
[1:02:49] all right
[1:02:52] okay the brother is coming to take it
[1:02:55] and you you can see the stages so this
[1:02:58] is number one
[1:03:00] and
[1:03:04] number two
[1:03:10] and number three
[1:03:14] is there
[1:03:16] a
[1:03:16] supernatural vindications of the the
[1:03:20] message continuing
[1:03:25] when they said the Lord Jesus was fake
[1:03:28] and they crucified him and his anointing
[1:03:31] Came Upon the apostles
[1:03:34] and God Vindicated the message through
[1:03:37] the apostles the Believers the critics
[1:03:41] mouths were shot
[1:03:44] this is the time for us to so live this
[1:03:47] way
[1:03:48] so believe it in our hearts that God
[1:03:51] will so anoint his bride till critics
[1:03:55] mouths to be shocked
[1:03:57] and I believe that's what God is doing
[1:04:00] and will continue to do but it will be
[1:04:03] in the minority
[1:04:13] amen
[1:04:17] the prophet of God uh this is what the
[1:04:21] church we must Target
[1:04:24] we must really really Target because
[1:04:28] I built calls on what I called her the
[1:04:32] capping of the pyramid bride
[1:04:36] the capping of the pyramid bride
[1:04:41] you see the Capstone coming on listen
[1:04:44] close now and I'm closing
[1:04:47] as we close Prophet saying at Calvary
[1:04:53] God came down
[1:04:56] and took the body of his own son in
[1:04:59] which he had lived
[1:05:01] and he ripped it apart at Calvary
[1:05:05] he was bleeding
[1:05:07] wounded and cut
[1:05:09] and the spear running there and ripped
[1:05:12] him apart and his blood gushed out and
[1:05:17] he said father into thy hands I command
[1:05:19] my spirit
[1:05:21] he bowed his head
[1:05:23] and the Earth shook the lightness
[1:05:25] flashed Thunders rolled God was writing
[1:05:29] his Everlasting Covenant
[1:05:33] the same clothes very close
[1:05:36] he took his dead body from the grave on
[1:05:39] the first day of the week
[1:05:41] and brought it up into heaven
[1:05:45] and set it there as a high priest as a
[1:05:48] memorial
[1:05:51] sitting there perfect forever
[1:05:54] and this is our part and he sent the
[1:05:58] spirit that he tore out of that body
[1:06:01] right back down to the church
[1:06:06] and that church will have to have the
[1:06:09] same spirit that was in that body or it
[1:06:13] won't dovetail with it in the
[1:06:16] resurrection
[1:06:17] those two pieces must come perfectly
[1:06:20] together and if this church isn't
[1:06:24] perfectly just exactly the same spirit
[1:06:28] that was in Christ
[1:06:30] you will never go in the rapture
[1:06:39] that's where he We Stand solid
[1:06:43] Same Spirit that was in that body
[1:06:47] that was wounded and crucified and
[1:06:49] buried and Resurrected
[1:06:52] sitting on the memorial on the throne of
[1:06:55] God as a memorial
[1:06:57] he sent the spirit that was in that body
[1:07:02] upon the church
[1:07:05] and he started building a pyramid
[1:07:08] justification certification is narrowing
[1:07:10] narrowing narrowing until it's come to
[1:07:13] this point
[1:07:15] and you can you can see
[1:07:17] the brother John Noble was there coming
[1:07:20] and brother Tom Bailey was baptized you
[1:07:23] can see crowd over there we were hiding
[1:07:26] away somewhere
[1:07:28] and then let's see the next one
[1:07:31] Supernatural Vindication you see there
[1:07:34] was no shirt
[1:07:35] but when that was taken look at that
[1:07:42] Supernatural vindications not just in
[1:07:45] the prophet if we will follow the same
[1:07:48] message
[1:07:49] and do exactly what the messenger says
[1:07:52] we should do
[1:07:53] God is Duty bound
[1:07:56] to perform the same Supernatural science
[1:07:58] might not be the same level but
[1:08:01] individually we will be identified with
[1:08:05] the Risen Savior
[1:08:07] it may not it may not be you see people
[1:08:10] are expecting an overnight something
[1:08:13] and we call ourselves the Seed of
[1:08:15] Abraham
[1:08:18] and we cannot even wait for 10 years 20
[1:08:20] years and we are spending overnight
[1:08:22] miracle and if it doesn't happen then we
[1:08:25] think the message is not true
[1:08:28] this Mercy is true
[1:08:33] we believed it and God has constantly
[1:08:36] been vindicating it and constantly
[1:08:40] proving that this word that we have
[1:08:42] believed is true
[1:08:44] amen I remember those one of our sisters
[1:08:48] in 1992 she had a ectopic pregnancies
[1:08:53] two different ectopic pregnancies are
[1:08:57] two different times
[1:08:58] and I gathered a bunch of systems that
[1:09:01] were wanting children in our house and
[1:09:03] we fasted and prayed those one sister
[1:09:05] the Holy Spirit fell on Earth that said
[1:09:07] the Lord the sister is going to give
[1:09:09] birth
[1:09:10] no fallopian tubes and she gave birth to
[1:09:12] a bouncing baby
[1:09:16] the Lord is took God
[1:09:21] don't be afraid to trust him and lean on
[1:09:24] his promises nothing is too hard for him
[1:09:27] he's still the same
[1:09:30] it might take a long while
[1:09:32] [Applause]
[1:09:33] but Hebrews 10 35 you have need or
[1:09:37] patience that after you have done the
[1:09:39] will of God you might obtain the
[1:09:42] promises
[1:09:45] patiently hang on brother yes sister I'm
[1:09:49] gonna hold on

[1:18:06] that you are not following canningly

[1:18:15] message
[1:18:16] Solid Rock
[1:18:19] revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ in
[1:18:24] his word
[1:18:25] so the seals revealed Christ
[1:18:28] the message is all about Christ
[1:18:32] if it is not if it is about Christ and
[1:18:35] you turn it down you have not turned
[1:18:37] down William Brother
[1:18:39] he is not the message
[1:18:41] he's only a messenger
[1:18:44] of the message
[1:18:46] you might meet a a signpost
[1:18:51] and put it down say oh praise God I know
[1:18:54] the way but
[1:18:55] all that signpost
[1:18:58] you miss the direction
[1:19:01] but the signpost is not the destination
[1:19:04] shows you
[1:19:05] destination
[1:19:07] is Christ
[1:19:10] and I'm satisfied that it is Christ
[1:19:14] and I have accepted it into my heart
[1:19:19] repented of my sins
[1:19:22] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:19:24] Christ
[1:19:26] baptized in the Holy Ghost born into
[1:19:29] God's family
[1:19:30] and if I had the opportunity I'll be
[1:19:32] preaching on the authority of Sons and

[1:19:37] and I realized that
[1:19:40] Satan has put fear on the on on entire
[1:19:44] message some most intimacy Believers as
[1:19:49] if God will disappoint us
[1:19:52] if we committed all to him
[1:19:55] he will not
[1:19:57] give your faith a chance for it to grow
[1:20:02] exercise your faith
[1:20:04] don't try to heal anybody
[1:20:07] because you are not a Healer
[1:20:09] don't try to save anybody
[1:20:12] you are not a savior
[1:20:14] but preach the word
[1:20:17] act out the word
[1:20:19] but the Healer and the Savior will take
[1:20:23] your action and apply to the lives of
[1:20:26] people and you'll be happy you did
[1:20:30] shall we borrow his
[1:20:32] renew our commitment

[1:29:19] enjoy the word
[1:29:22] I'm just going to read one thing and
[1:29:24] then we pray
[1:29:28] it's in uh you don't have to turn it's
[1:29:31] in Matthew 7.
[1:29:33] verse 24.
[1:29:35] the Bible says therefore whosoever
[1:29:38] heareth this saying of mine
[1:29:41] and do them
[1:29:44] hearing is good
[1:29:46] but if you don't do them
[1:29:48] it's not going to help you
[1:29:50] you might be under the word and you're
[1:29:52] hearing the word but if you don't do
[1:29:55] them you are not building that
[1:29:57] Foundation
[1:29:58] the Bible says that therefore whosoever
[1:30:01] Hearth the saying of mine
[1:30:03] which is the word of God and doeth them
[1:30:07] are liking him onto a wise man
[1:30:11] so a wise man is not somebody who's only
[1:30:15] hears of the word but he's a heareth and
[1:30:19] a doers of the word
[1:30:20] he said I would like an unto him as to
[1:30:23] where unto a wise men which buildeth his
[1:30:26] house upon a rock
[1:30:29] so if you are hearing the word of God
[1:30:33] and you are doing what God is telling
[1:30:36] you to do
[1:30:37] automatically in a spiritual realm you
[1:30:41] are building your house in a solid rock
[1:30:45] but
[1:30:47] if we are hearing the word of God
[1:30:50] and you are not doing what God is
[1:30:52] telling you to do
[1:30:54] just stand ashore that it's on the
[1:30:58] sinking sand all it takes it's a lot of
[1:31:01] blood from hell
[1:31:02] and you will realize you're on the floor
[1:31:04] we don't want to be on the floor
[1:31:07] amen this message is not complicated
[1:31:12] I was communicating with a young man
[1:31:15] last night
[1:31:16] and he's going through a lot of things
[1:31:20] and I told him I say you're too young
[1:31:23] to be going through depression
[1:31:26] because you have many things that you
[1:31:28] have to overcome in your life
[1:31:30] and you have many things you have to
[1:31:32] accomplish you're not there yet
[1:31:35] in other words if at this stage you
[1:31:38] start depression depression depression I
[1:31:40] don't know how you're going to face
[1:31:42] your future when you get married and
[1:31:44] things like that
[1:31:46] amen amen I said the problem is you
[1:31:49] don't want to give up
[1:31:53] amen amen you're just between two
[1:31:56] opinion
[1:31:57] you don't want to give up something
[1:32:01] and we go under the pretense of
[1:32:03] depression of I can't take it no more
[1:32:07] I need some time no it's not that
[1:32:10] amen because when you go get fun
[1:32:14] you don't get depressed
[1:32:16] when you go hang out you don't get
[1:32:19] depressed when you spend your time
[1:32:21] joking you don't get depressed but when
[1:32:24] they tell you this is not what you're
[1:32:25] supposed to do this is what you're
[1:32:27] supposed to do now you're getting
[1:32:29] depressed then it's too much then I
[1:32:31] can't take it no more the problem is not
[1:32:34] that the problem is you don't want to
[1:32:36] give out something
[1:32:37] because you don't want to take the way
[1:32:39] of the Lord which at this point the
[1:32:42] devil is making is convincing you that
[1:32:45] it's hard
[1:32:47] oh man amen amen you don't know what
[1:32:51] people are going in this life what they
[1:32:53] are that they are I mean people are
[1:32:56] going through a lot of headache
[1:32:58] and just being where you are today you
[1:33:01] are blessed whatever you think like it's
[1:33:03] a headache talk to the people that don't
[1:33:05] believe this message and see what kind
[1:33:08] of turmoil they are in amen amen but all
[1:33:11] all God is asking you is simple
[1:33:16] amen amen amen amen
[1:33:19] it's very easy to open the refrigerator
[1:33:23] to get a drink
[1:33:25] it becomes a problem to take the bottle
[1:33:28] of juice and put it back in the
[1:33:30] refrigerator
[1:33:32] then it's a problem but when you want to
[1:33:34] go to the refrigerator to open and to
[1:33:36] take the juice you have the strength
[1:33:39] when you sit down you drink something
[1:33:41] and Mama come and say take the bottle
[1:33:43] put it back there then we fasting
[1:33:47] and we have a tendency to stand and
[1:33:49] leave that juice right there and go
[1:33:52] around upstairs come downstairs and that
[1:33:55] juice will stay ready and when somebody
[1:33:57] comes and say can you take that back to
[1:33:59] the refrigerator we start fussing you
[1:34:01] didn't fast when he was about going to
[1:34:04] get it you only fast when they're
[1:34:06] telling you to put it back watch your
[1:34:08] life
[1:34:10] all this depression you're coming up
[1:34:12] with I'm exhausted I'm too much I'm too
[1:34:14] much watch exactly what it is you just
[1:34:16] don't want to get under headship
[1:34:20] you don't want to give out
[1:34:22] you are fussing you want your way in
[1:34:25] that's why we are suffering and we are
[1:34:28] going up and down up and down up and
[1:34:30] down because we don't want to listen
[1:34:33] whoever heareth
[1:34:36] and do what they told you to do
[1:34:38] amen if we already preach something here
[1:34:41] you already heard it do what they tell
[1:34:44] you to do even though you don't feel
[1:34:47] like it but if you just obey obedience
[1:34:51] will entitle you to the token
[1:34:54] when you do that you're showing the
[1:34:56] devil that no matter what I'm going
[1:34:58] through I'm still gonna obey God
[1:35:01] and you are building your house in a
[1:35:04] solid rock
[1:35:05] it's as simple as it is it's not
