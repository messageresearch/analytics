was nothing there brother stephen but perfect love and i was telling her i said theresa we got to get rid of anything that does not respect perfect love in this life if there's going to be any change it's going to be now and it's got to be quick we've got to be like that little lady who lost a silver coin and if you see something that you're missing you better get desperate start sweeping the floor and throwing out all the trash and getting nothing but pure love in there because there ain't gonna be nothing but perfect love there and so we're sitting in the service tonight and that didn't sound like the tape we was listening to last week but whoever put the adoption number four on you were perfectly in the will of god because i played exactly the part that i was telling therese about this morning and brother was brother brandon was confirming there won't be anything but perfect love over there thank the lord jesus now father we're gathered tonight father in one heart we're here in one mind we're here in one accord as it was on the day of pentecost but for no other purpose but that we can get closer to you lord and lord we pray tonight that you come through your man's servant

a bodily healing father that that that was for both the healing of the body and the healing of the soul it was all under the atonement father and we're thankful for that lord sozo but father we're just praying for any unspoken request any need that hasn't been spoken lord that you'll meet that request lord and lord jesus christ that will rejoice when we get the testimonies father and tonight

are the same yesterday today and forever lord god and now father we bind up every demon force lord jesus that would try to trouble the hearts and the mind of your children's father because they didn't

and had a desire to be here in thy presence father meet their needs lord jesus so we give you praise we give you honor we give you glory and by faith we claim it all done in jesus name we pray amen amen amen i tell you it's just an honor to be here uh and pray for me this is my second service i didn't tell brother steve this is our second service today we had we had a good time earlier by the grace of god and um about eight souls turning their life over to the lord let's give the lord a clap often amen amen so i'm telling you what the lord is doing here he's able to fight those religious demons that's out there that got the people bound up and brother steve when you you'll see it was appropriate when you start saying a sign in assignments a commandment you'll see what the lord gave his eye i won't go the way that we went early this is just resting in my spirit so we better go under the leadership under the lord let's turn to the book of jonah and we thank you for your patience and standing here i'll tell you but we had a glorious time but uh sister when the lord anointed you to sing that song brother john just gave me strength huh hallelujah those who have jonah chapter 1 say amen amen and now the word of the lord came unto jonah the son of amitaya saying arise go to nineveh that great city and cry against it for the wickedness has come upon upon me may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated you know we got the inspiration by the grace of god from um uh running from the presence of god but we're not going to go that way tonight a little topic that was put on our heart is responsibility cry out responsibility cry out you know we come here it is our here now everyone has a responsibility everyone that god has saw me saw you before the foundation of the world we all have a responsibility so you'll see why it wasn't just the pastor it was the lord now i see we always look for a confirmation we don't want to come just in your presence just to be coming so you know we're looking at our hair now and god sent the message in this hour for us so that we can be live a victorious life but you know everyone has a responsibility of a father has a responsibility a man you know in that responsibility when he take on a wife when he takes on a wife and then they have children and when they have their children now he's there raising a family is that right but he's following in the order of the lord he said be fruitful and multiply is that right so god has given every one of us a responsibility and that man ahead of that household he's ready he's training his child up and where they should go when they grow old they won't depart from it is that right you will not have any problems there between father and mother and the children if the head of the household is leading his wife and his children according to the way of the lord okay so it's going to be is no excuse for this generation is that right so the wife has a responsibility and the responsibility that the wife she has she has there is to train those children she's there to be a wife and a good mother to a wife to the husband and the mother to the children is that right and not only that the lord say that the wife that mother is the fifth gospel is that right so she's that fifth gospel she's not just what letter only is that right she has uh her gospel is being ministered through her life and not only through her life she can do what she can pray for her children she can lay hands on her children she can move against the devil she can speak the word with authority when it's necessary is that right we're talking about everyone has a responsibility the hour is late saints and by the hour being late we're in a war and in his ward and sin we're in a real war but you know in this war the enemy has been coming in like a flood is that right but the lord said i will lift up the standard is that right he cannot lift up the standard unless you speak a word is that right god told us you must speak it right and for him to move you got to speak at them you can't look at your condition and not look at the promises of god is that right we have a responsibility cry out against this generation god has called us to let them know that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever we has a resurrected christ and that resurrected christ he's not dead but he's alive is that right god came down he was pleased when you sing the songs of zion she sang the song heroin crisis won he came down she was pleased she was singing to her lord is that right and god anointed her broke some yokes off the people everyone has a responsibility the musicians you have a responsibility where you come you come early you get prayed up you get anointed and you get anointed and you recognize god will bring a song to your heart you are singing with him singing to the lord we sing it to our lord the king of kings the lord of lord the prince of peace the almighty god you're in a war your responsibility when you're singing is breaking those yokes under the anointing the first sin now god said in second chronicles he send out the gifted singers out there first is that right you are being chosen brother john you're chosen by god you can't get out of it you've chosen by god you can't get out of it you have a responsibility well satan's in trouble tonight is that right we got nothing we have no use for satan we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and wickedness and rulers in high places we're fighting against and organized learning the enemy been fighting us left and right he's been coming at us on all sides but all we have to do is what speak the word is that right you keep moving forward speak the word that god is bringing to us in this hour here now you cry out we have the answer for satan's good we have the answer for satan's fiery thoughts we have the answer is that right if you're worried about me and i abide in you whatever you ask you shall receive we're in a war satan we're i mean saints we're in a real war but we're fighting a defeated enemy is that right we're not coming giving him no glory is that right when you got one person doing something and you got the enemy attack them is that right huh a precious brother when you got one person doing the job it's easy for the enemy to come at them is that right but when you got numerous ones moving like they're supposed to be moving moving in your position you don't know which way to come is that right a prayer is hitting them over there we're in a real war and we come to set it up huh you can't enter in here you can't come in here what god is bringing in this hour here now it was what the thunder was hidden up under the seals ah he didn't hide us from us he hid it for us i saved the best for last [Applause] nothing but positivity come out your mouth huh nothing but positive we pick the enemy back we send them back we're going to show you we're crying out against this age got to let them know soon the lord is about to come is that right cry out we all got a responsibility the teachers you got a responsibility this is a teacher and she's a teacher to teach those children because one day those children will become a teacher and then they'll be able to help someone along the way is that right daddy mama you're there to communicate with the teacher you're working together with the teacher you know your children when a teacher see their support from that parent is that right then they know they got support okay saints responsibility we crying out we got to get in position now is that right you can't it's time to move forward saints there's no more retreat no retreating on anything we know tribulations work with patients patients work experience experience workers hope but what that tribulation had experienced is building the character of jesus christ in you that's what he do he was too wise to make a mistake he was too righteous to do any wrong why wouldn't you want to be like that is that right we don't have to claim any sickness this is the hour here now and is that right we don't have to claim anything how many didn't know about a few weeks ago now don't let no brother steve that had a herniated surgery they never knew it why should i tell them huh i went and why did i do i still coming here praising the lord shouting rejoicing thanking god for giving me grace in his mercy claiming waiting on god had it for seven years seven years the wife didn't know she said did you know that i said yeah i knew i had it for seven years huh whole time lord what am i gonna do i got a wife to take care of huh lord i'm looking for a miracle huh i was trusting in him i was trusting in the lord when we left out of here when i came out of there that meeting out of the institution we got that i knew it was time i knew it was time brother steve he was in there fighting them religious demons and when he was fighting a religious demon a man started calling this message a cult but he couldn't help it he was the third generation and he was a third generation and our third generation he couldn't help it all we saw was religion because all you heard was religion but the holy ghost side gave us a message from up here that showed us uh about luther about calvinists is that right about wesley about arrhenius he was showing them they went too far to the left one went too far to the right though but god came and showed us the grace of god brothers this message is still real they went too far to it but the justification that god has brought in this hour here now i don't have to preach luther's justification anymore i've never done it you cannot put that in my mind does thou believe it cry out huh it's our responsibility cry out get up off your religious spirits get off of them religious demons huh i like to praise the lord i like to shout i like the dance but don't you shout don't you dance and run no higher than what you live in [Applause] huh a soul is precious in the eye sights of god huh with god we have a responsibility that teacher she has that responsibility when they come in and you treat that's christians and you're out there on that market you're learning you got you are the fifth gospel you can speak that word or you could pray for a child and you can expect for that child to get healed you can expect for that child to get delivered you should expect for that child to be saved cry out we have a responsibility new claiming them we go to god what do we pray lord i have some loved ones out there father you know lord they out there struggling they still in that field no no no no no no no lord thank you for bringing my son in thank you for bringing my daughter in thank you for bringing my uncle in thank you for bringing my honor i'm expecting it lord i'm looking for it to happen why i have a promise [Applause] speak it let them bring it to pass cry out see nineveh see jonah he didn't want to go to nineveh they told them you get a intellectual denominational teaching they'll say jonah was out of the will of god jonah was not out of the will of god we know jonah was a type of the resurrected christ isn't that right well that's how he was and he we know that god sent them on a mission and when he sent them on that mission if god sent you on a mission well that's why the pastor said everything is good god built this church the holy ghost leaves this church enemy can't come in here he's going to unturn every stone everything that's hidden god's going to whatever god didn't play he's going to root it up so you will receive your grace now huh you receive your grace your mercy now responsibility cry out god we're speaking the positive things jonah he was said to go to nineveh he wanted to go to tosh is that right god already knew he was going in his omnipotent god i'm their presence knowing all things all powerful he knew he was going to go there why do you think he created the fish didn't know he was going to go there huh they know he's going to go there why because he had to build his faith is that right when he got there so when he got over this jonah he didn't want to go because it was a gentile city is that right and by being a gentile city you know he didn't want to go there but god has sent him there to do what preach the gospel is that right i have some i have some people there uh they may look raunchy they may be rough looking but i got some people there i got some people in the concrete jungle i got some people in the bush i got some people in the trailer parks i got some people in the jails uh i got some people on the streets i got some people that's holding but go cry out tell them the lord is about to come [Applause] [Music] don't be afraid don't let that demon come prophet of god say one of the biggest demons that they got in the church now is there fear demon that's what he said fear demon but you know what he said god didn't give me the spirit of fear but he gave me love peace joy and a sound mind isn't that right cry out jonah he had to cry out and when he went in his message was to preach against the wickedness the sin the evil that was in there the message today preached against the sin and the wickedness that's there in the land right now we cannot be afraid we gotta preach the gospel the gospel will come in power in demonstration the gospel is sent to save souls hear the sick open the eyes of the blind cast out devil deliver a homosexual delivering a lesbian delivering an alcoholic delivering a murderer delivering a robber deliver a drug dealer deliver a gambler somebody that's bound with pornography somebody bailed with adultery fornication that's what the gospel did let them know that the gospel can set them free kaya responsibility everyone has it we get in there let us look this and see some of what some of the people in the scriptures had a responsibility anybody know in that garden adam had a responsibility and adam had a responsibility he was running the land huh but he listened to his wife you know what i tell them young men in an institution i go over and tell them young men in the institution you know brother brown said 90 percent of them locked up his buyer over a unsaved woman [Music] some of you go out there and let's start messing around in that world and some of the women start flattering you you better be careful huh you need to be careful but some of your sisters are trying to wear them garments you're drawing that out then you know they say you you well i better not say that but you know you get out there and you wear them garments out there they get around there you're going to draw the wrong type of man huh they're going to join the type of man i think it was over in solomon i think he was telling they need to look at their brother or their sister is that right huh and then we're going to look at it look at her eyes and see if she got the dove eyes is that right since you got the dirt of eyes the eyes tell you what's in there don't it and then you look at him you know we get older get a little wrinkle get a little droopy and all over but then my eyes stay the same don't think you got a response you got a responsibility tell your wife she looked nice is that right this ain't no legalistic walk and they're no capitalistic walk huh what are you looking for young men men you got a responsibility if the lord told us about over there in ezekiel what 16 and ezekiel 23 he told us about them about the lord alive and those two women that was there in that world when that child started reaching 13 now you take her pop you take that daughter you're the one to talk to her she's going to be your friend until god sent her husband along you got to keep you got a minister too you got to tell her that she looked like you got to tell her that she looked pretty you got to tell a honey you look sweet you got to say soft words to those sisters this is this message here is a balance is that right and now you quickly that's why i said we have to all have a responsibility so we're talking about that's why the holy spirit said last week now that man take this message take those notes you go home you look at them and when you look at them and your wife have a question you share with your wife is that right she can share it with your children now y'all both saying the same thing we all have a what responsibility that's what god is saying in his hour here now we got to realize god is doing some great things in this hour here now god has given us what what the holy spirit is saying elijah paul them desire to know these things that we're seeing they haven't not even seen these things we have we have a greater word because we have the fullness of the word right now is that right the seals the the thunders the seals they had to come to complete this from the making a full book is that right god said it had to come in his age here now and so if you it's a bible question it's a bible answer you don't want to hear it don't fuss with them we're no time to be fussing with people themselves out there those soldiers out there as many as so much of wickedness is growing in the land out there now we don't have to have the spirit of fear we keep praying when your prayer life you bind those spirits up you keep your children up under the blood until god bring them in you keep your loved ones up under the blood is that right hallelujah look what he says here help me lord we're talking about responsibility and crying out if you're taking your notes i don't have a boy like brother steve so you all got to bear with me i even brought my little pad here i'm trying to get better he said now look y'all [Music] he said now look he said now here we have adam thank you jesus we talked about adam adam was there and adam was running the earth at the time and when adam was running the earth at the time adam was given a responsibility adam had a great responsibility god has told us that god was running the universe god wasn't even god yet is that right until we came to chapter two he was a god of the god of object of worship and he became an object of worship but then the holy ghost showed us that what when he breathed the breath of life into adam adam became a what a living soul and now he did what locked his salvation in ain't that what the holy ghost said he locked his salvation in jesus said come unto me all those that labor in heavy laden and i will give you what ah my way is what make it lowly and i will give you rest for your what souls is that right so you come unto christ that's a great invitation we are out there we grant someone a great invitation come unto christ the one that can grant you eternal life and we're going to tell them the world is about to come to an end is that right the lord at the time that we're living in now we have to cry out seek those souls that's out there adam had that responsibility but when adam was there what did he do he listened to his wife is that right some of you men you need to get a backbone huh you need to get a backbone you need to take care of your family is that right did god call you in here if it's all right to listen to your wife and the holy ghost tell you to listen to her but if you're gonna let her listen to her she won't take you the wrong way no no no no no no no no i know some of you are not used to this but i just i'm telling you you gotta understand we don't want no jelly backs god don't need any jelly backs you're worse than an infidel and a man and a man and a man that blame his wife for anything he's a jelly back [Applause] when you cut if you come to my house brother glenn brother glenn is not excluded if you come to my house and my house ain't right i'm the blame [Music] that's god's words what are you telling us take it to the word what did he tell adam adam said that woman that you gave me ah god said i didn't give you the woman first i gave you my word you were supposed to say with [Applause] making no excuses it's time to come on up hither huh huh that's your rib that's the closest thing to you if you don't know how to i don't know what it is for but i better follow him if you don't know how to leave the fountain you need to come to someone and ask them this is not just to me this office carries authority a pastor's office it's a divine office it's a sign by god amen it carries certain authority i bet you get sick or you got to go to the hospital or something like that you get you run through the pastor on campus two three o'clock in the morning one prayer so your niece said no you need some kind of counsel and you don't come huh i don't know how we got on that but it's for somebody have your way lord hallelujah anyhow adam was running the earth and when adam was running the earth he had a responsibility and if your wife or someone get out of the line your children they get out of line you know you sit and you talk with them you tell them you tell them what you're supposed to do b what god's order is and you turn the way god's order is and then after god's order then you tell him now next time i'm gonna have to do like proverbs is that right i might have to not spare the rod is that right is that right that's why we didn't have any problems with wifi with our children i was fair i was friendly but i was firm you fair you listen to them you see what they have to say you're always listening faith come by hearing hearing the word of god you tell them in a loving respectable way what you're going to do and then you do it it's just that simple you do it right if you got one of those women there that get out of line get one more time whole time i'm praying lord i need help need help lord and he'll give you a word when they try to bring the law to jesus with that woman brother branham said he ignored them bent down and wrote in the same he ignored them sometimes you have to ignore them you got to understand the order the responsibility that god has given given us in this hour here now we've seen many homes in this message tore up because they would because they wouldn't put that wife in place they wouldn't put her in place i told the brother quick bro you better man to me i wouldn't put up with it no because you know why because you see the end results of it the end results of it that's why some of these children are suffering now in this message and they blame it trying to blame the wife no man you didn't put her in place when you first came together you should have met with her and talked with her if you love her you saw where she needed help at the other day i like to watch the the document the animal channel i like the animals i like to look at the animals some of you men sitting around here up under daddy and mama roof see i didn't have that 17 years old we had to go but i was gone so we got around and there they did we got over there you know they had the lion brother sam and that lioness and when they got over there the lions uh got there and uh they were hunting oh boy boy was rough to bring down so that sort of the male lions don't grew up and they grew up and they had to hunt so when they got out there they ran across a ball and they couldn't get that bull down they couldn't bring that ball down so when they got over there mama uh mama had to go get the bulls she went they got the bull and got on the juggler they ain't killed the bull and they ran over there and ate and after that last time mama killed something for me here come daddy get out of here go get your own food ella just tried you gotta go from up under this roof how long are you going to stay under that roof when you're going to grow up lord have your way hallelujah anyhow adam knew he had that responsibility but soon as adam there when adam fell what happened god who's rich in mercy didn't forget he didn't forget him so we went and slew that land but the first thing adam ran to was religion see when they get over here they don't want this here brother branham said in the end time they're going to say it's too strict too hard that's what they're saying so they're not sure they're straddling the fence you know it's something good but you can't go anywhere anyway it's because god put a seed inside of you before the foundation of the world you were only sitting here because god drew you hand you were sons and daughters of the most high god adam hallelujah adam he got there help me lord he said now look this is uh around paragraph 78 he said christie christianity is an everyday rugged life that's what he said brother sam it's an everyday it's an everyday rugged life living for god in this present world he said it's a constant burning of fire and love of god in the heart that sets you a fire and puts you out yonder with the people and making converts to christ responsibilities he said but it's easy to go the way of the world is easy to flow with the downstream see some people don't want to be talked about some people don't want to be put down well you know a living god is godly for christ you're going to have persecution he's going to come to you can't dodge it is that right so many saints want to dodge you can't die because of love love is what's driving you love is what's pushing you not the affiliated love the agape love that's what's pushing you that's what allows you to tolerate these things let me keep going he says go he says go out there and said he says when when things are flowing easy remember that going to a cataract down you're going towards the falls it won't be long you'll be going over that fall just floating with the world see remember you got a responsibility you wake up every day what god put you on his earth for what did god choose you for your call make sure you're calling and your election is sure know what god called you for he's called you for something he's called you to do the work you're part of this kingdom you're part of the kingdom of god god is now has given us a word he's opened up the whole bible to us we cannot fail jonah could not fail on that mission because god sent jonah on that mission god's chosen you he said look help me lord when he says now yeah he says judge floating with the world easy the way it goes you don't want that no sir but we must accept you must accept your responsibility he said no no this is from our prophet he says now you believe it you think it's the truth it's the truth he says and the responsibility he said that god has given us in this day to bring this message now you see why the devil's fighting so much up against it to bring this message and as i get and i know my days are shortening up i feel the responsibility greater than i ever felt before the pressure's on us like it's never been before saints god is showing us why because there's so much gross darkness on the land it's pressure coming on you you got to understand we know it's getting tougher to read your bible it didn't take to pray it's getting tough to do the things that you're supposed to do for the lord but we can say i look unto the hill to where my strength and my help come from the lord all you have to do is just start singing the song wait and say sister here comes the bride huh and god has said put a bride here on this earth that will not fail we are over achievers we are god has put trials and tests in front of us but he said we shall possess the gates of the enemy when after the trials is that right after the trial you have to be tried and tested you're not going to just cadillac out of here isn't that right no way hallelujah let me keep going you got to realize you're in the war you're in the war when god with jesus got finished when he got there brother steve when he got in he was he was a great mighty warrior before he left here oh lord is that right you had to fight the good fight of faith but you have to realize god is able to raise these what stones up is that right we the seed of abraham he has raised these stones up he's raised up drug addicts he's raised up prostitutes he raised up the alcoholic he's raised up film flammers he's raised up gamblers he raised up temperamental people he's raised up lesbians he's raised up alcoholics he raised up drinkers he raised them up he's able to do it all you have to do is trust in the lord in all thy ways lean not to thy own understanding leave he will lead and guide and direct thy path acknowledge him in all thy ways it's all about jesus huh every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess earnestly contending we're contending for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints look what he said said help me lord he said now look i'm jumping back to paragraph 55 57 then we'll look at some of these heroes you know responsibility he says being bought in the presence of god and seeing when god made a promise and god is obligated to that promise and when and when he brings that promise to pass then people are afraid to face up to the responsibility of coping with the message of the hour man they're gonna fight you every the devil gonna fight you every way he can for you not to get these mysteries that were promised to you some are falling away because some are dropping seeds on people huh you think the holy ghost don't know huh god is bringing us a plan the plan of redemption the holy spirit been saying now we're in the holiness of holy it's allowed me to go out and minister and show them the plan of redemption the tabernacle the fashion the design that was given to moses every age he showed us suddenly it was always a battle it was always a war he came in the false teaching but god always sent us a word to combat that false teaching in every age [Music] [Applause] we come in there first when you get there you have when we go to institution they say who have made a decision they didn't understand the decision but when god who rich in mercy would demonstrate to us ruth when he showed us ruth a true decision and we see how a true decision are designed in the scriptures not just accepting christ but the messenger of the hour came and told us that you accept jesus christ as your personal savior but you are not a christian yet you are a potential christian now when you go in among the religious demons and you sharing these kind of things with someone that wondered why they up they down and falling backwards in and out of the institution they back and forward because they never caught the true revelation of repentance a godless sorrow that brings a godly repentance that you will have to be repented of no more when god has bringing us those mysteries it's like a puzzle you got one piece missing and when they bring it to you and then you can fill it in guys fill in that gap that was missing out of someone's life about true repentance they don't want to be that way people don't want to be that way they don't want to be struggling with those things of the flesh but they need a word from the lord that's why they say a godless sorrow you can only have a godless sorrow when you get a word from the lord it got to be a revelation word from the lord god the truth corrects the error when you show them a true decision is a true repentance at the altar catching the revelation of calvary let the lord have been no longer under the leviticus law but we're under the melchizedek and god bring you grace and you can show them how to exodus 28 times you can show them the simplicity of the gospel it's not complicated now you can show them right there under the simplicity of the gospel you got to go first to the brazen old time when you get to the brazil note to what you got to truly repent first when you cry out you start telling people about the lord is about to come and they need their salvation you gotta have a word from the message of the hour to keep them so you have to realize now you can show that brazen old time that's where the sacrifice was made once you make it you make it once for all because now you got a true revelation of calvary at the cross at the cross where i first saw the light and the burdens of my heart rode away it was there by faith i received my sight now i'm happy all the day we move straight uh straight to earth straight into the world the labor is that right straight to the baptism come on now you can share these things with people you can help them show them the simplicity justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost and now we are moving to the what the adoption once you catch the revelation of the adoption you know you are predestinated you know you come from god we should be the most happiest people on the earth [Music] that's why parker said death where's thy sting oh grave where's thy victory glory be to god is that right we're talking about a responsibility paul had his responsibility when it came iranis has his responsibility columbus had his responsibility martin has his responsibility luther had their responsibility but in each age why god showed us it came with the lion is that right when they're lying paul but god gave paul a message during the lions time is that right come on saint john you don't have to speak the word then he can move in when the enemy come in like a flood he understanding god can raise the standard to stand in the what the standing of the word that come out of your mouth speaking the truth in love then he came along when he came around luther's age he came in that age there with the ox is that right he had to have luther luther had the cane be pulled away from the catholic church the just shall live by faith is that right so what god is bringing us giving us the revelation of this plan of redemption you can show them by the scriptures how god defeated the enemy he had a remnant in every age that's why he's talking about the virgins is that right five lives five food it was really more than ten it was just a parable that's all it was when you go in there and you realize because it was virgins out of every age is that right and so he was gonna use that there so we have to come in his hour here now that's why the holy ghost went and we were showing them and we showed them today what the holy ghost brought sunday morning i was able to share with some men today and set them free and they accepted christ as their personal savior i said because look god you got to realize there's only one god not three gods i'm not afraid to tell them you keep you look at that trinity that's why you're muslim and that's why a jew he could twist your mind up he know that it's only one god you're not going to give them no three gods out but when i told them jesus said uh matthew 28 18 19 go ye all the world preach the gospel in the name of the father son and holy ghost and then you can show them jesus is the father jesus is the son jesus was the holy ghost is that what we're talking about come on saint son then we show them is no promise there now we tell them you can grab information i'm not knocking hebrewing definition i'm not knocking arabic definition i'm not knocking those things but but information is not revelation information can lead to revelation but information is not revelation you need a prophet for your age to bring the revelation that's what i'm fighting against when i go out there but you know what god has given me the victory i'm standing for the message of the hour by his grace you go against him a muslim brother said who he said who is jesus who's jesus i say he's the son of god and he's god he said what you say i say he's the son of god and he's god he said who told you that i said god told me he walked away he said no more man now they got this thing on this see the younger generation when they go out there on the crew that's why i said brother steve our prayers is with you that's no man can open those things it's christ back on the scene again [Applause] it's christ in your midst it's christ in your presence it's christ there now you don't have to be afraid of no devil [Music] his name bro steve they got the announcer his name was yeshua and that's why he telling these afro-american kids his name is yeshua i said yeshua you know what tell him i said i said oh yeah i said where you get that from i went back that was the oldest name that was his first name i thought it was i said ain't nothing could go back far as christianity he said what you mean he said this was 300 years after the world of the no he said 300 years after whether the united states council was something he was telling i can't remember go lord forgive me but i looked at him and said 300 years before christianity i said where were you where are you before the world was from i could tell you where i was at i said i was in the mind of god there's no religion older than christianity no religion [Music] deliberate i said okay what's the revelation of it i said deliverer salvation there's only one name upon heaven and earth a man could be saved by i said yeshua is jesus christ hallelujah that's what you're fighting against out there religion intellectual religion that's why they got a mess in the message because now god is unfolding it he's unfolding and bringing it to him they are responsibility i don't have that responsibility moses had a responsibility the responsibility that was given to moses son is that right and moses no they was in bondage for over 400 years but god said he was going to send a deliverance and a deliverer that he was going to send to and he said moses son and moses had to go but moses was like panasonic brother john that commercial slightly ahead of his time is that right god was going to use him but he got around in there and when he got there and he had to realize him so moses had to go to a strange land but moses had a responsibility he was going to bring god's people out is that right moses couldn't get out of his responsibility god told moses moses met the pillar of fire moses came before the burning bush moses had a responsibility moses was going to stand there on the word of god and moses went down there and when the anointing came on him is that right moses was against all sorcery moses was fighting against all witchcraft and we are fighting today younger generation third generation you're going to be powerful you're going to be tough you're not going to be able to be moved with nothing you don't have the nomination to be moved out of just to those children to be powerful keep the word in them third generation children rising up they have nothing in them but the word is that right nothing but the pure unadulterated word is coming out of moses he come there went to pharaoh he had to face all those devils we got 200 million demons loose out here today is that right 200 million demons loose got people bound up they don't want to be that way god's given us the say the lord to be able to set some people free we're able to tell them that christ is here back on the scene let them recognize let them know that christ is able to save their soul to deliver them save their family keep them we're not worrying about putting them in them is that right we're not worrying about them bob because what the lord said keep an eye on the bamboo curtain keep an eye on the purple curtain keep an eye on the iron curtain but what did he say huh huh he said but uh you gotta wonder now that catholic church was just hiding there laying back god you gotta understand uh everybody's running the country no you're not running the country how you running the country and people stealing this message stealing this message dealing with politics you know it's deal with the devil you know what it is you can go over there when he came to jesus is that right he came to jesus and he said if you worship me then out you can have all these things is that right took them high up on the pinnacle satan was running it is that right still dealing with politics and then this is huh somebody i guess is going out internationally y'all pray for me huh he's the second catholic president that we ever had is that right huh second catholic president that we ever had you know running the show nancy is catholic con man the national defense did not a catholic he got seven out of nine supreme court justice catholics what's the difference when nebuchadnezzar was in charge huh it's here it's not coming this here they know who you are they know who you are he's not coming at anybody but you know what we're because he can't touch us is that right he said he can't touch us you know why brother sam they could say they could do whatever they want to but we have a responsibility and we can't leave here until our responsibility is taken care of is that right huh look what the lord is doing for us in his hour here now he's doing great things you got to cry out and you cannot be afraid jonah was afraid so you couldn't cry out but god had to put his back up against the wall you think the pastor some of you don't want to press your way out you miss them jobs huh you go on them jobs and you stay away from them jobs and don't go on those jobs and see how long you have those jobs huh but you're just coming here because you don't free more will is that right you know what freeman will god's a gentleman he's not going to force you to do anything huh he said when you got to the up rather than the serving when they got into serving they was in the holy place is that right out in that holy place what they have to do huh you're gonna free more will now now you're free more will see that's what's so christian that's why the holy ghost went down to first john 5. in first john 5 and he was showing you that one you could be just you could be justified and not sanctified you could be sanctified and don't have the holy ghost you say the lord showed us that and those are not one they are green one is that right the father the word and the spirit are what what right see so now you cannot be separated once the holy ghost comes in there now once the person he comes there you're in that holiness of holy now you want him to take over your life he will lead you he will guide you he's your fortress he's your buckler he's your power he's your prayer life he's everything he's the fullness of the book we look joshua and we're about to wind it up joshua joshua was on a mission moses was dancing and when moses joshua had a responsibility and when johnson had a responsibility and that responsibility that joshua joshua had god send them out to wipe out the amalekites and he had to wipe them out but god told joshua that i'm with you you're going to take them out but they told them what now joshua got there and he knew god had sent them on that mission but so the enemy wouldn't rise up there against them the sun was about to go down and joshua knew god sent them on that mission when an enemy coming like a flood i would lift up a mighty standing against him moon stands still son stands still is what you say is what you speak [Music] god is bringing us we're on the mission saints let me keep reading responsibility pastor got a response thank you jesus pastor got a responsibility deacon's got a responsibility trustee's got a responsibility the musicians got its responsibility the laity got a responsibility then now he said go to the lord of harvest and he said you pray and who did he tell them to pray the saints had to pray too isn't that right so that he would send laborers to the harvest we all got a responsibility we got to cry out you're in a real war and when you're praying and in that prayer life it gets a little heavy sometimes and but just like the sister sang the song i thank you when you get a little heavy sometime brother steve you gotta lay down there thank you glory for my salvation thank you lord for my help thank you lord for the holy ghost thank you lord for your word thank you lord for this thank you lord for my job thank you lord for my health thank you lord for my clothing thank you lord for my finances thank you lord for my transportation thank you lord for my homie thank you lord for my wife thank you lord for my husband thank you lord for my children just start thanking them in your breakthrough it'll work think on these wise if there's any virtue what's pure what's holy what's righteous huh you got to stop feeling sorry some feel sorry some of human sympathies nothing wrong with it temporarily but human sympathy and compassion is two different things huh my wife i love my wife she used to get around there and i said she has to cry don't crack without crying she's going to get me now since the crystal crawled out cries boy we get around in there you know i used to wait i used to wait i'm young in your marriage you learn and cry let them wait thank you i said okay honey now what were you saying oh she gonna get me that's okay but after 47 years she's not going anywhere [Music] [Applause] you have to realize when joshua came look what he says lutheran let's bring it on up to our time luther we lose the he had a responsibility they wanted they had to move but the ones that didn't want to move to wesley and then they stayed there and then at the wesley they had pentecostal when the pentecostal lord showed shoulders not the pentecostal denomination not the pentecostal organization nobody moved us into that pentecostal experiences that's right and then that they came now it's the message of the hour and those that is in the message of the hour then they don't want to move now until the mystery to the seals and to the thunders to the ages is that right it's always been that way it's nothing nude it's up under the sun so now we have to understand we had a responsibility jesus had a responsibility when jesus came here on earth god said a child shall be born a son shall be given his name shall be called counselor the mighty god the prince of peace he had to fulfill the scriptures is that right it had been those in the old testament when they got there and jesus he went to the cross those old testament saints there was some righteous it was some wise they did present the sacrifices righteously they did present those things because jesus had to go to calvary and die and when he went down to the grave he had to resurrect those dead saints is that right old testament saints and so when we're talking about now in this hour here now we got a message and the message we are to tell them christ is soon to come and at the crisis soon to come we have to realize that only the thing is going to save them is the baptism of the holy ghost repent be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost it's a promise unto you and your children and those that are called afar off we have to cry out saints we got the plan of redemption god has gave it to us he's brought it in every age we have to stand for this message the message of the hour that god has given up he said look here he says now he says what about you pentecostal that received the restoration of the gifts help me lord he said when the baptism of the holy ghost come out with speaking in tongues and gifts of the spirit coming back into the church he says why the method is wanting to kick you out and he says but you but you faced up to it it was something you had to do it's something we have to do in this hour here now and stand for this message because the message down is christ it's not going to fail you when you get around in there you speak those things is that right sister you getting ready for your child then when you pray you pray you know what you pray father you said i would not be unfruitful i will not be unbearable you said [Applause] [Music] oh god what's too hard for god nothing too hard for our god we serve almighty god an awesome god a great god he said hi brother caleb you said [Applause] [Music] you said i read a few things you said lord it's time for us to cry out we're not afraid we got the answer to the kingdom of satan you stand for the pastor you pray for the pastor keep them up in prayer stand for there's no time for murmuring and complaining [Music] if they get a flat tire say something good satan wants you to murder me ain't complaining if you get a migraine headache leave this head leave my mind in the name of jesus christ son claim your job claim your children god you said father is my word abide in me and i abide in you whatever you're at you can't

in school they have a strong problem with certain classes i remember one day i got there in my middle one oh by sleep i think i was sleeping about 15 hours a week i was working third shifting and i

that the responsible one are either the song leader or the musician or the preachers no we all got a responsibility amen when the service goes right and everybody is blessed it's probably somebody somewhere has been praying amen amen maybe i had a lot of things going on and i didn't spend much time in prayer the way i showed by your prayer are backing me up to preach the gospel so you are fulfilling your responsibility never forget your responsibility amen never forget your responsibility your responsibility is crying out and matter of fact if you find out what your responsibility is in life try to get your entire life and wrap it around that responsibility you will see what god will do for you do you understand what i'm saying do you understand what i'm saying if i know that god called me to be a pastor everything i do now is running through the pastors everything my entire life there are stuff i cannot do because i'm a pastor there are things even if i want to move i cannot just move because i'm a pastor before i move i'm thinking about the church i'm thinking about the people of the church i'm thinking is it really time for me to travel or not i have people pulling but i'm looking and saying no the church is young i need to stay there and make sure they're all grounded in a scripture not that i don't want to travel but the responsibility is molding my life differently do you see what i'm saying i'm not saying do not travel i'm not saying do not take vacation but look at your responsibility and look what you're doing with your life are you neglecting the responsibility because of your personal agenda or are you looking at the responsibility first i tested it and i can give you testimony after testimony get your responsibility with god first amen you won't have to push hard in your life you take care of god's business god will take care of you it's it's guaranteed 100 amen there are people that are chasing after the responsibility at the responsibility and neglecting god and later on you're gonna find yourself with a lot of headache that you still need that god that you neglected to come back around again amen amen if we go to the rapture what are you going to do with what you're trying to achieve what are you going to do with your house what are you going to do with your car what are you going to do with that big property you're trying to achieve what are you going to do with the money that you're going to leave in the bank when the rapture come are you going to take your money from the bank you will remember one thing the responsibility that you have neglected amen before you move how do you impact god's responsibility before you do something what are you doing to god's responsibility amen maybe god put you to do something else make that the best of your life you will see what god will do amen situations are diff are not difficult christian life is not complicated deliverance is not complicated most of the time we create our own trial and we blame also on the devil and the devil turn around and say what have i done they're the one that just created their own trial i know what i'm talking about amen you're sitting peacefully and you yourself put yourself into a big project and that project take you into a certain lifestyle and that lifestyle pulls you away from the church and you find yourself out why you the one that created it because you're trying to achieve something seek ye face the kingdom of god amen and everything will be given unto you if i take vacation all the time how are you going to be some will be waiting for me with coats over there to tell me that the pastor should stay here you want me to be here i want your musician to be there i want you also to be on your on your place there to say a man to the world so i'm here you not there i'm here on sunday you're not there i'm here on sunday three weeks another day i'm fulfilling my responsibility you are lacking on your responsibility because there are other things that you put before god take time when you're on a day off instead of running to the shopping center sit at home look at your life maybe 10 years look at what you were doing before in your christian walk did he help you progress or not if not change the system is it okay you cannot continue to do the same thing that is not helping you something is wrong somewhere amen amen something is wrong somewhere there is a responsibility give god with responsibility first everything will be okay amen amen everything will be okay when you do that guarantee the devil will come to trouble you to show you that you made the wrong decision but if you hold tight you will find out that you can live without working that day there are laws in the scripture amen you can make more money and spend more and you can make less money and save more depending on what you do with god i know what i'm talking about you can make more money and be completely worn out you go home you sleep you wake up you go back to the work you go walk home you sleep you go back you go to the work and your life is just like that until your body is not even resting that's not the life that god wants you to leave the bible says that the blessing of the lord maketh rich and he added no sorrow to it are you going to work like that 20 years are you going to be working like that 30 years is your body again to go on over time all the time you need something better there is a god that can take the pressure off if you go back and go back into your position and give him responsibility give him his responsibility god will richly bless you amen stop worrying about the problem stop lingering too much on a trial the more you linger on the trial you're gonna cause a complex do you follow me if you if even if something happened stop regretting deeply because you are pushing that thing into your subconscious there is no trial that can come in you that is greater than your strength everybody okay so when you start lingering on the problem something happened oh my god everything is bad everything bad happened to me you are just creating something for yourself and before you know it it's in your subconscious and then the next trial come you will forget about the first trial that you already put in your in your subconscious and you never pull it out now you got five layers of trials and when we're trying to deal with casting three the two are already forgotten you're not even conscious of them and you wonder why you're not happy no there was some do you understand what i'm saying can i get two minutes can i get two minutes man jesus what i'm trying to say is this problem number one happened you worry too much around and because of problem number one you stop being happy amen then the devil shoot another child number two do you do you follow me when number two come er wrap around number one you begin to forget number one but it's still there everybody okay when the devil shoot number three and number four you don't even realize number one was still hidden there amen when they ask you you will say that problem number one maybe your husband did something against you but problem number five was that your child fell in school in a test amen when you are worrying if i ask you a question you will tell me this is the problem but it's not really this the problem we can pray about this and your child get good grade but you still not happy because you bury four of them anybody care amen until you don't know what can make you happy do you do you understand what i'm saying you don't even know what can make you happy your husband doesn't make you happy anymore the job that you were worrying about you got a good job but it's still like you're not happy because you bury a lot of sorrows everybody okay when something happened take the problem put it aside look how many good things god did for you do you follow me you say wait a minute we got food in our home i pay my bill i pay my mortgage the car is running good what is this problem here that's how you take it away anybody here because when you go up like this you will begin to live in a happy defeated life and it's gonna lead you into ungratefulness you're not even grateful of what the lord is doing for you until they ask you have you been in a hospital no so there are people that go to hospital all the time but they are happy you never been in a hospital for since january why are you not happy no you're not happy because of one problem that is not working the way you want it to work and now the the the children are neglected because of that one problem your happiness will be solved the day that problem will be solved but before that problem is solved the devil will add three mores and when that one is solved you can't have happiness because you are conditioning you in other words your happiness doesn't look at the circumstances you're going through do you follow what i'm saying stop worrying about stuff if something is not working fine it's not going the way you want it put it in the hands of god go to sleep if not you will find yourself you can't sleep anymore because you bury so many things in your life you were worrying about this you were worrying about this you were worrying about this you were worrying about this and before you know it you don't know what to do and probably the lord already solved two but you you you are even unconscious that oh maybe i was worrying about this and the lord already solved it he doesn't even come to your mind anymore because the devil got you bound you are looking for an imaginary happiness when happiness are there there are people that want to be like you happiness is not in money happiness is not how much money you have in a bank account there are people that have money in the bank account there are people that are driving expensive car they are not happy they cannot sleep they on sleep pills all the time they're under psychiatrists they own big houses why because they thought that was happiness happiness is a person [Music] anybody care happiness is jesus christ amen amen amen happiness is not the card if he gives you a call you say praise the lord but as long as i have jesus that's enough amen he can give you that car he can give you a good job he can give you everything he wants to do anybody care but stop conditioning their happiness because of something you're going to make your life miserable you're gonna make your children miserable for three years because your dream house is not fulfilled yet but the lord gave you one why are you not happy on the one the lord gave you but because you didn't get the one you want all this life your husband see a sad woman at home all the time because she wanna have the house like the jonases while other people don't even have what you have that's not happiness my friend you're gonna drop into this state is called amnesia brother branham say it happened because of shock in life he said the military get it something happened deeper and that's it and you get this issue and no matter what god begin to do in your life you are like almost you don't sense anything [Music] christian life is a joyful life it is a war it is not a flowery bed of ease it doesn't mean when we laugh we don't have problem no i'm laughing because god gave me a breath of life today and i'm working i have a job i can pay my bills i thank god for it if i make five hundred dollars i say thank you jesus if i make a million dollars i'm gonna say thank you jesus i'm not gonna say thank you jesus only when i got a million dollars that's a wrong way to go with life everybody okay make your house a joyful place be happy at home amen enjoy the car god gave you if that car broke down on the highway you would know what it means and it's raining you will know what it means to have that car that you don't even appreciate it as long as you can drive thank god pray him to give you something else it's a responsibility amen stop creating your own trial stop generating trial push the break in your life slow down slow down your life nothing is complicated you're finding your husband you're fighting yourself you're thinking you're trying to make a point you're not making a point you're making yourself miserable while others are happy with their husband have you ever lived without a husband have you ever lived without a wife so stop making a mess when there is no mess enjoy the time the lord gave you let's stand there amen enjoy the time the lord gave i don't know if the lord will allow me to maybe one of this day we will talk to you about those four areas in marriages amen you don't jump into marriage and then begin to draw benefit let me leave it alone amen let me just leave it alone one of this day you will understand what i'm saying amen yeah that's the illusion that we get from hollywood yeah why did the lord put courtship before marriage 90 of people don't even know why they put courtship before marriage have you ever wondered why we call it courtship but what we do in courtship is not courtship we are under infatuation [Music] on the faking stuff the courtship have a responsibility if you miss that courtship what you when you're getting married you're not really getting married you're actually getting into a courtship that's why you start the fight because you miss your courtship have you ever thought about it do you know what i'm saying [Music] they gave you why why does the bank have to spend so much time with the underwriter before they approve you alone because the bank doesn't want to play with their money they want to make sure they trace everything before the bank can send you a letter and say they approve you because the underwriter will pull stuff and then he comes back you say thank the lord the lord is done you you bought houses you know what i'm talking about before you know it you see him shooting an email he need this this this and then you get mad you say this underrated what does he want again he's doing his due diligence because the decision they're trying to get is a serious decision that's the reason why the answer android the underwriter is pulling a lot of string to make sure the bank is protected do you think marriage is a game continue to think let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly tonight father once again thanking you for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father you speaking so much in this church until you can go home and sit and see things that we didn't even catch while you were speaking because you unfolded your words so in a great way that it's almost overwhelming to realize that we unworthy people can be lord father exposed to such a great benefit in this end time father we thank you for it and tonight father you spoke about responsibility and responsibility goes everywhere he goes in every aspect of our lives he started from our home all the way to our jobs further everywhere even on the road we have a responsibility we gotta follow the traffic we gotta do all of this everything have responsibility father may you continue to minister to your children to give them revelation of what the responsibility is because when you send us here on earth there is a specific purpose that you send us and further you have programmers and kept us for the last age because you knew lord father what you put in us that is gonna be only developed under the message of the hour in the last day father may the holy spirit lord father drop again and shower that predestinated seed to unfold again more and more lord father the very purpose that you send us on earth because your prophet told us that your will in our life is a mystery and he said that each one should pray to know the will of god for their own life lord and once we know it clearly we can wrap our life around it lord and see everything moving just like moses when he went to egypt whatever was on his way he could knock everything out father because he knew that he was in his line of duty when joshua lord father went into the battle you didn't tell him that he will be speaking there to the sun and the moon but lord father because he went he was under his duty his call his calling lord and he fell under his responsibility when saul when lord trouble arose he didn't think twice an inspiration dropped quickly that could remove completely the trial because he was under his his responsibility father may we understand lord the importance of staying under our responsibility and wrapping our life together because our success in this life cannot be fulfilled if we are not connected to the purpose that you send us in this earth lord that's why lord father we don't want to waste time anymore spinning and going around the mountain left and right but father we want to stay center father put lord straighten our responsibility and lord father make our journey for the last push a lot to be easy lord because we have found the purpose lord father that you send us on this world in this world lord i pray that you protect your children and give them travel mercy and if that terror to come may you continue to consecrate us and to prepare us for the service on sunday we commit everything lord unto the hand and humbly ask it in the name of jesus christ amen go ahead brother satan you can dismiss i am standing on the promises i am standing still standing standing on the promised says still i am standing on promises of god [Music] standing [Music] standings [Music] oh i am [Music] standing on the promises of christ my savior [Music] promises of god [Music] standing on the promises of christ my king
