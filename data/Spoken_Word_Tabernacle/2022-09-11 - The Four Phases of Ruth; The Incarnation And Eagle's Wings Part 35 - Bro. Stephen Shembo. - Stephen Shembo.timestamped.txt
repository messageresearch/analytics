[25:52] we'll read the prayer requests and pray
[25:56] we have one special this morning amen
[25:59] and I think it's going to be a very good
[26:01] one
[26:03] God bless your Saints
[26:06] we all believe that east west home is
[26:09] best right
[26:10] naturally and spiritually
[26:12] so we are here but we know that home is
[26:15] best so naturally most of us here
[26:19] we came from different parts of the
[26:21] world and even though we are here we
[26:24] always think of home right so we
[26:28] um
[26:29] for us also east west home is best which
[26:32] is Kenya and we had a small home that we
[26:37] had built
[26:39] for our retirement as we wait for the
[26:42] Lord and we had drilled oh well
[26:46] to serve the water in the home and
[26:50] because we are here and you know how it
[26:52] is those who come from home if you're
[26:54] not there you can send money and that
[26:57] money can be used
[27:00] yes
[27:01] so we we thought we had a professional
[27:04] that was vouched by so many people but
[27:08] he ended up doing a half job and that
[27:11] well sucked
[27:13] um that was a lot of money down the
[27:15] drain so we had to do it again this time
[27:17] we really tried to sort for people that
[27:21] we thought we knew and that you know had
[27:25] a lot of testimonies and really prayed
[27:28] about it and we believed that we got the
[27:31] right person he did the job the well
[27:33] worked fantastically for about a year
[27:36] and a half
[27:37] and then the water that was coming out
[27:39] of the world during a rainy season all
[27:42] of a sudden was like the carpet
[27:45] and so that was very disheartening we
[27:48] realized that the there was a pipe that
[27:52] he was supposed to have put drilled down
[27:55] but because he thought that the area was
[27:57] Stony had a lot of stone he decided to
[28:01] take that
[28:02] um
[28:03] that pipe out so that your water was
[28:06] sipping into the well so when the pump
[28:08] when you pump it the water was actually
[28:10] like the carpet
[28:12] so by the time my pressure sister was
[28:14] coming it was looking like almost
[28:17] golden trying you know kind of once it
[28:21] settles you know how when you get dirty
[28:22] water it settles it's not very clean but
[28:25] it's kind of like that color
[28:29] so we had we were to look for another
[28:33] person to rectify that situation but
[28:36] we were so disheartened we really just
[28:39] committed into the Lord personally I was
[28:42] like Lord
[28:43] can't be do something Lord do something
[28:46] else we waited at one point we almost
[28:49] had someone go in to repair that but
[28:52] then you know something just didn't
[28:54] sound right didn't sit right and we
[28:56] canceled it
[28:58] so
[28:59] during this rainy season I asked my
[29:02] sister how the water was and he said
[29:04] well it's clean very clean I asked her I
[29:07] said well pump the water again
[29:10] so for the last two months it's been
[29:12] raining a lot
[29:14] and the water is perfectly clean
[29:27] so the Lord had our prayer and he fixed
[29:30] whatever it is I didn't want to give
[29:32] this testimony you know soon because I
[29:34] wanted to make sure that it was really
[29:37] done so the last and it's been still
[29:40] raining heavily heavily raining but the
[29:43] water is clean so glory and honor to the
[29:46] Lord
[29:47] [Applause]
[29:54] all right
[29:55] okay
[29:57] sister our coats is doing really good
[29:59] too
[30:00] so that's great we want to remember her
[30:03] every day every day
[30:07] I have one other prayer request here

[30:12] husband Charles senior is going through
[30:15] a fight in his body this morning so

[31:18] word in your promise Lord blessed with
[31:20] those who are the tasks and offerings

[31:47] to Charles Hamilton to see you Lord
[31:49] amen
[31:51] [Music]
[32:03] y'all might be seated now um I know the
[32:07] address for Rebecca's wedding next next
[32:09] Saturday has been on the board but it's
[32:12] it's kind of a hard background if you
[32:14] wanted to take a picture so I printed up
[32:15] something that would and put it out
[32:17] there that would make it um a little
[32:19] easier to see
[32:20] this morning
[32:22] so we look forward to it finally
[32:26] come on up brother
[32:29] sing this song okay man
[32:32] God bless you everyone
[32:36] a few weeks ago the Lord allows sister
[32:38] Laurel to say um how to battle his
[32:40] radiant more more
[32:42] and um sometimes you think that is
[32:45] something that you do sometimes or maybe
[32:48] this storm is coming because it's
[32:49] something that I did you're trying to
[32:50] correct me or bring me back in the
[32:52] middle of the road
[32:53] but uh the Lord had brother Kelly say
[32:56] last week how on Wednesday rather that
[32:59] when these things happen is God trying
[33:01] to perfect our character
[33:03] so I was in fellowship with my family
[33:05] last night and I said you know I believe
[33:07] that because it's getting so close
[33:11] you can't have
[33:13] the opportunity in God's kingdom to rule
[33:16] unless you have character
[33:19] so I said well Lord it seems to me that
[33:21] we're getting ready to rule
[33:24] because all of these things that are
[33:25] taking place
[33:27] so sometimes I get to a point
[33:30] like every other believer to where you
[33:32] just want to stay in a channel to just
[33:34] hear what God will have you do
[33:36] period you know not so much what the uh
[33:39] comes from the ministry but you want to
[33:42] catch what God is saying through the
[33:43] ministry to you as an individual
[33:46] and um
[33:47] I believe it's just to a point where no
[33:50] matter what condition that we're in we
[33:52] have to come to let the devil know whose
[33:54] side we're on regardless
[33:56] because even if he can't get us to a
[33:58] point to where he gets us to lose Faith
[34:01] he tries to tap into our spirit to get
[34:03] us to lose Joy sometimes
[34:05] so by God's grace I come to praise the
[34:08] Lord today
[34:16] I don't know what you come to do
[34:20] come on now y'all you and you and you
[34:24] and you

[56:31] dare you can say Amen now the serpent
[56:34] was more subtle you might be seated than
[56:37] any beast of the field which the Lord
[56:40] God has made and he said to the woman
[56:45] yea as God said You shall not eat of
[56:49] every tree of the garden amen did God
[56:53] ever spoke to the serpent
[56:58] God never spoke to the serpent
[57:00] God spoke to Adam
[57:03] amen but where did the serpent learn
[57:05] this
[57:07] everybody okay
[57:09] everybody okay so he learned it from
[57:12] somebody else
[57:13] we okay and we know in the Garden of
[57:15] Eden we have two trees
[57:19] I'm using a military aircraft
[57:23] so you need to have your helmet
[57:27] I hope you slept good I hope you had
[57:30] your breakfast
[57:31] and everything okay
[57:39] if I would have preached this on
[57:41] Wednesday some of you won't catch up
[57:43] because of the way things are coming I'm
[57:46] giving you some time a week purposely
[57:50] amen and let another Minister use the
[57:53] pulpit while you're still catching up
[57:55] and reviewing and soaking before we add
[57:58] more but you take the whole weekend you
[58:01] span it
[58:03] without doing what you're supposed to do
[58:05] and now you're lost
[58:10] now the serpent we know he starts
[58:13] speaking in the Garden of Eden we have
[58:15] two trees one was the tree of the
[58:18] knowledge of Good and Evil who was that
[58:20] tree
[58:22] who was that tree
[58:24] he was the devil Satan now
[58:27] amen
[58:29] and we know Satan wanted to endure
[58:32] something we already went through that
[58:35] amen now the serpent
[58:39] begin to speak something about the tree
[58:42] of the knowledge of Good and Evil amen
[58:45] who taught the serpent
[58:50] everybody okay according to brother
[58:52] Branham Satan entered the serpent
[58:59] everybody okay so this devil left from
[59:03] just being in the Garden of Eden the
[59:06] devil incarnated
[59:10] are you following me
[59:12] the devil incarnate
[59:17] the serpent
[59:20] and this serpent we know was a beast
[59:25] anybody here because the message that
[59:28] the serpent is speaking doesn't belong
[59:31] to him
[59:35] everybody okay
[59:36] everybody okay
[59:38] remember Peter was saying certain things
[59:41] and Jesus turned around Jesus never say
[59:44] get thee behind me Peter
[59:46] Jesus understood who was talking through
[59:49] Peter
[59:52] we okay
[59:54] glory to God
[59:56] verse 2 and the woman said to the
[59:59] serpent we may eat of the fruit of the
[1:00:02] Trees of the garden
[1:00:04] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[1:00:07] the midst of the garden God has said You
[1:00:10] shall not eat of it neither shall you
[1:00:13] touch it lest ye die so the woman had a
[1:00:17] voice but this is the voice of God
[1:00:19] because Eve was not there
[1:00:21] everybody okay
[1:00:23] glory to God and the serpents say to the
[1:00:27] woman you shall not surely die
[1:00:31] in other words the serpent contradicted
[1:00:34] God
[1:00:37] everybody care what I'm trying to get
[1:00:40] you understand is it is not the serpent
[1:00:46] do you follow me this serpent is a
[1:00:49] mouthpiece
[1:00:54] amen in other words the serpent is a
[1:01:00] prophet
[1:01:09] I'm going slowly
[1:01:11] I wish I can get where I want to take
[1:01:13] you to do amen you need to stay alert
[1:01:17] glory to God
[1:01:20] brother Branham say a prophet
[1:01:24] is a reflector
[1:01:26] of God
[1:01:31] did you hear me another word it's very
[1:01:34] easy
[1:01:35] for you to get confusion
[1:01:41] very easy for you to be confused
[1:01:46] everybody clear
[1:01:47] to make a difference between a prophet
[1:01:50] and God
[1:01:56] do you hear what I'm saying if you're
[1:01:59] not careful you can mistake a prophet to
[1:02:03] be God
[1:02:05] because the prophet reflects God
[1:02:10] but he is not God
[1:02:14] do you understand what I'm saying
[1:02:18] when David was saying my father my
[1:02:21] father why have Thou forsaken me was
[1:02:23] David crucified
[1:02:25] but David spoke like it's him
[1:02:30] but he was not David he was the spirit
[1:02:34] of God he was crushed in David
[1:02:40] everybody okay that's why the Bible said
[1:02:42] David was a prophet
[1:02:47] brother Branham say a prophet is a
[1:02:49] reflector of God
[1:02:51] he is made so that he cannot speak his
[1:02:55] own words
[1:02:56] [Applause]
[1:02:56] [Music]
[1:02:58] everybody okay
[1:03:00] he has to be God's word that he speaks
[1:03:04] he is just a water
[1:03:06] he's just like a reflector he is God
[1:03:10] water that's why the prophet usually he
[1:03:13] said that saves the Lord in other words
[1:03:16] I am not the one speaking this is God
[1:03:18] speaking through me God who in Sandra
[1:03:22] times an in diverse manner spoke to Our
[1:03:26] Father by the
[1:03:27] Hebrew 1 1.
[1:03:32] the Bible said in the book of
[1:03:33] Deuteronomy 18
[1:03:35] that I will raise up them I will raise
[1:03:38] them up a prophet from among their
[1:03:41] Brethren like unto thee Moses and I will
[1:03:45] put my word in his water so God takes
[1:03:50] his words
[1:03:53] are we okay and he take those word and
[1:03:57] goes to the prophet and put in the mouth
[1:04:00] of the prophet
[1:04:02] anybody care so when the prophet is
[1:04:04] speaking it is not really the prophet
[1:04:07] speaking
[1:04:09] it is God that is speaking when the
[1:04:12] serpent is talking
[1:04:14] it is not the serpent
[1:04:17] it is the devil in the serpent
[1:04:23] are we okay
[1:04:25] the Bible says that I will put my word
[1:04:27] in his mouth
[1:04:29] and he shall speak unto them all that I
[1:04:32] shall do what
[1:04:33] and he spoke by the mouth of his water
[1:04:38] God speak through a prophet
[1:04:41] amen amen so when the serpent is
[1:04:45] contradicting the word of God the
[1:04:47] serpent was created by God
[1:04:50] amen and the only adversary we know of
[1:04:54] God was the devil
[1:04:57] amen so when the when the serpent begin
[1:05:00] to speak the language of the devil
[1:05:05] anybody here and begin to teach if
[1:05:09] about a different tree because in verse
[1:05:13] 4 5 the Bible says this is a serpent
[1:05:17] talking that for God does know that in
[1:05:21] the day you eat thereof then your eyes
[1:05:23] shall be open and you shall be as God's
[1:05:27] knowing water
[1:05:29] the proud now the serpent become the
[1:05:32] prophet he became the teacher
[1:05:41] he became the prophet but because he's
[1:05:45] going contrary to the word of God he is
[1:05:49] a false prophet
[1:05:52] but here or he is a false teacher
[1:05:59] everybody care everybody okay another
[1:06:02] word this serpent you can have a
[1:06:06] difficulty separating him from Lucifer
[1:06:13] everybody okay that's why the Bible says
[1:06:17] this that the Great Dragon was cast out
[1:06:21] the water
[1:06:23] old shop and call who
[1:06:25] now the devil became the serpent
[1:06:30] ER anybody here not the new serpent the
[1:06:33] new serpent is the one that crawled but
[1:06:35] the old serpent the one that was talking
[1:06:38] and standing upright he says that the
[1:06:41] old serpent called the water the devil
[1:06:44] and water
[1:06:45] they're calling this serpent the devil
[1:06:48] and Satan because certain incarnated
[1:06:55] did I lose you
[1:06:56] into the devil into the into the serpent
[1:07:00] now the serpent becomes the devil or
[1:07:03] Satan amen at the beginning he was a
[1:07:07] serpent
[1:07:09] he was just a beast everybody okay but
[1:07:13] when certain incarnate the serpent the
[1:07:16] serpent becomes Satan because the
[1:07:18] serpent as a prophet he is a reflector
[1:07:23] he reflects Satan
[1:07:26] everybody okay
[1:07:28] everybody okay so number one we're
[1:07:31] moving from a devil into a false prophet
[1:07:38] [Music]
[1:07:40] we okay
[1:07:42] I know what I'm saying
[1:07:47] everybody good
[1:07:49] we good
[1:07:50] now he doesn't stop there he's going to
[1:07:53] move again
[1:07:56] verse 6 and when the woman saw
[1:07:59] after the teaching of the serpent
[1:08:02] amen when he saw that the tree was good
[1:08:06] for food and that it was pleasant to the
[1:08:08] eyes and a tree to be desired to make
[1:08:12] one wise she took off the fruit amen
[1:08:16] and did it
[1:08:19] we okay
[1:08:20] now we know that eating
[1:08:22] amen Now The Serpent and Eve are one
[1:08:31] foreign
[1:08:35] and Eve have made another unit
[1:08:39] we okay now now we have not only the
[1:08:42] serpent now he moved toward the immoral
[1:08:46] woman the woman
[1:08:49] so we have a beast
[1:08:52] who have United
[1:08:54] with a woman
[1:09:00] if you read the scripture you will see
[1:09:02] it coming up clear
[1:09:04] if you read the scripture I gave you
[1:09:07] you will see everything clear now
[1:09:09] everybody here
[1:09:10] from a spirit
[1:09:16] from a spirit
[1:09:20] incarnate into a beast
[1:09:22] we okay
[1:09:24] then the Beast combined with the woman
[1:09:27] we okay now we okay now when the beasts
[1:09:31] combine with the woman then she can go
[1:09:34] toward Adam
[1:09:39] it's from here
[1:09:40] if you pay attention and you go to what
[1:09:44] I already preach you can put the seals
[1:09:48] and you will be laughing
[1:09:50] the seals that you listen for I mean two
[1:09:53] years ago and you don't understand
[1:09:54] anything you can go right now and play
[1:09:57] the first seal the second seal that you
[1:09:59] will be dancing you know
[1:10:01] everybody okay
[1:10:03] now she did it
[1:10:06] comma and gave also to her water
[1:10:11] to her husband with her and he did what
[1:10:15] the scripture right here say that they
[1:10:18] gave to Adam and Adam eat how did Eve
[1:10:22] give to Adam
[1:10:24] did Eve just came and say
[1:10:27] Eve thought
[1:10:29] Adam
[1:10:32] everybody okay everybody okay jump to
[1:10:36] verse 11.
[1:10:37] God comes down
[1:10:40] and he said who told you that you were
[1:10:43] naked
[1:10:44] have you eaten off the tree in other
[1:10:46] words who told you who is who who
[1:10:48] revealed to you
[1:10:50] have you eaten off the tree whereof I
[1:10:52] commended you that you should not eat
[1:10:54] watch now we are tracing where it's
[1:10:57] coming from
[1:10:58] and the man say
[1:11:00] the woman
[1:11:02] he didn't say that Satan
[1:11:05] but the woman was already one with the
[1:11:08] Beast Adam didn't say the Beast gave it
[1:11:11] to me he didn't say Satan he's
[1:11:13] identifying the woman
[1:11:15] but he was not really the woman he was
[1:11:18] the serpent but he was not really the
[1:11:20] serpent he was the devil but the devil
[1:11:23] worked through those Avenue
[1:11:27] if you don't know
[1:11:28] you will be stuck at the woman and never
[1:11:31] discovered he was Satan
[1:11:33] everybody okay
[1:11:35] he said the woman whom you give to be
[1:11:38] with me she gave me of the tree
[1:11:42] amen and I did eat and the Lord God said
[1:11:46] to the woman what is this that you have
[1:11:48] done and the woman said the serpent
[1:11:51] began me and I did water everybody okay
[1:11:54] job to verse 17 and to Adam he said
[1:11:57] because you have hearken to the water
[1:12:02] so Eve didn't just give to Adam like
[1:12:05] that
[1:12:06] just like the serpent taught Eve
[1:12:11] everybody care Eve also turned around
[1:12:14] and taught Adam
[1:12:17] we okay so Eve become a prophetess
[1:12:24] I hope you are staying with me and
[1:12:27] you're not distracted
[1:12:30] if now is a prophetess
[1:12:37] everybody here what I'm trying to draw
[1:12:41] here is we're moving from one a spirit
[1:12:47] into number two a false prophet
[1:12:53] you following me
[1:12:55] into number three uh false prophetess
[1:13:05] all of this were in Eden
[1:13:08] that's why I brought Abraham said the
[1:13:10] seven syllables in Eden
[1:13:12] anybody okay so the devil moved from a
[1:13:16] spirit
[1:13:17] but how does he become a false prophet
[1:13:20] by incarnation
[1:13:23] we okay and then by immoral Union with
[1:13:28] the woman the woman becomes the false
[1:13:31] prophet
[1:13:33] the beast at the beginning
[1:13:36] we must go in the end and we must see
[1:13:39] the same pattern repeating
[1:13:43] we okay let's go to Daniel chapter 7.
[1:13:52] I cannot run with this
[1:13:59] Daniel
[1:14:02] chapter seven if you dare you can say
[1:14:05] amen I hope some of you you reviewed
[1:14:07] Daniel 2 and Daniel 3 and Daniel seven I
[1:14:11] didn't tell you to come up with a
[1:14:12] revelation
[1:14:14] just get the background get the
[1:14:16] information that's all and when we
[1:14:18] moving on you just it will come back to
[1:14:21] your memory like acid acid I see it and
[1:14:24] we keep moving amen
[1:14:25] verse two
[1:14:28] Daniel spoke and say I saw my vision in
[1:14:32] my vision by night and behold the Four
[1:14:34] Winds of Heaven you know what it means
[1:14:36] now strove upon the great sea you know
[1:14:39] what it means now remember they came
[1:14:41] from the sea remember s-e-a it's a c
[1:14:45] and the four Great beasts and four great
[1:14:49] beasts came up
[1:14:50] from the sea diverse in other words
[1:14:53] different one from another I'm gonna get
[1:14:55] the first one because you understand the
[1:14:57] other one now
[1:14:59] the first was like a lion and head water
[1:15:04] Eagle wings and I beheld till the wings
[1:15:07] thereof were plucked you understand what
[1:15:10] it means now
[1:15:11] and he was lift up from the Earth
[1:15:16] at the beginning
[1:15:18] you following me
[1:15:20] at the beginning of Daniel chapter 7.
[1:15:26] this first kingdom is a lion
[1:15:32] mixed with ego's wings
[1:15:35] we know that amen
[1:15:37] ego swings that's a lion
[1:15:40] and this is purely Beast
[1:15:47] anybody here
[1:15:49] but when they tell when they took the
[1:15:52] Eagle wings out you're following me
[1:15:55] this lion changed
[1:15:59] everybody here he stood like a man
[1:16:03] up here it was the heart of a beast
[1:16:11] so he can just behave like a beast
[1:16:13] anybody here but right here the
[1:16:16] scripture says that when the plug up
[1:16:19] those wings he was lift up from the
[1:16:22] earth and made stand upon defeat as a
[1:16:25] what as a man and immense water was
[1:16:30] water so he didn't have the man's heart
[1:16:33] to begin with
[1:16:35] he was given to him afterward
[1:16:38] everybody okay so he moved from a simple
[1:16:42] Beast into a human
[1:16:47] we okay we say human heart
[1:16:52] everybody here
[1:16:54] another word this
[1:16:57] spirit
[1:16:59] because it's an anointing
[1:17:01] it's a spirit that is on the country
[1:17:05] amen this anointing this spirit
[1:17:11] move from a spirit and incarnate
[1:17:17] a human
[1:17:21] we okay
[1:17:23] praise God
[1:17:24] and it beats the heart towards give an
[1:17:26] immense heart was given to him when they
[1:17:28] say a man heart was given to him it
[1:17:30] means that now he's a human
[1:17:33] because he didn't have a man's heart
[1:17:35] they gave it to him so he becomes
[1:17:37] somebody
[1:17:38] in other words when you talk to that
[1:17:40] person that person is not really the
[1:17:42] person you're talking to a spirit a
[1:17:45] beast in a human being
[1:17:49] but he looks like you
[1:17:51] everybody okay
[1:17:53] job to verse 17 the Bible says in verse
[1:17:56] 17 this great beasts which are four Are
[1:18:01] For What
[1:18:03] according to verse 17 the Beast are
[1:18:07] Kings
[1:18:10] jump to verse 23
[1:18:13] thus he said the fourth Beast shall be
[1:18:18] the fourth Kingdom
[1:18:20] so in one way it's a king
[1:18:24] in another way it is a kingdom
[1:18:29] everybody here
[1:18:30] and King and kingdom are connected
[1:18:34] you cannot have a king without him
[1:18:36] having a kingdom
[1:18:39] did you hear me you cannot have a
[1:18:41] kingdom without a king king dumb
[1:18:45] King domain
[1:18:48] everybody okay a king with a domain
[1:18:51] Kingdom
[1:18:53] anybody care so it's sometime it will be
[1:18:56] a person
[1:18:59] do you do you follow me sometime he
[1:19:02] won't be a person he will be a kingdom
[1:19:09] let me say it clearly
[1:19:12] sometimes it is a person
[1:19:15] sometimes it is a denomination
[1:19:22] everybody okay
[1:19:26] King is a person
[1:19:31] kingdom is a doorman
[1:19:35] that the person is ruling
[1:19:38] anybody okay you need to know when is he
[1:19:42] the king and when is it a kingdom
[1:19:48] anybody here but just remember if you
[1:19:51] see the kingdom somewhere that King is
[1:19:54] there
[1:19:56] amen did you get it oh if you see that
[1:19:59] King just know that his kingdom is
[1:20:02] around
[1:20:03] do you follow me
[1:20:07] if you see the president of United State
[1:20:10] on 85 be careful there must be secret
[1:20:14] agent all around and they must be police
[1:20:17] officer that are watching him that are

[1:27:15] the message
[1:27:18] you are playing
[1:27:21] everybody okay
[1:27:24] that great city that was clothed in fine
[1:27:27] learning and purple and Scarlet and Deck

[1:27:44] fine learning I mean naturally there is

[1:29:08] Spirit from this place in the name of
[1:29:10] Jesus Christ amen I'm going to remind
[1:29:14] you again the Bible says script brother
[1:29:16] Branham say scripture does not play with
[1:29:19] words whatever is in the record in the
[1:29:23] Bible it's there for the anointed eyes
[1:29:25] to see it's there for her
[1:29:28] never put a scripture like it's there
[1:29:31] it's unnecessary
[1:29:33] it is there for a purpose
[1:29:36] my subject this morning is the four
[1:29:39] phases of roof
[1:29:41] the Incarnation
[1:29:43] and ego's wings
[1:29:48] the incarnations
[1:29:50] and egos wings
[1:29:52] there was an incarnation in the Garden
[1:29:54] of Eden there was in an incarnation in
[1:29:58] the Book of Daniel there is an
[1:30:00] Incarnation that will have to deal with
[1:30:04] the wings of an ego everybody okay
[1:30:06] we are still in the trashing floor still
[1:30:09] dealing with the ten virgin and the
[1:30:11] second oil but we are very very deep
[1:30:14] brother Branham says this
[1:30:17] he says all cults I know why I keep
[1:30:20] rebounding you this
[1:30:22] and uprises and all these things and ISM
[1:30:25] today
[1:30:26] not back in the day today in other words
[1:30:29] everything you see today
[1:30:32] by God's grace every one of them
[1:30:34] everything you see today
[1:30:36] written in Genesis
[1:30:39] where he had its beginning back there he
[1:30:43] just got another
[1:30:47] setting
[1:30:49] is this spirit
[1:30:50] Lucifer is this spirit
[1:30:53] the devil is this Spirit the old serpent
[1:30:57] is still the same spirit
[1:31:00] it just changes name but it's still the
[1:31:04] same devil
[1:31:05] everybody okay brother Branham said but
[1:31:08] you watch the working of the spirit in
[1:31:11] that day go back to Eden see what
[1:31:14] happened and watch it working today and
[1:31:18] you shall see it is the very same thing
[1:31:22] and you will be surprised
[1:31:24] to know that some of these spirit
[1:31:28] are in the highest ecclesiastical
[1:31:32] they are very inside the church
[1:31:37] but you expect them to be in a nightclub
[1:31:44] anybody care I don't go to nightclub
[1:31:48] I don't watch not club stuff but the
[1:31:51] devil can bring a sister here that looks
[1:31:54] just like the woman in the nightclub
[1:31:56] with high heel with tight dresses with
[1:32:00] tight stuff in other words he's bringing
[1:32:02] the the nightclub inside the church
[1:32:07] you need to understand it is not the
[1:32:10] sister but the spirit upon the sister is
[1:32:14] the same spirit that is working in a
[1:32:16] nightclub
[1:32:17] you follow me
[1:32:19] foreign
[1:32:24] language we found out that we have three
[1:32:27] parts and we are very very very very
[1:32:30] very deep into the holiest amen last
[1:32:35] Sunday we added the water we added the
[1:32:39] blood and we added the spirit now we can
[1:32:43] say roof deciding all roof in the water
[1:32:49] our roof under justification or roof in
[1:32:53] a new heart
[1:32:54] it is the same thing it's just got
[1:32:57] another name
[1:33:00] everybody okay everybody okay according
[1:33:03] to the book of roof it's roof serving
[1:33:06] according to the three words of God of
[1:33:09] Grace it is roof under sanctification
[1:33:13] according to Ezekiel it's roof in a new
[1:33:16] spirit according to First John it is
[1:33:19] Ruth under the blood
[1:33:22] everybody okay
[1:33:23] according to roof it's roof resting
[1:33:27] according to the three works of Grace is
[1:33:29] roof under the baptism of the Holy
[1:33:32] Spirit according to Ezekiel its roof
[1:33:35] under my spirit according to First John
[1:33:37] it is Ruth under the spirit
[1:33:40] because these three elements are the one
[1:33:43] somebody is born with you are born with
[1:33:46] the word breaking and then the blood
[1:33:49] comes and then the spirit entered the
[1:33:52] baby that's the new birth right there in
[1:33:55] the Tabernacle everybody okay but you
[1:33:58] can be in the water with other brother
[1:34:00] or you can be in the blood without the
[1:34:03] spirit you must be here then you know
[1:34:06] for sure that you are saved any question
[1:34:11] glory to God
[1:34:13] in our parable of the ten virgin we
[1:34:18] found out that the Midnight Cry
[1:34:20] triggered three things
[1:34:22] which was that the Virgin arose we
[1:34:25] explained to you that justification then
[1:34:27] they trimmed their lamp that was
[1:34:29] sanctification but the main thing was to
[1:34:32] make sure that they have the oil
[1:34:35] anybody care and this oil is not the
[1:34:39] first oil
[1:34:40] the first oil is good but it was a Noel
[1:34:44] for the engagement
[1:34:46] everybody okay you need the second oil
[1:34:49] because the second oil is the oil that
[1:34:53] unites you with the bridegroom it is the
[1:34:56] bridegroom oil
[1:34:57] it is the male anointing
[1:35:02] I will get down to that later on
[1:35:05] everybody here because God is both male
[1:35:09] and female
[1:35:10] I will go down I won't touch it today I
[1:35:14] know if I dig into it you're gonna be
[1:35:16] lost let me leave it alone we coming
[1:35:18] down to that but it is the anointing of
[1:35:21] the bread groom because when they were
[1:35:24] looking for somebody to open the seals
[1:35:26] no one was found worthy
[1:35:29] everybody okay no one was worthy in
[1:35:32] heaven no one was Worthy on the earth no
[1:35:35] one was worthy underneath the Earth the
[1:35:37] only one was worthy was dilemma and the
[1:35:40] lamb is a man
[1:35:43] it is a male it is the bridegroom
[1:35:47] himself
[1:35:49] everybody okay he's the only one that
[1:35:52] can break the seal and when he break the
[1:35:55] seals he releases the Thunders
[1:35:57] and when the pandas are revealing the
[1:36:00] Thunder bring you rapturing faith
[1:36:05] everybody okay
[1:36:07] glory to God brother Branham says this
[1:36:11] if you notice here in verse 10 the Bible
[1:36:14] says that the bridegroom came and they
[1:36:17] that were water what makes them ready
[1:36:21] what makes them ready was not because
[1:36:24] they Rose
[1:36:25] that was part of the process because the
[1:36:27] other Virgin also he rose they all trim
[1:36:30] their lamp but what makes them ready was
[1:36:33] the second oil there was something in
[1:36:36] that second oil that gave you boldness
[1:36:39] to see the king
[1:36:42] come on brother Branham said there is
[1:36:45] there is your five wise virgin who had
[1:36:49] oil in the water that oil is water
[1:36:53] but rapturing faith comes by the pandas
[1:36:56] and the Thunders comes by the breaking
[1:36:59] of the seal and the only one who can
[1:37:01] break the seal is the Lamb it is the
[1:37:04] fair from the male
[1:37:09] that's fine my friend you will get it
[1:37:12] later everybody okay glory be to God
[1:37:15] that's why the Bible says that let us be
[1:37:18] glad
[1:37:20] and do water and give honor to him for
[1:37:23] the water
[1:37:25] stop let me go back again to Matthew the
[1:37:28] bridegroom came and they that were water
[1:37:31] went into water
[1:37:33] let's go back again to 19 for the
[1:37:37] marriage of the water and his wife has
[1:37:40] made herself
[1:37:42] scripture don't play with words
[1:37:48] what makes you ready is the second order
[1:37:52] with that
[1:37:54] the first oil is good
[1:37:59] everybody care but the festival is
[1:38:02] unable to stop death
[1:38:06] Paul died I Rangers died Columbia died
[1:38:11] more than die Martin Luther die even
[1:38:15] brother Branham die but because the
[1:38:17] second oil came there is another people
[1:38:21] that will not die
[1:38:23] [Music]
[1:38:26] everybody okay remember Adam die set die
[1:38:30] everybody die until Enoch that's why
[1:38:34] Enoch had Rapture in faith because Enoch
[1:38:38] have something that can overcome death
[1:38:43] foreign
[1:38:44] [Applause]
[1:38:47] and not only does he stop death but he
[1:38:51] goes back to Power and they walk
[1:38:53] everybody bring the resurrection to
[1:38:56] everybody that was there it's just a
[1:38:59] matter of time when the Rapture time
[1:39:02] comes
[1:39:03] you will see what this oil will be doing
[1:39:07] everybody okay so far glory to God why
[1:39:11] are you taking me my friend
[1:39:13] brother Branham says this
[1:39:16] he said the beast from the beginning he
[1:39:20] was the beast in the Garden of Eden in
[1:39:23] the Garden of Eden we found Satan
[1:39:25] incarnating the Beast then the Beast
[1:39:28] became the first prophet then he goes
[1:39:30] and unite to a woman and the woman
[1:39:32] become a prophetess
[1:39:34] everybody okay but the problem is after
[1:39:37] this God came and destroyed the serpent
[1:39:42] but the system was never destroyed
[1:39:46] Satan must find another Beast
[1:39:50] and another woman that he will be
[1:39:52] working with
[1:39:54] anybody here you can destroy the vessel
[1:39:57] but the spirit continue to move on
[1:40:00] the working of the spirit is still the
[1:40:03] same but remember it will change name
[1:40:07] everybody okay brother Branham say at
[1:40:10] the end it is a water
[1:40:13] it's a king and a water
[1:40:16] and it's a kingdom
[1:40:21] we okay now buckle up because I'm going
[1:40:24] up
[1:40:25] we okay
[1:40:26] if you go to Second Thessalonians
[1:40:29] chapter two
[1:40:30] Paul was already afraid Paul says the
[1:40:33] church started I'm afraid because the
[1:40:36] church is going to fall and we found out
[1:40:38] already that the church fell
[1:40:40] is nothing I already gave you the
[1:40:42] scripture now Paul says it here that now
[1:40:45] I will beseech you Brethren by the
[1:40:48] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by
[1:40:50] our gathering together until I'm talking
[1:40:53] about the coming of the bridegroom and
[1:40:55] we being united with him what are you
[1:40:58] talking about Paul Paul said that he be
[1:41:01] not soon shaken in man
[1:41:03] Paul was preaching that the Lord is
[1:41:05] coming but after a while Paul looked he
[1:41:08] said no no no no no no no no no no no
[1:41:10] he's not coming now church I don't want
[1:41:13] anybody to trouble you like the Lord
[1:41:15] have come he won't come now
[1:41:18] everybody okay he said I don't want you
[1:41:20] to be shaken in man or be trouble
[1:41:22] neither by Spirit nor by word no but let
[1:41:27] the ass from us as the day of who
[1:41:30] the coming of the Lord is what let no
[1:41:34] man deceive you by any mean why for that
[1:41:38] day
[1:41:39] foreign
[1:41:42] coming the coming of Jesus Christ that
[1:41:46] day Paul said that it shall not come
[1:41:52] except they come a water
[1:41:55] so before Jesus Come A Falling Away must
[1:41:59] happen
[1:42:00] [Applause]
[1:42:08] before the coming of the Lord comes
[1:42:10] number one we must see a falling away
[1:42:15] somebody must Fall Away
[1:42:20] we okay
[1:42:21] we talk about that falling away to the
[1:42:24] denomination we find what's happening
[1:42:25] now
[1:42:27] everybody here somebody must go away
[1:42:31] they're falling away except they shall
[1:42:34] come falling away first number one
[1:42:37] comma not only a falling away and that
[1:42:41] the man of sin be water
[1:42:46] two things must happen there must be a
[1:42:49] falling away first and after the falling
[1:42:53] away we must have the revelation
[1:42:58] of the man of sin
[1:43:01] amen the pure language here Paul is
[1:43:05] telling you that Jesus will not come
[1:43:09] if the somebody the church have not
[1:43:13] Fallen yet
[1:43:16] you following me
[1:43:18] you're following me but after the
[1:43:21] falling of the church God will break the
[1:43:24] seals
[1:43:26] you follow me and reveal Satan
[1:43:31] amen so when you see Satan being
[1:43:34] revealed just know now that the
[1:43:37] bridegroom is ready to come
[1:43:41] do you understand
[1:43:45] he says this the son of water
[1:43:49] Judah was already dead
[1:43:52] Judah was the son of perdition right but
[1:43:55] Judah was already dead this is Paul so
[1:43:57] there is another Son of Perdition
[1:44:01] this man of sin is the son of perdition
[1:44:05] but we know that Judah already died and
[1:44:08] the Bible said Judah was the son of
[1:44:10] perdition
[1:44:11] so whoever was in Judah
[1:44:15] everybody okay will do what again he
[1:44:18] will come back again
[1:44:20] just like the spirit that was in Jesus
[1:44:23] came back to the church on the day of
[1:44:27] Pentecost the spirit that was in Judah
[1:44:30] must also come back again into the
[1:44:33] church
[1:44:36] we okay
[1:44:40] let me continue
[1:44:41] verse 8 and then shall die water
[1:44:45] that person is not only a man of sin the
[1:44:48] terminology is changing it's the same
[1:44:51] person he's a man of sin he is the Son
[1:44:54] of Perdition he is a wicked one remember
[1:44:57] Cain the son of the
[1:45:00] which was the son of the devil so if the
[1:45:04] son of the wicked one was the devil so
[1:45:06] who is the wicked one
[1:45:08] and who is the man of sin
[1:45:10] and who's the son of perdition do we
[1:45:13] must have fall the devil before Jesus
[1:45:15] come
[1:45:16] [Applause]
[1:45:17] but here so Paul is saying before Jesus
[1:45:21] Christ come the devil will do something
[1:45:23] in the church
[1:45:25] but here but God will not let him be
[1:45:28] hidden and continue to destroy the
[1:45:30] church God will finally open the whole
[1:45:34] thing out and call his children and say
[1:45:37] come this is the man that was doing this
[1:45:40] all along this is him right here
[1:45:43] everybody okay
[1:45:45] glory to God
[1:45:48] it's getting juicy my friend
[1:45:50] everybody okay Dave saw and that Wicked
[1:45:54] one will be water
[1:45:55] to reveal unfold so the seals must be
[1:46:00] broken
[1:46:02] reveal whom the Lord shall consume
[1:46:06] with water
[1:46:08] of water
[1:46:09] stop
[1:46:11] does your mouth have a spirit
[1:46:13] [Music]
[1:46:18] I'm asking you a question
[1:46:20] So when you say Jesus that's a spirit
[1:46:23] that's Jehovah Witness
[1:46:28] everybody here how can you destroy
[1:46:30] something with the spirit of your mouth
[1:46:32] so your spirit is in your mouth
[1:46:35] you need a prophet what does it mean the
[1:46:40] spirit in the mouth
[1:46:43] oh thank you
[1:46:45] okay glory to God the Bible says this
[1:46:50] brother Robin that in Revelation 19 that
[1:46:54] out of the mouth of Jesus God's water
[1:46:57] [Applause]
[1:46:58] [Music]
[1:47:01] we okay
[1:47:03] out of the mouth of Jesus Christ what
[1:47:05] comes out of it
[1:47:07] a sharp it goes a sharp sword that we
[1:47:11] fit with the sword he should water
[1:47:14] so it's a sword that will destroy you
[1:47:18] and Paul is saying that the wicked one
[1:47:20] will be destroyed by the spirit of the
[1:47:23] mouth of God but out of the mouth of God
[1:47:26] we don't see the spirit but we see the
[1:47:30] sword
[1:47:31] so brother Stephen do you mean the sword
[1:47:33] means the Spirit hold on your break
[1:47:36] let's go back to the Bible
[1:47:37] the Bible says this in Ephesians 6
[1:47:40] brother Robert 17 and take the water
[1:47:45] and the water
[1:47:46] of the water
[1:47:48] the sword of the water
[1:47:50] so the spirit have a sword so when they
[1:47:54] say Jesus Christ will destroy with the
[1:47:56] spirit of his mouth it is the sword in
[1:48:00] his mouth and the sword which is the
[1:48:03] water
[1:48:04] [Applause]
[1:48:07] everybody okay everybody okay so now
[1:48:10] let's go back to our scripture again
[1:48:12] glory to God so that Wicked
[1:48:15] be revealed whom the Lord shall consume
[1:48:18] with water
[1:48:20] with the sword
[1:48:23] everybody here and remember in Sabino
[1:48:25] Canyon the sword came down
[1:48:29] [Music]
[1:48:30] [Applause]
[1:48:32] everybody here remember the vision of
[1:48:34] Junior Jackson The Sword came down so we
[1:48:38] have what can destroy the Antichrist
[1:48:41] everybody here everybody here but before
[1:48:45] you destroy him you must identify him
[1:48:48] you must unfail him and see where he is
[1:48:52] and now you pull the sword and you begin
[1:48:55] to chop him
[1:48:58] everybody okay

[1:50:03] anybody here we got we we found Daniel 2
[1:50:06] and Daniel 7.
[1:50:09] Daniel 2 was dealing with the natural
[1:50:11] Kingdom
[1:50:13] which is the which are the political
[1:50:16] Kingdom amen that's that was Daniel 2
[1:50:19] Daniel 7 was dealing with the spiritual

[1:50:47] is blowing wind
[1:50:50] because he's approaching Ukraine
[1:50:54] everybody okay
[1:50:55] everybody okay that's a prophetic
[1:50:57] language
[1:51:01] everybody okay so according to the
[1:51:03] spiritual here everything was clear we
[1:51:06] moved from a girl to Silver to Brass to
[1:51:09] iron iron with Clay everything clear but
[1:51:12] on the spiritual the last one was not
[1:51:15] clear we went to the Book of John and
[1:51:17] John unfolded to us and when John
[1:51:20] unfolded to us it was just a mixture of
[1:51:23] number one plus number two all of them
[1:51:26] he give you number four number one plus
[1:51:29] number two plus number three equal
[1:51:31] number four in other words the strength
[1:51:34] of a lion
[1:51:36] [Music]
[1:51:39] and the strength of the bear and the
[1:51:43] strength of the leopard all this
[1:51:45] strength pulled up together

[1:52:36] other country did not exist
[1:52:41] you're following me other country
[1:52:44] existed but remember last Sunday we
[1:52:48] found out that God taught every country
[1:52:51] that you must be under Nebuchadnezzar
[1:52:56] but here in other words this kingdom are
[1:53:00] the power dominating the entire world
[1:53:04] even though you might have your country
[1:53:07] maybe from Africa maybe from Europe

[2:05:01] given to me and Jesus never contradicted

[2:09:05] a water
[2:09:06] [Applause]
[2:09:12] everybody okay what are you trying to
[2:09:14] say brother Stephen ever Every Nation
[2:09:17] here is a pagan Nation
[2:09:22] Pagan Nation Gentile none of them
[2:09:26] begging all of them and all of them
[2:09:28] controlled by Satan
[2:09:33] the Babylonian was destroyed the middle
[2:09:35] pigeon was destroyed the Greek Empire
[2:09:38] was destroyed the Roman Empire was
[2:09:41] destroyed but if you watch in the Roman
[2:09:44] place there is two categories
[2:09:47] [Music]
[2:09:51] yes
[2:09:55] what are you saying
[2:09:57] the first kingdom was pure gold
[2:10:02] no mixing
[2:10:04] the second kingdom was pure silver
[2:10:07] no mixing the third was pure brass
[2:10:11] no mixing the fourth one here pure iron
[2:10:16] but when they get here
[2:10:20] [Applause]
[2:10:24] [Music]
[2:10:25] what I'm trying to say is the fourth
[2:10:29] Kingdom have two phases
[2:10:35] [Music]
[2:10:36] everybody here he have a faces that it's
[2:10:41] completely pagan
[2:10:44] it's completely Gentile
[2:10:46] just like the Babylonian the middle
[2:10:49] pigeon and the Greek Empire but this
[2:10:52] Kingdom sleeps
[2:10:58] this Pagan kingdom is pure iron
[2:11:02] just like everything was pure gold pure
[2:11:06] silver pure breath pure iron but at the
[2:11:10] feet
[2:11:13] it is a mixture of iron
[2:11:18] and clay
[2:11:20] so this Kingdom at the beginning will
[2:11:24] look Pagan and after a while it will
[2:11:27] flip
[2:11:28] foreign
[2:11:34] what are you talking about brother
[2:11:36] Stephen brother Branham says this he

[2:12:49] and we got ten horns
[2:12:52] where are we going brother Stephen
[2:12:55] glory to God
[2:12:56] Prada pranam says that the 10th Kingdom

[2:13:02] speaking of this morning each one of
[2:13:04] those ten kingdoms that was to water
[2:13:08] everybody okay
[2:13:10] remember in the image
[2:13:12] it is gentles
[2:13:15] okay that is in the natural but in the
[2:13:19] spiritual we found a beast that is like
[2:13:22] a leopard like a bird about I mean a
[2:13:25] bear and then like a lion but he have
[2:13:27] ten horns you gotta know that it is the
[2:13:30] same Spirit it is just changing form in
[2:13:34] the image it is tentos in the animal

[2:13:41] one
[2:13:42] do you follow me do you follow me We Are
[2:13:45] Chasing the Devil
[2:13:47] everybody okay he says they were iron
[2:13:50] and water mixed together and that iron
[2:13:54] comes from the leg which was water there
[2:13:57] is a streak of romanism mixed in water
[2:14:01] remember every nation
[2:14:04] unless you are in the book of the lamb
[2:14:06] every nation you have a power amen Every
[2:14:10] Nation there is and the water through
[2:14:13] the water
[2:14:14] [Applause]
[2:14:18] let's go slowly
[2:14:20] Catholic Church is not a pagan
[2:14:26] it is a religious
[2:14:28] [Music]
[2:14:32] everybody here so the last Kingdom flips
[2:14:36] from a pure Pagan into a religion
[2:14:43] when it's pure Pagan it is iron
[2:14:47] and when we're speaking about Rome as a
[2:14:51] kingdom today we are calling that Italy
[2:14:57] going slowly the country Rome today is
[2:15:01] Italy let me ask you a question does
[2:15:04] Italy dominate the world
[2:15:07] does Italy have the strength to fight
[2:15:09] America
[2:15:10] does Italy have the strength to fight
[2:15:13] even in Germany
[2:15:14] but how is Italy dominating the world it
[2:15:18] is not Italy
[2:15:19] the Kingdom of Italy was destroyed
[2:15:22] already
[2:15:23] the Beast is no longer in Italy he
[2:15:27] controlled the world but it's not Italy
[2:15:29] you need to find him in a religious
[2:15:32] world
[2:15:34] but in Rome
[2:15:40] do you follow me do you follow me
[2:15:43] do you follow me if you go by rum
[2:15:46] they say Greek the Greek nation is today
[2:15:49] do you see Greek dominating anybody it
[2:15:52] doesn't dominate anybody if you go to
[2:15:55] the Iranian and thinks you will see the
[2:15:57] Babylonian do you see Iran dominating
[2:15:59] the world it is not the irony anymore
[2:16:02] Italy doesn't dominate the world but
[2:16:04] there is something that dominate the
[2:16:05] world America is dominating the world
[2:16:09] where is America in the scripture
[2:16:15] you see now Russia is dominating where
[2:16:18] is Russia in the Bible
[2:16:22] we okay now we okay now so the last
[2:16:26] Kingdom flips from a pagan
[2:16:29] to a religion
[2:16:34] we okay
[2:16:35] according to the image of Daniel
[2:16:38] everybody okay according to the image of
[2:16:41] Daniel we okay
[2:16:43] this change from Iron pure to mix of
[2:16:47] iron of clay is a flipping of the Roman
[2:16:52] Empire from Rome Pagan to Rome Papa this
[2:16:57] is according to the image but if you go
[2:17:00] here it is also expressed another way it
[2:17:04] is not expressed by Iron and Clay over
[2:17:07] there remember here we have ten tools
[2:17:09] but here the toes are called there on so
[2:17:13] here it is a flipping there is a flip
[2:17:16] here so what is the flipping in this
[2:17:18] animal
[2:17:20] glory to God brother Branham says this
[2:17:23] everybody okay he says this he says the
[2:17:27] head of gold was Nebuchadnezzar then
[2:17:30] Darius the middle Persian taking the
[2:17:32] gentle Kingdom over then the middle
[2:17:34] prison was what the Greek Alexander the
[2:17:36] Great and so forth they greet him the
[2:17:39] Grecian Kingdom over then what took it
[2:17:41] over from the Greek duh
[2:17:43] and who had ruled their work the gentle
[2:17:46] word ever since Roman Roman that was
[2:17:50] water
[2:17:51] that's Pagan Rome
[2:17:53] we okay then notice Rome exists to the
[2:17:57] end but if we look today Italy is not
[2:18:00] strong even in Europe it's a small
[2:18:02] country
[2:18:03] the country of Italy is not dominating
[2:18:05] the world but according to the Bible
[2:18:08] Rome will dominate the world but Italy
[2:18:11] the country doesn't dominate the world
[2:18:13] so when is that Rome that dominated the
[2:18:15] country the world
[2:18:18] the Bible says this that it exists
[2:18:21] because he went to the end of what
[2:18:24] and we sin mad clay that is what
[2:18:28] what we are made out of and iron the
[2:18:31] strength of water run in every one of
[2:18:34] those Nations Rome has a strength in
[2:18:37] every nation underwater
[2:18:41] let me continue where we started
[2:18:44] according to Revelation 13 the Bible say
[2:18:47] this Beast
[2:18:49] this Beast right here this one says he
[2:18:52] moved from here to the toes it is Pagan
[2:18:55] to religion here what is the code 10
[2:19:00] toes ten horns everybody okay brother
[2:19:03] Branham say the Bible says I saw one of
[2:19:05] his head as he was water
[2:19:09] and his deadly wound was water and the
[2:19:12] whole world did water
[2:19:14] [Applause]
[2:19:17] so when you go in the natural side you
[2:19:20] look at the Kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar
[2:19:22] when you look you see Iron flipping to
[2:19:26] iron and clay that is politically
[2:19:28] speaking
[2:19:30] when you change you go spiritually you
[2:19:33] look you see ten horns here 10 toes
[2:19:37] brother Branham say it is the same thing
[2:19:39] it just changed the name we okay watch
[2:19:43] The Working of the spirit you will see
[2:19:45] it's the same thing but what about the
[2:19:47] flipping
[2:19:48] about the flipping in the animal we
[2:19:51] found that one of the head of the animal
[2:19:54] was completely killed
[2:19:57] everybody here but for some reason that
[2:20:01] animal that was completely dead
[2:20:06] and the animal continues
[2:20:10] what is the flipping in the image in the
[2:20:15] Beast it is the wound and the healing of
[2:20:18] the wound
[2:20:22] if I don't do this you can read brother
[2:20:25] Branham and you don't understand
[2:20:28] what is going on now brother Branham say
[2:20:31] Satan and his satanic religion are in
[2:20:35] both of these beasts
[2:20:37] the beach that was wounded unto death
[2:20:40] but live again is Imperial Pagan room
[2:20:48] you understand it is the same language
[2:20:51] it's just using different symbols
[2:20:54] Nebuchadnezzar when he sees he sees the
[2:20:57] iron and the toes with iron and Clay
[2:21:00] Daniel when he sees he see a wound
[2:21:03] and the wound heal the wound is the
[2:21:06] destruction of Roman Pagan but when he
[2:21:11] revived again and he continued to leave
[2:21:13] he's no more Pagan anymore he's now a
[2:21:17] religion
[2:21:18] everybody okay
[2:21:20] he says it is an imperial Pagan room
[2:21:23] that fell to the onslaught of the
[2:21:25] Barbarian and death and thereby lost
[2:21:28] their power her temporal power but she
[2:21:31] regained it into water
[2:21:34] do you see it the nation that ruled by
[2:21:36] crushing and which became the strongest
[2:21:39] empire ever know was finally wounded to
[2:21:42] death they destroy Rome her power was
[2:21:44] gone physically as a control of the
[2:21:48] that's why Italy cannot control the
[2:21:51] world with his army but here physically
[2:21:54] but I'm the Constantine she came back to
[2:21:59] for pepper Rome has water
[2:22:02] the water
[2:22:03] and has power her power is water
[2:22:08] so what you need to trust now is not the
[2:22:11] country of Italy because the Beast
[2:22:13] already flipped you need to go with his
[2:22:16] flipping
[2:22:18] anybody here because if you don't if you
[2:22:21] don't if you chase the serpent you find
[2:22:24] that he's in a woman
[2:22:27] you need to know how you're chasing him
[2:22:29] back
[2:22:30] for you to catch him when he finished
[2:22:33] with the serpent he left the serpent God
[2:22:35] destroyed the serpent but Satan is free
[2:22:38] if you keep going to the serpent the
[2:22:41] serpent has nothing anymore
[2:22:42] he already changed
[2:22:45] he's no longer in the snake he's now in

[2:29:19] in the Book of Revelation 11 that when
[2:29:22] the seven Angel sanded the seventh

[2:30:10] is to Israel the same as the
[2:30:14] words to water
[2:30:16] what we call the seventh seal that

[2:32:18] Judah
[2:32:20] everybody okay
[2:32:22] you there
[2:32:23] and when Moses and Elijah they have done
[2:32:27] what
[2:32:29] they could not be killed
[2:32:33] until they finish their mission
[2:32:38] keep that in mind okay
[2:32:41] after they finish their testimony they
[2:32:44] what
[2:32:46] so there is a beast
[2:32:48] we okay the Beast that ascended out of
[2:32:52] the water
[2:32:54] so there is a beast in the end time
[2:32:57] that is coming from bottomless pit it's
[2:33:00] a pit that has a heavy bottom so when
[2:33:03] you fall you keep falling falling
[2:33:05] falling falling without a stop let me
[2:33:08] leave that one alone you will see that
[2:33:09] later
[2:33:11] the beasts that come out of the
[2:33:13] bottomless feet shall make war with them
[2:33:16] and shall overcome them and do what he
[2:33:20] will kill them because their mission is
[2:33:22] finished
[2:33:25] everybody okay
[2:33:26] verse 8 and the dead body shall lay in
[2:33:30] the street of the great city which

[2:33:53] whoever will stay in the tribulation and
[2:33:56] shall not permit the bad body to be put
[2:33:59] in the grave and they that dwell upon
[2:34:02] the Earth shall rejoice over them and
[2:34:05] make Mary and shall send what
[2:34:08] one to water
[2:34:10] because these two Prophet tormented them
[2:34:14] that dwell on the water so when they
[2:34:17] killed the two Prophet they begin to
[2:34:19] send gift one to another
[2:34:22] continue with your Christmas
[2:34:24] [Music]

[2:34:32] the tribulation period
[2:34:37] everybody okay now brother Branham says
[2:34:41] this he says the church
[2:34:44] the remnant of the Jews when they
[2:34:47] finally killed these two prophets and
[2:34:49] they lay in the streets spiritually
[2:34:51] called Sodom in Egypt where our Lord was
[2:34:53] crucified they sent gift one to another
[2:34:56] the world to us look back into the Roman
[2:35:00] history and you shall find out there is
[2:35:02] only one nation in the in all the world
[2:35:05] that ever send gift after the battle
[2:35:08] that is the
[2:35:12] yeah
[2:35:14] can I continue every time that the Roman
[2:35:18] the old Pagan Roman used to have a
[2:35:21] victory they would send a
[2:35:29] go to the Book of Revelation
[2:35:32] when he died of a cometh the Bible said
[2:35:35] I will give him a water
[2:35:45] it's just another name it's the same
[2:35:47] devil can I continue can I continue he
[2:35:51] said they will stand the white son and
[2:35:54] everything to one another as a gift like
[2:35:56] that as a water
[2:35:57] what lead a gift sent between the Roman
[2:36:00] Church

[2:36:32] Moses and Elijah

[2:36:45] are you going to restore the kingdom
[2:36:46] back to Israel he said no no no it's not
[2:36:49] up to you to know the
