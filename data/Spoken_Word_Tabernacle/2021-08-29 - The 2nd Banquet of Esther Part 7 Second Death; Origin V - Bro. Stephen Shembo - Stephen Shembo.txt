just keep him in your prayers but the testimony is as pastor has been stating you know we pray keep a hedge of protection around our children around our families kova can't touch us well the lord put on my heart sunday last sunday to have the ministers or ask him to pray over him unbeknownst to me and him everyone on the job site in kentucky had covet so they shipped him and another crew out there because the other crew was quarantined he gets out there he calls me babe everybody has coven he said but i said don't worry about it the lord sent you they prayed over you don't worry about it he called me yesterday he says baby said one of the guys that came here with me tested positive for covet they've given everybody now a covet test he called me back like four or five hours later he said

offering amen amen amen what is singing thank you very much three of them but they can sing like heaven blessed be the name of the lord god richly bless you this morning we greet you all in the name of jesus christ we don't have visitors here we got family members so all the family members god richly bless you and i got a veteran there so i got to salute my veteran brother garcia god richly bless you you should be here preaching and me sitting amen but we appreciate you and the family and we still have brother jeff behind there god richly bless you for yielding on wednesday amen everybody happy everybody on board anybody behind everybody on page with the sermon if you're behind that's your problem anybody behind them okay blessed be the name of the lord our origin amen i told you i'm going to preach on predestination so that's predestination right there if not you won't understand the lake of fire let's go straight to our scripture in psalm chapter 69 brother david just a little bit so i can blast to that devil amen you got trained you got me trained on the bazooka amen psalm 69 if you're there you can say amen a few pages turning when i give you scripture it's not for you to look at them today and forget about him amen you need to be grounded in the word of god amen when i give scripture when we're going through a series you make sure you go home and put those scriptures for yourself so if anything happen in the future you have a reference you can defend your faith yourself not the pastor say the bible say the bible say brother branham say the bible say what brother say if you don't create a habit of sitting down and writing your scripture before you know it after three four months you will be looking for that scripture and you say but stephen when did you preach so-and-so and it's maybe part 43 part 46 and i have to search all over together so make sure especially the young people sit down and say we went through uh earrings this is a scripture about hearing we went through makeup this is the scripture about makeup we went through this and you put it together we went through uh how young how a young man should behave you put it together so you put it for yourself because if the lord terry you're gonna have a family you need to teach it to your children it was not moses responsibility to go to the houses of the people and begin to teach them you did it you need to do it for yourself so when you talk to somebody a co-worker or someone at work or auntie or uncle or grandpa you can sit down and say grandpa open your bible look here look here look here look here before you know it where do you pray how do you know all of this and you say god send us ah [Music] that's it amen because the message is perfectly in line with the scripture everybody clear even though it looks like you didn't see it today just chill out you're going to see it right here amen you saw it multiple times here psalm chapter 69 verse 22 let their table become a snare in other words they're trapped what a prayer david he's praying for somebody they're terrible to become a trump to them my god let their table become a snare before them and that which should have been for their welfare let it become a trap why are you praying like this david you might be seated we should be praying for our enemies we should be praying that the lord need to save them amen father save them bring them to the kingdom but for some reason david is not praying like that david is praying for judgment is it okay brother david the bazooka okay you want me switch right that's it he's in trouble again so just bear with us until they get disadjusted pretty good amen that sounds pretty good amen now i'm home praise be the name of the lord hallelujah but david calls it not me so he said let their eyes be darkened david what's wrong not you david david in the bible amen let their eyes be darkened that they see not i thought you should pray for somebody so that the lord can enlighten them so that they can see but this can't this category david say blind them amen you need to know the scripture let their eyes be darkened that they see not and make their lawns continually to shake david 24 pour out your indignation in other words your wrath upon them and let your wrathful anger take hold of them why you should pray for your enemy amen let their habitation be desolate and let none dwell in their tents why 26 4 they persecute him whom you have smitten because remember christ was smitten of god it's in the book of isaiah they persecuted him whom you have smitten and they talked to the grief of those whom you have wounded they begin to criticize them they didn't know what god was doing amen david continued he said add iniquity to their iniquity they knew better add it double it what kind of prayer and let them not come in your righteousness remember the psalm our prophecy so he's prophesying for somebody and if he's prophesying men of old spoke when they were moved by her so who's actually bringing that [Music] the holy spirit not really david it is the anointing of god upon david add iniquity to their iniquity they knew better add it and let them not to uh let them not come into righteousness in other words don't give them the way to be saved 28 let them be water out of the book of the water so these people were in the book of life so in other words the book of life everybody clear have a mix a mixture of seed amen remember there was one field in matthew 3rd uh in matthew 13 god wanted the son of man and saw his seed but the enemy also came and put it together so we found out that in the camp of god now there is a mixture remember where we are in the mix what multitude not outside inside israel not all israelia is remember last sunday so not everybody does in the that is in the book of life is the child of god even though they're in the book of life except in the section called the lamb's book of life over there that's a different story but we're gonna get there if you look you can understand that we are traveling the book of life because the book of life really didn't start here it started way back in eternity amen let them be bloated out of the book of the living and not be written with the water so in the story of the book of life the story of the book of life ever clear the book of life that story contain the just and and the unjust anybody clear so when you read that book you must say and moses everybody here but that book cannot stop at moses he have to bring you balaam make sense if you say moses that book automatically have to bring quora you okay make sense make sense but truly when this book was written he was written almost like he have blank space are we okay in other words when god have to say he's gonna be like and moses did this this this blank space this this then joshua then this this this and those blank space had to be filled are we okay are we okay and anybody that was filled on the blank space can be erased we're good let them be blooded out of the book of the living and not be written with the righteous so the righteous in their book it's not only about the righteous it is the righteous and those that are not righteous they are there that's the one david is saying let the wrath of god be upon them turn them blind let not see the way of life i want you to remove them completely block them completely out why does david want to remove them from the book of life instead of being being saved let's go to matthew 13. remember the vessels of wrath and the vessels of water mercy we already got the vessels of mercy now we're dropping down deep amen hallelujah this is the message of the hour if you dare you can say amen few people okay i'm looking at you amen blaze said be the name of the lord who has ears to hear let him do water who doesn't have ear in this place everybody heaven so how can god say whom they have ears because when you created except if something is wrong maybe with the genetics or something in the pregnancy then you can end up not being having maybe these things right here everybody here but normally as a normal human being when you are born automatically you have an ear everybody has it but how can god say let him die have a mirror that ear is not this one everybody have this one but they don't have the other ear amen if you don't have that ear when god say sit down you will understand sit down but somebody else understands stand up who has ears to hear let him hear and the disciple came and said to him why speak you to them in what why are you speaking them in coding why are you joking why are you not just playing just say i'm hungry you just have to say uh i feel a little bit tired and everybody will hear i feel a little bit tired and you'll see the bride rising up and begin to prepare the meal she understood something that you didn't you were sitting right there you heard it but the wife understood that my husband is hungry if you ask her what did you hear i feel a little bit tired what did you hear i feel a little bit tired but her earring put her into a different behavior yet both of you heard and you see somebody sitting and trying to figure it out what did he really mean you need to have that ear he answered verse 11 and say to them because it is given to you know the water no no no no no don't preach mysteries motivational speakers because it is given to you to know what the mysteries are the hidden truth of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not water so it doesn't belong to them that's why it must be put in symbols it must be coded anybody clear for whosoever has to him shall be given so you must have something you must have that love of the truth remember second thessalonians amen and he that have more and and he shall have more abundance but whosoever has what so there are certain people that does that they don't have anything that's why brother branham say in non-seed there is nothing to quicken amen they are giving to the one who already have something amen because the top of the china laundry man amen they have to tear the pepper in two one stay up there and you drop down with one if you have a portion of the pepper then they can give you something but if they check you there is no portion watch what happened and but whosoever has not from him shall be water taken away even water so he has something make sense now he has something in the book of life but because he has not they have to even remove him from the book of life to remain there it doesn't mean that you just have to be there you must be there and you must also have something in you you must have a book within a book amen hallelujah verse 13 therefore speak eye to them in water because there is no decoder in them amen because they sing they don't see so what does he mean by seeing i see this board but do you really see that c means something else it means to understand make sense they're seeing amen because they're seeing see not and hearing two words they hear not neither do they water there's no understanding they can hear the message they can see what you're talking about but they still can grasp it amen can get them amen verse 14 and in them not everybody is fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah which says by hearing you shall heal naturally and shall not understand why can isaiah pray something like that for someone saying give them an opportunity to hear but not to decode them hallelujah and shall not understand and seeing you shall see and shall not water there is a perception amen watch verse 15 for these people's heart so those things the seeing and the hearing is not really connected to the five senses [Music] that healing have nothing to do with this does seeing have nothing to do with this both the hearing and the seeing have something to do with their heart their heart must see and their heart must understand make sense how do you understand with your heart how do you see with your heart when somebody talk to you say oh i see that's not here that is here because you were looking at the person you didn't see before but after a while you say oh i see what he was talking about actually what happened is your heart actually decoded makes sense for these people's heart is what's gross though and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have their clothes they didn't do this if not they're gonna stumble even to the daylight amen at any less at any time they should do what they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and shoot water understand with the water you see that am i reading a different bible understand with their heart and should be what so to be converted you must hear with your heart and you must see with your heart if it doesn't jump in the heart and it stays in your brain you can never be born again make sense now he says that it should understand with their heart and should be converted and i shall do what in other words there is a process in the heart once their heart is decoding the language of god god is under obligation to hear that person make sense so god have to block that process why verse 16 but blessed are your eyes you see the difference for the sea and your ears for they do what so somebody is blessed and somebody is cursed [Music] to help you up i'm going to pull the same thing from mark mark say he said unto them unto you it is given to know the water of the water of the kingdom of god but unto them that are water that are not within they are not part of me amen they are outsider all these things are done in what in parable that seeing the mercy and not perceive and hearing they may hear another less at any time there should be and the sin should be water so god broke it so that he cannot forgive them make sense in matthew it says healing them in mark it is really based on forgiveness so not everybody can be forgiven let's go to revelation chapter nine yep now you grown up you're gonna eat meat [Laughter] i can't be giving 40 years old bored of me amen 40 years old coming back from work and say hey honey where is my bottle of milk something is wrong something is wrong you need a hamburger amen you need grown-up food [Music] amen because the more they give you milk milk milk actually you are getting lazy flair [Music] you don't have enough strength to fight the devil because it's milk but you give it to the children they start jumping because the energy came up not old people you need fufu let's go to revelation 9. that was his sense of humor somebody said what is that it looked like mashed potato let's go revelation 9 amen that's why paul say let's lay aside the principle let's move on to what not laying again the foundation even though we will do that turning around turning around moses say enough you have turned around this mountain a long time let's go what not for it too much staying here lord lord lord forgiveness lord lord lord forgive the jump today i'm sorry i'm still struggling dumb today hey hey come on grown up put your big people paints tell the devil i am grown up tell the devil i am grown up don't come to me with this pornography this is staying at home not going to church i don't have to deal with these small devils how can you be 20 years struggling about the same thing and you happy i'm struggling it's christian life no you gotta pass that test revelation 9 verse 20 you there and the rest of the men which were not killed by the by these plagues the plagues are already explaining to you we went with the seven angels and the plague the pledge is like a whooping that god brings and whoop somebody if you're his child it's to bring you back to normal if you're not his child is to take you somewhere anybody clear but these people received the plague but the plague did not kill them so normally when they whoop him automatically as a child you got to correct yourself but let's see if these are going to be corrected and the rest of the men which were not killed by this plague yet repented not brother continue your life if you're waiting for everybody that bid you wrong to come and apologize to you some will not come you're gonna wait for years the lord struck them you say i had to gather now i'm expecting them tomorrow they're gonna say i'm sorry for the way we treated you so keep going on your highway don't be distracted with everybody because you don't know which seat they have yet repented not of the works of their hand that they should not worship devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and of wood neither can see nor hear nor walk neither repent a day of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their fornication nor of the water so no matter how much god can whoop them they're not going to change amen there was two fifa the cross one being guilty dying at the cross but regardless of the circumstances he was there he's still mocking jesus christ how can you be guilty and keep doing wrong even before you die he's still doing wrong and the other one stop and push a break and say wait a minute we are guilty not this man then jesus turned around and said okay i remember before you were the one that was holding this plan here so go ahead and check in and let's go amen go to revelation 15 and then we're going to pray [Music] you see why david said let's the table you see why they're no good they're there to perfect your character [Music] are you there but don't be wasting your time to be waiting for them [Music] and you holding their grudges let it go you don't know who they are amen 15 1. and i saw another angel another son in heaven i'm sorry great and marvelous seven angels having the seven last plagues for in them is fill up the water job to verse seven and one of the four beasts you know him now you remember when they say one of the four beasts it means who you need to go review it means a lion one of the four beasts gave to the seven angels seven golden vowels full of what the wrath of god who live forever and and ever everybody clear job to let me read this and then we're going to pray go to verse chapter 16 job to verse 10. it's important so when we get to the angelic realm you're going to understand and the fifth angel poured out his vow upon the seat of the beast and his kingdom was full of darkness and then now there are tongues for pain indeed water can you imagine they're getting whooped but they're still cursing and blaspheme who the god of heaven because of their parents and their soul and repented not of their normally when something is tracking a child it's like father i'm sorry i won't do it again i'm sorry i'm sorry but these you whoop and they cast you whoop the casting you hope the blasphemer that's why david said you know what turn them down go to the book of life remove them jesus said you can't give them the mysteries because they can't get it amen there is nothing in them that can get it the bible say godly sorrow bring what it will bring you unto repentance regardless of what god will do they will not repent let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you for helping us even to be able to read your scripture but this is as far as a man can go lord may you come and move me completely assad away from this pulpit but may you come and speak to your children and may you be the one speaking and the one hearing lord because no one can hear what the spirit says says the holy spirit himself decoding your own language to your children lord made the devil kovid 19 whatever it is delta or whichever sickness is on the ground father may it be completely out of this place and not of your children if somebody for by uh adventure was exposed to it and maybe unconscious not knowing or went to walmart and father shook hand with somebody not knowing it father may you touch them and heal them we thank you for protecting our brother hamilton lord father you did it for him you can do it for every single person that is here this morning because you're the one that can vaccinate it better than any human being that's why we ask it in the name of jesus christ and rebuke every demonic spirit away from this place lord in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you we are continuing we are on origin part five amen we were talking about the subject of the second death everybody clear we talked about the first death the mystery of the resurrection uh the the mystery of death and the resurrection and the souls of the just and everything you already understand this thing we're on the second death but to understand the second death we say we have to go through the origin because the second death according to bro to the scripture the bible says that death and hell which is something bad were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death so the second death is the lake of fire and the bible say in revelation 21 verse 8 that but two by the fearful and the unbelieving and the abominable and the murderers and the whole mongers the sorcerer and idolater and all liars shall have their part or their time in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death so here you can see that everything that is wrong will be consumed in the lake of fire amen but not only those that are sorcerer and murderers that we know that are in the jail right now but even some of the people that are sitting within the churches will find themselves into the lake of fire that's when we open up with the uh mixed multitude ever clear so when we start this origin the first one we spoke about the vessels of mercy the second one we spoke about the just that that were like lamb because they were good unto the brethren amen that was the example we took off an egyptian among the america that was rescued by david and back here then we went from there into the mix multitude and in the mix multitude we found out that it is no more outside people but it's people that are within the camp and we took the example of david and the example of nabal both david and nebo were from the tribe of judah amen but never was full about here and connected to abigail and abigail have to be rescued from neban from foley a wise woman who was connected to foley everybody clear but she have to be rescued because the righteous should no longer continue with the unjust unless they're gonna touch the things that are not support they are not supposed to touch amen we continue on the mixed multitude and now we are getting into the vessels of wrath there is a vessel of mercy according to romans chapter 9 if you remember and we also have the vessels of wrath everybody clear now to understand the vessels of wrath we need to go back up again into the beginning let's go to the book of jude again that's where we are judy have only one chapter the book of jude and lord is willing this will prepare it for wednesday when we begin to get into the angelic claims everybody clear we were in jude chapter five the bible said i will therefore put you in remembrance because we gotta fight for that faith though you once knew this how did the lord have saved the people remember he's a judge and he's also a savior he's the lion and he's also a lamb as a lamb he comes to save you as a judge he's coming to destroy but there are people that cannot be destroyed amen because they are children of god he said having safe that's the lamb the people out of the land of egypt after all destroyed now a lion them that believe not we're going to see down the road why they didn't believe but you already know verse 6 and the angels which kept not their first estate they had a position they have any state they have a place they have a slot but for some reason they could not keep the slot something happened that caused them to lose that slot ever clear we will get into this further down the road and the angel which kept not their first state but left their own habitation remember david say let their habitation be desolate remember they left their own habitation he reserved in everlasting chance in prison under darkness to the judgment of the great day so now we're blending between the mixed multitude and going into the angelic range everybody clear now when we spoke to you we explained to you that eternity is like a ring everybody clear i hope this battery is working eternity is like a ring everybody clear and brother branham said eternity is like a circle a circle there is no beginning there is no end and the only creature that could fit eternity was god because god is infinite and god is eternal everybody clear i hope there is is there anything blocking something there okay it's working it's only god god is eternal and brother branham said god was a fountain of the seven colors i already explained you this now this being called god defeat eternity amen that fit all eternity because only god is eternal and eternity to be fair need a being that is also eternal so god and eternity are like a hand and a glove they fit together amen so when god filled all space all that eternity god didn't have any room to do what he wanted to do anybody following me so god have to create room from eternity so that he can have space to express the things that was within himself everybody following me so god by feeling all eternity god knew every corner of eternity there is no corner of eternity that god doesn't know if you ask god how is corner hey god knows him how he's gonna be god knows it how he's gonna see god knows it how he's gonna eat every single part of eternity god knows it because god filled all eternity everybody clear so through the process of kenosis and a murphy we found that god who was eternal who was invisible who was feeling all this eternity begin to shrink himself down and when god strike himself down god turned into something that was called the pillar of fire everybody clear the pillar of fire was not different than the being that was filling all eternity everybody clear the difference between the pillar of fire and the god that fell that field all eternity is only that the pillar of fire have compact god have blood of god into a one lord of being into a light everybody clear understand me and the pillar of fire gave god the ability to have room around him [Music] are you following me amen so the positive color or the positive charge were completely compact into the pillar of fire and by god shrinking himself into a light he creates space all around him ever here in other words eternity have gaps ever here at the beginning god could not move to the right or to the left because god feels all eternity but through the pillar of fire now god can begin to move left and right up and down and go to the north to the south into eternity that's why brother bonham said he begin to play like a little boy on eternity god begin to run and go here and god begin to run god begin to have more surprises everybody here when a baby is in the womb of mama the baby is tight amen when he moves like this he's kicking mama everybody here so the baby have to be born once the baby's born into the world then the baby is free the baby can move his feet up they can move their hands up and down they can run and do everything they want to do they no longer are a burden to mama everybody clear so eternity have to release god and when eternity release god god shrank himself into the light that light is the light that paul met on the road to damascus that's why paul said who are you lord and that light say i am jesus whom the persecuted the god of the old testament was jesus christ in the new testament because god is light in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and that word was god everybody clear so far so now the pillar of fire begin to have freedom now kinesis means everything that was in a was transferred completely to be everybody clear now all the knowledge of eternity was not lost everybody everything that was in that spirit was still in the pillar of fire but it was blocked completely under because the pillar of fire wanted to express himself god want to pull things out of himself about clear now right here god was no longer a creature that fills eternity everybody clear god became a creature that you can point to anybody here you can look and you say i see god there ever clear if he moves you say i see god over there ever here if you if god moves you can say i see god over there anybody here if you turn around you say sister you are struggling with so and so you have a female trouble why because i see the light on top of you and suddenly brother pranam will turn around and he say i see that same light moving over there and now the same light is sitting upon sister pam over there this is what is going on sister pam this is what is going on in your life go home and you are here and that same light begin to move in other words you can now pinpoint god [Music] everybody here so the god and eternity when they show you god you say this is god where is god this is god where is god this is god but in the pillar of fire you can't say this is god you say this is god right here amen god became a being everybody clear but the knowledge of god in the pillar of fire remained the same knowledge that he has when he filled all eternity everybody clear that ability made god omnipresent [Music] you understand god the omnipresent does not mean that god healed everywhere are we awake god is a being you can point him like you said this is brother kalima if he moved there you say brother kalima move over there if he goes there you say brother kalima move over there amen god now can be pinpointed yet god is omnipresent the omnipresence of god does not mean that he feel everything the only presence of god god is omnipresent by knowledge what are you saying brother kalima brother robert is there with sister laurel but robert is sitting in his bedroom with sister l'oreal they're talking and brother robert begin to tell cecil tomorrow i'm gonna go to walmart and i'm going to pick up something then i'll go to home depot then i will come back to church then i have certain things to do and there is nobody there but brother robert and sister royale rebel clear and suddenly i came home and i went to visit brother robert and i knock at the door and sister hadassah comes and opened it oh brother stephen pastor come sit down and i sat down when brother robert comes out and said god bless you brother robert you were sitting with sister laurel in your bedroom and you were talking to sister l'oreal and you taught sister laurel that you're going to walmart and after one month you're gonna go to home depot and after home depot you're gonna go to church to work what will be the reaction of brother robert did you hear me the way i spoke it seems like i was there with sister l'oreal and brother robert but i was not there everybody here i was there by knowledge america everywhere here but i was not there by my presence here that's why when israel was in war with the syrian everything that the king was doing was disclosed to israel and the king called he said wait a minute do we have spies here or do we have iphone or ring bell or camera in this room that are recording everything or do we have an fbi here someone say it's not fbi fbi is a copy amen there is someone in israel who is a prophet and that man even though he's in israel he can tell you everything that you are speaking in your bedroom that man doesn't have to be there he only have to connect with the one that knows everything ever clear that's why brother branham was saying i cannot do anything until he comes here and when the penalty of fire entered brother branham said i take every spirit here under my control everybody here then brother branham can turn around and say sister you coming from so and so you did so and so and brother branham can go back hold in your life he can also move forward in your life and even tell you things that have not happened yet that is god his only presence is not by being but omnipresence by knowledge hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord god is omnipotent omnipresent by being omniscient meaning knowing everything makes him water he knows all things but god could not be just like the aries because god has a dwelling place god is not a myth god is a god jesus he god pronoun he is a being therefore he is omniscient omnipresent omnipotent and infinite now to be infinite it comes through the word infinite which there is no limit he is eternal eternal like a water he goes around and around and you are trying to find where he began or where he ends there is no beginning or no ending everybody creates so far blessed be the name of the lord and if he is not infinite he is not god god has to be infinite we are finite he is infinite and he was omnipresent omniscient and omnipotent if he is not then he can be god knows all things all places because of his omnipresence omniscient makes him omnipresent he he's a being he's not like the wind he's a being he does in a house but being omniscient come on knowing all things come on makes him water because he knows everything that is going on there can be a flea but it's eyes but what god knoweth and he know it before there was a world how many times about how many times he badgetized and how much tello he had in him there before there ever was a world that is infinite we can't comprehend it in our minds but that is who god is what in other words god knows everything in your life everybody clear if you ask god right now where we sister so and so god will tell you she is in gastonia god doesn't have to be in gastonia but by knowledge it looks like everything you do in life he knows it ever clear he's not there present but he's there by knowledge and that knowledge give god the ability to be like his 24 hours around you if you ask him he knows everything you ask him he knows everything you ask him he knows until you feel like man there's nothing i can do that god doesn't know so god is omnipresent yeah that only present is by knowledge god have your whole life from your birth your conception all the way to the rapture if you ask him he's gonna tell you everything and by telling you everything since your childhood it seems like since your childhood he was with you [Music] ever here blessed be the name of the lord now this being here that was staying there by himself was not really himself [Music] amen brother branham brother branham say now physically we separate from our physical son talking about death because that is still sin but our spirit is of god that can never be separated from god because we are part of god we are brought back into the thoughts of god everything that god does is perfect and eternal and when god's very thought went out for water a kingdom of water so within the pillar of fire there was a kingdom inside the pillar of fire there was a kingdom of people anybody clear so when god was moving he was moving with a package do you follow me when abraham met melchizedek abraham paid that unto melchizedek everybody here but when paul came paul says that when abraham was being taught to melchizedek liver who was in abraham also paid part to melchizedek but abraham when he gave birth he gave birth to who isaac here did you see liver when isaac gave birth he gave birth to whom jacob did you see liver when jacob gave birth then liver came are you there so if liver was in the launch of abraham when abraham was moving liver was there when abraham slept lifa was there when abraham was i was was eating liver was there but to produce liver they have to first produce isaac and to produce isaac to produce liver isaac have to produce jacob and jacob's cam liver so where was isaac everybody here isaac was in abraham so where was jacob if levi was in abraham where was jacob so where was abraham the father of our faith everybody in other words when abraham was working all the children jacob was there you follow me isaac was there liver was there the entire family was walking with abraham the reason why liver intervene it was because god a morphine into melchizedek are you following me melchizedek is a priest ever here so when god presented to abraham according to hebrews 7 as melchizedek you follow me abraham was not a priest isaac was not a priest jacob was not a priest the priest that was in abraham move out and say hey i'm here i'm here i'm here i'm here ever here you understand then the priests have to talk to the priest do you follow me so i ibrahim had isaac he had jacob he had liver when he moved he's moving with his children god also was not alone he has also a package are you there when jesus christ came jesus has a package ever clear whenever when when adam was created adam had a package all they did was to do a surgery to pull the package out here [Applause] [Music] when abraham sleep live asleep because the one who gave the thought naturally was not leaver the one who gave that that naturally was abraham but liver he was compared unto him like he was the one that paid melchizedek being in christ we didn't have to die in calvary when jesus walked we were dead when jesus ate we were there when jesus cuts devil we were there so when jesus died we were there [Applause] when jesus went to hell we went to hell with him when he resurrected we resurrected with him are you there are you there so everything that jesus did god counted as it is you [Applause] if you look and you ask who's dying at the cross they're going to say it to jesus if you ask god who's dying at the cross god said it's mr keller it is brother greg it is enoch it is brother robert it is brother ramona [Applause] the one who gave that was abraham but he was not abraham he was liver liver pay the debt through abraham you paid the debt of god through jesus christ that's why you can no longer die again all you have to do is recognize that you came from god that will say god took your pleasure and what he did it is counted in your account that's why the bible says he that believes on the son has passed from death unto us never to be judged again because god judge you in jesus christ [Applause] by representation [Applause] condemnation by representation glory by representation blessing by representation [Applause] it doesn't matter how many generations it took for liver to come out still he belongs to him it doesn't matter how many years it took for you to be born you still still belong to you [Applause] hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah so out of god came a people so god when he was moving he has his children they were there and he say my god i need to get them out [Music] are you there when he moves around brother john is here and he looks you see brother john playing with brother greg and he see brother freddie talking to brother garcia he said these kids need more room [Applause] hallelujah they need more room it is tight here let me make them a playground so they can go and begin to play and begin to jump and begin to run and begin to scream hallelujah when he moves he moves with them when he moves he moves him in other words it seems like god was fragmented [Music] hallelujah he said it's too much let me shrink myself and let me begin to pull them one by one hallelujah oh my god he said god very touch why not for water a kingdom of people who would do what them very thought is what in the beginning when god filled all space eternity everything that was there was god and he was eternal everybody clear god is eternal 100 percent [Music] so if you take god you cut him eternal you cut him eternal you cut him eternal you cut him eternal you cut him eternal you cut him eternal every ship that comes from god is always eternal hallelujah that's why when they gave jesus the bread they gave jesus a whole bread but when he cut the bread the other way to fill back in when he cut the fish the other fish have to be filled in quickly hallelujah when he baptized you eternal he baptized you eternal he came on the day of pentecost he broke himself in 120 but yet later on perceive him again eternal [Applause] he's a fountain of the living water when you take the water out of his field you take it out his field you take it out he still you take it out that's why he can baptize you and still be god baptize you still be god feel you bestow god [Music] [Applause] hallelujah everybody will receive the holy ghost and yet he's still god he gives you your portion eternal he gives you yours eternal he gives you yours eternal eternal a hundred percent [Music] everything that was in him eternal his liver eternal his heart eternal [Music] his kidney eterna [Music] the package that was in him eternal his children eternal hallelujah you never began a day [Music] amen oh my god if they can no more perish every word of god is water before there was a world before there was a planet before there was a sun before there was a moon before there was light before there was anything when he was still who and god and his what the eternal thoughts of god chose you by by to know what you won't be on the earth hallelujah we get into the vessels of wrath in the beginning god was not even god he was the great eternal in there was attribute attribute was his thoughts and then he become a word like this and the word express a thought express is a word a word expresses a thought remember if you ever was in god's thinking you always be there if you got eternal life you are the expression or the attribute of his thought for this age if not there is only one eternal life and it always existed and you in his mind existed before there was a world that is the reason he said he chose you before the foundation of the it is not what we think what somebody else think it is what god eternal it is his thinking when we say thoughts as human being we usually have a tendency to think about ideas anybody clear remember if you never was in god's thought you shall never be with god how many knows that he was a redeemer anything with him has to come back to where he so if he come to redeem us how could we we or how could we was one time didn't have to be with him and we were all born in sin shaping iniquity come to the word speaking lies it shows that the real christian is a water of water to redeem means to take something that has fallen from its position back to each position if god is redeeming you it is telling you you are worse in a certain position you just lost that position and god is coming to bring you back to that position but what was that position that you had hallelujah it shows that the real christian is a what attribute of god's thinking before there was a or a star or air or anything else it is eternal and he come to redeem us back hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord now when we say thoughts our human mind have a tendency to think like an idea like the wind huh little idea in your mind that is flying you say uh that's my thought that's my thought we have a tendency to think that thoughts are not real they're just like ideas real we say oh yeah this is real this is real this is we thought they thought it's just imaginary that's not how god's thoughts are that is human thoughts but when they say that we were taught it doesn't mean we were imaginary [Music] when they say liver gave that he was not an imaginary liver because later on liver was born and when he was born automatically the priesthood was given unto him because he that would they met him as melchizedek because god has a tendency to flip to to a morphe to change form when he change form he can be a priest and tomorrow he can be a king when he can be a king you see him as david when he's a king david come out i will now go there hallelujah when he stands in eternity if he flip somebody is popping up [Music] be careful here and see this is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from god it is the water or the water [Music] liver was a seed in abraham so abraham was carrying seed a bag of seed but those seed could do certain things so they will not see the imaginary hallelujah that is way back there too far for the human mind to grasp the eternal god with eternal water thoughts and what jacob has i loved but he so have a water oh and neither was born and neither had done good or evil he was a water and then that thought became expressed and god brought back jacob because jacob belong was what jacob alone the seed that is why he had respect to the birthright and covenant of god if you are a true seed you will hear that word the spirit will baptize you into the body of christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and age see how clear the true evidence becomes when the word is revealed to you buckle up pretty good you ready what are you talking about by seed brother stephen hallelujah brother branham say and the real seed of god is a weapon for the water so when you existed of god god carry you as a seed that seed is not just a seed it is a seed with a word in it you follow me you follow me and that seed has a power to suck god make sense make sense do you understand if i take that seed and i put it right here if god passed around that seed that seed will take god and sack him [Music] do you understand do you understand so when you are born in this world god take that seed when you are in the delivery room and then just drop it [Music] it might take 19 years it might take five years he might take 40 years he market 46 years old let just god pass by again [Applause] as god is passing by that seed will begin beep beep beep beep and the more god approaches he got b b b b b b b b b [Applause] you don't have to do it the seed won't do it for you [Music] that's why brother branham said you have nothing to do to be saved my god i'm in the one eighth of where i'm going the real seed of god is an absorbent for the spirit all denominationalism is too cold all unbelief is out and when the holy spirit comes into that germ of life that is laying there he produces another just what another son of god is another amateur god son of water what are you saying brother stephen you ready remember if you ever did or ever will have eternal life you had it with him then you had it with him because jesus came and jesus was the redeemer to redeem anything is to bring it back from where it fallen from all went from amen and you the way you look who you are what your name is that was god thinking before the foundation up there are you ready if i take a seed maybe a mango or an apple the seed of an apple is so small like this anybody if you look at the seed if i stare you if i ask you a question what do you see you say i see a seed but that's not the way it is really you are looking at the tree are you there the height of the tree is in the seed the color of that tree is in the seed the number of apple that will be produced is in the seed the bark is in the seed the branches in the seed so the seed is a package of you your nose is in the seed the texture of your skin is in the skin your race is in the seed your hair is in the seed your height in the seed [Music] stop did i call his hair did that call his eyes did i call his suit [Applause] charles means a boy charles means an african-american charles means a navy suit charles means the son of charles hamilton charles means his eyes just means his noise so when they say your name is written you can be seated in the book of life it is not really the word [Applause] that name is you completely my god hallelujah hallelujah let me go again slowly see how this work god always had his thoughts for adam adam as his thoughts was yet unexpressed psalm 139 verse 15 and 16. we give you a little idea of this my substance was not hid from thee when i was made in in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest part of the earth damn eyes did see my yet being what so when you were in mama um when you were a conception a little embryo here and in thy book brother branham said thy book means the book of life in that book all my water where what so but the book of life brother branham said it contain only names because when they say the name that were now written in the book of life everybody clear so the way we thought was when we say book of life we think it's greg lamont that's nothing ever clear everybody because the book of life contained name but now david is saying that my members in other words my feet my hand were written in the book of life oh the book of life contain only names so your name is more than just the name your name is your being that book all my members were what he doesn't say his leg he's this when you look charles but in charles there is a big genetic code hallelujah which in continuous were fashioned when as yet they were hallelujah was not written about adam but he gave you the idea and knowledge that the thought was there in his mind and that thought was eternal and had to be expressed so when adam was formed of the dust of the earth and his spiritual being created by god then adam became god start express and those eternal thoughts were now what manifested so who you are your color your height your gender your hair everything was packaged under your name [Music] all god have to do is just call your name jesus never stood and said the eyes of lazarus come the ears of lazarus come the kidney of lazarus come there the lungs of lazarus come the toes of lazarus come how many years would jesus stand to call every element of lazarus all jesus has to say is just lazarus come forth when he said lazarus the hair of lazarus adhered the nose of lazarus heard the kidney of lazarus heard everything that was dead heard god calling lazarus they all stood up and they came together outside [Applause] [Laughter] oh my god blessed be the name of the lord job say if a man die shall he leave again all the days of my appointed time will i wait till my water job say if i'm dying i'm going to wait till his change come but how are you going to come out is he going to stand there and say the molecule of job won't come the the ear come the eyes come the eyebrows come job didn't say that job say dash and what all i need is a call [Music] that's your call and i will work not my hair will answer are you there that will have a desire to the work of thy own hand brother but i'm saying nothing will be saved only those whose what were put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world jews or gender see that's all the book holds that what and the book is only unfolding it now not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling those what you finally understand now the book does not say now lee fail is to be saved in time of this church age or all men never or whoever no he don't say that it just shows the word unfold the mystery of what they think is what are you saying a man came in jordan and he came with a strange doctrine he began to preach and when people come to him he take them drawn them in the water they say what is this doctrine out of water drop down in the water out of water they say what is god they say man there is a man there called john the baptist what he's doing we don't know where he's getting this he's taking people and joining them in the water and pulled them back up and they come white and even women even women yes even the women the children they put them and bring them back up the pharisees say wait a minute let's call the council there's a big church standing over there there's a man by the name of john who his father is a leaver he was a leaver here but he never stayed in the seminary he ran away from his parents to the bush now he's out he didn't even study the law of moses and here he's there he's joining people send people you you go ask him what is he doing are you there when they came they look they say who are you do you think they didn't know his name do you think they didn't know his name are you there john heard what they were asking him they were telling john show us your name in the book they were not asking john show us your name in the hospital they were not asking john show us your name in gastonia county [Music] they were asking john you bringing strange things but when we look we don't see you where are you in the book hallelujah that's why john never said that i am the son of zechariah they already knew him john said i am the voice of the one crying in the water john say i am isaiah 40. are you there are you there so when you look in the bible john the baptist john the baptist you will never find it in the old testament yet it is dead [Applause] the name of john was written in mystery [Music] are you there so when john said i am when god said i am the voice of the one crying in the wilderness john the baptist say here father when you look you say i am the voice crying in the wilderness yes it's me oh no you are john no it is me john is my family name but my true identity is the voice crying in the wilderness [Applause] [Music] are you there it is written in mysteries that's why you don't chase brother branham by the name brother branham in the bible [Music] [Applause] so your name contains a mystery that entire life and when god called that mysteries brother branham say the sweetest sound that a man can heal is the sound of his own name are you there but if i say the voice of the one crying in the wilderness does that sound good to your ear you want to be called benjamin the voice of the one crying in the wilderness oh i'm embarrassed everybody will be looking at me like the voice of the one or crying in the wilderness that's what you will say you want to be called ben brother benjamin right but when god calls amen to tell you that it's your name you're gonna feel something in your heart that is rejoicing like wow that is good you are hearing your name [Applause] he doesn't say divine it is the word that is sweeter to your heart until you feel like i just want to be that that is you [Applause] and it's coded under the message of your hour so when the message has been preached somebody else stood up and said praise the lord that's me what you heard you heard my ego hallelujah the people might be around you they can't hear nothing but you heard something what you heard that is your name that was written in the book of life [Music] why when they call your name you respond why did you respond to god what makes you respond to god that which made you respond to god that's your name [Music] that which make you stop smoking and stand up and begin to go that was your name it is written in mysteries and it's unfolding to you that's why the new birth is a personal revelation of jesus christ to you hallelujah my god where are we my god so you were sons of god and daughters of god before there even was a moon star of molecule you are sons and daughters of god for you are only the physical manifestation of the attribute that was in god at the beginning you don't know nothing about it neither did you know when you was in your earthly father but you are manifested in his image like liver amen in the image of god you are made and you were manifested for the and of god the children were making too much noise everybody clear and therefore as sure as your chin had to be in your father your natural breath your spiritual water had to be in who because you are an expression of the attribute of its thoughts before the foundation of the world no way around that that is right so the thoughts of god are real the thoughts of god are human [Music] amen who's producing the vessels of mercy you understand this now he had now he have shrank himself from eternity and now he created space in eternity amen now he can move and be free then he have to give birth are you okay when he gave birth fox came out [Music] morningstar [Music] everybody in this package came out of him like remember he met mercy he met abraham as melchizedek who came leave a move so when he morphing melchizedek he's calling for liver but liver can come out just like that so automatically abraham pops out are you there then i say come out not in the natural we are in heaven we already left the nature we are way back there [Music] levi's still not there jacob comes and then people leave a stand and when he stands for some reason moses come because the most is from the tribe of liver and before you know it when moses came out aaron comes and they all stood he said that's fun i got it let me flip again are we there these everything that came out of him as we have now all demonstrated to you is eternal you understand now eternal eternal eternal 100 in other words no beginning no ending the only difference now you are no more in him you just came outside because they created space in eternity now not only him is playing you together you are playing to give an ideology you playing you kick the ball god also kick you back you kick the ball god also kick him back and then you jump on him and he goes and he pull you back you just forgot that story [Music] spiritual amnesia are you there when he did that he created the morning style in revelation 22 i jesus has sent manager to testify unto you these things in the churches i am the root and the offspring of who there and what he is the bride and morningstar you okay job 38 where upon are the foundation there are fasting or who like the cornerstone thereof wonder who he is the morning star and he is god all right we are [Music] so we start the church in eternity when we came out because in him we were bottling up he said these boys need him when he we came out shouting from joy screaming in eternity [Music] hallelujah we begin to play in eternity somebody goes there he said and the other side said [Applause] are you there starts traveling left and right are you there and that is sitting there and he's just watching them one is flipping flipping flipping flipping flipping the other one is carrying the other one and they put all of them and that is looking he said finally they got room to play [Applause] hallelujah so when he begin to create me and you were sitting there when he started creating we said praise the lord god that the goddard yeah yeah yeah the sons of god were shouting for joy [Applause] that's why job he said where were you when i was laying the foundation of the when the sons of god were shouting for joy we were looking like wow daddy show us the next one he said you want to see it i'm going to create mercury and then mercury we can say wow praise be the name of the lord [Applause] hallelujah you are somebody you are nobody you are not nobody you are somebody [Applause] [Music] hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord when the sons of god came and expressed themselves god looked and he began to pull his story [Music] i'm not even oh my god god pull his story god say okay i need to go with my story of redemption the story of the book remember then god begin to look he say okay what is going to happen a story i am god he look he say okay moses say wait a minute he looks he save you he pull the back look healer pull it back he look redeemer he look everybody is eternal [Music] how can you redeem somebody eternal they are just flipping an eternity say but what cannot do if you want to pull this one this one can come you see it goes back god say what can i do because brother branham said he shrunk himself he came down into a pillar of fire and created everything an empty space around him and all the positives were combined in one place you understand because albert einstein brother branham said he saw that circle that center that if you contacted you can create world everything else was in the negative it was a void right about here by law of contrast you follow me god have to film the blanks everybody faith he too into an angel when he murphy we call him the angel of the lord but here then more free more fake game into an archangel [Music] i talked to even somebody last night about it he morphed into an archangel we're gonna i'm i'm laying the foundation then on wednesday we pick up the angelic beings and we continue to go when he did it the law of construst needed a different being that is coming to make the attribute of his being to be expressed everybody here because every time he was expressing himself he will create abraham eternal he created liver eternal he created jacob eternal he created when i'm talking about great i'm talking about the spirit that was coming there they were eternal he created jacob eternal liver came out eternal are you following me then he keep on and moses came out and then aaron came out all of them were coming eternal eternal but the law of conscience was requesting another kingdom you follow me and that kingdom god cannot create evil now slow down and stay tight god is pure 100 god no shadow of light his full god amen but he have to create something to express the plan of redemption but if he create it's got to be first something that is good because it's coming out of him not really out of him but he have now to start manufacturing something that is not part of him are you following me are we following me then god looked he could not see anything in him that can be like that one you follow me then god have to begin to draw something that was not in him before the foundation of the world when he drew god pulled a being and the being began to come out god created him are you there he called this being the son of the morning everybody clear this being was not morningstar you follow me this being was not morning stars these are morning star and morning star these right here are not son of the morning stars forget this let me go back here this is morning star this is morning star this is not sun of the morning star this is god's these are gods they are not sons of god they are gods they are as good as this one is god remember i just show you they were eternal like brother branham says make sense but this one is not a morningstar but he is a son they have to birth him by creation hallelujah how they have fallen from heaven oh what son of what not mourning but son off are you there for they have said in the heart i will ascend into heaven i will be ex i will exalt my what he had the position above the weapon i will exalt my throne above the weapon the only one that was above the morningstar was the morning star himself because he is the father but this one came and want to take position and above the morningstar in other words he want to be like the morning star because he was not the morning star but he was the son of the morning origin i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of i will sit also when you say also meaning somebody else is already there you want to copy him i was sick also upon the mount of the woo because he was god who was above his children he was looking at the congregation of his children playing around are you there in the side of the north i will ascend above the height of the cloud i will be like duh now you see here what he was looking for what does he mean remember brother branham say satan was a water a creature of water son of the world so son of the morning doesn't mean lucifer came from god his son by creation not by attribute are you there in other words between lucifer and the one who created there is no relationship by code by gene where are you getting this stuff john 14 chapter 30 hereafter i will not talk to you i will not talk much with you for the who the prince of water who's the prince of this world the priest of this world lucifer cometh and he has what [Music] any question another word in god there is no representation of lucifer [Applause] there is nothing inside god that looked like lucifer when god looked at you he looked at him he finds you he look at you you are there he look at you you are there he look elizabeth no idea some by creation that's why brother branham said when the bible says that the sons of god looks at the daughters of god brother branham said those sons of god were not the true seed of god they were sons of god like lucifer sons of god by creation canaanite not by relationship god did not create him satan are you there god did not created him devil because satan cannot come out of god devil cannot come out of god god created him lucifer which means a ninja of light are you there he became devil devil means come from the greek word diabolos which means false accuser anything everybody okay and satan means adversary god cannot create a false accuser god created lucifer and brother branham said we will go down on wednesday lord's willing and you're going to see brother branham say god put them in free moral agency to choose what is right or what is wrong because what i'm saying heaven was created of was made of the word of god so god put his word and said this is it this is it this is it this is it everybody is created lucifer is created here is lucifer this is my word and he put him on free moral agency the problem with lucifer but what i'm saying he was called equal with god maybe on wednesday or dawn next sunday we're going to get down on those quotes brother branham said he was god's right hand man are you there him and michael could meet together not with god only when god is morphing michael we're gonna go there anybody clear anybody understanding so when god created him he put him in free moral agency brother branham said god gave him so much right and authority but he didn't understand what he means by being under one head lucifer thought god is democratic in first john chapter 3 not as who who was of the world who was the wicked one in the garden of eden one scripture was adam the wicked one was if the wicked one the bible say adam was the son of god in luke chapter 3 38 but the bible says ken was of the wicked one who was wicked in the garden of eden came who was one of the wicked one and threw his water hallelujah amen now when lucifer was created god also created his children let me hit this so we can let you go home john chapter 8 38 39 the answer and say unto him abraham is our word jesus said unto them if you were abraham what you will do the works of who [Music] but now you seek to do what a man that had told you the truth which i have heard of who this did not who is it a different bible don't say dead to him we be not born in fornication we have one father who they thought they came from god because they were jew but they didn't come from god even though they were jew jesus said unto them if god were you you would do what because i would have been with you in eternity are we okay now is he clicking now when we were in eternity it was only perfect love we were loving each other with my children up and down playing but what you are expressing over there i never seen it you want to see what brother branham did spoke about why lucifer cannot even enter the sixth dimension i heard the quote i could not put it up if god were your father you would love me for i proceeded forth and came from who neither can i of myself but he sent me why did he not understand my speech even because he cannot hear my year of your fatherhood [Music] thank you very much and the last of your father you would do he was a water from the water now you understand why ken can kill keep in mind they cannot abide in the truth they can be in the truth but they won't stay in the truth later on i'm going to show you that i wish i had more time they can start but they won't remain they can be in the book of life but their name war because there is no truth in water when he speaks a lie he speaks of what i didn't create him like that for he is huh and a father of it he that is of god heareth god's word ye therefore hear them not because [Music] i went all the way there then when it come to the office you're gonna see what happened in the earth let's head to the airport the field is the world the good seat out there of the kingdom but the tears are the children of the world who's the wicked one the enemy has some that sown them is there matthew 23 then shall the king say unto them on the right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepare for you from the foundation of the they are blessed but 41 then shall he say also unto them on the left side the remember the right side is lamb and the other one is depart from me ye what into everlasting prepare for who and his we're going to understand who are those angels because we thought he was only angelic being amen so by the attribute of the lion god have to express his wrath these right here became children of wrath let me drive couple and i'll go home proverbs 16 verse 4 the lord has made all things for himself yeah even there for the day of what [Music] they didn't create them for glory because he is a lion he have to express his wrath he needed somebody to express his word that's why death in the scripture this morning say turn their table turn their habitation remove them from the book of life they are unredeemable for these are there are certain kept in anywhere who will be followed or dead to this water before the foundation of the world or then predestinated to be condemned amen men turning the grace of our god into water they have a power of perversion by their father and denying their only lord god and our lord jesus christ while i was with them in the world i kept them in that name those that that gave us me i have kept and none of them is what but the son of water how did he become the son of perdition we will get it down the road that the scripture might be what jesus answered them have not i chose u12 the choosing yes i am the one who did it amen amen and one of you is what who was he talking about he speak of who how can a human being be a devil because devil are spirit right but he looked at a human being he said you are a devil how can a human being be a devil we usually think devil are demons his speck of judas is carrying the son of simon for he he was that should betray him being one of the twelve lord help me man has always tried to do something to save himself there is nothing you can do about it god save you unconditionally [Applause] [Music] he just calls you you remember the name you remember the calling he just calls you predestinated you to be water and somebody predestinate to be what [Music] the bible says so manifold followed them to this condemnation lord help me lay this plane here there is no way of separating church natural and church spiritual but the church spiritual is the elect church because when god created lucifer and he created his children he caused a mixture in eternity we all begin to be mixed together they could not harm you yet because they were not expressed in the devilish kingdom yet so they were friends to you [Music] hallelujah call out and set aside by god and they are the one that will heal the word of god no matter how hard it seems strange to say but some men are predestinated to eternal we don't like to think those things but there is some people who will never be saved no matter what you do they are very religious [Music] they're not new to you here you were with them in eternity are you there hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord job that the wicked is reserved for the day of what they shall be brought forth to the day of water because they predestinated to that he have to unleash his wrath but he can't do it on his child when he see john he changed into a lamb yet they say they lie on her are you there he that believes on the son of or on the son have everlasting life and he that believes not the son shall not see life but what the wrath of god abideth on what how can you see the sun if the sun doesn't make himself known to you raging wave of the sea forming out their own shame wandering water that's why when they get into the eternity and discipline children to whom is reserve water blackness of water forever and enoch also the seventh from adam prophesies of this saying behold the lord cometh with ten thousand to do what to execute water a stone of stumbling a rock of who even to them which stumbled at the being disobedient whereunto also they were they were appointed not to obey the word of god amen no one will rise from the dead yet he will not believe that is what jesus said in luke 16 yes no matter what will take place there is people in the world that were born not to believe no matter what you do they will not believe it anyhow pharaoh was raised up for the same purpose how can they do miracle miracle miracle and still pharaoh can get it finished aren't you happy tonight that god tended your heart to look to calvary and to believe hallelujah hallelujah they were predestinated to disbelieve the word sure for them of god to be unbelievers what a beautiful shape unbeliever can help him no more than esau could not help being eso or pharaoh being who hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord why to use crab and pharisee hypocrite for he come past the syrian land to make one proselyte and when he's made you make him twofold more the child of what then who they were children of hell you serpent generation of what who how can you escape the damnation of hell to the lake of fire for he is for for so is his name by interpretation with them seeking to turn away the deputy from faith then saw who is corporal filled with the holy ghost not a human man set his eyes on him the microscope enter to decode the gene and say all full of work do you remember that word from eden the serpent was very subtility and all what that shard of the what it was the holy ghost that discerned this man that shard of the devil the enemy of all water not predestinated to be saved hallelujah god judges the righteous yes and god is angry with the water how many days every day they make god angry god is the judge he put it down one he set it up another for in the hand of the lord there is a cup and the wine is red it's a full of mixture and he poured out the same but they dragged thereof all the wicked of the earth shall ring them out and drink them because they were predestinated to that amen let me finish with this ye have he quicken who are dead in trespasses and sin wearing in time past ye walk according to the course of this world according to the priests of the power of the air the spirit doubt now worketh in the children of what you were not a child of disobedience you were just walking among them among whom also we all had our conversation in tampa we were in the nightclub we were drinking we were smoking amen in the last of the flesh fulfilling the desire of deflation of the man and where by what the children of what even as water so when somebody look at jacob by nature it looks like he's a bad boy are you there but god who is reaching water for his great love wherewith he loved us [Music] and i'm finishing here yeah oh children of what and the children of water we are not children of the night no of water has once appointed us to water you will never be destroyed by god you will never be judged by god you will never go to hell you are not a child of wrath [Applause] god has not predestinated you to wrath but to obtain water by who by jesus christ by grace are you saved never to go to hell never to be destroyed because you are mourning stars like your father is a morning star yeah god you are children of the most high god you are the king of god let's stand [Music] if the devil was troubling you whether you know where you'd whether you're a child of god or not it's enough are you there it's enough we cannot be 10 years in the message being torn mandated whether you're a child of god or not the little mistake you make doesn't mean that you're not a child of god amen it doesn't have anything to do with you amen peter made mistake he made a lot are you there when jesus looked at him he said peter satan love you he was looking for you to get you but it doesn't work i pray for you peter didn't pray [Music] he was not peter's prayer he was god's own prayer [Music] father let them be one as me and you are one it is not your prayer he already finished everything [Music] peter can deny him he can deny him he can deny him he doesn't do anything to be there when he comes he say peter do you love me do you love me do you love me in other words you cannot be lost peter never you cannot be lost hallelujah peter went and cry hallelujah judah took the money and went ahead and returned the money he could not be redeemed he didn't belong to him he have to let it go but brother stephen he returned the money yes but he's not seed there's nothing to quicken but to peter he said peter feed my sheep me yes with your weakness yes do

and accept them but lord we thank you because you were you didn't mean those things to be interpreted by our brain because with our brain we cannot even figure it out who you are but lord father you have predestinated those things to pass the brain and to go down deep in the heart and in the heart you put a receiver that can accept the word no matter how irreasonable unreasonable that looks oh that seems to be further but still deep in our soul we know that something is positing and saying that this is the truth lord your prophet keep talking about if the bride recognizes who she is father we are not different by the very gene of you we are the very attribute that came from you there is no dna test that can be given that will deny our relationship and our origin lord father and our connection with you we were connected with you since eternity we always existed with you and you permitted us to bypass our theophany so that we can drop down in this world to be developed lord father into the image of the living god father lord jesus christ may you help your children reach to the point where they can rest rest from their religious work rest from their dead work rest lord father from all kind of fabrication of religion may lord father they remember that you're the one that is responsible you're the one that paid the price we are your possession you own us you are our lord and

been beating down on them lord father upsetting them left and right with demonic spirit lord all those little tiny demons for years may they rise up as sons of god lord and realize that they were not meant for this low cheating hypocritical life but they were meant to be living a peaceful and to display the glory and the fellowship that they have with their lord and be the salt of this earth lord

give a strength and it's certain uh it's a certain inspiration for when you are a little bit weak and if it it made to thin they give it strength but when you take too much sometimes you feel like you'll go to rest too much food it makes certain reaction you know that if you feel like i feel a little bit uh sleepy it's it's too much food for you for certain people they feel so like like like jump and running and everything but if i oh no more soup is too much for me if you continue i think i'm gonna sleep because you know sometimes you need time to die yes and that's what's happening is
