[37:59] be there in our midst and I tell you
[38:01] what an honor it is that the king of

[38:05] building amen I believe you know the
[38:08] prophet taught us that the angel of the
[38:09] Lord he loved that song yes sir and so I
[38:12] believe that It prepares an atmosphere
[38:14] for the Lord to move and to speak to us
[38:16] and I want to have the right atmosphere
[38:19] don't you amen you you've got the
[38:21] atmosphere in a building but you also
[38:23] have the atmosphere of what you carry
[38:25] yes siren as the prophet taught us some
[38:27] people you like to be around some people
[38:29] maybe not so much and it's because you
[38:32] carry an atmosphere I say Lord I I want
[38:34] to have an atmosphere to where when you
[38:36] speak I can say yes Lord that's for me
[38:40] amen we just want to have a prepared
[38:41] heart for the word and uh we just want
[38:44] to go to the Lord in a word of prayer
[38:45] tonight before we look to the word if
[38:47] you have a need upon your heart just
[38:49] lift your hand to him and ask him to
[38:50] speak to you and uh I believe that all
[38:53] things are possible tonight so let's
[38:54] just bow our heads together Lord Jesus
[38:56] we love you with all of our hearts Lord
[38:59] and we thank you for another opportunity
[39:01] to assemble together Lord with Believers
[39:03] of like Precious Faith Lord the songs of
[39:06] Zion have been sung Lord to create an
[39:08] atmosphere here we know the prophet put
[39:11] things in proper order and we know that
[39:14] worship creates an atmosphere that the
[39:16] supernatural can take place Lord that
[39:18] your presence would be welcome and Lord
[39:20] we don't want any Spirit we don't want
[39:22] any attitude or anything to displease
[39:25] the presence of the Holy Spirit Lord I
[39:28] pray if there would be any hindering

[41:14] the invitation to come we greet you
[41:16] tonight also from Brother Josh Bennett
[41:17] our pastor and I wanted to be sure and
[41:20] bring greetings to the church here I'm
[41:21] glad to have my wife and baby here with
[41:23] me also and I appreciate her making the
[41:26] sacrifice to be here
[41:28] it is a sacrifice when you have a little
[41:29] baby to take care of so uh you pray for
[41:32] her that the Lord will strengthen her as
[41:33] we travel and go about it can be
[41:35] stressful at times but we know that God
[41:38] is with us and we know that he's
[41:40] faithful and so may the Lord bless you
[41:42] tonight uh let's read here in Genesis 45
[41:45] and3 yes sir the Bible says and Joseph
[41:48] said unto his Brethren I am Joseph doth
[41:52] my father yet live and his Brethren
[41:54] could not answer him for they were
[41:56] troubled and at his presence and Joseph
[41:58] said unto his Brethren come near to me I
[42:01] pray you and they came near and he said
[42:03] I am Joseph your brother and mean it
[42:06] amazing they didn't realize who he was
[42:08] at
[42:09] first whom he sold into Egypt now
[42:11] therefore be not grieve nor angry with
[42:14] yourselves that you sold me hither amen
[42:17] this is so so so powerful look at the
[42:21] character of J itself in this he said
[42:25] you s me thither he already knew why for
[42:28] God did send me before you to preserve
[42:32] life now they thought they was the one
[42:34] that did that but actually it was
[42:36] God Amen it was God that did that for
[42:40] God did send me before you to preserve
[42:43] life for these two years hath the famine
[42:45] been in the land and yet there are five
[42:48] years in the which there shall neither
[42:51] be earring nor Harvest and God sent me
[42:53] before you to preserve you of posterity
[42:56] in the Earth Earth and to save your
[42:58] lives by a great Deliverance so now it
[43:01] was not you that sent me hither but God
[43:05] he hath made me Father the Pharaoh and
[43:07] Lord of all his house and a ruler
[43:11] throughout all the land of Egypt amen
[43:13] now if we'd also turn into a very
[43:15] familiar scripture in Romans 8:28 these
[43:18] to me tie together so
[43:22] perfectly we know that all things work
[43:25] together amen we know that all all
[43:27] things work together for the good to
[43:30] them that love God to them who are
[43:32] called amen according to his purpose for
[43:36] for whom he did for no yes sir he also
[43:38] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[43:41] image of his son yes sir that he might
[43:43] be the first MN first born among many
[43:46] Brethren moreover whom he did
[43:48] predestinate then he also called and
[43:51] whom he called he also Justified and
[43:55] whom he justified them he also glorified
[43:58] amen we just ask that God would bless
[44:00] his word as you can be seated and I want
[44:02] to speak to you on humiliation then
[44:06] glorification glory to God humiliation
[44:10] then glorification yes my brother I
[44:12] think it's very amazing uh how God does
[44:14] things don't you God God does things in
[44:17] such a peculiar way he does things in
[44:20] such a unique way and uh just plainly he
[44:23] does things we would have never done and
[44:25] that's right he moves ways we would have
[44:28] never thought I think a powerful
[44:30] scripture in this is Isaiah 558 and the
[44:33] prophet Isaiah there puts it so
[44:35] beautifully he says for my thoughts are
[44:37] not your thoughts that's right and
[44:39] neither are your ways my ways sayith the
[44:42] Lord so he's directly telling us here
[44:45] the amen the thoughts I have they're not
[44:47] your thoughts and the ways that I have
[44:50] they're not your ways amen then he
[44:52] continues on here and he says for as the
[44:55] heavens are higher than the Earth Earth
[44:57] so are my ways higher than your ways and
[45:01] my thoughts than your thoughts so if
[45:04] God's thoughts and God's ways are so
[45:06] high as the heavens are above the Earth
[45:08] don't you think he knows what he's doing
[45:11] amen if his ways and his thoughts are
[45:13] are as high as the Earth is from the
[45:15] heaven then surely God knows what he's
[45:18] doing and God knows amen he he he he
[45:21] knows the end from the beginning and he
[45:23] knows what he's doing and and God has a
[45:27] a powerful way he does things because he
[45:29] does things his way is that right amen
[45:32] let me say it this way if God does it
[45:34] his way it's the best way amen if God
[45:37] does things his way it's a perfect way
[45:40] if God has his way and he does things
[45:43] his way it's the best way that something
[45:46] can be done and so we want to say God
[45:48] Have Your Way amen whatever way you
[45:50] bring about healing I trust you to bring
[45:53] it about in that man whatever way you
[45:55] bring about deliver I trust you in the
[45:58] way you'll bring about Deliverance amen
[46:01] listen friends sometimes healing is a
[46:03] process and sometimes it's a miracle
[46:06] sometimes it's
[46:07] instantaneous and sometimes you're
[46:09] waiting on your healing and you're
[46:11] waiting and waiting amen but don't don't
[46:15] be afraid of the weight but have joy in
[46:17] the weight because God is going to
[46:19] fulfill the thing that he started and
[46:22] the way God is going to bring it to the
[46:24] end is going to be a perfect way now we
[46:27] know God heals in ways we would not have
[46:29] seen God speaks in ways we would not
[46:32] have seen God moves in ways that we
[46:34] don't see sometimes amen sometimes it
[46:37] seems like God's silent but that's when
[46:39] he's moving and working some sometimes
[46:42] it seems how how in the world could this
[46:44] be in the plan of God but yet it be so
[46:47] perfectly in the plan how how could all
[46:50] this bad that's happening and this is
[46:52] happening and this is how can you tell
[46:54] me that's in the plan of God amen listen
[46:57] friends the bad is in God's plan the
[47:00] good is in God's plan the trouble is in
[47:03] God's plan the issues are in God's plan
[47:07] amen the disappointments are in God's
[47:09] plan the discouragement are in God's
[47:11] plan Glory humiliation is in God's plan
[47:16] but
[47:17] glorification is also in God's plan amen
[47:21] let's not judge him foolish but let's
[47:24] judge him faithful let's not judge him
[47:27] foolish because how things are but let's
[47:29] judge God Faithful that the end will be
[47:34] better amen God does things his way we
[47:37] just need to trust him and you'll find
[47:40] many instances throughout the Bible that
[47:42] I think display the ways of God you'll
[47:45] find a lot of instances of humiliation
[47:47] and then God bringing it to a
[47:49] glorification and you know sometimes it
[47:52] takes humiliation to bring God on the
[47:54] scene is that right amen sometimes it
[47:56] takes uh complete humiliation to bring
[48:00] God on you say what how could you say it
[48:02] takes humiliation to bring God on the
[48:04] scene well look when when God came on
[48:07] the scene he poured himself into a body
[48:10] the fullness of the godhead bodily came
[48:13] into his son Jesus Christ brother bandam
[48:16] said the most humiliating thing God
[48:18] could have done he came into a body and
[48:22] he washed the feet of his very own
[48:25] creation brother it was God hidden in
[48:29] humiliation it was God hidden in
[48:31] humility and we must come about the same
[48:34] route of humiliation but if you're
[48:37] willing to if you're willing to
[48:39] humiliate yourself in front of this
[48:41] church in front of your neighbors in
[48:43] front of your peers amen you might just
[48:46] get somewhere with God but listen
[48:48] friends sometimes Pride keeps us it
[48:51] keeps us out of the hand of God I say if
[48:54] I had to shout I will shout if if I've
[48:57] got to cry I will cry if I've got to
[49:00] pray at an altar I will pray at an altar
[49:03] it's humiliation that brings
[49:05] glorification that brings God on the
[49:09] scene amen we have to be willing y'all
[49:12] y'all all know the story The Prophet
[49:13] told about that man he he worked for a
[49:15] man and he said sir I I want the
[49:18] religion you God he he noticed the Holy
[49:20] Ghost in that man y'all know the story
[49:22] he said I want I want that religion you
[49:24] God he said well I tell you what after
[49:25] work or whenever it was you come with me
[49:28] and we'll go out and get this religion I
[49:31] I'll get you this Holy Ghost experience
[49:32] that I've got y y'all know how the
[49:34] prophet talks about it he said the boy
[49:37] came out where and he went back uh
[49:38] bypass the stable there he said well
[49:40] we'll come in here and pray he said no
[49:42] you don't get it here he said so they
[49:44] kept on walking and went by a field he
[49:46] said well we'll just come out here in
[49:48] the field I'm begin to kneel down I'm
[49:50] begin to pray he said no you don't get
[49:52] it in that field and they walked on by
[49:54] the where this there was bit this big uh
[49:56] Pig pin I believe something like that
[49:58] that was just so full of deep of mud and
[50:02] M he said what we got to do is we got to
[50:04] climb in here and then we'll begin to
[50:07] pray amen you got to climb in here and
[50:10] then begin to pray and that man like
[50:12] well I I don't know if I could actually
[50:13] do that now he said well you don't want
[50:15] it bad enough he said well I guess I'll
[50:18] go ahead and and go dip in and go get in
[50:20] there and begin to pray and the man
[50:23] begin to start and he said wait a minute
[50:25] you don't have to get in there that pin
[50:27] and in that muck and in that mire to
[50:29] begin to pray but you do have to be
[50:32] willing to get out there and humiliate
[50:35] yourself to obtain an experience with
[50:38] God now listen friends I'm no scientist
[50:41] but I can see what a prophet saying he's
[50:43] saying the church has got to be willing
[50:46] to humiliate themselves they got to be
[50:49] willing to lose all reputation they've
[50:52] got to be will brother listen if you're
[50:54] wrong you got to be willing to be
[50:56] correct
[50:57] if you have to humiliate yourself you've
[51:00] got to be willing to humiliate yourself
[51:02] and no matter what it is you just have
[51:05] to be
[51:06] willing that's exactly right you find
[51:09] God moves in humiliation God moves in
[51:12] humiliation I think it's powerful you
[51:14] look in the Old Testament Abraham is
[51:16] there and God gives him a promise of a
[51:18] son he he gives him a supernatural
[51:21] promise here and you you just bear with
[51:23] me I don't want to take so much time but
[51:24] I want to build into something here if
[51:26] that's okay okay but Abraham is here in
[51:28] the Old Testament and God gives him a
[51:30] promise of
[51:31] impossible he gives him a promise of
[51:34] impossible and he tells Abraham in old
[51:37] age and Sarah's in old age that you're
[51:40] going to Bear a sign in your old age now
[51:43] listen friends amen he had to battle
[51:46] criticism he had to battle naysayers he
[51:49] had to battle being humil amen could you
[51:52] imagine how humiliating it had to be
[51:54] he's there preparing a nursery
[51:57] he's preparing baby clothes he's
[51:59] preparing all of this and Sarah's
[52:01] getting older and Abraham's getting
[52:04] older and all of this is happening but
[52:07] yet he had the testimony brother and
[52:09] sister he staggered not at the promise
[52:12] of God that he was strong in faith and
[52:16] he kept on giving God praise and
[52:18] thanksgiving listen friends what was he
[52:20] doing he was humiliating himself but
[52:23] listen brother it was worse him to humil
[52:26] humiliate himself and to keep his
[52:29] testimony that I don't know how it's
[52:31] going to happen I don't know when it's
[52:33] going to happen but God made the promise
[52:36] to me it may look foolish to you it may
[52:39] look crazy to you but I'm going to have
[52:42] a
[52:44] son he humiliated himself brother sister
[52:48] not just for one year not just for 2
[52:50] years not just for 10 years but for
[52:54] 25 years he looked like a fool to the
[52:58] world he looked like a crazy man to the
[53:00] world but oh brother sister when they
[53:03] look at that pregnancy test and turns
[53:05] out that Sarah is pregnant he said
[53:08] listen it used to be humiliation but now
[53:11] you're seeing the glory of God it used
[53:14] to be humiliating but now you're seeing
[53:17] the miracle it used to be humiliating to
[53:21] testify that God has given us a baby am
[53:24] I going to have a baby but through the
[53:27] humiliation God turned it around and he
[53:30] brought a
[53:31] glorification through their
[53:35] life such a powerful thing he used
[53:38] humiliation somebody willing to be
[53:42] humiliated but see what was it it was
[53:44] God preparing the faith of Abraham it
[53:46] was God trying the faith of Abraham and
[53:50] Abraham couldn't understand why am I
[53:52] going through this it has been year
[53:55] after year after year here we are
[53:57] praying and believing and praying and
[54:00] believing and nothing is happening but
[54:03] listen friends all things will work
[54:05] together for the good to them that love
[54:09] God Amen now listen friends the Bible
[54:11] did not say that everything would be
[54:14] good but the Bible did say it would work
[54:17] together for the good oh church he did
[54:21] not say everything would be good but he
[54:24] did say it would work together together
[54:26] for your good amen if I was you I would
[54:29] praise God in the bad times I would
[54:32] praise God when it's hard I would praise
[54:35] God when it's difficult I would look at
[54:38] devil in the face and say devil God is
[54:41] going to turn this around and he's going
[54:43] to get the glory out of it amen God is
[54:47] going to turn it around and it won't
[54:49] just be a test but it'll be a testimony
[54:53] of the glory of God Amen that friend I'm
[54:56] serving a God that can take wrongs and
[54:59] make them right I'm serving a God that
[55:03] can take bad things and make them
[55:07] good that's the God that I serve he can
[55:11] take problems and turn them into
[55:14] testimonies he can take all the bad and
[55:17] turn it into a
[55:19] [Applause]
[55:21] testimony my brother preach preach take
[55:24] your time the truth amen look at Abraham
[55:27] he had to persevere he had to persevere
[55:31] amen let me just say this sometimes you
[55:33] just got to
[55:34] push sometimes you just got to get some
[55:37] grid and got to
[55:39] push that's just the truth sometimes you
[55:42] got to humiliate yourself and say you
[55:44] know what I don't feel like having
[55:45] church I don't feel like praising God I
[55:48] don't feel like being here but I'm
[55:51] persevering and I'm pushing and I'm
[55:54] going anyhow and let me just give you a
[55:57] word of encouragement there is a
[55:59] blessing in
[56:03] pressing how do you know brother sister
[56:06] that tonight could not be your night of
[56:09] healing how do you know that tonight
[56:12] could not be un nighted you wouldn't
[56:14] have known if you didn't press but
[56:16] because you pressed your way to the
[56:18] house of God and you knock on that door
[56:21] and said Lord what do you got for me
[56:23] tonight Hallelujah
[56:26] you got from me tonight if we'd had that
[56:29] attitude we would leave the church
[56:31] service with something in our
[56:34] hand Hallelujah preach my brother preach
[56:38] look at Abraham friends amen he
[56:40] persevered he was humiliated it's so
[56:43] powerful because you find Abraham had to
[56:45] overcome right he plainly he just had to
[56:49] overcome being humiliated I think it's
[56:51] so powerful when you read here in the
[56:53] Book of Genesis because after Abraham
[56:56] returned from the slaughter of the Kings
[56:58] after he returned from a gruesome battle
[57:01] he went up on the hill and here come MDC
[57:05] on the hill and begin to commune with
[57:08] Abraham now listen friends it was not
[57:11] before the battle it was after the
[57:14] battle it was not before the victory it
[57:17] was after the victory it was not before
[57:21] it was after he
[57:23] overcame that he communed with MZ today
[57:26] let me tell you unless you overcome
[57:29] there is no communion with mezc unless
[57:33] you overcome yourself there is no
[57:36] communion with MDC but I say oh brother
[57:39] and sister let us press and let us
[57:41] overcoming let us overcome that we might
[57:45] be able to commune with
[57:47] him amen he suffered humiliation and one
[57:51] of the most powerful testimonies the
[57:54] prophet would preach on Abraham many
[57:56] many many services ain't hardly a sermon
[57:59] that he don't mention the Father Abraham
[58:01] I think it's amazing you look in the Old
[58:03] Testament job had lost everything that
[58:05] he had everything that he had to say he
[58:09] was humiliated ain't even a word to use
[58:12] he lost everything he worked for could
[58:15] you imagine but said you you worked you
[58:18] worked hard for the things you've got
[58:20] and and job was a blessed man and out of
[58:23] nowhere he didn't know why but he lost
[58:25] every everything that's right he did
[58:28] nothing to deserve amen he wasn't
[58:30] sinning he wasn't backsliding we all
[58:33] know the story of job but he was being
[58:36] humiliated could you imagine amen you
[58:38] got a brand new truck and then it gets
[58:40] repoed out of nowhere for no reason you
[58:43] got a million Acres or a 100 acres and
[58:46] then it gets just burned up out of
[58:48] nowhere you got sheep and cattle and
[58:50] auction and they get burned up out of
[58:52] nowhere and then your wife says Curse
[58:54] God and die and then your children get
[58:57] killed brother talk about
[59:00] humiliation talk about being humiliated
[59:04] and he sat on an ash Heap and was
[59:06] scraping his boils with a shell or with
[59:09] a stone but you talk about humiliation
[59:13] but listen through all of the bad job
[59:17] never gave up on the God that he served
[59:20] through all he lost everything he had he
[59:24] lost all that had and he sat on that ass
[59:28] sheet brother amen and the prophet
[59:30] talked about job he said that God came
[59:33] down to job and he gave him a vision he
[59:36] said and what was the vision he said he
[59:38] took him to Jesus
[59:40] Christ that's what he said he said job
[59:44] saw Jesus Christ through a vision but
[59:48] you talk about a
[59:50] glorification he's sitting on and asking
[59:52] why did this happen to me why do all why
[59:55] have I lost lost everything I've had and
[59:58] God shows them my vision and brother
[1:00:00] something in job's heart changed he said
[1:00:03] I know that my redeemer lives and if
[1:00:07] this body be dissolved Amen in my flesh
[1:00:12] I shall see
[1:00:15] God hallelujah he suffered humiliation
[1:00:19] and listen about the God that I serve
[1:00:21] for a minute you realize he lost
[1:00:23] everything that he had and what did God
[1:00:26] knew he doubled everything job
[1:00:30] had talk about
[1:00:32] glorification he lost everything and God
[1:00:35] said I'm not going to leave it that way
[1:00:38] but because you kept your testimony true
[1:00:41] and because you stayed
[1:00:43] positive listen friends
[1:00:46] humiliated his friends came to him and
[1:00:49] said sister you're you're just a sinner
[1:00:51] that's right brother you must have
[1:00:53] backslid for God to to do this to you
[1:00:56] amen but job remained in job kept
[1:00:59] Integrity in his heart amen he kept
[1:01:02] Integrity in his heart he said I'm not a
[1:01:04] sinner amen I have made my sacrifice on
[1:01:07] the altar brother everybody was turned
[1:01:10] against him he was humiliated but at the
[1:01:13] end of it God Amen he gave him a double
[1:01:16] portion of everything that he had that's
[1:01:19] the kind of God I serve and listen job's
[1:01:22] testimony was the Lord has given and and
[1:01:26] the Lord has taken away but blessed be
[1:01:29] the name of the
[1:01:32] Lord he gave me this then he took it
[1:01:35] away and then he gave me double blessed
[1:01:38] be the name of the Lord amen listen
[1:01:44] sometimes sometimes God wants to take
[1:01:47] something away from you so he can give
[1:01:49] you something
[1:01:51] [Applause]
[1:01:54] better sometimes he wants to take
[1:01:56] something away from you and you're
[1:01:58] holding on and holding on God don't take
[1:02:01] this away he said if you just let go of
[1:02:03] that experience of 10 years ago I will
[1:02:07] give you something better than you have
[1:02:09] ever had if you're willing to let go of
[1:02:13] the
[1:02:14] past God will give you something
[1:02:19] fresh Hallelujah he was humiliated and
[1:02:23] being glorified
[1:02:27] Hallelujah you realize he didn't get
[1:02:30] double until the first portion that he
[1:02:32] had was taken away is that right
[1:02:36] sometimes you got to lose it
[1:02:37] all sometimes you got to lose all your
[1:02:41] reputation you got to lose everything
[1:02:43] you've got for God to meet you and speak
[1:02:47] to you and deal with you I say Lord if I
[1:02:50] got to lose it all to get what you have
[1:02:53] for me I'm willing to lose it all
[1:02:58] Hallelujah he came to a revelation Moses
[1:03:01] had to be humiliated right amen he was
[1:03:04] the the most studied person in the land
[1:03:06] of Egypt and he had to forget everything
[1:03:09] he
[1:03:10] learned he had to forget everything he
[1:03:13] learned that's exactly what the prophet
[1:03:15] taught he had to be humiliated said I
[1:03:17] don't know anything he was a smart man
[1:03:20] could you imagine having a PhD and a
[1:03:23] doctorates degree or master's degree and
[1:03:25] say I got to forget it all and I don't
[1:03:27] know nothing what a humiliating thing
[1:03:31] listen friends he went out in the desert
[1:03:34] and he met a pillar fire he met a
[1:03:36] burning bus and the prophet said just a
[1:03:39] couple minutes in the presence of that
[1:03:42] burning bush it did more for Moses in
[1:03:45] the 75 years of training oh friends just
[1:03:49] a couple moments in the presence of the
[1:03:52] pillar of fire it can make all the
[1:03:55] difference
[1:03:57] [Applause]
[1:03:58] look what God did for Moses the prophet
[1:04:01] here in a quote he said let's call
[1:04:03] Another Man by the name of Moses a very
[1:04:05] outstanding character of The Bible he
[1:04:06] said the greatest of all the prophets he
[1:04:10] was the type of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:12] the priest and the king and the lawgiver
[1:04:14] he said he was a very perfect type and
[1:04:17] never a man talked to God outside of
[1:04:19] Christ himself like Moses look at Moses
[1:04:22] so humiliated and yet God was using him
[1:04:25] and he became the greatest prophet in
[1:04:28] the Old Testament even Moses himself he
[1:04:30] said and the Lord your God will raise up
[1:04:33] a prophet like unto me and he prophesied
[1:04:36] of the coming Messiah could you
[1:04:40] imagine imagine a man saying something
[1:04:42] like that the Lord your God will raise
[1:04:44] up a prophet like unto me testifying of
[1:04:47] Christ brother he he he humiliated
[1:04:50] himself and through that he became the
[1:04:52] greatest prophet of the Old Testament
[1:04:55] amen so it's not a mystery that God
[1:04:57] hides himself in humiliation but we have
[1:05:00] to be willing to humiliate ourselves
[1:05:03] before God can bring Glory into our
[1:05:05] lives and I think it's powerful there in
[1:05:08] the New Testament the book of
[1:05:10] Philippians Jay doubtless I count all
[1:05:12] things this is Paul speaking I count all
[1:05:14] things but loss for the Excellency of
[1:05:17] the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord
[1:05:20] for whom I have suffered the loss of all
[1:05:23] things and I do count them but D that I
[1:05:27] may win Christ and we all know the
[1:05:29] prophet talked about Paul the same way
[1:05:30] as Moses he said he had to forget
[1:05:33] everything that he learned and what did
[1:05:35] Paul say he said I count everything I
[1:05:38] learn as dung everything I knew was just
[1:05:42] as dung outside of the Excellency of
[1:05:45] Jesus Christ everything else is
[1:05:49] meaningless it's meaningless brother he
[1:05:52] was so humiliated that he said I don't
[1:05:55] know anything but Christ and him
[1:05:58] crucified and say oh God May the Church
[1:06:01] of the Living God get so humiliated to
[1:06:05] where she says I know nothing but Christ
[1:06:08] and him
[1:06:11] crucified Hallelujah we'll Circle back
[1:06:13] around here to our text now we see very
[1:06:16] powerful lessons in the life of Joseph
[1:06:18] in the Bible right the angel of the Lord
[1:06:20] the prophet talks about Joseph he said
[1:06:22] all right Joseph was one of the
[1:06:23] Patriarchs look at him he was so down
[1:06:25] into Egypt perfect type of Christ amen
[1:06:29] betrayed by his Brethren sold for a few
[1:06:32] pieces of silver then the prophet says
[1:06:34] about 30 pieces about like Christ was he
[1:06:37] wore a coat of many colors as Christ was
[1:06:39] seen in Revelation one setting on a
[1:06:41] throne and a rainbow over him he said
[1:06:44] that seven perfect colors representing
[1:06:47] the seven Church ages another place he
[1:06:49] said Joseph was a perfect type of Christ
[1:06:52] he was born amidst his brothers hated of
[1:06:55] his Brethren but loved of his
[1:06:58] father Joseph amen we know Joseph was
[1:07:02] born a Seer he was spiritual he was
[1:07:05] chosen of God he was all of these things
[1:07:08] he was a perfect type of Christ amen and
[1:07:11] he was predestinated to be on the throne
[1:07:14] he was predestinated to be on the throne
[1:07:17] I want you to hear me for a minute
[1:07:19] before he was ever
[1:07:21] there before he was ever there he he was
[1:07:26] already predestinated to be there
[1:07:29] exactly like David David was a boy under
[1:07:33] the house of Jesse and he was anointed
[1:07:35] to be king by the prophet Samuel brother
[1:07:39] it was years before David was king in
[1:07:41] Israel but he was anointed to be king
[1:07:45] over Israel you say preacher why wasn't
[1:07:48] David immediately a king in Israel
[1:07:51] because God was going to prepare
[1:07:54] David God had to humiliate David God had
[1:07:57] to get David to die out a little bit he
[1:08:00] was predestinated the whole
[1:08:03] time but yet he had to get training to
[1:08:06] be king over Israel amen y'all know
[1:08:09] exactly what I'm saying tonight he was
[1:08:12] predestinated the whole time but yet he
[1:08:15] had to be prepared to be king in Israel
[1:08:19] amen I think Joseph is so powerful God
[1:08:22] had a plan for Joseph's life
[1:08:25] did he not amen it's so beautiful
[1:08:28] because Joseph didn't know God's plan
[1:08:30] for his life but God knew his plan for
[1:08:33] his life hallelujah amen Joseph did not
[1:08:37] know God's plan but God knew God's plan
[1:08:40] and he knew no matter what happens to
[1:08:43] you Joseph the end has already been
[1:08:46] spoken from the
[1:08:49] beginning Joseph if you could only see
[1:08:52] right now where you're go where this hit
[1:08:55] me today I didn't know what to do Joseph

[1:09:03] him in there and they're going back to
[1:09:05] tell his father that Joseph is dead and
[1:09:08] he ain't here and he's down there in the
[1:09:10] pit say what did I do to deserve this
[1:09:13] I've done nothing wrong I've done
[1:09:16] nothing wrong and he's setting here
[1:09:19] looking up saying Jehovah what what is
[1:09:22] going on
[1:09:23] brother if God could have came down to
[1:09:26] him and said Jo I would have like to
[1:09:29] talk to Joseph brother sister and said
[1:09:31] listen Joseph one day you're going to be
[1:09:34] on the right hand of

[1:12:07] humiliating wouldn't sure it would be
[1:12:10] Amen brother it was humiliation after

[1:15:38] living in him
[1:15:42] God there was still too much Joseph
[1:15:45] living in him he said you got to go back
[1:15:48] down to the prison for a little bit

[1:16:11] them was life a perfect type of Christ
[1:16:14] the two thieves on the cross one eternal
[1:16:17] life and Paradise and the other one was
[1:16:20] condemned it's exactly the truth and he

[1:16:25] Joseph here in prison and brother it was
[1:16:29] all the plan of God hallelujah it was
[1:16:33] all the plan of God and then there's a
