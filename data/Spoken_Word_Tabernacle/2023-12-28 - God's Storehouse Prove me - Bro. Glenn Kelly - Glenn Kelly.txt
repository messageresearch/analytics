everybody is getting healed amen it's good to have brother Mickey back and it's good to have uh brother Steven on the female version back sister Sharon is back amen Glory Glory Hallelujah are you still feasting on Sunday's sermon amen wonderful powerful glorious sermon amen The Duality of the word of God Amen The Duality with Jesus Christ The Duality with brother brandham now The Duality for you and me people need to see Jesus reflecting through US amen when I woke up this morning I open my bible and I fell in U Psalm 67 and I was reading and it looks like I saw something new this Bible keep changing every day amen I'm going to just read couple of them the Bible says maybe three of them let the people praise thee Oh God let all the people praise the then after the Praises shall the Earth yield her increase and God even our own God shall bless us praise am Praise Him you praise him you praise him then as you praising him amen the Earth whatever you have will begin to grow and God even your own God will bless you amen and the Bible says God shall bless bless us and all the ends of the Earth shall fear him so one way for the fear of the Lord to be upon the people is the way God is blessing you I'm reading the Bible it's in Psalm 67 verse uh five all the way to verse 7 the way God blesses you he brings the fear of the Lord upon the people then the people knows that these people that we call Brat even though we are not brat by those people God is blessing them we can see the power of God in their life and the people begin to respect God because of the way God is dealing with you because there is a duality of the word amen when the people see you they begin to wonder where they you either Jesus or not yes we are Messiah we are Jesus in the female version amen so don't forget your Praises when you praise when you praise the God your God will bless you amen remember on Sunday we got two services for the entire year we got two Services one service in the morning normal regular then on the evening we start our service at 8:00 pm. so you have plenty of time to go rest and come back so Worship the Lord this year has been a lot but by God's grace we're going into 2024 if the Lord doesn't come back yet then let's enter worshiping him with the Lord's Supper praising him and then thanking him for everything that he have done and his protection throughout the year is many things that have been happening but the Lord has been gracious unto each one of us amen I'm not preaching tonight it's almost like a week now I'm getting a break from

Jesus we thank you Lord God for just another opportunity to come in thy house and in thy presence Lord Jesus we thank you Lord God for touching the pastor's heart Lord God for just giving us a great opportunity Lord God it's not by power it's not by might but it's by your holy spirit says the Lord so father we ask you Lord God to bless those that are streaming and those that had a desire to be here was not able to be here on tonight Lord God but bless them wherever they are Lord God strengthen them Lord God touch their bodies Lord Jesus we already claiming the healings of those Lord God because your word does not go out void father so we thank you Lord God on this evening Lord Jesus and we bind up every demon force in the name of Jesus Christ we claiming Victory Lord God we claiming testimonies already Lord Jesus so we thank you in Jesus name we pray amen and amen we won't prolong the time we ask you to turn to your Bibles two passages of scriptures I tell you one of them was the uh Matthew 28:18 um that um the brother was singing a song and Matthew 2818 and once you have it and say amen and y'all pray with us by the grace of God the enemy trying but we're not claiming anything by the grace of God we know that the weather's back and forth but we'll see what the word that God give us tonight it's going to definitely set somebody free it's going to grant grant someone Deliverance someone will get their healing is that right because this is the hour is that right this is the hour for us to put our God on display this is the hour now we testing him is that right he's put it in US is that right we are co-workers wear HS with him isn't that what the word said Sunday morning Hallelujah the Lord is good Matthew 2818 once you have it say amen and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth and we ask you now to turn to Malachi chapter 3 and then you may be seated after this one by the grace of God we just saw these couple scriptures and we'll let him have his way by the grace of God and see which way God wants to go uh Malachi chter 3 verse 10 it says bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse don't worry I'm not preaching on tithes y' don't have to get nervous is that right I leave that to the pastor I don't want to get in trouble he say that there may be meat in my house and do what prove me now here is sayith the Lord of hosts if I will not open the windows of what heaven he says and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word see if you don't even pay your tithes right there you're cutting yourself out of the windows of heavens of blessing because the one that said prove me you can he cannot go wrong is that right the one that said prove me he will bring it to pass the one that said prove me is the almighty God he's a great God he's the god that we serve he's a miraculous God is that right we're going to keep our God up here is that right he's a big God he created the heavens and the Earth is that right come on Saints Hallelujah he's in trouble help me Lord I want to read something to you this where got the inspiration out of God help me he said and uh it was a message God help me it was say it said be not afraid 41461 you know so I'm might I'll call them out and uh you got to write them down okay and keep up with me he says he says now gracious father he said the hour has arrived that when we must bring his word to a showdown ah huh you don't have to back off of no devil no demons no sickness is that right help me Lord he said we must bring God to a test see you're bringing God to a test Hallelujah so now it's no longer on God it's on us is that right God's putting it on us he said now we got to bring he says bring God to a test as it is written in the Book of Malachi say the Lord prove me say God what a challenge said what a challenge look at what brother Brandon was saying it what a challenge prove me it is written that we should prove all things is that that and we read in the Bible that it is written that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and that he promised the church that what he did they would do after him oh my he says we are told by the prophets that there would be a day that would not be day nor night will be called neither a dismay but a dismay but in the evening time it shall be what light you see that Rise and Shine for the light have come is that right we come in this hour he said it's not just darkness but it's gross Darkness that's on the people and we got the answer for the Devils what he's putting on the people people is that right we are the ones that now have to move forward and let them know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever because his word cannot fail is that right so we're talking about now is that God is saying prove me is that right huh in the storehouse uh let's look at the storehouse this Storehouse is wide open I won't be able to get into all this on a Wednesday night night maybe the pastor or one of these ministering Brothers to pick it up some just look at the storehouse but it was working with that daily bread when the lord gave you that Daily Bread the storehouse just kept touching me and touching me and touching my spirit so we want you to look at this here A Storehouse we're turning around first let's look at Webster Webster say it's a building for storing goods and abundant supplies is that right uhoh come on there's only one Storehouse right now is that right let me keep going he said now let's look at the Hebrew definition of it he says it's a house it's a home of what of royalty uh-huh it's a palace of deity huh it's the it's a temple is that right so we're talking about now so he not saying you just a d we are the what the temple of God is that right and inside of us God planted a seed when before the foundation of the world is that right so this Temple though consists of three portions is that right Body Spirit and soul is that right so we know the seed takes fi smell and here was given to us just to contact the Earthly thing is that right and so many people get thrown off when they get to the spiritual realm is that right they sitting up there and with the religious demons is that right but we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers in wickedness in rulers in high places is that right but God did what he's given us the word to do what cast down every demon cast down every imagination and try to exalt itself against the word of God so so many Believers get thrown off or believe that they're there because they still move to the spiritual real the imagination memory reasoning conscience and affection is that right but you're not there yet is that right come on now we still moveing three stages of Grace uh but down inside God's giv us a what a soul is that right and down in that soul is either Faith or is either death out but we got the faith seed the Abraham seed the Royal seed that God put it there Hallelujah we getting somewhere God help us we're talking about when God sent us out on a mission we're talking about the storehouse the storehouse is the word of God and when you go in that Storehouse you go into the word everything you need is where at in the word is that right in the beginning was the word the Word was God the word was with God and the Word was what made F flesh and it dwelt among us is that right we're going to get somewhere you just bear with us we got a lot of reading but that's okay it's the end of the year is that right you come to hear the word you didn't come to hear me is that right you want to hear from Christ we want to get into the word so we can grow that's why he said he said prove me now it's time to come on up hither is that right we about to come out of here Saints it should be no sickness it's power in the Church of God God gave us power and authority in his church is that right is what you speak if something if the devil come at you the prophet of God said it's your attitude how you receive it when the devil come at you you know what I Know The Enemy tried to come at this flesh here but you know what I wasn't claiming nothing is that right because the Bible say in the storehouse with his stripes I'm already healed is that right come on Saints we're claiming nothing we're moving into a new year Saints huh hallelujah look what he says he says now let's turn to uh Matthew I mean uh Numbers 22 help me Lord numbers 23 and see what we got if that's the one we got down there that's okay numbers 13 when God send us out on a mission then God his if God send you on something you should be rejoicing already because God because God cannot fail is that right God cannot fail is that right he will not fail us so you take it and you rejoice look what happened with the spies here I know you're familiar with the story here but I just just want to read the first three verses this what kind of pricked my heart when I got in and looked at this today so y'all pray with me I'm just looking at it he says and the Lord spake un Moses now who spake un Moses so Moses didn't send them out is that right huh no way Moses didn't send you out Moses didn't send you out God sent you out God sold you God picked you God was the one that told you so if God chose you once you get in your position you know you're Victorious you cannot [Applause] fail hallelu he said the Lord spake unto Moses he said saying he said send th men that that they may what search the land which I give unto who children of is the children of is Israel how many 12 of them went out is that right God sent them out 12 is worship it should have been worshiping it should have been praising and just the praise would have killed the enemy Hallelujah he said now look he said give unto the children of Israel he says of what every tribe he said what their fathers shall ye send a what a man everyone a What ruler among them so wait a minute now huh yes sir this was the leaders huh sir this was the leaders huh the leaders huh the leaders telling them we don't need the seals the leaders telling them we don't need the Thunders it's the leaders you bring back a testimony like that huh you kill the people's faith is that right huh when the prophet of God he said I'll send an angel before you is that [Applause] right tell me about babysitting nothing you're in a war oh I've been waiting for this war buddy huh God made us for this is that right he made us for this we will not fail because God send us out he said now you look the leaders look what he said yes causing all the fuss huh telling them a man don't need the ages tell them a man don't need to S I got something else I want to read God help me thank you Hallelujah he said now look the Lord is so good to us get around in there yes he telling them in this age because he told us we got to come up hither uhhuh and if he don't come up hither God help me get this if he don't come up hither then how you going to get ready we going to read something on here tonight look what he said he said now the E the exposition of the seven Church ages Le theia age he said now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelations 107 he says going to do two things he said one is is according he says according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the father he said the second thing he will reveal the Mysteries he will reveal the mysteries of the seven Thunders he says in Revelations 10 which are the Revelation containing in the seven Cals it will be these Divine revealed mystery truth see that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal father huh I don't fuss you don't have to fuss he does it we don't have to prove anything why do I have to fuss about him why do I have to identify him huh he identified that's not his picture that's not Brother brandom's picture that's god's picture and God invited him in the picture huh help me Lord he said look he said and the numbers 3 133 he said and Moses by command by commandment of the Lord sir sent them from the Wilderness of Pon and all those men were heads of the children of what huh I let y'all read tonight uhhuh look what he said all of these heads is that right coming in here now and they trying to share the people instead of coming in love is that right you're trying to make the person that's right look like he's wrong we not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and wickedness and rulers in high places the Bible says it'll be so close what it will deceive the very elect if it was possible it's like you and me shooting he got the rifle and I got the rifle is that right same rifle but the difference is one just got the word and one got the word in the spirit feed on it we're Waring against Satan that's who it is his kingdom look what he says he said turn over to Exodus 22 help me Lord I just got to catch it while it comes Hallelujah he said look Exodus 23 and let's look at verse 20 Exodus 23 and let's look at verse 20 yes sir he said behold I send what an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have what prepared is that right the Holy Spirit anointing the angel to servant of God what we say something let me keep reading now there was two there he said now look so they can prepare I have prepared it said verse 21 beware of him and do what obey his voice provoke broke him not he say and said for he will not what pardon your transgressions for what my name is in him huh he said but if thou shall indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be a what enemy unto thy enemies and an adversary unto thy adversary you see what he saying hallelujah this obedience brings you a consequence huh obedience brings you a blessing and in our time it brings you the Holy Ghost h Huh you struggling to come here you ain't doing us no favor you need to ask God to help you is that right ask God to help you we know a lady there when she's in Pentecost she's old lady brother stepen she hit the door she came like this huh she was already knowing she was going to get her blessing huh huh when you come through the door you should be rejoicing is that right thanking the lord already lifting his name up on high huh Hallelujah help me Lord look what we said we had transgressions he said verse 23 for my angel shall go before thee and bring thee into the amorites and the Hittites the perizzites Canaanites the HIIT the jebusites and I will do what cut them off is that right there's no sicknesses no diseases nothing should come thy way is that right they all talking about and some of them out there the Lord told us do not the way of the Heathen is that right how many of them you see out there supposed to be message Believers and celebrating Christmas you thought you was going to get away didn't you the Holy Ghost brought it fresh huh huh prophet of God said give the children little children gifts he said don't cold turkey them is that

brother Bram used that scripture he said in div time that God spoke to many is that right that mean anyone even that says someone up under the Muslim belief could been saved so those wise men were moans is that right meting Persians they were Muslims is that right so Daniel while he was down there he had to worship and hide his own his God that he was serving is that right he told him about that star and that star just didn't represent anything he said when you see a particular star he said that's the Royal that's a Royal Star there brother bam said they see stars and they think it's some kind of light with five Sid he said no that's another world that you're looking at it's another world we come from is that right yes sir look what he said huh he said now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod he said behold there were came wise men from the East to what to Jerusalem he said now saying where is he that is born King of the Jews yes sir see you got to get around in there he didn't say the prophet of God didn't say they was just coming in he said what shook him up was the testimony he said when they came where is the king of the Jews uh we know he's here where is the king of the Jews we know he's here it was testifying that's right we know that he's here yes sir said the star disappeared that's and they knew why did it go to Jerusalem because it was the religious capital of the world at that time it was religious cap and they were supposed to know that where is he born King of the Jews amen what he said you think they happy to see our Lord you think this religious World happy to see our God you think they out there celebrating huh uhuh no sir uhuh no no sir nah nah uh-uh he said now you look he said say where is he that born King of the Jews uhhuh for we have seen what star his star where in the East and are come to do what worship him he said when heroy the king had heard these things he was what troubled he was troubled with all Jerusalem what with him why was he troubl because he wasn't just the only heroid he was about the fourth heroid uh and his kingdom was about to be tore down and why do some of y'all get nervous in here because it was a TR ition getting ready to be torn down it's there a tradition you keep playing in here and see what happen God's going to unfold your tradition you either leave out of here better or you leave out of here worse his tradition get getting ready to get tore down is that right yes my brother hero was trouble now buddy that's right huh that's exactly right brother the real King yes sir the real king King was about to be born he said now look when heroid the king had heard these things he was troubled in verse uh four and when he had gathered all the chief priests uhuh and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where Christ should be born is that right yes sir now he got all the religious leaders sir he said but now he says and they said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the what the prophet he said now you got to always remember they're going to always come down you got issues with the prophet okay let them keep going is that right because it's going to find out sooner or later who's who is that right you cannot take them out of the picture you cannot the message and the messenger is one and any way you try to take we can rightfully divide we know who he is we know who William Mar and brandom is we know he was the prophet of God that sent in Leo the sea he was the Covenant messenger that God brought in to tie in the Loose Ends is that right we recognize these things Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelations 107 Revelations 19 let them come on and follow the scriptures you know when I'm in there there dealing with the inmates in the prisons you know what I do I first I keep showing them a prophet keep showing them the office of a prophet I show him the office of a prophet I show him the office of a prophet I keep

yes look what he says help me Lord thank you Jesus thank you Lord thank you Jesus where we have help me Lord God he says look these sign what he says a good Christian a thoroughbread Christian knows where the storehouse of God is is that right when the devil came at Jesus is that right not because Matthew 4 he said for what he came at him what Pastor cuz he was hungry is that right he knew the pattern he knew the pattern of the flesh he said because if thou be the Christ what turn these Stones unto what bread is that right Jesus went I tell you what turn to Luke for hallelujah hallelujah Luke I Luke 12 thank you Jesus let see Luke 12 thank you Lord God we're talking about we're about to wind it up bear with me Luke 12 he says uh is that what it said was it Luke no I'm sorry Luke 4 I think I got the other Luke 4 thank you Jesus look what he says he's going in the storehouse we're talking about the storehouse he says now look we know when the and Jesus being full of the what Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness see you got to be led there by the spirit that's why you just can't speak the word you could speak it yeah it be you speaking it ain't the Holy Spirit speaking through you speaking it huh that's why it don't come to pass and then you got around that's why he said when understanding come understanding is what the Lord taught us is revelation when the Revelation come where there's no vision the people what perish where there's no Revelation the people what perish is that right look what he says he went into the storehouse he said being 40 days tempted of the devil and in those days he did what he did eating nothing and when they had entered he he afterward was what hry hungry see he said now the devil said unto him if thou be the what Son of God can can command these stones that it be made what bread is that right he says and Jesus answered him saying it is what written that man should not live by what bread and long but by what every word of God is that right and we know that I want to just show you went into the storehouse is that right but to go to the storehouse we know now that Storehouse is being we at in Christ but one more scripture come to me go to Ephesians he went to the word he went to the storehouse is that right you got to understand in this hour here and now Ephesians is parallel to Joshua is that right Ephesians let's look at six cut it short here Ephesians 6 once you say Amen when you got it he said now look Ephesians 6 and 4 now this is what the prophet of God was working with he was trying to show them and bring them in this end time is that right you had to store up because remember he had a dream and in that dream then he didn't understand it at first he said in that dream he started packing lettuce and and cauliflower and all those things in the dream he was telling you had to store up he had to store up in the storehouse but he was telling them in that dream that you know he had to go he said but they go that he said but the boat that he had to go in he said but they love you so they'll get in a little what canoe is that right and they'll die right because he had not got that from the seals yet he had not given yet so he had a dream is that right and when he got in there this is the scripture that he used he said then after he came back I'm going to read it in a minute help me Lord he said there when he came there he was showing him in that dream there what he was really showing him that he had to store up the word and the only Storehouse is was the only Storehouse in America was there at the time except for their Brethren that's why some of you misinterpret it is because we won't do certain things we won't go certain places it's not that we're against the brethren we pray for the brethren we always go there and well in in in Fellowship but you got to understand we wrestle not against flesh and blood but it's principalities and powers and wickedness and rulers in all places so he was telling them in that dream that you was going to have to put on the whole armor of God amen amen look what he was saying you got to store it up Saints because before the pressure come yes sir because the pressure's coming you think we're just telling you come in the question and answers questions and answers is for you it's for us is that right wait until we get on the other side the way he sacrifice the way these brothers sacrifice the way some of the Saints sacrifice if you can't come in there don't let your child suffer call me up I'll come pick them up and come get them and take them home don't let them suffer is that right especially these third Generations you don't know because this is our messenger he's telling us he says store it up you're going to need it amen Amen in the storehouse amen look what he says he say finally my brethren yes sir be strong in the Lord he says and in the power of what his might he said put on the what whole armor of God Lord help me let me see if I can find find that one here cuz he said a lot in that I want you to see exactly what he said God help me he said now Lord Lord how hallelujah thank
