time the [Music] but all through the blood [Music] come true [Music] let's give him another card hallelujah hey man hallelujah can y'all stand with me just a minute i'm trying to do a little bit here off of memory um first off we want to um we want to report that sister jean is a combo right she's doing better she's been in the hospital for her heart okay and as far as i'm gathering from the information i guess she had fluid on the lungs that's gone um the you know she's she's breathing well um so it's it's an improvement we do want to add her to our prayer list when we get there but she is improving amen so we need to give god glory for that and just ask him to continue to bless amen praise the lord hallelujah brother maurice's mother is home amen that's good as well hallelujah hey man and brother greg has been reporting on um brother danny from the philippines his wife um sister isabe isabelle um help me out here brother i'm that's right it was ovaries yes and they were everybody was recommending surgery all the doctors that had seen her and they i think she showed up for the procedure is that right and they took one more lurk and they look and they said there's no reason that it's not there amen hallelujah so god is working he's working in our midst now we sang as we sang a little bit here about feeling better i feel better since i've laid my well a physical infirmity is a burden lay it down this morning amen one of the other songs said that we're free now we're free from those burdens we're climbing higher each day and we say goodbye to the sin and the things that confound so i'm not doubting anybody here does not have the holy ghost but i'm looking for a fresh experience every time we meet and usually he meets it right he's an on-time god and he meets it so anybody else have a praise report about anything before we go into the prayer request yes sir brother robert amen praise the lord amen hallelujah hallelujah anyone else before we move into the prayer request yes ma'am okay great i did hear brother daley say that that's good we'll keep him on the prayer list as well amen praise the lord um let's remember as we go into the prayer requests let's remember brother nikki charnick again he he sends a daily devotion and he had not done it for a few days and when he came back it's i think it's starting to sink in a little bit with him and he's and he's he's um it's it was a very emotional 15 minute um devotion that he that he shared with us um i don't know i don't know if there were any other siblings beside his sister that was taken in the accident um i don't know does anybody else know yeah those those were taken but i don't know if he has a a surviving sister that was her brother because he's yeah because his dad you know his dad surviving that and that um so his work's not finished let's remember the family amen and let's um but it was just very emotional it was a little bit heartbreaking you know um what he sent and uh very very desperate so let's remember the charnock family let's remember sister jean and and your family your family sister divine um [Music] wow uh well we probably believe that the god knows who she is amen and sure he can just to prove that everybody's word wrong because his is the only word that's right amen and there's no there's no request too big for him you know there's nothing too big he likes the big ones because because it just glorifies him more um so let's remember um jermaine still amen does anybody have any more prayer requests that they'd like to speak out before [Music] brother elijah do you mind coming up and praying over these let's remember each other there's still a lot of scary things going on you know and we want to keep each other strong in the faith in the word in fellowship and in love most of all amen and uh i get excited when i get to come over here because i get to see everybody and it just thrills my heart um to just see you because i know jesus lives in you and i and i need that i need to see that so god bless you my brother [Music] brother john said it jesus lives here without being said let us pray dear heavenly father we come to your throne of mercy this morning oh god with so many requests your children brings your request in the church because they believe in your god they believe you are able or god to touch their body and they

come on up my brother hey man [Applause] god bless you sings um the nerves need to go great um i remember it was around two months ago i was sleeping and i just woke up but i couldn't move my body the only thing i could move was my eyes so i thought it was sleep paralysis so i just let each other then after a while i still couldn't move i seen a dark black figure come over me and started choking me trying to take the breath out of me like i was panicking but i still couldn't move i was panicking in my head and i was saying i like i was just screaming and none of that worked till i started screaming jesus i just started saying jesus jesus jesus till i came down and that dark figure that was in my room with me just vanished and he left and lately i've been struggling and it's like i've been looking for god through other things and other people except going exactly to god and like through that i kept getting reminders that god kept on sending me signs and reminders that he's always there with me like and i remember the like the thing that shocked me the most like i went to this restaurant um tuesday and it said i don't know why the scripture spoke to me like it was like a poster on the side i didn't even see them when i went in i came back to get my food and they said i will lift the lift up my nights that i hails from with my help i don't know why that spoke to me that much but it did so i just hope this song is a blessing to y'all be [Music] i will lift up my eyes to the hills from which cometh my hell my help cometh from the lord [Music] the lord which made heaven and earth he said he will not suffer thy foot die for to be moved the lord that keeps [Music] oh the lord is thy keeper the lord is not the moon by night he shall preserve my soul even forever [Music] my [Music] the lord my help [Music] i love my [Music] from amen i this is a very special young man here i believe it and god is continuingly using him let's stand this morning we will invite our pastor

possible [Music] all things are amen let's grab our hand for the lord amen hallelujah we bless the lord for sister gene she's online she even say amen so she's in the hospital streaming and being in the service with us yeah she went to the hospital with swollen legs by the grace of god everything the fluid was taken out the legs are fine her heart is breathing pretty good there is no nothing no fluid in the lungs the doctor are trying to figure out what to do because it seems like she is responding pretty good the doctor might be astonished about what is happening but we know who got stuff in control amen we have a living god i told her i say even if you get tired i'm not going to back up we need to pray until she's out of the hospital and back again in home amen praise the name of the lord if you would let's go to joshua chapter 10. last sunday we speak about the signet and there is more to that signet the lord's willing we're going to dig again into that signal this is not the time to rush like i was telling my wife i say we heard sermon 45 minute that stop to speak about the third pool after 20 years we don't even know what it means amen we don't want to do that again let's take our time dig dig dig until the coming of the lord amen i watched brother kelly on wednesday he was preaching he started his subject and he took off his subject and began to go into a different channel and maybe you were there you say wait a minute he said he's going to preach about this but why is he going this direction you need to be spiritual there was a lady that came that was sitting back there in pence that lady came she lives in texas she came in here she's a trainer to transform people down in gastonia and she was living in this hotel here and she came downstairs and attended the service and at the end of the services she requested if we know a message church in texas how she can attend it amen you see what happened so it was not brother kelly was the lord deviating by the kelly so that he can catch a soul for the kingdom of the lord amen let's not give the lord a big club for him amen you need to be sensitive to the holy spirit joshua chapter 10 if you dare you can say amen [Music] if you look above chapter 10 you have chapter 9 verse 27 everybody see that okay let me just read that so we start chapter 10 verse 27 of chapter 9 which is the last verse of the uh ninth chapter before you start verse 10 or chapter 10. the bible say and joshua made them he's speaking about the gibeona they deceived joshua because they were afraid and because of that the children of israel made a covenant with them and there was no way to destroy them so that was one of them that escaped amen if you read in another chapter you'll find out that the bible the lord says that among all the people of the land of canaan the only people that made peace with israel was the gibeonite and the bible says that all the other one god let them recruit themselves pack themselves to come against israel so that the lord can destroy them so when somebody is packing gathering against you don't even worry it is the lord putting them together so he can deal with them one time amen so this is the only one that escaped but when they escape joshua i signed them to a special task in israel amen verse 27 and joshua made them that day viewers of wood they were working with wood praise the name of the lord and joys of water for the congregation so they became worker in the congregation they were gibeonide gentile outside but they got through israel almost like jacob getting the blessing by deception and for some reason when they enter in god assigned them a task to the congregation and the tabernacle for the congregation and for the altar of the lord even to this day in the place which he should choose chapter 10 now when all the other people heard that the city of gibeon which is a big city took a peace or may the peace with israel they got upset so they packed together to attack gibeon and to destroy him in other words you became friend with israel we're going to wipe you up verse 4 came up to me verse 4 yes came up to me and helped me that we must smite gibeon for he has made peace with joshua and with the children of israel you might be saying that therefore the five kings of the amurat the king of jerusalem you remember jerusalem his father was an amorite it's right there the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of jarmoth the king of lakeish the king of england gathered themselves together and went up they and all their hosts and in camp before gibeon and made war against it and the man of gibeon sent to joshua to the camp of gilga saying slack not your hand from your servant now we are not gentile we are servants come up to us quickly and save us and help us for all the kings of the amorites that dwell in the mountain are gathered together against us so joshua ascended from gilgal now he's defending no more gentiles he and all the people of war with him and all the mighty men of valor watch verse 8 and the lord said to joshua fear them not for i have delivered them into your hand they shall not a man of them stand before you so in other words joshua now is working under the command of god i want you to keep that it is no longer just you are working it is no longer joshua attacking now it seems like it's joshua but the one who is attacking now is the lord joshua now is positioned in the line of duty are you following me amen verse 9 joshua therefore came to them suddenly and went up from gilgal all night and joshua disconfited them you need to wake up the lord are you there you see joshua moving but it's not joshua it is the lord who's moving that's why david said he teaches my hand to fight you see david fighting it's not david fighting it is the lord fighting through desert are you there you need to be able to discern the spirit that is working amen and the lord disconfided them before israel and threw them with a great slaughter that's good brother david afghan gibeon and chased them along the way that goes up to bed horn and smoth them to a zika and to make them so joshua felt the anointing of god he felt that this is the lord working amen and he came to pass as they fled from before israel and where in the going down to bed horn that the lord cast down great stone are you there from heaven upon them to azika and they died there were more which died with hair stone in other words there were more which died without the hand of a man because in the battle israel was fighting but it was not israel it was the lord but those that died without your effort was more are you there i made an application they gave me a job i made it i made i i made it is the lord who gave you the job now you don't make an application but they call you that's a different story are you there more which die with hailstone than they whom the children of israel flew with the sword powerless are you there without your work without your input then spoke joshua to the lord in that day in the day when the lord delivered the map the amorite before the children of israel and he said in the sight of israel son so joshua is fighting joshua felt the anointing of god joshua saw the presence of the lord working already in his life are you there the lungs that were filled with fluid are no longer having fluid sister dean they fit our soul and are no longer stolen so when joshua understood that the lord is in this thing he took advantage of the anointing are you there he didn't wait for the lord to talk to him again as long as the lord is moving joshua turn around and look at the sun he said i need more time i don't have to ask for the lord anymore he just spoke the word are you there when you see lord moving in your life you don't need to pray anymore you don't need to bow on your knees anymore you need to speak the word because you are in the line of duty the anointing of the third pool you need to understand how you operate [Music] amen hallelujah verse 12 and then joshua spoke to the lord in the day when the lord delivered the amorite before the children of israel and he said in the sight of israel son i thought he was talking to the lord right he said son [Music] still stand you still upon gibeon and you moon in the valley of agelom and stayed until the people have avenged themselves upon the enemy until they were satisfied that now it's okay we finished then the sun continued in the old atonement in the blood of bulls and goats [Applause] without the blood of jesus christ amen and the son stood still and the moon stayed until the people have arranged themselves upon their enemies it is not this written in the book of jesus so the sun stood still in the midst of heaven and hasted not in other words delayed to go down about a whole day somebody changed the calendar and there was no day like that before or after it so from joshua all the way to the end time are you there the first one who broke that circle was jesus are you there and then after jesus there was not a day after it until the end time when gay men can speak to the storm jesus spoke to the wind he broke that are you there but the ministry of alpha is the ministry of omega so when he come down with the second step he's gonna break again and speak to nature [Applause] let me help you up the bible says there was no one who was as wise as solomon even before him or after him right jesus came he said here there is greater than solomon [Applause] and when brother branham came he said there is greater than all of them hallelujah there was no day like that before it ever after it that the lord hearken to the voice of who for the lord fought for who so once you recognize the anointing take advantage of it everybody clear let's go again to jeremiah 29 we read it last week jeremiah 29 verse 11. i don't know how far i would go but there is more to the sickness that i thought amen for i know the thoughts that i think towards you say the lord thought of what so we have the right to be in peace are you there we have the right to be in peace everywhere we are whether in our home in our job in our car we must be in peace because he is jehovah's shalom brother branham which shalom are you there verse 11 and not of evil so when you see an evil thought you know where it's coming from it is not coming from the lord are you there to give you an expected end in other words a hopeful end so the purpose of god in your life is not to do you harm even if he whips you it is to do you good at the end your result will be better if the lord moves you from a job he must have a better job than that amen amen praise the name of the lord do you know that sarah has a body and the first body that said i have was what barren are you there but when the lord gave sarah a new body that body was no longer bearing but could produce a child when god moved sarah from an old body to a new one he was better than the first one the glorified body is better than this one you don't go like this you keep going like that pyramid amen then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray to me and i will hearken to you just like joshua and you sh you're sick man found me when you search for me with all your last one mark chapter seven so on joshua we understood the line of duty mark chapter 7. if you're there you can say amen verse 25 very familiar story we took the roman centurion last week when he spoke jesus called that greater faith so his word where faith expressed he spoke but jesus called that expression faith so the right saying that came from the mouth of the roman centurion where faith verse 25 for a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him we know that woman and came and fell at what just like esther we want to go back to western amen the woman was a greek gentile a south phoenician by nation not a jew so we're dealing with a different category here and she besought she begged like esther she begged him that he would cut forth the devil out of her daughter but jesus said to her let the children the jews first be filled let them be satisfied first for it is not meat it is not fitting to take the children bread and to cast it to the dogs if you have your child and you have a dog outside you must let your child eat first when they are full then whatever is left you're going to give it to the dog it's clear and she answered and said to him yes lord in either way you are right because every word that proceed the fact of jesus christ is correct from the devil it's alive are you there yet the dog under the table eat off the children's crumb we already talked about it verse 29 and he said to her for this what because of what you just spoke you must say the right thing when the roman centurion said the right thing they call it faith are you there oh my gosh i don't know what's going to happen don't do that don't do that oh my god my husband is coming he's going to kill me don't do that for this saying go your way the devil is gone out of your did jesus go and lay hands on him did jesus pray did jesus fast put your car in neutral let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your anointing this morning which is your presence lord thank you for your grace thank you for your love thank you for your mercy thank you for giving us another opportunity to gather together around the real world father may you speak to our soul this morning and not only speak but may you heal may you feel may you satisfy may you bring lord father result or solution where it's needed lord father may you move me completely out of the way the lord father you come in the power of your resurrection lord we are committing this service unto the hand we are selling the devil out of this place with the coronavirus or whatever it is lord every spirit of slumping or sleepiness or being tired lord being weary we rebuke them away from this place in the name of jesus christ may your power come down lord and may you minister to your children as we committed all in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you you already been seated we are dealing still with the mystery of the two stairs everybody pretty good with what we preached last sunday if you miss it you're gonna be behind if you miss wednesday you're still gonna be behind when we talk about part six we describe to you that we are still dealing with the blessings or the benefits of judah because ruth was separated from the land of moab and taken into the land of judah but like we spoke god cannot move you from one place to another he always moves you to a better place are you there israel was in egypt in the land of canaan or um i'm sorry in the land of goshen and goshen was a pretty good land in egypt but the land of israel was far better than the land of goshen if you read deuteronomy chapter 6 chapter 7 chapter 8 you will see the description of the land of israel a land flowing with milk and what and god said that it is not like the land of egypt where you got to do irrigation to order your crop but in the land of judah god watches over that land god wanted that land 360 days so god when he moved roof from the land of moab all the way to the land of judah there was a benefit there was a purpose there was a reason why god have to take her all the way there and the first purpose we found out that it was the bread but before you understand when we are speaking about the land of judah here we are talking about our position our homeland our nation our country what is that country brother branham in the message gabriel instruction to daniel brother branham say hear me god save the lord so there is no game on that one god will not deal with his church till she comes back to what to the homeland what is the homeland the message of the hour are you there the message of the hour is our homeland that's why we are preaching the message because you must be positioned in the message amen come back to the world original that's the message get away from your methodists in other words come out come out presbyterian idea come out your pentecostal out assemblies oneness threeness and softness whatever it is church of god nazarene pilgrim of holiness church of christ all antichrist movement denomination is the work of the antichrist [Applause] god can never deal with you appropriately as you are still in denomination you must come out and stay in the homeland which is the message of the hour amen and i realized this struck the world because he's a messenger all wrong you are arrogant no all of them are wrong they used to be good in the past when it was the time but for today they are all round all of the devil because they become denomination they died oh my there is godly men in every one of them amen there is godly people in every one of them movement but the organization in itself is not of god that's why the voice said come out of him are people are you there you are a good person in baptist you must come out because the organization is a curse in itself it's not of god and god will never bless it he never has done it we must come back to the land of judah which is the message of the hour i am not gonna preach nothing else in this puppet but the message of malachi falls i don't have the message i was only commissioned to repeat what the messenger said [Applause] amen he was the one that was vindicated and i'm under his ministry i'm just going to repeat the dedicated message of the hour [Applause] if a preacher don't believe the message or struggle with the message this is not the pulpit amen we talk about the barley and the wheat we talk about the golden scepter we talk about the royal priesthood we're dealing with the signet and lord willing after that we're going to get the breast lead and the child because roof never had a child in moab her child came in the land of judah we dealt with those three already last week we started with the signet and once we finish the signet lord's willing today we're gonna go back to the bracelet but today it's part seven we are digging with the signal let's take esther chapter four we were in the book of esther amen praise the name of the lord we know esther taps what the brother and mother mordechai tap who brother branham sometimes we say the messenger the message brother pranam clear you come in this church you're going to listen to the bible and the message are you there esther we know taps the bride and we know that mordechai tapped the seven church edges messenger which is random and the signet was given to mordechai because according to the riding of zero babel the robber bear has to be made a signal in the right hand of god the power was invested into the rubber bell are you there now in esther chapter 4 verse 14 the bible says this we read this on wednesday if you dare you can say amen this is mordecai talking to esther he said for if you are together hold your peace in other words you must talk you must speak when the children of israel were going around jericho the first day they were forbidden to talk you remember that the second day they were forbidden to talk all the way to the seventh day on the seventh day they were commissioned to shout the power of the spoken word was given for the last stage and mordecai is saying something is happening to your family something is happening to us something is happening to the jews but you are quiet because everything is going good with you if you hold your peace if you don't talk if you don't stand for yourself that's your problem for if you hold your peace at this time then shall dare enlargement or relief and deliverance arise to the jews from another place but you and your father's house shall be destroyed and who knows whether you are come to the kingdom for such a time as this in other words you don't understand that the reason why you are in that position was for a special task of this time are you there the brother of joseph saw joseph but at the end joseph told them it was not you the lord saw that something was happening and the lord put me in this position in order to save the people so monaco is telling esther maybe you are in the position you are there because god predestinated you for a special task at a special time you were preserved by the preserver to stand for the faith [Music] are you there brother branham he said bless them god all the newborn babes that has just come to you are praying their tinder in the tender little way that they shall be fed with the sincere milk of the gospel because they are baby that they shall grow into the statues of who so there is a birth and there is a time you grow until you reach the statute of christ where your adoption takes place everybody clear that there might be his what not only brother branham are you there brother branham was an example to show you that this is where the lord is leading you to this level are you there praise the name of the lord but that there might be his mouthpiece and what to serve him in this great shadowing age that we are now living in the evening lots so the purpose of putting you in that position esther it is god wants you to be his mouth peace if you don't speak if you hurt your peace know that you're gonna get destroyed everybody clear granted father we ask this in jesus name amen in the exposition of the seven church ages why is zester placed into this position yes sir the church baptist methodist oneness fatherless twoness all of them that i just put together those church is no longer the mouthpiece of god they don't speak for god are you there it is its own math peace so god is turning on her on esther everybody there he will confront her through the prophet and the bread are you there he will confront her through mordechai and esther are you there god have appointed you for a special task because the church have rejected christ in the age of lord this year christ is on the outside no king tried to come back in so god turned to the prophet and to the bread everybody clear for the voice of god will be in who in esther yet it is for he says in the last chapter of revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say what what small the world will he direct from god ask at what but of course that word blood will be repediated as in the first age if they block you they don't want to talk to you don't worry about it forgetting what is behind let's move to the mark of the eye calling everybody clear now brother branham continued he said our power this is what we stopped last week in heaven and earth is given to my hand go and i shall go with you whatever you bind on earth i shall abandon heaven what you lose on earth i shall lose in heaven oh if the great holy church only relies its power to do these things but there is so much doubt and fear and trembling wondering if he will could it happen as long as that exists the church can never stand upright and when every talk of fear we cannot sit together and be talking about stuff that is that are gonna discourage you are you there don't be entertaining people that bring bad news people that bring you news to bring you fear are you there don't entertain them whether it's your home or through your telephone don't entertain them talk to me about my power talk to me about my benefit talk to me about my god talk to me about how big my god is above corona virus are you there people are looking at the election i'm not looking at the election i'm looking at god the election is not my solution my solution is in the lord whoever passes that's not my problem my eyes release the lord i lift up my eyes to the heel from where i got my help my help coming from the lord get your head off politics hallelujah hallelujah when every talk of fear is furnished and the holy spirit is completely in control of the church then all fear are gone and that church has what see why they have everything that have an aunt behind them they are ambassadors of the throne absolutely an ambassador of class has the what the signet and everything that crashed on belonged to that and he said go ye into all the world you are my witness after the holy ghost is come on you and what is a witness is an ambassador is to come to witness something the whole power of heaven is right in your hand oh why do we set and the church is what and we set how dormant like we are dreaming are you there people live in mediocrity and they are staying there and cope with it are you there my mama was like that no my mama died with that disease no [Applause] you are no longer the child of ella branham are you there why do we sit in the church is barren and we said to dorman it's because we don't recognize these things that's the reason why we are preaching them to you take hebrew chapter four hallelujah amen hallelujah hebrew chapter 4 verse 14 if you dare you can say amen seeing them that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the who the son of god we already have the high priest we are under that priesthood of melchizedek the royal priesthood of judah are you there passes all the heaven jesus the son of god let us hold what our that word profession means confession you must hold what you're speaking are you there for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmity but was in oh when there is nothing that can happen to you that jesus never experienced that's why the atonement is full because every single trouble you can have was represented in the atonement are you there if the temptation becomes greater just reach out to the atonement and say christ you are tempted in all things i believe you were tempted in what i'm going through right now i'm reaching out to the atonement in the name of jesus christ give me the victory instead of seeding and accepting things i just can't help it i just can't help it i just can't help it you must do that yourself not your pastor yourself are you there why father i try and try i can no no no no go back to the scripture take god at his word tempted in all points but in our point tempted like as we are so god was not tempted like he was a sum of uh angel or something just like you yet without sin let us therefore because of that come out not like esther esther came and began to cry to the king god said come badly to the throne of what [Music] that we may obtain what and find grace to help in the time of what in the time of trouble esther head only to god to the king take ephesians chapter 3 we are building i will soon leave the airport if you dare you can say amen you beat me on that one ephesians 3 verse 4 everybody there whereby when you read when you are reading what paul is saying you may understand my knowledge this is paul in the mystery of who paul is writing the letter he say i'm writing when you read what i'm writing i want you to understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ why do we need to understand that verse 5 which in other age that mystery was not made known to the sons of men as it is now revealed to the holy apostle that's the new testament and prophet by the way what is the mystery verse six that's there not the jews paul said i want you to understand the mystery and understand the depth of the mystery and that mystery was hidden from the edges and that mystery is that the gender should be fellow hair and of the same body like the gibuna [Music] partaker of his promise in christ by there do you understand verse seven wherefore i was made a minister according to the gift of grace of god given to me by the effectual working of his power job to verse nine and to make all men not only jews see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning is back again afterward has been hidden in god who created all things by jesus christ why god wants us to understand this mystery first of all the mystery tells you that you are no longer stranger because of christ there is a golden scepter and the god and scepter put you into the access of the god of israel you have as much right to talk to god just like david was talking to god are you there so why did god open this new way why did god tear the veil of the temple in two to bring the gentile into the commonwealth of israel what was the purpose of doing that verse 10 to the what in other words the intention of god the purpose of god for doing that is that to the intent that now the what principalities principalities and what everybody principality is in power to that intent that the principalities and power in heavenly places he didn't say heavenly places in christ are you there heavenly places in christ that's the believer position but he said heavenly places oh my god heavenly places might be known the intent that god has is that this demon principalities and power god wants to teach them something god wants those demons to know something but god needs a channel by which he's going to use god needs a scream the demon has seen god put a television and through that television he wants to express something television was with adam you remember the stuff to the intent that now the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by who so the screen of god or the tool god is using is the church he's using esther but through esther in a special time god wants to display something god has a special task he wants to teach the principalities and power a lesson but he needs an agent so he appointed esther to a position to teach hermione a lesson to the intent that now the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by who the manifold wisdom of what according to the eternal purpose which he purpose in in whom we have what an access with what by fair forward go to ephesians chapter six we are positioning then we take off the engine are already changing you know how the plane was like so i'm about to go are you there ephesians chapter 6 verse 12 for we were sin not against what and what but guess what look at your board today are you there god preserve you for a special task to deal with your enemy are you following me we're gonna teach you these things until you understand who you are you there we are not wrestling about expressing blood but guess what karma hey guess what look over there everybody clear power come out against what the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in what you understand how so god wants to teach your enemy a lesson are you there that's why he is positioning you a certain way and then like joshua he's gonna come down and when he comes down you need to remember that once the anointing struck you it is time to speak the word and to avenge yourself on your enemy until you are satisfied now into his church you that is positionally seated in heavenly places in what that's not heavenly places you got it now okay in christ jesus be what humble brethren someday the holy spirit the lord will speak to you call you out to one side somewhere in a little cabin or in the hillside or in what system right washroom somewhere and there will announce you you following me for a certain task service or a certain things to do it won't be delaying on hand of the presbyter or it won't be the laying of hand of pastors not preachers not evangelists none of them but somebody will lay hand on you are you there it will be delaying on the hand of who so god himself come down and lay hand in other words god will announce you are you there okay himself to put a what a new ministry in you and what adoption you see that not your birth but now it is your adoption it comes with an anointing and a robe you understand that and set you as what an example an order all the principalities and the powers you understand now the demons out of torment what do you understand it do you believe that do you believe that you can reach a place where no one in your home gets sick anymore [Applause] you see how our faith got weak you see how our faith got weak the bible says when israel left egypt when they were walking in the desert not even their shoe are you there not even their clothes 40 years worn clothes nothing happened if god can protect your clothes how much your body are you there 40 years those gloves were new their shoes were new under the blood of bulls and gold following a prophet but today we are following a prophet with the blood of jesus christ [Applause] when they say something like this ah so you're saying i'm going to be two years without getting sick how about israel [Music] we don't play church god grant my brethren that we shall each one receive this blessing are you there shall we pray take connection to after ephesians it's philippians after philippians collection colossians 2 verse 13 why do we need to teach them a lesson are you there amen colossians 2 verse 13 if you dare you can say amen and you being what in your sin and beyond circumcision of your flesh as he what they took you out now to the land of judah are you there quick and together with him having forgiven you or what so you are now clean verse 14 blubbing out the golden scepter because the ordinance said no more about should gather in the congregation when the scepter comes he goes above the law bloating out the handwriting of the ordinance that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out out of the way nailing it to what watch verse 15. you're there and having watched paul who look at your board look at your board so jesus in the alpha ministry he's asking you to do something that he did because over there he was god in flesh and whatever was in christ he poured that into the verse 15 and having spoiled who and who look at your board so what god is trying to do through you is not something new it is something he did himself you understand and when he was going to the cross we were in him [Music] when he died we died with him when we heard he went to hell we went to hell with him when he was we was again with him you were already represented in this fight all you have to do is put yourself in neutral and let that fight come back to you are you understanding you understanding he says has exposed principalities and what he made what a demonstration but now i'm not gonna do that demonstration myself i'm gonna do that demonstration through the church are you there esther maybe you are in that position because god wants to deal with you airmen was who m and d no yes i'm going to go there even the aggregate are you there are you there again comes from the word arga which was the king of alec you understand when god sent soul to kill the amalekite souls spare argon and samuel came and killed him but one of the seed escape do you understand so the burger that was done through crust at the cross making a public show god want to finish that brother with esther and heaven i understand they destroyed the air gag they chopped him in pieces by samuel but his side was still there by the second time of destruction it is no longer samuel it is esther it is no longer christ it is the church [Music] having spoiled principalities and power he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in what in the cross jesus display his power by attacking and destroying principalities and what este este este blessing of a son take him out in a certain place have a ceremony before angels and place him positionally what he is in the body of christ then that person has what let me say this if you call me a fanatic from this night on that very same thing that i'm speaking of will be done there shall be a put into the church i have to repeat this thing and now he's coming that the holy spirit will what so announce you remember that quote we just read so anointed the people till they shall do what and he shall what do you understand we have not seen power like that lights coming into the church now i know it for fact say unto this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said shall come to pass you can have what you have said the blessing after that power is with your adoption in position where the fullness of the power of the holy ghost coming to the what the critics what the principalities and the power the people that are anointed with them their mouth will be what it shall be a short term two days like yesterday take now esther seven now i already took off amen praise the name of the lord esther comes after nehemiah amen esther chapter seven if you dare you can say amen we know who emen is right who is eamon heyman he had a what enamel tapping who the right hand of the king lucifer the devil and we know the devil was incarnated in judah and god was incarnated in christ are you there heaven esther 7 verse 10 if you dare you can say amen the last verse of esther chapter 7 so they did what why they didn't kill him with a sword ah you got it where the caliber got it are you there are you there are you there why they didn't kill him with his sword why they didn't kill him with a spirit why he has to be killed by hand on the tree the right hand man of king ahazarez the devil himself when they are destroying him they destroy him by hanging him why did they hang him you see that's that's why i'm going 35 miles an hour because it's in the kid's zone are you there school zone they hang heaven on the gallow that he had prepared for mordecai then was the king's rough what so the hanging of heaven spoke about the hanging of judah because judah was the devil incarnated are you there and judah also hung himself you remember that judah judas right there hang himself thank you sister fifth i want to show you a little parable right quick a lot of people only see three crosses at golgotha there was there were four crosses the crosses is that right here was jesus and the fifth jesus one and a fifth on the right two and a fifth on the left three now here was judah four indeed what oh no what is that right just as much cross as jesus was on the bible said curse is he the hang on jesus become cursed judah also are you there so by hanging a man on the tree if you look under he was speaking not only about the crucifixion of christ but the the crucifixion of judah but the crucifixion also for christ because both died at the same time seal of the antichrist christ was the young the incarnated god judah was the incarnated what devil many people look at calvary and only see three crosses but there were four crosses you say you say i only see three well a cross is a tree curse is he that is that hang on a tree jesus was hanging on the tree and judas hung himself on the sycamore tree just as much curse and just as the same match as uh as the same as much three as christ was hung on the cross so after the death of judah which was combined with the death of christ are you there christ went to hell and he came again and rose again are you there esther chapter 8 first one you're there on that day did king answer is give what the house of who the jews enemy to master the what so after the death of judah which was combined with the death of christ jesus went to the grave rose again and when he was again he called esther and gave him the house of heaven we know for those who have bought a house when you go to the closing of the house you got a sand paper you stand here you stand here you sign here you stand here at the

ego a flying ego because he got fly very high that flying anointing looked at him and saw him flying ego what did you see what do you want john to see verse 8 and i look and beholder [Music] and his name that sat on him was what check and what check are you there when the last edge messenger comes he unfold or reveal his name because the devil wants to work undercover he and unveil his name and say what is going on what have been troubling the church of this time was death and hell because as long as the sickness is not identified you don't know which treatment to give that's why when you go to the hospital they pull your blood to check what are you suffering whether it's coronavirus whether it's tuberculosis whether it's a bacteria once they identify the enemy then you know what antibiotic to take from the pharmacy and to apply it so the last stage the ego anointing come and say you suffer that let me identify when the eagle identified he said his name is what and the lord already took the key and gave it to us are you there we have the cure you just didn't know the sickness you need a laboratory at the end time to detect the sickness now that we know the sickness let's take the medication and apply to the sickness you think i'm beside myself i'm not we got the devil elsewhere not me that liveth but what the world believeth in me it is not my dear it is his power not my dear it is his word he promises here it is he said he will be there and here it is we got his answer we have satan's answer god has vindicated himself god has proved himself to his promise in this day hallelujah the handship is here christ the reason why did brother bradham said the reason because the reason was the one that had the key are you there the reason christ is here in he is here in the same what of what i was the one that was dead and now i am that crash is here are you there then he ever was manifesting himself there is the what why did brother say the devil answer is the resurrection christ because the resurrected christ was the one that had the keys of what hell and the grave those key were delivered to the church [Music] let's go back to esther chapter 7 hallelujah a many many many men are you there hallelujah verse one he took the house of heaven you understand now he took the house of heaven after him and is hanged after the cross death resurrection this message [Music] this message is something else this message is perfectly aligned with the bible without the message the bible is a sealed book [Music] you won't understand the bible without the prophet [Applause] rejecting the prophet you are rejecting the bible [Applause] heaven the jew's enemy to esther the queen are you there and mordecai came before the king mordecai was on the other court so it's the spirit of elijah working within the temple no more outside that's the fourth elijah he's working in the brother because the old testament they were in the other court nobody could get to the holy of holies the tree manifestation was the three elijah of the old testament you remember last week but this elijah enter into the king's presence it is the elijah with the bride you understand now okay before the king for esther has told what he wants to hear the all the larger the three manifestation nobody knew the connection between esther and elijah that was the elijah of the old testament but the elijah of the new testament the fourth one his cousin with esther they are part of the brad they are family your fourth elijah in the book of esther are you there verse two and he and the king took off his wing we know the ring goes with adoption and position took offeasing which he has taken from him we spoke about it and gave it to who we know when they took the ring and gave it to joseph it was because joseph reached a higher position adoption so when they take the ring and give it to mordechai mordecai must have been positioned because on adoption they put a robe on you keep right here keep your finger here jump to verse 15 which might be on the back of your page jump to verse 15. are you there and who why not from what the elijah the fourth elijah in what so he entered now he's living with a royal robe adoption you see now he's on the white coast are you there the king's house you okay with royal apparel of what the color of trueness brother branham said and what the color of purity and with her not the crown but air not a crown brother michael [Music] but heir brother omar why does mordecai have to have a great crown what is the crown i'm reading brother branham what is the crown a crime means that you have you have a domain i'm going slowly make sure you have your seat belt you are a king if you are crowned and we are sons of god when we are clowned with what so our crime is what you understand now you need a prophet and our domain is what why god crown you why god anoints you with the spirit to take over the domain of the earth why that position why that position are you there adam lost it you understand now he lost the title due to earth and to what don't worry our domain is the earth make you priest and kings unto god is that right so there you are oh brother there is your crown the glorious crown of what a crown of eternal life watch here but he forfeited adam forfeited there tightened into it to this all this stuff as we know titled into what and two so the quran comes with a domain you follow me you follow me lord help me the bridge now oh my now the fulfill the title d is now into the hand of the original owner almighty god the tattle did to what and to what because once they give you a crown there is also a good man you gonna wait adam was ruling the earth he lost that position the three purpose of christ preeminence in christ demonstration of the principalities and the power preeminence in the blood to demonstrate to the principalities and power the second time then restore back eden to rule you understand how you understand now now the death of thee didn't go to the hand of satan he could not take it he went back to there you there you there god himself he pulled the signal are you there we are going to find it just a minute he sits on the throne with it in his hand the what so now we found out that when you have a crown you have a special anointing given to you to rule on a domain but the crown of mordecai was what who's modikai thank you help me brother branham because they have chosen the narrow path [Applause] did brother branham write the bible how can his message is perfectly in line with the bible my friend if you don't understand the message leave it alone stop acting crazy putting thumbs down because they have not shot i have chosen the pathway the hideaway that has worked out by your own choosing [Music] roof now i can understand that moses has to walk with his own choosing he didn't have to he made his what roof deciding that was so when roof is deciding he was not roof deciding but god decided through if you left the church and came here it is not you it is god in you that left the church and came here so that nobody can boast are you there i saw it and i left the church no you didn't leave the church he was questing you [Applause] are you there you hear people i saw it 10 years ago i saw it three years ago you didn't see it was god showing you that and the power to live is god who gets you that because so many people are still there it is not your decision it is my decision the lord's decision why because he has a special task for you that was my decision to stay with what so when you take a decision to stay with the world it is not your decision it is the decision of god through you you question yourself i don't know if i'm a child of god i don't know if i'm a child of god there are many simple ways to detect yourself whether you're a child of god or not if you are standing for what is right it's guarding you if you're standing for the world it's guarding you hallelujah that was my decision to stay with my word regardless of what it's done that has did it by your own choosing that has picked up and how can you be precise in your decision it is not your decision and it is what so what you took is not brother stephen it is the way of the lord you are going to the land of judah oh my god thanks be to god because of this momentous decision a what [Applause] [Music] that's why more than i have a great crown a huge person of what a big dumb man a big portion of anointing a signet in the right hand of god to the robber bear because you took that decision let me stand for the message let me fight for the message let me defend the message let me eat the message let me die in the message i will be rested with the message i will sit on the throne with the message because of this momentous decision a huge portion a big crown of heaven a weight of thee are you there now these men never know nothing about this vision because it's just ahead few days before that see what a glorious decision that has made this in itself that which will give and make to pass the tremendous victory in what the cap slowed what does a great crown mean brother branham a quran means eternal life means you have a domain brother branham if you have a vision let us know what your crown means if you notice it's punctuated and underlined if you notice it's wrong in french this spoken french verb before the adverb because of this momentum decision and what a huge portion of heaven awaits thee now that is what i wonder when i die will it be then i happen to think heaven is not portioned off to different portions to us up there heaven is what a quran is what the hell demon which is a kingdom are you there a kingdom of heaven that is what eternal life a big portion of it allah has waited for so mother kaya is given a big crown you're mordecai let's go back to verse 15. why did john tell me when to stop and mordechai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue white and of nfl great crown of what it's deity eternal life of god are you there and with a garment of what which is what the material of the garment of mordecai the material is fine lenin right which is the righteousness of the same the material is white but not the color let's read it and the garment of what fine linen and what so the color is purple brother problem help me our heavenly father affected tonight because that we are living in the hour of preparation we are living when we are you are preparing the people to believe we must reach a point we believe god can give our sister a new heart [Music] not just repair the rep the reparation the dealer does today is not back in the day today the dealer when they do operation they just exchange you come they remove get a new one put out there all day they used to open open up and now they don't do it to believe all things we believe that is the message of the day the preparation time jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever you are calling a people have give them the holy ghost and now your birth is already there now you are trying to call out that group of son to do what it's not your birth i'm talking about your adoption now are you there we realized that the old law was the son was born in the home your birth he was a son but the teacher the holy ghost raised him and then when he was of age it's been the right kind of a son he was taken out put there you okay so the purple robe spoke of royalty and he spoke of adoption that's why the crowd giving to mordechai matches we find lemon of the purple it was the adoption of mordecai put a purple robe on him a ceremony and adopted and that's what you're trying to do to these full gospel people now to get them out of themselves someone alone with you in faith to adopt them not both into the kingdom and give them the right to go forth and to do the things that you did to strip again principalities and power just like you did are you there let's go back to west chapter three and that's the spoke yet again before the king after giving the kiss of hell after giving all of this the bride is still not known who she is as they spoke yet before the king and fell down at his feet if you notice esther is in the presence of the king mordecai is in the presence of the king did you see the king giving her the golden scepter he did it the first time are you there that was when christ died for you he opened up the veil you enter but esther is already before the king talking face to face to the king after having experience the adoption of mordecai are you there sunset mountain all of them happen esther is watching then he turned to the king and begin to cry yet again to the king and fell down at what you remember the south phoenician woman okay to put uh and besott him with what so the bride is crying okay to put away the mischief of heaven the devil the god and his device that he has devised against the jews watch now usually according to the law when you enter the temple the palace if you are not called you remember that's when the king put the golden scepter because gentiles were not caught he put a golden scepter and we entered to the inner right but now esther is already there mordecai is already there esther already told the king he already did everything now why is the king pulling again the scepter verse 4 then the king held out the what but as there was there was already in the king the golden scepter is held out when you enter without permission they give it to you once you touch it then you are free to talk to the king but she was already talking to the king the king she even talked to the king that mother kai is my brother he's my cousin he's the one that took care of me they were talking to the king then he fell down at their feet and the king hold the golden scepter again i thought the golden scepter was already held as they have access but the king hold the golden scepter and we found out that that scepter was their righteousness are you there he already detained the cross but when he looked at esther crying crying crying crying the king pulled the scepter again this scepter is not because extra need access to the king are you following me because esther is already in the presence of the king but this righteousness is to unveil something to esther that she's still missing third seal just like take on it or neither side there was people coming who had power as king but was knocking see you have noticed the bible terminology of anything see now watch but this the reason that all the strain of the messenger you follow me of the mysterious part of what justification was preached by luther you following me but even though luther preached justification there was a portion of justification luther missed and when he missed it that portion that part of the food became a crumb because he was lost you following me you following me are you there let me steal your spot of sanctification let me steal your support of the baptism of the holy ghost are you there so every time they were abiding crumbs losing has been lost so a messenger must come are you there to pick up the loose cramps are you there and together together not for the jew for the dogs the gentleman are you following me when god the golden center was held to establish the king told her i justify you you are you have the right to enter into the congregation of israel now you can enter into my presence i die for you i give you my own righteousness i imputed to you my righteousness i took your place i became sin you become my righteousness get the golden scepter enter but still the bread don't understand the king understood that there is a mysterious spot of justification that esther don't understand that mysterious part of justification is what keep you under condemnation are you following me are you following me are you following me when you did something wrong are you there the devil catches your picture are you there when you get converted the devil still use that picture against you are you there if god said come preach the
