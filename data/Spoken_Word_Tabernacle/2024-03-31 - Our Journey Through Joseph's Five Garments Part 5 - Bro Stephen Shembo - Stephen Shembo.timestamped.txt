[50:39] uh last Sunday I mentioned something uh
[50:42] before I pray for our younger sister
[50:45] Joel I say I remember caring you and
[50:50] then when I went home it looks like the
[50:52] spirit of the Lord brought that back to
[50:54] me and I say wait a minute I didn't care
[50:56] car here he was my wife and my daughter
[50:59] because my daughter wanted to be the
[51:01] first one since it's a girl she say
[51:03] she's going to be the first one to carry

[51:09] what I need to correct that one so I was
[51:12] not the that was not the second time
[51:15] that was only the first time so I was
[51:17] the first time to carry her in church so
[51:20] I wanted to correct that on Wednesday I
[51:22] say no it was spoken on Sunday I have to
[51:24] wait on Sunday it was spoken from the
[51:27] pulpit that's where we corrected from
[51:28] the pulpit so I hope you're getting some
[51:30] good training amen amen glory to God so
[51:34] want to make sure every dot is put in
[51:37] the right place we don't want to stand
[51:39] before the King and then we have
[51:40] something that is taken up I don't want
[51:42] to be there I want to cross straight and
[51:45] go to heaven without any problem so my
[51:47] apology just want to make sure that is
[51:49] all cleared up let's go to our scripture
[51:52] this morning in Genesis chapter
[51:55] 49 that's why it's good to have the Holy
[51:58] Ghost brother Bram say he's a witness we
[52:02] can remind you of these things amen the
[52:06] only one who cannot repent is the Lord
[52:09] Jesus
[52:12] Christ amen amen glory to
[52:16] God Genesis chapter
[52:19] 49 I send you a quote on the church
[52:22] group chat about Easter so you got a
[52:25] beautiful quote somebody even send me
[52:28] the same quote I sent to
[52:31] them so happy Easter to each one of you
[52:35] because sometime after service some are
[52:37] quick to go and things I don't even have
[52:39] some time to shake your hands so if you
[52:42] here God richly bless you and happy
[52:44] Easter Genesis chapter 49 if you dare
[52:48] you can say amen amen Genesis
[52:52] 4922 I will try to see how we can SAR
[52:55] with this because we r in the middle of
[52:58] a deep series and let's see how the holy
[53:01] spirit will lead us I'm glad this
[53:04] sounds system is
[53:08] better amen I told you your days were
[53:15] numbered Genesis
[53:18] 49 I was in Genesis
[53:22] 37 Genesis
[53:25] 4922 the Bible says Joseph this is Jacob
[53:32] before he dies he call his children and
[53:35] begin to bless them each one of them so
[53:38] since we're dealing with Joseph we're
[53:39] going to go straight to Joseph and we're
[53:41] not going to touch any one of the
[53:43] patriarch 22 he said Joseph is a
[53:48] fruitful
[53:51] Bo so this boy is prospering
[53:55] amen even a fruitful Bow by the
[54:00] well so there is no way Joseph can dry
[54:05] up you might be seated he's a fruitful
[54:10] ball fruitful
[54:13] ball where by the
[54:16] well you remember River uh a tree
[54:19] planted by the
[54:22] rivers amen amen always green J no
[54:26] matter what you do he have a supply amen
[54:29] he's planted by the well there is water
[54:32] there for him the Bible says that Joseph
[54:35] is a fruitful bow even a fruitful bow
[54:39] buy a
[54:41] well whose branches run over the wall so
[54:46] it seems like this well has a wall he
[54:50] has a protection he has some
[54:54] limits but Joseph can clam above the
[54:57] wall
[54:58] amen so if you put Joseph his
[55:02] Blessing will
[55:06] escalate the blessing of Joseph clams
[55:10] above the wall above the wall
[55:16] am so it's not
[55:20] limit it's not limited to one
[55:24] spot it's a blessing that spreads amen I
[55:28] want you to understand that good it's a
[55:31] blessing that can
[55:35] spread so if you sit closer to
[55:40] Joseph amen what's going to happen to
[55:45] you amen amen we showed you Joseph as
[55:49] Christ we showed you Joseph as brother
[55:51] brandham now we are showing you Joseph
[55:53] as

[55:59] showed you Joseph like Jesus Christ now
[56:02] I'm showing you Joseph like you amen
[56:05] because it's Joseph Journey our journey
[56:09] through Joseph garment but Joseph is
[56:12] somebody that his Blessing doesn't stop
[56:14] on
[56:15] him if he's somewhere his Blessing
[56:18] spread

[1:01:58] because Jacob the father of Joseph the
[1:02:01] blessing of
[1:02:02] Jacob the blessing of Israel the
[1:02:06] blessings plural of your father have
[1:02:11] prevailed above the blessings of my
[1:02:16] progenitors progenitors means
[1:02:19] parent so Jo Jacob is saying the
[1:02:23] blessing that I have is higher
[1:02:26] than the blessing of my
[1:02:30] parents please can you verify your
[1:02:36] Bible is my Bible different no Chief is
[1:02:40] my Bible different than yours sir okay
[1:02:42] praise God the blessing of
[1:02:46] Jacob Jacob is saying that his Blessing
[1:02:50] is greater than his
[1:02:52] parent is greater than the blessing of
[1:02:59] Isaac have I said something
[1:03:03] wrong it is greater than The Blessing of
[1:03:09] Abraham because he didn't say progenitor
[1:03:12] one then he will be only Isaac he say
[1:03:17] progenitors plural and we know that
[1:03:19] Abraham begat Isaac and Isaac begat who
[1:03:23] Jacob and Jacob say he's blessed
[1:03:26] are greater than Isaac and Abraham if
[1:03:30] you would can we look at The Blessing of
[1:03:37] Abraham are we together amen are we
[1:03:40] together amen because Abraham God told
[1:03:42] him leave your country leave your family
[1:03:45] go to the land that I shall show you and
[1:03:48] I will bless you I will bless I will
[1:03:50] multiply you
[1:03:52] amen like the star of the heavens amen
[1:03:56] like the dust that is on on the
[1:03:59] seashore but Jacob blessing is greater
[1:04:02] than
[1:04:03] [Music]
[1:04:06] that at the opening of The Seven
[1:04:10] SE who blessed
[1:04:13] Abraham God God himself blessed him but
[1:04:18] let me show you something about Abraham
[1:04:21] in Genesis 14 the one on the computer
[1:04:24] say t my friend in Genesis 14 verse 18
[1:04:28] the Bible says and who
[1:04:31] MC his lineage is not about among human
[1:04:35] beings melis the king of what of Salem
[1:04:38] Jerusalem brought forth bread and what
[1:04:41] wine you know what it means and he was
[1:04:43] Priest of what the most high God and he
[1:04:46] blessed him and say Blessed Be Abram of
[1:04:51] the most high god possessor of heaven
[1:04:54] and water
[1:04:56] so Abraham was blessed by MC
[1:05:01] amen Jacob was blessed by
[1:05:04] Isaac but the one who blessed Abraham
[1:05:07] who laid the hand on
[1:05:10] Abraham is
[1:05:13] MC without beginning of day without
[1:05:16] ending of Life the one who possess
[1:05:20] Heaven and Earth bless
[1:05:23] Abraham but the blessing of Jacob is
[1:05:26] greater than
[1:05:29] Abraham what kind of blessing is
[1:05:33] it stretch yourself my friend the Bible
[1:05:36] says in Genesis 24 that and he said this
[1:05:40] is elas I am Abraham's servant and the
[1:05:45] Lord has blessed my master how greatly I
[1:05:49] did this to save you time so you don't
[1:05:51] flip back and forth to M Master greatly
[1:05:54] and he's become how great and he has
[1:05:57] given him what flocks and what and herds
[1:06:00] and what and silver and what and gold

[1:06:15] spiritually naturally financially every
[1:06:19] aspect Abraham is
[1:06:21] blessed by who
[1:06:24] MC but the blessing of
[1:06:27] Jacob is greater than The Blessing of
[1:06:31] Abraham let's see the blessing of
[1:06:35] Isaac we
[1:06:36] clear Genesis
[1:06:39] 26:12 then Isaac sold in that land and
[1:06:44] receiving the same year what 100
[1:06:47] fold no

[1:07:03] anything that's Isaac 100% And The Lord
[1:07:06] did what blessed him and the man Works
[1:07:09] how great and went what forward and grew
[1:07:12] until he became very great and for he
[1:07:16] had possession of what of flock a

[1:34:01] lay hand on Jesus Christ they gave Jesus
[1:34:04] to the Roman to the Gentile to do the
[1:34:07] job so when they say they say the Roman
[1:34:10] but actually he was the Jews amen
[1:34:13] everybody okay and the Bible say in John
[1:34:16] 7 verse1 that after these things Jesus

[1:34:32] Jesus Christ more than
[1:34:35] anything everybody okay and the idea to
[1:34:38] sell Jesus Christ came from Judah and
[1:34:41] the one who sold Jesus Christ was Judas
[1:34:44] from the tribe of Judas and the one who
[1:34:47] came up with the idea to sell Joseph was
