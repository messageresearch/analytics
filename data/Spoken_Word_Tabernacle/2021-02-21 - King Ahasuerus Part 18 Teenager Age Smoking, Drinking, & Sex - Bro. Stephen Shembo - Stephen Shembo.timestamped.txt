[16:52] jesus
[16:52] amen i don't have any prayer requests
[16:57] or praise reports i just have a
[17:00] testimony or two here
[17:01] yes ma'am
[17:04] yes ma'am
[17:08] i want to give god praise and i want to
[17:11] say it's indeed a blessing to be back in
[17:13] the house of the lord
[17:17] there were times when i felt like
[17:21] lord would i make it through
[17:24] but he brought me through
[17:27] he put all the doctors in place that
[17:30] needed to give me what i needed
[17:32] and you know god is a great god you know
[17:34] sometimes we ask for prayer
[17:36] and we expect to be he right away but
[17:38] then he allow
[17:39] somebody to be there because maybe they
[17:42] may not be able to accept the message
[17:44] but the prophet said just a
[17:45] cup of water in jesus name can give
[17:48] somebody eternal life
[17:50] and i really thank god for that because
[17:52] my
[17:53] doctor my primary care doctor said to me
[17:57] he said you had vip treatment because
[18:00] with
[18:01] all the underlying issues that you
[18:04] battle
[18:05] and for you to be looking like this
[18:07] because we did a video conference call
[18:10] he said miss falbe you are blessed and i
[18:12] want to give god all the honor and glory
[18:14] and praise
[18:15] [Applause]
[18:21] [Applause]
[18:24] amen hallelujah
[18:28] god is so good now before
[18:31] i got yes ma'am you go ahead do you
[18:35] give me one second because we got young
[18:38] charles here we got one
[18:40] um i was talking to brother uh caleb
[18:43] a while ago and uh i guess
[18:47] i guess it was a you could just consider
[18:49] it a misdiagnosis correct
[18:52] so yeah so what he went
[18:56] through when he was in boot camp was
[18:59] misdiagnosed
[19:02] so it was something that needed
[19:04] attention
[19:06] but had he not been in that situation
[19:10] it would have been an extremely high
[19:13] medical bill
[19:14] for him as a civilian so
[19:18] he was in long enough for this thing to
[19:20] be detected even though it wasn't what
[19:22] they said it was but what they did
[19:23] detect they treated
[19:25] for nothing and he's completely
[19:29] taken care of amen hallelujah
[19:33] glory see we can't try to figure out how
[19:38] god wants to work amen
[19:40] i'm gonna let you i'm gonna let your
[19:41] grandmama go first okay
[19:44] amen amen um i was having to talk with
[19:48] the devil

[21:53] amen glory
[21:56] glory to god amen
[22:02] good morning um
[22:06] i wanted to give a testimony to
[22:10] how good god hasn't been in my life so
[22:12] far
[22:14] i've you know sometimes you know i say
[22:18] you don't feel worthy for certain things
[22:20] so okay so
[22:24] a while ago you know he's been preaching
[22:26] like how you should
[22:27] carry yourself and how you should you
[22:29] know live your life and stuff
[22:31] so so i wanted to
[22:34] uh confess my sins to my parents and
[22:38] to everybody and but satan just kept
[22:40] saying you know
[22:41] you're not good enough yet you know you
[22:43] you ain't doing enough so
[22:45] i said i'll i'll say it in front of
[22:47] everybody so i know
[22:49] that when you come and say that i didn't
[22:51] confess right
[22:53] you know that means that i did confess
[22:56] right
[22:57] because how much you're fighting me
[23:00] shows me how much
[23:01] how scared you are of me because there's
[23:03] no way that you can
[23:04] keep you can keep fighting my mind and
[23:07] keep telling me that i'm not good enough
[23:09] because i did these things
[23:11] and that that you know i'm not a child
[23:13] of god
[23:14] because there's so many times to where
[23:16] i've been told that
[23:18] the reason why you feel this way is
[23:20] because you are a son of god you know
[23:21] because
[23:22] a sinner wouldn't feel anything
[23:27] so what i wanted to say is that
[23:30] a while ago years ago i fornicated
[23:33] and i had problems with pornography and
[23:37] i knew i was wrong i didn't feel good
[23:39] about it at all
[23:40] i felt very bad and i prayed about it
[23:43] and it got delivered me from it
[23:45] but and i told my parents and i felt so
[23:49] bad about it because for years i didn't
[23:51] say anything
[23:52] because i felt so bad about it so i told
[23:55] my parents
[23:56] because i thought because i said i'm not
[23:58] telling nobody this
[23:59] i'm not until the day i die i'm not
[24:01] saying nothing
[24:03] but as i had a wake-up call when um
[24:06] he preached a service on the prophecy
[24:08] and i said hey made me want to wake up
[24:10] man you know
[24:11] you can't you know you want to go to
[24:13] hell i said no
[24:14] so i said i'm going to confess my sins
[24:16] you know in front of everybody so you
[24:18] know saying can't say nothing to me
[24:20] so i i'm saying it now and
[24:24] the funny thing um the service
[24:27] wednesday service before last wednesday
[24:29] service
[24:30] um i prayed and there was this thing i
[24:34] always used to do
[24:36] i used to always pray as if i'm praying
[24:39] for the
[24:39] for the church this is a funny game i
[24:41] think i would do
[24:43] and i will always tell god you know
[24:46] because he said guys will recognize your
[24:48] faith
[24:49] and he'll show you he recognizes your
[24:50] faith and i always say
[24:52] when you recognize my faith when you
[24:54] show that i'm ready have me pray for the
[24:56] church
[24:57] and at that time i was so happy i didn't
[25:00] realize what he was doing
[25:02] so i prayed for the church and then
[25:04] after the service
[25:06] i realized what happened and i was so
[25:08] happy i was like man you know
[25:10] i didn't realize what we did
[25:14] and i was just so happy so
[25:17] and then he said disconnect yourself
[25:20] from everybody you know everybody from
[25:23] the world
[25:25] and that's what i did and then that same
[25:27] service
[25:28] the night i i told my friend i said i
[25:31] can't
[25:31] can't talk to you you know i just don't
[25:33] feel right i just felt so bad i didn't
[25:34] know why
[25:36] and then the same service that same
[25:38] night
[25:40] he said it he said you know you got to
[25:42] disconnect yourself
[25:43] and i just took that as a confirmation
[25:45] saying
[25:46] you're you're doing right you're in the
[25:48] right path you're in the line of duty
[25:50] right now so keep going

[30:34] scriptures concerning tithes
[30:36] when i got out of the air force i drove
[30:38] a truck over the road for a little while

[30:42] barely 250 dollars
[30:44] a week you were always a week behind

[30:53] the checks were very skinny when they
[30:55] reached the house
[30:56] and we had we were either
[31:00] we were still pregnant i think with
[31:03] rebecca
[31:04] at the time but we were struggling new
[31:07] house
[31:07] and you know our logical thinking was
[31:11] we can't pay ties we got to pay these
[31:13] bills
[31:14] and he came over and and i quit the job
[31:18] i quit the truck driving job and was
[31:20] kind of in limbo waiting on
[31:22] a job to get back with me
[31:25] i just knew i wasn't wanting to go over
[31:27] the road anymore so
[31:29] my last check after his talk he came
[31:32] over and had a talk and we said okay
[31:35] so my last check that um came to the
[31:37] house i think it was roughly
[31:39] four five hundred dollars or something
[31:42] and that particular check we paid fifty
[31:44] dollars for we just
[31:46] gave him fifty dollars and paid our ten
[31:49] percent
[31:49] well it wasn't a week later i was
[31:51] waiting for this
[31:53] company to call me to get a job and uh
[31:56] we got a we got a letter in the mail
[32:01] we got it we just
[32:04] i think it was from a state farmer
[32:07] somebody
[32:09] on my mind i can't remember last week
[32:11] much less that long ago but
[32:13] we received in that period of time that
[32:16] week that i wasn't working
[32:18] two payments that came to our house for
[32:20] oh we overpaid apparently with state
[32:23] farm and maybe an insurance you know
[32:24] a car payment or something and
[32:28] two went to my mom's house and we were
[32:30] on the phone with her
[32:31] we were opening one of them and then
[32:34] one went to my mom's house and we were
[32:36] just looked at each other and smiled and
[32:38] said will you open that for us and it
[32:39] was another check
[32:41] from something else that went to her
[32:43] house well
[32:44] total was about 450 dollars
[32:49] i mean that was a paycheck just from
[32:51] things that just
[32:52] they just came in i mean something even
[32:55] as simple as i took a class
[32:56] when i was at shaw air force base and
[32:58] had a pel grant and i had a little bit
[33:00] of money left over well they sent me a
[33:01] check for that
[33:02] i wasn't expecting any of it
[33:06] well since then i mean we may have eaten
[33:09] a few cans of beans and some rice
[33:11] you know but we paid our tithes and for
[33:13] a while we paid it
[33:15] on net what i was actually bringing home
[33:18] and depositing
[33:19] and then when we get our tax money like
[33:21] brother steven said we would pay
[33:23] tithes on the taxes and then we just
[33:26] said you know what it just didn't feel
[33:28] right still
[33:28] just didn't feel like we were completely
[33:30] honoring god and so
[33:33] i don't know how long it's been we pay
[33:34] on gross and that's the first thing that
[33:36] comes out and
[33:38] and he's taking care of us and you know
[33:41] i mean i know one day we may come to a
[33:43] point where
[33:45] we have to speak we might have to speak
[33:47] those beans and rice into a
[33:49] i'm gonna speak a steak okay i'm not
[33:51] gonna ask for no b
[33:52] when it comes to that point i'm gonna
[33:54] ask for a steak
[33:56] okay and i know it'll be the best steak
[33:57] i ever eat
[33:59] but he's able he's promised us these
[34:01] things
[34:02] i knew a man who made a million dollars
[34:05] twice in his life
[34:07] and he died in a low-rent apartment on
[34:09] welfare
[34:10] as an old man because he didn't i always
[34:13] figured he didn't pay ties
[34:15] i mean i can that's kind of an
[34:17] assumption but
[34:18] that kind of thing can happen
[34:20] hypothetically i guess with god we just
[34:23] we just want to honor him we want to do
[34:24] what the bible says
[34:26] and that's you know that's the first
[34:27] thing you learn in this message
[34:29] that the word is the truth you have to
[34:32] forsake
[34:33] your own belief let's go ahead and stand
[34:35] you have to forsake any doctrinal ideas
[34:38] that were ingrained in you
[34:39] and forsake them and just understand
[34:42] the word is the only thing in this
[34:45] entire
[34:46] universe that's the truth there's
[34:48] nothing else
[34:50] and we use king james i mean that's you
[34:53] know
[34:54] we actually use scofield you know that's
[34:56] kind of what the prophet used
[34:58] so we want to stick to it just just like
[35:00] he did so let's sing only believe and
[35:03] we'll invite our pastor up
[35:05] i was hoping that you know if there was
[35:06] anybody that was struggling with what he
[35:08] said last week
[35:09] with the tithing that hopefully you know
[35:12] it's real it was for our for our
[35:16] family it's real honor god with the
[35:19] tithe he don't need it but that's a
[35:21] commandment
[35:22] we have to obey the obedience
[35:25] is greater than the sacrifice amen
[35:29] he will take care of yes ma'am
[35:43] i'll be really quick i wasn't going to
[35:44] say it my husband said
[35:46] after before service are you going to
[35:47] give your testimony no
[35:50] but brother john just said something and
[35:52] he's talking years ago
[35:54] and i believe pastor preaches with
[35:56] everything he has in
[35:58] him and this is something that happened
[36:00] this week
[36:02] sunday pastor preached about tithes and
[36:04] offerings we called we reevaluated our
[36:06] tithing offerings
[36:08] we had been doing it right we followed
[36:09] his leadership we were obedient
[36:12] now you may not know church but my
[36:15] husband
[36:15] wasn't working in the summer he got sick
[36:18] i got furloughed or laid off in my job
[36:20] so
[36:21] finances were tight we had blessings
[36:24] come in and you know we were bouncing
[36:25] back but they were still slow
[36:27] following the obedience of what god sent
[36:29] through our pastor
[36:30] as of thursday
[36:34] we were waiting we had sent applications
[36:37] in for certain financial things
[36:38] and as a friday morning we've been
[36:41] checking all week to see the status of
[36:43] certain things it wasn't supposed to be
[36:45] deposited or sent until march four days
[36:48] from sending in the application
[36:50] it was approved and in our bank accounts
[36:52] so
[36:53] i say that to say trust him be obedient
[36:57] and fully consecrate because myself my
[37:00] family
[37:01] we are witnesses of what god can do if
[37:04] you just believe

[47:44] not your bible
[47:49] amen anybody can carry the cell phone
[47:53] almost everybody have the cell phone but
[47:56] when somebody look at the cell phone
[47:58] they cannot identify you whether you're
[48:00] a christian or not i was thinking of my
[48:07] colored brother sitting here
[48:09] that is the pastor of that fine group of
[48:12] singers
[48:13] a colored brother down in the south one
[48:15] time
[48:16] they say he was what dude he was doing
[48:18] water
[48:20] carrying a bible not carrying a cell
[48:22] phone
[48:24] carrying a bible and he could not even
[48:27] do what
[48:28] read one word how can you carry a bible
[48:31] you can't even read it
[48:33] and you know how to read the bible and
[48:35] the bible become a burden for you
[48:39] no i don't want to bring that big bible
[48:41] like that i just have my cell phone
[48:44] the bible is a burden for you you carry
[48:47] your bag it's not a burden
[48:50] hallelujah amen and he could not even
[48:54] read one word
[48:55] and they ask him say why are you
[48:58] carrying this
[48:59] bible he says i'm carrying him
[49:02] because i do what that is a water
[49:06] brother branham said carrying the bible
[49:09] is a good sign
[49:11] so bring your bible to church
[49:18] we want to go with electronic
[49:22] and pick up god in our electronics
[49:27] ezekiel chapter 16.
[49:31] brother stephen why do you use slaad it
[49:33] just popped to me
[49:36] i don't know if it's online or here i'm
[49:38] just putting that so you can see
[49:41] i'm using a board
[49:49] jesus christ one day you're gonna learn
[49:52] the holy spirit and you'll be careful
[49:54] what you're doing in church
[49:56] amen don't think you're fooling anybody
[50:00] people that have the holy spirit see
[50:01] things different than you see then you
[50:03] think
[50:04] ezekiel chapter 4 for as for your
[50:07] nativity the day you were born
[50:09] in the day you were born your navel
[50:13] was not cut up something is wrong there
[50:16] neither was not cut neither were you
[50:20] washed
[50:20] with water to suffer you you were not
[50:23] salted
[50:24] at all no swaddle at all you might be
[50:27] seated
[50:28] so right here this is where we start
[50:31] last week
[50:34] when we were dealing with what we are
[50:38] dealing now
[50:40] we showed you that there is couple steps
[50:42] here according to the stages orders of
[50:45] the circle of life this child is born
[50:49] at the birth of this child this child
[50:53] was not taken care of appropriately
[50:56] this child was not washed because he was
[50:59] born in mess
[51:01] and spiritually speaking david explained
[51:03] to us last week that
[51:04] we are born in sin shaping iniquity
[51:07] coming to the word
[51:08] speaking lies then the lord comes at the
[51:11] birth
[51:12] verse five no i pity you
[51:16] to do any of these to you to have
[51:19] compassion upon you
[51:20] but you were cast out in the open field
[51:24] to the lofting of your person in the day
[51:26] that you were born
[51:28] and when i passed by this is god coming
[51:31] at birth
[51:32] when i passed by you and saw you what
[51:36] polluted because you are born in sin
[51:39] automatically you coming in a mess
[51:42] everybody clear but we expect
[51:46] when god comes that way we expect god to
[51:49] come pick you up and clean you up
[51:51] but if you notice the lord never clean
[51:53] up that child
[51:55] anybody clear because the year of
[51:58] accountability
[51:59] you remember last week is still covering
[52:02] for that child
[52:03] if that baby died the baby goes straight
[52:06] to heaven
[52:07] because of the blood of jesus christ
[52:09] anybody clear
[52:10] so the lord never done anything else but
[52:13] one thing
[52:14] just spoke life and that's it but left
[52:17] the baby
[52:18] in a state of pollution everybody clear
[52:23] that's why your children your little one
[52:25] can tell lied to you
[52:26] and they keep telling lie you whip them
[52:28] tomorrow they tell lie
[52:29] you whip them tomorrow the teller yet
[52:32] they're under the blood of the lamb
[52:34] anybody clear why didn't god clean them
[52:37] up when they were born
[52:43] at the opening of the seventh seal the
[52:46] bible become a new
[52:48] book the more i speak this you will
[52:50] begin to understand that more and more
[52:53] in other words with the message of
[52:57] brother branham
[52:58] the bible is completely a different book
[53:05] hallelujah and i saw you polluted in
[53:08] your own blood
[53:09] i said to you when you were in your
[53:11] blood
[53:12] physical blood the polluted blood that
[53:15] came from
[53:16] from daddy with all the genetics and
[53:19] everything
[53:20] i will get into the genetic later and
[53:23] then you're going to see how
[53:24] you can get in trouble with your
[53:26] genetics amen
[53:28] your blood leave yeah i said to you when
[53:31] you were in your blood
[53:34] leave that polluted blood god just spoke
[53:37] life
[53:37] and you continue everybody clear verse
[53:40] seven i have caused you to multiply
[53:43] as the bad of the field and you have

[54:55] the second station your second stage is
[54:59] our stage it's called adolescent
[55:04] anybody clear or puberty
[55:08] that's where that woman is anybody clear
[55:11] then you go all the way to the peak
[55:14] then you reach adulthood anybody clear
[55:20] once you reach adulthood you begin to go
[55:23] down
[55:24] anybody clear and then the next station

[55:30] where
[55:30] we deal with menopause

[55:36] message anybody clear
[55:38] when you pass that menopause you go back
[55:41] to the old ages
[55:44] everybody clear if you notice my chart
[55:48] menopause is opposite of puberty
[55:53] just keep that in mind okay
[55:56] just keep that in mind you will see what
[55:58] happened here
[55:59] and you will see what happened right
[56:00] here anybody clear
[56:02] and if you look at my chart you will see
[56:05] that babyhood
[56:07] is opposite of this one
[56:10] everybody here in other words you start
[56:13] like a baby
[56:15] you get into the trouble of puberty
[56:19] then you get stable a little bit then
[56:22] you go back to the trouble
[56:23] that are like puberty then you drop down
[56:27] and you begin to act like a baby again
[56:30] and somebody need to take care of you
[56:32] again
[56:33] somebody was taking care of you here
[56:36] here somebody have to change your diaper

[56:50] don't worry hallelujah let's go to verse
[56:54] seven
[56:55] keep that chart it's like a pyramid
[56:58] pyramid in the message is it's our
[57:00] language
[57:01] he said your breasts are fashioned so
[57:05] this child is right here into puberty
[57:10] sex characteristic are fashion and your
[57:13] hair is grown
[57:15] the hair is not the hair of the head
[57:18] because that child was growing with hair

[57:57] and eve were created
[57:59] they were created naked and the lord
[58:02] left
[58:02] them naked so this child is still under
[58:06] innocency
[58:07] and then that's why a baby can walk
[58:10] naked and they don't even care
[58:12] amen because their innocency is
[58:15] shattered
[58:17] everybody clear but when adolescents

[1:08:55] we refuse to bow down
[1:08:59] amen verse 19 that was nebuchadnezzar
[1:09:04] full of fury and the form of his visage
[1:09:08] was changed against shadrach meshach and
[1:09:12] abednego

[1:09:48] is the number of god

[1:22:27] last week we got on this this slide here
[1:22:31] and we explained using the example of
[1:22:34] the fractional distillation
[1:22:36] now here we are dealing with somebody
[1:22:38] who's already
[1:22:40] been converted on the inside the white

[1:22:43] which is the top of the holy spirit that
[1:22:46] help you fight the battle

[1:22:49] is still the other man the flesh
[1:22:51] we still have the black dog that we're
[1:22:53] handling with we found out that
[1:22:55] according to brother branham
[1:22:57] that there are different four different
[1:22:59] candle loves
[1:23:00] we have agape love which we explained to
[1:23:03] you last week
[1:23:04] we have fill your love we have a lustful
[1:23:07] love
[1:23:08] and we also have filth love i hope
[1:23:10] everybody was there
[1:23:12] last week if you miss it you already
[1:23:14] catch up everybody clear
[1:23:16] now when you look at the two lust love
[1:23:19] which is the lustful love
[1:23:22] and the filthy love when you drop into
[1:23:25] this category
[1:23:27] automatically you are living under sin
[1:23:29] anybody clear
[1:23:31] if you are committing fornication you
[1:23:33] are a sinner
[1:23:34] and you are living on the scene
[1:23:36] everybody clear if you are committing
[1:23:38] adultery you are living on the scene
[1:23:41] everybody clear if you're watching
[1:23:43] pornography
[1:23:44] automatically you are living on the
[1:23:46] scene so whatever
[1:23:48] is under with these two kind of love
[1:23:51] automatically
[1:23:52] if you are living you are doing any of
[1:23:55] these things
[1:23:56] you need to clean up your life amen you
[1:24:00] need to repent and correct everything
[1:24:02] that you did ever clear so far now
[1:24:05] the problem that we have when you look
[1:24:07] at agape love
[1:24:09] a gap below have no interaction with sex
[1:24:13] you have no interaction with glenn but
[1:24:16] once you drop down to feel your love
[1:24:19] there is an introduction of sex all the
[1:24:22] way down
[1:24:23] but the difference is now what
[1:24:27] over there in philio love we have sex
[1:24:30] which include lust but when you drop
[1:24:33] down
[1:24:34] on the third uh category of love
[1:24:37] we still see sex there and lust also
[1:24:40] there
[1:24:41] so brother stephen do you mean that when
[1:24:43] we get married
[1:24:45] we are entering into this zone when you
[1:24:48] are
[1:24:48] get when you married correctly you are
[1:24:51] not dropping down into that zone
[1:24:53] everybody following me
[1:24:55] and i'm gonna explain that correctly now
[1:24:57] what is the difference
[1:24:59] the act is still the same act
[1:25:03] you follow me if you're sleeping you
[1:25:05] need to wake up
[1:25:07] what you do in marriage and what you do
[1:25:11] in a hotel under fornication if you are
[1:25:14] not married
[1:25:16] or under adultery if you are married
[1:25:19] you are doing the same thing the
[1:25:22] difference is
[1:25:23] which state are you when you're doing
[1:25:26] what you're doing
[1:25:28] anybody following me if you are married
[1:25:30] lawfully
[1:25:31] there's nothing wrong with it but if you
[1:25:34] are not
[1:25:35] married you're gonna fall under
[1:25:37] fornication or if you are married
[1:25:40] and you go out you are falling under
[1:25:42] adultery everybody clear
[1:25:45] let's go to first corinthians chapter

[1:25:48] and first one now concerning
[1:25:53] the things whereof you wrote to me it is
[1:25:56] good
[1:25:57] for a man not to do whatever
[1:26:01] that touch is not touching like this
[1:26:06] anybody clear go check your translation
[1:26:10] the correct clear translation means
[1:26:13] that it is not good for a man
[1:26:17] to have sexual relationship with a woman
[1:26:23] can you say amen if you notice there
[1:26:27] paul didn't say that it is not good
[1:26:30] for a husband
[1:26:34] do you follow me watch your scripture
[1:26:37] paul
[1:26:37] did not say it is not good for a husband
[1:26:41] to have sexual relationship with a wife
[1:26:45] no paul said it is not good for a man
[1:26:49] is no statute here everybody here
[1:26:53] and a what and a woman
[1:26:57] this woman can be anything
[1:27:01] everybody here but when you get to
[1:27:03] husband and wife
[1:27:05] husband is still a man but it's a man
[1:27:08] under covenant wife is still a woman
[1:27:12] but it's a woman under covenant
[1:27:16] everybody here now concerning the things
[1:27:19] were off you wrote to me
[1:27:21] it is good for a man not a husband
[1:27:25] not to have sexual relationship with a
[1:27:28] woman

[1:55:56] are you ready if a man take to himself a
[1:56:00] wife
[1:56:01] a woman and she become his wife
[1:56:04] covenant and they live together as water
[1:56:08] and why for 50 years they have been
[1:56:11] having
[1:56:12] relationship for 50 years
[1:56:15] they are just as what
[1:56:19] should that continue should that
[1:56:21] continue
[1:56:22] they are just as what and what
[1:56:26] and what as if they never knew one
[1:56:30] another
[1:56:34] do you see now when you are married you
[1:56:38] respect yourself
[1:56:39] you leave christian when god look at you
[1:56:42] you are still virgin
[1:56:44] [Applause]
[1:56:49] let me continue that is god's program
[1:56:53] but for that man or woman to go and live
[1:56:56] with another man or woman
[1:56:57] that perverts making uh illegitimate
[1:57:01] children born
[1:57:02] but if they live together in doubt
[1:57:04] perfect harmony
[1:57:05] that is god's way but satan comes around
[1:57:08] in the marriage and put what
[1:57:12] the black dog again he's not going to
[1:57:14] leave you because you got married
[1:57:16] young people when you get married he's
[1:57:18] after you in the marriage
[1:57:20] are you there because he's still living
[1:57:22] with you amen
[1:57:24] he put lasting a man of the woman and
[1:57:27] they leave what
[1:57:28] contrary to those marriage vow and that
[1:57:31] is what
[1:57:33] it is the very same sexual affair but
[1:57:36] it's what
[1:57:37] because you took it outside the covenant
[1:57:40] everybody here
[1:57:41] another one and then we move on now
[1:57:44] what is perfection perversion here
[1:57:48] you all look like adult mostly
[1:57:52] listen to this we are married people and
[1:57:54] you
[1:57:55] married men and you married women can
[1:57:58] live together as what
[1:58:00] and then women are just the same
[1:58:05] as the naval way do you follow me
[1:58:08] as long as you stay under god's program
[1:58:12] in the eyes of god it seems like no
[1:58:15] no no husband no man have ever touched
[1:58:19] you
[1:58:24] are you there they are water
[1:58:30] yet you marriage you have children but
[1:58:34] when god look at you even if you have
[1:58:37] 20 children god see you virgin
[1:58:43] why because you under his program
[1:58:46] then the blood covers you
[1:58:51] they are virgin as long as you stay with
[1:58:55] your water
[1:58:56] as long as you stay with your husband
[1:58:58] covered
[1:59:00] that's why a normal married woman
[1:59:04] that respect herself when she get around
[1:59:06] you you're gonna be
[1:59:07] before you talk to her you will see you
[1:59:08] begin to watch your word
[1:59:10] because she have like uh like an
[1:59:13] atmosphere
[1:59:14] that she's portraying you can see that
[1:59:15] this is a mother yes ma'am what can i
[1:59:18] can we do with you there is something
[1:59:20] you are pushing
[1:59:21] when you're walking you're walking with
[1:59:23] it they can sense it
[1:59:25] but if you lose when you're walking
[1:59:28] you will see they can sense you somebody
[1:59:31] else will look oh i'm sorry i'm sorry
[1:59:32] ma'am you you person
[1:59:33] hey what's going on but why did this why
[1:59:37] didn't he say what's going on to the one
[1:59:38] that just passed
[1:59:39] because that one is giving a different
[1:59:42] atmosphere
[1:59:43] amen of of purity of holiness
[1:59:50] amen now that is legal and lawful it's
[1:59:54] all right it is ordained of god to do so
[1:59:56] another woman can do the same act of
[1:59:58] your wife one of them
[2:00:00] you are righteous in the sight of god if
[2:00:02] you stay in his program
[2:00:03] and the same act to another woman you
[2:00:05] are what condemned before god that is
[2:00:07] what
[2:00:08] death because you follow the black dog
[2:00:10] everybody here
[2:00:11] now the black dog pushes downward
[2:00:16] in marriage he wants you to go through
[2:00:18] lust and he wants you to go through
[2:00:20] filth
[2:00:20] and the white dog even though you are
[2:00:23] permitted
[2:00:24] in the marriage to live as husband and
[2:00:26] wife he's pushing
[2:00:28] also you up until he's going to get you
[2:00:31] to a state
[2:00:32] where you hit a guppy when you get a
[2:00:36] guppy
[2:00:36] he takes the sex and the gland off of
[2:00:39] you
[2:00:40] then they give you a change of the body
[2:00:42] and no more
[2:00:43] to deliver under sex anymore everybody
[2:00:46] there
[2:00:47] that's why when they when they when the
[2:00:49] sadducees came to jesus they said we
[2:00:51] have a question
[2:00:52] they thought they want to call it jesus
[2:00:54] they say there was a man
[2:00:55] who got married to ignorance to a woman
[2:00:58] and he died and his brother gathered and
[2:01:01] died and the other guy
[2:01:02] up to the seven now when we go to heaven
[2:01:04] who's going to be the wife jesus said
[2:01:06] you don't understand
[2:01:07] when we got there what you've been
[2:01:09] dealing with here
[2:01:10] we don't deal with it over there because
[2:01:12] it's a gap in love
[2:01:14] it is a higher love the black the white
[2:01:17] dog is pushing you higher
[2:01:19] but here on the covenant you want the
[2:01:22] permission
[2:01:23] to do what you're doing but that
[2:01:25] permission be careful
[2:01:27] the black dog is still there do you
[2:01:29] follow me
[2:01:31] now as we move into where we started now
[2:01:33] in this
[2:01:34] circle here oh my god all right
[2:01:38] in this circle here we showed you that
[2:01:41] when you are born
[2:01:42] all the way to adolescence you reach a
[2:01:46] point where the black dog is there
[2:01:48] they don't clean you up the lord let you
[2:01:50] there in a mess
[2:01:52] but he's blocking the black dog
[2:01:53] everybody clear now
[2:01:55] when you reach puberty adolescence this
[2:01:58] is where we are
[2:01:59] when you try to enter the zone there are
[2:02:02] the words on we found out that over
[2:02:04] there
[2:02:05] what is going on with this age brother
[2:02:07] brown i'm speaking about billy paul i'm
[2:02:09] just going to rephrase this
[2:02:12] read it again brother branham say he is
[2:02:14] just in this adolescentage
[2:02:16] the what dangerous time of life
[2:02:20] i desire all of you to do what to pray
[2:02:23] for my boy because adolescent is
[2:02:26] deadly deadly why they are turning you
[2:02:28] loose
[2:02:29] they are turning you on and then you
[2:02:31] alive
[2:02:32] be careful it's deadly everybody clear
[2:02:35] deadly because your hormones begin to
[2:02:37] shoot up
[2:02:38] and when your armor begin to shoot up
[2:02:41] your body begin to change based on your
[2:02:43] hormone
[2:02:44] and that is gonna be the opposite in
[2:02:46] menopause
[2:02:48] because in menopause the hormones shut
[2:02:50] up
[2:02:52] then the dumping you are living under is
[2:02:55] gone
[2:02:55] your body goes under depression i'm
[2:02:58] gonna explain to you
[2:02:59] with quotes everybody here because the
[2:03:02] woman with an
[2:03:03] issue blood was suffering because of
[2:03:05] menopause that's what brother brother
[2:03:07] say
[2:03:10] that that there was menopause that was
[2:03:12] causing the issue of blood i can give
[2:03:13] you 10 coats
[2:03:17] anybody clear don't worry we're going to
[2:03:20] get there
[2:03:21] so in puberty adolescent
[2:03:24] your sex characteristic happened we
[2:03:26] found in ezekiel
[2:03:28] the two stages everybody there so now in
[2:03:30] puberty
[2:03:31] that final love came off because the
[2:03:34] scripture said that
[2:03:35] the time of love have happened that love
[2:03:38] is not agape
[2:03:40] it is your that pop-up the the
[2:03:43] the protection that was there is broken
[2:03:46] when it's broken
[2:03:47] the black dog is releasing brother
[2:03:49] branham says this
[2:03:51] i don't care how saintly a man is as
[2:03:54] long as he's human
[2:03:55] he cannot take the other sex in his home
[2:03:59] armed and female without having water
[2:04:03] that's why we don't believe in poison
[2:04:05] gas
[2:04:06] hugging because if you are normal
[2:04:09] when you touch a woman it's going to
[2:04:11] cause something that's right
[2:04:12] amen i don't care
[2:04:15] you tell me that i tell you you are
[2:04:17] telling a story in other words you're
[2:04:19] telling a lie
[2:04:20] and if you are a red-blooded man you're
[2:04:23] alive
[2:04:24] if you are really a man it's that way
[2:04:27] you can't help it you are human i don't
[2:04:30] say you're doing anything wrong
[2:04:31] but that sensation is just there the
[2:04:33] same in other words
[2:04:35] the same way you can hold your wife if
[2:04:37] you hurt another woman automatically
[2:04:39] you're gonna say something
[2:04:41] anybody clear praise the name of the
[2:04:43] lord then
[2:04:44] we found here in adolescent the black
[2:04:47] dog
[2:04:48] is released and the holy ghost also is
[2:04:50] coming
[2:04:51] to help you up for the battle when the
[2:04:54] black dog is released
[2:04:56] he brings a spirit on you and that
[2:04:59] spirit will begin to start
[2:05:01] blocking you from getting into covenant
[2:05:04] with god
[2:05:05] everybody follow me brother branham say
[2:05:08] the only thing that kept me from being
[2:05:11] saved
[2:05:11] when i was what 12 years old
[2:05:14] because what why didn't that spirit hang
[2:05:18] on brother branham when he was two years
[2:05:20] older
[2:05:22] amen that spirit waved at 12 and that
[2:05:25] spirit is there
[2:05:26] so there is the black dog the white dog
[2:05:29] both of them are coming they're just
[2:05:31] telling you this one is attracting you
[2:05:34] this one is attracting you amen and then
[2:05:37] because
[2:05:38] we are like adam and eve we have been
[2:05:41] given the free moral agency
[2:05:43] in other words god put you like in eden
[2:05:46] you choose what you want to do
[2:05:49] if you choose the wrong you're going to
[2:05:51] suffer if you choose
[2:05:52] joshua he's going to help you anybody
[2:05:55] there because because a spirit hung over
[2:05:58] me
[2:05:58] a devil saying what wait a little longer
[2:06:02] in other words he wants you to wait that
[2:06:04] wait
[2:06:05] doesn't mean your year don't grow your
[2:06:07] years continue to
[2:06:09] go but he wants you to wait on the
[2:06:12] things of god
[2:06:13] in other words enjoy a little bit here
[2:06:15] you're too young
[2:06:17] enjoy here when you get here you're
[2:06:19] going to be quiet and you can get
[2:06:20] married that's a lie
[2:06:23] many married people are continuing
[2:06:26] to chase women they thought they already
[2:06:31] enjoyed it's over
[2:06:32] now
[2:06:38] oh my god that's the reason you was not
[2:06:41] safe when you became
[2:06:42] the age of what accountability a spirit
[2:06:46] you got in a crowd and that over over
[2:06:48] you and keep
[2:06:49] hanging over you you wanted to do right
[2:06:51] there is not a man
[2:06:52] that has got his right mind but what
[2:06:54] wants to do right
[2:06:56] but there is something won't let him
[2:06:57] right that is what
[2:06:59] the black dog is released everybody
[2:07:01] clear he was a 12 years old
[2:07:03] and if you look on luke 2 you'll find
[2:07:06] that jesus when he was born do you
[2:07:10] follow me
[2:07:11] from the birth of jesus you follow me
[2:07:14] all the way here they never gave us his
[2:07:17] story
[2:07:19] have you noticed that do you know when
[2:07:22] they start giving us the story of jesus
[2:07:25] go to look to the message
[2:07:28] and the bible perfectly aligned like
[2:07:31] this
[2:07:34] take a look chapter two and you're gonna
[2:07:36] see when did they start brother branham
[2:07:38] say 12.
[2:07:38] what is stephen i want to see that in
[2:07:40] the description i want to see that in
[2:07:41] scripture
[2:07:43] everybody here luke 2
[2:07:48] look 2 verse 40. if you dare you can say
[2:07:52] amen
[2:07:54] page is still turning you there
[2:07:58] verse 40 and the child do what
[2:08:01] jesus was a child here everybody
[2:08:03] following me
[2:08:04] and jesus is growing
[2:08:08] we're clear remember the woman in
[2:08:11] ezekiel
[2:08:12] and the child grew and watched what
[2:08:14] strong in the spirit
[2:08:16] you see what i'm saying remember the
[2:08:18] woman in ezekiel also was
[2:08:20] growing everybody
[2:08:23] filled with what wisdom and the grace of
[2:08:26] god was upon
[2:08:27] him now his parents went to jerusalem
[2:08:32] every year of the feast of the passover
[2:08:35] and when he was what
[2:08:38] that's when the bible began to talk
[2:08:40] about him the bible talked about his
[2:08:42] breath
[2:08:43] about the the the measures about
[2:08:46] the the shepherd about herod
[2:08:49] and afterwards the bible keep quiet and
[2:08:52] begin to talk about john the baptist in
[2:08:54] other words
[2:08:54] close here john the baptist was
[2:08:57] baptizing people oh jesus is 12.
[2:08:59] no more john the baptist jesus said 12.
[2:09:02] why did the bible
[2:09:04] stop and go back at 12.
[2:09:09] the message in the bible like this
[2:09:12] everyday and when therefore
[2:09:16] verse 42 and when he was what
[2:09:19] 12 years old they went up to jerusalem
[2:09:22] after the custom of the feast they were
[2:09:24] going to church
[2:09:25] doing religious work the regions were
[2:09:27] met at 12 something happened to jesus
[2:09:30] why didn't jesus talk to the priest when
[2:09:32] he was seven
[2:09:34] why didn't he talk to the priest when he
[2:09:36] was six
[2:09:37] why he started talking when he was 12
[2:09:40] accountability
[2:09:41] everybody there verse 43 and when they
[2:09:44] had fulfilled the days
[2:09:46] and they returned they wanted
[2:09:49] you are not responsible yet you are
[2:09:52] still a child
[2:09:56] amen developing having a deep voice
[2:10:00] knowing how to drive a car don't make
[2:10:02] you mature
[2:10:06] you are still a child that's why when
[2:10:09] you commit fornication under your parent
[2:10:11] house you need to go repent to them
[2:10:15] like the young brother ouch
[2:10:18] yeah you're going to go tell mama what
[2:10:20] you did you're going to tell daddy what
[2:10:22] you need
[2:10:24] are you there they charge jesus terry
[2:10:28] behind in jerusalem and joseph and his
[2:10:30] mother knew not of him
[2:10:33] but they supposing him to have been in
[2:10:36] water
[2:10:36] they thought jesus was just hanging
[2:10:39] around in
[2:10:40] the restaurant with the young people at
[2:10:43] 12 years old
[2:10:44] they thought jesus was just hanging with
[2:10:46] the young people let's go shoot
[2:10:48] let's go do this let's go do this that's
[2:10:50] what they thought
[2:10:51] but jesus at 12 years begin to change
[2:10:54] his direction differently
[2:10:57] he begin to get focused to the father's
[2:11:00] business
[2:11:05] they thought oh he always played with
[2:11:07] his friend
[2:11:08] his uh his company he begin to leave
[2:11:11] the crowd at 12 years old he begin to
[2:11:14] separate
[2:11:15] from his friend he begin to change his
[2:11:17] direction
[2:11:18] young people it's time to cut those
[2:11:20] friend off
[2:11:23] amen it's time to start changing
[2:11:26] friendship
[2:11:27] amen and they've thought they supposed
[2:11:31] him to have been in company
[2:11:33] went a day's journey and they sought him
[2:11:36] among the what
[2:11:38] the king folks and who the people that
[2:11:41] know him
[2:11:41] no probably he's hanging around with
[2:11:43] brothers so and so
[2:11:45] is he there no he's not there so where
[2:11:47] is this boy again
[2:11:49] what is that boy he's telling let's go
[2:11:51] verse 45
[2:11:53] and when they found him not they turned
[2:11:56] back again to jerusalem
[2:11:57] doing water seeking him and he came to
[2:12:00] pass after
[2:12:01] three days they found him in the
[2:12:04] nightclub
[2:12:09] at 12 years old when jesus was lost
[2:12:12] they found him away they went to get him
[2:12:16] drunk in
[2:12:18] in downtown
[2:12:22] ah they found him in the temple
[2:12:25] sitting in the midst of water both
[2:12:28] hearing them and asking them water
[2:12:32] he began to get more inclined to the
[2:12:35] things of god
[2:12:36] asking questions brother stephen what do
[2:12:39] you think about this
[2:12:40] what do you think about this what do you
[2:12:42] think about this what do you think about
[2:12:43] it do you think jesus was not human
[2:12:46] do you think he didn't burn yes jesus
[2:12:49] burn
[2:12:50] because the bible said he was tempted
[2:12:52] every way
[2:12:55] amen are you there a prostituted woman
[2:12:59] was washing his feet what do you feel
[2:13:01] what your savior was feeling
[2:13:06] what do you think what do you think
[2:13:10] and he started like this and he keep
[2:13:12] talking
[2:13:13] and they say wait a minute that's why
[2:13:15] the pharisees say if he
[2:13:17] knew who is doing that why he didn't
[2:13:20] discern
[2:13:21] they didn't know that he knows how to
[2:13:23] take the fire off
[2:13:24] in other words when the woman come he
[2:13:26] turned off
[2:13:29] are you there when mary does does that
[2:13:32] and the pharisees say
[2:13:33] what kind the man is this this is even a
[2:13:36] professional any mother
[2:13:38] he didn't know that the one that took
[2:13:40] the fire off daniel
[2:13:41] was right there he turned the fire off
[2:13:45] amen he can turn your fire off
[2:13:49] he can turn your off and off and no
[2:13:52] matter how many
[2:13:54] women will dress wrong and pass in front
[2:13:57] of you
[2:13:58] in campus they don't do you anything
[2:14:00] because somebody turned the oven off
[2:14:07] if the same spirit that lived in christ
[2:14:10] before dwelling you
[2:14:12] it will also because it's
[2:14:16] a it's a it's a memory immunity
[2:14:19] jesus when he was doing that the holy
[2:14:21] ghost was memorizing that immunity
[2:14:23] when the holy ghost get into you when he
[2:14:25] touched that virus
[2:14:27] he remembered that jesus touched it with
[2:14:29] mary magdalene what was the response
[2:14:31] antibody lock off

[2:15:19] of the material coming in
[2:15:28] it is the material coming in song of
[2:15:30] solomon chapter eight if you dare you
[2:15:32] can say amen
[2:15:35] you there
[2:15:38] let's go to verse uh two
[2:15:41] i won't lead you and bring you into
[2:15:44] water
[2:15:45] my mother's house who would water
[2:15:48] so right here this woman
[2:15:53] mother is distracting a woman
[2:15:58] everybody yeah mama that's your
[2:16:00] responsibility
[2:16:02] but you're going to see in another
[2:16:03] chapter as we keep moving
[2:16:05] job to verse six set me
[2:16:08] as what a seal upon your heart
[2:16:12] as a seal upon your arm for what
[2:16:17] is strong as what what kind of love is
[2:16:21] compared to death
[2:16:24] they say love the strength of this love
[2:16:28] are you following me the strength of
[2:16:30] this love
[2:16:32] is equal to the strength of what
[2:16:36] this is not agape because agape is
[2:16:40] higher amen that's why agape can swallow
[2:16:44] death in victory agape when he gets
[2:16:47] death
[2:16:48] he destroys death into his component and
[2:16:52] and get him off anybody there
[2:16:55] agape when you put when i give you the
[2:16:58] letter
[2:16:59] when i do this that sin
[2:17:03] that's a problem anybody clear when i
[2:17:06] when i go to the alphabet and i say i
[2:17:09] and s this is no problem
[2:17:13] amen agape break it down
[2:17:16] amen and bring it back to original
[2:17:20] and that combination don't exist anymore
[2:17:22] that's why brother branham said the
[2:17:23] blood of jesus christ is like a bleach
[2:17:26] amen the bleach tech color it doesn't
[2:17:30] make the call of vanish
[2:17:31] it just break the color down and send it
[2:17:34] back to
[2:17:35] its original and that blackness goes
[2:17:38] away
[2:17:38] amen so when you take sin you put in the
[2:17:41] blood of jesus christ
[2:17:42] you just break that away and then when
[2:17:45] they look at you they don't see any more
[2:17:47] everybody there that's a higher love
[2:17:49] which is a gap in love
[2:17:51] do you follow me now this strength the
[2:17:53] strength of this love
[2:17:55] is the strength of death that's not
[2:17:57] agape because
[2:17:58] agape is the law of spirit and the law
[2:18:01] of the spirit of life is greater than
[2:18:04] the law of what
[2:18:05] sin and death that's why the road of
[2:18:07] moses could swallow the two road
[2:18:09] and it becomes back another road when
[2:18:12] you check that road you don't see the
[2:18:13] other road anymore
[2:18:15] amen but those roads used to be the
[2:18:17] musician
[2:18:18] but when they get sucked into moses road
[2:18:21] agape dissolved them
[2:18:23] and when you look at moses road you
[2:18:24] don't see those roads anymore
[2:18:26] yet they were swallowing they existed
[2:18:28] that's the power of the spirit of life
[2:18:31] that take generous and generous sin
[2:18:33] death and swallow them up
[2:18:35] you understand now now let's go down
[2:18:38] hallelujah set me as a seal upon your
[2:18:40] heart as a sin upon your arm
[2:18:43] for love is strong as what and jealousy
[2:18:47] you see that feel you and genus says
[2:18:50] what
[2:18:51] cruel as what grave where is your
[2:18:54] victory death where is your victory
[2:18:56] that's speaking about sin
[2:18:57] we underfeel you everybody clear
[2:19:01] verse six and then jealousy is cruel as
[2:19:04] the grave
[2:19:05] the water
[2:19:08] thereof are water so
[2:19:11] this love have caused
[2:19:14] and those cause are cause of water it's
[2:19:17] a burning
[2:19:18] love you follow me now
[2:19:21] that's why paul said if you burn
[2:19:25] because it's a burning love it's a love
[2:19:28] that burns
[2:19:29] that consumer everybody he said the
[2:19:32] cause thereof

[2:22:02] said what do they do
[2:22:04] tell them what a leader want

[2:22:09] thing the second thing he's dealing with
[2:22:12] drink
[2:22:13] which is talking about beer he's talking
[2:22:16] about wine
[2:22:18] he's talking about whiskey you can go

[2:22:23] anybody there to go to each place
[2:22:27] it's got to a place i'm sorry they know
[2:22:31] that raises what the third thing brother
[2:22:34] branham is mentioning
[2:22:36] is about the passion which is in
[2:22:39] in clear word your sex desire that's
[2:22:42] right
[2:22:43] remember your libido
[2:22:46] everybody clear so brother branham is
[2:22:49] giving three point here
[2:22:50] he say they found out that they are
[2:22:53] giving teenager
[2:22:55] cigarette they're giving them wine
[2:22:58] and that those two have an impact
[2:23:02] on the passion you have an impact on
[2:23:05] that feeling you love that burner
[2:23:08] are you following me when you take
[2:23:10] cigarettes you take cigar
[2:23:12] you take marijuana you take beer you
[2:23:14] take wine or whiskey

[2:23:32] in human life
[2:23:33] little boys and girls till they become

[2:24:18] anymore
[2:24:19] you are tired of women and you begin to
[2:24:22] go through men

[2:24:24] homosexuals open up
[2:24:26] because the women become cheap i have a
[2:24:28] quote
[2:24:29] ask me i will send it to you you play

[2:24:38] homosexual be among them

[3:02:43] who was vexed with the sin of sodom
[3:02:45] when they gave him wine he didn't know
[3:02:47] he was taking his own daughter

[3:07:39] gravity
[3:07:39] and meet you in the air lord father you
[3:07:42] are bringing a message to let them

[3:07:47] word that those that are

[3:07:51] many have been
[3:07:52] hiding with a lot of stuff load some did

[3:08:26] darkness away from our life
[3:08:27] father may you help everybody in this
[3:08:30] church to surrender to what we are
[3:08:32] preaching
[3:08:33] whether it is the tithing whether it is
[3:08:36] the offering
[3:08:37] whether it is that boyfriend that friend
[3:08:39] that girlfriend
[3:08:40] that relationship at work or whatever it
[3:08:43] is father may they
[3:08:44] cut that off knowing lord father that
[3:08:47] mercy
[3:08:48] have been granted and the door of
[3:08:50] deliverance has been
[3:08:51] opened there where they can flee and be
[3:08:53] completely set free
[3:08:55] from that which they are suffering lord
[3:08:57] we are committing them unto the hand
[3:08:59] may the holy spirit continue to madly
[3:09:02] minister
[3:09:03] unfold this word and not only unfold but
[3:09:06] cutting every benz every shackle
[3:09:09] every demonic spirit lord that is
[3:09:12] keeping people
[3:09:13] away from the church they can go
[3:09:15] anywhere
[3:09:16] but the church they can sacrifice the
[3:09:18] church for anything else lord
[3:09:20] but they don't want to sacrifice other
[3:09:22] things for the church lord
[3:09:24] father we commit them unto the hand help
[3:09:26] them
[3:09:27] understand to love you to give you
[3:09:29] preeminence
[3:09:30] in everything lord make their life be
[3:09:33] centered
[3:09:33] around what pleases you around worthy
[3:09:36] what belongs
[3:09:38] to the kingdom around the father's
[3:09:40] business lord
[3:09:41] father they get sucked up in doing this
[3:09:43] doing this doing this
[3:09:44] and the last thing that come to mind is
[3:09:47] whether we want to go to church or not
[3:09:48] whether did we read the bible or not
[3:09:50] whether did we listen to the message or
[3:09:52] not
[3:09:52] and especially we got home we can listen
[3:09:55] to it later
[3:09:56] i can sleep i can watch it on youtube
[3:09:58] father
[3:09:59] may you shake them where they are father
[3:10:01] lord jesus christ
[3:10:03] may you touch even those that are home
[3:10:05] that come to fund
[3:10:06] lord some are there for legitimate
[3:10:09] reason some are sitting
[3:10:10] drinking coffee and listening to the
[3:10:12] sermon drinking lord drink
[3:10:14] and listening to the sermon sitting lord
[3:10:16] father comfortable
[3:10:18] maybe on a short maybe with a short
[3:10:20] skirt
[3:10:21] maybe with an inappropriate dress and
[3:10:24] listening to the sermon because they're
[3:10:25] home
[3:10:26] now church becomes something that is
[3:10:28] casual
[3:10:29] lord may you shake them from this
[3:10:32] situation
[3:10:33] and may your mercy extend lord may you
[3:10:35] deliver them
[3:10:36] father we commit everything unto the
[3:10:38] hand in the name of jesus christ

[3:10:53] mercy
[3:10:56] reroll my life
[3:11:02] oh mercy
[3:11:06] reroll my high life
[3:11:12] i should have fallen
[3:11:17] my soul cast
[3:11:20] down but mercy
[3:11:27] rewrote my let's sing it one more time
[3:11:31] [Music]
[3:11:34] oh mercy
[3:11:39] rerolled my
[3:11:41] life
[3:11:44] [Music]
[3:11:47] yes mercy
[3:11:51] rerode my highlight
[3:11:59] i should have fallen
[3:12:04] my soul
[3:12:07] cast down but mercy
[3:12:14] rewrote my life
[3:12:19] i was sitting back there listening to um
[3:12:22] what he was preaching here and
[3:12:25] uh i was thinking about mercy
[3:12:29] it's kind of twofold this morning god is
[3:12:32] showing mercy on our young people so
[3:12:34] that they'll hear this message
[3:12:36] and never walk that path
[3:12:40] now it's almost it may be just a couple
[3:12:44] of days
[3:12:44] past 30 years for me i was in desert
[3:12:48] storm
[3:12:48] 30 years ago right now
[3:12:52] and it was the february 18th or 19th or
[3:12:55] something
[3:12:56] i was out on a post riding with a man we
[3:13:00] had
[3:13:00] uh we had some christian music playing
[3:13:04] you know on a little we didn't have
[3:13:06] phones back then we just don't even know
[3:13:07] what we were playing
[3:13:08] [Music]
[3:13:10] the humvees certainly didn't have
[3:13:12] stereos in them but
[3:13:14] we were reading the bible and
[3:13:17] i smoked i smoked then
[3:13:21] and i guess i can probably say
[3:13:24] i had been smoking since about the age
[3:13:26] of 12.
[3:13:29] [Music]
[3:13:31] and also during that time
[3:13:35] they rationed it but you could get two
[3:13:37] beers a day
[3:13:38] it was just rationing i didn't always
[3:13:41] get them but
[3:13:42] occasionally i did lord knows when i was
[3:13:45] in college and even
[3:13:46] younger i drank a whole lot more than
[3:13:48] that
[3:13:48] [Music]
[3:13:49] and he's right it'll make you go crazy
[3:13:52] so the second half of this mercy that
[3:13:55] i'm talking about
[3:13:56] was extended to me that day when i was
[3:13:59] in desert storm
[3:14:00] because the very not just i didn't just
[3:14:03] crumble up a pack of cigarettes and
[3:14:04] throw them away the desire
[3:14:06] to smoke them left me
[3:14:10] desire the desire to to drink the
[3:14:13] alcohol
[3:14:14] left me my kids have never seen me drunk
[3:14:18] i used to you know it was genetic for me
[3:14:21] because i used to see my dad drunk a lot
[3:14:25] [Music]
[3:14:28] so i want to emphasize that mercy this
[3:14:30] morning
[3:14:33] he's shown us a lot
[3:14:36] and here we are we're here here in his
[3:14:39] word
[3:14:40] and we can amen the mercy in our life
[3:14:43] i'm very very very grateful for what
[3:14:46] he's done for me
[3:14:49] because as this song says
[3:14:52] i should have been cast down my soul
[3:14:54] should have i should have fallen
[3:14:56] and i was i was head strong
[3:14:59] wanting to go in that direction but i
[3:15:02] just like he said
[3:15:03] my life was full of woes it was full of
[3:15:05] sorrow
[3:15:06] it was full of contention so this word
[3:15:08] is true
[3:15:10] i mean it's nothing but the truth when i
[3:15:12] was in the middle of all that i had no
[3:15:14] idea what it said
[3:15:15] i was raised a methodist but you know
[3:15:18] it's a baby catholic
[3:15:20] so i i am beyond
[3:15:25] grateful the joy of my heart
[3:15:29] is not it's not expressible
[3:15:33] for what he did for me
[3:15:37] i don't want to see any not just my
[3:15:40] children but
[3:15:41] anybody here go through that
[3:15:46] if you're interested in hearing the
[3:15:50] message that that jesus basically took
[3:15:53] over brother branham's body
[3:15:55] and spoke through him it's uh looking to
[3:15:58] the unseen
[3:15:59] and it's at the end of that um
[3:16:04] i don't think it's in the book if you
[3:16:05] were to read the book i'm not positive
[3:16:07] about that but i know it is on the
[3:16:09] it's it's on the recording
[3:16:12] it's very good you should go back and
[3:16:14] listen to it if you get a chance
