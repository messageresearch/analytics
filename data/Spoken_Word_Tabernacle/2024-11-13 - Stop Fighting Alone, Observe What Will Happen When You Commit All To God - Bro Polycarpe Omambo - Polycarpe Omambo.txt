Jeremiah 29 verse 11 [Music] reading in the name of Jesus Christ blessed be the name of the Lord reading [Music] for I know the thoughts that I think toward you sayith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end amen amen may God bless the reading of his word you might be seated I'm going to read something else in the Book of Joshua josua 1 verse 1-9 but to save time you already know the story I'm going to start from verse three or I can start from one but I won't read everything after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord he came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Nan Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all these people unto the land which I do give to them even the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses I'm in verse five now there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee vers verse six be strong and of good courage For unto this people shall thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their father to give them verse this book of the Lord shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then shall thou make thy way prosperous and then shall thou have good success let's pray Heavenly Father you are the author of this book we have just read father we are right now in th presence Lord father we asking you to move us out way may you speak to your children we have read your promises that you gave unto Joshua and in the midst of us we also have Joshua of families here they also heard the reading and they would like to use the same they want see they want to see the Fulfillment of his word in their life that's why we are asking you in you who Masters everything you who controls everything you who possess everything who can change everything this is your people oh God manifest th for those who are sick may you heal them those that have problem may they know that you are there those that are in a fight that are fighting alone today may they know that you're the one that told J that I would not leave you I will be with you as I was with Moses your people want you to be with them in the midst of the trial in their situation they want to see you tonight because you don't change you are the same yesterday today and forever father we want all the glory to be given unto because we know that you already your children those that have a trouble heart may they receive peace because we confess it in the precious name of our Lord and Jesus Christ may all the glory may all the honor be given to you because you are worthy of all of them in the name of Jesus Christ amen once more God richly bless you we came to our appointment with our savior Our Father blessed be the name of the Lord he's the one that told Joshua that be strong the one that will divide these people into the to inherit the land and he's the same God tonight he is your god he has the control of all your situation I'm going to read something in Matthew 17 verse 20 Jesus spoke unto them and he says this because of your unbelief for verily I say unto you if you have faith as a gra of mastered you shall say unto this mountain remove Hands To Yonder place and it shall be and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you you H amen for God your future is uh something it's Dreadful glor and it's glorious this is the way God perceive it amen amen no matter what you're going through I want you to catch God's perception my subject tonight is stop fighting [Applause] alone observe what will happen when you commit all to God amen amen amen let me read something in Psalm [Music] 23 I walk in the midst of the shadow of the Valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou with me and stff they comfort me do not do not walk in the Valley of the shadow of death murmuring [Applause] many times we are passing through the valley this is David speaking David found also himself in the same situation but David remembers God promises unto him amen amen that road and that stuff they comfort me meaning that David found himself in a difficult situation like you and me but he was not discouraged he never credited anything to the devil he confessed that which was [Applause] positive David was walking through the valley of the Shadow standing upon the word of God without murmuring life depend on the way you look in it even your future depend on the way that you expecting that to be even if somebody promised to you to give you money or that tomorrow you get Mar it depends on the way you are looking at that person amen amen glory to God in Matthew 192 and Mark 10 verse 27 Jesus is using the same words Jesus look unto them and say what is impossible to man is possible unto God amen amen people had trouble maybe the disciple were unable to provide healing and they asked the Lord Jesus CHR why we were unable to heal this person and Jesus for men it's impossible but for God all things are [Music] possible and remember we read where Jesus mentioned about the master seed God doesn't want doesn't wait for your faith to be such when he was talking about a master seed in other word you must have a right perception to take that Master seed that little faith that you have even if it's a little grain of it if you can bring unto God that faith God is the one that will remove that mountain why are you not able to move a mountain because you are focusing on the mountain it's true that mountain your problem is real true but with your natural eye there is no way you can move a mountain you need somebody that is specialized on Impossible situation to move that mountain you want somebody that is invisible but that can work M things in the visible realm but when we are alive and when you facing your situation maybe it's a health issue maybe a relationship that is in trouble maybe a financial trouble and it's troubling you you cannot find solution yourself you're small little faith Jesus want you to give him that faith when you give him that faith and you conf and you trust in him and he's the one that will take care of the situation he's the one that will remove the mountain he's the one that will change the situation for you amen amen in Mark 23 in Mark 9 actually 23 this is somebody who had a child who was possessed by a spirit and Jesus say here if that can't believe all things are possible to him that believeth [Music] Jesus that what is impossible unto men is possible unto God but now Jesus is saying to this person all things are possible to him that believe amen amen meaning when you believe there is nothing that will resist you because at the time that you start believing you already have the omnipotent power because it's God who does the work am amen it is God who can who change the situation in act 8 verse [Music] 37 Philip you know the story about Philip and Ethiopian unic amen amen and Philip says this if thou believeth with all heart mayest he answered and said I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God I want you to notice somebody who have the omnipotent power of God like Philip he never say if you believe in God he if you believe from all your heart you can have it do you do you hear that mhm verse 39 and when they were come up out of the water the spirit of the Lord C away Phillip and and he went on his way rejoicing and but Philip was and passing through he preached in all the cities till he came to cesaria look at the power or the omnipotent power of God in a man Philip was with the Ethiopian un and he told him if you are believe you can believe all things are possible you can have eternal life and he went and baptized the man after the word of baptism receive eternal life at the same time he even forgot about pH he to rejoice and glor he was happy this is what the Bible says but at the same time Philip disappeared we know when we are acquainted with the the the the the going away of the the Lord Jesus Christ when he died and rose again and the disciple were there in the room shutting and suddenly Jesus appeared amen amen and we all know that story but this one is not Jesus it's Philip phip this is Phil so when you take God at his [Music] word because the word of God is God himself you don't use your own thoughts anymore you are going with God's Own [Applause] thoughts look at a man who become somebody who met something when you met God when the omnipotent of a man meet God something always happen in 2 Corinthians 4:7 it's written that we have this treasure in Earth vessel so that the Excellency of the power be of God and not of us so God judge himself and he decided that we who are Earth and vessel and God took a treasure and put inside of us and that treasure is God himself it is the holy ghost that we are carrying this is what make us om this is what make us God listen to what brother Bram says hereen the in the pmos vision 1960 on December the 4 in the evening paragraph 21 brother say Amen cut every obstacle from human beings that they might be connected like in the Garden of Eden now man I was going to choke it but I'm going to say it man is [Applause] omot you don't believe that but [Music] he a man fully surrendered to God is did not he say in Mark 11:22 whatsoever thing you say what whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart you can have what you have said amen amen what happens when two omnipotent when God and man to omnipotent something got to [Applause] shake no matter what you say with that creative power of omnipotence of God knowing that he promis and he said it in his word he creates a power that goes Yonder and bring things to pass things that is not and make them as though they are amen amen because two omnipotents have met there he stands oh isn't he wonderful the prophet here is talking about the omnipotence of men when a man meet God something will happen even if something never happened before when elij on [Applause] car nobody ever seen fire god coming down and consum in alloc mean sacrifice but the omnipotence of God in Elijah Elijah called for Fire and Fire came down this is what brother is saying something that never never happened before Elijah said let it be no rain for three and a half years something that never happened before there were people human being like us Joshua stopped the sun something that never happened before are you listening blessed be the name of the [Applause] Lord so I don't know your problem tonight look at this again speaking about the omnipotence of God act 5 verse 1 the Bible this is about a man called anas and Safar wife you know the story I'm just going to speak I'm going to verse three listen to Peter but Peter say to why has Satan filled that heart to lie to the Holy Ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land was he remain was he not done on and after he was sold was he not in own power why has thou conceived this thing in th heart listen to this that has not lie unto men but unto God and anas hearing these words fell down and gave up The Ghost and great fear came on all them that heard these things I want you to notice something Peter a human being with all disciples the unity created the omnipotence of God Peter was speaking to another human being called ananas he looked at him he said why did you li to the Holy Ghost Peter became the Holy Ghost according to what reading and as he's moving forward he also speak he say you didn't lie onto man but you lied onto God when anas heard that fell down and gave up the ghost right on the spot and in Psalm 82m 82 God already declared he judges among Gods amen amen you see so in verse six God says I already declare ye are gods look at these people in the scripture knew their position when they didn't have the full word like they don't have the Revelation that we have only have a portion of the word but in the end time all the mysteries of God are already declared word of God is already [Applause] unfolded how can you be crying amen amen say you didn't lie to men you lied to God you lied unto God you did it unto God and this is what happened also when his his wife came back and she also had the same F so no matter where you are now no matter who you are God is able to localize you when you trust in him as tonight we are going to see it that for a long time you fought your battle alone meaning when You Face a situation yes symptoms are real problem situation difficulties are real this is not what the Lord Jesus say take your problems give unto give unto the invisible because he can make the invisible become visible you remember that light came up but out of nothing God the light out of and God say let and and and when light came out so before light what was there do you see what I'm saying so the one who Masters everything the one who controls everything it is God himself when you facing a situation trust in God when we say Have Faith word what it means is put your trust in God don't look at the problem do not look at your sickness don't look at your condition no matter if the condition is there but look unto God and God will change something blessed be the name of the [Applause] lord it's wonderful amen even those that are not here in church tonight those that are streaming I have a message for it's uh 1 Samuel verse 16 am 11 to3 1 Samuel 16 11-13 meaning no matter where you are now God is able to find you even if you are keeping sheep somewhere this place Samuel came at J's house God sent Samuel to the house because God wanted to anoint someone and he went and arrive J's house and now he say I want to see your children now listen and Samuel say unto Jesse are they are here all that children because Jesse begin to bring his children all seven he brought them out but they even forgot David his own father didn't even say suay the prophet was there he said oh maybe it's this one and he was not maybe it's this one he maybe and he was God Contin to reject reject reject he was the prophet asking not even the father remember that's when they begin to remember oh there is a little one he somewhere you who are whichever place you are the master needs you tonight God needs you tonight you who are still away from the word of God Jesus is Calling Jesus is looking for you you who have not taken decision yet to live according to the word of God need you tonight now notice what happened the prophet say we won't even eat in other word David stop everything and put everyone I don't know how many hours they were until they go find him first nobody could eat a home nobody can see even the prophet when God make a decision for your life when God decid for life God will change everything God will change everything we will see my friend that God is able God can even uh make some some PL for you he can even plot something for you just for your blessing when you are going through trial that you are thinking God have forsaken me but maybe the road that you're going through is what God have ordained for you it's like tonight you are listening to the word of God this word is to charge you is to recharge your it will come a time you won't hear this word but what you already heard is what you going to apply in your life [Applause] Joseph in the house of his father he only have two vision only two dreams in what condition when everything was right when you are good remember even when you were a younger child God maybe spoke to you something maybe somebody told you something when you were younger maybe one day you were reading years ago maybe a dream you maybe a a dream forgot about that dream God doesn't forget and Joseph didn't forget all the time he passed he never had another dream only the two dream he had in and those two dreams caus him trouble maybe he was a little proud when he was having dreams what is going to happen and the devil work because he want to choke it but you can't choke the word of God for that to happen they had to sell him they have to put him in a p but he could not die because the promise was already there Joseph didn't even mind he was not even murmuring you see maybe you going through the same situation but when you face situations you start murmuring oh I pray too much I pray unto the Lord I the Lord I I made my yes you did it but you don't know my friend God is working maybe during your trial God is bringing you to your [Applause] destiny look at the trial of Joseph they he went to and then he got in trouble with for wife then Joseph look woman this is not the woman I want to marry in my life what God told me is the people will Bow Down but if I go with this woman and I'm a slave right here you see what going to happen to me he said no I cannot do something like he could not do because he knew the great the promise God gave him amen amen what is really we neglect so much the word even when the Bible says that there is a pillar of fire there is a cloud of witness that are observing us do you know that scripture we usually think that it's only those that are looking at us maybe it's my brother my sister if I se here somebody will see me so let me go far away and see in in in in secr because somebody not watching me here no no no no that's not what the script say there is a cloud of witnesses who went through the scripture in a hard situation there was RAB the Harlot you know the Harlot The Prostitute but she's the one that gave birth to Boaz she's somebody watching you also when you say oh my life has been abused or somebody took advantage of me but the god of RAB is the same God to take care of there is a witness watching you there is aab watching you when you see the woman at the [Applause] well those are references that you have look at the situation you go through when you look at Anna in the scripture was it's a cloud of witness and I can say I was in the same situation like child but when I look unto the Lord the lord always deliver children the Bible says that trouble always happen to the just men but the Lord deliver him out of all of them what does he mean my friend often trial comes to the meaning your sickness is only for your crisis is for a period of time your situation is for a period of time your difficulties is for a period of time there will be another period of time that you will beered that you will be blessed will be in Joy that's why the Bible says the Lord will deliver him out of all of them when they say always means always there is not a period of time amen amen blessed be the name of the [Applause] Lord God is able to find you David wherever you are there is a croud of witness that is there is a cloud watching you so look at all those Heroes what God did with them so you can put your faith into action there is a story here on the wings of snow brother BR preach that 19 65 I believe this is Brother Bram himself telling the story of what happened to him in Johannesburg brother say he met a young lady that was born blind I'm just going to show so you had this young lady was blind and she heard in television that's doing brother Bram meeting there was a man that was fixing shoes and he was blind and got that man was going from one Church to another but the people were rejecting him because he was glorify so the young lady heard that testimony through television so she took her father so they took a bus to go to brother baram's meeting when they were reach the place as since there was a big Crow and they had some racial problem at that time because there was a community for for black people and white people in South Africa so there was a big Crow lot of people so at that time when they came out of the bus the young lady got lost and she was blind left and went to pray for somebody that came ambulance so when brother Bram was making his way back suddenly brother Bram pump against the young woman that was planned looking for her father and and young uh lady say I'm sorry sir I'm blind I'm looking for my father and brother BR ask her questions let me read it a little bit brother ask her a question do you believe okay brother say Do you believe in this day when God will do something like that she said sir I listened to a religious program she said I'm a Christian she said I listen to the program I heard that that man up there was uh that was healed this morning morning that blond shoe CBL she said I heard the shoe he I'm heal I'm heal and brother Bram says do you believe that and brother Bram say she stood right there and then uh I'm trying to get where he is you h brother Bram said they throw him out of the church he was making such nose One Church to another with his heart or cane wiggling around running up and down the churches everyone in the city hollering I'm he I'm heal a blond shoe cobbler I say do you believe that and she stood there a little bit was kind of drizzling rain she [Music] said she stood there a little bit was kind of drizzling rain she [Music] said the lady says the young lady say sir I shall get if if you get me in where he is at then I shall find my father then I felt about like that you the word take me to brother Bram and I will find my father and brother Bram said he said maybe I am the one you looking for she said grab me by the Lael of the coat she said is you the Healer sir brother Bram said no sister but I am brother brother she say have mercy of poor old blond Fanny crossby that's somebody that brother and pray for while another thou are calling do not pass me by talking about the song if you did it for somebody do not pass me by because I'm in the same situation I'm in the same condition just like you tonight think of God on with that song listen to what brother BR says brother Bram is praying here he says I put my hands over her eyes listen to the prayer of brother BR because prayer changes according to the circumstances there are certain situation you don't need to pray there are people who were healed without prayer people that were forgiven without asking forgiveness to Jesus decision they took in their heart the way they already repented in their [Music] heart that if I can only touch the H of his that will take care of the situation so to receive something from God you need to have a revelation of your situation so do not limit God to one place because God can move in God will answer in many ways listen to this particular prayer for this situation brother Bram say dear Jesus one day an Old Rugged Cross coming bumping down the street the shoulder with blood running out of the little F body that was pking it fell under the Lord a colored man by the name of of came up and pick up the cross help him be I am sure you remember it father father one of his children he staggering here in dark I am sure you understand andly the woman to God I can see I can see I can see brother reminded God the good work that somebody did years ago just likeon of the brother said this daughter she is a descendant now you church this CL of witness that are here why can't you use this example for yourself [Applause] in that sermon that day on Calvary brother Bram says this brother Bram ask the question and brother ask her a question which color am I having and then she answer right now let me ask you a question somebody who never seen before how do they recognize color God Is Bigger God Is [Applause] Bigger says here paragraph 45 of that day on Calvary brother Bram say that sin did not start on Earth but sin started in heaven Luci Lucifer the devil was a condemned creature his Disobedience before he ever struck the Earth began in heaven where God put the Angels let me just keep a little bit because of time let me go to paragraph 54 it was such an important day it shook the world shook the world never like he never sh when Jesus died at Cal the SE question you who are here on Earth sin didn't start here but when Jesus came down dying at the cross he took care of the situation of sin all that was condemning you Jesus took it away he took it away Hallelujah the sinful world had a blackout the sun went down in the middle of the day he had a nervous prra the Rocks shook the mountains rank dead body bued from the grave theice was B was broke God put back in the hands of man a way back to what he was looking for amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord he had to weep no more in other word you don't have to weep anymore amen amen when he broke the backbone of the backbone of sin and sickness and BRS every Mortal being on the earth back into the presence of God with sins forgiven meaning cal2 there is a Highway made there is a tel there is a line bring every person in of that line bring every person in reach of that line meaning your sin your condition your problem whatsoever what Jesus accomplished at the cross there is a line that has estblished there is nothing that can condemn you there is so many things I'm trying to skip it let me skip a lot of things here Amen in 64 he say he broke the pron doors of Hell to every man that was shut up in this earth in the prisons fearing that when he died will be to him he opens those doors and let every captive Go free can you imagine when Jesus died they buried him The Story of Lazarus after 4 days Jesus rose him back up amen amen no matter the unbelief that Mary and Martha had in the but when Jesus explained to them they that at the resurrection my brother will rise again what I'm trying to say is even though they doubted just remember your doubt won't make Jesus doubt his word Jesus rose Lazarus despite the and when Jesus died himself and they bury him Jesus went to hell and he opened the cells door and he opened the prison do all the souls that were in prison can you imagine they said that the grave bur open maybe there were only bones left in those maybe there was nothing L about D and those people came back to life so why should you believe that why do you continue to believe that your situation won't have a solution why you keep looking at what you see look unto the one who sees things you don't see the one who will brings a name is the Lord Jesus [Applause] [Music] Christ in parag 6 what a priv t to know that you got the way now that day on Cal open up the way open up the way for all those PCH and sought for C gave it to you free free how would you turn it down you turn join a denomination amen amen I'm skipping things quickly amen the key to the door in 1962 paragraph 54 brother there is only one door to peace yeah my peace I give unto you is only one door to genuine peace you might think you got peace you acculate to buy your home you might accumulate enough to get your children have food to eat but you might have accumulated to be popular among people but when you sleep off your shoes at night and get ready to lay down there is only one thing can give you peace that is if you know you were dying that night there is only one peace and that is Jesus Jesus is the peace he is our peace blessed be the name of the Lord I'm skipping a lot of things here uh let me I'm going to do everything to lay down let me conclude with this so I won't keep you longer saying that your situation is under control before you enter into a trial God is not surprised and God already know when you're going to come out of that trial and God won't be surprised when you but only trust in him amen amen trust in him God told Joshua you the one that will bring the children of Israel in the prois and to take off when he spoke to Joshua God never left Joshua alone you will notice that when facing Jericho it was God that took care of the situation all they did was going around the city just going around and and Jer was brought down it's true you got fight that you have to fight and but there are some of them you don't need to fight and only God can fight those for you and when you are in the middle of just remember you are not alone when he told josua he said he never left Joshua even before Jordan he never forua he told you're the one that will fight with Medan when God say go the going of God means let's go because he will go with you God will never let you alone he never left Moses he sent Moses to deliver Israel he said I heard and I came down and even in front of the righted sea when Moses stretch the road but it was the eyes of God that look at the SE and the SE got Fe so always trust the Lord take the promises of God and present them unto him every trial that come in your life present the word of God no matter what you did in Roman 8: who shall condemn God elect amen amen who shall lay charge upon God El it's not because we are the way we are because in this flesh God already SP God already told us we are but you shall fall like princess meaning there is a part of this body that is bring down to a lot of trouble so always trust the Lord if you see God blessing someone just know that yours is on the way you just no matter you might have the same situation but he a god of variety he knows how to deal with each one individ I'm going to show you Moses Moses was before the Red Sea he faced the Red Sea he was an obstacle behind him Pharaoh in front of him never regretted he never murmured he had trust in the Lord God told him he told him raise the road and then the he Pard look at that same whenu the before the what happened there God told Joshua maybe he could have taken the rooses to do that off but at that time take the of the of the Prest meaning that the priest were walking unconscience of the of the of the and the Jordan parted together you see what I'm saying and when Elijah El came I thought they're going to do the same thing maybe the road of maybe look for so that a priest can walk but at that point they took the man they took the man and struck the the situation change but one day greatest to the when he was facing water thought maybe he would take the maybe use theu [Applause] he's more he's going through upon your situation upon your situation do it he can do it he's he look at look Ates look at no matter the problem Jesus and he will walk the same way he walk upon the Water he will walk upon your problem God bless [Applause] you praise God Amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen let's give the Lord a big clap of Glory what a landing my friend every situation is specific with Moses he was the road with Joshua he was the feet of the priest with Elijah and Elisha he was the mentor but with the master of the world he just walk upon him what is your situation tonight what is your problem tonight the master is still there the same yesterday today and forever let's give him a big clap again and I'm glad he's the god of variety because he will conf use the devil if he's waiting for this weapon he open another weapon and he can do even something he never done before and he can start a new Bible with you because we are written a people read from all men so he can do more than what is written in the Bible because the Bible say nothing is impossible to God the Bible say there are many miracle that Jesus did that are not written right here so don't limit God to what is here have a big faith God can do Beyond something that never happened before let me ask you a question the Bible say there are many things many miracle that Jesus did that are not written here who can tell me what it is since you don't know don't limit me I can believe whatever I want to believe because you are not there so whatever the spirit put in my heart to believe he belongs to me he's a god of paradox no matter how big the situation is God is able to change it bow your head and talk to him for a few minutes [Music] [Music] oh thank you [Music] Lord oh the spirit don't speak like this for nothing somebody's going through something so talk to him about your situation don't leave this church with it leave everything here and go free because Calvary established the line it's a free line covered by the blood of the Lamb meaning your prayer can go straight to his
