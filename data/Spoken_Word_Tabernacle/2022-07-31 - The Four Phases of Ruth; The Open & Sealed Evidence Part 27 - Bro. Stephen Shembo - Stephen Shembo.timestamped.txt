[56:58] understand that later
[57:01] Genesis chapter 2. amen
[57:06] Oh Glory to God
[57:11] verse 20 Adam gave names to all Qatar
[57:17] who was giving names
[57:19] Adam and to the fowl of the air and to
[57:24] every beast of the field
[57:26] but for Adam
[57:29] everybody okay there was not found a
[57:33] help meet in other words suitable that
[57:37] feed him for him
[57:39] everybody okay so everything was paid
[57:42] two two two when Adam look he said your
[57:46] name is this this is the name this is
[57:48] the name this is the name next this is
[57:50] the name next no problem amen
[57:53] verse 21 and the Lord God will stop here
[57:56] last Sunday uh the previous Sunday and
[57:59] the Lord God calls a deep sleep to fall
[58:03] upon Adam
[58:07] thank you
[58:10] yes among
[58:13] the
[58:16] cuddle
[58:18] and the foul and the Beast that Adam was
[58:23] giving them the serpent was there
[58:31] everybody okay
[58:32] So Adam gave the serpent the name
[58:35] serpent
[58:38] [Music]
[58:41] [Laughter]
[58:45] Adam named The Serpent
[58:51] all right
[58:52] glory to God
[58:55] one service by the okargo is big amen
[58:59] verse 21 and the Lord God calls a deep
[59:02] sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and
[59:06] he took one of his ribs
[59:10] not to
[59:12] one and close up the flesh he never left
[59:16] it open
[59:19] instead thereof
[59:21] let me skip that one leave it alone and
[59:24] the rib which the Lord God has taken
[59:27] from man everybody okay
[59:29] made here
[59:33] why do we call her woman
[59:36] who gave her the name woman
[59:39] who was giving the name to every
[59:41] creature
[59:44] Adam was not giving the name by his
[59:46] intellect
[59:48] everybody okay
[59:51] verse 22 and the rib which the Lord God
[59:54] had taken from man made he a woman
[59:58] and brought her to the man
[1:00:02] amen so a woman must be brought into the
[1:00:05] marriage that's why the woman entered
[1:00:07] with
[1:00:09] the garden
[1:00:10] because God walked his own daughter
[1:00:20] [Music]
[1:00:22] to the opening of the seals amen and
[1:00:26] Adam saying this is now born of my bones
[1:00:30] young people understand this and Flesh
[1:00:34] of My Flesh
[1:00:36] she shall be called water
[1:00:39] who gave the name woman
[1:00:44] So Adam named
[1:00:48] the woman
[1:00:53] amen so if you ask Adam who is beside
[1:00:57] you Adam must say woman
[1:01:02] Adam didn't say Eve
[1:01:05] [Music]
[1:01:07] I have to go slowly because where I'm
[1:01:10] gonna dig it different but here Adam was
[1:01:14] not saying Eve no he was calling her
[1:01:16] woman
[1:01:18] amen everybody okay Adam call woman
[1:01:23] because she was taken out of the water
[1:01:27] so a woman means water taken out of her
[1:01:31] man any question
[1:01:33] it's continued
[1:01:35] therefore shall a man leave his water
[1:01:40] and his water where is the mother of
[1:01:43] Adam
[1:01:46] I am now
[1:01:48] I hope you are training this church to
[1:01:51] know how to read the message and to read
[1:01:54] the scripture you don't read that's why
[1:01:57] you heard about the brand I'm saying you
[1:01:58] don't read scripture like a newspaper
[1:02:00] anybody here who was the father of Adam
[1:02:03] God but who was the mother of Adam
[1:02:09] let me leave it as we're coming down I
[1:02:12] know where I'm gonna head amen so God is
[1:02:16] also mother
[1:02:21] don't worry about it put it on the Shelf
[1:02:24] we will pick it up down the road there
[1:02:26] amen therefore shall a man leave his
[1:02:29] father and his mother and shall cling to
[1:02:33] his all right
[1:02:35] and there shall be one flesh everybody
[1:02:38] okay
[1:02:40] no problem
[1:02:41] do you see any things spoken about the
[1:02:44] serpent here
[1:02:47] verse 25 and they were both naked
[1:02:52] the man and his wife and were not water
[1:02:55] so this woman
[1:02:58] even though she was married she was
[1:03:01] still a virgin
[1:03:08] everybody okay foreign
[1:03:14] you okay
[1:03:16] as soon as the created Eve
[1:03:21] the scripture mention a beast the
[1:03:26] scripture never mentioned a lion
[1:03:28] they just say the Beast and the cuddle
[1:03:31] they didn't say there is an elephant
[1:03:33] there we know the elephant was there but
[1:03:36] they pull a certain Beast
[1:03:38] everybody okay now the serpent was more
[1:03:42] saddle
[1:03:44] we're gonna come back to this according
[1:03:47] to Genesis chapter 3
[1:03:50] everybody here
[1:03:51] verse 1 we got a beast that is called a
[1:03:56] serpent
[1:03:57] his characteristic he was more saddle
[1:04:02] what does he mean
[1:04:05] anybody care
[1:04:07] he was sadder than any Beast they didn't
[1:04:11] say sadder than any foul
[1:04:15] the Bible didn't say sadder than any
[1:04:19] fish
[1:04:21] anybody here the Bible didn't say he was
[1:04:24] served out more than any reptile
[1:04:27] the Bible said he was more sadder than
[1:04:30] any so his category is what
[1:04:34] so this serpent is a beast
[1:04:39] here
[1:04:43] praise God
[1:04:45] he said he's more sadder than any beast
[1:04:48] of the field which the Lord Our God has
[1:04:51] made so God created a beast
[1:05:00] God did not create a snake
[1:05:09] everybody okay
[1:05:11] originally he was a beast
[1:05:14] not a snake
[1:05:17] are your eyes open
[1:05:21] our eyes open
[1:05:25] anybody here
[1:05:26] God never created the eve
[1:05:33] hey everybody okay God created the woman
[1:05:38] they'll name Eve came later
[1:05:43] amen
[1:05:44] amen
[1:05:46] hey everybody okay
[1:05:49] jump to verse 20 then we come back on
[1:05:51] one
[1:05:52] so it makes sense and Adam called his
[1:05:56] wife name water
[1:05:57] I thought he already
[1:06:02] why did he give his wife a name the
[1:06:07] second time
[1:06:12] everybody okay if because so there is a
[1:06:17] reason why Eve have to be given a name
[1:06:22] different than her first name
[1:06:25] and the reason is because everybody okay
[1:06:28] she was the mother of water
[1:06:31] [Music]
[1:06:34] what does he mean the mother of all
[1:06:37] living
[1:06:40] the children are your children why do
[1:06:43] you say my wife is the mother of all
[1:06:45] living
[1:06:51] amen if you ask my wife those children
[1:06:54] they're mine
[1:06:56] everybody here so why do you have to say
[1:06:58] that you see those those children are
[1:07:01] all those children belongs to my wife
[1:07:09] not belong to me Adam didn't say that
[1:07:12] they belonged to the woman
[1:07:14] [Music]
[1:07:19] brother Branham says this he said Adam
[1:07:22] call his wife Eve because she was the
[1:07:25] mother of all living that was after this
[1:07:29] beguiling has already took ready
[1:07:34] everybody okay brother born I'm saying
[1:07:37] now let me now let this be known
[1:07:40] scripture does not play with words
[1:07:44] this is what I want you to understand
[1:07:46] all along you should have caught that in
[1:07:49] this church every I have even a karma in
[1:07:52] a scripture means something everybody
[1:07:55] here even a punctuation means something
[1:07:58] a number means something
[1:08:00] [Music]
[1:08:03] a conjunction means something
[1:08:08] whatever is in the record is there for
[1:08:12] the anointed eyes to water
[1:08:16] so if you're not anointed you're going
[1:08:18] to be wondering why are we coming up
[1:08:20] with those stuff
[1:08:24] how do you see it
[1:08:29] everybody here it is there for us
[1:08:33] in that word it says in Genesis 3 20 and
[1:08:37] Adam called his wife name Eve because
[1:08:40] she was the mother of all but no
[1:08:43] scripture ever says that Adam is the
[1:08:46] father of all living
[1:08:51] [Music]
[1:08:54] if there is not this connotation to be
[1:08:58] placed upon Genesis 3 20. why would he
[1:09:01] be mentioned that Eve is the mother of
[1:09:05] all and no word say about Adam the fact
[1:09:09] is that though Eve was the mother of all
[1:09:12] living Adam was not the father of water
[1:09:18] not Adam
[1:09:23] now let's go back to three
[1:09:27] what let's pray because I'm already
[1:09:29] leaving the airport
[1:09:32] Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for
[1:09:35] your grace your love your mercy and for
[1:09:37] everything you have been doing for us
[1:09:39] father we are committing this service
[1:09:41] again unto their hand Lord may you move
[1:09:43] me completely out of the way may you
[1:09:46] come down and speak to your children may
[1:09:48] you anoint us in a special way so that
[1:09:51] we can grasp the mind of the spirit
[1:09:53] father touch us and heal those that are
[1:09:56] sick open our eyes so that we can be
[1:09:59] anointed this morning to see what the
[1:10:01] spirit one has to see father Lord we
[1:10:04] rebuke every demonic spirit away from us
[1:10:06] and commit everything unto their hand in
[1:10:09] the name of Jesus Christ amen everybody
[1:10:13] okay verse 3 now now the serpent was
[1:10:16] more sad we need to see what it means
[1:10:19] then any beast of the field which the
[1:10:22] Lord God has made and he said to the
[1:10:25] woman so he was not just a beast but he
[1:10:29] was a beast that could talk
[1:10:31] [Music]
[1:10:35] everybody okay
[1:10:37] no problem we will get it down the road
[1:10:39] amen he says yeah to the woman
[1:10:44] he says to the woman yeah God has God
[1:10:48] said You shall not eat of every tree of
[1:10:51] the water
[1:10:52] so the same here in Genesis 3 open up
[1:10:58] between the serpent
[1:11:04] but here and the woman
[1:11:10] not the serpent and Eve
[1:11:15] amen the serpent
[1:11:18] and a woman and this serpent is a beast
[1:11:25] hey better care so the sin opened up
[1:11:29] between a beast and a woman
[1:11:35] everybody okay
[1:11:37] glory to God
[1:11:41] let's go to chapter verse 5.
[1:11:48] skipping those for God does know that in
[1:11:52] the day you eat thereof then your eyes
[1:11:56] shall be watered
[1:11:57] and you shall be as
[1:12:00] knowing good and in other words being
[1:12:03] able to discern
[1:12:07] everybody here
[1:12:08] and the woman saw that the tree was good
[1:12:12] for food
[1:12:13] and that he was pleasant to the eyes
[1:12:16] and the tree to be desired to make one
[1:12:20] water
[1:12:21] so this best
[1:12:25] has
[1:12:27] presented to Eve our wisdom
[1:12:35] but here or something that can make Eve
[1:12:39] wise
[1:12:45] you okay
[1:12:46] you remember the Sunday
[1:12:49] eyes virgin

[1:13:00] it and gave also to her husband with her
[1:13:03] and he did it and the eyes of both of
[1:13:07] them were open and they knew that they
[1:13:11] were water
[1:13:12] she knew after she ate the fruit
[1:13:16] not before anybody here remember in
[1:13:19] Genesis through uh 2 25 they were naked
[1:13:22] they were nourishing everybody care and
[1:13:25] they saw fig leaves together because now
[1:13:28] they shame

[1:14:37] layer and you can pick up something and
[1:14:40] everybody can pick that up but if you

[1:16:33] she even waved my hand God bless you

[1:16:37] Daniel 12 verse 7.
[1:16:41] if I have a church full of them I'm fine
[1:16:45] they don't have headache they need food
[1:16:47] and they start jumping
[1:16:52] easy life
[1:16:55] [Music]
[1:16:56] Daniel 12 7 if you dare you can say Amen
[1:17:00] and I heard the Man Clothing line and
[1:17:08] then your 12 is revelation 10. amen and
[1:17:13] when he had when he held up his right
[1:17:16] hand and left hand to Heaven revelation
[1:17:19] 10. and so by him that liveth forever
[1:17:22] Revelation 10 that it shall be for a
[1:17:26] time times and half what does that mean
[1:17:31] and when he shall have accomplished to
[1:17:35] scatter the power of the Holy people all
[1:17:37] these things shall be finished
[1:17:40] and I heard me Daniel
[1:17:44] but I understood
[1:17:47] so there is a hearing of word but there
[1:17:52] is an understanding of what you're
[1:17:55] hearing
[1:17:58] come back
[1:18:00] everybody here but when John heard the
[1:18:04] Thunders
[1:18:06] and understood the pandas
[1:18:13] everybody here
[1:18:15] I've heard but I understood not then say
[1:18:19] the eye oh my Lord Capital LOD so that
[1:18:23] person we know who is capital capital
[1:18:27] l-o-r-d oh my Lord what shall not be the
[1:18:31] end of these things amen
[1:18:35] and he said go your way Daniel this is
[1:18:38] not your time for the word our water
[1:18:42] [Music]
[1:18:44] that's why you cannot understand them
[1:18:48] everybody here
[1:18:50] and they are water
[1:18:52] until water
[1:18:53] [Music]
[1:18:57] everybody here
[1:18:58] if this world are closed up and seal
[1:19:03] until the time of the end
[1:19:06] when Paul came on the scene and Paul
[1:19:09] began to preach was that the end time do
[1:19:13] you expect Paul to understand that
[1:19:18] do you expect Luther to understand that
[1:19:21] do you expect Wesley to understand that
[1:19:26] [Music]
[1:19:31] everybody here hallelujah he said many
[1:19:35] shall be water
[1:19:37] so what was spoken there purifies as
[1:19:40] people
[1:19:41] [Music]
[1:19:44] it is not a sanctification of the
[1:19:47] holiness
[1:19:49] [Music]
[1:19:51] because they deviated and went to
[1:19:55] armenianism
[1:19:57] they miss it
[1:20:00] and brother Branham said there was still
[1:20:02] a mysterious part of it that Wesley
[1:20:04] didn't catch it
[1:20:07] everybody okay he says it shall be
[1:20:10] purified and made water
[1:20:14] so whoever understand this thing it will
[1:20:18] purify you
[1:20:21] these things that are still when you
[1:20:24] understand them they're gonna purify you
[1:20:27] do you see why even preacher attacked
[1:20:30] the seals
[1:20:32] blocking your purification
[1:20:36] what is supposed to make you white they
[1:20:40] are telling you that you don't have to
[1:20:42] preach those Mysteries
[1:20:46] how can you be white without the silver
[1:20:56] bringing denominational idea into the
[1:21:00] message
[1:21:01] everybody here they shall be purified
[1:21:04] and made water
[1:21:06] and do water
[1:21:08] that's why it's not letting you alone
[1:21:11] as soon as you hear it you begin to
[1:21:13] trouble
[1:21:15] until you surrender
[1:21:20] everybody
[1:21:21] the more stubborn you are the more
[1:21:25] powerful you make the message
[1:21:29] but here the more stubborn you are
[1:21:32] toward the message the more it becomes
[1:21:34] powerful
[1:21:37] until it will break you
[1:21:41] except if you are the seed of the
[1:21:43] serpent
[1:21:44] then it will let you go
[1:21:48] hey everybody Kia
[1:21:50] but the wicked shall do water
[1:21:55] so you hearing that and you continue to
[1:21:58] do wickedly
[1:22:00] did you hear me you are hearing those
[1:22:03] Mysteries but your life is not changing
[1:22:10] but here
[1:22:12] and none of the wicked shall water so
[1:22:16] even though the seals are broken
[1:22:20] if your origin is wrong you will never
[1:22:24] understand the field
[1:22:26] even if you eat them
[1:22:30] [Music]
[1:22:36] why is the spirit saying to him the
[1:22:38] heaven here
[1:22:40] which ear this one
[1:22:45] everybody okay
[1:22:46] glory to God but the water
[1:22:52] who's gonna the world shall do water
[1:22:56] who's gonna understand
[1:22:58] how many children did we have
[1:23:01] five water
[1:23:05] what made them wise
[1:23:07] [Music]
[1:23:10] those are the ones they're gonna
[1:23:12] understand
[1:23:14] [Applause]
[1:23:17] everybody here what makes them
[1:23:19] understand is the second Oiler
[1:23:22] amen
[1:23:24] [Music]
[1:23:28] Revelation 10 verse 1 the Bible say and
[1:23:32] I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[1:23:34] from
[1:23:35] glove with a cloud
[1:23:38] it's right there and a rainbow was upon
[1:23:41] his head
[1:23:42] and his face was as he were there and
[1:23:45] his water the problem we are dealing
[1:23:48] with since that Sunday is the feet they
[1:23:52] are not feet of brass but they are feet
[1:23:54] of pillars of water
[1:23:56] why are they Pillar of Fire
[1:24:01] amen
[1:24:02] and he had in his hand we know which
[1:24:06] hand you remember
[1:24:08] or the right hand he had in his hand a
[1:24:11] little book that is what
[1:24:13] he was closed before and he set his
[1:24:16] right foot upon water so it's not just
[1:24:19] feet of Pillar of Fire but the right one
[1:24:23] is upon the sea so there is a connection
[1:24:26] between the sea it is not in the sea
[1:24:33] anybody here
[1:24:35] because we know somebody who walk on the
[1:24:38] sea
[1:24:40] all right
[1:24:42] everybody here everybody here he could
[1:24:45] walk on the water
[1:24:48] but here so his foot is upon the sea and
[1:24:53] another foot is upon the Water why did
[1:24:57] this Angel make made sure that the two
[1:25:01] feet are in those two places
[1:25:04] and not the feet of brass
[1:25:07] there must be pillars of fire everybody
[1:25:10] okay and he headed his render a little
[1:25:14] book open and he set his right foot upon
[1:25:16] the sea and his left foot upon the Earth
[1:25:18] and he cried with a loud water us went
[1:25:22] around a lion roar if we went through
[1:25:24] this and when he cried what happened
[1:25:28] so they cry have seven tanners
[1:25:33] everybody here and when the seven
[1:25:35] Thunders had ordered the voice I was
[1:25:38] about to do water for you to write you
[1:25:41] must understand what you are healing
[1:25:47] amen and I heard the voice from Heaven
[1:25:50] saying unto me
[1:25:52] [Music]
[1:25:53] those things which the Thunder would eat
[1:25:56] water
[1:25:57] and do water
[1:26:00] so the seals
[1:26:05] everybody the seals hold
[1:26:10] everybody here
[1:26:11] they are written
[1:26:16] spoken
[1:26:19] [Music]
[1:26:20] Thunders
[1:26:23] in my heart I'm pulling that from the
[1:26:27] Bible not only done there's seven
[1:26:30] thunders of God
[1:26:36] everybody
[1:26:37] the only way for you to know what the
[1:26:40] Thunder spoken because the Thunder are
[1:26:44] not written
[1:26:47] anybody here so if you pick up this Baba
[1:26:51] and you begin to read the Bible you
[1:26:54] don't see Thunders that's it
[1:26:57] by the time they are there
[1:27:00] [Music]
[1:27:04] the Thunder are not in leather form
[1:27:10] the Thunder are in the Bible in a silver
[1:27:14] format
[1:27:20] everybody here so right here we can
[1:27:23] understand now that the Bible has a part
[1:27:27] that is written
[1:27:29] and the part that is Unwritten
[1:27:34] [Music]
[1:27:37] everybody here
[1:27:41] you know what is Unwritten
[1:27:47] the written part I have my Bible you
[1:27:50] have your Bible we can all verify how do
[1:27:53] we verify the unwritten partner
[1:27:57] [Music]
[1:28:01] my subject this morning is the four
[1:28:05] phases of roof the second oil and the
[1:28:09] Beast
[1:28:13] everybody okay the second oil and the
[1:28:16] Beast not the first one but the second
[1:28:18] oil and the Beast but here in our
[1:28:23] journey in the Tabernacle we are already
[1:28:26] in the hottest where roof is in the
[1:28:29] trashing form everybody here then on the
[1:28:33] Sunday that follow we found out that
[1:28:36] according to Jeremiah 32
[1:28:39] verse 11 that when you purchase a field
[1:28:43] body caliber you got to bring you one
[1:28:45] when you purchase a field they give you
[1:28:48] the tattered
[1:28:53] anybody care
[1:28:55] they give you a title did
[1:28:58] and this title did according to Jeremiah
[1:29:02] have two parts
[1:29:05] everybody okay glory to God the Bible
[1:29:09] says so I took the evidence of the
[1:29:13] purchase the evidence of the purchase is
[1:29:17] another name for the tattered
[1:29:20] everything
[1:29:22] everybody care because it shows that he
[1:29:25] belongs to you you purchase something
[1:29:27] you got the title everybody because
[1:29:30] Jeremiah took money 17 shekels and gave
[1:29:33] it and they gave him the title everybody
[1:29:35] here but this evidence have two part
[1:29:42] the Bible said buff
[1:29:44] that which was
[1:29:47] according to the law in the custom and
[1:29:49] that which was
[1:29:51] so the doctor did in the scripture have
[1:29:56] a part that is open
[1:29:58] and a part that is sealed everybody
[1:30:02] cares so far
[1:30:04] the Bible continues again in Jeremiah
[1:30:07] that that saved the Lord of hosts the
[1:30:11] god of Israel take these evidences
[1:30:15] the reason why it's plural because it's
[1:30:18] two of them one is open one itself take
[1:30:22] these evidences
[1:30:24] buff which is Hill
[1:30:26] and this evidence if you notice they say
[1:30:30] take these evidences plural because it's
[1:30:33] true
[1:30:34] this evidence of purchase one
[1:30:37] everybody okay it is one but two part
[1:30:41] everybody okay buff which is sealed and
[1:30:45] this evidence which is open and put them
[1:30:48] in water
[1:30:50] what does it mean to put it in a vessel
[1:30:53] that is made out of Earth
[1:30:57] brother bottom says this in Gabriel's
[1:31:00] instruction he says we pick up the
[1:31:03] Scrolls how that this Crow was handed to
[1:31:07] his hand how that Jeremiah where we read
[1:31:10] in Jeremiah 32 verse 6 his cousin you
[1:31:14] remember that Sunday Hannah Neil was
[1:31:18] left with some hair and they were going
[1:31:20] into captivity which we are going into
[1:31:23] with him this morning captivity and he
[1:31:27] was kept in a freely vessel
[1:31:30] showing it shows where the power of God
[1:31:35] everybody okay and the scroll and the
[1:31:39] secret of God is known
[1:31:42] in the water
[1:31:46] so brother Branham saying when they took
[1:31:48] this evidence and they put it in the
[1:31:51] Earthly vessel it is showing that the
[1:31:55] way you understand the Tata did you
[1:31:59] understand the thought of deed of God in
[1:32:02] your heart
[1:32:03] amen it is made known in the heart but
[1:32:09] here our plane of redemption in the
[1:32:12] title did the same being kept in Earthly
[1:32:15] versus plural what is it Jesus name and
[1:32:19] the water so this revelation of the name
[1:32:22] of Jesus Christ must be made known in
[1:32:26] the heart not in the head
[1:32:31] Paul says this for God who commanded
[1:32:36] then lied to shine out of Darkness had
[1:32:40] shine in our
[1:32:42] everybody okay
[1:32:43] why to give the light of the knowledge
[1:32:48] of the glory of God in the face of Jesus
[1:32:52] Christ
[1:32:52] but we have this treasure
[1:32:56] everybody okay in Earthly
[1:32:59] vessel that's the Excellency of the
[1:33:02] power might be of God and none of us so
[1:33:05] the revelation of God is kept in the
[1:33:09] heart
[1:33:11] Paul continues here he says that the god
[1:33:15] of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of
[1:33:18] Glory may give unto you the spirit of
[1:33:22] water and water
[1:33:24] you understand now
[1:33:27] the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in
[1:33:31] the knowledge of water while that the
[1:33:34] eyes of water
[1:33:36] do you understand with your ears or you
[1:33:39] understand with your eyes
[1:33:42] how do we understand with our ears
[1:33:46] right but the Bible say you are
[1:33:49] understanding with the eyes how can and
[1:33:53] I understand
[1:33:58] anointed eyes
[1:34:00] everybody here the eye of your
[1:34:03] understanding be what
[1:34:05] that you may know when your eyes are
[1:34:09] open you understand by your heart
[1:34:15] opened the Eyes of My Heart everybody

[1:34:22] what is the hope of his calling and what
[1:34:25] is the riches of the glory of his
[1:34:27] inheritance in water so we understand
[1:34:30] brother Branham continues here he says
[1:34:33] Jeremiah said this girl must be kept as
[1:34:37] you read it here he shall say he must be
[1:34:39] kept in a free vessel see Oh What a
[1:34:43] Beautiful Things there it could be he
[1:34:45] could talk about it a while
[1:34:47] this scroll was kept in a Netflix vessel
[1:34:51] a vessel that once became
[1:34:54] glory and did water and did water
[1:34:58] and kept in every vessel until
[1:35:02] of water
[1:35:04] so who was the vessels that became flesh
[1:35:07] that died then rose again his name is
[1:35:10] who
[1:35:11] that's why in Revelation 1 1 there was a
[1:35:15] revelation of Jesus Christ that was
[1:35:17] never unfolded before
[1:35:19] [Music]
[1:35:21] open revelation
[1:35:31] everybody here Revelation chapter one
[1:35:33] verse one you dare you can say Amen the
[1:35:36] revelation of who
[1:35:38] which God gave to Adam after his
[1:35:41] resurrection there was still a
[1:35:44] revelation of Jesus Christ that was not
[1:35:46] me known to men
[1:35:51] but here because that Revelation was
[1:35:54] kept in a newly vessel he was left
[1:36:07] things which must shortly come to pass
[1:36:10] and his son and signify it by water
[1:36:15] to his servant who so when Jesus Christ
[1:36:18] died and rose again he heard the
[1:36:22] revelation
[1:36:25] everybody here
[1:36:27] because when they asked him about his
[1:36:30] coming he said I don't know
[1:36:33] I don't know about my coming
[1:36:35] that one only The Who
[1:36:38] the father knows about him the
[1:36:41] revelation of my coming
[1:36:43] so only giving to them but go back again
[1:36:47] to verse one the revelation of who
[1:36:51] which who gave him
[1:36:53] God who now the father gave him that
[1:36:57] revelation
[1:36:58] [Music]
[1:37:05] everybody okay I'm still climbing my

[1:37:29] evidence what does he mean
[1:37:33] go to the Book of Joshua
[1:37:39] because playing terms in the message is
[1:37:42] not good
[1:37:46] we are not in the hour of ignorance
[1:37:49] we gotta know what we are believing
[1:37:53] everybody here
[1:37:55] what does he mean by open evidence and
[1:37:59] close or seal evidence what does he mean
[1:38:02] what are you trying to say
[1:38:05] number one I'm not the one saying it's
[1:38:07] the scripture
[1:38:10] number two what does he mean
[1:38:13] you there
[1:38:14] Joshua chapter 4 verse 1. give me time I
[1:38:18] gotta clam this slowly
[1:38:20] and he came to pass when all the people
[1:38:23] were clean Passover in other words they
[1:38:26] cross they finish Crossing Jordan that
[1:38:30] the Lord spoke to Joshua
[1:38:32] God taught Israel to prepare they're
[1:38:36] going to Cross Jordan not the Red Sea
[1:38:39] they are Crossing Jordan with Joshua but
[1:38:42] here God opened the Jordan River
[1:38:45] everybody here the priests who are
[1:38:48] carrying the ark we went through this on
[1:38:50] the mystery of the same and the approach
[1:38:52] as soon as the feet
[1:38:56] everybody okay you remember the feet you
[1:38:59] remember where roof was sleeping
[1:39:03] but here as soon as the feet of the
[1:39:07] prince Touch the Water Jordan open up
[1:39:11] and the priest went and stood in the
[1:39:15] middle of Jordan
[1:39:16] somewhere
[1:39:18] why
[1:39:21] we okay
[1:39:22] keep your seatbelt I'm still climbing

[1:39:46] out of the place where the water
[1:39:52] everybody okay remember we're on the
[1:39:55] feet of pillars of Fire so when the
[1:39:58] priests were going to Jordan the priests
[1:40:01] were moving
[1:40:02] and they reached the middle of Jordan
[1:40:05] and they stop
[1:40:07] they didn't stop just like that
[1:40:10] come on because remember the four
[1:40:13] priests were the wheels of the Caribbean

[2:10:33] they didn't go any car they didn't cross
[2:10:36] the Jordan in any direction no they made
[2:10:40] sure they're coming from Jericho and
[2:10:43] they land Jericho with gilga
[2:10:45] because there is something in the water
[2:10:50] nobody opened that before
[2:10:53] since Joshua
[2:10:55] up to now nobody opened that
[2:10:59] everybody was only talking about the
[2:11:02] open Stone
[2:11:05] everybody was preaching about the open
[2:11:08] Stone
[2:11:09] everybody was prophesying about the open
[2:11:12] Sun by this time no more the open Stone
[2:11:18] this time we must open the Jordan we
[2:11:23] must go in the Jordan we must see the
[2:11:27] evidence that was sealed
[2:11:34] glory to God you ready
[2:11:38] and Elijah took his water
[2:11:41] his ministry remember when Samuel came
[2:11:45] the witch offenders say I see an old man
[2:11:49] with his
[2:11:50] his ministry is still there the prophet
[2:11:52] robe
[2:11:53] about here
[2:11:55] that's why when he left
[2:11:57] he took the mentor
[2:11:59] and left it to Elijah because Elijah
[2:12:02] must continue Revelation 10 8 must
[2:12:06] continue after seven
[2:12:08] [Applause]
[2:12:10] but here you cannot go with the ministry
[2:12:14] the one staying behind that's why I say
[2:12:17] you can kill the messenger but you
[2:12:19] cannot kill the message
[2:12:21] [Music]
[2:12:25] me of the sin but the mentor can go back
[2:12:29] but here and Elijah took his water
[2:12:34] everybody here
[2:12:35] and he wrap it together
[2:12:39] everybody here
[2:12:40] and he smoked the waters
[2:12:42] [Music]
[2:12:44] Jordan means what
[2:12:47] means what
[2:12:49] death death means water
[2:12:52] so the water of Jordan at the water off
[2:12:59] [Music]
[2:13:04] the go listen to the sermon the water of
[2:13:07] Separation everybody here so he's smart
[2:13:10] the word of Jordan and they were divided
[2:13:13] how
[2:13:15] [Music]
[2:13:17] after Joshua the first one
[2:13:20] that struck this water and open it it's
[2:13:25] then anointing of Elijah
[2:13:27] so Elijah can do two things
[2:13:30] Elijah can turn the heart of the
[2:13:34] children to the father by repairing the
[2:13:37] storm Elijah also can part the water to
[2:13:41] reveal the mystery that was sealed
[2:13:46] all these years
[2:13:49] under there and it's those Mysteries
[2:13:53] that literally that is the true
[2:13:57] Vindication
[2:13:58] [Music]
[2:14:01] repairing the altar is a Vindication but
[2:14:05] opening Jordan is more than a
[2:14:08] vindication
[2:14:10] [Applause]
[2:14:10] [Music]
[2:14:12] that's why the opening is literally true
[2:14:17] that's what will turn the heart of the
[2:14:19] children back
[2:14:22] glory to God
[2:14:24] he divided the water here and there and
[2:14:27] they too went over in water
[2:14:30] what do you think Elijah saw in the
[2:14:32] middle

[2:24:20] and because he was open
[2:24:23] how many version of the Bible do you
[2:24:25] have
[2:24:27] [Music]
[2:24:28] New International Version do
[2:24:31] the disease version this version this
[2:24:35] version this version why the
[2:24:37] manipulation of a man
[2:24:39] because it was an open
[2:24:42] [Music]
[2:24:51] Meet The Seer the awakened word
[2:24:55] [Applause]
[2:24:57] [Music]
[2:24:59] anybody here
[2:25:00] brother Branham say it is my belief I
[2:25:03] believe that the Bible has every answer
[2:25:06] for every age
[2:25:07] you're already what
[2:25:09] yeah
[2:25:10] everybody can interpret the way they
[2:25:12] want
[2:25:14] everybody here for the believer of that
[2:25:16] age I believe that everything that we
[2:25:19] have need of is written right here just
[2:25:22] need to be interpreted by the
[2:25:25] I don't believe that any man on the
[2:25:27] Earth has a right to put his own
[2:25:31] but what happened
[2:25:33] why because he was open
[2:25:38] but in Revelation 5
[2:25:40] the Bible said I saw in the right hand
[2:25:43] you remember that of him that sat upon
[2:25:46] the throne and what
[2:25:48] written where
[2:25:55] written where
[2:25:57] Within
[2:25:59] the riding was waiting sad and
[2:26:05] on there
[2:26:07] filled with water
[2:26:17] so the Bible now have two parts
[2:26:23] everybody here there is a written part
[2:26:27] and there is a seal part or a raping
[2:26:31] part
[2:26:34] Hallelujah there is writing on the
[2:26:39] inside of the book
[2:26:41] but
[2:26:42] the back side had sevens here on the
[2:26:46] back of it that was
[2:26:49] that was not written in there
[2:26:55] the Bible have two evidences
[2:26:59] the written portion and the written
[2:27:02] portion the title did have two evidence
[2:27:05] they open evidence and they see loving
[2:27:09] them they open everybody can play with
[2:27:11] him everybody can erase it everybody can
[2:27:14] do what they want to do the son of
[2:27:16] Jordan have two evidences they open
[2:27:18] evidence and there she live with us
[2:27:23] glory to God he says now remember it was
[2:27:28] not written in the book and in the days
[2:27:31] of the voice of the seven angels all
[2:27:35] this mystery that is written within
[2:27:38] should be what
[2:27:40] it should be taken care of in that day
[2:27:45] them is the time for the seven
[2:27:49] voices of Revelation what
[2:27:52] to be water when this book is finished
[2:27:56] there is only one thing left that is the
[2:27:59] seven mysterious voices of water
[2:28:03] [Music]
[2:28:06] that was wrought on there
[2:28:10] that John was water so you can preach
[2:28:14] the Babylon you want
[2:28:16] and why
[2:28:18] why
[2:28:20] not Vindication is for you to open what
[2:28:25] was sealed if you open what was sealed
[2:28:29] we will believe everything that you
[2:28:32] preach to us from the open evidence
[2:28:35] [Music]
[2:28:41] did you get it did you get it
[2:28:45] this brings us to the vision of Junior
[2:28:48] Jackson
[2:28:49] yes amen
[2:28:51] brother Branham says that Gino Jackson
[2:28:54] told me a dream
[2:28:57] that there was a long great grassy Hill
[2:29:00] and the water had washed all the soul
[2:29:04] off the top and it becomes Rock like a
[2:29:08] ball top of the mountain
[2:29:11] says that in the vision of Junior
[2:29:13] Jackson
[2:29:15] saw a hill
[2:29:22] but on the top here there was some water
[2:29:25] that came
[2:29:27] and that water washed the top of it
[2:29:30] until he made the top like a boulder
[2:29:34] anybody here everything here is Grassy
[2:29:38] but over here is Rock
[2:29:43] everybody okay praise God and again in
[2:29:47] this rock there were family ridings
[2:29:52] but here so brother Branham said when
[2:29:54] the water was coming I have another coat
[2:29:57] the water was cutting
[2:30:00] certain ridings on the rock
[2:30:02] so they were rewardings right here
[2:30:06] on the outside of the Rock
[2:30:10] and they were cut by the water
[2:30:13] which is the spirit of God
[2:30:16] here you must be born of the water
[2:30:20] except a man be born of the water
[2:30:24] but here and then they were funny riding
[2:30:28] and said that I was standing there with
[2:30:31] all the Brethren around the church here
[2:30:34] interpreting this water
[2:30:38] this rock
[2:30:40] was already open
[2:30:44] he was open to the public
[2:30:49] but here and he was open and the
[2:30:52] scripture that was on it was opened to
[2:30:55] the public and everybody can interpret
[2:30:58] this and by the Branham was also
[2:31:00] interpreting
[2:31:01] everybody okay
[2:31:03] and then when it comes to the time that
[2:31:06] I got all of it
[2:31:09] I finish everything
[2:31:11] interpreted then somehow or another if I
[2:31:15] understand the dream around I got a hold
[2:31:18] of something like a water
[2:31:20] do you know what a crowbar is
[2:31:22] when you put a nail
[2:31:25] into a into a wood and you're trying to
[2:31:28] kill by Amina to remove the nail there
[2:31:32] is something that looked like a hook
[2:31:33] like this that you put the nail inside
[2:31:36] of it and you pull it like this that's a
[2:31:39] crowbar is a crowbar Sharp
[2:31:42] can they call back at something
[2:31:52] and something like a crowbar something
[2:31:56] kind of an angle about something not
[2:31:58] angle bar means a pry bar on something
[2:32:01] and just do what
[2:32:03] so if brother Branham took something and
[2:32:07] cut the rock can a crowbar cataract
[2:32:13] what can cut something
[2:32:18] as you remember in Sabino Canyon
[2:32:22] but here when brother Branham was
[2:32:25] playing with his hand out something
[2:32:28] dropped down and shut his hand
[2:32:32] what shook his hand
[2:32:37] [Music]
[2:32:39] [Applause]
[2:32:43] but he was not a sword that was shift it
[2:32:48] was a stone that was open
[2:32:49] foreign
[2:32:52] [Applause]
[2:32:58] [Music]
[2:33:03] this is an unseal evidence
[2:33:05] [Music]
[2:33:08] and here
[2:33:09] [Applause]
[2:33:14] and look good glistering
[2:33:17] [Music]
[2:33:19] took the sword and cut the mountain
[2:33:23] that was the secret I was hiding
[2:33:25] sunshine
[2:33:28] ever here
[2:33:33] ever here and then when I cut the top of
[2:33:37] it and I did water
[2:33:39] brother when he cut it he took the top
[2:33:42] and lifted up
[2:33:43] everybody here when he lifts it up and
[2:33:47] on the inside
[2:33:54] why is the vision of brother I I gave
[2:33:57] you through the scripture Jeremiah
[2:33:59] opened close open close open close now
[2:34:02] the vision of brother Brandon matches
[2:34:04] the Bible
[2:34:05] come on
[2:34:06] now yeah everybody here and then on the
[2:34:11] inside there was a water
[2:34:13] so when brother brought them cut this
[2:34:16] off
[2:34:16] this stop open up
[2:34:25] everybody here on the inside here
[2:34:30] there was another rock here
[2:34:33] that was never seen before
[2:34:37] he was seal in the rock
[2:34:40] so that rock have two parts
[2:34:43] there was an open part and there was a
[2:34:46] sealed party
[2:34:50] [Music]
[2:34:54] this mystery will purify you
[2:34:58] it will make you white
[2:35:02] everybody okay and then on the inside
[2:35:06] there was a White Rock something on the
[2:35:09] order of a water remember in the pyramid
[2:35:12] in the king's chamber there was granite
[2:35:15] you remember that in a hotel
[2:35:18] hey but here there was something on that
[2:35:20] side something White Rock that was what
[2:35:26] this was written
[2:35:30] but this was a written
[2:35:36] I don't know what I would call this
[2:35:37] sermon because I have not touched the
[2:35:39] Beast not even the surface
[2:35:42] everybody okay
[2:35:43] the interpretation on the rock
[2:35:46] the rock is who
[2:35:48] that was in the brother's dream and that
[2:35:52] is there
[2:35:57] anybody can open it all kind of version
[2:36:01] King James whatever no International
[2:36:04] Version Jehovah Witnesses everybody and
[2:36:07] for all these these years
[2:36:09] the Bible has been
[2:36:12] open evidence subject to men
[2:36:15] manipulation until we have absolutely
[2:36:18] give it the water
[2:36:21] interpretation
[2:36:23] because it's open anybody can do what
[2:36:25] they want to do anybody can claim what
[2:36:27] they want to claim and but here and
[2:36:29] their last gift
[2:36:31] being added
[2:36:33] it's a last gift which is the seven
[2:36:36] angels time to preach in the loud decent
[2:36:38] church at that time there will be a lot
[2:36:41] of things that was
[2:36:43] the stone were played with down through
[2:36:46] there
[2:36:48] everybody okay what happened six months
[2:36:52] before it happened we told you by the
[2:36:54] holy spirit because the pyramid riding
[2:36:58] on there
[2:36:59] right there as the brother had the dream
[2:37:02] and I interpreted to you that is the
[2:37:05] entire interpretation now all the
[2:37:08] mysteries of justification
[2:37:10] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:37:13] was done
[2:37:15] foreign
[2:37:20] of that which was
[2:37:23] in there
[2:37:25] not the seven churches
[2:37:27] the servants you revealed their mystery
[2:37:31] then he opened this thing up at the top
[2:37:36] and found her
[2:37:38] white bar head never
[2:37:41] he was there
[2:37:43] what are you talking about brother
[2:37:45] brother remember he was in a pyramid
[2:37:48] where the mysterious White Rock was not
[2:37:51] written on
[2:37:52] and the angel took me into the Pyramid
[2:37:55] of
[2:37:56] so when the engine came they pick up
[2:37:59] brother Branham and they put him inside
[2:38:02] his inside the Angelic pyramid
[2:38:06] when brother brother met him he saw what
[2:38:10] is going on now he can interpret what
[2:38:13] was in the dreamer
[2:38:17] the mystery of God known only to the
[2:38:21] seven angels damn word the message was
[2:38:24] the messenger they had come to interpret
[2:38:27] the appearance or the message of the
[2:38:30] secret of the seven seal which is laying
[2:38:34] with inside the water
[2:38:38] what are you talking about body Stephen
[2:38:40] I took some kind of a bar we know what
[2:38:43] it is and cut it off and on the inside
[2:38:46] was the White Rock that had nothing
[2:38:49] wrote on and I told the brother I said
[2:38:53] don't go west stay here and look on this
[2:38:57] Tila water when brother Branham looked
[2:39:00] at that it was something that was not
[2:39:01] written before he stopped he had to go
[2:39:04] west why did he go west he said I went
[2:39:07] West for the
[2:39:09] what is a blessed and Thunder
[2:39:12] and return back to the east with the
[2:39:18] interpreting this water
[2:39:20] [Music]
[2:39:26] so the servant seal opened the Thunders
[2:39:30] and the Thunders is the interpretation
[2:39:34] of the word that was never written
[2:39:38] yet it's inside the Bible so through the
[2:39:42] Thunders now when you look in the Bible
[2:39:46] the Bible become a new
[2:39:49] [Music]
[2:39:51] about here
[2:39:54] check somebody's hand and say God bless
[2:39:56] you

[2:40:16] Lord help me I have to rush quickly and
[2:40:19] cut it off
[2:40:20] when we talk about this oil
[2:40:24] and the Virgin and the second oil so now
[2:40:27] you are grounded in this church about
[2:40:31] the seals about the thunder about the
[2:40:34] open evidence about the seals evidence
[2:40:36] now you understand in this church
[2:40:40] about here
[2:40:42] the 10th virgin took the water
[2:40:46] they took lamps
[2:40:49] everybody okay
[2:40:52] Lord help me
[2:40:55] I'm trying to hurry now
[2:40:57] they took their lamps
[2:40:59] and when they took their lamps are going
[2:41:02] to meet the bridegroom you already
[2:41:03] understood this
[2:41:05] is going to meet boys everybody okay
[2:41:08] and then when they went their wives took
[2:41:11] off
[2:41:12] what made them wise is the oil that they
[2:41:16] took
[2:41:17] everybody here
[2:41:18] all of them have lamp
[2:41:22] daldo's lamp had oil
[2:41:25] but when the bridegroom came the oil of
[2:41:29] that lamp
[2:41:31] will run out and the lamp were going out
[2:41:34] because the Bible says
[2:41:37] that at midnight there was a cry
[2:41:40] which is a shout which is a message of
[2:41:43] seven thunders of Seven Seals behold the
[2:41:47] bread groom cometh go here to meet him
[2:41:49] and all the Virgin arose and they
[2:41:52] trimmed their lamb and the foolish said
[2:41:54] unto them as give us of your for our
[2:41:57] lamp our water
[2:41:59] the lamps of everybody was going out

[2:42:44] about here everybody here make sure the
[2:42:48] one sitting beside you have their own
[2:42:50] because you might be in the same message

[2:43:02] but you are talking different message
[2:43:04] am I preaching the message like
[2:43:07] Pentecostal
[2:43:09] some are preaching the message like

[2:43:21] message by Church you feel the same
[2:43:23] spirit
[2:43:24] [Music]
[2:43:26] because of lack of the second oil
[2:43:31] everybody here ever here that oil
[2:43:35] causes separation
[2:43:41] you don't cause the separation
[2:43:43] the lack of oil will make one go out
[2:43:47] and you are going to stay
[2:43:50] [Music]
[2:43:53] but here
[2:43:55] to make somebody go out
[2:43:58] trying to find oil and you are staying
[2:44:03] everybody here and that oil you need it
[2:44:08] to meet the bridegroom

[2:44:17] you enter into the bread with the
[2:44:20] bridegroom in the chamber and close the

[2:51:50] your glory
[2:51:55] oh my God
[2:51:57] everybody okay let me try to rush
[2:52:00] everybody okay
[2:52:02] when you look at the candlestick
[2:52:08] you tired
[2:52:11] somebody's saying a little bit so I
[2:52:13] gotta give you to the airport
[2:52:15] everybody okay
[2:52:16] he said according to this true picture
[2:52:19] that's the candlestick
[2:52:21] if you watch the first lamp that every
[2:52:25] virgin was carrying have three parts
[2:52:28] yes yes that's right yes
[2:52:32] everybody okay he has a reservoir you
[2:52:36] have a stick
[2:52:38] a spout and then on the top you have
[2:52:42] everybody here right there you got it
[2:52:45] everybody here if you look at the
[2:52:48] Candlestick the Candlestick is called
[2:52:52] lampstem
[2:52:54] that's the correct way what about them
[2:52:56] say it's called Lamp and the Virgin have
[2:52:59] lamb the difference between this and
[2:53:02] this is the Candlestick is a combination
[2:53:04] of seven lamps
[2:53:06] yeah seven individual lamps put together
[2:53:10] they give you one candle so every lamp
[2:53:13] of the Candlestick also have three parts
[2:53:18] you have the boil the reservoir he has
[2:53:21] the
[2:53:23] and then you have the
[2:53:25] everybody here the flame right on the
[2:53:28] top there everybody here so this light
[2:53:31] and this light
[2:53:34] is the same
[2:53:38] what are you trying to say
[2:53:41] what the problem says reminding you that
[2:53:44] this light never went out the priests
[2:53:48] just keep water
[2:53:50] the one that was pulling all was not the
[2:53:53] prophet
[2:53:54] he was a priest because Jesus have
[2:53:58] treated us
[2:53:59] he is son of God
[2:54:04] which means what
[2:54:06] he's son of man
[2:54:09] which means what
[2:54:11] and he's son of David
[2:54:15] which is water
[2:54:19] but here Son of God Son of Man son of
[2:54:23] David everybody okay
[2:54:27] everybody okay now this oil was powered
[2:54:33] by the priest
[2:54:34] so it was the office of the Son of God
[2:54:38] that was giving oil
[2:54:41] throughout the seven churches Jesus was
[2:54:44] Son of God giving oil he was son of man
[2:54:48] when he came on Earth
[2:54:50] and he died for our sin he was son of
[2:54:54] man he said the son of man the son of
[2:54:56] man the son of man but when he left and
[2:55:00] he came on the day of Pentecost he was
[2:55:02] not son of man he was the son of God
[2:55:05] empowering oil throughout the seven
[2:55:08] churches
[2:55:10] [Music]
[2:55:13] everybody okay everybody okay now when a
[2:55:17] priest poor all there is a danger
[2:55:21] foreign
[2:55:24] Lord help me
[2:55:27] in the book of Samuel we found out that
[2:55:31] the child Samuel Minister unto the Lord
[2:55:34] before who Samuel was not a priest
[2:55:40] everybody okay
[2:55:42] Samuel was not from the tribe of liver
[2:55:46] he came from the tribe of Ephraim
[2:55:49] his mother made the vow that God I am
[2:55:52] bearing if you give me a child I will
[2:55:56] give it to your service
[2:55:58] so Samia went not being a priest but he
[2:56:03] was put under the priest's office
[2:56:07] and he began to work in the Tabernacle
[2:56:12] as a priest but he was not a priest he
[2:56:16] was a prophet
[2:56:19] so the interests of Samuel into the
[2:56:22] Tabernacle he entered as a priest as
[2:56:27] delivered even though he was not
[2:56:29] delivered
[2:56:37] the lamp of the Lord was on
[2:56:40] yes amen everybody okay and Samuel was
[2:56:44] just delivered and something happened to
[2:56:47] ELA to the priest
[2:56:51] and the word of the Lord was water
[2:56:54] precious means he was well
[2:56:57] he was rare in those days why because
[2:57:01] there was no
[2:57:03] the Bible didn't say there was no vision
[2:57:08] you remember we preached on the two
[2:57:10] vision and the dream and open vision is
[2:57:14] a vision that you see with your eyes
[2:57:17] open
[2:57:19] did you get me a close vision is the
[2:57:23] vision that you see when you go to sleep
[2:57:26] and it happened that's why brother
[2:57:28] Branham said a dream that happened or a
[2:57:32] dream that is interpreted is a vision
[2:57:35] amen but a prophet
[2:57:38] doesn't go to sleep
[2:57:41] to see the vision I already taught you
[2:57:43] that here a prophet look at you and
[2:57:46] while he's talking to you he already
[2:57:48] that's why bellam said the one who sees
[2:57:51] with his eyes open
[2:57:53] amen so when they say there is no open
[2:57:56] Vision it means that there was no
[2:57:59] prophet
[2:58:00] but Samuel was already there
[2:58:04] but Samuel prophetic office was quiet
[2:58:09] because Ila's eyes are open
[2:58:14] everybody okay the Son of God is still
[2:58:17] working there's no way the son of man
[2:58:19] can kick in
[2:58:23] everybody okay and he came to pass at
[2:58:26] that time when Ela was laid down in his
[2:58:30] place and his eyes begin to utter
[2:58:34] and he could not water
[2:58:36] something happened to the vision of the
[2:58:39] priest liver Ela went blind
[2:58:44] naturally
[2:58:46] but spiritually something happened in
[2:58:49] the Tabernacle
[2:58:51] what happened in the Tabernacle when
[2:58:54] Iraq
[2:58:55] became blind and air the lamb of who
[2:58:59] when water
[2:59:03] but here so when the vision of the Son
[2:59:07] of God goes out the ministry is finished
[2:59:11] but here the Candlestick went out
[2:59:16] the lamp of the Virgin is going out
[2:59:20] you need
[2:59:21] another order
[2:59:24] no more in oil of the priest
[2:59:29] amen as soon as the lamp of God went out
[2:59:32] in the the temple showing that it was
[2:59:35] the end of the Leviticus delivered the
[2:59:39] priest ended God activated the prophetic
[2:59:43] gift of Samuel
[2:59:45] are we okay and then where the Ark of
[2:59:49] God was and Samuel laid down to water
[2:59:52] that that the Lord called who he never
[2:59:56] called him until the lamp went off
[2:59:59] [Music]
[3:00:07] the prophet was calling the sin
[3:00:12] what are you talking about my friend the
[3:00:14] Bible said all Israel from them to
[3:00:17] Bathsheba knew that Samuel was
[3:00:19] established to be a
[3:00:22] act 13 He gave unto them judges about
[3:00:26] this place of 450 until Samuel death
[3:00:30] so when the Candlestick went out
[3:00:36] but here the son of man the prophetic
[3:00:40] office
[3:00:42] open up
[3:00:45] everybody here but Samuel started first
[3:00:51] under the priest
[3:00:54] brother Branham have to start his
[3:00:57] ministry and
[3:00:59] yes under the Candlestick he have to go
[3:01:02] to the Pentecostal you have to go to the
[3:01:04] Full Gospel you have to work with the
[3:01:07] Full Gospel the Presbyterian he must be
[3:01:10] under the Candlestick until their land
[3:01:14] he's gone out then the prophetic office
[3:01:16] of brother Branham kick on
[3:01:25] glory to God where am I at
[3:01:28] e Hallelujah
[3:01:30] where am I at amen
[3:01:33] brother Branham says this
[3:01:35] that this bowl here
[3:01:38] Jesus help me he said the resource that
[3:01:41] the man ball because that they had
[3:01:43] whipped deep into it each age messenger
[3:01:46] is depicted here his life is on fire
[3:01:48] with the Holy Ghost he's weak his life
[3:01:51] has been immersed in
[3:01:53] so we see a crust here
[3:01:56] but the crust that is in a Candlestick
[3:01:59] it is the son of God
[3:02:02] there is another Christ who is the son
[3:02:04] of man
[3:02:06] anybody here because the Bible says in
[3:02:09] the day that the son of man will be
[3:02:13] not the Son of God in between the Son of
[3:02:16] God and the son of David the son of man
[3:02:22] God must reveal himself as a prophet we
[3:02:26] found out that this candlestick we're in
[3:02:30] the shape of an ark
[3:02:32] but they never made the circle
[3:02:35] everybody okay
[3:02:38] what is going on this is where we got
[3:02:41] this
[3:02:43] I got stopped somewhere
[3:02:45] Amen Let me push to a button and stop
[3:02:49] Paul says that
[3:02:55] now you understand
[3:02:58] because Daniel say nobody will open
[3:03:01] these evidences that was here until
[3:03:05] so Paul must preach a portion
[3:03:11] amen
[3:03:12] Paul can preach only apart Paul can
[3:03:15] never touch the sea levels because it's
[3:03:18] for the enter
[3:03:19] but here and then we prophesy in
[3:03:24] but that which is
[3:03:26] what he means perfect
[3:03:31] amen perfect
[3:03:34] means complete
[3:03:38] foreign
[3:03:41] I gotta stop here you needed to go to
[3:03:44] home what does complete means Paul said
[3:03:48] when that which is perfect is come
[3:03:53] then that which is in
[3:03:55] shall be water
[3:03:57] what does he mean
[3:03:59] why
[3:04:01] stop
[3:04:04] let me handle this here
[3:04:07] Paul said are preaching water
[3:04:12] what Paul preached was a bad
[3:04:15] why when that which is perfect come we
[3:04:19] take what Paul preach away
[3:04:29] was in part away
[3:04:31] doesn't mean what you're thinking
[3:04:35] [Music]
[3:04:38] can I say it again
[3:04:40] taking away
[3:04:42] what was in part according to us what
[3:04:46] the way we're seeing is we have the part
[3:04:50] that which is complete is coming we do
[3:04:53] this
[3:04:54] that's what you think it's not that way
[3:04:59] anybody here
[3:05:05] what do you see here
[3:05:09] what do you see here
[3:05:13] everybody Kia
[3:05:14] half a circle everybody here
[3:05:17] this is complete
[3:05:22] it is perfect
[3:05:25] everybody here this is half
[3:05:28] everybody here everybody here when the
[3:05:31] complete come
[3:05:33] you gotta the part is removed
[3:05:37] it is now really thrown away
[3:05:41] because the complete contain the part
[3:05:45] [Applause]
[3:05:48] [Music]
[3:05:51] everybody okay did you get me or you
[3:05:53] want me to repeat
[3:05:55] raise your hand if you want me to repeat
[3:05:57] it
[3:05:57] thank you
[3:05:59] listen to me carefully
[3:06:01] this is half
[3:06:04] amen this half the problem with it is
[3:06:08] because it's missing this
[3:06:11] [Music]
[3:06:12] hey but here this is the missing part
[3:06:15] because it's now written
[3:06:17] everybody okay but when the complete
[3:06:21] come the complete truly means this
[3:06:31] [Music]
[3:06:34] complete bring you that which is already
[3:06:38] was there and they missed part together
[3:06:41] that's why Paul said when the complete
[3:06:45] come we don't need the half anymore
[3:06:47] because the complete contained the house
[3:06:51] [Music]
[3:06:53] foreign
[3:06:55] did I lose you
[3:06:57] is that the word when the message of
[3:07:01] brother Branham comes you cannot read
[3:07:04] Martin Luther
[3:07:09] you cannot read John Wesley anymore
[3:07:13] Wesley is in the message Martin Luther
[3:07:17] is in the message Paul is in the message
[3:07:20] and when you season the message and what
[3:07:23] they didn't see is also in the message
[3:07:26] so the message got everything
[3:07:30] [Applause]
[3:07:33] did you hear it did you eat so the
[3:07:37] message when you have it the message
[3:07:40] have looter and Luther corrected
[3:07:45] he have Wesley and Wesley corrected he
[3:07:50] have power and what Paul means
[3:07:54] he have varenuous and the correction in
[3:07:57] foreign use that's why when brother
[3:07:59] Branham come he will recognize Billy
[3:08:02] Graham
[3:08:03] he will recognize her and Robin he said
[3:08:06] they are servant of God Campbell was the
[3:08:09] Servants of God Knox was a servant of
[3:08:12] God the Pentecostal yes over there he
[3:08:15] pulled them all up and he put it
[3:08:17] together so when we had that which is
[3:08:20] completed
[3:08:22] that which was important because those
[3:08:26] parts have mistake
[3:08:28] they had to lose end so you can no more
[3:08:32] go to those books and begin to read them
[3:08:36] because that which is complete this
[3:08:39] camera
[3:08:41] [Music]
[3:08:43] if a Lutheran come in this church he
[3:08:46] will see me talking about his messenger
[3:08:52] I don't need to go to his church
[3:08:55] his messenger is in my message Wesley is
[3:08:59] in my message Pentecostal are here I
[3:09:02] don't go to Pentecostal churches but
[3:09:05] when I read the message I see the
[3:09:07] deviation of the Pentecostal I see the
[3:09:10] Jehovah Witnesses I see the error I see
[3:09:14] everything without being in Jehovah
[3:09:16] Witness church so when I talked to a
[3:09:19] Jehovah Witness he will think that I
[3:09:21] have been reading the books that's right
[3:09:24] but I never read their books I only read
[3:09:27] the message because when that which is
[3:09:29] perfect have come
[3:09:31] everybody here you don't need the
[3:09:33] complete you don't need the part anymore
[3:09:36] because the Perfection bring what was
[3:09:39] before and corrected the missing part
[3:09:43] that was before in other words the
[3:09:45] Perfection brings the open evidence and
[3:09:49] they close evidence and put both of
[3:09:52] those emptied this together
[3:09:56] [Music]
[3:09:58] I don't know what to call this
[3:10:01] maybe I need to call this roof the open
[3:10:03] and close evidence
[3:10:05] because I can't touch the Beast we gotta
[3:10:08] stop here
[3:10:09] amen there's two evidences in the world
[3:10:12] the written word
[3:10:14] and the unwritten word the Jordan have
[3:10:17] two evidences the the stone of Junior
[3:10:20] Jackson two evidences the Bible two
[3:10:22] evidences amen and Paul say we preach in
[3:10:26] part because the other part was still
[3:10:28] but when that which is complete that
[3:10:31] which is complete when it comes he pick
[3:10:34] up what thought that's why you heard
[3:10:36] brother Branham say I preach like he
[3:10:39] have to take what Paul preached but he
[3:10:42] went further than Paul
[3:10:44] because Paul preaching partner that was
[3:10:47] the first time he went into the other
[3:10:49] side but after the opening of the seals
[3:10:52] brother Branham says certain things
[3:10:55] differently and I'm gonna stop here oh
[3:10:58] Christian what opportunity we have we
[3:11:02] have opportunities that
[3:11:05] never
[3:11:12] everybody okay we have opportunity that
[3:11:16] even
[3:11:17] and who and all of them
[3:11:21] the opportunity we have
[3:11:24] after the opening of death because we
[3:11:28] got the same part
[3:11:29] [Music]
[3:11:31] it's listening
[3:11:32] [Applause]
[3:11:40] now we don't go any more further and if
[3:11:44] you notice when brother Branham
[3:11:46] identified who we preach like he went
[3:11:50] straight to Paul
[3:11:51] he didn't say I preach like Luther
[3:11:54] he said I preach like who because Paul
[3:11:57] is in the scripture
[3:12:02] Paul is in the Bible and he just went
[3:12:05] back and put his reference back in the
[3:12:07] Bible and he closes everything in be
[3:12:10] there in the middle was coping from Paul
[3:12:14] anybody here
[3:12:16] that's why when we get our head in this
[3:12:20] message you don't have to listen to the
[3:12:22] nominations because when you open your
[3:12:25] ears you are opening the ears to
[3:12:28] something that have little truth with
[3:12:31] error
[3:12:32] load of Truth with error when you read
[3:12:35] any kind of books all the time when
[3:12:38] preachers in this message read other
[3:12:41] preachers in denominational
[3:12:44] they're opening their mind to order
[3:12:47] error Pharaoh Arrow Arrow no there is
[3:12:51] nothing that's a Christian book
[3:12:53] what is in that Christian book
[3:12:56] do you know how to detect the error and
[3:12:59] where there is no error before you know
[3:13:01] it you're gonna go suck up certain
[3:13:03] things that will confuse you with the
[3:13:05] message because the pastor was reading
[3:13:08] all kind of books Let's go to Billy
[3:13:10] Graham Library I won't take you there
[3:13:13] blue
[3:13:16] that message is already gone
[3:13:21] because the more we take people the
[3:13:23] people look you say whoa that was a
[3:13:25] great man how could he be an arrow you
[3:13:28] confuse the people
[3:13:32] [Music]
[3:13:33] you want me to make you a visit let me
[3:13:36] make you a visit in a message
[3:13:40] I don't want to take you even to
[3:13:41] Jeffersonville I have the word
[3:13:44] you want to visit sit with me at home
[3:13:46] and say open your bubble look here look
[3:13:49] here look where brother Brandon says
[3:13:50] here Look Away look here look here if
[3:13:52] you come out from there you will be
[3:13:54] speaking in tongue
[3:13:57] amen are you gonna come up there
[3:14:00] learning a lot then going to visit tell
[3:14:03] us born going to the no no no no when
[3:14:05] that which is perfect is come
[3:14:07] we are done away with dirty which is
[3:14:11] put your head in the message it's
[3:14:13] Vindicated because the message opened
[3:14:16] the seal evidence and the open evidence
[3:14:18] and he put both of them together and
[3:14:21] gave it to us this message is perfectly
[3:14:24] in line with the scripture let's pray
[3:14:27] Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching
[3:14:30] you humbly father again this afternoon
[3:14:32] thanking you for your grace your love
[3:14:35] and your mercy father and for everything
[3:14:37] you have been doing for us
[3:14:40] father you the one that guided this
[3:14:42] sermon
[3:14:44] he was Lord to be going into the trail
[3:14:47] of the serpent but father you know who
[3:14:50] was in need to get more stabilization to
[3:14:54] understand the message the way it was
[3:14:58] supposed to be understood that that's
[3:15:00] why we preached the Bible and we preach
[3:15:03] the Bible with the light of the message
[3:15:05] because now we got the open evidence and
[3:15:08] we got the seal evidence and the
[3:15:10] silverness came by this message Father
[3:15:13] Lord may you help us Lord to
[3:15:17] give allegiance to the lender to the
[3:15:21] revealed word of this hour that came in
[3:15:24] and to uphold that candle
[3:15:27] Lord take it away from The Bushel so
[3:15:31] that he can produce light
[3:15:33] because that's the second oil the oil
[3:15:36] that can prepare us the oil that make us
[3:15:40] ready the oil that unfolded the mystery
[3:15:43] the oil that Lord the Vindicated
[3:15:46] literally bring us back again to meet
[3:15:49] our bridegroom father I thank you for
[3:15:51] the sacrifice that the people have done

[3:16:00] me to go this direction and father we
[3:16:02] commit all the glory unto thee father

[3:16:09] them and unfold your word more and more

[3:16:14] clearer we can see without a doubt that

[3:16:19] people not because we were worthy not
[3:16:23] because we deserve anything but it was
