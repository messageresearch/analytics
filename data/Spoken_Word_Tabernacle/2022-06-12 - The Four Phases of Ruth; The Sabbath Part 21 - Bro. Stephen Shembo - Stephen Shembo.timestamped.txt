[39:33] remember to remain
[39:35] christian
[39:37] it will load you up with a lot of
[39:39] ammunition here
[39:41] so you're supposed to be the light of
[39:43] the world
[39:44] where do you go in the youth banquet or
[39:46] in a reception or whatever you do
[39:49] remember you don't want now to be
[39:52] reflecting something until the one
[39:55] looking at you will say i want to be
[39:57] like those young people i want to be
[39:59] like this young man amen
[40:02] don't be like saul who compromised to
[40:04] please the people you remember that
[40:06] sunday if you're trying to compromise
[40:09] everything to make sure you please
[40:10] certain people
[40:12] you can lose your ceiling
[40:14] everybody care so we don't want anybody
[40:16] to lose your ceiling make sure you stand
[40:18] on the word of god regardless of what is
[40:21] going on because your stand i was
[40:23] telling a young man i say stephen never
[40:26] knew that his stand on the word of god
[40:30] will affect the one of the greatest
[40:33] apostles that was sitting right there
[40:35] so you don't know if an earth paul
[40:37] paulie's right there
[40:38] watching you understand that you take on
[40:40] the word of god he's gonna save paul and
[40:44] paul will unfold the old testament and
[40:46] write the new testament amen so don't
[40:49] get
[40:50] caught up into everything
[40:52] dance wildly and all kinds of stuff and
[40:54] before you know it people are like which
[40:56] church do you go to is it really this is
[40:59] the church you go through and when they
[41:01] get on youtube they listen to me they're
[41:03] gonna see me firing every devil left and
[41:06] right
[41:07] now it's a confusion
[41:09] they're preaching like this look at the
[41:11] way they're living it's not compatible
[41:13] so remember rejoice rejoice in the lord
[41:17] be happy do everything good but remember
[41:22] somebody's watching you there is an eye
[41:24] watching you
[41:26] everybody here you're going to the youth
[41:28] banquet there is an eye watching you
[41:30] make sure whatever you do is pleasing
[41:33] unto the lord at the beginning you
[41:34] didn't know but now that you know god is
[41:37] going to require you according to the
[41:39] level of your understanding
[41:42] amen
[41:43] maybe those youth some of them never
[41:45] attended what we went through with you
[41:48] so you already know you don't want to
[41:50] they reflect what is going on and then
[41:53] they will be thirsting to be like you
[41:57] and you are preaching by your life amen
[41:59] did i help somebody
[42:01] whatever you do in word or indeed do it
[42:05] in the name of jesus christ and make
[42:07] sure everything is lined up amen
[42:10] blessed be the name of the lord so let's
[42:12] go to our scripture this morning

[44:09] for them
[44:10] they are strange women
[44:12] and also
[44:14] that she only have
[44:16] two
[44:18] children
[44:19] her own husband passed away marlon and
[44:22] kylian died in other words i don't have

[45:52] i wish the whole church was here
[45:57] everybody so far
[45:59] so rest

[48:26] with her
[48:27] which returned out of the country of
[48:30] moab
[48:31] and they came to bethlehem
[48:34] in the beginning
[48:37] of barley water
[48:40] so the time that roof came
[48:43] into israel
[48:45] was a beginning
[48:49] come on offer harvest
[48:54] everybody
[48:55] we know there is two seasons

[49:16] bark here
[49:17] the sowing season if you remember
[49:21] have seed
[49:22] yes
[49:24] fully mature
[49:26] finished product
[49:28] you remember
[49:29] and the harvest also have seed
[49:34] ever care so whatever started here
[49:38] ending in the harvest
[49:42] so if you miss the sowing season
[49:46] you can get seed in the harvest
[49:51] hallelujah
[49:53] let's go to roof chapter three
[49:56] lord help us
[49:59] you understand ruth chapter 2 now
[50:02] you've seen the candlestick you see the
[50:04] reaper you've seen the messenger you've
[50:06] seen the table of the showbreath you've
[50:08] seen the all of them
[50:11] chapter 2 sanctification purification
[50:13] all of them
[50:14] now we're entering roof chapter 3.
[50:18] one book brother greg
[50:20] if you're there you can say amen
[50:23] then now me her mother-in-law
[50:26] say to her roof
[50:29] come on my daughter
[50:32] shall i not seek water
[50:39] everybody okay
[50:41] so the third chapter
[50:43] of roof
[50:46] because the mathematics of the bible are
[50:48] perfect
[50:49] open up
[50:50] with a discussion
[50:53] about rest
[50:55] i thought naomi said that there is no
[50:58] husband
[51:03] i'm asking you a question that's my way
[51:05] of preaching we're preaching together
[51:07] everybody here
[51:08] i thought naomi said there is no hope
[51:11] now homie say if you follow me there is
[51:13] no husband
[51:14] even if you check me i don't have any
[51:16] more babies no husband the one i have
[51:20] already dead
[51:21] there is no hope
[51:22] but where is this rest coming out
[51:27] this race could not be spoken
[51:30] into the land of moab
[51:37] if you're in moab nobody will say about
[51:39] this rest that's right you have to move
[51:42] into progression
[51:44] everybody
[51:45] when you are inside of israel
[51:48] then you will find the husband
[51:51] because remember
[51:53] boaz was a rich man
[51:57] very rich man
[52:00] anybody care
[52:01] so if naomi would have told them
[52:04] that in the promised land
[52:06] i have
[52:11] one of your
[52:13] family
[52:14] he is a single man
[52:18] have been talking with him on the
[52:19] telephone
[52:21] and i always ask him why he doesn't get
[52:24] married till now
[52:26] and he's still telling me that i'm i'm
[52:28] still praying i'm still praying i'm
[52:30] still praying and matter of fact he's a
[52:32] very successful businessman
[52:35] he owned big firm he has a
[52:38] multi-millionaire
[52:40] company
[52:42] do you think oppa would have gone back
[52:45] [Applause]
[52:50] she would have jumped on the wagon
[52:53] maybe she will be more louder than roof
[52:56] [Applause]
[52:59] maybe she will be the one working more
[53:03] if she was in the field she could be the
[53:05] one doing everything to impress boaz
[53:09] she worked she comes back she said boys
[53:10] did you see me today
[53:12] okay i want to make sure you saw me
[53:18] that rest
[53:20] is now revealed outside
[53:23] it is only kept over there
[53:31] we on sunday we have one service so let
[53:33] me gear slowly as we go amen
[53:37] hallelujah
[53:38] i told you one chapter
[53:40] one one
[53:42] verse
[53:43] amen
[53:46] i was trying to go even down but i can't
[53:49] i'm reading the second verse just to
[53:51] help you into something but really we'll
[53:54] stack on the first one
[53:58] verse two and now
[54:00] he's not bore us our water
[54:03] why she didn't say that in moab
[54:09] they won't tell you that anymore that's
[54:11] right god doesn't play a game
[54:14] anybody out here
[54:16] i gotta make sure before i do the
[54:18] ceiling
[54:19] i know where i'm putting that
[54:22] anybody care
[54:23] he's not boast of our kindred
[54:26] with who's made anyway
[54:31] everybody here
[54:32] behold he we knows
[54:36] barley tonight
[54:41] where does naomi knows all of this
[54:45] i thought she stayed home
[54:51] [Music]
[54:53] she even correct the roof
[54:55] when roof gave the wrong instructions he
[54:57] said no this is not what he said
[55:00] he told you to stay by the maiden how
[55:02] does she know this
[55:05] you got to read between the lines
[55:08] they didn't have no facebook
[55:13] they didn't have no whatsapp
[55:16] no instagram
[55:18] but the communication was flowing
[55:25] yes sister you pull it i'm going to say
[55:27] it
[55:30] you don't need a facebook for
[55:31] communication
[55:34] [Music]
[55:39] i'm trying to stay online
[55:42] everybody here
[55:43] do you know that when john the baptist
[55:46] when zachariah entered into the tower
[55:49] into the temple and spoke to gabriel
[55:52] when he came out
[55:53] was he able to speak
[55:57] he was out
[55:59] but they gave him the name of the child
[56:02] they told him the name of the child was
[56:04] who
[56:05] but when john was born
[56:08] the family came
[56:10] and they asked the question what is the
[56:13] name of this child do you know who

[1:00:28] fully fully grown
[1:00:30] we don't need the shark anymore

[1:03:38] it is connected to a marriage
[1:03:40] it happened on the third in the third
[1:03:43] chapter of roof

[1:03:53] everybody okay
[1:03:54] hebrew chapter 3
[1:03:56] verse 10 if you dare you can say amen
[1:03:59] or help me
[1:04:02] wherefore i was grieved with that
[1:04:05] generation
[1:04:06] and say
[1:04:07] they that generation do always air in
[1:04:11] there
[1:04:12] not in the head
[1:04:15] and they have not known my ways
[1:04:18] so our soul
[1:04:21] in my wrath
[1:04:23] they shall not enter into mine
[1:04:30] we okay now now everything is
[1:04:33] blending everybody okay
[1:04:35] take heed brethren
[1:04:37] let there be in any of you an evil heart
[1:04:41] of unbelief so unbelief is an evil heart
[1:04:45] very bad
[1:04:46] in departing
[1:04:49] from the living god that word departing
[1:04:51] meaning turning away you cannot depart
[1:04:55] from something if you are not there
[1:04:57] already
[1:04:59] come on that's it anybody here
[1:05:02] if you turn away from something you were
[1:05:04] already in something
[1:05:06] and when you turn your back
[1:05:09] if you were in the message and you turn
[1:05:11] your back
[1:05:12] against the message
[1:05:15] it's an evil heart
[1:05:17] [Music]
[1:05:22] amen you are looking at the appearance
[1:05:25] but ezekiel told us what is inside
[1:05:30] everybody here
[1:05:32] but exhort one another daily while it is
[1:05:37] called today
[1:05:39] so there is a today
[1:05:41] lest any of you be hardened
[1:05:44] through the deceitfulness of what
[1:05:47] for we are made partaker of christ
[1:05:51] if we hold
[1:05:53] the beginning
[1:05:54] of our water
[1:05:57] steadfast in other words firmly to the
[1:05:59] water
[1:06:01] so the end you want to get in crushed
[1:06:03] if you hold it
[1:06:05] anybody care
[1:06:06] while it is said today
[1:06:09] if you will hear his voice
[1:06:11] harden not your heart as in the
[1:06:13] provocation rebellion
[1:06:16] for some
[1:06:17] when they had heard
[1:06:19] did provoke in other words they did
[1:06:21] rebel
[1:06:22] however not all that came out of egypt
[1:06:26] by moses not everybody but with whom was
[1:06:30] he grieved 40 years with whom did god
[1:06:34] was god really grieved for 40 years
[1:06:37] was he not with them that had seen
[1:06:40] whose carcass fell in the water
[1:06:44] and to whom so he that they should not
[1:06:48] what
[1:06:50] so arrest
[1:06:53] is not the way you think about resting
[1:06:57] it's something that you enter into
[1:07:03] did i help you
[1:07:05] you must find the door
[1:07:09] it's not the rest that oh i'm resting
[1:07:12] that's a different race
[1:07:13] that rest have a door
[1:07:15] and you open and you enter
[1:07:19] and you close the door
[1:07:22] [Music]
[1:07:24] everybody care my god
[1:07:27] and to whom sorry that he should not
[1:07:30] enter into his water
[1:07:33] but to him that belief
[1:07:37] no they departed from the message they
[1:07:38] never believed the message
[1:07:41] you thought they believed the message
[1:07:45] everybody here
[1:07:46] so we see that they could not enter in
[1:07:50] because of water
[1:07:53] which is an evil heart
[1:07:57] everybody okay
[1:07:58] jump to revelation chapter eight and
[1:08:01] then
[1:08:02] we see if we gonna pray right there or
[1:08:04] after
[1:08:05] amen
[1:08:07] in revelation chapter eight oh my god

[1:08:26] if you're there you can say amen
[1:08:29] when he did water
[1:08:32] he did water
[1:08:35] is the seven seal open
[1:08:39] is it a problem
[1:08:42] come on now brother is it a problem
[1:08:44] so is the 7th sail closed open
[1:08:52] we're going to sit debating debating
[1:08:54] debating debating debating debating
[1:08:56] wasting time
[1:08:58] when he opened
[1:09:00] he had opened
[1:09:02] not the first
[1:09:04] not the second
[1:09:05] not the third
[1:09:07] i know where i'm going put your seatbelt
[1:09:09] stay alert
[1:09:11] it's a deep territory amen
[1:09:14] when he had opened the seventh
[1:09:17] seal
[1:09:18] which come after the six
[1:09:21] there was
[1:09:22] silence
[1:09:24] in heaven about the space of water
[1:09:27] so when the seventh seal opened
[1:09:35] it is quiet
[1:09:38] in other words it is mute
[1:09:42] it is silent
[1:09:46] everybody here
[1:09:51] the silence
[1:09:52] of the seven seal
[1:09:56] can only be broken
[1:09:58] by a vindicated prophet
[1:10:10] in revelation 10
[1:10:13] the bible says in verse 1 and i saw
[1:10:16] another mighty angel came down from
[1:10:19] heaven everybody okay
[1:10:21] club with a cloud we know it's crust
[1:10:24] and a rainbow was upon his head crust
[1:10:28] and his face was as he wear the sun
[1:10:30] crust
[1:10:31] and his feet as water
[1:10:34] it is crushed that's right you have a
[1:10:36] difficulty see me we will sit and talk
[1:10:39] about here and this angel which is
[1:10:42] crushed
[1:10:43] he had a
[1:10:44] in his hand a little book that was what
[1:10:48] and we know if the book is open
[1:10:52] it means that the seals has been broken
[1:10:58] everybody okay
[1:10:59] because the book was sealed or closed
[1:11:02] with seven seals everybody okay
[1:11:05] so if the book is open
[1:11:07] somehow the seals are broken
[1:11:14] we have the first seal the second seal
[1:11:17] the third seal the fourth seal the fifth
[1:11:20] seal the sixth seal and the seven and
[1:11:23] back here and we know that the seven is
[1:11:25] the one that is outside
[1:11:29] everybody here and the one that is the
[1:11:31] inside the inner court of the book is
[1:11:34] the first seal
[1:11:36] everybody here and when they opened the
[1:11:38] first seal there was a thunder
[1:11:44] everybody cared so far so what do you
[1:11:46] expect when they open the seventh one
[1:11:49] [Applause]
[1:11:52] i'm going slowly
[1:11:54] we're talking about the seals being
[1:11:56] quiet
[1:11:57] that's why i told you i know which
[1:11:59] territory i am in
[1:12:02] everybody okay
[1:12:04] hallelujah he says he had in his hand
[1:12:07] another book that was water
[1:12:09] so if it's open
[1:12:11] that means that the seventh one is
[1:12:14] broken
[1:12:16] because the seven is wonder engage all
[1:12:20] the other seals
[1:12:23] but when you ask the seven he's quiet
[1:12:30] if you go ask the seven you say okay
[1:12:32] seven seal tell me who you are he's
[1:12:34] quiet
[1:12:37] he doesn't say anything
[1:12:39] he's looking at you
[1:12:43] and he look at you usually like this
[1:12:50] i know you know what i'm talking about
[1:12:52] if you need the coach you see me
[1:12:54] because what i'm saying when he entered
[1:12:56] the constellation the seventh angel was
[1:12:59] looking at him like this
[1:13:01] with his chest up like this
[1:13:05] and brother branham say all the other
[1:13:07] six
[1:13:09] they're familiar
[1:13:10] this is the one
[1:13:13] that from my entire life
[1:13:16] i was worrying about this one
[1:13:19] but when he's looking at brother branham
[1:13:21] he's just doing this
[1:13:24] what is going on
[1:13:28] hallelujah
[1:13:29] and he set his foot upon the sea
[1:13:32] and his right foot upon the sea because
[1:13:35] in the sea you know what happened in
[1:13:36] revelation 13. there is a beast that is
[1:13:39] coming up hey
[1:13:41] and his left foot upon the earth you
[1:13:44] know what happened the beast in america
[1:13:46] so he's blocking those two beasts
[1:13:48] so don't worry about them they're not
[1:13:50] going to do you anything
[1:13:52] anybody care
[1:13:53] don't worry about vatican
[1:13:56] don't worry about whatever happened in
[1:13:58] united states
[1:13:59] don't worry about it
[1:14:01] christ is blocking them
[1:14:04] because the bride is still there
[1:14:06] because boys taught the reaper do not
[1:14:10] touch roof
[1:14:11] do not touch roof make sure you don't
[1:14:15] abuse her
[1:14:17] [Applause]
[1:14:19] [Music]
[1:14:22] everybody okay so far
[1:14:24] did i lose anyone
[1:14:26] okay blessed be the name of the lord
[1:14:29] then this angel
[1:14:31] cried
[1:14:33] with the water
[1:14:35] as when the water
[1:14:38] so the cry i'm already in a sermon but
[1:14:41] we will pray
[1:14:43] let's pray that i get in because this is
[1:14:45] getting yummy
[1:14:48] heavenly father lord we thank you again
[1:14:50] for your grace your love and your mercy
[1:14:53] and for everything you have been doing
[1:14:55] for us father we are committing this
[1:14:57] service unto the hand may you come and
[1:15:00] minister to us may you move me
[1:15:02] completely out of the way may you be the
[1:15:04] alpha and the omega of this service we
[1:15:06] rebuke every demonic spirit contrary to
[1:15:09] your word away from this place come down
[1:15:12] father and bless your children in jesus
[1:15:15] precious name
[1:15:16] amen
[1:15:17] everybody here so
[1:15:19] when this angel come down
[1:15:22] this angel cries
[1:15:24] in other words there is a cry
[1:15:26] or a shout out
[1:15:31] [Applause]
[1:15:32] are we okay
[1:15:34] are we okay
[1:15:35] and that shout
[1:15:37] is like the roaring of a lion
[1:15:41] so the way he shout
[1:15:44] everybody here
[1:15:45] it's
[1:15:46] the the best analogy
[1:15:49] they can give you is that it is like a
[1:15:53] lion
[1:15:55] that is roaring
[1:15:59] what does it mean
[1:16:01] a lion that is roaring about here
[1:16:04] and when he cried
[1:16:06] what happened
[1:16:08] seven thunders other the voices so this
[1:16:12] shout
[1:16:14] is not like wow that's nothing
[1:16:20] here it is a shout
[1:16:22] that have a sequence
[1:16:25] of seven pandas
[1:16:27] so when he's roaring he goes like boo
[1:16:30] boo boo that that that's him
[1:16:34] so they shout contain
[1:16:36] seven thunders
[1:16:41] everybody here so these seven thunders
[1:16:44] when you put them together it is one
[1:16:47] shout out
[1:16:49] [Applause]
[1:16:53] you cannot have that shot with one
[1:16:56] candle
[1:16:58] because the time they are connected
[1:17:00] together
[1:17:05] you cannot pull one angel from here
[1:17:08] it is the seventh spirit of god
[1:17:12] but there are one spirit
[1:17:17] are we okay
[1:17:18] hallelujah
[1:17:21] he says and when the seven thunder has
[1:17:25] added their voices
[1:17:31] so these standards have voices it looks
[1:17:34] like i'm preaching the seals
[1:17:37] everybody okay
[1:17:38] when they ordered their voices
[1:17:41] i was about to do whatever
[1:17:43] so if he was about to write
[1:17:46] these standards are not natural
[1:17:49] thunderstorms
[1:17:50] [Music]
[1:17:53] it is standards that have messages
[1:17:57] [Music]
[1:17:59] and these messages
[1:18:01] are spoken first as a voice
[1:18:05] [Music]
[1:18:08] do you follow me when it's voice you can
[1:18:11] only record them
[1:18:14] [Applause]
[1:18:19] everybody okay
[1:18:20] after recording them then you can write
[1:18:24] them
[1:18:26] [Music]
[1:18:28] so you may have this standard as a
[1:18:32] recording
[1:18:33] how you can have them as a riding they
[1:18:36] are both the same
[1:18:43] everybody okay so far
[1:18:45] is the time that complicated
[1:18:47] are the sales complicated
[1:18:49] is the message complicated
[1:18:57] and we don't understand what the tunnel
[1:18:59] is
[1:19:00] 17-17 what is the seventh year
[1:19:03] [Applause]
[1:19:05] everybody okay so far so when these
[1:19:08] standard order their voices i was about
[1:19:11] to do what
[1:19:12] and i heard i heard a voice from water
[1:19:17] saying unto me to water
[1:19:22] okay so before john
[1:19:28] translate
[1:19:31] oh before john
[1:19:33] immorphy
[1:19:35] the thunders
[1:19:37] from voices into riding
[1:19:40] god block him
[1:19:44] everybody here
[1:19:45] here he said don't put the thunder in
[1:19:48] riding
[1:19:51] by the water
[1:19:53] seal their thunders or seal their voices
[1:19:59] everybody here so the thunders now are
[1:20:03] mute
[1:20:06] [Music]
[1:20:07] yes
[1:20:08] [Music]
[1:20:11] here the thunder spoke
[1:20:14] and john took a seal and pulled one two
[1:20:17] three four
[1:20:19] [Music]
[1:20:24] so if you go where's the thunders
[1:20:26] i saw the thunders here where are they
[1:20:29] you will see a seal jumping around
[1:20:32] if you touch that seal inside the seals
[1:20:35] there are seven thunders
[1:20:37] so the only way you can release the
[1:20:40] thunder
[1:20:41] you must break that seals if you break
[1:20:43] that seal he release the thunder as long
[1:20:45] as that seal is closed you will never
[1:20:49] understand or heal the thunders anymore
[1:20:54] right here so that's why when you get to
[1:20:56] that seal you ask him what is going on
[1:20:59] that seal is just looking at you
[1:21:01] [Music]
[1:21:03] that seal is quiet
[1:21:06] [Music]
[1:21:08] did you get it
[1:21:09] did you get it
[1:21:11] that's why the seven seal
[1:21:13] is silence
[1:21:17] because inside the seventh seal contain
[1:21:20] the pandas
[1:21:25] everybody okay so far did i lose anybody
[1:21:29] hallelujah he said sear up those things
[1:21:32] which the time they did water
[1:21:34] and do whatever
[1:21:38] when he cried
[1:21:40] he cried like a lion roaring
[1:21:43] what does it mean ryan rowing
[1:21:47] lord help me
[1:21:49] hallelujah in almost 3
[1:21:52] verse 8.
[1:21:56] [Applause]
[1:21:57] is he complicated
[1:22:00] is he complicated
[1:22:03] is he complicated
[1:22:04] the scripture unfolding the scripture he
[1:22:07] said the lion has done whatever
[1:22:13] who will not water
[1:22:14] [Music]
[1:22:21] the lord god has what
[1:22:26] anybody here so the roaring
[1:22:29] of a lion
[1:22:31] is compared to the speech of god
[1:22:44] everybody must fear
[1:22:47] when the lord god has done what
[1:22:52] who can but what
[1:22:57] in other words when god
[1:22:59] speaks
[1:23:01] somebody must prophesy
[1:23:07] do you hear me
[1:23:08] god cannot speak without a prophet
[1:23:18] let me help you up again
[1:23:20] the speech of god
[1:23:23] that look like a lion roaring
[1:23:27] always require a prophet
[1:23:31] yes
[1:23:33] lion roareth
[1:23:35] the lord god has spoken
[1:23:38] who can but what
[1:23:40] not preach
[1:23:45] not sing
[1:23:46] when the lord god has spoken like a lion
[1:23:51] roaring
[1:23:52] he requires a prophetic gift
[1:23:56] to unfold what god has spoken
[1:24:01] everybody okay
[1:24:02] and in revelation 10 we found god
[1:24:06] speaking like a lion
[1:24:11] so who must speak on the earth
[1:24:15] a preacher
[1:24:17] a water
[1:24:18] that's why in revelation 10 7 he said
[1:24:21] bad
[1:24:23] but
[1:24:24] but
[1:24:25] it is still bad
[1:24:29] it is sealed
[1:24:30] but
[1:24:32] in other words even though it's sealed
[1:24:35] we got a way to decode
[1:24:39] and the way to decode is a prophet
[1:24:43] [Applause]
[1:24:46] everybody okay he said but in the days
[1:24:49] of what
[1:24:51] of the water
[1:24:52] [Applause]
[1:24:54] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:24:57] of god should be water
[1:24:59] as he has declared to his servant the
[1:25:02] preachers
[1:25:04] the ministers
[1:25:06] the singer
[1:25:08] the water
[1:25:10] why prophet there
[1:25:12] [Music]
[1:25:17] everybody here
[1:25:18] so when god rolls or when god speaks
[1:25:22] like a lion
[1:25:24] automatically expect a prophet somewhere
[1:25:28] because the prophet is the only one that
[1:25:31] can decode
[1:25:33] the speech of god
[1:25:35] that look like a lion
[1:25:44] [Music]
[1:25:46] are you preaching the seals no
[1:25:49] my subject this morning
[1:25:51] is the four phases of roof
[1:25:54] the sabbath
[1:25:57] [Applause]

[1:26:37] message and understand
[1:26:41] anybody here
[1:26:43] oh you shall do it
[1:26:45] do you see how many people miss brother
[1:26:47] branham
[1:26:48] and put the people in confusion
[1:26:51] because they didn't take the time to sit
[1:26:53] down and study deep

[1:26:58] don't need the deep things

[1:27:14] and then you bring your person
[1:27:17] and paper and write down this water
[1:27:21] this time and all about water
[1:27:25] what are you trying to say let's study
[1:27:28] together deeper
[1:27:33] when we look at the tabernacle
[1:27:36] with roof
[1:27:37] roof went to the present altar
[1:27:40] she made her decision and she moved from
[1:27:43] the present altar to deliver
[1:27:45] she accepted to die when naomi died to
[1:27:49] be buried over there and to be
[1:27:51] resurrected over there then she
[1:27:53] completed that part
[1:27:55] then she moved into the holy place where
[1:27:58] she was serving and serving over there
[1:28:01] roof have to complete
[1:28:03] her entire cycle
[1:28:06] of serving
[1:28:08] the bible says in roof chapter 2 verse
[1:28:11] 22 and naomi to roof her daughter-in-law
[1:28:15] it is good my daughter that that go out
[1:28:18] with his maiden in other words as you
[1:28:21] instruct him that the meat did not in
[1:28:24] any other water
[1:28:26] you must stay what where he told you to
[1:28:28] stay
[1:28:29] so
[1:28:30] she kept fast in other words she obeyed
[1:28:34] by the murders of boaz to glean
[1:28:37] onto their
[1:28:40] remember she came a day
[1:28:42] [Music]
[1:28:44] but now she's cleaning all the way to
[1:28:46] the water
[1:28:48] she's completing her entire circle of
[1:28:52] sanctification
[1:28:53] remember in the time of esther the
[1:28:56] purification was one year 12 months six
[1:28:59] months with men and six months with
[1:29:01] water you must complete the entire
[1:29:04] circle
[1:29:05] because sanctification will make way
[1:29:09] to the water
[1:29:11] once you reach the
[1:29:18] everybody here
[1:29:19] i'm gonna use three boxes
[1:29:22] everybody here
[1:29:23] this is your justification
[1:29:26] this is your sanctification and this is
[1:29:28] your baptism of the holy spirit as you
[1:29:31] traveling this way
[1:29:33] hey but here
[1:29:34] if you never made it here

[1:29:51] door will open
[1:29:55] everybody okay so far so roof
[1:29:58] she stayed until the end
[1:30:01] of barley harvest and off we have both
[1:30:05] harvard she completed all of them
[1:30:07] and she did what then
[1:30:15] it is important

[1:31:22] at the beginning
[1:31:23] and he certainly has made a target out
[1:31:26] of you
[1:31:30] he just does that because he knows what
[1:31:33] he can do
[1:31:35] he can deceive a woman a thousand times
[1:31:39] quicker than a man
[1:31:44] i know that hurt your feelings

[1:32:20] the women that got pregnant in

[1:32:25] pregnant but they never understood that
[1:32:28] environment they thought they could make
[1:32:30] it they thought they could stay
[1:32:32] themselves into an apartment before you
[1:32:35] know it you pregnant and you single
[1:32:37] mother
[1:32:39] thank you jesus because the devil can
[1:32:42] deceive you a thousand times more than

[1:33:30] hallelujah my god that is exactly what
[1:33:34] he done in the garden she was honest she
[1:33:37] was sincere but she was water
[1:33:40] you didn't mean to do bad things
[1:33:43] no i'm just going to college i'm going
[1:33:44] to stay in the camera you know you know
[1:33:46] i mean on campus i'm not going for
[1:33:48] anything before you know it you find
[1:33:50] yourself in this claim in this claim in
[1:33:53] this club in this club in the wreck
[1:33:57] because you didn't know what the devil
[1:33:59] is doing
[1:34:00] go to campus when time is finished get
[1:34:03] in your car
[1:34:04] go back home
[1:34:06] [Music]
[1:34:09] everybody here stay under your parents
[1:34:12] everybody
[1:34:13] roof will get all this benefit but she
[1:34:16] dwell with her mother in law she never
[1:34:19] left her mother-in-law
[1:34:20] because there was an fbi that was
[1:34:22] working
[1:34:23] watching roof all the time every move
[1:34:27] how did boaz know that she didn't run
[1:34:29] after the young man
[1:34:32] everybody here how
[1:34:34] do you know that scripture right
[1:34:36] how did he know that ruth never talked
[1:34:38] to a young man
[1:34:39] so there was camera everywhere
[1:34:44] everybody here there is an eye watching
[1:34:47] you everywhere
[1:34:49] you must stop posting that because what
[1:34:51] stephen will see it somebody else who
[1:34:54] was there will record you and post it
[1:34:57] [Applause]
[1:34:58] and you get in trouble
[1:35:01] everybody okay so far
[1:35:03] everybody okay so far so roof staying
[1:35:07] under the instruction
[1:35:09] of naomi under a total obedience she
[1:35:13] knocked into that door and roof now is
[1:35:15] entering into the holiest
[1:35:18] which is roof
[1:35:20] until the holiest which we're talking
[1:35:22] today about roof
[1:35:24] the sabbath
[1:35:25] anybody okay so far
[1:35:28] when we look
[1:35:30] microscopically
[1:35:31] ezekiel
[1:35:33] explained to us because that was a
[1:35:35] macroscopic view now this is a
[1:35:37] microscopic view ever here macroscopic
[1:35:41] everybody look good
[1:35:42] micro and then you get into the heart
[1:35:45] then ezekiel say you must have a new
[1:35:48] heart you must have a new spirit or you
[1:35:50] must have the holy ghost everybody
[1:35:53] so we know that the door whether you are
[1:35:55] born in the message or not you must go
[1:35:57] by the cross
[1:35:59] because inside of you
[1:36:01] microscopically everything looks bad
[1:36:06] when you go through the cross the cross
[1:36:09] changes you completely and give you a
[1:36:11] new heart
[1:36:12] then you have completed the first step
[1:36:15] of ezekiel you got a new heart
[1:36:18] that happened inside
[1:36:21] outside nothing changes
[1:36:24] all we did we saw a brother here going
[1:36:27] back we don't know what happening to you
[1:36:29] so the brother must give us a testimony
[1:36:33] that he truly believed
[1:36:34] that he gave his love to jesus christ
[1:36:37] and that testimony is your water baptism
[1:36:41] which is an outward expression of
[1:36:45] something that has happened inside
[1:36:47] that's why when you go to the water it
[1:36:49] doesn't change you
[1:36:53] everybody okay
[1:36:55] it's only an outward expression on the
[1:36:57] heart you're still the same everybody
[1:36:59] here so now you get into the candlestick
[1:37:03] where you find the messenger and the
[1:37:05] messenger will give you the appropriate
[1:37:08] show bread
[1:37:09] for your day
[1:37:10] because you must be watched or purified
[1:37:14] by the washing of the word by the word
[1:37:18] everybody here so when you go over there
[1:37:21] the more you're going under the
[1:37:23] purification
[1:37:24] process leader by leader your atmosphere
[1:37:28] begins to change
[1:37:30] everybody okay as you continue to move
[1:37:33] toward the altar of the essence finally
[1:37:36] you're gonna change completely and you
[1:37:38] have completed the second stage of uh
[1:37:41] ezekiel which you get what a new spirit
[1:37:45] now the problem is getting into the
[1:37:48] holiest because over there this is where
[1:37:50] you get to the third step you get my
[1:37:53] spirit which is the holy ghost but we
[1:37:55] found out last sunday that the key to
[1:37:58] enter the holiest brother branham said
[1:38:01] was obedience
[1:38:05] brother bottom says this in reminding
[1:38:07] you that blessed the bible says blessed
[1:38:10] are day that do his coming amen
[1:38:16] that they may have a
[1:38:18] right to water
[1:38:20] so when you are doing the commandment of
[1:38:24] god
[1:38:24] you have a
[1:38:26] claim amen
[1:38:30] amen when you do what god tells you to
[1:38:33] do
[1:38:34] you have a right to put a claim on god
[1:38:39] and god is under obligation
[1:38:42] to give you what you want because you
[1:38:45] have done what he asked you to do
[1:38:49] what are you talking about brother madam
[1:38:52] say full obedience
[1:38:54] to the whole world of god entitle you to
[1:38:57] the talking and what
[1:39:00] obedience is important
[1:39:02] that's why
[1:39:03] move out
[1:39:05] some people want to apply the blood and
[1:39:08] stay in
[1:39:09] you apply the blood
[1:39:11] and kick all the trashes out of the
[1:39:14] house
[1:39:16] they didn't say the holy spirit will
[1:39:18] come and kick the treasures for you
[1:39:23] no you the one that pick up the trashes
[1:39:26] and put them outside
[1:39:27] everybody
[1:39:29] and have a house cleaning time you women
[1:39:31] take her dick take off the water
[1:39:35] not the holy spirit coming and taking
[1:39:37] your clothes off
[1:39:38] this is the roof in the legalistic way
[1:39:41] you must apply the word everybody okay
[1:39:44] you men throw away them cigarette and
[1:39:46] you women too
[1:39:48] get all this all stuff out of your
[1:39:49] system here that is called water
[1:39:52] purification sanctification what are you
[1:39:55] doing you're getting the world off of
[1:39:57] you ever here why because if you love
[1:40:00] the world all the things of the world is
[1:40:03] because the love of god is not even in
[1:40:05] you so when you are ready to apply the
[1:40:08] token
[1:40:09] empty up and get water
[1:40:11] you can serve god and mama at the same
[1:40:14] time
[1:40:16] you gotta reject one
[1:40:18] so that the other one can get you
[1:40:20] yes clean up the cardboard
[1:40:23] clean out this house we have a good
[1:40:26] old-fashioned house cleaning let the
[1:40:28] blood be water
[1:40:30] and then the token will be water
[1:40:33] applied the word and the holy ghost will
[1:40:36] come
[1:40:37] clean out and do what
[1:40:40] is it complicated
[1:40:43] everybody here
[1:40:44] brother branham said full of jesus to
[1:40:47] the world brings what
[1:40:49] full obesity to the whole world will
[1:40:52] entertain you to the water
[1:40:54] full obedience
[1:41:01] if this is obedience everybody care you
[1:41:05] cannot do obedience halfway
[1:41:09] you must go all the way to the end
[1:41:12] you cannot be half you cannot beat three
[1:41:14] quarters or whatever you must be whole
[1:41:17] ever here
[1:41:18] not at the part of it as far as your
[1:41:22] denomination goes
[1:41:25] this is what happened to the rich young
[1:41:26] ruler
[1:41:28] when he came in
[1:41:30] he proved to jesus christ
[1:41:32] that he already fully obey
[1:41:34] the commandment of god
[1:41:36] but here in other words i need eternal
[1:41:38] life
[1:41:39] jesus said well have you done the
[1:41:41] commandment yes i have completed them
[1:41:44] all
[1:41:45] and jesus gave him the last test
[1:41:47] like they gave to saul
[1:41:49] he said the last test is what take
[1:41:52] everything that you have
[1:41:53] sell them away come and do what
[1:41:56] if that young man would have done that
[1:41:59] he would have right
[1:42:02] to claim jesus christ all the way to the
[1:42:05] end
[1:42:06] but here but he refused the last test
[1:42:10] and he took him to hell
[1:42:13] everybody okay the sarah phoenician
[1:42:15] woman came
[1:42:17] and expressed her need
[1:42:19] jesus looked and gave a test
[1:42:22] because she followed jesus
[1:42:24] she was crying have mercy on me have
[1:42:26] mercy on me have mercy on me and finally
[1:42:29] jesus turn around and give the last test
[1:42:32] and say i cannot take what i have and
[1:42:35] give it to dogs
[1:42:38] anybody here either you swallow dog
[1:42:42] or you reject the dog
[1:42:44] ever care but she was humble enough
[1:42:48] to accept the position of a dog
[1:42:54] when she accepts she said okay if you
[1:42:57] call me dog
[1:42:59] and you want me to be dog
[1:43:01] then dog i am
[1:43:03] and matter of fact as a dog i still have
[1:43:06] a right to eat
[1:43:10] because i'm a dog
[1:43:12] brother branham said the dog is the only
[1:43:15] animal that must live with a man
[1:43:22] brother bonham said that's the reason
[1:43:24] why the white man understood that the
[1:43:27] african was a human being
[1:43:30] because they found him with a dog so
[1:43:33] they understood the dog must live by
[1:43:35] human so these are human
[1:43:41] everybody here so if you want me to be a
[1:43:44] dog
[1:43:45] thank god i am a dog but a dog eat what
[1:43:49] human eat
[1:43:51] [Music]
[1:43:53] ever here so i need what food
[1:43:57] did jesus ask her another thing no
[1:44:00] jesus told her to pray
[1:44:02] did jesus told her god to the priest
[1:44:05] in other words she in other words in
[1:44:08] other words she shut god's mouth up
[1:44:12] [Applause]
[1:44:14] she silenced god
[1:44:16] like doubts a
[1:44:18] there is nothing against you can tell me
[1:44:20] i have done what you require to me jesus
[1:44:23] turn around
[1:44:25] [Applause]
[1:44:28] go
[1:44:29] your child is
[1:44:32] everybody here
[1:44:33] why because she wanted to obey even if
[1:44:37] it cost her her reputation
[1:44:44] everybody okay so far
[1:44:46] so jesus says and say if you love me you
[1:44:50] will keep my word and my father we love
[1:44:52] him and we will come together and make
[1:44:54] our water and that world and that and
[1:44:57] that word love goes with the keeping of
[1:44:59] the what the commandment everybody here
[1:45:02] so why is this holiest here important
[1:45:07] why is he important
[1:45:09] you remember there was a road
[1:45:14] that was air on the road
[1:45:16] back here that road was laying somewhere
[1:45:20] everybody okay and they picked that road
[1:45:23] and they chose it to be like this is
[1:45:25] going to be my stick
[1:45:27] hey but here that road was dried and
[1:45:30] there was nothing to the road
[1:45:32] but here
[1:45:33] before aaron put his name upon the road
[1:45:38] that road also was a snake
[1:45:41] [Music]
[1:45:45] if you look at that it looks like a road
[1:45:48] yes
[1:45:49] ever here but when they put it on the
[1:45:52] ground
[1:45:54] in egypt
[1:45:55] it was not the road of moses
[1:45:58] it was the road of aaron that they threw
[1:46:00] down
[1:46:01] when they got into egypt into the world
[1:46:05] in a worldly environment
[1:46:07] ever here when they put that road in a
[1:46:10] worldly environment
[1:46:12] he manifested the snake that was inside
[1:46:19] [Applause]
[1:46:23] everybody okay
[1:46:24] aaron was driving with that rod never
[1:46:27] knew there was a snake in it
[1:46:31] anybody okay
[1:46:33] you are driving around never knew there
[1:46:35] is a snake in your heart
[1:46:38] [Music]
[1:46:40] it takes is another environment
[1:46:43] and before you know it you find yourself
[1:46:46] dancing like a wild man
[1:46:49] because the snake will come out
[1:46:51] [Applause]
[1:46:53] with a certain beat
[1:46:57] that's why you need to watch the
[1:46:59] christian song
[1:47:01] you are listening to it
[1:47:04] not a christian song a christian
[1:47:08] some of them are pure worldly songs
[1:47:12] if you take the name of jesus christ the
[1:47:15] entire bit is worthy
[1:47:21] and when they put jesus they get the
[1:47:23] brothers and the sister in before you
[1:47:26] know it the snake get comfortable enough
[1:47:29] and the snake is out
[1:47:31] and now we are offended
[1:47:33] how can a sister dance like this no it's
[1:47:35] a snake
[1:47:36] that got really really comfortable and
[1:47:39] the snake have to break it down all the
[1:47:42] way to the floor then we know there was
[1:47:44] a snake right there
[1:47:45] so when you start breaking it down on
[1:47:47] the pulpit or in your reception we know
[1:47:51] who's coming out
[1:47:53] [Applause]
[1:47:55] we know who's coming out because in the
[1:47:57] church the environment is different
[1:48:01] it shocked the snake
[1:48:02] so you must behave a certain way but let
[1:48:05] them put you in egypt
[1:48:09] and when the two magicians threw their
[1:48:11] snake
[1:48:12] and they exposed the snake the other one
[1:48:15] also was already jumping
[1:48:19] jesus
[1:48:20] everybody here somebody's dancing but
[1:48:22] you see the brother tapping the foot
[1:48:24] like this you say brother this is not a
[1:48:26] christian song i'm sorry
[1:48:28] the snake is tapping
[1:48:30] but here the snake is tapping
[1:48:33] and when they take a song they keep the
[1:48:35] beat they say jesus christ oh this is a
[1:48:37] christian song then he jumped but the
[1:48:40] way they are dancing look exactly like
[1:48:42] the world
[1:48:45] [Applause]
[1:48:46] it's a shame
[1:48:48] the kind of music message believers are
[1:48:51] listening to them
[1:48:53] and calling yourself message believer
[1:48:56] it's a shame some of them they took even
[1:48:58] those music and they post it
[1:49:01] without looking at that
[1:49:03] when we look we say no problem i
[1:49:05] understand the snake that is in there so
[1:49:07] the snake was inside the skull here
[1:49:12] everybody okay so far
[1:49:14] so keep your snake in
[1:49:17] everybody okay
[1:49:19] everybody okay
[1:49:21] hallelujah there was this road was road
[1:49:25] but it was a snake
[1:49:28] but here it was already justified
[1:49:31] they picked the road
[1:49:33] they were grounding i mean
[1:49:35] they took the road they were using it
[1:49:37] only on the justification state
[1:49:39] anybody but one day the time came
[1:49:43] that they say we must take the road and
[1:49:46] we must prove
[1:49:48] he was not proving the road
[1:49:52] they were proving the high priest
[1:49:57] here that was the owner of the road
[1:50:01] everybody here so the vindication of the
[1:50:04] high priest required the name of the
[1:50:06] high priest to move from the high priest
[1:50:09] and to good place on the road
[1:50:12] and we have our own high priest his name
[1:50:14] is who jesus and when you take on the
[1:50:17] name of jesus christ
[1:50:21] here
[1:50:22] when they took that road and they took
[1:50:25] that road inside the holes
[1:50:27] the road burden
[1:50:29] [Music]
[1:50:32] everybody okay
[1:50:33] then he blossomed
[1:50:36] then he produces water
[1:50:38] [Music]
[1:50:41] and work here
[1:50:42] and god said to moses
[1:50:45] take that road away from aaron
[1:50:50] but here he cannot be managed by men
[1:50:53] anymore
[1:50:55] anybody here
[1:50:57] take that road
[1:50:58] open the ark of the covenant
[1:51:02] ever here
[1:51:04] and take that road and put it inside the
[1:51:06] ark
[1:51:07] and close it there
[1:51:08] in the presence
[1:51:11] the snake will never happen again
[1:51:15] you will never see the snake again
[1:51:19] the presence
[1:51:20] in egypt
[1:51:21] opened up the snake
[1:51:24] but the presence in the holiest
[1:51:27] did no longer reveal the snake
[1:51:30] but it revealed the
[1:51:32] identity that was hidden in the road
[1:51:39] ever here he was no more a snake that
[1:51:42] can swallow he was no more a snake that
[1:51:45] can bite he was no more a snake that
[1:51:48] would scare somebody but now it's
[1:51:50] hormone
[1:51:52] if i'm hungry now i can eat some fruit
[1:51:55] so if you want your life
[1:51:58] [Music]
[1:51:59] but here to stop exhibiting the snake
[1:52:03] you must enter into the holiest
[1:52:06] because the holiest
[1:52:08] will first stop the snake
[1:52:10] clean up the snake
[1:52:12] burn the snake
[1:52:14] and produce what you really are
[1:52:18] what god really sent you to do on this
[1:52:21] earth
[1:52:22] will begin to come up
[1:52:24] later by luna you're gonna blossom
[1:52:27] you're gonna bad and you want to produce
[1:52:30] fruit
[1:52:31] and the fruit of the spirit are love
[1:52:34] joy long suffering all of them will come
[1:52:40] [Applause]
[1:52:42] only when you enter in the holiest
[1:52:45] any question so far
[1:52:52] if it's important
[1:52:54] getting into the holiest our discussion
[1:52:57] up and up in ruth chapter 3. i'm good on
[1:53:00] time

[1:54:34] don't worry sit down
[1:54:37] she sat down
[1:54:38] and naomi opened up a new subject
[1:54:42] that she never opened
[1:54:45] she's the guardian to israel
[1:54:48] and the new subject
[1:54:50] that naomi open was the subject of rest
[1:54:56] follow me carefully
[1:54:59] and this rest
[1:55:00] is not just resting from a basketball
[1:55:03] game
[1:55:07] it is now resting from coming from work
[1:55:12] it is not resting because you want and
[1:55:14] you play a
[1:55:16] soccer it was not that kind of rest
[1:55:19] it is a rest that is connected with love
[1:55:23] [Music]
[1:55:26] it is arrested
[1:55:28] that concern a
[1:55:30] husband a race that concerns a union
[1:55:35] a race that concerns a marriage
[1:55:39] a vow
[1:55:40] a covenant
[1:55:41] a wedding
[1:55:43] ever here and that rest happened in the
[1:55:47] chapter
[1:55:48] in chapter three
[1:55:49] the word rest
[1:55:52] in the bible
[1:55:55] is called
[1:55:57] in the bible terminology in the greek
[1:56:00] the sabbath
[1:56:04] everybody okay
[1:56:06] what is a sabbath
[1:56:10] what is a rest
[1:56:19] means a day
[1:56:21] of rest
[1:56:23] that is what the old sabbath was a day
[1:56:27] of what
[1:56:28] so when you see rest it means what
[1:56:33] so when naomi say
[1:56:35] my daughter
[1:56:36] i must find rest
[1:56:39] what naomi was saying
[1:56:41] roof
[1:56:42] i must find a sabbath
[1:56:44] because roof was working
[1:56:47] and when she finished working she was
[1:56:49] going home to rest
[1:56:51] that was not the rest naomi was talking
[1:56:53] about
[1:56:54] edward
[1:56:55] because that one roof could have at any
[1:56:57] time she wanted matter of fact at
[1:56:59] mealtime boasts told the roof that if
[1:57:02] you want to rest and go eat go eat
[1:57:05] that's not the rest but this is a
[1:57:06] different restaurant it is the rest of
[1:57:09] the sabbath amen
[1:57:10] everybody here in other words my
[1:57:12] daughter i see you
[1:57:14] but it damn deep inside of you
[1:57:18] you are still agitated
[1:57:21] you are still babbling everybody here
[1:57:25] i want to quieten whatever is inside
[1:57:28] and make an end to that everybody here
[1:57:31] brother random say when you see rest in
[1:57:34] the bible
[1:57:35] it means
[1:57:36] sabbath
[1:57:38] look it up in your original manuscript
[1:57:40] if you happen to have a greek bubble and
[1:57:43] find out if the word if you got a
[1:57:45] scofield bubble look at the marginal
[1:57:48] reading on rest and see if it don't
[1:57:50] bring you right back to sabbath sabbath
[1:57:53] means water
[1:57:54] that's why roof today is this sabbath
[1:57:58] what is going on with the sabbath
[1:58:01] brother branham where we are where are
[1:58:02] those scriptures
[1:58:04] in exodus chapter 16 verse 23 the bible
[1:58:08] says and he say unto them
[1:58:10] this is that which the lord has said
[1:58:13] tomorrow is the water
[1:58:16] after
[1:58:18] so sabbath
[1:58:20] and rest are both of them connected
[1:58:26] lord help me
[1:58:29] so when we say sabbath
[1:58:32] in the scripture you cannot have a
[1:58:35] sabbath without rest
[1:58:38] everybody
[1:58:39] if you say rest or you say sabbath both
[1:58:42] of them are the same thing
[1:58:45] roof
[1:58:47] under the sabbath
[1:58:49] exodus 31st
[1:58:52] the bible say
[1:58:53] six days
[1:58:55] may work be done
[1:58:59] sorry
[1:59:00] i need this one
[1:59:04] six days
[1:59:06] may the work be done
[1:59:08] the day of the week
[1:59:12] first day
[1:59:14] second day third day
[1:59:17] fourth day
[1:59:18] sixth day
[1:59:19] a fifth day sixth day
[1:59:22] you can work accordingly
[1:59:26] everybody okay
[1:59:28] everybody okay
[1:59:29] you need to stay alert everybody here
[1:59:32] sixth day
[1:59:33] work may be done
[1:59:35] but in the water
[1:59:37] [Music]
[1:59:41] so the seventh day
[1:59:44] was the sabbath
[1:59:50] all the water
[1:59:54] hallelujah
[1:59:55] the seventh is the sabbath of rest
[2:00:00] holy to the lord whosoever does any work
[2:00:05] in the sabbath day he subbitually put
[2:00:07] you up
[2:00:09] no work
[2:00:11] go to your work on monday go to your
[2:00:14] work on tuesday go to your work on
[2:00:16] thursday all the way to saturday on the
[2:00:18] service
[2:00:20] remove everything
[2:00:22] don't work
[2:00:24] if you work they kill you
[2:00:26] why because the seventh was a day god
[2:00:29] say go home and rest
[2:00:33] what is going on
[2:00:35] roof resting
[2:00:38] brother bonham say
[2:00:39] seven
[2:00:41] which is the number of the sabbath
[2:00:44] everybody okay
[2:00:46] which is the number of the rest
[2:00:48] brother branham say this number seven
[2:00:52] is a number of completion
[2:00:57] everybody here so when you are building
[2:01:00] something
[2:01:02] and you finish it
[2:01:05] the proof
[2:01:07] that you have finished what you're doing
[2:01:09] you take number seven and you put it
[2:01:14] you follow me
[2:01:15] so when somebody is examining your work
[2:01:19] if they see number three you're not done
[2:01:21] yet if they see number six you're not
[2:01:23] done yet if they see number seven on you
[2:01:27] finish
[2:01:28] you don't have to be there come on only
[2:01:30] this way
[2:01:32] everybody okay
[2:01:33] brother madam says 7 is the number of
[2:01:37] completion
[2:01:39] and 3 is the number of what
[2:01:45] we know that 3
[2:01:47] is the number
[2:01:48] of perfection
[2:01:51] and brother branham opened here he said
[2:01:53] three is also the number of water
[2:01:57] now you understand when they say the
[2:01:59] brazen altar was five by three
[2:02:02] grace to bring you into perfection
[2:02:05] because you want to have life
[2:02:10] everybody okay so far
[2:02:12] now brother branham say true
[2:02:14] means life
[2:02:16] and seven means completion
[2:02:19] what does seven have to do with three
[2:02:25] everybody okay
[2:02:27] lord help me
[2:02:28] brother bottom say
[2:02:30] seven is the number of completion and
[2:02:33] this gives the complete what
[2:02:36] brother branham is saying that sabbath
[2:02:39] is number seven
[2:02:41] but sabbath is also connected to three
[2:02:45] and three give a complete sabbath what
[2:02:48] does it mean
[2:02:52] everybody okay so far
[2:02:55] what does it mean my brother
[2:02:57] i need this face here because we're
[2:03:00] going to use it everybody here
[2:03:02] what does it mean
[2:03:04] in the scripture
[2:03:07] there are three sabbaths
[2:03:12] follow me carefully
[2:03:15] the first sabbath
[2:03:18] is the sabbath of god
[2:03:23] everybody okay
[2:03:25] everybody
[2:03:26] okay the second sabbath
[2:03:30] is the sabbath that was given to israel
[2:03:37] in other words there are three sabbaths
[2:03:40] or three rest
[2:03:43] in the bible
[2:03:44] the first rest was the rest that belongs
[2:03:47] to god himself
[2:03:52] everybody okay
[2:03:53] the second rest belongs to israel
[2:03:58] and this rest that belonged to israel
[2:04:02] affected
[2:04:04] the human being
[2:04:08] he affected the animal
[2:04:13] domestic
[2:04:16] he affected
[2:04:18] the land
[2:04:21] and nature
[2:04:23] i'm going slowly
[2:04:26] shake somebody's hand
[2:04:28] and tell him wake up
[2:04:32] everybody okay
[2:04:34] everybody okay
[2:04:35] the third sabbath
[2:04:39] is the sabbath of the church
[2:04:46] where do you get
[2:04:47] this stuff
[2:04:51] brother branham says this
[2:04:53] that
[2:04:54] that was the third rest he gave
[2:04:59] the first
[2:05:01] god receive it
[2:05:03] from his work
[2:05:05] can you say amen
[2:05:07] the second israel received in the law
[2:05:12] the third the church received it as a
[2:05:15] part of what
[2:05:17] so the second rest is connected to the
[2:05:20] law
[2:05:21] and what do you expect the third to be
[2:05:23] corrected with you
[2:05:30] yes everybody okay so far
[2:05:32] brother branham say three is the number
[2:05:35] of what
[2:05:37] every time you see three it is what
[2:05:40] roof chapter three rest is speak of
[2:05:43] water
[2:05:44] notice when god created the earth
[2:05:47] on the third day was what
[2:05:50] the third day they came life on the
[2:05:52] third day of what
[2:05:58] if you read or you listen
[2:06:01] to brother branham like a parrot
[2:06:07] you will miss something right here
[2:06:11] anybody here
[2:06:12] you will only say brother branham say
[2:06:15] number three is life number three is
[2:06:18] life but you're missing something
[2:06:21] brother branham not only is he telling
[2:06:24] you what number three is
[2:06:26] but brother branham is showing you the
[2:06:29] method
[2:06:31] that he used
[2:06:32] to decode number three in the scripture
[2:06:39] do you see
[2:06:40] in other words the numerology of brother
[2:06:43] branham comes by the bible verses
[2:06:49] if you understand that
[2:06:52] you can trust any any numbers now in the
[2:06:55] bible that's why brother brother said
[2:06:57] four is the number of deliverance and he
[2:07:00] gave the example look at the four hebrew
[2:07:03] when he was in the fire what happened
[2:07:05] you see what i'm saying so you need to
[2:07:07] learn not on you need to read the
[2:07:10] message between the line and once
[2:07:12] brother branham gives you a key you can
[2:07:15] take that key and unlock every number in
[2:07:18] the scripture
[2:07:20] [Music]
[2:07:22] i'm not in numerology but i'm talking
[2:07:24] about something everybody here so
[2:07:26] through sabbath the first sabbath is god
[2:07:30] the second sabbath is israel the third
[2:07:33] sabbath is for the church this is what
[2:07:35] brother branham say where is that in the
[2:07:38] bible
[2:07:44] take hebrew chapter 4
[2:07:49] in this church
[2:07:51] the bible says
[2:07:54] because the message and the bible are
[2:07:58] amen
[2:08:06] so if somebody tells you brother brother
[2:08:09] is contradicting the scripture
[2:08:11] they don't know what they're talking
[2:08:13] about
[2:08:14] you don't play with a vindicated prophet
[2:08:19] anybody here
[2:08:20] hebrew chapter 4 if you dare you can say
[2:08:22] amen
[2:08:23] i'm good on time i'm just way down there
[2:08:29] in the deep
[2:08:30] with one service on sunday you eat
[2:08:34] you get dessert you go home you're good
[2:08:39] so don't complain
[2:08:41] oh no we have two services after he
[2:08:43] preached three out no no no no no one
[2:08:46] so you divided by two 150 150. 1.5 1.5
[2:08:53] go home everybody okay
[2:08:55] seven cosby one it takes care of the day
[2:08:57] everybody okay no complain
[2:09:01] hebrew chapter four it's a sense of
[2:09:03] humor body to just relaxes
[2:09:06] the spiritual muscles
[2:09:07] so you can soak this in you ready
[2:09:11] let us therefore do what
[2:09:14] in other words be careful
[2:09:17] lest
[2:09:17] a promise
[2:09:19] be left as
[2:09:21] of entering it remember on chapter three
[2:09:24] they missed it because of unbelief
[2:09:26] everybody care now we're on chapter four
[2:09:29] lest
[2:09:30] a promise be left us
[2:09:33] of entering into his what
[2:09:37] it's an it's a rest that you enter
[2:09:39] any of you should seems to come water
[2:09:43] in other words paul is saying be careful
[2:09:46] if there is any promise
[2:09:48] that is left for us to experience the
[2:09:51] rest of god
[2:09:53] we don't want any one of you to miss it
[2:09:56] anybody okay we want to see the three
[2:09:58] rest
[2:10:00] anybody okay
[2:10:02] for to us
[2:10:03] was the gospel preached
[2:10:05] as well as to them israel okay
[2:10:09] but the word preached
[2:10:11] did not profit the jews he didn't profit
[2:10:14] them not being mixed with what
[2:10:17] in them that did what
[2:10:19] that's why you can hear the message if
[2:10:21] the message was never revealed to you
[2:10:24] you won't get it
[2:10:26] after 20 years you can depart
[2:10:28] that's right because you never have a
[2:10:30] revelation of it
[2:10:31] oh he was a good brother he was a
[2:10:33] brother good but he didn't have the
[2:10:35] revelation
[2:10:36] everybody care
[2:10:38] verse three for we
[2:10:40] which have believed do what
[2:10:44] so the correct way that shows that you
[2:10:47] have believed god
[2:10:49] you must enter into the sabbath that's
[2:10:52] right
[2:10:53] what is the sabbath what is the rest
[2:10:57] ever here
[2:10:59] as he said
[2:11:00] as i have sown in my wrath
[2:11:03] if they shall enter
[2:11:05] into my rest although the work were
[2:11:08] finished from the foundation of the
[2:11:10] water
[2:11:11] so now paul is taking us back in
[2:11:14] eternity
[2:11:15] he says in eternity the work was already
[2:11:18] finished
[2:11:20] but we know that
[2:11:21] the lamb of god was slain
[2:11:24] before the foundation of the world
[2:11:28] so the rest was already existing
[2:11:30] somewhere
[2:11:31] anybody care
[2:11:32] but now we want to see that rest in god
[2:11:35] in israel and in the church but paul is
[2:11:38] already saying that israel god
[2:11:41] told them you cannot enter into my rest
[2:11:45] so there was a rest given to israel
[2:11:48] and paul said be careful
[2:11:50] if there is another rest for us
[2:11:53] we don't want you to miss
[2:11:54] so now you have the rest of israel and
[2:11:57] the rest of the church
[2:11:59] we're going slowly
[2:12:00] anybody okay
[2:12:02] verse 4 for he spoke in a certain place
[2:12:06] of the world
[2:12:08] on this wise and god
[2:12:12] rested
[2:12:13] the water
[2:12:15] from all his water
[2:12:20] [Music]
[2:12:21] so god worked
[2:12:24] and god also entered into his west
[2:12:28] so there is a rest of
[2:12:30] [Applause]
[2:12:32] god and there is the rest of israel
[2:12:36] and some people miss it to enter to the
[2:12:38] promised land and paul said be careful
[2:12:41] if there is a rest of the church
[2:12:44] pre-rest
[2:12:45] did brother branham give you the
[2:12:46] scripture today
[2:12:48] let's continue
[2:12:50] ever here
[2:12:52] and watch verse 4 for he spoke in a
[2:12:55] certain place of the seventh day on this
[2:12:59] wise and god did rest the seventh day
[2:13:03] from all his water
[2:13:04] which rest is that one
[2:13:07] the rest of who
[2:13:08] the rest of god watch verse six verse
[2:13:10] five and in this place again
[2:13:14] if they shall enter into mine
[2:13:18] which rest now
[2:13:21] the second rest everybody okay
[2:13:23] everybody okay
[2:13:24] verse six
[2:13:26] sin therefore eerie man
[2:13:32] which rest is that now

[2:13:40] if there are people that should preach
[2:13:42] this bible is the people that believe
[2:13:44] the message
[2:13:45] [Applause]
[2:13:47] [Music]

[2:14:51] we just talk one and that's it never
[2:14:53] engage again everybody here

[2:14:58] that some must enter the ring and the d
[2:15:02] and they to whom it was first preached
[2:15:05] enter not because of what again
[2:15:10] after the three verse seven number seven

[2:15:33] notice i am now israel gathered through
[2:15:35] moses
[2:15:36] now it's david speaking and david was
[2:15:39] the one who was a king but enter into
[2:15:43] the tabernacle and took the showbread
[2:15:45] and eat it and nothing happened
[2:15:48] because he was under the lineage of
[2:15:49] melchizedek
[2:15:54] everybody okay
[2:15:55] so that rest goes with a certain
[2:15:57] priesthood
[2:15:58] [Applause]
[2:16:01] but here because that's the first rest
[2:16:03] was under the law under aaron priesthood
[2:16:07] or leviticus priesthood but this one is
[2:16:10] the rest of the melchizedek
[2:16:15] did i lose anybody
[2:16:19] let's go verse seven again
[2:16:21] he limited a certain day saying in death
[2:16:24] not in moses
[2:16:27] everybody here
[2:16:28] today
[2:16:29] after so long a time after the time of
[2:16:32] israel
[2:16:34] as it is said today if you will hear his
[2:16:37] voice heard not your what
[2:16:41] if he
[2:16:42] for if
[2:16:44] jesus
[2:16:45] do you know who this this jesus
[2:16:48] let me let you
[2:16:49] read it yourself because you're going to
[2:16:51] say brother stephen say
[2:16:53] for if jesus
[2:16:55] had given them rest he's talking about
[2:16:58] the jews was jesus with the jew
[2:17:02] remember moses came and moses was never
[2:17:06] able to take israel to the promised land
[2:17:09] you remember it was who took them to the
[2:17:11] promised land
[2:17:12] it was joshua the name joshua in hebrew
[2:17:16] means jesus
[2:17:18] amen
[2:17:19] amen
[2:17:20] brother branham said jehosha
[2:17:24] yoshua messiah your sure jesus christ
[2:17:28] your sure is the name of jesus in hebrew
[2:17:32] that's why you heard the hebrew calling
[2:17:34] jesus yeshua
[2:17:37] [Music]
[2:17:39] everybody here
[2:17:40] it's the name of jesus in hebrew that's
[2:17:43] all if it is in english it is what
[2:17:47] means you sure joshua yoshua is just the
[2:17:51] same thing so because they took this
[2:17:53] bible into english that's why they
[2:17:55] translated as jesus
[2:17:57] but it means joshua if you look at a
[2:17:59] different translation it will tell you
[2:18:01] it was joshua anybody okay so let's go
[2:18:04] back to verse 8 for if joshua
[2:18:08] jesus
[2:18:09] had given them rest if joshua entering
[2:18:13] with them in the promised land gave them
[2:18:15] rest
[2:18:17] so why
[2:18:18] if joshua gave them rest
[2:18:21] everybody okay
[2:18:23] then would he not after lord
[2:18:26] have spoken of another
[2:18:29] in other words if joshua completed the
[2:18:31] rest
[2:18:33] they could never be given another rest
[2:18:36] but even though joshua gave them rest
[2:18:39] by putting them in the promised land yet
[2:18:42] god give another rest
[2:18:44] [Music]
