[18:02] god bless you
[18:05] [Music]
[18:06] god bless your church i'll try to try to
[18:08] be brief and i've been putting it off
[18:10] but um
[18:11] about a month a month and a half ago i
[18:13] came up and gave a testimony about being
[18:15] involved in an accident and i don't know
[18:17] if y'all remember but a car ran me off
[18:19] through when i came back on i didn't
[18:21] have control of my vehicle and i saw
[18:23] headlights coming into my driver door
[18:24] but god brought me out just far enough
[18:26] to where they hit my back end spun me
[18:28] out and landed in the ditch
[18:31] after that accident occurred the couple
[18:34] days later
[18:35] i went to the police department to get
[18:37] the report of the accident and i was
[18:39] leaving the police department and i was
[18:41] trying to merge into a lane no one would
[18:43] let me in but finally a lady stopped and
[18:45] honked and thought she was waving me in
[18:47] so i come in and then she hit the back
[18:50] end of my wife's suv i'm like lord i
[18:52] don't know what you're doing but
[18:54] mercy so i i got to the red light and i
[18:57] parked my car and i got out um i knew it
[19:00] was her fault but i was like i just
[19:02] don't want no more damages to a vehicle
[19:04] i don't want to go through another
[19:05] accident have it on my insurance so i
[19:06] got out and i went around the back of
[19:08] the car and there was nothing on my car
[19:10] i was like praise the lord and i looked
[19:12] at her car and there was nothing on her
[19:14] car i was like praise the lord so i went
[19:16] over to her window to knock on her
[19:17] window to talk to her at the red light
[19:19] and she wouldn't roll her window down
[19:20] she looked at me she wouldn't talk to me
[19:22] then she picked up her phone and took a
[19:24] picture of my license plate i'm like
[19:25] what's going on here i was like mercy um
[19:28] so i went around the back of her car
[19:30] took a picture of her license plate and
[19:31] i tried not talking to her again the
[19:33] light turned green i was parked at the
[19:34] lights i jumped in my suv started to
[19:37] pull away pulled over to the side of the
[19:38] road and she just turned and left so i
[19:40] was like well you know no damages we
[19:42] should be fine so i go home couple days
[19:44] later get a call from
[19:47] the police that
[19:49] she apparently called the cops reported
[19:51] me get a call from my insurance she put
[19:53] a claim on my insurance for
[19:55] uh
[19:56] damages to her vehicle and bodily injury
[19:59] and i was like
[20:00] man why why why so
[20:03] i called the police station i tried to
[20:05] give my side of the report and she
[20:08] they apparently were going my insurance
[20:10] was apparently going to pay her out
[20:11] because it was going to go as an
[20:12] accident on my record because i was
[20:14] merging and she had she had the lane so
[20:18] i was like that doesn't make sense
[20:19] because she let me in and then she hit
[20:21] me in the back
[20:22] but they're like since she possessed the
[20:24] lane and you were coming into the lane
[20:26] you're going to be found at fault i was
[20:27] like i never heard of that because my
[20:29] back of my end of my car got hit so it
[20:31] should be her fault but that was where
[20:33] my insurance was at she won all the way
[20:35] till the very end she spoke to my
[20:37] insurance and said the 60 70 year old
[20:40] man that hit me and they were like
[20:42] hold up what and it brought it all back
[20:45] and then they could tell it was fraud
[20:47] and they said our our uh our guy that we
[20:50] insure is not 60 70 years old he's a
[20:52] young man no the man that hit me was 60
[20:54] 70 years old and i saw that was the lord
[20:56] just though that that whole last month
[20:58] of my life i was just saying was trying
[21:00] to discourage me i had the one accident
[21:02] without a car only had liability on my
[21:04] car so out of car had to get a new one
[21:06] then driving my wife's car two days
[21:08] later getting another accident it's
[21:09] going to go on my insurance just one
[21:11] thing after then i purchased a new car i
[21:13] knew it had damage but i didn't know the
[21:15] extent of the damage but i want to take
[21:17] it to my mechanic they said the frame is
[21:19] absolutely terrible and you're
[21:22] it it needs a lot of work so i took it
[21:24] to auto body shop they held it for
[21:26] almost a month
[21:27] and got all the work done but turned out
[21:29] it wasn't as much as we thought it was
[21:31] gonna be turned out to be okay i'm still
[21:33] ahead on the car i could sell it and get
[21:35] my money back but the lord is good i
[21:37] just tried to i was so discouraged one
[21:39] thing after another but i just tried to
[21:42] remain at peace and just know lord i
[21:44] know you know what you're doing i don't
[21:45] understand it and it seems like
[21:47] everything's kind of falling apart for
[21:48] me but you know i know what you know
[21:50] what you're doing so i'm just going to
[21:51] keep a good attitude i told my insurance
[21:53] company the last time i spoke with them
[21:54] when they said they were going to pay
[21:55] the lady out i said i don't understand
[21:57] that at all she should have been at
[21:59] fault she hit the back end of my car but
[22:02] the whole reason why i called the police
[22:04] and reported it and i'm talking to you
[22:06] guys i'm telling you the true story i
[22:07] said i'm a christian and i just want to
[22:09] do the right thing so wherever it goes
[22:11] whatever happens i'm a christian i want
[22:13] to do the right thing so i tried to have
[22:14] a good attitude about it even though
[22:15] satan was trying to get me riled um and
[22:18] i thought i thought i was going to go in
[22:20] her favor but the last last thing last
[22:23] the very right when they were going to
[22:24] pay her out 60 year old man i was like
[22:26] she saw me knock on her window i don't
[22:29] know where she got that from but that
[22:30] was the lord just kind of handling the
[22:32] situation and i drove my car in today
[22:35] and it's running good it's all fixed
[22:36] it's uh
[22:38] it's good so i just know the lord knows
[22:39] what he's doing and i just want to
[22:40] praise him for just taking care of me
[22:42] through that last month and a half
[22:44] god bless you
[22:46] hallelujah
[22:51] i'm a little surprised at that because
[22:53] if she left the scene of an accident
[22:54] without a report being there that that's
[22:58] that's you know fishy anyways
[23:00] does anybody else have a praise report
[23:02] and then we'll move on to uh prayer
[23:04] requests i do have a couple of
[23:05] announcements

[44:53] god already spoke to abraham i will
[44:55] deliver your children out of her country
[44:58] that they will be slaves from egypt but
[45:00] i'm gonna strip the egyptian off
[45:03] from their wealth

[52:39] matthew 22.
[52:42] we read this over and over
[52:47] and hopefully we want to clench it today
[52:50] and jesus answered and spoke to them
[52:52] again by parable and say
[52:55] the kingdom of heaven is like a certain
[52:57] king which made a marriage for his son
[53:00] and sent forth his servants to call them
[53:04] that were beaten to the wedding
[53:06] and they would not come like queen
[53:08] vashti
[53:10] again he sent forth other servants
[53:12] saying tell them which are beaten
[53:15] behold i have prepared my dinner vast i
[53:18] have a place
[53:19] my oxen and my are killed and
[53:22] all things are ready come to the
[53:24] marriage the call is a call to the
[53:28] marriage we're gonna see today
[53:31] but they made a lot of it
[53:33] they make fun of the invitation of the
[53:36] king
[53:37] and went their ways
[53:39] one to his farm like kane
[53:42] tiller of the soul
[53:44] another to his merchandise
[53:46] the city of tower
[53:49] that prostitute
[53:51] that made trade with all the world
[53:54] and the remnant
[53:56] these are dropping right now
[53:59] and the remnant took his servant
[54:02] and he treated them spitefully and slew
[54:05] them
[54:06] ken killing abel
[54:09] but when the king heard thereof he was
[54:12] angry just like he was angry because
[54:15] queen faster refused it
[54:18] and he sent forth his army and destroyed
[54:21] those murderers and burned up their
[54:23] cities
[54:24] there are two mysterious war that
[54:26] unfolded in the book of esther
[54:29] and we're gonna see those wars
[54:31] [Music]
[54:32] i put those court like five years and
[54:34] left them alone and say one of this day
[54:36] we will need it and now those words
[54:39] unfolded in the book of esther two wars
[54:44] you're gonna get deep in the message
[54:48] they say
[54:50] then say the verse 8 here to his servant
[54:53] the wedding is ready there is a place
[54:55] there
[54:56] but there which were beaten
[54:58] were not worthy
[55:00] they were not worthy by their character
[55:04] amen
[55:06] by their response to the call their
[55:09] response to the invitation their
[55:11] response to the message of the seventh
[55:13] chamberlain
[55:16] rejecting the message of the seventh
[55:19] chamberlain proved that you were not
[55:21] worthy to begin with
[55:26] even though you were
[55:27] queen
[55:32] amen go you therefore into the highways
[55:37] now go everywhere
[55:39] into all the king provinces
[55:42] and as many as you must you shall find
[55:46] bid to what to marriage it is a call to
[55:49] marriage
[55:52] so those servants went out into the
[55:54] highways
[55:56] and gathered together all
[55:58] as many as they found
[56:00] both what
[56:02] aha
[56:04] when israel came out of egypt they were
[56:08] the true one and it makes what
[56:12] they call is pulling two vines
[56:16] are we okay
[56:18] there are many queens many concubines
[56:21] many virgins but only
[56:24] but yet they're gonna be called
[56:26] but only one will qualify
[56:29] are you there
[56:30] the servant of the king went into the
[56:33] highways they collected people left and
[56:36] right but under their collection they
[56:38] were good and bad
[56:46] they were a bad one
[56:48] and they were a good one if you read
[56:50] your church ages now you are ready to
[56:52] take off the airport
[56:54] amen
[56:56] so the servant went out verse 10
[56:59] into the highways and gathered together
[57:00] all as many as the fan both bad and
[57:05] and the wedding was what
[57:07] so when they call them they enter into
[57:10] this wedding place
[57:12] amen
[57:13] but inside the facility
[57:17] that they gathered into it
[57:19] inside the reception place
[57:22] not everybody that was there was good
[57:27] they responded to the call
[57:29] but not everybody that responded was
[57:32] good
[57:33] not everybody that followed moses was
[57:35] good
[57:37] even though they entered into the place
[57:40] yet among them they were bad people
[57:48] i'm reading the bible
[57:51] watch now who's gonna change it verse 11
[57:57] and when the king came in to see the
[58:01] guest
[58:02] so the king came
[58:03] and begin to inspect
[58:05] they just like who is this sister
[58:08] l'oreal okay
[58:10] who are you sister zaddy okay
[58:13] who are you brother divine okay
[58:16] amen
[58:18] when the king came to see the guest
[58:21] he saw there was a
[58:23] man
[58:25] which had not a
[58:27] wedding garment on
[58:29] he was within the
[58:31] the facility he has been called
[58:34] he has been poor
[58:36] he has been given a place as a guest
[58:39] but no wedding garment
[58:44] are we there
[58:46] nowhere in government
[58:48] and he said to him what
[58:51] he was not an enemy
[58:54] [Music]
[58:55] you see now
[58:57] jesus judas
[58:59] jesus called him friend
[59:02] but he was the son of perdition
[59:06] a friend that came from hell
[59:16] okay
[59:18] and when the king came and see the guest
[59:21] he saw there was a man which had not the
[59:23] wedding government
[59:25] he says to him friend
[59:27] how came you in here
[59:29] not having a wedding garment

[1:00:33] this morning
[1:00:34] but father you touch me and you heal me
[1:00:38] a new lord when i was sitting at home
[1:00:41] a thought came back to my mind that i am
[1:00:43] in the line of duty
[1:00:45] and because i am in the line of duty i
[1:00:48] spoke to the devil
[1:00:50] and that devil had to obey and to leave
[1:00:53] father we are reporting this morning in
[1:00:55] the line of duty because you told us

[1:01:01] need to gather together into your house

[1:01:10] father may your anointing job more this
[1:01:13] morning may you speak to us so
[1:01:15] minister to us remove every injuries
[1:01:18] lord seal the devil of various or evil
[1:01:22] thought away from this place and may
[1:01:24] lord father you minister madly to us
[1:01:26] this morning as we committed all unto
[1:01:29] the hand in the name of jesus christ
[1:01:32] amen
[1:01:34] god bless you good to see you all in the
[1:01:37] house of the lord
[1:01:38] we heard a wonderful sermon
[1:01:40] on wednesday with brother kelly
[1:01:43] seems like everybody is getting better
[1:01:45] and better
[1:01:47] now last week
[1:01:49] we were on part two of king a hazary's
[1:01:52] three-fist we spoke about the first
[1:01:54] fifth
[1:01:55] you remember that
[1:01:57] and we finished the second fist
[1:02:00] we're trying to get into the third feast
[1:02:03] which is part three
[1:02:05] when we were ending up the last feast
[1:02:09] we ended with the seventh day
[1:02:12] because the second feast have seven days
[1:02:15] of the feast
[1:02:16] and on the last day
[1:02:18] there was something that happened to the
[1:02:20] wine of the king
[1:02:23] and we found out that with that wine
[1:02:25] there was not an ordinary wine because
[1:02:28] on the first day the king never was
[1:02:31] drunk
[1:02:32] on the second day there was no
[1:02:34] stimulation that happened to the king
[1:02:37] on the third day there was no
[1:02:38] stimulation all the way to the seventh
[1:02:41] day and on the seventh day that was the
[1:02:45] day that a
[1:02:46] stimulation grows up from the wine and
[1:02:49] then got into the king
[1:02:51] and that stimulation brother brandon
[1:02:53] explained to us that it is a new wine
[1:02:56] it was it only happened on the seventh
[1:02:59] day because on the seventh day it was
[1:03:02] the edge of the revelation
[1:03:04] amen
[1:03:05] then the king sent his chamberlain
[1:03:08] to go ahead and get the queen
[1:03:10] and we found out that the last of the
[1:03:13] chamberlain was called carcass
[1:03:15] because the bible taught us that where
[1:03:17] the carcass is that's where the ego will
[1:03:20] be gathering
[1:03:22] and the caucus was crushed
[1:03:25] amen
[1:03:26] so there was seven chamberlain
[1:03:28] but one of those chamberlain was crushed
[1:03:32] like we spoke about the constellation of
[1:03:34] the little bear there were seven angels
[1:03:37] a seven star but one of the star was the
[1:03:40] north star which was crushed everybody
[1:03:43] there
[1:03:44] praise the name of the lord then we went
[1:03:47] down and we found out that not only did
[1:03:50] the king have seven specific chamberlain
[1:03:53] but the king also have
[1:03:56] seven princes
[1:03:57] are you there
[1:03:58] and those princes the last one of those
[1:04:01] princes was mammocan let's go to esther
[1:04:05] chapter one
[1:04:08] we're gonna blend now
[1:04:11] amen
[1:04:13] esther chapter 1 verse 14.
[1:04:16] if you dare you can say amen
[1:04:19] brother david if you can rise a little
[1:04:21] bit so i will save my voice
[1:04:29] if you dare you can say amen
[1:04:31] and the next to him was corsina one
[1:04:38] at mata
[1:04:44] that was the last one of the princes
[1:04:48] the seven princes of what persia and
[1:04:51] middles which were the seven pillars
[1:04:55] upon which the wisdom
[1:04:57] of
[1:04:58] the king
[1:04:59] was standing because those seven princes
[1:05:02] were wise men you remember
[1:05:05] it's right there in the scripture which
[1:05:08] saw the king face
[1:05:10] and we explained to you that when jesus
[1:05:12] was talking about the children he said
[1:05:15] do not let anybody abuse that young kids
[1:05:19] because their anger see the king's face
[1:05:22] the children are here
[1:05:24] but in heaven they have a representation
[1:05:27] and that representation sees the king
[1:05:30] face
[1:05:31] and in heaven before the throne of the
[1:05:33] king there are seven spirits
[1:05:36] which are the seven manifestation of the
[1:05:39] holy spirit throughout the seven church
[1:05:41] edges
[1:05:42] and those seven manifestations also
[1:05:45] immorphed themselves into angels
[1:05:49] and as angel they go to the messenger
[1:05:52] and they speak to the messenger are you
[1:05:54] there so you cannot have the fullness of
[1:05:57] god only with one of the spirit
[1:06:00] if you want to see the fullness of god
[1:06:03] you must have our seven spirit are you
[1:06:06] there but through the process of the
[1:06:09] church ages paul declared that he
[1:06:11] preached in part
[1:06:13] and the reason why paul preached in part
[1:06:15] because when the angel that went to paul
[1:06:18] begin to give paul the revelation of the
[1:06:21] age of ephesus before that angel unfold
[1:06:25] the entire revelation god cut that angel
[1:06:28] off and pull him out
[1:06:30] are you there then paul said whatever i
[1:06:33] preached to you it's just a part
[1:06:36] and the same process happened to arenas
[1:06:40] all the way to brother branham are you
[1:06:42] there but on the seventh day
[1:06:45] are you there all those seven angels all
[1:06:49] those seven spirits must come and to
[1:06:52] bring the left over of the other
[1:06:55] messenger because you cannot have the
[1:06:57] fullness of god with only one of those
[1:07:00] spirit it is one holy ghost but it can
[1:07:03] manifest itself through seven different
[1:07:07] ways
[1:07:09] are you there
[1:07:10] so don't spirit see the face of god but
[1:07:14] they must have someone on earth
[1:07:17] that can reflect them are you there just
[1:07:20] like a child have a representation in
[1:07:23] heaven the messenger also have their
[1:07:27] representation in heaven and those who
[1:07:29] representation see the king first
[1:07:33] are you there so they see the kingfish
[1:07:36] through the angels
[1:07:39] everybody clear
[1:07:41] and the bible says that they saw the
[1:07:43] king's face
[1:07:45] and which sat her
[1:07:47] the first in the kingdom that's the
[1:07:50] reason why if you remember wednesday
[1:07:53] when brother branham went to the sixth
[1:07:55] dimension
[1:07:56] are you there brother branham had the
[1:07:58] position elevated or higher than anybody
[1:08:03] brother branham saw himself sitting on
[1:08:05] the throne
[1:08:06] in a position higher because brother
[1:08:09] branham is one of the seven princes
[1:08:12] amen that sit higher in the kingdom
[1:08:16] when you want to deal with god you deal
[1:08:18] through those spirits
[1:08:21] are you there
[1:08:22] and because on the first day
[1:08:25] only one messenger comes
[1:08:28] on the second day only one angel come on
[1:08:31] the third day only one angel come on the
[1:08:34] fourth day one sixth one but on the
[1:08:37] seventh day
[1:08:38] because all the mysteries of god must be
[1:08:41] relieved with you all seven chamberlain
[1:08:45] must come together
[1:08:48] amen
[1:08:50] but if all seven comes there must be a
[1:08:53] messenger on the earth
[1:08:55] that is waiting for them
[1:08:57] and that seventh was memocan
[1:09:01] amen
[1:09:02] and carcass i told you on wednesday
[1:09:04] means the covering
[1:09:06] of the lamb
[1:09:08] which was crushed brother branham
[1:09:11] there he is with them angels
[1:09:14] the water
[1:09:16] so the cloud is your message
[1:09:19] amen you don't play with the cloud
[1:09:22] which was the
[1:09:23] seventh breaking of them seven
[1:09:27] because what brandon said every engine
[1:09:29] was a seal
[1:09:32] are you there praise the name of the
[1:09:34] lord air breaking off the seals that
[1:09:37] reveal serpentine and all these things
[1:09:40] here and it shows that it is the very
[1:09:43] water
[1:09:45] it is caucasian
[1:09:48] are you there when they take the picture
[1:09:51] of the seven engine and move it sideways
[1:09:54] it is crushed it is the lamp that appear
[1:09:57] but that lamp has a covering and that
[1:10:00] covering is carcass
[1:10:07] he shows that it is his very covering
[1:10:10] his supreme authority so the cloud the
[1:10:15] seven chamberlain are the supreme
[1:10:18] authority of the king
[1:10:21] when they are coming they are coming
[1:10:23] under the name of the king with a
[1:10:26] supreme authority
[1:10:28] that's why brother branham could sit and
[1:10:30] indict everybody accuse everybody under
[1:10:34] the supreme authority of the seven angel
[1:10:41] because the signet is given to mordechai
[1:10:45] the authority of the king
[1:10:48] the ring of the king is given to modekai
[1:10:51] are you there
[1:10:52] he is supreme he is what
[1:10:55] or what
[1:10:59] there he is
[1:11:01] his word is still what supreme which is
[1:11:04] the message and the word memocan means
[1:11:08] impoverished
[1:11:10] that's the reason why brother manna must
[1:11:13] be poor
[1:11:16] and the word mehmukha means also to
[1:11:19] prepare
[1:11:20] i will send you elijah the prophet to do
[1:11:24] what to prepare
[1:11:26] [Music]
[1:11:28] but his message is certain and true amen
[1:11:33] and memo can have seven letters brother
[1:11:36] branham have seven letters
[1:11:42] are you there
[1:11:44] what is carcass it's revelation 10 1.
[1:11:48] amen it is the mighty angel that is
[1:11:50] coming down
[1:11:52] there is seven angels but one of them is
[1:11:55] different
[1:11:56] the reason why he's different he was
[1:11:58] doing like this revelation 10 unfold to
[1:12:02] us that because he was coming with the
[1:12:04] open book
[1:12:05] are you there that's the reason why his
[1:12:08] chest was like this
[1:12:09] he was holding the revelation the
[1:12:12] stimulation of revelation the wine of
[1:12:16] the seventh day
[1:12:19] are you there
[1:12:21] brother branham
[1:12:22] another thing i want you to notice what
[1:12:25] took place what taken place and if you
[1:12:27] are listening to the table of the of the
[1:12:30] what time is it sir you will notice that
[1:12:33] one angel was very what
[1:12:37] notable to me the rest of them just
[1:12:40] seems to want to
[1:12:41] so brother branham say when he entered
[1:12:44] the constellation all other angels were
[1:12:48] ordinary
[1:12:49] they were ordinary because paul used
[1:12:52] them
[1:12:53] because iranians used them because
[1:12:55] columba used one because martin used one
[1:12:59] because luther used one because wesley
[1:13:02] used one that there was one that was not
[1:13:05] used yet
[1:13:06] and that one reflected to brother
[1:13:08] branham
[1:13:11] are you there
[1:13:13] but this angel was another danger
[1:13:16] he was to my left in the constellation
[1:13:19] in the form of a pyramid now the angel
[1:13:22] was to my left would really be there
[1:13:25] conquest order
[1:13:28] seventh angel if we would count them
[1:13:32] from the left to right because he was on
[1:13:34] my left me looking to him towards the
[1:13:36] west are you there
[1:13:39] him towards the east so he was looking
[1:13:41] to the east like this and brother
[1:13:43] branham also was looking toward the west
[1:13:45] in other words him and brother branham
[1:13:47] were looking facing each other
[1:13:50] because his face is reflected enough by
[1:13:54] men who can
[1:13:58] are you there yes hallelujah so
[1:14:01] that will be the last and just what
[1:14:06] very notable remember how he said how i
[1:14:09] said he had his got his head back and
[1:14:12] he's great sharp wings and how he flew
[1:14:16] right to me now this is duh
[1:14:19] and still uh
[1:14:22] so that caucus was the seventh field and
[1:14:26] the way the seventh seal opened
[1:14:28] when the bible was written brother
[1:14:30] branham said it was not written like
[1:14:32] this
[1:14:33] the bible was written in scroll
[1:14:36] they used to take and they wrote the
[1:14:38] squad
[1:14:39] and they put a seal
[1:14:41] and they take the second row and they
[1:14:43] roll it and they put it still and they
[1:14:46] put the third one and the seal so the
[1:14:48] seven seal was the last seal
[1:14:51] which was on the outside and you cannot
[1:14:54] open the other seal
[1:14:56] until you break the seven seal and when
[1:14:59] you break the seven seal then you can
[1:15:01] pen all other seals
[1:15:04] [Applause]
[1:15:05] [Music]
[1:15:08] hallelujah so at the time of the
[1:15:12] breaking of the seventh year there must
[1:15:14] be an angel coming down
[1:15:17] but revelation 10 1 cannot happen
[1:15:20] without revelation 10 7
[1:15:23] there must be an earthly angel
[1:15:25] waiting for a heavenly angel
[1:15:28] to sound the trumpet
[1:15:31] hallelujah
[1:15:34] memocan is your revelation 10 7
[1:15:37] which is a netflix angel we have a
[1:15:40] heavenly angel this is the throne of god
[1:15:43] and we have an earthly angel that is
[1:15:46] receiving message down
[1:15:48] hallelujah brother branham
[1:15:51] and how
[1:15:52] this angel down along the road messenger
[1:15:55] of the church ages luther wesley all of
[1:15:58] them open to a certain part that's why
[1:16:02] paul said part
[1:16:04] of that
[1:16:05] but in the seventh hour
[1:16:07] seventh day
[1:16:09] the seventh messenger
[1:16:11] that all this mystery should be finished
[1:16:14] see
[1:16:15] there's seven earthly
[1:16:18] not heavenly athletes memocan
[1:16:21] heavenly's carcass
[1:16:23] the seven earthly messenger
[1:16:25] this angel that he speak on
[1:16:29] he speak of them was on earth an angel
[1:16:32] means messenger and then after that he
[1:16:35] saw another angel coming down
[1:16:38] not the earthly angel that's memocan
[1:16:42] that had been given the message here but
[1:16:46] another mighty angel that carcass
[1:16:50] came down from heaven came from heaven
[1:16:52] with what rainbow all over him
[1:16:55] that's the one with the seventh seal
[1:16:58] brother branham said when the seals are
[1:17:00] broke and the mystery is revealed down
[1:17:04] comes the angel
[1:17:06] are you there the reason why there was a
[1:17:10] blast in sunset mountain
[1:17:13] god told brother branham when you go to
[1:17:16] sunset mountain you're going to have a
[1:17:18] blast
[1:17:19] if you need a coach you see me and the
[1:17:21] blast is a signal to you that the
[1:17:24] seventh seal has been broke in heaven
[1:17:28] and when it's broken in heaven it is
[1:17:31] sand on the earth and when he sat on the
[1:17:34] earth it blasted sunset mountain it was
[1:17:37] a signal that's why they thought brother
[1:17:39] branham go now to jeffersonville
[1:17:42] because you promised the church you
[1:17:44] cannot preach anything new except in
[1:17:47] jeffersonville so now you need to go
[1:17:49] back to jeffersonville
[1:17:51] but that didn't happen by any chance
[1:17:54] because if you take your one dollar bill
[1:17:59] and you flip it on the back
[1:18:03] you will see that on your dollar bill
[1:18:07] on the
[1:18:08] left side you're gonna see
[1:18:10] a circle with a pyramid
[1:18:13] are you there
[1:18:15] and with
[1:18:16] a capsule on you
[1:18:18] but if you look on the right side
[1:18:21] you will see an ego
[1:18:23] are you
[1:18:24] there are you there
[1:18:27] i understand my ego but in the mouth of
[1:18:30] that ego
[1:18:31] you'll see there is a scroll
[1:18:35] go check your dollar bill
[1:18:37] go check your dollar bill
[1:18:39] you will see a scroll
[1:18:41] that has been opened
[1:18:43] and
[1:18:44] put in the mouth of the ego come on are
[1:18:47] you there
[1:18:49] the constellation of the pyramid
[1:18:51] happened on the west side
[1:18:54] but the preaching must happen on the
[1:18:57] east
[1:18:59] this is where the ego have the scroll in
[1:19:02] the mouth
[1:19:03] that's why the angels say go back east
[1:19:06] go back to jeffersonville the mystery is
[1:19:09] beyond the dollar
[1:19:15] let me stay in tune here hallelujah on
[1:19:19] comes the engine
[1:19:20] the messenger who
[1:19:22] revelation 10 1 carcass
[1:19:25] setting his foot upon the land and upon
[1:19:27] the sea with a rainbow over his head now
[1:19:30] remember this seven engine is our
[1:19:34] memocan at the time of this
[1:19:37] in other words and when revelation 10 1
[1:19:40] come down revelation 10 7 is prepared to
[1:19:44] speak that's the reason why none of the
[1:19:47] seven priests spoke
[1:19:49] except memocan
[1:19:51] because he was the age of mehmukhan
[1:19:54] bhavanam continued here he say even
[1:19:56] those who are alive and remain until the
[1:20:00] coming shall not hinder them which are
[1:20:02] asleep for the trumpet of god should
[1:20:04] sound and the last and at that last
[1:20:07] trumpet when the last seal do what
[1:20:10] is broke and when the seven angel is
[1:20:13] what
[1:20:14] so the last cell in heaven is connected
[1:20:17] to the seven angel down are you there
[1:20:20] there is one heavenly one earthly
[1:20:23] one heavenly
[1:20:26] zero barbar
[1:20:28] zero babel
[1:20:30] and your high priest and there is one
[1:20:32] what
[1:20:35] everybody clear
[1:20:37] let's go now to esther chapter 19.
[1:20:41] we already left the airport now
[1:20:44] amen
[1:20:47] let's get to
[1:20:49] our sermon
[1:20:55] esther
[1:20:56] chapter 1 verse 19.
[1:20:59] this is the word of mehmukhan
[1:21:02] and he pleased the king
[1:21:05] and if he please the king mehmukhan is
[1:21:07] talking
[1:21:10] what authority have memo can to reject
[1:21:12] the king
[1:21:14] the queen
[1:21:17] if somebody have a gut to come and tell
[1:21:19] you you need to
[1:21:21] chase your wife away
[1:21:23] what authority have that person
[1:21:28] it is the supreme authority
[1:21:32] only under supreme authority
[1:21:36] are you there
[1:21:38] if there is trouble in the land
[1:21:40] if election we go to the supreme court
[1:21:44] the supreme court have a right to speak
[1:21:48] are you there
[1:21:50] esther chapter 1 verse 19. memo can say
[1:21:53] if he please the king
[1:21:55] let there go uh
[1:21:56] roar your commandment
[1:21:58] he's just a priest but he is proposing a
[1:22:02] royal commandment
[1:22:03] like the king is speaking
[1:22:06] let's go a royal commandment from him
[1:22:10] and let it be written among the laws of
[1:22:12] the persian and media
[1:22:13] that he be not what altar what is
[1:22:17] mehmukhan looking for that vashta come
[1:22:20] what
[1:22:22] no more before the king that's the first
[1:22:24] thing
[1:22:26] and number two
[1:22:28] and let the king give her a royal state
[1:22:31] which is a position
[1:22:33] to another that is better than
[1:22:37] faster was a queen
[1:22:41] you see that
[1:22:44] but there is a woman that is better than
[1:22:46] a queen
[1:22:49] you see now
[1:22:51] they were queens concubine virgin
[1:22:54] but that younger one is better than all
[1:22:57] of them
[1:22:58] so first she must beat queen vasa
[1:23:02] she must beat the concubine
[1:23:04] and she must beat all the virgins
[1:23:10] i'm still moving up to get the altitude
[1:23:13] the second is give her position to
[1:23:16] another
[1:23:17] if you go to revelation 18 7 you will
[1:23:20] see that deposit it say that i sit as a
[1:23:24] queen
[1:23:25] do you want to read it
[1:23:27] let's go to revelation 18 keep esther
[1:23:29] chapter one
[1:23:33] let's go to revelation 18 because we saw
[1:23:35] vasta was the roman catholic church
[1:23:40] let's go to revelation 18.
[1:23:43] there was a queen
[1:23:45] let's see what she say seven
[1:23:50] revelation 18
[1:23:57] verse seven
[1:23:58] how much she has what
[1:24:00] glorify herself
[1:24:03] and live deliciously
[1:24:06] so much torment and sorrow give her
[1:24:09] for she says in her
[1:24:11] like lucifer remember
[1:24:14] she says in her heart i sit uh
[1:24:18] you see that queen faster i see a queen
[1:24:22] and i am no
[1:24:23] and shall see no
[1:24:25] let's go back to esther chapter one you
[1:24:28] see now
[1:24:29] so queen vesta was married to the king
[1:24:34] are you there
[1:24:35] but when the king called her
[1:24:38] and she came in because she refused to
[1:24:41] come to the king
[1:24:43] memo can't say take her away
[1:24:46] and let her never
[1:24:48] come again
[1:24:50] to you and see your face no more
[1:24:53] in other words in plain language
[1:24:56] mehmukhan
[1:25:00] she was first married
[1:25:03] now men who can afford the divorce
[1:25:07] so there is a mystery of marriage and
[1:25:09] divorce that arrived
[1:25:13] okay
[1:25:14] it is in your bible
[1:25:16] are you there
[1:25:18] then that's the first thing the second
[1:25:20] thing she said give her position to
[1:25:23] another one
[1:25:24] but before that she said number one she
[1:25:27] cannot be a wife anymore
[1:25:30] and i'm giving a sentence on her she can
[1:25:33] no longer see your face that's why they
[1:25:36] have to be an indictment
[1:25:40] are you there
[1:25:41] so after the opening of the sales
[1:25:44] mehmukhan must preach marriage and
[1:25:46] divorce
[1:25:50] are we okay
[1:25:51] and men who can't must preach indictment
[1:25:54] to indict other churches
[1:25:57] for rejecting
[1:25:59] the word christ
[1:26:01] we okay now
[1:26:03] but mamuka cannot stop there
[1:26:06] he must give that position to another
[1:26:09] one
[1:26:10] are you there he must call him to
[1:26:13] another bride why are we giving that
[1:26:15] position to another one
[1:26:18] brother branham says notice in marriage
[1:26:20] and divorce
[1:26:22] he can what put her away
[1:26:25] but she cannot put him away
[1:26:28] he did it has proved it in the days when
[1:26:31] who
[1:26:32] because vasta have a feast of women
[1:26:36] all the churches luther baptist
[1:26:38] presbyterian all of them into ecumenical
[1:26:41] movement
[1:26:42] are you there
[1:26:44] luther wesley and pentecost when they
[1:26:47] refuse to become the
[1:26:49] so there was a further part
[1:26:52] of the kingdom
[1:26:53] not a regular part that paul gives
[1:26:56] not what arenas gives not what all the
[1:26:59] messenger gave but a further party
[1:27:03] when that further part
[1:27:05] came with the seven chamberlain
[1:27:09] they refused it
[1:27:10] are you there
[1:27:12] they felt a part of him
[1:27:14] by having spiritual
[1:27:16] sexual affair to become fragmented with
[1:27:20] the further part of the
[1:27:22] they rejected the message we don't want
[1:27:24] it no more
[1:27:26] enough with what we have
[1:27:28] you understand she refused
[1:27:30] the lutheran church refused for christ
[1:27:33] to have any more desire with her
[1:27:36] luther refuses and let me say this going
[1:27:39] to call me something anyhow so it is
[1:27:42] today
[1:27:43] with every one of them
[1:27:47] okay
[1:27:48] church of christ whoever you call
[1:27:50] all of them
[1:27:52] they fail to take the word
[1:27:56] they refuse who
[1:27:58] they refuse caucus
[1:28:00] are we okay
[1:28:03] and any woman that refuses a man his
[1:28:05] child has no right to be a wife to him
[1:28:08] only men who can't understand that
[1:28:11] are you there
[1:28:12] amen you remember in the bible when the
[1:28:15] king married who
[1:28:20] in your message
[1:28:22] okay because the queen did what
[1:28:27] he just got him another one
[1:28:30] what happened when she refused to come
[1:28:32] out with the king and obey him the same
[1:28:35] thing it is with a woman that refused to
[1:28:38] be wife to a husband
[1:28:40] so it is with the church that refused to
[1:28:43] become pregnant in the age that we
[1:28:48] servanted to bring forth children of
[1:28:50] this
[1:28:51] we are not
[1:28:53] it's already past we are not
[1:28:56] it's already passed we are not
[1:28:59] neither are we pentecostal we've got to
[1:29:02] be the children of this
[1:29:04] through the pregnancy of them
[1:29:07] the child of wolf happened only in the
[1:29:11] land of judah
[1:29:15] okay
[1:29:16] not outside roof must be separated with
[1:29:19] opera it is in the second marriage that
[1:29:23] roof got pregnant
[1:29:27] are we there
[1:29:28] through the pregnancy of the world to
[1:29:31] bring forth a child of this age
[1:29:33] the seed child amen i hope you
[1:29:36] understand
[1:29:37] could not be pregnanted
[1:29:40] no so what did he do
[1:29:42] put her away
[1:29:44] divorce democrat
[1:29:46] in divorcement that's right but she
[1:29:48] dares put him away he put her away so
[1:29:51] that mystery of marriage and divorce
[1:29:54] must be brought by memocan and not only
[1:29:56] that accusation indictment of the other
[1:30:00] churches then memo can open the choosing
[1:30:02] of the brothers
[1:30:05] are you there
[1:30:06] are you there
[1:30:07] that's why the choosing of the bride is
[1:30:09] preached after this here
[1:30:11] because there is a rejection
[1:30:14] of the message
[1:30:16] there is an indictment then there must
[1:30:19] be a choosing of the brand and after the
[1:30:22] choosing there will be the marriage of
[1:30:24] the land
[1:30:25] and there will be also the invincible
[1:30:28] invisible union
[1:30:31] [Music]
[1:30:33] are we there
[1:30:35] we okay now
[1:30:36] let's go now esther chapter two
[1:30:40] praise the name of the lord
[1:30:44] you don't understand brother branham
[1:30:46] chill out
[1:30:48] just believe
[1:30:51] when they bring you food you don't sit
[1:30:53] and say this is tomato where did it come
[1:30:55] from walmart or what swallow it
[1:31:00] after these things when the wrath of the
[1:31:03] king of hazaris was appeased
[1:31:05] he remembered
[1:31:08] remember the hole
[1:31:10] and what she has done
[1:31:11] and what she did what was decreed
[1:31:13] against her
[1:31:15] then say the king's servant not the king
[1:31:18] because the seven ninja when they come
[1:31:21] they will continue their ministry
[1:31:23] they drop down in sunset mountain
[1:31:25] and they went baptist with brother
[1:31:27] branham and every day they have to come
[1:31:30] and continue to give messages
[1:31:32] and they never stop
[1:31:34] because brother branham said the seven
[1:31:36] still when he begin
[1:31:39] he have a beginning
[1:31:41] but the seven seal is a seal when he
[1:31:43] opened he continued to open he continued
[1:31:46] to open he continued to open
[1:31:48] we will get to that
[1:31:50] are you there
[1:31:51] so then the king's servant that
[1:31:54] ministered to him the chamberlains
[1:31:57] are still talking
[1:31:58] they're still anointing
[1:32:00] okay
[1:32:01] let there be fair young what
[1:32:05] we just disqualify a queen
[1:32:08] okay
[1:32:09] all right
[1:32:10] now we are dealing with there
[1:32:13] thank you but those virgins must be
[1:32:15] beautiful
[1:32:16] queen vesta was beautiful
[1:32:19] but the beauty of the church is the
[1:32:22] the character of the people
[1:32:25] okay
[1:32:27] be fair young virgin sought for the king
[1:32:30] they must be sought
[1:32:32] we gotta go search them
[1:32:34] because the first that were invited
[1:32:37] refused the first guest of matthew 20 to
[1:32:41] refuse
[1:32:42] now they must call officer to go in the
[1:32:45] highway and begin to search
[1:32:49] are we blending the scripture together
[1:32:52] okay
[1:32:53] verse three
[1:32:54] and let the king appoint officer servant
[1:32:58] okay preacher
[1:33:00] you must preach appointed by the king
[1:33:03] not a pastor training you to be preacher
[1:33:07] it must be a call
[1:33:09] paul minister of god by the will of god
[1:33:13] not man
[1:33:16] okay
[1:33:17] the king appointed officer
[1:33:19] in all the provinces
[1:33:21] of his kingdom
[1:33:23] that they may do what
[1:33:25] many are called
[1:33:26] we are just gathering we are just
[1:33:28] pulling
[1:33:30] gather together all the fair young
[1:33:32] virgins
[1:33:33] to shoeshine the palace to the house of
[1:33:36] what
[1:33:37] so there is a gathering here
[1:33:39] the queen
[1:33:41] in his big palace
[1:33:44] there is a section in that palace which
[1:33:47] is called the house of women
[1:33:50] are we there
[1:33:52] which is the church
[1:33:54] amen
[1:33:55] when you get anybody you pull him there
[1:33:58] bring him to church
[1:34:00] bring him to church
[1:34:01] bring him to church from the nightclub
[1:34:03] come on from walmart come on from others
[1:34:06] on come on from whatever come on in the
[1:34:08] church
[1:34:10] are you there
[1:34:11] to the house of women the women to the
[1:34:13] custody of who
[1:34:16] hey the king's chamberlain
[1:34:19] keep her off the women and let the
[1:34:22] things for her
[1:34:24] purification be given to her we already
[1:34:27] explained to you that the process of
[1:34:30] going out
[1:34:31] and picking you up
[1:34:33] is called justification
[1:34:36] what branham say to justify means there
[1:34:39] is a glass in the mud
[1:34:41] and when you come
[1:34:43] and you pick up the glass from the mud
[1:34:46] you justify the glass
[1:34:49] are you there but the glass is still
[1:34:51] dirty
[1:34:52] you gotta take the glass and wash it
[1:34:56] to prepare it for a service
[1:34:58] that is your sanctification your
[1:35:01] purification
[1:35:02] but after picking up choosing
[1:35:06] justification
[1:35:08] and sanctification they must fill you up
[1:35:12] with water for the king to drink
[1:35:15] the feeling is your baptism of the holy
[1:35:19] ghost
[1:35:20] everybody
[1:35:22] so by going be being picked it is called
[1:35:25] justification but when you get in the
[1:35:28] house of reger they just pick you up you
[1:35:31] have many dirt you have your tradition
[1:35:34] you have your temper you have your
[1:35:36] problem but they're bringing you to the
[1:35:38] house off they called the lord to start
[1:35:41] your cleaning up because ephesians 5
[1:35:44] told us that you need to be watched by
[1:35:46] the washing of the world
[1:35:49] are we clear you must go through your
[1:35:52] purification
[1:35:55] buckle up pretty good because i'm in the
[1:35:57] correct attitude
[1:35:59] okay
[1:36:00] those who study their church ages
[1:36:03] welcome
[1:36:04] amen
[1:36:05] now let's go to verse 14.

[1:36:18] is everybody alert
[1:36:22] sister roof we alert

[1:36:48] hager
[1:36:50] we already explained to you that hey gay
[1:36:51] is the holy spirit that's right are you
[1:36:54] there
[1:36:55] because hege means meditation
[1:36:58] it means groaning it means word it means
[1:37:01] separation all those four attributes the
[1:37:04] holy spirit does it it's the holy spirit
[1:37:07] that separates you it is the holy spirit

[1:37:24] spirit and brother branham said matter

[1:37:36] the holy spirit using a preacher to
[1:37:40] preach the word and to get your heart
[1:37:43] and bring you to church
[1:37:45] but that same holy spirit that justify
[1:37:48] you must also sanctify you
[1:37:52] everybody clear

[1:49:07] if you met the king if you are chosen
[1:49:10] automatically you are the blood
[1:49:12] you are the bride above the queen vashta
[1:49:16] above the other virgin
[1:49:20] and above the concubine because many are
[1:49:23] called but only few chosen are we there
[1:49:28] but if you miss the king
[1:49:32] okay
[1:49:33] you're going to go down
[1:49:35] to the house of shiskas
[1:49:37] are we there
[1:49:39] there are some women that went into the
[1:49:42] house of chess guards and never was
[1:49:45] called back
[1:49:48] did they drop
[1:49:50] they took their name here
[1:49:53] they called her name here you are mrs
[1:49:55] orpah
[1:49:57] let's go
[1:49:59] oppa went here
[1:50:01] when she dropped there no more call
[1:50:05] are you there
[1:50:06] that's a catacle your first category is
[1:50:08] your brand
[1:50:09] your second category there are some that
[1:50:12] go there
[1:50:14] but the king called them back
[1:50:16] by name
[1:50:17] there are some that go there and the
[1:50:20] king don't call them back
[1:50:22] you are doomed forever
[1:50:25] you ready
[1:50:27] and there are some
[1:50:28] that never even was picked up as a
[1:50:31] virgin
[1:50:40] watch now you okay with the board
[1:50:46] when the first category
[1:50:48] is the category of
[1:50:50] lambda that have sheared them off
[1:50:54] no war
[1:50:56] are you there
[1:50:57] those categories enter like esther
[1:51:00] and picked up and become bride
[1:51:04] the wise version we okay now
[1:51:07] the second category is a lamb but with
[1:51:11] who
[1:51:13] okay
[1:51:14] because of who
[1:51:16] you need more work
[1:51:18] because you didn't get the first word
[1:51:20] so you're gonna go through the house of
[1:51:22] chess guys
[1:51:24] you're gonna be rejected by the king and
[1:51:26] you're gonna go to the tribulation
[1:51:28] period but you have a chance to come
[1:51:31] back
[1:51:32] but when you come back they only call
[1:51:35] you by name
[1:51:37] are you there
[1:51:39] but
[1:51:41] that name you're not gonna be the bride
[1:51:44] are you there the reason why they call
[1:51:46] you back because the king delighted in
[1:51:49] you
[1:51:50] and david psalm 1819
[1:51:54] says that when the king delighting you
[1:51:57] he's going to deliver you
[1:52:00] anybody
[1:52:02] the third that's your second category
[1:52:04] which is the foolish virgin
[1:52:07] are the righteous of matthew 25
[1:52:11] if you read your church ages you know
[1:52:13] where i'm coming
[1:52:14] are we okay because there will be in the
[1:52:17] last day
[1:52:18] jesus will separate the sheep from the
[1:52:22] goat you remember and they say lord
[1:52:25] where did we see you he said whatever
[1:52:26] you did to this list one you did it
[1:52:29] aren't you
[1:52:30] are you there they are saved but through
[1:52:33] tribulation and they are called back
[1:52:36] by name
[1:52:37] by record
[1:52:39] stay alert are you there
[1:52:41] the third category went
[1:52:44] they are good
[1:52:47] that's right
[1:52:49] are you there
[1:52:50] once they miss the king they go into the
[1:52:53] tribulation period
[1:52:55] and never to be called that is your
[1:52:57] mixed malted that start from egypt
[1:53:01] are you there
[1:53:02] and their name remember this their name
[1:53:06] will be no more call
[1:53:09] at the beginning their names were listed
[1:53:13] but right here their name is no more
[1:53:16] spoken of
[1:53:18] their name will be erased
[1:53:25] are we following
[1:53:27] hallelujah
[1:53:28] the fourth category
[1:53:30] are the
[1:53:32] black black goat
[1:53:34] they were even never chosen to begin
[1:53:37] with
[1:53:38] they don't they're good
[1:53:41] have their record here
[1:53:43] are you following me
[1:53:45] but once they go through chess guys no
[1:53:48] more record their name is used
[1:53:50] the last category never was even picked
[1:53:56] because when he was born
[1:53:58] the initia they initiated him
[1:54:01] to witchcraft
[1:54:04] are you there
[1:54:05] when he grows up he's a master in
[1:54:08] sorcery
[1:54:09] the more he grows up he begins to make
[1:54:12] shows of magician
[1:54:14] and he die a magician he has nothing to
[1:54:17] do with religious world
[1:54:19] his name was never even in the record of
[1:54:22] the virgin he came from hell and going
[1:54:25] straight back to hell

[2:21:16] verse 17. and the king loves to report
[2:21:18] all the women and she obtained what
[2:21:21] you see what it is not of work
[2:21:24] and
[2:21:25] faithful in the sight of more in his
[2:21:28] heart more than other
[2:21:30] there is many virgins many are called
[2:21:32] bada few chosen above all the virgin
[2:21:36] so that he said what

[2:21:48] sanctified of hege six months with
[2:21:50] marriage they have to die then six
[2:21:52] months with the rose of sheriff
[2:21:54] but the feeling of the holy spirit
[2:21:57] is a problem
[2:21:58] the foolish virgin went into tribulation
[2:22:00] because of lack of oil
[2:22:02] are you there
[2:22:04] but when he saw esther the king bring a
[2:22:07] crown and put it honestly
[2:22:09] the quran is what
[2:22:12] the quran is what
[2:22:14] the holy ghost watch this
[2:22:17] he is speaking of this great day that
[2:22:20] when the witness would come what is our
[2:22:23] the what
[2:22:25] you see one
[2:22:26] you see what
[2:22:28] we clear now
[2:22:30] the only woman that went that's why
[2:22:32] judah justified picked by god chosen
[2:22:36] judah could cast that devil do
[2:22:38] everything sanctify but to get to
[2:22:40] pentecost
[2:22:42] judah is killed
[2:22:44] are you there
[2:22:45] you there
[2:22:48] let's go number one the holy ghost
[2:22:52] podecran
[2:22:54] so that he set the crown upon her head
[2:22:57] do you see a camera
[2:22:59] everybody's seen that camera
[2:23:01] it's the bible when they say end without
[2:23:04] karma it's connected
[2:23:06] and they say karma and it's two things
[2:23:08] separate because we already taught you
[2:23:11] that there is a birth and there is your
[2:23:13] adoption
[2:23:14] the birth you are born that you need to
[2:23:17] be adopted
[2:23:18] esther had the crown pudding that's the
[2:23:21] baptism of the holy spirit but she must
[2:23:24] move from the crown to take the position
[2:23:27] of vastia which is adoption
[2:23:30] are we okay now now the holy ghost the
[2:23:33] crown is put on her head and then she
[2:23:35] take the queen bastard's position which
[2:23:38] is the holy ghost the bible said that he
[2:23:40] set the royal crown upon her head karma
[2:23:43] and made her queen instead of who
[2:23:46] she is better than vacher she's better
[2:23:49] than the concrete man she's better than
[2:23:51] all the virgins she was the only woman
[2:23:54] from her mother
[2:23:55] only one and she is also an invincible
[2:23:58] army because you're gonna see her her
[2:24:01] esther will destroy heaven and he's
[2:24:04] gonna destroy all the enemy
[2:24:06] the two mysterious war of este
[2:24:09] are you there
[2:24:11] are you there
[2:24:12] brother
[2:24:13] if you will just keep the word in your
[2:24:15] mind
[2:24:16] you will recall that nowhere does it
[2:24:19] says that we are in the mouth of god
[2:24:22] but what is in the mouth of the lord
[2:24:25] the word is in his mouth matthew 4
[2:24:28] but he answers say men shall not live by
[2:24:31] bread alone but by every word that
[2:24:33] proceeds out of the half of god yes sir
[2:24:35] the church is no longer the mouthpiece
[2:24:38] of god
[2:24:39] no more fasting
[2:24:41] okay
[2:24:42] it is on my face that still refuse
[2:24:46] so god is turning on her on esther now
[2:24:50] you follow me now
[2:24:52] he will confirm
[2:24:54] her through the prophet
[2:24:58] you see
[2:25:00] you see the prophet and
[2:25:02] now it's mordecai and esther
[2:25:06] either
[2:25:07] he would destroy the enemy through
[2:25:09] mordecai and esther
[2:25:12] through the prophet and the bride
[2:25:16] are you there
[2:25:18] he will destroy them through the prophet
[2:25:20] mordechai
[2:25:22] and the bride
[2:25:23] if you notice mordech brother pranam is
[2:25:26] sometime memocanda and sometimes he's
[2:25:29] mordecai if you go in the book of
[2:25:31] revelation you'll find that revelation 3
[2:25:34] 14 if i'm not mistaken the seven engine
[2:25:36] that's brought brother
[2:25:38] you go to revelation 10 7 that's what
[2:25:40] brother you go to revelation 18 1 that's
[2:25:43] rather random you go to revelation 18
[2:25:45] the angel on the sun that's still
[2:25:46] brother vernon you go to the revelation
[2:25:48] the seven engine with the seven
[2:25:51] file it's still brother branham it is
[2:25:53] one book but they give you different
[2:25:54] flavor of the same person
[2:25:56] are you there
[2:25:58] so memo khan brother branham monica
[2:26:00] revealing the son of man the king
[2:26:02] staying by taking the king chariot is
[2:26:05] still the ministry of brother branham
[2:26:07] he will confirm her through the prophet
[2:26:10] mordecai and the protester for the voice
[2:26:14] of god will be in
[2:26:16] that's the voice so that's why queen
[2:26:17] esther what do you want me to do because
[2:26:20] my voice is in queen esther
[2:26:22] mother can say if you keep quiet
[2:26:25] salvation in other words do you know
[2:26:26] that you were placed in that position
[2:26:28] for some time in other words you have a
[2:26:30] power that you don't understand
