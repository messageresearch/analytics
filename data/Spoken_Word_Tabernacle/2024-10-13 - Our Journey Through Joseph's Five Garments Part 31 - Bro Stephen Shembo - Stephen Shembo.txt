Lord I believe we are all up to date with the sermon and we're reading our Bible twice a day our cood our church ages 70 weeks of Daniel the seals adoption or somebody is listening to the message of the hour amen glory glory glory to God what is singing in the morning like this it just put you into the atmosphere young people Junior choir and brother Tony and uh sister zad everybody God richly bless you even the congregation God bless you let's give the Lord a big Happ you don't know what he does to create an atmosphere he makes it easy on the preacher so when we come we just soar into that amen glory to God our young Sisters Meeting it seems like we having a tough time getting uh something for December the best that I could see uh based on the speaker of the house it was uh December the 14th but December the 14th is our question and answer so the Deacon don't want they don't want to move that again because we already skipped one and the last time I have some few people that were not pleased because we cancel the question and answers so it seems like we were going all the way to January so please work together and see if you can coordinate all your busy schedule and if you can find something in December then we can work it up amen I got the material the problem is you it's your schedule so you put the schedule together I'm available amen am or cooperate with the Deacon somehow about December the 14th and see what a deacon can do about it then talk to brother Kelly and to brother Robert beg them and all kind of stuff so we can see if we can work it up amen I'm trying to get this courtship to the end and then blend into engagement because the Holy Spirit keep unfolding things little by little so you would know certain things for sure to make sure you know what you're doing amen amen we want you to marry good people amen and to be happy in marriage that's why I sent a photo two photos yesterday to kind of stir somebody they know what I'm talking about I know I'm going to St somebody I say sister Sharon say let's take a picture I say okay let me take that picture before they ask for it let it go where he's supposed to go before you know it a pastor I say oh my God glory to God they know what I'm talking about it's just to get you in the mood a little bit let me ask you a question because you're the one starting I was trying to go through my note you are you begin to pull me aside if your children don't see how you love your wife how will they know how to love their wife so you want them to learn on movie on Hollywood that's fake stuff they need to see Mom and Dad in love so they have a reference that when I get married this is the way I'm going to treat my husband this is the way I'm going to treat my wife amen so they need to see it from the pulpit all the way to the last place amen if daddy's always yelling and mommy is always yelling and back and fighting and everything guess what but thank God I will show you that you don't need to enter your marriage with your background there are a there is a background that you bringing but there is another background you don't bring it you have a choice to say my marriage won't be like [Applause] my if you don't understand my language let's go to the book of remembrance and you will understand even marriage through this book because I mean uh last night when I was sitting and meditating on this and the Holy Spirit show me how these things blend into marriage no matter how bad the marriage is you can start everything over amen we have a power of Resurrection but don't worry you will get to that amen so Lord's willing a married cou meeting is next Saturday October the 19th if you know what me and the Deacon went through suffering for this thing and the fight we had you will understand that it's a miracle for us to have this meeting next Saturday on the 19th it took God and I won't say it on YouTube because it's a miracle it's something that it crosses my mind and it's impossible to happen but the impossible was made possible they did it one time special for us sister roel knows what I'm talking about sister Pam knows what I'm talking about Deacon knows what I'm talking about it takes the grace of God so come and let's enjoy and pray because the Holy Spirit keep unfolding several things about marriage let's dig into it and then come up and see what we can do amen so we got the 19th booked and November 16th booked so you already heard me we clear so if you're struggling with a schedule I will keep you in prayer so God will allow the boss or the supervisor to free you so we can deal with this thing amen if he did it for what we went through he can do it for you you have no clue because I don't want to say it on YouTube but it took God to do this this is impossible it took God to do it and God did it at the last minute I even cancel everything and the flip they say you know what for the last for the first time we're going to allow you to do it go ahead and bring everything and let's move on it took the holy spirit so all the glory goes back to God Amen November October the 26 is our question and answer and then the youngmen meeting will be November uh November 9th following sister jerusa uh wedding she's going to have the wedding on Friday then on Saturday we go ahead and have uh uh the young men meeting so we can finish and start with you on courtship especially young men you need to know what you do it because you're the one starting not the sister starting don't say amen amen it is the man starting you need a quot I already gave you a quat for that you you remember the quot all so say amen amen ah praise God at the end of the service we will have uh a water of baptism so brother Robert if you can remind me so when we finish we go we head outside and go ahead and baptize someone amen glory to God so I believe I got everything clear if I forgot something brother uh Robert you can let me know but I believe all is clear brother John Porter told me take your time that's what brother John Porter told me take your time amen some are already shaking but what is coming up will free you for your lifetime every time I'm trying to get to that we're going slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly without this thing you will have a hard time believing you're going to handle the third pool amen let's free somebody this morning you ready let's go to Psalm 82 it's surprising we're still on one scripture for like a whole month okay amen amen amen my subject this morning is our life journey through Joseph's five garment part 31 the book of remembrance number two we clear follow me carefully because you have not traveled this road before you did well last Sunday and you remember what we went through so follow me carefully as we digging into this because the devil doesn't want you to listen to this amen but the time has come where are you going to be free one time and you will never question your salvation anymore amen you can't be in this message after 5 years you sit down and you wonder if you were saved or not or if you had the holy ghost or not enough with that amen let's deal with this Psalm 82 verse one let's pray flight attendant prepare for take off Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father we thank you for your grace for your love for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us Lord this is the best that I can do even the ability to sit here and to speak before the purchase of the blood of the Lamb it tookes Grace to do it Lord father may you move me and this audience visible and invisible out of the place so Lord father may we be completely out of the way may you be the one Speaking the one interpreting the one feeling the one touching the one blessing Lord father once again remember sister Christie remember Sister Amy remember all that are streaming that are sick Lord father may you touch them Lord father may you bless us this morning Lord may you speak to our soul lord we rebuke everything contrary to your word and whoever came here sick may they never depart from this place Lord sick but may they live with a testimony that it was good to be in the presence of the Lord be the alpha father and the Omega break every yoke from the devil lord and bless us this morning Father in the name of Jesus Christ amen let's go to Psalm 82 glory to God hallelujah praise God verse one God last Sunday I say do not a raise it's behind Okay praise God so you worked all righty make my life easy there we go you remember that again he say God stands in the congregation of the m he God not anyone else not the devil not the pastor God judges so who judge the devil so why do you let the devil judge you good you may be seated you know one time Jesus Christ was was tempted by the devil is that different he was tempted by the devil amen amen the first time Jesus responded by the word is he responded by the word he say it is written amen the second time he respond Again by the word that's right after a while Jesus pushed the break he say Satan you shall not tent the Lord your God in other words you've been playing games so much I want you to understand something I'm a human being but I'm almighty God I'm a human being but I'm the creator of Heaven and Earth I'm a human being but I'm the one who created you you are existing because of me so remember who the boss is you shall not tempt the Lord your God so you need to reach a point where you tell the devil you shall not judge [Applause] he is king of what and he is Lord of what so you cannot tempt the Lord I'm I'm waiting for that to so in your God you need to reach a point where you tell the devil you cannot judge me I am only judged by [Music] God don't worry my friend we will get there by God's grace we will get there don't worry my friend we will get there by God's grace jump to verse six if you can Oh Glory to God verse 6 say we got two records there you understand this clearly now I have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high God the most high amen but you know what he does you shall die like men and fall like one of the princes we found out that according to verse six we got a Divine record you remember that one and the Divine record have no trouble amen no problem no mistake no sins let me put that one day amen and on verse seven you got the natural record that's why God said but you shall die die death was introduced because of sin the day you eat thereof that day you shall die so it's sin that introduces death that's why Paul say death is the Wage of Sin are we clear the second record got difficulties trouble trials mistake and all kind of stuff are we to are we together so the first record is a positive [Music] record the first record have no trouble it's clear it is clean amen no problem no mistake amen no sickness amen no sin amen is he negative or positive POS it's a positive record we clear now the next one is a record that have all kind of trial trouble fall sins death difficulties crying everything is it a positive or A negative negative so we got a positive record and a negative record are we together brother Bram says this in the message God has a provided way we already pray my friend but to think this morning above all things that we have a loving savior who does what who loved us and care for us and know that this great tremendous task that we are going through and times and strength that we are is just the positive part of this [Applause] journey it is what so whatever you going through is a negative part of the journey I'm reading brother Bram now can you say Amen brother Bram says this again he says this is what we call life now amen is only a shadow or what so so this second record here brother Bram called that a shadow in other word it's not even the truth amen it's not the truth I know where to get you my friend don't worry it's not the truth amen we all like to Rejoice but we can Rejoice over the right thing that shows that we are hooked up with what when we Rejoice of a what brother Bram say when you rejoice over something that is right it shows that you are connected with what is right when we preach the word in the church and you are rejoicing over the word of God which is the right thing it shows that you and the word are connected [Applause] that's why you need to be careful being in church and sitting like this and not saying Amen to the word because brother Bram say when the right thing is coming up you must Rejoice over it if God Save Somebody you must be a you must be joyful about it if God heals somebody he must create Joy whatever is right is the source of your happiness [Applause] are we together are we together brother Bram say but when we Rejoice over the wrong thing it shows we are hooked up with the what so our life can tell right now what we are which way our emotion are doing what so whatever way you going you will know who you are that's why God judges you by your heart you might make a mistake on the outside but as long as your heart is learning for the right thing you know that I'm a Son of God I'm a Child of God I'm a child of the king because in me there is nothing wrong about me there is something about me that loves God that love to go to church that love to worship Him are we together are we together glory to God brother Bram says this that we realize that we are here in a negative form second record my friend and as long as there is a negative there has to be a what and our positive form is the D they cannot be a negative without a positive because it's because of the positive that makes what it is the positive that makes the negative it is the positive that create that's fine you will catch it up amen like you had a negative picture of some object there has to be an object somewhere or to strick the light strick that l or the would not be any negative so when we see our life here is in the what and knowing that we are the image of some life where then we know that there is a somewhere that the light has what and it's reflected something here where remember before the foundation of the word you used to praise God and when you get the connection back with your positive with your theop that's why brother Bram say when you recognize this message to be ego food you heard from your theop you heard from your [Applause] positive Hallelujah he says that there is the positive somewhere that the light has struck and it reflected something here on Earth and we are only what the genuine object is where somewhere so the true you is [Applause] God we already crossed this my friend you should be happy now the true you is go this one is a man that was given five CES like a bear or a monkey are we together but if you take the image of a bear and my image and you begin to bring them together it won't blend together are we together are we together are we together when the positive and the negative Mi together it is called the word made [Applause] flesh I hope I hope we okay I hope we okay the positive is the D part the positive is the word and the negative is the flesh it is your body and when the positive enter the negative when the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made the positive become and the two become what that's when you tell the devil you shall not tempt the Lord your God because I'm a human being 100% but I'm also God [Applause] are we together are we together are we together and we are living in the age where the positive have to become the [Music] [Applause] [Music] negative remember you cannot have this in the time of Paul no AG this that's why the one who overcome in this age will sit on the throne [Music] [Applause] William Marion Bram brother Bram say this stamps grow from what from Westley give him more volume my friend through Luther to Wesley to Pentecost and now he's horning out those what Pentecost and those that got the baptism of what the Holy Ghost and shall come one day the what head which is what Christ Jesus in this what last and we shall have a Ministry almost like his can you read this because when we say we are God you are afraid we want to put you only a little bit lower Jesus is here you are here we already know Jesus is husband you don't need to tell me Jesus is my husband I know he is my husband but I want you to know so that me and my husband we are [Applause] one if you don't agree with me look at the checkbook we have a joint account in other word even if he's not there my signature on the checkbook will be honored by the bank that's why he said the work that I do you shall do it and even how greater than who greater than who Jesus so you doing things greater than Jesus fight me with that it's a scripture fight me with it Jesus said you will do things great great than him it's a steak right don't worry my just swallow it brother Bram say he say we shall have a Ministry just what exactly like his What Spirit as he get how closer and what closer and what in other word Me and My Shadow begin to get closer and closer and closer until Me and My Shadow blend and you cannot tell who is me and who is my [Applause] shadow he said the negative becomes what afterward the negative and the positive do what together the church and Christ to make what for we are what and what amen you believe it it shall be light in the evening time [Applause] am I'm not preaching you in this church to become less than Jesus Christ the message of the hour wants you to become like [Applause] [Music] Christ me becoming like God I know how to handle that part and I will handle it my friend beginning today Amen brother Bram says this he say just like this when my shadow here of what my hand if I never seen my hand seen what the shadow it's kind of he get what as what get do you know that you wanted so much you have not seen your theophany you know that right you don't have to worry go in the mirror go to the mirror look at yourself you see the way you looking at yourself your theop look just like you the day you will see your theophany you won't be surprised you will be like hey you look like me and the the say you also look like me you say where were you all this time he said I was looking for you and before

you're doing good praise God Amen am we have intensified so much the negative record with our preaching I'm responsible to what I say with our preaching we magnify so much the negative record until when we begin to bring the good record it's now impossible to receive it you got drunk of the old wine and the good one was coming at the end that's why they say where where was this good one you

Luke 15 so we have magnified so much the black do amen every meeting repent leave your sin 15 years in the church no backbone no Doctrine Evangelical teaching evangelist will always zero sin all the time all the time until you get to a sermon they say something I didn't do it they said something I didn't do it they said something I didn't do it so now so what any more sins that you we need to come up with another sin to put it then when they come they say yeah God what language is that one we God sinning all the time being bitten down all the time we're going to remove it starting today my friend let's go to Luke 15 my friend if you thereare you can say amen amen Oh Glory Glory Hallelujah amen amen amen remember to win amalik you look at the hill Amen to overcome baac and B you need the BR Serpent and the smithing rock all of those are just Calvary Calvary Calvary when Israel begin to fight Amal Moses expressed the calvary because Amal attacked from the back amen he attack you when you are weak just like he attacked Jesus Christ when he was weak in other words he will never attack this record right here only the natural record because that is where your negative is are we together let's go to Luke chapter 15 if you thereare you you can say amen amen by Luke 15 we already established three records are we together before the Child leave home he leave a life there amen then when he left home everybody is acquainted to this life everybody everyone who been in church all over the world knows about this bad record here everybody know do you know the prodal son do you know the prodal son what comes with the prodal son the first thing he went and took the money and everybody remember that one this is the record right here then there is another record when he came back and the judge became the attorney or the lawyer are we together the attorney so whichever word you want to use amen jum to verse uh 17 and when he came to himself how many hired servant of my father have what bread enough and to spare and I perish with Hunger I will arise and go to my mother you know what it means now to my father and will say to him father I have Sinn against heaven and before you and I am no more worthy to be called your son you know what it means make me as one of your hired servant and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and r and fell on his neck and kissed him he took his sin away so the father was the atonement and the son say father I have sinned against heaven and in your sight and I'm no more worthy to be called your son but the father said to his servant bring forth the bom and put it on him on the criminal and put a ring on his hand and Sho on his feet let's stop right there let me pull this so we can climb higher now amen in Malachi 3 we found out that there is two kind of people there we got those that serve God Amen and that are keeping his ordinances and we also got the wicked amen and those that work wickedness so we got good deeds Good Deeds amen versus bad did amen the good deed here they are serving God they are keeping his commandment amen amen the bad one these are wicked they are proud the Bible says that uh they even tempt God Amen the problem is we expect this side here to be happy amen but for some reason looking on Earth it turned out that it's the opposite amen we found out that the sad part was this side right here and the happy part was the other side over there and because of this the book of remembrance open up or the book of memory open up are we together are we together brother Bram said there was a time me and you knew the only one who remain consistent with his knowledge is God but because we byass our now we forgot stuff are we together I'm skipping quickly so we can go it's just a quick review brother Bram say we me and you we can forgive but we don't forget but God can both forgive amen God can forgive and God can forget and brother Bram say I'm happy with this amen why did Brother Bram say he's happy with that back up my friend in Revelation 20 follow me carefully now my friend when we read Revelation 20 go ahead my friend Revelation 20 yeah it's right there verse 11 you can read it and I saw a great white he say I saw a great white Throne we found out that both Daniel and John saw the same thing you remember that when Daniel saw it God was not alone you remember that he was God plus a multitude of people thousands times thousand you know what happened amen but when John saw him he's alone amen but we know that the bride is somewhere yes sir because it's the same SC and John say I saw a great white throne and him that s on it I did this so you don't have to turn around turn the uh back to that from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and I saw the dead how small and great when John saw these dead people the Bible say the dead were small and they were great in other words he was every age amen let me call this young and old are we together he saw them in different ages follow me carefully stand before God and the books were open amen we got books plural remember that one and this is different than the book of life we already established that last Sunday right am amen he says and the books were open and another book singular we clear was open which is the what book of life so it's two separate amen many books and the Book of Life and the dead the small and great Are We There were judged out of those things which were written in the book of life because the Book of Life only contain names are we clear The Book of Life only contain names but these books contain things amen and they contain works and they were judging people based on that amen and the Bible says and the Sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and Hell deliver up the dead which were how in when somebody is coming from hell is he a seed of God keep that and they were judg every man according to their what word so every book was a record of somebody are we together but what I'm trying to show you here is John say that the dead were small and great brother Bram says in the message in when Jesus died he goes up down there I can see him on Friday afternoon after his death brother Bram knocks knock on the door of the region of the Lost amen let's follow him a minute the door opens amen there was women come on there was Men come on there were what young ladies and they were what old they were all together in that Hest place called the prison of what lost souls so in Hell people that goes to hell have different ages amen I told you to put your seat belt my friend because if you die as a sinner whichever age you die is the way you going over there are you following me if you die 18 years old if we go to hell we find you 18 years old if you die at 79 years old if we go to hell you are still 79 years old that's why in the white great Throne when they day that deliver up they are coming up with different ages the prophet and the Bible are perfectly in line are we together but thank God there is another region which is the sixth dimension of the region of the sa over there everybody that goes there have the same AG if you die 8 years old and you are bad if you die 12 13 years old you are bad you going to hell and in hell you will be 13 years old when you come back for judgment you 13 years old but there is a mystery when God created Adam he never created him a baby Adam was not an old man Adam was at the age that he can marry so God created a [Applause] youth from the dust of the ground which was a preview because those that are going in the sixth Dimension are not going to be old they're not going to be younger brother Bram babies die but when brother Bram saw the baby he was a [Applause] grown there are stuff that are leaking in but I'm trying to stay out amen amen the baby did not really reflect the theophany but it didn't change the theophany the baby died baby but when you see the baby it's back again in the theophany sometime you might die a 90 years old but when you get there the theop will accommodate they will manage to bring you down if you a baby they bring you up if you an old man they bring you down because there is only one door one entrance one [Applause] Edge Have I Lost somebody have I lost somebody have I lost somebody have I lost somebody so if we go back to our reading here we found out that the small and great comes from hell are we there and they were judged by books we okay now we okay now we okay now but when we saw last Sunday amen we found out that when brother Bram interpret the books brother brandham say books plural was open and every man was judged out of those books the things were written therein you remember last Sunday that's why I usually say keep up with the sermon and brother Bram said look the books were open he saw him coming and 10,000 times 10,000 ministering to him sent come with him is that right in Daniel and the books were open books plural brother Bram say those books that is the book of your life these books are the books the book of your amen not the book of life this is William Marion Branham so you say Amen to that Amen brother Bram say every man was judged thus come the what sinner who's judge so these books are books for The Sinner we going somewhere now my friend are it's booked for who but remember me and you were Sinners can you say Amen me and you were sinner born in sin shape how inity coming into this word doing what like journey journey you remember we also were sinner but what happened to our books hold on my friend hold on my friend it doesn't excite you yet it doesn't excite you yet you heard that book you heard it but we need to know what happened to that book you heard the record there was a record called brother div sister charene you had a record sister Naomi you had a [Applause] record and let me help you up my friend brother Joe this record this record are not human record these are Divine record it is the record of God human record do you follow me if the court get burned and the computer get burned they can lose your record unless they keep it in the cloud but this one the Bible said no M can enter in heaven so what is written in heaven nobody you don't have any cooperation you cannot bring your judge friend to go there and remove it in heaven it is an eternal [Applause] record are we together are we together let me call it forever record so it works like that amen it's a record that God did it if God have a record who can take it off from God in other way you Doom you won't remove it God still have it who can go to God and remove the record and you have the record because me and you we were sinner please I beg you follow me carefully are we together are we together are we together brother Bram say sinner judge th I'm going to go back again here brother Bram says this in the Patmos vision he says the books were open Daniel 7 what n the books is it singular or plural plural were open that is the book of the sinner hallah I'm read my friend I don't have a message to preach to you I'm preaching the message of brother BR so please don't say Amen to me say Amen to the message because when you rejoice on the right thing we know where you coming from and amen amen ah these books are the record of the what the book of the SE the book of your life and the Book of what sin in other word it's a book of your sinful life how many record do we have two record we got a positive and we got a what negative so this book is a book of sin a book of your life which record is there keep up my friend Lord help me amen he says and the Book of the C and another book was open who came with him and brother Bram ask a question who came with him who came with God to the Judgment seat Church from what he said [Applause] oh hold on my friend you say brother stepen that's after the Rapture hold on my friend amen he says 10,000 times what 10,000 times what of thousand came with him and did what ministered his what wife the what the bride oh Oh [Music] Glory his wife came with him the what the church me and you were Sinners I'm good amen amen how many be in the court maybe you got a speed ticket or something you know no problem just be honest amen okay no problem all right when you get to the court where do you sit you sit on the pit or on the congregation congregation on the congregation if you notice the church is set like a cat that's why Paul said judgment beginning in the house of God are we together are we together later on if I put my office right here amen the judge don't enter from there the judge usually come from here and sit right here with his hammer bam and he started everybody else sit over there right then when you see the judge coming sometime it might be two or three people coming they all wear some kind of robe and in the Judgment seat of God when they put the throne we see God coming up and when God is coming up someone is following [Applause] God the but but I got a I got I got a point that person that is following God was a sinner how did he get through that door do you follow me how did he get through that door who put him over there which university of law did he go to study law to be the general attorney of somebody to be sitting beside the judge follow me carefully my friend he will save you for the rest of your life amen Amen brother Bram says this he say who did Daniel see coming with 10 of th000 times 10,000 the the saint remember the Saints shall judge the world let's go slowly my friend the books were what open for who Sinners another book was open which was the what book of life for who sleeping virgins I'm reading brother Bram so the Book of Life is open there not for the Brad [Applause] do you follow me when we preach about the Book of Life The Book of Life got two sections are we together are we

section called the lamps the lamps what Book of Life Book of Life amen the what so it belongs to who the lamb it is the Lamb book of life it is the life of who the life of the Lamb if you want to know the life of the Lamb you get there but the Bible say The Book of Life open not the lamp's Book of [Applause] Life are we together if I lost you raise your hand this is not a game my friend okay and brother Bram say when this book of life open it is to find out the full virgin because they need to be saved we need to make sure they are in the record before they go into heaven because if you don't go to the heaven you go into the Lake of Fire only two [Applause] [Laughter] choices he says you see the message of the hour people think we have to preach Jesus save you from the sin it's true we save that we preach that we need to preach that but the message got a meat when you begin to preach that we preach that to those that are already saved it is something different he begin to make a distinction listen listen listen because remember when I'm going through this you keep my minute you need to return my minute back okay because you're the one doing that okay okay you are engaged with

coming up you man not be ready together it but we're going to get to that he said all things we can't speak of all things but all things our are ours through who Christ if he spare not his own son to bring this to us how much more will he bring if willing if we are willing to receive now I can't speak of all things but I want to speak of one certain things of these what and I think that it is a what an important thing that is what hard I love the word actually the word means release from what oh and what experience that is to everyone who has had an experience of itth to be released from what Lord help me Mark this Hebrew 9 chapter the 11th and 15th verse the worshiper once Purge has no more what if you are really pardoned the very guilt the very what desire has left you it is all gone Purity god with genuine par so if we claim pardon amen and still not pure how can we claim pardon when pardon generate Purity don't worry flat attendant prepare for Ling where you separate from your first Union by what spiritual death now you are born again or what remarried again to the new what spiritual union of not your natural life of the things of the world but of what eternal life that germ that was in you at the beginning it did what found you now your old book is what gone with your old what union your new name in your own book has been what now you say do you mean to tell me that my old book God put it in the water see of his forgetfulness you stand how before who God father help me up if I did it if I did do it I am how guilty but you could forgive me and I would not be how guilty but yet I'm not what justify because I actually did what done it don't worry my friend he says but the word justify is as though you what never done it amen it's never even what regarded at all how is it done in God's book of what see your forgetfulness your old book and marriage is divorce and it is not even in the memories of God Amen you are Justified therefore being what Justified he was how you was what accused you never done it what in the first place the old Union is in the water you was not married to it to begin with he the bridegroom B what shame himself for you in your place he took your place for you were predestinated for him to be his bride before the foundation of what the world the Bible said what you are the predestinated was let me finish with this my friend let me say this to you my Christian friend our attorney is also our judge our judge became our attorney the case is what settled when we receive his what pardon the judge himself came down and became what the attorney and the attorney and the judge is what the same person God became that we must judge justify Man by his own what that he Place upon what Hallelujah that means what he deserve all Praises our judge and attorney is what same person what is there to fear the Judgment that fall upon him at the cross at the grave and when he descended was for us he absorbed the full breath of the wound of sin and there is therefore now what no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus see forur our is what our judge he's both attorney and judge and the judge and as judge the case is what settled it is how finished there is now what no condemnation why should the church Fe what promise has he ever failed to manifest before us why should should he feel punishment or death he has all been what overcome he is what the mighty conqueror he's the one who conquered both the world of the seen and what the Unseen why is the Brad in judgment and there is no book against the Brad because the book of the Bride your personal record God took it and God pardoned it do you follow me and God took that and put it in God's feet of forgetfulness where the devil cannot even fish now the father who was your judge is the one who defend you he is now your attorney do you follow me do you follow me but brother Bram say when he take this book right here and he throw that in the in the in the sea of God forgetfulness behind him he open up a new book what is in this new book amen what is in this new book because remember remember the old book contains sins if God ever remember that he punishes you that's right but in the in Malachi 3 there was another book of remembrance when God open it huh when you going through headache God open that one follow me again how many record do we have two this one if God open it you do but when when you suffering because you serve God because you stood for God there is another book both of this book are in the memory of God so the memory of God contain sections there are section that could be erased and there is a section that cannot be raised are we together are we together are we together there are things about you that God don't want to remember he cleaned that up but there are something about you that God need to remember sir and when God remember that something must happen to you Amen Let Me Close by this my friend I I'm P 6 minutes if God according to brother Bram ever open the book your old book God will kill you do you follow me God took that negative record amen and destroy it and brother brandham say he open up a new record amen amen in that new record if they old record when they open it God is about to kill you what about they had a record when he open it what will he do to God toward you two record my friend you go meditate on this the first record if they open it if God look at that he sent judgment God remove it there is another record of you follow me carefully we will get to that in the Bible when God open the record if the first record send judgment what would the second record said because there those that feel God begin to Mur that we serve God and we are still suffering we go to church we are suffering been praying we are suffering then God say let me get the record but remember your old record is already destroyed so there Reon another a record of you that God has to pull because of your [Music] condition I don't know if you getting me I don't know if you getting me if you sick in the hospital and God pull your first record and he look he said this is a sinner like this he said this is Ahab kill him take him this time and move on with him kill him amen amen amen amen but for you amen when God put his hand on his pocket there is not two record it's only one it used to be two when God pull he will say which one is the bad this is the bad one now God has only one way not a two way only one way when he put his hand like this and he pull it there is only one record but he opened that record when you begin to complain and going through heartache I'm going to close by this the record is open when the devil pressurize you then God pulled that record and you're going to see what that record will do because they just were already murmuring they say look at the the wicked is Happy look at this and the Bible say when they change their conversation God say bring me those books a little bit let me read a little bit about when God begin to read about it Hallelujah you will see what is in that book and what we God will do amen amen amen that's the reason why on the Judgment Day you are not one to be judged you are entering with him and you are sitting with the judge judging the world because there is no record of you but there are record of you that are kept what is God keeping in you that's why brother brandham say when you sin God eras it from hisou memories but God does and eras everything because he need to remember you amen amen amen amen have I left you something to meditate am let's close by this my friend one time Moses was at the mountain and he was doing his uh chores his work that he got amen and suddenly he saw a burning bush amen and when the Burning Bush was burning without any trouble and he turned around he say what is this he want to move somebody say what this I am the god of Abraham I'm amen I have heard the cry those cry has been there for 400 years why didn't he respond the first year it was not time yet but I remember the Covenant something about Abraham something about what I told Abraham came down he came back to my memory in other words it seems like God woke up and say what time is it say hey I have an appointment then he jump he said Moses the time has come what are you doing forget about it I got a stick that's not a stick look at that stick throw it in the ground in other word when God rememberers something amen look he was connected with the suffering of Egypt amen the remembrance was connected with suffering amen and what came out of that remembrance destroy Egypt and pull Israel let's stop right here remember one thing your record your bad that you always remember because brother Bram say we forgive we don't forget just remember know your makeup you won't forget but now tell that part of you that don't forget that even though you remember just know that it doesn't exist amen yes sir there is a time for those who are married amen when you first put the ring it looks like something is in your hand those who got married knows what I'm saying when you go you feel like they put something new in your finger they put something new in your finger you go take a shower something is there after a while after a while you don't even realize that you have a ring that ring become part of you so you become unconscious of the wiing until somebody tells you you I love your RNG amen that past the way you were built as a makeup you won't forget it and the devil will always ride there Amen to renew all those things back to your memory but you need to tell him listen listen my friend that book I know what you're talking about but you always tell half of the story you never tell the truth you always give your part when you get the whole truth is it's exactly I did it but I want to ask you a question all these records you are bringing back to my M where are they where is that book produced The Book you can only talk but I want to see evidence if you don't have evidence of the book don't talk to me no more because God destroy the evidence if he want to talk to you bring the evidence but in God see a forgetfulness no one can go there and pull it even God himself let's stand my friend these things are hard for human being amen amen when you approaching God In Prayer when you approaching God In Prayer never mention what you did in 1947 because you're wasting even his time I don't know if you get what I'm saying amen because if you coming before him with 1947 in your mind you're not going to be able to pray right because you appearing like that bad man that was doing bad stuff is again approaching you that's not the case my friend that record is gone he doesn't remember that record as much as you remember it as much as they Court heaven he does him and no one judges the God Only God and that judge is your attorney and his judgment is final so you have to choose who you going to listen either you going to listen to people either you going to listen to yourself or you going to listen to God his word is true amen amen stop visiting that old house sometime take those old pictures you know the picture that you were wearing pant in the whole word burn them because they are they are remanding you what you are doing because the judge won't reminded if he remind you you're not going to stand in his presence but if you remember it you you're going to be complex but when we are we approach the throne of grace we must approach it with boldness am chew on what we went through then we're going to take the second part of these books and see what are in these books if our books of Sinners are destroyed do we have have another record what is that record for what is God doing with that record we have separate the record of sin to another record let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we approaching you humbly again this afternoon father thanking you for your grace for your love for your mercy and for destroying our old book written with our names with everything that we have done that was bad that the devil keep tormenting our heart our mind constantly reminding us of the past failure of the past mistake father we just establish what this book is but I pray that the Holy Spirit can take this and and drive this down into marriage life because there is a portion of marriage a record of marriage that was filled with fighting with argument with backbiting with trouble until if it was not for your grace one would have walked out of the marriage but father you kept your children TI together and despite the fact that they stayed together those record have created scars and the memories has been filled with them that every time a decision need to be taken we go back to those record and we fish in those record and we filter things through those record before we can make a decision and because of that we still constantly in fight in trouble in marriages because we never let those record go but father may you help each one of us each family Lord that Lord father you can give us Grace that which CH a record we have for one another that we messed up in the past that we made a bad decision a bad family decision a bad financial decision a bad move in buying this and that and because of that he has been remanded over and over and it caus a complex it caus a lack of trust it causes difficult beares and we cannot progress the right way because of these memories father May the blood of Calvary drop down in our life may they drop down in our marriages may they drop down in our relationship Lord so that that blood can wipe away those record and may father you put a block between us and those bad memories so that every time we want to think over it may Calvary Step Up May Lord father you remind us back again that remember what I did for you why do you want to go back that R why do you want to go visit that house back again why do you want to go
