[49:02] Lord As We Gather here on this Wednesday
[49:04] afternoon
[49:06] father we're very well aware that we're
[49:08] not here in this building by ourselves
[49:10] Lord but father there's an unseen host
[49:12] of angelic beings that has lined the
[49:14] walls of this assembly father Lord we're
[49:17] not here as denominational-led people
[49:19] but father we're here as people that's
[49:22] been taught by a Vindicated prophet and
[49:24] he is declared in this generation that
[49:27] there would be an angel that would meet
[49:28] us and would escort us to the seat where
[49:30] we would even sit and Lord there would
[49:32] be there would be a great Warfare it
[49:34] would break out in the service between
[49:36] the power of God and the power of the
[49:38] enemy and Lord that the enemy would do
[49:40] everything he could to beset your word
[49:42] and to defeat your people from receiving
[49:45] that word but Lord your Prophet said
[49:47] that it only takes one to believe that
[49:49] word and every devil will be defeated so

[49:54] than one here but Lord I believe there's
[49:56] a house full of Believers here Lord and
[49:58] I believe as we join our little Elixir
[50:00] fire together and Lord we make that one
[50:02] great Pillar of Fire come down Among Us

[50:16] under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[50:18] and father I pray Lord that you would
[50:20] drive out every Spirit of tiredness oh

[50:27] God and Lord may you bring a Unity of a
[50:30] liberty father or that your word could

[50:34] blessing upon our brother Steve and O
[50:36] God upon his family Lord upon this
[50:39] assembly father as he or have been

[50:57] wonderful name of our Lord and Savior
[50:59] Jesus Christ we do pray and all the
[51:02] believer says
[51:04] a man and amen if you have your Bibles
[51:07] tonight we want to turn to the Book of
[51:08] John The Book of John the 12th chapter I
[51:11] have a couple places I want to read with
[51:13] you tonight but we'll begin here in the
[51:15] Book of John the 12th chapter and while
[51:17] you're turning there we do want to say
[51:18] God bless you all this evening God bless
[51:20] you brother Stephen we appreciate the
[51:22] invitation to come and the grace that
[51:24] the Lord has given us to be here tonight
[51:25] I I want to say it's always an honor to
[51:28] come this way and to speak to the people
[51:29] and be in service and I tell you I have
[51:33] to say you have a very gracious Pastor
[51:34] he's been going back and forth with me
[51:37] for a few months on dates and the Lord
[51:38] finally give us a Grace and made a way
[51:41] for us to be here tonight and we we sure
[51:43] appreciate that brother Steve and it's
[51:44] an honor to be here and we also glad to
[51:47] have our in-laws you're with us tonight
[51:48] and of course to have my wife with us
[51:49] and baby Malachi back there is growing
[51:52] up quickly on us so we're sure glad to
[51:54] have them and I tell you I
[51:57] ought to feel special tonight we've been
[51:59] on the road for about three weeks and I
[52:01] just got home Monday night and I figured
[52:04] I'd be at home resting this week but
[52:05] here she is on the road with us again so
[52:07] we're sure thankful to have her with us
[52:09] tonight and we just trust the Lord to
[52:12] speak to your heart tonight in the Book
[52:13] of John the 12th chapter
[52:15] and then the 23rd verse I know this is a
[52:18] very familiar reading to you the Bible
[52:21] said and Jesus answered them saying the
[52:24] hour is come
[52:26] that the son of a man should be
[52:28] glorified now brother Remus says that's
[52:31] the forming of the body of Jesus Christ
[52:33] and watch the 24th verse here's where he
[52:36] picks this up on the formation of the
[52:38] Bride verily verily I say unto you
[52:41] except a corn of wheat fall into the
[52:43] ground and die it abideth alone
[52:46] but if it die it bringeth forth much
[52:50] fruit so the shuck pulls away to give
[52:53] the wheat a chance to ripen before the
[52:56] sun which the prophet said is the
[52:58] message coming right back into the
[53:00] church again forming the full body of
[53:04] Jesus Christ which is the perfect body
[53:06] to receive the perfect head except the
[53:09] corn of wheat die and fall on the ground
[53:11] and die at abideth alone but if it die
[53:13] it bringeth forth much fruit now in the
[53:17] book of Colossians the first chapter
[53:18] those that you study the message I know
[53:21] you do this is Brother brahm's text and
[53:23] the powerful sermon he preaches on
[53:25] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[53:28] and in Colossians 1
[53:30] in verse 9 Paul here says for this calls
[53:34] we also since the day we heard it do not
[53:37] cease to pray for you and to desire that
[53:40] you might be filled somebody say field
[53:43] you might be filled with the knowledge
[53:45] of his will and all wisdom and spiritual
[53:49] understanding that ye might walk worthy
[53:53] of the Lord unto all pleasing being
[53:56] fruitful in every good work increasing
[53:59] in the knowledge of God strengthened
[54:01] with all my according to his glorious
[54:03] power unto all patients long-suffering
[54:06] with joyfulness giving thanks unto the
[54:08] Father which hath made us meet to be
[54:10] partakers of the inheritance of the
[54:13] Saints in light who hath delivered us
[54:16] from the power of darkness and hath
[54:19] translated us into the kingdom of his
[54:22] dear son now I want to look one other
[54:25] place if that's okay in the book of
[54:27] Galatians the fourth chapter
[54:29] the book of Galatians the fourth chapter
[54:31] I believe we're speaking here tonight
[54:34] from the scriptures on the seed amen
[54:36] coming to the fullness and in Galatians
[54:38] 4 I love here what Paul says in verse
[54:41] number 19
[54:42] Galatians 4 and 19 Paul says my little
[54:47] children of whom I travail in birth
[54:50] again until Christ be formed in you
[54:54] if you skip down to the 27th verse he
[54:57] says it is written Rejoice thou Barren
[55:00] that bearth not break forth and cry thou
[55:03] that traveleth not for the desolate hath
[55:06] many more children than she with hat
[55:08] which hath and husband now we Brethren
[55:11] as Isaac was now watch Paul connect us
[55:13] to Isaac we are a the children of
[55:16] promise but as then he that was born
[55:19] after the flesh persecuted him that was
[55:21] born after the spirit even so it is now
[55:25] so the battle did not stop thousands of
[55:27] years ago but that battle has come right
[55:29] into this age where this flesh is
[55:31] persecuting the spirit but nevertheless
[55:34] what saith the scripture cast out the
[55:37] bonds woman and her son which is Hagar
[55:40] and Ishmael for the bond for the son of
[55:43] the bonds woman shall not be Heir with
[55:45] the son of the free woman so then
[55:48] brethren we are not children of the
[55:51] bonds woman but of the free amen we ask
[55:54] the Lord this evening to add the
[55:56] blessing to the reading of his word is
[55:57] you can have your seats here this
[55:59] afternoon I want to by the help of the
[56:01] Lord for just a few moments if I could I
[56:04] want to speak to you on a thought here
[56:05] tonight if I title this I want to speak
[56:07] to you on worthy of the full promise
[56:10] worthy of the full promise you know I
[56:13] believe that here tonight I look around
[56:15] and before we go any further let's just
[56:18] all agree that we're humans We're Not
[56:19] Angels we'll never be angels we never
[56:22] were born we never were created never
[56:24] intended to be Angels amen we're humans
[56:26] now I realize that we're a twofold being
[56:28] there is a human element as well as
[56:31] there is an element of deity it's laying
[56:34] on the inside of every believer then as
[56:37] the as the human element is there every
[56:39] human struggles amen with the fact or
[56:42] with the thought of am I worthy am I am
[56:45] I worthy to be a part of this am I
[56:47] worthy to see what I'm seeing am I
[56:49] worthy to hear what I'm hearing amen we
[56:51] all go through that battle of shruggling
[56:53] with am I worthy but you know when you
[56:55] start hearing the prophet he'll say it
[56:57] like this in present stage of my
[56:59] Ministry he said there's a little row
[57:01] preaching down from the throne tonight
[57:02] and it's called the lifeline he said no
[57:05] while I'm praying I hope it drags by
[57:07] every unconverted person in here he said
[57:09] and won't you reach up and take a hold
[57:11] of it sinner friend you say well brother
[57:13] Branham you're getting old and I guess
[57:15] that's the reason he said no brother
[57:16] sister when I was a little boy I believe
[57:19] this I give my life for it and there's
[57:21] only one regret that I have that I
[57:24] haven't got but one life to give if I
[57:26] had Ten Thousand Lives I'd want to give
[57:28] them all for it yes sir won't you take a
[57:31] hold of that line when it passes by
[57:33] tonight your way and you say brother
[57:35] Branham I'm not worthy to take a hold of
[57:37] it I know you're not child amen but
[57:39] you've got to do something to get worthy
[57:41] and tell me what you've done he said I
[57:43] want to do it too there ain't nothing
[57:45] you can do to get worthy you was born
[57:48] unworthy there's only one thing you can
[57:51] do just take a hold of the way that's
[57:53] been made for you and meant you're
[57:55] drowning but you don't have to drown in
[57:57] that amen God has thrown out the
[57:59] lifeline let's reach and get it tonight
[58:02] amen well I got to do something to get
[58:04] worthy do you realize you cannot pray
[58:06] enough prayers you cannot give enough
[58:08] offerings you cannot attend enough
[58:10] Services that's right you cannot
[58:11] memorize enough quotes and scriptures
[58:13] Amen to bring yourself to a place of
[58:16] worthiness to receive amen what God has
[58:18] done for you and the age you're living
[58:20] but the prophet says amen it's not my
[58:23] worthiness that I'm standing here amen
[58:25] but I'm standing here to represent
[58:27] somebody who is worthy see amen I'm not
[58:30] worthy no one else is worthy amen but
[58:33] I'm only representing him who is worthy
[58:35] amen amen then there's not a preacher
[58:37] worthy enough to save you there's not a
[58:40] there's not a prophet worthy enough to
[58:42] save you but there is a God who is rich
[58:45] in Mercy amen and he is right here in
[58:47] this building tonight in the power of
[58:50] his resurrection declaring amen that you
[58:53] aren't worthy by the blood now I love
[58:55] another quote he says what am I trying
[58:57] to do I'm trying to show you amen that
[59:00] it's God's grace that made you worthy
[59:02] amen I'm trying to show you that it's
[59:04] God's grace made you worthy you're no
[59:07] good I'm no good but he is the one
[59:09] that's good amen so let's look to him
[59:12] and he's the one that did it amen that's
[59:14] the difference it's God's grace amen
[59:17] another place he said now we know that
[59:19] we are not worthy in ourselves amen none
[59:21] of us are but that we are not trusting
[59:23] in our own worthiness his worthiness
[59:26] that we have died to our own thinking
[59:28] and we just think his thoughts and live
[59:30] to everything amen that we believe he
[59:34] commands us to amen we die to our
[59:36] thoughts we die to our ideas and we live
[59:39] according to everything amen that God in
[59:43] his word has commanded us to now I love
[59:46] what Paul says here in Galatians 4 20 at
[59:49] 4 28 he said now we Brethren amen as
[59:52] Isaac was we are the children of promise
[59:55] now when you start looking at this in
[59:57] the Bible you will find amen that there
[1:00:00] are children of promise and there are
[1:00:01] children of God some places it's called
[1:00:03] Promise some places it's called children
[1:00:05] of God and in the New Testament when you
[1:00:08] study the children you will find amen
[1:00:10] that the Bible is referring to Israel
[1:00:13] amen who were the people of God Amen and
[1:00:16] they were especially dear to God now in
[1:00:19] the New Testament in Paul's writings we
[1:00:21] find out that the children of promise or
[1:00:23] the children of God Amen are all who are
[1:00:26] led by the spirit of God Amen and they
[1:00:29] are thus closely related to God so amen
[1:00:32] it's not that you're a million miles
[1:00:33] away from God trying to find an identity
[1:00:36] amen but by the spirit of God you've
[1:00:39] been made Sons and Daughters of God Amen
[1:00:41] and listen you're no longer just a seed
[1:00:44] of an Earthly father Amen in that
[1:00:46] product of an Earthly womb amen but you
[1:00:48] are the product of the predestination of
[1:00:51] almighty God in the age that you're
[1:00:53] living listen you all no there is a
[1:00:56] natural Israel right there's a natural
[1:00:58] Israel amen but then there's also a
[1:01:01] spiritual Israel now the prophet of God
[1:01:03] said we are Israelites now I know what
[1:01:06] you're thinking you're thinking how in
[1:01:08] the world am I an Israelite amen we are
[1:01:11] Israelites amen because we are the Seed
[1:01:14] of Abraham
[1:01:16] we are because we are the Seed of
[1:01:20] Abraham now I love what the prophet says
[1:01:22] that Israelite not that which is of the
[1:01:24] flesh amen but that which is of the
[1:01:27] spirit so we are a spiritual Israel amen
[1:01:30] not by the flesh but by the spirit
[1:01:32] prophet of God said now we are Abraham's
[1:01:34] seed if we are in Christ and then if you
[1:01:37] are Abraham's seed you have the same
[1:01:39] faith that Abraham had because it was
[1:01:42] the faith that we're talking about amen
[1:01:44] especially in the church now amen it's
[1:01:47] the Royal Seed of Abraham amen so we're
[1:01:50] not focusing so much on the natural seed
[1:01:53] amen but now we're looking at a
[1:01:55] spiritual seed which is a royal seed
[1:01:58] which is a super seed listen you come on
[1:02:01] church amen if the devil had his way he
[1:02:04] would tell you amen now let's go back to
[1:02:06] the Jewish race amen there was always a
[1:02:08] battle over who's worthy amen if you do
[1:02:11] this you're worthy if you do that you're
[1:02:13] worthy amen but when Jesus Christ the
[1:02:15] son of God God came on the scene he
[1:02:18] defeated the Jewish idea of doing
[1:02:21] something to get worthy and he grafted a
[1:02:23] branch in and he made you worthy by the
[1:02:26] death of his own son at the cross of
[1:02:29] Calvary listen amen oh God there is
[1:02:32] nothing we can do to get worthy amen but
[1:02:35] there is a super God who is a super race
[1:02:38] who is a super savior he's a super
[1:02:41] Redeemer he's a super healer he's a
[1:02:44] super deliver amen and he is our savior
[1:02:47] he is our healer he is not just the god
[1:02:51] of Abraham he is not just the god of
[1:02:53] Isaac he is the god of every King seed
[1:02:56] and is a part of him from before the
[1:02:59] foundation oh I'm not talking about a
[1:03:03] natural seed I'm talking about a royal
[1:03:05] seed and that seed is Christ then there
[1:03:09] were two seeds of Abraham right there
[1:03:11] were two seeds of Abraham one of them
[1:03:13] was natural Isaac amen but then the
[1:03:16] other one was Christ amen and Christ was
[1:03:19] the promise now watch a prophet so the
[1:03:22] Royal seed how much greater that would
[1:03:24] be than the natural Seed of Abraham
[1:03:27] you say I wish I was Isaac but how much
[1:03:31] greater is the Royal seed than the
[1:03:34] natural seed so if you are in Christ you
[1:03:38] have a super seed and you are super to
[1:03:40] what Abraham was because you come by the
[1:03:44] Royal seed that was Christ if you are
[1:03:47] dead in Christ then you're Abraham's
[1:03:49] children you have Abraham's seed
[1:03:52] Abraham's faith and Abraham's Faith was
[1:03:54] in God's word regardless of what the
[1:03:57] conditions was amen that's why the devil
[1:04:00] hates this seed it's because it's the
[1:04:02] seed of Christ which is the Royal Seed
[1:04:05] of Abraham and the same anointing that
[1:04:07] was upon Abraham to call things that
[1:04:10] were not as though they were is upon
[1:04:12] this seed and the same anointing that
[1:04:15] was upon Abraham to call things that
[1:04:17] were as though they were not is upon
[1:04:20] this seed listen Church you got to shake
[1:04:22] yourself and realize you're not a hybrid
[1:04:25] you're not a hot bed plan you're not a
[1:04:28] halfway church member you are the living
[1:04:30] breathing talking manifested seed of
[1:04:34] almighty God that is coming this age to
[1:04:36] whip a devil oh God hallelujah there's
[1:04:40] an anointing upon the Royal Seed of
[1:04:42] Abraham
[1:04:44] he has made you his seed that's why the
[1:04:49] Bible says amen amen we are a part of
[1:04:52] that Original Seed and then I'll come on
[1:04:54] some of y'all have been down but you got
[1:04:56] back up
[1:04:57] you've been through some stuff but
[1:04:59] you're still here do you know why
[1:05:01] because you're not a hybrid seed oh God
[1:05:05] when a hybrid seed goes down that seed
[1:05:09] is finished amen but if original seat
[1:05:11] goes down you can put it down but if a
[1:05:15] corn of wheat pie and it go into the
[1:05:17] ground it'll raise up a hundredfold and
[1:05:20] there's a bride here tonight who's not a
[1:05:23] hybrid church with a hybrid Faith with a
[1:05:26] hybrid religion but she is a literal
[1:05:28] spoken word she bride and it's been
[1:05:30] prophesied from the scriptures and the
[1:05:33] age that she's living
[1:05:35] she don't back up she don't turn around
[1:05:38] she don't lay down she don't quit she
[1:05:41] don't give in she don't compromise she
[1:05:44] don't doubt she stays with a word
[1:05:46] because all that was in God he is poured
[1:05:50] into Christ and all that is in Christ he
[1:05:53] has poured into his seed
[1:05:57] then there's an anointing resting upon
[1:05:59] this church that's why you're a church
[1:06:02] not of creed but it promises you're not
[1:06:06] a church of religion you are a church of
[1:06:09] promises come on now somebody say well
[1:06:12] brother Andrew I don't want to talk
[1:06:14] about the seed well if you don't want to
[1:06:16] talk about the seed then you don't want
[1:06:18] to talk about the promises because the
[1:06:21] promises are only made to the seat
[1:06:25] if there's not a seed then there's not a
[1:06:29] promise but if there's a seed then
[1:06:31] there's a promise and there's a seed to
[1:06:34] receive amen the Fulfillment of the
[1:06:36] promise come on church do you realize
[1:06:38] who you are you are the seed to receive
[1:06:42] the Fulfillment of every Divine promise
[1:06:45] that has been given to Abraham supersede
[1:06:48] the Royal seed unborn church we got more
[1:06:52] than just a promise to be saved we got
[1:06:54] more than just a promise to go to church
[1:06:56] we got the promise it's some morning our
[1:06:59] bodies are going to change we got to
[1:07:02] promise it some morning we're going to
[1:07:04] see dead loved ones appear
[1:07:07] we are not a hybrid seed We Are The
[1:07:10] Original Seed and thy seed thy seed thy
[1:07:15] seed shall possess the Gate of his
[1:07:18] enemies if there's no seed then there's
[1:07:20] no possession but if there is a seed
[1:07:23] then there is some gates to be possessed
[1:07:25] and you are the possessors of every gate
[1:07:28] of the enemy somebody's going to possess
[1:07:31] every Gate of Hell somebody's going to
[1:07:33] be sin guard somebody's going to be
[1:07:36] David somebody's going to be Samson
[1:07:38] somebody's going to manifest the sea
[1:07:42] life
[1:07:44] Oh Glory to God I'm talking about seed
[1:07:47] time I'm talking about literal spoken
[1:07:50] word seed
[1:07:52] my Bible said thy seed will be as the
[1:07:56] stars of the Heaven and the sand which
[1:07:58] is upon the shore thy seed shall possess
[1:08:01] amen they gave his enemies thy seed
[1:08:05] shall all the nations of the earth be
[1:08:07] blessed when God has a seed there is a
[1:08:12] blessing upon that seed
[1:08:15] when God has a seed there is a promise
[1:08:18] resting listen can I say it this way
[1:08:21] your seed is Anointed by the promise of
[1:08:24] God
[1:08:25] the seed that's on the inside of you is
[1:08:29] Anointed by the promise of God probably
[1:08:31] God said God had been testing the
[1:08:33] patriarch because he had given him a
[1:08:36] promise how many knows that God gave
[1:08:38] Abraham a promise and now watch this and
[1:08:41] when God makes a promise he wants to be
[1:08:44] sure that the person is worthy of the
[1:08:46] promise so God does not make a promise
[1:08:49] unless the person receiving the promise
[1:08:52] is worthy of a promise before he
[1:08:55] fulfills what he said or what he
[1:08:58] promises listen church amen you know why
[1:09:00] the Baptist is not shouting about the
[1:09:02] opening the word because they're not a
[1:09:05] power to that seed that was to receive
[1:09:07] the Fulfillment of the book coming open
[1:09:09] in Revelation 5 but do you know why
[1:09:11] you're shouting about the mystery of the
[1:09:14] Rapture do you know why you're shouting
[1:09:16] about Seven Seals and seven Thunders and
[1:09:19] three pills and the Mystery of
[1:09:21] redemption is because you was the power
[1:09:23] of the seed of her Christ that was to
[1:09:27] arise in this generation come on you
[1:09:30] ought to put that devil under your foot
[1:09:31] you are worthy of the promise of God you
[1:09:34] are worthy of every Divine promise that
[1:09:37] God has made you
[1:09:39] all right
[1:09:40] God wouldn't make the promise God
[1:09:43] wouldn't make the promise unless there
[1:09:45] was somebody worthy to receive the
[1:09:48] Fulfillment of the promise that he made
[1:09:51] now you all know Abraham Abraham was 75
[1:09:54] years old and Sarah was 65 years old and
[1:09:58] the prophet said they had test after
[1:10:00] test he said but then final test the
[1:10:03] final tests come to see how you react
[1:10:06] and when he gave Abraham the test he
[1:10:09] found Abraham just as true as he was
[1:10:12] when he started when God fulfilled the
[1:10:16] promise of Abraham receiving a son that
[1:10:19] through the seed he would bless the
[1:10:21] Nations come on 75 years later and
[1:10:25] Abraham was just as faithful as he was
[1:10:28] the day that he left the land of the
[1:10:30] Chaldeans to follow Jehovah oh god well
[1:10:34] I feel like preaching here amen and my
[1:10:37] Bible says amen now to Abraham and his
[1:10:40] seed were the promises made he saith not
[1:10:43] and to seeds as of many but as of one
[1:10:46] and divine seed which is Christ now
[1:10:50] watch a prophet so it wouldn't be
[1:10:52] Abraham's Siege it was Abraham's seed
[1:10:55] one and that was Abraham's Faith seed
[1:10:58] that was pointing to the Royal seed to
[1:11:00] come through Abraham's faith not through
[1:11:03] Abraham's natural life but Abraham
[1:11:06] spiritual life amen why but would call
[1:11:09] anything contrary to God's word that's
[1:11:12] the real seed amen that we are speaking
[1:11:15] of the real seed we are speaking of is
[1:11:18] the seed that we'll call anything
[1:11:20] contrary to God's word wrong they will
[1:11:24] call anything contrary to God's
[1:11:27] infallible word error to stay with the
[1:11:31] word do you see what the prophet said he
[1:11:33] said there must come a loyal bride there
[1:11:37] must come a bride who will stay with the
[1:11:40] word
[1:11:41] now now when you start talking about
[1:11:43] this seed amen this Royal seed ride
[1:11:46] you've got to realize that there's only
[1:11:48] one alpha
[1:11:50] and there's only one Omega there's only
[1:11:53] one first and one last
[1:11:56] there's only one beginning and one
[1:11:58] ending there is only one he which was
[1:12:00] which he is and which shall be come on
[1:12:02] you know who I'm talking about it's none
[1:12:04] other than the Lord Jesus Christ but do
[1:12:07] you realize under the voice of the
[1:12:09] seventh angel he said there would be an
[1:12:11] alpha bride and an Omega bride he would
[1:12:14] say that the alpha has become the Omega
[1:12:17] then it's not to many churches or many
[1:12:21] seeds but there has been churches
[1:12:23] churches and there's been Brides brides
[1:12:25] but there has got to come one that's not
[1:12:28] only got the mechanics but she's got the
[1:12:31] Dynamics to make the church move and to
[1:12:34] live in the power of his resurrection as
[1:12:37] he be in the groom the bride has come
[1:12:40] forth as he be in the groom the bride
[1:12:44] has come forth because it's a part of
[1:12:46] him the Bride is a part of him and it
[1:12:49] can only be the manifestation of the
[1:12:52] fulfilling of all the revelations any
[1:12:55] others has spoken book of the Bride it
[1:12:58] can only manifest so the bride can only
[1:13:01] manifest the life of the seed that's
[1:13:04] only inside of her if it does something
[1:13:07] different from the groom then it isn't
[1:13:09] the bride because she is flesh of his
[1:13:11] flesh she is born of his bone she is
[1:13:15] life of his life she is power of his
[1:13:17] power she is him see a man and a woman
[1:13:21] are one and woman taken from the side
[1:13:24] she has taken a spirit the feminist
[1:13:26] Spirit from him the flesh from his side
[1:13:29] made both mechanics and Dynamics the
[1:13:32] wife see the spirit of him and the Flesh
[1:13:36] of him have been put together and made
[1:13:38] mechanics and Dynamics somebody say well
[1:13:41] preacher we just want to be a mechanics
[1:13:43] church then you better start looking for
[1:13:45] tribulation because that's where you're
[1:13:47] headed
[1:13:48] well preacher we just want to be a
[1:13:51] Dynamics Church well you better start
[1:13:53] making preparation for the tribulation
[1:13:55] because that's where you're headed
[1:13:57] because if this bride does anything then
[1:14:00] what if it groomed us she is not the
[1:14:02] bride and this bride will not be just a
[1:14:05] mechanical bride and neither will she
[1:14:07] just be a dynamical bride but she will
[1:14:09] be made both the mechanics and the
[1:14:12] Dynamics in other words if he fired on
[1:14:15] 16 cylinders she's going to fire on 16
[1:14:19] cylinders if he walked on the Promises
[1:14:21] she's going to walk in the promises if
[1:14:24] he walks in perfect Faith then she's
[1:14:26] going to walk in perfect faith if he
[1:14:29] walks in perfect love then she's going
[1:14:31] to walk in perfect love come on Church
[1:14:33] don't you let some devil reduce the
[1:14:36] power of the anointing in the Church of
[1:14:39] the Living God to some emotion or some
[1:14:42] sensation or some little funny feeling
[1:14:44] that went up your spine I'm talking
[1:14:46] about the same anointing that rest
[1:14:49] Jehovah of the old in Jesus of the new
[1:14:52] is resting upon this bride in the form
[1:14:55] of the word
[1:15:00] come on church I'm talking about the
[1:15:02] anointed Church of the Living God
[1:15:05] the anointed body will be both mechanics
[1:15:09] and Dynamics
[1:15:11] you know what she can do she can take
[1:15:13] everything the prophet said
[1:15:15] preach brother think I believe I will
[1:15:18] she can take everything the prophet said
[1:15:21] if he said she was the bride she can
[1:15:24] take it if he said she was justified she
[1:15:27] can take it if he said she never done it
[1:15:30] in the first place she can take it if he
[1:15:33] said I seen her getting out of line but
[1:15:36] I begin to scream brother Greg get back
[1:15:38] in Step then you are a part of that
[1:15:42] Omega bride that can receive prophetic
[1:15:44] correction and get back in step
[1:15:48] hallelujah we're not a bunch of church
[1:15:50] members we are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:15:53] manifesting
[1:15:55] manifesting
[1:15:57] everything
[1:16:00] he said we would be we are
[1:16:03] [Applause]
[1:16:06] that's the beauty of just saying what a
[1:16:08] prophet said
[1:16:09] that's the beauty of just preaching the
[1:16:12] message
[1:16:13] now that's the beauty of not taking part
[1:16:15] of it and leaving other parts that's the
[1:16:18] beauty of taking every part
[1:16:21] now can I preach brother Stephen can I
[1:16:23] take some Liberty some people want to
[1:16:25] just use certain ways brother random
[1:16:27] approach something and put some right in
[1:16:29] a bondage not to be fully who she was
[1:16:31] ordained to be
[1:16:33] [Applause]
[1:16:34] and I can I can prove it to you from the
[1:16:36] message because we got oh God I won't
[1:16:39] get in trouble we got people that want
[1:16:41] quiet Services they want quiet meetings
[1:16:44] they want quiet preaching so they'll get
[1:16:46] up and say if you're really anointed
[1:16:48] then you'll be like Jesus was in Luke
[1:16:51] the fourth chapter when the prophet said
[1:16:53] he picked up the scroll read what was
[1:16:55] wrote about him closed it sat down and
[1:16:58] he said precious words proceeded out of
[1:17:00] his mouth and the prophet said what is
[1:17:01] the anointing it's supreme power in
[1:17:04] control somebody somebody told me the
[1:17:06] other day they said if you really preach
[1:17:08] that then you'll act like that I said
[1:17:09] problem is brother I've preached that
[1:17:11] exact quote and been shouting down the
[1:17:13] middle of the church when I was
[1:17:15] preaching it
[1:17:17] so was I not anointed because I was not
[1:17:19] sitting was I not anointed no the
[1:17:22] prophet said anointing is supreme power
[1:17:25] in control
[1:17:27] well let's not just take one quote let's
[1:17:29] take another one where he says what is
[1:17:31] the anointing he said the anointing is
[1:17:33] the joy of the Lord some of you all come
[1:17:36] in this service tonight some of you all
[1:17:38] come in this service and you was
[1:17:40] burdened down you had a heaviness upon
[1:17:43] you you couldn't raise your hands you
[1:17:45] couldn't sing brother Stephen said you
[1:17:47] got to get free to receive the word and
[1:17:50] so they begin to sing and as the songs
[1:17:52] of Zion begin to Be Sung there was an
[1:17:55] anointing dropped in the building and
[1:17:57] the spirit of heaviness was ripped off
[1:17:59] of your life and you was able to receive
[1:18:02] a joy that maybe you hadn't felt since
[1:18:04] Sunday I'm talking about the anointed
[1:18:07] bride of Jesus Christ that knows how to
[1:18:10] be in control as well to have joy
[1:18:12] unspeakable and full of Glory I want to
[1:18:15] put that devil on notice you ain't gonna
[1:18:18] take my shouts you ain't gonna take my
[1:18:20] dance you ain't gonna take my victory I
[1:18:23] have been liberated and because of the
[1:18:26] anointing the Yoke shall be destroyed
[1:18:32] because of the anointing the Yoke shall
[1:18:35] be destroyed
[1:18:36] [Applause]
[1:18:38] I say let the anointing fall let the
[1:18:42] anointing come in the church and
[1:18:44] Liberate the children of God
[1:18:48] [Applause]
[1:18:51] what is this anointing doing it's
[1:18:54] liberating you
[1:18:56] it's bringing you to the full promise
[1:18:58] now you say preacher you're getting out
[1:19:00] there am I really
[1:19:01] properly God said we can do two things
[1:19:04] he said we can bow our heads and open
[1:19:07] our hearts
[1:19:08] we can bow our heads and open our hearts
[1:19:12] to receive a living God
[1:19:16] he said to bring a living Christ to a
[1:19:19] dying generation do you realize the
[1:19:22] prophet said that you are taking Jesus
[1:19:25] place on the Earth
[1:19:28] now can we take all of what he said
[1:19:31] you are taking Jesus place on the Earth
[1:19:35] then what did Jesus do he brought a
[1:19:39] dying generation full of traditions a
[1:19:43] breath of fresh air and a drink of
[1:19:46] Artesian well water
[1:19:47] he brought him away out of bondage into
[1:19:51] the Glorious Liberty of the father whom
[1:19:54] he was sent to manifest
[1:19:56] what are you saying then I'm saying that
[1:19:58] this is the bride's time to take Jesus
[1:20:01] place on the Earth
[1:20:03] you know what your Bible says in
[1:20:05] Revelation 1 3 the Bible says this
[1:20:07] blessed he that readeth and they that
[1:20:09] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[1:20:12] the things which are written therein for
[1:20:15] the time is at hand now can I read you
[1:20:18] something from the church age book he
[1:20:21] said the time was not at hand previously
[1:20:23] in the wisdom and economy of God this
[1:20:26] Mighty Revelation somebody said Mighty
[1:20:28] revelation
[1:20:29] this Mighty Revelation though fully
[1:20:32] known to God
[1:20:34] this Mighty Revelation though fully
[1:20:37] known to God can I say it to you like
[1:20:39] this there never was a time that God did
[1:20:43] not know the revelation of his word
[1:20:45] laughs
[1:20:48] it was always fully known to God but was
[1:20:52] only released to the humanity in the
[1:20:55] season that they needed it to be
[1:20:57] released in brother Ben said thus we
[1:20:59] immediately learn a principle that the
[1:21:02] revelation of God for each age can only
[1:21:04] come in that age and at a specific time
[1:21:07] look at Israel the revelation of
[1:21:10] Deliverance could only come at a
[1:21:12] specific time brother Brahm says an even
[1:21:14] more specifically as Israel began to cry
[1:21:17] for it he said look at Jesus himself he
[1:21:21] came at the fullness of time now watch
[1:21:23] he bring him the complete revelation of
[1:21:26] the godhead and in this layout of sin
[1:21:28] the revelation of God will come in its
[1:21:32] due time it will not falter and neither
[1:21:35] will it be premature the revelation will
[1:21:39] not be released too early and it will
[1:21:41] not be released too late
[1:21:43] when the Revelation is released it will
[1:21:47] be released at a specific time to a
[1:21:50] specific people in a specific season to
[1:21:53] receive a specific Revelation listen
[1:21:56] friends this is not a shotgun message
[1:21:59] where we shoot and it just lands
[1:22:01] wherever but this is a laser-guided
[1:22:03] message
[1:22:04] [Music]
[1:22:06] that was delivered to a specific seed to
[1:22:10] receive the Revelation I love that word
[1:22:12] time in Revelation 1 3 it means
[1:22:15] opportunity so the opportunity is at
[1:22:19] hand you know what the prophet said he
[1:22:21] said we have opportunities that Saint
[1:22:24] Paul never dreamed of heaven we have
[1:22:26] opportunities that Enoch and Elijah and
[1:22:30] all of them never had we have
[1:22:32] opportunities now
[1:22:35] well someday somehow I'm going to do
[1:22:38] something for God I say why not now why
[1:22:41] not this hour why not this service why
[1:22:44] not this church

[1:23:36] right in front of you well that's the
[1:23:39] same way it is with this bride's Revival
[1:23:41] that's the same way it is with the third
[1:23:43] pull we got a bunch of return Ministry
[1:23:45] Devils that have crept in the church and
[1:23:47] they've got people looking for something
[1:23:49] way off in the future and failing to see
[1:23:52] that it's happening right here brother
[1:23:54] Maurice it's not coming it's here right
[1:23:57] now it's here upon us we are in the
[1:24:00] middle of the bride's Revival
[1:24:03] you want to speak the word it's time to
[1:24:06] speak you want to believe for the
[1:24:08] impossible it's time to believe you want
[1:24:11] to walk in the anointing and the grace
[1:24:13] of God well now's the time to do it
[1:24:15] there's not another age coming
[1:24:20] open up your eyes
[1:24:22] seize your opportunity
[1:24:25] [Applause]
[1:24:27] well preacher I want to shout what are
[1:24:30] you waiting on you might as well shout
[1:24:32] right now
[1:24:33] well brother Andrew I want to know what
[1:24:35] David felt like when he danced you got
[1:24:38] the same opportunity to dance like David
[1:24:42] [Applause]
[1:24:43] you say how can you say that because
[1:24:45] David's dance was because the word of
[1:24:47] the Lord
[1:24:49] was returning to its rightful position
[1:24:53] and if anybody got a right to dance if
[1:24:57] anybody got a right to praise God it's
[1:25:00] the Bride of Jesus Christ she has seen
[1:25:03] the word of the Lord fully restored
[1:25:09] hallelujah hallelujah in both mechanics
[1:25:13] and Dynamics
[1:25:16] [Applause]
[1:25:18] what are you saying preacher I'm saying
[1:25:21] the hour of fullness is here
[1:25:24] well someday brother Stephen Sunday
[1:25:27] someday know this day
[1:25:31] this hour
[1:25:33] [Applause]
[1:25:36] well I might as well preach I'm here
[1:25:38] brother Brown said like this he said the
[1:25:40] hour of fullness now when you move into
[1:25:42] this hour of fullness look what Paul
[1:25:43] says in Romans 15 29 he says I'm sure
[1:25:47] that when I come unto you I shall come
[1:25:49] in the fullness of the blessing Paul
[1:25:52] said when I come to you I will come in
[1:25:55] the fullness of the blessing of the
[1:25:57] gospel of Christ do you realize William
[1:26:00] Brandon preached the same thing that
[1:26:01] Paul preached
[1:26:03] then I can say when God said the seventh
[1:26:06] angel he was not coming in a partial
[1:26:09] blessing
[1:26:11] he was coming in the fullness of the
[1:26:14] blessing in Ephesians 1 10 Paul says
[1:26:17] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:26:19] of times he might gather together in one
[1:26:22] all things in Christ both which are in
[1:26:24] heaven which are on the earth even in
[1:26:26] him Ephesians 3 19. ye know the love of
[1:26:30] Christ which passeth knowledge that you
[1:26:32] might be filled with all the fullness of
[1:26:35] God the fullness of the blessing the
[1:26:38] dispensation of the fullness of all
[1:26:40] things then Paul says that you might be
[1:26:43] filled with all the fullness of God I
[1:26:45] didn't have time to pull it but I can
[1:26:47] preach it to you from memory Paul says
[1:26:49] be not drunk on wine in excess but be ye
[1:26:53] filled with a spirit be ye filled with
[1:26:56] the spirit somebody say field
[1:26:58] you know what that word fullness means
[1:27:01] in the New Testament it is the body of
[1:27:03] believers
[1:27:06] in the New Testament the word fullness
[1:27:08] is the body of Believers as that which
[1:27:11] is filled with the presence the power
[1:27:14] the agency and the riches of God and of
[1:27:17] Christ
[1:27:18] this body of Believers is full of the
[1:27:21] power of the rate of the agency come on
[1:27:25] of the blessings and of the presence of
[1:27:27] Christ now the prophet of God said you
[1:27:29] are filled with something right here
[1:27:31] tonight spoken word you're filled with
[1:27:33] something he said you're either filled
[1:27:35] because you cannot sit here without
[1:27:38] being full of something he said now you
[1:27:40] might be full of the world loving the
[1:27:42] world or the things of the world God be
[1:27:44] merciful to you you might be full of
[1:27:46] Creeds from some church or some little
[1:27:48] prayer that you said God be merciful to
[1:27:50] you you might be full of religion and
[1:27:53] yet that's the worst yet that's right in
[1:27:55] the last days it'd be very religious
[1:27:57] having a form of godliness but would
[1:28:00] deny the power thereof now watch a
[1:28:02] prophet if you are full of religion
[1:28:05] you're miserable
[1:28:07] if you are full of religion you're
[1:28:09] miserable you're just religious if
[1:28:12] you're full of Creeds you don't know
[1:28:14] what you're talking about if you're full
[1:28:16] of the world you're blind if you're full
[1:28:19] of religion you're miserable if you're
[1:28:21] full of the Creeds you don't know what
[1:28:22] you're talking about and if you're full
[1:28:24] of the world you're blind but then again
[1:28:27] you may be full of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:30] oh I hope you're full he said and if
[1:28:33] you're full the Holy Ghost what have you
[1:28:34] got you got power you got love you got
[1:28:37] peace then church we are not like
[1:28:39] denominations who have received and
[1:28:42] settled down and satisfied with just a
[1:28:45] portion of what God has for the church
[1:28:47] and the age we're living we are not
[1:28:49] happy with halfway intellectual
[1:28:52] conversions we are not satisfied with
[1:28:55] halfway sermons and halfway Services we
[1:28:58] are under the potentials of this Royal
[1:29:01] seed of Christ and our soul must receive
[1:29:05] a satisfying portion and the satisfying
[1:29:08] portion to the believer is all that was
[1:29:11] in God was poured into Christ and all
[1:29:14] that was in Christ has been poured into
[1:29:17] the church
[1:29:19] yes sir then Paul could say in him
[1:29:23] dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead
[1:29:25] bodily now watch a prophet he says and
[1:29:28] ye are complete in him
[1:29:30] then watch a prophet say thus this bride
[1:29:33] is the literal spoken word seed right
[1:29:36] spoken word Tabernacle y'all want to put
[1:29:39] your joy shoes on this bride is the
[1:29:42] literal spoken word seat right
[1:29:46] whereas once God was manifested in one
[1:29:49] member even our Lord Jesus Christ he is
[1:29:53] now manifested in a many membered body
[1:29:58] what are you saying preacher I'm saying
[1:30:00] that the spirit of God is here to raise
[1:30:03] up the bride to go over into the full
[1:30:05] promise we have got to quit sitting in
[1:30:08] the come can I preach I think it's time
[1:30:10] to quit sinning in the shallow Waters of
[1:30:13] this message
[1:30:16] come on Church well we're just going to
[1:30:19] sit over here you know what Ezekiel said
[1:30:21] he said there's ankle deep water then
[1:30:23] there's Knee Deep Water then there's
[1:30:25] then there's hip high water amen but
[1:30:27] then there was some swimming water come
[1:30:30] on there's three right there amen but
[1:30:32] notice there's a fourth one the third
[1:30:34] one was hip water but the fourth one was
[1:30:37] swim and water and we are not a part of
[1:30:40] just a partial restoration but
[1:30:42] justification made way for
[1:30:44] sanctification made way for the baptism
[1:30:47] of the Holy Ghost which has made way for
[1:30:50] the person of the word which is the
[1:30:52] swimming Waters come on Church take your
[1:30:55] floaties off come on Church get off of
[1:30:58] the bank it's time to go swimming in the
[1:31:01] revelation of the entire mystery of the
[1:31:03] book we have been called worthy to go
[1:31:07] into all the promises of God
[1:31:09] [Applause]
[1:31:10] [Music]
[1:31:13] oh it's a full promise it's a full
[1:31:17] promise it's a full land it's a full
[1:31:20] commission now I know what you're
[1:31:22] thinking about you're still thinking
[1:31:24] about your Humanity
[1:31:27] I'm not worthy
[1:31:29] I can't do it I'm not gonna what can I
[1:31:33] put you in Joshua's shoes for a minute
[1:31:36] can I put you in Joshua's shoes who's
[1:31:38] standing at the river and Moses is dead
[1:31:43] and the word of the Lord comes unto
[1:31:45] Joshua and says you got to take this
[1:31:49] brother Maurice you gotta take this
[1:31:51] people over into the promised land and
[1:31:55] Joshua looks at his commission and
[1:31:57] realizes who's been before him and
[1:32:00] Joshua has the same struggle that you
[1:32:02] have how can me Joshua have this ability
[1:32:06] with all my failures and all my mistakes
[1:32:09] and all my shortcomings to lead this
[1:32:13] people a promise into the land that God
[1:32:15] has given them as an inheritance within
[1:32:18] all of a sudden all of a sudden the
[1:32:21] spirit of God fell upon Joshua and these
[1:32:24] words proceeded as I was with Moses
[1:32:29] foreign
[1:32:36] Joshua called a revelation with all of
[1:32:40] Moses's mistakes with all of Moses's
[1:32:42] failures the presence of God never left
[1:32:45] him when he was bound God was with him
[1:32:48] when he was hooked God was with him when
[1:32:50] he was in battle God was with him when
[1:32:52] he was found God was with him and that
[1:32:55] Revelation struck Joshua and he said God
[1:32:57] if you never left Moses with all of his
[1:33:00] mistakes then I'm going to put my
[1:33:02] marching shoes on cause if you didn't
[1:33:05] leave Moses then you ain't going to
[1:33:07] leave me well I feel like preaching here

[1:33:19] spoken word Tabernacle he's still with
[1:33:21] you because he has called you
[1:33:26] as I was with Moses as I was with Moses

[1:33:33] with the prophet so am I with the
[1:33:36] prophecy
[1:33:39] get up get up put your walking shoes on

[1:33:54] oh crap

[1:34:31] walked out he stood with me
[1:34:34] [Applause]
[1:34:38] yeah
[1:34:40] yeah you gotta come out of your Humanity
[1:34:42] to come into your identity of deity
[1:34:46] I said you got to come out of your
[1:34:48] Humanity to come into your identity of
[1:34:52] deity
[1:34:54] gonna let me preach to you the deity
[1:34:57] part is greater than the humanity
[1:35:01] thank you
[1:35:03] as I was with brother Branham
[1:35:05] [Applause]
[1:35:08] so will I be with his bride
[1:35:11] she will not stop short she will not go
[1:35:14] halfway
[1:35:18] now now now now you all know what I'm
[1:35:20] talking about don't you God wants
[1:35:23] separators
[1:35:25] God's not looking for mixers he's
[1:35:28] looking for separators
[1:35:30] God's word calls for total separation
[1:35:34] from unbelief if it calls for total
[1:35:38] separation then that must mean there's a
[1:35:41] full identification
[1:35:43] coming to the seed that has fully
[1:35:46] separated now the Bible says it very
[1:35:49] beautiful that that God called in
[1:35:51] Deuteronomy 7 verse 6 now are the holy
[1:35:53] people you know that you're a holy
[1:35:55] people
[1:35:56] can I go on
[1:35:58] the Lord thy God had chosen thee to be a
[1:36:02] special people unto himself above all
[1:36:05] the people that are upon the face of the
[1:36:08] Earth
[1:36:09] the Lord did not set his love upon you
[1:36:11] nor choose you because you were more in
[1:36:14] number than any people for ye were the
[1:36:17] fewest of all the people brother man
[1:36:20] said what was this scripture showing it
[1:36:22] was showing it was going to take the
[1:36:24] grace of Jehovah over the children to
[1:36:27] put him in the promised land can I say
[1:36:30] this you're not going to take this land
[1:36:32] by law
[1:36:35] you're not going to take this land by
[1:36:37] works you're not going to take this land
[1:36:40] by legalism you will take this land by
[1:36:44] grace
[1:36:46] that's why in 1961 the prophet preaches
[1:36:51] an entire sermon and calls it the
[1:36:54] message of Grace
[1:36:55] now do you know what he's showing you
[1:36:57] and brother brother Greg it's always
[1:36:59] amazed me brother I'm saying I'm going
[1:37:00] to preach on Grace he said the one thing
[1:37:03] I've been gotten after for is preaching
[1:37:05] Grace now in my little finite mind I
[1:37:08] wonder who in the world is going to get
[1:37:10] after a prophet brother Kelly for
[1:37:12] preaching Grace don't everybody love
[1:37:14] Grace don't everybody want to hear Grace
[1:37:17] but they did not want to hear true Grace
[1:37:20] because true Grace would not take Grace
[1:37:23] and make it a disgrace and turn the
[1:37:26] grace of God into this Jesus that's why
[1:37:28] Paul said amen do we leave the law and
[1:37:31] come into Grace so that sin May abound
[1:37:34] he said God forbid that's why Paul
[1:37:37] preached Romans 7 and said when I would
[1:37:39] do good evil is always present that's
[1:37:42] why Paul said I must mortify the Deeds
[1:37:45] of My Flesh that's why Paul said I Must
[1:37:48] Die daily come on Church your Victory is
[1:37:53] crucifying your Humanity to look in the
[1:37:56] complete identification of deity
[1:38:01] can I say that again your Victory is
[1:38:04] crucifying your Humanity to walk in
[1:38:08] complete identity of deity
[1:38:12] God have mercy Hallelujah then we're not
[1:38:16] if if oh God you know what y'all to do
[1:38:18] in the morning you ought to Walk and
[1:38:19] Walk and Walk and work different than
[1:38:21] the Baptists do
[1:38:23] you ought to walk in on your job in the
[1:38:25] morning different than the Pentecostals
[1:38:27] do they walk in well it's just another
[1:38:30] day I think I'll barely get through I
[1:38:32] wish I could just stay home but if
[1:38:34] you've got a revelation of who you are
[1:38:36] you would go walk in there and say deity
[1:38:39] is on this job deity is in this school
[1:38:42] deity is in this truck deity is in this
[1:38:46] flesh because there is a royal seed
[1:38:52] well somebody shot deity
[1:38:55] deity in humanity
[1:38:58] now now it's going to take the grace of
[1:39:00] God now can I have a few more minutes
[1:39:02] it's going to take the grace of God to
[1:39:06] get us out of the old land into the new
[1:39:08] now Revelation 5 I love this Revelation
[1:39:11] 5 can you give me Revelation 5 verse 1.
[1:39:13] you all know it by heart but I love this
[1:39:15] here uh I know it's okay to preach it
[1:39:18] because this is a message Church
[1:39:21] I've been gotten after preaching this
[1:39:22] and churches claimed to be the message
[1:39:24] but I feel pretty good to preaching here
[1:39:25] not because y'all believe the message
[1:39:30] the Bible said in Revelation 5 1 I saw
[1:39:33] in the right hand of him that sat on the
[1:39:36] throne a book sealed or a book written
[1:39:39] within and on the back side was sealed
[1:39:42] with Seven Seals now watch verse two and
[1:39:45] I saw a strong Angel proclaiming who
[1:39:48] with a loud voice who is worthy who is
[1:39:53] worthy who is Worthy
[1:39:57] who is
[1:39:59] who is worthy to open the book and to
[1:40:03] loose the seals thereof listen to the
[1:40:06] problem of God he said Lord you let us
[1:40:09] by the Holy Spirit reach out in that
[1:40:11] word and get those real things reach out
[1:40:15] in that word and get those real things
[1:40:17] and tie them into Calvary can I preach
[1:40:19] her for a second anybody tries to tell
[1:40:22] you
[1:40:23] that this message does away with Calvary
[1:40:25] they're a liar
[1:40:28] anybody tries to stand In a Pulpit and
[1:40:31] say this message does away with a cross
[1:40:34] of Calvary they are a false prophet
[1:40:36] they're Anointed with a spirit of hell
[1:40:38] [Applause]
[1:40:40] because when the prophet preaches the
[1:40:43] revelation of the book he says let us
[1:40:46] reach into the word and get those real
[1:40:49] things and tie them to Calvary
[1:40:52] he tied every seal back to Calvary he
[1:40:57] tied every Thunder back to Calvary he
[1:41:00] tied predestination back to Calvary he
[1:41:03] tied the Oneness of a godhead back to
[1:41:06] Calvary
[1:41:08] do you know why he
[1:41:11] done that because the prophet said that
[1:41:14] they might see that we have the fullness
[1:41:18] the prophet had to tie these things back
[1:41:21] to Calvary so the church would see that
[1:41:24] we have the fullness and the riches and
[1:41:26] the blessings and the glory and all goes
[1:41:29] to him who is worthy that come to the
[1:41:32] book out of the right hand of him that's
[1:41:34] set up on the throne and sat it down on
[1:41:36] himself for he was slain since the
[1:41:39] foundation of the world can I go on
[1:41:41] right brother says right in this seven
[1:41:43] sealed book that we're entering now
[1:41:45] holds the whole mystery of all the
[1:41:49] Redemption blessings of God
[1:41:52] if this book does not come open we are a
[1:41:56] partial Church walking in partial
[1:41:58] understanding but if the revelation of
[1:42:01] redemption is released from the word of
[1:42:04] God then that will put you back on the
[1:42:07] same side as the lamb himself is on and
[1:42:11] we are walking in glory we are walking
[1:42:13] in power we are walking in honor
[1:42:18] well we're either going to be a message
[1:42:20] church or not
[1:42:22] we're either going to be the bride or
[1:42:24] not we're either going to believe these
[1:42:27] things or not
[1:42:29] and I'll just tell you what I think I
[1:42:31] think if you're going to try to enjoy
[1:42:33] the benefits of this message without
[1:42:34] preaching the benefits of this message
[1:42:36] you ought to take the sign off your door
[1:42:38] and go join the denomination somewhere
[1:42:40] and quit being a trespasser
[1:42:45] you're looking at one preacher that's
[1:42:47] not ashamed to identify myself with the
[1:42:51] revelation of the seventh seal being
[1:42:53] open in the age I'm living in
[1:42:56] you can shoot me you can stab me you can
[1:42:58] beat me you can bang me but you will
[1:43:00] never stop me from walking in the
[1:43:03] fullness of the identity of deity by the
[1:43:06] opening of the word
[1:43:10] now now I know what you're saying you're
[1:43:12] searching my brother please you're
[1:43:14] saying how in the world are you getting
[1:43:15] out there I'll tell you how I'm getting
[1:43:17] out there the prophet said he said now
[1:43:19] remember he's the lamb he's the only one
[1:43:22] that redeemed it
[1:43:23] remember first seal John 12. brother
[1:43:25] said let's read it he said now we won't
[1:43:28] have to wonder anymore
[1:43:30] he said what the Thunder is in John 12.
[1:43:33] he said now watch the hour has come that
[1:43:35] oh I'm running out of time
[1:43:37] he says the Hours come that the son of
[1:43:40] man must be glorified he said see you're
[1:43:44] at the end of an age his ministry is
[1:43:47] ending see now listen when you come to
[1:43:50] the end of something you got to go
[1:43:51] somewhere
[1:43:55] when time is up when time runs out you
[1:43:59] got to go somewhere and a prophet was
[1:44:02] here oh God the prophet was here as the
[1:44:06] signifying Angel and he stood between
[1:44:09] the Gap and said church denominations
[1:44:11] over time is run out you got to go
[1:44:15] somewhere the hour has come that the son
[1:44:18] of man must be glorified
[1:44:22] now now can I just say what he said can
[1:44:25] I say what he said he automatically ties
[1:44:28] the son of man being glorified and says
[1:44:30] what about the hour that when his bride
[1:44:33] must be taken away what about the Hours
[1:44:36] come that time shall be no more now
[1:44:38] watch he reads this and he said now this
[1:44:40] Revelation it cannot be revealed until
[1:44:44] what he said here at the end time but it
[1:44:47] come in a symbol
[1:44:49] it come in a symbol so whatever was in
[1:44:52] the mind of God remember the quote was
[1:44:55] fully known to God all the time but in
[1:44:59] the Christ the mystery he said he's
[1:45:01] gradually let it out he's slowly unfaded
[1:45:04] or slowly uh released it are you with me
[1:45:07] what is he showing you he's showing you
[1:45:09] that it come forth in the symbol now
[1:45:11] watch the brothers should remember a
[1:45:13] loud clapping noise of Thunder is the
[1:45:15] voice of God the Bible said it's a clap
[1:45:17] of Thunder now watch though though it
[1:45:19] was a thunder but it was God they
[1:45:22] thought it was a thunder but it was God
[1:45:24] he understood it for it was revealed to
[1:45:27] him who is him he's the Lamb of
[1:45:31] Revelation 5.
[1:45:34] in his mind the Revelation was fully
[1:45:37] known but what did he do he said the
[1:45:39] first seal when it was hoping it was
[1:45:41] open in symbol form and it thundered now
[1:45:43] if it thundered in symbol form he said
[1:45:46] what will it do in reality for him
[1:45:49] if there was a thunder in symbol form he
[1:45:53] said then what will it do in reality for
[1:45:55] him now watch he said now not all itself
[1:45:58] but first can we preach this first is
[1:46:01] with God
[1:46:03] first it's with God he said then it's in
[1:46:06] symbol then it's revealed
[1:46:09] first with God when John wrote it it was
[1:46:12] in symbol come on but when John received
[1:46:16] the symbol brother great God already
[1:46:18] knew the Revelation okay when Daniel and
[1:46:22] John saw the same thing God already knew
[1:46:25] what the first symbol of the first seal
[1:46:28] of a seven sealed book was can I go and
[1:46:30] say it but the revelation of that symbol
[1:46:33] that comes from God had never been
[1:46:36] unclosed until
[1:46:38] 1963 and a prophet walked to the pulpit
[1:46:41] and opened his Bible and said God hides
[1:46:45] himself in Simplicity and reveals
[1:46:48] himself in the same and he said now
[1:46:50] there's a breach between the seven
[1:46:52] Church ages and the Seven Seals and then
[1:46:55] he says and here's that first seal
[1:46:59] here's that first seal oh God I wish I
[1:47:02] was a preacher right now here's that
[1:47:04] first seal he said I've been preaching
[1:47:07] it's Christ he said but it's not Christ
[1:47:10] it's the Antichrist
[1:47:12] so as long as it's in symbol form
[1:47:15] there's room for error but oh God but
[1:47:19] when it moves from symbol when it moves
[1:47:22] from symbol into Revelation then
[1:47:25] somebody catches the revelation
[1:47:27] [Applause]
[1:47:30] oh somebody's shot aloud when it moves
[1:47:34] from God to symbol to Revelation there's
[1:47:38] a specific people
[1:47:40] there is a seed in position to receive
[1:47:45] the revelation of the symbol as it's
[1:47:47] come from God and a prophet said here's

[2:00:18] sent a prophet and a prophet went
[2:00:20] hunting and a storm stopped but a man
[2:00:23] who was underneath the inspiration of
[2:00:25] the Revelation had to step out and say
[2:00:28] there's more to this than just sitting
[2:00:30] around the campfire there's more to this
[2:00:33] than just a belt buckle there's more to

[2:05:02] their garments they were working we are
[2:05:05] granted
[2:05:07] oh God I know I'm doing a horrible job
[2:05:09] at this but let me connect this that
[2:05:11] word granted you know what that word
[2:05:12] granted means that word granted means to
[2:05:15] give to someone whom it already belonged
[2:05:18] to

[2:05:22] brother Maurice when something is
[2:05:24] granted it's given to you it was already
[2:05:28] yours
[2:05:30] well then why does it have to be granted
[2:05:32] because we come from God but we bypass
[2:05:35] our theophany
[2:05:37] contacted a human spirit
[2:05:41] preacher to be tested and tried but when
[2:05:44] the testing and trials are over
[2:05:47] can I break this down as plain as I know
[2:05:49] how if you're on Interstate 85 running
[2:05:52] Interstate 85 North to 85 South and you
[2:05:56] run into an area they got a bypass
[2:05:59] brother RAM used that word didn't he
[2:06:01] bypass they got a bypass called 485. so
[2:06:05] you're on 85 you get on the bypass 485
[2:06:09] and you bypass something go back around
[2:06:12] but you get back on 85.
[2:06:16] testing one two it's still working you
[2:06:18] was on one with God you was on 85 but
[2:06:23] then you had to bypass it but you got
[2:06:26] back on it
[2:06:28] he was always in the mind of God but a
[2:06:31] fall in the garden put you on a bypass
[2:06:34] but in the end time God would send the
[2:06:37] seventh angel to preach the Seven Seals
[2:06:40] that would put you back on Oneness with
[2:06:42] God and say Church you're going to walk
[2:06:45] like Enoch and you're going to walk back
[2:06:47] in the Garden of Eden
