the mulberry bush amen I can tell you the move is on my brother the move is on I'm so glad that God is always govering in the Aires of man amen and you're thankful for the grace of God starting in verse 11 of numbers 35 he said then you shall appoint you cities to be Cities of Refuge for you that the Slayer May flee thither which kth any person at unawares and they shall be unto you cities for Refuge from the Avenger that the manslayer die not until he stand before the congregation in judgment yes sir and of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall you have for Refuge you shall give three cities on this side of Jordan three cities you shall Give In the Land of Canaan which shall be Cities of Refuge these six cities shall be a refuge for both the children of Israel and for a Str for the stranger and for the sword Jer among them and everyone that and them that everyone that kth any person unawares may flee and if he Smite him with an instrument of iron so that he die he is a murderer and the murderer shall be put to death let us pray father Lord Jesus what a privilege it is to have that Refuge tonight god father that the righteous can run therein and be saved oh Father Lord the Avenger is on every hand but father we we are in a city tonight Lord and that city is you Lord so father I pray that you would help me tonight to get out of your way that you might speak lift to ear to your children father that we wouldn't leave the same that we came in but we'd leave a better Christian and that'll only happen if you'll speak through me tonight God oh Jesus I give you everything tonight Lord that you might minister to your children take complete control of me in this service in Jesus name I pray amen and amen you may be seated I want to talk tonight a little subject you can be seated I want to talk tonight about a little subject tonight a little little simple thought tonight the City of Refuge amen aren't you glad that you have a place that you can go tonight look at this I I you know you can type it out right here where we're at tonight in this place here that we are able to come in here into this church and into this place and we it's it's a church and we can come in and we can sit in here and we can hear from God you know when all other things is going on all around but there's a place that the righteous has been obtained for that they are able to come to and to be able to set and to be able to pull and to be able to feed on the unfailing body word of the son of man I'm so glad that God all he don't never he don't never leave his children he all never forsake them he's always has a place for them and you know what is at at the appointed time and place he has for me and you tonight is to be here that we might receive something from him just one word from him can change your life one word from him can remove all doubt one word from him can heal you one word from him can deliver you one word from him can change your complete life amen he said he spoke with power and authority when he was at the when he was at the the San Hons and all those men were standing there and they said never a man spake like this man that's right you what I can say that tonight there was God had sent a prophet in this hour that he that never have I heard a man Brother Carlos that spake like that man you know why because God was using that man he ordained one man to come and bring us a message in this hour to turn us from where we was not into but away from ain't you glad we have a message that turned us away from all of these things denominational ideas and thoughts and turned us to the pure word of God because Jesus prayed a prayer over me and you he said father I pray that you'll sanctify them through Thy word Thy word is truth and I believe that's what God has sent he sent us a true word in this hour that we can be Sanctified by you know when he when he sent his word and it healed them he sent word in this hour to bring us to the place to where we'd be clean to be able to take a Rapture he sent not just any message he sent a message with rapturing faith and I believe this message I'll type it tonight as the City of Refuge I believe I'm so thankful that God has ordained this there was six cities which they order had around but you know what God said I'm not just going to be in this six cities I'm going to to be the complete Refuge to the Gentiles they won't have to be in a certain town they won't have to be in a certain place but they can be in me because where I am the Eagles will gather oh I'm so tangled for the word of God turn with me to to Exodus chapter 21 verse 24 just I'm read a few scriptures and then we'll just let God have his way hey man I tell you what a wonderful thing God has done for us in this hour we don't don't ever don't ever take it lightly don't ever don't ever let it become common to you don't don't ever let it just become just just a ritualistic thing to you it's got to become a living reality to you I'm so thankful that God has sent us the word and it healed us it's healing us to the place to where we are coming to the place back to where the original is a message that would send us back to the truth back to the original you know what was so special about this about the message is so special about it's not that it was it was not about a cloud it was not about a certain place but the message was about Jesus Christ it introduced me to Christ you know what the message is to me it's the Mighty God unveiled he's unveiled himself to me and you in this hour oh I can see clearly now oh I'm so thankful that God has removed all the clouds of doubt and unbelief that we can see more clearly than we ever have Paul said I used to look through a stained glass but there'll be a day and a time come and that's I believe is right now that we are seeing clearly what is going on Amen we won't be caught unaware in this time we see that we see that it come to a place that that that where that the the uh Israelites got to so they were so so uh caught up in in in this and there was the law an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth it was Man's Revenge for man and God had to do something God had to bring a supreme judge he had to bring a a thing to where it could be set before not just one man avenging another man but the where they would had to come before and be judge if it was right if it was a accident or whatever happened that's why God sent Jesus Christ because because man had messed this up but we see that here that he had they they they got to such a place I believe brother Steven to a place to where they was enjoying this they was enjoying an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth they would they they was they was taking pleasure in this and God said wait a minute I have to I'm going to make a place where a man if he makes a mistake you know what we was not we was not we was forced into this marriage this first marriage we we was we was we was red into this that's right we was overtaken we we didn't go into this willfully we was deceived when it fall in the garden BR a deception and we come into this wedding and God had to send a place that mean you could come to and have a place of safety in a place of atonement in a place that we could be that we could be righteous like him because the only way that we could be righteous we had to be in him and he had to send an atonement on Calvary and shed his blood that mean you could run into this city which is Jesus Christ and be saved oh I'm so thankful for that you know I'm so thankful because I like what the scripture said he took it even front that God said vengeance is mine sayith the Lord we're not wrestling against flesh and blood we're wrestling against principalities and spiritual wickedness in high places a lot of the high places is in people's mind because the Bible say as a man thinketh so is he oh Hallelujah now the Lord when he gave this law concerning the Cities of Refuge he took advantage of their deep rooted love for the system of Revenge by the nearest blood relative and God acted wisely in this he always does in all things instead of refusing the Jews what they had regarded as such a privilege of taking Vengeance he said on their brothers God rendered it almost impossible that a man should be killed unless he was a murderer for he appointed six cities at a good distance so that when a man killed another by accident and so committed that he could once flee to there to those cities that he might stay there for the rest of his life until the high priest died yet the Avenger of the blood could never touch him unless he left the city oh my I have no desire to leave the city hey the Avenger is still there what people don't realize brothers and sisters is the Avenger is still outside the city waiting on you to leave oh I'm so thankful for the grace of God that he would open this up to us and let us see we don't have to leave we're in the place God has ordained us to be he has set us in Heavenly places is in Christ Jesus where can we go as Peter said to whom shall we go for thou Hast the words of eternal life that's what this message is is the words of eternal life to me and you this is the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and I'm so thankful that God is giv us this opportunity to be in this city of Refuge let's look at this city just for a minute you know that that that the Avenger you know that he was a near Kinsman boy a't you glad have the problem how would we have know that Satan was a more near Kinsman to us if he wouldn't have told us I mean we I mean how would we have know those things I like what the what the Unix said to Philip when he come to him he said I read these things but how can I understand Lisa man show me you know what God's always had an order and he always sent a prophet he revealed his word to a prophet he has never changed he never will change he cannot change that's why God had to send a prophet in this hour oh Hallelujah yes a you thankful for the truth he said You shall know the truth that means you'll become part of it it'll become a reality to you it'll be revealed to you your eyes will be open yes sir and you'll see the truth and it shall make you free oh what a freedom we have in Jesus Christ and this nearest kinsman redeemer was Satan through our first birth from the fall in the garden right he was nearer we would have never knew that but he didn't want us hallelujah we didn't need him we needed a savior and we Reed Jesus Christ he become our Boaz he accepted all of mine and your shame and all of our sins and all of our problems and all of our mistakes and all of our things that we had he took it all to Calvary and buried it beneath the blood of Jesus Christ he didn't hold back not one thing from us a nearer ain't you glad that there was one that said come on in here with me come in me he just open he just unveiled himself and said come on in here come on in me don't worry about the Avenger don't worry about all the Talking don't worry about all this and that and that and this all this questions and all these things and these different websites and all come in to me come into me his challenges come into him in there you have nothing all you have is him oh Hallelujah you know what this message has done for me it has blinded me from all the other things oh Hallelujah has blinded me y you know what it's come to the what it is is we have come to the place right now like brother Brown said he said Jesus walked unconscious to [Music] criticism so what if they criticized still doesn't change my position I'm still not going to come out hey because I have been born in this there's a difference there's a difference either you're a fan or you're a follower you know we see lot of fans that are leaving a lot of fans have left you know what a fan is is an enthusiastic admirer we don't admire this message we love this [Applause] message we're not this is not a sport event we don't change teams we've got the winning team Jesus Christ Hallelujah a you thankful for the grace of God hallelujah a follower is a devouty of a particular person or cause he's devoted to it that's the difference he said come follow me many walked away because they was offended in his words they look P they look for this and they look for that when they failed to see who was there oh Hallelujah you know what I can say tonight I find no fault in this man named Jesus amen there's there is no fault in him and he is the message to me amen if you try to make this message anything else beside of Jesus Christ you will fail that's right it was not about a man it was not about a prophet it was about Jesus Christ and him alone it was the Mighty God unveiled what it did for me and you is it brought an invisible Union of the Bride to Christ in a dark age it BR a wedding ceremony it put the unmar wedding band of Grace upon us we're not going over there to be married we are married here we're going over there for the wedding supper what is Refuge it's a condition of being safe or sheltered from Pursuit it's is from danger or trouble you don't have to worry about what America's fixing to do you've already got a City of Refuge we're not of this world if we of this world the world would love us we knew these things was coming why because God sent a prophet if you can't see the the prophetic Ministry it's your own fault you know what if if this gospel be hid it's here from those that are lost he said the Paul said the God of this evil age have blinded their eyes from the truth what blinded them internet what is internet enter to a net and see you can't enter into a spider's web and expect not to get bit right you cannot that's why they say do you go here do you go there I said no I don't have no need for that I don't have a spider nature so I don't need to go into a web oh I'm so thankful that God has given us this we don't realize realize it brothers and sisters if you've not been born again you've not received the Holy Ghost then you know that you know what this the the the your cell phone has become a tree of knowledge everybody's on Facebook everybody's on this chat talking doing this and what are they're doing they're failing to do what they really need to read their Bible and pray the Bible said knowledge shall increase huh ever learning and never coming to the knowledge of [Music] Truth oh my I'm glad God sent us a message in this hour that we wouldn't just be a fan we become a follower what did Peter saying 1 Peter 3:13 he said and who is he that will harm you if you be followers of that which is good amen who can harm you amen you're a follower of what's good what is good Jesus Christ the son of the Living God that died and paid a price for me and you oh Hallelujah ain't you thankful that you have a refuge tonight that you can go into and let the pressure off brother Steven oh my you can connect to him just connect to him and let it go he said don't worry don't be dismay don't fear I am with thee even in thee to the end oh what a promise that he has given us and you know what he is the promis keeper yes sir he said my Commandments are not Grievous you know what the message has become Grievous to a lot of people but you know what it's not a message of dos and don'ts to me it's a message of life oh Hallelujah a't you thankful that God has given the Avenger never leaves that he's waiting watching and waiting for you to come right I'm not going to read in in in in in in second Samuel here from it but there was a there was a there was a great fight that Abner and joab they said let the men fight Among Us let the young men wrestle and it become a big Slaughter and Abner there was a great there was a great loss going on for admer so he fled he fled but he knew that if he could get to that City heon they had to stop but he had what was it it was joab's brother was following him he said stop go back I'm through I'm not I'm just illustrating I don't want no more war go away least I have to kill you and he kept coming and he killed him he Smit smoted him under the fifth rib and joab was coming too but his brother was much faster than him and what Happ to run into the city of Hebron and joab had to stop because there was a law oh my many have been slain in this battle but we have a city that we can run into but you know what joab was very deceptive man that's right a very deceiving man what did he do he knew he couldn't go in the city and bring Abner out so he sent Messengers in huh that's what Satan's done he sent Messengers in around the message to try to get you to come out come on out come on out and I said no not me I cannot leave I've been ordained to stay here you have been ordained here for this he said come on out then he kept sending them in and finally adner he come he said tell him no more war between me and you let us make a friendship after ad done talk to David see how he waited to the after he'd been talking to the king to think try to make him think everything's okay that's how Satan is he wants you to make you think everything's okay I don't mind if you read a few quotes I don't mind if you do just come on back out come on back oh my brother how deceptive it is right and then here he said a man tells him to come out and this messenger tells him ain't no comes to him meet meet him here so hner comes out and meets and he meets joah he tells him you know everything's all right and he gets up close to him like he's going to hug him and and welcome him brother Robert and he stabs him and he kills him that's right and it brings grief to the king because why he killed innocent blood that's right that made the king but you know what the Bible said and David said the king said about that he said Abner died as one of the foolish men of Israel because he listened to the messengers of joab Brothers we don't need to have our ears open to that we don't need to have keep our minds on those things we keep our mind in this message we keep listening to the tapes we keep reading the Bible we keep praying because what it is it's lying upon line precept upon precept here a little there a little ain't you glad that God has given us the ability to lend a death a a death ear to joab's Messengers be careful who tries to be your friend I seen a little thing that my wife had it was a woman talking to another woman but the shadow of the light cast and it seen that this the shadow of the other woman she was
