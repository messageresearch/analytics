[22:41] [Music]
[23:05] one more time as our brother comes soon

[23:34] amen
[23:40] respiration

[23:52] [Music]

[24:04] [Music]
[24:12] [Music]
[24:16] jesus
[24:18] [Music]
[24:24] amen amen
[24:27] blessed be the name of the lord
[24:30] redemption by blood that's the greatest
[24:34] love story
[24:36] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[24:40] you remember that lamb he was slain
[24:42] before the foundation of the world
[24:44] amen and he took the weakness of god
[24:48] through a woman to bring that lamb
[24:51] and shed the blood for you and me and
[24:54] that's the greatest love story
[24:56] because somebody took your place he took
[24:59] my place
[25:00] he shed his blood he paid the price and
[25:03] now we are totally free
[25:05] full redemption hallelujah
[25:08] calvary made a way to sunset monday
[25:12] that's why the seven angel came amen
[25:15] opening the seventh here blessed be the
[25:18] name of the lord
[25:19] hallelujah church we are on the winning
[25:22] side
[25:23] amen amen amen amen
[25:27] blessed be the name of the lord
[25:29] hallelujah
[25:30] hallelujah thank you brother evil oh my
[25:34] god
[25:35] ready for the word amen
[25:41] i believe now we have a different
[25:42] perspective on our sisters right
[25:45] amen now we look at them like treasures
[25:49] of god amen because redemption was
[25:52] explained there
[25:54] the devil used eve to introduce and god
[25:57] use
[25:58] mary to counteract amen both of them
[26:01] are struggling but he didn't know he
[26:04] beat the wrong place amen
[26:08] he thought he got us in trouble and it's
[26:10] just a way for christ to express
[26:13] his attribute amen that's why we are
[26:16] even
[26:16] born in sin shaping and iniquity
[26:20] coming into the world speaking lies so
[26:23] now calvary can have a reason to be
[26:25] there
[26:26] amen now when you come to him he say i
[26:29] already knew
[26:29] that's why i slew that land before the
[26:32] foundation of the world
[26:34] amen how can i be a redeemer if you're
[26:37] not lost
[26:39] amen you must be lost first then he can
[26:42] come and rescue you
[26:43] amen and not only that he even went
[26:47] all the way down to hell
[26:50] oh my god if the devil having they known
[26:54] the wisdom of god they would not have
[26:56] crucified
[26:57] the prince of peace amen they didn't
[27:01] know they thought they're doing
[27:02] something
[27:03] really great actually death was losing
[27:06] his thing amen please remember

[34:09] into this area here by the grace of god
[34:11] i
[34:12] surely don't consider myself a teacher
[34:14] but we want to
[34:15] take our time and go through a lot of
[34:16] scriptures because uh
[34:19] the devil's in trouble huh
[34:22] kick the devil out hum brother robert i
[34:24] love that song
[34:25] kick the devil out
[34:29] you know we got him on the run you know
[34:31] saints
[34:33] you know we're not trying to keep up
[34:34] with the devil he's trying to keep up
[34:36] with us
[34:37] and you'll see what when brother branham
[34:39] start talking about what we're going to
[34:41] look at tonight
[34:42] uh you know we're going to look at one
[34:45] little point here it's going we want to
[34:47] look at james and james marines
[34:49] that's what we're going to look at
[34:51] tonight because brother branham talked
[34:53] about that in the end time
[34:55] and jesus christ talked about that in
[34:57] the end time
[34:58] so it's a spirit that is a religious
[35:00] demon we started out
[35:02] the last time we were here and let us
[35:04] get caught up i'm going to um
[35:06] read some things and then um we'll we'll
[35:09] get to our message
[35:10] spirits of doctrine you know the last
[35:13] time we were here
[35:15] we were showing you is by god's grace as
[35:17] no coincidence
[35:18] that god have us here and we read this
[35:22] out of the
[35:24] church age page 377 under the resume
[35:28] of the seven church ages and it says
[35:31] and we're reading this age started as
[35:33] after the turn of the 20th century
[35:35] as it was to be the age in which the
[35:38] true church
[35:39] would return to bring the bride
[35:42] where she was at pentecost we know that
[35:45] there must be a necessity be a return of
[35:48] the dynamic
[35:49] power see we're going to have the
[35:51] mechanics and the dynamics we're going
[35:53] to show you
[35:54] where it's going to be so close is going
[35:56] to deceive the very elect
[35:57] but it won't deceive us is that right
[36:00] huh
[36:01] because i like what the holy spirit said
[36:03] sunday because we were in the back of
[36:05] god's mind
[36:06] we're in the back of his mind is that
[36:09] right
[36:10] he knew and we are but we are following
[36:13] his thought we were his attributes we
[36:16] are
[36:17] for performing his word that god
[36:20] saw before the foundation of the world
[36:23] is that right
[36:24] so we're moving into something in this
[36:26] atria saturn
[36:28] but we're going to show you by the grace
[36:30] of god
[36:31] we are living a victorious life we
[36:33] should be
[36:34] living a victorious a joyous life
[36:38] that's why the lord told us even in my
[36:40] re-infirmities when the revelation
[36:43] came unto paul i said what i shall
[36:46] rejoice
[36:46] even in my infirmities is that right
[36:50] because he caught a revelation of why
[36:53] god want us to respond to those things
[36:56] is that right
[36:56] i don't want to get ahead of myself let
[36:58] me finish reading
[37:00] he said now he says he said the
[37:03] believers since
[37:05] in their spirits and began crying to god
[37:08] for a new outpouring such as it was in
[37:11] the first century
[37:13] he says what seemed to be the answer
[37:15] came as many
[37:16] began to speak in tongues manifesting
[37:18] the gifts
[37:19] it was believed that this was indeed the
[37:22] long-awaited restoration
[37:25] it says see this is what they thought
[37:28] this is what these religious
[37:29] demons is right they was hiding behind
[37:31] this they was hiding in that apes okay
[37:34] so we got over this it was not for the
[37:37] latter rain
[37:38] can come only after the former rain
[37:41] which is
[37:42] the spring or the teaching rain the
[37:45] latter rain then is the harvest rain
[37:48] how could this be the real thing when
[37:50] the teaching reign had not come
[37:52] see so the last time we were here god is
[37:55] showing us
[37:56] that now we're here we're in the right
[37:58] place and the only way you could be in
[38:00] the right place
[38:01] it got to be by predestination is that
[38:03] right
[38:04] god already foreign hallelujah
[38:07] so he says now he says
[38:11] so the latter rain then is the harvest
[38:13] rain how could this be the real thing
[38:15] when the teaching reign had not come the
[38:17] prophet
[38:18] messenger who was to be sent to teach
[38:21] the people
[38:22] and turn the hearts of the children back
[38:24] to the pentecostals father
[38:26] had not yet come let me drop down a
[38:29] little bit
[38:29] he says in he said in it was a mixture
[38:33] of
[38:33] unrighteous partaking of spiritual
[38:36] blessings
[38:36] and manifesting the holy ghost you see
[38:39] what we were saying
[38:40] so he was saying even there at pentecost
[38:43] they was dancing
[38:44] they were shouting they were speaking in
[38:47] tongues
[38:48] manifesting the gifts but they still had
[38:51] a
[38:51] devil hiding with inside of them is that
[38:54] right
[38:55] there was some genuinely had the holy
[38:58] ghost
[38:58] but you still had a mixed multitude you
[39:01] had the devil there in the midst of it
[39:03] is that right
[39:04] so that's why the ones that's here is
[39:07] grace
[39:07] is always warning before judgment god is
[39:11] now
[39:11] warning the ones that came out is that
[39:14] right
[39:14] from where they came out at and thought
[39:17] they was going to hide
[39:18] but you got to understand the word is
[39:21] able to discern
[39:22] the thoughts and the intents of the
[39:24] heart what you
[39:25] hear in pentecost is no hiding now
[39:28] because the word is coming to unfold
[39:31] everything
[39:31] in this hour is that right we're going
[39:33] to what drug
[39:34] we're going to speak the word is that
[39:40] right
[39:43] look what he says he said under the
[39:47] he says spiritual blessings and
[39:49] manifestation
[39:50] in the holy ghost has had kept pointing
[39:53] out to you
[39:54] and it was it was the devil power as men
[39:57] were
[39:58] under the control of devils he said yet
[40:01] no one seemed to realize it
[40:04] to prove that it was not real these
[40:07] people even before the second generation
[40:10] these people organized and wrote their
[40:13] unscriptural
[40:14] doctrines that's why we say our topic is
[40:17] spirits of
[40:18] doctrine of religion okay you
[40:21] know y'all put on your spiritual caps
[40:23] tonight because you gotta
[40:24] the holy spirit not only told us that we
[40:28] have to have what discernment is that
[40:30] right
[40:31] each and we know what's right and wrong
[40:33] but you now
[40:34] god has put in you spiritual discernment
[40:37] you should live to recognize the tricks
[40:39] of the devil
[40:40] okay that's why we said put on the whole
[40:43] armor of god
[40:44] so you may be able to withstand the
[40:46] wilds the trickery
[40:47] of the devil in these last days is that
[40:50] right because the devil we come with all
[40:52] kinds of tricks
[40:53] we're going to show you this is the
[40:55] fullness of it
[40:56] the fullness of it is because you have
[40:59] to know
[40:59] what the lord is ministering giving the
[41:02] pastor
[41:03] what he's given the pastor you got to
[41:05] understand
[41:06] after this is the rapture you hear what
[41:08] we're saying
[41:09] we're getting out of here saints let's
[41:11] bear with us on
[41:13] tonight hallelujah he said now look
[41:17] he says lordy i feel good he says
[41:20] organizer wrote their unscripted
[41:22] doctrine
[41:23] and built and built their their own
[41:25] fences
[41:26] and group ahead he says remember
[41:29] while jesus was upon the earth so was
[41:33] judas
[41:34] each came from a different spirit and
[41:36] upon death each to
[41:38] to their own place the spirit of christ
[41:41] now we want to go to um second thessalon
[41:45] i mean
[41:45] ii timothy let's go to second timothy
[41:48] three
[41:49] and what we're working with
[41:53] god give us grace
[41:56] i got this little ipad up here trying to
[41:58] get like your young fellas holly for
[42:00] polycarp maybe i could learn to use
[42:02] these ipads or something huh

[42:08] got he says now look
[42:09] second thirst that's second timothy
[42:11] three you have it say amen
[42:14] he said this know also that in the last
[42:17] days
[42:18] perilous times shall come see the times
[42:21] now the only way you're going to be able
[42:23] to tolerate this
[42:24] you're going to have to realize you're
[42:26] going to have to have the baptism of the
[42:27] holy ghost
[42:28] is that right now when god came in there
[42:31] he's moving us
[42:32] into now into a position to where that
[42:35] individual bride last time we was here
[42:38] she knows she's having a revival with
[42:40] inside
[42:41] is that right she knows that the lord is
[42:44] moving is that right
[42:46] so we have to understand in this hour
[42:48] here now
[42:49] what god has called us to do no one can
[42:52] perform
[42:53] what god has you to do in the back of
[42:56] his mind
[42:57] is that right so in the lord i tell you
[42:59] that's what he was trying to show us
[43:01] their sunday morning right he said it
[43:03] was what what is that bro rabbit north
[43:07] huh he told us west he tore his south
[43:10] and he said what east is that right
[43:13] isn't that right
[43:14] see the whole time that's where god
[43:17] wanted to play
[43:18] the whole time god never wanted to deal
[43:21] with the outer part
[43:22] the body of the spirit he wanted to deal
[43:24] with the heart
[43:25] he always wanted to deal with your heart
[43:28] that's why he says when malloy cloud
[43:30] four come when malachi
[43:32] 4 came this was this he said he said
[43:34] turn to what the hearts of the fathers
[43:36] of the children
[43:37] back to malachi 4 and 5 okay
[43:41] hallelujah thank you jesus
[43:44] he said now look for for men shall be
[43:47] lovers of their own what
[43:50] self you're talking about men we're
[43:52] talking put on your spiritual caps we're
[43:55] talking about
[43:56] demon forces here tonight
[43:59] he says now he says belovers of their
[44:01] own self
[44:02] covenant boasters proud blasphemous
[44:06] disobedient to parents unthankful
[44:09] unholy without what natural affection
[44:13] truth breakers false accusers
[44:16] incontinent despises of those that are
[44:18] good
[44:19] now remember these are demon forces
[44:23] that are hiding in people's lives that
[44:25] are claiming to be christians
[44:28] huh they are claiming to be christians
[44:32] so we are not to come in with a critical
[44:34] spirit
[44:35] we are coming here you'll see it's
[44:37] things that god is allowing to do what
[44:40] to build the character of christ in our
[44:42] lives is that right
[44:44] so that's why tribulation work and
[44:47] patience
[44:47] taking work experience experiences work
[44:50] with hope the hope that we shall not
[44:52] be ashamed of is that right
[44:55] hallelujah thank you lord
[44:59] he says traitors heavy high-minded
[45:02] lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
[45:04] god
[45:05] see these demon forces you're going to
[45:07] recognize them
[45:08] in people's lives we're just hitting the
[45:11] surface we don't have time to go in all
[45:13] these things you got to go home and dig
[45:14] into them
[45:15] these are demon forces that are in
[45:17] people's lives
[45:18] and we know we want we come to set free
[45:21] because we know that god
[45:23] actually created man
[45:26] in his image in his likeness is that
[45:28] right
[45:29] so we know that these people are really
[45:32] thirsting for god
[45:33] is there we know that they're thirsting
[45:36] for god
[45:36] we are not trying to get him to a church
[45:39] and we are not trying to get him to a
[45:41] catholic a baptist a methodist a
[45:43] lutheran a presbyterian
[45:45] is that right you have to catch the
[45:47] revelation you
[45:48] study with a baptist you become a
[45:50] baptist you study with a catholic you
[45:52] become a catholic
[45:53] you study with a lutheran you become a
[45:55] lutheran but oh god
[45:57] if someone studied with you study with
[45:59] the word
[46:00] study with a christian they become just
[46:02] like christ
[46:03] is that right hallelujah
[46:06] [Applause]
[46:07] this is real saints that's why we're
[46:11] playing churches over it's over
[46:14] we're in the war you're in a real war
[46:17] and you're going to see
[46:18] these demons is targeted at us these
[46:20] demons come to take us out
[46:22] is that right that's why brother
[46:24] polycarp what did he say
[46:25] he said thanking god for what he did
[46:28] looking for the things to come
[46:29] but they're always missing what god is
[46:31] doing right there and in the midst of
[46:33] them is that right
[46:34] only way you're going to know the word
[46:36] that you receive
[46:37] you have to apply it to your life you
[46:40] have to apply it
[46:41] you have to believe it and that's the
[46:43] only way it's going to come to life is
[46:44] that right
[46:45] hallelujah look what he says
[46:49] he says having a form of godliness but
[46:52] denying the power thereof
[46:54] from which they turn away see denying
[46:57] the holy ghost
[46:58] denying that baptism of the holy ghost
[47:01] the only thing that's going to save them
[47:03] the only thing that's going to keep them
[47:05] and deep down inside
[47:06] that's why brother branham said when he
[47:08] ran that baptism
[47:10] of the holy ghost series when he ran
[47:12] that series he said this is a soul
[47:14] meeting
[47:15] this is something to clean your soul
[47:17] something to get down in there
[47:19] so you'll be able to walk right ready to
[47:21] talk right
[47:22] able to love right you're able to pray
[47:24] right maybe to sing right
[47:26] everybody rejoice right is that right
[47:29] you're recognizing then
[47:30] there's something else that happened in
[47:32] that garden is that right you got to go
[47:34] dig when he's in that garden where there
[47:36] was adam was never supposed to be on the
[47:39] outside of the garden anyway
[47:40] he was supposed to be in the east side
[47:42] is that right the holy ghost brought
[47:44] that thing up beautiful son
[47:46] is that right so what he was there for
[47:48] why did he bring him out of egypt
[47:50] hallelujah i want to get ahead of myself
[47:53] thank you lord
[47:54] he said his word sometimes have a what a
[47:56] compound meaning
[47:58] huh he goes
[48:02] look what he says verse 6 he says for
[48:06] of this sort are they which creep in
[48:09] their houses
[48:10] and lay captive silly silly
[48:13] women excuse me silly women laden with
[48:16] sins
[48:17] led away with what divers what
[48:21] lust come in there you talking about
[48:24] supposed to be so-called christians
[48:27] huh supposed to be saying that they're
[48:29] born again
[48:30] saying that they got the holy ghost son
[48:32] you got people up in the pool pit
[48:34] not even living clean lives is that
[48:37] right and they're saying they speaking
[48:39] and seeking and people have
[48:40] with silly women is that right but god
[48:43] said their father shall be made known
[48:46] is that right he's unfolding it
[48:49] hallelujah
[48:50] look what we're talking about hillary
[48:52] women he says ever learning
[48:54] and never able to come to the knowledge
[48:58] of the what
[48:58] the truth unbelief to see that unbelief
[49:01] is
[49:02] in their souls there we're going to look
[49:04] at it
[49:05] he says now here's what we're looking at
[49:07] tonight james and jamboree
[49:09] james and jamboree i wrote the thing
[49:12] down there they
[49:14] this is two spirits brother branham
[49:16] talked about these two
[49:18] and when he talked about him what he was
[49:20] he was trying to show him
[49:22] it was going to be there in the end time
[49:25] in any time that this spirit was going
[49:27] to be
[49:28] jamborees mean opposing
[49:31] and rebellious that's the spirit that's
[49:34] on
[49:34] the jamborees and jainans
[49:38] mean vexed and disputed okay
[49:41] so you watch these spirits we're going
[49:43] to go through some scriptures and you
[49:45] can recognize him
[49:46] so what we do is that's why he says you
[49:49] got the son of god
[49:52] in this message and you've got the sons
[49:53] of the prophets in this message
[49:55] the sons of gods discern things
[49:58] spiritually is that right
[50:00] they let the holy ghost they could
[50:02] discern these things
[50:03] and when they discern these things and
[50:05] things that god
[50:06] show them is because their hearts and
[50:09] their minds are right
[50:10] and god know they would take it to them
[50:12] in prayer they would not be
[50:14] critical they would not kill nobody down
[50:16] they would try to set that person free
[50:19] so that's why god would share those
[50:20] things with them that's what we're
[50:22] talking about
[50:23] because if my brother is bond was
[50:25] foreign and fornication
[50:27] you going to let my brother go if god
[50:30] bring my name
[50:31] his name to me in prayer i'm going to
[50:33] shout that name there in prayer
[50:35] you're going to let them go if they're
[50:37] struggling with pornography
[50:38] you're going gonna let them go if they
[50:40] struggling with lust
[50:41] you gonna let them go that's what we're
[50:44] gonna do
[50:44] we're gonna go on war we're gonna go our
[50:47] offensive prayer
[50:49] if you want to see a successful
[50:51] christian
[50:52] in anything that he do he will go to the
[50:55] lord
[50:56] in prayer first
[50:58] [Music]
[51:00] ain't that what the holy spirit had that
[51:03] was beautiful
[51:04] what the holy spirit had brother steve
[51:06] say sunday morning
[51:07] if you can a job or you're a proprietor
[51:11] or you have a business
[51:12] or you got a vehicle or something and
[51:16] you know you sought god
[51:18] and god told you it's all right for you
[51:20] to get it
[51:22] then you go right back to god huh
[51:25] he has the answer for it okay
[51:29] when joshua had seen the works of god
[51:33] when god told them that they was going
[51:35] to go out to battle and was not going to
[51:37] lose not a one
[51:38] is that right he immediately did what
[51:41] when they lost i think it was 26 souls
[51:44] joshua immediately did what fell went
[51:47] into prayer
[51:48] crying out to god because he knew if i
[51:52] can't depend on god's word
[51:54] then who can i depend on huh
[51:59] look what he says help us lord
[52:02] he says now look james and jim marine
[52:07] he says now every learning is never
[52:08] coming to the knowledge
[52:10] of the truth he said now as james and
[52:12] jamarine which stood moses
[52:15] as so do these also resist the what
[52:18] the truth he says what now even brother
[52:20] branham said look at this he said men
[52:23] he said men of corrupt minds
[52:27] reprobate see they just rock low down
[52:31] fear god fear nobody down in their soul
[52:35] they head into the pits of hell that's
[52:37] why jesus said
[52:38] you vipers you snake in the grass you
[52:41] always resist the holy ghost
[52:43] just like your fathers is that right he
[52:46] knew
[52:46] jesus could discern his only one knew
[52:48] that they was of the devil is that right
[52:51] because he recognized that religious
[52:53] demon
[52:54] what the holy ghost said the first thing
[52:56] they're going to attack
[52:57] they always come in in the message of
[53:00] the hour
[53:00] is that right they always attacking the
[53:03] message of the hour
[53:04] but we have to understand now what god
[53:07] has given us now and i'm going to get to
[53:08] and read it but what he's given us
[53:10] now is that the devil the religious
[53:13] demons
[53:14] know that they're in trouble hear what
[53:17] he said
[53:17] they know it huh that's right brother
[53:19] robert they know they in trouble
[53:21] but what we have to do is we got to know
[53:24] that we got him on the run
[53:26] is that right you got the right to bind
[53:28] you got the right to loose side
[53:30] you got the right to grant somebody
[53:32] eternal life you speaking by faith
[53:34] you will because god's going to do it in
[53:37] his time
[53:38] but he'll do it how much more shall he
[53:41] avenge what
[53:42] his elect if i sigh and cry and pray
[53:45] day and night is that right god will do
[53:48] it for his elect
[53:49] oh faith when i return to the earth
[53:51] shall i find what
[53:54] faith
[53:56] this is a faith this is a faith that's
[53:59] working by love
[54:01] [Music]
[54:02] what's driving him is love was he a real
[54:05] revelation of my wife and i was going
[54:07] through virginia one time
[54:09] and we were driving through virginia and
[54:11] we got
[54:12] and we was going into a a walmart was
[54:15] out there
[54:16] and there was some mother cat and her
[54:18] kitties
[54:19] was running across the um i was running
[54:22] across
[54:23] walking across the street and i tell you
[54:25] that's when i got the revelation of love
[54:27] god comes in simplicity
[54:29] i mean the true revelation and cars was
[54:31] out there
[54:32] and one of the kittens went back
[54:36] that mama kitten ran out in that street
[54:40] dropped that traffic to get her baby
[54:43] and grabbed that kitten and went on back
[54:45] over there
[54:47] that's a that's a faith that's working
[54:49] by love
[54:52] he said look what he says he says
[54:56] he says the men of corrupt mind let's go
[54:59] over
[55:00] to exodus 7. when we look at 7
[55:04] yeah exodus 7 you'll see
[55:08] when god was dealing with moses and he
[55:11] didn't
[55:12] and and he didn't pacify moses
[55:15] he didn't enjoy moses telling them that
[55:17] he was incompetent
[55:19] god said well who made the mouth that is
[55:22] god was rebuking him but he extended
[55:25] that hand of grace to him and did what
[55:28] and allow aaron to be his prophet
[55:31] and moses was a god to the people he
[55:34] said now look at here
[55:36] we're talking about james and jamarine
[55:39] let's start at verse 8
[55:41] for the sake of time he says and the
[55:43] lord spake unto moses and aaron sing
[55:46] when pharaoh shall shall speak unto you
[55:49] saying show a miracle for you he said
[55:52] then thou
[55:53] shall say unto aaron take thyroid
[55:56] and cast it before pharaoh and it shall
[55:59] become a what
[56:01] a serpent he said and moses and aaron
[56:04] went and went in unto pharaoh
[56:08] and they did so as the lord had
[56:10] commanded
[56:11] and aaron cast down his right before
[56:14] pharaoh and before his servants
[56:16] and it became a serpent it says
[56:19] then pharaoh also called the who
[56:23] now look at the wise men brother brandon
[56:27] talked about this jesus talked about
[56:29] them in the end time
[56:32] so here i went and just pulled up the
[56:34] hebrew of it
[56:36] look what the wise men are
[56:39] you know god got his wise men satan got
[56:42] his wise man
[56:44] is that right so we have to understand
[56:48] that these wise men here they were
[56:50] talking about
[56:52] these sorcery workers he said they were
[56:56] intelligent
[56:58] they're skillful they're artful
[57:02] they're cunning they're subtle
[57:07] and they're wise-hearted so these are
[57:10] those characteristics we know how the
[57:12] devil is
[57:14] and then also the skillful
[57:18] is the good technical workers if you're
[57:21] writing the scriptures down you can go
[57:22] to isaiah 40s
[57:24] they're they were very they they just
[57:26] didn't get
[57:27] anyone to build these idols
[57:31] they got skillful men that was working
[57:34] there
[57:35] under idolatry on the sorcery they know
[57:38] exactly what they're doing
[57:41] they know exactly what they're looking
[57:43] at that's why we say
[57:45] obedience is better than a sacrifice
[57:48] when the holy spirit was ministering
[57:50] towards
[57:52] um proverbs 7 he says she looked at
[57:55] through the castments of her window
[57:58] and she noticed that some there was void
[58:00] of understanding
[58:02] wherever you're void of understanding
[58:04] act
[58:05] that's where the devil is going to come
[58:08] and try to plug at you out
[58:10] now you have to you know you god says
[58:13] everyone know the wickedness and the
[58:15] bitterness of their own heart
[58:17] you know where you struggle at you got
[58:19] to pray and buying that area up
[58:22] every day until god come and deliver you
[58:25] out of that area
[58:29] as you think it we're talking about
[58:31] fighting we wrestle not
[58:33] against flesh and blood but against
[58:35] principalities
[58:37] and powers and wickedness and rulers of
[58:40] high places
[58:40] is that right but we got our armor
[58:44] is that right which is the word of god
[58:46] which is anointed by god
[58:48] by the spirit of god we have the what
[58:51] the
[58:52] helmet of salvation so you have to
[58:54] understand i don't want to get ahead of
[58:56] myself we're going to go over the second
[58:58] we're going to go over to second
[58:59] corinthians after we read this i finish
[59:01] reading this
[59:02] about these men why jesus talked about
[59:05] these men
[59:06] why brother branham talked about these
[59:08] men in the end time
[59:12] because he said it's going to be so
[59:13] close it will deceive the very elect if
[59:16] it was possible
[59:18] that's why you got the son of gods and
[59:20] the sons of the prophets
[59:23] and we're dealing with this in this end
[59:25] time now they got the same weapons we
[59:28] got
[59:29] and the ones that was in this message
[59:32] they come and they're trying to twist
[59:34] the minds of the people
[59:35] that's why we say the spirit of doctrine
[59:40] the teachings and the teachings they
[59:44] never
[59:44] i saw a man one time and if i didn't
[59:47] know the truth by god's grace and god's
[59:49] mercy
[59:50] i said you know i saw a pastor one time
[59:53] take that trinity and make you think it
[59:55] was right
[59:57] that's right brother robert the
[59:59] theologians i'm telling you
[1:00:01] this is just not a letter here that's
[1:00:04] why they emphasized
[1:00:06] james and jamarine in the end time
[1:00:11] he said why they're wise and
[1:00:14] administrative
[1:00:16] they're very very wise in the
[1:00:18] administration
[1:00:20] you tell i i'm something the one who
[1:00:23] came to me
[1:00:23] delilah delilah was very sharp in the
[1:00:28] administration
[1:00:29] of working on samsung
[1:00:32] once samson got himself out of the will
[1:00:35] of god
[1:00:37] you're playing on the devil's ground now
[1:00:42] so we have to realize now when he got
[1:00:45] around it
[1:00:46] she played him all the way to the end
[1:00:48] and then what
[1:00:49] and got his eyes plucked out is that
[1:00:51] right
[1:00:52] but oh god the devil tried to pull us
[1:00:55] too brother robert
[1:00:57] tried to tell us tell us that clown
[1:00:59] wasn't right didn't he
[1:01:01] ah but god
[1:01:04] hid that for us sir until the end time
[1:01:08] and showed us that samson meant what
[1:01:11] he meant son is that right and he also
[1:01:14] wasn't what the judge is that right
[1:01:17] and he was the judge in the book of
[1:01:19] judges and he brought that cloud down
[1:01:21] there is that right
[1:01:22] and when the sun the mighty cloud came
[1:01:25] it came to bring
[1:01:26] judgment on the land for laodiceas
[1:01:30] he couldn't the very elect
[1:01:33] will not be deceived
[1:01:35] [Applause]
[1:01:37] who know the mind of god who can counsel
[1:01:40] god
[1:01:40] no one
[1:01:47] witchcraft demons witchcraft demons
[1:01:50] didn't know that we had a god of done
[1:01:51] given us a word
[1:01:53] ah he's throwing them shots
[1:01:56] see when you come and you come in and
[1:01:58] attack god's sheep you're like david
[1:02:01] when you're coming you come to mess with
[1:02:02] one of god's sheep you know what you're
[1:02:04] gonna do
[1:02:05] he said you uncircumcised philistine
[1:02:08] i remember when my god took care of that
[1:02:10] lion took care of that bear
[1:02:12] when they come out there in the
[1:02:13] wilderness and try to mess with one of
[1:02:15] my shepherd
[1:02:16] so all you got to do if your father is
[1:02:18] struggling if your mother
[1:02:20] is struggling if your husband is
[1:02:21] struggling if your son is struggling if
[1:02:23] your daughter is struggling
[1:02:24] just call their name out in prayer and
[1:02:27] keep on calling it out
[1:02:29] is that right ain't that worth it you
[1:02:31] got a right to call it out
[1:02:33] remember that woman with her her son got
[1:02:35] caught up with that social disease
[1:02:38] huh she must have read about them over
[1:02:40] there and
[1:02:41] with that unjust judge she must have
[1:02:43] read about that
[1:02:44] unjust judge because she kept coming and
[1:02:47] she kept coming
[1:02:48] praying day and night is that right she
[1:02:50] knew she had a right
[1:02:52] she knew that what christ had done we
[1:02:54] know in his hour here now
[1:02:55] saints he went to the cross living he
[1:02:58] loved me
[1:02:58] dying he saved me buried he carried my
[1:03:01] sins far away
[1:03:02] rising away you got to cast that word
[1:03:05] cast that word out there
[1:03:07] cast that word out there is that right
[1:03:09] he knew you got to bring him down is
[1:03:11] that right
[1:03:12] that's why i don't want they had to get
[1:03:14] that body off of the cross
[1:03:16] didn't they it was not fulfilled yet
[1:03:18] they had to get the body off of the
[1:03:20] cross didn't they
[1:03:21] they had to go get it they had to beg
[1:03:23] them for that body
[1:03:24] because it had to be fulfilled he died
[1:03:26] to do what
[1:03:27] he was buried and carried my sins far
[1:03:30] away
[1:03:31] i better not get on that that's another
[1:03:33] message help me lord
[1:03:35] james and jeremy the spirit of doctrine
[1:03:39] look what they said he says now
[1:03:42] he says in verse 11. then pharaoh
[1:03:45] also called the wise men another thing
[1:03:48] about the wise men
[1:03:50] the shrewd the crafty
[1:03:53] the cunning and the subtle you see
[1:03:56] remember the woman and the youth women
[1:03:59] use those women just like you use
[1:04:01] delilah
[1:04:01] remember the woman when solomon i mean
[1:04:03] not solomon uh
[1:04:04] absalon he wanted to get him back in
[1:04:07] jerusalem and that woman
[1:04:08] and that woman you see how she went to
[1:04:10] that king she knew how to go to that
[1:04:12] king
[1:04:13] she knew how to get what they needed at
[1:04:15] that time so you had the same way you
[1:04:18] takes the spirit that was on paul
[1:04:20] paul knew how to dress king agrippa is
[1:04:22] that right he didn't come to him now
[1:04:24] now paul's spirit was changed when he
[1:04:26] was saw he was he was rough
[1:04:29] he was persecuting christians but when
[1:04:31] you meet jesus your life's changing
[1:04:33] the character changes your walk changer
[1:04:36] your talk changer
[1:04:38] your speech changer his singing saying
[1:04:40] god
[1:04:41] you're no longer real you're no longer
[1:04:43] doing the things the way that you used
[1:04:45] to do
[1:04:45] is that right so when he came in there
[1:04:48] brother greg when he came to king
[1:04:50] agrippa
[1:04:50] he said king of grip herself if you
[1:04:54] permit me to speak sir
[1:04:59] and when paul knew how to agree them he
[1:05:02] knew the order of the pharisees and the
[1:05:04] pharisees
[1:05:05] he was the sadducees he recognized his
[1:05:07] position
[1:05:08] they that the way that woman went to the
[1:05:11] king over over there i think from tikka
[1:05:13] over there when she wanted to get
[1:05:15] absalom back into jerusalem
[1:05:17] i think with joab he wanted to get
[1:05:19] absalom back into jerusalem
[1:05:21] she always addressed the king by his
[1:05:23] authority
[1:05:29] didn't the lord tell us respect the
[1:05:31] position
[1:05:33] you don't have to agree with the
[1:05:34] unrighteousness but you respect
[1:05:36] the position because in them because
[1:05:38] that position still
[1:05:40] can get you grace god can use them to
[1:05:42] get you grace
[1:05:43] look what he says he says
[1:05:46] and also they learn shrew these are wise
[1:05:50] men
[1:05:51] they learn they shrewd
[1:05:54] they're astrologers magicians
[1:06:00] they're wise ethically and religiously
[1:06:04] see they're very they're very spoken
[1:06:07] they speak with wisdom and they know how
[1:06:10] to approach
[1:06:10] they will study your culture
[1:06:16] no i used to get over there i should
[1:06:18] learn people learn around there
[1:06:20] now's the word on the workforce
[1:06:22] supervise people
[1:06:23] fellowship with them find out whether
[1:06:25] that i go home and google it
[1:06:29] i don't care if they're from africa i
[1:06:30] don't care they're from jamaica i don't
[1:06:32] care if they're from there
[1:06:33] i took interest i took
[1:06:36] interest in them and when you take
[1:06:39] interest in them it's an open door when
[1:06:42] i was in the prisons
[1:06:43] new system going in there young men that
[1:06:45] were locked up
[1:06:46] some most of them belong there but some
[1:06:49] are innocent
[1:06:50] they belong in there they couldn't
[1:06:52] understand
[1:06:53] why some of the roughest ones
[1:06:56] they would come to the bible studies
[1:07:00] wisdom comes from god not man
[1:07:04] most of them in there was in love with
[1:07:08] their grandmother or their mother
[1:07:11] i don't care if it was two or three
[1:07:13] hours away
[1:07:15] i would go visit their grandmother
[1:07:17] mother
[1:07:18] and their grandmother would tell them
[1:07:20] that i came to visit them
[1:07:24] all i was after trying to get them to
[1:07:26] christ
[1:07:27] i wasn't looking for no glory i was
[1:07:29] getting the wisdom from god
[1:07:32] and when you see someone and you
[1:07:34] recognize because
[1:07:36] each that's our whole mission we're
[1:07:39] going to show you why paul went to
[1:07:40] prison
[1:07:41] the automotive when your motive
[1:07:43] interjected
[1:07:45] when brother sam was here his motive and
[1:07:48] objective i know brother sam for a year
[1:07:50] is always looking for lost souls
[1:07:54] always looking for lost souls you're
[1:07:56] looking for an opportunity
[1:07:57] let us keep going he said it was wise
[1:07:59] and religiously
[1:08:01] but now let's look down here verse 11.
[1:08:03] he says the pharaoh
[1:08:04] also called wise men and the sorcerers
[1:08:07] now the magicians
[1:08:08] of the of egypt they also did
[1:08:12] like manner with their enchantments
[1:08:15] for they cast down every man
[1:08:19] who was they cast down every man
[1:08:23] now look at this here and they became
[1:08:26] serpents but aaron's rod aaron only had
[1:08:30] the one
[1:08:30] rod
[1:08:33] but look around in there in this end
[1:08:37] time you're going to find out
[1:08:40] that we sorceries all kinds of
[1:08:42] witchcraft
[1:08:44] there's all kinds of demons there's all
[1:08:46] kinds of devils that we're fighting
[1:08:48] against
[1:08:49] moses has announced god put sent
[1:08:52] moses on a mission not to back up but to
[1:08:56] move
[1:08:56] forward cast down your rod
[1:09:01] cast your word out get on offense of
[1:09:04] prayer
[1:09:06] you don't have to inhale anything get on
[1:09:09] offense of prayer
[1:09:11] are you driving those demon forces away
[1:09:14] the devil going to make you think is not
[1:09:16] being effective
[1:09:17] but a fervent prayer of a righteous man
[1:09:20] availeth much
[1:09:24] hallelujah he says now look
[1:09:28] and it did what and it hardened
[1:09:30] pharaoh's heart
[1:09:31] that he hearken not unto them
[1:09:35] let me read something here for you
[1:09:38] god give me grace i won't
[1:09:43] he says look here still working with the
[1:09:45] spirit of
[1:09:46] the the spirit of doctrine this quote
[1:09:50] here come out of uh
[1:09:51] faith works works his faith expressed 11
[1:09:54] 26
[1:09:55] 65 he says why
[1:10:00] moses went down to perform the works of
[1:10:03] god before the people
[1:10:05] and there was james and jamirine
[1:10:07] standing there
[1:10:08] he said but who was first to do it
[1:10:12] these others see were impersonators
[1:10:16] because there had to be an original
[1:10:18] first for them to impersonate
[1:10:20] if they begin to the original he says
[1:10:23] we're not lost we know where
[1:10:25] where we're at see by the scripture and
[1:10:28] by
[1:10:28] the revelation of god that's why you
[1:10:32] still stand
[1:10:33] [Music]
[1:10:35] god we're going to we're going to get
[1:10:36] there we're going to show you why god do
[1:10:38] it
[1:10:39] why did god allow
[1:10:42] why did he allow that same anointing to
[1:10:45] come on someone to come against his
[1:10:47] servant
[1:10:48] when he sent his servant down there on a
[1:10:49] mission
[1:10:52] he said now he says why
[1:10:56] this man he seems visions and so forth
[1:10:59] he does this
[1:11:00] he run around who he's talking about
[1:11:02] these two
[1:11:03] that had gifts he says in three gods
[1:11:06] i'ma drop down for the sake of time
[1:11:08] he said but this word measures them up
[1:11:12] see this word for this day
[1:11:16] we got the measuring stick is that right
[1:11:20] you don't have to back down off of no
[1:11:22] demons
[1:11:23] no sorcery no witchcraft demons
[1:11:26] you got to understand maybe perhaps uh
[1:11:30] there's something in the world that
[1:11:31] you're struggling with
[1:11:33] you have to understand everything some
[1:11:36] has things in their souls they have to
[1:11:38] get out
[1:11:38] maybe they inherited from granddaddy
[1:11:41] grandmama
[1:11:42] from daddy from mama from somewhere
[1:11:45] along the line
[1:11:46] maybe they inherit this thing and they
[1:11:48] struggle in it
[1:11:49] but you have to understand if you got a
[1:11:52] fake
[1:11:53] seed that god put there before the
[1:11:56] foundation of the world
[1:11:58] is that right you have a seed down in
[1:12:01] there
[1:12:01] that faith that's working by love you
[1:12:04] don't have to be concerned about
[1:12:06] what the devil is trying to resurrect in
[1:12:09] your own life
[1:12:10] because jesus when he died and took our
[1:12:13] sins is that right
[1:12:15] and buried them living he loved me dying
[1:12:18] he saved me
[1:12:19] buried he carried my sins far away
[1:12:22] rising
[1:12:23] we now are in the midst of the
[1:12:25] resurrected christ
[1:12:27] the resurrected christ is now here back
[1:12:30] on the scene
[1:12:32] some got it all mixed up we're going to
[1:12:34] read the quote i want to get
[1:12:36] don't want to get ahead of myself but
[1:12:37] you got to understand how to fight this
[1:12:40] devil
[1:12:40] is that right he said because the
[1:12:43] imagination
[1:12:44] of the heart and the mind and the spirit
[1:12:46] of this age
[1:12:47] is kind evil continuously is that right
[1:12:51] that is not us is that right don't let
[1:12:54] the devil keep telling you
[1:12:56] that you were the children of
[1:12:57] disobedience he can't tell me i was a
[1:12:59] child of disobedience
[1:13:01] i was among the i was among the children
[1:13:04] out there in the world
[1:13:06] of disobedience but i was not a child
[1:13:09] of disobedience i was a child of god
[1:13:13] is that right he brought us he told me
[1:13:16] from the beginning of the world that i
[1:13:18] was an attribute
[1:13:19] i was in his mind is that right so you
[1:13:22] have to
[1:13:22] understand now all these things is not
[1:13:25] in you
[1:13:26] sometimes you're just picking up
[1:13:28] thoughts you got to cast
[1:13:29] down every imagination that try to exalt
[1:13:33] itself
[1:13:33] against the word of god so when the word
[1:13:36] is coming
[1:13:37] in his hour here now and is that right
[1:13:39] was peter see
[1:13:41] yes peter with seed is that right but
[1:13:43] jesus did not deal with peter i'm just
[1:13:45] catching the mind of god now
[1:13:47] peter did not kiss but peter was seated
[1:13:50] is that right
[1:13:50] but peter did not done right did not
[1:13:54] speak to jesus
[1:13:55] and tell jesus that he wasn't going to
[1:13:57] go to golgotha
[1:13:59] and died up on that cross is that right
[1:14:02] immediately jesus turned around
[1:14:04] and said what hush your mouth satan is
[1:14:07] that right
[1:14:08] he never rebuked peter those thoughts
[1:14:10] that you're picking up
[1:14:11] that's satan that's taking it bringing
[1:14:13] it through your mind
[1:14:15] that's satan trying to make you think
[1:14:17] you're that person
[1:14:18] but you cast down is that right you've
[1:14:21] been born again is that right
[1:14:23] by the water in other spirits you are a
[1:14:26] child of god
[1:14:27] you have coming to your senses now you
[1:14:30] recognize who you
[1:14:31] are don't stop listening to the devil
[1:14:33] there's no good man
[1:14:35] that's why i said there's truth he
[1:14:37] shrews me
[1:14:38] that's why the holy ghost came and
[1:14:40] ambushed them when the pastor was
[1:14:42] working at that you know what subtle me
[1:14:44] sort of subtle satan knows
[1:14:46] when he said he's professional he's the
[1:14:48] biologist
[1:14:49] knows every part of that body he knows
[1:14:52] every part of that body
[1:14:54] he knows how to touch that body
[1:14:57] he knows how to touch it to bring a
[1:14:59] feeling to you
[1:15:00] hear what i'm saying so you have to
[1:15:03] understand
[1:15:04] that's why the holy ghost teaches us
[1:15:06] first it has to be agape love god
[1:15:09] is that right the agape love anything at
[1:15:12] the agape lover
[1:15:13] is what the affiliated lover and then
[1:15:15] after that is what love stuff
[1:15:17] and then after that is filthy is that
[1:15:19] right he's that's why he says
[1:15:21] they come seeking their lust that lust
[1:15:25] is wrongful thoughts
[1:15:27] is that right the wrongful thoughts
[1:15:29] that's why the last time i was here
[1:15:31] his one of his tactics is obsession
[1:15:36] obsession is received the wrong thoughts
[1:15:39] is that
[1:15:39] right he's trying to get you to receive
[1:15:42] the wrong
[1:15:43] thoughts so he'll shoot those thoughts
[1:15:45] at your mind is that right
[1:15:47] i'ma tell you something i've sat up in
[1:15:49] places
[1:15:50] where you get ready you get ministers
[1:15:53] they got spirits on them
[1:15:54] i'm telling you how to fight this devil
[1:15:56] tonight brother branham said they got to
[1:15:58] be taught
[1:15:59] how to fight this devil i'll tell you i
[1:16:02] see them
[1:16:02] sitting up in there a pastor sitting up
[1:16:05] there that had a spirit on him and when
[1:16:06] he had that spirit on him he was
[1:16:08] shooting that spirit at me
[1:16:10] and i was shooting him back at him he
[1:16:12] was shooting it at me
[1:16:13] i was shooting him back at him and all
[1:16:15] of a sudden that spirit left
[1:16:16] and he did it and he regrouped himself
[1:16:18] and got right i'm trying to tell you
[1:16:22] james and jamarine in the end time
[1:16:27] you don't have to accept nothing but the
[1:16:30] promises of god
[1:16:33] you had to go with no goodness to go in
[1:16:35] there in those institutions
[1:16:38] all he said many come in my name when
[1:16:41] you go into this institution
[1:16:42] every religion it's not uh we wasn't
[1:16:45] it wasn't the murderer was afraid of the
[1:16:48] drug addict
[1:16:50] prostitute child molester
[1:16:54] it wasn't them the one you got most of
[1:16:57] your trouble at was those religious
[1:16:59] demons after you left when you telling
[1:17:02] them
[1:17:03] trinity is no such thing as trinity in
[1:17:05] the scriptures
[1:17:07] and you're telling them there's only one
[1:17:09] matthew 28
[1:17:10] 18 baptized in the name of the father in
[1:17:13] the name of the son
[1:17:15] in the name of the holy ghost the father
[1:17:17] we know is not a name son is not a name
[1:17:19] holy ghost is the pronoun so tell me now
[1:17:22] brother let me give you the what the
[1:17:25] revelation
[1:17:26] of matthew 28 19. now let's go over to
[1:17:30] action you can't get to the book of acts
[1:17:32] until you go
[1:17:33] to the gospels is that right you got to
[1:17:36] come through the gospel
[1:17:37] you got to get it burned out that's why
[1:17:40] it says the doctrines
[1:17:42] of devils when jesus first got his
[1:17:45] disciples
[1:17:46] he went and took them up on the mountain
[1:17:48] and the bible said he did what
[1:17:49] he taught them is that right now you got
[1:17:52] to get you ready
[1:17:53] remember when we went in school and we
[1:17:56] had science
[1:17:56] and we had to dissect that frog when you
[1:17:59] were in there to dissect that frog
[1:18:01] first you went there you had to be
[1:18:03] taught is that right after they told you
[1:18:05] about it
[1:18:05] then you went to the lab for about an
[1:18:08] hour and everybody had to dissect that
[1:18:10] frog is that right
[1:18:12] so that's the same thing in them you got
[1:18:14] to be born again
[1:18:15] by the water and of the spirit is that
[1:18:18] right you got to repent
[1:18:20] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:18:22] christ for the remission of your sins
[1:18:24] and you you shall receive the gift of
[1:18:27] the holy ghost
[1:18:28] there's a promise under you and your
[1:18:29] children and those that are called to
[1:18:31] far off we're going to get to the
[1:18:33] scriptures and act
[1:18:34] and show you what happened when they got
[1:18:36] into the acts is that right
[1:18:37] we're in a war saints you're in a real
[1:18:40] spiritual war
[1:18:41] is that right but we have the victorious
[1:18:44] when the enemy come in like a flood
[1:18:46] god promised to lift up a mighty
[1:18:48] standing against it is that right
[1:18:50] greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:18:52] is in the world
[1:18:54] you have what god is dealing you with
[1:18:56] you let god perfect you with it
[1:18:58] is that right i know i know a person in
[1:19:01] there i'll tell you
[1:19:02] he was so concerned about others he had
[1:19:04] a love for others
[1:19:06] he had a love for others father
[1:19:08] something brother
[1:19:10] the revival is going on it's already
[1:19:13] going on
[1:19:14] and when he moved into his position when
[1:19:17] he moved in his position
[1:19:18] god even manifested more what did he
[1:19:21] wanted to do
[1:19:22] through him is that right once you find
[1:19:25] your position
[1:19:26] that's why i said you may not you may be
[1:19:28] out of place but you'll never lose your
[1:19:30] position before the what
[1:19:31] before the foundation of the world god
[1:19:33] granted you that position is that right
[1:19:36] lift them up on high if you wanna
[1:19:38] miraculously
[1:19:39] work you want the miraculous work to
[1:19:41] happen just go to god and ask god
[1:19:44] and make sure your motive and objective
[1:19:46] is right is that right

[1:23:00] james and jim marine
[1:23:01] he says now but this word measures them
[1:23:04] up
[1:23:05] that's exactly right this is where it
[1:23:08] comes to
[1:23:09] as moses and jamarine and remember he
[1:23:11] said
[1:23:12] james and jamareen withstood moses in
[1:23:14] the last days
[1:23:16] these impersonators will rise on the
[1:23:18] earth again
[1:23:20] did he say it well we got them but
[1:23:23] that didn't stagger moses see we said
[1:23:26] when moses turned around
[1:23:27] and done a miracle in the name of the
[1:23:30] lord
[1:23:30] he stood there's these impersonators
[1:23:34] done the same thing that didn't stop him
[1:23:37] well i guess i'd better quit no it
[1:23:39] didn't he stayed right there
[1:23:41] for what it was revealed to him
[1:23:45] hallelujah he says knowing
[1:23:48] look what he says he says knowing
[1:23:51] knowing that the word would finally
[1:23:54] catch up with them
[1:23:56] don't fuss with them when they say very
[1:23:58] robbery don't
[1:23:59] fuss with them don't argue with him
[1:24:01] don't do nothing you gotta
[1:24:03] love him because he says what he knew
[1:24:06] that the word is gonna catch up with
[1:24:08] them
[1:24:08] he knows there's gonna come a time when
[1:24:11] the word would manifest itself
[1:24:14] and they couldn't go no further so have
[1:24:17] i
[1:24:17] known to see we know that it's coming to
[1:24:21] the point
[1:24:23] the revelation that god is unfolding
[1:24:26] you go into the hidden light the message
[1:24:30] of hidden life the prophet of god kept
[1:24:32] telling us
[1:24:33] in this message here he said see some
[1:24:36] that came here
[1:24:37] they thought it was going to stop they
[1:24:39] thought they were going to be able to
[1:24:41] hide
[1:24:42] they thought they was going to be able
[1:24:43] to bring them devils up in here
[1:24:45] but they didn't check the word brother
[1:24:47] robert they didn't look in it
[1:24:49] in his life brother branham said it's
[1:24:51] going to keep unfolding it's going to
[1:24:53] keep
[1:24:53] unfolding it's going to keep unfolding
[1:24:56] it's going to keep
[1:24:57] unfolding it's going to get sweeter and
[1:25:00] sweeter
[1:25:01] in sweden until we wrap john out of here
[1:25:08] look what he says help me lord he says
[1:25:12] now look at his old rotten tactic satan
[1:25:14] packed it
[1:25:15] he said the devil came right up into a
[1:25:17] person they write to the very thing
[1:25:19] till it comes to the word see now
[1:25:23] see brother gray he's in trouble now
[1:25:26] we have the backup of no devil we know
[1:25:28] what we got
[1:25:30] we know what god promised for this time
[1:25:32] okay
[1:25:33] he said now look he said but he he
[1:25:36] can't he can't satan can't take the word
[1:25:40] he can't take all the word he can bring
[1:25:43] it up
[1:25:44] maybe to one little like he did eve the
[1:25:47] devil did eat
[1:25:48] but he can't cross it all see
[1:25:52] the whole thing is the body of christ
[1:25:55] we got the whole body
[1:25:59] young man i'm telling you if you go over
[1:26:01] there
[1:26:02] god y'all gonna have something that the
[1:26:05] devil knows he's gonna be in trouble
[1:26:06] when they come up against you is that
[1:26:08] right
[1:26:09] because you don't have to fight through
[1:26:11] all that the denominational teachings
[1:26:13] you don't have to fight for that
[1:26:15] foolishness is that right
[1:26:16] you don't have to fight those demons of
[1:26:18] doctrine all you got to do is humble
[1:26:21] yourself
[1:26:22] consecrate yourself and let god use you
[1:26:25] surrender yourself to the will of god
[1:26:28] and as
[1:26:28] jesus said if i if i be lifted up from
[1:26:31] the earth
[1:26:32] i'll do what i'll draw all men unto you
[1:26:35] is that right the preaching of the cross
[1:26:37] was foolishness to them
[1:26:38] but it was power to the man that is
[1:26:40] saved he said look what he says
[1:26:42] he said their works impersonated was
[1:26:45] made known
[1:26:46] he said now he said they they could not
[1:26:49] cannot take the message now neither
[1:26:52] could james or jamarine
[1:26:54] in one of the quotes brother branham
[1:26:56] said he said you know why some of them
[1:26:57] are leaving and they run
[1:26:59] because they said it's too strict he
[1:27:01] said it's too strict
[1:27:03] he already prophesied and said these
[1:27:05] things it's not
[1:27:06] that what he's doing is making a lady
[1:27:09] out of you if you're struggling
[1:27:11] what he's doing is making a man out of
[1:27:13] you if you're struggling
[1:27:14] that's what he's doing he's bringing you
[1:27:16] into the image of christ again is that
[1:27:18] right
[1:27:19] hallelujah he says the works of
[1:27:22] of imitation uh impersonation
[1:27:26] was made known because they could not be
[1:27:28] able to follow
[1:27:29] god's word vindicated by his anointed
[1:27:32] prophet
[1:27:33] they cannot follow israel why why
[1:27:36] couldn't they follow you
[1:27:38] why sister you're here because god
[1:27:40] brought you here
[1:27:41] you thank god you're in the right place
[1:27:43] you understand what we're saying
[1:27:45] is that right even though those cervices
[1:27:47] look at that woman
[1:27:48] she brought them to jesus is that right
[1:27:50] that ill-famed woman is that right
[1:27:52] they wanted to stone her the baptist
[1:27:54] that right because they said she
[1:27:56] committed adultery or committed a crime
[1:27:58] whatever it was
[1:27:59] but they brought them to jesus and jesus
[1:28:01] didn't know by the law
[1:28:03] they didn't even have the witness is
[1:28:04] that right where's the witness is that
[1:28:06] right
[1:28:07] but they were so carnal minded they were
[1:28:09] so devilish minded
[1:28:11] they was she was bringing them to
[1:28:13] salvation
[1:28:14] she was bringing them to salvation and
[1:28:16] they missed it but she got her
[1:28:18] deliverance she got hurt
[1:28:20] they brought her hair there but through
[1:28:22] her life she was bringing them there
[1:28:24] she caught it and they missed it and
[1:28:27] they were supposed to be the religious
[1:28:28] one
[1:28:29] is that right hallelujah help me lord
[1:28:32] he said now look they might do all kinds
[1:28:35] of false impersonations things
[1:28:37] that don't do it to do nothing but
[1:28:40] magnify
[1:28:40] the right he says anything any believing
[1:28:44] child knows that the truth
[1:28:46] he says in plain view the works of their
[1:28:49] folly is going to be made known if your
[1:28:52] works is the true word and vindicated
[1:28:54] it says by it by your faith
[1:28:58] it will manifest and the promise of god
[1:29:01] in the original written word says
[1:29:04] it if i if i do it not
[1:29:07] jesus said if i do or not then believe
[1:29:09] me not that's john 10 37.
[1:29:11] he said that now look at this here
[1:29:14] he says if i don't do the works he said
[1:29:18] that's it if i don't do the works the
[1:29:21] scriptures
[1:29:22] tell you i will do them do in my age
[1:29:26] see we're getting the message for this
[1:29:29] age
[1:29:30] it's not the pentecostal denomination
[1:29:34] it's the pentecostal experience
[1:29:37] that god we're now performing in there
[1:29:39] now
[1:29:40] we're going to show you so when he first
[1:29:42] came
[1:29:43] he got the healing is that right he had
[1:29:46] the prophecies is that right
[1:29:48] and now that was the what is the opening
[1:29:50] of the word of the third paul
[1:29:52] is that right but if we move beyond that
[1:29:55] it's now the opening of the mysteries it
[1:29:58] have
[1:29:59] nothing just brother steve it can't be
[1:30:01] brother steve
[1:30:02] opening that it had to be another move
[1:30:06] the next move had to be the opening of
[1:30:09] the mysteries
[1:30:12] i'ma read it to you in a minute
[1:30:17] he said look hallelujah help me lord
[1:30:21] finish with that one look what paul had
[1:30:24] to fight
[1:30:25] the religious devils let's turn to acts
[1:30:27] uh 29
[1:30:29] i mean i'm sorry you know that's romans
[1:30:30] 2.
[1:30:32] romans chapter 2. and we'll look in
[1:30:35] there we'll show you
[1:30:36] these demon forces that paul even in his
[1:30:40] time
[1:30:41] he he had to fight this the romans
[1:30:44] let me see for the sake of time um look
[1:30:48] at verse 28 and 29
[1:30:49] romans 2 28 and 29
[1:30:53] it says for he is not a jew which is
[1:30:57] one outwardly neither is that
[1:31:00] circumcised which is outwardly
[1:31:02] in the flesh now paul now had to come up
[1:31:06] against this religious doctrine
[1:31:08] this religious teachings paul had to
[1:31:11] come up and get it
[1:31:12] you see so you have to realize what
[1:31:14] people will do
[1:31:16] they'll come and they'll try to get you
[1:31:17] to bite on the word
[1:31:19] hear what i'm saying they're trying to
[1:31:20] get you to fight over
[1:31:22] and then if you do see now is an open
[1:31:25] door but
[1:31:26] immediately you got you got a
[1:31:27] discernment that's in there
[1:31:29] that's why when he say they take up us
[1:31:31] the council
[1:31:32] jesus said what take no thought for what
[1:31:35] you say
[1:31:36] i will put the words in your mouth our
[1:31:39] heart
[1:31:39] our mind is to steadfast on christ on
[1:31:42] the word of god of all time
[1:31:44] we're pure clinking he's thinking he
[1:31:47] said if there's any virtue in this
[1:31:49] think on what what's holy what's pure
[1:31:52] what's honest what's just
[1:31:53] what's righteous think on these things
[1:31:55] is that right
[1:31:56] he's trying to keep your heart in your
[1:31:58] mind clear he said take no thought
[1:32:00] is that right for tomorrow he was
[1:32:02] telling the first thing the devil's
[1:32:04] going to do what
[1:32:05] obsession he tries to come to your mind
[1:32:08] obsession with the wrong thought and
[1:32:11] then if you bite on it
[1:32:12] it's oppression then he'll oppress you
[1:32:15] with that thought
[1:32:17] is that right and when he oppresses you
[1:32:19] with that thought
[1:32:20] and then after he oppresses you with it
[1:32:22] he'll get you to possess
[1:32:24] it is that right eventually that you do
[1:32:26] that's what eve i mean that's what um
[1:32:28] the serpent did with eve is that right
[1:32:30] she had no business even listening to
[1:32:32] god already gave her the word is that
[1:32:34] right so we have to understand
[1:32:36] god started from the beginning it was
[1:32:39] from the beginning
[1:32:40] it was never supposed to be a group it
[1:32:43] was never supposed to be a group
[1:32:45] when they took the word and say the same
[1:32:47] thing you can only say the same thing by
[1:32:50] revelation if brother steve got
[1:32:52] situations here in this
[1:32:54] group if we have a situation he can't
[1:32:56] handle the way
[1:32:57] maybe brother josh handle his situation
[1:33:00] well maybe another brother had
[1:33:02] his situation you see we under the same
[1:33:04] word
[1:33:05] situation but you got to sit down and
[1:33:07] you got to talk to someone
[1:33:09] that's why in the world even the police
[1:33:11] will say what's the motive
[1:33:12] let's find out the motive first you got
[1:33:15] some people can be wrong in that
[1:33:16] doctrine
[1:33:18] and write in their spirit and you could
[1:33:20] be right writing your doctrine
[1:33:22] but wrong in your spirit i'd rather be
[1:33:24] right in my spirit
[1:33:26] at all times you see because your spirit
[1:33:29] is right you can work with it is that
[1:33:30] right
[1:33:31] so we have to understand you are not
[1:33:33] under the
[1:33:34] leviticus law and that's the teachings
[1:33:37] that was hiding
[1:33:38] in this message you got the leviticus
[1:33:41] law of the sons of the prophets and of
[1:33:43] the sons of god
[1:33:44] of the message of malachi 4 luke 17
[1:33:48] 30 revelations 10 7 these are the sons
[1:33:51] of god
[1:33:52] they know as the holy spirit said sunday
[1:33:54] they know they're on the way
[1:33:57] a melchizedek is that right the veil has
[1:34:00] been ripped off
[1:34:01] he's now did what in this message now
[1:34:04] they didn't know it the holy ghost came
[1:34:07] and told them you got a pastor
[1:34:09] we already have all of all christ and
[1:34:11] god is what
[1:34:13] one is that right you got christ and god
[1:34:15] is one
[1:34:16] at the christ in god and then you got
[1:34:18] the message of the age
[1:34:20] william marion branham is that right
[1:34:23] you gotta talk to a brother from iran
[1:34:25] the other day brother how you doing fine
[1:34:27] brothers you're fine i said
[1:34:28] oh where's your country what country are
[1:34:31] you from he said iran i said oh
[1:34:33] oh what are you muslim he said oh yeah
[1:34:36] muslim i said good
[1:34:37] i said i'm christian i'm a christian i
[1:34:39] said
[1:34:40] mohammed your prophet he said yeah he
[1:34:43] said
[1:34:43] he said you know my prophet prophetess
[1:34:45] he said yes jesus i said no
[1:34:47] we are marrying bran and he said
[1:34:52] i said william marian branham
[1:34:55] malachi 4 luke 17 30.
[1:34:59] revelation 10 1-7 now know he going i
[1:35:01] know it's shaking him up
[1:35:03] because they think jesus is the prophet
[1:35:05] i said no no no no
[1:35:06] jesus was the son of god and he was god
[1:35:09] he was son of god and he was god my
[1:35:11] brother he was god manifested in the
[1:35:14] flesh
[1:35:14] so you like to get out of there this is
[1:35:16] what i'm telling you doctrines
[1:35:19] doctrines got people bind up but god has
[1:35:22] brought us into a liberty
[1:35:23] is that right where the spirit of the
[1:35:25] lord is there's
[1:35:26] liberty so that's why now he's coming
[1:35:29] he's bringing us this word
[1:35:31] bring william branham is the what the
[1:35:32] pastor to the age
[1:35:34] is that right he has the what brother
[1:35:37] steve
[1:35:37] he has the bullet he had the bullet to
[1:35:40] grant somebody grace is that right
[1:35:43] when he got around in there when he knew
[1:35:45] that somebody was in a tough situation
[1:35:47] is that right and the developer kept
[1:35:49] pushing him and kept pushing him
[1:35:51] and kept pushing him and he didn't want
[1:35:53] to give him the letter he didn't brother
[1:35:55] brandon didn't want to give him the
[1:35:56] letter
[1:35:57] because he know the letter of the word
[1:35:58] would have killed him the letter of the
[1:36:00] word would have tore him up
[1:36:01] the letter of the word would have
[1:36:02] destroyed him the letter of the word
[1:36:04] would have messed his household up the
[1:36:06] letter of the word
[1:36:07] he says but no let me come back let me
[1:36:10] go
[1:36:10] and find out on this matter first is
[1:36:12] that right he went to the mountain is
[1:36:15] that right
[1:36:16] he went and met god is that right he had
[1:36:18] a witness at the bottom of the mountain
[1:36:20] is that right
[1:36:21] then the fight that was going up and
[1:36:23] down and up
[1:36:24] and down and the angel of the lord was
[1:36:27] coming from the top and was
[1:36:28] bringing him the answer down there is
[1:36:30] that right he came back down with the
[1:36:32] answer
[1:36:33] and he told him is that right he said
[1:36:35] well man
[1:36:36] god had given me grace son brother
[1:36:38] stevie pulled a bullet out he said what
[1:36:41] be on your way and do what sin no more
[1:36:44] is that right
[1:36:45] teach your children's children the right
[1:36:48] way now
[1:36:49] look at grace is that right oh god
[1:36:53] the will of god will never lead you
[1:36:56] where the grace of god can't get you out
[1:36:59] of it
[1:37:00] hallelujah we're talking about it now
[1:37:03] you understand what god is doing for us
[1:37:05] in his hour here now
[1:37:06] we with months we claim we're all born
[1:37:09] in sin
[1:37:10] shaped in iniquity coming the world
[1:37:12] speaking not
[1:37:13] nobody can condemn no one no one can
[1:37:16] tell no one now
[1:37:17] is we're only saved by the grace of god
[1:37:20] and we only hear
[1:37:21] because of his predestination is that
[1:37:23] right so we have to realize then what
[1:37:26] the pastor of the local assembly is that
[1:37:29] right
[1:37:29] he can get grace for you is that right
[1:37:32] so that's why you have situations call
[1:37:35] the pastor
[1:37:36] let him talk to you he's the one that
[1:37:39] can get you grace
[1:37:40] in certain situations that not a deacon
[1:37:43] can
[1:37:44] or other minister can but him if you're
[1:37:46] in that local assembly
[1:37:48] he can go to god and in your household
[1:37:51] fathers get straight and if you're
[1:37:53] struggling
[1:37:54] straighten up huh you got to get
[1:37:56] straight in your household
[1:37:58] you realize that i should tell my wife
[1:38:00] that i said oh no
[1:38:02] no no i said something right
[1:38:05] in my house i'm the blame
[1:38:09] i'm the blame
[1:38:12] i tell my family members don't mean my
[1:38:14] wife you know your family like blame
[1:38:16] your wife sometimes and stuff
[1:38:18] because things are no no no no no no no
[1:38:20] me i say no
[1:38:21] no okay that's why god put it in a
[1:38:24] vocabulary that's why you put it in a
[1:38:26] dictionary
[1:38:26] sometimes it has to be used no okay
[1:38:30] so you have to realize that i don't have
[1:38:32] to explain it to you
[1:38:34] he's giving me that authority i don't
[1:38:36] have to explain it to you
[1:38:37] is that right so you have to understand
[1:38:40] you see
[1:38:40] so my god my god so we have to
[1:38:43] understand
[1:38:44] and it's that we're here now that what
[1:38:46] you've called to is that right
[1:38:48] so we have to realize that you're there
[1:38:50] men
[1:38:52] rise up come at me if you've got to lay
[1:38:55] in the guard
[1:38:56] all night i wasn't going to say no but
[1:38:59] i'll tell you after now
[1:39:01] i didn't know what god had and i've been
[1:39:04] up for two days
[1:39:06] i and i am not tired i know he was
[1:39:09] giving me the strength and y'all prayers
[1:39:12] and my wife to tell you as a witness i
[1:39:14] didn't know what was going on
[1:39:16] sometimes you just got to wait you got
[1:39:18] to wait
[1:39:19] you got the weight you have to pray you
[1:39:22] got to wait
[1:39:23] you have to pray you have to wait
[1:39:28] because these religious demons i'm
[1:39:29] telling you they're no good
[1:39:31] they got people bound up got people
[1:39:34] locked down with these religious demons
[1:39:36] that's why brother branham
[1:39:37] even jesus says
[1:39:40] he said to be so close and deceive the
[1:39:42] very elect
[1:39:43] if it was possible i seen then locked
[1:39:47] down locked down i know a man wouldn't
[1:39:49] even go and get a job
[1:39:52] for his family he needed a job
[1:39:56] he said it was the center day of venice
[1:39:59] and he couldn't work from friday
[1:40:00] midnight i think up until sunday or
[1:40:02] something like that
[1:40:04] it wouldn't take a job for his feed his
[1:40:07] family
[1:40:08] religion we don't have religion we got
[1:40:13] salvation
[1:40:14] it's the difference let me keep going i
[1:40:17] want to read this
[1:40:18] my time done went off let me read this
[1:40:21] and let me read this here i want to
[1:40:22] i want to read this here paul look what
[1:40:24] paul told him
[1:40:26] 28 29 i'ma speed it up now he says now
[1:40:29] look he says for
[1:40:30] he is not a jew within an outwardly
[1:40:32] neither is that a circumcision
[1:40:33] which is outwardly is the flesh but he
[1:40:35] is a jew which is one of what
[1:40:37] circumcision is that of of the what of
[1:40:40] the heart
[1:40:41] and in the what spirit and not in the
[1:40:44] what
[1:40:45] letter whose praises is not of what men
[1:40:48] but of who
[1:40:48] but of god that's why he said verse 3 he
[1:40:51] wanted them in
[1:40:52] eden he only put him outside of
[1:40:56] eating the labor because what he did
[1:41:00] when pharaoh told him when moses went to
[1:41:03] them
[1:41:04] he said pharaoh let my people go
[1:41:07] so that they can worship me
[1:41:12] he said i had no one to tilt
[1:41:15] the ground i had no he was what
[1:41:19] elohim he was not even god yet
[1:41:22] over in genesis 1 he didn't become god
[1:41:26] until genesis 2 then he had somebody
[1:41:29] to worship him
[1:41:35] go look at it go back and look in there
[1:41:37] oh brush these the lord don't open the
[1:41:39] can of worms there
[1:41:40] that tilt is too fold that tilt is to
[1:41:44] worship
[1:41:46] that's why he said he always wanted to
[1:41:48] deal with the heart
[1:41:49] that's why i was looking at you brother
[1:41:51] steve when you went there i said my god
[1:41:53] my god
[1:41:54] he always wanted to deal with the heart
[1:41:57] a true worship is from the heart
[1:41:59] you say you love me with your lips but
[1:42:02] your heart is far
[1:42:03] from me don't tell me this ministry
[1:42:08] this ministry ain't open some things up
[1:42:11] hallelujah let me look at let me read
[1:42:13] this one more god help me
[1:42:15] i want you to see this one here thank
[1:42:18] you jesus
[1:42:19] the spirit of doctrines of religion we
[1:42:22] didn't even touch the surface of it i
[1:42:24] tell you so much
[1:42:26] he said now look in here
[1:42:29] god help me here it is thank you jesus
[1:42:35] he said now brother brannon was working
[1:42:39] with anointed ones at the end time
[1:42:42] 7 25 65. he says in james and jamaris
[1:42:47] matthew 24 false crisis
[1:42:49] false anointed during the doing signs
[1:42:52] and wonders
[1:42:53] to deceive the elected
[1:42:56] remember god was letting them do that
[1:43:00] he was letting them do that in the ages
[1:43:02] because
[1:43:04] he wanted them to think they had
[1:43:07] just as much as we had
[1:43:11] [Music]
[1:43:15] he's blinding them let them be
[1:43:18] [Music]
[1:43:20] their fathers don't ran out it's not
[1:43:23] already run out
[1:43:24] let me finish reading i'll show you has
[1:43:27] nothing to ministry that we're sitting
[1:43:28] up under
[1:43:29] this folly their folly has already ran
[1:43:32] they're shaking now
[1:43:37] he said look he said now as james and
[1:43:39] jamery would stood moses
[1:43:41] reprobated mine concerning the faith he
[1:43:44] said not a faith
[1:43:45] the faith you can have one faith without
[1:43:47] believing in the lord
[1:43:48] you can't have two baptisms no one
[1:43:51] father or son and holy ghost
[1:43:53] there's one baptism jesus christ he says
[1:43:55] notice compare them together
[1:43:57] when you when you get home matthew 24 24
[1:44:00] jesus speaking paul is speaking the same
[1:44:03] thing second timothy three and eight
[1:44:05] he said many many others he says now
[1:44:08] compare that and put put on another
[1:44:11] scripture
[1:44:12] he said look luke 17 30. malachi
[1:44:15] 4. he's moving into something brother
[1:44:17] brandon was moving into something he was
[1:44:19] showing him something
[1:44:20] he says that james and jameerine which
[1:44:22] stood moses
[1:44:23] and anointed the anointed word of the
[1:44:26] hour so will these men not man
[1:44:30] see men when moses threw his rod down
[1:44:34] the anointed vessel that day
[1:44:36] god was showing him showing pharaoh
[1:44:39] brother raleigh
[1:44:40] showing them sorcery showing them

[1:45:12] the hour so when these men men anointed
[1:45:16] once
[1:45:17] resists the truth and every day that the

[1:45:44] he said now look he said where's the
[1:45:46] life going now
[1:45:48] away from the organization no more shock
[1:45:50] grain
[1:45:51] a rebuke to the pentecost to full
[1:45:54] fulfill the scripture of this hour see
[1:45:57] notice
[1:45:58] very day this messenger when he starts
[1:46:02] on but when he begins to declare
[1:46:06] his message that's what they couldn't
[1:46:10] handle
[1:46:13] not the healing not just the prophecies
[1:46:17] but when the message started
[1:46:20] that's why they scattered if they didn't
[1:46:24] that's why they didn't leave egypt they
[1:46:27] couldn't leave it because they couldn't
[1:46:29] withstand
[1:46:30] what god has bringing now bringing us
[1:46:33] into
[1:46:34] he's bringing us into the character of
[1:46:36] christ
[1:46:37] he's bringing us to where you'll be able
[1:46:40] to handle the word
[1:46:41] with meekness with gladness with
[1:46:43] humility
[1:46:45] you can look at him and truly love him
[1:46:48] and pray for him
[1:46:49] that's what we're moving into he said
[1:46:51] look at this here
[1:46:52] he said now but when when it declares
[1:46:56] his message the first pull was healing
[1:46:59] the second pull was prophecy the third
[1:47:02] point of opening of the word
[1:47:04] the what the mysteries revealed is what
[1:47:08] we're getting now
[1:47:11] there's no more higher order to reveal
[1:47:15] than the word than the prophets he said
[1:47:17] but the only way the prophet can be a
[1:47:19] vindicated is by the words
[1:47:21] the third pull was the opening the third
[1:47:24] pull was the opening of them seven seals
[1:47:28] look what it was for brother steve and
[1:47:30] now i see why you think
[1:47:32] it became a new book
[1:47:36] to reveal the hidden truths that's been
[1:47:39] sealed in the word
[1:47:43] that's where we're at and everyone is
[1:47:46] not receiving it because it's not for
[1:47:48] everyone he says the first
[1:47:51] he said now i'm going to show you three
[1:47:54] things
[1:47:55] i had them fulfills three things that
[1:47:58] laid
[1:47:59] you right there he says first he's going
[1:48:02] to show
[1:48:03] the world is in a sodom condition
[1:48:07] jesus said it would happen look at the
[1:48:09] perversion
[1:48:10] he says our women trying to act like men
[1:48:13] are men
[1:48:13] trying to act like women cystified
[1:48:15] rotten filthy low down devil
[1:48:17] possessed and don't know it see blind
[1:48:20] miserable wretched naked
[1:48:21] and rich and saving good and don't even
[1:48:23] realize god have mercy lord
[1:48:26] lord have mercy on their souls he says
[1:48:29] in
[1:48:30] and he said the bible says that that
[1:48:32] would happen he said that's
[1:48:34] where it's at he said secondly it's that
[1:48:37] the hour according to the scripture
[1:48:40] here that james and jamarines appear
[1:48:43] see he's bringing to us signs
[1:48:46] letting us know where we're at
[1:48:49] he's not you remember this is 65
[1:48:53] he says 30 is that the same hour that
[1:48:55] the son of man is to be revealed
[1:48:57] there is there is your believer you're
[1:49:00] me see he said there's your believer
[1:49:03] you're a make-believer and you're a
[1:49:05] non-believer

[1:49:11] this was after the seals when he now
[1:49:14] knew
[1:49:16] the things was being made known in this
[1:49:19] hour
