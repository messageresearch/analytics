don't have any prayer requests or praise reports i just have a testimony or two here yes ma'am yes ma'am i want to give god praise and i want to say it's indeed a blessing to be back in the house of the lord there were times when i felt like lord would i make it through but he brought me through he put all the doctors in place that needed to give me what i needed and you know god is a great god you know sometimes we ask for prayer and we expect to be he right away but then he allow somebody to be there because maybe they may not be able to accept the message but the prophet said just a cup of water in jesus name can give somebody eternal life and i really thank god for that because my doctor my primary care doctor said to me he said you had vip treatment because with all the underlying issues that you battle and for you to be looking like this because we did a video conference call he said miss falbe you are blessed and i want to give god all the honor and glory and praise [Applause] [Applause] amen hallelujah god is so good now before i got yes ma'am you go ahead do you give me one second because we got young charles here we got one um i was talking to brother uh caleb a while ago and uh i guess i guess it was a you could just consider it a misdiagnosis correct so yeah so what he went through when he was in boot camp was misdiagnosed so it was something that needed attention but had he not been in that situation it would have been an extremely high medical bill for him as a civilian so he was in long enough for this thing to be detected even though it wasn't what they said it was but what they did detect they treated for nothing and he's completely taken care of amen hallelujah glory see we can't try to figure out how god wants to work amen i'm gonna let you i'm gonna let your grandmama go first okay amen amen um i was having to talk with the devil because um they said our thoughts are not ours you know come from one place or the other and i was in the bed and i couldn't get up i had a bad migraine the feeling was nausea the whole nine yards and um i said i'm not going to go to church and then he said and then i said he said well if he was going to work you would get up and go to work right and then i laid down i said well i said i don't know if i can do this you know all this noise and stuff and i said no then i said no i said i would i would not go to work because i've done it before with my migraine and so then i lay there a little while struggling you know to see whether i'm gonna get up and go to church so it's about 10 o'clock i got up i said no let me get up and go to church i'm gonna go anyway and so i start getting dressed and everything and i want to be late because i usually be here a little earlier and the devil said the devil started talking to me again he says well um you're going to go there and you're going to be sick and you can't you're not going to get anything out of service anyway i said no you're not i said you lied devil because i'm going to go there and i have my holy ghost guilt-filled pastor pray for me i said and that that's gonna be all right and then he says to me says oh you don't have enough enough faith to do that i said oh yes i do i said watch me i said i had enough faith i said if i don't they do i said so i'm gonna go there anyway he's gonna pray for me and i'm gonna be all right so i come into church and says okay well the pastor's not here so now what i said i got a lot of holy ghost still people in here he said he said that he said no you said the pastor i said that's okay so i went back there my daughter said well let's take a you know go get an aspirin or something so i went back there to practice standing there i said no i said now he's gonna pray for me now more so he prayed for me so he prayed for me and slowly and slowly my headaches started going away going away going away and so i started praising the lord i said i'm gonna praise him anyway i said so you can stay there all you want devil i said you can come and praise me too with me i said cause i'm gonna praise the lord so i started praising and praising and singing even louder thank you for that brother because it helped me out and then my headache just went away it just went away amen glory glory to god amen good morning um i wanted to give a testimony to how good god hasn't been in my life so far i've you know sometimes you know i say you don't feel worthy for certain things so okay so a while ago you know he's been preaching like how you should carry yourself and how you should you know live your life and stuff so so i wanted to uh confess my sins to my parents and to everybody and but satan just kept saying you know you're not good enough yet you know you you ain't doing enough so i said i'll i'll say it in front of everybody so i know that when you come and say that i didn't confess right you know that means that i did confess right because how much you're fighting me shows me how much how scared you are of me because there's no way that you can keep you can keep fighting my mind and keep telling me that i'm not good enough because i did these things and that that you know i'm not a child of god because there's so many times to where i've been told that the reason why you feel this way is because you are a son of god you know because a sinner wouldn't feel anything so what i wanted to say is that a while ago years ago i fornicated and i had problems with pornography and i knew i was wrong i didn't feel good about it at all i felt very bad and i prayed about it and it got delivered me from it but and i told my parents and i felt so bad about it because for years i didn't say anything because i felt so bad about it so i told my parents because i thought because i said i'm not telling nobody this i'm not until the day i die i'm not saying nothing but as i had a wake-up call when um he preached a service on the prophecy and i said hey made me want to wake up man you know you can't you know you want to go to hell i said no so i said i'm going to confess my sins you know in front of everybody so you know saying can't say nothing to me so i i'm saying it now and the funny thing um the service wednesday service before last wednesday service um i prayed and there was this thing i always used to do i used to always pray as if i'm praying for the for the church this is a funny game i think i would do and i will always tell god you know because he said guys will recognize your faith and he'll show you he recognizes your faith and i always say when you recognize my faith when you show that i'm ready have me pray for the church and at that time i was so happy i didn't realize what he was doing so i prayed for the church and then after the service i realized what happened and i was so happy i was like man you know i didn't realize what we did and i was just so happy so and then he said disconnect yourself from everybody you know everybody from the world and that's what i did and then that same service the night i i told my friend i said i can't can't talk to you you know i just don't feel right i just felt so bad i didn't know why and then the same service that same night he said it he said you know you got to disconnect yourself and i just took that as a confirmation saying you're you're doing right you're in the right path you're in the line of duty right now so keep going you know don't don't get scared you know so don't don't get discouraged so i kept going and this is just you know so good you know i i don't have the words for that's wonderful that's wonderful amen amen praise god praise god praise god hallelujah a contagious christian brother michael amen that's wonderful that's why i love seeing god working especially in the young people does anybody else have anything as far as a maybe a praise report i have one prayer request here and we're going to ask brother polly carp jr to come up front and we're going to pray over him it's his birthday he says he wants god to bless him and protect him for the days to come he says i'm thankful for his grace upon me to allow me to live another year so i would just suggest a couple of brothers to come up and just pray with it pray with him and and i'll be here too we can pray for him over his birthday brother kalima maybe brother charles brother lamont and let's pray over our brother here brother robert you want to come up amen amen amen lay hands on him and just bless him for his birthday precious heavenly father as we hear the testimony from our young brother just break our hearts lord amen that you are still in the business of saving souls lord truly the young man has understood if the heat the devil had him he would have not been determining him the way he does that shows that he is no longer part of the dark world and that he has been has seen the light oh god may you continue to bless him and we have surrounded this other young man here father that you have allowed to see another another moon oh god another year we pray for him father as we lay our hands upon him may it not be our hands but may it be yours through ours lord we are the body of christ lord god you know the desires of this young man's heart father otherwise he would not be asking for prayer father god this morning may you take them all god

bringing forth not him but you o god bless us this morning father as we gather together in the name of jesus christ continue o father god to bless the service take the tithe and offering in jesus christ's name we pray amen hallelujah i wanted to give a quick testimony myself this morning if i'll try not to make it lengthy y'all could be seated just for just for one second this brother brother um brother steven touched on um on tithing last week and i got a testimony about that when we when we first came to the message and moved back to charlotte we were still very young message christians and uh some of y'all are familiar where we went to church at the time i won't i won't say the pastor's name he's gone now he's passed on but he came to my house and sat down and uh and went through uh you know went through a few scriptures concerning tithes when i got out of the air force i drove a truck over the road for a little while and my checks were coming to the house barely 250 dollars a week you were always a week behind having to pay for scales and you know going through toll bridges and stuff so the checks were very skinny when they reached the house and we had we were either we were still pregnant i think with rebecca at the time but we were struggling new house and you know our logical thinking was we can't pay ties we got to pay these bills and he came over and and i quit the job i quit the truck driving job and was kind of in limbo waiting on a job to get back with me i just knew i wasn't wanting to go over the road anymore so my last check after his talk he came over and had a talk and we said okay so my last check that um came to the house i think it was roughly four five hundred dollars or something and that particular check we paid fifty dollars for we just gave him fifty dollars and paid our ten percent well it wasn't a week later i was waiting for this company to call me to get a job and uh we got a we got a letter in the mail we got it we just i think it was from a state farmer somebody on my mind i can't remember last week much less that long ago but we received in that period of time that week that i wasn't working two payments that came to our house for oh we overpaid apparently with state farm and maybe an insurance you know a car payment or something and two went to my mom's house and we were on the phone with her we were opening one of them and then one went to my mom's house and we were just looked at each other and smiled and said will you open that for us and it was another check from something else that went to her house well total was about 450 dollars i mean that was a paycheck just from things that just they just came in i mean something even as simple as i took a class when i was at shaw air force base and had a pel grant and i had a little bit of money left over well they sent me a check for that i wasn't expecting any of it well since then i mean we may have eaten a few cans of beans and some rice you know but we paid our tithes and for a while we paid it on net what i was actually bringing home and depositing and then when we get our tax money like brother steven said we would pay tithes on the taxes and then we just said you know what it just didn't feel right still just didn't feel like we were completely honoring god and so i don't know how long it's been we pay on gross and that's the first thing that comes out and and he's taking care of us and you know i mean i know one day we may come to a point where we have to speak we might have to speak those beans and rice into a i'm gonna speak a steak okay i'm not gonna ask for no b when it comes to that point i'm gonna ask for a steak okay and i know it'll be the best steak i ever eat but he's able he's promised us these things i knew a man who made a million dollars twice in his life and he died in a low-rent apartment on welfare as an old man because he didn't i always figured he didn't pay ties i mean i can that's kind of an assumption but that kind of thing can happen hypothetically i guess with god we just we just want to honor him we want to do what the bible says and that's you know that's the first thing you learn in this message that the word is the truth you have to forsake your own belief let's go ahead and stand you have to forsake any doctrinal ideas that were ingrained in you and forsake them and just understand the word is the only thing in this entire universe that's the truth there's nothing else and we use king james i mean that's you know we actually use scofield you know that's kind of what the prophet used so we want to stick to it just just like he did so let's sing only believe and we'll invite our pastor up i was hoping that you know if there was anybody that was struggling with what he said last week with the tithing that hopefully you know it's real it was for our for our family it's real honor god with the tithe he don't need it but that's a commandment we have to obey the obedience is greater than the sacrifice amen he will take care of yes ma'am i'll be really quick i wasn't going to say it my husband said after before service are you going to give your testimony no but brother john just said something and he's talking years ago and i believe pastor preaches with everything he has in him and this is something that happened this week sunday pastor preached about tithes and offerings we called we reevaluated our tithing offerings we had been doing it right we followed his leadership we were obedient now you may not know church but my husband wasn't working in the summer he got sick i got furloughed or laid off in my job so finances were tight we had blessings come in and you know we were bouncing back but they were still slow following the obedience of what god sent through our pastor as of thursday we were waiting we had sent applications in for certain financial things and as a friday morning we've been checking all week to see the status of certain things it wasn't supposed to be deposited or sent until march four days from sending in the application it was approved and in our bank accounts so i say that to say trust him be obedient and fully consecrate because myself my family we are witnesses of what god can do if you just believe like all doubt out just believe this is a walking talking testimony of no doubt full consecration amen amen oh lady lee [Music] oh believe all things are possible all [Music] leave me believe all things are possible [Music] only believe lord i believe lord that i believe hallelujah lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe lord i believe [Music] lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe one more time jesus is here jesus is here amen [Music] is he all things are possible jesus is in [Music] jesus is here [Music] cheers are possible jesus said amen let's give the lord a club offering this morning [Applause] hallelujah musician thank you for the service believe i got couples announcement yeah yep by god's grace just stand a little bit with me and we're gonna get there amen yeah we will have our church work day this coming saturday i believe the text was sent it gave you the time when it started and we end we didn't send the time so brother david please if we can do it and we can send the time so saturday this coming saturday we got stuff when we purchased the building there is a lot of stuff in the building those that have been there already seen it so if you are thinking about taking something maybe a table maybe whatever is there that you want to take you have up to saturday get your own truck go there take whatever you want to take except the two organ and stuff like that whatever you want to get get it out you can take it it's for free amen once we hit saturday the only opening will be for you to bring your truck and to get it if you don't get it whatever is going to be left in the building will be completely out amen so if you want it talk to the trustees talk to the uh deacon they can work it out with you you go there pick up whatever you want to take it's for free praise the name of the lord we just want to evacuate the building and make sure once the con the contractor start working everything is clear there is nothing on their way everybody clear so you want to get something it's for free by saturday it is gone so don't blame me amen i gave up to this sunday for some of the people that says no i believe there were like five people that says no to their vote i don't want to call anybody i give the opening if you have a legitimate reason why you say no you have a scriptural reason you should have called me up to today if you don't call me i didn't receive any phone call nobody expressed anything so these votes are sealed completely sealed remain silent until next year amen so you just join with the crew don't fight anybody because we gave the opportunity to express yourself you didn't say anything you kept silence so that was it amen you have any complaint it's already over i gave you over a week to come and talk to me it's still you wait till next week uh next year if the lord terry then you can say your no and i will open up a door again and talk to you if you want to talk to me and you say brother stephen we saw so and so in and then we can come back and talk to that person and get him off the office amen but if you don't have anything it's just you feel led to say no as your own uh liberty we appreciate that but the majority will win according to the word everybody clear so these officers are sailed until next year amen praise the name of the lord now i promise to you to give you this scripture about tithing [Laughter] amen i'm gonna clean up the devil wherever he is wipe everything and it's for your own benefit amen praise the name of the lord so those who take time to pay tithing here it is exodus chapter 22 verse 29 thus shall not water so when you get your paycheck don't get longer to give your tithing amen don't get a month to give your tithing once you get your direct deposit catch your tithing catch your offering go give it to the church amen praise the name of the lord that shall not delay to offer the water which is your tithing the first of that rap fruit and of that liquor the firstborn of the son shall that give unto who not to the pastor you're giving unto the lord so when you bring in your tag take the pastor off of your mind amen bring it because it's the commandment of the lord don't put me there proverb 3 verse 9 and 10 honor the lord with that water and with the of all damn increase why do you have to do that so shall that bond be filled with water and that prayer and thy presence shall bastard with what so you want to get a blessing it's simple follow god's law if you're behind from last year i spare you from the other year amen if you behind get the tiding come and correct your life with the lord amen cleaning up your life is not only about uncleanness or lying or cheating amen when you don't pay tired you are stealing god's money the bible says you are robbing god clean up your life correct everything and you will see the windows of heaven open and the lord will bless you i'm not going to pull back i'm not going to change i'm just going to give you the word as pure as it is amen because that's what is going to heal you everybody clear so let's go to our scripture this morning ezekiel chapter 16. we read it last week some of you didn't know now you know better so don't do it again amen don't do it again if a minister come to this church and begin to preach until an offering everybody should be saying amen in other words nobody is behind amen nobody is behind when you say pay your tithe the whole church amen not pay your tax then something is wrong amen then something is wrong we already explain detail everything ezekiel chapter 16. in this church you bring your bible let me help you up you know i like to see you bring water can you say amen i want i like to see you bring your water to the church there is something about it that i just love to do what to carry what your cell phone you can carry it it's not your bible amen anybody can carry the cell phone almost everybody have the cell phone but when somebody look at the cell phone they cannot identify you whether you're a christian or not i was thinking of my colored brother sitting here that is the pastor of that fine group of singers a colored brother down in the south one time they say he was what dude he was doing water carrying a bible not carrying a cell phone carrying a bible and he could not even do what read one word how can you carry a bible you can't even read it and you know how to read the bible and the bible become a burden for you no i don't want to bring that big bible like that i just have my cell phone the bible is a burden for you you carry your bag it's not a burden hallelujah amen and he could not even read one word and they ask him say why are you carrying this bible he says i'm carrying him because i do what that is a water brother branham said carrying the bible is a good sign so bring your bible to church we want to go with electronic and pick up god in our electronics ezekiel chapter 16. brother stephen why do you use slaad it just popped to me i don't know if it's online or here i'm just putting that so you can see i'm using a board jesus christ one day you're gonna learn the holy spirit and you'll be careful what you're doing in church amen don't think you're fooling anybody people that have the holy spirit see things different than you see then you think ezekiel chapter 4 for as for your nativity the day you were born in the day you were born your navel was not cut up something is wrong there neither was not cut neither were you washed with water to suffer you you were not salted at all no swaddle at all you might be seated so right here this is where we start last week when we were dealing with what we are dealing now we showed you that there is couple steps here according to the stages orders of the circle of life this child is born at the birth of this child this child was not taken care of appropriately this child was not washed because he was born in mess and spiritually speaking david explained to us last week that we are born in sin shaping iniquity coming to the word speaking lies then the lord comes at the birth verse five no i pity you to do any of these to you to have compassion upon you but you were cast out in the open field to the lofting of your person in the day that you were born and when i passed by this is god coming at birth when i passed by you and saw you what polluted because you are born in sin automatically you coming in a mess everybody clear but we expect when god comes that way we expect god to come pick you up and clean you up but if you notice the lord never clean up that child anybody clear because the year of accountability you remember last week is still covering for that child if that baby died the baby goes straight to heaven because of the blood of jesus christ anybody clear so the lord never done anything else but one thing just spoke life and that's it but left the baby in a state of pollution everybody clear that's why your children your little one can tell lied to you and they keep telling lie you whip them tomorrow they tell lie you whip them tomorrow the teller yet they're under the blood of the lamb anybody clear why didn't god clean them up when they were born at the opening of the seventh seal the bible become a new book the more i speak this you will begin to understand that more and more in other words with the message of brother branham the bible is completely a different book hallelujah and i saw you polluted in your own blood i said to you when you were in your blood physical blood the polluted blood that came from from daddy with all the genetics and everything i will get into the genetic later and then you're going to see how you can get in trouble with your genetics amen your blood leave yeah i said to you when you were in your blood leave that polluted blood god just spoke life and you continue everybody clear verse seven i have caused you to multiply as the bad of the field and you have increased and what's in great and you are come to excellent ornament in other words you became the most beautiful of the jew god let you grow god let you blossom and everything no problem everybody clear your breasts are fashioned now this is not a baby anymore because the baby doesn't have that development everybody clear he said your breasts are fashioned the breasts were there but they were not fashioned in other words this child is a woman and this child begin to develop under puberty now everybody clear so puberty is a very critical age because as we are grown as we come in this world we usually go like a mountain i want you to follow me carefully when you are we go like a pyramid keep this in mind maybe for the next three services everybody clear when you are born you are right here you are a baby anybody clear then you grow up then you meet this the the second station your second stage is our stage it's called adolescent anybody clear or puberty that's where that woman is anybody clear then you go all the way to the peak then you reach adulthood anybody clear once you reach adulthood you begin to go down anybody clear and then the next station that you reach is called the station where we deal with menopause don't worry i'm going to get in the message anybody clear when you pass that menopause you go back to the old ages everybody clear if you notice my chart menopause is opposite of puberty just keep that in mind okay just keep that in mind you will see what happened here and you will see what happened right here anybody clear and if you look at my chart you will see that babyhood is opposite of this one everybody here in other words you start like a baby you get into the trouble of puberty then you get stable a little bit then you go back to the trouble that are like puberty then you drop down and you begin to act like a baby again and somebody need to take care of you again somebody was taking care of you here here somebody have to change your diaper again because you are in a nursing home you are like a baby don't worry hallelujah let's go to verse seven keep that chart it's like a pyramid pyramid in the message is it's our language he said your breasts are fashioned so this child is right here into puberty sex characteristic are fashion and your hair is grown the hair is not the hair of the head because that child was growing with hair right here this is what they call mature hair the hair you have in your bird here your armpit and your prophet i'm gonna speak plain yeah democrats are playing i'm playing amen so we can fight correctly everybody clear your hair are grown so this child is completely inadolescent whereas you were what naked and bare if you notice despite the fact that the lord came right here the lord left this child naked amen because in the garden of eden when adam and eve were created they were created naked and the lord left them naked so this child is still under innocency and then that's why a baby can walk naked and they don't even care amen because their innocency is shattered everybody clear but when adolescents come that now the lord comes back again in other words young people this is the best time and the best opportunity for you to receive the holy ghost anybody clear if you miss this opportunity you're going to be fighting to get the holy ghost here amen when you reach adolescence if you just open your heart the lord is ready to give you the holy ghost hallelujah you need to understand the timing of god you miss this you get in trouble amen then it's going to be a hard time before you get converted blessed be the name of the lord yeah hallelujah i wish i have you four hours here then i can infuse you like they are infusing for coronavirus amen let's go to verse eight now when i pass by you and i look upon you behold your time was the time of what why is it the time of love because the breast has fashion and the sex characteristic have exposed in other words you can get pregnant young sister did you hear me that's what it means amen and i spread my skirt over you why he didn't spread the skirt when he was a baby why amen he want to claim you for marriage now amen you gotta be married with him first before you marry your husband do you hear me before you get married here on the earth make sure you get married with jesus christ first when you get married with christ then he's going to help you find your mate i have a scripture for that you want it you ask me i will send it to you the lord will direct you for your choice i have a scripture for that hallelujah and cover your water your nakedness why is god covering

need to wear makeup why did it happen in puberty why amen why did it happen in puberty that you want to make yourself clean why so god want to make you clean somebody else want to also fashion you in a different way and the fight is going on daniel chapter three if you dare you can say amen verse 16 shadrach a young man misha a young man and abednego answered and said to the king oh naboo can answer we are not careful to answer you in this matter if it be so our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace amen the test here was a burning fiery furnace amen if you don't bow down to the god of babylon amen you're going to go through the fire are you following me are you following me amen hallelujah verse 18 but if not be known to you o king that we will not serve who your gods nor worship the golden image which you have set up this was the law permitting sin are you following me the law of the land permits you to do certain things amen but these young people stealed and they say our law of god is contrary to the law of america [Music] amen they didn't say everybody else is doing it everybody else is bowing down they said no we refuse to bow down amen verse 19 that was nebuchadnezzar full of fury and the form of his visage was changed against shadrach meshach and abednego therefore he spoke and commanded that they should heat up the furnace one seven times more than he was then he was won't want to be heated in other words take that furnace hit it seven times anybody so because you take a stand for god the devil want to amplify your situation more than even anybody else but he reached the seventh number which is the number of god amen young people stand for the word stand for the message amen verse 20. and he commanded the most what mighty men that were in his army to burn shadrach there's two things here number one he want to bind them everybody clear he want to bind them shadrach meshach and abednego and to do what cast them into water burning fiery furnace this experience here that you're gonna be cast down is burning it's burning like what like fire keep that in mind amen do you know paul said that it is good to marry them to do what let me repeat it again paul said it is good to marry them to do it okay now you see my burning everybody clear let's go to verse then these men were bound in their coats their housing and their hat and their other garment and were cast in the midst of what they're burning fiery furnace everybody clear therefore because the king's commandment was urgent and the furnace exceedingly hot the what the flame of the fire slew those men that took up shadrach meshach and abed nego so everybody here is subject to fire are you following me everybody here but when they pick up shadrach meshach and abednego when they threw them in the fire the effect of that fire burned the people that carried them let me ask you a question was shadrach meshach abednego different people than the one that were killing them they were all human every human you put him in the fire he can burn amen that fire burned the babylonian but it doesn't burn the children of god that took a stand for the world [Applause] amen when you living adolescent here there is a burning war zone do you follow me this fire burned a lot of people and it's still burning people they can't come out of it how do you cross that fire anybody clear hallelujah jump to verse 20 uh 24 amen and these three men 23 shadrach meshach and abednego fell down water bound under the law the law put you in prison everybody clear the law put you in prison and they throw you in the fire amen you are thrown in the fire when the message feel like it's legalist oh mama said don't do this don't do this don't do this we feel like we are in the prison that's how they put you in the fire hallelujah verse 24 then nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished and rose up in haste and spoke and said to his counselor did we cut stream did not weaken three men bound in the midst of the fire they answered and said to the king she walking what is going on verse 25 he answer and say lo i see what for what the fire took off the band everybody here and lose the boy in the midst of the fire the fire that just killed somebody it seems like it is not doing anything to you yet you are human yet it's burning but your heat is taken off so you can cross that wall zone do you understand what i'm saying young people to cross this war zone you need somebody to get the heat off somebody to let off the pressure [Music] amen city of refuge and he answered and said no i see four men loose doing what they were not loose and standing like this they were free they keep walking everybody here they keep climbing here amen some right here wreck they get drunk go to the highway they can't hit them that's dead right here right here right here somebody go right here go to the prostitute to house contracted heads in the hospital dead right here but you are working you are walking on campus amen never see you working with a woman amen praise the name of the lord i see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no what the fire doesn't burn them anybody clear but the fire is there do you follow me it is there they are in the midst of it but it's just not burning them hallelujah and the form of the fourth is like the water everybody here so the only person that can help you cross the fiery experience the son of god that's why he comes at puberty put me on your ship let me cross with you when i hit jordan do you know what elisha was only following elijah when they hit jordan it was not the responsibility of elisha elijah who was the leader pick up the mantle struck jordan separate jordan elijah elisha keep walking just keep following you need somebody to help you cross everybody clear verse 26 then nebuchadnezzar came near the world of the world i thought the man that brought the other one gabon amen do you follow me when they pick up shadrach meshach abednego when they took them to the fire fairness he burned the other people but when the fourth man entered even now buchanan can come closer and it doesn't burn him you become a blessing to somebody else the people that get closer to you begin also to benefit from your presence amen and spock and said shadrach meshach abbe nego you servant of the most high come forth and come here then shadrach meshach and abednego came forth off the midst of the water verse 27 and the prince's governor and captain and king's counselor being gathered together saw this man upon whose body not soul body body where the black dog is whose body the what fire has no what there is a way that black dog can be taken care of amen before the rapture anybody clear no power nor was a water a hair of the head singed neither were there what changed the same power that preserved the coat of israel in the desert was there preserving not only their body their hair and even their clothing you will see later that paul i believe peter said you'd say do not touch the clothing that has been spotted with uncleanness go to jude you're going to see that anybody clear not the water smell of the water they can't even smell it from you people look at you what kind of world do you live in what kind of people are you are you human yes i'm human are you alive yes i'm alive so how come we never seen you talking to a woman there is somebody that took the heat off amen somebody took the heat off no the smell of fire has passed on them everybody clear let's go to first thessalonians then we can pray a message has already been preached there first thessalonians chapter 4 if you dare you can say amen hallelujah let me see if i can hurry up so we take off verse three everybody there for this is what the will of god even your what sanctification holiness we are preparing you to the second banquet anybody clear that you should abstain from what fornication job to verse 7 for god has not called us to water but what everybody clear open your bible on first corinthians chapter 7 and then we pray this is deep and i'm going to touch maybe the two first verse and then we will continue down the road on the other everybody clear let's pray now heavenly father lord we thank you again father for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you're doing for us father we are committing this service unto the hand may you come and move me again completely out of the way may you speak to your children you know the needs of this congregation those that need something attached in a body something in their finances something lord father in a certain area of their lives lord we pray that you touch them may the holy spirit only be sealed in here may every single demonic spirit or viruses or whatever the devil want to bring in this place may be completely sealed out of this place father we committed all in the name of jesus christ amen everybody ready all right let's go now we are on uh all right we are on king ahazar is three fists and esther to banquet part 18 everybody clear last week we got on this this slide here and we explained using the example of the fractional distillation now here we are dealing with somebody who's already been converted on the inside the white dog is there which is the top of the holy spirit that help you fight the battle everybody clear and on the outside which is still the other man the flesh we still have the black dog that we're handling with we found out that according to brother branham that there are different four different candle loves we have agape love which we explained to you last week we have fill your love we have a lustful love and we also have filth love i hope everybody was there last week if you miss it you already catch up everybody clear now when you look at the two lust love which is the lustful love and the filthy love when you drop into this category automatically you are living under sin anybody clear if you are committing fornication you are a sinner and you are living on the scene everybody clear if you are committing adultery you are living on the scene everybody clear if you're watching pornography automatically you are living on the scene so whatever is under with these two kind of love automatically if you are living you are doing any of these things you need to clean up your life amen you need to repent and correct everything that you did ever clear so far now the problem that we have when you look at agape love a gap below have no interaction with sex you have no interaction with glenn but once you drop down to feel your love there is an introduction of sex all the way down but the difference is now what over there in philio love we have sex which include lust but when you drop down on the third uh category of love we still see sex there and lust also there so brother stephen do you mean that when we get married we are entering into this zone when you are get when you married correctly you are not dropping down into that zone everybody following me and i'm gonna explain that correctly now what is the difference the act is still the same act you follow me if you're sleeping you need to wake up what you do in marriage and what you do in a hotel under fornication if you are not married or under adultery if you are married you are doing the same thing the difference is which state are you when you're doing what you're doing anybody following me if you are married lawfully there's nothing wrong with it but if you are not married you're gonna fall under fornication or if you are married and you go out you are falling under adultery everybody clear let's go to first corinthians chapter one uh seven chapter one and first one now concerning the things whereof you wrote to me it is good for a man not to do whatever that touch is not touching like this anybody clear go check your translation the correct clear translation means that it is not good for a man to have sexual relationship with a woman can you say amen if you notice there paul didn't say that it is not good for a husband do you follow me watch your scripture paul did not say it is not good for a husband to have sexual relationship with a wife no paul said it is not good for a man is no statute here everybody here and a what and a woman this woman can be anything everybody here but when you get to husband and wife husband is still a man but it's a man under covenant wife is still a woman but it's a woman under covenant everybody here now concerning the things were off you wrote to me it is good for a man not a husband not to have sexual relationship with a woman not a wife in other words young people you have no right to have any sexual relationship as you are can you say amen i want to hear the young people saying amen that's law can you say amen [Applause] whether you like it or not i'm going to shoot that devil everybody clear verse two nevertheless to avoid what do you see that because there is no covenant anybody clear to avoid fornication the pure way to say it is to avoid sexual relationship before marriage do you understand me you go to your doctor and i'm preaching to this church anybody clear nevertheless to avoid fornication let everyone have his own what do you see now the bible didn't say let every man have his own woman that is boyfriend and girlfriend we don't believe it here amen if you are burning and you wanna quench that burn let every man have his own word in other words get married that woman is no more a woman but she become a wife and that wife is not a wife for many people it is your own it is only for one person there is no way a married woman should have a relationship with men except her husband do you follow me you cannot have a man at work that you get closer to him when you argue with your husband you go to work and you get a little bit sad because that man is so sweet he's sweeter than your husband and you want and you are doing that so that he can ask you what's wrong and you say no no no no everything is good i don't want to talk about it it's a long story then he goes come on come on come on tell me and then you get ah this marriage my husband my husband that man is not your uncle he's not your father-in-law he's not your family member he's not your deacon he's not your pastor what kind of relationship do you have that you have got to explain to him what happened in your marriage stupidity of people amen no married woman should be in contact with any man on facebook no married woman should be in contact with any man on social media nobody but your husband no married woman should be in the ride with another man i have a coat nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man the same goes with the man the same goes with a man you have somebody at work that can go to mcdonough and she even have the gut to say do you want me to get something for you and you say yes and you gave her the money and she buys stuff for you and she called you on the cell phone what else did you say no add chocolate i had a pie she became your wife amen she became your wife amen every time she goes to lunch she go buy lunch and bring it to you why make your own lunch at home oh take your own car go to mcdonald yourself amen no married man should have a close relationship with a woman except a hound wife sister you see that woman chase her away or call me give me a call i will come on the rescue [Applause] oh my god he doesn't call you the woman call your husband and he and and she knows you are married texting your husband at 10 pm block that number erase it from the cell phone delete it or pick up the number and say you know what she is a mirror he's a married woman please don't call him anymore play too much amen nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own water and let every woman have her own water we don't have to share husband we don't share wives you want to go to the second banquet that heyman has been quiet so long this is how you're gonna find yourself in front of god with an adultery spirit but you never actually committed the act amen because you are acting like an adulterer and when they talk to you no no no no i don't have any relationship with we just friend we talk she cook for you she comes home she come at work she said you know what i was cooking some cake i thought about you get it and you want to play over that cursed cake do you eat do you do you understand me i call it a curse cake what about if she put something there what about if you put something there lord bless bless this adultery cake let's go to proverbs chapter 5 chase him away you there wow this time is flying you there verse five uh proverbs 15. if you dare you can say amen drink water from your water that water is not the water i have here this is not the water i have here you're going to see what what kind of water is that one drink water from what drink water from somebody else's system your own system you must own that system for you to drink water you're going to see the water don't worry in this church the bible and the brother brother the bible and brad brown anybody clear and what running water that water is not segmented it's a running water meaning that system or that world is clean the woman is clean do you follow me okay drink water out of your own system if you stop there brother and preach broken system you will think that it's a stagnant order but the scripture gives you more clarification that it's a running water in other words this woman is clean she's a clean lovely wife amen out of your own what not somebody else's world your own wife your own husband job 16. lest your fountain be dispersed be dispersed abroad and reverse of water in the street that let if you look at a different translation and say why are your phantom dispersed abroad do you follow me why are your river of water in the street why are you taking your seed outside of your home do you understand me why are you going outside of your wife let me continue to read you want to see it yourself everybody here verse 17 let them be only your what he only belong to one person do you follow me and note what in other words we don't share spouses i cannot tolerate adultery everybody clear verse 18 let your water be what god is putting blessing on that fountain what is that fountain amen let the fountain be blessed and water in water can you look at your bible i want you to look at your bible and rejoice in what god is giving you permission if it's in your wife go ahead and rejoice do you follow me but don't go outside don't commit fornication you want to do it catch your own husband amen and rejoice with the wife of what the youth now you see who that fountain is job to verse 19 let her be as a loving and pleasant rule let her breathe satisfy you all the times and be you rubbish always with water you under a covenant everybody here jump to verse 20 and why will you my son be what with what in other words why are you going outside my son why will you my son be ravished with strange woman and what embrace the bosom of what because it's not your own it becomes stranger it becomes outside verse 21 for the ways of a man of men are before what and he pondered all his work everything that you're doing at work everything that you're doing on facebook everything you're doing on the whatsapp everything you're doing on instagram on first time on whatever you're doing god is watching everything you're doing god is watching all your friends you have on facebook god is checking all of that you might be camouflaging things but the holy spirit is zooming everything out everybody clear so far so now we understand here that you can be riding a marriage and you are covered but when you get out of a marriage you fall into the other category amen but even though you enter into marriage and you are permitted that remember the black dog is still there everybody can follow me the black dog and the white dog all both of them have different or different direction they push do you remember the black dog wanna push you back to sin and the white dog has a mission to push you back to full redemption everybody clear so as you look at this uh chart here the black dog direction is to push you that you fall under lustful of or he wants you to fall on the filth amen how do you fall on the field if you look on lustful love you found out that over there you have adultery and you have pornography if you are married because once you merit the word fornication is out amen it is now changed into adultery what you did before marriage if you do that in the marriage it's still the same thing but the terminology changed from fornication to adultery everybody here so when you're on the covenant you are the black dog now is working to push you with adultery all with pornography do you follow me you need to clean up our marriages amen he's also working on dirty sex activity he knows that god has granted you permission god have given you a green light like go ahead and do it so now he's trying to get in what god gave you and perverted inside your marriage amen he understands that you tough enough you don't want to go through adultery so now he said okay i can't get him in adultery let me get into his marriage and pollute him there do you understand what i'm saying hallelujah let me get this hebrew 13 verse 4 marriage is water honourable in water and the bad water if you notice now the bed paul is speaking about the bed he said the bed is on the fire why is paul talking about the bed amen why didn't paul say the cooking is undefiled are you following me why didn't paul say the cleaning of the house is undefiled are you there paul targeted one thing he said there is one thing when you are in marriage even though you are a sad even though you have been granted permission be careful not to defend yourself in the marriage [Applause] do you follow me you are defiling yourself but what warmonger and what adultery everybody feel follow me but that bread might be defiled without adultery that's right amen can you say amen don't worry i'm going to help you brother branham all right that is just for what dirty living instead of a man a boy girl or something or another when they are going together and they know that they should be married go ahead and get what if you feel like you need to be married go ahead and do what don't be engaged for three years do you want me to explain to you don't be engaged for four years except that person is away from you do you follow me if that person is closer to you do the best that you can and get married everybody care if he is in africa you in the united states no problem he's away from you amen when you say i love you he's i love you he have to cross the ocean no problem amen but when you see one another like this there is a black dog an attraction you are playing with fire don't take long get married continue your project in marriage you want to have a phd you want to be a doctor like your pastor don't get somebody else sister and you say you're gonna be i'm gonna be uh engaged to you but i have to be a doctor like brother stephen so she's gonna stay six years eight years waiting for you watching you all the way until you graduate get married take her to the campus do you follow me do you follow me why because you are playing with fire the longer you take the more the devil is watching your tactic you don't want to be brought here to ask forgiveness and i'm warning you don't take long time relationship if you don't have a job stop go find the job amen before adam was married god gave him a job before jacob got married to to to russia he have to work seven years you die ready for job yet you can't pay even your cell phone stop bothering women do you follow me stop wasting your time do you follow me stop bothering women because you're not ready yet leave it alone go find your job go find your phd and everything amen praise the name of the lord come get married i think you understand what i mean don't you don't just leave a what a dirty little life there because it's not what you see that is what in one sense if they do that to your sister would you like it would you like it why are you doing that to somebody else children no heart where if you are a christian now it is the word it's the world dog eat dog you know they're over there boyfriend girlfriend they do whatever we do we are not in the world we are in church amen but this girl that you are going with that is your sister too that will be what the mother of your children that will come don't leave a water daddy life around here show that you are a what a real christian gentlemen live like a christian gentleman or two see and treat her like your water and when you get married do it continue to treat her like a sister i thought we are married i thought we were married treat him any kind away huh a pastoral message am i answering this right now and don't believe in fulfilling me among pentecostal people holiness people can you read this with me even if they are what how i taught brother stephen you say when you married you are permitted but i just show you a scripture paul say the bed and the fire everybody so you can be in marriage and you are living unclean hallelujah i don't believe in filthy living among pentecostal people holiness people even if they are what what is going on brother branham i don't believe in that no sir some of this water that is so what brother branham have a difficulty explaining even that because you drop in your marriage under dirty sex activities especially those that are getting married nowadays amen we didn't know what to do so we have to go look it up we have to check pornography to get prepared did abraham have a pornography book did joseph have a pornography book did daniel have a pornography book how did they get married and get children who gave them the book back there glory i met the minister out there why on what brother branham is checking the minister he's talking to them that whoop the door open i feel like i could turn them over my knee and give them a little gospel protest plasma stimulation brother branham is talking to minister and when he's talking to minister the discernment broke and brother branham begin to see what the minister is doing in his bedroom and brother brother got upset he said i wish i can take that minister and slap him why is brother branham one a sloppy minister yes sir my to see what a man that would try to take his water he didn't say he lit a woman this is under covenant try to take his little wife and water in a marriage and water in the marriage you understand what i mean i think you ought to be ashamed of yourself as a man of god you just be a what be a sweetheart do what respect hell like you always respect her don't pay attention to these some of this work amen you can be in marriage watching pornography you can be in marriage a bunch of books like this on your shelf living unclean clean that mess out of your house amen stop the netflix channel out of your house don't pay attention to these sexy books oh there's no sense in this world your marriage is not a training ground of pornography playing with your wife the mother of your children and things like you read about all of this stuff and everything like that get that what feel free stuff out of your mind remove it from your mind you see young people when you poke yourself with pornography what you're putting in your mind and this is what you're going to take in your marriage you ask her what is going on it's my husband i like it my husband won me with tight dresses you tell a woman why do you dress like this no my husband didn't say anything because he was lasting after women of pornography he wants you to look like that so he can quench the black dog amen and you doing that to please a man and you and him who got to hell no the bible says not let one water dirty conversation husband and wife come among you when you profess what don't treat that lady that little lady like she's your little sweetheart if she's 60 years old you just be the same do you know at

one another in your with your family what and so forth like that let's just be as what and what and what agree with among you and everything as it can be done for water and water and be what and what in the marriage understand talk to your wife if you are or if you if you have if one nature is on you and another nature isn't her talk with her you try to do the same thing sister understand one another be real christian gentlemen real christian ladies and brothers and sisters with one another always remember you are what in other words even though you have been permitted remember you are christian and you are from a water you are a royal blood there is no better blood in the world than yours and that is a royal blood show itself that is what it is it's royal all believe that say show what you are here i am a son of a king i am a son of d king my wife is the daughter of the king how would that treat that king's daughter in your marriage have you treated her like a prostitute like the woman you seen on pornography shame on you how would you treat that king son see what i mean be real water but if you are married correctly and you let the white dog lead you amen and not be influenced by the black dog to push you toward lustful or toward filthy sex activity this is what is going to happen to you what is happening to you let me drop this atomic bomb are you ready if a man take to himself a wife a woman and she become his wife covenant and they live together as water and why for 50 years they have been having relationship for 50 years they are just as what should that continue should that continue they are just as what and what and what as if they never knew one another do you see now when you are married you respect yourself you leave christian when god look at you you are still virgin [Applause] let me continue that is god's program but for that man or woman to go and live with another man or woman that perverts making uh illegitimate children born but if they live together in doubt perfect harmony that is god's way but satan comes around in the marriage and put what the black dog again he's not going to leave you because you got married young people when you get married he's after you in the marriage are you there because he's still living with you amen he put lasting a man of the woman and they leave what contrary to those marriage vow and that is what it is the very same sexual affair but it's what because you took it outside the covenant everybody here another one and then we move on now what is perfection perversion here you all look like adult mostly listen to this we are married people and you married men and you married women can live together as what and then women are just the same as the naval way do you follow me as long as you stay under god's program in the eyes of god it seems like no no no husband no man have ever touched you are you there they are water yet you marriage you have children but when god look at you even if you have 20 children god see you virgin why because you under his program then the blood covers you they are virgin as long as you stay with your water as long as you stay with your husband covered that's why a normal married woman that respect herself when she get around you you're gonna be before you talk to her you will see you begin to watch your word because she have like uh like an atmosphere that she's portraying you can see that this is a mother yes ma'am what can i can we do with you there is something you are pushing when you're walking you're walking with it they can sense it but if you lose when you're walking you will see they can sense you somebody else will look oh i'm sorry i'm sorry ma'am you you person hey what's going on but why did this why didn't he say what's going on to the one that just passed because that one is giving a different atmosphere amen of of purity of holiness amen now that is legal and lawful it's all right it is ordained of god to do so another woman can do the same act of your wife one of them you are righteous in the sight of god if you stay in his program and the same act to another woman you are what condemned before god that is what death because you follow the black dog everybody here now the black dog pushes downward in marriage he wants you to go through lust and he wants you to go through filth and the white dog even though you are permitted in the marriage to live as husband and wife he's pushing also you up until he's going to get you to a state where you hit a guppy when you get a guppy he takes the sex and the gland off of you then they give you a change of the body and no more to deliver under sex anymore everybody there that's why when they when they when the sadducees came to jesus they said we have a question they thought they want to call it jesus they say there was a man who got married to ignorance to a woman and he died and his brother gathered and died and the other guy up to the seven now when we go to heaven who's going to be the wife jesus said you don't understand when we got there what you've been dealing with here we don't deal with it over there because it's a gap in love it is a higher love the black the white dog is pushing you higher but here on the covenant you want the permission to do what you're doing but that permission be careful the black dog is still there do you follow me now as we move into where we started now in this circle here oh my god all right in this circle here we showed you that when you are born all the way to adolescence you reach a point where the black dog is there they don't clean you up the lord let you there in a mess but he's blocking the black dog everybody clear now when you reach puberty adolescence this is where we are when you try to enter the zone there are the words on we found out that over there what is going on with this age brother brown i'm speaking about billy paul i'm just going to rephrase this read it again brother branham say he is just in this adolescentage the what dangerous time of life i desire all of you to do what to pray for my boy because adolescent is deadly deadly why they are turning you loose they are turning you on and then you alive be careful it's deadly everybody clear deadly because your hormones begin to shoot up and when your armor begin to shoot up your body begin to change based on your hormone and that is gonna be the opposite in menopause because in menopause the hormones shut up then the dumping you are living under is gone your body goes under depression i'm gonna explain to you with quotes everybody here because the woman with an issue blood was suffering because of menopause that's what brother brother say that that there was menopause that was causing the issue of blood i can give you 10 coats anybody clear don't worry we're going to get there so in puberty adolescent your sex characteristic happened we found in ezekiel the two stages everybody there so now in puberty that final love came off because the scripture said that the time of love have happened that love is not agape it is your that pop-up the the the protection that was there is broken when it's broken the black dog is releasing brother branham says this i don't care how saintly a man is as long as he's human he cannot take the other sex in his home armed and female without having water that's why we don't believe in poison gas hugging because if you are normal when you touch a woman it's going to cause something that's right amen i don't care you tell me that i tell you you are telling a story in other words you're telling a lie and if you are a red-blooded man you're alive if you are really a man it's that way you can't help it you are human i don't say you're doing anything wrong but that sensation is just there the same in other words the same way you can hold your wife if you hurt another woman automatically you're gonna say something anybody clear praise the name of the lord then we found here in adolescent the black dog is released and the holy ghost also is coming to help you up for the battle when the black dog is released he brings a spirit on you and that spirit will begin to start blocking you from getting into covenant with god everybody follow me brother branham say the only thing that kept me from being saved when i was what 12 years old because what why didn't that spirit hang on brother branham when he was two years older amen that spirit waved at 12 and that spirit is there so there is the black dog the white dog both of them are coming they're just telling you this one is attracting you this one is attracting you amen and then because we are like adam and eve we have been given the free moral agency in other words god put you like in eden you choose what you want to do if you choose the wrong you're going to suffer if you choose joshua he's going to help you anybody there because because a spirit hung over me a devil saying what wait a little longer in other words he wants you to wait that wait doesn't mean your year don't grow your years continue to go but he wants you to wait on the things of god in other words enjoy a little bit here you're too young enjoy here when you get here you're going to be quiet and you can get married that's a lie many married people are continuing to chase women they thought they already enjoyed it's over now oh my god that's the reason you was not safe when you became the age of what accountability a spirit you got in a crowd and that over over you and keep hanging over you you wanted to do right there is not a man that has got his right mind but what wants to do right but there is something won't let him right that is what the black dog is released everybody clear he was a 12 years old and if you look on luke 2 you'll find that jesus when he was born do you follow me from the birth of jesus you follow me all the way here they never gave us his story have you noticed that do you know when they start giving us the story of jesus go to look to the message and the bible perfectly aligned like this take a look chapter two and you're gonna see when did they start brother branham say 12. what is stephen i want to see that in the description i want to see that in scripture everybody here luke 2 look 2 verse 40. if you dare you can say amen page is still turning you there verse 40 and the child do what jesus was a child here everybody following me and jesus is growing we're clear remember the woman in ezekiel and the child grew and watched what strong in the spirit you see what i'm saying remember the woman in ezekiel also was growing everybody filled with what wisdom and the grace of god was upon him now his parents went to jerusalem every year of the feast of the passover and when he was what that's when the bible began to talk about him the bible talked about his breath about the the the measures about the the shepherd about herod and afterwards the bible keep quiet and begin to talk about john the baptist in other words close here john the baptist was baptizing people oh jesus is 12. no more john the baptist jesus said 12. why did the bible stop and go back at 12. the message in the bible like this everyday and when therefore verse 42 and when he was what 12 years old they went up to jerusalem after the custom of the feast they were going to church doing religious work the regions were met at 12 something happened to jesus why didn't jesus talk to the priest when he was seven why didn't he talk to the priest when he was six why he started talking when he was 12 accountability everybody there verse 43 and when they had fulfilled the days and they returned they wanted you are not responsible yet you are still a child amen developing having a deep voice knowing how to drive a car don't make you mature you are still a child that's why when you commit fornication under your parent house you need to go repent to them like the young brother ouch yeah you're going to go tell mama what you did you're going to tell daddy what you need are you there they charge jesus terry behind in jerusalem and joseph and his mother knew not of him but they supposing him to have been in water they thought jesus was just hanging around in the restaurant with the young people at 12 years old they thought jesus was just hanging with the young people let's go shoot let's go do this let's go do this that's what they thought but jesus at 12 years begin to change his direction differently he begin to get focused to the father's business they thought oh he always played with his friend his uh his company he begin to leave the crowd at 12 years old he begin to separate from his friend he begin to change his direction young people it's time to cut those friend off amen it's time to start changing friendship amen and they've thought they supposed him to have been in company went a day's journey and they sought him among the what the king folks and who the people that know him no probably he's hanging around with brothers so and so is he there no he's not there so where is this boy again what is that boy he's telling let's go verse 45 and when they found him not they turned back again to jerusalem doing water seeking him and he came to pass after three days they found him in the nightclub at 12 years old when jesus was lost they found him away they went to get him drunk in in downtown ah they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of water both hearing them and asking them water he began to get more inclined to the things of god asking questions brother stephen what do you think about this what do you think about this what do you think about this what do you think about it do you think jesus was not human do you think he didn't burn yes jesus burn because the bible said he was tempted every way amen are you there a prostituted woman was washing his feet what do you feel what your savior was feeling what do you think what do you think and he started like this and he keep talking and they say wait a minute that's why the pharisees say if he knew who is doing that why he didn't discern they didn't know that he knows how to take the fire off in other words when the woman come he turned off are you there when mary does does that and the pharisees say what kind the man is this this is even a professional any mother he didn't know that the one that took the fire off daniel was right there he turned the fire off amen he can turn your fire off he can turn your off and off and no matter how many women will dress wrong and pass in front of you in campus they don't do you anything because somebody turned the oven off if the same spirit that lived in christ before dwelling you it will also because it's a it's a it's a memory immunity jesus when he was doing that the holy ghost was memorizing that immunity when the holy ghost get into you when he touched that virus he remembered that jesus touched it with mary magdalene what was the response antibody lock off [Music] everybody there you are locked completely and people will look like hey wait a minute man you don't see that woman man you say what i don't know what you're talking about you didn't see her no sir are you all right yes i'm all right okay okay thank you thank you no no no no no man this is a strange man who are they amen because somebody turn you off everybody clear everybody here hallelujah let's go now let's go to song of solomon 12 years old don't worry i'm good in time what makes you feel like that is because of the material coming in it is the material coming in song of solomon chapter eight if you dare you can say amen you there let's go to verse uh two i won't lead you and bring you into water my mother's house who would water so right here this woman mother is distracting a woman everybody yeah mama that's your responsibility but you're going to see in another chapter as we keep moving job to verse six set me as what a seal upon your heart as a seal upon your arm for what is strong as what what kind of love is compared to death they say love the strength of this love are you following me the strength of this love is equal to the strength of what this is not agape because agape is higher amen that's why agape can swallow death in victory agape when he gets death he destroys death into his component and and get him off anybody there agape when you put when i give you the letter when i do this that sin that's a problem anybody clear when i when i go to the alphabet and i say i and s this is no problem amen agape break it down amen and bring it back to original and that combination don't exist anymore that's why brother branham said the blood of jesus christ is like a bleach amen the bleach tech color it doesn't make the call of vanish it just break the color down and send it back to its original and that blackness goes away amen so when you take sin you put in the blood of jesus christ you just break that away and then when they look at you they don't see any more everybody there that's a higher love which is a gap in love do you follow me now this strength the strength of this love is the strength of death that's not agape because agape is the law of spirit and the law of the spirit of life is greater than the law of what sin and death that's why the road of moses could swallow the two road and it becomes back another road when you check that road you don't see the other road anymore amen but those roads used to be the musician but when they get sucked into moses road agape dissolved them and when you look at moses road you don't see those roads anymore yet they were swallowing they existed that's the power of the spirit of life that take generous and generous sin death and swallow them up you understand now now let's go down hallelujah set me as a seal upon your heart as a sin upon your arm for love is strong as what and jealousy you see that feel you and genus says what cruel as what grave where is your victory death where is your victory that's speaking about sin we underfeel you everybody clear verse six and then jealousy is cruel as the grave the water thereof are water so this love have caused and those cause are cause of water it's a burning love you follow me now that's why paul said if you burn because it's a burning love it's a love that burns that consumer everybody he said the cause thereof are cause of fire which have what and most vehement what the flame that they put shut down i can measure that [ __ ] in other words when you are in adolescence the love that opened up burden and it's very strong everybody here that's why adolescents go almost like crazy you understand because they're burning somebody shoot hormones and they had no control anybody following me verse seven many waters cannot quench water remember the fountain of water you can go and begin to go after many women trying to quench that thirst it won't quench you you are giving the wrong solution you think by being a woman chaser you're going to control that tomorrow you back again tomorrow you back again because you didn't understand that you have the strength of death it is pulling you all the way till it's going to destroy you anybody there many waters cannot quench love neither can what they flood drawn it you can go in a bed with 10 women tomorrow you go back again in a nightclub hallelujah are you there if i would give all the word substance of his house for lord it will ordinarily be what do you see that so that love is powerful you don't play a game with it and the black dog is getting there now put your seat belt because i'm gonna enter his own are you there brother branham say then they get this little water we are here in adolescent these teenage girls and give them water the first thing brother branham is mentioning there he's mentioning a bad cigarette amen marijuana is just the extreme of it you start with cigarette cigarette some get to cigar and when you get to the extreme you're getting marijuana i'm going to explain you all of this i don't want any game with the devil he said what do they do tell them what a leader want brother branham mentioned the second thing the second thing he's dealing with drink which is talking about beer he's talking about wine he's talking about whiskey you can go all the way to your shots and everything anybody there to go to each place it's got to a place i'm sorry they know that raises what the third thing brother branham is mentioning is about the passion which is in in clear word your sex desire that's right remember your libido everybody clear so brother branham is giving three point here he say they found out that they are giving teenager cigarette they're giving them wine and that those two have an impact on the passion you have an impact on that feeling you love that burner are you following me when you take cigarettes you take cigar you take marijuana you take beer you take wine or whiskey you are actually taking the furnace and you bringing that seven times like nebuchadnezzar you follow me hallelujah they know that raises passion in human life little boys and girls till they become completely what so the more you are putting this into this burning fire you are taking gasoline and you are throwing into the fire he bring you to a state of insanity let me let me handle this hallelujah if you have a problem with time just forgive me everybody there the more they put pressure on this it brings you into insanity in other words you lose your mind amen this is opening door to homosexual amen because your mind don't work anymore you are tired of women and you begin to go through men brother branham said the reason why homosexuals open up because the women become cheap i have a quote ask me i will send it to you you play too much and then you reach a point where you are tired of it you want to do something else then the married one that's why homosexual be among them you will see them with shot and needle and heroin because the normal human mind don't go through that you following me let's go completely there's three points here there is marijuana which we talk about cigarette there is drink which we talk about beer and there is passion over there what's going on brother stephen brother branham follow me very careful i thought i'm going to move forward further than this but i'm going to handle this and we stop and let you digest it everybody clear but i was what adolescent is 12. brother branham is somewhere here seven years old there is a key to seven i will explain that when we get in menopause are you following me all right there you were i was seven years old i was packing water water from a whale and a voice popped to me out of the bush i said well wind in the bush brother karima say don't ever what everybody can you say amen why did the why did the pillar of fire when he came he's telling brother brother he's he's planting those area why he didn't tell brother branham don't cheat in school cheating in school is bad why did he point smoke the angel of the lord he said don't never what or what number two anybody following me young people you follow me in other words my message don't touch beer don't touch cigarettes you're going to end up wrong and if you are already drinking beer in this church you need to stop we need to pray for you and cast that therefore the way if you are smoking cigarettes in this church you need to stop we need to cast that devil away from me do you follow me one two three why did the angel of the lord only point to those three there shall be what to do when you go what brother branham has a ministry of genesis 18 according to genesis 18 god came down and borrowed in human flesh that is not the flesh of jesus christ are you following me so based on that ministry the holy ghost came and told brother branham that because we're going to work with you i have something to fulfill with you the requirement of genesis 18 wants you to stay away from this area hallelujah it is water source in prison and then how i have always knew that was god somewhere as a little boy he spoke to me never what or or what that is to run immorally with what he's explaining that himself because it's sex desire are you following me i had always had the dread of it and was a what a young man why they have to block brother branham from that brother brother and how can we feel and if he can reveal to me by his holy spirit the resurrection crust who come here and give me water can you read it with me a temporary resurrection stop was brother branham dead why does brother branham need a temporary resurrection amen because they are taking him off his body are you with me this is brother branham according to genesis 18 they have to come and do the massage do you follow me so when god comes he need to get the water out and put the water in the air here are you there then god step in here do you follow me but you step in here don't touch cigarettes don't touch being don't even touch a woman sexually why was jesus born virgin why why hallelujah give him a temporary resurrection by my what that's my what god's what and his what do what in other words this one out this one in that's why you heard brother branham say it is not me who was talking to you i have to go listen to the tape know what i was telling you do you see now do you see now i have a tape where brother barnum is prophesying and he's even talking it is his voice it is him talking but he says this is not william my own problem i have a claim temporary resurrection by my spirit that my spirit goes away and his spirit come in if you need quotes like this i have plenty of them i can give you one two three i can give you to come and sit with me i will open up what i have you think it's already one i have one well brother what i'm saying the like i sleep up and he's sleeping excuse me i'm paraphrasing are you there then let you know whether he is alive or not i don't know you that is what me and my borough amen me and what we don't know you but he knows you but he wants to do it you follow me because the body of jesus christ is on the throne if you move that body the rapture pick up so the rapture is not come yet yet god needs to do something and to use that vessel don't smoke don't drink don't touch a woman are you there but he want to borrow my body to prove that he is the resurrected christ i'm so happy to do what that's why you cannot worship brother branham because god was borrowing a body he was not the body of god the body of god is the body of the lord jesus christ when you see jesus christ you can fall down and worship because he is the visible image of the invisible god [Applause] i am so happy to do what to learn to him give it to him anything he can get what and you also you are temple of god and god wants to borrow your body also just like he did by the planet don't smoke don't drink don't play with women hallelujah the devil the devil can you give me time hallelujah the devil putting all that stuff around around who why young kids why young kids they want to take your furnace to seven time harder are you there drinking what what ortels 92 shields in other words if i can interpret it to you bad weather bad light corona heineken pastor how do you know that i used to work in a gas station are you there that's a lie that turns young men and women to what insane insane body-wise wretched to drink that stuff it is who he feels the water the beer when it goes down to a young man it brings you to insanity that's why before they get you young sister they bring you into an art claim they bring you into a bar and they begin to talk to you and they begin to give you a drink and by you sipping on that whiskey you will find yourself that boy begin to take you like a sheep to the slaughter amen amen you won't have power to exist anymore because they intoxicated you because alcohol crossed the brain without permission alcohol doesn't ask your brain permission it's just cross like a police officer and before you know it you're gonna find yourself removing a ship in the hotel you lost your virginity are you there he feels there is still an institution he fills the water [Music] drinking beer he does everything else he breaks up water i'm a married man i need to eat whiskey to stay stronger amen shame on you he calls what because the mind is not correct amen i'm preparing you to the second banquet remember in the second banquet a man fall on the bed of esther do you remember and when the king got there he said do you want a rep you got the second banquet hallelujah he does everything else he breaks up the home he causes rape and murder and everything else and cigarette poison what causes water and the medical association even decent enough to place it out in other words they spoke about it and you continually smoke that devil's water i don't know what i'm saying it for that don't sound like me but i'm going to say it anyway as long as it's coming out like that it is wrong get away from it christian get filled with wood hand riding on the wall why we have poison water with what number one number two with what number three number four with what be right here and what and it is what everybody clear what is going on i want you to notice how daniel yet an alien yet ousted from his people as ousted from his church without one church service without any church to go without any aim to sound but what he sang himself in the midst of all of it he still held on to what what he stuck with the message of the hour amen how old was daniel no such to no church to go to nobody to fellowship with everybody went the hidden to hidden temple everybody worshipped their adult no christian song nobody believed the same thing he did in the 68 years from a what about water why again daniel 12 12 14 years old when he was taken down there he held true to what and understood by jeremiah's prophet brother branham of this day that the days were almost what like the brother says he understood by it if daniel went at 12 years old in babylon him and shadrach abed nego take daniel chapter one i'm going to head to the airport we want you to get married to be respectable young people respectable young lady married with honor and you go live peacefully in your marriage where there is no squench nothing amen this stuff has been lost that's right we want to talk about it in a pulpit we're using different language different language and they don't get it and we blame again the young people while nobody spoke plainly to help them understand yes in other words nobody stoop down to their level and talk to them plainly like sister you are burning right yes i used to burn also this is what i did thank you jesus are you there daniel 1 are you there verse 8 but daniel purpose in what that he will not defile himself with what no with water why do they want to give a 12 years old wine in babylon why they want to give daniel wine and then you're saying no i cannot drink wine why why why i don't want to drink wine amen they say you know what we're going to eat salad and compare to us and the younger people brother branham said the angel of god was coming and god was dropping vitamin in 10 days how can you grow fat in 10 days can i give you food for 10 days i'm ready to pay for it if you're going to grow fat in 10 days but 10 days somebody gained weight

i'm a man i'm a man no you need to be a man when you put your pen down okay i put my pen down you don't find yourself that you are controlled by a woman when young sisters stop those kind of stuff tackling on men you're a coward you a woman telling a man he's a coward do you know what he means do you know what he means what gut do you have to look at a young man and tell him you coward because you want him to show you you're going to be shown in a hotel how coward he is when you go to dss for footsteps are you there let's go to daniel 5. you see women so loud young sisters so loud they get

abednego refused to eat when the king tasted that wine and he crossed his brain look what the one does to a king and look what god responded are you there he tasted the wine commanded to bring the what the golden and silver vessel which his father nebuchadnezzar has taken out of the temple which was in what that wine when the king took it that wine drove the king to the staff of the temple of the living god what can the wine take you to play with church stuff that's why daniel refused it amen that the king and his priest his wife and his concubine might drink therein then they brought the golden vessel that were taken out of the temple of the house of god which was at jerusalem and the king and his princes his wife and his concubine drunk in them they drank water wine and pressed the gods of gold and of silver enough brass of a iron of wooden of stone in the same hour came four fingers of a man hand and wrote opposite the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king palace and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote it and then the king countenance was what the wine got off of him after he already destroyed himself up many many taker offers him god didn't repent they kill him very same night they kill him everybody because of wine destroyed his mind and he lost the gps he didn't know what to take and what not to take hosea 4 verse 11 ward them down here and what right here and what take away the what in other words it makes you lose your intelligence go to genesis 9 i'm going to stop in this slide and we'll pick it up go to genesis 9. we have people in a

delivered for those that are married and those that are not married lord father you know exactly where everybody is struggling where the problems are father this is not to condemn or to get your children straight to hell but this is a mercy that is coming to rescue them removing everything that they've therefore have been plugging in their life in their marriages in their computers in their personal life trying to hold them under the laws of gravity so when you come into the air they're going to be so heavy bound with the staff of this world and won't be able to defy the laws of gravity and meet you in the air lord father you are bringing a message to let them unload lord because you told us in your word that those that are come unto me ye that are heavy laden and many have been hiding with a lot of stuff load some did not know some were just trying to do the best that they can trying to find answer trying to find solution father but now you are providing a way through the word and through the message of the hour father bringing out everything so that your children can come to full understanding of what it is you say that your people should no longer live under confusion father this is a day this is an hour lord father where the light came and to shine and to remove all darkness away from our life father may you help everybody in this church to surrender to what we are preaching whether it is the tithing whether it is the offering whether it is that boyfriend that friend that girlfriend that relationship at work or whatever it is father may they cut that off knowing lord father that mercy have been granted and the door of deliverance has been opened there where they can flee and be completely set free from that which they are suffering lord we are committing them unto the hand may the holy spirit continue to madly minister unfold this word and not only unfold but cutting every benz every shackle every demonic spirit lord that is keeping people away from the church they can go anywhere but the church they can sacrifice the church for anything else lord but they don't want to sacrifice other things for the church lord father we commit them unto the hand help them understand to love you to give you preeminence in everything lord make their life be centered around what pleases you around worthy what belongs to the kingdom around the father's business lord father they get sucked up in doing this doing this doing this and the last thing that come to mind is whether we want to go to church or not whether did we read the bible or not whether did we listen to the message or not and especially we got home we can listen to it later i can sleep i can watch it on youtube father may you shake them where they are father lord jesus christ may you touch even those that are home that come to fund lord some are there for legitimate reason some are sitting drinking coffee and listening to the sermon drinking lord drink and listening to the sermon sitting lord father comfortable maybe on a short maybe with a short skirt maybe with an inappropriate dress and listening to the sermon because they're home now church becomes something that is casual lord may you shake them from this situation and may your mercy extend lord may you deliver them father we commit everything unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you church we love you mercy reroll my life oh mercy reroll my high life i should have fallen my soul cast down but mercy rewrote my let's sing it one more time [Music] oh mercy rerolled my life [Music] yes mercy rerode my highlight i should have fallen my soul cast down but mercy rewrote my life i was sitting back there listening to um what he was preaching here and uh i was thinking about mercy it's kind of twofold this morning god is showing mercy on our young people so that they'll hear this message and never walk that path now it's almost it may be just a couple of days past 30 years for me i was in desert storm 30 years ago right now and it was the february 18th or 19th or something i was out on a post riding with a man we had uh we had some christian music playing you know on a little we didn't have phones back then we just don't even know what we were playing [Music] the humvees certainly didn't have stereos in them but we were reading the bible and i smoked i smoked then and i guess i can probably say i had been smoking since about the age of 12. [Music] and also during that time they rationed it but you could get two beers a day it was just rationing i didn't always get them but occasionally i did lord knows when i was in college and even younger i drank a whole lot more than that [Music] and he's right it'll make you go crazy so the second half of this mercy that i'm talking about was extended to me that day when i was in desert storm because the very not just i didn't just crumble up a pack of cigarettes and throw them away the desire to smoke them left me desire the desire to to drink the alcohol left me my kids have never seen me drunk i used to you know it was genetic for me because i used to see my dad drunk a lot [Music] so i want to emphasize that mercy this morning he's shown us a lot and here we are we're here here in his word and we can amen the mercy in our life i'm very very very grateful for what he's done for me because as this song says i should have been cast down my soul should have i should have fallen and i was i was head strong wanting to go in that direction but i just like he said my life was full of woes it was full of sorrow it was full of contention so this word is true i mean it's nothing but the truth when i was in the middle of all that i had no idea what it said i was raised a methodist but you know it's a baby catholic so i i am beyond grateful the joy of my heart is not it's not expressible for what he did for me i don't want to see any not just my children but anybody here go through that if you're interested in hearing the message that that jesus basically took over brother branham's body and spoke through him it's uh looking to the unseen and it's at the end of that um i don't think it's in the book if you were to read the book i'm not positive about that but i know it is on the it's it's on the recording it's very good you should go back and listen to it if you get a chance we want to thank uh his brother daniel right who's this who's this brother it's hi daniel okay brother daniel and sister harmony for being here today i'm gonna ask brother um come up and dismiss his brother and then [Music] we just uh deeply thank you for the sermon for today we just thank you for the fellowship and just um be together and just fellowship to being one accord just bless us all throughout the rest of the day just to stay in line and increase the white dog and decrease the black dog and continue to do all things in decent lord and spirit of truth and continue to stay focused on our first love and continue to just focus on discernment that you speak to us throughout the day lord and bless us to travel back to our home of dangerous highways in jesus name y'all can be dismissed
