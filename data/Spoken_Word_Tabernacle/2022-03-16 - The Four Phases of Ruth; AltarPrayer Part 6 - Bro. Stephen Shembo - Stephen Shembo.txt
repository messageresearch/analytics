give the lord a clap off hallelujah you really made it despite the rain god richly bless you good to see you there brother mike amen amen amen amen praise the lord you see tracy you too oh okay no problem okay that's a family member in the house amen blessed be the name of the lord so i know it's wednesday so let's tighten up a little bit and move quickly how many are up to date with the sermon okay blessed be the name of the lord this coming sunday at 2 oh saturday at 2 30 we have the young sisters meeting i believe the text is already gone but there was so much pull from the married sister a lot of polling that wanted to be there and when we look and discern their motive they just want to learn amen so that have been said the door is open to any married sister that wanted to be there but kindly remember it is not your meeting that's your past amen kindly remember it is for the young sister it is their question not your question so when you get there remember it is for the young sister you there just to learn amen so don't get into their way that's their time because when they're going to come when it will be a married meeting probably they'll they're not going to have a chance to get there amen somebody is having a trouble if you have an associate degree do you have a bachelor degree if somebody have a bachelor or degree they already have an associate degree right so the one with a bachelor degree can use their associate degree right but the one with associate degree cannot use a bachelor degree because they don't have it did they make sense so the mother can drop down to your meeting not you going there until you graduate that makes sense oh my god what a pressure [Laughter] so that has been covered amen so if you attend you are planning to attend as a merit sister make sure you inform one of the deacon quickly because the head count we have was only for the younger so we know how many are coming so we can boost up a little bit so that kind of quieten the nerves and everything in the church amen you need to thank the deacon let's go straight to our scripture thank you very much musician you thank the deacon i've never seen so much pull like that just pulling why why why but when you deserve the motive behind people are just thirsty and hungry for the world amen they rather sit in that meeting versus staying at home and doing nothing amen blessed be the name of the lord so your prayer has been answered and remember on sunday the building fund i believe i don't know if the trustees remind you but sunday the building fund amen let's go straight to our scripture on uh sunday we skip toward the end i say skip skip skip skip but this is a teaching on the baptism of the holy spirit i cannot skip stuff it is very important so i don't want to leave any screws loose i want to make sure we tighten them pretty tight amen because there's a lot of question over the years so we want to make sure we get everything clear amen blessed be the name of the lord let's go to second chronicle chapter six we wear this on sunday hallelujah ii chronicle chapter 6 verse 10 if you dare you can say amen the bible say the lord therefore has performed you might be seated his word that he has spoken thank you for i am reason up in the room of david my father and i am said on and and i am said i am set on the throne of israel as the lord promised and have built the house for the name of the lord god of israel amen and in it have i put the ark where it is the covenant of the lord that he made with the children of israel and he stood before the altar of the lord you know where we are we are still on the other court and we are dealing with the brazen altar and the lever put together amen so solomon stood on the altar we know that's a brazen altar the brazen altar amen when he stood on the altar at the altar he stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands for solomon had made a brazen scaffold the altar was much bigger but it was a scaffold and this scaffold was made in reference to the brazen altar into the tabernacle amen this is now in the temple amen of five cubit long you remember this when we unfolded the mystery of the brazen altar and five cubit broad and three cubit high a man five five five grace and three cubic yard perfection and head set in the midst of the court so we are still dealing here in the other court if your other court is not good it's going to block everything down the road you remember on sunday amen and upon it he stood and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hand toward heaven you remember on chapter 7 the fire came down exactly like it happened for elijah amen let's go to luke chapter 18. hopefully lord willing if we can get to where i'm trying to go so on sunday we will get on the roof with a calvinist and luther and see if we can place your marriage in the outer court and the marriage in the holy place and the marriage in the holiest luke 18 verse 9. if you're there you can say amen and he spoke this parable you remember this now to certain which trusteth in themselves not in the sacrifice but in themselves amen that they were righteous this righteousness is not the righteousness of god it is their own righteousness on the religion and despise the other two men went up into the temple to pray so the temple amen was not just about sacrifice but the temple was a place of prayer by the robert guided [Laughter] amen the one a pharisee remember an actor and the other a publican so if you look clearly the pharisee is the religious one he looks very good on the outside and the publican you can send him to hell quickly that's a sinner amen you will call him enrique ricata and god taught by brandon be careful under that publican is a predestinated seed amen and the pharisees too the pharisees stood and prayed thus with himself this is the prayer of the pharisee god i thank you that i am not as other men how can you use a temple for something like this amen extortioner which is true the way unjust which is true there adulterer or even as this publican so according to the prayer of the pharisee he portrays himself as a very clean man a very righteous man everybody here but we will see when jesus will decode the pharisee amen verse 12 i fast twice in a week so there is fasting here going how many times hallelujah twice a week i give tasks of all that i possess so i'm fulfilling all the requirement that the law want me to do and the public can standing afar off so somebody have respect this one is not near he's far off he understands that he's a sinner and he has respect amen this one is coming boldly based on his righteousness amen standing far off will not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven but smote upon his breath saying god be merciful to me a sinner this one was a sinner and he understand that he is a sinner and he recognized himself as a sinner in the presence of god the other one see himself as a just man amen verse 14 i tell you this man the republican went down to his house justified so this justification of the publican amen happened where in the tabernacle in the temple it happened at the outer court anybody care so the other court your justification remember and he went down justified rather than the other for everyone that exalt himself shall be abased and he the humble himself shall be exalted humble before what let's go to john chapter 2 and then we'll pray wednesday always take my time hallelujah john 2 verse 13. if you dare you can say amen guy used so much to be turning and i forgot there is a screen right there john 2 13. if you're there you can say amen and the jews passover was at hand and jesus went up to jerusalem where the temple was and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and the changers of money sitting and when he had made a scourge of small of small cord he drove them on out of the temple and the ship and the oxen and poured out the changers money and overthrew the tables and said to them that sold doves take these things from here make note my father's house which is the temple a house of merchandise and his disciple remember that he was written the zeal of your house has eaten me up in another gospel jesus spoke that my house will be the house of prayer if you know your bible pretty good amen so the temple is not only a place but it's a house of prayer america let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly tonight lord thanking you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is what any human being that you give an ability father to read can do but when it comes to interpret your word it's only take lord father the holy spirit to do it father we know and we acknowledge our limitation that we are nothing and we depend completely upon thee a hundred percent father may you move me completely out of the way may you come lord and speak to us and bless each one of us tonight and those that are streaming that could not make it lord father be the beginning and the ending of this service as we commit everything unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen all right tonight we on the four phases of ruth alter slash prayer amen part one was grace part two tabernacle part three the brazen altar part four anybody remember part five that was last sunday the baptism part four was justification part five was the baptism and part six is the altar and prayer amen now we're still dealing a little bit with this brazen altar because it's very important when we talk about elijah in the book of first king we found out in first kings chapter 18 verse 29 and 30 the bible says that it came to pass when the midday was passed and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice if you remember there is two sacrifices in the temple there was a morning sacrifice everybody and there was also an evening sacrifice and we found out that the story of elijah happened not according to the morning sacrifice but according to the evening sacrifice everybody here and the bible says that there was neither voice nor any to answer nor any di regarded because israel was between two opinions verse 30 and elijah say unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto elijah amen before elijah repair the altar everybody the entire nation of israel have to move from their camp the camp of two opinion and get behind or close to elijah the prophet everybody clear but getting closer to elijah or getting on the side of elijah the prophet did not restore the heart of israel yet amen everybody okay so far i hope we on the same page amen so getting where elijah is physically because elijah called you does that restore you everybody here when everybody obey and came near to elijah then elijah opened the other court for them hey mark here and elijah started first with the altar the reparation of the altar amen because remember in the tabernacle that we are in the tabernacle have three places everybody care we have the other court here we have the holy place right here and we have the holiest right there amen and when you get to the other court the first thing that you see is what the brazen altar and the second one is water the lever amen and you see once israel got closer to elijah and mark here elijah open the door of the temple amen and begin first to restore to repair the altar everybody okay so far the altar that elijah was repairing was the altar in reference everybody here to the present altar in the temple anybody here this brazen altar in temple was only a copy or a replica of the brazen altar that was placed by moses everybody okay so far so the original faith the original foundation everybody here the foundation of the fathers were placed by moses everybody here everybody okay so when elijah repaired the altar elijah did not do it in the morning sacrifice but he was doing that at the evening sacrifice because he was returning the heart of israel back to the original foundation that was established by moses everybody okay so far everybody okay so far when jesus met the disciple on the road of the mass he started from moses everybody because moses was the one that duplicated the temple from heaven everybody okay so we found moses because there is three coming off jesus christ everybody okay [Laughter] hallelujah let me pull this and turn it there is three coming of jesus christ we have the first coming of jesus christ everybody okay then we have the second coming of jesus christ amen then we have the third coming of jesus christ amen the original foundation that was laid by the law because the scriptures say the laws came by moses but grace and truth came by jesus christ so moses started everything everybody but before the lamb of god jesus come we found somewhere here that the spirit of elijah came and he came by john the baptist [Music] everybody here let's go to luke chapter one blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah luke chapter 1 [Music] if you dare you can say amen verse 13 but the angel said to him fear not zechariah for your prayer is heard and your wife elizabeth shall bear his son and you shall call his name who john drop down to verse 17 and he shall go before him in the spirit and the power of who to turn the heart of the father to the water and that child was the lord jesus christ everybody so the father already deviated from the faith everybody okay everybody okay and then in order to restore the faith of the father back to the child john the baptist came under the anointing of elijah everybody okay but when john came and the people begin to come to john just like elijah did in the old testament john the baptist also opened the tabernacle everybody okay hallelujah let's go to luke chapter 3. oh my god luke chapter 3 amen verse 2. if you're there you can say amen and us and caiaphas being the high priest anas the word of the lord came to john the son of zechariah in the wilderness and he came into all the countries about jordan preaching water the baptism of water repentance for the remission of water so john was opening the tabernacle and presenting to israel repentance and be baptized repentance the present altar and be baptized into the level everybody okay even jesus christ himself have to go through the same process jesus christ didn't have to repent because jesus was the word made flesh but jesus had to be baptized in the level when john looked at him he said you know i am the one who's supposed to be baptized by you jesus said no no no no no he behooves to do what to fulfill all water that's why what a baptism it's essential it is important because you are fulfilling righteousness everybody okay and jesus also being baptized remember on sunday number one you gotta repent everybody okay number two you gotta be baptized everybody okay baptized number three we found there was a special time for water for prayer and number four what happened the holy ghost everybody okay we went through five examples on sunday in the scripture and demonstrated you this even jesus christ himself the first one who was sealed with the holy spirit you remember have to go through the same process except being except repentance because he was the lamb without blemish jesus said who can convince me of sin jesus was the sinless virtuous son of god he was god made flesh jesus was god everybody okay that's why he didn't have to repent but jesus had to be baptized but before the holy ghost come there is a space of prayer did it happen in the life of jesus too let's go to the look of book of luke hallelujah oh my god blessed be we on luke chapter three drop down to verse 21. oh my goodness you there you there now when all the people were baptized everybody okay he came to pass that jesus also being water karma and water right everybody okay here on the board jesus bring water and water and what follow any question my friend everybody okay jesus being baptized and praying then they have an open and the water it started with jesus christ we saw it in power we saw it in disciple we saw it in cornelius we saw it all the way to the unique the ethiopian eunuch the formula remained the same jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever john the baptist to restore israel back to the uh to bring israel to the faith of the uh of the sun have to bring the other court ever here repentance and then john brought the baptism which was the element of the tabernacle after the death of john jesus came and took over evacuate after jesus left another moses started by the name of paul we already demonstrated to you that down the road back in the past amen but before the end of the gentile age the faith again drifted [Music] everybody okay on jesus came at the east which is the rising of the sun [Music] everybody okay which was speaking about the morning lamb or the morning sacrifice everybody here but at the end elijah must come again everybody here everybody here and this elijah now is william marion branham ever here now he's coming not at the morning at the rising of the sun but he's coming on the west side at the sunset montana in colorado montana at the evening sacrifice because there will be light at the evening time to turn the heart of the children back to the original father everybody here after that after that introducing first coming after this introduction second coming and when jesus come the third time he's coming with his brother but in between this coming everybody here and the third coming we see again moses and elijah going back to the jews again moses elijah moses elijah and moses elijah because the pardon doesn't change jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever this message is perfectly in line with the scripture this message is jesus christ hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord my god everybody okay so far everybody okay so far so now you understand that an evening sacrifice here was done according to bringing israel back over there amen then we found out that elijah took water and poured on the altar amen but the water was in the level you remember so elijah took both the level and the altar and mix it together and brought to israel this is what you need to repair you amen and before the firefall elijah pray repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive the fire the gift of the holy spirit everybody clear so far so being closer to elijah is not enough being in the message camp is not enough you must go through the correct door of redemption you must meet jesus christ as a person or savior that died for you then you must be baptized at the level then you can move on with elijah everybody okay so far blessed be the name of the lord and then when we got in the tabernacle hallelujah we separated the tabernacle we found the other court have those two elements which is the other code then the holy place then the holiest you're not familiar with this amen we found that repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ then there is a space of time shall we speaking about the altar of the essence prayer receive the holy ghost everybody here barbara branham said justification sanctification baptism of the holy spirit roof deciding roof serving roof water and then roof entering from the line of judah which is the door amen because judah was right here and then the priest followed the king and the priest was at the door which was speaking about melchizedek king and priest at the east gate amen when you enter there the first thing that you see the president after the president then you must be baptized everybody okay so far now this repentance and be baptized where did i put it it's on the back we painters and being baptized then you have a space for prayer then the holy ghost you can understand here that this is a process or a journey because the trouble the people were taught that they received the holy ghost when they believe have you received the holy spirit says you believe since why because there is a process this may take time but if your heart is good all of them can be speeded up quickly we find paul receiving the holy spirit before the word of baptism but because we must fulfill our righteousness paul have to be re-baptized cornelius have to be re-baptized amen brother branham said he this he said now this is them true now in the next then the next thing is to do is then you are born again when you receive the holy ghost we went through this already that is when you are converted you might be in process of conversion anybody but you are not converted until it's completed and you are still into the kingdom of god peter when you are converted then you can strengthen your your your your your brethren amen but p they already have faith because jesus said i'm praying for your faith but that faith was not sanctioned yet that faith could whoever he could doubt jesus christ he could even curse wait until we get on sunday in the calvinist and roof everybody care and you will see because remember when you justify the snake is still there and right here hallelujah but obama said there is a vast difference between just a christian and a holy ghost fear christian the first place there is a christian professed to be christian but if this christian has not yet been filled with the holy ghost he's only in the process of being a water he is professed to believe it he's working to it but god has not yet given him the spirit of the holy ghost he's not yet to reach the goal with god that god has recognized it so the holy spirit is the final approval which is the goal and once you reach here then your destination is toward adoption everybody okay blessed be the name of the lord brother branham said one day they left aaron's road in there we found already we talked about aaron's road when they came back they come back the next year to pick it up he had blossom on it and it's already got life in it and had leaves on there and blossom on it and you take an old dead life and lay it in the holes ever here so you can never stay in the other court and have the fruit of the spirit you can impersonate the fruit of the spirit you cannot religiously like pharisees but the fruit we are talking about is not man-made fruit it is god produce fruit the tree never made fruit it's god that have an intimate relationship with the road of aaron because the road of aaron have the name of the high priest and a high priest is jesus christ when you are buried and you carry his name and you carry his name on you and you enter the hardest then it's a different story everybody okay so far brother branham say and let it come through the process of blood altar water liver and sanctification holy place and then go into the you see how you read brother branham you don't have the background you don't understand what brother branham is saying you like the utopian eunuch reading the prophet and do not understand it because he needed a fireform ministry to come and explain to him the prophet he shall blossom out if she is the honest woman there is in this city or the worst gambler that there is you shall hear him stand up on a breakfast some morning and give a testimony that shall shake the shingle off the top of the house here why is because that he come into fellowship that dead life has been renewed again amen brother branham continue he says as david do places well place it not long ago that god don't have any you remember check the door you enter in the message if you enter because of marriage because your parent because your friend something is wrong amen our pentecostal churches are bringing their young one placing them upon the seat and putting them members of the church they never came through the process of being born again no let's take the children take them to church it's good that will not get them where they're supposed to be those children need to meet god themself amen and fill with the holy ghost and upon their own we just take them into the church what have they got by bringing people only to the church a bunch of flat top haircuts rikki's run right on the street here just like the rest of the world women with bobbed hair wearing makeup and everything it's a disgrace trying to part turn after the world instead of going after the spiritual very important how people are getting into the message everybody clear brother branham said if you can smell if you get a whiff that god remains god if you get away from that heaven from heaven tonight that god keep his word and he is a miracle working god and you have not received the holy ghost yet smell the water the first thing he said do certainly repent again from the water the breast and altar is a very sacred altar and playing on the brazen altar this is where billy graham and everybody else fail when your repentance must be sincere everybody here and lay yourself as a sacrifice on the altar with shelter president and you will be consumed off of the world and born again of the spirit and be baptized in the name of jesus christ he shall fill you with them now you understand sometimes he's mixing word born again here then he say fear with the holy spirit you need to understand now amen go through the right process again a process not come shake hand with the preacher and put your name on the book but die so dead that you don't know the word no more brother branham is not mixed up it's the word he uses sometimes 7 700. you need to keep the thought correct everybody here if you notice here brother branham said you must come and repent from the bottom of your heart go to galatians chapter 3 the breast and altar need to be clearly clearly painted to the people in other words clearly demonstrated to the people because it's the beginning of everything if you miss that you waste your time in the message everybody here you're going to stay 20 10 years five years no holy ghost because the beginning was wrong let's go to galatians chapter three verse one all foolish galatians why are they foolish paul foolish galatians what's going on who has bewitched you who brought sorcery on you what is the sorcery hallelujah who has be with you that you should not obey the truth who is the truth jesus okay before whose eyes jesus christ has been evidently set forth do you know what i mean it means clearly portray anybody here in other words paul when he approaches someone amen he give him a clear picture of what jesus is in other words a clear picture of the atonement everybody here and paul wanted to warn the galatians to keep that image here paul demonstrated to them clearly the present altar because the president you know represented cavalry everybody here and paul wanted this believer as they are progressing on the road that they keep remembering calvary amen but somebody came and tried to take them off calvary and bring them back to the law he said somebody has bewitched you before whose eyes jesus christ has been evidently set forth water not that jesus christ but jesus christ how crucified jesus crucified is jesus at the present altar everybody here on calvary somebody took you away from calvary galatian what is going on watch what is next this only would i learn from you tell me a little bit receive you the spirit by the work of the law or by the hearing of water everybody are you so foolish having begun in there are you now made perfect by the water everybody okay job to verse 11 lord give me time anybody here we're talking about the other court verse 11 you there but that no man is what the other court ever care by the law in the sight of god ever here come on it is evident for the just shall live by water we on the other court everybody here verse 12 and the law is not of faith but the man that does them shall live in them it's the doers amen christ has redeemers from the curse of the law the present altar being made cursed for us anybody here for it is written curse is everyone that hangs on the water he's bringing back the cross again the president everybody here watch verse 14 what did the president although that cross do to you galatians i'm trying to make you understand you already got the holy ghost somebody is coming bringing confusion removing the cross you could not get to the holy ghost without that cross galatian it is the cross that opened the way it is the cross that rented the veil of the temple so that the whole years can be exposed and now we can have access into the holiest galactic remember that altar is very important everybody okay so far blessed be the name of the lord verse 14 when he was hung on the cross what happened that the water the blessing of who might come unto the water remember the crossing of hand of the children of joseph the blessing the holy ghost that was supposed to go in the jews now the blessing through the cross it is the present altar that brought you the holy ghost [Music] ever care the blessing of abraham might come to the gentile through who jesus christ that we may receive the promise of the water the spirit through water galatians who confuse you so when you preach the gospel you meet somebody on the street you don't tell him the seventh seal is open you don't talk to him about the feast of the offer of tabernacle you don't give him the code i mean the sermon book of the feast of the trumpet you're gonna blind him completely those are meat he need the milk of the world you started first with the president begin right then he won't have a problem in the message [Music] everybody okay let's go to matthew 23. keep your bible my friend hallelujah my god let's go to matthew 23. this is where you get juicy hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah there is a lot brother greg you move you walk and you walk you look at that not a candle on the cake a strawberry you can't get it so tempting you get just to relax you matthew 23 are you there let's go to verse 16. we are on the prison altar are you there woe to you lord help me okay word to you blind god which say whosoever shall swear by the what by the temple it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple is air when they were building the temple and the furniture of the temple some of those furniture was overlaid by gold gold gold gold gold gold to the point that you cannot separate the gold from the temple the pharisee came the religious one and begin to bring separation between the temple and the gold of the temple everybody here and they say okay if you swear by the old by the temple there is no problem to her the problem is the gold of the altar now the people begin to get confused so now what do we give importance is it the gold of the altar of the temple or is it the temple everybody care because the brazen altar must be clearly demonstrated you cannot bring confusion at the present altar am i reading a different bible you ready let's drop down lunch into the deep you there you fools again blind for weather is greater the god or the temple that the water so the temple was the one sanctifying the gold ever here but the pharisees took the people away from the temple no one there later on they can sell anything in the temple [Music] because the sacredness of the temple is no longer there this just dropped from heaven brother robert are you there take verse 18. you ready now watch this keep your seatbelt and whosoever shall swear by the water oh my god brother kelly which although is that one we are the brazen altar whosoever remember paul say you don't play with the brazen altar look how the pharisee brought confusion at the brazen altar whosoever shall swear by the altar is nothing in other words the altar is no more important what the author brother branham said brass represent divine judgment where the price was paid which was speaking of cavalry somebody believe the cavalry everybody here everybody here and whosoever but whosoever swear by the weapon do i have a space here oh yes thank you jesus i'm gonna build my altar this is the altar and this is hopefully it's an animal whatever you can we have an animal on the altar the beast the sacrifice this is the gift this is the sacrifice and this is the altar ever here now the pharisees say you swear by this it's nothing if you swear by this one this is the most important thing everybody okay everybody okay okay verse 19 you fools and blind for weather is greater the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift everybody okay so far everybody okay so far the gift when it's outside the tabernacle it is a normal animal amen everybody okay but when the gift touches the altar that gift changed he became a sacred animal that only the priest can eat [Music] nobody else can eat it anymore everybody okay so far now jesus is asking which one is big it was the altar that was sanctifying the gift are you there you read this before a long time now you see why he's imported amen verse 20 who so therefore shall swear by the water swear by it the altar and by water so when you are jesus correct them that when you are swearing about the altar you're not just swearing about the altar you're swearing about the entire thing in other words the altar and the gifts are won and they cannot be separated amen did you get that brother mikey then we watch this again whose show shall swear by the temple swear by it verse 21 and by him thou do whatever so that temple was not only the building but when god dwell in that temple the temple became like god when god dwelled in jesus christ the man jesus christ became god everybody here 100 human 100 percent divine ever here and he does swear by the help by heaven swear by water everybody here the throne of god and by him the water so when you swearing by heaven you cannot separate heaven from god [Music] what are you trying to say everybody here what are you trying to say you ready this altar is a author that doesn't change keep your seat belt you okay what changes is the sacrifice on top of the altar everybody here everybody okay anybody here did you get it did you get it this altar has been a foundation that was placed by moses and solomon kept it because he was made after the altar that was in heaven where the seraphim which are the the delivered of heaven were working over there remembers they are sick here it was the original foundation it does not change what changes is the gift or the sacrifice everybody here and the sacrifice was changing constantly everybody clear so far everybody this altar doesn't change but the word made flesh bleeding sacrifice was changing upon the same altar are you okay are you okay this altar is like your bible [Music] it remains the original foundation he remained the absolute american but the sacrifice or the message of the messenger might change [Music] are you there but you cannot separate the messenger the message and the bible because the message and the bible are one what vindicated the message is the foundation upon which the message stands the message came from the bible the message is vindicated by the bible that's why the message is right you cannot bring a discussion between the message and the bible you are bringing confusion between the altar and the gift that is on the altar the altar and the gifts are the same and the gifts have been vindicated by the bible in this church we don't know argue what is right the message of the bible the foundation remains the bible but the absolute interpretation of the bible is the message of the hour you cannot separate the two you cannot say the message is right and you begin to reject the bible this is pharisee the message came from heaven it was an open book which was the bible the message was the bible within the bible [Applause] it is the bible that vindicated the message of the hour the bible said brother branham said the bible said brother branham said the message is perfectly in line with the bible you cannot separate the two you cannot put one above the other there two are one when you swear by one you swearing by the other when you believe the bible you must believe the message of the hour and when you reject the message of the hour you reject the bible this message is perfectly lined with the scripture blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah [Applause] this thing have to be clearly expressed not bringing confusion hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah let's drop brother kelly i don't know what to do my time is running up go to verse one i thought i can finish this so i get on luther i can say amen hallelujah whoever deliberately stay home my god it's milky here i wish i knew amen matthew 23 then spoke jesus to the mountain and to his disciples saying the who and who who went into the temple everybody okay the scrub and the pharisee sit on moses seat they know they caught they know the quote very well brother branham said brother branham say they know it they sit on moses seed on the prophet seeks everybody here but what the problem oh therefore whatsoever they bid you to observe and do to observe that observe and do if they give you a coat regardless whether they are hypocrite or not you just take the coat but don't take them you follow me if you said the judge shall leave by faith and it's a baptist who said that i will say amen i'm saying amen to the world but not to the baptist as long as brother branham said pick up what brother branham say but the problem is your interpretation ever here he said observe and do but do not you after the water in other words there is a discrepancy between their preaching and their lives they preach a certain way but they live a different way and if you look at the life and the sermon you're going to be shocked and it may it can cause you to stumble remember gifts and calling out without repentance pick up what they say but don't pay attention too much in their lives everybody okay so far he says for they say and they do not oh my god everybody okay for they burn the heavy burden and grief used to be born and lay them on men's shoulder but thems they themselves will not move with them uh with one of their fingers they tell you to do stuff they cannot do themselves but all the work they do for it to be seen of men all they do is for popularity they make brought their philatel and enlarge the borders of their gunman and love the upper mushroom at the feast i will teach you these young people you go to a feast i will show you where to sit ever here and the chiefs sit in the synagogue and breeding in the market and to be called of men who rubber rubber jump to verse 14 wow unto you scrub and pharisee hypocrite i thought this man say that he was a good man for you devoured with those houses i thought they were clean and for the protest make long prayer therefore you shall receive the greater condemnation everybody let me skip down job to verse 25 what do you scrub and pharisee hypocrite for you may clean the outside of the cup and the blood but within they are full of water and water unclean on the inside so in the macroscope of god both of them are sinners one is a conscious sinner a humble the other one is an arrogant sinner because paul found himself like this paul said that i am the pharisee of pharisee remember that and paul said that i realized that i was the chief sinner everybody okay let me try to see if i can skip some of them verse 28 even so even even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men but within you are full of water and water that's what was up there so his prayer doesn't have sincerity that's why he went home the same way he came in and probably worse than that what are you trying to say brother branham say that is even becoming the pentecost in the churches he be coming into the pentecostal realm that they are always promising something that they never get to it it's always that every fellow has a different sensation make it whether it's scriptural or not and they are promising something that they never do get to it unless it seems like it's got to a place where there doesn't seem to be any sincerity the people don't get down to that real kernel of sincerity the very word is lost the very word sincerity has lost its value to the people or by the people's way of living it's lost its sincerity to them now they don't seem to understand even our confession very important because the brazen author will open the way all the way there remember roof nobody told her to glean she was the one automatically going to clean and god directed her foot to the field of boys it happened based on roof deciding a genuine decision a genuine confession i think one of the things that keep our people from being here is lack of confession come on is the lack of sincere confession everybody okay what i'm saying but looking at my wife sitting here if i would go out here today and throw my arm around some other woman and make love to her and i know then after i did that that i was wrong it's an example now of course my comforter will keep me from doing that that's why you need the holy ghost you keep falling falling falling falling it's a problem no holy ghost everybody but i mean if i did if it happened that i did it or anything similar to it and then i know the first thing is to say to my wife before i can say to god forgive me because i sin against her what brother branham is saying here is when you commit adultery before you even go to god go back to your partner or your spouse brother branham say supposingly it happened what happened if you come to the altar and remember you have ought you go make that right first remember that was in jesus when you go to the hotel with your gift which alter was it the brazen altar when you remember that you and your neighbor don't get along stop don't go to that altar it's a serious altar go back correct before you continue if not you're going to come back like a pharisee but here go make a right first before you offer your gift so i've got to go to her i believe in confession he's straightening up also it is not true confession unless it is confession you gotta make things right the correct way that's why not doing this correctly here block you from the holy ghost brother branham says what if i said now i'm going to confess it that i done wrong and i say good lord oh friend of mine you know that i know you real well praise god hallelujah i think you are a good old fellow forgive me you know old fellow i didn't mean it that way see now you say that is sacrilegious it is to make a confession like that in other words when you're going to repent you don't play game you don't commit adultery and you're coming back to your wife telling your wife oh hallelujah praise the lord my wife i love you where is the alleluia coming from that hallelujah is coming from hell [Music] did you hear me you must not come playing games brother branham said it is sacrilegious how are you doing i'm sorry i was kidding you were kidding repenting no you need to stop and say sister i am sorry i treated you bad what i did is wrong i am sorry without even laughing [Music] hallelujah but what if i go and say lord i didn't mean to do it just that way and you help me and won't do it again he shall refuse my sacrifice until i first go and make that right with my wife then what if i come to her to my wife with the same irreverence and say say oh girl oh friend of mine oh mother of my children oh sweetheart you know we have been all charmed for a long time say what uh if i put my arm around another woman and what do you say about it oh kid would you forgive me in other words you're coming to your wife he said let me ask you a question what about if one day you hear that i fall with a woman are you gonna forgive me brother branham say i imagine how she'll look your wife will give you a look where are you coming from amen she would think what has happened to my husband now the first thing she would not know whether i was kidding or whether i was not and you don't go that way to make a confession to your or to whom oh hallelujah good to see you brother i was just trying to tell you i'm sorry for what i did the other day okay okay hallelujah you go with the depth of sincerity with water it's not laughing godly sorrow of your sin first you must be water i must tell her sweetheart come here it may mean the rest of our married life the woman that i live with that is my sweetheart and how i love you all this year but now you may leave me from this on you may not stay with me you may not accept me and i'm knowing that but yet to make it right i've got to make it right in other words when you sit down you say listen if you have to leave me i understand that you have the right to do it so because what i did i did wrong i'm asking you forgiveness if you want to leave you can leave but i gather correct my life with god because jesus is coming that's the way you confess hallelujah brother branham say then i got to tell god the same way and tell both her and god with the sincerity that i shall never do it again by the grace of god maybe my speech to her would convince her but my speech won't convince god you can manipulate your conversion you can sit down and make people feel like you understand i didn't mean that i was i was i was just to understand understand you are manipulating human being but you will not manipulate god because god is seeing your heart that you don't want to make it right you're a hypocrite amen and after all just a few more years with her if god permits i shall be taken out of the world what about if you die after two days you were trying to protect a marriage now you're dead you're going to hell but with god it's eternity so i must be deeply sincere with god in other words i rather lose my marriage and be right with god than trying to protect my marriage and the hypocrisy and lose heaven because heaven will be eternity everybody but if i'm not sincere there is no need of me wasting who you're going to fast 10 days you're wasting your time god's time listening to me and that is where he comes to today amongst people that doesn't seem to have the depth of sincerity that they ought to have where sincerity at the brazen author amen let me move on to this and get to somewhere amen when we talk on sunday we mentioned about cornelius brother branham says this i need this still okay praise god brother branham says this blessed be the name of the lord brother branham said that i believe the same condition was with those hearts at the house of cornelius when they had received the word of god amen with gladness and the holy spirit is that word quicken and he has been quickened to them that is the reason the holy ghost begin to speak out in other tongue and prophesy it's about cornelius it was the receptacle heart of the people that the word fell into it seeing all the supernatural this is the key while he yet spread this word the holy ghost fell then peter said can we forbid water you remember on sunday sing that this received the holy ghost like we did i believe the sin were already gone for the holy spirit would not have come in but abraham is saying that the sin of cornelius was already gone even even the sin of his friend everybody that received the holy ghost they were already been forgiven they already have faith if not the holy ghost will not sanction it did brother brother give you the scripture let's go to acts chapter 10. let me hurry up quickly now i still have my minute let's go to act chapter 10. if you dare you can say amen act 10 verse 9 cornelius had his vision when he finished having his vision praise the lord god also went his vision told him to go call peter the angel told him to go get a peter and on the other hand peter was at home hungry trying to do something and suddenly something happened to peter verse nine on the morrow as they went on their way they were going to get peter and junar to the city peter went up to the housetop to do water but robert to pray at what time altar and prayer peter went to pray and what time the sixth hour the six hours is called this is jewish language in the gentile language it is 12 p.m what you call noon i'm going slowly now maybe and he began and he became very hungry and would have eaten but while they made ready he fell into a trance and saw heaven open and a certain vessel descending to him as he had been a great knit at the four corners and let down to the earth when we were all manner of four-footed beasts of the earth and wild beast verse 12 and grief and creeping things and falls off the air and there came a voice to him rise peter kill and do what but peter say not so lord for i have never eaten anything that is common or what god was showing him what he knew by the law was unclean everybody unclean and the voice spoke to him again the second time what god has that you call not you what so god was giving peter the vision because he knew he's gonna send peter for the first time to the gentile and peter explained down the road that there was no way a jew can have fellowship with the gentiles so god show him that those people i'm sending you to are already clean don't call them unclean that's why when they were preaching the gospel when they preached the gospel automatically the holy ghost fell down because their vessels were already declared clean everybody okay go back to verse one now this is where we're getting the present altar in prayer amen you there there was a certain man in caesarea called cornelius a centurion a gentile of the band called the italian man a devout man and one that feared god with all his house which gave much arm to the people and prayed to god how this is a believer amen watch he saw in a vision evidently about the water cornelius was praying amen and he saw a vision and the vision was at what time the ninth hour the ninth hour in the gentile language it's 3 p.m everybody okay and ninth hour of the day an angel of god coming to him saying to him cornelius now in psalm 55 i want you to understand well the president is not a gamer in some brazen altar entrance you come with sincerity you don't play gamer in psalm 55 17 david says this that evening morning and water so we have the morning number one number two the noon everybody okay and number three the what the evening ever here this noon we know it's what the six hours back here the evening we have what the ninth hour what is the morning so david said morning evening and noon we'll pray and cry out loud and he shall hear my voice according to david brother david these three spots brother robert are the time of prayer the prayer and the presidential brother kelly ready he gets yummy now you want to go home okay daniel 6 verse 10 now when daniel knew that the writing was signed they told him nobody can pray here for one month to any other god he went into his house and his window being opened in his chamber toward water why was he doing that he was doing that in reference to the prayer of solomon at the present altar solomon at the president pray god and say if anybody is elsewhere in trouble if they turn around towards jerusalem where the president is healed their prayer even jonah at the belly of the well had to get a compass a gps to direct himself in the deep of the ocean throughout jerusalem once your prayer goes toward jerusalem automatically god hears what was in jerusalem where was solomon praying solomon was praying at the present altar praise and altar and prayer we okay now hallelujah and then he nailed upon his knee what was solomon doing upon his knee how many times so daniel was praying three times david said he prayed how many times david was worshipping praising god seven times you need a scripture you see me but he was praying three times three and seven the mathematics everybody okay all right now he nailed upon his knee three times a day and pray and get thanked to his god as he did a full time so there was something about daniel that every day morning noon evening prayer and david said morning noon evening prayer in reference to what is going on in jerusalem in the temple you ready act three verse one now peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour of what being the water everybody okay everybody okay remember in the morning at the temple was the morning sacrifice the morning lamb ever here and the evening the ninth hour had another sacrifice which was the evening sacrifice where elijah was praying everybody okay my god lord help me in acts 2 verse 15 when the disciple came from the upper room acting like they were drunk under the power of the holy spirit the people look at them they said they drunk with one peter say for these are not drunken as he supposed seeing it is about the water the third hours of the day is what you call in the gentle 9 a.m morning third hours noon six hours evening nine tower everybody okay that's why peter was telling them it is nine o'clock in the morning have you seen somebody drunk at nine o'clock this is that which was professor by the prophet joe we are drunk with the simulation of revelation you can get drunk too early in the morning as you're going to work and you're just singing disease the day this is the day that the lord has made that day long you can get drunk my name [Music] oh my god you okay okay that's act 23 verse 23 and he called on to him two centurions saying make ready 200 soldier to go to caesarea and horsemen three score and 10 and spearman 200 at the third hours of the water so we have the third hours of the day and third hour of the night everybody okay the first thessalonians farm for day that sleep sleep in water and they that be drunken are drunken in water that's why peter told them it is nine o'clock those that get drunk drunk at night not in the day so this is something different everybody okay the president and prayer everybody okay in the parable of the 11 hours worker jesus give the parable and in matthew 20 verse 3 he went about the third hour and so understanding other in the market and say unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whosoever is right i will give it to you i will give you and they went to their way again he went about the water and water and did water any question third six nothing there is more to that i left the 7th and the 10th everybody okay all right let's stick with those brother branham say a little german woman she got the instruction and they interpreted to her what he was in germany how that first you call your pastor and if your pastor can come some good christian out in the neighborhood or some member of your family confess all you're wrong if you have any praying brother branham says that he was sending prayer cloth and when he sent prayer cloth when you receive prayer cloth the first thing you do call your pastor pray with him or if if not call a brother or sister or somebody call with everybody here brother one of them say take this little piece of cloth and pin it on the underneath garment lay your hand upon it and tell god that you shall serve him the rest of your life if he will let you get well everybody okay destruction and then when you do that then each water off at the old [Music] remember these hours i'm gonna close these hours jewish third six 9 gentle 9 a.m 12 noon and 3 p.m this message perfectly in line with the scripture everybody here then when you do that then each hour at the oh sacrificial awake brother brother i'm going to pick up the hour from the brazen altar hallelujah at nine o'clock am i reading a different quarter 12 o'clock and what in the afternoon eastern water going back to the temple brother brown i'm going back to the temple the present altar and prayer ever here that is when i'm praying at the same time and we go round the clock go around the clock like that and around the world god can't ignore that this message is something else brother branham went in the old testament look at the three times and pulled them up and brother branham began to pray according to those time and he said god will not ignore that ignore that not according to the old sacrificial really but the old sacrificial was a shadow the law being the shadow of good things to come he was three six nine for the jews but through jesus christ it is interpreted as nine twelve and three p.m the present altar everybody okay all over the world at the same minute is prayer hundred of prayer of people blasting forth at one time where did brother branham get that the message did brother branham give you this scripture you have not seen something yet relax chill out this message is perfectly in line with the bible everybody here the brass speak of divine judgment on the brazen otter remember that where the beast bodies were burnt after the blood was taken every water six or third hour and water nine o'clock at the morning david nine twelve o'clock six and three o'clock in the water gallon of blood was thrown on this altar over the body of the dead beast black smoke rose up every jew in palestine fell to his water and his head toward water and as the smoker sanded up his water all right divine judgment the body will burn at the water brothers and altar and pray hallelujah hallelujah brother bonham said i was lying down sleeping head just went to sleep which i don't sleep very much at night always in prayer night time when all demon powers shut down toward water when they are not roaming that is the time the holy spirit moves in and talks to me go only if you want to do whatever rise up water most worker is gone demon and places are water the nightclub is shutting down brother branham understood that now me and heaven are quickly there is no interference are you there that causes strange things you know what i mean by that amen hallelujah jesus and verse mark 15 and it was the third hour and they did what the morning had the morning lamb and jesus was the mourning eastern land the rising of the sun the first lamb that came they have to be sacrificed in the morning why did they crucify him at three at the third hour because he have to die and as the morning lamb because we have the evening lamb so they gotta put jesus on the cross at the morning noted the evening amen but when they put him in the morning he didn't die yet you okay hallelujah matthew 27 now from the sixth hour there was darkness all over the land until the water am i reading a different bible third hour is crucified from here to hear darkness but here is the time of the evening lamb amen the token have to come in there evening time the morning they put him on the cross because he is the morning lamb at the third hour and 9 a.m they put him on the cross telling you this is the lamb the lamb must go must die in the morning hallelujah and about the water jesus christ with a loud voice six to nine darkness but nine when the time of the evening sacrifice he cried he said what ela do you know that the word elijah means yeah my father is god illa if you need the scripture you see me i'll give it to you that is to say my god my god why is that forsaken me all this happened between those three hours the time of prayer the praise and altar and the time of prayer let me close and lay down the plan in matthew 9 then came to to him the disciple of john and said to him what do you and the pharisee first of them but the disciple first not i come to find out as i was studying that jews were fasting every tuesday and friday i can't prove it i don't know that's what i read somewhere i say let me check brother branham everybody here anybody here why does the pharisee and the disciple of john fast by your disciple jesus are not fasting and jesus said unto them can the children of the bride chamber moon as long as the bridegroom is with them but the day will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them and they shall then water when i've been going out they can start fasting but how many times do jews fast remember the pharisee he said i fast how many times which days that's what somebody says i need to go by my prophet everybody here brother branham i have been fasting and was just like tonight fridays is the first day has been for me for a long time [Music] where did you learn this william marion branham usually fridays is a first day for me i don't eat on some time when and what where did brother branham learn that this message is more than what you think amen till sometime indeed that is not a regular fast that is just a couple of days a week to fast remember the pharisee the jews were doing that so he pulled the fasting from the jews and he pulled the hours of prayer from the jews but here the pharisee was praying before and the other court at the president he said first twice a day ever here so i along first come more days when the lord put it on you you don't put it yourself but that is just in respect and honor of god's great memorial to us the fasting a command and so after three o'clock three p.m evening time ninth hour usually i have a little something all of this locked up over there in the mystery of the level here that's why the eunuch he came to worship in jerusalem you remember he was worshipping under the old law every year and the lord opened his bible and then he fell on isaiah when isaiah was talking about the crucifixion of jesus christ so the lord pulled him to the brazen altar but he didn't understand the meaning of the brazen altar so when philip came philip opened the brazen altar and began to tell him that the man that was dying there is jesus christ in other words philip was pulling him through the president when he got him hooked at the brazen altar quickly the man saw the lever automatically he said do you see water what hindered me to be you just presented to me the level i already seen the level why can't that look you already presented to me the president now i see that's the messiah jesus christ is the president but what follow next is water look at water over there philip say wait a minute before i put you in the water let me hear your confession he said i believe that jesus christ is the son of god philip say stop the chariot me and you let's go to the level and then from there on god take over your life begin good at the present altar watch where you came how you enter in the message did you enter because you were born in a message were you following your friend where you following somebody check if your entrance is good because that entrance is the beginning that's going to unlock the remaining of the staff if it's correct the president and the prayer life is going to open everything else remember you'll be repent being baptized and prayer let's stand i went over 15 minutes and i left some other stuff again amen even paul they have to pull paul from the old atonement until paul understands that the jehovah is jesus christ and paul changed his disposition toward jesus he said lord what do you want me now to do now since you accepted the atonement if you go in the book of acts 10 you will see cornelius when peter come came there peter begin to preach to them jesus christ crucify i can read it to you go to act 10. what was peter doing peter say okay the lord called you for me to help you okay the way we started we always start with the president peter pulled the brazen altar and said do you remember what happened in jerusalem do you remember what the chief priests did they crucified the masterpiece that was again bringing the brazen author and as they bring the president god said these already understood this they already passed the holy ghost drop when the holy ghost dropped peter say wait a minute they already got uh at the finishing line but i didn't see them baptized he fulfilled come back and get baptized again then they fulfill the tabernacle the other court the holy place and the holiest the tabernacle is fulfilled you go into adoption let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again father for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we cannot over emphasize the need of calvary to the believer lord calvary means a lot and means everything to us to take the dear lamb of god to accept to be spit on to accept to be stripped completely naked something that none of us here will accept but father you took it all the way and all the ordinances just like you did for roof that was against her father you nail everything at the cross and you want us to always start at the cross at the cross at the cross further that's the starting point and once a decision is made clear with sincerity with a true deep lord father confession it will unlock everything because from there on we are born under the lineage of melchizedek and you take over the shipload until you bring it ashore lord we keep going over this and emphasizing on this because the new birth is a very important and crucial element now that you see we see all the signs falling all around the world father we know that the coming of the lord is very very very very close lord and father we want to make sure to examine ourself whether we are in the faith how did we get in this message do we remember day that we stood at the present altar and give our life to jesus christ and students had a personal experience with jesus christ that is beyond mama beyond our families beyond religion beyond following a friend or following somebody or beyond coming into the message because you want to get married but it goes beyond that until an anchor get into the soul and we know that from this point on if my father leave the message i stay with it if my husband leave the message just stay with him if my wife leave if my if whoever can leave the message this message now means life to me because i met the author of this message i met jesus christ at the present altar and my life now is in order father help this congregation and help also those that can stream lord father if you direct this footstep lord to do so father we thank you for giving us this time and we commit lord father this few words that was spoken unto the hand father stir your children lord to this life of prayer that lord father they can
