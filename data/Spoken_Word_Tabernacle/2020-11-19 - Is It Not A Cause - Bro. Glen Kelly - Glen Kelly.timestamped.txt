[35:21] so you home make yourself home
[35:24] pull on the word of the lord and we
[35:27] trust it's going to be a blessing
[35:28] tonight
[35:30] next week is thanksgiving
[35:33] we want to be mindful of the sisters
[35:37] who probably have to cook for
[35:39] thanksgiving
[35:41] so that has been said instead of having
[35:44] service
[35:45] on wednesday next week only
[35:48] well i will repeat this on sunday and we
[35:51] will send the text
[35:52] on monday i believe a mass text just to
[35:55] make sure
[35:56] everybody got it so next wednesday
[35:59] we will not have service here tonight
[36:02] our service will be
[36:03] on tuesday instead so next week we will
[36:07] have service on tuesday night
[36:09] not wednesday amen so wednesday the
[36:13] sister can cook the turkey
[36:15] for thanksgiving amen praise the name of
[36:19] the lord so we want to be mindful of
[36:21] that we don't want to
[36:22] come here and everybody rushing at home
[36:24] and trying to gather food
[36:26] and everything so we're still gonna have
[36:28] service then
[36:29] the following week everything resumed
[36:31] back on wednesday
[36:32] everybody got that i got some reading
[36:35] for you
[36:37] amen okay for this coming
[36:40] weekend lord's willing if you would in
[36:44] preparation for the service
[36:47] you can read first samuel chapter 15.
[36:52] amen we are still on the same subject
[36:55] the three fists of king a hazarist and
[36:57] the two banquet
[36:59] of esther you just saw last sunday from
[37:01] verse one to four
[37:03] we could not even finish it amen
[37:06] so first samuel chapter 15 that's your
[37:09] first chapter
[37:10] so make yourself you uh familiar with it
[37:14] the second one will be esther chapter
[37:16] three that's where we are
[37:18] don't go to chapter four because chapter
[37:20] three is loaded
[37:22] amen esther chapter 3
[37:25] then the last one will be matthew 25.
[37:30] we need those three scriptures for
[37:33] sunday
[37:34] if you want to make yourself ready
[37:38] go ahead just read it meditate upon it
[37:41] prayer
[37:42] and i believe the holy spirit can even
[37:44] begin to unfold to you
[37:46] before even we get on sunday if you're
[37:49] still struggling a little bit with the
[37:51] book of life
[37:53] i just caught that matthew 25
[37:57] is the book of life amen
[38:01] when you read matthew 25 there is three
[38:04] parable
[38:06] there is the parable of the ten virgins
[38:09] he gives you the foolish virgin and the
[38:11] wise virgin
[38:12] amen then the second parable is the
[38:16] parable when jesus spoke about
[38:18] the man that gave his servant talent
[38:21] he gave one ten talent the second one
[38:24] five talent and the last one was one
[38:28] amen and two of them
[38:32] multiply or gain their talent by a
[38:35] hundred
[38:37] so the bible says that god gave them
[38:40] those talents
[38:41] according to their ability
[38:44] amen so when god places a gift in your
[38:47] life
[38:48] god already see you that you are capable
[38:52] to take that gift to its maximum
[38:56] amen because the bible says that the one
[38:59] who have
[39:00] ten gained ten more a hundred percent
[39:04] amen the one who had five again also
[39:07] five
[39:08] so the one that had won had also the
[39:11] potential
[39:12] to gain warner but he neglected the gift
[39:18] and he was thrown out in the outer
[39:20] darkness
[39:21] where there is whipping and gnashing of
[39:24] teeth
[39:25] again you have your bride there the two
[39:29] there is two categories of them still in
[39:31] the broad
[39:32] we are not on the same level amen
[39:35] that's the bride and then you will see
[39:37] the wicked one
[39:38] who took the talent and buried that
[39:41] that's your book of life
[39:43] and the last parable is the parable word
[39:46] jesus is saying as a shepherd is
[39:48] dividing the
[39:49] sheep from the goat all those three
[39:53] parables
[39:54] are your three categories that are
[39:56] included in the book of life
[39:58] one is the bride one is the foolish
[40:01] virgin
[40:01] and the righteous of matthew 25 which
[40:04] are the sheep
[40:05] and another one are gonna have their
[40:07] name in the book of life
[40:08] but their name will be raised and
[40:11] whoever is not in matthew 25
[40:14] his name was now written in the lamb's
[40:17] book of life
[40:18] you have your four category all of them
[40:21] in one chapter amen and the goat
[40:25] the bible says that he talked to the one
[40:27] on the left he said depart from me
[40:29] go to everlasting fire
[40:32] that was prepared for the devil if you
[40:35] recall jesus called judah a devil
[40:39] so that's that character that that
[40:41] specie
[40:42] that is religious that can get anointed
[40:46] have a talent from the master but does
[40:49] not do anything about that talent
[40:51] amen so if you have a gift in this
[40:53] church
[40:55] put it for the lord if you have a
[40:58] beautiful voice
[41:00] put it for the lord if god blesses you
[41:03] with something
[41:04] put it to work once you put it to work
[41:08] recognizing that the gift came from him
[41:11] an
[41:11] anointing will drop on you to take that
[41:14] gift
[41:14] all the way to its maximum capacity
[41:18] amen first samuel chapter 15
[41:23] esther chapter 3 and matthew
[41:26] chapter 25 dealing with the book of life
[41:30] we need something in matthew 25
[41:32] to help us unlock something in esther we
[41:35] have

[44:30] opportunity a brother send it to me and

[44:40] brother dave
[44:42] i want to see this
[44:46] come to praise our king
[45:08] in 1904 revival swept across
[45:11] wales god made himself known in a very
[45:15] special
[45:16] and personal way after the revival a
[45:19] welshman ventured halfway across the
[45:21] world to
[45:22] india and he trekked up the mountains
[45:25] towards a remote village in the east
[45:28] he was told go back the tribe in that
[45:31] village are famously violent
[45:33] but the welshman ignored the warnings
[45:36] because even these savage headhunters
[45:39] should have the opportunity to hear
[45:42] about the mercy of god
[45:44] one tribesman and his family heard the
[45:47] gospel
[45:48] and received jesus as their savior the
[45:51] good news was too good to keep to
[45:53] themselves
[45:54] and they shared the gospel with others
[45:56] in the tribe
[45:58] the chief was very angry and he had the
[46:01] tribe's man and his family
[46:03] dragged before the village stop
[46:05] following
[46:06] jesus the chief demanded the tribe's man
[46:10] replied
[46:11] no i have decided to follow
[46:14] jesus i am not turning back
[46:19] the chief was furious and killed the
[46:22] tribesman's children
[46:24] stop following jesus the chief insisted
[46:27] the tribesman replied though none go
[46:30] with me
[46:31] i still will follow no turning back
[46:36] the chief showed no mercy and he killed
[46:39] the tribesman's wife
[46:42] now you will stop following this jesus
[46:45] the chief said the tribe's man looked
[46:48] the chief in the
[46:49] eyes and replied
[46:52] the cross before me the world behind me
[46:57] no turning back
[47:00] the chief could not believe his years
[47:03] and he killed the tribesmen
[47:08] jesus said if a grain of wheat dies
[47:12] it bears much fruit and that day
[47:15] many of the villagers who witnessed the
[47:17] persecution of that tribesman
[47:19] and his family also decided
[47:23] to follow jesus even the chief himself
[47:28] became a follower of jesus christ
[47:31] the tribesman's last words became the
[47:34] song
[47:34] of the village and today it is sung
[47:38] all around the world i have decided
[47:42] to follow jesus
[47:57] see what our god did in our time here
[48:00] now
[48:01] got my glasses god help me
[48:05] hallelujah okay you understand we're
[48:07] gonna go to two passages of scriptures
[48:12] and we'll look at uh ephesians
[48:17] six and ten
[48:21] hallelujah
[48:26] but steve started there and and we'll
[48:28] also
[48:29] be going to uh first samuel 17.
[48:32] prestige started talking about samuel i
[48:35] said uh-oh
[48:37] i'll just have ephesians 6 and 10 amen
[48:42] finally my brethren be strong in the
[48:45] lord and in the power of his might put
[48:48] on the whole armor of god
[48:49] that ye may be able to stand against the
[48:52] wiles of the devil
[48:54] we know we wrestle not against flesh of
[48:56] flesh and blood
[48:57] but against principalities and powers
[48:59] and against the rulers of the darkness
[49:01] of this world
[49:02] against spiritual wickedness we're in
[49:04] high places
[49:06] okay and then this um first samuel 17
[49:15] and we'll read the uh
[49:17] [Music]
[49:21] we'll read the uh 20 uh 29th
[49:24] first but we'll be working from 17
[49:28] over to uh 29.
[49:46] praise the lord okay that first samuel
[49:49] 29
[49:51] amen he said and and david said
[49:54] what have i done now and done is there
[49:57] not a cause
[49:59] you may be seated you know we're looking
[50:02] to
[50:03] listen to a message there um you know
[50:06] brother brown
[50:06] he preached the message the great
[50:09] warrior david
[50:11] but you know here we want to look at uh
[50:14] got the inspiration from it but our
[50:15] topic tonight
[50:18] is there not a cause
[50:21] you know so the times that we're living
[50:23] in we can look at that and say broadly
[50:26] is it not a cause you know so that's why
[50:29] we know now
[50:31] more so than ever it's time for the
[50:33] gospel to be spread out now
[50:35] is that right because we know by what
[50:38] the lord has been doing for us
[50:40] in this hour here now and what he has
[50:42] unfolded
[50:44] is really nothing left but basically the
[50:46] rapture is that right
[50:48] okay because god as we know is just it
[50:51] can happen any day and anytime but god
[50:54] has given us commissions
[50:56] and you know so that's why we're
[50:58] rejoicing we're thanking god for all the
[51:00] mysteries
[51:00] we're thanking god for the things that
[51:02] he's uh unfolding
[51:04] and brother uh uh steve i wasn't that
[51:06] sardius age and i'll tell you i might
[51:08] get a chance to read it tonight
[51:10] but i'm telling you god hid that up
[51:12] under there
[51:13] what you working with he hid that up
[51:15] under that sardis with that wheat
[51:17] and that tear he hid it and that saudi
[51:18] and say it's in there
[51:20] you got to go back and read what the
[51:22] pastor told you to read is in there
[51:24] okay but uh before i get ahead of myself
[51:27] let me read this to you it says now the
[51:31] cause
[51:32] of cause you think we're gonna show you
[51:34] how mighty our god is tonight is that
[51:37] right
[51:38] just four words of exhortation i listen
[51:41] to part of the message suddenly i didn't
[51:43] get a chance to listen to
[51:44] listen to it again i like to go through
[51:46] it twice sometimes
[51:48] three times because there's so much food
[51:50] in there you have to
[51:51] understand what god is richly doing for
[51:53] us in this hour here now
[51:55] you know he says we know because he says
[51:58] malachi
[51:59] i mean revelations 10 and 7.
[52:02] he said when that voice come all the
[52:05] mystery shall be finished is that right
[52:08] the god has to fulfill his word so look
[52:11] how much he loves you
[52:13] so we have someone that loved him and
[52:16] loved his people so much he hid them in
[52:19] a row as a deacon for a while
[52:21] is that right he hid them in that role
[52:24] and you see who know the mind of god no
[52:27] one knows the mind of god
[52:29] but noun is bringing his bride he's
[52:31] bringing his people
[52:32] forward well the party called beautiful
[52:34] message last wednesday
[52:36] i tell you it's getting that's what god
[52:38] is bringing us into
[52:40] so we know in this hour here now and
[52:42] it's not by power
[52:43] it's not by might but it's by my spirit
[52:46] say to the lord
[52:47] we're going to show you what goliath why
[52:49] david had a revelation
[52:51] why the prophet of god said you always
[52:53] come in and be praised up to be
[52:55] spiritually minded
[52:56] if you're not prayed up you won't catch
[52:58] the mind of god
[53:00] you're coming in with a car in your mind
[53:02] but we have to recognize in this hour
[53:04] here now
[53:05] jesus has come to be lifted up the
[53:07] platform
[53:08] is for jesus is that right where the
[53:11] caucus is
[53:12] is where jesus is where the carcass is
[53:14] where the word is
[53:15] is that right so noun is our here now we
[53:18] got
[53:19] many souls out there god said the
[53:21] harvest is plenty
[53:22] in the laborers is few is that right he
[53:25] commissioned
[53:25] we had commissioned the first commission
[53:28] and the last commission
[53:29] is that right they'll go here all the
[53:31] world preaching the gospel is that right
[53:34] telling them but the first thing we have
[53:36] to realize
[53:37] there's a lot of hard-hearted people out
[53:39] there there's a lot of unbelief people
[53:42] out there okay so we have to deal with
[53:44] these things but we'll show you the way
[53:46] that the lord has given what he has
[53:48] given us in this hour here and now
[53:52] you just pray with me cause it's
[53:54] something that produces in
[53:56] an effect result or consequence
[54:00] it says the interest of a person or
[54:02] group
[54:03] engaged in a struggle all right so we're
[54:06] going to see
[54:07] about david and we're going to look at
[54:09] goliath a familiar
[54:11] passage of the scriptures here tonight
[54:13] but we pray that you got your spiritual
[54:15] caps on
[54:16] and realize that who david knew who he
[54:20] was
[54:20] i believe when the prophet of god
[54:22] preached this message
[54:24] he was seeing us is that right he was
[54:26] preaching
[54:27] he was seeing far off he was seeing in
[54:30] the laodicea
[54:31] age he was sin because the things that
[54:34] that was
[54:35] being implemented to david is that right
[54:38] it's only to be implemented in this time
[54:41] because the bible said
[54:43] he was called by god he was anointed by
[54:45] god
[54:46] he was elected by god he was chosen by
[54:48] god
[54:49] he was positioned by god that's what oh
[54:52] brother steve he was hitting right in
[54:54] that area about them gifts
[54:55] he was in that area is that right those
[54:58] gifts are calling are still without
[55:00] repentance
[55:01] is that right the gift is already there
[55:03] inside of you
[55:04] huh hallelujah
[55:09] through samuel 29 he said david said
[55:12] what have i now done is there not a
[55:16] cause
[55:17] before we start reading here in 17 let's
[55:20] give you a preview
[55:21] we know that god that as the lord had
[55:25] been sharing with us
[55:26] months ago they didn't say they didn't
[55:28] want the word of the prophet
[55:30] but it really wasn't the word of the
[55:32] prophet because the word of the prophet
[55:34] is the word of god so they really didn't
[55:36] want god
[55:38] that's all the holy spirit was saying
[55:39] sunday morning that the battle is not
[55:42] ours but it's who is god is that right
[55:45] you know about that we're looking at
[55:46] amateur i see why he was working with
[55:48] that amalekite he was the grand son of
[55:51] esau
[55:52] and you know he saw hated jacob is that
[55:54] right so we got to
[55:55] understand what we're really up against
[55:58] we're not up against flesh and blood
[56:00] you're up against demon forces you're up
[56:02] against jealousy
[56:04] you're up against envy you're up against
[56:06] strife these demon forces is right now
[56:08] they're now
[56:09] so we have to understand we wrestle not
[56:11] against flesh and blood
[56:13] but against principality and power in
[56:15] wickedness where in high places
[56:17] so he instructed you he instructed me to
[56:20] put on what
[56:21] the whole armor of god is that right
[56:24] and so you and me able to withstand the
[56:27] wiles of the devil
[56:29] in the end time is that right but we're
[56:31] going to show you
[56:32] no demon forces should be able to stand
[56:35] up against god's
[56:36] children now you push it back anything
[56:39] because you said
[56:40] what i received you my brother by the
[56:43] mercies of god and
[56:44] for getting out of god's mercy
[56:46] forgetting not god's benefits
[56:49] i can heal i hear i'm a healer i'm a
[56:51] jehovah raphae
[56:53] i'm a healer of all thy diseases all
[56:55] died that sickness
[56:57] nothing can sit up in the presence of
[56:58] god nothing sits there
[57:03] we just bring a few words of
[57:04] encouragement tonight but every time i
[57:06] get up there i've been waiting for this
[57:08] message brother steve
[57:09] because the devil don't stand a chance
[57:10] is that right no sir the devil don't
[57:13] stand the chance with this hair
[57:14] you don't have to be afraid of no demon
[57:16] forces speak the word
[57:18] in god on it according to his will
[57:21] hallelujah
[57:23] he said now look let's look at uh
[57:26] chapter 17
[57:28] and let's start at verse 17.
[57:31] i'll tell you what for the sake of time
[57:33] let's come down to verse 20.
[57:35] he says and david rose up early in the
[57:38] morning
[57:39] and left the sheep with the keeper and
[57:41] looked and went as jesse had commanded
[57:43] him
[57:44] and he came to trench as host
[57:47] was going forth to fight and shout for
[57:50] the battle
[57:51] now remember they got themselves in this
[57:53] situation because they started looking
[57:55] at the world
[57:56] they did not want what god gave them
[57:59] they wanted a king
[58:01] so you have to understand children you
[58:04] children are here you're special you're
[58:06] just like shattered
[58:07] me shaking have been the goat the devil
[58:10] recognizes something different than you
[58:12] the devil recognizes something special
[58:14] there so you don't look at we don't want
[58:16] the things of the world
[58:18] that's why you come up in here see
[58:20] that's why i said david was positioned
[58:22] when they come in i cannot take brother
[58:24] uh uh
[58:25] abel's position brothers john's position
[58:27] is that right
[58:28] god have anointed them to be in that
[58:30] position
[58:31] so they have to understand when
[58:33] understanding comes the confidence comes
[58:36] you know you get around and i said lord
[58:38] where did these funny feelings and
[58:39] things
[58:39] come from i remember brother branham
[58:41] spoke in the message i know
[58:43] in that message he said i know he said
[58:46] you have more
[58:47] troubles when you become a christian
[58:49] because all those funny feelings and
[58:50] different things
[58:51] he says you don't know what they are he
[58:54] said you're not supposed to understand
[58:56] what they are
[58:56] he said then this wouldn't be faith your
[58:59] walk wouldn't be
[59:00] faith so the just we live by what faith
[59:04] in the promised word of god so they
[59:06] didn't want what god gave them
[59:08] they started looking around there filthy
[59:10] looking and you know what
[59:11] it wasn't even the people that wanted it
[59:14] it was it was the leaders it was the
[59:16] elders
[59:22] you let down the bars you let down the
[59:24] bars
[59:25] that's how the goats got in you let down
[59:27] the bars
[59:28] you reason with sin you reason with sin
[59:31] that's how the goats get in
[59:32] he ain't coming up in here the devil
[59:34] ain't coming up in here
[59:36] because god's gonna unturn everything
[59:38] he's gonna call it out
[59:39] he's gonna pick it out because this is
[59:41] the church of jesus christ
[59:43] we are not reason with it though we
[59:45] don't have to we gonna get to david just
[59:47] bear with us
[59:48] when we come around in him and they got
[59:51] there they looked around
[59:52] and they wanted a king and he got around
[59:54] in there samuel
[59:56] he got upset he never asked him for no
[59:58] money if you go to the chapter right
[1:00:00] before that
[1:00:01] he just prayed for him he just prayed he
[1:00:03] asked god to have mercy on them he's
[1:00:05] just praying for him
[1:00:06] and the next chapter they come right
[1:00:08] over there and here come the leaders one
[1:00:10] the king is that right
[1:00:11] they start looking around in here that's
[1:00:13] why your songs
[1:00:14] that's right brother abel i love you
[1:00:16] with these songs you're singing the
[1:00:17] songs got to come
[1:00:18] to glorify god we don't want no radio
[1:00:22] song that's not going to glorify jesus
[1:00:25] christ
[1:00:26] ah you say i'm home you say i'm home
[1:00:31] y'all gonna get used to me hallelujah
[1:00:37] i got no use for the devil no no use for
[1:00:40] the devil at all just when you come in
[1:00:42] here
[1:00:43] why because it drives it out it drives
[1:00:46] the demon forces the way
[1:00:48] you say i have my times of ups and downs
[1:00:51] sometimes when no one was around
[1:00:55] god came and spoke these words to me
[1:00:58] it says what praises confuse
[1:01:01] the enemy see when you're going through
[1:01:04] something
[1:01:05] when you struggle through something just
[1:01:07] start praising the lord
[1:01:09] just lift him up on high think about the
[1:01:13] goodness of the lord
[1:01:15] and god had come down got to move that
[1:01:17] demon forces
[1:01:18] so they didn't want what god gave them
[1:01:21] they didn't want the bread
[1:01:22] they didn't want the manna from heaven
[1:01:24] they didn't want it they didn't want no
[1:01:26] one to leave they wanted a king
[1:01:28] they started looking around and they
[1:01:29] wanted that king so samuel he got
[1:01:31] burdened
[1:01:33] his heart got heavy but he said samuel
[1:01:36] that's okay you go tell them what that
[1:01:39] king is going to do
[1:01:41] you tell us what they're going to do to
[1:01:44] you you tell them you go out in that
[1:01:46] world
[1:01:46] they're going to use you they're going
[1:01:48] to abuse you
[1:01:50] they're going to try to pull you as a
[1:01:51] prostitute they kind of use you for
[1:01:54] drugs
[1:01:54] they're going to get you to smoke with
[1:01:56] them they want to get you to drink with
[1:01:58] them they want to get you to party with
[1:01:59] them god told them tell them he said
[1:02:02] they're going to take your children
[1:02:03] they're going to use them for labor
[1:02:05] they're going to work with
[1:02:07] in the fields they're going to use them
[1:02:09] in a way that's
[1:02:10] not according to god but god's not going
[1:02:12] to get glory from it
[1:02:13] but he said samuel but they're not
[1:02:16] rejecting you
[1:02:17] samuel they're rejecting me
[1:02:21] so they got there and they moved on
[1:02:25] and you know saul they wanted saul as
[1:02:28] their leader
[1:02:29] but saul couldn't bring them unto where
[1:02:32] god
[1:02:33] had saul had predestinate for them to be
[1:02:37] god had given them a promise god had
[1:02:40] brought them
[1:02:41] out of egypt with a mighty powerful hand
[1:02:44] that's why the prophet of god spoke the
[1:02:47] eagles stirred her nest is that right
[1:02:50] when they come around and then and said
[1:02:51] the eagle had never went on a flight
[1:02:54] see some of you had never went on a
[1:02:55] flight like this
[1:02:57] so you come up in here and you start
[1:02:59] letting the devils tell you
[1:03:00] murmuring ain't complaining oh my heart
[1:03:02] was heavy for my pastor sunday morning
[1:03:05] let me tell you something from now up
[1:03:08] into
[1:03:08] malachi huh
[1:03:10] [Applause]
[1:03:12] there has been no open vision
[1:03:17] until malachi 4.
[1:03:20] luke 17 30. revelations 10 7
[1:03:25] and the devil will creep in and get you
[1:03:28] to murder the complaint that he told us
[1:03:30] and said in first corinthians 10 he gave
[1:03:32] us an example of things not to do
[1:03:34] [Music]
[1:03:37] and you come in there you try to rush
[1:03:42] them you let it sink in
[1:03:45] we ambush the devil tonight whoo
[1:03:49] it sink in and then all that labor
[1:03:53] through this word but stephen i got
[1:03:57] around and then witness sardis
[1:03:59] i couldn't go to bed i just started to
[1:04:00] be my god
[1:04:03] that was the dark age
[1:04:06] that was the dark age and where he's
[1:04:08] working in esther god hit it in there
[1:04:10] you got to catch a spiritual mind
[1:04:12] about the wheat and the tear
[1:04:16] so you got to you got to realize i mean
[1:04:18] things that just opened
[1:04:19] up like it never opened up before
[1:04:22] so you don't want to put pressure on
[1:04:24] them
[1:04:26] you don't want to come in there and and
[1:04:28] and and all that laboring
[1:04:31] my heart my heart feels when i know i
[1:04:33] was self-employed at one time
[1:04:34] i worked at night also and i come in the
[1:04:37] end serving the lord
[1:04:38] and doing prison ministries only god
[1:04:42] no way he could do that it has to be god
[1:04:48] i guess god gave me grace to say that
[1:04:50] off of my heart then hallelujah
[1:04:52] anyhow
[1:04:55] he said now look when they come around
[1:04:57] in there
[1:04:58] and they look and he says now when when
[1:05:00] david now
[1:05:02] had to go with david his father jesus
[1:05:04] sent him out there
[1:05:05] with some goods and to find out how they
[1:05:08] were doing in the battle
[1:05:10] now you look at this here we're familiar
[1:05:13] i know a lot of the children are
[1:05:14] familiar with
[1:05:15] goliath but we realized let's look at
[1:05:17] the spiritual aspects what they were
[1:05:19] real
[1:05:20] what the philistines was really trying
[1:05:22] to do to god's people
[1:05:25] then look and see what they were really
[1:05:26] trying to do to god's army
[1:05:29] let's see what was really going on here
[1:05:32] i may not have all the
[1:05:33] time to get to but we're going to start
[1:05:35] moving help me lord
[1:05:37] i like you brother steve see brother
[1:05:38] steve you know what i like the best
[1:05:40] place
[1:05:40] i mean the best part of flying on the
[1:05:42] plane i like the runway
[1:05:44] i love the runway
[1:05:48] huh
[1:05:50] [Applause]
[1:05:54] [Music]
[1:06:03] 20 and david rose up early in the
[1:06:06] morning and left the sheep
[1:06:08] he with that keeper and took and took
[1:06:11] and went as jesse had commanded him and
[1:06:14] he came to the trench as the host was
[1:06:16] going forth to the
[1:06:18] flight and they shouted through and
[1:06:20] shout for the battle
[1:06:22] he says for for israel and
[1:06:25] the philistines had put the battle in a
[1:06:28] ray
[1:06:28] see army against the army now they
[1:06:30] wanted this valley that they was getting
[1:06:32] ready to line it up
[1:06:34] they was getting it in order so you have
[1:06:37] to understand god has an
[1:06:38] order and people don't want to follow
[1:06:41] god's word on
[1:06:42] if you want to be victorious you got to
[1:06:44] follow god's order
[1:06:46] when you're going out the first person
[1:06:48] you know they had to repent
[1:06:49] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:06:52] christ for the remission of your sins
[1:06:53] is that right and you shall receive the
[1:06:56] gift of the holy ghost
[1:06:57] but look at it we're going to read some
[1:06:59] stuff about david in a minute so just be
[1:07:01] prayerful with me
[1:07:02] he said now look he said in a raid
[1:07:05] the army against army he said then david
[1:07:08] left his carriage
[1:07:09] in the hand of the keeper of the
[1:07:11] carriage and ran into the army
[1:07:13] and came and saluted his brethren and as
[1:07:16] he talked with them
[1:07:17] behold there came up the one the
[1:07:20] champion of the philistines of gath
[1:07:22] huh goliath he said goliath by name now
[1:07:26] look at this here
[1:07:27] he said array now array is to arrange
[1:07:31] or to set or put something in order and
[1:07:33] get it ready for this battle is that
[1:07:35] right
[1:07:36] god has came and now he's got us ready
[1:07:39] to get up out of here
[1:07:41] it's about time for the flight though
[1:07:43] he's telling us where we are at is that
[1:07:45] right
[1:07:46] some of you wasn't around in the 60s
[1:07:48] this is the second
[1:07:50] pope that i mean separate second
[1:07:53] catholic president
[1:07:54] that we ever had is that right
[1:07:57] the things are in position for them they
[1:08:00] know god knows what kind of pressure
[1:08:02] he brother steve is not just telling you
[1:08:04] that pressure is going to come
[1:08:06] a pressure is it is going to come and
[1:08:08] it's basically on a lot of people now
[1:08:10] but you're not really out there mentally
[1:08:12] and spiritually it's already on them
[1:08:15] so we already know what did he say first
[1:08:17] he come by the way
[1:08:18] anti-christ is that right he'll come as
[1:08:21] the antichrist we have the jesuit pope
[1:08:23] that's there
[1:08:24] he's speaking uh like a what like a
[1:08:26] false
[1:08:27] prophet is that right now he's been
[1:08:29] speaking like a false prophet you got to
[1:08:31] catch these prophecies
[1:08:33] that the prophet of god told us to be
[1:08:35] careful i mean be watchful for is that
[1:08:38] right just bear with me he said now look
[1:08:41] it was array that they said now
[1:08:45] verse 23 he said and his
[1:08:48] to his talk with him behold there came
[1:08:51] out
[1:08:52] the champion of the philistines of
[1:08:53] goliath by name
[1:08:55] out of the armies of the philistines and
[1:08:57] spake according to the same words
[1:08:59] and david heard them he says in all the
[1:09:01] men of
[1:09:02] israel when they saw the man
[1:09:05] fled from him and were sore afraid and
[1:09:08] the first thing they know now they're
[1:09:10] looking at the natural
[1:09:11] but you're not looking at the promise is
[1:09:14] that right
[1:09:15] so we went to the place sunday we were
[1:09:17] there in their ministry
[1:09:18] and the last two places we've been
[1:09:21] [Music]
[1:09:23] just sitting there with masters on their
[1:09:25] face
[1:09:28] and i'm sitting in there now there mrs
[1:09:30] church is getting ready to rapture out
[1:09:32] of here
[1:09:34] and you're sitting there with those
[1:09:36] masses on your face
[1:09:38] and you want a sinner and believe that
[1:09:40] you're god
[1:09:41] as great as this god that we saw with
[1:09:43] these heathens
[1:09:46] huh you want them to believe that our
[1:09:49] god is jehovah raphae
[1:09:51] the lord thy god i can heal of all of
[1:09:53] thy diseases
[1:09:55] we want it we want them to believe them
[1:09:58] we want them to believe
[1:09:59] god can deliver them from drugs god can
[1:10:01] deliver them from alcohol
[1:10:03] see you've got to understand your
[1:10:05] commission that's why the prophet of god
[1:10:07] said
[1:10:07] earnestly contending for the faith that
[1:10:10] was once delivered to the saints
[1:10:12] why because the first commission when he
[1:10:15] said peter
[1:10:17] john come what
[1:10:21] follow me i'm going to teach you how to
[1:10:25] win
[1:10:25] souls peter ah that was the first
[1:10:28] message that was given to them huh we
[1:10:31] want to read some what the prophet said
[1:10:33] here too
[1:10:35] but it's being neglected
[1:10:37] [Music]
[1:10:39] it's being neglected and this is our
[1:10:41] hour so god can get glory
[1:10:45] he's going to get the glory right now
[1:10:47] he's preparing us why
[1:10:49] to go out and win these souls or
[1:10:51] whatever like brother steve said
[1:10:53] whatever gets god put inside of you
[1:10:57] you let god use it
[1:11:00] we'll read it in a minute is there any
[1:11:03] brother telling me let's see
[1:11:04] tell you what the prophet said hope you
[1:11:07] still love me when i get finished i
[1:11:08] don't know why i'm going this way but
[1:11:09] i'm following him
[1:11:11] he said now look he said he said and all
[1:11:14] the men of israel
[1:11:15] when they saw the man they fled with him
[1:11:18] were so afraid he said and the men of
[1:11:21] israel said have ye seen this man
[1:11:23] that has come surely to defile israel
[1:11:27] israel is he come up and it shall be
[1:11:31] that the man who killeth him the king
[1:11:33] will enrich him with great riches
[1:11:36] and will give him his daughter and make
[1:11:38] his father's house free
[1:11:40] in israel he said and they respect to
[1:11:43] the men
[1:11:44] that stood by him saying what shall be
[1:11:47] done
[1:11:47] to the man that killed this philistine
[1:11:50] and taken away
[1:11:51] the reproach from israel
[1:11:54] ah
[1:11:58] he says for who is this uncircumcised
[1:12:01] philistine
[1:12:01] and that he should defile the what the
[1:12:04] armies of the living god
[1:12:07] now there's all this right here god is
[1:12:10] doing let me see what god is doing for
[1:12:12] us
[1:12:12] see god has given us signs god has given
[1:12:16] us
[1:12:16] the wonders he's a brother polycarp
[1:12:19] that god watched over his daughter there
[1:12:21] last week is that right
[1:12:23] the angel of the lord who came i think
[1:12:25] brother steve prayed for a brother and
[1:12:27] god delivered him from his migraine
[1:12:29] headache is that right
[1:12:31] we got the testimonies but david now
[1:12:34] he's got his heart got heavy it's
[1:12:36] because when you go around
[1:12:37] and you see them just sitting there
[1:12:41] with those fear demons doing them i wish
[1:12:44] i could bring you some more
[1:12:45] pictures and just show you those little
[1:12:48] those souls out there that need this
[1:12:50] gospel right now
[1:12:52] that is struggling in this hour here now
[1:12:54] bear with me
[1:12:56] array a army
[1:13:00] a army look at the hebrew before we go
[1:13:02] any further let me read this
[1:13:04] an arrangement critically a pile
[1:13:06] specifically
[1:13:08] a military array it's a fight be set in
[1:13:12] order placed rank in a row
[1:13:16] see you got churches in there don't want
[1:13:18] the fivefold ministry
[1:13:21] that's the order of god and when god put
[1:13:24] that order in there why
[1:13:26] i send you an apostle pastor teacher and
[1:13:28] evangelist
[1:13:30] for the perfecting of the saints for the
[1:13:32] working of the ministry
[1:13:34] for what for edifying edifying
[1:13:37] see that's what kind of pricked my heart
[1:13:39] when i saw and i heard brother steve
[1:13:41] said we're in a war
[1:13:42] we're in a war we're in a war but you
[1:13:44] got to understand how to fight this war
[1:13:47] it's a spiritual war so when they went
[1:13:49] out to jesus when he fought that war he
[1:13:51] showed them how to deliver them from
[1:13:52] certain demons
[1:13:53] he told them about about his authority
[1:13:56] of having the authority
[1:13:58] of having forgiveness just bear with me
[1:14:04] he said look because we went to a place
[1:14:09] it was medicine i won't say where
[1:14:12] this sunday and god saved some souls
[1:14:19] all of them was children
[1:14:24] it was all children struggling
[1:14:28] in this world today
[1:14:32] because if god they know
[1:14:37] this god that we serve we serve them for
[1:14:40] a year
[1:14:41] is able to save your soul we're telling
[1:14:42] we're able to save your soul
[1:14:45] they able to heal your body they to
[1:14:48] provide your needs
[1:14:50] your food your transportation your
[1:14:52] health
[1:14:55] it's a big struggle going on right there
[1:14:57] with them
[1:14:58] with these children they're around in
[1:15:01] there there's so many
[1:15:02] well let me read this here and i i don't
[1:15:04] want to get help me lord
[1:15:07] hallelujah he says in the and
[1:15:10] and he says defile the armies of the
[1:15:13] living god
[1:15:15] now we're talking about a army
[1:15:18] or ranking or order
[1:15:22] but here it's a spiritual
[1:15:26] definition of this when you go look in
[1:15:29] that army if you look up the hebrews
[1:15:32] i'mma read it to you
[1:15:39] it says disposing ranking in order
[1:15:44] is a pile of wood in order i won't have
[1:15:47] time to go through all those scriptures
[1:15:48] and go to judges in six you can go to
[1:15:50] genesis 22 and 9
[1:15:52] you go to first samuel 17. it's a battle
[1:15:55] set
[1:15:56] in array but it's also
[1:15:59] it's lamps range in order
[1:16:04] that's something bruh steve you're gonna
[1:16:05] have to grab a hold of because
[1:16:07] it's in exodus 39 and
[1:16:11] 37. and where it ran you two
[1:16:16] is those candlesticks
[1:16:20] and then those candlesticks it took me
[1:16:23] to those church ages
[1:16:24] that's why i was telling you it's
[1:16:26] something god gave you in sardis
[1:16:30] and is therein is in and only god
[1:16:34] and only god can reveal the supernatural
[1:16:37] spiritual things what you're getting now
[1:16:42] don't be ungrateful don't start
[1:16:44] murmuring
[1:16:45] don't start looking at the time don't be
[1:16:47] concerned about these things now
[1:16:52] i don't know why i'm going this way but
[1:16:53] it's not even in my notes
[1:16:55] but because we have to recognize in this
[1:16:58] hour
[1:16:59] hour here now what god has commissioned
[1:17:01] us to do
[1:17:02] these are divine commandments
[1:17:07] he said look he said
[1:17:11] let me let you read it first turn to
[1:17:12] exodus 39.
[1:17:16] god want to slow it down let him slow it
[1:17:18] down have your way lord
[1:17:29] and
[1:17:32] we'll just read verse 36 and 37
[1:17:35] it says the table and all the vessels
[1:17:37] thereof and the showbread
[1:17:39] the pure candlesticks with the lamps
[1:17:41] thereof
[1:17:42] even with the lamps to be set in order
[1:17:45] and all the vessels
[1:17:47] thereof and the oil were oil for light
[1:17:53] that was one this this is the order that
[1:17:56] god
[1:17:57] has brought us in now bill rebuilding
[1:17:59] this house
[1:18:00] god is built in this house spiritually
[1:18:03] he's building this house
[1:18:05] and in this candlesticks remember there
[1:18:07] was a type of those church ages
[1:18:10] he says i'll read i won't read all i
[1:18:12] already wanted to quote so y'all know
[1:18:14] that i'm i'm in line
[1:18:16] with what the prophet said he says the
[1:18:19] end of this
[1:18:20] verse he said let's read it this come
[1:18:22] out of the patmos vision
[1:18:24] in 60. he says and being turned i saw
[1:18:28] seven golden candlesticks he says in the
[1:18:30] midst of the seven golden candlesticks
[1:18:33] one like the son of man he says my did
[1:18:36] you notice the stars
[1:18:37] candlesticks lamps what does that mean
[1:18:41] what does this mean that the
[1:18:43] dispensation that we are living in
[1:18:46] is nighttime candles and lights
[1:18:50] and stars mean night he says and what
[1:18:53] does a star do it reflects the light of
[1:18:55] the sun
[1:18:56] until the sun returns blessed be the
[1:18:59] name of the lord
[1:19:00] and a true minister of god don't reflect
[1:19:03] some flashlight some match them some
[1:19:06] shock or burning
[1:19:08] he reflects the golden rays of the
[1:19:10] christ
[1:19:11] of the christ to the church that he is
[1:19:14] the same
[1:19:15] he's alive and he's shining on me
[1:19:19] he said that's the light he reflects the
[1:19:21] star reflects the light of the sun
[1:19:24] so we're reflecting the light of the son
[1:19:26] of god doing the same thing
[1:19:28] he did giving light what what
[1:19:31] kind of light the gospel lights
[1:19:38] look what he said here
[1:19:45] this is our prophet brother branham is
[1:19:47] here we still
[1:19:48] this is uh david the great mighty
[1:19:51] warrior
[1:19:53] it says it says we're speaking on the
[1:19:56] same thing that gifts and calling are
[1:19:58] without repentance
[1:19:59] it's god's election and for knowledge is
[1:20:02] what makes the thing so
[1:20:05] it says if we have a desire the bible
[1:20:07] said it's not
[1:20:09] it's not with him willeth or him that
[1:20:11] run us but it's god that showeth mercy
[1:20:15] it's not whether you will or whether you
[1:20:18] won't or
[1:20:19] whether you desire it it's whether it is
[1:20:22] god's will or not
[1:20:25] he says then we have to find out god's
[1:20:27] will
[1:20:28] and if it's that perfect we can find
[1:20:32] i mean we can just set our faith
[1:20:35] and to that and say this is it
[1:20:40] and we can run right on the way the will
[1:20:42] of god
[1:20:44] he said look what he said he says then
[1:20:46] that's what happened
[1:20:47] to pentecost he said that's what
[1:20:51] happened
[1:20:51] to you pentecost people when you thought
[1:20:53] well the rest of the churches they all
[1:20:55] go to shows
[1:20:56] he says their women cut their hairs off
[1:20:59] and they wear short dresses
[1:21:01] and say they're christians why can't we
[1:21:05] i don't know why i'm going this way but

[1:28:12] branham
[1:28:14] he said i haven't got nothing against
[1:28:16] seminaries they're all right he said but
[1:28:17] jesus never could
[1:28:18] neither never commissioned us to do that
[1:28:20] he never said bill
[1:28:22] the church would have seminaries he said
[1:28:24] he never said build hospitals or school
[1:28:26] but they're all right remember i have
[1:28:28] nothing against him he said but the very
[1:28:30] principle
[1:28:31] that he said for us to do we we've
[1:28:34] let down and took secondary
[1:28:40] we have we have built great hospitals
[1:28:42] schools other things
[1:28:44] a spiritual condition he said one of the
[1:28:46] men who passed by me around seeing
[1:28:48] a few places and said well we know where
[1:28:51] where there is divine healer at
[1:28:54] let me drop down here david was born
[1:28:58] for a purpose you have been born
[1:29:03] for a purpose you've been called by god
[1:29:06] amen you have been selected by god
[1:29:10] you have been appointed by god you have
[1:29:13] been commissioned by god
[1:29:18] what he was telling david is what he
[1:29:20] already saw in us
[1:29:23] he's moving us he's moving the pastor
[1:29:26] and so you can be able to have that
[1:29:28] spoken word
[1:29:29] amen that's what he's coming to
[1:29:33] but you cannot handle it without
[1:29:36] character
[1:29:38] had a man come to my house he's two
[1:29:40] three times said he was gonna come
[1:29:42] he didn't he didn't come i went till
[1:29:45] eight i went to a scale eight on him
[1:29:48] been around there i felt bad
[1:29:52] i went and prayed as god was showing me
[1:29:56] lord he said you still need some more
[1:29:58] work
[1:30:00] he might have been wrong but i didn't
[1:30:01] show him jesus
[1:30:04] when he came there to the house
[1:30:07] he said you want to ask me to come in i
[1:30:09] said hey come on in
[1:30:12] he said i'm so sorry i'm so i said no
[1:30:15] i'm sorry i said god use you
[1:30:20] to show me what was in me
[1:30:28] he showed me if you don't get in your
[1:30:32] position
[1:30:32] and do just what i commissioned you to
[1:30:35] do
[1:30:38] that's why you're getting these funny
[1:30:39] feelings
[1:30:43] and busted that's why i was sitting
[1:30:44] there look standing back there looking
[1:30:45] at you was hitting it right on the money
[1:30:47] i said okay lord
[1:30:49] that you i'm doing what you want me to
[1:30:51] do
[1:30:53] because that's my business it's seeking
[1:30:56] souls
[1:30:59] when i was in that drug world when i was
[1:31:02] on that heroin
[1:31:04] when i was out there in the streets when
[1:31:06] i was struggling
[1:31:08] i remember a man told me oh pentecostal
[1:31:11] preacher
[1:31:12] said boy way to get tired of this life
[1:31:18] he said call on jesus
[1:31:22] that's all he told me
[1:31:27] and until you get tired of being tired
[1:31:33] and realize that the grace and the mercy
[1:31:36] that's been extended to you
[1:31:38] and the condition that the people are in
[1:31:40] i wish i could show you those pictures
[1:31:41] we're one of the fastest growing cities
[1:31:43] in america
[1:31:44] and you ought to see all those people
[1:31:45] downtown living in tents
[1:31:48] on the entrance of charlotte
[1:31:56] that's why my heart was heavy
[1:32:00] and that's why god has given me the
[1:32:02] opportunity
[1:32:04] to move when you're used to seeing
[1:32:07] murderers
[1:32:08] a man know he's facing a life sentence
[1:32:12] and he's sitting up in bible study
[1:32:15] and then after that bible study and when
[1:32:18] you
[1:32:18] get there and you may see him in another
[1:32:20] institution
[1:32:22] and you're in that room having bible
[1:32:23] study and the man faces 25 years
[1:32:26] and he come knocking on your door and
[1:32:28] other inmates
[1:32:30] it's tough for a man to cry in jail now
[1:32:33] and come in and knock on the door
[1:32:36] he said brother glenn brother glenn he's
[1:32:39] oh sorry for disturbing your bible study
[1:32:42] he said they didn't give me about 60
[1:32:44] months 60 months
[1:32:46] crying
[1:32:50] thanking god
[1:32:53] seeing them around a man
[1:32:58] took advantage of his mother-in-law
[1:33:04] was sitting there in prison
[1:33:08] came home drunk he was working two jobs
[1:33:12] she was in the wrong bed he got in and
[1:33:14] took advantage of it he was locked up
[1:33:16] facing 20 years
[1:33:20] i would have never knew why he was in
[1:33:21] prison
[1:33:24] and he would come into that bible study
[1:33:27] and just cry because he didn't want to
[1:33:31] be that way
[1:33:35] we don't know the probably god said
[1:33:37] sometimes it could have been the
[1:33:38] granddaddy
[1:33:39] grandmama daddy somebody they're
[1:33:42] suffering from
[1:33:49] and he got there and he kept coming and
[1:33:51] he kept coming
[1:33:55] and he stayed in that jail
[1:33:58] for over 18 months
[1:34:02] and that's the one god was using to
[1:34:05] bring
[1:34:05] people into the bible study
[1:34:13] that's what i think was wesley said
[1:34:16] wesley said in
[1:34:18] his age he said you know what remember
[1:34:20] they called him methodist
[1:34:22] the method he said his method was to
[1:34:25] pull away from works and moving to
[1:34:28] visiting the sick
[1:34:29] to go into the hospital and going into
[1:34:32] the prisons
[1:34:37] that's why i couldn't put it away i
[1:34:39] don't have time to read it but i brought
[1:34:40] if god would have gave me grace
[1:34:44] brother branham said
[1:34:48] you want to see someone that really got
[1:34:51] the holy ghost
[1:34:54] they all always have a burden for lost
[1:34:58] souls
[1:35:04] oh this ain't no shout message tonight
[1:35:07] but it's up to him
[1:35:12] he said now look he says

[1:35:18] purpose

[1:35:21] the world for a purpose

[1:36:26] look what david did that's what david
[1:36:28] did my god my god

[1:36:36] he said david took his knife and lying
[1:36:38] down and took the sheep
[1:36:40] out of his mouth and when the lion rose
[1:36:42] up come to himself
[1:36:43] and rose up david just caught him by the
[1:36:47] beard

[1:36:58] and he knew god was with him he says and
[1:37:01] now
