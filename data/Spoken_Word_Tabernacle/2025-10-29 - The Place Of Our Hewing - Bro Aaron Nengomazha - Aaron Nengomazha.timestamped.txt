[0:00] He wrestled with God. He was scared TO
[0:02] MEET HIS BROTHER. BUT THE NEXT MORNING,
[0:04] he was a fearless, limping prince. I
[0:06] don't need his sword or his army.
[0:07] Neither woman. God stepped on the scene.
[0:09] See, he does in peculiar way. Jesus
[0:13] rejected after being a vindicated son of
[0:16] God. But if I do not the works of my
[0:18] father don't believe me. He was the
[0:20] light of the day.
[0:22] Still the light. Amen.
[0:25] &gt;&gt; Stepped on the scene
[0:27] &gt;&gt; and THE PEOPLE AS LONG AS HE COULD BREAD
[0:29] and fishes and loaves, they followed
[0:31] him. But when he began to tell him the
[0:33] truth of the word that separated them,
[0:36] they had their own traditions they held
[0:38] on to. It was contrary. Yet, you know,
[0:40] he was exactly with the scripture. But
[0:42] the blinded eyes of the world couldn't
[0:44] see it. Neither do they now. Neither
[0:48] have in any age.
[0:50] I mean, as a whole. What happened? It
[0:53] looked like he was defeated. You notice
[0:55] from that very time his popularity left
[0:58] him. When when he began to tell him the
[1:01] word
[1:02] &gt;&gt; when he could go out and had healing
[1:03] services and his campaigns, everybody
[1:05] wanted him. Oh, rabbi come over here and
[1:07] rabbi come here. BUT WHEN HIS DOCTRINE
[1:09] GOT STARTED, OH, YOUR teaching disturbs
[1:13] our people. That's right.
[1:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, I can't have you in my church no
[1:20] more, Rabbi, BECAUSE WHY? YOU CONFUSE
[1:23] OUR PEOPLE. YOUR TEACHING IS SO CONTRARY
[1:25] to what we believe.
[1:29] &gt;&gt; It hasn't changed. It's
[1:32] &gt;&gt; not. Can't have you, Rabbi. Yet him
[1:35] being vindicated, proven by the
[1:38] scriptures who he was, yet they couldn't
[1:40] believe it. Finally, he went on till the
[1:44] last moment when Satan thought of God.
[1:46] He crucified him on the cross. Down,
[1:49] down, down, down.
[1:55] PUT HIM IN THE GRAVE. BUT THAT'S WHEN
[1:57] GOD STEPPED on the scene.
[1:59] &gt;&gt; Up from the grave, he arose.
[2:02] &gt;&gt; The same thing. Paul, he said, "All
[2:06] deemus has forsaken me. All men forsaken
[2:09] him for the word. I don't believe Deeus
[2:12] went to nightclubs and things, but Deeus
[2:14] wanted to go. Deeus was a rich man and
[2:16] he wanted to go with a popular group and
[2:19] so HE WENT OFF AS ALL THE REST OF THEM
[2:21] DID. THEN PAUL SAID, "ALL MAN HAS
[2:23] FORSAKEN ME." WHY? His ministry was
[2:26] coming to the capstone of it. Coming
[2:29] down THE END, HIS DESIRE WAS TO BE A
[2:31] MARTYR BECAUSE HE kept

[39:46] &gt;&gt; I have a testimony before um this song
[39:50] been burning on my heart for a while
[39:52] now. It was about a week and a half ago.
[39:56] I was at home and um blowing some leaves
[40:01] and my hair was down and I kind of
[40:04] leaned forward to get some leaves that
[40:06] was under uh a piece of structure and my
[40:10] hair got caught in the moto of the
[40:12] blower. So, it was like caught up to
[40:14] here. The motor stopped because it it
[40:17] just couldn't go anymore. So, I'm like,
[40:19] "Okay." So, there were two sisters at
[40:21] home with me and uh I went to them. I
[40:25] was like, "Help."
[40:28] And uh the sister, one sister looked at
[40:31] me and she's like, "How did that
[40:33] happen?" And God knows I was just my
[40:37] heart was just I was calm. But I cuz I
[40:41] didn't know what was going to happen. I
[40:42] didn't know what to do. I just knew I
[40:44] needed to get my hair out of there. So
[40:46] one sister said, "But we got to cut it."
[40:49] And it's all the way up here. And I'm
[40:50] like, "No, my hair is in this braid. No
[40:53] way we're cutting it." But the other one
[40:55] was like uh-uh we're going to work and
[40:57] get it out. So for half an hour pulling
[41:00] and pulling and pulling and it's it's
[41:02] getting at my roots so it's painful. So
[41:04] I sat there and I'm just like Lord I
[41:06] don't know what happened. I wasn't doing
[41:09] anything wrong. You have to show me what
[41:12] happened and get my hair out of this
[41:14] this in um tool.
[41:17] So I put my hand on the uh on the moto
[41:21] and I started pulling and the hair
[41:22] started budging. It wasn't budging
[41:24] before. So, I'm like, "Okay, I pull and
[41:26] it budged." So, one sister, she saw me
[41:28] doing it and she started to help. She's
[41:30] like, "Okay, let me help you pull it."
[41:32] And then, uh, she's like, "Put on the
[41:34] moto." Seeing that it's already pulled
[41:36] at least about halfway through. Let's
[41:38] put on the moto and release the rest.
[41:40] So, put it on. And it sucked all my hair
[41:43] back in.
[41:45] I was like, "Lord Jesus." At that point,
[41:48] I mean, I could cry, I could scream, but
[41:50] nothing. I was just calm and I was like,
[41:53] "Lord, you take control." So, she's
[41:56] like, "Okay, I think we need help." So,
[41:58] she went inside to get her phone to call
[42:00] someone and the other sister was there
[42:02] with me trying to dismantle the blower.
[42:05] And it was as though the Lord just took
[42:08] my hand, placed it on the hair, and not
[42:11] with a tug or a pull, it just gently
[42:14] pulled all the hair out. And I just want
[42:18] to give God all the thanks, all the
[42:20] glory, and all the praise. This song
[42:23] that we're going to sing, it was
[42:24] requested like about a month and a half
[42:26] ago, [applause]

[51:02] and I say no problem devil. So I got in
[51:05] everything that I was behind
[51:07] &gt;&gt; and I catch up in [laughter]
[51:11] [applause] I caught up in everything
[51:13] that I was behind almost 99% and got on
[51:17] the scripture and when I begin to read
[51:19] the scripture and meditate that's when I
[51:21] saw when the why the Lord stopped me on
[51:24] Sunday where he stopped me I said there
[51:26] it is this is the reason why you stopped
[51:28] me so you want me to go through here and
[51:30] through here and before you know it the
[51:32] computer backup and everything back in
[51:35] place. I say no problem. I jump on the
[51:37] front desk, pull on the computer, begin
[51:39] to call patient myself and fill in the
[51:41] schedule back again.
[51:44] [laughter]
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to know what to do. Fill
[51:49] in the schedule and everything fine.
[51:52] Before you know it, this patient
[51:53] respond, this patient respond. I begin
[51:55] to fill all the holes in the schedule in
[51:57] the future. Fill them up. Finish
[51:59] everything. All that I say, I'm going
[52:01] home. Everything is working together for
[52:03] good. I told brother Robert, brother
[52:04] Robert say if there is a kickback that
[52:06] really means really what was preached
[52:08] got him and he got him really well
[52:10] because people are delivered.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Everything is working together for good.
[52:18] Amen.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Before you know it, prayer on Tuesday.
[52:21] And on Tuesday, what a prayer.
[52:25] [laughter]
[52:26] &gt;&gt; It looks like you don't want to stop
[52:28] praying.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; You keep praying, praying, praying. I
[52:30] look it's already an hour and 30
[52:32] minutes. I we need to close this thing
[52:34] because it keep going and going going.
[52:36] Maybe one day we need to push till 2 I
[52:38] mean two hours. Amen.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. God is working his ways. I
[52:46] don't even know how to express it. My
[52:48] daughter say, "Can I give a testimony?
[52:49] Can I?" I say, "If I start a testimony
[52:51] here, I'm going to introduce a president
[52:54] because the next person will want to
[52:55] give a testimony." And the testimony I
[52:57] say, "Keep the testimony on Wednesdays.
[52:59] Let's get here seriously to get to
[53:01] prayer and move forward. Amen.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; So God is blessing us and doing a lot of
[53:06] stuff. So you pray for me, pray for the
[53:08] building, pray for the rain. We love the
[53:10] rain. We got the rain, but we need the
[53:12] rain to stop so we can pour the
[53:14] concrete. Amen. So let's go with the
[53:17] universal law. Some are looking for the
[53:18] rain. Some are looking for the pouring.
[53:20] So uh let's balance it up, but let's
[53:23] turn toward pouring. When it's poor,
[53:25] then call for the rain. And it can rain
[53:28] all all you want to. We don't want that
[53:30] to stay like that. It create more
[53:32] moisture and things. We got to pump the
[53:34] water out and everything. So you pray
[53:36] for the rain to stop. And when it stop
[53:38] the pour then rain, rain, come back
[53:42] again. Not go away. Yeah. No, today now
[53:46] we need to do go away. Come again
[53:48] another time. I learned this stuff with

[54:02] coming and when when they start growing
[54:03] up they don't even want you to remind
[54:05] them about it when I begin to sing their
[54:07] own cartoons I say do you remember they
[54:09] don't even want to hear it I say are you
[54:11] the one that was sitting there and
[54:12] watching all of it amen [laughter]
[54:18] this is our convent vention. It has been
[54:20] a while but finally by God's grace we
[54:23] managed to catch him.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]

[54:29] We managed to catch him somehow. Brother
[54:32] Aaron Negomaza, you see how the church
[54:35] is responding. [applause and cheering]
[54:37] [laughter]

[54:42] finally we caught him by God's grace. So
[54:45] we we we we got a uh a BB2 bombers and
[54:50] everything to guide him until he can uh

[54:57] again welcome to spoken word tabernacle.
[55:00] So he will be the one ministering
[55:01] tonight. We love brother Eron. Such a
[55:04] wonderful and tremendous gift that he
[55:06] have. He would tell you that he's not a
[55:08] preacher. At the beginning he say I'm
[55:09] not a preacher. I'm not a preacher. When
[55:11] I heard him, I say, "What are you
[55:13] talking about?"
[55:14] [laughter]
[55:16] A wonderful gift. So, let's pull on the
[55:18] gift of the Lord and hear from the Lord

[58:33] Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
[58:36] God bless you saints.
[58:39] Uh we greet you in the name of our Lord
[58:41] and Savior Jesus Christ.
[58:43] Um we can open our Bibles when we whilst
[58:46] we have you standing and then maybe you
[58:49] can uh can have your seats. Let's open
[58:53] tonight from um let's start with Isaiah
[58:57] chapter 51.
[58:59] verse verse one.
[59:02] If you have it, you can say
[59:04] &gt;&gt; amen.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; All right. Isaiah chapter 51 verse1, the
[59:12] Bible says,
[59:14] "Harken unto me, ye that follow after
[59:16] righteousness."
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Look, look unto the rock.
[59:23] Look unto the rock whence you are healed
[59:27] &gt;&gt; and to the hole of the pit whence you
[59:29] are digged.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Look unto Abraham your father.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; And unto Sarah that bare you.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; For I called him alone and blessed him.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; And increased him.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. One thing you will notice here,
[59:44] the Bible says, look to the rock from
[59:46] which you are healed. Right.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; And then the the Bible explains itself.
[59:51] Scripture inter interprets scripture.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; He says, "Look unto Abraham.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Look unto Sarah."
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; And he says, "I called him alone."
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; It's not a group revelation. It's an
[1:00:04] individual revelation
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; and blessed him
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; and increased him.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Let us also read in Genesis chapter 35
[1:00:14] verse 1.
[1:00:18] Genesis 35:1. If you have it, you can
[1:00:20] say
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother.
[1:00:25] The Bible says, "And God said unto
[1:00:27] Jacob, arise and go up to Bethl
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; and dwell there,
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; and make thee an make there an outer
[1:00:34] unto God, that appeared unto thee when
[1:00:38] thou fledest from the face of Esau thy
[1:00:42] brother."
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Isn't God wonderful to remember?
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. every event in our life in in in
[1:00:48] crystal detail.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; You know, we may forget where we where
[1:00:52] where we were running away from, but God
[1:00:54] remembers.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; May God bless the reading of his word.
[1:00:57] You may have your seat.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; It's a privilege and a joy to be back in
[1:01:03] the house of the Lord.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. After a bit of a sabbatical
[1:01:09] preacher,
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; I was asking the Lord, "Lord, am I still
[1:01:15] in the message?
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord.
[1:01:20] If I've left the message, bring me back,
[1:01:22] Lord."
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; You know, when David was uh banished
[1:01:29] from Jerusalem,
[1:01:32] he was crying walking up the hill. So I
[1:01:35] felt like David.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; I said, "But I know one day I'll I'll
[1:01:40] come back to the house of the Lord."
[1:01:43] You know, there there are places where
[1:01:45] if you don't go back, it's okay. You
[1:01:47] know, there's McDonald's. If if you
[1:01:49] don't have to go back, it's it's all
[1:01:51] right.
[1:01:53] But then there are some places that uh
[1:01:55] you you always have, you know, in your
[1:01:57] heart. And
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; if they say you can't come back there,
[1:02:00] then it's a it's a problem.
[1:02:04] So, so we we love the church and we love
[1:02:06] your we love your pastor
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; and we love the worship and uh and thank
[1:02:11] you all so much for your stand in the
[1:02:12] word
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; and uh we we especially love those who
[1:02:16] invite us to their weddings. [laughter]
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; We always ask for for a special blessing
[1:02:25] for them.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I've been trying to cut
[1:02:30] all my calories, but one thing I've
[1:02:32] noticed is that for church dinners and
[1:02:35] weddings, I don't have to worry about
[1:02:37] those calories,
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; cuz those are blessed calories.
[1:02:42] Hallelujah.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So tonight being a Wednesday
[1:02:54] night, uh we don't want to, you know,
[1:02:56] take a very long uh uh uh reading
[1:02:58] tonight. We're just going to be a very
[1:03:00] simple sermon. We want to talk about uh
[1:03:04] returning to Bethl
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; and um you know the place of our youing.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; You know, uh as many of you would know
[1:03:10] that to you a stone,
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; it's like you know when they want to
[1:03:14] build something blocks, special rocks,
[1:03:16] they would you them from mountains.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and by the Bible says that
[1:03:21] I've healed them by my prophets.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; So So God has healed Israel from a
[1:03:27] mountain.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; And a mountain is a is a solid
[1:03:31] foundation.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; And and and Israel was built on the
[1:03:34] foundation of the patriarchs.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; And we are tonight built upon the
[1:03:39] foundation of the prophets and the
[1:03:42] apostles.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; And we don't look to a modern day
[1:03:46] history. We look to the foundation. And
[1:03:49] that's what Isaiah is saying. He says,
[1:03:51] "You that follow after righteousness,
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; look to the rock from whence you were
[1:03:57] healed."
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Look back to Abraham your
[1:04:00] father."
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to know your father?
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; You know, people don't have identity
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; and they don't know their father and
[1:04:09] they don't know where they come from and
[1:04:11] they don't know where they are going.
[1:04:14] But here God is saying you have to look
[1:04:16] back where you come from. You have to
[1:04:18] look back to your father Abraham. And a
[1:04:21] man who knows who he is knows his
[1:04:24] father.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; AND TONIGHT OUR FATHER IS ABRAHAM.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Because sometimes we look at many
[1:04:33] different things.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Sometimes our attention looks at many
[1:04:36] different things that we see flying on
[1:04:38] the internet. But sometimes God wants to
[1:04:41] grab our attention. Yes, sir.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Listen, son. I want you to
[1:04:45] LOOK BACK,
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T JUST LOOK BACK. LOOK ALL THE
[1:04:49] WAY BACK FROM WHENCE YOU CAME FROM.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Because sometimes when we get in
[1:04:54] trouble, we forget where we came from.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we forget who we are.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we forget where we are going.
[1:05:02] Sometimes we get a a little bit of AN
[1:05:04] AMNESIA. AND GOD HAS TO SAY, "LOOK BACK
[1:05:08] TO THE ROCK FROM WHICH YOU WERE HEALED.
[1:05:11] LOOK BACK TO ABRAHAM."
[1:05:13] AMEN.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; That's what God said through the prophet
[1:05:21] Isaiah.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; You know, because God always likes to
[1:05:24] take us back.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Because Christianity is a circle.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet says.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; He says eternity is a circle.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; So Christianity is just, you know, one
[1:05:36] story that goes, you know, again and
[1:05:39] again, but it's the same story.
[1:05:42] Hallelujah. It's a story of redemption.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything talks about redemption.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Every morning it's redemption. In the
[1:05:56] evening is redemption.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; A WEDDING SUPPER IS REDEMPTION.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; IT'S A STORY OF REDEMPTION.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; So for YOU TO PLEASE GOD, YOU MUST BE A
[1:06:08] REDEEMER.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [cheering]
[1:06:11] HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE BIBLE IS ALL ABOUT
[1:06:14] REDEMPTION, FRIENDS.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; And Jacob
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; was chosen by God.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; And he was elected by God.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; He was elected before the foundation of
[1:06:30] the world.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; AND BEFORE HE WAS BORN, God spoke to the
[1:06:34] to to the mother
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; and they said, "Two nations
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; are in your womb.
[1:06:40] AMEN.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; AND BEFORE these ones were even born,
[1:06:44] PAUL SAYS, GOD SAID, "One have I loved
[1:06:48] and one HAVE I HATED."
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; SO THAT THE ELECTION OF GOD MIGHT BE
[1:06:54] SURE.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:59] GOD SHOWING HIS SOVEREIGNITY THAT NO ONE
[1:07:02] CAN LEAVE THE MESSAGE
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD CAN LEAVE SOMEBODY BUT THERE'S
[1:07:07] NOBODY THAT CAN LEAVE GOD
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS ACCORDING TO HIS
[1:07:13] OWN ELECTION.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; So before they were born
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; God knew the one that he wanted
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; and he knew the one that he hated.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; That's right. That is why we sing
[1:07:27] Amazing Grace.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Because Amazing Grace
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; is based upon election.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE PROPHET says it's like a
[1:07:39] woman
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; who takes a piece of cloth.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says the foolish virgin,
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; he says it's a woman who takes a piece
[1:07:47] of cloth
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; and he she has a PATTERN AND SHE LAYS
[1:07:52] THAT PATTERN AND SHE SAYS SHE CUTS OUT
[1:07:54] THAT PATTERN. HE SAYS THESE TWO WOMEN
[1:07:57] ARE OF THE same material.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; But the ONE THAT IS ELECTED IS THE ONE
[1:08:04] THAT IS IN THE PATTERN.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. The one that is in THE
[1:08:10] PATTERN OF THE BIBLE
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; IS THE ONE THAT IS CALLED AND ELECTED BY
[1:08:15] GOD.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; SO EVERYONE CAN JUMP AND SHOUT BUT NOT
[1:08:22] EVERYONE IS IN THE PATTERN. EVERYONE CAN
[1:08:25] PRAISE BUT NOT EVERYONE IS IN THE
[1:08:27] PATTERN BECAUSE EVERYTHING HAS TO BE
[1:08:30] ACCORDING TO GOD'S PATTERN.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Can I drop something here?
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; And the pattern is given to a prophet.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; The tabernacle pattern is GIVEN TO A
[1:08:46] PROPHET.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; GOD GIVES THE PATTERN TO A PROPHET.
[1:08:54] YOU CANNOT READ A PATTERN UNLESS YOU'RE
[1:08:56] AN ARCHITECT.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. It takes an ARCHITECT TO
[1:09:01] READ THE PATTERN. AND IN THESE LAST
[1:09:03] DAYS, GOD HAS GIVEN US A PATTERN.
[1:09:07] HALLELUJAH. THE PATTERN OF OUR DRESSING,
[1:09:10] THE PATTERN OF OUR MARRIAGES, UH THE
[1:09:12] PATTERN OF OUR FINANCES, UH THE PATTERN
[1:09:15] OF OUR CHURCH, UH HE HAS GIVEN US A
[1:09:18] PATTERN FOR EVERYTHING.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; YES SIR.
[1:09:23] EVERYTHING. [cheering]
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; AND THE PATTERN HAS MEASUREMENTS.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A BALANCE,
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; IT'S not 50/50.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; It's the specific measurements that are
[1:09:39] in a pattern.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; And can I drop a little further?
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, sir. It was not Moses who built
[1:09:51] the tabernacle.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT MOSES WHO BUILT the
[1:09:56] tabernacle.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Moses was GIVEN THE PATTERN.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; BUT MOSES GAVE THE PATTERN. HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:04] TO BASEL AND
[1:10:07] A TYPE OF A FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY
[1:10:10] [screaming]
[1:10:12] WHO WERE ANOINTED BY GOD TO DECODE THE
[1:10:16] PATTERN THAT WAS GIVEN TO MOSES.
[1:10:20] [cheering]
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; AND CAN I COME A LITTLE FURTHER?
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; There were some things that had no
[1:10:27] measurements,
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; BUT OAB KNEW HOW TO MAKE THEM.
[1:10:35] HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN MOSES SAW IT, HE SAYS, "IT IS
[1:10:41] EXACTLY ACCORDING TO WHAT I SAW.
[1:10:44] [cheering]
[1:10:52] Moes
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; that BREAKS THE BIBLE PATTERN.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; BUT MOSES IS A PROPHET
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; AND HE'S THE ONE who brings the pattern
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; and HE GIVES THE PATTERN TO THE
[1:11:04] BUILDERS.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; AND GOD SAYS, "I've anointed.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; I HAVE ANOINTED.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; I have anointed."
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; We have one spirit
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; but different anointings.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; ONE SPIRIT, different anointings.
[1:11:21] What is an anointing?
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS AN ANOINTING?
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; And what is a spirit?
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; THERE'S ONLY ONE SPIRIT,
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE'S DIFFERENT ANOINTINGS.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; One spirit, different anointings.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Arab when he was preaching.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; He would say, "I am trying to get away
[1:11:46] from this anointing so THAT I CAN
[1:11:49] PREACH." SO, THERE'S AN ANOINTING FOR
[1:11:51] PRAYING FOR THE SICK. THERE'S AN
[1:11:53] ANOINTING FOR TEACHING. AND THERE'S AN
[1:11:55] ANOINTING FOR PREACHING by the same
[1:11:58] spirit.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; AND GOD KNOWS THE ANOINTING TO GIVE FOR
[1:12:10] EVERY SPECIFIC JOB.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; AND CAN I GO FURTHER? HE KNOWS THE
[1:12:16] ANOINTING TO GIVE FOR EVERY
[1:12:19] DISPENSATION.
[1:12:21] [cheering]
[1:12:22] HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:24] SO IN THIS DISPENSATION,
[1:12:26] GOD KNOWING THROUGH THE CORRIDORS OF
[1:12:28] TIME THAT THERE WILL BE A JEZEBEL
[1:12:31] SPIRIT, GOD SAYS, I'M GOING TO SEND THE
[1:12:34] ANOINTING OF ELIJAH.
[1:12:37] [cheering]
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT IS WHY WE CALL THE
[1:12:42] PROPHET BECAUSE THERE'S THE ANOINTING OF
[1:12:45] THE TIME.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE SAME SPIRIT, DIFFERENT
[1:12:49] ANOINTINGS.
[1:12:52] The spirit comes upon me.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; I teach the Bible. The spirit comes upon
[1:12:58] sister Yoket. She sings a song. IT'S THE
[1:13:01] SAME SPIRIT, different anointings.
[1:13:05] SO IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANOINTING,
[1:13:08] [screaming] YOU DON'T KNOW THE SEASON
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SEASONS THEY ARE CONNECTED WITH
[1:13:15] ANOINTINGS
[1:13:17] [cheering] BECAUSE AND THE OPENING OF AN
[1:13:19] A SEASON IS THE OPENING OF AN ANOINTING.
[1:13:23] Thank you Jesus.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY HAVE a certain
[1:13:31] anointing FOR A CERTAIN SEASON.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:13:38] HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; So reformation is an anointing but for a
[1:13:46] different season. SANCTIFICATION
[1:13:50] WAS GIVEN by the anointing of John
[1:13:51] Wesley but that's for a different
[1:13:53] season. BUT IN THIS SEASON GOD HAS GIVEN
[1:13:57] US THE ANOINTING OF EAGLES.
[1:14:08] Even at home, my friends,
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; there's an anointing
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; for an eagle. There's an anointing for a
[1:14:15] lion.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; There's a time
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; to speak like a lion in your house.
[1:14:22] THERE'S A TIME TO SPEAK LIKE A LEVITE IN
[1:14:26] YOUR HOUSEH. THERE'S A TIME TO USE
[1:14:28] WISDOM AS A MAN, DIFFERENT ANOINTINGS,
[1:14:32] DIFFERENT SEASONS.
[1:14:35] [cheering]
[1:14:36] SOMETIMES, SOMETIMES your wife may be
[1:14:40] going through menopause. It's a
[1:14:42] different season. GOD HAS TO GIVE YOU
[1:14:45] THE ANOINTING FOR THAT SEASON.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:56] Praise be to God
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; because the BIBLE SAYS
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; HE SHALL be like a tree planted by the
[1:15:08] rivers of war
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; and he brings forth his fruit
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; in his season.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Genesis 31:1.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to take my time.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; I went to I went to Lexington and I saw
[1:15:37] the service was like five four hours
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; and then I repent repented. I said,
[1:15:42] "Lord, I'm cutting my service. It's too
[1:15:44] short." [laughter]
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 31. Yes sir.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; If you have it, you can say amen.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; And he heard the words of Leah of
[1:15:58] Laban's son. Sorry. Laban's son saying,
[1:16:00] "Jacob is taken away all that was our
[1:16:03] fathers. Of that which was of our
[1:16:06] fathers has he gotten all he all these
[1:16:09] glory."
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; There was You see that? That's the
[1:16:13] origin of anti-semitism.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; They began to to blame Jacob.
[1:16:19] Because God was blessing Jacob.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; And then they began to say
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; everything that we have
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; has been taken by Jacob.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; That's where the spirit comes from.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Forget about politics.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THE PROPHETIC CALENDAR.
[1:16:41] STAY RIGHT THERE.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; You wonder why there are so many
[1:16:48] conspiracy theories
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; against Rothschild against different
[1:16:53] ones
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; is the same spirit.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; That's the same spirit that was rising
[1:16:58] in Europe
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; before the Holocaust.
[1:17:01] They say that
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Jacob has taken away all our wealthake
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; and all our glory
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; because the Bible says you shall be
[1:17:12] hated by all nations
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; for my name's sake.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; So the hatred is connected to the name
[1:17:19] of Jesus.
[1:17:23] AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY,
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; oh hallelujah,
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; you have THE F THE FAR RIGHT and the far
[1:17:30] left.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; They are agreeing on one thing
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; to hate Israel.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Verse two.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; And Jacob beheld
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; the countenance of Laban,
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; and behold, it was not towards him as
[1:17:52] before. It was
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Jacob was a prophet
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; and he was starting to see the changing
[1:17:58] of the season.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; AND THE LORD SAID UNTO JACOB,
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Can you see this?
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Verse two says
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Jacob saw that
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; the countenant of Laban
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; was no longer the same.
[1:18:17] But then you go to verse three and then
[1:18:20] God says, "Return unto the land of thy
[1:18:24] fathers."
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; SO GOD IS ALWAYS 100 STEPS AHEAD.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN J WHEN LABAN'S FACE WAS
[1:18:37] CHANGING,
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; THAT is what WAS WHEN GOD WAS TALKING TO
[1:18:42] to to Jacob.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; It's time for you to leave this place.
[1:18:53] SO WHEN GOD CHANGES THE SEASON,
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; HE MAY CAUSE THINGS TO BECOME
[1:18:58] UNCOMFORTABLE
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; because remember WHEN THE EGO STARETH UP
[1:19:03] A NEST.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; You may be in a comfort zone for many
[1:19:06] years
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; making billions of dollars in Europe.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Then suddenly there comes a pharaoh
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; who does not know Jacob. Joseph. Then
[1:19:17] there comes a time when Laban's face
[1:19:20] begins to change towards Jacob.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; And and many people they make the
[1:19:29] mistake of trying to fast.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; They say, "Lord, change the face of
[1:19:33] Laban.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Lord, change the face of THIS MAN." THEY
[1:19:36] FAIL TO RECOGNIZE IS THE CHANGING OF THE
[1:19:40] SEASON.
[1:19:48] Because God knew very well
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; that if he does not change the face of
[1:19:54] Laban,
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Jacob is not going to leave.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; JACOB WAS NOT GOING to leave.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; But you know what God did?
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Says, "Let me just change the weather a
[1:20:07] little bit. Amen.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Let's have a
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; let's have a change of season.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; And suddenly the the the the cold comes
[1:20:16] in
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; and Jacob and God says
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; go back
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; to the land of your fathers.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; And the way the Bible is written, you
[1:20:27] would think that God was coming down and
[1:20:29] saying, "Jacob,
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; I'm God.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; NOW LEAVE AND GO TO MY FATHER."
[1:20:37] IT'S NOT IT'S NOT ALWAYS THAT.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; SOMEHOW JACOB KNEW AS A PROPHET THAT I
[1:20:44] HAVE TO GO BACK.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS HEART
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS SAYING I MUST GO BACK TO THE
[1:20:51] PROMISED LAND.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT A MAN WITH A GRAY BEARD
[1:20:56] COMING DOWN AND SAY, "MY SON, MY SON,
[1:21:00] [screaming]
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO LEAVE THIS PLACE.
[1:21:07] That's why many young people struggle
[1:21:09] WITH MARRIAGE
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY THINK an angel IS GOING TO
[1:21:13] COME [screaming]
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; AND SAY, "BROTHER, THUS SAYS THE LORD.
[1:21:17] SISTER JANE IS YOUR WIFE."
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Sometimes God can do that,
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; but many times he won't do that.
[1:21:34] Is that okay?
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE WAY GOD
[1:21:40] SPEAKS TO YOU.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; When you received your salvation, THERE
[1:21:45] WAS NO ANGEL THAT CAME. WHAT MAKES YOU
[1:21:47] THINK AN ANGEL IS GOING TO COME JUST
[1:21:50] BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BUY A CAR OR YOU
[1:21:52] WANT TO GET MARRIED? SOMETIMES YOU HAVE
[1:21:54] TO YOU HAVE TO BE
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; TAKE AWAY RELIGION
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; AND HAVE A personal revelation and walk
[1:22:02] with Christ.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; When you come to church and say Lord
[1:22:15] speak to my heart
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; that's God speaking to you.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; God speaks to you in very very
[1:22:21] mysterious ways.
[1:22:23] Amen.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; And Jacob sent and and this is chapter
[1:22:28] 31.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; And you will notice that Jacob did not
[1:22:33] go until chapter 35
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; because one thing you understand about
[1:22:37] Jacob is that oh my
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Jacob was blessed
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; and his sheep were multiplying
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; and his flock was multiplying
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; but he was out of the will of God.
[1:22:51] That's right.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; He was still Jacob.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; HE WAS GETTING ALL THE FLOCKS,
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; BUT HE WAS STILL OUT OF THE WILL OF GOD.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU CAN NEVER MEASURE YOUR
[1:23:03] SPIRITUALITY WITH NATURAL THINGS.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; YOU MEASURE YOUR LIFE BY THE WORD OF
[1:23:08] GOD.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; SO GOD WAS BLESSING JACOB, BUT JACOB WAS
[1:23:15] OUT OF THE WILL OF GOD.
[1:23:21] SO IF YOU ARE SPIRITUAL, DON'T LOOK AT
[1:23:23] THE NATURAL THINGS.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; YES, we want them. Yes, we praise God
[1:23:28] for them. But that IS NOT OUR MEASURE OF
[1:23:31] SPIRITUALITY.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Because if we measure by kind of things,
[1:23:37] then lo and behold, Elon Musk would be a
[1:23:40] dispensational prophet.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; JEFF BEZOS
[1:23:49] WOULD BE A PROPHET
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; IF WE MEASURE SPIRITUALITY BY MONEY.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; So Jacob,
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; he takes the birthight from Esau
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; and he runs away
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; from the promised land.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; And he goes uph. He goes through
[1:24:16] different places and he as he was going
[1:24:18] out he was running away from Esau.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Then he has an experience with God.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; And this experience with God, the Bible
[1:24:27] says it was a dream.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, it was.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says there was a ladder
[1:24:31] that came from heaven and there were
[1:24:33] angels that were descending and
[1:24:35] ascending.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AND HE SAYS SURELY THE GOD
[1:24:40] IS IN THIS PLACE. And he says, "This is
[1:24:44] THE HOUSE OF GOD."
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. The place became CALLED THE HOUSE
[1:24:49] OF GOD.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE GATE OF HEAVEN.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; BUT you know what? Just like all of us,
[1:24:55] Jacob made a great mistake.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; He should have known that. Hey, listen.
[1:24:59] God is descending and ascending in this
[1:25:01] place.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Maybe there's something about this
[1:25:03] place.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Maybe there's something about this
[1:25:06] place.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; But what did Jacob do? He left the place
[1:25:10] and went out
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; back to where his father Abraham came
[1:25:15] from
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; and there he dwelt and there he went and
[1:25:20] guess what?
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Because he went out of the will of God,
[1:25:23] he suffered.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; God blessed him but he suffered.
[1:25:28] [laughter]
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; And then he gets a wife.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; He gets a wife.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; What happens? The father-in-law says,
[1:25:35] "You know what? I'll give you the older
[1:25:37] sister.
[1:25:39] But let me tell you something. You can
[1:25:41] never cheat God's children.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; God always makes it work together for
[1:25:46] good
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; because God in his great mind.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; He knew that Leah is capable of giving
[1:25:53] Jacob seven children.
[1:25:55] SO, SO, SO LABAN THOUGHT HE HAD CHEATED
[1:25:58] JACOB, BUT GOD ALREADY had a plan CUZ
[1:26:02] RACHEL GAVE JACOB two children, BUT LEAH
[1:26:05] GAVE JACOB SIX SONS AND ONE DAUGHTER.
[1:26:08] SO, YOU CAN NEVER CHEAT GOD'S CHILDREN.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; When you are cheated, God multiplies it.
[1:26:22] Amen.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; So, Jacob lived with Laban
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; and he was enjoying life. He was known
[1:26:28] in the city. He was making a lot of
[1:26:30] money.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; But suddenly things began to change.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; And when things were beginning to
[1:26:36] change,
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; God was speaking to Jacob.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Go back to Bethl."
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Go back to Bethl.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Go back to Bethl.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; And I want to bring this in a very sober
[1:26:46] way tonight. I was thinking about my own
[1:26:49] life.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes, you know, it's good
[1:26:51] to to preach and to to go to places,
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; but you know what they the message for
[1:26:56] me, I feel like it first has to deal
[1:26:58] with my heart first
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; before it can deal with the people that
[1:27:01] I preach to.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; And I was thinking, I said, Lord,
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; I remember when I was new in the
[1:27:07] message,
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; I would read four spoken words per day.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Lord, when I was new in the message,
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; I would I would pray all night. I would
[1:27:16] go up in the mountain to pray. I I loved
[1:27:19] every brother. I love every sister. I
[1:27:22] didn't care about politics in the
[1:27:24] church. I didn't care about this
[1:27:26] minister, that minister. I didn't care
[1:27:28] about things around me. I BLESSED THE
[1:27:31] GRASS. I KISSED THE FLOWERS. UH I
[1:27:34] WORSHIPED GOD. UH I SANG SPECIALS EVEN
[1:27:37] IF I was out of tune.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; I SAID, "WHAT HAPPENED?
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED?" I SAID, "LORD, take me
[1:27:46] back to Bethl. LORD, TAKE ME BACK TO
[1:27:49] BETHL. LORD, TAKE ME BACK TO BETHL."
[1:27:52] LORD,
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; TAKE me back to Bethl.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; You know, when we were young, sir,
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; we would never hold a grudge.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; When we were young, when we were little
[1:28:03] kids, we would play with everyone. We,
[1:28:06] you know, if somebody wrongs us, we
[1:28:08] forgive them. Tomorrow we are together.
[1:28:10] We say, "God bless you, my brother. God
[1:28:12] bless you, my sister. I SAID, "WHERE IS
[1:28:14] THAT GONE?" I SAID, "LORD, bring me back
[1:28:18] to Bethl. BRING ME BACK TO BETHL, LORD.
[1:28:21] TAKE ME back to Bethl."
[1:28:27] Glory to God.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; You know what? You wonder why you you
[1:28:31] know you want to know why your honeymoon
[1:28:33] is one of the most important time of
[1:28:34] your life?
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Because after your honeymoon, you will
[1:28:38] spend the rest of your life saying,
[1:28:39] "Lord, take me back.
[1:28:42] to those days. Take me back to those
[1:28:45] days.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; And the sisters tonight are saying,
[1:28:50] "Lord, take us back to Bethl."
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Take us back to the
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Bethl.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; You know where Bethl is?
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Is the honeymoon.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; It's the honeymoon.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Wait, if if if the wife goes to the
[1:29:09] kitchen, honey, do you need anything?
[1:29:12] I'm opening the fridge. You need
[1:29:13] anything, honey?
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; She calls you at work. Honey, how is
[1:29:20] how's your day? I was just checking on
[1:29:23] you to see if everything is all right.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; But tonight, let's go back to Bethl,
[1:29:31] friends. I say, let's go back to Bethl.
[1:29:34] LET'S GO BACK TO BETHL.
[1:29:38] AMEN.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; We became adults.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; We became so careful. We began to know a
[1:29:44] lot of things.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; And we lost the sweetness of the spirit.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; And we lost the tenderness of the
[1:29:52] spirit.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; We became so hard.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; We would not never let anyone wrong us.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; We thought we could get even.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; I'll get even with her.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; I'll get even with him.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; But there was a time where we were not
[1:30:06] like that. That's right.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Even if you were right, you would say,
[1:30:09] "I am sorry,
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; honey. I am sorry,
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; sweetheart. I am sorry." I say, "Lord,
[1:30:15] take me back to Bethl.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Lord, take me back to Bethl."
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Because you know what? If you are a
[1:30:25] soldier,
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; it's good to go on the offensive,
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; but if you don't come back to replenish
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; your experience,
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; you know what? You rust out
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; and you weigh out.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; And then you would live by your old
[1:30:40] experience.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; And you say, you know, I've been in the
[1:30:43] message for 20 years. I've been married
[1:30:45] for 30 years. But where are you today?
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Do you remember Bethl? AND GOD WAS VERY
[1:30:52] SPECIFIC.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "GO BACK TO BETHL. THE PLACE
[1:30:56] WHERE I I SPOKE TO YOU. THE PLACE WHERE
[1:30:59] I VISITED YOU. THE PLACE WHERE YOU SAW
[1:31:02] THE ANGELS ASCENDING AND DESCENDING AND
[1:31:05] YOU CALL THE PLACE BETHL.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we CAN MOVE SO FAR
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; WE FORGET where we come from.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; And Isaiah says look back to the rock
[1:31:19] from which you were healed.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Look back to brother Brian. Look back to
[1:31:24] Ephesus. LOOK BACK TO THE EARLY DAYS of
[1:31:27] the message WHERE WE USED TO LOVE ONE
[1:31:29] ANOTHER, SHAKE HANDS WITH one another,
[1:31:32] but we have lost that.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Everything is a competition.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Everything is a competition.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; I am better than this one. I'm better
[1:31:43] than that one. I say, Lord, I don't want
[1:31:46] that. Lord,
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; TAKE ME BACK TO BETHL, LORD.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; TAKE ME BACK TO BETHL, LORD.
[1:31:59] THERE was a time where you didn't even
[1:32:01] care whether you were cold or not,
[1:32:03] whether you were a deacon in the church
[1:32:04] or not, whether you are doing something
[1:32:06] or not. There was a DAY WHERE YOU WERE
[1:32:09] JUST HAPPY. YOU WERE IN CHURCH
[1:32:10] WORSHIPING GOD.
[1:32:13] THERE WAS A TIME WHEN YOU JUST COME TO
[1:32:16] CHURCH AND YOU SAY, "LORD, I THANK YOU.
[1:32:18] I'M IN CHURCH."
[1:32:21] BUT TODAY WE HAVE LOST THAT.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; OH, they should have made me this. Oh,
[1:32:26] they should have asked me to do this.
[1:32:27] Oh, they should have done this to me. Me
[1:32:31] me me me me me me me me me me me me me
[1:32:31] me me me me me me me. Oh my friends, you
[1:32:33] need to go back TO TO TO BETHL TO WHERE
[1:32:35] YOU CAME FROM. [applause]
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; OH, thank you Jesus.
[1:32:43] AMEN.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A TIME WHERE WE USED TO SIT
[1:32:46] DOWN AND FELLOWSHIP AND TALK ABOUT THE
[1:32:49] SPOKEN WORD AND TALK about Sabino Canyon
[1:32:52] and talk about the the the speaking of
[1:32:54] THE SP.
[1:32:56] BUT TODAY WE sit down. Oh, this brother
[1:32:59] did this. Uh oh, this church did this.
[1:33:01] Uh oh, this pastor did this. Uh oh, this
[1:33:04] sister did this.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; I LOOKED AT THAT.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; I SAID, LORD, I'M FILTHY. Take me back
[1:33:12] to Bethl, Lord.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Take me back to Bethl, Lord.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO GO BACK TO BETHL.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; I want to GO BACK TO BETHL
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; WHERE I USED TO THINK ABOUT THE SPOKEN
[1:33:23] WORD.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A TIME WHEN YOU RESPECTED
[1:33:37] OTHERS ABOVE YOURSELF. THERE WAS A TIME
[1:33:40] YOU RESPECTED THE MINISTRY. THERE WAS A
[1:33:43] TIME YOU LEFT THE LORD. THERE WAS A
[1:33:46] TIME. WHAT HAPPENED? LET'S GO BACK TO
[1:33:50] BETHL TONIGHT.
[1:33:55] [applause]
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; OH, thank you Jesus.
[1:33:58] Thank you Jesus.
[1:34:00] That was the PRO THE PROBLEM AT EPHESUS.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; The Bible SAYS I HAVE SOMEWHAT AGAINST
[1:34:06] THEE. YES.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Says you have lost your first love.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; AND GOD SAID,
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; "GO and do the
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; first works."
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS THE FIRST works in your
[1:34:19] marriage. Do the first worksh.
[1:34:30] God wants you to go back and do that.
[1:34:33] [applause and cheering]
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; That's what he's ASKING YOU TO DO.
[1:34:35] REPENT AND DO THE FIRST WORKS.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES WE MOVE UNTIL WE BECOME SO
[1:34:42] complicated
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; until we we we lose ourself
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; WE FORGET WHO WE ARE.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A TIME
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; you go in every country. The message was
[1:34:54] simple.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; We didn't have million-dollar buildings.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; We didn't have camps. We didn't have
[1:35:00] clicks. We didn't have clowns. We didn't
[1:35:03] have BITTERNESS IN OUR HEARTS. We ate
[1:35:06] nothing AND WE LOVED EACH OTHER. BUT
[1:35:09] WHEN these things came,
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; it became a problem.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; That's why diseases are multiplying
[1:35:15] among us because God is changing the
[1:35:20] countenance of Laban. GOD IS CHANGING
[1:35:23] THE COUNT OF LABAN. And he's saying to
[1:35:25] you tonight, go back to the FIRST LAUGH.
[1:35:28] GO BACK TO CHOOSE THE PRAYER MEETINGS.
[1:35:31] GO BACK TO CHOOSE THE PRAYER MEETINGS.
[1:35:35] [applause]
[1:35:37] [cheering]
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; OH, thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Aaron, I've got this
[1:35:44] problem. Go back to Bethl.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Aaron, I'VE GOT A JOB SITUATION.
[1:35:48] Go back to Bethl. Brother Aaron, I'VE
[1:35:51] GOT THIS PROBLEM. GO BACK TO BETHL."
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT GOD WANTS.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; JUST GO BACK TO BETHL.
[1:36:00] AMEN.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER, I'M DEALING WITH THIS. It
[1:36:04] might be the change of season.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Maybe you have become so so so cold.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Maybe you have become so formal.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; You know how eagles renew their
[1:36:14] strength.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; They go in solitary places.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; And they break their beaks.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; They break their tallows AND THEY STAY
[1:36:23] THERE ALONE. HALLELUJAH. SOMETIMES UH
[1:36:26] YOU HAVE TO BE ALONE WITH GOD UH AND
[1:36:28] BREAK YOUR BIG UH BREAK YOUR PRIDE UH
[1:36:31] BREAK YOUR STINESS UH BREAK YOUR
[1:36:34] BITTERNESS AND GO BACK TO BETHL.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:36:43] THAT'S WHAT JACOB WAS MISSING. HE WAS A
[1:36:46] SON OF GOD. HE WAS A PROPHET OF GOD. BUT
[1:36:49] HE WAS CALLED
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; JACOB.
[1:36:53] has been changed.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; He had he had an experience
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; at Bethl
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; and he saw the ladder
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; but you know what
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; it wasn't the full package.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the fullness of the
[1:37:07] revelation.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; So when we say we are going back to
[1:37:11] Pentecost,
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; it's Jacob is going back to his first
[1:37:16] experience,
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; but he's not just getting his
[1:37:19] experience. He's getting more than what
[1:37:22] they had at Pentecost.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; So when we say we are going back to
[1:37:27] Pentecost, we are not going BACK TO
[1:37:30] AUZA.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; WE ARE GOING TO the book OF ACTS. BUT
[1:37:34] NOT ONLY THAT, WE ARE GETTING MORE THAN
[1:37:36] WHAT THEY HAD IN THE BOOK OF ACTS
[1:37:42] BECAUSE THIS MESSAGE is a message of
[1:37:45] returning.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; RETURNING. AND BROTHER BRAM SAYS,
[1:37:49] "Wondering stars." How long shall you
[1:37:52] keep on wondering?
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; RETURN TO GOD. RETURN TO GOD.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; I'VE wasted my time wondering,
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; wondering on the internet,
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; wondering on social media, WANDERING ON
[1:38:05] CAMPS. SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO COME BACK
[1:38:09] AND COME BACK TO BETHL AND SAY, "LORD, I
[1:38:11] want to meet with you face to face.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; The prophet says in Jacob longing in his
[1:38:22] heart
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; everything seemed to be wrong.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; He wanted to go back home.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; I you see some of the things we are
[1:38:30] facing is homesickness.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; That's exactly
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; you say brother I'm depressed. It's
[1:38:34] homesickness.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; You don't know it but it's homesickness.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; You have to go back home.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. Because you can never be
[1:38:41] happy outside of home.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Because the eagles when they are born
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; they live in fluffy nests.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; And God puts all these nice uh you know
[1:38:53] the eagle the big eagle puts all these
[1:38:55] nice little cushions in the nest and you
[1:38:58] know we stay there in the nest. We just
[1:39:00] stay home. We just hear the tapes. We
[1:39:02] are we enjoy our nest. You know we don't
[1:39:05] need to fly. You don't need to do don't
[1:39:07] need to evangelize. We don't need to go
[1:39:09] out. We just enjoy the nest.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; We come to church, church dinners when
[1:39:14] we go home.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; But you know what? God says, "You know
[1:39:18] what? It's time to fly.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; It's time to fly."
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; What does he do? He starts removing
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; the the comfort.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Chick-fil-A gone. [laughter]
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Trader Joe's
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; gone.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Publix
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; gone.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Harry,
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; yes, sir.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Gone.
[1:39:40] Wendy's
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; gone.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; It takes all the the comfort
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; and suddenly you start to feel the
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; the pricks, the thrones.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Brother Stephen, something
[1:39:52] is wrong with my life."
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; It's time for you to fly.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; It's time for you to fly.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Come to the prayer meetings. Yes, sir.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; It's time for you to go back to Bethl.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Because when you begin to feel to feel
[1:40:06] the thrones,
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what it you go on your
[1:40:09] knees
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; and you say Lord
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; have thy will in my life
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; and God begins to show himself
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; that's the only way that God takes away
[1:40:22] our takes our attention
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; because sometimes we become so
[1:40:26] programmed
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; I just go to work I come back I eat my
[1:40:30] supper I sleep I go to work I
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; but God wants your attention
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; and he speaks my son come let's commune
[1:40:37] My son come let's commune
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; if you listen to the message the
[1:40:41] unchanging God works in unexpected ways
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; the prophet says
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; the I have to move to the west
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; because the last tie that was holding me
[1:40:51] to the east is gone says my mother is
[1:40:53] dead
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; right
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; says now I have to go to the west
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; God was calling him
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; yes sir
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; to Bethl
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; now Joseph
[1:41:07] Now Jacob
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Yes sir
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; had to go to Bethl
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; but going to Bethl was not easy
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; because he knew if I go to Bethl sir
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; there is somebody who occupying the land
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; and the person who is occupying that
[1:41:24] land is called Isa
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; and I have got something THAT I DID TO
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; ISA
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; SO IF I GO BACK TO BETHL
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A PRICE TO PAYH UH-HUH.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Because revival comes with a price.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Walking with God comes with a price.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; There's a song that we used to sing. I'm
[1:41:48] going through.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; I'm going through.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; I'll pay the price.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; With the Lord's despised few.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; And he knew that he had to pay the
[1:42:03] price.
[1:42:05] And he knew he had to get rid of his
[1:42:07] idols
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; because for you to come back to for you
[1:42:11] to come back to Bethl,
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; you need to lay aside every sin and
[1:42:15] wait.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's sin, sometimes it's
[1:42:19] weight.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; The Bible says every sin and weight.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; There are things I don't have a
[1:42:25] quotation, but it's A WEIGHT. I DON'T
[1:42:28] HAVE A SCRIPTURE, BUT IT'S A WEIGHT.
[1:42:31] SO JACOB HAD TO TAKE OUT
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; THE WEIGHT AND THE sin
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; so that he could go to Bethl.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; And at Bethl he had to face his worst
[1:42:44] fears.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; He had to face his in insecurities.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you need to to face your
[1:42:53] insecurities.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Sometimes when you apologize to your
[1:42:56] wife, you may feel like, you know what,
[1:42:58] I feel disrespected. But that's your way
[1:43:01] to Bethl.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Sometimes when you say, "Sorry, Lord, I
[1:43:04] didn't mean to do it." That's your way
[1:43:06] to Bethl. Sometimes you say, "Lord, I
[1:43:09] didn't mean to do this." That's your way
[1:43:11] to Bethl.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; May God help us tonight.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; May God help us tonight
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; to find our way back to Bethl. May God
[1:43:21] help us tonight to be BORN BY THE
[1:43:24] BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST, TO GO BACK TO
[1:43:27] PENTECOST, TO GO BACK TO THE EXPERIENCE,
[1:43:30] THE SUPERNATURAL BLESSING OF GOD.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; AND GOD MADE LIFE DIFFICULT IN Europe
[1:43:41] for the JEWS TO COME BACK TO THE
[1:43:42] PROMISED LAND.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Yes sir.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Because you remember it was Naomi coming
[1:43:48] back to the promised land and he says
[1:43:51] don't call me Naomi, call me Mara
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; because THE LORD HAS DEALT with me
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; with bitterly. HALLELUJAH.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; SO JACOB STARTS TO MAKE HIS JOURNEY
[1:44:01] BACK.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; And as he's making his journey back,
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; he crosses into the promised land,
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; something happens.
[1:44:12] his wife
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; he her name is Rachel
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; his wife's gives birth
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; AND AS THE WIFE WAS GIVING birth
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; because remember the blessing of the
[1:44:24] patriarchs THEY WERE PLACED AT birth
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; so when WE SAY YOU MUST COME back to
[1:44:30] Bethl is because you're placing YOUR
[1:44:34] ADOPTION ACTUALLY IS DECLARED in your
[1:44:37] birth
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; I mean it's Christianity is Very
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; it's very simple.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Very simple.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; The prophet says sir
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; when Ephraim was born
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; the mother said she shall be called
[1:44:51] Ephraim.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; And it says Ephraim means she he shall
[1:44:55] live by the sea.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says that was their
[1:44:59] blessing in the last days.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Say amen.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the blessing that they were
[1:45:07] going to be given in the last days were
[1:45:10] declared at their birth
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEIR BIRTH IS THEIR ORIGIN
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; AND THEIR ORIGIN IS THE SAME AS THEIR
[1:45:17] destination because predestination
[1:45:21] looks back to origin. [cheering]
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN WE SAY GO BACK TO BETH, WE ARE
[1:45:28] GOING back to your origin.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOUR ORIGIN IS YOUR DESTINATION.
[1:45:35] HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; YOUR ORIGIN IS YOUR DESTINATION.
[1:45:40] [cheering and applause]
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD IS ETERNAL.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; HE DECLARES THE END FROM THE BEGINNING.
[1:45:48] SO YOUR BEGINNING IS YOUR END.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Because the eighth day is the first day.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; SO JACOB,
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; HE WAS COMING DOWN. He had 11 sons.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; As he was coming down, Rachel went into
[1:46:07] LABOR BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS AS SOON AS
[1:46:11] Zion travailed,
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; she brought forth her children.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; So there's only one son who was born in
[1:46:18] the promised land and that man was
[1:46:21] called Benjamin.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; SO BENJAMIN IS A TYPE OF the 144,000.
[1:46:27] THE 144,000
[1:46:30] COULD NOT BE BORN OUTSIDE OF THE
[1:46:31] PROMISED LAND. SO JACOB HAD TO COME BACK
[1:46:34] TO BETHL SO THAT BENJAMIN COULD BE BORN.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN BENJAMIN WAS BORN,
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; THE MOTHER DIED BECAUSE THE MOTHER WAS A
[1:46:46] TYPE OF THE HOLOCAUST.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. I SAY RACHEL WAS A TYPE
[1:46:51] OF THE HOLY GHOST. When she brought
[1:46:54] forth Benjamin, she died.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; AND SHE SAID, "She shall be called
[1:46:59] Boni,"
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; which means the son of my sorrow.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; AND THE FATHER BEING A PROPHET, HE SAYS,
[1:47:06] "He shall not be called Benoni. He shall
[1:47:09] be called Benjamin because he's the son
[1:47:12] of my right hand."
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE BENJAMIN MEANS THE SON OF MY
[1:47:16] RIGHT HAND. SO RACHEL THE CHURCH,
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; SHE THOUGHT IT was sorrow
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; to go through the Holocaust. BUT THE
[1:47:25] PROPHET JACOB SAID IT WAS THE tender
[1:47:27] hand of God. It was a TENDER HAND OF
[1:47:31] GOD. It's not Bon. IT'S BENJAMIN. IT'S
[1:47:35] BENJAMIN. IT'S BENJAMIN.
[1:47:39] [cheering]
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; SO SOMETIMES OUR SITUATIONS WE MAY GIVE
[1:47:48] him a name,
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; but God says, "No, it's not Benoni. It's
[1:47:53] Benjamin.
[1:47:55] It's not Benon. It's Benjamin."
[1:47:58] [cheering]
[1:47:59] Hallelujah. Your situation is not Benon.
[1:48:02] It's Benjamin.
[1:48:04] YOUR BARNESS IS NOT It's not It's not
[1:48:07] It's not Bon. It's Benjamin. IT'S THE
[1:48:10] RIGHT HAND OF GOD.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A BLIND MAN WHO CAME AND THEY
[1:48:18] THE DISCIPLES ASKED JESUS.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "Who sinned?
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Was it the parents who sinned?" He says,
[1:48:25] "No, it's not Benoni.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; It's Benjamin." That the glory OF GOD
[1:48:30] MIGHT BE MANIFESTED. UH I SAY THE GLORY
[1:48:33] OF GOD HAS TO BE MANIFESTED. UH BUT YOU
[1:48:36] MUST COME BACK TO BETHL.
[1:48:39] [applause]
[1:48:42] is the tender hand of God. Your
[1:48:44] situation uh is the tender hand of God.
[1:48:46] UH YOUR MARRIAGE PROBLEM UH TENDER HAND
[1:48:49] OF GOD. UH YOUR WORK PROBLEM TEND THE
[1:48:52] HAND OF GOD. UH YOUR SICKNESS TEND
[1:49:00] [cheering]
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; AND ISAIAH SAW IT.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; AND he said, "Who has seen such a
[1:49:07] thing?"
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Shall a nation be born in
[1:49:11] one day? Let me tell you something. WHEN
[1:49:13] YOU COME BACK to Bethl, miracles will
[1:49:16] happen in one day.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; BLESSINGS WILL COME IN ONE DAY.
[1:49:20] TRANSFORMATION WILL HAPPEN IN ONE DAY.
[1:49:22] HEALING HAPPENS IN ONE DAY. WHEN YOU
[1:49:25] COME BACK TO THE PROMISE OF GOD.
[1:49:29] [applause]
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; But we have wandered far away
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; and we HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT OUR MESSAGE
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; it's a restoration message.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; OUR MESSAGE IS A MESSAGE TO GO back
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; because Malachi 4 chapter 4 verse four 5
[1:49:46] and 6 says to turn back
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; the faith
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; of the children.
[1:49:54] back to what
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; the faith of the what?
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; So the vindication of Malachi 4
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; is children
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; who are back in
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Bethl.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; That's the vindication of Malachi 4.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Because the vindication of Moses's
[1:50:12] ministry was Joshua
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; because when Joshua placed the people in
[1:50:16] the land,
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; he vindicated the promise of Moses.
[1:50:22] So the promise of Moses is vindicated by
[1:50:25] Joshua
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; AND JOSHUA IS THE HOLY GHOST AND JOSHUA
[1:50:30] IS THE DIVIDING OF THE LAND. JOSHUA IS
[1:50:33] GIVING OF the inheritance
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; under the ministry of Moses.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; They'll say, "Oh, Moses, I'm sick."
[1:50:40] Moses give them bread.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, we don't want to have shoes. Moses
[1:50:44] gives them whatever they need. We want
[1:50:46] meat. Moses gives them meat. But under
[1:50:49] the ministry of Joshua,
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; when the when the the men of Judah came
[1:50:54] and he says, "OUR LAND IS too small,"
[1:50:57] Joshua says, "TAKE YOUR SWORD AND FIGHT
[1:50:59] FOR YOURSELF. TAKE YOUR SWORD. TAKE YOUR
[1:51:02] PLACE BY YOURSELF. TAKE YOUR SWORD AND
[1:51:05] CLAIM YOUR INHERITANCE." I SAY TONIGHT,
[1:51:08] UH, TAKE YOUR SWORD, FIGHT, TAKE YOUR
[1:51:12] SWORD, CLAIM, TAKE YOUR SWORD AND FIGHT.
[1:51:17] [cheering]
[1:51:22] HALLELUJAH.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; IF YOUR LAND IS SO SMALL, TAKE YOUR
[1:51:26] SWORD. YOUR HOUSE IS SO SMALL, TAKE YOUR
[1:51:29] SWORD. YOUR SALARY IS SO SMALL, TAKE
[1:51:32] YOUR SWORD. WHATEVER YOU NEED, TAKE IT
[1:51:35] BY THE WORD.
[1:51:39] [cheering]
[1:51:40] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:51:42] Hallelujah.
[1:51:44] Hallelujah. HALLELUJAH. THE JOSHUA
[1:51:47] MINISTRY DIVIDING THE LAND. TAKE
[1:51:50] WHATEVER YOU NEED.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Calb came and said, "Give me my
[1:51:59] mountain. Give me my mountain." Joshua
[1:52:03] said, "You know what? Take your
[1:52:04] mountain. Take your mountain." I SAID,
[1:52:07] "TAKE YOUR MOUNTAIN TONIGHT IN THE NAME
[1:52:09] OF JESUS. TAKE YOUR MOUNTAIN TONIGHT. IN
[1:52:12] THE NAME OF JESUS, UH, WHATEVER YOU
[1:52:15] NEED, it's even in your mouth.
[1:52:22] [applause]
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; You know, Russia was boasting last week.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; They say, you know, we have a nuclear
[1:52:28] triage.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; You know, they talk about the neutra
[1:52:33] nuclear triage. Three things.
[1:52:36] The sea, the the sea to surface
[1:52:39] missiles.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Nuclear missiles. the surface to surface
[1:52:43] missiles and the air to surface
[1:52:45] missiles. That's the superpowers nuclear
[1:52:49] triage.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; They can launch the missiles from the
[1:52:51] sea.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; They can launch them from the land.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; They can launch them from the air.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; But I thought, Lord, what about what
[1:52:58] about the church?
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; And I went back to Genesis and Adam was
[1:53:02] given dominion
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; over the beasts of the earth, over the
[1:53:07] fish of the sea, OVER THE BIRDS OF THE
[1:53:09] AIR. SO YOU ARE AN ADOPTED SON. YOU HAVE
[1:53:13] A NUCLEAR TRIAGE.
[1:53:15] YOU CAN LAUNCH FROM THE SEA, FROM THE
[1:53:17] SEA. YOU CAN LAUNCH FROM THE LAND. YOU
[1:53:20] CAN LEARN FROM THE SKY. YOU HAVE
[1:53:22] DOMINION OVER EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE.
[1:53:27] [applause and cheering]
[1:53:29] If it comes through your children, you
[1:53:31] can fight it. If it comes through your
[1:53:33] job, you can fight it. If it comes
[1:53:34] through your church, you can fight it.
[1:53:36] YOU HAVE A NUCLEAR TRIAGE OF THE BAPTISM
[1:53:39] OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:53:41] [cheering and applause]
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Brother says when the weakest of the of
[1:53:49] the saints begins to pray, he shakes. HE
[1:53:53] SHAKES. I SAY HE SHAKES. OH, SHAKE HIM
[1:53:56] TONIGHT. I SAY SHAKE HIM TONIGHT. WHEN
[1:53:59] THE WEAKEST OF THE of the saints BEGINS
[1:54:02] TO PRAY, HE SHAKES THE GATES OF HELL.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; And tonight,
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; we don't want to shake them. We want to
[1:54:13] leave them like Samson
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; and place them
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; on top of a mountain.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I've got
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; five minutes left.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:30] Oh my
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise be to God.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; The church.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Lost their first love.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; And God is saying,
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; "Return."
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; To a place of origin.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham in the message, the
[1:54:46] uniting time and sign.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; One of my favorite quotes.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; He says the sermon, they can live in the
[1:54:52] sea.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; Say right there.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; They can live in the sea for four years.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; They can live there,
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; right? But you know what? At the end of
[1:54:59] their life,
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; they make a journey back to come back to
[1:55:03] their origin.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; And there is nothing that can stop them.
[1:55:09] The bears in the way cannot stop them.
[1:55:11] The fishermen cannot stop them. The
[1:55:14] weather cannot stop them. Construction
[1:55:16] will not stop them. They there's a law
[1:55:19] in them
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; that they have to go back
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; to their point of origin.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; And God, I don't have time declared it
[1:55:26] in Leviticus. He says the land
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; shall not be sold
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; forever.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Forever.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Says if if you become foolish
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; and you sell your land like some of you
[1:55:37] tonight have sold your land to the
[1:55:39] devil. He has taken your health. HE HAS
[1:55:42] TAKEN YOUR JOY. HE HAS TAKEN SOMETHING
[1:55:44] FROM YOU.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; HE says you can always
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; go back
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; to the place of your origin
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; when you hear the Jubilee trumpet.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; May God bless you. Let's stand up on our
[1:55:56] feet. [applause]
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; I say, Lord, take me back tonight.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; I say, Lord, take me back. This message
[1:56:12] is more for me. I say, Lord, take me
[1:56:14] back. I want to go back to the old days
[1:56:17] where I used to pray, read my Bible,
[1:56:20] listen to the tapes, didn't care about
[1:56:23] message politics, didn't care about
[1:56:25] message camps. I just stayed in my land.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Waited for the Holy Spirit to lead me.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Go where God wants me to go. Do what he
[1:56:34] wants me to do. I want to go back
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; to Bethl.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; I want to go back to the beginning.

[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; To the place of origin.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; How can we start prayer in couple three
[2:02:26] weeks ago and the Lord comes back and
[2:02:28] tell us to go back again in prayer?
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. A season has opened up again.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; Things are going to change. Amen.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; Wherever you are, if there is something
[2:02:40] that is not correct, go back to your
[2:02:42] first love.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Forget about what is happening left and
[2:02:46] right. Forget about what happened.
[2:02:48] Forget about how people push you or
[2:02:50] whatever happened. Go back to battle.
[2:02:53] Amen. It is not about people. It's about
[2:02:56] your own heart.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. God wants your heart to be clean,
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; to be pure, so he can pour his blessing
[2:03:05] beyond what you can even imagine. Amen.
[2:03:08] So all the sorrows will be changed into
[2:03:11] Benjamin. Amen.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; Get away from the website. Get away from
[2:03:15] the internet. Get away from the social
[2:03:18] media. Get away from the fighting on the
[2:03:21] internet. Amen.
[2:03:23] Get away from those environment where
[2:03:25] they keep talking about the preachers,
[2:03:27] the preachers, the preachers until it
[2:03:29] becomes a common thing to talk about
[2:03:31] ministers. In this message, you see
[2:03:34] sisters talking about ministers and
[2:03:36] brothers are talking about ministers
[2:03:39] until there is no respect to a minister.
[2:03:41] We don't even know how to respect a
[2:03:42] pastor anymore. Amen.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Because we got used to talking about a
[2:03:46] pastor and then when you have one, you
[2:03:48] don't even know what is a pastor. What
[2:03:50] is he representing? What is a man of God
[2:03:53] doing here? Because we got used to those
[2:03:55] things. Amen. Let's go back to battle.
[2:03:58] So when a minister stand right here when
[2:04:00] he's talking, you're not looking at a
[2:04:02] man.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; You are trying to hear from God. You
[2:04:05] say, "This is God talking to me. This is
[2:04:08] God telling me what to do." You pick up
[2:04:10] the the the the the message that has
[2:04:13] been delivered. When he said, "Receive
[2:04:15] it in Jesus Christ." It's not brother
[2:04:17] Aaron.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. He went through many things that
[2:04:21] we preach here. It was not him. It took
[2:04:22] a long time before he get here. It is
[2:04:25] God. You can even tell he's already he
[2:04:27] he he is already taken over by the
[2:04:30] spirit of the Lord.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; There's many things he spoke. We can
[2:04:35] preach a message on any one of them. He
[2:04:38] he he was completely off his note and he
[2:04:40] went completely off. He could not even
[2:04:42] control and finish his thought because
[2:04:44] the spirit of the Lord is ministering
[2:04:47] and going left and right and the sword
[2:04:49] is going up. Amen.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; It is a Joshua ministry. Amen. We will
[2:04:54] help you. We pray for you. But you got
[2:04:56] to learn how to fight for yourself.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; This is why we going through this
[2:05:01] prayer. Amen. I was even thinking
[2:05:03] throughout the day. I say I believe and
[2:05:05] I hope now young people begin to know
[2:05:08] how to pray.
[2:05:10] Because we taught you how to pray,
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; but you want to see it in in experience.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; And as we doing and we going through
[2:05:17] prayer all the time. Now you need, you
[2:05:20] are learning little by little how to
[2:05:22] worship the Lord, how to enter in, how
[2:05:25] to spend time in the Lord versus just
[2:05:27] coming five minutes and say, "Lord Jesus
[2:05:29] Christ, give me this, this, this, this,
[2:05:30] and you go to bed." No. Now you are
[2:05:32] learning that, hey, before I even talk
[2:05:34] about asking anything, the first thing,
[2:05:37] let me thank him for the day. Amen. Let
[2:05:39] me worship him. Let me ask him to to to
[2:05:42] to cleanse me. Let me repent and let me
[2:05:46] ask and let me sit quiet
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; and let me wait. I know I give you two
[2:05:50] minute and three minute. I'm giving you
[2:05:52] an exercise. But you need to start
[2:05:54] learning now more than two minute or
[2:05:57] three minute. In other words, when you
[2:05:58] praying yourself, you sit quiet. Maybe
[2:06:00] 20 minutes. Just sit calm. This is when
[2:06:03] you're going to hear instruction.
[2:06:05] Sometime he can speak to you. Sometime
[2:06:07] he will speak to your heart. Sometime he
[2:06:09] may come from a tape. Sometime he may
[2:06:11] come. There's many ways he's going to
[2:06:13] come. If you sit quiet and you just
[2:06:16] listen slowly, you will begin to listen
[2:06:18] to hear him coming up. And from there
[2:06:21] on, you will learn how God deals with
[2:06:24] you.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; Not how God deal with somebody else.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; How God deal with you. Because there is
[2:06:29] a way that I'm going to tell you this is
[2:06:31] God telling me. This is the spirit of
[2:06:33] the Lord is telling me to do something.
[2:06:34] and you wonder where do you hear that?
[2:06:37] There is a way that you commune with him
[2:06:39] and before you know it, you develop that
[2:06:42] uh uh a relationship with him and you
[2:06:45] begin to know what he's telling you.
[2:06:47] Amen.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; God loves you so much.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; God loves you so much. In summary, God
[2:06:56] want to change everything into a
[2:06:59] Benjamin. But there are things that was
[2:07:02] on your way
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; that has been blocking him
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; and you have been wondering a long time
[2:07:09] why it's not going away. He brings the
[2:07:13] answer and he's telling you I'm already
[2:07:15] there. I'm already ahead of the game.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Everything that you see around, I'm the
[2:07:20] one orchestrating everything. Take the
[2:07:22] teraphim off. Clean up everything. Go
[2:07:25] back to that battle and you will see how
[2:07:28] I'm going to change everything. It's a
[2:07:30] new season.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; If you missed the message, I summarize
[2:07:33] everything for you. This is a
[2:07:35] masterpiece, Eagle. God bless you and
[2:07:38] welcome again to Spoken Word Tabernacle.
[2:07:41] Amen.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; May we pray? Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[2:07:45] [music] approaching you humbly tonight.
[2:07:48] Father, thanking you for your grace
[2:07:50] because always it's a grace to hear from
[2:07:53] heaven like this and always a love and a
[2:07:56] mercy to be Lord [music] Father the one
[2:07:59] who benefit for such a sermon Lord.
[2:08:02] Father, this type of sermon and
[2:08:04] preaching, it takes a man of God
[2:08:06] completely away, away from a family
[2:08:10] where his mind is constantly trying to
[2:08:13] meditate and stay in your presence. And
[2:08:16] when he [music] come, he's coming
[2:08:17] differently like a man who's coming from
[2:08:20] a different world, Lord. But Father, you
[2:08:23] saw us fit to receive this message
[2:08:26] tonight. [music]
[2:08:27] not only the visible but the invisible
[2:08:29] audience Lord but I know specifically if
[2:08:32] you did deliver this message here
[2:08:34] because you wanted to do things that are
[2:08:37] beyond what a man can imagine Lord
[2:08:40] Father you went in many avenue [music]
[2:08:42] and you surely spoke to us and we want
[2:08:44] to thank you Lord we pray Lord Father
[2:08:47] that you take this word and anchor them
[2:08:49] in our heart so that no bird can [music]
[2:08:52] come and remove them no worries no uh uh
[2:08:56] trouble of life or can come again
[2:08:58] [music] and try to squeeze the word that
[2:09:00] has been spoken tonight. But Lord,
[2:09:02] Father, may this word find a good ground
[2:09:05] tonight where they're going to sit and
[2:09:07] produce fruit and multiply again, Lord.
[2:09:10] [music] Father, touch brother Aaron and
[2:09:12] replenish him, Lord. I can tell by the
[2:09:15] way he's preaching, he needs strength,
[2:09:16] Lord. [music] Father, I pray, Lord, that
[2:09:19] you give him more energy and help him to
[2:09:21] rest adequately. Remember his family and
[2:09:24] his wife, Lord. Father Lord Jesus Christ
[2:09:27] going [music] through this kind of
[2:09:28] ministry left and right and traveling
[2:09:31] it's not easy Lord sometime Lord Father
[2:09:34] we it's difficult to understand [music]
[2:09:36] but we thank you because you equip us
[2:09:38] with wives that understand and are
[2:09:41] fallen to the vision so that Lord they
[2:09:43] understand the [music] moving of the
[2:09:45] spirit that we are here for a mission
[2:09:47] and to accomplish your mission for the
[2:09:49] benefit of the bride. Lord may you give
