[39:04] you know what happened yesterday
[39:07] some don't because they were not here
[39:09] amen glory to God amen amen glory to God
[39:16] oh my no yesterday we have a wonderful
[39:20] meeting
[39:22] of church order
[39:23] so if you miss
[39:25] it is not on me
[39:27] it is on you you're responsible for the
[39:31] order of the trade so the church started
[39:33] it's about three years now the order is
[39:36] put
[39:37] amen I went to every detail I can on
[39:41] every office is one by one one by one
[39:45] one by one all the way to the janitor
[39:48] place
[39:49] so if you don't know how the church
[39:51] operate now you need to see the Deacon
[39:54] and ask them and they will kind of guide
[39:57] you because I gave you the scripture I
[40:00] went through the court of brother
[40:01] Branham and if you have any question
[40:04] anymore or you don't understand things
[40:06] that was a great opportunity for you to
[40:09] be there and to learn how church operate
[40:11] when we say Deacon what is a deacon what
[40:14] they are the responsibility of the
[40:16] deacon what is the limitation of the
[40:18] deacon what does a deacon do when it's a
[40:20] trustee what does trustee do all the way
[40:22] there are only couple offices that I
[40:24] could not touch because we didn't have
[40:26] it we don't have it active yet amen
[40:29] amen so if you didn't show up and you
[40:34] see something unusual happening in
[40:36] church do not say anything
[40:40] you need to ask first because you could
[40:42] be wrong
[40:44] everybody okay don't gossip don't
[40:48] criticize don't do anything wait ask a
[40:51] question because I laid it out yesterday
[40:54] everything
[40:55] there are things that was laid out
[40:57] yesterday that people didn't know
[41:00] amen so if you don't know before you
[41:03] judge and say this is wrong stop pull
[41:06] the brick
[41:07] ask a question
[41:09] normally
[41:11] normally
[41:13] normally if you are spiritual quickly
[41:17] you have noticed that your pastor
[41:20] doesn't want liability
[41:24] I don't know if you caught that your
[41:26] pastor wanna make sure everything he say
[41:29] come from there
[41:31] the Bible and the
[41:34] so if I make a move before you say
[41:37] something push the brick remember there
[41:41] could be an emergency bullet that I'm
[41:44] holding for a legalist
[41:49] everybody okay
[41:50] everybody okay so you ask me are I will
[41:53] check the way you coming and then I will
[41:55] hand it to you I said this is oh I
[41:57] didn't know praise the Lord that's how
[41:58] we grow up together amen amen so like I
[42:02] said every office is independent
[42:07] because they are caught brother Branham
[42:09] saying the Deacon have nothing to tell
[42:11] the trustee and the trustee has nothing
[42:13] to tell the Deacon but yesterday I also
[42:16] show you that those office can work
[42:18] together
[42:19] and I gave you a quote where brother
[42:20] Branham say if a deacon cannot uh
[42:23] control what he's doing a trustee can
[42:26] help him
[42:29] so if you see a trustee helping a deacon
[42:33] before you get upset
[42:35] push the brick because I explained if a
[42:38] trustee is helping a deacon how he
[42:40] should help a deacon if a deacon is
[42:42] helping a trustee how he should be
[42:44] helping a deacon so we got people that
[42:46] got keys to open this door they got
[42:49] codes if you need to get in the church
[42:51] you need to talk to the Deacon they will
[42:53] tell you who got the code now I'm on
[42:55] YouTube I cannot give all that
[42:57] information it's already given it's no
[42:59] more than one person have keys that's
[43:01] all I can tell you they got code they
[43:03] got access everything is put order
[43:05] musician knows what to do technician
[43:08] knows what to do the musician the song
[43:10] leader his brother John Porter he's
[43:12] followed by brother said and the
[43:14] technician there in ladies Brother David
[43:16] is followed by Buddy Caleb all of that
[43:19] were placed here every single thing was
[43:21] placed yesterday so we just need names
[43:23] for the young sisters you know what I'm
[43:25] talking about so get me the name of the
[43:27] leaders quickly and then we move on and
[43:29] put everything in order amen I'm sorry
[43:32] it's probably the boss but he told me
[43:35] already what to do about music
[43:37] but unfortunately I could not get into
[43:40] the music because I don't know brother
[43:42] Caleb how many hours was there yesterday
[43:45] what
[43:46] three and a half hour so you know what
[43:48] was laid out yesterday amen so I can I
[43:52] could not get to music it's a very great
[43:55] subject
[43:56] and I want to go with music through the
[43:58] scripture
[43:59] first dig it through the scripture and
[44:02] when we moved from the scripture we go
[44:04] through the message of the hour then we
[44:06] see where is our stand
[44:08] so you have to be a separate time that I
[44:12] have to put together so if you want to
[44:15] know
[44:16] how music operate in this church and
[44:19] what we agree and what we do not agree
[44:22] welcome to come that day if you didn't
[44:25] come don't gossip
[44:28] don't criticize
[44:30] because you might be attacking not
[44:32] brother Stephen you might be attacking
[44:33] the word itself
[44:35] everybody okay and it's the devil
[44:37] because it's unbelievable I never felt
[44:40] so much attack like I felt this week and
[44:43] right in the middle of the service

[44:48] unconscious almost there and thank God I
[44:52] got a wonderful family

[45:01] worse again and brother Kelly brother

[45:07] what I had to do here

[45:13] Freddie was there and finally he came up
[45:16] and brought a polycarb head to leave and
[45:19] we stuck with brother Kelly and sister
[45:20] Joanne until we were dismissed
[45:26] amen and I know most of you would have
[45:29] done the same thing but I know if
[45:31] brother Kelly was standing there somehow
[45:33] brother John Porter is praying brother
[45:35] khalim is praying brother evil is
[45:37] praying she said so and so he's praying
[45:38] I knew all of you were praying that's
[45:40] what we call a family

[46:41] children
[46:42] none of you
[46:45] [Applause]
[46:47] none of you
[46:49] [Applause]
[46:53] glory to God
[46:55] went to bed around three o'clock at 3 33
[46:58] a phone call I look I don't even know
[47:00] the number
[47:03] so threw me off again and I woke up like
[47:06] uh and now almost an hour late from the
[47:08] time I woke up I don't know how God made
[47:10] it we came here before service started
[47:13] thank God for a good wife
[47:23] she didn't know that one was coming I
[47:26] hate it so I can
[47:31] amen glory to God so everything is doing
[47:35] good by God's grace order is put church
[47:38] is now said in order if you have any
[47:40] question Come and Talk amen now that
[47:45] order is put let me lay this out very
[47:48] easy not complicated this is what the
[47:51] scripture says
[47:53] ha when I says this I'm just getting
[47:56] excited okay okay all right but the
[48:00] Bible say in the Leviticus 19 Verse 18
[48:03] that shall not do what avenge
[48:08] come up nor bear any water grudge
[48:11] against the children of the people but
[48:14] that shall love the neighbor as thyself
[48:17] I am the water lord
[48:21] how can we live
[48:23] with our bearing grudges
[48:26] in a church how can we do that this is
[48:29] the way to do it
[48:31] Matthew 18. moreover if that brother
[48:36] shall trespass against the push the
[48:39] break right there
[48:40] it means that sometimes we will do
[48:44] things wrong to each other
[48:47] because we're waiting for the Redemption
[48:49] of the body
[48:51] everybody okay so don't expect brother
[48:53] Caleb to be always 100 percent
[48:56] one day the devil can get on him
[49:02] let me help you spoke anyway the devil
[49:05] can get on the trustee
[49:07] the devil can get on a deacon the devil
[49:11] can get on a pastor
[49:13] I'm leaving you so it's gonna be free
[49:15] the devil can get on any officer or a
[49:18] minister
[49:19] it is not your brother it is not the
[49:22] trustee it is not the Deacon because
[49:25] trustees and Deacon and pastors are
[49:28] offices
[49:32] the offices that only receive human
[49:36] being
[49:37] but they can swap those human beings
[49:39] everybody okay by the office remain the
[49:42] same amen so it's possible that one of
[49:46] this day something wrong goes between a
[49:50] sister and a sister
[49:54] the only way that's not gonna happen is
[49:57] when we go to heaven
[49:59] when we go to heaven you will never have
[50:01] a brother bothering you
[50:03] [Applause]
[50:07] let me help you again okay let's uh
[50:11] change the cannon
[50:12] it is possible for your husband to do
[50:16] something wrong
[50:17] [Applause]
[50:19] [Music]
[50:20] it is possible for your wife to do
[50:23] something wrong
[50:26] so if you're expecting a 100 marriage
[50:30] without any problem good luck
[50:35] [Applause]
[50:37] everybody okay now
[50:38] everybody okay now so I got all the
[50:41] cleaning open okay so if that brother
[50:45] if that officer if the husband if the
[50:50] lovely wife

[54:11] let's keep it local
[54:13] [Applause]
[54:14] everybody okay so when everything is
[54:16] good and you go pray and the Holy Spirit
[54:19] sweetened your temper
[54:21] brother Branham say you sweeten your
[54:23] temper by prayer and the Holy Spirit
[54:25] sweetened your temple if you still feel
[54:28] like I'm gonna I'm gonna don't do it
[54:32] because you're gonna cause damage and
[54:35] whatever you try to say will not be
[54:37] received anymore to help your brother or
[54:40] to help your sister and once you feel
[54:42] peace then you say praise the Lord and
[54:46] then if you got a little bit more of the
[54:48] money you can say sister that's I cannot
[54:50] take you to the restaurant
[54:51] if you got money yeah uh if you don't
[54:54] have money you can just put them aside
[54:56] you say sister cannot talk to you you
[54:58] say God reach the bless you what's going
[54:59] on you say I'm doing fine home doing
[55:02] good she already knows she did something
[55:03] wrong
[55:05] she already knows she did something
[55:06] wrong so she's already expecting with a
[55:09] gun also back and back you say sister
[55:11] God bless you the reason why I came I
[55:14] just want to talk to you this is what
[55:15] happened you see the way you talk to me
[55:17] I know you didn't mean it but sometimes
[55:20] the way you talk
[55:21] could be you see what I'm saying so you
[55:25] talk to me I know maybe you were going
[55:26] through a lot of stuff at work maybe at
[55:29] home something is going maybe you're
[55:31] going through depression I don't know
[55:33] what's going on but I just didn't
[55:34] appreciate
[55:36] that's Highway yeah I didn't appreciate
[55:39] the way you talked to me
[55:41] the purpose the motives that you're
[55:44] going with is very important
[55:48] if the motive is wrong
[55:50] and the objective is wrong I'm gonna
[55:53] shut him I'm gonna tell him next time
[55:56] never again you already on the wrong
[55:59] round
[56:00] the motive you're going is to gain
[56:06] let me see
[56:07] the Bible says and if he shall heal thee
[56:12] that shall do what again so the motive
[56:15] is to gain your brother because you
[56:18] understand it the devil that got between
[56:19] you so you talk between him and you
[56:23] alone
[56:24] so far as I did

[1:00:15] okay let me handle it with this a little
[1:00:17] bit so he can relax you oh spoken with a
[1:00:21] lovely Church among a lot of people we
[1:00:24] found well water emotions and water so
[1:00:27] so when we are living like this there
[1:00:29] will be emotions
[1:00:31] there will be feelings
[1:00:33] there will be a child crying and
[1:00:35] somebody's like
[1:00:36] its emotions ah okay don't be like why
[1:00:40] are you usually look at my child like
[1:00:42] it's emotion okay it's normal depending
[1:00:45] whether they didn't sleep or they were
[1:00:46] on Facebook till 3am so their brain is
[1:00:49] not working good so it's a problem okay
[1:00:51] emotions
[1:00:52] and then there become water darling and
[1:00:56] water
[1:00:57] can you give him some microphone there
[1:00:59] is one that usually works good that's
[1:01:01] the one okay thank you butt biting and
[1:01:04] all kind of water ungodly things brother
[1:01:06] that is water
[1:01:08] in the water sure so when we reach that
[1:01:11] point just know that you are responsible
[1:01:13] for sulfuric acid can you say Amen
[1:01:18] amen it is a water demon power when you
[1:01:22] are operating like this in the church
[1:01:24] you are under demon power
[1:01:26] pure
[1:01:30] everybody okay when I say demon power
[1:01:32] there is no exception from the pulpit
[1:01:36] to every office if you operate like this
[1:01:39] even the pastor demon power
[1:01:44] we are all in this together
[1:01:47] let me turn this way so I'm looking like
[1:01:50] the congregation
[1:01:51] that is sulfuric acid in the chain it is
[1:01:54] demon power amen amen
[1:01:58] so we are all part of the congregation
[1:02:03] everybody okay including the pastor and
[1:02:07] spirit of man and women who gets among
[1:02:10] one another and try to push off say this
[1:02:14] is not right and this is not right and
[1:02:16] that is not right if you chase it down
[1:02:20] because it's a demon power nine times
[1:02:23] out of water 10.
[1:02:25] 90 percent
[1:02:27] it is the very person making the water
[1:02:30] that is not what why so if you found
[1:02:33] yourself you start making stirs you're
[1:02:35] already out
[1:02:39] you can lose your position by doing that
[1:02:42] amen amen God hates water disco among
[1:02:46] the water so who do I call
[1:02:50] you know how to screen yourself look at
[1:02:53] somebody who's spiritual
[1:02:56] somebody who's mature in the world
[1:02:58] and say brother would you come and help
[1:03:00] me I'm just picking up brother John come
[1:03:03] and help me I have a problem I just want
[1:03:05] you to be there amen and when you talk
[1:03:08] with that brother what happened the
[1:03:10] scripture says that
[1:03:12] you tattoo that in the mouth of water
[1:03:14] and water three now you begin to get
[1:03:17] back up

[1:03:24] witness everywhere may be water because
[1:03:27] when you're gonna bring your case now I
[1:03:30] have you and brother John
[1:03:32] to ask the question about that specific
[1:03:35] brother or sister whether they are
[1:03:38] officer or not but I have to witness now
[1:03:41] your case is going differently but if
[1:03:44] you cannot trust anyone
[1:03:47] according to your screening your
[1:03:49] inspection brother Branham says this in
[1:03:52] the church there is the pastor and that
[1:03:55] Pastor is water special person
[1:03:58] he's built to where he can put up with
[1:04:02] the fastest of the people

[1:04:07] so when you call me you say I got a
[1:04:09] problem with my brother I get the
[1:04:11] anointing
[1:04:13] I'm already excited
[1:04:15] you say brother that I'm ready to jump
[1:04:18] because that's the way I'm built
[1:04:20] everybody okay he's a burden Bearer he
[1:04:25] is the UPS of the water see he is a man
[1:04:28] that can sit down
[1:04:30] when somebody's got something against
[1:04:33] somebody else and sit down with them two
[1:04:36] families and take water either side
[1:04:40] and reasoning that and bring it right
[1:04:42] back into Waters sweetness he is a
[1:04:45] pastor he knows how to take care of
[1:04:46] water things so if you talk to your
[1:04:49] brother and they don't understand and
[1:04:50] you don't see anybody else that you can
[1:04:52] always give me a call
[1:04:55] and talk to me you say I have a problem

[1:05:04] question did you talk to the officer say
[1:05:05] yes the next stage I say okay you and me
[1:05:09] and that officer we're gonna meet
[1:05:10] together at Chick-fil-A
[1:05:13] amen anybody okay then we can sit there
[1:05:16] and we can talk between me you and the
[1:05:19] officer and you're going to repeat
[1:05:21] everything you taught me

[1:05:25] in front of the officer so he knows what
[1:05:28] he's hurting you
[1:05:31] everybody okay everybody okay don't hide
[1:05:34] anything we want to clean it up
[1:05:37] everybody okay before you and your
[1:05:39] brother repeat everything and when you
[1:05:41] repeat everything I will talk to you and
[1:05:44] we get everything reconciled and when

[1:05:55] viewing time to call the church to view
[1:05:57] the body that have happened there I
[1:05:59] don't have viewing time I have on the
[1:06:01] barrel time so right there I opened the
[1:06:03] tomb I put it right there I put the
[1:06:05] tombstone right there and the same day I
[1:06:08] don't wait the next day I put a
[1:06:09] tombstone and I close the case

[1:06:27] shall neglect to hear them
[1:06:29] then do water tell her into the church
[1:06:33] so before your pastor bring anything on
[1:06:36] the pulpit just know that I have crossed
[1:06:39] many steps

[1:06:44] here don't try too fast
[1:06:47] and say well that was not right that was
[1:06:49] not right just know we already crossed
[1:06:51] steps

[1:06:55] whether it's whoever officer or no
[1:06:58] officer I will bring it back right here
[1:07:02] everybody okay
[1:07:03] all right so from now on just know you
[1:07:07] had to be sweet and avoid this process
[1:07:09] amen and if he shall neglect to hear
[1:07:12] them tell it unto the water church but
[1:07:15] if he neglect to hear the church let him
[1:07:17] be unto thee as a water hidden man and a

[1:11:34] and if it's your church you gotta love
[1:11:36] that church and support that church like
[1:11:39] it's your church
[1:11:41] if somebody begin to talk bad about your
[1:11:44] church
[1:11:45] then you can turn around and say oh the
[1:11:48] breaker this is my chance
[1:11:51] [Music]
[1:11:52] everybody okay these are my family
[1:11:57] this is my father this is my daddy this
[1:12:01] is my mama this is my sister even if she
[1:12:04] did something wrong but me and you
[1:12:06] cannot gossip about her I need to have
[1:12:08] her back
[1:12:11] foreign
[1:12:16] glory to God Romans chapter 8 verse 10.
[1:12:23] God would never live without a witness
[1:12:25] they gotta be a church that will reflect
[1:12:28] the word of God according to the way God
[1:12:31] purposes
[1:12:33] not every Church hypocrite hypocrite no
[1:12:36] they gotta be one
[1:12:41] amen ah there gotta be one somebody is
[1:12:44] not there they call me oh God bless you
[1:12:46] she said are you doing I'm doing okay he
[1:12:48] helped the sister somebody will say they
[1:12:50] say I'm not alone
[1:12:52] amen
[1:12:54] Hallelujah Romans 8 verse 10 if you're
[1:12:57] there you can say amen amen glory to God
[1:13:00] all right let me jump to verse 11. but
[1:13:04] if the spirit
[1:13:07] of him that raised that Christ from the
[1:13:09] dead
[1:13:11] dwell in you
[1:13:13] so first of all that Spirit must dwell
[1:13:16] in you
[1:13:17] amen if you notice there is a Karma
[1:13:22] remember the scripture now even the
[1:13:24] punctuation means something so that is
[1:13:26] the first step number one that Spirit
[1:13:29] must first dwell in you if that spirit
[1:13:32] is not dwelling in you so there is no
[1:13:34] way we can continue to The Next Step the
[1:13:37] first step have to be fulfilled you
[1:13:39] might be seated
[1:13:40] if that first is that same Spirit not a
[1:13:43] different spirit
[1:13:45] not a different Spirit not a Pastore
[1:13:48] your spirit
[1:13:52] amen because I have my spirit
[1:13:56] amen you got your spirit but what make
[1:13:59] us common is one spirit
[1:14:02] and that Spirit you can find it in
[1:14:04] everybody
[1:14:05] that's the spirit that we're talking
[1:14:07] about
[1:14:08] if we dwell in you
[1:14:12] so that Spirit didn't just dwell in
[1:14:15] Christ he dwell in Christ and when
[1:14:18] Christ died that Spirit quickened
[1:14:20] crossed from the dead if he rest up
[1:14:23] cross from the dead shall also Quicken
[1:14:26] your mortal Body by his spirit that do
[1:14:30] water so the same thing that happened in
[1:14:33] Jesus Christ will happen in you if you
[1:14:37] are found on the same level on the same
[1:14:40] state on the same stage that Jesus was
[1:14:43] everybody okay
[1:14:45] verse that's verse 11 job to verse 17.
[1:14:51] and if children then air s of God and
[1:14:56] how John a we fool Christ if so be that
[1:15:00] we suffer with him that we may also
[1:15:04] water be glorified together so
[1:15:06] everything that happened to Jesus Christ
[1:15:08] must happen to you
[1:15:11] if Jesus suffer you might have some
[1:15:13] suffering too
[1:15:14] and if Jesus was glorified you must be
[1:15:17] glorified
[1:15:19] amen if not God doesn't need to begin a
[1:15:23] work on you
[1:15:24] when God chose you
[1:15:26] God is Doom
[1:15:30] God can come back again
[1:15:33] he cannot change his mind because God if
[1:15:36] he change his mind
[1:15:37] something is wrong with God
[1:15:40] so he didn't think correct before he
[1:15:43] make a decision so when God make a
[1:15:46] decision on you
[1:15:48] amen don't worry about the remaining
[1:15:51] everything is covered
[1:15:53] because he won't change his mind
[1:15:57] hey everybody okay
[1:15:59] Verse 18 for I reckon that the suffering
[1:16:04] of the present time are not worthy to be
[1:16:08] compared with the glory Remember That
[1:16:10] Glory so there is another Glory that is
[1:16:12] coming up the glory which shall be
[1:16:15] revealed where you know so there is a
[1:16:17] glory that will be revealed in The
[1:16:19] Believer
[1:16:20] it's a future Glory
[1:16:23] let's continue verse 19 the Bible says
[1:16:27] for The Agonist expectation
[1:16:30] of the creature waits for the
[1:16:33] manifestation of the sons of God for the
[1:16:37] creature was made subject to vanity not
[1:16:40] willingly animal didn't do anything
[1:16:43] but by reason of him who has subjected
[1:16:46] the same in Hope because the creature
[1:16:49] itself also shall be delivered from the
[1:16:52] bondage of water corruption because
[1:16:54] everything is dying now the trees are
[1:16:56] dying the animals are drying the bread
[1:16:58] they're dying everything is dying into
[1:17:01] the Glorious Liberty that Liberty is
[1:17:03] glorious
[1:17:04] of the children of God verse 22 for we
[1:17:08] know that the whole creation does what
[1:17:11] groaning and travel in pain together
[1:17:14] until now verse 23 and not only day the
[1:17:20] creation the animal the bird the fishes
[1:17:23] but our self also
[1:17:26] which have the first fruit
[1:17:29] so not everybody grown
[1:17:31] those that grown have already the first
[1:17:34] fruit
[1:17:35] amen who have the first fruit of the
[1:17:39] spirit in other words there is a portion
[1:17:41] of the Holy Spirit already knew
[1:17:43] amen when that portion of the Holy
[1:17:46] Spirit already in you it puts you in the
[1:17:48] groaning process amen even we ourselves
[1:17:53] grown well within ourselves inside
[1:17:56] ourselves doing water waiting waiting
[1:17:59] for the adoption that is the Redemption
[1:18:03] of our body so we are already redeemed
[1:18:07] on the inside but the outside is not
[1:18:10] redeemed that's why we have to go
[1:18:13] through Matthew 18 when something
[1:18:15] happened between you and your brother
[1:18:16] the reason why we talk to one another is
[1:18:19] because of this flesh here
[1:18:22] the day this flesh will be redeemed no
[1:18:25] more Matthew 18.
[1:18:28] because your brother will never do
[1:18:30] something wrong again
[1:18:31] everybody okay let's go to First
[1:18:33] Corinthians chapter 15.
[1:18:37] the adoption that is ripping what the
[1:18:40] Redemption of our body First Corinthians
[1:18:44] chapter 15 if you dare you can say amen
[1:18:47] amen it's amazing have time always fly
[1:18:49] in this church
[1:18:57] you can just say one slide and it takes
[1:18:59] 30 minutes
[1:19:00] 40 verse 40 if you dare you can say amen
[1:19:04] amen
[1:19:06] there are also water celestial bodies
[1:19:11] so we have heavenly
[1:19:14] we have Celestia
[1:19:18] or heavenly
[1:19:21] bodies
[1:19:25] in other words this body comes from
[1:19:28] heaven
[1:19:32] what you have now
[1:19:34] didn't come from heaven
[1:19:37] that's why
[1:19:39] if the Lord takes somebody home we put
[1:19:42] the body back where he came from
[1:19:47] even though you think mama is the one
[1:19:50] that manufactured it no
[1:19:52] mama was pulling that body from the
[1:19:55] Earth by the food she was eating
[1:19:58] so when Mama was buying some groceries
[1:20:01] at Walmart
[1:20:02] amen and those groceries came from
[1:20:05] Alabama down there so maybe some of your
[1:20:09] parts were in Alabama
[1:20:14] everybody okay and then the Walmart took
[1:20:18] it and ship it in Gastonia because God
[1:20:22] knew that portion of that body must come
[1:20:24] from Alabama
[1:20:28] everybody okay everybody okay then Mama
[1:20:32] goes to the grocery and nobody will buy
[1:20:34] their grocery bad mama
[1:20:36] and when Mama get that groceries she
[1:20:38] begin to eat she is getting what is
[1:20:41] needed for you to manufacture you
[1:20:44] everybody okay so that body didn't come
[1:20:47] from heaven
[1:20:48] he came from Alabama
[1:20:53] everybody okay
[1:20:54] some of our body came from Africa
[1:20:59] everybody okay he was manufactured over
[1:21:02] there
[1:21:03] everybody okay because God knew that the
[1:21:06] ingredients for this man must come over
[1:21:07] there
[1:21:09] everybody okay ah Mama Gotta Eat Fufu
[1:21:12] ah to produce the body everybody Okay we
[1:21:17] okay now okay so when everything is said
[1:21:21] and done if the Lord take you before
[1:21:23] time of the Rapture then we go back to
[1:21:26] the Earth we are telling the Earth that
[1:21:29] we are returning to you what you gave it
[1:21:31] to us
[1:21:33] that's why he goes back today
[1:21:36] everybody okay now but this body here
[1:21:43] from its birth
[1:21:46] he has nothing to do with Mom and Dad
[1:21:49] [Applause]
[1:21:52] either when it's body that were made
[1:21:55] with that sex
[1:22:01] everybody okay
[1:22:03] let's continue
[1:22:06] this is the power of the the of the
[1:22:09] seals when you hold the scripture like
[1:22:11] this he begin to unfold the layers
[1:22:13] underneath it's the seals that do that
[1:22:16] he said there are also Celestial body
[1:22:19] camera
[1:22:20] and body that I have to rescue or
[1:22:24] Earthly that is what we all got here
[1:22:27] we are say let's your body and
[1:22:29] terrestrial is that the word that they
[1:22:31] use there
[1:22:32] and Terrace your meaning Earthly and to
[1:22:35] rest your body
[1:22:36] to rest your body or Earthly body
[1:22:40] amen Earthly bodies so how many bodies
[1:22:44] do we have
[1:22:45] this one came from sex
[1:22:48] everybody okay
[1:22:50] and caress your body but the glory of
[1:22:54] the celestial is what one and the glory
[1:22:57] of the terrestrial is water so everybody
[1:23:00] have a glory
[1:23:04] that's why you spend so much time before
[1:23:07] the mirror looking at the glory of the
[1:23:10] Celestia
[1:23:12] she spent so much time before the meal
[1:23:15] they look at this they look at this
[1:23:17] before you know it they take up this
[1:23:19] phone and take a selfie so that they can
[1:23:21] post on Sunday
[1:23:24] to show the glory of the Celeste of the
[1:23:27] terrestrial
[1:23:29] then before you know it you see somebody
[1:23:30] on Sunday happy Sunday
[1:23:39] did I say something wrong
[1:23:42] so everybody has a glory there is a
[1:23:46] glory of the Celestia and there is a

[1:42:03] every man that have this water hope in

[1:42:18] that hope in you something happening in
[1:42:21] you everyone that have this hope in him
[1:42:24] do what purified himself
[1:42:30] am I reading a different Bible when you
[1:42:32] have that Revelation in you that
[1:42:35] Revelation is what is purifying you
[1:42:38] every day
[1:42:40] [Applause]
[1:42:43] everybody care that's the reason why you
[1:42:46] keep progressing in your Christian life
[1:42:48] because there is something in you that
[1:42:51] is working on you toward meeting the
[1:42:56] goal that God have set or meeting the
[1:43:00] expectation of Jesus Christ for his
[1:43:03] brother
[1:43:05] everybody okay
[1:43:08] he purified himself even as he's helped
[1:43:12] you
[1:43:13] my subject this morning
[1:43:16] is the four phases of roof the
[1:43:20] Redemption of the body
[1:43:24] their Redemption of the water body
[1:43:28] we found out that in the trashing floor
[1:43:31] everybody okay Boaz unfolded himself in
[1:43:35] secret
[1:43:36] and give six measures of barley which we
[1:43:40] already understood that it's the seventh
[1:43:42] seal that opened the other six seal and
[1:43:45] then that made a way for roof to rest so
[1:43:49] that boas can finish the work of
[1:43:52] redemption and Boaz return back
[1:43:56] you remember the returning and when he
[1:43:58] is returning back now he can pick up
[1:44:01] roof and both of them can be married in
[1:44:04] the threshing floor boas and roof could
[1:44:07] never have an intimate relationship
[1:44:10] in other words they could never be
[1:44:12] United in the body there could be only
[1:44:14] United in the world they can only
[1:44:17] exchange vows
[1:44:19] everybody okay but that same day in the
[1:44:23] morning
[1:44:25] maybe between seven and uh six and nine
[1:44:29] somehow I don't know amen Bowers finish
[1:44:33] the work of redemption and he returned
[1:44:36] back in the morning and went now and
[1:44:40] pick up roof and was United in the body
[1:44:43] and he produced a baby that Ruth never
[1:44:45] had before
[1:44:48] amen amen so between roof chapter 3 and
[1:44:53] roof chapter 4 there is something
[1:44:55] happening we remind we were reminded
[1:44:59] that the son of man has to form
[1:45:02] everybody okay the first form is what
[1:45:05] word and the second form is water flesh
[1:45:09] is the flesh amen so in roof chapter 3
[1:45:13] the son of man Boaz is unfolding himself
[1:45:17] inward
[1:45:21] Ruth chapter 3
[1:45:24] everybody okay
[1:45:26] and in roof chapter 4 Boaz finished the
[1:45:29] work of redemption now he's coming he's
[1:45:32] returning to unite with Ruth In the
[1:45:35] Flesh roof chapter 4.
[1:45:39] everybody okay and we know that the
[1:45:42] return of Boaz the return of Christ's
[1:45:46] heavy condition
[1:45:47] we saw that last two Sunday and the
[1:45:50] condition is that before Jesus Christ
[1:45:53] come back shall he found water faith
[1:45:56] everybody okay so there must be a faith
[1:46:00] first before Christ come and we found
[1:46:03] out that their faith have to come back
[1:46:05] by revelation 10.
[1:46:09] everybody okay so that the son of man
[1:46:12] will return in word form to restore the
[1:46:15] origin of Faith before the son of man
[1:46:18] come in the flesh to pick up the bread
[1:46:21] of Jesus Christ open Hebrew chapter 12.

[1:46:46] Revelation we're digging somewhere amen
[1:46:50] you there because somebody will say how
[1:46:52] can you climb deep

[1:47:03] bit so I know how bullets come
[1:47:06] I know how I sense them and I know how
[1:47:11] uh I can shoot them down okay all right
[1:47:14] Hebrew chapter 2 verse 2 if you dare you
[1:47:18] can say Amen
[1:47:19] looking unto who Jesus who is the water
[1:47:23] and the water finisher of water our face
[1:47:26] stop
[1:47:28] I've been
[1:47:30] everybody okay before Jesus Christ shall
[1:47:33] he find Faith but that Faith nobody can
[1:47:37] give it
[1:47:38] damn it
[1:47:41] everybody okay he must be given by the
[1:47:45] son of man himself
[1:47:47] so the son of man must be the author
[1:47:52] everybody okay off the faith but he
[1:47:56] doesn't stop on being the author only he
[1:48:00] must be the author and the water
[1:48:02] finisher his offer when he's coming in
[1:48:06] Revelation 10.
[1:48:08] is to produce the faith everybody okay
[1:48:11] but he is the finisher of the faith when
[1:48:15] he is coming in the Rapture to take you
[1:48:17] up
[1:48:20] everybody okay everybody okay as the
[1:48:24] word is the author of the favor as the
[1:48:28] flesh is the finisher of the favor so he
[1:48:32] come to start
[1:48:33] the faith then he himself come to suck
[1:48:37] the faith that he already started
[1:48:40] everybody okay that's why he is the
[1:48:42] author and he is the finisher he is the
[1:48:45] alpha and he is the Omega he is the L
[1:48:49] and he is the Z he is the beginning and
[1:48:53] he is the end if he starts something he
[1:48:56] will always end it up
[1:49:00] everybody okay
[1:49:02] the author and the finisher of her faith
[1:49:05] who for the joy that was set before him
[1:49:08] enduring water the cross is passing the
[1:49:11] water and he sat down at the right hand
[1:49:13] of the Throne of who God so he's the
[1:49:15] answer according to Revelation 10 to
[1:49:18] bring the faith to be the author of The
[1:49:21] Faith so the faith that we have now is
[1:49:24] that the faith of a man
[1:49:26] it is the faith of the son of man
[1:49:29] because Malachi 4 must come to restore
[1:49:31] the faith but it's not Malachi 4 because
[1:49:34] he's revealing the son of man and to the
[1:49:38] public everybody okay so Revelation 10
[1:49:41] is the author and then the Rapture is
[1:49:44] now the finisher of the faith that he
[1:49:47] started everybody okay so far and we
[1:49:50] found out that the son of man who
[1:49:53] started the bread is the one who's gonna
[1:49:56] marry the brother
[1:49:58] everybody okay because throughout the
[1:50:00] churches the son of man was not there
[1:50:04] you remember he was the son of God open
[1:50:08] Revelation chapter one
[1:50:10] as I'm going quickly now
[1:50:13] glory to God Revelation chapter one
[1:50:18] if you dare you can say amen amen
[1:50:22] job to verse 13.
[1:50:25] you there amen and in the Beast of the
[1:50:28] seven Candlestick there was one how like
[1:50:32] he was not the son of man he was like
[1:50:36] unto the water son of man clothed with
[1:50:39] government down to his foot and gird
[1:50:41] about the best with a golden water jump
[1:50:44] to verse 14. his head
[1:50:46] and he said where white like water whoa
[1:50:50] as white as Waters no and his eyes were
[1:50:54] as the flame of water fire watch verse
[1:50:56] 15 carefully
[1:50:58] his feet
[1:50:59] like the to find water brass and it as
[1:51:04] if they burn in a furnace and his voice
[1:51:06] as the voice of water many Waters the
[1:51:09] feet of this person that is like
[1:51:15] unto the son of man his feet were alike
[1:51:19] Fine Brothers his eyes like flaming fire
[1:51:22] but he's not the son of man he is like
[1:51:25] unto the son of man amen go to
[1:51:29] Revelation 2 verse 18. man
[1:51:32] everybody okay
[1:51:34] glory to God if you're there you can say
[1:51:36] amen amen
[1:51:38] to the angel of the Church of who Tyrus
[1:51:41] tataya right
[1:51:43] this saying these things says the who
[1:51:47] Son of God
[1:51:50] not the son of man we need to know how
[1:51:53] is the son of God
[1:51:55] watch the scripture this thing say the
[1:51:58] Son of God remember in Revelation 1 it's
[1:52:03] like the son of man it's not the son of
[1:52:06] man but this clearly saved the son of
[1:52:09] God
[1:52:10] this thing says the Son of God Kama who
[1:52:14] has eyes like water flame and Fire
[1:52:18] everybody okay
[1:52:19] and feet like water fine bread but we
[1:52:23] found that in Revelation 1 the one who
[1:52:26] have eyes like flame of fire and feet
[1:52:29] like brass was like unto the water son
[1:52:32] of man now in Revelation 2 18 the Bible
[1:52:36] clearly call him the water Son of God so
[1:52:39] throughout the edge there two other two
[1:52:41] changes the son of man is not there
[1:52:44] by the scripture I already give you the
[1:52:47] message but this one seal it so
[1:52:50] throughout the seventh Church angels we
[1:52:52] don't have son of man we only have what
[1:52:55] Son of God
[1:52:59] amen everybody okay
[1:53:01] and we remember that son of man got too
[1:53:04] tattle in him
[1:53:08] son of man is also Son of God
[1:53:12] and he's also son of David So when Jesus
[1:53:16] Christ died
[1:53:18] anybody okay at Calvary and he pulled
[1:53:23] the bread out of him he was not pulling
[1:53:27] the son of David because the son of
[1:53:30] David is a king
[1:53:34] everybody okay he pulled the Son of God
[1:53:37] because the Son of God is the female
[1:53:41] version it is the brother
[1:53:44] that's why brother Branham said that man
[1:53:47] that was in the middle of the seven
[1:53:49] churches Ages was the brother
[1:53:53] it is a brand that look like the husband
[1:53:55] because the husband and the brother so
[1:53:59] the one that was poor on the day of
[1:54:02] Pentecost was the son of God not the son
[1:54:06] of man
[1:54:08] the one that came from Adam was a woman
[1:54:12] not the man the woman came out and the
[1:54:16] man stepped out that's why he fell
[1:54:19] [Applause]
[1:54:21] that's why the church fell in Asia
[1:54:26] because the main part was not there but
[1:54:29] God promised according to Luke 17 30
[1:54:32] that in the days when the son of man
[1:54:38] everybody okay imagine what the male
[1:54:41] part of God is coming back for his blood
[1:54:44] now because the blood have suffered
[1:54:47] throughout the seven churches now the
[1:54:50] groom himself must come down
[1:54:52] everybody clear in order to defend his
[1:54:55] own Pride everybody okay have I lost
[1:54:59] someone
[1:55:00] Have I Lost somebody amen that's why we
[1:55:04] have the coming remember last Sunday of
[1:55:07] the son of man why to bring the woman
[1:55:11] the male part that she didn't have
[1:55:14] because as long as Eve is if the devil
[1:55:18] will continue to make her fall
[1:55:21] amen when you bring Adam the serpent
[1:55:24] doesn't come when the serpent comes he
[1:55:27] see if walking with Adam he goes the
[1:55:29] other way when he see Eve alone then the
[1:55:33] serpent approaches now our Adam the
[1:55:36] second and the last Adam have come down
[1:55:40] that's why this church will never fail
[1:55:46] because they ever presence help of God
[1:55:50] the ever presence God is now always with
[1:55:54] his brother he came down to be the
[1:55:57] author
[1:55:59] and when he finished he goes back and he
[1:56:02] become there all the The Finisher he's
[1:56:05] the author with his blood and he put his
[1:56:08] brother he said now come and jump
[1:56:10] and now I am the finisher of your favor
[1:56:13] that's why from start to finish this
[1:56:16] Pride won't fail
[1:56:18] because we got the devil as well
[1:56:22] we got Malachi Soul we got Luke 17 30.
[1:56:26] we got Revelation 10 one to seven the
[1:56:30] days of the son of man none of you will
[1:56:33] fail
[1:56:34] no matter what the devil did to your
[1:56:37] life he will not get you

[2:09:10] that bullet is gone
[2:09:12] in Hell okay so when they when Abraham
[2:09:16] when Elohim returned back to Sarah
[2:09:20] something must be done to Sarah first
[2:09:26] do you follow me Elohim cannot return
[2:09:30] just like that
[2:09:31] Elohim needs something in the body of
[2:09:35] Sarah
[2:09:38] to determine his coming
[2:09:42] all his return if Sarah circle is not
[2:09:46] functioning Elohim doesn't know the
[2:09:48] circle of life
[2:09:53] do you follow me let me go slowly
[2:09:57] Elohim say I will return according to
[2:10:00] the time of what life but Sarah doesn't
[2:10:02] have any more time of life
[2:10:06] [Music]
[2:10:07] everybody okay so for Elohim to return
[2:10:10] Sarah must first be brought back in the
[2:10:15] circle of life
[2:10:15] [Applause]
[2:10:19] everybody okay when the circle of life
[2:10:22] the menstrual Circle begin to function
[2:10:26] then Elohim will choose which month he
[2:10:30] need to come as long as the circle is
[2:10:32] not working Elohim is blocked
[2:10:36] foreign
[2:10:53] and in order for Elohim to come back the
[2:10:58] circle of Sarah must be renewed back
[2:11:01] again
[2:11:02] in other words Sarah must be restored
[2:11:08] by the circle of life
[2:11:15] everybody okay and the circle of life

[2:20:40] so how is Sarah here now
[2:20:45] so something happened to Sarah
[2:20:48] because the position goes away she
[2:20:50] always goes to King
[2:20:52] King only King
[2:20:55] that's why we are only married to the
[2:20:57] king

[2:21:43] a sister that's why I couldn't help it
[2:21:52] didn't marry a grandma
[2:21:57] because the same language came back
[2:21:59] again in other words Sarah in 20 is
[2:22:03] nasira in 18 between 18 and 20
[2:22:11] are you following me there is a seventh

[2:22:19] yes
[2:22:20] okay and the Seven seal could not be
[2:22:24] open
[2:22:27] that's why the seven seal is quiet
[2:22:28] that's why whatever happened there is
[2:22:31] quiet there is a revelation 10 7. that
[2:22:35] gave Faith to Sarah and that fifth
[2:22:38] chance Sarah but it's all sealed it is
[2:22:42] quiet it is a silence in the Scripture
[2:22:45] it is a seventh seal that is hidden
[2:22:48] rather
[2:22:52] that's why brother Branham said from
[2:22:54] James said to Revelation the seventh
[2:22:57] chill is hidden
[2:22:59] it is a secret coming that have happened
[2:23:03] there that the scripture cannot show you
[2:23:07] but you will see just the aftermath
[2:23:12] are you following me are you following
[2:23:14] me

[2:23:57] but not the daughter of my mother and
[2:23:59] she became my water wife
[2:24:02] and he came to pass when God calls me to
[2:24:05] wander from my father house Genesis 12.
[2:24:09] that I said to her this is your kindness
[2:24:12] which you show to me at every place
[2:24:16] where we shall come
[2:24:18] say of me he is my water brother that
[2:24:21] happened when Sarah is Young
[2:24:24] and beautiful and very fair not when

[2:24:30] okay
[2:24:31] everybody okay let's go to Genesis 21.
[2:24:37] first one
[2:24:38] everybody okay when Sarah received
[2:24:42] strength by faith
[2:24:45] when the son of man came by word
[2:24:49] when Revelation 10 7 is now revealed in

[2:24:59] [Applause]
[2:25:01] Faith he must find the circle of life
[2:25:04] working
[2:25:06] now Elohim can return
[2:25:08] Genesis 21 verse 1.
[2:25:12] and the Lord did whatever
[2:25:14] [Music]
[2:25:17] after the circle is back
[2:25:19] [Music]
[2:25:20] after the restoration of the circle
[2:25:24] after Revelation 10 after number 28 now
[2:25:29] the Lord has visited Sarah as he had
[2:25:33] housed and the Lord did to Sarah as he
[2:25:36] has what spoken so Sarah did water
[2:25:39] conceived now he's finishing
[2:25:42] he was the author now he's now finishing
[2:25:45] conceived and brought Abraham his son in

[2:25:56] [Music]
[2:25:57] everybody okay everybody okay can you

[2:26:02] the Bible says she was well stricken in
[2:26:05] age Sarah was old on the east side
[2:26:11] 90 years old was still the Sarah inside
[2:26:14] but the cellar outside was no more 90
[2:26:19] years old
[2:26:20] foreign
[2:26:23] because Grandma cannot have a baby
[2:26:28] she needs stress to conceive
[2:26:31] everybody okay and all that and set at
[2:26:35] the set of time with who
[2:26:38] had spoken to who we don't know that
[2:26:41] time
[2:26:43] we don't know the coming
[2:26:45] but somehow something must happen for
[2:26:48] that to happen everybody okay let's go
[2:26:51] to Second Thessalonians then I saw
[2:26:53] quickly
[2:26:55] all right
[2:26:58] it's amazing this church
[2:27:02] if you dare you can say Amen

[2:27:31] with us when the who Lord Jesus shall be
[2:27:34] how revealed not coming
[2:27:37] remember the revealing of the son of man
[2:27:40] shall be revealed from water heaven with
[2:27:43] who is mighty Angel so who who's gonna
[2:27:45] reveal Jesus in heaven
[2:27:49] can you answer me who will reveal Jesus
[2:27:52] in heaven
[2:27:53] one Angel how many
[2:27:56] so there will be a group of angels which
[2:28:00] we don't know the number and that group
[2:28:02] of angels will reveal Jesus Christ in
[2:28:05] heaven
[2:28:09] so we must see a Jesus in heaven so we

[2:28:17] that Jesus have to be revealed by many
[2:28:20] angels
[2:28:26] everybody okay what happened to that

[2:28:58] when we look at that picture who do you
[2:29:00] see Christ when you look at this picture
[2:29:02] who do you see Christ so what happened
[2:29:05] on Sunset Martin it is the fulfilling of
[2:29:09] second Thessalonians chapter 1 verse 10
[2:29:12] when the son of man the Lord Jesus
[2:29:16] Christ is revealed from heaven with
[2:29:19] Mighty Angel how can this be a rocket
[2:29:24] even if we dump

[2:29:51] it's a Faith from hell
[2:29:53] amen verse 8 in Fleming how fire taking
[2:29:57] how then he must be a judge you remember
[2:30:00] in Luke he was a judge and the widow
[2:30:02] woman taking Vengeance on them that no
[2:30:05] not God and that obeyed not the gospel
[2:30:07] of Our Lord who Jesus Christ who shall
[2:30:10] be punished with Everlasting destruction
[2:30:13] from the presence of the Lord and from
[2:30:16] the glory of his water power
[2:30:18] watch number one Jesus is he revealed in
[2:30:23] the heaven by Mighty Angel we found it
[2:30:26] everybody okay watch verse 10.
[2:30:30] when he saw what come
[2:30:37] everybody okay
[2:30:38] so there is a revealing an air coming
[2:30:44] it's all over the scripture about it
[2:30:46] everybody okay so the revealing is done
[2:30:50] by Maddie Angel and revealing his coming
[2:30:53] as water the word
[2:30:57] listen to this brother Branham but
[2:31:01] remember all this time Noah was in the
[2:31:04] ark
[2:31:05] the bread is how see you
[2:31:08] in with who Christ the water last member
[2:31:12] has been watered
[2:31:14] everybody okay the six seal has no water
[2:31:18] produced itself there's seven still
[2:31:20] bring him back where to the Earth the
[2:31:23] servant seal will bring him back on
[2:31:26] Earth when the last member is house
[2:31:30] we did
[2:31:31] [Music]
[2:31:33] which year is this one
[2:31:36] if this happened on Sunset Mountain
[2:31:41] how are you safe today
[2:31:45] how are you safe today
[2:31:48] because they're coming the sevenths here
[2:31:51] bring Christ on the Earth when the last
[2:31:54] elect is how
[2:31:56] redeem and now the six seal is water
[2:32:00] it's up because Moses and Elijah need to
[2:32:02] go back to the Jews remember last Sunday
[2:32:04] amen if this happened in sunset Mountain
[2:32:07] how are you Christian today
[2:32:11] so we have been in uh 70 years of
[2:32:15] tribulation
[2:32:17] but tribulation is only three and a half
[2:32:19] a year
[2:32:20] so what happened on Sunset Mountain
[2:32:24] amen because the seventh seal has three
[2:32:28] things
[2:32:29] the seven sillies a triangle
[2:32:32] you have the third pool he have the
[2:32:35] seven Thunder and he has the coming of
[2:32:37] the Lord and brother Branham said this
[2:32:39] last settlement the coming of the Lord
[2:32:41] will not reveal only at that time
[2:32:44] so the third pool and the Seven Thunder
[2:32:47] are first revealing restoring the circle
[2:32:51] of life
[2:32:53] they are first restoring the faith they
[2:32:55] are giving Sarah the faith to open the
[2:32:59] circle they are fulfilling Luke 18 the
[2:33:01] son of man must find faith when they
[2:33:04] finish founding Faith then the last
[2:33:07] element of the seventh seal which is the
[2:33:11] coming of the Lord now will bring our
[2:33:13] husband back now to come to pick you up
[2:33:17] when the last he left is how we dim and
[2:33:21] we are all still in class

[2:33:26] any question
[2:33:27] verse 10 when he has come to be how
[2:33:31] glorify in his water
[2:33:37] did you see that so there is a revealing
[2:33:40] first
[2:33:41] then Jesus will be glorified in the sand
[2:33:45] and Romans say there is a glory that
[2:33:48] will be revealed in us but that Glory
[2:33:51] must wait for the son of man to First
[2:33:55] reveal himself in heaven when he's
[2:33:58] revealing in heaven when the circle of
[2:34:00] life have opened now God can come and be
[2:34:05] glorified in US
[2:34:07] everybody okay verse 10 when he shall
[2:34:11] come to be glorified in his water Saints
[2:34:14] and to be how admire in all them that do
[2:34:17] water believe not only us
[2:34:20] everybody from Paul from Iranians all of
[2:34:25] us must wake up
[2:34:27] and Jesus have to look at you and say oh
[2:34:30] this is me that look like me that look
[2:34:32] like me that look like me he's admiring
[2:34:35] himself
[2:34:36] [Music]
[2:34:38] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:34:41] he's admiring he said because of the
[2:34:44] testimony Our Testimony among you was
[2:34:47] believed in that water they dropped to
[2:34:49] verse 12. that the name of our Lord
[2:34:52] Jesus Christ may be how glorified in
[2:34:55] Jesus again
[2:34:56] in who you remember Jesus said father
[2:35:00] glorify that name that was him now his
[2:35:04] name is not glorifying him it's now
[2:35:06] glorified in US
[2:35:09] everybody okay glorify in you and you in
[2:35:13] half him according to the grace of our
[2:35:16] God and the Lord who Jesus so now we
[2:35:19] understand that before Sarah can change
[2:35:22] everybody okay something must happen
[2:35:25] first a faith must be restored to Sarah
[2:35:28] first in order to restore the circle of
[2:35:31] life when the circle of life is restored
[2:35:34] then now God can come anytime in other
[2:35:38] words Jesus will not come if you are not

[2:48:10] whoever forgot
[2:48:12] dead body will open everybody okay A
[2:48:16] Rose verse 253 and came out of the word
[2:48:19] Grace after
[2:48:23] his what Resurrection
[2:48:28] so they shout that came
[2:48:31] that struck the rock went everything
[2:48:35] everybody okay
[2:48:36] brought an earthquake amen
[2:48:39] didn't work the scent right there
[2:48:43] yeah
[2:48:44] descent were still sleeping
[2:48:48] descent came after
[2:48:51] because Jesus died and Rose within three
[2:48:54] days that's when they came out but the
[2:48:57] shot was on the first day not on the
[2:49:00] third day they came later on
[2:49:02] but in between the shout
[2:49:05] and the resurrection there is something
[2:49:08] in there okay glory to God Amen but job
[2:49:14] to verse that's verse 50 to everybody
[2:49:16] clear now they came after his
[2:49:18] resurrection and went into the holy city
[2:49:21] and appeared to water many they were
[2:49:23] Resurrected
[2:49:25] they came out they could appear now and
[2:49:28] go out amen jump to verse 66 and I'm
[2:49:32] gonna close it at 62. and I'm gonna
[2:49:34] close
[2:49:36] so now we understand that even though
[2:49:38] the shout came
[2:49:40] everybody that was in the grave remain
[2:49:43] everybody okay they didn't come out they
[2:49:46] came out after
[2:49:47] amen but the shout is important for the
[2:49:51] Resurrection the shout is important for
[2:49:54] the change of the
[2:49:58] but you gotta wait till the circle is
[2:50:01] completed
[2:50:03] everybody okay almost finished okay
[2:50:06] buckle up I'm gonna land the the plane
[2:50:08] verse 62. you dare you can say amen amen

[2:50:14] prepare uh the day of the preparation
[2:50:16] the chief priest
[2:50:18] and the Pharisee came together to pilate
[2:50:21] saying sir
[2:50:22] we remember that that Deceiver
[2:50:25] said while he was yet to love after
[2:50:29] three days
[2:50:30] again why are you afraid so they were
[2:50:33] believing
[2:50:36] if you know that he's dead we finish
[2:50:39] with him why are you afraid
[2:50:41] thank you
[2:50:43] so Jesus even when he is a dead body he
[2:50:47] still scared the devil
[2:50:49] [Applause]
[2:50:53] so every scent of God that died that is
[2:50:57] laying on the tomb is scared to the
[2:51:00] devil because the devil knows that one
[2:51:02] of this time when I will get to the
[2:51:05] cemetery some of them won't be there
[2:51:07] [Applause]
[2:51:09] so your loved one who's there at the
[2:51:13] tomb is a scare for the devil
[2:51:16] the devil is still puzzled what is going
[2:51:19] to happen to the loved one

[2:51:23] in other words they are in love
[2:51:27] somewhere

[2:51:35] loved one died
[2:51:37] it was my brother Elisha
[2:51:41] he's my brother I will see him in heaven
[2:51:43] so when my brother Elijah died we went

[2:53:00] the cell phone battery have one uh one
[2:53:04] bar left

[2:53:14] begin to walk again
[2:53:15] [Music]
[2:53:15] [Applause]
[2:53:17] [Music]
[2:53:18] showing that believer when they die
[2:53:21] don't play with that body something is
[2:53:24] stealing
[2:53:27] even if you cremate them something is in
