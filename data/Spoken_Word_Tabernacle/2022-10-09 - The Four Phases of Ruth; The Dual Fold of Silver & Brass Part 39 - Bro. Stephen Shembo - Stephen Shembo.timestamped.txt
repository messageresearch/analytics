[59:35] have also a scripture for that
[59:38] United Way to relax

[1:00:01] the middle pigeon okay
[1:00:04] Kingdom
[1:00:06] it's two Kingdom that I joined together
[1:00:08] everybody okay go to Daniel chapter
[1:00:11] seven you will need your Bible today you
[1:00:14] really need your Bible
[1:00:15] there is absolutely no way I can go
[1:00:18] around without using the scripture
[1:00:24] last Sunday I have to go through the
[1:00:26] scriptures so you can see where brother
[1:00:28] Branham is coming with his description
[1:00:30] about the Barbarian being cruel
[1:00:33] ravishing women brother Branham didn't
[1:00:36] just came out and hated the Russian
[1:00:38] people and saying things like that no
[1:00:41] brother Brian I'm actually was pulling
[1:00:44] stuff from the scripture amen
[1:00:46] so now when you look at the scripture
[1:00:48] you look at the bra at the message it's
[1:00:50] always
[1:00:54] I even seen things that I brought around
[1:00:56] I'm never gave even any reference before
[1:00:59] you know it today right there
[1:01:04] I will show you down the road that even
[1:01:06] things that happen personally in brother
[1:01:09] Branham life
[1:01:10] will line up in the scripture
[1:01:13] even his own stuff
[1:01:15] if I give you the story you'll think
[1:01:17] brother Branham is just telling you a
[1:01:19] story maybe he's in a wood doing
[1:01:21] something and I can pull it to you I say
[1:01:23] look at the description in the scripture
[1:01:25] and you will be amazed and what about
[1:01:28] them never even say anything about the
[1:01:29] scripture
[1:01:31] in other words we receive a powerful
[1:01:33] message
[1:01:36] Daniel chapter seven if you dare you can
[1:01:38] say Amen
[1:01:39] verse 4 again
[1:01:42] the first was like a lion you know that
[1:01:45] and he had the ego wings I beheld till
[1:01:48] the wings thereof were plugged and he
[1:01:50] was lift up from the earth and made
[1:01:53] stand upon defeat as a man you
[1:01:55] understand this language now and immense
[1:01:57] heart towards given to it
[1:01:59] and behold another Beast a second like a
[1:02:02] bear
[1:02:03] we know the bear is the silver
[1:02:07] that was right here this is made out of
[1:02:10] silver
[1:02:11] that was in the natural in a spiritual
[1:02:14] this silver is a bear
[1:02:17] amen we have two arms two breasts so the
[1:02:22] bear must have also two sides amen the
[1:02:25] Bible said the second like a bear and he
[1:02:28] raised up where is my friend with the
[1:02:30] microphone praise God on the MoneyGram
[1:02:34] amen we say and he raised up itself on
[1:02:38] one side
[1:02:39] so there is one side that the bear is
[1:02:41] using
[1:02:42] so there is another side in other words
[1:02:44] they gotta be too sad so the bear have
[1:02:47] two sides
[1:02:52] but he's using more one side
[1:02:56] amen
[1:02:59] and that one side when he's coming up
[1:03:02] with it
[1:03:04] okay now it works when that one side is
[1:03:07] coming out the Bible says he had three
[1:03:10] ribs in the mouth
[1:03:13] so this bear didn't just come and grab
[1:03:16] three ribs
[1:03:18] as it's coming up it is wire it is
[1:03:22] hooked it is connected it is combined it
[1:03:26] is joined with three ribs you cannot
[1:03:29] separate the bear from the river
[1:03:33] everybody okay in other words every word
[1:03:35] that bear is going his mind is on the is
[1:03:38] holding the rib
[1:03:40] amen that one sad
[1:03:43] deal with three ribs
[1:03:46] so some somewhere the Flesh of the rib
[1:03:49] was already eaten
[1:03:51] so somebody was already killed
[1:03:55] when you hold when an animal is having a
[1:03:58] a bone in the mouth it tells you the
[1:04:01] remaining is already gone
[1:04:03] that's just the proof
[1:04:05] but the proof was not ahead
[1:04:08] no it was not an arm it was the river
[1:04:10] but not one rib but three ribs everybody
[1:04:13] okay glory to God Amen
[1:04:17] and then detained and and they say
[1:04:20] that's to it arise devour much flesh so
[1:04:23] it's a destructive
[1:04:26] Mr Man after this I behelding law
[1:04:30] another like a leopard
[1:04:32] which head upon the back of it for wings
[1:04:35] of the fowl so the bear works with two
[1:04:40] side
[1:04:41] and two breasts two arms but when it
[1:04:45] comes to the Brass
[1:04:48] which was the kingdom that followed the
[1:04:52] brass over here Works came up as a
[1:04:56] leopard
[1:04:58] amen and this leopard have not two he
[1:05:02] have four
[1:05:04] four wings
[1:05:06] so as we progress you will see that move
[1:05:08] that that Kingdom moving with four wings
[1:05:11] in other words there was four things
[1:05:15] that were combined together into one
[1:05:17] everybody okay
[1:05:19] the Bible says that he have four wings
[1:05:22] of a file so we don't know which file it
[1:05:25] is
[1:05:26] the Beast had also four heads
[1:05:31] so not only four wings but he has four
[1:05:33] heads
[1:05:34] in other words it's like four leopard
[1:05:39] everybody okay Dada combined together
[1:05:43] into one power
[1:05:47] everybody okay
[1:05:48] the body is one but the head is four
[1:05:53] all right
[1:05:55] so when this Beast is attacking he's
[1:05:58] gonna attack by four different
[1:06:03] assault
[1:06:05] everybody okay
[1:06:07] praise God and Dominion was given to it
[1:06:11] let's stop there and I'm gonna grab the
[1:06:14] last Beast later on
[1:06:15] let's go to Revelation chapter 13.
[1:06:19] you should be happy because now you are
[1:06:22] jumping up and down on the Book of
[1:06:24] Daniel
[1:06:25] you are dancing with Daniel and smiling
[1:06:28] and everything Daniel becomes your
[1:06:31] friend
[1:06:32] you used to run away say Daniel good
[1:06:36] morning Daniel I'm going to John I'm
[1:06:38] going to Matthew I'm going to look some
[1:06:42] of us love the song
[1:06:44] that's their best friend forever
[1:06:48] when they read the Bible of someone
[1:06:49] Psalm 2 something some 119 they skip it
[1:06:54] because it's long
[1:06:58] Pastor where do you get this stuff
[1:07:04] how many reps some 119. they always skip
[1:07:07] it let's read this one family not
[1:07:10] someone hungry because everybody will be
[1:07:12] slumbering
[1:07:14] [Laughter]
[1:07:16] it's got to Revelation 13. now we are
[1:07:20] happy
[1:07:21] we can read the book of Daniel
[1:07:24] a very mysterious book verse one if you
[1:07:27] dare you can say amen and I stood upon
[1:07:30] the sand of the sea and I saw a beast
[1:07:33] rise up you know this Beast having you
[1:07:36] out of the sea having seven heads and
[1:07:40] ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns
[1:07:46] Lord they help me and upon his heads the
[1:07:49] name of blasphemy you understand this
[1:07:51] now there was one name Seven Hills you
[1:07:54] remember
[1:07:55] and the beasts which I saw was like unto
[1:07:59] the leopard it's right there and his
[1:08:01] feet were as the feet of a bear rather
[1:08:04] and his mouth as the mouth of a lion all
[1:08:07] those three beasts combined together and
[1:08:09] the dragon gave him his power you
[1:08:11] understand what he means now and his
[1:08:13] seat which happened in pergamas and
[1:08:16] great Authority
[1:08:17] and I saw one of his head as he were
[1:08:20] wounded to death
[1:08:22] we know this is a Roman Empire
[1:08:24] and his deadly wound was healed and all
[1:08:28] the world wander after the Beast so this
[1:08:32] is a Roman Beast here
[1:08:35] it is Rome
[1:08:37] which is a mixture of tree
[1:08:41] amen
[1:08:43] glory to God verse 4 and they worship
[1:08:48] the Dragon
[1:08:49] which give power to the Beast so through
[1:08:52] this Beast you are worshiping the devil
[1:08:55] and they worship the Beast saying who is
[1:08:58] like to the Beast who is able to make
[1:09:02] war with him so it's Abyss that can make
[1:09:05] war
[1:09:08] he did it naturally
[1:09:10] and he knows how to do it spiritually
[1:09:12] under a nicolaitan spirit because he
[1:09:15] went to conquer yes everybody okay
[1:09:18] now verse 5 and there was given to him a
[1:09:22] mouth speaking water
[1:09:24] I want you to remember that the mouth of
[1:09:27] this Beast
[1:09:29] amen
[1:09:32] amen your boss is dropping stuff
[1:09:34] uh go back to verse two
[1:09:39] and the Beast which I saw was like unto
[1:09:41] the leopard and his feet were unto the
[1:09:44] feet of a bear and his mouth has the
[1:09:46] mouth of water a lion lion was which
[1:09:48] kingdom
[1:09:50] so the mouth has Babylon
[1:09:54] that's coming from your boss
[1:09:56] amen
[1:09:57] everybody okay so the speech is a dragon
[1:10:01] the mouth
[1:10:04] is Babylon
[1:10:06] everybody okay
[1:10:08] but this month is speaking what
[1:10:11] remember that
[1:10:14] why do you want me to remember such a
[1:10:16] detail
[1:10:18] great things why do you want me to
[1:10:20] remember because brother Branham said
[1:10:22] scripture
[1:10:24] does not play with him whatever is in
[1:10:28] the record it's there for the anointed
[1:10:30] as to what it's there forever purpose
[1:10:34] nothing is written in the Bible to play
[1:10:36] around with
[1:10:39] and nothing was preaching this message
[1:10:41] for nothing
[1:10:44] even what you think is not necessary God
[1:10:47] doesn't waste his anointing for brother
[1:10:50] Branham to come and preach the 70 weeks
[1:10:52] of Daniel and we don't need it
[1:10:55] so that therefore is stuck that usually
[1:10:58] say do we need this to go to heaven
[1:11:01] do we need to know the sales to be saved
[1:11:04] do we need to know the seven weeks of
[1:11:06] Daniel do you do to go to heaven it's a
[1:11:09] devilish stop
[1:11:10] because God won't waste his anointing to
[1:11:14] teach you the future home
[1:11:20] and the amazing part it comes from
[1:11:22] preachers
[1:11:24] it is the preacher that are causing the
[1:11:27] people to discuss this message
[1:11:30] the preacher are telling the people what
[1:11:33] is necessary and what is not necessary
[1:11:35] in the message
[1:11:37] the entire message is necessary
[1:11:42] the vision of brother Branham is
[1:11:44] necessary the life of brother Branham is
[1:11:47] necessary
[1:11:54] what do you do with the life of Abraham
[1:11:58] [Music]
[1:12:05] we don't need this it's just knowledge
[1:12:08] really so God wasted his time
[1:12:13] to preach a message that you don't need
[1:12:20] coming from hell
[1:12:23] put me on Facebook
[1:12:25] [Music]
[1:12:27] I'm already got used to war
[1:12:33] amen
[1:12:35] where am I glory to God
[1:12:39] verse 5 and there was given to him a mom
[1:12:42] speaking great things and water
[1:12:44] blasphemies and power was given to him
[1:12:48] to continue 40 and two months I'm living
[1:12:51] that alone
[1:12:54] I'm living that alone
[1:12:57] because he had to handle with Armageddon
[1:13:00] and he opened his mouth in blasphemy
[1:13:04] against the whole God and blood to
[1:13:06] blaspheme his name and his Tabernacle
[1:13:10] and them that dwell in heaven what an
[1:13:14] insulting mouth
[1:13:16] blaspheming not only God but the temple
[1:13:19] of God and not only the temple of God
[1:13:22] he's also blaspheming you
[1:13:25] you know that you dwell in heaven
[1:13:28] your angel even behold the face of God
[1:13:35] glory to God Amen
[1:13:38] job to verse 18 who is this Beast here
[1:13:43] that's speaking too much
[1:13:48] great things verse 18. here is water
[1:13:52] wisdom remember the wise virgin the wise
[1:13:57] will understand here okay because what
[1:14:01] made them wise was the oil
[1:14:04] amen and that oil is the oil of wisdom
[1:14:08] which is Christ because Christ is the
[1:14:10] wisdom of God in other words here is
[1:14:13] Christ
[1:14:15] [Music]
[1:14:16] hey everybody okay here is wisdom
[1:14:20] let him that has understanding come the
[1:14:24] number of the water Beast for it is the
[1:14:27] number of water so this Beast here is a
[1:14:30] man
[1:14:34] am I reading a different Bible no the
[1:14:37] Beast is a man
[1:14:39] and he's a man that speak in his mouth
[1:14:44] he's a false prophet
[1:14:47] foreign
[1:14:49] to help you up easily he's a pope
[1:14:53] I already told you that
[1:14:55] amen
[1:14:57] for it is the number of a man and his
[1:15:00] number is 600 three score and Waters we
[1:15:05] found it under vicarious Philly day you
[1:15:07] remember how many seats do you have
[1:15:09] three a trinity of six
[1:15:12] and six is the number of water
[1:15:15] I was looking for this a long time I can
[1:15:18] find it until now
[1:15:21] we got six we got six we got six amen
[1:15:26] and water
[1:15:28] and water
[1:15:30] how many ribs do we have
[1:15:35] I searched for this I pray for God I say
[1:15:38] what is hidden here he just gave it to
[1:15:40] me now
[1:15:41] amen how many ribs do we have three
[1:15:46] and we represent what amen
[1:15:50] you don't know he represented only few
[1:15:54] people he represent what a woman what
[1:15:57] did they do to Adam here they pulled
[1:16:00] water how many women do we have we
[1:16:05] [Music]
[1:16:10] eternity
[1:16:13] and a trinity in water women so the bear
[1:16:17] is wired
[1:16:19] to destroy it
[1:16:21] is built in him
[1:16:24] to do that
[1:16:26] let's pray
[1:16:28] Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching
[1:16:30] you again humbly this morning Father

[1:16:53] Holy Spirit Come and Minister and

[1:17:21] Jesus precious name amen
[1:17:23] go with me in Daniel chapter 8.
[1:17:27] glory to God
[1:17:34] I always give you some clue
[1:17:37] eat go to sleep on time wake up eat good
[1:17:43] relax
[1:17:45] and you come to church fine
[1:17:49] so you were playing on the internet good
[1:17:51] luck
[1:17:52] everybody okay all right my subject this
[1:17:56] morning is the four phases of roof they
[1:18:00] do a fold of the silver and the water we
[1:18:03] talk about this subject I could not get
[1:18:06] into it the silver is the middle pigeon
[1:18:09] and the brass is the Greece Empire
[1:18:14] you already know about it amen
[1:18:17] we're still dealing with the second oil
[1:18:20] we are in the trashing fall and in the
[1:18:23] Tabernacle we are way deep my friend
[1:18:26] down into the Holy Ghost amen I'm gonna
[1:18:30] remind you this again for a purpose
[1:18:32] brother Branham say any Bible readers
[1:18:35] here knows that all scriptures
[1:18:42] so in other words you got double bubble
[1:18:47] you got a double bubble amen all
[1:18:50] scripture has a compound meaning
[1:18:54] okay every prophecy some most all of it
[1:19:00] has a doer a time there or two times or
[1:19:05] more that it shall be answered as a
[1:19:08] revolving water history in other words
[1:19:11] something will repeat itself
[1:19:13] and we know it happened the first time
[1:19:16] for a reference everybody okay why is it
[1:19:20] important to understand the revolving of
[1:19:23] the stories of the scripture because
[1:19:25] brother Branham says that Spirit does
[1:19:28] not die
[1:19:31] amen so if a spirit was used the first
[1:19:34] time it is more likely than that spirit
[1:19:37] will be used the second time again
[1:19:42] but Spirit doesn't die God take his man
[1:19:45] but never his spirit
[1:19:48] God took Elijah and the double portion
[1:19:51] of his Spirit come upon Elisha about 800
[1:19:55] years later come out on John the Baptist
[1:19:57] and predicted to come again in the last
[1:19:59] day God took Christ out of the Earth but
[1:20:02] the Holy Spirit come back again the
[1:20:05] devil take his manner
[1:20:08] but the spirit remained just the water
[1:20:11] saying where are you going with this
[1:20:14] when we look at Daniel chapter 2 we
[1:20:18] found out that we have four kingdoms and
[1:20:21] they are described with minerals we got
[1:20:24] the gold we got the silver the brass the
[1:20:27] iron and Dan it's the brass it's the
[1:20:29] iron mixed with Clay on Daniel 7 those
[1:20:33] kingdom are explained or described with
[1:20:35] by their anointing or their power and
[1:20:38] remember every one of this power is a
[1:20:41] wild beast it's a Savage it's an untamed
[1:20:45] Beast everybody okay and we emphasize on
[1:20:49] the middle Persian Kingdom because that
[1:20:51] is what was represented by a bear and we
[1:20:54] found today that when we dealt with a
[1:20:57] bear the bear was coming out actually
[1:21:01] from the water combined connected join
[1:21:05] couple married with three ribs which are
[1:21:08] just explained to you
[1:21:10] everybody okay so far so the bear when
[1:21:14] he came God used the spirit to destroy
[1:21:17] Babylon
[1:21:19] everybody okay so the bear came with a
[1:21:23] trinity of ribs
[1:21:27] everybody here we found a trinity of
[1:21:31] ribs that was already given here and the
[1:21:34] reap represented a woman and at the end
[1:21:37] time we found also not two men one man
[1:21:40] but represented in a trinity of a man
[1:21:44] because remember the devil work
[1:21:47] everything by Trinity so this is not
[1:21:50] really true woman in three women it is
[1:21:53] one woman represented in a trinity so
[1:21:58] Trinity didn't start today
[1:22:03] everybody care Trinity started in
[1:22:06] Babylon
[1:22:09] ever here so when God uses the bear God
[1:22:13] already wired the bear or programmed the
[1:22:17] bear to destroy the trinity
[1:22:20] and The Trinity that was combined with a
[1:22:23] woman
[1:22:25] with a church it started in ancient
[1:22:28] Babylon
[1:22:32] brother Branham says this my friend
[1:22:34] glory to God he said monetize
[1:22:39] turn to water polytheism in water
[1:22:42] Babylon
[1:22:46] in plain word
[1:22:48] the religion of one God
[1:22:52] the religion of one person in the
[1:22:56] godhead turn into many person many gods
[1:23:01] but I'm saying the devil's lie and the
[1:23:05] devil's mystery rose up against the
[1:23:08] truth of God and the mysteries of God in
[1:23:12] that city which city Babylon
[1:23:15] Satan truly became the God of this world
[1:23:19] and exactly worship from those that had
[1:23:22] that he had duped causing them to
[1:23:25] believe that he was truly the Lord
[1:23:28] the polytheistic religion of the enemy
[1:23:32] began with the water
[1:23:34] with the trinitarian doctrine so Trinity
[1:23:38] started in Babylon that's why as the
[1:23:42] bear is coming up he have a reference
[1:23:46] [Music]
[1:23:48] he have a clue
[1:23:50] he has a detection
[1:23:53] that his couple with and whenever he
[1:23:57] found Trinity he's gonna destroy it
[1:24:00] everybody okay brother Branham said that
[1:24:03] he was way back there in Antiquity that
[1:24:08] the one God in three person a deer came
[1:24:12] into Adam Jesus so trivities of the
[1:24:15] devil
[1:24:19] here Isaiah the Lord your God is
[1:24:23] me and my father We Are One everybody
[1:24:26] okay when you see me you see the water
[1:24:29] father so the Trinity is of the devil
[1:24:31] and The Trinity started in Babylon and
[1:24:35] God when he is rising this power is
[1:24:38] automatically clap of this power to use
[1:24:41] Trinity as a detective
[1:24:43] amen amen amen everybody okay
[1:24:47] glory to God we found out according to
[1:24:51] the prophecy of Jeremiah that Jeremiah
[1:24:55] prophesied about the destruction of
[1:24:57] Babylon and we've seen last Sunday that
[1:25:01] that Babylon was not the old Babylon
[1:25:03] even though God Revenge Babylon but that
[1:25:07] Babylon was speaking about Babylon in
[1:25:09] the end time
[1:25:11] I don't know how I skipped the scripture
[1:25:13] but I must read it brother Branham says
[1:25:17] that the Bible says that make bright the
[1:25:20] arrows
[1:25:21] gather the shield Jeremiah 51 remember
[1:25:24] last Sunday
[1:25:25] the Lord has raised up the spirit of the
[1:25:30] king of the middies
[1:25:33] in other words the spirit of the bear
[1:25:36] was used one time
[1:25:39] and Destroy Babylon
[1:25:41] anybody okay and that Spirit did its job
[1:25:45] very well
[1:25:47] know
[1:25:49] everybody okay that God have to reuse
[1:25:52] that Spirit again
[1:25:58] Prada pranam says this amen let me go
[1:26:02] here brother Branham says this
[1:26:05] Satan
[1:26:07] don't worry he said look a job a perfect
[1:26:11] man a just man and God permitted the
[1:26:15] evil
[1:26:16] devil to come upon him to chastise him
[1:26:20] and everything else for the perfecting
[1:26:24] of his spirit because job was always
[1:26:27] afraid
[1:26:30] you know that right if you don't know
[1:26:32] you see me after church he was always
[1:26:34] scared that something bad will happen to
[1:26:36] him
[1:26:38] God look he said let me make something
[1:26:40] bad happen to him then he's gonna get
[1:26:43] used to it
[1:26:44] everybody okay
[1:26:46] everybody okay then when the Devil comes
[1:26:49] back again job will look at the Devil
[1:26:52] and say so what
[1:26:54] you already did it uh God delivered me
[1:26:57] what else can you do that my God cannot
[1:27:00] deliver me so what
[1:27:03] what else do you have new
[1:27:06] everybody okay brother Branham said God
[1:27:09] uses evil spirit many times
[1:27:13] [Laughter]
[1:27:18] God uses evil spirit many times to work
[1:27:22] out his plan and his will
[1:27:30] let me help you up
[1:27:32] if you're struggling
[1:27:34] go to first king

[1:28:45] strength to do that over time
[1:28:49] amen
[1:28:50] SEC first king chapter 22 if you dare
[1:28:53] you can say amen amen go to verse 19.
[1:28:56] God uses evil spirit I hope I can get it
[1:28:59] here
[1:29:01] amen you there
[1:29:05] okay somebody got it and he said this is
[1:29:09] Makaya hear you therefore the word of
[1:29:11] the Lord I saw the Lord sitting on his
[1:29:14] throne and all the hosts of Heaven
[1:29:16] standing by him
[1:29:18] on his right hand and on his left
[1:29:21] and the Lord say who shall I persuade
[1:29:25] God wanted to destroy Ahab
[1:29:29] he's looking for somebody to help him
[1:29:32] amen
[1:29:34] who shall I persuade who shall persuade
[1:29:37] Ahab that he may go up and Fall Away
[1:29:43] there was a battle coming up God wanted
[1:29:46] somebody that can persuade Ahab to move
[1:29:49] on to the battle so he can get killed
[1:29:52] why because a larger spoke
[1:29:56] everybody okay
[1:29:58] and one say this mother on this mother
[1:30:01] and another say on that matter in other
[1:30:03] words a discussion open up a house
[1:30:07] meeting opened up in heaven
[1:30:09] God began to pass the microphone
[1:30:12] the first
[1:30:15] everybody okay
[1:30:18] am I saying a different language so the
[1:30:21] first one said you know Daddy we can do
[1:30:22] this this this we can do this this this
[1:30:25] we can do this then say okay give to the
[1:30:28] next one the next one say I have a great
[1:30:29] idea daddy let's do this this thing and
[1:30:32] suddenly somebody came
[1:30:34] verse 21 and there came forth as spirit
[1:30:38] it
[1:30:40] amen and stood before the Lord
[1:30:44] and say I will persuade him where is
[1:30:48] this Spirit coming from from heaven
[1:30:51] let's see verse 22 and the Lord said to
[1:30:54] him wherewith
[1:30:56] he said I will go forth
[1:30:59] and I will be a lying spirit
[1:31:05] in the mouth of all his prophet
[1:31:09] and he said You shall persuade him and
[1:31:12] Prevail also in other words you can do
[1:31:14] the job pretty good
[1:31:16] go forth and do so
[1:31:18] who gave him the permission God
[1:31:22] with a blessing
[1:31:25] and we leave it alone
[1:31:27] now therefore behold the Lord has put
[1:31:31] the lying spirit in the mouth of all
[1:31:34] these your prophet and the Lord has
[1:31:36] spoken evil concerning you so God used
[1:31:40] an evil spirit to destroy Ahab
[1:31:43] man everybody okay that's why brother
[1:31:46] Branham says that God uses evil spirit
[1:31:50] many times
[1:31:52] I gave you that example to quieten your
[1:31:54] nerve amen many times to work out his
[1:31:58] plan and his will so God used the bear
[1:32:01] the first time and the bear did a very
[1:32:04] good job so God came back again to reuse
[1:32:07] the bear over
[1:32:09] because when the spirit does a very good
[1:32:12] job God will reuse that Spirit over
[1:32:15] again
[1:32:16] and not only does God use bad Spirit God
[1:32:20] also use good spirit
[1:32:23] Amen brother Branham said that these men
[1:32:27] are kept Alive by God from their
[1:32:30] original Ministry for future services
[1:32:35] deserve it how
[1:32:39] you okay the servant house so well so
[1:32:42] well just feed the spirit of Elijah
[1:32:45] Minister how many times and Moses how
[1:32:49] many times what keep alive for father
[1:32:52] father Services a simple sort of a
[1:32:56] person Elijah was and he served God
[1:32:59] purpose so good
[1:33:03] that simple Spirit was in Elijah until
[1:33:06] God used it in three other men already
[1:33:10] and promised to use it again in the last
[1:33:13] day so simple just stand there and do
[1:33:16] whatever tell the truth there anointing
[1:33:18] of Elijah always tell the truth to the
[1:33:21] congregation
[1:33:23] it is an anointing that that's a sugar
[1:33:26] cut the people
[1:33:29] the congregation it is an anointing that
[1:33:33] doesn't compromise it is an anointing
[1:33:36] that sometimes it might be Miss
[1:33:41] understood of being rude
[1:33:45] because it's an anointing that always
[1:33:48] fit the truth because the truth will set
[1:33:51] you free you will know the truth and the
[1:33:55] truth will set you free so in this
[1:33:57] message if a pastor cannot tell you the
[1:34:01] truth something is wrong in that church
[1:34:04] [Applause]
[1:34:08] everybody okay God will use his spirit
[1:34:12] when they do a very good job Elijah did
[1:34:16] a very good job and God have to reuse
[1:34:19] his Spirit five times Moses did a good
[1:34:23] job but he messed up the first time
[1:34:26] that's right that's right
[1:34:28] and God say he cannot enter the Promised
[1:34:31] Land
[1:34:33] but when Moses is coming back God put
[1:34:36] Elijah beside him
[1:34:38] so Moses one fell again
[1:34:45] because Elijah never failed
[1:34:49] everybody here Moses one fell again
[1:34:51] because Elijah is ready Elijah had
[1:34:55] happened five times because five is the
[1:34:57] number of Grace

[1:36:40] Babylon have to be destroyed that woman
[1:36:42] because she was drunk with the blood of
[1:36:45] your brothers and sisters but here God

[1:37:08] I love this church
[1:37:10] amen let me start the Bible says that
[1:37:15] the temple of God was open well in
[1:37:19] heaven so the temple of God was in
[1:37:22] heaven first
[1:37:26] am I reading a different Bible
[1:37:28] everybody okay because Moses God told
[1:37:32] Moses to build the Tabernacle according
[1:37:35] to what according to the mother
[1:37:37] according to what he saw In Heaven There
[1:37:40] was a temple a Tabernacle in heaven and
[1:37:43] Moses just duplicated on Earth the Bible
[1:37:46] says
[1:37:48] that the temple of God was opened in
[1:37:50] heaven and there was seen in his step of
[1:37:54] the water
[1:37:55] the Ark of water
[1:37:57] his testimony and they were lightning
[1:38:00] and voices and thundering and the
[1:38:03] earthquake and great hell
[1:38:05] God say I will destroy Babylon because
[1:38:09] of my temple
[1:38:11] and the first temple is in heaven what
[1:38:14] happened in heaven
[1:38:17] can I continue
[1:38:19] brother Branham say if God speaks I'll
[1:38:24] send you he's backer he backs up what
[1:38:27] you say
[1:38:29] see notice if you are an ambassador from
[1:38:31] Heaven All Heaven is water and Heaven is
[1:38:35] consisted of water the entire Heaven is
[1:38:39] made out of the word
[1:38:42] everybody okay that's why when the
[1:38:45] temple opened up the ark the word the
[1:38:48] word the Ark of the Covenant not a
[1:38:50] physical act the word was open everybody
[1:38:53] okay now what happened in this Heaven
[1:38:57] that is made out of the word
[1:38:59] that God want to Revenge
[1:39:02] amen brother Brian I'm saying this great
[1:39:06] first battle that was ever thought began
[1:39:09] begin in heaven
[1:39:11] where the temple is when Michael and his
[1:39:15] Angel fought against Lucifer and his
[1:39:17] Angel he first started the first battle
[1:39:20] was in where Heaven so sin did not
[1:39:24] originate on Earth
[1:39:26] it's originated in water so in heaven in
[1:39:30] the temple of God Lucifer defiled the
[1:39:34] first temple of God by bringing sin into
[1:39:37] heaven
[1:39:41] I will avenge myself against Babylon
[1:39:44] because of my temple the Bible said how
[1:39:48] are they have fallen from heaven or
[1:39:51] Lucifer he's fallen from heaven from the
[1:39:54] temple of God Amen son of the morning
[1:39:57] how are that cut down to the ground
[1:40:00] which did weaken the nation for thou has
[1:40:03] said in the heart I will Ascend into
[1:40:06] water heaven and I will exert my throne
[1:40:09] above the water stars of God I will seat
[1:40:12] us upon the Mount of the water so there
[1:40:15] was a congregation in heaven
[1:40:19] foreign
[1:40:28] [Applause]
[1:40:43] [Music]
[1:40:43] [Applause]
[1:40:44] [Laughter]
[1:40:47] you need more scripture and you see me
[1:40:49] my friend but the Bible says that he
[1:40:52] also sit while we will also sit upon the
[1:40:55] Mount of the congregation in the side of
[1:40:57] the water yours what is north in heaven
[1:41:02] come on out down my front
[1:41:04] [Laughter]
[1:41:08] do you know that the north was where the
[1:41:10] ego was
[1:41:13] beautiful
[1:41:15] for situation the joy of water the whole
[1:41:19] earth is water Mountain Jerusalem on the
[1:41:22] side of the water
[1:41:23] the city of the water great king why was
[1:41:27] Lucifer looking for the North
[1:41:29] [Music]
[1:41:31] everybody okay
[1:41:33] so in heaven the first temple the devil
[1:41:37] defiled by bringing sin and dividing the
[1:41:40] congregation of God
[1:41:43] he took a third of the angel
[1:41:45] everybody okay now later on we found out
[1:41:49] that when Saul went down when Moses came
[1:41:53] Moses built the Tabernacle
[1:41:56] and Solomon came and Solomon built the
[1:42:00] temple of God
[1:42:01] so the second temple was the Temple of
[1:42:05] Solomon
[1:42:07] everybody okay and this Temple was
[1:42:11] destroyed by Babylon
[1:42:16] I will avenge myself because of my
[1:42:18] temple
[1:42:19] the Bible say in Jeremiah 52 he said now
[1:42:23] in the fifth month in the tenth day of
[1:42:25] the month which was the 19th year of
[1:42:28] Nebuchadnezzar King of water Babylon
[1:42:31] cannab was a random captain of the god
[1:42:34] which served the king of Babylon into
[1:42:37] water Jerusalem and burned the house of
[1:42:39] the Lord
[1:42:41] and the King's house and all the houses
[1:42:44] of Jerusalem on all the houses of the
[1:42:46] Great Men burn here with what
[1:42:49] second Chronicle and all the vessels of
[1:42:53] the house of God great and small and The
[1:42:56] Treasure of the house of the Lord and
[1:42:58] the Treasures of the king and of his
[1:43:00] Praises all these he brought to water
[1:43:03] Babylon so the second temple of God that
[1:43:06] God anointed and dwelled into that
[1:43:10] Temple Babylon came and destroyed that
[1:43:13] Temple
[1:43:17] I'm gonna bring veggies
[1:43:20] because of my temple
[1:43:22] then later on We Found Jesus coming
[1:43:27] are we okay
[1:43:29] are we okay I'm still moving up Jesus
[1:43:33] said an answer to them destroy water
[1:43:35] this Temple the Temple of Solomon was
[1:43:39] destroyed but he was rebuilt again by
[1:43:44] the rubber bear
[1:43:45] and the book of Nehemiah
[1:43:48] everybody okay everybody okay so this
[1:43:52] Temple was destroyed and rebuilt back
[1:43:55] again
[1:43:56] and when he was rebuilt Jesus came and
[1:43:59] was standing by the temple and Jesus
[1:44:02] began to speak
[1:44:06] you need to understand God
[1:44:08] Jesus want to speak about himself but he
[1:44:12] sat beside the temple
[1:44:14] so when he's speaking some will believe
[1:44:17] he's talking about the temple
[1:44:21] purposely blinding you
[1:44:25] everybody okay
[1:44:26] the Bible says that destroyed this
[1:44:29] Temple and in water
[1:44:31] I would do what raise it up then save
[1:44:34] the Jews 40 and six years the 70 weeks
[1:44:37] of Daniel Radley let me leave it alone
[1:44:40] what's this Temple so there is two
[1:44:43] Temple there
[1:44:44] Jesus said you destroyed this temple in
[1:44:47] three days they turned around they say
[1:44:49] this Temple here it was built it was
[1:44:51] rebuilt in 46 years you're gonna rebuild
[1:44:55] it in three days
[1:44:56] everybody okay don't Disturbed in
[1:44:59] discipline in building and will that
[1:45:02] will read up in three days but he speak
[1:45:05] of the Temple of water his body the
[1:45:08] Third Temple was the body of Jesus
[1:45:10] Christ
[1:45:15] amen and who destroyed Jesus on the
[1:45:19] culture
[1:45:21] which is Babylon
[1:45:24] everybody okay I will avenge myself
[1:45:27] because of my temple can I continue
[1:45:33] amen amen but remember the Temple of
[1:45:37] Solomon was rebuilt again
[1:45:40] because they thought Jesus was talking
[1:45:42] about that Temple so there is a fourth
[1:45:44] temple here which was the Temple of
[1:45:46] Solomon
[1:45:49] rebuilt
[1:45:51] everybody okay
[1:45:54] in Matthew 24 the Bible said Jesus went
[1:45:58] out
[1:45:59] and departed from water the temple
[1:46:03] that was rebuilt and his disciple came
[1:46:06] to him
[1:46:07] for to show him the buildings of the
[1:46:09] Temple
[1:46:11] and Jesus said unto them see not all
[1:46:14] these things
[1:46:16] all this big building
[1:46:18] verily I say unto you they shall not be
[1:46:22] left water here here water one stone a
[1:46:25] little bit higher my brother one stone
[1:46:27] what can you give him a little bit
[1:46:28] before him I want to hear him
[1:46:30] amen there shall not be left here one
[1:46:34] storm upon another that shall not be
[1:46:37] water so Jesus prophesy about the
[1:46:40] destruction of this Temple again
[1:46:43] and who destroyed that Temple again
[1:46:50] can I continue I will avenge myself
[1:46:53] because of my temple
[1:46:55] everybody okay Rome destroyed the temple
[1:46:59] because David says this
[1:47:02] he said oh God the hidden I'll come into
[1:47:06] that inheritance
[1:47:08] the Holy Temple have the water he
[1:47:12] defiled his temple in heaven he despised
[1:47:15] the Temple of Solomon he came and
[1:47:18] destroyed the body of Jesus Christ now
[1:47:21] there is another Temple again
[1:47:23] hey everybody okay he said the Holy
[1:47:26] Temple have dead defiled they have led
[1:47:28] Jerusalem on Hebrew the dead bodies of
[1:47:31] that servant have they given to be meat
[1:47:34] unto the fowl of the heaven the Flesh of
[1:47:37] descent unto the Beast of the earth
[1:47:39] their blood have they shed like water
[1:47:42] water like water round about Jerusalem
[1:47:45] and there was none to bury them was
[1:47:48] David at that time
[1:47:52] [Music]
[1:47:54] everybody okay
[1:47:56] was David in this town
[1:47:59] David C Babylon David was the second
[1:48:02] king in Israel
[1:48:04] and David said by the river of Babylon
[1:48:08] there we sat down
[1:48:10] did David see when Babylon was destroyed
[1:48:13] he was so many so many years so many
[1:48:17] kings down the road but David spoke like
[1:48:20] he was there
[1:48:23] because the Bible said that David was a
[1:48:26] prophet that's why brother Branham says
[1:48:28] that you know that some are not only
[1:48:31] sung but they are water prophecy and the
[1:48:35] Bible say when you are home begin to
[1:48:37] pray to the Lord using some
[1:48:41] prophetic songs
[1:48:45] everybody okay did you know that did you
[1:48:48] have to read the second Psalm where the
[1:48:50] very word of Jesus spoke his last word
[1:48:53] that the cross was recorded in the
[1:48:55] second in the 22nd Psalm my God my God
[1:48:59] why has that forsaken me how did they
[1:49:02] condemn themselves by blaspheming the
[1:49:05] Holy Ghost calling the spirit of God an
[1:49:07] unclean Spirit made fun of him when they
[1:49:11] were dancing in the spirit and so forth
[1:49:13] on the day of water Pentecost so on the
[1:49:16] day of Pentecostal
[1:49:18] when the Holy Ghost came and the people
[1:49:20] came and look at them they said they are
[1:49:22] like drunk people God sent Rome again
[1:49:26] and Rome came and destroyed the table
[1:49:29] the the temple by Titus brother pranam
[1:49:32] said that same city they made fun of it
[1:49:35] that is killed them and there and their
[1:49:38] blood did what run out run out of the
[1:49:41] water because David spoke like he's
[1:49:43] gonna be like a river
[1:49:46] everybody okay everybody okay so far we
[1:49:49] good
[1:49:50] so now in First Corinthians chapter 3
[1:49:54] the Bible said now you know that year
[1:49:57] the water temple of God so the fifth
[1:50:00] Temple is the bread
[1:50:08] can I continue
[1:50:12] and that the spirit of God dwareth in
[1:50:14] you if any man defiled the temple of God
[1:50:18] by smoking by fornication by adultery by
[1:50:24] drug by alcohol he shall God do what
[1:50:28] destroy because God is going to avenge
[1:50:31] himself
[1:50:32] on his Temple
[1:50:36] everybody okay
[1:50:37] everybody okay for the temple of God is
[1:50:40] Holy which temper
[1:50:43] what know ye not that your water body is
[1:50:47] the Temple of water the Holy Ghost the
[1:50:49] Holy Ghost which is in you which he have
[1:50:51] of God and ye are not of your own so
[1:50:54] your body is a temple of God
[1:50:57] and when Rome was destroying the
[1:51:00] Christian he was destroying the temple
[1:51:03] of God
[1:51:06] and what agreement has the temple of God
[1:51:09] with other for ye are the water the
[1:51:12] Temple of the Living God as God has said
[1:51:16] our dwell in them and walk in them and I
[1:51:19] will be their God and they shall be
[1:51:21] water my people praise God in the book
[1:51:24] of second Thessalonians
[1:51:27] this Temple that was destroyed the
[1:51:30] second time by Rome by tadas will be
[1:51:33] rebuilt again
[1:51:36] around
[1:51:40] it won't be rebuilt together the Temple
[1:51:43] of Solomon will be rebuilt again and
[1:51:46] that's going to happen
[1:51:47] when in the tribulation where you have
[1:51:51] Moses and Elijah
[1:51:55] amen
[1:51:56] first temple defile second destroy
[1:52:00] God destroy fourth destroy fifth the
[1:52:04] bread fairly Nasir
[1:52:08] amen because of Rome everybody okay the
[1:52:12] fifth one is the Temple of Solomon
[1:52:14] rebuilt again what is the devil doing to
[1:52:17] that Temple
[1:52:19] let no man deceive you by any means for
[1:52:22] that day shall not come except they
[1:52:25] cometh Falling Away first that man of
[1:52:28] sin be revealed the son of water who are
[1:52:32] positive and exalted himself above all
[1:52:34] remember Lucifer that is called God or
[1:52:38] that is worship so that he has what city
[1:52:42] in water the temple of God the
[1:52:44] Antichrist will sit in the temple of God
[1:52:49] showing himself that he is what so wrong
[1:52:53] the pope was sitting this Temple
[1:52:56] [Music]
[1:52:59] can I continue how many temples do we
[1:53:02] have so far
[1:53:05] seven Temple
[1:53:07] the Bible says in the seventh heavens of
[1:53:10] Daniel
[1:53:11] the last purpose was to anoint the most
[1:53:15] holy
[1:53:16] you can read it at home
[1:53:18] what is the most holy
[1:53:21] brother Branham says what is the most
[1:53:23] holy to my way of seeing it which I
[1:53:27] believe I can prove it by the scripture
[1:53:29] is to anoint the water which will be the
[1:53:33] water
[1:53:34] that will be used during water because
[1:53:37] in armaged on everything will be
[1:53:39] destroyed
[1:53:41] but when we come back to live for a
[1:53:43] thousand here here we must have a temple
[1:53:50] we must have a church we will rebuild
[1:53:53] again another church

[1:54:00] watch the description of the temple that
[1:54:03] is to be built in the Millennium anyone

[2:02:33] controlling water if one percent control
[2:02:37] nandinana which power do they use
[2:02:41] which power can you control nothing how
[2:02:44] can you be one person controlling 99
[2:02:47] people
[2:02:48] you must help you what can you say it

[2:03:27] communism it is nothing in the world but
[2:03:30] a bunch of people that is nothing but
[2:03:32] water
[2:03:34] it is a water system is not telling you
[2:03:38] that your brother who believes the
[2:03:40] message about Barbarian
[2:03:45] you need to study this message
[2:03:48] it is a system
[2:03:52] before somebody come and say he talked

[2:03:57] hey everybody okay by the problem say
[2:04:00] let me show you something just to show
[2:04:03] how simple it is why there is only one
[2:04:06] percent of our right side that is what
[2:04:08] communism they need a messenger
[2:04:13] one percent cannot continue
[2:04:16] damn 99 of them are still on the water

[2:04:39] that ought to explain it to you right
[2:04:42] there if God didn't permit it well then
[2:04:46] be thrown out long ago brother Branham
[2:04:49] say there is no way one percent can
[2:04:53] control 99
[2:04:55] it is God that allowed that to happen
[2:04:58] because if not this power could have
[2:05:02] been already overtone
[2:05:04] Putin can leave the power and put
[2:05:07] somebody there and come back again and
[2:05:10] he's again the president
[2:05:13] what power does he have it is all under
[2:05:17] the control of God

[2:07:35] moving I don't want you to get lost here
[2:07:38] verse two and I saw in a vision this is
[2:07:41] not physical
[2:07:43] and he came to pass when I saw that I
[2:07:46] was a shushan in the palace
[2:07:51] is not Babylon
[2:07:53] it is the kingdom of what remember the
[2:07:55] Book of Esther
[2:07:57] it's the kingdom of the Persian so he's
[2:08:00] under baltaza he's under Babylon but God
[2:08:04] took him in Persia
[2:08:07] are we okay follow me carefully
[2:08:09] everybody okay
[2:08:11] I was in the palace which is in the
[2:08:14] province of Elam and I saw a vision and
[2:08:18] I was by the river Ule
[2:08:21] you live then I lift up my eyes and I
[2:08:26] sow and behold they stood before me
[2:08:28] before the river and water ran
[2:08:35] a ram which had how many horns two horns
[2:08:39] they cannot continue
[2:08:42] Kingdom of Russia Isabel

[2:08:48] remember one that is stronger that
[2:08:51] destroyed Babylon with holding the
[2:08:53] Trinity of Babylon but not the other
[2:08:56] side
[2:08:57] everybody here so when the bear is
[2:08:59] rising he's rising in one side he's not
[2:09:01] using the other
[2:09:04] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:09:08] can I say something again if I do this
[2:09:11] Imam make you think like this foot is
[2:09:14] shorter than the other

[2:09:20] why are you saying that
[2:09:22] can you go back here with me verse three
[2:09:24] and then I lift up my eyes and I saw
[2:09:28] behold that stood before me a ram which
[2:09:30] had two horns and the two one
[2:09:34] but one was what then the water do you
[2:09:38] understand why I say that
[2:09:41] everybody okay so the bear has two sides
[2:09:44] one side seems to be stronger
[2:09:49] than the other amen now we found that
[2:09:53] there is a realm that's why I told you
[2:09:55] follow me and the ham have how many
[2:09:57] horns two horns but one horn is higher
[2:10:04] than the other before we go what is a
[2:10:06] Horner
[2:10:08] brother
[2:10:10] we found the realm.com
[2:10:12] the realm is by the river

[2:10:17] means water a kingdom
[2:10:19] one
[2:10:21] we have been through that a haunt means
[2:10:24] water
[2:10:24] everybody okay so there is two Kingdom
[2:10:28] or two power that are coming up with
[2:10:30] this one
[2:10:31] we okay
[2:10:32] one is higher they are the one is tall
[2:10:37] long but it's not that higher in other
[2:10:39] words it's a little bit shorter than the
[2:10:41] other one everybody okay

[2:10:48] I'm in verse three but one that was
[2:10:51] higher than the other and the higher
[2:10:54] came up what so the kingdom start with
[2:10:57] the the weakest part
[2:10:59] but the end of that Kingdom the highest
[2:11:02] part would take over
[2:11:04] amen everybody okay do you follow me if
[2:11:08] you look at Russia this Christian but
[2:11:11] the one who's dominating is the one
[2:11:13] percent he's the one that is stronger

[2:26:51] a part of a Christian side
[2:26:54] how are you Lord did I lose you he said
[2:26:59] he rescued and they wander in heaven and
[2:27:01] on Earth who has delivered Daniel from

[2:27:07] in the reign of the riots and in the
[2:27:10] reign of savage the water
[2:27:12] he was not just a bad Kingdom
[2:27:15] let's go back to Daniel 8.
[2:27:18] can I continue
[2:27:20] that's why brother Branham made such a
[2:27:22] statement he says about one-third or
[2:27:26] two-thirds of the population of United
[2:27:27] States goes to church
[2:27:29] and his church member but they control
[2:27:32] in those domination they are in those
[2:27:34] denominations what communism need over
[2:27:38] there is a voice of God rise up among
[2:27:41] them and it will be put towards shame in
[2:27:44] Finland when that little boy was raised
[2:27:46] from the dead that day and they was
[2:27:49] bringing me three square away where this
[2:27:52] little fellow was raised up the Dead
[2:27:55] the rising up of the Dead
[2:27:58] did something to the king brother
[2:28:00] Branham went to Finland roused the
[2:28:03] little boy from the dead what is he
[2:28:05] gonna do to the middle vision of today
[2:28:10] Spirits don't die
[2:28:13] Spirit don't die
[2:28:15] history repeats itself what is he gonna
[2:28:19] do today nowadays more than the middle
[2:28:21] patient brother Branham said communist
[2:28:23] Soldier Russia standing there with the
[2:28:26] righteous salute and the water Jesus
[2:28:31] because they saw the resurrection
[2:28:34] all right they saw the power of
[2:28:37] Resurrection like Darius saw the power
[2:28:40] of resurrection and they said we will
[2:28:43] water we and God duck and water a God
[2:28:47] that can put Daniel and put Daniel from
[2:28:50] The Lion then we will receive that God
[2:28:52] just like Darius received the god

[2:33:40] different manifestations the red dragon
[2:33:43] and the old serpent which is the devil
[2:33:46] and Satan it can be a dragon or he can
[2:33:49] be a serpent it is the same person
[2:33:53] it is a God it is a leopard it is the
[2:33:57] same Kingdom but the God is flying
[2:34:00] because when you check the leopard you
[2:34:02] will see Wings on the back of the
[2:34:04] leopard that is what is making the goat
[2:34:06] fly
[2:34:07] any question
[2:34:09] let's go back again to verse 5.
[2:34:14] glory to God Amen and
[2:34:18] touching not
[2:34:19] and the God had a notable horn between
[2:34:22] his eyes which we saw that he was the
[2:34:24] first king which was Alexander the Great
[2:34:27] amen
[2:34:29] verse 6 and he came to the realm that
[2:34:32] had two on which I had sinned standing
[2:34:35] before the river and run to him in Fury
[2:34:38] of his power and I saw him come close to
[2:34:42] the realm and he was moved with Cole
[2:34:45] angry bitterness against him and smoked
[2:34:50] the ram stop
[2:34:52] watch carefully the goat never attacked
[2:34:56] the bear
[2:34:59] do you follow me God cannot attack bear
[2:35:03] even a horse cannot move where he buries
[2:35:06] anybody here they go to uses the easy
[2:35:11] part of the Kingdom he attacked the
[2:35:13] rampart did you follow me he didn't
[2:35:16] attack the Bell the Bell will destroy
[2:35:19] the the the the uh the goat quickly
[2:35:22] everybody okay he's attacking the realm
[2:35:26] everybody okay
[2:35:27] job to verse seven and there was no
[2:35:30] power in the realm to stand before him
[2:35:33] but he cast him down to the ground and
[2:35:36] step upon him and there was none that
[2:35:39] could deliver the realm Out of Heaven
[2:35:40] the Kingdom of Middle prison fell he
[2:35:44] fell by a goat remember that the God is
[2:35:48] what destroys the realm
[2:35:51] you're gonna see who's the goat
[2:35:53] everybody okay
[2:35:55] everybody okay
[2:35:56] verse 9 then the God works very great
[2:36:01] the kingdom increase and when he was
[2:36:03] strong the Great Horn was water
[2:36:06] Alexander the Great was killed
[2:36:09] I'm trying to save time amen and for it
[2:36:12] came water
[2:36:15] stop let's go back to the leopard how
[2:36:18] many head have developer but at the
[2:36:21] beginning they were all hooked together
[2:36:23] it was one power because Alexander had
[2:36:27] four General
[2:36:28] that was fighting for him but after the
[2:36:31] death of Alexander the Great the kingdom
[2:36:34] was divided in four that's why they have
[2:36:36] four wings and four head there were four
[2:36:39] General Andy Alexander the Great who was
[2:36:41] the horn everybody okay
[2:36:43] it's a book of Daniel that's how it is
[2:36:46] everybody okay he say verse 8 and they
[2:36:50] go towards very good and when he was
[2:36:52] strong the Great Horn was broken and he
[2:36:55] came up four notable one two of the Four
[2:36:57] Winds of water Heaven amen
[2:37:00] you there everybody clear
[2:37:05] hold here go to Daniel 11.
[2:37:09] Lord help me
[2:37:12] Hallelujah
[2:37:16] amen amen are you there first one
[2:37:20] Daniel 11 is more complicated than you
[2:37:22] think
[2:37:23] also in the first year of the Rios the
[2:37:25] meeting
[2:37:26] I even I stood confirmed to confirm and
[2:37:30] to strengthen him Daniel was doing that
[2:37:32] the king loved him and now will I show
[2:37:35] you the truth behold they shall stand up
[2:37:37] three kings
[2:37:39] in Persia and the fourth shall be father
[2:37:42] Rich than all then they all and by his
[2:37:45] strength through his riches he shall
[2:37:47] stir up against the realm of what
[2:37:50] so the fourth King will do something
[2:37:54] that will cause Alexander to come
[2:37:56] against him amen verse 3 and a mighty
[2:38:00] king shall stand up and that shall rule
[2:38:03] with great Dominion Alexander the Great
[2:38:05] and do according to his will and when he
[2:38:08] shall stand up his kingdom shall be
[2:38:11] watered broken and shall be divided
[2:38:13] toward the water four ways four wings of
[2:38:16] Heaven you see four again because it's
[2:38:18] the Greek Empire and not to his
[2:38:21] posterity because Alexander died with a
[2:38:23] baby he didn't have a hair not according
[2:38:26] to his Dominion which he rule for his
[2:38:29] kingdom shall be platter even for other
[2:38:31] beside water so Alexander goes to four
[2:38:35] because he was four head put together
[2:38:37] when the king is gone alone he divided
[2:38:40] Four Kings taken any question let's go
[2:38:43] back to Daniel chapter eight and then we
[2:38:44] run to the airport I can't reach where I
[2:38:46] want to go
[2:38:48] if you're there you can say Amen the
[2:38:51] first Dual Purpose remember Greek is a
[2:38:54] leopard but Greek also is a goat
[2:38:57] those two Kingdom have Duo vote they
[2:39:00] have a compound meaning they can be good
[2:39:03] and leopard this one can be bear and RAM
[2:39:06] what does he have to do with you
[2:39:09] amen verse 9 you there
[2:39:12] when the kingdom was divided by four
[2:39:15] general of Alexander
[2:39:16] what happened
[2:39:18] and out of one of them one of the
[2:39:21] general came forth a what
[2:39:24] a little horn which was exceedingly what
[2:39:27] great my brother is there toward the
[2:39:31] South toward the East and toward the
[2:39:33] water
[2:39:34] the pleasant land is another name for
[2:39:37] Israel
[2:39:38] so the last Kingdom that followed the
[2:39:41] Greek kingdom was the kingdom of Rome
[2:39:43] you remember but he came here as a
[2:39:46] little horn and it's going straight
[2:39:49] toward Israel everybody okay
[2:39:51] now let's go to verse 10. and he watched
[2:39:55] great this horn
[2:39:57] what I want you to remember it is the
[2:40:00] goat
[2:40:01] that destroyed the realm
[2:40:04] and it's out of the goat horn that made
[2:40:07] way for Rome
[2:40:10] Rome was birthed from the goat
[2:40:14] do you follow me I'm gonna go somewhere
[2:40:16] then hit the airport it's a military
[2:40:18] airplane hang on Amen verse 10 and he
[2:40:22] works great even to the host of water
[2:40:25] this little horn
[2:40:27] came so great until he went all the way
[2:40:31] to heaven
[2:40:32] amen watch with me and he did what
[2:40:37] my brother I need volume and he did what
[2:40:40] cast down cast down Waters some of the
[2:40:44] water and of the waters to the water
[2:40:47] does he ring a bell
[2:40:51] does he win the bear
[2:40:53] does he win the best somewhere
[2:40:57] does he ring a bell
[2:41:02] I see the red dragon having seven horns
[2:41:06] and water and seven Crown upon him and
[2:41:09] he still drew the water
[2:41:11] of the star of water and cast them to
[2:41:15] the water so which is this horn
[2:41:20] you need to know how to read the
[2:41:22] scripture he uses different symbols but
[2:41:26] it's the same spirit
[2:41:28] everybody okay he cuts down some of the
[2:41:31] hosts of the star to the ground and
[2:41:34] stamp them upon them
[2:41:35] yeah he magnified himself even to the
[2:41:39] priests of the host which is Jesus
[2:41:42] and by him the water the daily sacrifice
[2:41:45] the 70 weeks of Daniel the damage
[2:41:48] sacrifice was what taken away and the
[2:41:51] place of his Sanctuary was water yes
[2:41:53] when Jesus was killed that this came and
[2:41:56] destroyed the temple and stopped the
[2:41:59] sacrifice of God
[2:42:00] who did that room
[2:42:02] so Rome was birthed from Greece
[2:42:10] everybody okay
[2:42:11] everybody okay
[2:42:13] job to verse 8 12. and a horse was
[2:42:17] giving him against the deadly Sacrifice
[2:42:20] by reason of transgression because the
[2:42:23] Jews sin and he cast down the water who
[2:42:27] is the truth
[2:42:28] I am the truth the way and uh he cuts
[2:42:33] down Jesus Christ amen to the ground
[2:42:36] like a rose trample on the ground amen
[2:42:40] any practice and prosper
[2:42:43] then I heard one of the Saints speaking
[2:42:46] to another sin saying to a certain scent
[2:42:48] which spoke how long shall this Vision
[2:42:50] be
[2:42:52] anybody okay
[2:42:54] job I'm gonna skip this
[2:42:57] because of time
[2:42:59] and see where I can drop here amen
[2:43:04] oh my God
[2:43:11] let me see again
[2:43:13] job to verse 25 and I'm gonna try to
[2:43:15] skip this
[2:43:17] because it's again deeper
[2:43:20] I don't want to lose somebody
[2:43:22] amen
[2:43:23] and through his policy also he shall
[2:43:27] cause crap to prosper in Israel he shall
[2:43:30] magnify himself in his heart Lucifer and
[2:43:33] by peace the pope very good shall
[2:43:36] destroy many and he shall also stand up
[2:43:39] against the Prince of Peace Jesus Christ
[2:43:42] but he shall be broken without water
[2:43:45] remember that storm that was coming down
[2:43:47] with that hand so what I'm trying to say
[2:43:50] here is that this God was the one that
[2:43:55] generated the kingdom of Rome but
[2:43:58] Ibraham says that the star of Heaven
[2:44:00] represents the spirit of man and when
[2:44:03] the red dragon Roam and there is
[2:44:06] persecution had the thirds of the star
[2:44:09] and cast them down there was at the
[2:44:11] water crucified the crucifixion of the
[2:44:14] Lord Jesus Christ when they rejected him
[2:44:16] and they cast him and had nothing to do
[2:44:19] with him there was that third part of
[2:44:22] angelic star Angelic water so my point
[2:44:26] here is out of the Greek Empire camera
[2:44:33] but
[2:44:35] this Kingdom Isabel
[2:44:38] it can be around this one is a goat
[2:44:42] and it's a leopard
[2:44:44] and it's the one that gave birth
[2:44:47] to Rome Rome didn't come out of the
[2:44:50] leopard he have the leopard on himself
[2:44:53] in Revelation 11 I mean 13 but the one
[2:44:57] who birthed him was one of the goat
[2:44:59] horns amen what are you trying to say
[2:45:02] I'm gonna skip this amen we know that
[2:45:06] Greek there is something specific about
[2:45:09] Greek
[2:45:10] right the Bible says that the Jews
[2:45:14] require a son
[2:45:16] cannot continue now hang on put your
[2:45:19] seat belt I'm gonna head to the airport
[2:45:21] because my time is up everybody okay
[2:45:23] the Greek we got the Jews we require
[2:45:26] water and the Greeks seek after water
[2:45:29] wisdom Greek seek after wisdom
[2:45:34] the Greek Empire is an Empire that is
[2:45:38] after wisdom but we know that there is
[2:45:41] two kind of wisdom
[2:45:44] everybody okay there is a wisdom of God
[2:45:47] which is Christ
[2:45:49] and there is another wisdom which is of
[2:45:52] the devil and the wisdom of the world
[2:45:55] amen which wisdom does the Greek seek
[2:46:00] Paul says that your faith should not
[2:46:03] stand in the wisdom of man
[2:46:05] but in the water power of God habit we
[2:46:08] speak wisdom among them that are perfect
[2:46:11] yet not the wisdom of what the world
[2:46:14] none of the places of water that comes
[2:46:18] water
[2:46:20] this wisdom descended not from heaven
[2:46:23] but it's water it's water and it's water
[2:46:27] so the Greek out the people that seek
[2:46:32] after the devil's wisdom
[2:46:36] cannot continue
[2:46:38] Paul went to ask him
[2:46:40] and the Bible says that we are Paul

[3:07:34] last the hour they are living in and
