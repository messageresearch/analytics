[0:26] You can do your you can go with for your
[0:30] exercise

[0:51] wrong with it. Amen. But not for
[0:53] competition and begin to think about
[0:56] going to NFL, going to NBA, then become
[1:00] millionaire, then give mommy and daddy
[1:02] your money. Most of the time the problem
[1:04] start from the parent
[1:07] &gt;&gt; because the delinquency is coming from
[1:08] the parent.
[1:09] &gt;&gt; The parent are looking for money so
[1:11] quick. So they're pushing the children
[1:13] towards sport, sport, sport, sport,
[1:15] sport. And before you know it, you find

[1:19] that are progressing in NFL.
