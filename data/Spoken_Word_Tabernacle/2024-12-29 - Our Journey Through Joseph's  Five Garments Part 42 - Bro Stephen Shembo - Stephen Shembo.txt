our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ both visible and invisible audience amen you might be seated a little bit if there is any family member here new person first time God richly bless you and welcome to spoken word Tabernacle and uh for the invisible audience I apologize uh last Sunday we had a problem with a computer but thank God we had a backup system so the whole sermon was kept so if you are looking for the sermon on the same under the same link it's now working the sermon has been uploaded Again on YouTube so if you search for Part 41 you will find it it's there and we apologize again by God's grace actually I had a computer bought for two month almost and I left at home and I didn't have a time to get it to work on it so the old Betsy computer that I got used to was already playing around some glitch here and there I say you know what let me keep working with it it's still working so the mask was not working properly and I use the manual one and then keep moving until last Sunday so I got my message like it's over and enough it's enough go ahead and switch the computer and get a brand new one amen so by God's grace I did everything last night and he works I believe the day before last night it works perfect everything is working smoothly without any problem so all is well amen Oh Glory to God so for some reason I don't know why the Lord allowed that but he didn't want that sermon to be preached last Sunday he pushed everything this coming Sunday today amen so I believe we up to date with the sermon we reading our Bible twice a day I even heard uh brother brandham saying you need to study the Bible true so now it's not just reading the Bible now it's now to study the Bible amen he didn't say brother study the Bible because the tendency is that's for brother and the sister completely Escape he said you need to study the Bible so brother and sister you need to study the Bible amen and then I believe we're reading our cood book our church ages 70 weeks of Daniel the seals adoption or somebody is listening to the message of the hour amen just to give some clarification this coming Tuesday which is December the 31st that will be our new year service and that is considered to be our midweek service so meaning we don't have service on Wednesday so Wednesday you stay with your family spend some quality time and uh catch up and make some uh uh sit down and draw some plans for 2025 and what you're going to be accomplishing by the grace of God and talk things over and iron things and clean up everything and we move on Amen so it will be this coming Tuesday at 8:00 p.m. so we start not at 7:30 at 8:00 p.m. all the way to midnight so we already start having that flavor of magnify the Lord so you can feel that atmosphere of worship amen and Lord's willing we will have also the Lord supper we clear on that one so 8:00 p.m. we see you all the way to midnight so if you need to eat make sure you eat you relax at home so we get here until 2025 the only thing that's going to stop is if the Lord comes then we leave everything and we go home amen and then on the oncoming year I don't have any date for question and answer yet brother Glenn is still working on it but the young man is on February the the 1st the young sister is on February the 22nd and the married couple is on March the 22nd which is going to be part five Lord's willing amen so you pray for us we got a lot to do this year I'm in a silent mode like I say all we have is whatever we have and faith and the Lord will provide because he is Jehovah jarra the way we operate in this church is completely a miracle and the way this church stand and move and accomplish things it is nothing but a miracle of God the credit is not to me the credit is unto the Lord Jesus Christ amen so we thank the Lord for everything that he have done for us until today and he will do more again if he tell you to come amen so this sermon today it's a little bit deeper okay all right so you stay tuned stay alert and I'll try the best that I can because it's easier to preach a sermon quickly and then we go and we assume that everybody got it but by the end of the day after 10 years of message you sit with people you talk to them you wonder how many sermon book did they read my friend you got the microphone amen you cannot be in this message 30 years and you already and you only read only 10 sermon something is wrong oh you listen only to five sermon something is wrong amen if you're 30 years you you you you you you should be done by the churches the 70 weeks all those things should be clarified and I know why I insist on the church ages because it's like a foundation Amen brother brandham uses so many scripture and the det and so many Doctrine and lay the ground correctly so if you don't have that you are actually in the air you don't even know how to fight for yourself amen so we will go slowly today and try to make sure we get down to where we going amen amen you know I came back up I'm under commission I was trying to preach this it didn't work out so by God's grace I don't have any choice he might hurt but if it hurts that's okay I'm on the commission I got to deliver the message of the hour Amen brother Bram say his ministry is different than Oro Robert he say Oro Robert he line up people lay hand on them and then they go and then tomorrow they can go back again in trouble brother Bram say but that's not the way his ministry is he say his ministry he need to find the cause of the problem because under the anointing the devil can go and wait for you outside of the church and as soon as you come outside of the church the Devil comes back again because the root have not been removed are we together so we if we don't go deep in the root to catch whatever is troubling Us in the root we will never be a bble to remove it that's why certain Spirit linger in this message because they were not dealt with all the way to the root amen and every time you try to go deep in the root then the first thing is preacher will attack you saying that okay we can have all this knowledge but uh uh you can have all this knowledge but what about life yes we have life amen if you have a problem with knowledge then you have a problem with brother Bram because the knowledge we have in this message was preached by Brother Bram and if you have a problem with what was preached by Brother Branham then you don't even believe the message maybe you staying in the message for a paycheck are we together are we together I didn't preach the seals brother Brandon preach it I didn't preach the 70 weeks of Daniel he preaching he preached Revelation one Revelation 4 Revelation that big knowledge deep that we have comes from the message of the hour and you hear people in the message okay do we need all this knowledge to go to the Rapture of course you do do you think God was wasting his time and usually if you chase down you will find they already struggling in their walk with the Lord amen if what we need is give our life to the Lord and then be baptized you already did it so we might just stay at home amen and God wasted his time from 1933 all the way to 1965 something is wrong with you amen my people perish amen amen for lack of knowledge and the Bible say my people go to captivity because of lack of knowledge and God brought us the clear pure knowledge of the word of God by the message of the hour and the first thing we go is well it's intellectual so brother Bram is the greatest intellectual because he's the one that started with it I'm only under commission to repeat brother brandham amen a jealousy spirit amen if you cannot dig where somebody's digging stay where you are but appreciate the other person amen sister y cannot sing here with us I mean brother set and she cannot sing without the drummer she cannot sing without the one playing the guitar you need everybody amen but if she sing good and then the one playing the guitar say she's not singing good you got a problem we need you you need her you need brother John you need the song leader everybody is needed amen amen amen amen so stay in tune and let's dig right deep and see what is coming up today amen amen praise be to the name of the Lord glory to God my computer is working nice and smooth amen amen that's why I don't usually when I deal with people normally my counseling Take 2 hours 3 hours and sometime more because we got to go deep yes corre we cannot deal with you today and then in two month you come back again then I deal with you again then we playing games and you wearing me down amen amen let's let's take your time take 5 hours let's sit down let's go deeper that's right let's start from your childhood and let's climb from there and then when we climb we climb before we get 3 hours somehow brother Robert knows what I'm talking about brother Glenn knows what I'm talking about usually I don't even pray and you see a Deliverance breaking down because we learn by the prophet to go down in the root if not you will be playing games old change old change old change old change and the preacher becomes like the one I mean uh with a jump booster so your battery is down we come and we jump you and you go back again and uhhh we need to fix the alter we need to fix the glitch and make sure you can recharge your own battery amen and you can be free Amen in other word we are preaching you to be independent between you and God of course the pastor will continue to be there but you must have a personal relationship between you and God so if you call me I cannot answer your phone call you can talk to God amen Amen brother Bram is gone the pillar of fire is still there are we together glory to God let's go to our scripture this morning my subject this morning remember I have this message since last week okay uh I have this message since last week I got my old computer he has it this is a new computer I just transferred so don't put in your mind that I'm attacking you because of what you put on Instagram or the text you send to people or what you put on Twitter or what you put on whatspp I have this sermon since last week and I told you last week watch what you're doing you remember that if you remember that ra your hand ah so don't don't come this morning and say okay you saw me at Walmart or you saw me and whatever that's why you pray hey he hey he hey hey and now I'm fighting amen amen amen okay my subject this morning is our life journey through Joseph's fa garment Part 42 amen the theme this morning is the Cal yes oh God or the Bullock amen and B Jezebel if you remember this is familiar to last week I gave you the title The Fed Cal and bell and Jezebel amen amen amen H so when I'm delivering this it comes from last week we clear amen okay so let's pray flight attendant you prepare for take off Heavenly Father Lord we approaching you humbly this morning Father we thank you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is as far as I can go with the ability you have given us Lord but when it comes to preach to interpret your word Lord Lord father you only take the supernatural action of the Holy Spirit Lord may you move me completely out of the way and this audience both visible and invisible and those that would listen let the Lord father that you may come and minister to us and bless our soul take this service from the beginning all the way to the end and bless us and and Lord father protect those that are traveling Lord or getting prepared to travel back home in these holidays in the name of Jesus Christ amen apology my wife had to take a quick trip but she's living today and she's coming so she won't be here amen okay glory to God let's go to Psalm 82 Oh Glory to God Psalm 82 if you thereare you can say amen amen the deeper your relationship with God the more your life changes correct amen amen if not brother Bram life would not have changed because when he get to the depth to the third pool the opening of the word then he got to a higher depth with the Lord you shall know the truth and the truth not the preacher the truth will set you free so our responsibility is to present the truth and let the truth deal with with you and you will be free amen if not we're playing Pentecostal games amen amen God stands in the congregation of the mighty and he judges among the gods you might be seated verse six I have said can you hear me okay amen I have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high amen amen this one we already explained this multiple time that this is verse six is a Divine record or a Divine part of you amen we are Gods it's deity amen this record is clean amen there is no floss to this record amen amen amen verse uh six and all of you are children of the most high but the one who's talking is God through prophecy but you shall die like men so the death doesn't Surpise God because God already know it's going to happen the one who say but it's God so God sees the trouble before he gets to you are we together God sees the trial before you get there God already seen it together he told Israel you're going to go in Egypt you will Sur there for 400 years and you will be slave over there and it happened and God spoke before Israel even went to Egypt so God already knows our journey before we even start are we together amen and he says and and if God already seen your tribe do you think that God will just fold his hand and be quiet matter of fact when a trial is disclosed or when a TR when uh when a when a trouble is already unveil it means there is already a solution are we together when the dream of pharaoh is interpreted he already give the solution for what is coming back what is coming down the road amen because God already saw it he saw what the enemy will do in your life it is not your fight it is the fight between God and Satan you are just put in the middle of the road and God and Satan are playing tag tag of War but we know who's going to win God in you Christ in you the hope of glory are we together he says and but you shall die like men and fall like one of the what princes so this one verse seven glory to God is your Earthly part amen this has to do with your flesh with your carnal nature amen so God already saw it just like he say I love Jacob amen before Jacob was even born are we together and I Can Am I this might shock you but I don't have any choice amen this part of you doesn't [Applause] S are we together are we together [Music] it's so sad that we preach the message for so long and the people in the message are so confused when the devil beat them down I'm sorry but I'm going to say this okay I just explained to somebody recently I'm just going to say this amen amen if you we have a sister okay a sister all right if we have a sister okay and she's a wonderful sister she's filled with the spirit of God amen amen baptized with the Holy Ghost she can you can sense it wonderful sister amen according to the way we measure ourself if we have 1 to 10 if we we have 0 to 10 amen when she got the Holy Ghost maybe all of us will give her that she's on level 10 are we together some of you who are too picky might put her maybe on level eight some who B heads with her because she got the Holy Ghost will put her on level of three or four amen but whether you didn't or not the sister got the Holy [Applause] [Music] Ghost are we together are we together please follow me carefully under normal condition of temperature and pressure are we together are we together this sister always behave good amen amen behave good amen and she shows maturity when you look at her she's a mature sister everything is good are we together now if this young sister get married follow me my friend and God bless her with a baby are we together the coming of the baby will create a secondary nature that has nothing to to do with her salvation are we together are we together pregnancy in this woman can change her behavior that's correct amen yes she might not be sitting on the second row as she's sitting as she used to she might be going to the bathroom 20 times are we together she might wake up in the morning with a mood yeah amen and before you know it we begin to remove all the holy ghost from heav are we together and we say no no no no that sister you you see you see what I was telling you no it is not theist her level with God will never drop down I don't know if you get what I'm saying she's still on level 10 but the pregnant she has caused a second nature but that nature doesn't change who she is I don't know if you get it I don't know if you get it brother brandham saw an ego that came down because of the storm the ego was still an ego the age of the ego didn't change he was still a mature ego he was just anded done in a different level and it make you think like the eag now have backing the ego have not all he tooks his flop her wings or his wings and before you know it the eagle is back again there so certain things that happen in our life amen want remove the holy ghost from you [Music] [Applause] [Music] are we together are we together are we together that's why David say restore unto me not my salvation the Salvation will go nowhere you rest store the joy of my salvation not the Salvation the problem is when we go into trial we think the Salvation have gone that's why you have young people in this message they will come to the altar 20 times every convention they in the altar because they were not taught right once you are seal is until the day of redemption no one can temper with that seal even the devil cannot touch that the only way the devil will touch that the devil must be converted to reach your level are we together Jesus was tired Jesus slept and the boat was rocking so what is the problem if it happened that you tired in your [Applause] life a little something ah I don't think I was saved I don't think I was saved when do you think you're going to be saved huh when you think you're going to be saved the sister still remain the sister what happened is the pregnancy as soon as that baby's out she's back again the way she was are we together are we together this record here doesn't se you didn't get me well you you here you don't see and you never even commit [Applause] [Music] any either you going to swallow this before we move on let me start it again this is brother Angelo this is brother Angelo God this brother Angelo never seen and will never seen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] if this brother Angel s then Jesus also can [Applause] S I don't know if you get what I'm saying yes sir Jesus died as a sinner right amen which part of him was sin so which part of you will be SE that's why I told you this one here never seen and will never seen the day this person is activated H this person doesn't sin this person may be traing sin [Music] in uh first John chapter 3 the Bible say whosoever whether a boy or a girl or an old man or a young man or a middle age or whatever you are whosoever is what born of God do not commit [Applause] [Music] sin I know what you're thinking oh yesterday I was I was repenting he doesn't commit sin why because he seed does what remain in him so the problem is not this envelope it is the seed and brother said that seed is the word of God because according to the the word of God is a seed because of that seed it's what blur the radar of [Applause] God don't worry my friend he said whosoever is born of God what does not commit sin for his seed does what remain in him what did he say that seed goes and come [Music] back that seed does what so when you were born brother Bram say God take it and put it there if God put a seed who can remove it the seed right there oh glory to God the Bible says and he cannot sin because why he is born of God brother Bram explain this a little bit this can turn into a different sermon he said you can sin oh I might be a sinner in your [Music] sight Shake somebody's hand tell the person am I be SE in your sight but I don't care about your sight because you might have an optical [Applause] illusion are we together am I look like a hypocrite to you that's your problem I am not a hypocrite I am not a sinner I am a pure child of God [Applause] as much as Jesus did not sin I cannot [Music] [Applause] s this Elementary my friend he said I might be SE away in your sight but if I am in Christ God doesn't see it it's because his blood at know for what my sins there see I can't sin he that is what born of God what a scriptural prophet he that is born of God does not commit what sin for what he cannot sin the seed of who God remain where in him he he's willing to if he makes a mistake sure he's right then willing to do what confess it if he's what a real Christian will do it if he hold it back he shows he ain't got what nothing in the nothing thing that bothers you when you do something wrong it shows you are a true [Music] Christian I don't know if I'm a Child of God why do why is he when you do something wrong he bothers you what bothers you Satan will bother you Satan want you to continue what is bothering you it is God bothering you it is God bothering you this person is clean he doesn't want trouble when you begin to bring trouble he he's allergic then he begin to put you uncomfortable like you bringing something that don't belong here go ahead and fix it clean it up are we together brother Bram say he chose he ain't got what in the first place that is right he has not got what nothing to begin with but if he is a what a real Christian so you they will you never seen and as hard as this can sound this one doesn't need an atonement take brother take brother do you serve God which sin Jesus say who can convince me of sin which atonement is it for the atonement amen is to take care of this guy right [Music] the blood works for this man right here it is the blood that cover this man and when he the in other word the blood the blood of God what the blood does when the blood comes the blood does this and when you ask God when you ask God who do you see there I see Angelo God I see logos God I see sister God I see y God I see Z God but but but but but what what but I don't see anything you the one seeing all of [Applause] that that's why Paul say when I come among you I want to know nothing about you except Christ and Christ only crucified I don't want to know about your pastor I want to know about God tell me about the God that is in you are we together are we together are we together we are Gods my friend and all of you are children of the most high you can push this I will continue to push it push it push it push it push it push it until as so even your your your lips so you can't throw up and You Hinder this Revelation until it's soak in I'm just trying to make a point in other way I wanted to stay there because you can't go to the Rapture as Elementary brother Bram say you need rapturing Faith to go into the Rapture and rapturing faith cannot come without this [Applause] [Music] message brother Bram say if you don't have faith for Divine Healing how are you going to believe you going to be changed what changes you is the mystery of God the seven tunders that was that were locked are we together let's go to Luke chapter [Music] 15 today you're a Christian tomorrow you're a sinner today youh you are the same you just had a pregnancy that made you behave funny amen after a while you back again that's right and usually after pregnancy the woman Blossom so after that trial you see me again blossoming yes sir Lord let's go to Luke 15 my friend amen amen we got to let those Elementary stuff away let's move on to perect Perfection amen so the Holy Ghost can be taken off from people like that God say he's sealing and then tomorrow it just because I got upset on the highway then the Holy Ghost is taken off of me to get that Holy Ghost I have to pray repent here repent and it's easily removed on Elijah told Elijah you are asking for something big and you just remove it like that when inside of you there is a predestinated seed which is a lock for the Holy Ghost it's a bond of perfection so how can you just break it like that the Holy Ghost is fire right amen amen I got upset because of number [Music] seven it's number seven that got upset me I don't get upset sometime have you seen sometime you you you are getting upset and you hear another you saying cool down cool down don't get up you never heard that experience it's like another you saying let him go let him go and another one is saying get him get him there is is a God and there is a human [Applause] being brother Bram say there are two two dog a white one and a black one a number six and another seven [Music] come on Amen then you start doubting your experience maybe I didn't get it that way ah so your wife got upset she doesn't have the Holy Ghost no no she got the Holy Ghost it's number seven my friend verse seven it's verse seven father I'm trying to move you see this sister right here yes you see the sister right here she loves she loves steaks do you follow me she likes steak so much a well done steak she loves her amen but when she's pregnant you can call a conference and explain how delicious it state is she's not going to eat that steak as soon as you put a steak right here she goes straight to the bathroom it is not her it is the [Applause] pregnancy Hall are we [Applause] together so who do you blame I'm asking you who do you blame so blame the pregnancy leave her alone so choose who you going to blame it's easy blame the devil blame the devil let's go to Luke 15 Oh Glory to God amen amen amen amen you can never convince her to eat a steak until she delivers that's why in certain state that people are you cannot tell them certain [Applause] [Music] things you have to remove them from that state first before they listen [Applause] because that state have already changed their taste the LA pickles am amen am amen amen that's why when you have an argument at home get off get off get off your message cannot be conveyed the state is not correct filter is already distorted give some time let off the [Applause] pressure I'm going to make my point okay continue making your point you will call me let her go Luke 15 free of charge my friend amen verse 11 if you there you can say amen amen when you go this right you take my minute I have not started the sermon and he said a certain man has what two sons we got two of them the Elder miari and the younger and the Elder is Israel all the Jews or man yes and the younger one is the Gentile and he was connected to harlot you know this clearly it's on verse 30 amen the oldest son explained that he spent the money with the Harlot and he and the younger one said to his father father give me the portion of goods that fell to me and he divided his living and not many days after the youngest son gather all together and took his journey journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living according to verse 30 he devour that with harlots remember that with harlots according to verse 30 amen specifically harlots amen because this one is Ephraim and Ephraim is the tribe that was connected to idolatry amen and the anointing of Ephraim is even a nox the B of it's a nox you know that right sir you know that right yes sir Israel had four banners there was a lion with Judah and then the the ox was Ephraim and then then was the the eagle we went through this and then the man was Ruben are we together and if you notice the two tribe that have adolar Tre was Dan and ephra so the ox and the eagle let's save it ready okay my friend are we together are we together amen jum to verse 17 and when he came to himself it means everything that he was doing he was not in himself are we together so this boy was doing all the riotous living that he was doing he was doing that by by verse seven are we together are we together but when he came to himself when he came back to verse six amen verse six will always point you back home to where you come from verse seven is what took you away but verse six is a GPS that point you back home are we together when he came to himself he said how many hired servant of my father have bread enough and and to spare and I perish with Hunger job to verse 20 then we can s and he arose and came to his father when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kiss him and the son said to him father I have seen sin goes with an offering I have seen a against heaven and to your sight but if you notice the sin he did it when he was not in himself so he did it by Ignorance by Amnesia he was not in himself he was not in the right man are we together because if he was in the right man he would not have done it that's why he said I am not worthy to be called your son in other word I read as a father like you cannot have a son that have done things the way I have done it that one that is talking is the part the Divine part the Earthly part is the one that enjoy with the Harlot are we together and the Bible says verse 22 but the father say to the servant bring forth the best R and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and bring here the what fat Cal and do what and kill it the fat was already there it was existed sir before he even made it home the fat was already there the the the the fatted Cal was already there but he could not be killed until he come [Music] to so there is a provided sacrifice amen when the boy was sinning back there amen and he have to be freshly killed remember that my friend amen they cannot use the old food that they cook yesterday amen this son require a fresh atonement a fresh food are we together and kill it and let us eat and be what married for this my son was what and he's now what alive again let's look at this scripture the son was dead and he's what alive dead and alive speak of a resurrection are we together and then he was what lost and what and is found this is those that are living amen amen the Bible didn't say he was lost and found and then dead and laugh the Bible say he was dead and alive then he was what and what dead and the life come first the one who Who start the Rapture is the dead in Christ I don't know if we the dead in Christ shall rise first then the living will be quickened that's why the Bible say dead and alive first then lost and found second it is the order of the Rapture [Applause] Hallelujah are we together if I lost you raise your hand L somebody in the back the Bible says one dead and alive which which speak about the resurrection because we got sent that were dead that need to be resurrected and the Bible say is then lost and found these are those that are living amen because when you dead you gone but the Bible instead of saying lost and found dead and alive he start first with dead and alive amen then lost and found because according to the Rapture those that died are going to be resurrected first they the one that change first and then the living will be Chang after so this scripture is giving you the order of the Rapture or the order of the Resurrection are we clear we're going to get into that thank you my friend now last Sunday as a summary we found out that when it comes to a sin offering Lord help me glory to God when it come to a sin offering let's go like a Sunday school when it comes to a sin offering amen when it's the Brad or the priesthood you remember this now it is a calf or a bulock we clear when it comes to the people or Israel of the congregation then it is a kid or a goat when I saw this I stop calling my children kid brother BR said that's the reason why I don't call you kid I gave you the code because kid means goat but I can call you lamb so call your children lamb are we together because God got B head ah my kid are not goat the children in this church are lamb if you don't want to claim them I claim them as a pastor they are all lamps of God are we together now when it come to the scene of ignorance are we together then the priest the Brad and Israel Reed the same sacrifice which is a cal or a bulock we clear let's go to judges 13 then let's s my friend Lord have mercy Judges 13 if you move quickly so we can go we very good on and usually when I say this that's when times let's go judges 13:14 if you thereare you can say amen amen please follow me carefully y okay verse 14 this is the story about the parent of Samson it's manoah and his wife okay follow me carefully verse 14 she this is the Angel of the Lord talking let's go to 13 so you get the picture and the angel of the Lord said to manoah the father of Samson Samson of all that I say to the woman let her be aware beware she may not eat of anything that comes of the vine amen neither let her drink wine or strong drink it's a Nazar vow nor eat any unclean thing all that I commanded her let her observe verse 15 and manoah said to the angel of the Lord follow me my friend I pray you let us detain you in either word keep you until we have made ready a what kid a kid for you so after the angel of the Lord delivered the message they wanted to offer a sacrifice to this Angel of the Lord and remember Samson came from the tribe of them it's in your Bible you can verify this verse at home I'm trying to save time are we together and then he says we're going to give him a kid which is a goat amen so this off in is a goat we clear a kid for you and the angel of the Lord said to manoah though you detain me in other word even though you keep me I will not eat of your bread because the form that God appear here he appears as an angel and an angel doesn't eat natural food right God eat only when he veil in human flesh and I'm going to go there and you will see what did God eat we will get there slowly my friend are we together are we together but in an Angelic form God cannot eat anything that's why Jesus told the disciple a ghost a spirit doesn't have Flesh and Blood give me a piece of chicken they give him uh I mean fish and he took the fish I say chicken for our day uh so don't come and say where did he say chicken they say fish and they give him a fish and he ate are we together now he says though you detain me I will not eat of the of your bread and if you will offer a burnt offering you must offer it to the Lord for manoah knew not that he was an angel of the Lord you're going to see that it's the angel they call him sometime an angel you remember last Sunday vers uh uh uh 17 and man Noah said to who the angel did they say an angel again so the angel of the Lord is God he say to the angel of the Lord what is your name that when you that when your saying come to pass we may do you honor in other words when whatever you say is accomplished we can praise you honor you right what is your name if you notice this name was still Secret but today we know the name are we together it's a name when you speak a dead baby comes to life it is the name of Jesus Christ but it could not be disclosed in the Old Testament because Jesus have to declare the name are we together Verse 18 He says and the angel of the Lord said to him why ask you D after my name seeing it is what it is not time for you to know it yet are we together this is not your time amen why do you want to know that name prise God but today we know the name amen he said so man Noah took a kid with a what offering with a meat offering brother brandham used the word meal offering it's the same thing meat or meal the goat is coupled with a meat offering which brother Bram use meal in the sermon I'm saying this so when you read brother Branham you understand what he's talking about amen I'm sorry this thing I have to go slowly because he Dive Into the Book of Leviticus so I have to go very slowly amen so manoah took a kid with a meat offering and offer it upon a what rock remember yes sir plus all of this happened on a rock you're going to see when I go back to Gideon upon the rock to the Lord and the angel of the Lord did wondrously in other word a miracle and manoah and his wife look on and it came to pass when the flame went up toward Heaven from of the what alar so this rock was what I'm I'm reading the Bible this rock was what an alar an altar and the angel of the Lord put fire God brought the fire and he consumed everything and then God enter the fire and disappeared are we together and the angel verse 20 and uh for it came to pass when the flame went up uh toward Heaven from off the altar that the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame of the Altar and Mano and his wife look on it and fell on their faces to the ground are we together what I want you to understand there was a rock yes there was a goat offering and a meat offering and an angel of the Lord and the angel they put the sacrifice on the rock and the angel put fire and disappear are we clear let's go to judges 6 we moving very good if you notice there is no liquid in this sacrifice my friend please follow me there is no liquid no liquid what pror is trying to say is there is no drink [Music] offering because God you could worship him with a liquid it was called a drink offering the offering could be a bread and a meat I'm in The Book of Leviticus my friend so let's go slowly amen or you can bring a liquid and it's called a drink offering sir are we together let's go to Judges chapter 6 my friend so we can go verse one and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord amen amen and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian how many years seven years we clear now and the Hand of Midian Prevail against Israel I'm F I'm going fast like this to save them and because of the midianite the children of Israel made them the dens which were in the mountains and cave and stronghold verse three and so it was when Israel has s that the midianite came up and the amalik and the children of the even they came up against them and they encamp against them and destroyed the increase of the earth until you come together and left no sustainance for Israel neither what sheep nor what nor what so whatever they destroy affected the daily living affected the food affected their transportation the ask was for transportation and the same animal that were destroyed was also used for sacrifice unto the Lord so the worship also was affected right are we together but the point I want to see here I want to show you here is the Bible say they left no sustainance for Israel neither what sheep nor what so no Ox was supposed to remain in Israel I'm reading the Bible are we together so during s years no Ox was supposed to remain but we found out that there was an ox that was there for seven years and that Ox was never touched are we together are we together every other Ox was destroyed but not that one it an ox that survive the seven year period untouch are we together are we together jum to verse 19 my friend jum to verse 19 my friend you there amen let's go to verse uh 18 depart not from here I pray you Gideon talking to the angel until I come to you and bring you forth my present and offering and set it before you and he said I will tell until you come we clear and Gideon went in and made ready a what according to judges 6 Gideon took a kid which we know is a goat remember this was a kid and a meat offering no liquid Gideon take a kid with something the Bible say he took a kid and what and 11 cakes 11 cakes of a Nea of flour these cakes are unle he took an UNL cake amen amen if you notice here it's a meat offering but according to Gideon it's an 11 cake amen what does 11 cake mean in the scripture follow me my friend in Leviticus 2 verse one the Bible say and when any will offer a what a meat offering a meat offering remember the meat offering there unto the Lord his offering shall be of what fine flow and he shall pour oil on it and put Frank his s there on Amen are we together amen verse four and if thou bring an oblation which is an offering of a meat offering bake in the oven it shall be what un Cas are we together yes so when you have meat offering you can bring the meat offering in two forms you can bring flow unto the priest or you can cake you can bake a cake at home and bring it as a meat offering are we together according to Judges 13 the Bible say meet offering we don't know if it was a flower or if it was an unle cake but over here we found a 11 cake which was speaking also about a meat offering are we together so here we got meat offing amen now we got a kid or a goat and a meat offing we got a kid then a goat and a meat offering in the form of un leav cake are we together of there no liquid but watch here we clear verse uh uh 19 and 11 cake of EA the flesh he put it in the water basket and he put the broth the sauce the liquid they br in a pot and brought it out to him under the Oak and did what present over here we have a liquid amen as a bro which is a drink offering everybody clear follow me my friend jump to verse 20 and the angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord say to him take the Flesh of the unle ceg and do it and lay them Upon This Rock lay it where Upon This Rock according to judges 13 the goat and the meat offering were place where the on theck according to judges 6 they are also placed where are we clear and who did that the angel of the Lord again the angel of the Lord placed that on the Rock are we together so they took the meat offering they put they put the the sacrifice there the kid and watch what the angel say and lay them Upon This Rock and do what pour out the broth pour out the broth and he did so watch this offering my friend follow me there is a rock you are you are we together and upon the rock they put a sacrifice are we together and then upon that sacrifice they put also the meat offering amen but they take the liquid I know why I'm using the word liquid they take the liquid and then soak the sacrifice and the altar with the [Music] liquid what are you trying to say brother Steven brother Bram says in the message if God be with us where is all the miracle he said Gideon come with the broth and with the bread and with the meat and the angel say now you shall understand by this this will prove it he did what he poured the broth out he poured the broth out of out upon the what the ground do you see where brother I'm say so when they p on the altar the broth came all the way to the ground are we together for a what a drink offer and he took the bread and the meat and laid it on the rock where he was what thrashing and he took the stick from his hand the like an old man you're going to see that there a staff and touch it and when he touch it the smoke went out let's read that one first jum to verse 21 then the angel of the Lord put forth the end of the staff do you see where brother Bram is getting that that was in his hand and touched the Flesh and the 11 cake and There Rose up what fire out of the what the Rock the same experience in Judges 13 is the same experience in judg 6 are we together amen and they rose up fire out of the Rock and consumed the Flesh and the unle cake then the angel of the Lord did what departed out of his the same scenario again the angel disappeared are we together but if you notice here we have a sacrifice a meat offering and a liquid and the fire leak the liquid glory to God brother Bram say the smoke went out and the sacrifice was consumed what was it he took him back to the scripture to prove what he was the same God that was with who on what so on we must see a [Applause] sacrifice and an altar right and stone and a liquid must be p on the sacrifice and fire must come and leak everything are we together so brother Bram connect us to M carel and mon carel is aarah where are you heading Pastor are we together jum to verse uh uh jop to verse 24 for the sake of time if you thereare you can say amen amen and Gideon did what built an altar there The Rock was there there was a rock there that g you an offer and a rock was an altar amen but Gideon built an altar amen there and to the Lord and call it Jehovah Shalom to this day and it's yet in operah in of the abizer verse 25 he came to pass the same night put your seat Bel my friend that the Lord said to him take your father young Bullock we clear now even the water so there were two Bullocks and at least in this place are we together there was a first bulock Lord help me and there was also a second one are we together and God didn't choose the first one we going to head somewhere my friend there is a first bulock and there is a second bulock God did not choose the first one one God chose the second one and the second appeared to have seven years which are the years of famine all connected to this one and the Bullock Escape any destruction during the seven years are we together verse 25 take your father's young bulock and if you notice he belongs to his father even the second bulock of 7 years old and throw down the altar of bear that your father has so idolatry was in the house of Gideon amen are we together this scripture here open to us an altar and this altar belongs to B are we together and he was the altar of the father of Gideon right are we together and throw down the altar of bell that your father has and cut down the Grove that is by it so the altar have a Grove The Grove was a sacred tree that was represented the wife of bell I'm going slowly I told you I have to uproot this thing from the bottom are we together there is an altar and there is a Grove The Grove is a sacred tree yes amen that represented Asher called also Asti which was the wife of B that's why God say Throw Down The Altar and cut down the Grove in other word destroy B and his [Music] wife I hope we are claming I we together father help your children are we together are we together have I lost anyone so destroy be and Destroy his wife so this sacrif pass when it's call on are we together he has the power to destroy B and the wife of B are we together let's go my friend verse 26 and do what altar unto the Lord build what an altar I thought Gideon already built an altar God now order Gideon that was his own alar God did did something to him he say hey I'm going to build an alter and call it Jehovah uh I mean Shalom God say build another alar right amen what is that Altar for Lord help me he says buil an altar to the Lord your God where upon the top of this rock so there was a rock follow me my friend and Gideon had to build the altar on top of that rock in another translation there was a mountain yes sir and Gideon had to build an altar on top of that mountain are we together now if a mountain is like this or a rock is like this can you build the not here no are we together it cannot happen but if the altar is like this can you build a right there so Gideon head to build a not on top of a rock that have the [Music] [Applause] Capone I'm giving you time so this can so my friend I won't tell you which flight I'm using but I'm giving you time let me start it again if a rock the Bible say you built an altar but that altar cannot be on the bottom of the rock it must be where On Top of the Rock and the way you build a not you need to get stone to build them yes sir are we together but if the alter look like this you cannot put an alter he must have a flat surface on the top like Abraham because Abraham have to go higher on more Moriah on the top are we together so it's a it's a rock that doesn't have the top it looks like the top of this rock never existed are we together and on this top here is where Gideon must build an altar praise [Music] God are we together thank you Jesus verse uh 26 and build a not to the Lord your God to the top of this rock in the what in another translation it means you take the stone that you building and put the stone in order that's what it means are we together because you got a build not with stone but you must put the stone in order remember what I'm saying because when I will begin to to send missiles now I'm I begin to sore are we together he says and offer a brand oh sorry and take the second bulock and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the Grove which that shall do what so this altar got Stone follow me my friend and he got wood amen and on top of the wood we got a bulock an that got stone wood and a bullock that's the altar that destroys B and his wife are we together are we together amen verse 27 the Bible verse 27 then Gideon took 10 men of his servant and did as the Lord had said to him and so he was because he fear his father what adol and the man of what adolat so the whole city and his entire family was under the doar Tre of be are we together that he could not do it by day that he did it by what now brother Steven what do we have to do with [Music] be William Marion Bram are we together and Al brother Bram say when they went up to the side of the tree up to the guard right there can built an altar just the same as Abel built an altar in other word can build a [Music] church you need the proper interpretation of the Bible for this age William Marion Bram are we together he said an able buil what a church so a church must be built on top of the [Applause] Rock in the place of the Capstone there must be a church built there oh God and that church will have a bullock of seven years and that Bullock have the power to destroy bear and destroy the wife [Applause] of if I lost you raise your hand glory to God my friend this is steak my friend okay not milk my friend Amen brother Bram say if going to church is all God requires God will be unjust to condemn Cain Cain built what which the church is to represent what can built a not just the same as AB did what can built an altar can did what as much as sincere as able was but Able by spiritual BR the Able by spiritual Revelation on which the church is what built remember this church must be built upon the rock on a spiritual Revelation on the top of the rock not the bottom but the top on the seven Church ages with the seven years Bullock are we together my friend amen are we together amen he says on the by spiritual what Revelation on which the church is what built on spiritual what revelation of the will and the what word of God of a sacrifice that God was pleased with it and now [Music] I believe that is the day that we are living in now also we are building our churches upon the revelation of the word of God which is the message of the [Applause] hour remember the remember the vision of Jin Jackson the top was ripped off that's why you put the church where the capson is because over there Bard don't get there a Hulk doesn't get there when a Hulk get there they begin to get blind they cannot see what we see it is too high too deep they cannot reach there the Revelation blurs [Applause] them are we together are we together they can clam with you on what is the Holy Ghost what is the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and they can clam with you but when you get to the deeper higher then they say do we need this to go to the Rapture I cannot see what why why those Ember those justment s the stone all these things here it's the heights of [Applause] God are we together are we together are we together so why B why bail brother Bram says this my friend everything that is on Earth today in the way of what spiritual things such as the spirit of God and the Spirit of the devil and all the coats and everything that we have today in the world they begin where in Genesis Genesis means what the beginning and all those things yet under what another name and under what another form but what the Same Spirit The Same Spirit that began where in Genesis in other words the name used there won't be the name used today but the spirit will be the same if you trust by the name you will worship Satan you need to trust by the spirit and the manifestation to recognize who's working there that's right brother Bram say the anointing of Elijah was the spirit of Christ if you need the C you see me after church it's under the seven seal are we together but when that anointing got into the man Elijah he picked up the name Elijah are we together when that anointing left Elijah and move on he pick up the name Elisha but he was the Same Spirit are we together when he left Elisha and he went to another person he picked up the name John the Baptist but he was the Same Spirit but a different name and today that anointing picked up William Mar it is still the spirit of Elijah but under a different name so it's still the same God but they form they form and the name change Elijah didn't wear a suit he had a mental the form changes the name changes from Elijah to Elisha to John the Baptist to William Maran Bram when I say that I'm even excited because it's my time hallah [Applause] [Music] if he doesn't except you that's your problem if you think we are worshiping brother Bram we not worshiping him we worshiping Jesus Christ and brother Bram is his Prophet vated [Music] [Applause] Prophet are we together are we together so Spirit changes name changes form but it's still the same spirit so when we say B that's in the Bible we need to find B [Applause] today when we say Jezebel we need to find Jezebel today are we together are we together are we together H what is wrong with bear brother in the message what Christianity versus idolatry the title of the message tells you what is going on the message is what Christianity versus ID versus what idolatry brother Bram says this he says b we already read Bell okay B was the most noed God of all the ages remember the instruction take the seven Bullock seven years old bulock and Destroy Bell so God didn't like Bell in other word two altar were in Israel there was an altar of bear and an altar of [Applause] God are we together B was the most noted god of what all the age of the what of the idols was b b a l a l he was the what son God put your seat Bel put your seat [Applause] belt I'm going to the [Applause] root and I'm going to pull this from the root [Applause] are we together are we together and when I finish I'm going to use chemotherapy to make sure wherever that cancer [Applause] is God built me different the way I was built is different some people call that that I'm proud I'm not proud there is a fight in me about this message that I just can't help so what I'm going to deliver it will not please many message believer [Applause] preacher some preacher won't like it but I don't have a choice [Applause] are we together because the one that confuses the people are the [Applause] preachers are we

Bullock watch verse 20 uh 2 uh3 let them therefore give us [Music] what I'm going slowly let me start again because I'm going to the airport in Gideon how many Bullock did God used the first one no God used the second one to destroy be are we together watch here Elijah is asking for how many Bullock so which Bullock will Elijah use let's confirm it verse 23 let them therefore give us what and let them choose one Bullock for thems so they choose first that's right did you see that Elijah didn't say I'm going to choose you bring two block you choose the first one the first is for B but the second one is for the Lord Elijah say you start because Elijah knew the second bulock is where God hide looks like you tired the Bible says he says verse 23 and let them therefore give us what two Bullock my friend you there two Bullocks and let them choose one Bullock for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood and put fire no fire under it because Elijah knew who bring the fire Gideon knew who bring the fire we already see by Judges 13 and judges 6 who bring the fire are we together are we together and remember I'm trying to skip Elijah said I did all of this according to that command brother Bram say God show him a vision already and he already told Elijah don't take the first when they bring two Bullock let them have one because remember Gideon and brother Bram say Gideon Mark more caramel do you see when brother brandham say things you need to watch carefully you thought he just say that look what we discovering today because he touches the top and we dig are we together verse 23 let them therefore give us two bulock and let them choose one block for thems and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood you there and put no fire under and I will dress the other the second one do you see why the second have to be one and lay it on the wood and put no fire under and call you on the name of your gods and I will call on the name of the Lord and the god that answer by what let him be good God and all the people answer and say it is what well spoken and elah say to the prophet of bear choose you one Bullock for yourself and dress it first did you see why is Elijah pushing them to go first because the first Bullock is not to the Lord the first belong to B it is the seven bulock it is the second bulock of seven years that belong to the Lord so Elijah say go ahead first Abraham and lot go [Applause] first Lord help me Lord help me are we there dress it first for you are many and call on the name of your God but put no fire under and they took the bulock which was given to them and dress it and call on the name of bear from morning until until noon saying oh B he has but there was no voice nor any answer and they leap upon the altar which was made and came and it came to pass at noon what a prayer what a Zeal huh maybe some were speaking in tongue already that elah mock them it's not me I'm reading the Bible oh no Elijah pray for them so I won't say what you want me to say I say what the Bible say Elijah mark them amen amen and say cry loud C for he is a God either he's talking or he's pursuing or he's in a journey or perhaps he's sleep and must be what let me leave those things because those things are one thing after the other because God our God one time was sleeping and they have to wake him up and brother Brandon preach a message go awake Jesus but let's leave it alone and they cried loud and did what cut themselves after their manner with knives and lens till the blood goash out upon them and it come to pass when midday was passed that they prophesy you see prophecy prophesying until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice not the morning sacrifice in the evening time in the evening time there shall be light are we together and there was neither voice nor any answer nor any that regarded and Elijah said to all the people come near unto me watch and all the people came near everybody obey in other word Elijah just stood and say all of you here everybody are we together we clear watch verse 30 I'm about to finish and all the people came near him and he rep the altar of the Lord that was what broken down in other word Elijah rebuilt yes he did yes he did the altar on top of mon Elijah rebuilt the altar on top of mon on top of the mountain you put an alter there there was an altar there on top of the mountain and Gideon had an altar on top of the mountain and you put Stone then wood then a bulock Elijah already have a Bullock and it was the second bulock ah we clear now and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down verse 31 and Elijah took 12 stone according to the number you must follow the order remember Gideon of the tribe of the sons of Jacob to whom the word of the Lord came saying Israel shall be called your name and with the stone he built like Gideon an altar in the name of the Lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed and he put if you notice the measure is the measure of a seed and the seed was the meat offering the meat offering came as a seed a flour or it was cake I mean bake are we together so they measuring the trench based on the meat offering are we together and he says and he put the wood in order remember Gideon alar have wood he have stone and wood and then the bulock same thing to destroy B and he put the wood in order are we there verse 20 33 and cut the Bullock in pieces and laid it on the wood and say fill liquid liquid liquid fill for be with what water what makes this water an offering because it was 3 and a half year there was no rain so water became precious so taking water and pour precious water on the ground becomes a drink offering remember David one time was thirsty and he sent his men to Bethlehem and when they brought him water David P water on the ground as a drink [Music] offering oh God back up I'm hitting the tach my friend amen amen fill for water and put on the burn offering and on the wood and he said verse 34 what time they poured the water the first time and they did it which time and they did it the second time and he said do it which time the third time Elijah have three times that they are pouring water come on they P the first time Elijah say uhuh go ahead again the second time and they pour again water and when they pour the water the second time he said no you need again three times because that word they need to come three times that anointing have to come three times are we together it comes on the first pool it's not enough it comes on the second pool it is not enough for the fire you have to go to the third pool to the third pool the third one that's why it's ready for the fire to come down father help me are we together are we together watch what happened on the third time and the water run about the Altar and F the trench that's the last pool also with water and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice Elijah the prophet came near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Israel let it be done known this day that you are God in Israel and I am your servant and that I have done all this how second Bullock hear me almost done oh Lord hear me that this people may know that you are the Lord God that you have turn what [Applause] can you read with me you have turned
