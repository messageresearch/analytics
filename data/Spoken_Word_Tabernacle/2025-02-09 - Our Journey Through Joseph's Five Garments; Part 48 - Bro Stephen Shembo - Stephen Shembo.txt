probably from South Africa Africa somewhere so he wanted to have something like this so probably somebody took a screenshot and pul me close and say wait a minute that's a cloud amen it's a Vindication that this message is the truth amen amen any family members here first time second time or third time or online God bless you we don't have visitors we got family members and I believe we are up to date with the sermon we're reading our Bible twice a day our Cod book our church ages 70 weeks of Daniel the seals adoption or someone is listening to the message of the hour amen Lord willing on uh February the 22nd this month that's the young sisters meeting and then the merried couple meeting part five will be on March the 22nd so you got 2222 there and then on March the 29th that's where the young men requested for young men meeting so I believe all is clear right Christian okay so Christian say okay so you are already doomed amen so it's March the 29th for the young men meeting so we don't take too long again like we did last year and then on April the 26 that is our next question and answer the second quarterly and the appreciation dinner is April the 12th so you know who you are you who have been doing work in the Church musician technician whoever everybody you know who you are so just know that April the 12 that is the appreciation dinner we will put the information in the church group chat and you get everything together the bonfire I'm still not sure on that we will work on that by God's grace uh sister Destiny was the dismiss she's at home baby's doing good am I saw some nice picture for the pastor baby looks really really really good amen but the doctor recommended for them to stay because of the flu going on that they need to stay a little bit away from uh uh the people so the baby's at home doing wonderful I saw Ariana carrying the baby he was really so these are the secret of the pastor and it looks very very good and the fight

God's grace amen Amen on Wednesday I mention about brother Sean Martin's meeting and if you can you can go and I say that you can go on Friday you can go on uh Saturday but on Sunday you need to be back to your church so I didn't get more amen so automatically my uh enter missiles load and they just move into the air automatic that's the way they were wire amen because I believe this message came to educate us the message came to correct our ways amen meaning we were doing certain things ignorantly but when the message come and the truth come and the truth is presented then from that time we are Duty bound to conform to the truth and begin to walk according to the truth once the truth is disclosed if you don't walk according to the truth now you walking in iniquity and you become a worker of iniquity I don't know if we clear together amen so I realize there are seven several things that has not been t in this message or he was taught but he was not properly taught amen and we got people 30 years 40 years 20 years in the message and some don't even know to differentiate from their left and the right amen so the time have come that my people will not be again in confusion we have to know what is the truth we need to know how we need to uh worship and adore Our God if not we won't be different than the denomination amen so what about the Sunday issue brother Steven me I don't have anything I only have the Bible and the message of the hour are we together amen are we together amen if not I will call my brother Paul Dart because he's always together amen amen all right

so we all come to the revelation of who we are amen verse six he says I have said ye are gods and all of you are children of who the most high you see it's easy to read but to understand what it means

he's the richest man he have a lot of money he's the president of the United States what about if your father is God when they say your father is God then you begin to hesitate amen so you have more faith on the natural man than the spiritual father so God is telling you you are my child what does it mean to be a child of God and not only a child of God by the child of the most high in other words the top of everything you came out from his l in other word you were to be a child of God you must be in God so if God is saying you are my child it means you came out of God and Jesus say I come out from God and I'm going back to God in other word if you came out from God it means one of this day you're going to go back where you came from that's why your life is different that's why

doing what talking in him sometime he was who Christ himself sometime he was the father that dwelleth where in him they could not understand some things he would say he talks what in riddles to them Jesus finally said when he was talking to them one day he said I come from what God I come into this word and go back again to what how can somebody who was born in a hospital somebody who was born in a man the people were there and that person is telling you I'm coming from God h brother Bram say Christ seems to be a what a dual personality Christ seems to be a what dual personality there is a Divine personality and there is a human personality amen remember last Sunday that's why he could cry and then he turned around he said take of the stone the same person you need to know who is talking you need to know who is crying there is a time you cry and there is a time you don't cry and even if you want to cry you feel like you can't cry because somebody else is taking [Applause] over

amen are we together are we together amen are we together amen let's give the Lord a big clap let's now begin our sermon [Applause] thank you Jesus now you can take your seat belt with reach the altitude if you look right here you will see Pluto Uranus and everything else we way up there amen amen amen amen amen according if you fool you tell me amen amen my daughter asked me said Daddy how many sermon do you have in this computer I said I don't know the [Laughter] numbers I say I don't know the number there is so much amen am amen amen according to Leviticus 4 you remember that verse 1 through6 do you remember that if you don't we read it amen amen amen am oh God glory to God hallelujah amen according to Leviticus 4 verse 1-6 we found out that the blood brother Robert can I get one please the blood was applied in three places you remember that few people if not we read amen you remember that ah number one it was appli upon the ve number two he was applied upon the horns sir thank you my brother appreciate it thank you it was applied upon the Horn of the altar which is the golden altar or the altar of ense and number three he was put at the bottom of the Brazen altar amen the blood was the blood of a young bulock you remember that which is a calf the FED calf amen and it was for a sin offering you remember that and the off the sin was the sin of ignorance we clear on that one now follow me carefully because now we're going to get deeper you there according to John I'm going to go through this quickly according to John 9 verse3 1 amen and according to Psalm 66:8 and according to proverb 15: 29 we find out that sin blocks prayer we clear on that one we clear we clear because in John the bible say that God does he Hearth not sinners in PS if I iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me the Lord is far from the wicked we clear on that one I'm trying to move on according to Isaiah 1 are we together Isaiah 1 verse 15 and Isaiah 59 verse1 the same thing goes together God doesn't hear the prayer of a sinner in other words sin blocks prayer the Bible says I will hide eyes from you yeah when you make many prayer I will not what why because your hands are full of but according to 59 behold the Lord's hand is not shortened that it cannot save neither is his ear uh his ear heavy that it cannot hear but your iniquity have separated between you and your God in other words God is always available always God is available the help of God is always is available to you but the reason why the help is not dispatched is because there is something that is blocking the help are we clear together we clear then when we enter into the altar of Ence we find that this altar have many things he have the shim wood you know what it means we clear he it's for square the four corners of the earth you understand that four horns which means power he was overlay with pure gold which was human overlay with d and a crown and the last things that was remaining was the incense everybody okay the last thing is the incense this is where we stopped last Sunday now follow me carefully you can back up now we clear according to Exodus 30 we found out that the altar was put before theil follow me my friend according to Exodus 30 the altar was before the amen and According to Hebrew n you remember that Paul put the when we say before the the altar was in the Holy place you understand this now and then according to Paul Paul put the altar in the holiest you understand this now because remember Paul was after the death of Jesus Christ the veil of the temple was split and the ense was burn in the morning we clear and at evening are we together yes and then the the the the altar itself was atoned at the horn and he was Aton yearly once every year we clear on that one we clear now when we look at Luke chapter one follow me my friend the Bible says that according to the custom of the priest office this is Zechariah his lot was to burn what when he went up into the Temple of the Lord and the whole multitude of the people were praying where now Zechariah was is follow me my friend and the people were outside one was within one was without amen inside the temple there were burning incense follow me my friend that was inside then outside amen outside there were prayer amen so prayer and incense were separate yes amen follow me my friend prayer outside incense inside they were parallel follow me my friend in other word there was a line for incense in the Holy place and there was another line for prayer for the people outside amen so they were like 85 north and 85 South parallel these are two lines parallel in other word they don't meet everybody together but they were going at the same time are we together one inside one outside but both of them going on the same time the timing is the same yes amen I told you to put a seat belt and David now because David is prophecy he was a prophet David say let my prayer which go outside the temple follow me my friend be set forth before the as what David begin to desire that the prayer become the in if I lost you you raise your hand the prayer was one thing the incense was something else but whenever the burn in sense the prayer is going David now come with a desire with a wish he said why don't prayer just be sense in other word God I want my prayer to be like in I see that incense is one thing prayer is one thing but I want my prayer and the Ence to become one are we together are you following me are we together now according now to Revelation 5 way down after David the Bible say when he had taken the book The Book of redemption the four beast and four and 20 Elders 24 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them what and golden V full of what the word orders means incense which are what now in the New Testament follow me my friend we found out that when John goes in the Book of Revelation John begin to see incense Hallelujah now are prayer are we together are we to follow me my friend because we are in John 17 the prayer of Jesus Christ is always answering you know that right amen but we want to know about your prayer are we together amen are we together amen I share my glory with no one I share my glory only with myself but God is sharing his glory with you and so me and God we are one but God his prayer are always answered if I am one with God we need to find out what happened to our prayer [Music] amen I don't know if I miss you can I repeat it again yes sir can I repeat it again yes sir me and my father we are Jesus say I want you also to be one with the father but we found out that relationship of Jesus and the father every prayer of Jesus Christ always answer and Jesus say I want you to be the same way as me and matter of fact my glory that I don't share with anyone I give it to you I'm sharing that with you so if the glory is in the bread Hallelujah if the father is in the bre and the father in The Son every prayer was answer and God is the same yesterday today and forever so God in the BR how should the prayer be always answer are we together amen I know it's hard for you I know why you don't want to talk some of you don't want to talk I know exactly why because you remember of your prayer failing come on amen amen amen and I told you Jesus also pray for somebody and the person didn't see clearly he didn't change who he was he didn't destroy his confidence amen Jesus went back again and used a second gear and the man so clearly amen so you have more gears than you [Applause] think are we together are we together let me ask you a question if a door is closed and in your mind you say you know what no if you find something on the floor yeah and you say in your mind you say oh this look like a box the

David say Hey I see prayer this way I see incense this way but I know this incense is going to you may my prayer become the in and no in will go straight but prayer I don't know so let that prayer become incense are we together and when the lamb is picking up the book we find the Prayer of the s have become incense follow me my friend can I erase this oh glory to God glory to God school zone this thing need to be taught amen now David uh John according to Revelation 5 we found out that they pray the incense amen is now the prayer prayers of who Saints not anybody's prayer not anybody's prayer because God doesn't he sness it's prayer of the sent are we together follow me my friend when we say here that Paul took the altar that was in the Holy place and put it in the holiest what does it mean the holiest are we together the holiest had the Ark of the Covenant are we there and above the Ark of the Covenant was The Mercy Seat we went through this and The Mercy Seat was the throne yes of God in other word when God entered the Tabernacle the pillar of fire is moving straight until he goes to the mercy seat and he sit right there and in one hand a cariban sir and in other hand a cariban because in heaven when the throne is there they are Carib him because Moses have to reflect heaven on Earth are we together amen so the mercy SE towards the throne so Paul taking this altar from before the ve do you follow me and moving that here now the altar is now before the throne follow me my friend if I lost you you raise your hand have I lost someone have I lost somebody the alt move from here and goes and stand before the ark and above the ark was The Mercy Seat which is the throne in other word when you enter the holiest if you look on The Mercy Seat you will see the pillar of fire he looking at Paul took that Al and bring it all the way so now the incense are right there before God I don't know if you get me the incs are not not anymore separated with a now the is are part of the presence of God Amen are we together amen are we together am remember this elder were right there by the throne and and they have incense Before the Throne am do you follow me do you follow me Amen brother brother the Bible says this in Revelation 8 after the seventh seal is open the Bible say another angel came and stood well at the altar having what gold and there was given him what much incense that he should offer it with what the prayers of the Saints there prayer of the saint according to Revelation 5 became incense but in Revelation 8 do you follow me they they give another incense that goes with the prayer of the sent so they are incense and incense I don't know if you get me I don't know if you get me if you take water and water you put them together then they can mix together do you follow me do you follow me there were prayer of the scent which were incense and the angel brought another incense are we together and that incense have to be mixed with the prayer of the S so now when they're burning are we together what comes out from there is incense mixed with prayer now the prayer of David [Applause] isere what are you trying to say it's a different gear my friend in the Old Testament the true atonement was not there that's right he was a substitute God was using lamps right he was using goats and everything are we together so the prayer and the incent were separate but when Jesus Christ came when John was baptized in Jesus Christ he says behold what L the Lamb of God in the word all lamb were represented in Jesus Christ now that Jesus is the perfect sacrifice now the incense is no longer separate because the veil of the temple has been ripped now the incense and the prayer are matching together do you follow me because the sacrifice have come the Old Testament could not do that only the blood of Jesus Christ which is our Bullock if I let you raise your hand my friend follow me my friend the Bible says they was giving him what that he should offer it with what the prayers of all the saints upon what the golden altar with which is where Before the Throne which is where Before the Throne the altar is now where Before the Throne Moses put the altar after the throne but when we go originally in heaven the altar was before the throne but because of the Old Testament the lamb was not there Moses had to separate are we together but when the lamb was dying on Calvary the veil was divided now PA we store everything back like in heaven because in heaven the Earth always been Before the Throne it is no longer the law the Tabernacle of Moses now we turn the Grace Grace The Altar and the throne are in the same [Applause] place are we together amen let me start it again in the Old Testament he was under the law the sacrifice was not perfect are we together boses was T what you see in heaven do it on Earth do you follow me amen but In Heaven There is no Veil The Tabernacle in heaven don't have Veil are we together but when Moses begin to put the Tabernacle Moses begin to put Veil and he took the Altar and put it outside but in heaven that altar is before for the throne so when Christ died Christ came and ripped the veil and opened The Mercy Seat in other words the holy place and the holiest became one are we together are we together now the altar is Before the Throne in other words Paul is restoring back Heaven because Paul was Moses in the more time that's why Paul was the one interpreting the law he was the Moses of the New Testament that's why he preached the book of Hebrew and going through the law the law of Moses it's Paul that understood that and Paul knew that now that the lamb has come we cannot put the veil anymore the altar must be Before the Throne your prayer cannot be outside it must be in the presence of God amen are we together amen are we together amen my friend these are we are in University can I continue amen can I continue amen listen to this my friend he says the altar the golden alt which is before what the throne and the smoke of what the incense which came with what now the incense and the prayer of the saint both of them are what one together they are no longer like in the time of Zechariah where one was inside one was outside now both of them are going how they going together before the Lord the prayer the smoke of the incense which came with the prayer of the saint ascended up out of God ascended up before God out of what the Angel's hand they ascending before who God because God is sitting on the throne now the prayer is before God do you follow me do you follow me amen now what is incense I'm good in time my friend if you fool you tell me what is incense according to nine we see that the altar speaks what is in sense brother pram says this he says while the people were making prayer outside Zechariah burned what incense which we had time to back that up good now and lay a what Foundation of what what incense means and all speaking of who Christ everything the Ence now is what his [Applause] blood the Ence is what his blood so when your prayer are going your prayer must be mixed with what the blood to God are we together remember the blood number one have to be sprayed on the F number two it need to be spray where on the Horn of what the altar of prayer amen are we together amen are we together amen follow me my friend because some are trying to figure it out where is he going let me help you up that alter of incense we found out that the true meaning of it the altar of was a church on Earth amen Crown a kingdom right Sinners human yes amen saved by grace are we together overlaid yes by De amen becoming the house of what Deliverance because number four is Deliverance they became the house of what Deliverance but remember the altar is also the Throne of prayer amen amen because s was bringing up with prayer are we together so not only is he the House of Deliverance he need to become the house of what prayer that's why Jesus said my house shall be called what House of Prayer are we together but that house was a temple and you are the temple so you must be a House of what prayers do you understand now amen and every prayer of Jesus Christ always elere what about your prayer what about the prayer of the House of Prayer amen I hope you understand I'm trying to help you because you pray you don't understand why prayer are not answer are we together brother PR say the blood the is the blood amen and the incense goes with the prayer of the S let's look at the blood and incense brother Bram say the priest killed the lamb and catches what the blood put it over here and burn it as a what sacrifice where on the bra which means what divine judgment and as the smoke does what went up Israel fell on the knees and gave the what the prayers as he went up on the what the smoke of this what burnt blood throw Blood on the fire and watch what take place amen when you put Blood on the fire it created smoke are we together follow me my friend brother Bram says this he says under the blood and the blood brings what the fire the sacrifice was offered by fire the blood where on the fire making what smoke Sweet Smoke smelling saver that went up to the Savior what himself remember it before there the sweet smelling saver was the prayer of the people on the order of the blood you see the prayer and the blood are we together that went up as the pray where under the shed blood and today the sacrifice has been what it's been burnt by who the Holy Spirit when you take your own Sacrifice by what the blood of Jesus Christ and throw yourself where on the altar covered by what the blood and the Holy Ghost get a hold of that and send what a sweet smelling Savor to God that bring you into what it's sh of Glory that is the only place of what Fellowship amen are we together the blood will sprinkle on the flesh which is the V because we needed to repent now the second application the blood is put upon the altar why because when you sin your prayer are [Music] block sin blocks prayer so when God forgive you of your sin God must open up your prayer Channel am I don't know if you get me sin and prayer are combo you kill one you kill the other if you serve One automatically you must serve the other amen if you atone for the veil you must atone for the altar of prayer amen because God does a he sin if you deal with the sin situation automatically you you must unlock the prayer channel right I don't know if you get me when God forgive you hallu he must automatically answer your prayer I don't know if we together when you apply the blood on the veil you cannot stop on the veil you must continue toward the altar you must unlock the veil unlock the altar and unlock the bottom of the braen altar I'm still on the second one you unlock the believer you forgive them for their sins and their trespasses you don't stop there you must open up the pipe that have been blocked by the [Applause] devil are you talking about a pipe listen to brother brother the Bible say he ascended way on high brother on high and did what give gifts unto men there was an atmosphere hang of what the Earth of what darkness and what Gloom of what death and what weary the prayer could not come up brother Bram say there was an atmosphere when Adam sin an atmosphere came and block prayer do you follow me amen that's why when you deal with the believer you got to also open up the prayer you got to put blood Amen on the altar ofes so that the altar can be accepted if you don't put Blood on the altar the in don't come to God the blood must be applied on the alt amen the blood must be applied on your prayer your prayer must go with the [Music] blood Shake somebody beside [Applause] [Music] you let me use a different gear are we together amen are we together amen the priest put blood on you and put Blood on the altar because everywhere the blood goes that's where the problem is on you because you sin that's but sin block your prayer that's right so when God forgive you we need to go on the prayer Channel and to atone the prayer channel so that the prayer can go before God are we together that's why the blood is applied on the altar of prayer now God heal the prayer of the sent the sent that have been Sanctified by the blood the prayer must go straight why because there was an atmosphere gloomy atmosphere brother Bram say he was blocking prayer that's are we together amen are we together Amen brother Bram said the prayer could not come up because the atonement what wasn't made my question is so how was the Old Testament prayer being answered God was answering their Prayer by type that's right because they didn't have any better than that so God have to answer that prayer yes sir amen amen if the prayer of the Old Testament was answered by the blood of Boo and goat and sheep hmer day blood of Jesus Christ will do to your [Applause] [Music] [Applause] prayer my friend if it takes seven sermon I will go slowly amen until you get this because I don't want to preach this and you go tomorrow you still struggling Amen brother Bram say but he broke through follow and he did what open up the way so when God when Jesus was going up this is what brother Bram is saying this is what brother Bram is saying amen amen do you know that when Jesus resurrected he went to heaven and he came back again because he thought Mary he said do not touch me I have to go before the father then at the evening when he came he said say now you can touch me brother Bram said because he went there and as he was going brother Bram said because the sacrifice must be accepted that's right because Paul say he doesn't enter the Tabernacle made by men According to Hebrew he must enter in the Tabernacle of Heaven Amen to go put the blood not in this altar go in heaven where the true alter is and put the amen amen do you know the Bible says that if you don't know raise your hand open the the book of Hebrew if I have to stop here I don't have any problem let's go to Hebrew now let's go to Hebrew now yes sir glory Lord amen than we cannot serve God in ignorance Hebrew 9 if you thereare you can say amen amen let's go to verse 11 then I'm going to stop because I have one minute left let's go Hebrew n than we need to understand these things right you think the priest was just playing in the Tabernacle there were Mysteries God God doesn't hear sinners we all say Amen what about if I'm no longer a sinner Lord guess what guess what God doesn't heal sin what about if I'm no longer a sinner in other word sin blocks prayer if you resolve sin prayer also is resolved that's why the blood is put on the there and on the altar of the ense that's where prayer is coming up they have to unlock I'm not getting in the bottom of the altar yet we will get to that and you will see why that altar have to be also applied and not on the altar under there is a reason why he goes under there amen let's go to Hebrew 9 verse 11 if you there you can say amen amen but verse 11 Christ go ahead C being calm being Cal a what high high priest of what good good things full of energy my friend full uh priest of good things to come by a what greater and what more perfect perfect what Tabernacle not this Tabernacle of Moses the original Tabernacle that Moses copy after a more perfect Tabernacle not made with water hands that is to say not of what this building nether by the blood of what goats and whats and what but by his own blood he enter in how many times into what the holy Place having what obtained Eternal Redemption ET Eternal Redemption for who drop to verse 19 now get it my friend flat attend and prepare for landing for when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves young bulock amen and of goats with water and Scarlet wood and H up and sprinkle both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the testament which God has what enjoy unto to you moreover he sprinkle with blood both what the Tabernacle and all the vessel of what ministers so the Tabernacle and the vessel were sprinkled with blood that was done on Earth by Moses watch verse 22 and almost all things are by the law Purge with what blood so he was a purging and without what shed shedding of the blood is no what it was therefore necessary that the power of things in what heaven no more on Earth should be how purified purify with what these my question is why do you purify things in heaven where God is question on Earth it's human being but in heaven God dwell there why does Jesus need to purify things in heaven do you see now do you see now my friend he said and was therefore necessary that the pattern of things in the heaven should be purified with this but the Heavenly things themselves with better what sacrifice than the than what than these in other words the things in heaven had to be purified by a better excellent sacrifice and there is no excellent Sacrifice by the blood of Jesus Christ and why was Heaven why must we purify Heaven because look started sin over [Applause] there do you understand amen sin brother Bram say sin originated so God must go everywhere that Lucifer was and clean up everything are we together amen are we together so the true alar of AES was also purified there why because Jesus have to open the way am and the gloomy atmosphere that was on the top Jesus have to remove it because your prayer was blocked blocked blocked so Christ must open the way so that when you pray your prayer are answer listen my friend but he broke through what that Veil he opened up what the way he broke the veil of what sickness he broke the veil of what sin he broke the veil of what weary he broke the veil of what depressed he broke every Veil and made a what highway for who the warfaring man walking up in the king's what highway oh my when he pass what the moon and the stars and what on and on God have to open a highway so the prayer can now go straight in are we together amen that's the reason why the blood have to be put on the altar of ense so that the prayer can go let's finish with this and then we pick up next Sunday brother Bram says this so so will your what prayers go straight to where to its destination let's let's preach together so we can Lear this thing let's preach together so will your what prayers go where Straight to its destination because it's offer in the water blood of Jesus Christ which what cleans you the same blood that cleans you automatically cleans your altar so your prayer must go straight to destination I don't know if we together Amen brother problem say there is not a what sin a spot on what nowhere on you way nowhere because you are now a saint and God Hearth the prayer of the [Applause] Sint he says that right they can be as long as the choro what is the Clorox the blood that Clorox is between me and God and God how is he going to see my sin how is he going to do it you don't understand what I'm saying my friend when you are purified by the blood of the Lamb when you offer up your prayer brother Bram say your prayer goes to the destination why because your prayer is also sent with the blood your prayer goes with a stamp the blood stamp your prayer when the heaven see the stamp of the blood they let your prayer go in amen Lord help me brother Bram says this it was a place where the blood was what offered and without the shedding of the blood there is what no of prayer being answered outside the what I hope we okay now there is no promise of your prayer to be answered outside the blood the Old Testament use animal even job used animal and the prayer will answer we don't use animal we use God on blood Hallelujah let

go see you next Sunday see you next Sunday my friend I just told you for your prayer to go you need what the blood is your incense and your incense must be mixed with your prayer amen amen amen and then when your prayer goes brother Bram say there is no promise of prayer to be answered without the blood in other word if you take the blood you put it in your prayer go to sleep your prayer is coming back amen what is in the blood that if I couple the blood with my prayer in other word when you put prayer you take the blood and you C you ship your prayer Hallelujah with the blood and you ship it there don't worry when the angel sees they don't see your prayer they seeing the blood when they see the blood blood and blood are talking God knows that this Blood here this is my child they say hey this is a VIP from amen it's overnight [Music] case are we together amen are we together amen let's stop right here my friend the first application we went through it the blood have to be spray sprinkled seven time that's what the Holy Spirit does to every portion of the blood through the seven Church ages every member will be sprinkled with the blood but he doesn't stop there as soon as he finish with you he have to go and unlock your altar of prayer because you no longer a sinner if you no longer a sinner your prayer must go before God because God doesn't heal sinner they block you and they block your prayer now they unlock you they got to unlock your prayer both of them goes together that's why the blood is applied on the altar right amen and with blood no prayer is answered but remember the Old Testament they did that in type until God was coming down I can even shock you even BM could bring God down if BM brings God down with a wrong intention you think over it throughout the week the intention was to curse Isel are we together and God came down why was God coming down watch the sacrifice of of watch the sacrifice of bam he was seven what Bullock go watch the scripture and seven what REM he was Bullock and REM we talking about the blood of a bullock here when God saw bulock and God came he what do you want with a wrong intention do you go to God with a wrong intention if God answer B with a wrong intention I would get you somewhere my friend hallelujah amen amen amen God came down amen when B want to curse God said uh-uh you got it wrong look us over there in the camp what do you see there what do you see there do you see the serpent on the PO do you know what he represent Jesus say as Moses lift up the so that the son of man will be in other word b do you see me there those people you don't curse them you only bless them now you talk when B is talking God is blessing what was going on the blood the blood yes [Applause] sir let's stop here let's stand go chew throughout the week in prayer am two things my friend you need to know who you are remember that slave with a chest remember the seven seal with a chest you progress a little be with the blood we will get into it you will understand the prayer of Christ always answered amen your prayer need to be answered amen amen amen amen am your prayer must be answered yes but there is a sin issue and the sin issue trouble you all the time so let's clean up sin but you still doubting yes because you don't understand the blood and you're going to see what is in the blood yeah because brother Bram say Israel sin that's why B told bam let me show you the their problem sir sir so the problem was there sir but even though he goes through the problem BM come up he say I don't see iniquity amen because their sin was red and the blood is red and when you look at Red through red brother Bram say what do you see we will get to that my friend Sho throughout the week go back to the sermon review again go read your Bible go read the Hebrew Hebrews 6 go to Hebrew uh 89 10 read those three Hebrew you will see what what Christ did amen and you will understand let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this afternoon father we thank thee for your grace for your love for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you for speaking to us again about who we are and and about what the blood is Lord father May the Holy Spirit take these few words that has been spoken and may you drive it down deep in the soul and now fold this Revelation more than what we have done so that Lord father even though we didn't do it more what than what you have done yourself so that father they can see you clearly and understand the power of the blood upon our sin and upon the consequences that sin have brought in our life the main root was to deal with the sin whatever remaining was only branches and fruit Lord and if the root is already cut off automatically it's just a matter of time the Fig Tree will wither away father the blood has been applied upon us and that same blood moved to the altar offenses Lord may you touch our heart so that when we go to prayer we go to prayer approaching the throne of grace boldly knowing that we are approaching under the blood and covered by the blood because without the blood we have no guarantee no promise of our prayer to be answered that's why we are offering even this prayer under the blood of Jesus Christ father we commit your church and the remaining of the week unto the hand in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you church we love you [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes amen [Music] amen what happened to that preacher who used to preach so strong what happened to that singer who used
