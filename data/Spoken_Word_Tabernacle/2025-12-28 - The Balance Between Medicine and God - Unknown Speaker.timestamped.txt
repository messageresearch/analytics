[0:16] Sister Lily, Sister Bridgen, I don't see
[0:19] Brother Michael and then Sister Yok. If
[0:22] I forget you, Sister Charlene and
[0:24] everything, I understand it's the devil.
[0:26] Amen. When I wake up this morning, I
[0:28] tried to move something and he goes
[0:30] boom. I say, "Oh my god." I say, "I'm
[0:34] drinking water." Like Sister Rosemary
[0:36] say
[0:38] I know if I say something wrong. Uh
[0:41] because she want my kidneys to be uh
[0:44] fine. Flash completely. I say, "Where is
[0:47] this thing coming up?" I say, "You know
[0:48] what? I'm going to start praying. I'm
[0:50] going to pray and I'm going to go to
[0:52] church
[0:53] &gt;&gt; and I'm here and I'm fine and completely
[0:56] here.
[0:56] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:01] [applause]
[1:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04] &gt;&gt; So when you sick and you can stay home,
[1:07] I understand that that's no problem. You
[1:09] can stay home. If you're sick, you can
[1:11] stream. Amen. But be careful.
[1:19] &gt;&gt; I wanted to avoid this. This is not a
[1:22] rebuke.
[1:23] Uh let me let me clarify this because I
[1:26] know this is not a rebuke.
[1:29] &gt;&gt; Whoever stay at home that was
[1:30] legitimate.
[1:32] &gt;&gt; Even brother Micah who's at home.
[1:33] Brother Micah this is legitimate.
[1:36] &gt;&gt; Ah so let's remove the devil. Whoever
[1:38] sister bridging it to everybody that was
[1:41] legitimate.
[1:43] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:44] &gt;&gt; Because you got a conscience. You don't
[1:46] want to get give it to somebody else and
[1:48] things like that and we appreciate it.
[1:50] No problem. Amen. But let me balance uh
[1:53] uh things uh a little bit a different
[1:56] way. Amen. So don't go with a gun to a
[1:59] sister or whoever was not there. You are
[2:01] already immune. You are vaccinated. Are
[2:04] we
[2:06] &gt;&gt; you taking my time? We need to go to the
[2:09] word. Amen.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. So all of you are vaccinated and
[2:14] you are immune. If somebody come to you
[2:16] just give me a call.
[2:18] &gt;&gt; We clear so far?
[2:19] &gt;&gt; We clear so far. But I just felt from
[2:22] the Holy Ghost that I need to say this
[2:25] &gt;&gt; that sometime you need to be careful
[2:30] &gt;&gt; when you sick. Where do you go?
[2:34] &gt;&gt; To the hospital.
[2:35] &gt;&gt; Do you worry about the nurse getting
[2:37] your sickness?
[2:41] &gt;&gt; No problem with those that stays. Do you
[2:43] worry about the security guy getting
[2:45] sick?
[2:46] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:47] &gt;&gt; Do you worry about the doctor getting
[2:49] sick?
[2:50] You are you are you you have enough
[2:52] faith
[2:57] &gt;&gt; to believe that when I'm getting to the
[2:59] hospital,
[3:00] &gt;&gt; I will be free, but nobody will get
[3:02] sick.
[3:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:09] &gt;&gt; It is okay to go to the hospital
[3:12] &gt;&gt; when you don't feel all right.
[3:16] &gt;&gt; Some of you are afraid.
[3:19] William Marion Brham.
[3:22] [laughter]
[3:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:25] &gt;&gt; All right. The Bible, brother Brham says
[3:27] in the principles of divine healing, he
[3:30] said the first thing a person does when
[3:33] they get what to say maybe around home
[3:37] you have a few remedies and thing you
[3:39] try.
[3:42] &gt;&gt; Some have ginger.
[3:47] Are we together? Some have Advil code
[3:50] and sness.
[3:52] &gt;&gt; Some have all type of a a a a a
[3:56] small pharmacy
[3:58] &gt;&gt; that you have at home and you go quickly
[4:01] or benadril or whatever. It's all right.
[4:06] &gt;&gt; OH, YOU DON'T WANT TO SAY AMEN.
[4:08] &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAID THE FIRST THING WHEN YOU
[4:11] GET SICK, WHAT DO you do? Go to your
[4:13] home pharmacy.
[4:14] So everybody should have a pharmacy at
[4:17] home.
[4:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:20] &gt;&gt; Where you keep your vicks and uh
[4:24] &gt;&gt; have I say something wrong?
[4:26] &gt;&gt; Uh you're not helping me.
[4:29] &gt;&gt; You need to go open up your cabinet and
[4:31] get a Tylenol
[4:33] &gt;&gt; and get a Advil
[4:35] &gt;&gt; because God heals by medicine.
[4:39] &gt;&gt; Now, can you say amen?
[4:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:41] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[4:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:43] &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you very much.
[4:46] [laughter]
[4:47] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM SAY THE NEXT THING.
[4:51] &gt;&gt; When we say the next thing, it means
[4:52] your ginger didn't work.
[4:58] &gt;&gt; It means your magic solution didn't
[5:00] work.
[5:02] &gt;&gt; Have I say something wrong?
[5:04] &gt;&gt; If not, we continue. We close. We go
[5:06] straight to the brother. Brother said in
[5:08] OTHER WORDS IF YOUR STUFF DOESN'T WORK
[5:11] &gt;&gt; if your taleno your robbitum
[5:15] &gt;&gt; your day quill
[5:18] &gt;&gt; your n
[5:20] YOUR TERRA FLU
[5:22] &gt;&gt; YOUR TUMMY FLU
[5:25] &gt;&gt; ALL YOUR FLU medication [laughter]
[5:28] &gt;&gt; if it doesn't work
[5:30] &gt;&gt; what should we do with your brand
[5:33] brother Brham said the next thing is
[5:36] maybe you do What?
[5:37] &gt;&gt; Call your doctor.
[5:38] &gt;&gt; SO THERE IS NOTHING WRONG ABOUT GOING to
[5:40] the hospital.
[5:42] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[5:44] &gt;&gt; Uh he say YOU CALL YOUR DOCTOR. THAT IS
[5:48] a what
[5:48] &gt;&gt; sensible thing to do.
[5:50] &gt;&gt; So it's normal, it's reasonable
[5:53] &gt;&gt; for you to call the doctor.
[5:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[5:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[5:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[6:00] &gt;&gt; So I'm giving you faith for your
[6:02] medication.
[6:06] Faith for the doctor right there.
[6:08] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to move to a faith to a
[6:10] different realm.
[6:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say, "AND IF THE DOCTOR
[6:14] can do you no good."
[6:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:18] &gt;&gt; Then you got a RIGHT TO GO TO WHO?
[6:21] &gt;&gt; GOD.
[6:22] &gt;&gt; THAT IS WHAT YOU SHOULD DO. CALL ON WHO?
[6:25] &gt;&gt; GOD.
[6:25] &gt;&gt; And God IS THE AUTHOR OF WHAT?
[6:28] &gt;&gt; CIRCUMSTANCE.
[6:29] &gt;&gt; He can do what nothing else can do. WHEN
[6:31] MAN COMES TO THE END OF THEIR LAND, God
[6:35] can too.
[6:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[6:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[6:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[6:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:42] &gt;&gt; If you sick, get your medication at
[6:44] home. If you sick, GO TO THE EMERGENCY
[6:47] ROOM. If you seek, go to God.
[6:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:51] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[6:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[6:53] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM SAYS in the message, it is
[6:55] I be not afraid. AND NOW YOU CRY. THE
[6:59] SENSIBLE THING, the what?
[7:01] &gt;&gt; Reasonable thing.
[7:03] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU GET SICK IS GO TO WHO?
[7:05] &gt;&gt; The doctor.
[7:06] &gt;&gt; That is right. When your doctor fails,
[7:09] then you say, "I got to go somewhere
[7:12] else."
[7:12] &gt;&gt; SO THERE IS NOTHING WRONG GOING TO THE
[7:15] HOSPITAL.
[7:15] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[7:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[7:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[7:18] &gt;&gt; BUT THE RAPTURE IS APPROACHING.
[7:21] [cheering]
[7:23] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[7:26] &gt;&gt; THE RAPTURE IS APPROACHING AND AS THE
[7:29] RAPTURE IS APPROACHING OUR FAITH NEED TO
[7:32] be higher.
[7:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[7:37] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT.
[7:40] &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT. COME ON. COME ON.
[7:43] &gt;&gt; WHEN you go get uh your terra flu, do
[7:46] you spend money?
[7:48] &gt;&gt; When you go to the emergency room, you
[7:50] know why you crying in the emergency
[7:52] room? Yes.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; You're not crying for the medication.
[7:55] &gt;&gt; You crying for for what is going to
[7:57] follow
[7:59] &gt;&gt; two weeks
[8:01] &gt;&gt; after your visit.
[8:03] &gt;&gt; YOU CRYING FOR $2,000 THAT IS COMING in
[8:05] the mail. BUT THERE IS ONE THAT CAN HEAL
[8:08] YOU
[8:12] [cheering and applause]
[8:13] &gt;&gt; WITHOUT A PENNY
[8:15] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE BY HIS TRAP YOU WERE HERE.
[8:21] [applause]
[8:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together? [cheering]
[8:24] &gt;&gt; I am not rebuking anyone.
[8:26] &gt;&gt; I am I told you I have to preach [music]
[8:29] 10.
[8:31] &gt;&gt; I won't stay with YOU IN SIX. I HAVE TO
[8:33] PUSH you all the way to 10 all the way
[8:37] to what this message is supposed to
[8:39] produce. [cheering]
[8:43] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[8:44] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY PEOPLE WANT TO GO TO the
[8:46] rapture?
[8:48] &gt;&gt; Now listen to brother Brham. Brother
[8:50] Brham is saying this. Brother Brham say
[8:53] I truly believe when
[8:55] &gt;&gt; before
[8:56] &gt;&gt; not after
[8:58] &gt;&gt; before the church can have what?
[9:01] &gt;&gt; The rapture. WE GOT TO HAVE water
[9:03] &gt;&gt; rapturing faith.
[9:04] &gt;&gt; WE CAN'T EVEN HAVE FAITH FOR DIVINE
[9:07] HEALING
[9:09] &gt;&gt; LET ALONE WATER
[9:10] &gt;&gt; RAPTURING FAITH.
[9:11] &gt;&gt; SO DIVINE HEALING IS ELEMENTARY FAITH.
[9:14] [cheering]
[9:16] [applause]
[9:20] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. Don't worry. Even if you
[9:23] don't want to climb, I will put uh
[9:25] something and then go and pump you up
[9:28] until you continue to go up. Are we
[9:30] together?
[9:32] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY
[9:34] BEFORE YOU EVEN GET TO RAPTURING FAITH,
[9:37] &gt;&gt; divine healing must be normal.
[9:40] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[9:42] &gt;&gt; That's correct, brother.
[9:43] &gt;&gt; I know. I know very well. And we will
[9:46] continue with faith because we stop in
[9:48] faith. I know. Exactly. Brother Brham
[9:51] say got to have a faith that shall
[9:54] change what
[9:54] &gt;&gt; and quicken this body
[9:56] &gt;&gt; and what
[9:57] &gt;&gt; be taken away. How can you believe your
[9:59] body can be changed?
[10:03] &gt;&gt; Do you think it's an easy thing?
[10:05] &gt;&gt; No.
[10:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says, he says, I believe
[10:08] there is a church
[10:10] &gt;&gt; on its road tonight,
[10:13] &gt;&gt; a power of what?
[10:14] &gt;&gt; The living God
[10:16] &gt;&gt; that [cheering] man will do what?
[10:18] &gt;&gt; Speak the word.
[10:19] &gt;&gt; Where?
[10:20] &gt;&gt; Here and there.
[10:21] &gt;&gt; AND IT SHALL FLASH LIKE WATER.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; LIGHTNING.
[10:24] &gt;&gt; NOT GOD SPEAKING THE WORD. YOU SPEAKING
[10:26] THE WORD.
[10:27] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]
[10:28] &gt;&gt; NOT GOD. YOU TALKING
[10:35] &gt;&gt; LIFE AND DEATH IS WHERE?
[10:37] &gt;&gt; IN THE POWER OF THE TONGUE.
[10:38] &gt;&gt; WHO TONGUE?
[10:45] &gt;&gt; William Marion Brham. GLORY TO GOD.
[10:47] BROTHER BRHAM SAID, "BUT LOOK FRIEND,
[10:49] THE TIME IS COMING
[10:51] &gt;&gt; THAT WINTER IS DOING WHAT?
[10:53] &gt;&gt; It's rising up a church. IF WE CAN'T
[10:56] HAVE FAITH for what
[10:57] &gt;&gt; divine healing,
[10:59] &gt;&gt; HOW ARE WE GOING TO HAVE FAITH FOR THE
[11:01] RAPTURE?
[11:07] IF YOUR FAITH IS ALWAYS your remedy,
[11:11] &gt;&gt; if your faith is always urgent care,
[11:15] &gt;&gt; if your faith is always the hospital,
[11:20] &gt;&gt; WHICH DAY IT'S A SENSIBLE THING TO DO,
[11:23] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO CLIMB
[11:26] &gt;&gt; TO A FAITH THAT YOU WAKE UP IN THE
[11:28] MORNING AND YOU SAY, "HEADACHE, MOVE
[11:32] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[11:33] &gt;&gt; YES SIR.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; Without medication,
[11:40] &gt;&gt; WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT MOTIN AFFECTING
[11:44] MY KIDNEYS, WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT
[11:47] TYLENOL AFFECTING MY LIVER,

[11:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[12:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; DID I rub you the wrong way?
[12:05] &gt;&gt; If you thought I rub you the wrong way,
[12:06] what is coming up is powerful.
[12:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham SAYS WE GOT TO DO WHAT?
[12:12] &gt;&gt; Move out.
[12:13] &gt;&gt; Move out. WHO,
[12:14] &gt;&gt; FRIEND?
[12:15] &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO GET OUT OF THIS WATER.
[12:18] &gt;&gt; OH, slow church condition that we're in.

[13:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you afraid taking your
[13:54] sickness to the hospital?
[13:57] &gt;&gt; Ah, BROTHER BRHAM, BROTHER BRHAM SAYS
[14:00] THIS IN THE message life 1957062
[14:05] paragraph 151.
[14:08] Brother Brham say am I not mistaken?
[14:11] This is sister who?
[14:13] &gt;&gt; Craig. So, brother Brandham was in
[14:15] church and he looked and he said,
[14:20] I see, is that sister Craig or what?
[14:24] &gt;&gt; This is what brother Brham is saying.
[14:26] &gt;&gt; Why is brother Brandham saying that
[14:29] about sister Craig?
[14:30] &gt;&gt; In other words, the prophet is surprised
[14:33] &gt;&gt; to see Sister Craig in church.
[14:38] &gt;&gt; Put your seat belt.
[14:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[14:42] &gt;&gt; AND SISTER GREG RESPOND.
[14:49] &gt;&gt; SISTER GREG SAY WHAT?

[14:52] &gt;&gt; This is me.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, SISTER GREG CONFIRM
[14:55] &gt;&gt; THAT BROTHER BRHAM IT'S ME.
[14:58] &gt;&gt; WHY IS BROTHER Brandham surprised about
[15:00] a believer being in church?
[15:04] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN CHURCH SERVICE are open,
[15:06] &gt;&gt; it's a believer SHOULD BE THERE. BUT
[15:09] BROTHER BRANDHAM SEES A CHRISTIAN, a
[15:11] daughter, a sister in church and brother
[15:13] Brandham say a mom is taken.
[15:17] &gt;&gt; In other words, brother Brham didn't
[15:19] think that sister should be where she
[15:21] was.
[15:24] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS WRONG WITH SISTER CRAIG? BROTHER
[15:27] BRHAM SAY I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONDITION.
[15:30] WHO?
[15:30] &gt;&gt; SISTER CRAIG
[15:32] &gt;&gt; THAT YOU GOT SO sick
[15:35] &gt;&gt; and YOU HAD TO WHAT?
[15:36] &gt;&gt; LEAVE. SO, BROTHER BRHAM WAS SURPRISED
[15:41] &gt;&gt; THAT SISTER CRAIG BEING SO SICK
[15:44] &gt;&gt; WAS IN SERVICE.
[15:48] [applause]
[15:53] &gt;&gt; This is not a rebuke.
[15:55] &gt;&gt; I'm pulling you up. BROTHER BRHAM SAY
[15:57] NOW LOOK WAY OUT THERE IN THOSE desert
[16:01] you have done what?
[16:02] &gt;&gt; Labored away
[16:03] &gt;&gt; with who?
[16:04] &gt;&gt; With your husband here
[16:05] &gt;&gt; for the who? the cause of Christ.
[16:07] &gt;&gt; THE VERY THING THAT YOU HAVE STOOD FOR,
[16:09] Sister Craig, is the only thing that can

[16:23] &gt;&gt; among
[16:24] &gt;&gt; Indian people.
[16:25] &gt;&gt; So the sister returned from Indian
[16:26] quickly because she got really sick. But
[16:29] brother Brandham is surprised he's in
[16:31] church. And brother Brandham say and
