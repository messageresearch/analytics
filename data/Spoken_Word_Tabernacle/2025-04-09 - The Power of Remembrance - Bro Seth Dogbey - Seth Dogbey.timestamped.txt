[0:02] hearken unto the voice of the first

[14:53] line the original
[14:57] se God's truth were manifested to his
[15:01] bride in this last day. We have caught
[15:04] that revelation by the bronze prophets
[15:08] message. And we know who we are,
[15:12] what we raised up for. Oh, praise the
[15:16] Lord. For the original
[15:18] life, the original
[15:21] life, the original
[15:24] city, the original
[15:27] word. That's what I believe.
[15:31] The son of man is revealed. The seventh
[15:34] seal is unveiled. The original
[15:38] life, the original
[15:42] se. We are worthless today. That is what
[15:47] the scriptures say. And our names are
[15:50] seen within. Redeemed and perfect
[15:53] without sin. Yes, we are
[15:57] anointed and inspired by our
[16:01] God whose original
[16:04] life. The original

[16:10] seed, the original
[16:13] word. That's what I
[16:16] believe. The son of man is revealed. The
[16:20] seventh seal is unfair. The original
[16:24] life, the original
[16:28] sea. Our eyes of understanding. He has
[16:32] opened up at last and sweet victory is
[16:36] ours. Who was chained down in the past.

[16:54] the original
[16:56] seed, the original
[16:59] word. That's what I
[17:01] believe. The seven seal.
[17:05] The seven seal is the original
[17:10] life. The original
[17:13] seed. We are called unto adoption. Full
[17:18] authority and power. Sleeping saints
[17:21] will wake and join us for translation in
[17:25] this hour. Gentile days soon will be

[17:52] seal isn't the original
[17:56] life. The original
[17:59] seed. The original
[18:02] life. The original

[18:29] That first song, that first song, one of
[18:33] the verses said, "Thrilling me with life
[18:36] divine."

[25:25] been to rehab or something, but the the
[25:28] poor man had a had a stroke in the
[25:30] bathroom where they were. So Chris and
[25:33] Rebecca had to rush over there and they

[38:58] I have to testify before I sing this
[39:01] song because it's only by the grace of
[39:03] God I'm standing here being able to
[39:06] speak.
[39:09] Um, right before service, it was
[39:11] probably like about minutes to six.
[39:14] supposed to be ready for church. But I
[39:16] was in bed shivering in pain from a
[39:19] toothache. Yes, I'm one of those with
[39:21] the
[39:22] toothache. And I said, "Lord, I can't
[39:26] make it." I messaged Brother Steven
[39:28] because I couldn't talk. I said,
[39:29] "Brother Steven, I'm in pain. I need
[39:32] medicine and I'm in pain. I don't think
[39:34] I'm going to come to church
[39:37] tonight." Messaged Brother Seth. Told
[39:39] him the same thing. Okay, sister, we'll
[39:40] pray for you. And I lay in bed. And I'm
[39:43] like, something said you're going to get
[39:45] the devil get the victory. I said,
[39:47] absolutely not. And the pain was strong.
[39:52] It's still there. But I said, Lord, I'm
[39:54] going to come here tonight and I'm going
[39:57] to speak to the storm because a song was
[40:00] requested last week and I wasn't able to
[40:02] sing it, but the na the words of the
[40:04] song is speak to the storm and speak to
[40:07] the rain because we have the power,
[40:10] right, to claim the victory. And I want
[40:12] to thank God for a praying family
[40:14] because all of those who said we're
[40:16] praying for you and a praying husband.
[40:18] Praise the Lord. So I just want to stand
[40:20] here today and say I'm going to speak to
[40:22] the story.
[40:27] [Music]
[40:37] Amen. Speak to the storm.

[41:30] authority. God commands the devil to set
[41:34] your loved ones free. The third pull is
[41:37] here now. It can't be
[41:40] imitated. The power that's in the bride
[41:44] cannot be duplicated. Speak to the storm
[41:49] and speak to the

[46:40] just be there on time and let's do what
[46:42] we got to do and get some fellowship
[46:44] together. Amen. Sister Rof, I don't know
[46:47] what you have been doing with Isaac, but
[46:49] I want the sun to be like this on

[47:05] Sunday. Oh my praise. Finally, we
[47:09] getting done with this system and it's
[47:11] working by God's grace. You keep praying
[47:13] for whatever is going outside of this
[47:16] four hole. You just keep praying for it
[47:18] and the Lord will continue. Like brother
[47:20] Robert told me, he say, "Brother Steven,
[47:23] there is an abundance of rain." You see
[47:25] a cloud that looks like a man's hand,
[47:28] but it's telling you there is abundance
[47:30] of rain coming up. Amen. So, God knows
[47:32] what he's doing. So uh you who have two
[47:36] faith call in the morning and schedule
[47:38] appointment quickly tell them it's an
[47:40] emergency and then your pastor will
[47:42] handle it. Brother Brandham say God also
[47:45] heal by medicine. I got the quote. If
[47:47] you want I can put it right there.
[47:51] Amen. Oh if you don't say amen, I put
[47:53] the quote.
[47:55] By the way, I'm say God heals by
[47:57] medicine. Amen. So let's see what uh how
[48:00] we can handle this together. I can read
[48:03] between the lines. I got all your
[48:05] uh uh I have heard your cry and I I have
[48:10] come down to deliver you.
[48:16] Amen. If you reading your Bible every
[48:19] day, you will begin to understand my
[48:21] language because some people say I speak
[48:23] in peril. I say, "Okay, if you read the
[48:25] Bible," I was talking to somebody and
[48:27] and they were trying to get something
[48:29] and I say, "You know what? Uh, just tell
[48:33] Samuel what we will do. We will tell
[48:35] Samuel to go ahead and hold a sacrifice,
[48:38] but we will anoint David.
[48:42] It's a scripture."
[48:45] And it took a while and he said, "But
[48:47] Stephen, can you speak in English?"
[48:51] In other words, speak in a plain
[48:53] language. Then I have to explain what I
[48:55] say. I say, "Okay, this one is going to
[48:57] do this and you coming for the sacrifice
[48:58] and then you get the anointed through
[49:00] the sacrifice." That's what is going to
[49:02] happen. Amen. So you pray everything is
[49:04] working well by God's grace. We had a
[49:06] little rest and a wonderful service on
[49:09] Sunday.
[49:17] God spoke so much on Sunday that I
[49:20] didn't know what to do. He pick Ruth, he
[49:22] pick uh Esther, he pick whatever the
[49:25] second oil and he been going. Somebody
[49:27] that I have seen for
[49:30] years and you don't know even how old he
[49:32] is, but when he was here, you even
[49:34] forget his age. He said, "You a preacher
[49:37] killing church." After service, he was
[49:39] worn out completely.
[49:42] He could even hardly walk. And I look at
[49:44] the way he was walking. I said,
[49:45] "Brother, I knew they're going to wear
[49:47] you
[49:49] down." Oh my God. He was so happy. He
[49:53] was on the airport. He already sent me a
[49:54] text. Uh I mean traveling home. He's so
[49:57] so so happy and touched by the presence
[50:00] of the Lord. And we were I mean this is
[50:03] a I don't even know what to say. If you
[50:05] go back, you sit down and you listen to
[50:07] everything that was coming up. God spoke
[50:09] plainly, directly, and he was touching
[50:12] almost every corner. That was the Holy
[50:15] Spirit. Amen. If you don't believe it,
[50:18] me I believe.
[50:21] Amen. Yeah. Even Philillip, he talk
[50:24] about Philillip and every other stuff.
[50:27] Oh, have I say something
[50:31] wrong? Ah,
[50:34] I didn't talk to him. I don't tell
[50:35] preacher what to preach. They come and
[50:37] they preach and they move on. Amen.
[50:42] Glory to God. Brother Set Dogby will be
[50:44] preaching to us tonight. Amen. Praise
[50:48] God. Brother Set has been a tremendous
[50:51] help, a trustee, a song leader. He's
[50:54] here training and I don't know almost
[50:57] everywhere. So God richly bless you for

[57:31] So, the scripture or the Bible said the
[57:35] Lord God will do nothing.
[57:39] So it means when you see a prophet sir,
[57:42] it means the Lord God is doing
[57:43] something.
[57:45] Yes sir.
[57:48] Amen. When you see a prophet on the
[57:51] scene, the Lord God is doing something.
[57:55] Amen. Amen. Yes, sir. Now this this is
[57:59] one thing
[58:01] about the spirit of a prophet. Amen.
[58:06] when he comes.
[58:09] Amen. He's coming with the dosier the
[58:12] Lord. That's right. Amen. And the
[58:14] dossier the Lord has three parts if I
[58:18] put it that way. It is either speaking
[58:21] of something going on now or is making
[58:24] reference to something in the past or
[58:27] it's telling you something in the
[58:28] future. Correct? Amen. Amen.
[58:32] Now I want us to open to Revelations 1
[58:36] verse 8. Yes sir. Revelations 1 verse 8.
[58:41] Amen. Amen.
[58:44] Amen.
[58:47] Revelations 1 verse 8.
[58:52] Yes sir. He said, "I am alpha and omega,
[58:57] the beginning and the ending, say the
[59:01] Lord,
[59:02] which is
[59:06] and I thank God that he started with
[59:08] which is
[59:10] because brother Abraham said man is
[59:12] always looking at what is going to
[59:14] happen in the future
[59:17] and what already happened in the past
[59:20] but not seeing what is going on right
[59:22] Now,
[59:23] but the fact is that without right now,
[59:27] we can't make reference to the past.
[59:31] Neither can we make reference to the
[59:32] future. There must be a today so I can
[59:36] say there's a tomorrow.
[59:38] There must be a today so that I can say
[59:41] yesterday.
[59:43] So man is always missing that now
[59:47] portion
[59:50] of the word of God.
[59:52] Amen. So anytime we fall into any
[59:55] condition or any situation, our mind
[59:58] either goes back and begin to blame
[1:00:01] something
[1:00:03] or our mind is moving forward. Amen. But
[1:00:08] then we don't realize that before we
[1:00:10] move forward, we must understand what is
[1:00:13] going on right now.
[1:00:15] There must be a now so I can see a
[1:00:18] future because the future is connected
[1:00:21] to whatever is happening now. Before I
[1:00:24] get unexpected in I must see what is
[1:00:27] going on right now.
[1:00:29] Amen. So when we take a beginning and an
[1:00:34] ending
[1:00:36] before you can have a beginning it must
[1:00:39] it means that there is a content. Amen.
[1:00:41] We have a content. That's right. So when
[1:00:44] I take like this waterh and I say this
[1:00:48] is a starting point and this an ending
[1:00:51] point right
[1:00:54] we must know that this whole battle here
[1:00:58] is what I'm talking about
[1:01:01] but if I'm referring to a starting point
[1:01:05] right I must know that it's in reference
[1:01:08] to this bottle. I don't know if I'm
[1:01:10] getting you getting what I'm saying. So
[1:01:14] in order to have a starting point, there
[1:01:16] must be a main body. That's right. So I
[1:01:20] can see there's a starting point and
[1:01:22] there's an ending point. What I'm trying
[1:01:24] to say is that whatever circumstance or
[1:01:27] situation we are in right now is
[1:01:30] actually part of the whole process.
[1:01:35] Amen. It's actually part of the whole
[1:01:37] process. That is why I love this
[1:01:39] scripture. say which is
[1:01:42] and which was and which is to come. The
[1:01:46] Almighty.
[1:01:49] Amen. Amen. Said I am the alpha and
[1:01:51] omega.
[1:01:53] Amen.
[1:01:55] We want to go to this scripture.
[1:02:00] Amen. Help us Lord tonight. Amen. Amen.
[1:02:03] Amen. Now I'm getting to my main
[1:02:06] scripture tonight. Second Peter. Uhhuh.
[1:02:10] Second Peter chapter 1. Yes sir. Verse 1
[1:02:14] to4. Uhhuh.
[1:02:23] Second Peter chapter 1 verse 1-4. Amen.
[1:02:27] Amen. And we're going to take verse 15
[1:02:29] as well. So he said, "Simon Peter, a
[1:02:34] servant and apostle of Jesus Christ to
[1:02:38] them that have obtained like precious
[1:02:40] faith with us through the righteousness
[1:02:43] of God and our savior Jesus Christ,
[1:02:47] grace and peace be multiplied unto you."
[1:02:54] I love this thing so much, brother.
[1:02:59] Amen. Brother Brown said this that God
[1:03:04] works with the way we think.
[1:03:08] If you are a farmer, God is going to
[1:03:11] work his
[1:03:12] ways through your profession so you can
[1:03:16] understand him. That is why brother
[1:03:19] Abraham as a hunter, God has to use him,
[1:03:23] use his profession to reveal himself to
[1:03:26] him. Amen. Amen. So looking at Peter,
[1:03:31] Amen.
[1:03:33] Peter saw the manifestation of Christ.
[1:03:37] But on the day of
[1:03:39] Pentecost, he saw a multiplication.
[1:03:44] So when Peter is approaching the people
[1:03:46] of God, his mind is a multiplication.
[1:03:51] He's not just saying peace and grace.
[1:03:53] He's talking about multiply. Now when
[1:03:56] you go to first Peter, he still talks
[1:03:58] about multiply,
[1:04:01] peace and grace. Amen. So what I'm
[1:04:04] trying to say is that when God has given
[1:04:08] something to the bride of Christ. Amen.
[1:04:11] That thinking is how we are supposed to
[1:04:14] go or that is how God is going to use us
[1:04:18] to think. When he's saying that we are
[1:04:22] gods, he's trying to deliver something
[1:04:24] to our minds so we begin to think that
[1:04:27] way.
[1:04:29] [Applause]
[1:04:32] Amen.
[1:04:33] Now, let's go to verse 15.
[1:04:36] Verse 15 says
[1:04:37] this.
[1:04:39] Moreover, sorry, let me finish with all
[1:04:41] that. I said one to four. Let me finish.
[1:04:44] So verse two, it say, "Grace and peace
[1:04:46] be multiplied unto you through the
[1:04:48] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord."
[1:04:54] According as his divine power has given
[1:04:56] unto us all things.
[1:05:00] Amen. That pertain unto life and
[1:05:03] godliness. Amen.
[1:05:06] through the knowledge of him that had
[1:05:08] called us to glory and virtue, whereby
[1:05:12] are given unto us
[1:05:14] exceeding great and precious promises,
[1:05:19] that by this ye might be partakers of
[1:05:22] the divine nature, having escaped the
[1:05:25] corruption that is in the word through
[1:05:28] lust. Amen. Now 15 it says,
[1:05:31] "Moreover, I will endeavor that ye may
[1:05:35] be able after my disease to have these
[1:05:39] things always
[1:05:42] always." Always in remembrance. That's
[1:05:45] right. So my subject tonight is the
[1:05:49] power of remembrance.
[1:05:52] Amen. Yes.
[1:05:55] Peter said, "Let's have this always in
[1:05:58] remembrance."
[1:06:00] Amen. So the question is, are we the
[1:06:03] ones who are doing our own remembering?
[1:06:08] Amen.
[1:06:10] Amen. Now, let me read this quote from
[1:06:13] the Patmos vision
[1:06:16] before I read that scripture. Amen. He
[1:06:18] said, "Now the beginning when God, the
[1:06:21] Bible said in Revelation that the
[1:06:23] antichrist in the last days, now look at
[1:06:26] this churches all getting together. The
[1:06:30] antichrist in the last days will deceive
[1:06:33] all that was on the earth, whose names
[1:06:36] were not written in the lamb's book of
[1:06:38] life from the foundation of the world."
[1:06:41] Now, when was your name put on the book
[1:06:45] of life? Uh-huh. So, the prophet said,
[1:06:47] "Before we ever had a word," That's
[1:06:50] right. Now, this
[1:06:54] I just love this. He said, "You
[1:06:58] were chosen to receive That's right. the
[1:07:01] Holy Ghost in this age."
[1:07:07] You were chosen to receive the Holy
[1:07:10] Ghost in this age. It is a promise
[1:07:15] that is given to the bride. Amen. And
[1:07:18] that's what the prophet is saying to us
[1:07:21] that we were chosen. When we are seeing
[1:07:24] the antichrist doing whatever he's
[1:07:26] doing, the standard of the Holy Ghost,
[1:07:29] the prophet said we were the chosen
[1:07:31] vessels. God has chosen us to overcome
[1:07:35] whatever the antichrist is doing in this
[1:07:38] last age.
[1:07:40] Amen.
[1:07:41] Yes sir. Now let's take this scripture.
[1:07:44] Are we the one doing the remembering?
[1:07:47] John chapter 14.
[1:07:50] There it is.
[1:07:52] John 14.
[1:07:57] John 14 verse 1-4.
[1:08:00] It says let not your heart be troubled.
[1:08:05] Ye believe in God, believe also in me.
[1:08:09] In my father's house are many mansions.
[1:08:12] If it were not so, I would have told
[1:08:15] you. I go to prepare a place for you.
[1:08:19] And if I go and prepare a place for you,
[1:08:21] I will come again and receive you unto
[1:08:25] myself, that where I am, there ye may be
[1:08:30] also. I receive you unto myself. Amen.
[1:08:34] And whether I go, you know, and the way
[1:08:37] you know. Now we go to 16. Let's jump to
[1:08:42] 16. Hallelujah.
[1:08:44] Verse 16.
[1:08:46] And I will pray the father that he shall
[1:08:50] give you another comforter.
[1:08:53] Amen. The question is who is praying?
[1:08:57] Amen. Amen. He send you another
[1:08:59] comforter that he may abide with you
[1:09:03] forever, even the spirit of truth, whom
[1:09:07] the world cannot receive, because it
[1:09:09] seeth him not, neither knoweth him, but
[1:09:13] he ye know him, for he dwelleth with
[1:09:16] you, and shall be in you.
[1:09:20] So he said, I will not leave you
[1:09:23] comfortless.
[1:09:24] I will come to you. Amen. Now let's go
[1:09:28] to 26 to 28. That's it. Amen.
[1:09:33] Said, "But the comforter."
[1:09:36] Now Christ is giving us what he's going
[1:09:38] to do.
[1:09:40] But the comforter, which is the Holy
[1:09:42] Ghost, whom the father will send in my
[1:09:46] name, he shall teach you all things.
[1:09:50] Amen.
[1:09:52] He shall teach you all things and bring
[1:09:57] all things to your remembrance
[1:10:01] whatsoever I have said unto you.
[1:10:05] Amen. Amen.
[1:10:08] That is what the Holy Ghost is doing.
[1:10:10] So, brother Brown said, "We were chosen
[1:10:12] in this age for this day's Holy Ghost."
[1:10:17] So the Holy Ghost is supposed to teach
[1:10:19] us all things. We've come to the
[1:10:22] capstone ministry.
[1:10:25] So it is a promise to the bride. Amen.
[1:10:30] And he's saying that he's bringing us to
[1:10:32] remembrance.
[1:10:33] It means that somebody might forget
[1:10:35] something.
[1:10:37] Somebody can go into a situation,
[1:10:40] a sickness, a trouble. Amen. And might
[1:10:44] forget. Yes, sir. But then he said he's
[1:10:46] doing one thing. He shall bring to you
[1:10:50] the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost. He shall
[1:10:53] bring the spirit of remembrance. He's
[1:10:56] coming to remember the promises that he
[1:11:00] gave to you.
[1:11:01] [Music]
[1:11:04] Amen.
[1:11:06] Amen.
[1:11:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I
[1:11:10] take this quote.
[1:11:12] Hallelujah. I'm going to read some
[1:11:14] quotes tonight. Amen. Wonderful. This is
[1:11:18] from the message the resurrection of
[1:11:19] Lazarus preached in 59. Amen. He said
[1:11:24] paragraph 28. He said, "And now there
[1:11:27] are those sitting here who are feeble
[1:11:30] this afternoon." Amen. That's in need of
[1:11:33] physical healing. Amen. So, anybody who
[1:11:36] is in need of healing, the Lord has
[1:11:38] already heard your prayer. Amen. And we
[1:11:41] have chosen these few words to read from
[1:11:43] dine. Amen. The prophet is praying. And
[1:11:46] may the Holy Spirit, the third person of
[1:11:48] the trinity, we understand that very
[1:11:50] well. Come in now. He said the promise,
[1:11:55] the comforter. Amen. The comforter is
[1:11:58] the promise. Amen. He said that you said
[1:12:02] you will send
[1:12:04] and he will take the things of God. And
[1:12:07] will show them to us. That's right.
[1:12:09] Amen. And as your humble servant here
[1:12:12] speaks, sanctify the lips. Amen. The
[1:12:14] same thing brother said. Amen. Sanctify
[1:12:17] the lips that speak. Circumcise them,
[1:12:20] Lord. Taking away all words that will
[1:12:23] not be suitable. Amen. And the hearts
[1:12:25] and ears out there. That's to receive
[1:12:29] it. May the Holy Spirit take the word
[1:12:31] right straight to the heart. That's our
[1:12:34] prayer tonight.
[1:12:36] The next quote is the same message. He
[1:12:38] said, "And may it fall on good ground
[1:12:43] fing forth a hundfold." That's right.
[1:12:48] Now, we're talking about multiplication.
[1:12:51] Yes, sir. The prophet is interested in
[1:12:54] the hundfold. We're going to get
[1:12:57] somewhere tonight. Amen.
[1:13:00] When you see the 100fold, there's a
[1:13:03] scripture where we are 30, 60, 100fold.
[1:13:07] That's right. But the prophet, the
[1:13:10] prophet's ambition, Yes, sir. is that we
[1:13:13] receive the 100fold. That's right. He
[1:13:16] never said 60. He never said 30. We are
[1:13:19] going to get to that. Amen. It said,
[1:13:22] "And may this afternoon, Lord, while we
[1:13:24] are yet
[1:13:25] speaking, Amen. May the Holy Ghost come
[1:13:28] into the building as a rushing mighty
[1:13:31] wind like it did on the day of
[1:13:34] Pentecost. May the street be crowded out
[1:13:37] here with people. Amen. God granted
[1:13:39] Father. Amen. May the feeble be made
[1:13:41] well, the lame walking, the blind
[1:13:44] seeing, the deaf hear, the damp speak,
[1:13:47] those that are bound with sickness be
[1:13:49] set free. May there be such a joy in the
[1:13:53] camp till every heart will be so
[1:13:56] thrilled till they just don't know where
[1:13:59] they're at or what they're doing.
[1:14:02] That is the prayer tonight. We read
[1:14:04] this. Do you now believe? Amen. Now the
[1:14:08] prophet said, "Now he sits at the right
[1:14:11] hand of the father tonight, God
[1:14:14] Almighty." Yes, sir. To make as a high
[1:14:17] priest to act in ourstead. That's right.
[1:14:20] Do you believe that? To make
[1:14:23] intercessions upon our confession. Amen.
[1:14:26] Is that right? Hebrews 3:1. He's the
[1:14:28] high priest of our confession. Whatever
[1:14:31] we confess that he has done.
[1:14:35] Whatever we confess, not what he's going
[1:14:38] to do. But what he has done. Amen. He
[1:14:42] said first we have to believe it. Then
[1:14:45] we confess it. Amen. He's setting before
[1:14:47] the father to make that right. Amen.
[1:14:51] Amen. Is that true? Amen. Now, is if
[1:14:55] there's a fundamentalist here. Amen. I
[1:14:57] believe all those spirits are out by
[1:14:59] now. Amen. That's as sound as I know the
[1:15:02] scripture. Amen. All right. Then he
[1:15:04] said, "I'll pray the father. He will
[1:15:07] send you another comforter, which was
[1:15:10] the Holy Ghost. He will abide with you
[1:15:12] forever. He will not testify himself,
[1:15:15] but he will testify of me. Whatever he
[1:15:18] sees that he will do and he will show
[1:15:21] you things that is to come. Is that
[1:15:23] right? That's right. Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:15:25] Now, this message, do you the same
[1:15:27] message? Do you believe he said now the
[1:15:29] world may take the word and scrum it all
[1:15:32] up in these theological seminaries,
[1:15:34] amen, and teach this and philosophy and
[1:15:37] so forth and psychology and theory and
[1:15:40] so forth. They might do that. But yet
[1:15:44] one thing
[1:15:46] sure, we have the Holy Spirit as a
[1:15:50] divine witness.
[1:15:53] And if that is truly the Holy Spirit,
[1:15:55] then it bears record of Christ. For it
[1:15:59] is Christ in spirit form.
[1:16:02] So when we are talking about God in you,
[1:16:06] Amen. The Holy Ghost, the prophet is
[1:16:08] saying that Christ in spirit form. Yes,
[1:16:11] sir. So, that doesn't make it different
[1:16:14] from the same Jesus that was 2,000 years
[1:16:16] ago. Because he's now in spirit form in
[1:16:19] his bride. Amen. It say a little while
[1:16:23] and the world seeth me no more. But you
[1:16:26] will see me for I will be with you even
[1:16:29] in you.
[1:16:30] Making him the same here on earth in
[1:16:34] spirit form until the end of the age.
[1:16:38] Amen. So, you get it? Now I take my time
[1:16:42] so it'll really soak in good. We should
[1:16:44] be used to this um statement by now.
[1:16:48] Take my time so it really soak in good.
[1:16:50] Amen. Now let's watch. Amen. Then by
[1:16:53] their fruit he shall know them. Now if
[1:16:56] any man be in Christ, he be a new
[1:16:59] creature. Amen. Then God has set in the
[1:17:02] church different things. We are getting
[1:17:05] somewhere. Amen. Now, man can testify of
[1:17:09] anything, but until God confirms that
[1:17:12] and said it's so, it isn't so. All
[1:17:16] right? You've got a right to disbelieve
[1:17:18] it. He said, "When man testify something
[1:17:22] and God does not confirm it, we have
[1:17:24] every right to disbelieve it."
[1:17:27] until God vindicates that it's the
[1:17:31] truth, then you have no right,
[1:17:35] no more right to disbelieve God.
[1:17:40] So when God vindicates something,
[1:17:44] there's no more right to disbelieve God.
[1:17:47] That's what the prophet is saying.
[1:17:49] Yes, sir. Now, question and answers in
[1:17:52] 54 said, you say, "Well, glory to God."
[1:17:55] The Bible said when the Holy Ghost is
[1:17:57] come, you don't need any teacher.
[1:18:01] He's the teacher himself.
[1:18:03] The prophet said, "Oh brother,
[1:18:06] how can you be so little to read the
[1:18:09] scripture?"
[1:18:10] Why did the Holy Ghost setteers in the
[1:18:14] church then?
[1:18:17] [Music]
[1:18:19] Amen. Amen.
[1:18:22] So spoken word tabernacle
[1:18:25] when we see a teaching ministry in a
[1:18:29] church it is a promise that the Lord
[1:18:33] gave us that represents the Holy Ghost
[1:18:36] to you.
[1:18:40] Because the Holy Ghost is a teacher and
[1:18:42] the Holy Ghost uses a vessel. Amen. It's
[1:18:46] a say I don't have to have anybody teach
[1:18:48] me to teach me. The Holy Ghost teaches
[1:18:51] me. I have the Holy Ghost.
[1:18:54] He's teaching me. I understand by the
[1:18:56] Holy Ghost. He said it does through a
[1:19:00] teacher.
[1:19:02] He said he said teachers in the church.
[1:19:05] Amen. He said are all teachers are all
[1:19:08] apostles are all gifts of healing. The
[1:19:10] Holy Ghost said these things in the
[1:19:11] church and he operates them all. And
[1:19:14] each one of them operates orderly.
[1:19:16] That's right. Each one of them operates
[1:19:19] orderly. I want to read this before I
[1:19:20] say anything. Amen. He said this is in
[1:19:23] 54 question and answers. He said, "Oh,
[1:19:25] please church."
[1:19:27] Now this is strong now. Amen. Have faith
[1:19:31] just a little while. See, you must come
[1:19:34] under teaching.
[1:19:37] [Applause]
[1:19:40] The prophet said
[1:19:42] you must
[1:19:45] just like how the scripture said you
[1:19:47] must be born again. The prophet said you
[1:19:51] must come under teaching.
[1:19:54] Amen. It's a must. Amen. He said you say
[1:19:59] I don't need no one to teach me after
[1:20:01] the Holy Ghost has come. My friends,
[1:20:04] that gives me just a little room to
[1:20:07] doubt whether you've really got it.
[1:20:11] [Music]
[1:20:13] Amen. Amen.
[1:20:15] You really got it or not, then see the
[1:20:18] way you are acting with it. See, see the
[1:20:21] thing you're doing now. Why if this if
[1:20:24] if the Bible says the Holy Spirit is the
[1:20:27] teacher, why did the Holy Spirit put
[1:20:29] teachers in the church then? to set the
[1:20:32] church in order. The same Holy Spirit is
[1:20:35] a chill.
[1:20:37] We don't need any seminaries to go
[1:20:40] around a big bunch of men to look out
[1:20:43] these things. The Holy Spirit is a
[1:20:45] teacher. See, it's a teacher and it
[1:20:49] gives some fellow a gift of teaching.
[1:20:54] Now, this is strong. Then you must be
[1:20:58] subject to that gift. Amen. The prophecy
[1:21:02] is a must to be subject to that gift.
[1:21:07] Amen. Because the Holy Spirit is using
[1:21:11] that office
[1:21:13] to manifest the pro the promise that he
[1:21:16] gave to his church.
[1:21:19] Amen.
[1:21:24] Now I I just want to um say something
[1:21:28] later about teaching. Amen. Now teaching
[1:21:32] is to show or to explain something.
[1:21:37] So when somebody just says something to
[1:21:40] you, Amen. Sometimes we might
[1:21:42] misunderstand
[1:21:44] or sometimes we might we we might miss
[1:21:47] the point. Right? So we go back and ask
[1:21:51] what do you mean by this? That's right.
[1:21:55] That is why when Jesus spoke to the
[1:21:58] Pharisees in parables,
[1:22:01] he spoke to them, they didn't
[1:22:03] understand. But when he come to his
[1:22:06] disciples, he said it was not given to
[1:22:09] them, it was given to you. So he comes
[1:22:12] to explain
[1:22:14] now it gives a grounding to the
[1:22:17] disciples. They understand exactly what
[1:22:20] he meant.
[1:22:22] Amen. So it is to show or to explain.
[1:22:26] Now there's there's another thing about
[1:22:28] teaching. He said to cause to learn or
[1:22:31] understand something by example or
[1:22:35] experience.
[1:22:38] So to cause you to learn something by an
[1:22:42] experience. That's right. So it is
[1:22:44] teaching you. Amen. So when you see an
[1:22:47] example, you you know that um this is
[1:22:50] how it goes. Just like when we go to
[1:22:52] school, especially math class, which
[1:22:55] some of us normally run away from. Amen.
[1:22:58] That when they teach the concept, Amen.
[1:23:01] Sometimes they have to go through a lot
[1:23:03] of examples.
[1:23:05] So you can get what that concept is.
[1:23:09] After you go through all those examples,
[1:23:11] now you understand that concept. That's
[1:23:13] right. Amen. So the Holy Ghost, Amen.
[1:23:19] for him to teach us,
[1:23:21] he makes us go through things. Yes, sir.
[1:23:25] So we have an experience.
[1:23:28] So when he's saying that God is a
[1:23:30] healer, he pushes you to the point of
[1:23:34] sickness. That's right. So now when the
[1:23:37] sickness happens to you, now he's come
[1:23:40] to teach you what he means by I am the
[1:23:43] Lord that heal your diseases.
[1:23:46] So he's giving you an example. Now you
[1:23:49] understand that it is not that he was
[1:23:52] just saying it but you have been taught.
[1:23:55] That's right.
[1:23:57] Amen. You have an experience.
[1:24:02] Amen. Yes sir. Now let's um read Titus
[1:24:05] 1:3.
[1:24:08] Titus 1:3. Amen.
[1:24:14] Yes, sir. Titus
[1:24:19] 13. He said, "But have in due times
[1:24:23] manifested his word through preaching."
[1:24:27] Amen. Which is committed unto me
[1:24:30] according to the commandment of God. our
[1:24:33] savior. That's right. So the
[1:24:35] manifestation of God's word is through
[1:24:39] preaching. That's right. So when the
[1:24:41] word of God is coming, Amen. The prophet
[1:24:45] said that the gospel is not just
[1:24:47] preaching, it comes with manifestation.
[1:24:50] That's right. So preaching is a combo.
[1:24:53] So when God is saying something,
[1:24:57] he's trying to tell you that I'm about
[1:24:59] doing something.
[1:25:01] So when God comes to the church and he
[1:25:04] says something to you, he's not just
[1:25:07] saying it. He's trying to tell you that
[1:25:10] I am coming to perform this because he
[1:25:13] promised us the Holy Ghost. Who is going
[1:25:16] to teach us and part of teaching is
[1:25:19] experience? So when the Holy Ghost comes
[1:25:22] and is reminding us of something, he's
[1:25:25] trying to tell us that I'm going to show
[1:25:27] you by example. Yes. Amen.
[1:25:31] Amen.
[1:25:33] Now, we want to go to Matthew chapter
[1:25:35] 13,
[1:25:37] the parable of the swer. Yes, sir.
[1:25:42] The parable of the swer. Matthew 13.
[1:25:45] Yes, sir.
[1:25:48] Amen. And amen. Amen.
[1:25:54] Matthew
[1:25:56] 13 2-3
[1:25:59] uh versus 2 to 23. I I'll try to see if
[1:26:04] I can go very fast.
[1:26:06] Amen. Matthew 13
[1:26:10] 2-23. And great multitudes were gathered
[1:26:12] together unto him, so that he went into
[1:26:15] a ship and sat, and the whole multitude
[1:26:17] stood on the shore. And he spake many
[1:26:20] things unto them in parables, saying,
[1:26:24] Behold, a s went forth to sow. And then
[1:26:28] he sowed some seeds, and and when he
[1:26:31] sowed, some seeds fell by the wayside,
[1:26:35] and the fouls came and devoured them.
[1:26:38] Some fell onto stony places where they
[1:26:41] had not much earth. And forth with they
[1:26:44] sprung up because they had no deepness
[1:26:48] of earth. Amen. And when the sun was up,
[1:26:52] they were scorched. And because they had
[1:26:55] no root, they withered away. And some
[1:26:58] fell among
[1:27:00] thorns. Amen. And some fell among
[1:27:03] thongs. Amen. And the thorns sprang up
[1:27:05] and choked them. But other fell into
[1:27:09] good ground and brought forth fruit.
[1:27:12] some
[1:27:13] 100fold, some 60fold, some 30fold. Now
[1:27:18] let's see in in uh in the dispensation
[1:27:21] of good ground there there were three
[1:27:24] categories of folds. Yes sir. The 100,
[1:27:27] the 60 and the 30. That's exactly right.
[1:27:29] Amen. And said who had ears to hear, let
[1:27:33] him hear. Amen.
[1:27:36] So now Jesus is trying to explain this.
[1:27:41] Amen. to the disciples.
[1:27:44] Amen. He said uh in 18 he said, "Hear ye
[1:27:49] therefore the parable of the swer,
[1:27:51] right? When anyone heareth the word of
[1:27:54] the kingdom,
[1:27:56] and understandeth it not, then cometh
[1:28:00] the wicked one and catcheth away that
[1:28:03] which was sown in his heart." So in in
[1:28:06] in in
[1:28:08] this
[1:28:10] category the person does not understand.
[1:28:14] So the word of God is preached but he
[1:28:18] doesn't understand. So that's the key
[1:28:21] point. He doesn't understand. So the
[1:28:24] devil comes and takes it away. That's
[1:28:26] right. Okay. Amen. So let's read 20. It
[1:28:29] said, "But he that received the seed
[1:28:33] into stony places, the same is he that
[1:28:36] heareth the word, and with joy receiveth
[1:28:40] it, yet hath he not root in
[1:28:45] himself, but endureth for a while. For
[1:28:48] when tribulation or persecution ariseth
[1:28:52] because of the word by and by he is
[1:28:56] offended.
[1:28:58] So troubled by persecutions. That's
[1:29:01] right.
[1:29:02] Persecution based on the word of God.
[1:29:05] They are troubled. They are offended.
[1:29:08] That's the second category. Yes, my
[1:29:09] brother.
[1:29:11] So um the uh 22 it say he also that
[1:29:15] receiveth seed among the thongs is he
[1:29:18] that heareth the
[1:29:20] word and the care of this world and the
[1:29:24] deceitfulness of riches choke the word
[1:29:29] and he becometh unfruitful. That's
[1:29:31] right. So the curse of the word makes
[1:29:34] this p the worse of the word makes this
[1:29:37] person become unfruitful. That's right.
[1:29:39] That's that category. Amen. But he that
[1:29:42] received seed into the good ground is he
[1:29:47] that heareth the word and understandeth
[1:29:51] it.
[1:29:54] Which also beareth fruit and bringeth
[1:29:58] forth. Psalm 100fold, Psalm 60, Psalm
[1:30:04] 30.
[1:30:06] Amen. Amen. Yes sir. So the scripture is
[1:30:12] talking about this category. I'm I'm
[1:30:14] more interested in the last category.
[1:30:16] Amen. That is talking about
[1:30:18] understanding.
[1:30:20] So the key point is that they understand
[1:30:23] the word. That's right. So understanding
[1:30:26] the word brings fruit. That's right.
[1:30:30] That's right. That's right. So the Holy
[1:30:34] Ghost intention
[1:30:36] to us is to come and explain sir so we
[1:30:42] understand the word so we can bear
[1:30:44] fruit.
[1:30:46] That is why he said he said teach us
[1:30:51] the office of teaching.
[1:30:53] Amen. So you can understand what he's
[1:30:56] talking about. So you can bear fruit.
[1:31:00] Yes. So when we see a ministry of
[1:31:03] teaching, let us rejoice cuz it is time
[1:31:06] to bear fruit.
[1:31:11] Amen. When the Holy Ghost comes in that
[1:31:13] office, he's trying to tell you that I
[1:31:16] want you to bear fruit.
[1:31:22] Now,
[1:31:24] there is one interesting thing about
[1:31:26] this category, the fourth category.
[1:31:30] Amen. In uh Luke chapter 8 verse 8 verse
[1:31:35] 15.
[1:31:36] Amen. There is something that was added
[1:31:39] to that. Right. Um how Luke talked about
[1:31:43] that. So we can look at it. Luke 8 verse
[1:31:47] 15. Yes sir.
[1:31:53] Amen. Luke 8:15. He said, "But that on
[1:31:57] the good ground are they, which in an
[1:32:01] honest and good heart, honest and good,
[1:32:05] honest and good heart, having heard the
[1:32:09] word, keep it
[1:32:12] and bring forth fruit with patience."
[1:32:17] Hallelujah.
[1:32:18] [Applause]
[1:32:21] So there is something with this group.
[1:32:26] There's a virtue that is connected to
[1:32:29] this group which we call patience. Now
[1:32:33] when we are talking about patience, the
[1:32:36] element of time comes in.
[1:32:40] [Applause]
[1:32:43] When you look at the first category, the
[1:32:46] prophet said it's just like you pour
[1:32:48] water on a duck's back.
[1:32:52] It didn't take time for the devil to
[1:32:55] come and pick the word. That's right.
[1:32:57] The second category, they moved on with
[1:33:00] a little time, but then the trial
[1:33:05] against that word made them offended.
[1:33:09] So they left the word. So they moved
[1:33:12] with time a little bit. Now the third
[1:33:15] category also extended a little more
[1:33:18] time. But then the curse of this world.
[1:33:21] Amen. The pro the prophet said their
[1:33:24] wisdom they substituted wisdom for
[1:33:27] faith. Amen. So they couldn't hold on.
[1:33:32] But this category.
[1:33:35] Hallelujah.
[1:33:38] Oh my. I want to read this. I didn't add
[1:33:41] this quote, but I want to read this.
[1:33:46] Now listen to what the prophet said.
[1:33:47] This is a message wisdom versus faith.
[1:33:50] He said, "But some fell in the valley of
[1:33:54] persecution.
[1:33:57] Some seed went over into the valley of
[1:34:00] persecution."
[1:34:02] Now in the valley of pers in the valley
[1:34:05] is where you find the
[1:34:07] water. We are talking about good
[1:34:10] grounds.
[1:34:11] Now in the valley is where you find the
[1:34:14] water. The best soil.
[1:34:20] [Applause]
[1:34:21] So talking about patience, persecution.
[1:34:25] The prophet said in a valley is where
[1:34:27] you find the best soil.
[1:34:30] That is where the water is. When you
[1:34:32] take somebody, Amen. has been beat down
[1:34:37] till he's got all the theology beat out
[1:34:40] of him, laughed out of him, made fun of
[1:34:45] him where he's been through the mills
[1:34:48] and ground it all out of him till the
[1:34:52] metal has been ready to work. You find
[1:34:56] out there is some moisture around there.
[1:35:00] Yes, that is right. He said into the
[1:35:03] valley. That fellow has been pushed over
[1:35:07] into the valley. Kicked out of his
[1:35:09] organization. He's down in the dumps.
[1:35:13] They call it see not the dumps but the
[1:35:16] valley. We are thought down in the
[1:35:18] valley. You know that's where the lily
[1:35:21] grows too.
[1:35:23] [Music]
[1:35:23] [Applause]
[1:35:25] So we get so much in in in into
[1:35:29] temptations, into persecutions, into
[1:35:31] trials. The prophet said that is where
[1:35:33] the liies grow. So So that is where the
[1:35:36] fertile ground is. And that is where we
[1:35:40] have patience. Amen. The virtue that is
[1:35:45] for the bride. Amen. The end time bride.
[1:35:48] Now when you look at these categories,
[1:35:50] Amen. The prophet said that that
[1:35:53] stony the ones that fell on the stony
[1:35:55] rock he said the Catholic church. Now
[1:35:57] now you're looking at the progression in
[1:35:59] the church ages. So the Catholic
[1:36:02] church was connected to the stony
[1:36:05] ground. Then he moved to the
[1:36:08] Protestants.
[1:36:10] Amen. That was with the taunts. So it
[1:36:12] started with Martin Luther. Then he went
[1:36:15] to uh Pentecost. So the case of the
[1:36:19] world. Amen. Made them kick Christ out.
[1:36:23] So the fourth category was talking about
[1:36:26] the end time bride.
[1:36:32] So we see that the end time bride, Amen.
[1:36:36] has a virtue called patience. Amen.
[1:36:40] There is no way that the message can
[1:36:44] ever be taken away from them because
[1:36:47] there's a virtue of the extra oil.
[1:36:51] And the extra oil is connected to
[1:36:54] patience. Because they had patience,
[1:36:57] they were able to wait. Even though
[1:36:59] their lamp went out, there was the extra
[1:37:02] oil that they had. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:37:10] Amen. So he said in uh Proverbs 3:25
[1:37:15] said, "But in this valley is a rivers of
[1:37:18] water." Amen. So this valley of
[1:37:21] persecutions is a rivers of water. Now
[1:37:25] we go to Psalms one. Yes sir. He said
[1:37:28] blessed is the man.
[1:37:32] Let me just read it.
[1:37:35] Let me show what's in this valley. He
[1:37:39] said what? Psalms. He said, I thought I
[1:37:43] wouldn't have time, but we just take
[1:37:46] time, but I'm not going to read all
[1:37:48] that. You know what I'm talking about.
[1:37:50] Amen. Amen. He said to save this year,
[1:37:53] we are going to read this and see what
[1:37:55] this man is. So the prophet is saying
[1:37:58] that we get into that valley of
[1:38:01] persecutions and said that is where the
[1:38:04] fertile ground is. That is where the
[1:38:06] good ground is for the seed to have
[1:38:10] roots. Amen. Of patience to overcome
[1:38:14] every power of the devil. Amen. So when
[1:38:18] we go through
[1:38:19] persecutions, let us remember the spirit
[1:38:22] of the Lord is telling us that that is a
[1:38:25] sign of good ground. That is a sign of
[1:38:28] fertile ground because the seed is going
[1:38:31] to grow.
[1:38:35] Amen.
[1:38:37] [Music]
[1:38:38] Now we want to look at some attributes
[1:38:40] of remembrance.
[1:38:44] What when we say remembrance, what do we
[1:38:47] mean? What what are things that are
[1:38:49] connected to remembrance? Amen. Um let's
[1:38:52] look at 1 Corinthians 15 verse 2.
[1:39:01] Yes. And I got this scripture from a
[1:39:03] brother today. Amen. And actually open
[1:39:06] up more fire. Amen.
[1:39:08] 1 Corinthians
[1:39:10] 15:2 it said, "By which also ye are
[1:39:15] saved, if ye keep in memory,
[1:39:19] what I preach unto you,
[1:39:22] unless you have believed in vain."
[1:39:26] So one thing about remembrance is a
[1:39:30] sustaining of our salvation.
[1:39:33] Amen. or the power to resurrect whatever
[1:39:38] has been given to us.
[1:39:41] That's a spirit of remembrance. When you
[1:39:43] when when somebody promises you I always
[1:39:46] love to do this illustration or this
[1:39:48] example. When somebody promises you
[1:39:50] Today I'm going to do a $100,000 check.
[1:39:54] Yes.
[1:39:58] So somebody promises histo $100,000
[1:40:01] check. Amen. Amen. Now at that point
[1:40:06] it's a promise.
[1:40:09] Amen. For it to actually
[1:40:12] manifest there is a time connected to
[1:40:16] it.
[1:40:18] Amen. So when we give a promise there's
[1:40:22] a time the manifestation comes. Now
[1:40:25] before that manifestation will come
[1:40:27] there has to be a remembrance.
[1:40:30] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:40:34] Amen. So she can say that
[1:40:38] I am going to remember you. You said um
[1:40:41] in five weeks time I'm going to get a
[1:40:45] check of $100,000.
[1:40:48] When it is five weeks,
[1:40:51] if the sister doesn't go and say it is
[1:40:55] five weeks, right, she will never get
[1:40:59] the $100,000 check.
[1:41:03] But when she goes and
[1:41:05] say, "I'm bringing to your remembrance
[1:41:08] the promise you gave."
[1:41:12] Then it resurrects whatever promise was
[1:41:15] given.
[1:41:16] And that is a time of fulfillment.
[1:41:19] [Music]
[1:41:21] Amen. So Paul is saying that let us keep
[1:41:27] this in memory.
[1:41:29] The word that was preached unto us, it
[1:41:32] should be in our memory for our own
[1:41:35] salvation.
[1:41:37] Amen. Amen. We want to look at one one
[1:41:41] other thing about remembrance. Amen.
[1:41:47] A rebound effect.
[1:41:50] Now, we all know what a rebound is. When
[1:41:55] I take uh a ball
[1:41:59] and I throw it against the wall. It hits
[1:42:03] it and it come bounces back to me.
[1:42:07] That's a simple example of a rebound.
[1:42:09] Amen. A rebound
[1:42:12] effect. Another example is uh maybe in
[1:42:15] the medical field. Amen. I'm not in the
[1:42:17] medical field, but I'm just giving this
[1:42:19] illustration. Amen. When let's say you
[1:42:22] go to see a doctor. Amen. And you have u
[1:42:25] maybe an infection. Amen. right? A
[1:42:28] bacterial infection or something like
[1:42:29] that. And the doctor says, "I'm going to
[1:42:32] give you a prescription. Take
[1:42:34] antibiotics." Amen. For 7 days, right?
[1:42:40] And the doctor says, "Make sure you
[1:42:43] finish that course or finish the whole
[1:42:46] seven days."
[1:42:48] And then
[1:42:50] maybe by seeing the doctor, Amen. Your
[1:42:54] faith was so high. Sometimes we are sick
[1:42:56] and when we go to the hospital the the
[1:42:58] moment we see the hospital building we
[1:43:01] are always healed. Amen. So
[1:43:05] maybe when you saw the doctor you
[1:43:07] already healed. You felt the healing. So
[1:43:11] um so when you got home you just took
[1:43:14] one uh one pill. Amen. And then you
[1:43:16] started feeling all right. Okay. But
[1:43:19] you're supposed to go seven days. Amen.
[1:43:22] So uh because you were feeling all
[1:43:25] right, you left it right now. When you
[1:43:29] took that medication for that day, it
[1:43:32] killed some portion of the bacteria
[1:43:35] and it left some remnant.
[1:43:38] Now this is what they do. They put on
[1:43:41] extra muscles.
[1:43:45] So what we call rebound effect. Now they
[1:43:48] begin to resist.
[1:43:51] They resist medication.
[1:43:54] So what happens is that the doctor will
[1:43:56] have to increase the dose. I'm just
[1:43:59] trying to talk about rebound.
[1:44:02] Amen. To increase the dose to be able to
[1:44:04] fight that. Now they had they they went
[1:44:08] through a time of um hardship. I'm
[1:44:11] talking about the bacteria. They went
[1:44:14] through a time of hardship. So now they
[1:44:16] began to put on muscles.
[1:44:19] That's that's what happens to some of us
[1:44:21] when we go through certain situations
[1:44:24] and and and and and we see it coming
[1:44:27] back again and you're like, you know
[1:44:28] what, I'm not going to allow you to do
[1:44:31] this anymore.
[1:44:33] Amen. That is a kind of rebound.
[1:44:36] And and sometimes to um I don't want to
[1:44:39] go to this rod, but I just want to say
[1:44:40] it. Amen.
[1:44:42] Sometimes some some of um our young
[1:44:44] brothers or our young sisters who um
[1:44:47] found themselves in a kind of
[1:44:49] relationship situation
[1:44:52] a kind of relationship situation.
[1:44:55] Amen. And it didn't happen.
[1:44:59] Amen. And some something happened to
[1:45:01] them. Amen.
[1:45:03] Amen. Because something was taken away.
[1:45:06] Okay. There's a tendency to easily fall
[1:45:10] to something else or to fall to someone
[1:45:12] else.
[1:45:14] That's true. Because the first one gave
[1:45:16] them a lesson.
[1:45:19] Amen. So it took something away from
[1:45:21] them. So when they are not careful, they
[1:45:23] easily jump into another one. So it's
[1:45:26] two ways. They either easily jump into
[1:45:28] another one or now they don't even want
[1:45:30] to go anywhere.
[1:45:34] Amen. I'm I'm just giving some
[1:45:36] illustrations of rebound effect. So when
[1:45:40] God gives us a promise
[1:45:43] Amen. and he comes to remember us, it
[1:45:48] brings a kind of rebound effect.
[1:45:51] Amen. So when he resurrects whatever he
[1:45:56] said to you, it is time for action.
[1:46:01] So when the Holy Ghost comes and says,
[1:46:04] "Remember I told you that I am the Lord
[1:46:07] that healed your diseases." Glory to
[1:46:10] God. He's trying to remember you
[1:46:12] something. Amen. And the moment you hear
[1:46:15] that, you put on a sort of strength.
[1:46:20] So sometimes we can be going through
[1:46:22] situations and and sometimes we we end
[1:46:25] up forgetting what the promises of God
[1:46:27] were. Then all of a sudden the
[1:46:31] remembrance come to you. What happens to
[1:46:33] you? You begin to fight. Your muscles
[1:46:37] begin to grow. Amen. It is a rebound.
[1:46:40] Amen. To fight that enemy.
[1:46:44] Amen. That's a spirit of remembrance.
[1:46:50] Amen. Now
[1:46:53] remembrance has an element of time.
[1:46:57] It is time specific. Amen. When somebody
[1:47:01] gives a
[1:47:03] promise before you can talk about
[1:47:05] remembrance, Amen. you must have an
[1:47:09] agreement first, like a beginning,
[1:47:12] right? Before you now come and have
[1:47:15] remembrance. So there's a time that
[1:47:19] elapsed between when the promise was
[1:47:22] made and the time of remembrance.
[1:47:26] Amen. Let's read Exodus
[1:47:29] 2
[1:47:31] 23 25.
[1:47:35] Exodus
[1:47:47] 2, Exodus 23:25.
[1:47:52] He said, "And it came to pass in process
[1:47:54] of
[1:47:55] time that the king of Egypt died, and
[1:47:59] the children of Israel sighed by reason
[1:48:02] of the bondage, and they cried, and
[1:48:05] their cry came up unto God by reason of
[1:48:08] the bondage." And God heard their
[1:48:10] groaning, and God remembered his
[1:48:14] covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and
[1:48:17] with Jacob.
[1:48:18] So the Bible said in the process of
[1:48:22] time.
[1:48:24] Amen. So God gave a promise to Abraham
[1:48:28] to
[1:48:29] Isaac. But then when the time came, he
[1:48:32] said, "I remembered."
[1:48:35] Amen. So remembrance is connected to
[1:48:37] time. Amen. So I can't promise you today
[1:48:41] and say I'm remembering you because it's
[1:48:45] still fresh. Amen. I am not resurrecting
[1:48:48] a memory. Amen. So it it's so as as I
[1:48:52] said it's connected to time and
[1:48:56] remembrance act as a reserve resource
[1:49:00] like a reserve tank.
[1:49:03] So like we have a book of remembrance.
[1:49:05] Whatever um the saints were doing or
[1:49:08] whatever they were doing the house of
[1:49:09] God Bible says that it was written in
[1:49:12] the book of remembrance. So it was
[1:49:15] stored there for them when the time
[1:49:18] came. Amen. It got resurrected.
[1:49:23] Amen. So remembrance is a store for us.
[1:49:29] So when God is talking to the bride,
[1:49:32] Amen. Bible says
[1:49:35] that God is willing to save the whole
[1:49:38] earth, the whole world. He's willing to
[1:49:41] save everybody. But say but by
[1:49:43] fornowledge.
[1:49:45] Amen. Now forn knowledge is something
[1:49:48] that was already done down like he had
[1:49:51] it in the past but by
[1:49:53] fornowledge he can't save
[1:49:56] everybody. He he will only save those
[1:49:59] who were predestinated.
[1:50:02] Amen. So something had been reserved
[1:50:04] down for the bride. That is why the
[1:50:07] bride has that attribute of patience.
[1:50:12] To have a reserve tank. Amen. No matter
[1:50:16] the condition, we can be able to
[1:50:18] withstand anything.
[1:50:21] Amen. Now, remembrance is energetic.
[1:50:27] Energetic.
[1:50:30] That's exactly right. Amen. Amen.
[1:50:34] Remembrance is energetic.
[1:50:36] When let's say you've talked about
[1:50:38] something for a long time
[1:50:42] and somebody comes to remember you
[1:50:46] I don't think the spirit in you is just
[1:50:48] going to be quiet.
[1:50:50] There's going to be an excitement.
[1:50:54] Amen.
[1:50:55] So when the Holy Ghost is coming with a
[1:50:58] spirit of remembrance, the church is not
[1:51:01] supposed to be a quiet church.
[1:51:05] Because when he's coming to remember
[1:51:07] you, the promises he gave to you that is
[1:51:10] stimulating something in you. Amen.
[1:51:14] [Applause]
[1:51:16] Now from the message, the arrow of God's
[1:51:19] deliverance shot from a bow. I just love
[1:51:21] this. The arrow of God's deliverance
[1:51:25] shot from a bow.
[1:51:28] Amen. He said, "Why?" The reason Moses
[1:51:32] failed in the first place, guess what
[1:51:34] was the matter? It was the lack of
[1:51:37] having what the burning bush had. That's
[1:51:40] right. And what's our failure today is
[1:51:43] lack having what the Holy Spirit has. He
[1:51:47] said, "And the Holy Spirit has all good
[1:51:50] things for us. And if we receive the
[1:51:54] Holy Spirit, then all things are
[1:51:56] possible
[1:51:58] and not only possible but promised to
[1:52:02] us.
[1:52:03] [Applause]
[1:52:04] So the prophet is saying that everything
[1:52:07] that is possible was promised to us.
[1:52:12] Amen. He said we are not just saying
[1:52:15] things are possible but he said
[1:52:17] everything that is possible was promised
[1:52:20] to us. Amen. Amen. He said Jesus said,
[1:52:24] "Ask the father anything in my name, I
[1:52:27] will do it. If you abide in me and my
[1:52:29] words in you, ask what you will, it will
[1:52:32] be given to you." See, when we step into
[1:52:36] the light of God's word with the
[1:52:38] uncction of the Holy Spirit to shine the
[1:52:41] light on it, brother, the
[1:52:44] impossible becomes little things then.
[1:52:48] Amen. So it means to us the impossible
[1:52:52] are supposed to be little things. The
[1:52:55] prophet said that is the promise to us.
[1:52:58] He said God asked us to believe his
[1:53:00] word. He sends the Holy Spirit to
[1:53:03] energize
[1:53:06] that word when he falls into it. So when
[1:53:10] he's coming as a spirit of remembrance,
[1:53:13] he's coming to energize the word.
[1:53:17] So the Holy Ghost is energetic.
[1:53:21] The Holy Ghost is an energy that comes
[1:53:24] to us to resurrect the promise that he
[1:53:27] gave to us.
[1:53:29] Amen. He said when the word's been
[1:53:31] preached and the Holy Spirit brings the
[1:53:33] word, he energizes that and flashes the
[1:53:37] same light of God's blessed promise. God
[1:53:40] said, "I have remembered my promise to
[1:53:42] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and I'm
[1:53:45] sending you down there to do it." See,
[1:53:48] when God's word, his promise becomes
[1:53:51] enlightened by the presence of the angel
[1:53:53] of the Lord. Amen.
[1:53:57] Now, in this message and Exodus,
[1:54:01] Amen. The the prophet said, "Notice
[1:54:04] said, Moses, I've seen the suffering of
[1:54:07] my people. I've remembered my promise.
[1:54:09] Amen. The person said, I love that God
[1:54:13] always remembers every promise he made.
[1:54:19] God always
[1:54:21] remembers every promise he made. Not
[1:54:25] some promises,
[1:54:27] but every promise. So the prophet said
[1:54:30] that the impossible was promised to us.
[1:54:34] So God remembers the impossible.
[1:54:38] Amen. God remembers the impossible
[1:54:42] because he promised that to the bride.
[1:54:45] So it means that once we are moving our
[1:54:49] memory is supposed to be remembering the
[1:54:52] impossible things.
[1:54:55] [Applause]
[1:54:56] Amen.
[1:55:00] Amen.
[1:55:02] I want to read this message conference.
[1:55:06] It said then when we find out that after
[1:55:09] 400 years of bondage and the Egyptians
[1:55:12] rose up there and there was a pharaoh
[1:55:14] that did not know Joseph and finally
[1:55:17] come to a place they were made to serve
[1:55:19] with rigor. How the Egyptians made
[1:55:21] slaves out of them and beat them and
[1:55:24] drove them like cattle. God ordained a
[1:55:27] prophet to rise up. That prophet ran
[1:55:30] away, married a beautiful Ethiopian girl
[1:55:33] and had a son Gersham and was well
[1:55:35] satisfied to inherit a lot of money. I
[1:55:38] mean he he was living a good life and
[1:55:40] all that. Amen.
[1:55:43] Beautiful lady, a son. He was he was
[1:55:46] ready to kind of inherit the riches of
[1:55:50] Jethro. Amen.
[1:55:52] But Bible said God remembered. Amen.
[1:55:55] Amen.
[1:55:58] So God remembered. Amen. Amen. So
[1:56:01] sometimes we can just be going through
[1:56:03] our um very good time. Everything is all
[1:56:07] right. Everything is going good for us.
[1:56:10] Everything the job is going good. I mean
[1:56:13] the money is coming and everything. But
[1:56:16] then sometimes God remembers a promise.
[1:56:20] Glory to God.
[1:56:22] So when God remembers a promise, it's
[1:56:24] time for action.
[1:56:26] Amen.
[1:56:29] He said, "I'm so glad he remembers. He
[1:56:31] remembered his covenant. He remembered
[1:56:33] Eden. He remembered Abraham. He
[1:56:35] remembers every word that he ever
[1:56:37] promised. Everything that he ever said,
[1:56:41] he's the infinite God. He remembered it
[1:56:44] all. And he remembered he's made the
[1:56:47] promise." He said there's only one thing
[1:56:49] for God to do that's keep his word. And
[1:56:53] to keep his word, he had ordained a
[1:56:55] prophet.
[1:56:57] So when you are seeing a prophet, Amen.
[1:57:00] It means God is keeping his word.
[1:57:05] Amen. Amen. Now there there's this um
[1:57:10] time where God wanted to destroy his own
[1:57:14] people because they were sinning, right?
[1:57:18] Now there stood a prophet
[1:57:22] called Moses.
[1:57:24] Amen. And he said that when you destroy
[1:57:27] these people, what do um the enemy say
[1:57:31] that he just took them out to come and
[1:57:33] destroy them.
[1:57:36] So sometimes we have the power to
[1:57:41] remember God. Come on, brother.
[1:57:45] Sometimes we go to God, brother. And
[1:57:48] remember him, brother. So, it's not just
[1:57:50] God remembering, but he's also giving us
[1:57:53] that power to remember.
[1:57:56] Amen. The same thing with Hezekiah.
[1:57:59] When he was told that he was going to
[1:58:01] die, he went back to pray and said,
[1:58:04] "Lord, I have done this. I have done
[1:58:06] that. I have done this." Amen. So now
[1:58:10] let's read this in the part's vision. So
[1:58:14] now we see two omnipotent
[1:58:18] talking.
[1:58:21] So in the message department the part's
[1:58:22] vision he said amen cut every obstacle
[1:58:26] from human beings that they might be
[1:58:28] connected like in the garden of Eden.
[1:58:30] Now men I was going to choke it but I'm
[1:58:34] going to say it. Man is omally
[1:58:37] important.
[1:58:40] [Applause]
[1:58:42] So when man comes in prayer and stands
[1:58:45] before God, it is an omnipotent that is
[1:58:49] talking when that man is in the word of
[1:58:52] God bringing God to remembrance his own
[1:58:56] word.
[1:58:57] Amen. Amen. He said you don't believe
[1:59:00] that. He said but he is. A man fully
[1:59:05] surrendered to God is omnipotent.
[1:59:08] Did not he say in Mark 11:22,
[1:59:11] "Whatsoever things you say and don't
[1:59:13] doubt in your heart, it will come to
[1:59:16] pass, you can have what you have said."
[1:59:19] He said, "What happens when two
[1:59:21] omnipotent meet?"
[1:59:24] When God and man comes together, two
[1:59:28] omnipotent, something's got to shake.
[1:59:31] Amen.
[1:59:34] Whatsoever you say with that creative
[1:59:36] power of omnipotence of God, knowing
[1:59:39] that he's promised it and he said it is
[1:59:43] in his word, it creates a power that
[1:59:46] goes out yonder and bring things to
[1:59:49] pass,
[1:59:51] things that is not. It makes them as
[1:59:55] though they are because two omnipotent
[1:59:58] have met. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:00:02] Amen. Now, in closing,
[2:00:07] Amen. This I didn't put up
[2:00:10] there from the message, and thy seed
[2:00:13] shall possess the gate of his enemies.
[2:00:15] He
[2:00:16] said, "Let's be hundfold." The prophet
[2:00:20] is saying that, "Let us be a hundfold."
[2:00:24] Cuz remember in in in in that parable,
[2:00:28] right, the last category, okay, that had
[2:00:31] the fetter ground, we had three folds,
[2:00:35] the 100fold, the 60fold, and the 30fold.
[2:00:39] The prophet doesn't care about 60 and
[2:00:41] 30.
[2:00:43] The prophet want us to get everything.
[2:00:47] So don't say because the Lord has healed
[2:00:50] me, it is enough.
[2:00:53] Don't say because the Lord has provided
[2:00:55] me a new car, it is enough. No. Don't
[2:00:59] say because the Lord has given me a new
[2:01:01] house, it is enough.
[2:01:05] Every promise the prophet said, "Let us
[2:01:08] be the hundfold."
[2:01:11] He said, "Let's go way over.
[2:01:15] Sell out everything from the world and
[2:01:18] look to Christ and believe him with all
[2:01:21] of our hearts." That's how these things
[2:01:24] happen. That's how visions come. That's
[2:01:26] how power to God of God moves amongst us
[2:01:30] is when we are no roots of bitterness
[2:01:32] and everything is cleaned out and the
[2:01:34] Holy Spirit can work through us. Then we
[2:01:38] become channel That's it. That's it.
[2:01:41] Amen. Amen. So he said, "And may this in
[2:01:44] blind body males." Amen. He said, "And
[2:01:47] may God bring it back to you multiply."
[2:01:52] Hipped up, run down, shaken down a
[2:01:56] hundfold is my prayer. God bless you.
[2:02:02] [Applause]
[2:02:08] Amen. Amen. Amen. So the promise to us
[2:02:13] is that the hundfold is ours. It's not
[2:02:18] just something that is
[2:02:20] impossible. It is a promise. Amen. And
[2:02:24] everything that is impossible, the
[2:02:25] prophet is saying that we are
[2:02:27] omnipotent.
[2:02:29] Whatever we come to God in prayer, as
[2:02:32] long as it's a promise of God to us,
[2:02:36] amen, it is possible and it is promised
[2:02:39] to us. Amen. So, invite brother Steven.
[2:02:42] Amen. To continue with the service.
[2:02:44] Amen. Tonight. Amen.
[2:02:54] Amen.
[2:02:56] Praise God. Amen. Praise God. Amen. The
[2:03:01] power of remembrance.
[2:03:03] Amen. Very simple but deep.
[2:03:08] God break it. So simple but deep. Amen.
[2:03:12] God bringing his own word in remembrance
[2:03:16] into you. That's what it is. Amen. Amen.
[2:03:20] You read the scripture today. You don't
[2:03:22] understand why you're reading it. You
[2:03:24] don't see the purpose of reading that
[2:03:25] scripture. You don't understand why
[2:03:27] you're reading that that scripture.
[2:03:29] Brother Steven keep telling you every
[2:03:31] Sunday listen to the word listen to the
[2:03:34] message. You listen to the message it
[2:03:36] looks like what you are reading is going
[2:03:38] down. It looks like you don't even
[2:03:40] remember some of them. You catch up and
[2:03:42] you find yourself asleep. But until a
[2:03:45] trouble come,
[2:03:48] then
[2:03:50] somehow then
[2:03:52] somehow you will feel something coming
[2:03:55] up like I don't really know which
[2:03:57] message but I remember brother Brown.
[2:03:59] I'm saying this.
[2:04:02] That is not you remembering. That is the
[2:04:05] Holy Spirit bringing to remembrance. the
[2:04:09] thing that he already spoke to you.
[2:04:13] Are we together? Why didn't the spirit
[2:04:16] remind you all of this all along until
[2:04:19] something happened? That's why brother
[2:04:21] Brandham say again, whatever the lord
[2:04:26] lead your soul to believe that is yours.
[2:04:31] Amen. Amen. Amen. We got spoiled by
[2:04:34] movies
[2:04:36] because in movies God have a deep voice.
[2:04:41] Abraham.
[2:04:42] Abraham. So when you ask somebody in
[2:04:45] this message, have God ever speak to
[2:04:46] you? Try that. You will hear them.
[2:04:51] I know God speak. No, no, no, no, no,
[2:04:53] no. Have God ever speak to you? What
[2:04:57] actually they asking you? Have you ever
[2:05:00] heard Abraham?
[2:05:02] Abraham lmon lmon that's what they
[2:05:05] asking you God speak many ways
[2:05:11] when you asking me does God have already
[2:05:13] spoke to you what do you think what do
[2:05:16] you have in mind because God may speak
[2:05:18] on a billboard
[2:05:24] God spoke on a pack of
[2:05:26] [Applause]
[2:05:30] cigarette sir
[2:05:32] You have a problem. I put the quote.
[2:05:35] A whole sermon was preached from a pack
[2:05:38] of cigarette. And God ordained that pack
[2:05:42] of cigarette to be there so that brother
[2:05:45] Brandham can draw the the the very
[2:05:48] tallel.
[2:05:51] It's shaking you. Is he shaking you? God
[2:05:55] brought a larger food from a crew.
[2:05:59] An unclean bird. That's right.
[2:06:04] Are we together? That's why brother
[2:06:05] Brandham say if you have God inside, you
[2:06:08] will see God everywhere.
[2:06:10] [Applause]
[2:06:12] Amen. So read the word. So you know the
[2:06:16] promise of God. Listen to the tape.
[2:06:18] Listen to the message. Read the message
[2:06:21] so you know God promised for you.
[2:06:23] Because we already realized that the
[2:06:25] message is not a message of a man. It
[2:06:28] was God speaking through us using a
[2:06:31] prophet. So what was spoken in the
[2:06:33] message is the word of God. So whenever
[2:06:35] you hear something going on, God knows
[2:06:38] why. Why should I read a story about
[2:06:41] John Shar?
[2:06:44] It might be nothing for you. Come on,
[2:06:46] brother. Yes, sir. But when I was
[2:06:48] reading about John Shar, something in me
[2:06:52] begin to fight like, hey, hey, let me
[2:06:55] have John Shar. Amen. Maybe for you it's
[2:06:59] a story but for me it bring a scratch in
[2:07:01] my heart in my soul something is
[2:07:04] scratching because whenever I'm going to
[2:07:06] go through trial
[2:07:10] I will remember John Shared
[2:07:13] the power of remembrance is what gave
[2:07:16] David energy
[2:07:19] to destroy Goliath. He remembered what
[2:07:22] God did with the lion and what God did
[2:07:25] with the bear. God have done so many
[2:07:28] things. So you got promises in the
[2:07:31] Bible. You got promises in the message
[2:07:34] and your own life have already wrote a
[2:07:37] book, a
[2:07:40] Bible. Amen. So you can say I remember
[2:07:44] going through allergies before and God
[2:07:47] delivered me out of allergies. If God
[2:07:50] deliver me out of allergy in 2022, I
[2:07:53] believe that the same God will do it
[2:07:55] today. Who is bringing you that
[2:07:57] experience back?
[2:07:59] Amen. Do you think the devil will bring
[2:08:02] you something that will deliver you? No,
[2:08:04] sir. The devil want to bring you Do you
[2:08:06] know that the devil also have a power of
[2:08:08] remembrance? I don't know. This just
[2:08:10] dropped. Yes, sir. Do you know that?
[2:08:12] Yes, sir. Oh, have I said something
[2:08:14] wrong? The devil have also a power of
[2:08:17] remembrance. And he's very good at that.
[2:08:22] And he's very good in detail.
[2:08:27] Are we together? You will see some
[2:08:29] people that are anointed by the devil.
[2:08:32] They remember your fault in detail.
[2:08:37] And every time you want to rise up, they
[2:08:39] want to beat you down with it. Not you.
[2:08:41] You remember what you did in 2027.
[2:08:44] That's the devil remembering. You also
[2:08:46] need to remember that person in faith
[2:08:50] that do you remember Calvary? Do you
[2:08:53] remember the blood of Calvary? Do you
[2:08:55] remember what Calvary did for me?
[2:08:57] Calvary took it all out and wipe
[2:09:00] everything for me and I am justified
[2:09:04] like I have never done it to begin with.
[2:09:10] Yes sir. Glory to God. When the when the
[2:09:12] devil bring into remembrance those
[2:09:14] depression, those disappointment, those
[2:09:16] things in life, God will also send a
[2:09:20] surge of the spirit of the Lord to give
[2:09:23] you power and energy to remember that I
[2:09:26] am the Lord.
[2:09:28] I am the one in the midst of you. Are we
[2:09:31] together? I am the one. Though you walk
[2:09:33] through the valley of the sha, though
[2:09:34] you going through
[2:09:36] persecution, remember it's a hundfold,
[2:09:39] you will bring fruit. Fruit come with
[2:09:42] patience because fruit come in their own
[2:09:45] season. That's why the virtue of
[2:09:48] patience is given to you to tar. Though
[2:09:50] the promise take time, wait, wait.
[2:09:54] Because wait that waiting is going with
[2:09:57] patience because your promise will come
[2:09:59] to fruition. Whatever God spoke will
[2:10:02] happen. The impossible is little things.
[2:10:06] Yes, sir. Amen. Amen. If somebody tell
[2:10:09] you something that is impossible, don't
[2:10:11] stand in their way. If you don't have
[2:10:13] enough faith, just say I believe it and
[2:10:15] move on.
[2:10:17] Amen. If somebody tells me God can
[2:10:20] create a new tooth, I say amen.
[2:10:23] Because God is a creator. I just say
[2:10:25] amen. Am I not experienced that? But I'm
[2:10:28] not going to say no because God can do
[2:10:30] anything. Are we together? Whatever God
[2:10:33] put in his word, we say amen to it.
[2:10:38] You can believe for your brother. You
[2:10:41] can believe for your wife. You can
[2:10:43] believe. It was the faith of Abraham
[2:10:45] that touched Sarah over there. Sarah
[2:10:47] doubted the promise and produced
[2:10:49] Ishmael. But Abraham was going every day
[2:10:52] getting stronger and stronger in the
[2:10:55] promises of God and God brought it to
[2:10:57] pass. Two omnipotent are speaking. God
[2:11:02] and God are talking. Two omnipotent.
[2:11:04] When we say omnipotent of God, we
[2:11:06] believe it. When we say you are
[2:11:08] omnipotent, then we start scratching our
[2:11:10] head because the devil is now reminding
[2:11:12] you how human you are. But God have
[2:11:16] spoken to you four five month about how
[2:11:19] divine you are. So it's time to also
[2:11:22] remind the devil every day that remember
[2:11:25] God is leaving the house. God is going
[2:11:27] to work. Yes sir.
[2:11:30] Do you know that God worked?
[2:11:33] Jesus was working in the carpenter. The
[2:11:36] Bible call him a carpenter. That was his
[2:11:39] job. That's right. So what is the
[2:11:41] problem if I go to work? God work. Jesus
[2:11:44] work you come he's the god in human
[2:11:46] flesh the fullness of the god had badly
[2:11:50] he was going there
[2:11:53] that was the creator of heaven and earth
[2:11:58] that's why they say you a man calling
[2:11:59] yourself god you who work over there
[2:12:02] calling yourself god man let's stone you
[2:12:06] in this message we are ready for the
[2:12:08] stone my friend but we will stand for
[2:12:11] our position you our God.
[2:12:16] Amen. The power of remembrance. Let's
[2:12:19] stand. Glory to God. Wonderful, my
[2:12:23] brother.
[2:12:24] Amen. Glory to God. Let's pray. Heavenly
[2:12:28] Father, Lord, we are approaching you
[2:12:30] again humbly tonight. Father we thank
[2:12:33] you for your grace, for your love and
[2:12:36] your mercy and for everything that you
[2:12:39] have been doing for us and in this
[2:12:41] church speaking to us about the valley
[2:12:44] of
[2:12:45] persecution, the valley of trial, the
[2:12:47] valley of
[2:12:48] suffering. Many time our attention goes
[2:12:52] to the suffering but tonight you spoke
[2:12:55] to us that in that valley there are
[2:12:58] rivers of water. In that valley, Father,
[2:13:01] it's a fertile ground. That is exactly
[2:13:04] where the seed will grow, Father, when
[2:13:07] going through this difficult time, Lord.
[2:13:09] Father, all of that is working together
[2:13:11] for good for us, Lord. Father, we thank
[2:13:14] you for the Holy Spirit, Lord. Father,
[2:13:17] you laid the ground of the Holy Spirit
[2:13:19] on Sunday, and you insisted so much. And
[2:13:23] here come the brother do telling
[2:13:25] straight ahead in that same line not
[2:13:27] even knowing what will be preached on
[2:13:29] Sunday. And father you connected
[2:13:32] everything together. Lord we thank you
[2:13:35] for being in the midst of us. We thank
[2:13:37] you for being the teacher at the pulpit
[2:13:39] and the teacher in the heart Lord to
[2:13:42] interpret your word so that we can
[2:13:43] understand it and know exactly what you
[2:13:46] want us to do Lord. Father, may you let
[2:13:49] no one be under the distraction, Lord,
[2:13:51] but may we focus in the remembrance of
[2:13:54] the Holy Spirit, Lord. And may we be,
[2:13:56] Lord, Father, so attentive to the spirit
[2:13:59] to be able to catch it quickly to work
[2:14:02] on that possession when you bring things
[2:14:04] back to our remembrance because you
[2:14:06] wanted to manifest something to us,
[2:14:08] Lord. Father, we thank you because that
[2:14:11] power was given to men that man can also
[2:14:14] remind you, Lord. Oh God, just like
[2:14:17] Moses could talk to you. Just like you
[2:14:20] could talk to him face to face, Lord.
[2:14:22] Father, you talk to a man face to face
[2:14:25] before the blood of Calvary. And the
[2:14:27] blood of Calvary came, Lord, to redeem
[2:14:29] man in order, Lord, Father, that God
[2:14:32] deity may dwell in man, Lord. That's why
[2:14:36] Luke 17:30 could not be fulfilled to the
[2:14:38] Gentile because the blood of Calvary was
[2:14:41] not shed yet, Lord. But because the
[2:14:43] blood was shed, now it's possible for
[2:14:47] God to inhabit it and to dwell in you,
[2:14:50] God, to speak to come in us and speak
[2:14:52] through us, Lord. Father, Lord, may you
[2:14:55] bless this church and may you bless the
[2:14:56] invisible audience as well. And may you
[2:14:59] keep us safe and we commit the
[2:15:00] appreciation dinner and the remaining of
[2:15:03] the week unto the hand. May your blood
[2:15:05] continue to protect us, Father. May you
[2:15:07] give us travel mercy as we go into our
[2:15:10] respective place and bless our soul
[2:15:12] abundantly and strengthen your men's
[2:15:14] servant Lord Father tonight in Jesus
[2:15:17] precious name. Hallelujah.
[2:15:20] Go
[2:15:23] ahead
[2:15:30] John. Amen.
[2:15:32] [Music]
[2:15:40] [Music]
[2:15:50] I love you, Lord.
[2:15:56] For your mercy never fails me.
[2:16:02] All on my days,
[2:16:05] I've been held in your hands.
[2:16:11] From the moment that I wake
[2:16:15] up until I lay my head,

[2:16:59] We're going to finish the song if you'd
[2:17:01] like to stay and sing it with us. Amen.
[2:17:05] I love your voice.
[2:17:10] You have led me through the fire.
[2:17:16] In darkest night,
[2:17:19] you are close like no other.
