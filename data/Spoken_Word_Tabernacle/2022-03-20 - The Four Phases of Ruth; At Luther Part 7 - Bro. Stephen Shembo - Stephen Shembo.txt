know the sermon you preach on this one i say i preach it on a hotel he said i listen to all of them so if you are lagging behind that's your problem that's between you and the lord amen somebody is reading the cod book and the church edge is blessed be the name of the lord we thank god for the wonderful sister young sisters meeting that we have yesterday you heard them so it's telling you what happened such a wonderful atmosphere you don't want to go anywhere and they even ask for an overtime i have to go one question more than what we were where we were supposed to stop but sister fanny up in the room she said go ahead for one more so everything worked out pretty good amen blessed be the name of the lord so they're getting really really good and i don't know what to do with you young man these sisters are getting loaded pretty good amen they're getting loaded pretty pretty good make sure you know what you're doing before you ask for one amen if not they would nail you on the scripture brother branham say the bible say by the problem say the bible say so make sure you work on your spiritual life very good and whoever is listening online who want to come to this church looking for a sister make sure you know what you're doing amen put your head in the word amen blessed be the name of the lord so now since we're preparing you for your oncoming future i told brother robert this morning that lord's willing all of you need to get together and make a group of four four sisters in rotation so every time we have a young sister's meeting now four of you need to be there at 12 o'clock to set up so it's time for you to start taking charges of stuff amen i have the young men working on the camera there bro the david is on the side by the caliph open the chair so now i need to get the sisters get moving and let the older one begin to relax a little bit amen so make sure you cannot be late every time that's not going to work everybody care so once in a while four of you 12 o'clock you're there you start setting up everything and before we leave before you even pack one thing make sure you clean up everything not one person all the sister cleaning up everything when you clean up everything then you can pack your food and you can go amen so no packing until we clean up and if four does it the next time the other four need to do it the other time and the other one relax amen so if you know you're coming late to make sure one of the days you're going to be on time so let's begin to release the little older sister and give them some break they raise you up they were changing your diapers and cooking and all kind of stuff it's time for them to start relaxing a little bit you start picking up and you're making way for the younger generation because we have the 11 years old that are growing up and now you're going to be their guide and help them up amen so when we have a big fellowship or house meeting i'm expecting young sisters to be there and working amen oh my god i didn't hear those amen okay i will remind you i will say amen brother stephen preacher blessed be the name of the lord remember the building fund this morning so they told me to remind you john just asked me to remind you he put a note here so remember the building found this morning and our next house meeting will be on april 9th we were not able to finish the question on the young sisters meeting it's a lot of question you touched seven only it takes like three hours so you know what we're getting into it people you open one scripture after the next and the good thing i like about them they're bringing their bible and they're taking note they don't know everything like the boys do and before you know it you're the one causing trouble at home and the sister will be the one praying amen blessed be the name of the lord somebody gave me a quote and i'm gonna read it he didn't want me to mention his name but i love this quote brother branham said you know i wish we had we just had now until about march or april that's january so brother branham was looking for three or four months he said i wish we just had now until about march or april just to put a great big canvas across the back here and just come down in daytime and draw out those pictures and the whole chart and just raise them up and down like window shades you know like i've always dreamed sometime brother branno sorry didn't happen on your tongue it happened on my time when i can flip this board up and down brother branham say i have always dreamed sometime of having a great big tabernacle somewhere where i could reach down and pull this truck down come all the way across the platform and revelations and the interpretations the lord has given me and take a pointer and start through there and bring these edges down then when we get through with that raise down one up pull the other one down like this and start on that and do what this day this court have been fulfilled [Applause] amen this day this court has been fulfilled he said oh that would be just like a load of heaven that's why we will forget time in this building wouldn't it just sit the complete winter through just sit out with the i'm sorry but don't mess around with my body because i got a coat where i'm gonna mail you let's go to her back don't come again and say he always write on the board i usually keep those bullets for the legalists [Laughter] blessed be the name of the lord my god it feels so good here i was in my office can't come out and join you on the singing i can feel the brother mike going and moving and moving i say i'm stuck right here i cannot get into that amen those who have difficulty funding habakkuk you go to the prophets because somebody will be flipping pages 10 minutes that's why you need to read your bible go to daniel after daniel you're going to find jose elmo's and under all there you're going to find that bacca if you're there you can say a man okay habakkuk chapter 2 verse 4 the bible say behold his soul which is lift up the arrogant the proud one is not upright in him but they just shall live by is it complicated very easy they just shall live by faith let's go to matthew 25 as you get in your seat in habakkuk the just shall live by faith from the old testament matthew 25 hallelujah matthew 25 verse 14. if you're there you can say amen it's amazing have somebody coming from far off getting on time in church so you fill in the blank somebody driving from far off get on time in church fill in the blank if i feel it you'll be screaming get the church in time you heard it if you're there you can say amen for the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country who called his own servants and delivered to them his goods everybody okay and to the one he gave five talent one how many servants want to put three here the first one he gave him five talent everybody here then to another two everybody two talent and the other one why did he give them different numbers why not giving them all five talent or two talent or one talent verse 15 and to one he gave five talent to another two and to another one to every man according to his several that word several means owner according to his own ability everybody so when the master was looking at his servant he found indoor servant certain potential certain ability everybody care and potential everybody here and based on your ability or based on your potential the master give you his goods he entrusted you with something as a steward everybody here you must say no why am i getting one and he got five he knows why he gave you one and he gave another one father amen when he gives you five you need to understand his language if he gives you a certain husband anybody here he knows why what he's doing [Laughter] and immediately took his journey so he has confidence in those people if he didn't have confidence why is he going to take his good and entrust it to somebody knowing that they're going to spend it it's up to the one who received to understand that if the boss is giving me this he have confidence in me everybody care praise be the name of the lord verse 16 then he that received the five talent went and traded with the same and made them other how many so the one who had five talent when he put himself into work anybody care he has a 100 percent return everybody care about here and that 100 to return gave him five talent anybody here and it looks like after he gained five talent the potential stuck let's continue let's go to verse 17. and likewise he that received two ever care he also gained at the water oh my god so the two have a hundred percent also returned when it comes it comes back to two everybody here it looks like whatever the boss put in he always it's already have a threshold or a plateau anybody here in other words you cannot go beyond your ability anybody here if you still if they give you five talent and you have one you are still having time to work everybody here everybody here if you have two your age is still working if you have three the age the grace is still open if you have four your grace is open once you reach five you cannot go anymore and the one who have two once you reach two that say the one who have two cannot have five amen amen am i reading a different bible so if you go to the one that have two and try to pull five you will never get a five because his ability is only two you can pray all you want okay you can fast all you want two will remain two if two is one when you're praying you're doing good once to reach two plateau in other words somebody's moving like this then they're remaining until he's gone no more hallelujah verse 18 but he that has won and dug in the earth so if he had one automatically he he was given the potential to multiply and bring another one he just didn't know he got so caught up it's a lot of work amen they cannot give you more than you can be it's not work for you it's going to work be work for somebody else not you anybody here dug in the earth and heed the lord's water so these talents are money everybody here and money brother branham say it's a purchase power everyone here you remember which brother ranam say was symbolizing faith here so does faith have limitation you need a prophet to decode anybody care when it starts it's good when you reach each plateau it's not going to go any further than that somebody else need to pick up with a different number let's go to luke chapter 12. oh my god this message when you preach it you have a different language it's like yesterday you pulled a scripture and the sister said wow i didn't know this was in the bible it was right here it's the message of the hour luke 12 verse 48. if you dare you can say amen oh my god but he that knew not and then commit things worthy of straps shall be beaten with few straps everybody here you didn't know so they're going to correct you according to your level of knowledge for to whomsoever much is given everybody care of him shall be much what if they give you five the boss is expecting five the return of the boss at the end you must be five if they give you two the boss is expecting two if they give you one he's expecting one everybody here and of him shall my it shall be much required and to whom men have committed much of him they will ask them all anybody care so this return that the boss is waiting depends on the input that the boss gave you anybody care there is a reason why the boss is giving you five when he gives you five means your abilities fav everybody clear let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again father for your grace for your love for your mercy and for giving us another opportunity to be here standing before the precious pressures of the blood of jesus christ father we have done what any man that you give in an ability and the grace to read the word can do lord but when he comes to interpret the scripture and to unveil it to your children it's only the supernatural act of the holy spirit lord may you forgive your children for everything that they have done that could be a hindrance lord father for the service and their blessing lord we thank you for your presence this morning may you move us completely out of the way may you come and speak to your children may you shake those that the devil has been battling so much with them putting them to sleep every day when the world is going on father remove that demonic evil spirit from their life and may they stay awake and focus as we commit it all unto the hand and humbly humbly ask it lord in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you everybody ready all right the bible says in the book of hebrew chapter 10 now the just shall live by faith but if any man draws back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them that drove back unto perdition so going back like oppa you go into perdition but of them that believe to the water so we're going all the way everybody here when you started is the alpha and the omega anybody here there is no way you can get in the plane of alpha without reaching omega you're in a different plane amen now we're on part seven the four phases of roof at luther so we're going to talk about martin luther why martin luther brother branham says this just a reminder he said god has made it so wonderful that in the old testament he god where usually i go to for refuge for a text once in a while he's made the old testament in parables and in symbolic forms to express himself and his doings that the simple-minded might be able to have the conception of his will and what he is doing amen so god make it so plain so that everybody can see what is going on brother branham said that in the old testament now not the old testament everything now we're narrowing that down he said in the old testament being a top of the new and the work of the inward courts plural there is three courts we have the other court we have the holy place and we have the holiest anybody care the works of the inward courts of the tabernacle was a beautiful picture of god's plans of water now you begin to see that clearly now everybody here it was a beautiful picture of god's plans of salvation for his mankind today but here and if we can only learn by this now and how to get ourselves in the condition to receive what god has in store for us in that tabernacle it shall just sweep the whole valley here but don't you think it's better to always know how and what you're coming for you get to know the way of approach to anything that has been said we found out that in the tabernacle the plan of salvation has been unfolded to us now we know that the other court is justification the holy place is sanctification and the baptism of the holy spirit is the holiest everybody clear this is a tabernacle language or a tabernacle a priesthood language and but here if you look at first you don't understand what it means but when we begin to go on the detail we begin to see that the other court was speaking about repentance and water baptism then the holy place shall and then you have the gift of the holy spirit in the most holiest everybody clear when we took the tabernacle and converted into the story of roof you remember the conversion the conversion told us that roof was deciding in the other court roof was serving in the holy place and roof was resting in the most holy place everybody so everybody in this life have to fulfill the tabernacle because the tabernacle is the plan of redemption of god but here once you start in the tabernacle here you must repent you must be baptized and then you must be filled with the holy spirit and once you are filled with the holy spirit automatically your work is completed then your next step is adoption everybody here and that abduction will bring you to the change of the body which is the second banquet of esther why is this important brother branham said devil can get to you because when you complete the tabernacle you are shielding yourself from the devil everybody here once you are on the holiest place and you are still with the holy spirit brother branham said that seal cannot be tempered anybody care they usually take the box they're going to verify the box they're going to check the box they're going to put it up and down they're going to fill it pack it that's no problem but once the box is sealed and the inspection stamp is put there nobody can mess around with that seal that seal is guaranteed all the way to destination it can only be broken at destination so when you complete the tabernacle you are bringing a protection permanently between you and the devil hallelujah brother branham said therefore can get to you he can do it he has to come through the same process [Music] everybody okay remember judah entered the other court and judah was the devil incarnated judah entered the holy place and judah was the devil incarnated but when he was down for the holiest judah could not enter the holy spirit he dropped back and he died so the only way the devil cannot get to you you must go beyond the last step of judah [Music] everybody here you must get into the whole years because over there someone is living there and that person and the devil don't get along because he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world ever here in order for the devil to get there the devil have to go through the same door he must be justified he must be sanctified and the devil must receive the holy ghost and if the devil receives the holy ghost he cannot remain the devil because receiving that holy ghost bring conversion he will change the devil and burn the snake out of him then the devil is your brother hallelujah he said he can't get to you a man he can't come through that oh but you say brother branham i received the holy ghost yeah i eat the good i eat the good things of god yeah but you are in the court out yonder that is the reason you don't hold on everybody here that's the reason this year you are doing pretty good and the next year you are back in the world so you cannot be in church today and back sleep tomorrow and claim to have the holy ghost today you are a good christian tomorrow you in a hotel with a woman you don't have the holy ghost hallelujah and this revival you are doing fine while the revival is on when the revival is gone then you are gone somewhere else and out with the water you get in the presence of god like this morning everything is god oh praise the lord i feel i believe something happened this morning you go out they put a trial down you didn't get anything everybody here you say oh i received the holy ghost i spoke with tongues i'll shudder that's all right i have nothing to say about that but why don't you why don't it hold out you cannot let the holy spirit make you speak in tongues and doesn't change you tell the holy ghost please before i speak in tongues change my life first hallelujah that is what the world is looking at that is what the people are saying if you are professing this great high calling then why aren't you living like that i'm the bride of jesus christ i'm the bride of jesus christ look at the way you're living everybody here brother branham say you all have heard me say that people say the devil made me do this poor devil you were the one who started you want to blame it on the devil anybody here no no the devil didn't do it you just was not water because when you are sailing you are protected i hope you're gonna wake up everybody here because when you are silting he is water you cannot mix the two together it's like oil and water you can take them and mix it and shake them if you leave them alone you see they're all going back up in the water going down they don't get along hallelujah he said now you went out to him he could not get into you because the only way to get into you is to come through the water the same process that you have he would have to be can you save the devil sanctify this savage justification you have not finished it and then sanctify and fill with the water you didn't receive the holy spirit when you were saved have you received the holy spirit since you believed that's the problem in the message i believe the message of the hour i'm justified sanctify with the old you're going to find yourself in a hotel everybody care you're fooling yourself up everybody here then he'll be your brother if he's sanctified filled with the holy spirit then he'll be your brother so you see he didn't do that no you just went to the borderline and come back lasting for the things of the water you never went all the way over into water into the hole yes you see across what the depth to self remember elijah and elisha justification sanctification then the cross jordan that's where the holy spirit came upon elijah not before jordan they have to cross jordan then elijah turn around and say what do you want i want your anointing the anointing cannot be given before jordan you have to be given bass jordan in the promised land ever here when elijah came back there elijah when elisha came back from there elijah was no longer there he didn't need elijah anymore he was looking for the god of elijah everybody here so far so when you enter into the holy of holies you shield yourself from the devil if not if the devil still have access on you you're still falling you're still backsliding back and forth it is a signal that you not sell yet everybody here so far we found roof now was under justification already because ruth entered through judah and then he went into the present altar and roof went all the way to the left because she say that where you die i'll die where you bury i'll be buried which is speaking about the resurrection death burial resurrection which is the word of baptism everybody here this water baptist here baptism here is essential because john the baptist taught jesus i mean jesus taught john the baptist we must fulfill all righteousness in other words normally you're not even supposed to be baptized jesus said no no no no according to the tap in the tabernacle a lamb must be washed and i'm the lamb i must fulfill the righteousness you gotta take me to some water to the level and baptize me and we found out when jesus being baptized and praying and back here automatically jesus moved to the holy place then the holy spirit picked him up and put him in the holiest and jesus received the holy spirit he started from christ first everybody brother branham said watch this stern apostle paul according to the believer in acts 19. he said but john only baptized unto repentance not for remission of sin because the sacrifice has not been killed everybody and when they heard this they were re-baptized in the name of jesus christ and the holy ghost came upon them now what did this do this is the lesson show that these people who were predestinated unto life as soon as they saw the scriptural truth they walk in the truth and receive the reward of a believer when god opens up something new to you everybody here you cannot stay in the state that you are you must quickly move from where you are and jump into what god is opening if you stay where you are you're gonna die you have to move completely into something when they talk disbeliever that you need to be re-baptized they didn't argue they got re-baptized and automatically the holy spirit came in it was another door that the lord opened and they were quick to respond and move on anybody care so far the holy ghost came upon them and they spoke in tongues prophesy and magnify god amen brother bonham said you might have left him at the baptism at the level you might have left him at the holy ghost you might have left him somewhere else we don't know whether in the outer court or holy place or whatever you give them wherever you left him don't take this her breathing church stuff there is only one to represent you this morning for salvation you don't have to be a sinner you don't have to be that you are if you are god don't hold you responsible for being a sinner everybody okay he won't hold you responsible from now on but he's going to hurt you is possible if you reject this if you were doing things before this teaching here in this church god winked on him from now on that you know the plan of redemption god won't play game with you anymore this is not something for you to learn like a head knowledge and forget [Music] to whom it's much given anybody okay they're going to ask you more at the beginning you didn't know any better god will forgive you but from now on everybody here he is not going to hurt you responsible because that may be in the past that you didn't know any different from water baptism you were not instructed before you were confused in the message this one said the baptism of the holy ghost this one said holy ghost this one says two this one says separate things everybody confused no problem from receiving the holy ghost and the power of god he might not hold you responsible for that you didn't know you might not have heard it before but from here on you know better come back to the water come back to who once god unfolds something to you you doom you have to do what he told you if you don't then you reject what is he saying amen now somebody asked me this question toward the end last sunday it was somebody who have questioned and came back so i felt like i need to put this again i was baptized at 13 shall i be baptized again according to the scripture the one who were re-baptized did not know the correct baptism of jesus christ so if you are not baptized in the name of jesus christ you must be re-baptized again if you were baptized in the name of the father son holy ghost that's wrong you must be re-baptized again but what about if i was baptized in the name of jesus christ when i was younger should that be re-baptized again now that i know the truth amen brother brother he said if you have been a christian all along since you was 13 years old a believer in christ i just remain like you are if you were baptized at 13 years old and from 13 years old now you are 18 you are living a christian life you don't have to be re-baptized everybody okay but if you were baptized at 13 years old and you start going out and sleeping with women smoking going to the nightclub and sleeping on your beginning your brazen altar was wrong you must go back again and correct things brother branham said i would not now if god has blessed you and give you the water so if you were baptized at 13 and maybe at 14 years old or 13 or 15 god gave you the holy ghost you don't have because god already sanctioned you he told you that i'm okay with your baptism everybody here but you were baptized at 13 you are 21 no holy ghost something is missing somewhere you need to recalibrate your walk jesus is coming back here but now if you have been if you've been redeemed and you feel that the blood of jesus christ cleans you from sin then you will live a christian life i will not think it will be necessary but if you want to all right i'll be fine we'll be glad to do it if you were blessed god move on with you he gave you the holy spirit fine blessed be the name of the lord but if your life has been up and down up and down up and down up and down until you smoke you do all kinds of stuff you need to recalibrate yourself maybe you missed something at the brazen altar anybody here brother branham said the man that baptized me in the name of the lord jesus christ finally ran me out of the church because i would not agree with me on women preachers that didn't make me re-baptize again why because brother branham remained christian everybody okay so far so if you have a question check your life how are you living since you got the baptism at 12 years old eight years old were you doing good or were you back sleeping slagging or going on pornography left and right you need to go back everybody care so far now when we look at this tabernacle here we position roof under justification roof deciding sanctification serving and baptism of the holy ghost in the holiest place roof resting now brother branham says this that on the inside of this intercourt we know that the tabernacle have the other court yes here then the holy place everybody then the holiest how many furniture do we have in the other place two furniture we have the the brazen altar praise god and we have the level if you notice after this there is nothing else anybody here so when you enter the other court and you go to the present altar and when you finish the president and you are baptized you have reached the plateau of the other court there is nothing else you can do the longer you stay in the other court there is nothing else that's going to be accomplished again amen can i repeat it again when you get in the other court hallelujah there is still furniture there in other words there is only two steps everybody here the most important step is the brazen altar anybody care because the brazen altar can take you to heaven at certain circumstances anybody here brother branham say if you are on the bed death at the hospital or in the hospice and you just about to go you can get in the breast and altar and go straight to heaven because you don't have much time and this is what happened to the fifa the cross he they could not bring him down to baptize him and matter of fact water baptism is only an outward expression of something that already happened at the present altar so the most important is the breast and altar but the word baptism is essential to show the people that you are on the side of the lord and once you finish these two furniture here there is nothing else you can do here you reach your climax and if you stay there longer you just walking around under justification under justification but remember under justification the snake is still there and the snake is active everybody here so the longer you stay in the other coat do you follow me do you follow me the power of the other court is not strong enough to hold the snake do you follow me and the longer you stay here the tendency you have to brought back to the world again because there is not much you can accomplish here the level here is two the master gave you two once you reach to that side everybody okay everybody okay it will not take you to three no because this level goes up to two oh my god brother branham says in this place we have the present altar what do we have here we have what the show bread the table of the show bread everybody okay then we have the candlestick and then we have water the altar of ensign so the golden altar everybody okay what do we have in the holiest the ark of the covenant and water and the water and the mercy seat on top of the ark everybody here and inside the ark you got three things there you got the mana you got the road of aaron and you got what else the water the what the table of stone everybody okay so far now ah this is all you have in the tabernacle everybody here now the problem we found that in the old testament moses took this ultra offenses and put it in the holy place you remember that when paul came paul took this altar here and put it in the holiest place everybody okay so this altar is the furniture that is moving between the holiest place and the holiest anybody care and the movement of this furniture is the cause of the saltis let me go slowly i believe last week what happened to our time why do we change the time so the time goes one hour and the time goes one hour back it's the saltis that is causing that everybody because of the movement of this altar back and forth this altar is responsible for the work of grace to be sometime through it sometimes fall sometimes you are justified you are sanctified and you are filled with the holy spirit and sometimes justification make way to sanctification sanctification make way to the baptism of the holy ghost and the baptism of the holy ghost make way to the holy ghost himself the movement of disorder can add or take away depending on how you're working with him if you working with individual people it is three if you work with the church ages he gives you four anybody get that if you didn't you let me know so i repeat it again do you want me to repeat again praise be the name of the lord this altar according to moses moses put this altar in the holy place when paul came in the new testament we showed to you paul took the shelter and put it in the holiest place it looks like this altar is moving between the two places and the movement of this altar is bringing one hour before or one hour behind anybody care but the time is still the same everybody okay everybody okay so sometimes this alter because if you notice the the strength of the pentecostal church is prayer here pentecostal pray and fast more than message believer they are professional and phd in prayer they can pray and fast 10 days they can pray and fast 20 days some pray and fast 30 days but we in the message we understand that the fasting must be instructed by god but to them is fast and pray fast and pray fast and pray fast and pray they're using the breast and altar back and forth relax you're gonna get to that brother bronham says this that on the inside of this court here called the holiest there was a piece of furniture sitting there called the water you can see it right there ever here and the covenant was in the water he's talking about the holiest place and the earth had two caribbeans the holiest and he was on the east side that was the furniture inside the holy place next come out was the water the golden candlestick brother brandon begin to speak about what the holy place karma and then on out to the water delivered the level brother branham is speaking about water now it perfectly represents the age of water and then and then exactly the three step of this procession of grace that has been given to mankind we are in the last dispensation i believe that we found my now brother branham is saying that this is luther this is wesley this is pentecost er back here hallelujah you'll be all right buddy brother branham says this the other court was who luther's age as we start in the body of the gentile church you see he's going to the church ages you remember they were jewish on up till about the time of eddie 606 when it comes into tatarian because the church started at jerusalem it was nearly all jewish convert but after the jewish is dropped over in here at both jews and water mostly jews but when he really come into the gentile age come this side come martin luther john wesley and so forth brother problem is saying that when you go to the seven church ages you have one two three four five six seven brother branham said when he started at jerusalem here with paul anybody here all the way to the fourth church ages which is the italian church ages the majority of the people were jews even though there was some mixture but brother branham say after the dark ages hey here the church turned almost completely purely to gentile people anybody here and now brother branham said this is where the grace started because the seed that started on pentecost died until he went to the darkhead jesse and everything was completely lost and the catholic church took over everything now after the tartarian church ages god begin to start with luther then he starts with wesley then he starts with pentecost justification sanctification and baptism of the holy spirit but the bride age can change this from the baptism of the holy ghost to the holy ghost himself did i lose somebody brother branham said now he said now watch this last three after the dark ages number four come up to the middle age and pass over when he comes watch this other quote flesh so spirit at the court holiest and holy place and the other coat was the water everybody okay so far the holy place was water pilgrimage holiness and free water wesley and the holiest of holy back into the water to where it begin at the beginning back at the beginning so when we got back to our tabernacle now roof at luther we found that roof was already under justification sanctification is the holy place and then the baptism is the holiest now according to brother pranam brother brother moved from the individual work anybody clear to a church age edge now the other court is luther the holy place is wesley and the holiest is pentecost anybody okay but our subject this morning is ruth at luther ruth and the justification roof deciding amen you ready right here we have two people here both of them are reformers i'm making this sink anybody here on the left side it's martin luther on the right side is john wesley brother branham says this he said i wish it could be said that the sardison which is the church age of luther edge was a restoration instead of a reformation we have two words here one word is restoration you need to stay up the other word is reformation brother branham says this he says i cannot say that in other words i cannot call lutheran age restoration before we move forward restorations means to take something everybody and bring that back to its original position everybody here if you start the church ages with everybody if you want to restore the church age you must take the church and restore it exactly like he was when paul started on the day of pentecost if the church doesn't reach the day of pentecost you don't have a restoration everybody here restoration means if you are in level eight and you drop to level one if you are restored it means that somebody pick you from one and send you back again like you were in level eight everybody okay so far but reformation is only a an improvement reformation brings changes but it doesn't bring something back to where he came from let me go had it been a restoration that edge would have been another water so brother branham is saying if luther was a restoration so lutheran age should be exactly like the day of pentecost but when we check the edge of luther we see them with a lot of stuff they're smoking and they're going to church they are drinking whiskey they're drinking beer they going to church pentecosta people didn't do this so that was not a restoration it was only a reformation it's a small change that happened but the snake is still there anybody here but he was not the best that i could say of it was that could be said of it of that age was strengthened that which remained that is ready to die there was something missing ma yes there certainly was this age had justification but he had miss sanctification and the baptism of the holy spirit holy ghost that is what god's original plan was that is what they had at pentecost because we found out paul we gave you five examples in the book of acts all of them justify sanctify filled with the holy spirit all of them offered everybody here but when we come to luther as soon as somebody gives their life to god that's it they don't go any more further they are plateau what is going on everybody here he said they were justified they were sanctified and were filled with the holy spirit that's the original plan why listen to me the reason for being justified and sanctified is to the end that you might be baptized with water god cannot justify you for nothing when god is justifying you no automatically that your next step is going to be sanctification once you get sanctified your next step is going to be the baptism of the holy spirit [Music] oh my god now be careful and get this he says in this second verse that i read for i have not found that word perfect before god how can god look at the edge of luther and say your work are not perfect anybody clear do you know what the meaning of not perfect really is it is unfulfilled so when you get in the other court your journey is unfulfilled you have not reached the destination yet you need to keep moving it's a process this age was an unfulfilled age it was just the start remember the president of getting what so when you're in other courts it's just the beginning you need to move forward that is why i said the bible called reformation not restoration he had started out in the doctrine of water which meant salvation was all of water justification means salvation belong to god remember that salvation belongs to god and brother branham says that hal lute preached the water and the justification luther preached the sovereignty of god america and then he preached what election anybody care he knew he was all of what they have a phd in grace i'm going with you somewhere everybody here anybody care everybody clear the lutheran age did not restore the church he started a reformation the wesleyan age did not restore the pentecostal age did not restore everybody here ever here the lutheran churches just didn't restore the westlake churches didn't restore the pentecostal church ages didn't restore because according to the ages mr holy ghost is ready the restoration the pentecostal brought was the restoration of the gift of the holy ghost but not the holy ghost himself [Applause] this is why brother branham got in confusion he looked at two people one speaking in tongue one interpreting and he look at one a genuine believer another one sleeping with somebody else's wife how can a restoration give you the baptism of the holy spirit and tell you to enjoy somebody else twice and you go on the pentecostal people pastors are sleeping with women in the church pastor has sinned with prostituted people and you call that restoration and they can come back on the pulpit and begin to speak in tongues and he was in the hotel at night it was a restoration of the gift but it was not a restoration of the person any question so far [Applause] everybody care but god has to restore for he cannot deny his word in other words somehow there must be a restoration this is not the resurrection of the church it is the restoration god will take the church right back to pentecost of the beginning that's why elijah must come to restore the faith back to the faith of the original father why because luther fell west referred pentecost pentecostal took the heaven until they found out that with the experience the gift they cannot hold on to laodicea now this is pulling one preacher down after the other everybody okay brother branham said then come the water down through the edges come the face of a man the reformer had been seized who no restoration karma and water no restoration karma and then water no restoration on down to water now brother branham is paid he's putting pentecostal underwater reformers because because of the movement of the present altar amen everybody here the president is in the holy place we are the one that put the president into the holiest everybody okay so far brother stephen where are you going what is the problem luther has got to be molded into wesley in other words when god started with luther luther was not supposed to stay right here because when you stay right here you only have two level once you plateau you are now going back to death everybody okay luther was supposed to be in more faith in other words change into wesley luther has got to be molded into wesley and wesley had got to be molded into water the ages and pentecost has to be molded into what luther into wesley wesley into pentecost so the pentecostal have to move to the very person of christ they miss that that's why pentecostal are in the trouble they are today they cannot they cannot preach that women need to get their paint off they're going to lose their thought in church because all the women will run away they cannot preach against her against hearing the women will be out they cannot preach against makeup the women will be out until now the women are taking over the pentecostal world and the women become pastors and preachers if they go against it they're gonna lose the popularity because pentecost was not restoration anybody here so you need to stay away from pentecostal preachers any preacher of pentecost cannot help you you are wasting your time [Applause] but here if you have your favorite pentecostal preacher from today get away from that the power they have is not strong enough to withstand our nation [Applause] you need something that can restore you back to god until you walk in the midst of the valley of shadow of darkness you don't feel no evil because somebody is with me [Applause] hallelujah he goes through a water so has the gospel gone through uh it's processing lutheran age justification we believe that wesley sanctification we believe that the pentecostal restoration of the gift for the holy ghost we believe that certainly but mold it all together anybody here don't measure in the other court don't make joy in the holy place you got to put it all together hallelujah what do you come out with jesus the same today and what oh i'll come out with who everybody cares so far blessed be the name of the lord justification service time in justification under looter then he had to become amorphy through wesley and sanctification serve its time justification have a message from god anybody okay and that message have talent anybody okay once he serves its time the talent is reached you have to move with the second talent sanctification serves time till he becomes the baptism of the holy ghost and the baptism of the holy ghost serve its time until the word which there is not only one god blend into the church and the church into who and he makes jesus reflected on the earth what he promised here in the bible may not believe it i can't make you do that i'm only responsible for the word brother stephen what is going on you ready knowing the end from the beginning each age you allotted your word to that age you allotted them a talent everybody here somehow we don't know how it ever happened but in each of those ages as we look back upon the word and we see that there was an anointing come in that age to fulfill that word there we go and in the days that we are living in there is an allotted word so every age there was a talent given and that talent have a portion everybody okay [Laughter] we believe that the holy spirit is here on earth trying to find a heart to manifest and to bring it to pass by vindicating the word that is now prophesy for water and water god promised to noah won't work for us today anybody here god promised to moses we could not have moses message moses could not have noah's message we got the message of the hour [Music] we could not have had luther message we could not have had wesley message this is another god allotted his way to each water it's another talent it's another level it's another measurement [Music] proportional to the time you are living in the bible entirely is the word of god [Applause] everybody here everybody here this bible entirely is the word of god and back here but you walking out on the street tonight and suddenly a dog a black dog comes and goes back here if you are a christian the holy spirit opened the software because you want the attack you follow me and the holy spirit opened his own bible and the holy spirit begin to look and he checked he checked and he goes and he click psalm 23 everybody here the holy spirit can click any word but out of this entire world he will pick one ever here and when he picks psalm 23 the holy ghost will go on psalm 23 and begin to anoint that song everybody here and suddenly you will feel like somebody is telling you though i walk in the midst of the valley of darkness ever here ever here the holy spirit could have anointed if god is for you who can be against you at that point that is not the word of the hour it is the word of god but is not the word of the moment you need a specific word that's going to challenge the dog [Applause] ever here when it's anointed by the holy ghost it is called the anointed word ever clear in other words the holy ghost is telling you this is what you need to fight that dog [Applause] but here if you start telling that dog in jesus name i cast you out it won't work but it's the word of god if you use the message of moses at noah's time it is not going to work but he was the word of god everybody okay so far everybody of faith so far when the word is anointed and you receive it it becomes the word made flesh [Applause] here as soon as you believe it if you check you will see the dog stopping and staring at you like this you are not the one that stopped the dog it is the message that you receive that is controlling the dog it is the message of the hour so for every age you must find what is the message for that age what is the promise of god for that time that is god's bullet to handle the devil [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah the ark of noah so save the people after after the flood what do you do with the ark of noah [Music] who gave the measurement of the ark but now the flood is over who talked about the ark of noah now if war comes are you going to go to the ark of noah it's still the word of god but it's not the word of the hour you need to find out what is the promise that is in the hour that is the answer for the enemy at that time hallelujah brother robert timer is my enemy amen he said we could not have had luther message we could not have we had wesley message this is another time god allowed his word to each day age and as that age came along he sent someone there to vindicate that word and to prove that it's water hallelujah if i touch you and mentor this message it will not take no effect on you if your ability is fab talent and they give you one talent you are choked you need to know my caliber you need to know my makeup i don't fit for the age of luther you need something more stronger hallelujah this is bright time man if moses taught the message of noah it would take no effect if jesus start the message of moses it will take water because the predestinated seed are laying there that will only be watered by that type of water that is give for water so everybody have their own ability their own potential you need to know the caliber before you administer the drugs everybody okay we have 250 milligram amoxicillin we have 500 milligram amoxicillin we have 875 milligram amoxicillin this will work for a child but he will kill an adult because it's not strong enough to handle the level of an adult you need to increase the dosage the drug is still amoxicillin but the dosage is different according to the height and the weight of the individual you gotta know the height of this edge and the weight of this cell to give the proper dosage [Applause] [Applause] hallelujah in other words can i help you today [Applause] the holiness message will not work today you are taking 250 milligrams but now this is a 875. you need to find the profit dosage that can meet the edge that can match the opponent [Applause] i love this pentecostal preacher he preaches so good that's why you are in the state you are today that's why you're having a hard time man that's why you have a hard time taking off the makeup that's why you have a hard time changing your clothing that's why your skirt in this church is always at the bottom line but get the right medication get malachi 4 get the correct dosage your skirt will go all the way here [Applause] everybody here that's why preacher in the message must keep the dosage correct don't know what the dosage keep the dosage correct because somebody need to get heal keep the message pure [Applause] repeat the message the way he was given it is not your message it is the message of god say what god said [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you're bringing confusion on the pulpit brother branham was a man brother we already know that repeat what brother branham said [Applause] give us what brother branham said give us that self the lord that's all i need [Applause] as hard as the medication seems to be it is good because the infection must go [Applause] oh that's a preacher who doesn't want to hurt the feeling of the people we want to compromise to keep the believer in the church i don't need no timing i'm gonna repeat the message [Applause] do you want to come to me and you are sick and you say doctor give me a medication and i give you 275. when i know that you need 875. you're going to call me what this is what you're asking me to do you call me a crook doctor you're there for money [Applause] but if i give you the proper medication and you go home you heal you will be telling everybody come to my doctor come to my church come to my church we have the staff oh my god brother kelly what am i going to do with this hallelujah hallelujah he said he won't grow in any condition it must be the condition that grows it when you come in this world you have a program nobody can decode that only a certain message that's why you were in the baptist church and you were not happy that's why you were under pentecostal and you were not happy but one day when somebody began to talk about them and said something just struck like this is true this is true that is the message that can decode you hallelujah you just read the message like this and somebody's in you is saying that's correct that's correct that's correct it is the predestinated seed that is telling you this is for me this is for me this is for me this is for me [Applause] hallelujah my god but you take the sun you take the sun that shine in august and put it on the wheat today it will do what because it's too strong that's why you have a hard time taking this message and pushing to the denomination they can't get it it's going to kill them because when the message entered there you begin to knock the women preacher you begin to knock the makeup nobody they can't handle that they are not have they they have done for one talent the son of five talent will kill this hallelujah certainly you can do that it must come in its season so must god wheat and grain wrapping just in the season in it it's in but well a wheat will die the fruit will die but the sun that lives today that's sham today rather it's oncoming harvest is happening it is rapping the grain should mature with the water in other words you cannot bring the message right here and then you bring it all the way to the tartarian because the crop in tatarian are still under in other words you cannot take a boy that is five years old and you give him 875 milligram amoxicillin you will see the boy sitting like this and suddenly he can move because the dosage is too much hallelujah oh my where are you going my friend this is where we're going one day there will come a blast from heaven and the dead in christ shall rise first damn old testament sent back you who our wedding will bless forth and come out first abraham and everybody and go into the resurrection we shall drop right in line we also get in line it's a parade going into the sky these all mortal bodies change and made like unto his glorious own body what a parade that shall be when we start heaven ward some of this day in that rapturing time that lays ahead proudly displaying what the blood of jesus christ upon our water so when we will be going to heaven everybody on your chest you have the blood of jesus christ do you follow me do you follow me luther has the blood wesley has the blood columba has the blood paul has the blood all amoxicillin everybody here the blood upon the chest the message of god in the water that the water that those that you will be different [Music] it is the message of god but the dosage is different it is the talent of god but the numbers are different those and the luther have 250 those under wesley it's a maxi ceiling but it's only 500 milligrams you gotta wait for me to bring you 175 but everybody have a moxi ceiling we're going according to the dosage that was administered in your time [Music] everybody clear everybody here oh my god no one would have any more respect for john wesley sankey moody finney not calvin any of those men than any of us minister who appreciate the men of god that would have those men we all appreciate them anybody care yeah they have one talent that one who has three that one have four but the dosage is different everybody here but see we are coming up we are not in that age each one of them serve everybody okay in a different age and in a different the talents are different everybody here the talents are different the talent of the holy the outer court is a different talent than the holy place and the talent of the holy place is lower than the talent of the holiest everybody here hey we are serving god today in the different measure from what they wear the dosage is different if there is a tomorrow there will be an edge there will be a gospel if not there is a tomorrow if anybody care that we still advance until the whole thing is what complete in god and god become you gotta go all the way until you and the maker you are won everybody here my god what are you saying i believe that martin luther had the holy spirit this is where people got trouble so brother stephen we need to go to the lutheran church hallelujah i believe that martin luther had the holy ghost absolutely maybe not [Music] in the water it was a holy ghost under one talent and that one talent can only work in luther's time when the infection increase from hell they have to increase the dosage with wesley and in now this your hell is now open so heaven must also give a different dosage that's why we cannot go on the little church hallelujah maybe not in the portion it is today because it was not that does it was not available yet brother branham is saying everybody care a person that come at the president can only fulfill what is here and when he fulfill what is here which is the word of his time he's good with god everybody but this the ark will not be give it was not given here it was not the time for the ark yet it was not available this is the portion that you have here but we have been through this you people of the tabernacle here on the blackboard but he did believe to god and he that believe has water that's how luther can preach the people that's all once he finished luther plato you can give luther the bible he doesn't see sanctification he can turn the pages like this he doesn't see sanctification because his level his talent is blocking him when wesley comes wesley pick up and he looks like once they say wait a minute this is sanctification come you lutheran this is sanctification oh we didn't see it it was all over he loved it was all around here but wesley could read the day of pentecost and speaking in tongues and prophesying first corinthians 13 first corinthians 14 and the gift of the spirit it doesn't mean anything to him because he has plato he already he can he cannot go further than what he does as he is amen then the pentecostal came in azusa street and they begin to speak in tongues and they say look it's right here but after a while the pentecostal flipped the bible all they know speaking in tongues have the holy ghost you have the holy ghost you're speaking to yeah and then finally prosperity prosperity prosperity prosperity prosperity prosperity then an adam came and the bible now rip open here there is the church god picks them up through lutheran age justification wesley age he sanctified them and in this day the eg filled them he put the life in them everybody here the holy spirit picked them up the holy spirit sanctified them the holy spirit filled them see it's all the same church i think that luther kama and what westlake kama and what all of them many of them will go in the water according to their dosage not the lutheran today [Music] everybody okay they had the water after all of them got money they got faith but in person and the faith that you have will reproduce the believer to the height or the capacity of that portion if the portion is one the believer will be one and reach down and plateau everybody here they had the portion of the spirit was preached to them they believed it just like job all he knew was the sacrifice of the lamb what else do you expect from job nothing else everybody brother branham said luther under justification that is what he preached is that right luther preached the justice by faith and he had a great message and that was a of the holy ghost that lutheran went when the message comes off god was going to raise up his church and send it out great luther say oh we believe we gathered here now we got the restoration before you know it all the believers go after a while give me my whiskey and luther don't understand why are these people drinking whiskey but here we are at the end time that is what the holy ghost does the holy ghost by what just a light shadow of it a talent the holy ghost by water a little deeper shadow of it the talent increase the the the dosage is increasing the holy ghost by water a deeper shadow of it the dosage increase now the holy ghost by water of the water now we have the full dosage you give luther our daughter you kill him hallelujah that is what that is the way god is bringing his church we are fitly joined together one heart and one accord now somebody said well the lutheran back there they had nothing don't you believe it the lutheran will come forth in the resurrection the lutheran back there just the same as the rest will come forth in the resurrection in other words these lutheran are already dead [Music] not the lutheran today anybody care and that's the reason today people say oh well there shall be a sweeping revolver that shall go out here and save the hundred million pentecost they shall all get saved and they shall be interrupted you are mistaken the rapture will be hundreds of thousands that's right but they shall be made up of 6 000 years of water in other words the biggest number of the bread it doesn't come from the pentecostal it starts from paul all the way that's what makes the bread bigger so don't expect a bigger number hallelujah man walks in the light as the light comes to him he crosses the bridges when he comes to them and if he refuse it then he's left in water but if he keeps moving on [Music] so what are diluted today what are they doing today the whole rapture now luther was a part wesley was a part the prophet was apart a part just in the revelation that they was making up according to their talent the body the feet the toes the arm and so forth until their the constellation everybody here which we get to that in the few minutes that makes the entire rapture that don't mean that luther is lost the lutheran that rejects sanctification would be lost why because another door unfolded that message now cannot hold on because hell has turned up everybody here you need to move to the second shield everybody here that wants to hold on to something israel eat new man away you cannot keep it the next day the only manner that could stay without being changed it's the manner that's an eternal manner everybody here but you got a manner from luther he can last or not that is why luton lost his message that is how wesley lost his message if the west land church would have went on there will be what and if the lutheran went on they will become what and now if the pentecost are gone they shall be what in other words the requirement today is more than the other code so if you are a believer today once you got to the present altar and in the level you have not finished yet you have not met god qualification for this time if you are living under looter fine there is nothing else you can do but here in this age you must go to the next one and when you finish the next one you must go to the other one and tell the holy ghost getting you because those eggs for the holy ghost is given now so you cannot meet god today do you follow me with justification that's why brother branham say only the people that have the holy ghost will go in the rapture because that's the requirement today so you cannot stay under justification you're going to stay hallelujah brother branham say if you hang back and keep going back in the world like you are going now you will be what 20 years in the message in the other court you're going to get lost because the dosage today the requirement is over there we are not undiluted the plateau today is higher everybody here if it shall only be the shack and the stock is to be watered you're going to be put together with the lutheran that is today and you are going to go through the tribulation period ever here the only way you can escape and be shield from god you got to get in the holiest and now the devil can get to you because the devil today can speak in tongues he can prophesy and he live like a devil he can cheat he can lie he can come to church and live any kind of way that anointing cannot work today you need something stronger and that which is stronger contain everything he contained justification he contained what a baptism he contained sanctification he also speak in tongues it is the giver not the gift the giver have everything hallelujah so what happened after these and wesley came up and bring their biggest message everybody buff lutheran wesley i'm going to go to the airport both children everybody okay that's why you heard brother branham say knox phoenix sankey all of those are children but among those children there were two of them that excel everybody those two children are these two everybody okay on the left side it's heaven on the right side is armenians relax everybody here brady branham god raised up many muddy men of which luther was but calvin and zwingli were two other luminous and beside these were many many more who are not so well known however though all this was not in vain the mighty work of god was actually what injured by these very men so the messenger the people that were bringing the messenger calls a stumbling block to the believer because it was not the time yet in the age of philadelphia which is the age of wesley brother bonham said even though luther brought the truth just the truth of justification the romans church and the eastern counterpart the orthodox stage still clung to works now works are fine but they don't save you they don't make you perfect it's crust or perish it is not even crushed and works it is crust alone this edge begins the year of what armenianism that does not believe in christ as day he does not sing nothing but the blood for he's seeing nothing but the blood and my own i'm gonna get there let's go slowly so these four now causes the lutheran church the west land church the cavinism and the armenianism what is going on when brother branham came brother branham put the macroscope on all of them everybody okay and brother branham found out that all of them can be divided into it's only two groups hey berkeley and these two group now it seems like luther was going down and calvin was taking more power than luther until today it looks like wesleyan church begin to go down they met this and then the armenians begin to get more power and dominated the world and these two guys here dominated the edges until they impact even the marriages [Music] you ready what is really is the problem pastor put your seatbelt as i'm going to zeroed in to the airport what is the problem between those what's really going on the problem is between paul the problem is between paul and james can i have another one brother kelly paul and james why to kill him i have another thank you the problem is between paul and james these two group what happened what are you preaching brother stephen paul when he came paul began to speak to the roman and the galatians and paul made some strong statement and paul says in romans 3 21 therefore we conduct we conclude i'm sorry that a man is justified by what without water paul bring a separation between faith and the deed of the law or works this did you follow me is not your deed i want you to keep that in mind because sooner we're going to get ruth serving everybody okay this deed are not your deed it is the deed of the law it is things that god require you to do everybody not what men require you to do so these deeds are not the deed of man they are the deed from god this faith also is not the faith of man it is the faith from god but when paul came paul said you are justified by faith remember we are roof under loot roof under justification everybody here paul emphasized again in romans 4 he said for if abraham were justified by what he have wherefore to glory but not before god paul said if abraham was justified by work ah the people who praise him but not god so the calvinist and luther when they saw that they say see it is faith it is faith forget about the work i'm going slowly everybody okay now blessed be the name of the lord paul moved from roman four he insisted again in romans five he said therefore being justified by what justification by faith not by work we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ luther say remember you the catholic church always do this do this faith faith fifth calvin took it and became a phd on that galatian 2 16 paul say knowing that a man is not justified by water so that kills completely work luther and calvin say forget about this paul say not work all i have to do faith i'm ready to go to heaven and you hear them in the message touching jesus it's all that really matters and my life will not be the same everybody okay they can post that quickly especially if the pastor is preaching on sanctification lutheran don't like it hold on anybody here he said bad by faith of what that's all it's easy even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by what of christ and not by the water wake of the lord forever work of the lord shall whatever no flesh be magnified that's it it's easy all the time tight traces short dresses too much i believe in jesus christ that's all lutheran [Music] under the message of globalism everybody here galatians 3 paul come back again he said but no man is justified by what in the sight of god it is evident that the justice league by what are luther embrace that he say i got it that's all faith so when the brother is in church hallelujah fifth when he goes home he opened his refrigerator whiskey it is faith lutheran in the message of brother branham on the other side james come james say but will dad know of venman that faith without water work is what john wesley come he say you've been playing too much in church your faith show me your work what do you mean come open james faith without instead look at your work you don't have it am i reading a different bible you want to go home so james come and he put one works and he said two faith now armenianism go this way and they push on faith on everybody here hallelujah was not abraham our father justified by what oh my god paul said he was justified by what you need a prophet that can take james and paul and put them together [Music] hallelujah when he had offered isaac he signed up to the altar go see what abraham did over there he didn't just watch that day and say i believe god i believe god no when god asked him something he took it and he did when god said take off your shot skirt he went and throw it in the ground everybody okay says that her faith wrote with his work and by work was made faith was made what now according to james what makes work faith perfect according to paul what is the main thing but nobody can be justified before god the puzzle because the talent is blinding them they're reaching their plateau you need a different dosage everybody here and the scripture was fulfilled which say abraham believed god oh the covenant is saying now we got you see he believes god armenians say slow down he say come on and he was imputed unto him for water calvin said you see i was telling you and he was called water calvin said slow down close the bible itself he was already the friend of god armenians say let me continue he said you see them how by water a man is water and not by what so armenian is saying you cannot stop at faith only you gotta add work because his dosage have increased it is not 250 milligram calvin you need to go to 500. hallelujah likewise also was not rehab the harlot justified by what when she had received the messenger and had seen them out another way you go to hebrew 11 paul said by faith rehab why you didn't reject the bible with all this so contradiction [Music] hallelujah for us the body without the spirit is water so faith without work is water those two emerge faith i follow luther i mean in this no i follow wesley works everybody okay with you marion branham does who has he has called he has already those who he justified he has already oh the calvinist starts shouting i'm already justified so i'm already glorified that's right there is where we get and works what here is the whole things in water armenian and what grace is what god does for you are we okay that's grace he paid the price he went on the cross for you he died for you by his trap you are here you don't have nothing to do the calvinists say amen what is what you do for who see it is grace that bring you to and what says that what you do for i'm gonna show you what kind of works his brother brought i'm talking about not today when we're gonna get to roof serving you will see how do you serve god not according to your work but what is work everybody okay because if you don't understand work you're going to be an armenian in the message everybody okay now as abraham was justified by faith because he believed in god paul justified him by what james turn over and justify him by what but paul was speaking of what god and james was speaking of what man you see how the prophet begin to get if you say you are a believer and then act contrary to what you say then you are not there everybody here oh my god it should be mentioned that wesley never did desire to build a work upon a denomination of sectarian basis though he was an armenian in his belief he was a good candidate for james he based his eternal life on faith and or living the life rather than simply let's head to the airport amen brother branham now is dealing with both of them he said calvinist just believe on the lord and you got eternal security armenianism that if you just touch not hand or not test not i like to do this but i can do it armenianism is too far away from calvinist and they both for what they were right in their time but today they are wrong because their dosage is not for today they both got scripture but it's got to hit the target he only reveal his word in the predestination now when i use the word predestination it's a bad word to use in public especially when we have a mixed crowd between the armenian and water i have asked you not to think i know it all but they are both wrong according to the scripture i will go slowly down the road and show you how to put both of them together according to brother branham amen in marriage and divorce brother branham said there is two great water of doctrine in there one of them is water and the other is water since those people dominated the denominational world two of them everybody here one is what and the other one is what you have it in the message i'm gonna learn and we come to find out that people who believe in grace they calvinist they say bless god you don't hurt me to smoke he don't hurt me to drink i can do these things i got eternal water then we found on the other side on the legalistic oh i would like to ball him out i would like to show him a piece of my mind but i am a christian i have to keep water both of them got snake this snake is more active than this one this is kind of dormant everybody okay we have to teach you this thing so you will know clearly everybody see you found yourself on two different roads and neither one of them is what and that is hard to say but it's the truth everybody here this one will take grace regardless of the life he's living this is the believer da accept jesus christ the guilt is taken off but their life is in the other court they are up and down everybody they fall down with a woman they fall down with a man and then tomorrow they repent and they come back again they don't mean to do it everybody here because they went to the brazen altar and praise and alter his judgment so the judgment of god is there like a whooping as soon as they do something wrong something condemned them and they come back like lord why am i keep falling on this pornography i don't want to do it i don't want to do it dare the people when you begin to preach sanctification in church they get very nervous they can hold their chair they don't like it because it's disturbing the snake do you follow me they are the people that love the sermon of encouragement and motivational speaking on tick-tock it doesn't matter where you fall god still loves you you are still his child come back he still loves you you are the prodigal so you will see them on fire everybody here you will see them in church when they say you don't have to know the seventh seal all you have to do is believe you see them jumping on the chair a lutheran because it's grace if he finds the message complicated he goes quickly to grace oh brother we will all be saved by grace yeah we will all enter in the rapture nobody nobody knows everything nobody is in the level we all will enter the rapture by grace a lutheran under the message everybody here the calvinist on the other side is handling the snake with his whopping do you follow me do you follow me he's having a whoop with the snake there the calvinist here he goes on the computer and before you know it he's going to fall in pornography and he's going to watch pornography until it's finished then he's condemned he already swallowed pornography he enjoy it then he got this is bad lord forgive me i didn't do it a calvinist he enjoyed the sexual relationship in the hotel after it's finished that's when he wake up ever here the calvinist is different the methodist is different he has a whopping he stuck before the computer no no no i'm gonna fall here let me take it before my wife so when my wife is there he will keep me for not doing it here the calvinist when he look at a woman which is badly dressed he's gonna look at the woman for a long time and then he turn around these love decent people that's a calvinist because it's grace the legalist when he look at that i'm not going to look at that because it's seen i'm not going to do it i'm not going to do it i'm not going to do it because he's he's hitting the snake quickly down down down down these legalists are very picky everybody here if you give him a big board like this everybody here and you put a black dot right here are you gonna ask him what do you see a black dot a black dot a black dot a black dog he won't see anything here everybody clear the legalistic when they are in the message when they're preaching about holiness you're gonna hear them preach that way kill kingdom pastor get them get them and that day the lutheran are shaking like this do you love the message of the hour do you love the message of the hour the cafe mister aha the methodists are hard to live with i'm going to stop here i will get that on luth roof serving about here every little picky stuff brother brandon say this the bible says this the bible says this but they struggle they struggle they are controlling that by themselves i'm not going to fall i'm not going to fall i'm not going to fall i know brother branham said this so i'm not gonna throw um i can tell i'm a christian i'm not supposed to do that he's handling the snake the other one if you shoot him he shoots back and he comes back i'm sorry for speaking back to you but he already cast you that's the that's the legalist that's the that's the calvinist why because both of them have snake let's finish here you guys are pulling what is going on brother brother there was a fine young man very fine boy he was going with a little girl very fine little girl out of the fan family are those people sinners let me finish there are they sinners oh my god and this boy all of sudden came up with some kind of an idea and he just walked away and he did something wrong to the little girl and matcha has promised her to do certain things and they didn't do it and then didn't do it and instead of coming to the girl and apologizing a gentleman should do like a gentleman should do he just he was just he just was not in him to do it and the father and the mother called me on the scene to say we won't desire to know what is wrong with our boy now it is not easy to do sometime but you must be truthful and honest you can see the airport today therefore the boy was a water as far as a water you okay now he had and had been what the boy had done what him and being where is that boy you need to read brother branham very well the boy is in the other court everybody here all right repented and he has his position among the what because once you baptize the believer understand that now you're proud of us but they didn't say the boy have the holy ghost what's happened but yet he had not received the water of the holy spirit no matter how much he thought he had the boy was already in the other court and the people and the father the parent looked they say you need to get married because he comes to church he's a good boy he's a funny young man he's already grown up he started working his first job the father said you need to find your wife he start coding a girl and suddenly a bad behavior walk away the father said wait a minute what's wrong with this boy he was a good boy brother branham say they came to brother branham they said please investigate this brother branham look he said bring his blood through his blood put it on the microscope he said the boy is in another court the boy is under looter all this time in the message he was still under looter and now the gene and the father and the mother of this boy no matter how much they are converted the parent still remain in the flesh that has been interbreded out to this boy therefore the boy has got a complex in him just like from his mother's family and they are not forgiving they will not apologize that is where the boys stand because the snake is still active the flesh of this boy still have the gin and the snake is pumping his energy through the gin and suddenly the convoy flips hallelujah now i said to the father no matter how much you have raised him up now look at you out of your family all of them drunk fighting shooting and cutting and so forth now look at your family to the mother they're a bunch of people they just sit there and won't speak very independent and so forth irreverent to religion you are the only one of all your sisters and brother who are sweet kind and what what does that why are you different than your family everybody here and you are a tree part of that family tree yet you have received the water that's the things that made you and what sweet it is not your people anymore it is your that living water brother branham is showing that you parents are different because when you receive the holy spirit the holy spirit burn your stake out and block all your genes from your family that's why even your family sees you different you don't behave like them you behave like a different line of melchizedek but your boy doesn't have it yet hallelujah look at your family practically all of them are drunk and so forth and moody high tempered but you are not you are kind forgiving what is it the holy spirit you are no more what you are it is trusting you the same now the same thing has to happen to you the father rose up to brother branham what about them he rose up and said my son went to there everybody okay everybody okay my son went into the he's bragging my son went into the altar he was water look at the father on confession my son went into the and he was my son is in the other court and he think being in the other court was the deal done have you received the holy ghost since you believe my son has been baptized correctly in the name of jesus christ and what a baptism in the pool said i know my son has come to penecostal teaching even in the message because my son was at the present altar and in a level he come to jesus christ he should be good brother branham this is why you need this kind of stuff i say that may be all right all the other motion adequate he might be identified by baptism as a believer with the but until he is all i'll advise the young men to never what he shall make what no justify young men should get married this message let me read it again he shall make hell enough for her until that gentle sweet forgiving spirit of christ comes then there will be a paradox in itself to take the very water nature water of a boy that has been bred between father and mother yet in his intellectual he's still trying the what the best to do what he doesn't mean bad he doesn't understand why he did what he did he's trying to hold on the problem is he's under loot there's a wrong dosage anybody care he can do it he shall never overcome it christ will have to overcome it when he led christ then he is already overcome it shall be a perfect paradox when a man is born of the water in other words no sister should get married if this is the statue of pull a break to your relationship don't get married why because when you get married in a justified state you must make sure you speak to somebody and somebody's talking to you everybody here when you get married under justification and your husband under justification you got into a marriage with two snakes that's why you fast all the time you're gonna fast all the time nobody help somebody to move or to grow spiritually because you already reached the plateau of your relationship you cannot go higher than what you already have that's why you are worldly in your marriage that's why you more enjoy sitting and watching movie together and you think that is the pleasure of marriage you're on netflix all the time your husband is in politics the wife is over there on the facebook or she's on youtube or she's doing something and both of them are fine when you ask them i didn't see anything wrong this one say i didn't see anything wrong we didn't do we don't drink we we are born in a message i didn't see it's a marriage under looter that husband of yours one of this day you're gonna find him with naked pictures of a woman because you're living with a man with a snake in her you're living with a woman with a snake just cross him and you see that temper going up because you you got married under luther and now you expecting your husband to behave like wesley he doesn't have whistle in him you expecting the husband to behave like a pentecostal husband there is no holy ghost in the husband you cannot pull more than what he has that's why he doesn't read the brochure at home that's why he doesn't listen to the message he's fine that's why you can see him wearing shorts at home he doesn't bother him because those stuff are not important for him he's under calvinism and if you graduate to live for the wife or the husband to be under looter and then the wife and the wesley the wife will become like a hard woman to the husband and the husband see the white flesh is trying to dominate me because the wife is pushing we need to go to church you cannot stay here we need to be in church on time the wife is like she have like a little whipping all the time you cannot let the children on the on the internet like this you need to cut up the internet because mama is under wesley but that is too loose you need to let the children play the children need to be found you too much left and right brother branham leave them alone that is under looter let's stand there mama tight dad is loose sometimes daddy and mommy lose and when you look at the children they don't know no gps the children do whatever they want to do because that's how they grew up they grew up under a lutheran marriage they grew up on their westlane marriage under wesleyan marriage they grew up under trauma under the law don't do this don't touch this don't do don't do this because they're trying to force them to be christian because they are remembering armenian it's work it's work it's work one say it's grace it's grace it's grace your children don't go to church it's just one day what is the problem all the time with children being in church a lutheran father everybody here and before you know it the parent their children are completely lost everybody care and with your legalistic you're going to get tired one day and you can do no more and with your free will you love your children more than god oh don't touch my child don't do this don't do this when that child will go into the world now you will begin to pray and it's going to be a hard time for god to turn that child back from the world and bring him back again in the message because you yourself didn't have the holy ghost and you cannot produce more than your plateau you already locked for years and this is what you you're giving to your children everybody here the covenants love jokes all the time they just want to play they don't want to serious atmosphere they want to just fun fun fun fun they don't get tired of the fun when the wife wanna bring thing in order he's the one that is gonna break down everything what is feeding you what knowledge do you have more than this message when do you sit and listen to the message it's nothing i just go to church and go back and that say calvinist in the message ruth and luther if you're there it's time to come out and let's move on amen you turn around this mountain so long and it didn't help you you yourself need to go get the holy ghost and then at that point it's not going to be one side or the other you will see what the baptism of the holy ghost let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace for your love and for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father these messages are cutting they're hard father they're tough to swallow but that's the medication that you send father to help your children because the hour is late father no matter how much we feel impressed in our heart to do something may we sit down and set aside and check our heart to see what is motivating us what do we thirst after work on the message part we hate what kind of message part we like how do we behave when we see something going on are we picky or do we look at that through love how do we behave how do i get in this message i got married that's fine do i ever remember one day that i was sitting and somebody's talking to me and i know that this is jesus christ talking to me or i just grew up like that i know god talks i know god is real but i never heard his voice before i don't know how he leads people i'm just moving on the way i'm moving on i'm loyal to my wife i'm loyal to my husband he doesn't do anything wrong i don't see what else we have to do or start reading all these books and things like that father may you give an awakening to your children this is grace for you to open these doors so that they understand nobody is trying to this christianized them nobody's nailing them down you are only showing them where they are because the requirement of this age is higher than looter it is not just coming to the altar and being baptized it is not just getting into the holiest holy place but they must go all the way to the holiest until that snake is completely burned up and they know the new creation and whatever can happen father they can meet you on the other side or meet you into the air lord i commit these families unto the hand the such precious brothers and sisters but father i cannot decrease the dosage of the medication i have to give it the way it was given lord may you help them may you help them legalistic understanding that they cannot master that snake they have been hiding so long struggling within themselves and covering themselves under religion but they still struggle and it's not helping and the other has been too loose until when they are at their work nobody desire to be like them because there is no difference between them and the people in their work father may we get to that christianity that is intended for this hour with the proper dosage until people will see jesus christ made flesh and reflected in our life we commit and ask everything in jesus precious name amen god bless you church we love you [Music] the night season and all the day long yes some through the water [Applause] some through the blood some through the fire but all through the night song through great sorrow but god [Music] remember the building fun on the way out y'all can consider yourselves dismissed as we sing the chorus [Music] the fire but all through the blood some through great sorrow but god gives a song in the night season
