[53:34] spin and yet I say unto
[53:39] you that even Solomon in all his

[55:08] evil
[55:11] thereof

[55:25] 11 25 and
[55:31] 26 at that time Jesus answered and
[55:37] said I thank thee oh

[57:10] scripture you are the only one that can
[57:13] give us the
[57:15] context and that's what we are expecting
[57:18] and
[57:19] waiting that's why move me out of the
[57:22] way and speak to your
[57:24] people father
[57:28] father circumcise our ears and
[57:32] hearts so that each one of us may
[57:35] receive your
[57:36] thoughts in its all
[57:39] deepness so that leaving this building
[57:43] so that we can say that God have blessed
[57:49] me take the leadership of this
[57:52] meeting May the service of this word
[57:56] be from the beginning to the end in the
[57:59] name of Jesus Christ we humbly ask it
[58:03] amen
[58:06] amen again God bless
[58:09] you from uh the scripture we
[58:13] read I have a
[58:18] title based on the message that came
[58:21] with brother
[58:23] Bram and my title tonight is
[58:27] worries it's a little bit
[58:33] odd to have a title such as that one
[58:37] worries maybe you were expecting
[58:39] everything but not a title
[58:44] [Music]
[58:45] worries God is a god of
[58:48] [Applause]
[58:50] surprise
[58:52] amen amen amen am
[59:00] and looking into the scripture and in
[59:03] the message the word
[59:06] worry I went and asked the dictionary
[59:09] tell me about
[59:11] worries first of all the dictionary of
[59:14] man before getting into God's Own
[59:20] dictionary because the dictionary of God
[59:22] in this same time is William Mario
[59:26] [Applause]
[59:30] amen amen
[59:33] Amen brother
[59:35] Bram if you ask the
[59:38] dictionary to give you the word
[59:42] adultery they will give you a certain
[59:46] sense but when you get in God's Own
[59:49] dictionary it's speaking about something
[59:52] completely
[59:53] different that's why in this age
[59:59] we must bring what God's Own dictionary
[1:00:02] has already brought to
[1:00:04] [Applause]
[1:00:06] us in men's dictionary he say that
[1:00:12] worry it's a lack of moral
[1:00:17] rest a lack of physical
[1:00:24] rest and it changes your mood
[1:00:30] constantly I might also say it this
[1:00:33] way that
[1:00:35] worry in a
[1:00:38] man it's it's it's a it's a love of
[1:00:42] change in
[1:00:44] disgu because you are longing to
[1:00:50] change because man is not always happy
[1:00:54] in the state that he found
[1:00:57] himself he always long for his situation
[1:01:00] to
[1:01:01] change for his state to
[1:01:04] change for his condition to
[1:01:08] change and then he bring a lot of
[1:01:10] thoughts to your
[1:01:12] mind and then for and after a while you
[1:01:15] don't have Tranquility
[1:01:20] anymore that's why where you find
[1:01:24] worry you will hear complain and
[1:01:27] lamentation
[1:01:30] crying that's why when if you find
[1:01:33] worries be
[1:01:36] careful if you find worry
[1:01:39] somewhere you will find
[1:01:42] Amnesia you will find
[1:01:45] lust you will find
[1:01:48] competition you will find lack of
[1:01:52] patience and so forth amen amen am
[1:01:58] am and when man reach that
[1:02:03] state he's in a complete total
[1:02:07] Amnesia amen
[1:02:11] amen let me read something in the
[1:02:13] scripture
[1:02:14] first before I move
[1:02:19] forward let me go to the book of
[1:02:22] lamentation
[1:02:28] lamentation chapter
[1:02:32] 3 lamentation 3 verse
[1:02:37] 37 I'm talking to God's holy
[1:02:43] people because the holy people of God
[1:02:46] understand the language of their
[1:02:49] [Music]
[1:02:53] father the Bible says who is he that
[1:02:57] sath and he cometh to pass when the Lord
[1:03:00] commanded it
[1:03:02] not because most of the time when
[1:03:05] something bad happened to you when a
[1:03:08] problem happened to
[1:03:09] you you think that God is not aware of
[1:03:14] it and we are the one informing God
[1:03:17] about the
[1:03:19] situation and then you begin to inform
[1:03:21] God Lord why do you see me in such a
[1:03:24] state
[1:03:26] are you the one informing
[1:03:29] God before it happened to
[1:03:32] you God already knew it's going to
[1:03:35] happen God already allow it to
[1:03:38] happen instead of
[1:03:41] crying a Christian should
[1:03:43] [Applause]
[1:03:45] say why did God allow this to hit
[1:03:50] me what is the lesson he want me to
[1:03:53] learn
[1:03:58] amen amen amen
[1:04:03] amen this these are question you should
[1:04:06] ask yourself as a
[1:04:07] Christian instead of staying all night
[1:04:12] crying oh Lord why am I suffering like
[1:04:16] this oh Lord do you really see
[1:04:19] me you are the one informing
[1:04:22] God are you the one informing God
[1:04:26] [Applause]
[1:04:31] Hallelujah
[1:04:37] 38 out of the mouth of the most high
[1:04:40] proceedeth not evil and
[1:04:44] good that's why a
[1:04:46] Christian when something good comes we
[1:04:50] praise God when something evil happen we
[1:04:53] say glory to God
[1:04:56] because you must
[1:04:58] know that nothing can happen to a
[1:05:02] Christian without God giving permission
[1:05:05] for
[1:05:05] it
[1:05:07] Hallelujah glory to
[1:05:10] God

[1:22:09] amen amen
[1:22:13] amen what we need
[1:22:17] [Music]
[1:22:18] today it is not a bunch of material
[1:22:22] things we have that
[1:22:26] we don't need greater
[1:22:29] churches we don't need greater
[1:22:34] congregations to know that you have
[1:22:36] God you don't have to fill this uh
[1:22:39] church here to know that you have
[1:22:42] God even a church of 10
[1:22:46] believer like the Church of Ephesus have
[1:22:48] only 12 believer all of them fill with
[1:22:51] the
[1:22:52] spirit he was more than the Church of a
[1:22:55] thousand
[1:22:56] people where they have gift without
[1:23:02] love
[1:23:04] amen
[1:23:07] amen I am in the house of my father I
[1:23:12] must say things St it's about God's
[1:23:15] children
[1:23:17] [Music]
[1:23:20] talking brother say we don't need more
[1:23:23] on the radio and on
[1:23:26] television it's good but that's not the
[1:23:28] main
[1:23:30] thing we don't need so many more of
[1:23:33] these
[1:23:35] things but what we need
[1:23:39] today to be
[1:23:44] spiritual is a person that will humble
[1:23:48] themsel before
[1:23:52] God if they have not got a
[1:23:56] penny and will
[1:23:59] pray until that Spirit within
[1:24:04] them is satisfied with the goodness of
[1:24:08] God and in the
[1:24:12] heart a Revival takes place on the
[1:24:15] inside of the
[1:24:19] heart that changes their attitude
[1:24:25] an atmosphere that they live
[1:24:29] in that's why the Bible
[1:24:31] [Music]
[1:24:33] says let this man that was in Christ be
[1:24:37] also in
[1:24:39] you him who was in the form of
[1:24:42] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:24:46] with God but he humble
[1:24:49] himself he took the condition of a man
[1:24:53] that's why
[1:24:55] you can do
[1:24:56] everything without
[1:24:58] humility
[1:25:00] zero
[1:25:03] zero the love of God in my
[1:25:05] heart with
[1:25:07] humility will always make me
[1:25:10] believe that brother Steven is greater
[1:25:13] than me and brother Steven will say
[1:25:15] brother CH is greater than me and from
[1:25:19] there I will respect him he will respect
[1:25:23] me
[1:25:26] he won't respect me because of gray hair
[1:25:29] I won't respect him because he's
[1:25:32] tall because of the responsibility God
[1:25:35] put on
[1:25:37] him because he's carrying an inside
[1:25:41] man that man is Jesus
[1:25:44] [Applause]
[1:25:48] Christ and if Jesus is in
[1:25:51] you he will bring his character
[1:25:54] in
[1:25:56] you and the character of Jesus
[1:25:59] Christ it's a loving
[1:26:02] character that's why he
[1:26:04] say that he loves so much the world that
[1:26:07] he gave his only begotten
[1:26:10] son it
[1:26:12] means he loved those that were
[1:26:16] unlovable amen amen amen amen amen
[1:26:21] amen I want to keep uh catch my
[1:26:26] quick let me go quickly that's
[1:26:32] why brother Bram say
[1:26:36] man he said man is always unstable in
[1:26:41] life always
[1:26:46] unstable never been satisfied by his
[1:26:49] state or
[1:26:52] condition that's why man usually don't
[1:26:54] know what he's after you find a brother

[1:27:02] problem what's going on

[1:27:34] satisfied are you still following
[1:27:37] me that's why brother Bram
[1:27:41] says that state of
[1:27:44] things in that condition that man
[1:27:48] lives it will affect his spiritual
[1:27:51] health and physical health

[1:29:49] satisfied never satisfy
[1:29:56] never reach good
[1:30:00] conclusion never find
[1:30:06] rest this is why many people commit
[1:30:10] suicide here in the United States and
[1:30:13] all over the
[1:30:15] world and they are
[1:30:19] killing
[1:30:21] worries worries

[1:30:52] found state that he was when he left God
[1:30:55] In the Garden of
[1:30:57] Eden and he went and tried to just uh uh
[1:31:02] take care of
[1:31:03] himself that's why you
[1:31:06] find man thought that he doesn't need
[1:31:09] God
[1:31:10] anymore he must do everything
[1:31:13] himself and his
[1:31:16] intelligence so brought him to his own
[1:31:19] destruction a human being who's making a
[1:31:23] weapon
[1:31:24] to kill another human
[1:31:27] being so they are they are making
[1:31:30] weapons it's not to kill or to hunt but
[1:31:34] to kill other human
[1:31:36] being and then life life is a gift of
[1:31:40] God and no one have a right to take
[1:31:43] somebody's
[1:31:45] [Applause]
[1:31:47] life man doesn't want
[1:31:49] God that's why we have all this mess
[1:31:53] and by BR went
[1:32:00] further he says the we can never even
[1:32:03] use God's law in the politic in the
[1:32:05] political world
[1:32:07] today because L because man thinks that
[1:32:11] he himself he can take care of himself
[1:32:14] and by trying to take care of himself
[1:32:16] he's going here and there trying here
[1:32:18] and there and missing the
[1:32:20] point

[1:32:26] himself and he found out that it's a
[1:32:29] difficult way to follow and he looks
[1:32:34] like he doesn't even care about the end
[1:32:37] of his

[1:34:12] amen that's why you
[1:34:15] see when the children of Israel came out
[1:34:18] of
[1:34:20] Egypt God showed them several miracles
[1:34:24] yes amen
[1:34:26] amen great
[1:34:29] wonders but in the
[1:34:32] wilderness a little
[1:34:34] something they forget all the goodness
[1:34:37] of
[1:34:38] God even
[1:34:41] here a child can be really severely
[1:34:45] sick and even the hospital say we can't
[1:34:48] do anything and the pastor pray and then
[1:34:51] everything comes back to normal
[1:34:54] after one month and another child sick
[1:34:57] you forget that miracle and you begin to
[1:35:07] tremble
[1:35:09] isra all the great wonders in
[1:35:12] Egypt listen to me
[1:35:14] carefully God promised to
[1:35:18] Abraham that your
[1:35:21] seed will take care of this land
[1:35:24] I will bless your seed they will take
[1:35:27] care of they will take this land and
[1:35:29] they will go they will sourn in
[1:35:32] slavery and I will pull your people from
[1:35:35] there and when the time
[1:35:38] came God never gave them the
[1:35:42] law God brought them under
[1:35:45] grace and grace provided the
[1:35:48] way and he was by the prophet Moses
[1:35:52] Moses was God's grace on and in the
[1:35:56] wild he was always
[1:35:58] complaining
[1:36:00] complaining and they and they and those
[1:36:03] complaints were so much until Israel
[1:36:06] requested the law but it was not God's
[1:36:08] will to give them the Lord that's what
[1:36:11] brother Bram
[1:36:13] says
[1:36:16] amen
[1:36:18] sometime by our
[1:36:20] attitude we force God
[1:36:23] to give us a permissive
[1:36:25] [Music]
[1:36:27] will that's why
[1:36:29] look when God say
[1:36:32] Abraham you will have a
[1:36:37] son he went to his wife God say we will
[1:36:40] have a
[1:36:42] child one year two five seven
[1:36:49] eight maybe you didn't hear God well
[1:36:53] God wanted to
[1:36:56] say take my younger maid than
[1:37:02] here usually when a woman sin he always
[1:37:05] bring
[1:37:11] death and Abraham went and
[1:37:14] took and when
[1:37:16] is glory to God glory to I have a baby
[1:37:23] God say Abraham this is not what I told
[1:37:28] you
[1:37:31] worries worries will bring you to
[1:37:35] fabricate your own
[1:37:37] way and you will live go
[1:37:40] way that's why many
[1:37:43] times we have many Isel but
[1:37:48] [Applause]
[1:37:50] never why
[1:37:54] impatient
[1:37:56] impatient impatient so much
[1:37:59] worries oh I have
[1:38:02] patience because worries will eat up
[1:38:05] your patience it will eat up your
[1:38:12] faith and you find man making his own
[1:38:15] ways oh thank you Jesus Oh the child is
[1:38:18] born Abraham this is not what I said
[1:38:23] shut
[1:38:24] up you
[1:38:28] know when a promise take
[1:38:31] longer God usually give you
[1:38:35] time but when unbelief get
[1:38:38] in by
[1:38:42] worries you usually delay the
[1:38:45] Fulfillment of the
[1:38:50] promise that's why Israel took so long
[1:38:52] in the
[1:38:54] they should have done three days and
[1:38:56] make it to the promised land and they
[1:38:58] took 40 years 40 years in the
[1:39:02] wilderness why that generation must be
[1:39:04] wiped up those generation of Fighters
[1:39:08] have to be completely wiped
[1:39:12] up that's why you see today in message
[1:39:15] you see
[1:39:17] war in the message
[1:39:21] churches and you will notice
[1:39:24] the pastor is
[1:39:25] here he he talk to
[1:39:28] people uh to to to work with him in the
[1:39:32] ministry after six month they want to be
[1:39:35] like a
[1:39:39] pastor that's why when that woman went
[1:39:42] to see
[1:39:43] Jesus I want my children one of them to
[1:39:46] sit on the right hand and they Jesus
[1:39:52] say can can they drink off the same Cup
[1:39:55] in other
[1:39:56] words are you going to go through the
[1:39:58] persecution like oh yes we can do it he
[1:40:02] said yes that's true but when he comes
[1:40:05] to the position that is up to the
[1:40:10] father amen
[1:40:13] amen
[1:40:15] [Music]
[1:40:17] amen that's why we have all the trouble
[1:40:20] everything going wrong
[1:40:23] in the
[1:40:27] message because people love to be
[1:40:30] Pastors in this
[1:40:35] message listen to me
[1:40:39] carefully I went to several churches and
[1:40:42] I found that those churches are only
[1:40:47] Workshop they are not churches it's just
[1:40:50] shopping
[1:40:54] he say when you become serious with God
[1:40:57] God will be serious with
[1:40:59] [Applause]
[1:41:02] you if
[1:41:05] only we can get away from this little
[1:41:10] facet so that
[1:41:12] God maybe he will do
[1:41:14] it maybe I believe I hope he will do it
[1:41:17] oh you know he
[1:41:20] promised that's the way we want to
[1:41:22] believe
[1:41:23] that it means
[1:41:27] this bring your
[1:41:30] thoughts bring your
[1:41:33] [Music]
[1:41:34] will below the will of God let the will
[1:41:37] of God come and dwell in
[1:41:40] you when we pray we
[1:41:42] say th will be done on on Heaven as as
[1:41:46] on Earth and brother says the will of
[1:41:51] God
[1:41:53] sometime doesn't match our
[1:41:56] will it might be even sometime contrary
[1:41:59] to your
[1:42:03] desire amen amen

[1:43:14] Fe killing
[1:43:17] murder and sometime it will lead to
[1:43:21] suicide
[1:43:24] this is
[1:43:26] what this is the spectacle that we see
[1:43:30] all around all the wars it's just about
[1:43:33] interest
[1:43:35] interest it is just a war of
[1:43:38] Interest after

[1:45:01] generally popularity will lead to sin
[1:45:05] and
[1:45:06] shame

[1:59:56] fire you don't understand what you're
[1:59:59] doing
[2:00:02] hallelujah look at these human
[2:00:05] beings I ask myself
[2:00:08] questions
[2:00:10] maybe they don't have a heavenly father
[2:00:13] that watch over them like his watching
[2:00:16] over as Red Robin
[2:00:24] Red
[2:00:26] Robin they were not created in the image
[2:00:29] of
[2:00:30] God
[2:00:32] God never spoke to the
[2:00:34] angel that you would take my place it is
[2:00:37] only man can take the place of God
[2:00:41] because man was made in the image of God
[2:00:43] and he gave him a domain and he told man
[2:00:47] that you are the god of the earth and
[2:00:49] I'm the god of the universe
[2:00:57] giv you the responsibility to preach the
[2:00:59] gospel to distribute his
[2:01:02] thoughts but not the greed
[2:01:06] Robin That's why Red Robin are asking
[2:01:08] themselves
[2:01:09] questions it's it's almost the same
[2:01:13] brother Bram say you never heard
[2:01:15] of you never heard
[2:01:18] of you never heard of a red robing with
[2:01:22] high blood
[2:01:24] pressure let me ask you a question you
[2:01:26] who have pet when did you take your pet
[2:01:29] to the hospital for high blood pressure
[2:01:31] show
[2:01:32] me all your chicken or something to the
[2:01:35] hospital for high blood
[2:01:37] pressure did you ever see a vet doctor
[2:01:40] looking at your dog and say that's a
[2:01:42] high blood
[2:01:47] pressure have you heard a chicken with
[2:01:49] high blood pressure your cat
[2:01:58] see no no no
[2:02:03] no you would never hear a car an
[2:02:06] ambulance car going to get a red
[2:02:08] [Music]
[2:02:10] H they always live following the way
[2:02:15] that God provided for them it is always
[2:02:18] as human that behave bad
[2:02:22] from all the creation of
[2:02:25] God I mean
[2:02:28] Earth only man that has been rebellious
[2:02:31] all the
[2:02:33] time he received such a great
[2:02:37] privilege to be made in the image of
[2:02:40] God because but it's the most rebellious
[2:02:46] creature that's why brother Bram say
[2:02:48] nature is groaning for the manifestation
[2:02:50] of the sons of God
[2:02:53] because uh fish die uh bird
[2:02:58] die and animal die and uh bany life die
[2:03:03] and they ask themselves a
[2:03:05] question we didn't do
[2:03:08] anything until when we will continue to
[2:03:11] die until when our Master will get back
[2:03:14] to his
[2:03:15] position so that we can stop being I
[2:03:19] mean
[2:03:20] dying that's why brother I'm
[2:03:23] saying everything that live have a
[2:03:27] spirit even animal have Spirit even
[2:03:31] trees
[2:03:33] have that's why you will see magician
[2:03:36] and wites they work with all this kind
[2:03:38] of stuff because there is Spirit to that
[2:03:41] that's why brother
[2:03:42] says God will never live without a
[2:03:48] witness
[2:03:50] amen everything you do there is a
[2:03:53] witness
[2:03:54] somewhere Somebody's
[2:03:57] Watching amen
[2:04:00] amen that's why your pet is watching you
[2:04:03] he doesn't understand your chicken is
[2:04:05] looking at you they don't understand you
[2:04:08] I was
[2:04:10] saying even dogs
[2:04:13] today they are so
[2:04:16] amazed the way human being are treating
[2:04:20] them God gave a
[2:04:23] law because everything in the word is
[2:04:25] under law there is a law of
[2:04:29] reproduction every every kind after its
[2:04:34] own but today man is marrying a dog to
[2:04:39] break the law of God so the dog is the
[2:04:41] dog is looking like what is
[2:04:47] wrong I went one day in our
[2:04:49] country there were two vill
[2:04:52] fighting and they were killing each
[2:04:55] other two Villages over there they were
[2:04:59] living neighboring
[2:05:01] Village so the people of this Village
[2:05:04] could not go to that one and that one
[2:05:05] not going to the
[2:05:07] other and then uh the stat sent military
[2:05:10] and people there
[2:05:13] sold even some of the religious leader
[2:05:16] went there to reconcile them it never
[2:05:19] worked I went there
[2:05:23] it was not me it was God that sent me
[2:05:24] there I went
[2:05:26] there and I asked the
[2:05:30] brother I say please I want you to build
[2:05:34] uh I mean a conference place in the
[2:05:36] middle of the both of of of the two
[2:05:39] Villages so when I begin to preach in
[2:05:41] the middle of the Lord the people from
[2:05:44] this Village came and they stood on that
[2:05:46] face and the other one came and they
[2:05:49] stood on their
[2:05:50] side and all of them are watching me and
[2:05:54] I told them I say
[2:05:56] God made man in his own
[2:06:00] image and made him a master of
[2:06:02] everything that is in the
[2:06:04] world
[2:06:06] now you the
[2:06:09] Masters you are quarreling stra
[2:06:12] everything back Bing each
[2:06:14] other and then you broke
[2:06:17] Fellowship now I'm going to ask you a
[2:06:19] question both of you both sides
[2:06:22] the people of this Village don't go to
[2:06:23] that Village the people of the village B
[2:06:26] don't go to Village a I say but s but
[2:06:30] but
[2:06:31] surprisingly I see that your dog your
[2:06:34] pet are going to one Village to the
[2:06:36] other and they don't have any
[2:06:38] problem I see your goat moving from one
[2:06:41] Village to another Village and your
[2:06:42] chicken are leaving the village to the
[2:06:44] other Village I see the dog of this
[2:06:47] place they go get their mate to the
[2:06:49] other Village they get married there and
[2:06:51] then the the the the rooster over there
[2:06:55] are chasing the hand over
[2:06:58] there why didn't you stop them from
[2:07:01] meeting each other why didn't you stop
[2:07:04] your Beast to meet each
[2:07:06] other say if you can do
[2:07:09] that they will accuse you to God if you
[2:07:12] try they will say
[2:07:14] Lord the people that you give us like
[2:07:18] Master they don't understand the purpose
[2:07:21] that you gave
[2:07:22] them they divided separated themselves
[2:07:26] and they want to separate our fellowship
[2:07:27] two
[2:07:29] animals and
[2:07:32] suddenly I begin to see them moving
[2:07:34] closer and they other one begin to move
[2:07:36] closer and they begin to move closer
[2:07:39] before you know it when I
[2:07:42] say who want to believe the Lord Jesus
[2:07:44] Christ I come from word of baptism all
[2:07:47] of them mixed together they came to the
[2:07:49] word of baptism
[2:07:59] and what did God
[2:08:01] do to show that it was God who sent
[2:08:04] me they went and get a
[2:08:10] woman uh who was uh who contracted
[2:08:15] HIV and they sent her from the city back
[2:08:18] to the Village so she can die over there
[2:08:20] she could not walk and everything
[2:08:22] so they brought me the woman I pray for
[2:08:24] her and God completely healed her until
[2:08:28] today she's
[2:08:31] alive and they went together to the
[2:08:34] world of
[2:08:35] baptism and I called the
[2:08:37] chief uh from this side and the chief
[2:08:41] and the Elder of and I say come together

[2:10:11] that uh uh progress the
[2:10:15] progress it's in that uh progress that
[2:10:19] also sin also is progressing

[2:10:51] amen
[2:10:54] amen do not be changed and molded by
[2:10:57] man's
[2:10:59] civilization I won't go too far
[2:11:02] anymore because I'm going to go straight
[2:11:04] to the
[2:11:05] point I'm going to read this brother
[2:11:07] says this in the
[2:11:10] sermon my life
[2:11:12] story I don't have a paragraph it's just
[2:11:15] the story so it comes from the voice of
[2:11:18] God brother Bram says this
[2:11:22] uh page
[2:11:23] 26 because
[2:11:27] here brother Bram is explaining to us
[2:11:29] his life with his
[2:11:31] wife they have a very modest
[2:11:34] life they had a small house with two
[2:11:37] story
[2:11:38] building he was only his rent was $4 a
[2:11:42] month at that time $4 a
[2:11:45] month and brother Bram say you he was a
[2:11:47] St TW story there was almost nothing
[2:11:52] but but they were
[2:11:54] happy and brother Bram is saying
[2:11:56] something he say I understand this
[2:12:00] that's
[2:12:03] happiness doesn't consist of the amount
[2:12:06] of worldly stuff you
[2:12:09] process but in the
[2:12:13] satisfaction that you get with what has
[2:12:16] been given to you in other words a
[2:12:20] Christian
[2:12:22] he's always happy of his State God
[2:12:27] say I will never leave you in other
[2:12:32] words bring your problem to God he will
[2:12:36] take care of you don't force anything
[2:12:40] don't push you will
[2:12:42] produce we are working because the bible
[2:12:46] say that if you don't work you won't eat
[2:12:52] but don't try to get rich before the
[2:12:55] time God will give you money but wait
[2:12:58] for God to give you in his time God give
[2:13:01] worldly stuff worldly material stuff but
[2:13:04] wait for the
[2:13:07] time don't be don't try to be like
[2:13:09] brother so and so I was telling the
[2:13:13] brother I say you today you today you
[2:13:17] are envying me H you want to be like me
[2:13:20] it's
[2:13:22] good but can you take the road I took
[2:13:24] before I get where I am with all the
[2:13:27] trial I went through before you want to
[2:13:29] be like brother St do you know how he
[2:13:32] suffered to be here all so go through
[2:13:35] the same
[2:13:40] way don't burn step and take
[2:13:45] shortcut don't Che a short cut and
[2:13:49] search for a quick solution is oh when
[2:13:52] you go to the shortcut Ishmael you will
[2:13:55] produce
[2:14:01] isma believer let's follow God's Prophet
[2:14:06] advice I'm going to read something
[2:14:09] here in
[2:14:11] Watchmen what the
[2:14:14] night it's uh November the 30th 1958
[2:14:18] paragraph 30 listen to what brother say
[2:14:22] paragraph
[2:14:23] 13 let me check the time now oh my
[2:14:28] God he say none of
[2:14:31] us is immune against
[2:14:35] problems that's
[2:14:37] why we are not different
[2:14:39] from they die we die they get sick we
[2:14:42] get sick sometime they even get wealth
[2:14:45] we don't have but what is the difference
[2:14:48] we are in the promise but they don't
[2:14:51] have the promise after death it's
[2:14:55] already but we after death we going to
[2:15:00] Glory this is what he he say none of us
[2:15:04] is immune from
[2:15:06] trouble God never
[2:15:10] promised to exempt us from all
[2:15:13] sicknesses God never said when you
[2:15:16] believe in me never sick you won't have
[2:15:19] any problem
[2:15:21] so how are you going to know the power
[2:15:22] of God if you don't have trouble how
[2:15:25] will you know the power of God how are
[2:15:28] you going to have a testimony you
[2:15:30] don't how are you going to appreciate
[2:15:32] his power his
[2:15:35] [Applause]
[2:15:37] love but it is
[2:15:40] written his strength is
[2:15:44] sufficient and God will never bring
[2:15:47] something upon you that is more than you
[2:15:51] can
[2:15:52] bear
[2:15:54] therefore it's a consolation a comfort
[2:15:57] for us to know that to know
[2:16:02] that it's a comfort for us to know
[2:16:08] that things trouble will come they must
[2:16:12] come that's why he
[2:16:14] say in the seven Church ages I didn't
[2:16:17] read brother Bram say character
[2:16:21] is not a gift it's a
[2:16:24] victory and you won't have the
[2:16:26] victory without a fight and you won't
[2:16:30] have a fighter without an enemy and our
[2:16:33] enemy common enemies the devil and know
[2:16:39] this that the true war
[2:16:41] starts the true
[2:16:45] War start when you get the Holy
[2:16:49] Ghost this is when
[2:16:51] double
[2:16:53] attacks he even increased the attack
[2:16:57] that's why you will
[2:16:58] see H many time I have counseling with
[2:17:03] Brothers
[2:17:04] Pastor since I'm in the message nothing
[2:17:06] is
[2:17:07] working the children are getting sick
[2:17:10] and nothing is working I try this
[2:17:12] business it's not working I try this is
[2:17:13] not working oh before I get to the
[2:17:16] message everything was fine I just look
[2:17:19] at him
[2:17:21] when he finish all his complaint I say
[2:17:24] ah
[2:17:25] brother so
[2:17:27] today I
[2:17:30] understand that God love you so
[2:17:34] much when I say that they say pastor
[2:17:37] pastor
[2:17:38] [Applause]
[2:17:41] Pastor I say but brother I see that God
[2:17:44] love you so much he
[2:17:47] say Pastor suffering like this you say
[2:17:50] God L me
[2:17:52] I say trial trial and test it's
[2:17:58] what it is a manifestation of the love
[2:18:01] of
[2:18:02] God and I told the
[2:18:05] church when a child goes to
[2:18:08] school he won't go to the next level
[2:18:12] until he goes through the
[2:18:14] test and every time you go through
[2:18:16] another Lev they increase and they make
[2:18:20] things more
[2:18:22] when you go to the
[2:18:24] university you will see the math is more
[2:18:26] harder in
[2:18:28] University and the test become very very
[2:18:31] hard
[2:18:32] tough and you are sweaty why that's why
[2:18:37] the more you you growing in the Lord the
[2:18:40] more your test level is
[2:18:43] increasing the more the
[2:18:45] trial your trial goes with your
[2:18:48] spiritual level
[2:18:51] so be
[2:18:54] happy when you going through test be
[2:18:57] happy
[2:19:01] especially if you know that you are
[2:19:03] living the perfect will of God be
[2:19:05] happy then you see Tri keep multiply and
[2:19:09] problem keep coming one after the
[2:19:12] other you look you everything is in is
[2:19:15] is in order in your
[2:19:17] life it's a proof that God lovees you
[2:19:23] amen
[2:19:25] amen why
[2:19:28] worry that's why brother
[2:19:31] say you cannot change the color of your
[2:19:34] eyes or make it blue or
[2:19:37] what if you are one I mean
[2:19:40] 6ot and you want to be I mean 11t can
[2:19:44] you do
[2:19:49] that so if you can't be 11 why just
[2:19:54] submit to the will of
[2:19:56] God that's why brother Bram says this

[2:20:07] flashlight of his

[2:21:37] live I will have less and less
[2:21:40] friends and I know that one day I will
[2:21:43] go and listen to what he say and I hope
[2:21:47] that
[2:21:48] God will never let
[2:21:51] Satan Crown me to make
[2:21:56] me an old man with a bad
[2:22:00] attitude in other words an old man when

[2:25:07] will we have nothing to teach
[2:25:10] God we we just have to accept God's way
[2:25:13] of doing
[2:25:16] things I know that these things will
[2:25:19] continue to get
[2:25:21] until you as as you growing old it's
[2:25:24] always like that but I
[2:25:27] believe one thing that is most horrible
[2:25:31] is when
[2:25:32] Satan CR the life of
[2:25:36] somebody give you a man an old man or an
[2:25:40] old woman that is very
[2:25:42] bad I believe that I won't reach that
[2:25:46] point I will not I believe that I cannot
[2:25:51] I will always bear my burden and and
[2:25:54] which point that I want my life to be by
[2:25:58] the glory of God all
[2:26:02] his his loving kindness patience all the
[2:26:05] time his uh kindness his uh peace his
[2:26:10] kindness and to be filled with the Holy
[2:26:15] Spirit that's why I always speak to my
[2:26:18] church
[2:26:23] in this life you will always have an
[2:26:27] enemy because your father have
[2:26:30] enemies the one who didn't like your
[2:26:32] father won't like
[2:26:35] you therefore
[2:26:38] you don't be an enemy to anyone don't
[2:26:42] hate
[2:26:44] anyone don't have any grudges against
[2:26:48] anyone amen
[2:26:51] brother says
[2:26:55] this live for that man that hat
[2:26:59] you that day on
[2:27:01] Calvary paragraph
[2:27:05] 88 leave for that man that could kill
[2:27:08] you if he had a
[2:27:09] chance that's what they did to him they
[2:27:12] kill
[2:27:13] him and he died so that he can save them
[2:27:18] that's what eternal life is all about
[2:27:21] and when that get into your
[2:27:23] heart then you are looking at Heaven
[2:27:27] straight giving it to sacrifice
[2:27:29] everything that
[2:27:31] you and you give it as a lamp giving it
[2:27:35] wool that's where brother Bram says that
[2:27:39] God I didn't read that quote because I
[2:27:41] have to
[2:27:42] spell God don't
[2:27:46] want that everything in your life must
[2:27:49] work always right God doesn't like it
[2:27:53] that you know the brother that you
[2:27:55] looking like everything is going good
[2:27:58] for their life their business are good
[2:28:00] they are flourishing that brother that
[2:28:02] you
[2:28:04] envy you might look you say I want to be
[2:28:07] like Joe Biden or
[2:28:08] Trump but if they give you the place of
[2:28:11] Joe Biden you run away all the problem
[2:28:14] he have with that
[2:28:17] Prosperity that's why brother say
[2:28:20] God don't
[2:28:22] want that everything must work good in
[2:28:25] your life all the
[2:28:26] time look at isra when they were in
[2:28:32] Egypt when the Pharaoh that did not know
[2:28:34] Joseph
[2:28:36] came it was the time that the SE of the
[2:28:39] Amorite
[2:28:41] reaches and then and that
[2:28:44] Pharaoh
[2:28:46] multip suffering on Israel
[2:28:51] it is God that allowed
[2:28:53] us it was to put into Israel The Thirst
[2:28:58] to go back to their
[2:29:00] country so everything you see
[2:29:03] uncomfortable Tri
[2:29:07] difficulties does don't want you to get
[2:29:09] used to this easy life everything that
[2:29:12] happen to you it isow by God it is to
[2:29:16] teach you
[2:29:16] [Music]
