========================================

the jews through water preach before the gospel unto abraham abraham himself was a hidden amen god didn't preach the promise to isaac [Applause] that's why paul said abraham the father of us all right here he said and unto abraham saying indeed shall all water not only israel nation plural be water this is the gospel god preached to abraham that's the sermon god gave abraham he preached the gospel which gospel indeed shall all nation be saved that's the gospel amen hallelujah so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham you hear me now to abraham and his seed singular where the promises made he says not and to seeds as of many but as of water and to that seed which is who so these children are crushed everybody here this christ here is one person but he is not one person [Applause] do you hear me do you hear me i'm going slowly this christ is one person but he is not one person amen you hear me because when adam was created we saw adam alone walking on the earth ever here but adam was not alone [Music] [Music] he was adam who called eve eve god never called eve eve when god saw if he said adam [Applause] here before adam was created in the flesh i had adam was already doubled in the spirit everybody here the bible said let us create men one man but when they created that man that man was double anybody here ever here and when god saw that adam was the lord god put adam to sleep here and opened the side of adam and pulled another individual from adam here and created eve was not another creation it was a part of adam everybody so when christ also came on the cross of calvary they pierced jesus christ on the side bringing water and blood showing that somebody is getting both ever here so this seed is one person but it's not one person it's a person with his wife [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah let's see what brother branham says here brother branham said notice the first was by a bound woman didn't look anything like the promise that's ishmael god say god don't have to take back his word for nobody god say how he would come and that is the way you shall come god said through sarah through sarah sarah anticipated and tried to bring it another way he brought the trouble but sarah being a representative of the church top of the church it she found out there that she said well i believe this is a little too phenomenal i just can't even believe in that so you can so you go get haga and you take her for a wife see there that stock didn't look like the promise at all but when sarah came forth now that looked pretty good it looks a whole lot more like the promised day but still it was not the genuine promise did you hear that when we look at ismail we quickly disqualify him when we look at the children of keturah we quickly them but when we look at isaac this is where we have trouble because isaac god already promised a child to isaac and we have a tendency to think that isaac was the promising and brother branham said genuinely he was not ever here because we show you on wednesday ever here that one god when told abraham go take isaac and take him to the mountain and go ahead and sacrifice isaac isaac was never sacrified [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah brother branham why but still he was not the genuine promise why because israel in who fell and denied the water that's why jesus said you are of your father the devil [Music] because if he was in isaac all the jews should recognize jesus christ but not all the jews accepted jesus christ amen and matter of fact the jews were the one that crucified jesus everybody here brother branham continued he said in isaac fell and denied the genuine seed when he come on hallelujah don't get excited don't run that won't hurt you everybody deny the seed indeed what and hung him on the water brother bonham is saying if isaac was the true seed the children of isaac should not crucify the messiah but the children of isaac crucified the messiah showing that even isaac is disqualified [Music] are we okay that's why when god told abraham take isaac and go sacrifice him when abraham was to the point to kill us a god stop him he said that is not the promise everybody here and god created the promise in type [Music] here he created a realm [Applause] [Music] was not born by sex showing that the messiah will not be born by sex [Applause] here that realm have no father no mother [Music] [Applause] and god didn't create a lamb amen a ramen is a lamb but i have horner [Applause] you hear me it's a mature lamb that's why the bible says jesus christ was a man child it's a baby but that baby is a man [Applause] do you know the scripture the bible says a man child it's a child but it's a man was speaking about the zodiac [Music] which was demonstrating that he will be born in a prayer [Applause] [Music] was born like all lamb sir he was born in water and he had to be born under there because he was ill and women were water he was born under that realm that is what he was he was god's realm that was him up there that took water [Applause] hallelujah are we okay are we okay it could not have been crash birthdays not this crazy christmas it just absolutely could not happen he had to be born in macho april because the zodiac overlapped because he was dilemma and he was a male sheep and he was born under the ram what ever here so by creating a realm god was also telling you that he won't be born in april [Music] hallelujah he had to be and sheep are not born in december sheep are born in the spring and then another thing the heels of judea now they are 20 feet of snow now how could the shepherd have been out there ever here so that realm was speaking of christ the only thing that happened to the ram they have to hold him by the horn they have to block his power because what about them say horn represented power they have to block his power [Music] my father my father why have that ever here i'm trying to fight but i can't fight because you took the pillar fire out of me you block me by the horn now i must be killed because you block me by the horn [Music] hallelujah hallelujah so that promised son disqualify isaac now we know who the promised seed is amen blessed be the name of the lord the children of the promised promised water what kind of a promise that god promised before the water he called them not him he called them that's the seed not because you quit doing this and quit doing that and quit lying and quit sleep stealing that is just more a lot a good citizen will do that you can't call yourself a christian yet until something has happened where until you are regenerated something that happened in here everybody here everybody that's why when he met abraham he gave him bread and wine america after the battle he's over now kissing himself his victorious child think of that part of himself here in tap here is in view the communion after the battle he gave of himself because the communion is part of water everybody here so melchizedek by bringing communion he's a priesthood that impart his life into the one that believed on him amen amen amen did you hear me did you hear me let me start it again everybody we're trying to find who is the priest because we're trying to find who is the high priest here but we found out this melchizedek by bringing bread and wine he's bringing a part of himself and putting into a human being he did it with abraham in types of bread and wine which is communion hallelujah i read this on wednesday so let's get to this in psalm chapter 85 remember he is the king of water selem and the king of water two kings here in psalm 85 verse 10 the bible says mercy and truth are met together [Music] anybody here righteousness and water melchizedek is king of righteousness and melchizedek is king of peace i'm reading to you the scripture everybody here so righteousness and peace did what in melchizedek [Music] when he comes to you he bring two things together before he even gives you communion his first king of righteousness and second king of peace then after that he produced the communion amen [Music] righteousness and peace have kissed each other in melchizedek let's go to isaiah 32 my god verse one you should be there already because i told you to open your scripture there verse one behold a king shall reign in water who's that king of righteousness hey and princes shall rule in judgment verse two and a man shall be a water so when do you say hiding place it's not a place now it is a man remember charlotte was a place but shallow became a man anybody here are we okay now a hiding place is not a place naturally but he becomes a man so if you enter in the man you are lost from the radar the gps of the devil is lost here he said a man shall be a hiding place from the wind and a covered or a shelter from the tempest as rivers of water ever here in a dry water so that man is reverse of water he is a shelter he is your protection ever here and as a shadow of a great rock because he's himself a rock in a weary land so when this man comes it depends on your situation you're in a weary land he knows how to handle that you are in trouble he knows you need protection he knows this king of righteousness america job two verse three and the eyes of them that see shall not be watered and the ear of them that he shall hearken the heart of the rush shall understand knowledge and the tongue of the stemmer shall be ready to speak plainly so when this king comes to you he's bringing healing with him do you follow me because malachi 4 say that the son of righteousness will rise up with healing in his wings so when you meet him like that he have a healing are we okay i want you to stay awake and you get this let's go to verse 15 now it's on the board if you don't want to turn up because some of you don't want to look at it yeah when i say turn to your bible i see some people looking at me verse 15 everybody here watch now until the water until the spirit be watered on us from where until the baptism of the holy spirit is come did you follow me until the spirit be poured upon us from on high and the water hallelujah let me get this one we found two places here there is a place that is a wilderness everybody wilderness that's number one and there is a second place the bible says then their wilderness be a fruitful and the fruitful field be counted for a forest there is two places one is a wilderness one is a fruitful place here follow me very carefully anybody care when the spirit is poured down on a place remember place is a person you got it now you got it now when a spirit is poured down in a place depending on the condition of that place are we okay if the place is the wilderness the coming down of the spirit on that place will turn that place into water a fruitful field everybody here this fruitful field is a fruitful field created by the spirit it was not there before anybody care about here and if the spirit comes and found a fruitful field without the spirit [Music] do you hear me you hear me when he comes on that place what was look like a fruitful field would be water won't be canted not will be a forest but would be counted as a forest let me read it slowly [Music] well wilderness be a fruitful field this is a transformation from wilderness into a fruitful field here but the fruitful place filled will be counted as so when you look at what you thought was a fruitful place before the coming of the spirit it will look like a forest a place where wild things can grow did you hear me did i lose anybody if i lost you raise your hand [Music] did you get it so when the spirit comes in your life everybody here you have strong part and weaknesses back here the coming down of the spirit on you will make your weakness turn into a fruitful place [Music] did you hear me and the coming down of that spirit will make what you taught as it was fruitful look foolish [Music] relax keep your finger towards anyway it's right here go to the book of art go to acts 22 hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord if we cross this place then we going quickly [Music] if you dare you can say amen act 22 verse 3 there was a man called paul we know paul the apostle let's go to verse 3. you there paul say i am verily a man which i am a jew he's claiming that born in texas a city of silesia yet brought up in this city at the feet of gamaliel a strong man he's bragging about his education before the coming of the spirit okay before the coming of the spirit this is a fruitful field that has been pumped by gamaliel anybody here you okay now he begin to clarify we okay okay verse uh uh three and thought according to the perfect manner of the law of the father and was zealous toward who as you all are this day paul is telling them i was just like you but if you are zealous toward god what was wrong with that because it was a fruitful field hey mark here jump to verse 4 and i persecuted with that zeal i persecuted this way to the death bonding and delivering into prison both men and women as also the high priest does bear me witness and all the estate of the elder i have a backup from everybody backing me up supporting me from whom also i received letter to the brethren and went to damascus to bring them which were their bond to jerusalem for to be punished and he came to pass that as i made my journey and was come near to damascus about noon suddenly they shone from heaven and water round about me i have all this qualification i was jealous toward god i was fruitful and i was producing fruit to prove to god that i'm standing for the law i'm fighting for the law and i'm going to kill all the heretics a fruitful field before the coming of the spirit anybody here jump to verse 12 and one ananias a development according to the law having a good report of all the jews which dwell there came to me and stood and said to me brother so receive your sight and the same hour i look up i'll look up upon him in other words my eyes open everybody verse 14. and he said the god of our father has chosen you that you should know his will and see that just one and should hear the voice of his mouth everybody for you shall be a witness here to all men of what you have seen and do whatever a man that persecuted when christ came he's changing into a powerful witness for god until the spirit come if he doesn't come the wilderness remain like wilderness and the fruitful will continue to be fruitful but when he comes the wilderness change and what you talk fruitful becomes something else relax go to first timothy chapter 1 [Music] blessed be the name of the lord because you need to understand the power of melchizedek melchizedek is not just a thought just talking about melchizedek melchizedek is a lot of stuff here first timothy chapter 1 verse 12. if you dare you can say amen bear with me we still have time so relax sometimes you drive into this kind of stuff you feel like it's eternity and when you come up oh i thought we went too far yeah yeah all right verse 12. you're there and i thank christ jesus our lord who has enabled me for that he counted me how oh i thought paul was faithful failed now he's counted as faithful putting me into the ministry watch verse 30 13. who was before a what i thought over there he was zealous for god now we begin to see the wilderness we begin to see the wilderness what he showed us there was the faithful field now we are looking at the wilderness of paul i was a blasphemer and a persecutor and a walter oh i thought paul was zealous for god this is the wilderness angels but i obtain mercy because i did it ignorantly in water if he was in unbelief he was his sin he was a sinner yet a religious sinner a sinner that knows the scripture if i preach this in the message a sinner in the message they know the message but they are sinner they even preach the message but they are sinners they don't have the revelation of the message they are preaching [Music] that's why you see their life it shock you i thought he was a preacher he's the one acting like this ever here verse 14 and the grace of our lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in christ everybody which is in christ jesus this is a faithful saying and worthy of our acceptation that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners of water i am water oh my god so paul now is saying i was not religious i was a sinner and i was not even a sinner i was the top of the sinner a man that just bragged that he was under the feet of gamaliel he grew up under ministry in the message see them look at the acting singer still battling prejudice backbiting all this kind of stuff [Music] [Music] however verse 16 for this course i obtain mercy that in me first jesus christ must show forth our long suffering for a pattern to them which should hear after belief on him to everlasting life now i become an example of a religious sinner that when i see others they can begin to learn from me that being in the church doesn't mean you're a christian anybody here verse 17 now to the king eterna without father or mother immortal invisible the only wise god deity be honor and glory forever and ever amen [Applause] now paul when the spirit comes upon him he understands he was a wilderness and what he thought fruitful let's see what paul says they are now [Music] go to philippians 3 go to philippians 3 paul tellers and this will not happen in your life until the spirit comes down until melchizedek they come down and bring you communion you will think you right you will think you strong right [Music] nothing but the truth but when melchizedek comes he take your weaknesses and strengthen you and what you thought was big you begin you became humble you understand that i was nobody i was actually a sinner it takes a reaching melchizedek let's go to philippians 3 if you're there you can say amen philippians 3 verse 4. i want everybody to see this you there god i might also have confidence in the what if any other man thinks that he has wear-off he might trust in the flesh i more in other words if you wanna show us how you a big shot meepo i can show you more i have a fruitful field that i thought was fruit fulfilled until christ came then i realized but if you want me to show you my fruitful field i will show you we were with so and so we slept with the same bed we were in convention so and so we did they can tell you all the stories they become politician in the message [Music] church this isn't game time anymore enough enough of playing on the pulpit enough [Music] everybody either you believe the message or you don't believe it don't stay in the message for benefit don't stay in the message because he pays money because the people in the message pay path you better go get money outside [Music] if i leave the message then i won't have the time and the puppy to preach go leave the message instead of staying acting like you believe it and when they bring they caught you finding the coat [Music] hallelujah verse five circumcise the eighth day i met you fruit fulfilled comma of the stock of israel comma of the tribe of benjamin curriculum vitae and hebrew of the hebrews look at how powerful i was let me brag on you what i was before a hebrew of the hebrew as touching the law of pharisee concerning zeal water persecuting the church watch carefully watch carefully brother greg saw it you ready you ready touching the water which righteousness the righteousness of melchizedek touching the righteousness which is off there i was water you cannot point that finger like this in the message they know how to talk among the people they know when believers are there they know how to behave and to show you their servant of christ they know that forced humility had to play around with them they can't even laugh louder so you can see that they are servant of god [Music] you see what we're dealing with you see what we're dealing with ever here concern the righteousness of the lord they are what paul was blameless ever here look at how big a fruitful food power was you ready read with me verse seven but what things were what [Applause] those are content what when i met melchizedek [Music] they all became nothing there is something when you meet melchizedek that things changes oh i counted loss for christ everybody here verse 8 year adopt lesson and account of things but what for the excellency of the knowledge of who my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of water and i do cut them back water their fruitful faith is counted now as dung because the spirit was poured down on paul ever here that i may win who and be found in him ever here watch this not having my water [Music] but here now not having my own righteousness which is off there but that which is through what the spiritual seed my friend look at the board the righteousness which comes by spiritual field back here the righteousness which is of faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by what let me go back now until the spirit be poured down on high the wilderness will be fruitful and the fruits will be content as what then judgment shall dwell in the and the righteousness shall remain in water and the work of righteousness shall be what he is a king of righteousness and the king of water the work of righteousness is first by interpretation king of righteousness then king of peace because the work of righteousness will follow by peace so king of selem will follow you later by king of peace because the work of righteousness produces peace is king of righteousness to justify you first then put you in peace with god then he can bring you communion hallelujah and the effect of righteousness be water and assurance for what and my people shall dwell in a peaceful water and ensure dwelling and in a quiet resting water king of righteousness king of peace romans 14 for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but water and water melchizedek is the kingdom of god [Music] but here the kingdom of god is righteousness and peace melchizedek where enjoy in the water that's why you heard jesus saying the kingdom is with you and the kingdom is within you [Music] the kingdom is with you because i am melchizedek but the kingdom will be with you when i will be entering you [Music] hallelujah let's dig on melchizedek you ready i'm still good on top for those who worry about here now one melchizedek the king of selem the priest of the most high the king of peace which was none other than the water of the lord who when they say fall part it's the first step into something in other words from god everybody to jesus [Music] you hear me there is a step here did you hear me number one is god the invisible nobody can see god god is a spirit here number three the only begotten who was in the bosom of the father have declared him now philip when you see me you see who you see god me and my father are but in between the flesh of god and the spirit of god there is a step here that was a mystery in the beginning was there and the word was with and the word was and the word dwell among us we was made flesh so the step that missed here is the step of the world which is the fall part this is where melchizedek lies it is god immortal into the world before he becomes flesh are we okay my god when jesus was manifested in the old testament in a water in a person of water not a priesthood but the person the man for this man yet not been born the man jesus but he was in a theophany so he had no father no mother he was god himself he was manifested in the form of man called king of selem which is king of peace and king of righteousness see he was melchizedek he had neither father nor mother beginning of days or ending of life it was jesus in heaven everybody here god left jesus left here and enter here then he became here me and you did one tree [Music] and we left our number two ever care so far if therefore perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what father need was there that another priest should rise after the order of melchizedek and not be called after the order of aaron why do we need another priest if we already got perfection but we know the law can bring nothing to perfection for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity exchanges of the law for he of whom these things are spoken keep this in mind pretend to another tribe in which no man gave attendance to the altar for it is evident that our lord sprung out of judah of which tribe moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood he was sealed [Music] here the first true king of israel was david because saul came by the wheel of the people he was not the will of god and saul was from the tribe of benjamin not judah the kings must come by judah ever here and when david came he began to do stuff like a priest [Applause] anybody here hallelujah it is yet far more evident that after the simulated remember on wednesday of melchizedek there are another priest who lived forever what are you trying to say hallelujah get it now amen listen carefully verse verse 23 and they surely were many priests because they were not soft they were not suffered to continue by reason of water in the levitical pursuit we have so many priests the reason why they have many priests because of death because a priest will grow and die so they gotta renew him and he died and they got to put another one but mercy said that he doesn't die [Music] about in other words the levitical priesthood had replacement because of death but melchizedek priesthood have a power of endless life it's a priesthood that doesn't die so it's a priesthood that you cannot replace so if it's a priesthood that you cannot replace and it started with a preached cow milk is a deck so they never change any priest because the changing of a priest comes by death but you cannot kill this one so from the beginning all the way to do today under the melchizedek priesthood there is only one priest in order to change him you must kill him here but because he doesn't die you cannot change him so we don't have many priests under the levitical prie under the mercy of the priesthood we only have one priest ever care so far blessed be the name of the lord why is this important why go to number 35 go to number 35 i'm trying to rush somebody doesn't lose a wing number 35 verse 28 if you dare you can say amen everybody there everybody there verse 27 and the revenge of blood found him without the border of the city of his refuge and the revenger of blood killed the slater the slayer he will not be guilty of blood in the old testament there was something called the cities of refuge and for some reason when moses established them joshua established them they came out six yes yes here and six is the number of men there never was a seventh one [Applause] are we okay do you follow me do you follow me when they came to the package they said god say i'm gonna put what they call city of refuge they say what does it mean city of refuge yes it means when you did something wrong unintentionally like paul said i was doing that in ignorance okay you were doing that because you didn't know there was a place that you need to run back here and when you run you enter there nobody can touch you even if they have your camera even if they have your picture if you enter there nobody touches you anybody here in that city they will judge you your judgment is in the city not outside the city anybody here and when you are judged you stay in that city never to go outside [Music] do you hear me because the one you did harm is looking for you anybody here everybody here and god is saying here if he finds you outside of the city he has a right to kill you i back here but as long as you are in the city you can stand on the wall of the city and say hello god bless you how are you doing he cannot even shoot an arrow [Music] a distance here he cannot use a gun at distance here you can be walking on top of the city well and dancing there he's not going to do anything do you hear me and god they say how many cities do we have they open the package one two three four they say keep moving five they keep going six they look they say the box is empty six yes you put four three there three there no problem watch verse 28. you okay now you okay now everybody okay okay verse 28 because he should have remained in the city of refuge until the death of who [Music] are we okay am i reading a different bible until the death of the water but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his water do you follow me if you stay on the city and the high priests die do you hear me they give you the death certificate of the high priest you hear me that he's dead you can come out of the city do you follow me and the one who was looking for you have no right to touch you anymore are we okay [Music] let's go back to melchizedek are we okay paul says that this man continued forever anybody here he cannot die do you follow me did you follow me are you with me [Applause] the death of the if the high priest is alive follow me carefully your sin is still valid do you hear me when you enter the city of refuge you are under protection but your sin is talking outside everybody here in the city your sin is quiet outside the city your sin is still alive everybody so that scene is alive but in the city it is carried by the high priest so when the high priest walk he's walking with your sin back here so when the high priest died do you follow me amen the death of the high priest [Applause] the death of the high priest wipe the sin outside the city in other words the death of the high priest is an atonement for your sin it means in the city zero sin outside the city zero scene [Music] [Applause] so when you come out after the death of the high priest it looks like you never did it to begin with [Applause] amen [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah so the problem is melchizedek cannot die you remember we saw that you cannot kill god america so if you keep mercury like that his only security long as we're in the city but our sin is still alive he's still talking do you follow me so we must do something to kill melchizedek yet we don't kill him [Music] [Applause] can i repeat again can i repeat again you don't want melchizedek to die because if melchizedek died your security is not is not secure because the high priest as long as he is alive he will protect you on the city of refuge but we want also him to die because we don't want our talking our gossip around the city outside amen do you amen me rahab has a past [Applause] do you follow me if the spies went into jericho and took rehab out and just got with her her story still alive there are people that went with her in the nightclub there are people that were with help in the hotel ever here so pulling rehab only is not the end you must pull him and destroy the evidence [Music] so when you come you want to know the past of harabba there is nobody alive that can tell you her story her city destroyed the people destroyed her whole past is wiped completely you follow me so mercy said they cannot die because we want to stay in eternal security yet we want somebody to wipe what we did wrong so we must also kill melchizedek [Applause] do you follow me you kill melchizedek in this man do you follow me because this man is the visible image of melchizedek him and melchizedek like the hand and the glove when you touch him you touch mercury so melchizedek feel this man until this man is god blessed forever ever here and when your sin is coming upon him melchizedek comes out of him okay back here and say he is the high priest i am the priest [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah when they're coming they're attacking mercury except that's what i was looking come come on when they come out they say they're coming they say come my friend you're gonna go you're gonna die in three days within three days i will come and get you take him that's the high priest kill him but not me then mercy said they come off my father my father why have that forsaken me you follow me so we are guaranteed a return of security and are wiping off our sins [Applause] are you with me so when they kill jesus christ automatically our sin are nailed [Applause] do you follow me he wiped every sin away and when he finished wiping everything away melchizedek comes again and say wake up and he answered him again [Applause] hallelujah and then from now on you cannot kill him anymore because he only died once so when you come to him when you enter he doesn't die anymore eternally secured [Applause] it's 32 my friend go to hebrews 6 i have not even reached the generation go to hebrews 6 the city of refuge blessed be the name of the lord take hebrews 6. somebody saw it somebody saw it somebody saw it i'm already past two minutes hang on here hebrews 6 are you there you there [Music] let's go to verse 17 you're there wearing god willing more abundantly to show to the hairs of the promise immutability do you know what that means unchangeability unchangeable unchangeableness of his counsel he's not going to change anymore amen confirm it by enough remember you are a priest forever anybody here verse 18 that by two immunible things unchangeable things in which it is impossible for god to do what that we might have a water who has what [Music] [Applause] you fled for what you fled for who was fleeing for refuge in the old testament they were going where to the city of what and there were how many city in the old testament now you found that there is another city now it is not a natural city it is number seven the completion of all the cities and we who have run toward that city [Music] a city of refuge we who have fled for refuge to lay hard upon water [Music] they hope set water this is your seventh city of refuge [Music] everybody here that's why you heard paul say jerusalem who is our mother they're they heavenly jerusalem who is our mother how can a city be your mother because we are born into that city and the king over there is melchizedek the king of jerusalem and that king is a high priest he is a city of refuge so when you enter there ever here verse 19 which hope we have as an anchor of the water not the body now but both sure and steadfast and which enter onto the water do you see what the veil was split into inside the veil verse 20 whereford is for us entered forever after the order of what [Music] can i finish here let me stop here so you're going to chew it where was that let me stop here where was i five and no man take off this honor that's why here the bible say where of he's able to save them to the other most he doesn't die he's gonna go with his work all the way to the end [Music] that's why he's out firing the omega he have to complete what he started ever here and no man taketh this honor unto himself but he that is call of god as was what you don't put yourself as a high priest you must be appointed by god that's why god said you are a priest after the order of water they have to appoint somebody but here so also christ glorify not himself to be made a water but he does say unto him there aren't my son today i have begotten thee and he said also into another place there are air not a high priest forever after the order of what called of god a water [Music] you okay melchizedek was a priest not a high priest but jesus is huh do you hear me do you hear me when mercy melchizedek melchizedek took the tarot of high priest and put it in jesus so he passed the ball everybody here in other words it's jesus the man that made melchizedek high [Music] melchizedek was a priest but when melchizedek entered jesus he became the high priest [Music] before me he's the high priest because the high priest must die everybody so the title of high priest is put on the sun so that he can die for your sin when everything is finished that melchizedek pulled back up amen and now he stand as a city of refuge and back here so when you flee from your trouble when you flee from your family when you free from your old life when you flee from spoke from smoking pipe doing all kinds of stuff when you enter into melchizedek it's finished everybody for you to go out he must die but he cannot die no more he lived forever that's why we are sealed until the day of redemption ever here that's why we are perfected forever [Applause] amen because that person will never die it is eternal security he finished the work completely once you enter he close the door that say your problem is finished because now the spirit can be poured upon you and he put your life into a rest you enter the sabbath and you just sit quiet and he take over your life let's stand [Applause] i went 11 minutes over 11 worker hours amen amen that's why you heard peter saying we have a sure word of prophecy this is not guesswork this is reality if you have not made peace with melchizedek yet you must meet him as melchizedek before the blood is gone and you're gonna meet him as a judge that's a different thing now he's the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of her infirmities and lord's willing will get into that missing generation that we could not even touch the scripture but you understand the siege of abraham he is after a spiritual seed and that seed is crust but christ is not one man he is a multi-member person there so when you are shaking him there are people inside amen when abraham was playing taft that revelation was hidden on melchizedek liver who was in the loins were benny everybody here showing that under mercy that the benefit is transferred to the children even down to the generation liver was the fourth one but still the blessing can travel spiritually and heat liver before levi is born years ago it's under melchizedek you want to live in peace you want a quiet life you want a quiet marriage you want a peaceful marriage you want you need to meet melchizedek you want a peaceful life you want peace in your home you want peace in your family there is a king of peace there is a king of righteousness there is somebody that can speak that can justify you more than anybody and when he says he have the final word you want a relationship in peace you want a peaceful job you want a peaceful life meet the king of righteousness meet the king of peace if he poor his spirit upon you then your wilderness will be turned into a foot fulfilled and what you taught was advantage to you you will look at everything all the facebook all the whatsapp all the stuff that you taught you a big shot you're gonna see them as a danger why because of the excellency of the knowledge of jesus christ at that point you are living differently then the work of righteousness will produce peace and you will live in a quiet habitation no matter what is going on remember he's a shelter in a weary place remember he's going to protect you against the strong wind no matter what is going on you will see situation going on in your life but on the inside you are peaceful you don't know why you peaceful you don't know why you're not trouble you don't know why you don't get upset again like you were doing before because somebody is controlling things and before you know it everything is solved beyond your intelligence because his way that he work thinks is different than you because he puts you into rest he say rest and watch me do what i can do and everything will be all right heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly father thanking you for unfolding these things to us lord lord we read about melchizedek we barely touch the surface father because there are so many things that you loaded under this personality that pertain to the benefit of your children lord father now we begin to understand why paul was whipping why paul was continually under sorrow because he looked and he saw what israel missed and now it has been turned into the gentile and father we as a gentile we want to look at this treasure and appreciate it not to look at that treasure as the jews who lord because of a lack of revelation missed it and father turn it away and that stone that the builder rejected father was the man and the headstone lord father may each person under the roof of this building and those that are streaming online lord father realized that this is not something to fill our mind but it is something that was intended to touch our heart that we can realize that the god of heaven can make all these great planes father hide all this tap and shadow just to get somebody a wretched like us [Music] father what a precious value we have in your sight that you have to do all of this just to win our heart lord and in appreciation to what you'd have done accepting even the death of the cross lord so that we can you can wipe our sin our iniquity before even we were born you already finish everything on the cross and all that you are asking us today is only acknowledging the work of cross and father automatically it's gonna be counted concounted unto us for righteousness not that we're gonna go back to israel to climb on the cross to die for our own no just a believing the work of the cross automatically imputed righteousness to our soul and we know that we can face you without being ashamed we can enter the throne of heaven lord father peacefully knowing lord that somebody took our place and we became the righteousness of god father may the holy spirit poor be poured down and father water this world until lord the revelation becomes more clear and clear and your children can grasp it and understand that it's not a legalistic message but it's a message of grace and when we understand this message of grace as an appreciation to the depths of this message we begin to live peacefully our christian life not feeling like we have been constrained to living but it becomes a joy to leave this message and what was once father a burden become light because father somebody is carrying our life lord we thank you and commit your children unto the hand if there is one that is sick one that is struggling one that i have not even got it one that have run away from the flock lord father you knew why you brought all of us here this morning father made this bio
