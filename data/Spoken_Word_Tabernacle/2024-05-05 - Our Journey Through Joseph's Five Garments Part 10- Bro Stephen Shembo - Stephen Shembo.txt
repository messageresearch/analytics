by Lord father fixing this light Lord father you know this service before the foundation of the world and there is nothing that the enemy can do to stop your work Lord am because when you alha you

and may the devil and his army be completely out of this place May Lord father the Holy Spirit alone and the elected Angel Lord father be in this place ministering your word so that you might be the one speaking and the one interpreting and hearing the word Lord and may you move us completely out of the way we thank you Lord father for the musician the technician and everyone Lord father on their

Lord and lead us and speak to our soul in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen good to see everyone thank you very much musician God richly bless you let's give the Lord a big clap [Applause] off you might be see it a little bit now you see how the enemy has been fighting left and right but by God's grace everything is doing well everybody knows what an iron D is iron dum do you know what it is you don't know what it is it's a n defense system that Israel has yes it's an air defense system that they put on Israel so if you shoot a missile or an RPG or you shoot a weap or you send something to Israel the iron dumb is 24 hours working that whatever comes in it will block it and destroy it before he hit the people amen so whatever you shoot the aod is always working anyway will be activate if you send something from Iran or you send something from Lebanon or you send something from Gaza or for Yemen you sent whatever you send toward Israel even when you sleeping there is an iron n that is sitting there as soon as it's coming it destroyed in the air before he hit the ground now you understand why AR have to send 300 John at the same time that's right and they sended from different direction sir some are coming from the south some are coming from the North and the purpose is to overwhelm the defense system so that in other word when you shoot 100 all they want is at least two to pass through and to cause damage but by God's grace they intercept all of them and I put them down [Applause] and that is exactly what the enemy is doing now he's attacking from this side attacking from this side attacking from that side attacking to overwhelm you but there is a God that doesn't sleep amen he doesn't Slumber amen he's 24 hours watching over you and there is a protection better than the iron down it is called the blood of Jesus Christ so no matter what is coming against church he will not Prosper amen no matter what is coming against you nothing will prosper no weapon form against you am will prosper there is a defense system that is protecting you amen be a good cheer my friend am all things are working together for good amen amen he thought he's going to darken the camera Brother David God bless you what is happening now light came up before the word is preached amen he knows what he's afraid of but he's going to get it I'm going to strike back yes sir amen amen come on Lord if you learn the devil you should have left us alone because God's purpose for this church will be fulfilled amen God purpose for your life will be perfect amen regardless of what SAT one H it will be performed everybody okay we greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ both visible and invisible audience amen any family members here we do not have visitors we got family members God richly bless you I see my brother there I see sister bridg and sister God richly bless you I'm not good at names but I can match the face quickly and recognize who it is but God richly bless you and welcome to spoken word Tabernacle if there is somebody in the back that I forgot God richly bless you we'll welcome you in the name of Jesus Christ and we trust that the service will be a blessing to you amen we had a wonderful time at brother kalma's home yesterday wonderful fellowship and sometime we need it it relaxes you sit with scent of light precious faith and you go home feel relaxed and rejoicing amen I believe each one of us we up to date with the sermon we are reading our Bibles twice a day our Cod book our church ages 70 weeks of Daniel the seals the adoption you say brother Stephen I already finished all those books but we also need to listen to the message of who here have already finished all the sermon of BR brandham raise your hand so you still got some homework to do and even if you finish that same message when you hear it the first time you hear the second time you always hear something because it's the word of God and that word is always Eternal amen I asked the Deacon brother Robert I spoke to him young sister young men's meeting we could not confirm for this coming Saturday so what I ask is if there is a possibility we can push all the meetings toward June so find something in June for the young men and the young sisters and in may we just keep the house meeting I know I'm in the middle of a fight so I have to recalibrate things and shoot the devil left and right and everything will be okay so we got question and answer on the 25 but young men young Sisters Let's push it toward June uh pick up a date Lord's willing and let me know and we go from there amen I remember preaching and I don't know even if it was probably my glasses that fell off and brother Charles gave it to me and I forgot to say thank you so brother Charles thank you very much so if you see me forgetting something I don't really mean it sometime you preaching you're focusing but I know how the devil is looking for me for every single L po that's why I have to shoot him where he is to make sure everything is good so if I forgot in the future maybe I drop my pen just know brother stepen say thank you right amen amen thank you very much glory to God I gave you the flyer for brother Chad Lamb if you can make it fine if you cannot by God's grace go ahead and pray for the meeting and everything is on U church group chat you got everything there if you need any more question you can let us know and we go from there Amen brother I was informed that brother Ziggler some of you know him in South Carolina passed away so the service will be the celebration of life service will be on Wednesday so if you want to go there we talk with the Deacon and get more clarity ification on the information and what we will do we will just go ahead and put it on the chat so whoever want to go there to be a support you can do it but if you cannot just remember the family in prayer so that God will Comfort the family and uh everything I got uh all cleared together I don't know if I forgot something but let's go straight to the word so you keep the family in prayer amen amen glory to God brother the camera now clear praise God those online we apologize we are fighting with the devil so everything was working fine until this morning so it's sat so let's put the blame there let's go to Genesis 39 again so you know what we still working with Genesis 39 verse 1 if you there you can say amen amen glory to God everybody can hear me okay amen Genesis 39 verse1 the Bible says and Joseph was brought down to Egypt and pipar an officer of pharaoh so we still dealing with this captain of the Guard an Egyptian bought him of the hands of the Israelite which had brought him down there you might be seated so we are in the House of pipar a military man we know what he means now it takes military to decode Authority and once you understand Authority you can also decode the third pool amen amen verse two and the Lord was with Joseph amen this statement we didn't see it before in the life of Joseph all we knew it was Joseph saw dreams and then according to the dream Joseph had a position and that was interpreted even by his brother one of them say that do you want to re over us or have dominion over us so Joseph already was predestinated that's right by God for a high position am amen amen he was predestinated to Reign yes and to have dominion because in both dreams people are bowing down to him amen amen amen they are bowing down or they making obedience to him so he was positioned he was already predestinated to rain but now in the house of Piper something else unfolded in the life of Joseph if you go back to Genesis 37 there is nowhere where he say the Lord was with him right right right but we know the Lord was with him because he was a prophet and the lord gave him Vision which were dreams that were interpreted but here it's clearly stated that the Lord was with him when they put him in the pit God was there amen when they pull him up they took him to Egypt God was there but here it's more obvious uhhuh yes wow somebody can look and say there is something different about this Bo it happened not in the land of Canaan it happened in the house of part under a mentor that's where it happened amen amen amen under a master or under a mentor which Paul explained to us that it's a tutor or a governor you remember that verse two the the Bible says and the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man there is two things here one of them when we looking at Joseph the Bible say the first one the Lord was with him that makes a big difference amen amen amen and the second one he was a prosperous man where was this Prosperity coming from amen amen amen because we didn't see that in the land of Canaan it only happened in the house of Piper over there it's just a story of hatred between the brothers and everything but clearly here Joseph God is with him God is with you in your life and also he's a prosperous man amen how can a prosperous man find himself in such a situation amen amen how would you know that you a prosperous man come on now amen they got to put you in trouble then Prosperity will be manifested how will we know that you have the ability to fix something something have to break amen and when you start fixing it then we begin to understand amen that you got a gift in your life amen so whenever something happen sometime it's only also an opportunity to display what was hidden in you amen are we together are we together the Bible says in verse two and the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the Christian no the Egyptian so God is using a setting that is not even a Christian environment Amen to prepare you for his task is my Bible different than yours no sir God is using an Egyptian not a Hebrew an Egyptian to prepare you for that amen amen verse three and his master saw that the Lord was with him there is two things here Joseph the Lord is with him number one number two he's a prosperous man and his master decod the first one so by Joseph being in his house he saw something different about this boy than any other person in the house right and he understood that not Joseph has some kind of magic magic or he's a magician or something but he brought him to a an acknowledgment that this boy have a God that is following him a god that is with him somebody saw deity Amen in the life of somebody am am amen amen when he was with his brother they didn't see deity that's right amen when he was with all his brother no deity because jealousy blind the people amen when somebody's jealous they don't even see what is normal amen [Applause] you can show them you say this is what brother Benjamin is wearing a suit they don't see a suit they will say no it's just a clo because it's jealousy amen amen amen glory to God verse three and his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made all that he did to do what prosper in his hand so his Prosperity was coming from God amen amen so in the house of postier God is with him uhuh amen amen and God is making everything that he's doing prosperous and py decoded both of them amen amen amen amen amen amen amen so when Joseph was in Canaan none of this was displayed right that's right amen that's exactly right all he knew is his dream dream yeah I see people bowing down to me I'm going to be probably a big man or I'm going to occupy a great position what is that position we don't know amen because most of the time we want to know what is our position that's right that's correct brother I know that I'm going to be somewhere but what is my position where am I going to be that somebody is he in the house of Piper is he in Egypt here is he in Canaan is he uh somewhere where am I going where is my position where is my destination amen where am I going amen and how do I know that I'm going to the right direction amen amen amen everybody okay amen his prosperity and the presence of God in his life amen begin to make way toward his destination let me start it again the presence of God amen amen amen and how God Prosper what he's doing yes amen amen our two key element pushing Joseph toward the right path amen watch the next verse verse four and Joseph found Grace in his sight and he served him and made him how overseer over what his house did Joseph require a position did he apply for it no no no no no was he praying for it what open that position position God the presence of God uhhuh and how God the work of God in the life of Joseph amen those work were prospering amen and those work open the door for him toward a highest position in other word wherever you put Joseph how many have already taken maybe if you take a back of water and you have uh a lead maybe uh from a bottle and you take that lead and you push it down to the bottle of the bucket of water when you take whatever your hand or your road or whatever when you take it off what happened to the lead comes back up you heard it you you heard it in other word if you take Joseph you put him down in the pit after while amen amen Joseph will come out if you put him in the house of Piper as a slave come on brother in the bottom amen guess what uh-huh it's just a matter of time Joseph will make his way up all the way to be overseer of everything amen amen so wherever you put him the work of God in his life will always bring him up amen amen what are you trying to say brother Bram says this glory to God he says how does one know the rightful position in the body of Christ I'm already preaching because we already prayed amen amen Amen brother brandham say how does one know their rightful position in the body of Christ brother the Bram said that's a good one a good one amen not only a good one but a very good amen amen why that that be the kind of question among many of us here tonight that's right and to us this morning how do you rightfully know amen that you in the position God wants you to be you are in the place where God wants you to be Amen brother Bram say now I'm presuming that this brother wants to know what position what in Christ what part of Christ do I play amen amen are we together amen do you want to know your position in Christ do you want to know your position in the church amen do you want to know your position in the body of the believer am brother Bram say it's a good question how do you know Joseph brother brandham say now for instance I like to I like I like this I say I say like this brother to give you the best answer and know brother Bram what is the best answer that you know that can let us know that what we doing is Right amen that what we are we are in the will of God Amen what is the best answer to know that brother Bram say your position in Christ is how revealed to you by who the Holy Spirit number one your position in Christ is revealed to you by the Holy Spirit Come on Lord the presence of God in your life will reveal to you your position amen do you follow me amen remember there is two things with Joseph number one the presence of the Lord and number two whatever he does prosper and brother Bram said to know your position in the body of Christ number one the holy spirit will let you know amen but how does the holy spirit let me know no is he going to speak to me with an audible voice am I going to speak in tongues am I going to prophesy am I going to open my bible and see it in the Bible or I'm going to listen to brother Bram and he's speaking all of that the Holy Spirit can use those Channel but let's get something more firmer so you know how to decode your position brother Bram say and then if you want to know whether it's the Holy Spirit or not so the Holy Spirit Will quick your position to you but if you want to confirm that it's the holy spirit this is the second thing that you use amen because with Joseph there are two things number one the presence of God but don't stop at the presence of God watch how God is working in your life amen the presence of God and the way God is working in your life and brother BR I'm say number one the Holy Spirit reveal it to you and then if you want to know whether it's the Holy Spirit or not this is the best answer uhhuh find out whether he does what bless is what you're doing or not am I reading something different brother Bram say find out whether he does what blesses blesses what you doing or what or not if God blesses it it's God Amen in other word Joseph you're not out of position you are where you are supposed to be amen are we together are we together sometime we hesitant we don't know what to do we don't know whether I'm doing the will of God or not you don't know what am I doing with this gift that God gave it to me watch what that gift is doing watch watch what that cooking is doing amen maybe God gave you a gift of cooking but you don't understand why if you give it it's prosper wake up amen the holy spirit is pointing something there if you translating and it's waking up wake up amen maybe God is telling you something [Applause] amen amen amen have i l somebody brother Bram say watch whether He blesses what you're doing or not and if he blessed this then it's who him he didn't say it's Satan did he say Satan no sir when he blesses it it's what it's him Joseph if he's blessing what you're doing it is whole pushing you toward overseeing the entire house am amen amen amen we talked about this in brother KH home with some people yesterday Amen brother Bram say if he doesn't bless you fill in the blank you fill in the blank yourself because if I say you say brother Bram didn't say you feeling the blank amen If He blesses it it's him brother Bram continue with that question he said usually where I watch it for myself this is who me I watch the nature of the person amen amen it's going to help somebody this morning amen I watch the nature of the what person and see what kind of a gift that they are what professing so your gift sometime goes with your nature amen can you say Amen please Amen brother Bram say I watch the nature of what the person and see what kind of a gift that they are what professing God will work with his nature the way he made him amen that's why you don't change the way you are amen you don't copy somebody else no sir because God frame you amen for a purpose amen God fashion you for a purpose we are not Catholics no sir where every priest must preach the same way no sir every believer must be the same way that's a Catholic Church Everybody Must say something a certain way must behave a certain way no you stay the way God preached amen if you preach moving preach

people can come and do what enjoy themselves in the gospel in other words H is very important amen that's why you come and you are enjoying the go amen amen Hallelujah listen to this my friend William Maran Bram he says I have went into meetings I want to ask you something you go into what a meeting a pastor that does what jerks his head watch every one of the congregation they do what jerk their

teacher our hell will what never move that church that's right upon the authority of the word amen upon the authority of the message amen preached by Malachi amen Luke 1730 amen bursting into Christ nothing will happen to this church amen weapon form from Hell amen will come and Prevail against the church no weapon because heaven and earth will pass away but not the word of God amen amen amen glory glory glory glory glory are we together amen are we together amen are we together is this smoke flying everywhere GL are we together let's go to our scripture my friend Two element with Joseph the presence of the Lord how do I know this is my gift how do I know this is my calling how do I know this is the business that I need to do how do I know am the holy spirit will speak to you and watch him in action as his Blessing you know that okay I'm moving in the right path everybody okay every everybody good amen glory to God where are we at my friend verse 5 amen verse uh 4 and Joseph found Grace in his sight and did what serve serve him and he made him what overseer over all over over his house and all that he put into what his hand and he came to pass from the time that he had made him what Overseer in other words you recognize Joseph if you put him in the right position uhhuh the little bottle top is back where it's supposed to be once it's there automatic amen amen he made him overseer over Overseer in his house and over all that he had that the Lord did what put into bless the Egyptians house for Joseph what sake and he Bess and the blessing of the Lord was upon all all that he had where in their house and where and in the field so there is with Joseph usually there are two things are we together amen there is a natural resource that you have amen amen in other words when Joseph come into your house you can give him a bunch of crops that's what you have right but as soon as that crops which is the hand of Joseph amen there will be another Supernatural crop amen that will come from an increase of the Lord amen in other word if you give Joseph $10 as long as Joseph put that in his bank account you watch tomorrow it's $15 amen there is a super increase amen whatever you put in his hand will multiply amen so there will be a natural resource and a supernatural amen resource that is coming from God amen amen whatever you give it if you give him 20% he reimburse to you 80% amen so you got 60 where did he come from we don't know it looks like we we've been growing this CR for years when he came he planted the crb for some reason everything is double in the field there is a mysterious part there is a mysterious part amen amen amen of increase that comes only when you put it under the hand of Joseph verse six and he left all that he had in the hand of who Joseph and he knew not anything he had save the bread which he did eat and Joseph was a goodly person and how well favored let's go to Genesis 41 we clear with that one amen two things and then there is a natural thing and there is a supernatural yes you put a hamburger with Joseph you go back you find three where did they the two came from that's a mystery amen amen amen amen if you give Joseph the the Bible if you go you left it in the hand of Joseph when you come back you will see the Bible and the message of the hour aside am amen both of them are one amen there is just a mysterious part will come out you will still see your Bible sitting there which you gave Joseph but besides your Bible you will see the message of brother Bram there so the message came from the Bible the mysterious part amen Joseph revealed the mysterious part amen that can never be seen only by God Amen in other words you have a crop that only Joseph can pull it out amen but if I have crop that n none of those crop will happen until Joseph come amen when Joseph come another weth of is for that for never knew before amen when brother Bram comes and mystery of the Bible comes out that nobody knew only brother BR Genesis 41 verse 25 if you dare you can say amen amen the Bible say and Joseph said to Pharaoh the dream you know the dream of pharaoh is one God has showed to pharaoh what he's about to do so the thing is coming from God jum to verse 29 behold there come what seven years of plenty throughout what all the land of Egypt and there shall arise after them what seven years of famine so seven and seven is zeroall there is seven years of plenty and they will there was seven years of Plus are we okay amen are we together amen and there will come seven years of manness so both of them will do what zero cancel out is is the MTH difficult amen amen amen amen amen where are you heading glory to God hallelujah amen amen verse 30 and there this Bible you will always read it and something keep popping up popping up popping up that's the message of the hour amen amen because if he goes to zero this is trouble it's a trouble we will run out hungry because the seven year are meant to cancel and to destroy the other seven years whatever was created must be destroyed and we will go to zero and everybody stop so you need Joseph amen amen amen if I lost you raise your hand sir thank you my friend back there there is seven years of plenty and there are seven years of famine let's read about that famine so you get the point well verse 30 and they shall arise after them what seven years of famine and all the Plenty shall be how forgotten in the land of Egypt and the famine shall consume how the land and the planty shall not be known in the land by reason of what that famine following for it shall be how very Grievous in other words the power of the negative seven is too strong than the positive seven are we together so when the femine is coming it is pretty bad until the seven kind or the seven Cales ate all the other one and the Bible said they were still ill will in looking so it do you know that it's in the Bible the seven cow ate the fat one but they never grew fat look at the Bible the Bible say when they finished eating the other one they were still looking fin skinny in other word whatever can be produced in a year it's not enough to withstand the negative year so now you need Joseph amen because Joseph if you give him seven uhhuh are we together if you give Joseph seven Joseph won't return seven no sir he will bring some mysterious amen that will be more abundant than seven Amen in order to withstand the fine amen because if you keep seven and seven it's going to be zero the people will be starving you need a Ministry that can produce food amen beyond what has been given amen amen store the food amen store the food amen store the food amen store the food amen not for the congregation that was in Jeffersonville God when you storing food you storing for the future amen not for the present so brother was not storing food for those that were there because most of them are already theread amen but the food was store for the future amen God knew I'm going to see mik daily amen I'm going to see John I'm going to see Greg I'm going to see brother so I need to keep some food for brother Micha back amen [Applause] I am sorry but I'm responsible for what I say a message Church cannot preach the Bible just [Applause] normal when you go through a true Message Church it looks like every day something new amen keep coming up amen amen something new amen something mysterious amen that you never seen am keep coming up amen that is the mystery Hallelujah of the anointing of Joseph amen the anointing of Christ Hallelujah so when people are going to church they under anticipation what is God going to say today again when he comes to say praise the Lord I read this all this time I never seen before but when the anointing of Joseph come he pulled the mysterious part am and the B become a [Applause] new I am responsible for what I say but truth need to be declared amen a message church is different than denomination even when we repeating brother Bram we not parot no sir we are repeating the message with an anointing [Applause] Amen in other words you read the C home when we come here we read that same Cod you see something different amen because the message is built like that have I lost somebody have I lost somebody amen amen it's a tunders my friend it's the seven tunders if not we need to read what brother brandham read and begin to read his message or just play tape and leave it alone but that's not it when we look at the message we look at the Bible the Bible open up because Joseph has more [Applause] you give him the message of William Mar Bram you begin to see things begin to come out amen because Joseph have more in other word every day you go to a message church is different amen amen ah my brother I'm doing this I'm saying this in the Lord I am not boasting anything in Christ but truth have to be declared amen am we don't see there like denomination where we go we do our religion and go you must come out and say God did for me something different today I learned something different today I see God in a different way I used to read this quot but I never understood it today now I understand this better than before we read the cot we didn't listen to it we didn't understand that but now God gave me the revelation of what brother was really talking about amen amen we are still reading the scripture where are we at verse 31 and the Plenty shall be forgoten by the land by um not be known in all in the land by reason of the famine following for it shall be how very Grievous for and for that the dream was how doubled unto Pharaoh twice it is because the thing is how established by God by Satan no sir by who by God if God established that who have the solution to that only God Amen and God will shortly do what bring it to pass now therefore after interpreting the dream he's giving even the solution amen without requesting for position okay he didn't say it's Pharaoh now that I have interpreted the what position will you give me now because he was more interested about being free so that he can go back to his father that's why he told the batt when you go there please I was taken away from Hebrew all he want was to be free and go back there so probably he would have stopped and say I gave you the interpretation my friend can you just free me so I can go back home that's right hallu God was looking at something else amen and he he cannot go home he need to stay where he ish it is home that's going to reach him amen home will reach you amen you not gending [Applause] amen do you follow me amen if you already in eight with your with Christ and your family are still in one you're not coming down they're the one that's going to with you amen amen you stay in your position amen Your Position will pull your children uhhuh and pull them up where you are Amen in other word you keep claming with God don't worry about your family member your family member will finally eventually God will send some famine and that famine will bring them closer to you are we together amen are we together amen I'm trying to start the sermon my friend are we there amen are we there amen and therefore let phoh look out for a man a man what discreet and wise discreet and wise Discerning and wise and set him of what the land of Egypt he didn't say Pharaoh don't you see that I'm wise don't you see that I have a great field he said no no no no Pharaoh you go ahead and search for something somebody that's going to do it and brother Bram say us the person who fit for a position don't want it can you say amen amen he say he usually run away from it yes sir amen amen it is the position searching for him because he was predestinated for it amen hallelujah in other word the position is pulling you amen oh my God he says let Pharaoh do this let him do what look out appoint officer 34 over the land and take up what the fifth part of the land of Egypt of what in the seven plenteous year in the seven plenteous year and let them gather all the what the food of those good years that come and lay the corn under the the hand of who pharaoh and let them take up food in the water the cities and there shall be food and that food shall be for sorry shall be for store to the land against what the seven years of famine the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of what Egypt that the land perish not through what the famine how many percentage are we taking a fif MH if you have seven years are we together amen and there are seven years very bad more powerful than the year of Plenty that are coming to cancel everything and Joseph said during this year you will find you take a fief a fief is 20% amen amen if 7 years is meant to destroy 7 years what is 20% of s years due to 7 years I'm going again clearly amenallah can I do some math yes sir I have the Cod my friend okay our seven years is 100% amen uh-huh to our 7even year 100% in order to cancel this you need seven negative 100% so 100us 100 you got zero amen but Joseph is saying to hander this most bad seven years you don't need 100% do you follow me amen you need a fif meaning you just need 20% and 20% will handle what seems to be very bad the god that we serve amen is a god of paradox amen when Gideon Army you remember in question and answer amen you remember in question and answer when Gideon Army move from 32,000 and the GL remove 22,000 and they become 10,000 and the Lord came and removed 900 700 9,700 Gideon Army ended up with what 300 it was 300% that match the game Amen in other word even if you are in minority uhhuh even if when you get really low amen when you get to the last meal the last Barrel uhhuh that's when Elijah will fall amen and say give me the last amen for there shall be food am and oil in your pot when you reach it the last one [Applause] amen are we together young sister you remember the woman with a pot of oil in the in the in the house of Elisha she didn't have anything but what just a part of all and that is what happen do what pay all the Deb amen and even left money to live with it amen and Tau that woman how to do business [Applause] amen when it gets very low that's when God step on the [Applause] scene in our way of thinking if it's 700 to get this what do we do we need to get 200% so we can match and make sure everybody got it and get even over so we make sure if the kids are spoiling food at least we got some story God say 20% how can 20% withstand 7 years the 20% will do it if it's in the hand of Joseph amen amen let's see 20% equal what jum to verse 49 if you dare can say amen I thought this Ser I will preach four sermon and that's it amen amen now we on part 10 let's go 49 if you thereare you can say amen amen and Joseph did what gathered corn as what the sand of the sea where did that corn come from where did that corn come from where did that Supernatural corn came from the corn as the what sand of the sea as the sand of the sea amen come how very much until they did what he left numbering for he was what without number 20% is without number you don't have a number to put in word in order to withstand this famine you need more than the natural food amen you need the supernatural inaction amen and he have to be given to Joseph amen and as soon as Joseph said that Pharaoh say who else who else it's only you they gave it to him and guess what he multiplied the seed until they cannot put a number in other word the revelation of Joseph have not a stop you will never reach a day where you will say h we preach it all if we go to church today what else you will be surpris you will be ambushed amen he will continue to produce amen you will never put a stop to this Revelation you can listen to all the message but still you have not known all the message amen because the food was compact food said one seal he can preach it in three month and he preach it in one night if brother Bram can preach a seal one seal in three month rather Steven will preach that one seal in how many years because what brother Bram is saying in one quot he gave us 10 sermon so what about if I go by

having it Freedom [Laughter] amen God created you with your nature be who you are [Applause] amen let me try to rush let's go to but brother Bram gave a quote if you rush you spoil the service okay let me take it easy before somebody hit me with a Cod let's go 9 Luke 9 verse 51 am oh my God they're preaching the word you waiting for when is he going to finish you just came to church you already looking at the clock you can spend 7 hours somewhere it doesn't bother you if brother Steven goes 15 minutes over he's preaching too [Applause] long what is attracting us where is your [Applause] appetite where is your games when the hour is very treacherous and the Lord Jesus is coming Israel is telling you something is coming amen let's go my friend to Luke 9 verse 51 if you dare you can say amen amen oh Lord help me and it came to pass when the time was what come that he should be what received up he did what he steadfastly set his face to in other word he decided to go where to Jerusalem and sent what Messengers before his face and they went and enter into to a village of what the Samaritans to make ready for what for him and they did not receive him because his face was as though he would go where to Jerusalem in other words when they heard that he's going to fellowship with brother so and so they say we're not going to be part of him where are you going you going to Brotherhood brother so and so Church no okay that's fine we see you next time you can [Music] go because according to John chapter 4 remember the woman the Jews have no dealing with what Samaritan so when they understand that you going over there no we're not going to be part of it he's going to the Jews and he look like a Jew amen amen and verse 54 and when his disciple who James and John James and who and John James and John James and John do you know who James means brother gave us this reading don't worry James is Hope John is what love which is Charity seems like we're missing somebody [Laughter] amen amen verse 54 and when his disciple James and John saw this they say Lord will you that we command what fire to come down from heaven and do what and consume [Music] them please Lord give me the third pool give me the third pool so I'm going to show them Lord please can you can you unlock just for a few minutes the temple so we can deal with this Samaritan matter of fact their origin is [Applause] wrong give me the third pool Lord give me the third poolen look further how they go they said am I reading a different no sir he says and will you that we command what fire to come down from heaven and do what and consume them even as who elas did they even give Jesus the scripture look at the scripture uhuh Elijah did it oh Father give me that thir Pro how did Elijah do it how did Elijah did it that's correct how did Elijah do it who T Elijah to do it so these two disciple are requesting the temp the command they command according to the ministry of Elijah maybe you didn't get it let's put it home that's my way of preaching I don't go left or right they command according to the ministry of William Marion Bram he created Square I want to create squarrel now they rejected me give me that TP I'm going to make them vanish so we can go back to Samaya we say you Samaritan by rejecting the word of the hour fire Kill Them All can I continue that's why you need 4 for house that's why you need P for house before you can handle that amen spoken word Tabernacle everybody okay you need some [Music] training brother in one of the C he said they give the African weapon they're shooting in everyone God come show the he said they give them the weapon and guess why it's a toy boom they shoot the deer boom they shoot this one boom they shoot this one because they got a weapon without [Applause] training and when they got rejected her third pool can I continue but he turned and did what and rebuke them and say you know not what so they got a spirit on them you know not what manner of spirit you are of for The Who The Who not the Son of God the son of man the ministry of the son of man the son of man the son of man not the Son of God God in a Ministry in a prophetic Ministry when you see God in a prophetic Ministry the son of man is not come to do what destroy to destroy his man life but to do what the son of man Ministry comes to save that's why Joseph says this he say and Joseph say unto them do what Fe fear not for I am am I in the place for am I in the place of God but as for you you Tau what evil against me but God meant it unto what to bring to pass as it is when this day to do what amen save much people the son of man Ministry comes to save life my subject this morning is a life journey through Joseph five garment I'm good on time my friend we are away in eternity part 10 we have established five garment amen amen the first one brother lver what is it what is the first garment can you speak louder uh-huh quot of many color the second one brother Elijah what is it I want to hear your voice servant or slave the third one sister Emmanuel what is it prisoner I warn you yesterday I warn you yesterday amen amen the fourth one sister gift rabby suu let's go who's there go ahead my friend sister TI can you B him up to appear before pharaoh amen am okay the fifth one Sunan what is it fine ling let's give the Lord a big clap offering don't worry if I meet you next time I will catch you my friend so you better do some homework amen next time I'll catch you you better do some homework amen we establish these five government right here and we sin and we are still into this government called slave and all these garment are there throughout the scripture all of them you can see throughout the scripture those garment one after one even when Israel went to Egypt when they first got into Egypt they were given the land of Goan right Israel was the top Elite in Egypt they were the most privileged people because of Joseph but brother Bram say and the Bible say they rose up a pharaoh that did not know Joseph amen and that Pharaoh flipped the Garment because they were prospering he flipped the Garment from a High people and put them onto slaver Israel in Egypt become slaver then God came and sent Moses and Moses took them up toward the promised land amen but before they got there God put them through the Wilderness and they chose the law and the law put you in prison brother BR say the law is what put you in prison so you can see this garment all the way through in the life of Jesus Christ you will see them and if the Lord allow it you will see it in the life of David so all of our life we have this garment that has been displayed there that we're moving with them amen amen now we are dealing with the house of Piper and we found out that Piper is a military man py by being a military man it's a home where we got discipline a home where you under Authority you must be submitting to Authority amen because without that you cannot be prepared for the throne everybody okay so in this home here according to Paul in in galatian chapter 4 we found out that an amen when he's a child he's immature he's not different than a slave or a servant but he is still the Lord of all yes but he have to go under training through Tudor and Governor until the appointed time in other words God has an appointed time for your training before you can handle your position amen everybody clear and the end of this training brother Bram say is adoption that's why brother Bram preached several message he him Amen brother Bram used the scripture to show that after training through the tutor through the governor the end of it you're going to be adopted you're going to be placed into your position and that adoption when we saw last Sunday requires discipline amen because brother Bram say but how can the church there were what the Pentecostal church and the what the Methodist and Baptist Church and the Baptist Church be how adopted until they come to what disciplin without discipline no adoption we got to be what disciplined first God could not trust this power with John and James because they were ready to barbecue the people they were ready to rust them with fire god was not ready to give them the sir amen we say that adoption goes with discipline Oh Glory to God if you can allow me to erase this amen amen adoption according to brother Bram adoption goes with discipline it's hand in hand thank you amen and not only that brother Bram says this he said God could not trust the power this power with the church it is hard to tell what you will do if God would have granted James and John what they wanted they would have killed the entire city and brother Bram says this again reminding you that now placing the son first thing after the son was in he become what a son but then we found out that his what behavior is what set him to what adoption whether he behaved right or what or not so adoption goes with your behavior amen your behavior and discipline when you master these two things then you ready to rule amen you ready to reach your position am but brother Steven what do we have again to deal with this government let's go now with me into the Book of Mark chapter one we are talking about John whose love charity and we got James whose hope both of them ask the Lord to

word and Peter must stay under the preaching of the word first and as pet the attention is CAU up into the word as Peter begin to seek first the kingdom of God and it righteousness God begin to create fish amen amen God begin to manufacture fish amen for Peter when Jesus finished the sermon and he call Brother John P and he said come and take over the service and dismiss the people Jesus said now

my friend he says this someon answering say to him Master we have done what toiled all the night and we have taken what nothing never uh-huh at what Thy word stop a little bit who gave P theth yes sir I have a question for you where did Peter get the faith faith cometh by what hearing hearing what the word so what did Jesus started first by doing uh-huh preaching the word and he created Faith amen this is the ters my friend amen when the faith of Peter was already cranked Jesus saw that it's time he said Peter Glory Glory Glory because God knew when he speak they got to be a respon Amen in other word when I speak you going to say Amen Peter amen at the beginning you were doubting but now I have preached so much until you caught up into the Revelation because you CAU up into the Revelation let's go to action let's go to action let's go for the catch now you understand let's go catch some fishes not hesitant not trying but we are sure we can catch some fishes amen hall because I know I know know that before I get here you already in a desperate State before I get here you already try everything you try everything it didn't work that's why I came that's why I chose your boat hall Hall because you were born for something I can't preach what I was trying to preach James means what hope John means what love what does Peter means right amen amen Peter means what faith so Peter was born with faith amen but he didn't know wow Peter was born with faith but suffering all night seeing nothing unable to use the gift he was born with [Applause] hallah do you follow me God came and said Peter give me your boat why did he choose only Peter's boat it was time to crank that engine up he say sit and listen to the sermon Faith cometh by what hearing as Jesus was preaching something prick Peter amen maybe when Jesus was saying the word Peter was like oh my God never a man spoke like this where was this man all along I never he such a message like this and when Peter was all taken up a voice came and said Peter come on now for the catch that's why Peter could no longer play game he said Master amen can I continue he says I told all say to him Master we have done what taken to or not and have taken what nothing but nevertheless at what Thy word who brought Peter to the level of catching God at his word on brother that's it at that word I will do what let down the net a professional fature learn now to Humble his ability and to expect the supernatural amen am I train you to be fishermen but I know I'm going to use that fisherman technique for something in the future amen but before I take you there let me give you some Vindication bu so you understand he says and when they have done this they enclose what a great multitude of fishes and the N did what break where did the fish come from I'm asking you the professional say all night all night did he say all night all night meaning there was there was not a portion of the night they didn't work we cover all night I search for this joyy I open the joyy I search the entire joyy we even pull the joyy we didn't see it you put the Jo back you go back you open the keys are there we search for this car we didn't see the lost and key a voice said go back to the car you open the car the keys there who put that key there amen amen we told all night nothing but when they put so the catch the net broke too much of the net broke because what they caught was beyond the ability of the net because whatever get into the hand of Joseph he have to go overflow he have to to go beyond that's why David said my C run over can I continue don't worry I'm going to land the Sheep my friend he says verse 7 and they Beacon to their who Partners In other words somebody begin to go yeah come over here and the beon the signal to the part who are the partner I'm going to land they beon to their partner which were in the what other ship how many sheep were there there were how many sheep two one belonged

before you give me a few minute okay now you can give me a few minute okay can you give me a few minutes how many sheep do we have there two we know one belong to Peter the other one we don't know okay when Jesus came whatever I'm preaching now I didn't prepare it I didn't even see it at home I'm seeing it right now everything I'm telling you now is just coming now that's why I can't even go back to what I was preaching okay so just I have to deliver and obey the spirit how many sheep were there two both of them were how empty empty when Jesus came Jesus knew what happened he's God Jesus knew which sheep belonged to who follow me carefully follow me carefully for some reason Jesus look and he pick the Fe the Sheep of Peter and Peter means what Jesus went toward Faith oh God have mercy

other family amen GL Jesus pick Joseph because in Joseph is the Salvation of everybody the entire family will be saved through Joseph when Paul met the the the Philippian CH amen he says believe on the Lord and you shall be saved you and what your house the faith of the philan will go to his house that's right amen don't worry my friend let's go Jesus coming he found two sheep this one we know Peter the other one we don't know but remember Jesus have three special disciple that's right amen they didn't say that this ship belong to Peter and Angel they say it belong to who they only say Peter not Angel and Peter means Faith the other sheep we don't know then Jesus come and goes toward Faith amen because Christ follow faith and we work with faith and when he work with faith faith responded back am and said you know what I did everything that I can and nothing worked in my life Lord I try everything in every work but based on the sermon I heard today based on what you spoke today amen upon your sermon upon your word upon your command I'm going to lay down the net do you follow me when he laid down the net Jehovah J yes sir give the catch for two fishes I'm sorry Jehovah Jara gave the cat for two sheeps that's why the net begin to break because it takes two two sheep to handle that follow me carefully when the blessing begin to go too much overlow Peter say he be until the other one we need to know who are they who are they and the Bible say he was a another sheep the other sheep that was left there it belongs to who you ready let's read it my friend and we finish verse S and they back unto their partner which were in the what other ship that they should do what come and help them come and help them and they came and fill what both the ships so both ship that were empty are now how fil full so that they begin to what so the fish were you thought come on can I have few minute yes sir the boat is like this yes okay you thought when they say field is right here no he he went somewhere like that it was beyond the ability of the sheep until the Sheep begin to sink What A Catch What A Catch and what a creation am what a third amen amen wow can I get it amen can I get it amen can I get it and when Simon Peter did what saw it he did what he fell down at Jesus knees saying what depart from me for I am what a sinful man look at a man what he is now oh Lord he found out that it's a supernatural jump to verse uh n now amen for he was how astonished and all that were with what him and the what draw of the fishes which were they had what taken in other words they look at the quantity of fish they say it's impossible for this quantity of fish to come out from the same river the same sea that we tried somehow we would have catched site yes sir

blessing the blessing of Peter bless his partner the blessing of Joseph bless spify house it's a blessing that it is contagious it is a blessing that spread it won't stop to you it will go to your partner [Applause] amen I can't go where I'm trying to go I have to stop here God used their normal natural work and God train them as Fisher because God wanted to use them for fishermen to be fisher of men to be fisher of men you need to know first how to fish so you thought you were doing the fishing because that's what you like that's the family business that's the way we grew up my father was
