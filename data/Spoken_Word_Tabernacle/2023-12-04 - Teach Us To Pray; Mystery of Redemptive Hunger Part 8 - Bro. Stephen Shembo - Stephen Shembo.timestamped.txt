[57:20] in the middle and praying we kind of go
[57:23] down a little bit one octave down and
[57:26] then we got to pick up again so let's go
[57:28] ahead and pray Heavenly Father Lord we
[57:31] are approaching you humbly this morning

[57:53] when we come back and everything is
[57:55] working well we want to be grateful to
[57:57] thank you for everything Lord father
[58:00] that you are accomplishing and doing in

[58:29] streaming or will be streaming down the
[58:32] road father thank you for your children
[58:34] making their way to service because we
[58:36] don't know what kind of fight they have
[58:38] been under but despite the fight father
[58:41] they are showing this morning which side
[58:43] they are they are this morning hungry
[58:45] and waiting to hear from thee that's why
[58:48] we are asking you this morning give us
[58:50] this day our daily bread father we
[58:53] humbly ask it and commit everything unto
[58:55] thy hand rebuking every devil and setan
[58:59] himself away from this place in the name
[59:02] of Jesus Christ amen amen Genesis
[59:06] chapter
[59:08] 41 stay put with your
[59:11] Bible do not be somebody who sit and say
[59:15] well he's just going to read it you will
[59:17] miss it amen amen Genesis 41 verse 28 if
[59:24] you thereare you can say
[59:27] Amen this is the thing which I have
[59:31] spoken to Pharaoh you know the
[59:34] background of this story Pharaoh had a
[59:37] dream and the dream was doubled yes in
[59:41] other word those two dream cannot be
[59:43] separated amen it's a dream that is
[59:47] double and it's combined into one dream
[59:51] are we together and according to the
[59:54] first Dream the first Dream deal with
[59:58] wheat are we together the first Dream
[1:00:05] oh I always have
[1:00:09] backup it's hard to be ambushed with the
[1:00:12] message of the hour because we got the
[1:00:14] devil answer I I need one more brother
[1:00:17] Robert the first Dream deals with a
[1:00:21] wheat or I can call it a wheat plant
[1:00:25] amen you know seven years of things and
[1:00:28] youve seen that in cartoons in movie
[1:00:31] everything so you can Jehovah Witnesses
[1:00:33] books whatever you already seen all of
[1:00:36] that amen so it deals with the wheat and
[1:00:39] the second dream doesn't deal with the
[1:00:42] wheat but it deals with
[1:00:46] animals and the animal is a
[1:00:51] cow we clear an animal in the Bible
[1:00:55] means
[1:00:57] what it means power both of these dreams
[1:01:02] are
[1:01:04] symbolic amen amen when they are
[1:01:07] symbolic it means nobody can break into
[1:01:10] those dream except a prophet
[1:01:14] amen we clear it together we clear it
[1:01:17] together so one dream have
[1:01:21] seven ears of corn and the other one has
[1:01:25] also seven you remember the dream we got
[1:01:29] seven dealing with seven and they are
[1:01:31] two combined
[1:01:34] together this have a story of a wheat
[1:01:40] plant and this other one is dealing with
[1:01:45] animals thank you verse 28 this is the
[1:01:49] thing which I have spoken to
[1:01:51] Pharaoh what God is is about to do what
[1:01:56] to do he show to who Pharaoh now who's
[1:02:01] about to do this God almighty God you
[1:02:04] might be seated so this dream God is the
[1:02:11] author and he is also the
[1:02:15] finisher oh the one that's going to
[1:02:18] fulfill the dream but this dream doesn't
[1:02:22] contain only good stuff that's
[1:02:26] right there are seven years of
[1:02:30] famine and there are seven years of
[1:02:33] plenty we clear who's going to bring the
[1:02:37] Plenty who's bringing the
[1:02:43] famine so both the
[1:02:48] blessing I told you to follow me
[1:02:50] carefully both the
[1:02:52] blessing and the curse Es are coming
[1:02:55] from who
[1:02:58] God the good and the evil is coming from
[1:03:02] who
[1:03:06] God let me help somebody before somebody
[1:03:09] lose a wing listen to The Book of
[1:03:12] lamentation chapter 3:
[1:03:16] 38 Jeremiah say out of the
[1:03:20] mouth of who the most high out of the
[1:03:23] mouth of the most high proceedeth not
[1:03:26] what evil and what
[1:03:31] good and the mouth of the most high
[1:03:35] sometime could be the mouth of this man
[1:03:41] himself call the Lord Jesus Christ but
[1:03:44] sometime the mouth of God is a person
[1:03:49] that's it is a man it is called a
[1:03:52] prophet am a prophet is the mouth of God
[1:03:56] that's why a prophet can bring a
[1:03:59] blessing or a prophet can bring a
[1:04:03] curse we clear together are we okay so
[1:04:07] we talking about a dream that contain a
[1:04:09] whe plant with seven ears and we got
[1:04:12] seven animals with with a second dream
[1:04:17] now let's clam he says it's God who's
[1:04:20] doing it we clear verse 29 behold the
[1:04:24] come seven years of what great great
[1:04:27] what plenty we got seven
[1:04:31] years of
[1:04:33] great
[1:04:37] plenty are we together 7even years of
[1:04:41] great plenty throughout all the land of
[1:04:44] what
[1:04:45] Egypt and this is Joseph is is
[1:04:48] explaining interpreting the dream verse
[1:04:51] 30 and they shall arise after them what
[1:04:55] seven years of famine we got seven
[1:05:00] years of
[1:05:05] famine amen thank you Jesus who's
[1:05:09] bringing the femine
[1:05:11] God who is bringing the Plenty God why
[1:05:15] is God bringing the
[1:05:17] femine yes he already brought the Plenty
[1:05:21] why is he bringing the famine what is
[1:05:23] the purpose of the famine why do you let
[1:05:26] people suffer for seven
[1:05:29] years what is in the in that suffering
[1:05:33] that you
[1:05:36] enjoy in that fine you sitting and
[1:05:40] you're watching people starving what is
[1:05:43] in that God
[1:05:45] like who's bringing the famine
[1:05:48] God thank you verse 30 and they shall
[1:05:52] arise after them seven years years of
[1:05:54] famine yes and all the Plenty shall be
[1:05:59] how forgotten in the what land of Egypt
[1:06:02] so the level of this famine will make
[1:06:06] you forget everything that was before
[1:06:11] Jesus so God is bringing a
[1:06:14] blessing of seven years a great blessing
[1:06:18] amen for seven years great blessing for
[1:06:21] seven years but there is a fine that is
[1:06:24] coming up but this fine has it
[1:06:27] coming are we together when he struck
[1:06:30] the land of Egypt you won't even
[1:06:33] remember what you have for
[1:06:35] plenty in other word it's going to be a
[1:06:38] severe famine that will be that will
[1:06:42] make you
[1:06:44] forgot everything that God did
[1:06:48] before and who's bringing that kind of
[1:06:51] fine God how many years seven
[1:06:55] years we clear we okay praise God verse
[1:07:01] uh 30 which says and all the Plenty
[1:07:04] shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt
[1:07:08] and the famine shall consume what the
[1:07:12] land verse 31 and the Plenty shall not
[1:07:17] be known in the
[1:07:19] land by reason of the femine following M
[1:07:25] amen for it shall be how very Grievous
[1:07:29] in other words the magnitude of the
[1:07:32] famine is greater than the
[1:07:35] blessing come on Lord how can God bring
[1:07:39] something like that it's going to be
[1:07:41] very
[1:07:45] Grievous what are you trying to preach
[1:07:48] today chill
[1:07:50] out are we okay amen verse 32 and for
[1:07:55] that the dream was what doubled unto
[1:07:59] Pharaoh repeat
[1:08:02] it amen double unto Pharaoh twice it is
[1:08:08] because they think is how established by
[1:08:11] God established means it's determined by
[1:08:14] God in other word God won't back
[1:08:18] up whether you like it or not whether
[1:08:21] you pray or not God want back up am God
[1:08:24] is determined it's going to
[1:08:27] happen what is happening something bad
[1:08:30] is going to happen after something
[1:08:34] Gooden everybody's shaking already amen
[1:08:37] all the land of Egypt are shaking
[1:08:40] Pharaoh is shaking oh oh the second news
[1:08:45] is is is more attractive than the first
[1:08:51] news let me go this route
[1:08:54] if they tell you tomorrow they're going
[1:08:56] to bless you with everything it's not
[1:08:58] going to happen to any of you including
[1:09:00] me if they tell you tomorrow you're
[1:09:02] going to get a great blessing and after
[1:09:04] you finish enjoying you die how are you
[1:09:07] going to be are you going to be thinking
[1:09:10] about the blessing what are what is your
[1:09:12] attraction going
[1:09:15] into the attraction is going toward the
[1:09:18] curse in other word that curse begin to
[1:09:22] even remove the joy of the blessing you
[1:09:25] won't be thinking like tomorrow I'm
[1:09:27] going to be blessed what is going to
[1:09:29] preoccupy your mind will be tomorrow I'm
[1:09:32] going to die tomorrow I'm going to die
[1:09:34] what do I need to fix no no no you're
[1:09:36] going to enjoy first no forget about
[1:09:37] enjoying after enjoying I'm going to die

[1:09:41] is bringing a news he say hey s Years
[1:09:44] you'll be good but seven years you're
[1:09:46] going to see something bad and what
[1:09:48] you're going to see is more greater than
[1:09:51] the good oh my God in other way they
[1:09:54] took everything why is God magnifying
[1:09:56] something
[1:09:59] bad what is in that
[1:10:01] famine that that I can look through the
[1:10:04] famine through the starvation through
[1:10:07] the
[1:10:09] [Music]
[1:10:11] hunger we be clear together what is in
[1:10:14] the Hunger that God it wanted so much
[1:10:19] that God is determined to bring
[1:10:22] it
[1:10:24] that's
[1:10:26] good now your Canon are opening up
[1:10:29] that's what I like amen amen amen he say
[1:10:33] the the dream was doubled to Pharaoh
[1:10:37] twice it is because the thing is how
[1:10:40] established by God it's determined by
[1:10:42] God and God will how shortly bring it to
[1:10:45] in other way it won't take too long
[1:10:46] you're going to get it amen so as the
[1:10:49] year of Plenty started you say yeah yeah
[1:10:52] let's just eat something is coming up
[1:10:55] there so everybody begin to think what
[1:10:57] will we'll do when after this plent is
[1:11:00] finished so should we store should
[1:11:03] we what is going on Amen verse 33 get
[1:11:08] ready now therefore let Pharaoh look out
[1:11:13] a
[1:11:14] man who is how discreet remember Joseph
[1:11:18] is a
[1:11:21] prophet we're dealing with
[1:11:26] Joseph and Joseph who is a
[1:11:30] prophet I'm going to Define this Joseph
[1:11:34] to you so everything is clean as we keep
[1:11:38] moving up amen amen amen amen amen yes
[1:11:44] sir because brother brandham say every
[1:11:46] scripture have a compound meaning and
[1:11:49] many
[1:11:50] applications are we together to give you
[1:11:53] a hand about this Joseph this Joseph
[1:11:56] unfolded or interpreted or described a
[1:12:01] dream that is dealing with the history
[1:12:04] of a wheat
[1:12:07] plant so Joseph is able to tell you
[1:12:10] about the wheat plant he can tell you
[1:12:12] that if a corn is fallen in the
[1:12:16] ground are we together I'm I'm I'm
[1:12:19] describing your Joseph that corn will
[1:12:22] get down into Earth and when the corn
[1:12:25] come up from the earth it come up into
[1:12:28] three
[1:12:30] stages there is a Joseph that described
[1:12:33] that and he say it goes through
[1:12:36] Luther there is a Joseph who described
[1:12:38] that and he goes through Wesley and he
[1:12:41] goes to the Pentecost which he produces
[1:12:45] the Shar and inside the Shar there is a
[1:12:48] grain so Joseph is the one that will
[1:12:52] describe the seven Church changes
[1:12:55] am are we together are we together and
[1:12:59] that Joseph is a prophet but he's not
[1:13:02] going to stop only on the seven Church
[1:13:05] ages he has to break the seals where
[1:13:08] there is the power of an
[1:13:12] animal have I lost somebody have I lost
[1:13:15] somebody have I lost somebody when they
[1:13:18] open the first seal where was it an
[1:13:20] animal when they open the second seal
[1:13:22] where was it a cow an animal everybody
[1:13:26] okay so that Joseph must be able to
[1:13:28] decode what the animal means in other
[1:13:31] word our Joseph today is the Joseph that
[1:13:35] would teach us the seven Church ages and
[1:13:38] he also will teach us the seventh seal
[1:13:42] because the churches and the seals are
[1:13:45] combined everybody together so to make
[1:13:49] your long story short this Joseph is a
[1:13:52] top of William Marion
[1:13:54] [Applause]
[1:13:57] Bram are we okay are we
[1:14:01] together keep that in mind as we
[1:14:05] traveling we okay now we okay now okay
[1:14:10] if I lost you raise your
[1:14:13] hand if I lost you raise your hand I
[1:14:15] want to see your hand don't be afraid
[1:14:17] we're a
[1:14:18] family okay everybody's good oh
[1:14:21] somebody's
[1:14:22] there
[1:14:24] the first deal with a whe plan if you
[1:14:26] study the church ages brother brandham
[1:14:28] described the church ages as a story of
[1:14:30] a whe plan if you study the seals the
[1:14:33] seals deals with animal as a symbol
[1:14:35] that's right but nobody can interpret
[1:14:38] this only a prophet and no one was able
[1:14:41] to describe the church ages the way
[1:14:43] brother Bram described people tried and
[1:14:46] they attempted to describe the church
[1:14:48] ages but they were locked under the
[1:14:50] seals when they interpreted the seal
[1:14:52] they inter interpretation was wrong
[1:14:54] because only a prophetic messenger not a
[1:14:58] teacher not a pastor not an evangelist
[1:15:01] only a prophet Vindicated is able to
[1:15:05] come and to open the seals amen so
[1:15:08] Joseph will not stop only at teaching
[1:15:10] you the church ages but he must also
[1:15:13] unfold the seals to you and the seals
[1:15:16] and the church ages go together amen any
[1:15:18] question so far are we clear my friend
[1:15:21] amen thank you all right
[1:15:24] verse uh 33 he says now therefore let
[1:15:27] Pharaoh do what look out a man a man
[1:15:30] that is how discreet and wise discreet
[1:15:33] and wise and set him over the land of
[1:15:35] what Egypt who do you think they're
[1:15:37] going to
[1:15:41] get who do you think Pharaoh will
[1:15:44] get who are they going to entrust to
[1:15:49] this amen amen amen amen do you know
[1:15:53] that Pharaoh sometime is a Tope of God
[1:15:56] that's
[1:15:59] right do you know that no problem okay
[1:16:02] let's continue verse uh 34 let Pharaoh
[1:16:06] do this follow me and let him appoint
[1:16:11] what officers if you look officers are
[1:16:15] plural but the officer are not the man
[1:16:19] that was appointed that is wise that's
[1:16:21] it that's it that's it I'm cleaning up
[1:16:24] certain things quickly let's go back to
[1:16:26] verse 33 can you read 33 for me my
[1:16:29] friend now therefore let Pharaoh look
[1:16:32] out a man stop a man is how plural oring
[1:16:35] singular so there is a man there is a
[1:16:38] man how is that man discreet he's
[1:16:43] discreet discreet and what
[1:16:46] wise we know what wisdom means H the
[1:16:49] Bible says wisdom is has built
[1:16:53] pillar that's right on
[1:16:56] seven seven pillar you know what it
[1:16:59] means right and a pillar is a
[1:17:01] person you know
[1:17:06] that do you know what a uh white hair
[1:17:10] means so when the chief the judges goes
[1:17:14] to in London to go judge a case they
[1:17:17] take a white wig and they put there why
[1:17:20] why are they putting the wig it show you
[1:17:23] what so we also had a wig that's right
[1:17:28] that's
[1:17:29] right everybody okay that wig is over
[1:17:32] there Amen brother Bram call that the
[1:17:35] wig that is crowning the Lord Jesus
[1:17:38] Christ amen meaning that the wisdom of
[1:17:41] God have come
[1:17:43] amen are we together have I lost
[1:17:47] someone so there is a man that is
[1:17:49] discreet and how wise number two verse3
[1:17:53] before we got
[1:17:54] officers if you notice they are
[1:17:57] plural amen so these officer will be
[1:18:01] under the men
[1:18:03] amen the officer are not the men that's
[1:18:07] right the officer must work with the
[1:18:09] vision of the man that will be appointed
[1:18:12] to store
[1:18:16] food don't worry my friend you will
[1:18:18] catch me Amen Let Pharaoh verse 34 do
[1:18:23] this let him appoint what officers
[1:18:26] plural where over the land over the land
[1:18:30] and and take up what the fifth part of
[1:18:33] the land of Egypt and the what in the
[1:18:35] seven plen years okay so Joseph is
[1:18:39] giving up an advice he says when we have
[1:18:42] seven years
[1:18:44] of of Plenty appoint an officer I
[1:18:48] appoint a man and that man will work
[1:18:51] with officers
[1:18:54] the ministry of D
[1:18:56] [Music]
[1:18:57] men everybody okay is not to capture
[1:19:01] everything that is plenty in the seven
[1:19:07] years are we together the ministry of
[1:19:11] this man is everything that is plenty
[1:19:15] everything that is plenty all the
[1:19:18] plenty of the seven years amen you only
[1:19:24] take what you take a fif of
[1:19:27] it everybody okay and the fif need to be
[1:19:31] what
[1:19:37] stored let me help you now how will be
[1:19:40] the fine severe very what
[1:19:45] Grievous and in order to withstand that
[1:19:50] fine you following me only only a
[1:19:57] fif are we reading different
[1:20:00] Bible okay let's read my friend let's
[1:20:04] read let Pharaoh do this let him appoint
[1:20:08] officer over the land and take up what
[1:20:11] at the fifth part of the land of Egypt
[1:20:15] in the what seven plest years so you
[1:20:17] take seven plenty years and you take the
[1:20:21] fifth part of it
[1:20:23] amen and you store
[1:20:25] it so the ministry of Joseph is not to
[1:20:31] capture everything that goes during the
[1:20:34] seven
[1:20:36] years are you following me are you
[1:20:39] following me so during the seven years
[1:20:43] Joseph has a Ministry his ministry is
[1:20:46] not everything that is coming up in the
[1:20:49] seven years the ministry of Joseph is
[1:20:53] that when the years of plenty are going
[1:20:57] Joseph will suddenly begin to catch
[1:21:00] certain
[1:21:04] food do you follow me do you follow
[1:21:10] me we have first year we have second
[1:21:14] year we have third year we have four
[1:21:17] fourth year we have the fifth one we
[1:21:20] have the sixth one and the Seven all
[1:21:22] this year will be
[1:21:24] plenty amen and the sum of these years
[1:21:28] we will take a fifth part of it amen so
[1:21:32] throughout the seven years Joseph if
[1:21:36] this year produce 100% Joseph cannot
[1:21:40] take
[1:21:41] 100%
[1:21:46] Jo can I continue now can I continue sir
[1:21:50] can I continue amen can I continue so if
[1:21:54] this year produce 100% Joseph would take
[1:21:58] a certain
[1:22:02] percentage I'm just picking up a number
[1:22:05] can I pick up a percentage what how much
[1:22:07] do you want me to pick up 20 20 right me
[1:22:12] and you agree so it's me and brother
[1:22:14] Angelo it's not a quote okay we just
[1:22:17] taken an example so in other word when
[1:22:19] this year produce 100%
[1:22:23] 80% goes to the
[1:22:26] population enjoy and do what you want to
[1:22:29] do everybody okay and
[1:22:32] 20% will disappear from the population
[1:22:36] in other word no matter how much you
[1:22:39] going to leave in this year you will be
[1:22:41] missing
[1:22:47] 20% let me help you up quickly no matter
[1:22:51] how much blessing God go will bring into
[1:22:54] the first year there will be a portion
[1:22:57] of that blessing that will be
[1:23:02] lost are we together do you follow me do
[1:23:06] you follow me do you follow me so in the
[1:23:10] year the first year according to
[1:23:13] whatever we agree with brother Angelo
[1:23:16] 80% will be given to the population but
[1:23:19] 20% will be lost from the hand of the
[1:23:23] population and
[1:23:24] 20% will belong to the ministry of
[1:23:28] Joseph so Joseph is not really
[1:23:31] interested in
[1:23:33] 80% Joseph always look for a percentage
[1:23:37] that he can retrieve from the population
[1:23:40] and the population of that year will
[1:23:43] never have access to that
[1:23:49] 20% can I help you up this
[1:23:53] 20% can never be used during the seven
[1:24:00] years they are taken for the year of
[1:24:08] famine everybody okay everybody okay is
[1:24:12] it too hard my friend so the second year
[1:24:15] Joseph will take
[1:24:17] 20% the third year Joseph would take 20%
[1:24:21] the fourth that's this is what we agree
[1:24:24] and then 20% and then 20% and then 20%
[1:24:28] so at the end of 7 years we ended up
[1:24:32] with
[1:24:34] 140% this percentage nobody have access
[1:24:38] to
[1:24:39] it nobody can eat this wheat only Joseph
[1:24:45] can deliver that
[1:24:48] wheat are we together are we together
[1:24:52] I'm going to help you up just follow me
[1:24:54] we'll be okay job to verse 35 amen amen
[1:24:58] and let them do what gather all the what
[1:25:02] food of those good years that come and
[1:25:05] lay that what corn under the hand of
[1:25:08] pharaoh under the hand of who
[1:25:10] Pharaoh so
[1:25:13] this
[1:25:15] 140% doesn't belong to the people of
[1:25:19] Egypt amen amen amen
[1:25:23] he belongs to Pharaoh so Joseph is
[1:25:27] taking 20% off from you and keep it back
[1:25:32] to
[1:25:35] Pharaoh it's given to Pharaoh it's going
[1:25:39] to do you good my friend do you see why
[1:25:41] I told you if I can deliver 5% everybody
[1:25:44] okay what are you trying to say brother
[1:25:47] Steven before I get lost
[1:25:51] more are we together are we together the
[1:25:55] ministry of Joseph is not to capture 80%
[1:26:00] of
[1:26:01] food Joseph only captured 20% of what
[1:26:06] happened in other words every year will
[1:26:09] lose
[1:26:12] food there will be certain food that
[1:26:15] will escape the people and be store back
[1:26:19] to
[1:26:20] Pharaoh everybody okay so the ministry
[1:26:24] of Joseph is now really a Ministry that
[1:26:28] is coming to bring you 80% every year
[1:26:32] Joseph has a Ministry and his ministry
[1:26:36] is to gather up
[1:26:40] Amen to gather up to gather
[1:26:45] up the food that has been lost amen amen
[1:26:52] amen through the seven years amen and
[1:26:55] story back for the time of famine amen
[1:27:02] hallelujah are you together so no matter
[1:27:06] have G views that feminis do you follow
[1:27:09] me no matter how great the femine is 80%
[1:27:14] will never match that
[1:27:19] femine as much as 80% seems to be big to
[1:27:24] us if you store 80% the fine will
[1:27:28] overcome you you have to take only a fif
[1:27:31] per a fif of it this fifth here is
[1:27:36] sufficient to withstand the greatest
[1:27:40] femine that is bigger than all the seven
[1:27:42] years because the thief is taken out of
[1:27:46] all the seven years and it's taken in
[1:27:49] storage to withstand what is coming com
[1:27:53] up so the future hunger can only be
[1:27:58] satisfied by the food that was
[1:28:01] collected throughout the seven
[1:28:05] years
[1:28:08] hallu if you are hungry on the during
[1:28:11] the year of Hing you only can get food
[1:28:14] from the food that were
[1:28:16] collected so if you ask Joseph you say
[1:28:21] Joseph which year of of of uh of uh of
[1:28:26] corn do you have do you have the first
[1:28:29] year of corn do you have the second year
[1:28:32] of corn do you have the third year of
[1:28:34] corn or the fourth year Joseph say truly
[1:28:37] I don't have a specific
[1:28:39] day my corn got everything so in my corn
[1:28:45] I have the first year I have the second
[1:28:48] year I have the third year I have the
[1:28:50] fourth year and I also have the seven
[1:28:53] years so my Ministry is not a specific
[1:28:57] Ministry it is a Ministry that is
[1:29:00] gathering up the seven Church ages
[1:29:03] [Applause]
[1:29:05] amen everybody together amen are we
[1:29:08] climbing up together
[1:29:11] am ah my friend let's go ahead and sett
[1:29:15] this before I take off again higher if I
[1:29:17] lost you raise your hand GL GL GL it's a
[1:29:20] different Canon my friend Amen brother
[1:29:23] I'm saying now sending what for this
[1:29:26] messenger the what seventh angel here is
[1:29:29] sending forth what his message to who to
[1:29:32] the leodan church notice his type of
[1:29:36] message now he was not to the first
[1:29:40] Angel was not given to that second Angel
[1:29:44] no third no fourth no fifth no sixth no
[1:29:49] but it is to who the seventh angel that
[1:29:52] had what this type of message what was
[1:29:55] it notice his type of what message for
[1:29:59] the second time his message is to do
[1:30:01] what finishing all the mysteries of God
[1:30:04] to finish all the Mysteries mysteries of
[1:30:07] God that are written in the what book
[1:30:09] and the Seven Angel is doing what
[1:30:12] winding up all the mystery that has been
[1:30:14] laid what loose ended all through this
[1:30:18] what organization and what denomination
[1:30:21] the seven Ang gathered them up and
[1:30:23] finish the what the entire mystery that
[1:30:26] is what the Bible say he finished the
[1:30:28] mystery of the what written book so the
[1:30:30] message of brother Bram is not a message
[1:30:33] of one age amen it is a message that is
[1:30:37] gathering up the loose end that were
[1:30:40] lost throughout the ages amen and
[1:30:43] because of this loose end that's why the
[1:30:46] devil always make the church
[1:30:49] fall because the church never had
[1:30:53] 100% the population was never exposed to
[1:30:57] 100% of whe the population always took
[1:31:02] 80% and the devil attack where they're
[1:31:05] missing there it
[1:31:07] is are we together are we together so
[1:31:10] when the devil approaches you he will
[1:31:13] check he say they can match 80% the
[1:31:16] devil say no if I attack him on 10%
[1:31:19] they're going to win me if I attack on
[1:31:21] 20 they will win if I attack on 80 they
[1:31:23] will win let me attack them between 90
[1:31:26] and 100 and as soon as he hit that spot
[1:31:29] you are empty you don't have the food to
[1:31:32] withstand the devil in that aspect
[1:31:35] that's why Luther became a
[1:31:38] denomination everybody okay that's why
[1:31:40] Wesley became a denomination that's why
[1:31:42] the Pentecostal are going the way
[1:31:44] they're going because they cannot have
[1:31:47] the full access to the food but every
[1:31:50] year God has been taking certain things
[1:31:54] off God was taking certain crumbs
[1:31:58] off everybody okay but the end time
[1:32:02] Messenger will take all this mystery
[1:32:05] here and put back together so now the
[1:32:08] devil doesn't know where to go if he
[1:32:11] attack me the way he attack Luther I
[1:32:14] have Luther answering if he attacked me
[1:32:17] the way he attacked Pentecost I have the
[1:32:19] Pentecost what the meod miss a heaven
[1:32:23] what Paul miss a heaven
[1:32:27] amen because Paul
[1:32:29] preaching what I'm preaching is not
[1:32:32] important I am preaching the full
[1:32:34] revelation of God and I got the devil
[1:32:37] answer so no matter which way the devil
[1:32:40] is coming makon will always satisfy him
[1:32:44] because the devil at the end time will
[1:32:46] be bad he will be more severe than the
[1:32:50] devil at the beginning because the last
[1:32:52] stage will gather all the demon together
[1:32:55] that's why you need a Ministry that
[1:32:57] gather up all the loser in order to
[1:33:00] produce the the answers to the
[1:33:05] devil are we together amen are we
[1:33:09] together did you find yourself
[1:33:14] back let's go ahead my friend brother
[1:33:16] Bram say until he come to water that
[1:33:19] last angel now he say what no certain Mi
[1:33:25] mystery so the message of brother Bram
[1:33:28] you cannot pinpointed to
[1:33:32] one you cannot you cannot say that the
[1:33:35] food of Joseph is for the first year no
[1:33:39] it is the food that is mixed with all
[1:33:41] the
[1:33:42] years it is an amalgamation of the year
[1:33:46] it is a mixture of the
[1:33:50] years

[1:33:55] what gathers up all what all that has
[1:33:58] been what lost in them what other ages
[1:34:01] all truth that was not what truly
[1:34:04] revealed yet because the people of Egypt
[1:34:07] never tested the
[1:34:10] 20% every year they can test the 80% but
[1:34:14] they are certain meat
[1:34:18] that if you ask them do you know this
[1:34:20] kind of meat say mm we never were
[1:34:23] exposed to it why because Joseph took it
[1:34:28] away everybody okay he says as re as a
[1:34:32] revelation come then he revealed those
[1:34:34] things where in his days if you want to
[1:34:36] read it where is it Revelation 10 one to
[1:34:40] about what you shall get it take the
[1:34:42] book and the what seal and do what break

[1:34:48] alone only Joseph has the miss myores of
[1:34:52] God is the ministry of the what seventh
[1:34:55] Angels now we just come through the
[1:34:57] church ages with even history and prove
[1:34:59] that it is the Angel's message of the
[1:35:02] seven Church all right who does what
[1:35:04] Reveals All the Mysteries that has been
[1:35:07] in the P all the things in the so the

[1:37:00] which is a mixture of the food that is
[1:37:03] what you need for the seven years it
[1:37:05] looks so

[1:37:59] Egypt but you're going to see how much
[1:38:01] he's going to
[1:38:02] save it looks like when Joseph is
[1:38:05] preaching when Joseph is gathering the
[1:38:08] food he's preparing the food only for
[1:38:10] the land of
[1:38:14] Egypt but the food was not only for the

[1:44:37] Throne will I be what greater than thou
[1:44:40] so it is very easy to be
[1:44:44] [Applause]
[1:44:45] confused between pharaoh and
[1:44:49] Joseph come on
[1:44:53] that's why John in the Book of
[1:44:56] Revelation twice he fell before the
[1:44:58] angel and tried to worship Him and the
[1:45:01] angel said don't do that because only
[1:45:04] the
[1:45:05] throne only the throne only the throne
[1:45:09] is the difference the only one sitting
[1:45:12] in the throne is Jesus
[1:45:14] [Applause]
[1:45:17] Christ everybody okay because when God
[1:45:20] came down in human flesh God turned the
[1:45:23] back and when God came down in this he
[1:45:27] was not God he was not the man Jesus he
[1:45:32] was William Maran Bram but he's not on
[1:45:35] the throne the only difference is the
[1:45:39] [Applause]
[1:45:43] throne that's why we don't worship him
[1:45:46] we worship Jesus Christ because we
[1:45:50] understand the difference that as much
[1:45:52] as God use him he's not on the throne
[1:45:56] the one on the throne is
[1:46:01] [Applause]
[1:46:05] Pharaoh Have I Lost somebody in the back
[1:46:09] are we okay are we okay my friend have I
[1:46:12] lost somebody
[1:46:14] here I pray God if I can reach 5% my
[1:46:18] friend can we continue can we continue
[1:46:21] amen can we continue amen verse
[1:46:25] 41 and Pharaoh said to who Joseph see I
[1:46:30] have set you off water all the land of
[1:46:35] Egypt somebody is lost let's go back to
[1:46:38] verse 40 you shall be of a water my
[1:46:41] house and according to the what Thy word
[1:46:44] have you seen in the scripture where
[1:46:46] they say House of Aaron House of Moses
[1:46:50] and they and they are cting the
[1:46:53] priesthood the Bible say Moses built a
[1:46:56] house which house did Moses
[1:47:01] built was he the house of Moses who was
[1:47:05] over the house God Solomon built a house
[1:47:07] was he the Temple of Solomon he was the
[1:47:10] Temple of who but Solomon was in
[1:47:13] charge that's
[1:47:15] right Joseph is over the house of
[1:47:18] pharaoh he knows he he he's he's the the
[1:47:21] the the the caliber of the spirit in
[1:47:24] Joseph Pharaoh can leave everything and
[1:47:27] take his hand off and Pharaoh can travel
[1:47:29] in the
[1:47:30] universe because Joseph will do
[1:47:37] exactly the way a prophet interpret a
[1:47:40] dream a prophet must see the dream
[1:47:42] himself in other word the prophet must
[1:47:45] get in your
[1:47:47] mind so what happened is Joseph got
[1:47:50] Inside the Mind of pharaoh and saw what
[1:47:53] Pharaoh saw and he came back and
[1:47:57] interpreted and William Mar Bram went in
[1:48:00] the back path in the mind of
[1:48:03] God and what he's preaching is what he
[1:48:06] saw inside the
[1:48:10] [Applause]
[1:48:14] mind that's why brother Bram can tell
[1:48:16] you I can take you to a dream I'm
[1:48:18] standing and I'm watching the Pillar of
[1:48:20] Fire playing like a baby in the universe
[1:48:23] where is he seeing that have you heard a
[1:48:26] preacher preaching that you got to go
[1:48:28] back before the
[1:48:30] beginning not in the beginning in the
[1:48:33] beginning it start in Genesis 1:1 in
[1:48:36] order to go before the beginning the key
[1:48:39] the entrance is not Genesis one the
[1:48:41] entrance is in John John chapter 1 one
[1:48:45] in the beginning was the word that's
[1:48:47] where you entered there and then you
[1:48:50] back up from there and you go before the
[1:48:53] [Applause]
[1:48:57] beginning Have I Lost somebody have I
[1:49:00] lost someone are we together amen is the
[1:49:03] CPR Good Sister Amy the
[1:49:08] breathing Hallelujah are we together now
[1:49:12] no more we back on track let's continue
[1:49:15] what was it 41 verse 41 and Pharaoh said
[1:49:19] to who Joseph she say what I have set
[1:49:22] over I have set thee over all the land
[1:49:25] of Egypt and Pharaoh took off what his
[1:49:29] ring
[1:49:32] amen and did
[1:49:35] what from his hand and put it upon
[1:49:38] Joseph's hand so the Ring of pharaoh is
[1:49:42] no longer in the finger of
[1:49:47] pharaoh it is in the finger of of Joseph
[1:49:51] amen you remember how the Ring of King
[1:49:53] Aus was taken off and given to Esther it
[1:49:57] mean whatever you say you can sanction
[1:50:00] it
[1:50:01] [Applause]
[1:50:02] amen in other words Pharaoh knows that
[1:50:06] Joseph cannot abuse the power even if
[1:50:10] people are doing something wrong in the
[1:50:12] church when they say Pharaoh speak the
[1:50:14] word Joseph speak the word Joseph will
[1:50:17] look and say I forgive them and God say
[1:50:20] that's exactly the way I would
[1:50:22] [Applause]

[1:51:17] not the first Chariot he's on the second
[1:51:21] position Hallelujah he's on the second
[1:51:23] position not the first one the first one
[1:51:26] is the king himself but on the second un
[1:51:29] command from from Enoch to him there is
[1:51:34] nobody that is like brother Bram the
[1:51:37] only one that is above him is Jesus
[1:51:41] Christ when son when when Jesus come
[1:51:44] Solomon was the greater of all when
[1:51:47] Jesus come he said there is a greater
[1:51:50] Solon when brother Bram come he preaches
[1:51:53] he said there is a greater than all of
[1:51:57] [Applause]
[1:51:59] them the difference is in the second
[1:52:02] Chariot only the throne is above that's
[1:52:05] why we don't worship him but we worship
[1:52:08] this
[1:52:10] one are we together are we together are

[1:52:23] Chariot which he had and they CED before
[1:52:25] who him do what bow the knee bow their
[1:52:28] knees and made him what ruler over all
[1:52:31] the land of Egypt are we together amen
[1:52:33] jum to verse 47 my
[1:52:37] friend who have a confusion now who's uh
[1:52:40] uh uh
[1:52:42] Joseph you know who Joseph is now right
[1:52:46] you know his ministry now let's see the
[1:52:48] fif what has going what is going on with
[1:52:51] the fief let's go to verse 47 don't be
[1:52:54] tired my friend I'm just at the
[1:52:55] beginning of my scripture don't be tired
[1:53:00] everybody okay verse 47 and in the seven
[1:53:03] years in the seven PL years what
[1:53:06] happened the Earth brought forth by
[1:53:08] handfuls so it happened abundantly verse
[1:53:12] 48 and what and he gathered up all the
[1:53:14] food of the seven years which were in
[1:53:17] the land of what Egypt and laid up the
[1:53:19] food F in the water
[1:53:23] cities and the food of the water field
[1:53:27] which was what round about every city he
[1:53:30] laid up what in the same verse 49 let's
[1:53:34] go my friend and Joseph gathered corn as
[1:53:37] the sand of the sea very much let's go
[1:53:40] slowly my friend let's go school school
[1:53:42] zone 15 miles hour Joseph gather up what
[1:53:46] corn as what the sand of the sea
[1:53:51] let me ask you a question what is how
[1:53:55] many corn is he
[1:53:57] getting when I told you a fif you
[1:54:00] thought you were small but the scripture
[1:54:02] said the fif was like what of the sea do
[1:54:06] we have a number for
[1:54:09] that can I continue it's like the sand
[1:54:12] of the sea go ahead my friend very much
[1:54:15] very much until he left numbering for he
[1:54:19] was what without
[1:54:23] number so the food that was gathered
[1:54:27] throughout the seven years was a food
[1:54:30] that have not a
[1:54:33] number it is a food that is so much
[1:54:37] until you cannot put a stop and say we
[1:54:40] reach the end of it that's why this
[1:54:43] message every time we
[1:54:47] preach it seems like it keep up opening
[1:54:50] up opening up it looks like the Bible
[1:54:53] never
[1:54:54] stop amen it is the food of it's the
[1:54:58] fifth part this part here is
[1:55:02] unlimited are we together are we
[1:55:05] together that's why you listen to a tape
[1:55:07] you go back again you listen and
[1:55:09] something open up and after two years it
[1:55:11] open up because you cannot put a stop
[1:55:15] into this Revelation this is an
[1:55:17] unlimited message amen that's why there
[1:55:20] is no other message like this one and it
[1:55:23] is the last message because it's God on
[1:55:26] unlimited
[1:55:30] power are we together in order to
[1:55:33] withstand the seven Grievious year of
[1:55:36] Egypt you only need a food that is
[1:55:40] Unlimited in a power in other words the
[1:55:43] seven years can come as the coming we
[1:55:46] don't have a number if it's a first year
[1:55:48] we keep pulling up and the first year

[1:56:58] what Egypt where what ended and the
[1:57:00] seven years of what d d means famine be
[1:57:04] began to come according to as who Joseph
[1:57:08] had said and the D was in all the land
[1:57:10] but in the land of Egypt there was what
[1:57:12] bread do you see how they call that they

[1:57:35] people cried to Joseph no they cried to
[1:57:39] who Pharaoh because when Joseph was
[1:57:41] gathering all the food he was gathering
[1:57:44] them under the custody of who Pharaoh so
[1:57:47] when you cry you cry to who Pharaoh for
[1:57:50] the first time the entire land of Egypt
[1:57:53] is crying to Pharaoh so the famine is
[1:57:57] used hunger is used to begin to bring
[1:58:04] Egypt back to
[1:58:11] Pharaoh are we okay are we okay Have I
[1:58:14] Lost You Have I Lost You I ask you a
[1:58:17] question I is I say what is the purpose
[1:58:21] of the famine why do we need the famine
[1:58:25] what is the purpose of a famine being
[1:58:27] more Grievous than the Plenty year there
[1:58:29] is a purpose for a
[1:58:34] famine father help me remember this back
[1:58:39] up pretty good okay as we claming in
[1:58:42] Matthew what did he say give us this day
[1:58:46] our what our daily bread look what did
[1:58:48] he say give us day by day our what Daily
[1:58:52] Bread who is asking us a child asking to
[1:58:56] who father if the hunger never
[1:59:00] came are we okay now if that child was
[1:59:04] never hungry will we remember to go back
[1:59:07] to his father so the
[1:59:10] hunger of a child is an opportunity to
[1:59:15] bring the child back to the father amen
[1:59:21] are we together are we together are we
[1:59:24] together are we together let me help you
[1:59:27] up whoever is struggling a father have
[1:59:31] two
[1:59:33] sons you know the name right it is the
[1:59:36] story of what the prodal Son and the
[1:59:39] younger one say no Daddy give me my
[1:59:41] stuff I go they give him his staff and
[1:59:44] he went what did he do he spend it with
[1:59:46] prostitute he spend it in the nightclub
[1:59:49] he did everything when the money was
[1:59:51] finished did he go back he found the job
[1:59:55] when he found the job did he go back
[1:59:58] when hunger
[2:00:00] famine when famine came in the land
[2:00:04] everybody okay everybody okay and he
[2:00:06] begin to eat with the pigs that's when
[2:00:10] the Bible say he came to himself so it
[2:00:14] took fine to bring the Revelation amen
[2:00:19] [Applause]
[2:00:21] are you following me we are teaching you
[2:00:24] how to pray it took the hunger am every
[2:00:29] every disappointment never brought that
[2:00:32] child back to God sir his friend steal
[2:00:35] his money he never went back the
[2:00:37] prostitute took his money he never went
[2:00:39] back he went and hire himself he never
[2:00:42] went back but when famine HD him when
[2:00:46] hunger HD him it was Hunger that brought
[2:00:49] him back to a revelation like wait a
[2:00:51] minute why am I suffering like this and
[2:00:54] not having food while in My Father's
[2:00:57] House the servant have plenty so famine
[2:01:01] was used to bring the child
[2:01:07] back famine was used to bring the child
[2:01:12] back to his original
[2:01:18] position together God sent plenty and
[2:01:22] then God sent also severe famine but
[2:01:26] what is the purpose of a famine he took
[2:01:29] whatever was Store and put it back in
[2:01:32] the hand of pharaoh so now all Egypt
[2:01:35] have to look up to one
[2:01:39] person even if you didn't like
[2:01:45] Pharaoh even if you are against pharaoh
[2:01:49] even if you were against his politics
[2:01:51] but when something hit you you
[2:01:54] forgetting about the politics you
[2:01:56] forgetting about the way he's ruling the
[2:01:58] nation you know where man where where
[2:02:00] can we find food there is only one place
[2:02:03] to find food it is in pharaoh who are
[2:02:06] you going to cry to Pharaoh whether you
[2:02:08] like him or not you going back to
[2:02:10] Pharaoh so feminine hunger is used to
[2:02:15] capture
[2:02:17] Egypt back into
[2:02:21] Pharaoh can I continue now Egypt is not
[2:02:25] self
[2:02:30] dependent Egypt now begin to learn to

[2:22:40] femine that brought the prodigal son
[2:22:43] back home it is the hunger that brought
[2:22:46] Egypt back to Pharaoh but Israel do not
[2:22:52] understand the mystery yet they say you
[2:22:54] know what everybody go let's keep
[2:22:57] Benjamin I don't want to lose
[2:23:00] Benjamin do you know what happened I'm
[2:23:02] not going to read the whole thing you
[2:23:03] know the story Jump to verse
[2:23:07] 38 father help me I'm I'm skipping all
[2:23:10] of this because you know they went there
[2:23:11] they pick up Simeon and they kept Simeon
[2:23:13] and everything you know what happened
[2:23:15] let's go to verse 38 if you thereare you
[2:23:17] can say amen amen let's go and he said
[2:23:20] what my son shall what not go down this
[2:23:23] is Jacob because they kept Simon and
[2:23:26] when they kept can you check that one
[2:23:27] when they kept Simeon do you know what
[2:23:29] happened when they kept Simeon they say
[2:23:32] you cannot I mean take him until we see
[2:23:35] the younger one when they went they told
[2:23:38] the father they say Simon is kept we
[2:23:41] cannot pull him up from there because uh
[2:23:44] the boss say we need Benjamin do you
[2:23:46] know you know what happened Jacob say no
[2:23:49] I already lost Joseph I'm not going to
[2:23:51] lose Benjamin do you know why because he
[2:23:55] got
[2:23:56] corn he got bread when he got bread he
[2:24:01] disregard he disregard the order of
[2:24:07] Joseph or maybe it's me and
[2:24:11] him are we together it's the devil if
[2:24:15] you want me to change I get the Bazooka
[2:24:17] you want me to change my
[2:24:28] friend praise God is that good now
[2:24:32] amen I just leave
[2:24:35] here so forget about it we clear amen so
[2:24:39] now they told Jacob they say bring
[2:24:42] Joseph uh bring Benjamin he says no no
[2:24:45] no no no no no no no why he got food do
[2:24:47] you know what happened God increased
[2:24:50] fine I'm going to go slowly and you see
[2:24:53] what happened verse 30 and he say what
[2:24:56] my son shall what not go down with you
[2:24:59] for his brother is what dead and he's
[2:25:02] left what alone do you see the uh the
[2:25:05] the ignorance of the Jew he need to be
[2:25:08] removed by Joseph continue my friend if
[2:25:11] Mischief befall him by the way in the
[2:25:14] which you go uhuh then shall you bring
[2:25:17] down my gray hairs with sorrow to the
[2:25:19] Grave so bottom line Jacob say he's not
[2:25:23] going he's staying here they say well
[2:25:25] but the men say if we go there we cannot
[2:25:28] go back to Egypt until we bring Benjamin
[2:25:32] they stop
[2:25:33] down
[2:25:35] question why didn't he have an idea to
[2:25:38] pick up anybody
[2:25:41] else and to use him in the place of
[2:25:45] Benjamin because this ministry will
[2:25:48] begin to trouble to remove your trouble
[2:25:52] and begin to bring sincerity because
[2:25:54] they to lie but this ministry begin to
[2:25:56] bring them that they realize they need
[2:25:58] to be back to the
[2:26:00] truth everybody okay but as long as they
[2:26:04] brought food down to Egypt Jacob said no
[2:26:07] guess what everybody sat down they begin

[2:34:30] everybody in Egypt went back to Pharaoh
[2:34:33] they say we need bread Pharaoh say go
[2:34:35] see
[2:34:36] who and Joseph was not giving bread for
[2:34:40] free oh wow I just read it to you we
[2:34:45] read it together you saw that right
[2:34:47] Joseph was selling
[2:34:50] bread everybody okay do you follow me in
[2:34:54] other word every Egyptian had a bank
[2:35:00] account follow me carefully and in the
[2:35:04] bank account they had
[2:35:06] money they have the purchase power some
[2:35:09] had million some have 12,000 some were
[2:35:12] overdraft in their bank
[2:35:15] account everybody okay everybody okay so
[2:35:19] when the money is there their
[2:35:23] relationship to Pharaoh is still
[2:35:27] limited they only approach pharaoh to
[2:35:31] get food because they got money right
[2:35:35] everybody okay so the first mission of
[2:35:38] Joseph was to finish the
[2:35:42] money Amen to empty all the bank account
[2:35:46] amen because Pharaoh cannot have full
[2:35:51] access do you follow me I ask you to do
[2:35:54] me a favor stay up if you tired I will
[2:35:57] stop and we can get it okay so the first
[2:36:02] mission of pharaoh of of Joseph Joseph
[2:36:05] was selling food he sold corn he sold
[2:36:09] bread amen and he got money from the
[2:36:13] Egyptian amen as soon as the Egyptian GA
[2:36:17] them money and they got the food for
[2:36:19] their home do they remember Pharaoh no
[2:36:22] they go home and they eat are you
[2:36:25] together when the food is finished what
[2:36:28] do do they have to go back go back to
[2:36:30] pharaoh and do what buy food everybody
[2:36:34] okay amen they didn't realize that their
[2:36:37] survival is now limited to
[2:36:41] Corn nobody was looking for big houses
[2:36:45] or big cars anymore everybody want to
[2:36:48] make sure because the prophecy is
[2:36:51] fulfilled and everybody say hey this is
[2:36:53] the first year there is six more to come
[2:36:56] so we need to stop playing with our
[2:36:58] money we need to stop going to the shop
[2:37:01] we need to focus our money now to the
[2:37:04] bare necessity to get our daily bread so
[2:37:08] all the more going on the mall all the
[2:37:11] spending of the money have gone down
[2:37:14] have dwindled down and it focused into
[2:37:17] bread now bread become the center of
[2:37:20] attention all the money and bread now is
[2:37:23] used by Joseph to suck the money out
[2:37:27] right are we together are we together
[2:37:30] are we together verse 13 now let's
[2:37:35] go verse 13 and there was what no bread
[2:37:39] where in all the land for the famine was
[2:37:41] how very sore so the land of who Egypt
[2:37:46] and all the land of what Canaan did what
[2:37:49] fainted by reason of what the famine so
[2:37:51] the despite the food that was there the
[2:37:54] people can't take it no
[2:37:56] more but there is still corn with our
[2:37:59] numbers second mission of
[2:38:02] hunger father help
[2:38:04] me Lord help me let's go to verse 14 and
[2:38:08] what happened and Joseph gathered up all
[2:38:10] the money that was found in the land of
[2:38:13] Egypt continue and what and in the land
[2:38:15] of Canaan for the what corn which which
[2:38:18] they brought and Joseph bought what the
[2:38:21] money into Pharaoh's
[2:38:24] house are we together now so when Joseph
[2:38:28] was selling the corn he was actually
[2:38:31] taking money away from every Egyptian

[2:38:39] egyptian had
[2:38:42] money father please help me and nobody
[2:38:46] in the land of Canaan had money so every
[2:38:50] money now is back into one account the

[2:58:33] uh 20 uh 20 and Joseph bought all the
[2:58:35] land of Egypt for who Pharaoh for the
[2:58:37] Egyptian sold what every man his field
[2:58:41] because the famine did what prevailed
[2:58:43] over them so the land became who Pharaoh
[2:58:46] remember the land is not
[2:58:48] Joseph it is pharaoh and as for the
[2:58:52] people he removed them uh to cities from
[2:58:56] one end of the body of Egypt even to the
[2:58:59] what other end thereof only the land of
[2:59:02] the what priest by brought he not I
[2:59:04] can't get to this teaching right here
[2:59:06] let me leave it alone if you notice they
[2:59:09] bought everybody not the
[2:59:11] priest because let me read and he say
[2:59:15] only the land of the what priest brought
[2:59:17] he what for the priest had a portion
[2:59:20] assigned to them by who of pharaoh
[2:59:22] because the land of the priest belong to
[2:59:24] Pharaoh so you cannot buy the Pharaoh
[2:59:26] Pharaoh's
[2:59:28] hand in other word the priest has an
[2:59:31] exemption that's why the priest could
[2:59:34] break the
[2:59:37] Sabbath that's why the priest could
[2:59:39] break the Sabbath and they are not found
[2:59:41] guilty because they're working for
[2:59:44] Jehovah they can work even in the
[2:59:46] Sabbath day but if you work on the
[2:59:48] Sabbath day it's
[2:59:50] sin spoken word spoken word amen let's
[2:59:54] go quickly and did eat the portion which
[2:59:56] Pharaoh gave them wherefore they sold
[2:59:58] not their what land because they already
[3:00:00] belong to who Pharaoh then F Joseph said
[3:00:03] to the people behold I have bought you
[3:00:06] this day and your land for who Pharaoh
[3:00:10] Lo here is seed for you and you shall SW
[3:00:14] what the land in other word hunger
[3:00:18] famine is used to bring a complete
[3:00:22] surrendering of the entire land of Egypt
[3:00:26] to the supremacy and the preeminence of
[3:00:31] pharaoh the corn and the bread and the
[3:00:35] seed of Joseph is
[3:00:37] powerful the seed of Joseph can produce
[3:00:42] a house the seed of of Joseph can
[3:00:45] produce people the seed of Joseph can
[3:00:48] produce cattle the seed of Joseph can
[3:00:52] produce money that's why when the third
[3:00:55] pool anointing came brother Bram begin
[3:00:59] to give at right option option of money
[3:01:03] option of healing option of this option
[3:01:07] of this because the third pole which is
[3:01:09] the message of can bring money it can
[3:01:13] bring
[3:01:14] it can bring it can bring anything amen
[3:01:18] because the third pool is the message it

[3:01:42] stand
[3:01:47] teach us to pray the mystery of
[3:01:52] Redemptive
[3:01:54] hunger Why seven years of
[3:01:58] soreness Why seven Grievous
[3:02:01] years it is what God
[3:02:04] used it is what God used by sending a
[3:02:07] man into Egypt a prophet into Egypt with
[3:02:12] a Ministry that would take the entire
[3:02:14] land and bring it back to pharaoh and
[3:02:17] that Ministry if you an Egyptian if you
[3:02:21] are part of the Kingdom that ministry
[3:02:23] will break you down until everything
[3:02:27] that you are will be
[3:02:30] pharoh in other word you are
[3:02:34] Pharaoh the land of the Corn of Joseph
[3:02:39] remove the distinction that's right
[3:02:42] between pharaoh
[3:02:44] and
[3:02:46] Egypt at the beginning when you go to
[3:02:49] the land of Egypt you can say these are
[3:02:51] the people of Egypt this is the king of
[3:02:55] Egypt but after the bread of Joseph was
[3:02:58] given you can no longer say this is the
[3:03:01] people of Egypt all you see is
[3:03:04] Pharaoh because the people are pharaohs
[3:03:08] the money are Pharaoh the car are
[3:03:11] Pharaoh the house are Pharaoh the effect
[3:03:15] of this ministry when people see you
[3:03:17] they see Christ amen there is no more
[3:03:20] distinction between you and the Christ
[3:03:23] that's why the Brad is called M Jesus
[3:03:26] Christ

[3:03:38] Father Lord we approaching you
[3:03:42] humbly father Who Am
[3:03:45] I who are
[3:03:47] we to sit
[3:03:51] down and to hear things that we
[3:03:56] hearing it has nothing to do with
[3:04:00] me all is because of your
[3:04:07] grace how we
[3:04:10] misunderstood many things in our life
[3:04:13] and and we thought that you don't love
[3:04:16] us we
[3:04:18] thought that we have done something
[3:04:21] wrong but we did not understand that
[3:04:25] everything that you do in our
[3:04:27] life you did it for a
[3:04:30] purpose you sent the trial for a
[3:04:34] purpose father May whoever is going
[3:04:38] through a trial wake
[3:04:40] up and read the letter language of the
[3:04:45] trial to see if it's really a trial or
[3:04:49] it's really something that have a
[3:04:51] meaning that God is
[3:04:54] using to bring me more to him because
[3:04:58] there are aspect of my
[3:05:00] life that I have not surrendered yet
[3:05:04] there is too much
[3:05:06] me
[3:05:08] controlling my
[3:05:10] life there is too many doors
[3:05:14] that I have not open to the word to the
[3:05:18] ministry of
[3:05:20] Joseph but father
[3:05:22] now you
[3:05:24] spoke and I
[3:05:27] understand I begin to understand your
[3:05:29] language now I begin to see the purpose
[3:05:32] of the hunger that it's
[3:05:35] not to make us
[3:05:38] suffer but it's a hunger so that the
[3:05:42] word can have more effect in our life
[3:05:47] that the word can soak every aspect of
[3:05:51] our life that once we become servant of
[3:05:56] pharaoh we will no longer ask Pharaoh
[3:05:59] for bread because it's going to be
[3:06:02] Pharaoh
[3:06:03] responsibility to take care of his
[3:06:06] servant and to make sure that his
[3:06:08] servant are
[3:06:10] fed and his servant are paid and his
[3:06:14] servant are rewarded in other word
[3:06:17] everything that we bringing to you you
[3:06:20] just take it back and send it back again
[3:06:23] in our
[3:06:24] lap all you want us to understand is the
[3:06:28] source of the
[3:06:30] ownership that we don't have
[3:06:33] anything all that we are all that we
[3:06:37] have all that we have ever
[3:06:41] accomplished belongs to you
[3:06:44] father may you take this
[3:06:47] sermon may you give people the ability
[3:06:50] to go back and to sit down
[3:06:53] home not to listen to me but to listen
[3:06:58] to the message that you have given me to
[3:07:01] deliver so that they can try to glean a
[3:07:05] little bit more than what they got here
[3:07:10] sitting because I know what I got I know
[3:07:13] what you gave
[3:07:14] me you want to take them into a deeper
[3:07:18] depth than they can imagine so that they
[3:07:21] can see the Supernatural on daily
[3:07:25] basis father we thank you and commit
[3:07:28] everything unto the
[3:07:30] hand forgive me for going over time all
[3:07:34] I was trying to do father is to reach a
[3:07:36] point where I can let them into a
[3:07:40] certain level where they don't question
[3:07:42] many things yes but they can go home and
[3:07:45] from there they can
[3:07:47] meditate and catch what you're trying to
[3:07:50] tell them Lord bless them for this
[3:07:53] sacrifice let them focus on the word and
[3:07:58] not on
[3:08:00] pus and if that Terry come again and
[3:08:04] speak to us strengthen us father in
[3:08:08] Jesus precious
