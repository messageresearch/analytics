[7:49] praise the Lord I'd like to read just a
[7:51] portion of proverbs 31 this morning in
[7:54] honor of the mothers and
[7:56] have a little home I'd like to bring you
[7:58] as well so let's read this real quick to
[8:01] proverbs 31 who can find a virtuous
[8:03] woman
[8:04] for her price is far above rubies
[8:08] and so even today it just seems more
[8:10] relevant to me to me seems more
[8:13] we need to hope we'll do this the heart
[8:16] of our husband does safely trust in her
[8:18] so that he shall have no need of support
[8:22] she will do them good and not equal all
[8:24] the days in her life she's seeking all
[8:27] of it blacks and working willingly with
[8:29] her hands she is like the merchant ships
[8:32] she bringeth her food from afar she
[8:36] Rises also while it is yet night and
[8:38] giveth me to her household and of course
[8:40] into her maidens she considered the
[8:43] field and buying it with the fruit of
[8:45] her hand she planted the fingers she
[8:48] girded her loins with strength and
[8:50] strengthening her arms she perceiveth
[8:53] that her merchandise is good her candles
[8:55] goeth not out by night she lay up her
[8:59] hands to the spindle and her hands hold
[9:01] the distance
[9:02] she stretched without her hand to the
[9:04] poor yay she reached forth her hands to
[9:07] the meeting she is not afraid to smell
[9:10] it for her household for all of her
[9:11] household are clothed with scarves
[9:14] she maketh herself coverings of
[9:16] tapestries her clothing is silk and
[9:18] purple her husband is known in the gates
[9:21] when he sitteth among the Elders of the
[9:24] land she magnify linen and celibate and
[9:27] delivereth girls into the merchant
[9:29] strength and honor of her clothing and
[9:31] she shall rejoice in time to come she
[9:35] opened her mouth with wisdom and in her
[9:37] tongue is the law of kindness she looked
[9:40] well to the ways of her household and he
[9:43] is not the bread of idleness her
[9:45] children arise up and call her blessed
[9:48] her husband also and he Praises her many
[9:51] daughters have done virtuously without
[9:53] his sellers than all favor is deceitful
[9:57] and beauty is vain but a woman that
[9:59] fears the Lord she shall be praised
[10:02] give her the fruit of her hands and let
[10:06] her own words praise her in the gates
[10:09] amen I found that little Point here
[10:12] yesterday I'm thinking about this this
[10:16] is by um it's called God's special
[10:18] creation by Lenora mcporter says the
[10:21] hand that drops the Cradle also makes
[10:24] the house a home it is the prayers of
[10:27] the mother that keeps keeps the family
[10:29] strong
[10:30] another Rises early in the morning and
[10:33] bathes her day in prayer she talks to
[10:36] God about her family
[10:38] and places them in his care
[10:41] mother communicates her love in a
[10:43] thousand different ways when there's a
[10:45] need she is there whether it's night or
[10:48] day Mother seasons life with love and
[10:51] gives so much of herself God placed in
[10:54] her the best he had and made her unlike
[10:57] anyone else but challenges come our way
[11:01] and When Trials block our view mother
[11:04] kneels down beside her bed and praise
[11:07] the family through mother is God's
[11:10] special creation she is a light shining
[11:13] in the dark Illuminating the path for
[11:15] her family and pointing them toward god

[20:19] uh nobody text me the appraise reports
[20:22] this morning
[20:23] so I do have a few um
[20:26] prayer requests I'm going to ask brother
[20:28] Greg if he would be understanding not to
[20:29] come up and pray with these
[20:32] um obviously last week we had a prayer
[20:35] request for sister Melanie Wallace and
[20:39] she texted me I think it was late
[20:41] yesterday evening that she's still not
[20:43] feeling well in her body so brother
[20:46] Brian up you know he uh text me a lot
[20:48] and I said I won't have to stay home and
[20:50] take care of my wife
[20:52] so let's remember her again
[20:56] um
[20:57] somebody else texted me and I don't have
[20:59] everybody's phone number so I'm not sure
[21:00] who it was but they were um first of all
[21:03] they were saying how much if they're if
[21:06] their mother-in-law was enjoying the
[21:07] services on the on the uh YouTube so um
[21:11] that's great I mean that's what you know
[21:14] we didn't think we would get out like
[21:15] that we wouldn't do it so you know so
[21:18] I'm glad it's reaching people and that
[21:20] you know it's encouraging they're very
[21:22] good Services it's a very good preaching
[21:24] we haven't heard this in a long time and
[21:27] uh and we really need it
[21:29] um so they request at the same time was
[21:31] to remember the saints that spoke with
[21:34] more tarantic we haven't seen each other
[21:37] for a while now while we were waiting
[21:39] for president Thomas Lewis he mentioned
[21:41] something about May 17th about them
[21:43] possibly being able to gather again so
[21:45] maybe we'll check into it and see it and
[21:48] he did encourage you know he said we're
[21:50] still going to be extremely if you're
[21:51] not comfortable don't come stay at home
[21:54] you know so we'll I don't know what our
[21:56] plan is
[22:00] so let's let's um pray about that I
[22:03] think that's what two weeks one week two
[22:05] weeks one week I'm ready I'm ready
[22:10] we need our fellowships
[22:13] we draw strength from each other
[22:16] so let's remember that and then I did
[22:20] see some pictures of brother Jewel
[22:22] long enough
[22:23] online and he's doing very well
[22:27] he was going to a doctor's appointment
[22:29] they were riding in the car but he's
[22:31] also he's standing outside waiting and
[22:33] he took a bunch of family photos with uh
[22:36] Sabrina you know and sister Tasha and
[22:38] the grandkids and everything so
[22:40] they say he's still got a little ways to
[22:43] go so let's keep praying for him and he
[22:45] they said they used to work boots
[22:47] Advantage he needs a boost of energy so
[22:50] obviously he's he's still weak in his
[22:52] body so let's ask for some God is trying
[22:54] to do his body because the kingdom needs
[22:57] him still right he's still here and
[22:59] there's a reason for that
[23:00] and then lastly we did receive the text
[23:03] concerning brother Laurel Henry and
[23:06] sister Cheryl Hansen's dad remember the
[23:09] team used to call him Big Brother you
[23:13] know he lost his wife several years ago
[23:15] and his health hasn't been the greatest
[23:17] in them apparently this week it's been
[23:19] declining even more so they ask us to
[23:22] remember him his name is Lowell Henry
[23:25] please you know he's a wonderful brother
[23:27] he believed the message
[23:29] so let's stop let's just keep getting
[23:32] prayer this week and it's as well the
[23:34] family those are big families
[23:36] you know Sister Cheryl has a twin sister
[23:39] that we're having to take care of and

[30:23] amen amen amen
[30:28] can you hear me
[30:30] praise God is it working system
[30:33] okay
[30:35] let's go straight to the scripture we
[30:38] thank God for another opportunity to
[30:40] gather together here the devil has been
[30:44] fighting this message and right and left
[30:47] but we believe by the grace of God that
[30:50] something will be done here
[30:55] it's going to be the Book of Luke we're
[30:57] still working on it is it working says
[31:00] if not you might have to restart it
[31:08] Luke chapter 18.
[31:11] verse 8. we read this last time
[31:16] and probably we're going to read one
[31:18] thing and then lead to the city
[31:25] if your computer can get worried I can
[31:27] give you a USB that you can post from
[31:34] Luke chapter 18 verse 8.
[31:40] if you dare you can say Amen
[31:52] the bible say that I will I tell you
[31:55] that he will avenge them speedly talking
[31:58] about elect if you look at verse seven
[32:00] it's speaking about the elect
[32:03] nevertheless when the son of man comes
[32:06] we explained this last week that it is
[32:09] the second coming of the Lord Jesus
[32:11] Christ already came he is preaching and
[32:14] he is also prophesying about his second
[32:17] gun he said when the son of man come
[32:19] shall he find faith on Earth the concern
[32:24] is at the second coming of the Lord
[32:26] Jesus is worrying whether he's going to
[32:29] find faith on Earth so the problem is
[32:32] Faith on earth and the coming of the
[32:35] Lord let's go to Second Thessalonians
[32:37] chapter 2.
[32:41] thank you
[32:42] the last time we saw her Jude also spoke
[32:45] about that faith and Jude say that he
[32:48] was
[32:50] urging
[32:51] the believer to contend for that faith
[32:54] that was once delivered to the Saints
[32:56] right which was showing that that Faith
[32:58] later on he's gonna get in trouble
[33:02] second Thessalonians
[33:06] chapter two if you dare you can say amen
[33:09] amen
[33:13] thank you
[33:14] good yes now we beseech you Brethren by
[33:19] the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[33:22] again it's speaking about the second
[33:24] coming of the lord we find Jesus Christ
[33:26] prophesying about the second coming
[33:28] we're in Nevada faith and now Paul is
[33:31] also prophesying about the second coming
[33:34] of the Lord but Paul is also going to
[33:37] tell us something here he said now we
[33:40] beseech you Brethren by the coming of
[33:42] the Lord Jesus Christ and by our
[33:45] gathering together to him it is a
[33:49] gathering into someone we might probably
[33:52] preach on that later on and see where is
[33:54] that gallery and by our gathering
[33:57] together to him that you be not soon
[34:00] shaken in mind
[34:02] or be troubled why because something is
[34:06] going to come up to shake you something
[34:09] is going to come up to trouble you he
[34:12] said neither by Spirit nor by word
[34:16] nor by letter as promise as that the day
[34:21] of Christ is a hand
[34:24] let no man deceive you by any means
[34:28] for that day now it's Paul who's
[34:31] prophesying about the future he said now
[34:34] that day
[34:38] shall not come except they come in
[34:43] Falling Away first you might be seated
[34:45] as we continue so first of all Jesus is
[34:49] prophesying about his second coming
[34:52] and as he's prophesying about his second
[34:54] coming he is worrying about whether he's
[34:57] going to find Faith are we going to find
[35:00] faith on earth when he comes it's
[35:02] already telling us that something is
[35:04] going to happen to that Faith then we
[35:06] found you the last time he told us about
[35:09] contending for that faith if you want to
[35:12] fight you want to contend for that Faith
[35:14] it's also talking to us that you are
[35:17] something is going to be attacking that
[35:19] Faith it's going to be slide uh 34 by
[35:22] David
[35:23] slide 34 if you can get it yeah now John
[35:27] Paul is now prophesied he said let no
[35:29] man deceive you for that day shall not
[35:32] come except they come a falling away
[35:35] first and falling away from what so
[35:39] something must be established first in
[35:41] the church but Paul is saying that down
[35:43] the road they're gonna come and falling
[35:46] away so something is Gonna Come that's
[35:49] gonna shake the church away from the
[35:52] word of God there will be people living
[35:55] the faith going into somewhere so that's
[35:58] why we're trying to see why do we need
[36:01] an Elijah why do we need a restoration
[36:04] Ministry why do we need a Malachi for
[36:07] Ministry if you need that Malachi for
[36:10] the restoration Ministry something need
[36:13] to be probably first moved away once
[36:16] it's moved away then we can restore it
[36:18] yes my brother
[36:20] that's 34. yeah it's supposed to be
[36:25] praise God okay The Devil Is Alive
[36:30] now that I've got it he started by
[36:33] getting brother Brian and his wife
[36:40] then we move on with the computer so
[36:43] something is going to be saying this
[36:44] morning he said that Falling Away first
[36:47] and that man of sin be revealed the Son
[36:52] of Perdition so somebody there is a man
[36:56] of sin that's gonna get into the church
[36:58] and that man is going to attack faith
[37:01] and he will deviate Faith then later on
[37:04] we needed somebody to restore that Faith
[37:08] back we will see that man of sin because
[37:10] getting into the man of sin is preaching
[37:13] the seals now let's go to our last
[37:15] scripture which is first Timothy verse
[37:18] 4.
[37:20] chapter 4 verse 1 and 2 then we go from
[37:23] there
[37:25] First Timothy
[37:28] chapter four
[37:31] verse 1 and 2.
[37:34] please keep your Bible because we are
[37:36] not in the Zodiac we are not in the
[37:38] pyramid we are now in the written word
[37:40] amen so you need to have your Bible
[37:43] I need to vaccinate here pretty good
[37:47] and make sure we are really really
[37:49] really vaccinated yes
[37:51] yes so when somebody comes you don't
[37:53] talk much you say take your bubble and
[37:57] disprove me Malachi foreign
[38:14] town now Paul again is prophesying that
[38:19] in the latter time Jude spoke about the
[38:22] problem we Faith Jesus spoke about the
[38:24] same thing Paul said there will come and
[38:27] falling away first before Jesus Christ
[38:30] come before the second coming of the
[38:32] Lord there will be a falling away that's
[38:35] what Paul is talking to us here now in
[38:38] this episode here Paul is giving us more
[38:41] more more warning about it he said in
[38:45] the last time in the latter days
[38:47] in the anthem
[38:49] okay in the exam some shall depart from
[38:54] Jesus
[38:56] so now we understand why we need a
[38:59] larger somebody will leave faith someone
[39:02] will depart from the faith giving him to
[39:06] seducing spirit and doctrines of devil
[39:10] speaking lies in her prophecy I can dig
[39:14] into this pretty deep once someone
[39:17] leaves the word of God this is the
[39:19] spirit that is picking up this he says
[39:22] speaking lies in hypocrisy having their
[39:25] conscious sealed with their hearts iron
[39:28] in other words their heart their soul
[39:31] doesn't have any moral condemnation they
[39:34] can do something wrong and they're still
[39:36] good
[39:37] they are called Blind killers they can
[39:41] kill without a remorse
[39:44] someone will leave the faith
[39:47] there won't be a following way should I
[39:50] find faith we must contend for the faith

[41:27] Jesus gracious name amen God bless you
[41:30] you've already been seen now we started
[41:34] this series and we are on part six of
[41:38] Malachi for the unchanging pardon of God
[41:41] when we say God doesn't change meaning
[41:44] if God does something if you look
[41:47] clearly of what God did the first time
[41:50] you can follow God through and you will
[41:53] see that he's still the same yesterday
[41:55] today and forever because we are talking
[41:58] about Malachi 4 we are talking about the
[42:00] spirit of Alaska so before we even get
[42:03] into Malachi for before you even get
[42:07] into the ministry of our time today you
[42:10] need to make sure you go back first and
[42:12] see what did God do with the man Elijah
[42:16] once you understand the working of the
[42:19] spirit of God into Elijah over there
[42:21] then we can come back in our town and
[42:24] see exactly compare trust or watch
[42:28] Christ through his characteristic and
[42:30] making sure that he is still the same
[42:33] yesterday today and forever if he's
[42:36] still not the same then there is no way
[42:38] we can follow him when we started last
[42:41] week we found out that we spoke about
[42:44] Moses because Jesus passed when he was
[42:47] going with the disciple on the road of
[42:49] his mind when he began to talk to them
[42:51] he spoke he started from Moses and we
[42:55] found that Moses was a very critical
[42:58] point because Moses was the one that
[43:01] brought the law the Bible said that the
[43:04] law came by Moses but Grace and Truth
[43:07] came from Jesus Christ that is in the
[43:10] Book of John chapter 1 verse 17 if Allah
[43:14] so we found that Moses first established
[43:18] Israel or distinguished Israel
[43:21] separately from any other nation in
[43:25] other words when you look at the Jews
[43:27] the lifestyle the way they behave the
[43:30] way they dress the way they are living
[43:32] the way they operate it looks different
[43:35] than any other tribe or any other Nation
[43:39] on the earth and the reason why it
[43:41] happened because God sent the Prophet by
[43:45] the name of Moses and Moses established
[43:48] the dispossession of the Lord but we
[43:51] found out that before Moses died that
[43:54] Moses prophesy about Jesus Christ he
[43:58] prophesied about the first coming of
[44:00] Jesus Christ in Deuteronomy 18 verse 18.
[44:05] Jesus says that the Lord God will send a
[44:10] prophet light unto me so Moses was
[44:14] already prophesying about the coming
[44:16] Messiah then we found out that not only
[44:20] did Moses prophesy about the oncoming
[44:24] Messiah but Moses also prophesied about
[44:27] the falling away of Israel
[44:30] last Sunday we found out that he called
[44:33] the elders the elders the elders the
[44:37] Elders of the tribe and he spoke to them
[44:40] and he said I know that when I'm gonna
[44:42] die when I'm gonna be the party I know
[44:45] that you Israel will depart completely
[44:48] from the faith then we found out that
[44:51] when Moses died Israel entered into the
[44:54] Promised Land once Israel entered into
[44:57] the promised land something happened
[44:59] they went through the judges they went
[45:02] to the Kings until they reached the time
[45:04] of King
[45:06] and on the time of King Ahab brother
[45:08] Branham said that was the darkest age of
[45:12] Israel in other words it was the time
[45:14] when Israel which drifted completely
[45:18] away from God because they have a king
[45:21] and that King was Ahab and the Bible
[45:23] said he was the worst king of all of
[45:26] them so since Israel departed completely
[45:30] from God departed completely from the
[45:33] law of Moses departed completely from
[45:36] the original Foundation that was placed
[45:39] by Moses God sent a special Ministry by
[45:44] the name of Elijah so when Elijah came
[45:47] in we found last week that there was
[45:50] four things that happened to Elijah
[45:52] number one Elijah found in Israel into a
[45:57] state that they were hunting
[46:00] between two opinion
[46:06] and we found out that that state is a
[46:09] very bad State because there are men
[46:11] that is a double-minded man is unstable
[46:15] in all his ways so Isabel worked so hard
[46:20] into Israel until she reached a point
[46:24] where she put Israel between two
[46:27] opinions right yes and between two
[46:30] opinions brother says this
[46:33] in the message come and see
[46:36] Val Branham was talking to someone on a
[46:38] prayer line he said how do you do you
[46:41] believe before your heart you do you're
[46:44] in trouble
[46:45] you are not sick only you are nervous
[46:50] I'm going Elementary
[46:52] everybody there
[46:54] you are upset
[46:57] this person is nervous
[46:59] this person is upset why is he upset we
[47:04] are coming to the great physician not
[47:06] that brother brother means the great
[47:08] physician but the one that brought the
[47:10] brother was waiting for he's the great
[47:13] physician he was the one that was able
[47:16] to detect the disease that's why brother
[47:19] Branham saying I'm talking to you I'm
[47:21] just waiting for him what's he coming
[47:23] very brother said I take every Spirit
[47:26] here and the control he said you are not
[47:29] sick
[47:30] only you are nervous you are upset
[47:34] it's a mental distress like
[47:38] random continue because
[47:41] you are hunting between two opinions
[47:46] what you must do in life
[47:49] you are not yours is not a sickness
[47:54] so hunting between two opinion can cause
[47:59] you a mental distress
[48:01] hurting between two opinion can put you
[48:05] in the state of nervousness
[48:07] and brother Branham continue in
[48:10] spiritual and measure he said
[48:14] another thing that another thing that
[48:17] cause it among the people
[48:19] that was his Amnesia he said he's
[48:22] getting between two opinions
[48:25] that shall cause amnesia and it gets you
[48:29] to a place where you actually what you
[48:33] have done you have lost your reasons
[48:37] so Israel between two opinions put them
[48:41] into a mental state of nervousness and
[48:45] not only that Israel lost the reason
[48:48] you have lost your mind
[48:51] you can make you don't know who you are
[48:54] that's why your message have come to
[48:56] come to identify Who You Are
[49:00] you can identify yourself you can walk
[49:03] around eat and everything but you still
[49:07] can't identify yourself
[49:10] that is what the lukewarm condition does
[49:14] you can still be living you can still be
[49:17] talking you can still be going to work
[49:19] and doing everything but still
[49:22] you lost your man you are acting a
[49:25] different way you are unstable in
[49:27] everything that you did so when Elijah
[49:31] met them there is something that Elijah
[49:34] talked to them that last week I didn't
[49:36] even talked about it but the Lord spoke
[49:39] to me that last night so I have to show
[49:42] it to you let's go to the book of first
[49:45] king chapter 18 Again
[49:49] he showed to me so there is no way I can
[49:53] let it go
[49:54] he came last evening
[49:57] that's nice
[50:06] first king chapter 18 if you dare you
[50:08] can say Amen
[50:16] verse 30
[50:18] and Elijah said to all the people
[50:22] what did he say come
[50:25] near to me
[50:29] that was what the Lord quickened to me
[50:31] last time last night come near to me
[50:35] Amen in other words Israel
[50:38] was not near to Elijah
[50:42] I'm going slowly Israel was away from
[50:47] the prophet
[50:48] but before the restoration start God
[50:53] told Israel you come first
[50:56] closer to the prophet
[50:59] you need to leave the other camp
[51:01] yes sir you need to live the other place
[51:04] you need to move away from where you are
[51:07] and come on this side you cannot be
[51:11] understandable and follow the prophet
[51:14] he said come first near to me amen come
[51:18] first in this camp
[51:21] why is it important to come first to
[51:24] Elijah you just keep your finger running
[51:26] as I'm going through what the Lord
[51:28] shared with me last night let's take the
[51:31] Book of Ruth
[51:33] comes after the judges
[51:40] and you can look in the car and bring
[51:42] the water
[51:47] the keys are in my bed
[51:54] if you dare you can say
[51:57] amen The Book of Ruth
[52:04] chapter two
[52:18] Let Me Now go to the field
[52:21] and bring ear of corn after him in whose
[52:26] sight I shall find what
[52:29] I shall find Grace
[52:32] okay it's a message of Grace and she
[52:35] said to her go my daughter
[52:38] and she went
[52:40] and came and dreamed in the field after
[52:43] the Reapers
[52:45] and her heart was in other words it
[52:48] happened
[52:50] everybody there
[52:52] he happened to light on a part of the
[52:56] field
[52:57] belonging to God
[53:00] who was the Kindred to a million
[53:04] eliminate
[53:05] in other words
[53:07] Naomi God would go
[53:09] and Google there were many things over
[53:13] there we didn't know which one but we
[53:15] know that the footsteps of the righteous
[53:18] are order of the Lord so why the rule to
[53:21] begin to go somehow the Lord took the
[53:25] footsteps of wood and directed her to
[53:28] powers
[53:30] and it happened that Boaz was a king
[53:34] blood
[53:35] took Emily Malik who was the
[53:38] father-in-law true
[53:40] this didn't happen by any chance
[53:44] observative
[53:48] verse 10 then said boys to his servant
[53:52] that was sent over the Reapers so boys
[53:56] have the reverse but there was one
[53:59] servant that was above the rivers he was
[54:04] the messenger
[54:06] and then on the dumb messenger there
[54:09] were other preachers
[54:10] I'm going slowly amen
[54:13] this servant that was set over the
[54:15] Reapers whose themsel is this
[54:18] and they explained to her then verse 8
[54:22] then send boss to root hear you not my
[54:26] daughter
[54:27] God not green in another field
[54:30] [Music]
[54:31] are you there it is very important for
[54:36] you to stand in the field of boys
[54:44] can give you food
[54:48] because the law says when you are
[54:51] Weeping make sure when something falls
[54:54] down don't pick it up because there is
[54:59] people there that are poor they need to
[55:01] come and clean that so the law the
[55:05] scripture provided already for the poor
[55:09] for the lady for the people that are in
[55:12] distress so any field in Israel can
[55:16] provide food anything in Israel can give
[55:20] you something to sustain you but not
[55:22] every field can provide Redemption
[55:33] and remain a more abide and remain a
[55:39] stranger and remain single yes
[55:42] but they only feel that could not only
[55:46] sustain good and give her food but also
[55:51] change the statue transform the status
[55:56] of Ruth was the field of doors
[56:01] because the field of powers is a film
[56:05] that is connected with bloodline where
[56:09] are you
[56:09] are you there that's why Ballers look at
[56:13] Harry and boys say I know you don't know
[56:17] the mystery
[56:18] I am dead King's Men Redeemer you don't
[56:23] understand me better
[56:25] but let me just give you an advice
[56:28] when you need food steady
[56:32] don't go off with it if you go to the
[56:36] Methodist they can give you something if
[56:40] you go to the Baptist they can provide
[56:43] you with your necessary need
[56:45] God for you to have Redemption you
[56:50] cannot get Redemption any kind of way
[56:53] up that's why you see people in
[56:57] denomination
[56:59] they are praying God is blessing them
[57:02] they give their dad God is blessing them
[57:06] because that is based on the scriptures
[57:10] they can break bread they get a
[57:12] promotion they pray pray and you meet
[57:15] them they can give you testimony God did
[57:17] this to me God did this to me God healed
[57:20] my baby God did this to me that's good
[57:23] but reduction you must be honestly
[57:29] the devil is fighting my voice
[57:33] man are you there
[57:35] first
[57:37] he said then he said for us to move
[57:40] bring you not my daughter
[57:42] go not to Green in another field
[57:45] neither God from here but a bad here
[57:49] fast by what by my bed
[57:52] stand with the other women
[57:55] stay close to the enemy women
[57:58] stay close to the churches that are in
[58:03] the field of powers
[58:06] because the woman in the Bible speaks of
[58:09] a church
[58:13] let's continue verse 9 let your eyes be
[58:18] on the field that they do with them
[58:22] and God you are today
[58:24] have I not charged the young man that it
[58:28] should not touch you
[58:29] so there is a restriction for preachers
[58:36] I'm gonna go there
[58:38] and when you are thirsty
[58:41] go to the vessels and drink of that
[58:45] which the young man has jumped not
[58:48] preacher can stop you from going to
[58:51] drink
[58:53] amen what roof this came last night
[58:57] what truth I'm just inserting it what
[59:01] truth on verse 30.
[59:05] then she said everybody there let me
[59:09] find favor in your sight
[59:13] my lord for that you have comforted me
[59:17] and for that you have spoken friendly to
[59:21] your what
[59:23] she put herself in the position of
[59:27] enhancement

[1:00:06] like your handmade watch this door
[1:00:10] everybody there I'll be not like yes
[1:00:14] yes to one of your hand measures
[1:00:19] she put herself up
[1:00:22] and then she retract back again
[1:00:26] foreign
[1:00:30] [Music]
[1:00:34] let me unfold another revelation
[1:00:38] are you there watch verse 14. and boy

[1:01:55] and deep your monster in the vinegar
[1:01:59] and she sat beside who

[1:02:07] running after the Reapers when the river
[1:02:10] through all the food she picks it up

[1:02:59] message

[1:09:09] connection to me but what truth there
[1:09:13] are founded help a revelation but she's
[1:09:16] still caught up

[1:09:25] and wrote the more about the same he

[1:09:32] young men until they have ended the
[1:09:35] Harvest they are giving her the key to
[1:09:39] the Revelation but she is long caught up
[1:09:42] into the gift yes sir right yes
[1:09:46] she looks more on the gift of the spirit
[1:09:51] but it's not always telling her that God
[1:09:54] Giver of the gift of the spirit is
[1:09:58] connected to you
[1:10:00] right but she's now caught up oh I'm
[1:10:04] speaking in God oh I met the angel of
[1:10:07] the Lord I saw this before but the Lord
[1:10:10] has blessed me Naomi said listen to me

[1:10:32] 21 on verse 22 and I always said to roof
[1:10:36] head though they love it is good my love
[1:10:38] that you go out with them
[1:10:41] in other words Naomi left that subject
[1:10:44] it's not ready for that year she doesn't
[1:10:47] understand it yet she's still caught up
[1:10:50] into churches in a message she still
[1:10:52] caught up about the preacher she's still
[1:10:55] talking about the young man and the
[1:10:57] Mendes now he taught me to be with the
[1:11:00] mothers he taught me to be with the
[1:11:03] young man he taught me to be with the
[1:11:05] preacher and that creature so and so I
[1:11:07] like this one over there according to
[1:11:09] this message church I'm going to this
[1:11:11] message saying Naomi said no problem
[1:11:13] saying the message
[1:11:15] stay in the churches of the message
[1:11:17] Continue to follow preachers and later
[1:11:20] on I will afford you something
[1:11:22] everyone there
[1:11:24] amen
[1:11:25] he says he is my daughter that you go
[1:11:28] out with his mothers stay with the
[1:11:31] churches over there that they make you
[1:11:34] not in the united field don't go to the
[1:11:36] Baptist don't go to the Methodist stand
[1:11:39] there
[1:11:40] and so she came first by what they made
[1:11:45] it of whom boys
[1:11:56] so she goes to church she come back she
[1:12:00] goes to church she comes back she goes
[1:12:03] to church she comes back she goes to
[1:12:05] church she comes back she is still
[1:12:08] standing with God to judge then I only
[1:12:11] stop and say hey enough
[1:12:15] you will play church too much
[1:12:17] you have been after a preacher too much
[1:12:21] this is the second stage of your life
[1:12:24] this is the second stage of spoken words
[1:12:27] available you grew up in the message
[1:12:29] you've been in the message for 10 years
[1:12:32] for 20 years but there is a different
[1:12:35] world a higher call
[1:12:38] because staying with the hell man
[1:12:42] staying with demands will continue to
[1:12:46] leave you in your state
[1:12:49] are you there every time you come you
[1:12:52] imagine every time you come you imagine
[1:12:56] yes are you there but this field is not
[1:13:00] like any other field this field has a
[1:13:04] revelation higher than another field
[1:13:07] that One Direction is the name of the
[1:13:10] day is not just the one to give you the
[1:13:12] gift but that man can give you something
[1:13:15] else let's go to verse chapter 33.
[1:13:20] thank you
[1:13:21] they know
[1:13:23] her mother-in-law said to her my
[1:13:26] daughter shall I not seek restful
[1:13:30] I thought everything was good she goes
[1:13:33] they give her favor they give her bodies
[1:13:36] they give her stimulus check they give
[1:13:38] her all kinds of stuff she's so happy
[1:13:40] prince I'll do why do you worry about it
[1:13:43] but Naomi was not arrested
[1:13:51] of the Lord but I'm still not good
[1:14:00] that I may be well with you that he may
[1:14:04] be well with you and now is not what
[1:14:08] does
[1:14:09] of our
[1:14:11] history
[1:14:13] to the resurrection like the first time
[1:14:17] I told you
[1:14:18] you will not miss me but since you grow
[1:14:21] up here with me you got used to the
[1:14:24] custom of God you know where Paul was
[1:14:27] taking shower you know where you sleep
[1:14:29] you know how his field is you know the
[1:14:32] name of all his Reapers we pursue
[1:14:34] himself we pursue himself we pursue and
[1:14:37] so Pastor so and so Pastor so and so
[1:14:39] Pastor so and so you know demanded this
[1:14:42] church over there so is
[1:14:47] acquainted to that but come back again
[1:14:50] you remember me telling you that that
[1:14:53] man is a near Kingsman yes sir
[1:14:57] now change yourself
[1:15:00] anoint yourself
[1:15:03] what's your number three wash yourself I
[1:15:06] want you
[1:15:09] change completely
[1:15:12] are you there now you go out to that man
[1:15:16] and watch where he's laying and go there
[1:15:19] and sleep at the feet
[1:15:22] because going to church
[1:15:25] staying with the mothers following the
[1:15:28] preachers is good but it's not going to
[1:15:31] change
[1:15:32] you are a young woman
[1:15:35] you need a husband you need to get into
[1:15:38] a union with boys
[1:15:44] to a wife
[1:15:48] are you there
[1:15:50] is the message that we are now we are
[1:15:54] not here to go after preaching we are
[1:15:57] not here to be just in another message
[1:16:00] it is a term to unite the roof and
[1:16:04] Powers together once Ruth get married to
[1:16:08] boys
[1:16:09] automatically when roof comes back she
[1:16:13] is not amended anymore she is the first
[1:16:15] lady she is the boss lady when she
[1:16:18] helped her she's not breathing after
[1:16:21] preacher anymore it is the preacher
[1:16:23] taking care of her
[1:16:25] [Music]
[1:16:26] amen are you there
[1:16:29] that's why it is important to stay in
[1:16:34] the field of boys number one happy
[1:16:37] between topping number two step closer
[1:16:41] to Elijah because when you stand closer
[1:16:44] to Elijah there is a Redemption
[1:16:46] connected to the ministry of Elijah
[1:16:50] then after that Elijah rebuilt the altar
[1:16:54] we spoke about rebuilding the altar what
[1:16:57] is an altar in the Bible but Barnum says
[1:17:00] that
[1:17:01] we are not come together
[1:17:04] to talk about the message
[1:17:06] we already talked about it
[1:17:08] we're not here to go after the meeting
[1:17:11] to go after the weakness we come
[1:17:14] together to get in the message
[1:17:17] into boys
[1:17:20] and the message is
[1:17:26] the word yes that's right we are to get
[1:17:30] into it get business
[1:17:34] yes sir that's what we are supposed to
[1:17:37] do foreign
[1:17:42] he said they were not just come together
[1:17:46] to talk about the message
[1:17:49] you said in the message
[1:17:51] you begin to glean after the Reapers
[1:17:53] after a while you sit with the maiden
[1:17:55] and you begin to talk you know in that
[1:17:57] church so and so you know so and so you
[1:18:00] know this says so yeah brother spoke
[1:18:02] about this spoke about it we didn't come
[1:18:05] in the message for that
[1:18:10] they want to get into the message
[1:18:13] into it gets under the ground do not
[1:18:16] come say you know Moses told us God of
[1:18:20] random said brother Brian I'm saying the
[1:18:23] messenger he said the prophet said he
[1:18:26] told us that we should have blood what
[1:18:29] do you think about it boys
[1:18:31] that was nothing
[1:18:33] God get the lamb killed amen and get the
[1:18:38] blood out there we can come and sit and
[1:18:42] agree with the word the message and
[1:18:45] everything but don't have that token
[1:18:49] nothing there is nothing that proves to
[1:18:53] have you are the wife of boys
[1:18:55] [Music]
[1:18:59] what God does he do no good get benefit
[1:19:04] he was not responsible for everyone out
[1:19:08] from under the blood
[1:19:11] but the problem said here that can build
[1:19:15] the doctor and not to Israel
[1:19:18] a place of worship down here he said
[1:19:22] here is an altar I got a truth that is
[1:19:25] what a church is a what
[1:19:28] it drives us from a larger Festival has
[1:19:32] to remove you from the state of being
[1:19:35] between two opinion either you are for
[1:19:38] the message or against the person you
[1:19:41] against the message leave you are for
[1:19:43] the message say number two come closer
[1:19:47] to Elijah come in the care of it
[1:19:51] Hallelujah and once you come in the camp
[1:19:53] of Elijah that Elijah beginning to
[1:19:56] rebuild to the author he begins to take
[1:19:58] the stone but when I'm saying he was
[1:20:01] denomination that broke those storms
[1:20:03] denomination came from Jezebel Jezebel
[1:20:07] brought the fellowship and then he takes
[1:20:09] the church and begin to rebuild the
[1:20:13] church back again once Elijah rebuild
[1:20:16] the church the Bible said he set the
[1:20:20] wood
[1:20:21] in order
[1:20:23] what is wood
[1:20:25] what about them said wound in the
[1:20:28] scripture represent Humanity
[1:20:31] which speaks of the church
[1:20:35] the wound
[1:20:37] in order
[1:20:43] the church in order
[1:20:47] that's why if Elijah has to come in this
[1:20:51] Center he must preach Cayton yes
[1:20:56] are you there because Elijah puts the
[1:21:00] wood in order
[1:21:02] are you there so if we want to find the
[1:21:05] right in our town we must find the man
[1:21:08] who preached childhood
[1:21:11] [Music]
[1:21:15] Elijah took the Bullock and put it upon
[1:21:19] the wound and cut the Bullock in one
[1:21:23] pieces
[1:21:26] Spider-Man have said that Bullock
[1:21:29] represented Christ amen and brother said
[1:21:33] the blood of the bullet came under the
[1:21:37] storm showing that the church must be
[1:21:40] protected by the blood
[1:21:44] but the blood was coming from a bleeding
[1:21:48] Bullock a bleeding word a bleeding
[1:21:53] message
[1:21:54] because the message is the one that has
[1:21:58] the blood
[1:22:00] that's why come closer to Elijah Amen in
[1:22:05] the Church of Elijah in the camp of
[1:22:09] Elijah they alter is rebuilt yes the
[1:22:13] church is rebuilt in the camp of Elijah
[1:22:17] there is church order in the camp of
[1:22:20] Elijah there is a blood of providing a
[1:22:24] sacrifice on the object
[1:22:26] and if you notice Brother John
[1:22:30] the Bible said Elijah was the one who
[1:22:33] cut
[1:22:34] do you want to read it or you're good
[1:22:37] he said he knows Elijah who cut the
[1:22:41] sacrifice in business
[1:22:44] what does he mean Paul spoke to Timothy
[1:22:48] he said you must Show Yourself by the
[1:22:51] rabbit a good servant
[1:22:54] rightfully
[1:22:56] dividing
[1:22:58] the word
[1:23:01] are you there in the church the altar
[1:23:05] after there is rude
[1:23:11] there is a sacrifice amen are you there
[1:23:15] but this sacrifice
[1:23:18] must be kept by Elijah
[1:23:23] [Applause]
[1:23:24] are you there you're sacrifice must be
[1:23:28] separated
[1:23:30] rightly divided by Elijah Church
[1:23:40] camp
[1:23:41] we must find the sermon the preaching
[1:23:45] that was preached by Elijah
[1:23:50] you cannot come to this church
[1:23:54] and preach to us any kind of message
[1:23:57] amen are you there you must preach to us
[1:24:00] the sacrifice the millions that was
[1:24:04] passed by Elijah and the message that
[1:24:07] was gradually divided by a letter
[1:24:11] because God's message has blood and
[1:24:15] their blood that's gonna protected the
[1:24:17] altar the church
[1:24:22] amen
[1:24:24] I'm reading that from the Bible are you
[1:24:28] there yes
[1:24:32] I'm just right in the beginning
[1:24:36] when he poured that
[1:24:39] you see what happened what came last
[1:24:41] night well if you want that
[1:24:44] he taught them doing water
[1:24:50] [Music]
[1:24:53] do you want a seed
[1:24:57] let's go to first king chapter 18.
[1:25:04] 16 chapter 18.
[1:25:10] you must stay in the camp
[1:25:13] this is what came to me last night stay
[1:25:15] closer to see by the word by two
[1:25:19] measuring that proportion and he put the
[1:25:22] wound in what
[1:25:23] in order your church order
[1:25:26] foreign
[1:25:33] are you there
[1:25:35] and got the pieces that the Bullock
[1:25:38] increases and then you don't know what
[1:25:40] the word the message that has been
[1:25:43] preached was laid upon Church order the
[1:25:46] church has to come back in order when
[1:25:48] you prophesy there must be somebody uh
[1:25:51] doing this they must be that all they
[1:25:52] have people preach in the church are you
[1:25:55] there and he said
[1:25:58] and said feel what
[1:26:00] sacrifice
[1:26:07] and on the wood
[1:26:09] and he said do it there
[1:26:12] and he gave them and they give him the
[1:26:14] second time and then and he said do it
[1:26:18] there
[1:26:19] and they give you the third time and the
[1:26:21] Lord they did what
[1:26:24] there was four brothers four parents of
[1:26:28] one
[1:26:30] and they did it how many times
[1:26:33] four times three equal
[1:26:36] how many drugs were they
[1:26:38] how many stores Elijah put together
[1:26:41] so he said take four there us and put it
[1:26:46] 12 times there was about three times
[1:26:49] there were three outpouring
[1:26:58] are you there and the world is sunk and
[1:27:03] what they would write the sacrifice
[1:27:06] makes with the blood wet the storm and
[1:27:11] fill all over the trench brother said he
[1:27:15] did that to show that he was genuine
[1:27:20] there was no fire under it
[1:27:23] foreign
[1:27:46] they remove doubt
[1:27:51] they removed that Brother John
[1:27:54] but to remove doubt index doing our
[1:27:59] calling of the water
[1:28:03] when brother Brahman will show you that
[1:28:06] the name of God Ibraham was waiting on
[1:28:09] seven
[1:28:10] Hallelujah do you remember there were
[1:28:14] three pigs
[1:28:58] [Music]
[1:29:21] how can you take one
[1:29:24] and poor because when Moses was going to
[1:29:27] Egypt Moses said they won't believe it
[1:29:29] God said no problem I'm gonna give you
[1:29:32] and run around again you say eyes I gave
[1:29:35] Moses the son I'm also giving you this
[1:29:38] heart I don't really know
[1:29:41] how can you get
[1:29:44] something that is wet and put fire under
[1:29:49] it
[1:29:50] because things need to be dry for the
[1:29:53] fire to work but with Elijah you must
[1:29:57] put things right for the fire to work in
[1:30:01] other words when the larger comes back
[1:30:03] he needs to also preach as brother Robin
[1:30:06] paradox
[1:30:09] amen
[1:30:13] it's coming from your Bible
[1:30:17] I tell you to preach paradox
[1:30:25] are you there then we started on Paul
[1:30:31] everybody clear why do you choose God
[1:30:35] wow
[1:30:37] number one
[1:30:39] we have three dispensations
[1:30:42] amen we have the dispossession of the
[1:30:44] lord
[1:30:45] we started by Moses
[1:30:48] and we have the dispensation of Grace
[1:30:50] that came by Jesus Christ amen by Jesus
[1:30:53] died and goes amen and he left the
[1:30:56] church who carried that dispensation
[1:30:58] Hallelujah
[1:31:00] we have Moses here
[1:31:02] who carried that disposition until the
[1:31:05] coming of course the first come
[1:31:08] Elijah came here as an example as a
[1:31:12] demonstration
[1:31:13] because before Christ came another
[1:31:15] Elijah is there I'm gonna get today are
[1:31:19] you there yes
[1:31:23] it's a reference
[1:31:27] here look back to the reference if
[1:31:30] Elijah comes back again looks back to
[1:31:32] the reference if Elijah come back again
[1:31:34] looked back to the reference are you
[1:31:36] there
[1:31:37] so he was like a guinea pig
[1:31:40] are you there an example to test and to
[1:31:43] see how that Ministry work then this man
[1:31:47] said this was the Lord now we are
[1:31:49] dealing with Grace but with Grace Jesus
[1:31:51] goes until the second coming but on the
[1:31:55] second coming here we see someone by the
[1:31:58] name of Paul why Paul amen amen put your
[1:32:02] kids
[1:32:04] let's go straight with God I'm sorry if
[1:32:08] I'm going slowly I'm not trying to take
[1:32:11] too many service but I need to log this
[1:32:14] if even if it takes 20 don't worry
[1:32:19] yeah we don't want you to sit again and
[1:32:22] wonder why you believe this message
[1:32:25] and then somebody will come and send you
[1:32:28] to a crazy website or something and you
[1:32:31] come up there like you don't even know
[1:32:32] your Bible
[1:32:46] have you noticed that my voice was
[1:32:49] already here yes yes okay praise God
[1:32:53] it's supposed to be written by whom
[1:32:56] simple
[1:32:58] the greatest Bible it's positive I guess
[1:33:02] the word you have ever had outside of
[1:33:05] their lord Jesus Christ power was
[1:33:08] separated there he wanted to say that I
[1:33:11] don't know it's the wrong one now Paul
[1:33:13] was a real God for what
[1:33:16] so according to brother Brahman Paul is
[1:33:20] a teacher
[1:33:21] we all know about the scripture that
[1:33:24] Paul was an apostle
[1:33:26] Apostle means a missionary somebody who
[1:33:30] is said just like John was an apostle
[1:33:33] Pig there was an apostle but tell him he
[1:33:36] was an apostle Apostle means somebody
[1:33:38] who is said no problem now let's come to
[1:33:42] the second if you need more I have it
[1:33:45] Hebrew again chapter one this is verse
[1:33:47] in regard to 34. now Paul was such a
[1:33:51] Bible what
[1:33:52] because teacher because he was taught
[1:33:55] under that great all-time famous
[1:34:00] okay Paul is a teacher
[1:34:02] no problem let's stand back now to write
[1:34:06] to chapter 12 in just a minute amen act
[1:34:08] 20. see Paul do you believe Powers here
[1:34:12] Prophet yeah
[1:34:14] amen
[1:34:16] Amen brother Branham saying Paul is a
[1:34:20] prophet while Ibraham said Paul was a
[1:34:23] teacher where is it in the Bible that
[1:34:26] Paul is a teacher
[1:34:28] why is it in the Bible that Paul is the
[1:34:30] prophet show me a quote show me a
[1:34:32] scripture so Paul Brothers
[1:34:38] there is no scripture where Paul is a
[1:34:41] teacher they always say Paul the Apostle
[1:34:43] Paul the Apostle Paul the Apostle
[1:34:46] by the runner do you believe power was a
[1:34:49] prophet might watch that sure he was let
[1:34:53] me drop down now this is Paul a prophet
[1:34:57] for telling what would come to pass we
[1:35:00] want the scripture here where Paul was
[1:35:03] saying and the coming of the Lord they
[1:35:06] will come and falling away they will
[1:35:07] come and follow me away oh brother
[1:35:09] Stephen that one you are just
[1:35:11] interpreting the scripture anybody can
[1:35:13] prophesy I want to see show me where
[1:35:16] Paul is a prophet in the Bible
[1:35:24] God probably expose us to certain stuff
[1:35:26] so you hear it and you know you know
[1:35:28] what to inoculate in the church
[1:35:31] let's watch him
[1:35:33] do you believe God was a prophet
[1:35:36] if you notice every time God the problem
[1:35:39] gives this he doesn't give a scripture
[1:35:42] last week brother Brian have said that
[1:35:45] it was a prophet David was a prophet
[1:35:47] David was a prophet but brother brother
[1:35:49] never give a scripture
[1:35:51] brilliant
[1:35:53] you see your Prophet is not scripture
[1:35:55] yet last week I proved to you in the
[1:35:58] Bible that David was a prophet
[1:36:01] if you don't understand something in
[1:36:04] this message
[1:36:06] cheat out
[1:36:07] right
[1:36:08] that's right
[1:36:12] you don't play with prophets like that
[1:36:14] do you believe Paul what's the problem
[1:36:16] if I say Keep Calm you won't understand
[1:36:18] I'm saying that could
[1:36:21] so you get that really well to relax
[1:36:27] Paul came on the sea and saw a son what
[1:36:31] kind of sound did he see a pillar of
[1:36:34] fire on his word to the marriage
[1:36:37] brother Stephen you say Paul is a
[1:36:40] teacher you say Paul he is a prophet so
[1:36:43] in other words you are telling me that
[1:36:45] Paul have to gift
[1:36:49] oh my God
[1:36:53] [Music]
[1:36:56] but the Bible say God has set some in
[1:37:00] the church God has a person Prophet
[1:37:05] teacher evangelists and so forth up in
[1:37:09] the church God has set them in there and
[1:37:13] they are inspired for a certain word and
[1:37:16] then some people
[1:37:18] May possess more than
[1:37:25] but they are
[1:37:27] the head at least be one gift or more in
[1:37:33] the person but the problem is saying if
[1:37:36] you are a preacher you must have at
[1:37:39] least
[1:37:41] you cannot be a give a preacher without
[1:37:44] a gift you must have at least one gift
[1:37:47] if you have more no problem but at least
[1:37:50] one gift for you to preach the gospel so
[1:37:54] there are people that can help more than
[1:37:56] one gift
[1:37:59] yeah I understand you are talking about
[1:38:01] brother brother but to me I want to see
[1:38:04] the scripture

[1:38:26] the five Ministry but it's possible we
[1:38:31] could have more than one like amen
[1:38:38] is it difficult
[1:38:40] amen the right people or any of those

[1:43:27] you cannot have two gifts
[1:43:31] let's go slowly let me bring that
[1:43:33] quickly
[1:43:35] let's read it together
[1:43:36] [Music]
[1:43:40] that's what they talk about brother was
[1:43:43] a prophet okay God Jordan do the work of
[1:43:48] an Avenger by the man I'm saying if
[1:43:50] you've noticed he didn't say you are an
[1:43:52] Avengers but you do the work
[1:43:54] no problem didn't say was an Avenger
[1:43:58] said do the work of inventions I know
[1:44:00] this code will spin on someone are you
[1:44:03] there for the hour will come one God
[1:44:06] that is to be changed that hour is
[1:44:09] arriving all right yes you can mix
[1:44:15] Miss
[1:44:19] Miss
[1:44:21] brother pranam didn't say you get half
[1:44:25] [Music]
[1:44:26] we are correcting something you can't
[1:44:30] miss
[1:44:32] two or three different Ministry
[1:44:36] not you cannot have because by the word
[1:44:40] of goddess you can have more than one
[1:44:42] gift but you cannot mix
[1:44:49] two or three different Ministry together
[1:44:52] pastor and evangelist you cannot be a
[1:44:56] pastor and you keep going out and going
[1:44:59] out and going out and going out
[1:45:05] take care of the ship
[1:45:07] it doesn't mean he cannot travel it
[1:45:10] doesn't mean he cannot go somewhere for
[1:45:12] a meeting and come back but the
[1:45:14] frequency of living leaving the church
[1:45:17] living leaving the church living living
[1:45:19] the church
[1:45:21] that's why the problem when they say do
[1:45:24] the work of it evangelist he call
[1:45:26] brother give him the judge and brother
[1:45:29] brother miss out because you cannot wait
[1:45:32] I'm amazed amen amen
[1:45:38] you can't be a prophet and maybe a
[1:45:42] pastor that's why he gave it to brother
[1:45:44] at the same time the problem is the same
[1:45:49] time once you leave this you go to the
[1:45:52] other are you there because you have
[1:45:55] different works
[1:45:58] different Ministry evangelists want you
[1:46:01] to do this business a pastor wants you
[1:46:03] to take care of the tree
[1:46:19] the Bible said he left the sheep with
[1:46:22] another keeper
[1:46:25] everybody
[1:46:27] all right now why do we need thought why
[1:46:31] are we taking part
[1:46:34] Paul was very fundamental
[1:46:37] we know he's a teacher scripture in
[1:46:40] everything that he did
[1:46:42] now we all have to believe that because
[1:46:45] the Bible we will be beginning to
[1:46:47] believe the Bible God will not permit
[1:46:50] this man whose man
[1:46:52] Paul to write the Bible the books in the
[1:46:56] Bible that he did
[1:46:59] everybody ready okay I believe Paul
[1:47:04] of the New Testament was like Moses
[1:47:12] everybody there why did you put Moses
[1:47:15] here and why do you put Power
[1:47:19] okay
[1:47:20] I believe Paul of the New Testament was
[1:47:25] life Moses of the old so your modern
[1:47:29] Moses his power
[1:47:34] Jesus started from Moses
[1:47:37] we're standing by Paul
[1:47:40] and Paul was a missionary
[1:47:44] Prophet Apostle Prophet today
[1:47:49] not the Jews we gave you the scriptures
[1:47:51] on part one of this
[1:47:55] absolutely who wrote the book of Hebrew
[1:47:57] Paul should he was inspired to do it but
[1:48:01] why
[1:48:03] of Fire that made him
[1:48:07] worse in him amen
[1:48:11] Moses made the pillow fight
[1:48:15] just like Paul make the pillow fight yes
[1:48:19] I'm going slow
[1:48:21] that is the reason God he could write
[1:48:24] you go back in unveiling of God brother
[1:48:27] Adam said the pillar of fire was
[1:48:29] immersed
[1:48:31] so happened
[1:48:33] that's the reason Moses what the first
[1:48:37] four books of the Bible because that
[1:48:41] Pillar of Fire
[1:48:42] so the same thing that came to Moses
[1:48:45] that make him wrote books give us up to
[1:48:48] work
[1:48:50] no one the poor writes books because God
[1:48:53] does not change
[1:48:57] amen how would he ever know how creation
[1:49:01] study how did Moses know that in the
[1:49:04] beginning was the word in the beginning
[1:49:06] the word was informed without form
[1:49:28] on him
[1:49:30] Moses had that option
[1:49:34] no problem
[1:49:35] whatever happens take his Ephesians
[1:49:39] chapter 3.
[1:49:43] Hallelujah
[1:49:49] and lastly because I am joyful
[1:49:55] I can't say I'm feeling religious so my
[1:49:58] way is laughing
[1:50:00] hey
[1:50:03] Ephesians chapter 3 verse one everybody
[1:50:05] dead yes
[1:50:07] first of all
[1:50:09] for this cause I but I hope God the
[1:50:15] prisoner of Jesus Christ for you who
[1:50:18] choose oh thank you somebody's not
[1:50:21] sleeping check out
[1:50:23] if you have heard of the dispossession
[1:50:27] of what

[1:50:32] the dispensation of grace of God which
[1:50:36] was given to me to all you you are
[1:50:40] gender
[1:50:42] Moses was giving the law
[1:50:45] power was given and brought the problem

[1:50:56] scripture Amanda very scripture thank

[1:51:30] according to what to the grace remember
[1:51:33] Paul in efficient God has that in this
[1:51:36] possession of one Grace was given to him
[1:51:40] and according to that dispensation of
[1:51:42] Grace
[1:51:43] they're pulling through the grace of God
[1:51:45] which give it to me I say wise Master
[1:51:49] building I have left
[1:52:08] the foundation of the dispensation of
[1:52:11] the Lord that's why we are standing
[1:52:14] through God you are the brother he said
[1:52:16] the mystery of God made not to us in
[1:52:20] this day by the same Heavenly messenger
[1:52:23] that was made known in them days notice
[1:52:26] the same purify that sent Moses the same
[1:52:31] period of fire that was on Moses that
[1:52:34] wrote the Bible the same Pillar of Fire
[1:52:36] that Paul meant on his road to Damascus
[1:52:40] Paul wrote the New Testament
[1:52:48] what they see
[1:52:50] but Paul had the Revelation he pulled it
[1:52:55] out for he had met the pillar of fire
[1:52:57] himself
[1:52:58] but Moses came on the sea he had the
[1:53:02] Revelation he met the pillar of fire and
[1:53:05] he was revealed Immortals out Genesis he
[1:53:07] wrote the first four books of the Bible
[1:53:09] was his name for he met God in the form
[1:53:12] of the pillar of fire then in the pillar
[1:53:15] of Fire
[1:53:17] okay
[1:53:20] Daddy's variable

[1:53:26] earth made the Tabernacle like the
[1:53:29] things that he saw in heaven we know
[1:53:31] that don't we we find God did what
[1:53:35] the same thing
[1:53:38] must have Hebrew 9 that Moses men feeds
[1:53:42] just like he did and Paul in his vision
[1:53:45] when he went out into heaven when he
[1:53:49] taught that great book of Hebrew he must
[1:53:52] have saw in his vision the same thing
[1:53:55] down was his soul because he said that
[1:53:59] he thought that wonderful book of Hebrew
[1:54:02] so Bob is Moses of the Old Testament
[1:54:07] everybody did okay
[1:54:35] wrote the Bible

[1:54:40] Moses came after Abraham God came after
[1:54:43] the disciple but he wrote more than all
[1:54:45] of them are you there

[1:54:50] Moses trained you know to deliver the
[1:54:53] children of Israel by military man Paul
[1:54:56] train to take them out of the hand of
[1:54:58] Roman and put them free by his
[1:55:00] ecclesiastical force in the world that

[1:56:29] tell his people
[1:56:31] in other words the people of Moses got
[1:56:35] in trouble about marriage and divorce
[1:56:39] God gave Moses the right as a messenger
[1:56:44] to give a solution to Israel by giving
[1:56:49] them a level of divorces
[1:56:53] when Paul came and found military
[1:56:56] divorce God gave God the authority to

[1:57:30] great Apostle who was the mother of the
[1:57:33] New Testament as Moses of the O Lord
[1:57:36] Murphy is what they know and the
[1:57:38] dispensation of the Lord many Prophet
[1:57:41] their words were injected into it but
[1:57:43] Moses wrote The Lord You Suffer him a
[1:57:47] writing tonight the writing of
[1:57:49] divorcement the great example being the
[1:57:52] writer of the New Testament could also
[1:57:54] make such as they are such an assertion
[1:57:57] that I if this is called speaking like
[1:58:00] Moses say I give you the letter Paul
[1:58:02] also say I speak under this condition I

[2:04:12] I do not condemn Jonah you know
[2:04:16] they say well he's Jonah you have heard
[2:04:18] that expression but you must not do that
[2:04:21] Christian you should not condemn God's
[2:04:23] server
[2:04:26] he was not heard of the will of God he
[2:04:30] just did he did just exactly he must do
[2:04:34] that forever
[2:04:44] it is not again
[2:04:48] absolutely
[2:04:51] everything happened not by just
[2:04:54] happening it happened forever
[2:05:00] one time the prophet had to marry
[2:05:03] prostitute having children by him one
[2:05:06] way on his side for 340 years they don't
[2:05:09] offered to the other side one strip is
[2:05:12] close
[2:05:13] he brought a brother brother would have
[2:05:15] stripped his clothes with everything
[2:05:17] going on what are we going to say
[2:05:20] he's a false prophet you see he was
[2:05:23] preaching to Ella
[2:05:25] there
[2:05:27] Isaiah in the Bible stripping his club
[2:05:29] and prophesy naked go rejected the Bible
[2:05:33] for that
[2:05:37] so
[2:05:39] prophesy in the Bible naked
[2:05:42] go reject the Bible for that
[2:05:45] and to shock you more the son of God
[2:05:50] Jesus Christ was in the past naked
[2:05:54] standing the song
[2:05:58] and sending the faith of the Cross to
[2:06:01] Paradise naked
[2:06:05] amen thank you Lord thank you
[2:06:09] thank you Jesus just everything did for
[2:06:15] stands Jonah had to do it for sounds
[2:06:19] remember Abraham have to marry Edgar
[2:06:21] against his own will when Sarah gives
[2:06:24] the husband that he refuses but God
[2:06:27] appeared to him listen to Sarah because
[2:06:29] a full woman will not hear with the bad
[2:06:32] woman what is it a son all of it a son
[2:06:35] God that speaks for Sons when they say
[2:06:39] Billy Paul
[2:06:45] just like Moses prophesied for the
[2:06:49] coming of the Lord this is why we were
[2:06:51] stopping then Paul also prophesied for
[2:06:55] the second coming of the Lord he said
[2:06:57] Lord will come with a shark with the
[2:07:00] force of the Archangel and the cell
[2:07:02] members and the dead in Christ shall
[2:07:04] rise up again the Lord will not come
[2:07:06] until there is a falling away
[2:07:09] just like Moses called The Elder of
[2:07:13] Israel and told them that after my
[2:07:15] departure you will read Faith did Valor
[2:07:19] so-called the ambience
[2:07:21] let's see where Paul come here of the
[2:07:23] church and we stop right here
[2:07:25] let's take the book of Anthony
[2:07:37] chapter 20.
[2:07:51] if you're there you can say amen amen
[2:07:53] are they saying Amen brother Michael by
[2:07:56] the David okay uh verse 16.
[2:08:00] at 20 verse 16.
[2:08:03] for Paul
[2:08:06] have determined to sell by emphasis
[2:08:09] because he would not spend the time in
[2:08:11] Asia
[2:08:18] and from my righteous he sent to Ephesus
[2:08:21] and God did
[2:08:23] Moses called who
[2:08:26] why are these things lined up like that
[2:08:33] and God here there's just that church
[2:08:37] level 17 let's jump to verse 25.
[2:08:41] and now behold I know this is not
[2:08:45] talking
[2:08:46] that you are among whom I have gone
[2:08:49] preaching the kingdom of God shall see
[2:08:52] my face no more in other words I'm
[2:08:55] living just like Moses will stand in
[2:08:57] Israel
[2:08:58] what for I take you to wake up remember
[2:09:00] Moses was taking us up remember Moses
[2:09:03] last week I take you to write on this
[2:09:06] day that I am pure from the blood of all
[2:09:09] men remember Moses two kids I am right
[2:09:11] there he said I know I'm taking witness
[2:09:14] against the heaven or something then I'm
[2:09:16] leaving I know he says I'm taking you to
[2:09:20] record this day that I am pure from the
[2:09:23] blood of all men for I have not shown to
[2:09:26] declare to you all the Council of them
[2:09:28] of God take me therefore to yourself and
[2:09:33] to walk the flock of the witch the Holy
[2:09:36] Ghost has made you overseer to fill the
[2:09:38] Church of God which he has purchased
[2:09:41] with his own blood for not this that
[2:09:45] after my departure just like Moses said
[2:09:55] also on your own selves so not only are
[2:10:00] people gonna get in the message to God's
[2:10:03] trouble but some that believes the
[2:10:05] message before will rise in Apostle

[2:10:27] years I cease not to warn you every
[2:10:30] night and day with tears and now
[2:10:33] Brethren are commend you to God and to
[2:10:36] the word of his grace which is able to
[2:10:38] build you up and to give you an
[2:10:40] inheritance among all them which are
[2:10:43] Sanctified just like Moses
[2:10:49] about the second coming just like Moses
[2:10:52] told the church I know when I'm living
[2:10:55] you're gonna depart from the faith Paul
[2:10:58] is also telling the truth I know some
[2:11:00] will depart from the thing I know when I
[2:11:03] live some will be part of different when
[2:11:05] they depart from the faith then we will
