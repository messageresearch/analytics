both visible and invisible audience amen if there is any family member here God richly bless you but uh brother Caleb just give me a little bit and to make sure I can hear myself it's a church prayer not the church should be full amen the church should be full amen oh my I believe everybody is up to date with the sermon right glory to God glory glory hallelujah amen continue to read your books your Cod your church age is and everything and just a reminder Saturday at 2 30 right you already know where it is Young sisters so we meet at the venue for the young Sisters Meeting and on June the 24th Lord's willing that's a question and answer if somebody sent me a message or a text or something just be patient with me uh have been attacked left and right by hell amen but we got the victory I'm here amen I was almost at the brink of saying maybe brother Kelly go ahead and pick this up and move on so I sent them a text today I say the Deacon I say you pray for me and after 15 minutes things begin to change after both of them responded so I know the devil is mad and I'm not happy either so we're pressing on and everything will be okay standing here it's by the grace of God if you notice my wife is probably streaming she's not here so you know what I have been going through it's it's heavy from hell and it comes in a different way but I know what he's looking after and we know how to maneuver out of this thing amen so we got the victory we're here tonight by God's grace amen let's go to Second Chronicles chapter seven I'm using my uh question and answer Bible so I don't have the court uh the slide line up but thank God brother Caleb tried to manage to put everything on the on the PowerPoint so so that you can follow me it's not going to be in order so I will be jumping left and right just like we did the music part one part two and part three so we will approach this as a Sunday school lesson as a teaching amen I don't know if 30 minutes is enough to cover prayer pray is a big and huge subject amen second Chronicle chapter 7 verse 14. I hope those that are not here are streaming because it was announced for a long time and I even have a quote whenever you see you want to pray and the devil is blocking you it's a signal that there is a blessing so if you try to make it to church in prayer night and something block you just know they was blocking you for a blessing amen second Chronicle chapter 7 verse 14 the Bible says amen If my people not anybody do you see why it's hard for me to preach this in 30 minutes right if my people so you gotta be a people of love amen it's not everybody it is my people in other words it's concerning God's people amen If my people which are called by my you might be seated so those people don't carry their name amen amen amen these people do not carry their name they don't call them brother Isaac they don't call these people Brother David they don't call them brother polycarp Junior they call those people by the name of God and we know the name of God is Jesus Christ everybody okay so if the people that are Jesus amen amen this was the Old Testament now the opening of the seals is opening something different so you preach with me okay or you teach with me okay so these people are not just people they are the people of God and they don't call them the people of God they have a name it's a collective name [Applause] everybody okay so everybody that is part of that group amen have that name amen amen if you call that name you're not calling one person you are calling a group of people you are calling the people of God the people of God that are called by his name amen and the name of God we know that the name of God is Jesus so the people of God that are called Jesus amen how do you get the name Jesus when can God call you Jesus I don't know if 30 minutes is enough okay I will try my best amen that's why I send the second message to brother Caleb I say call this part one If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and do water so before prayer god require you to humble yourself thank you that people need to Humble amen amen and pray you don't just pray you humble yourself then you pray everybody okay and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways so somebody to turn around brother Branham say it's a word for repentance amen amen amen those people are humbling themselves they are praying seeking God Amen and God is also adding a repentance amen meaning something did some somebody did something wrong he says then I will hear from where I know it's Wednesday maybe the Devil beats you down at work but be alive if not we need to hand you microphones okay I need to maybe give brother Kelly microphone back there so we can preach together amen amen God say I will hear from where so God is Not on Earth you will understand why I'm saying this so somebody is on Earth and somebody else is in heaven everybody okay so you're not in the same location are we okay they are these people is on Earth amen amen and God is in heaven glory to God so on the earth we got the people of God we are the people of God right we are never here right call by his name amen the name is Jesus Christ and for you to be called Jesus Christ you must be part of the Bride we okay now amen these people are on earth and In Heaven There is Hope amen so God say if these people humble themselves praying seek me repent turn from their ways I will hear not from the Earth I'm gonna hear from where amen so the connection Between Heaven and Earth is what everybody okay everybody okay the communication between Heaven and Earth is water [Music] we can even stop right here everybody okay everybody okay if you're in trouble if you need a number that you don't know everybody okay then I will hear from heaven and we'll do what forgive their sin and heal the water so somebody here is in trouble they need a healing [Music] okay these people are in trouble and they need a healing and the healing not of their body foreign amen amen but they need to do this and whoever is over there will answer them amen so the prayer is not complete if this man do not answer let's go to First Timothy chapter 2. amen Lord help me brother Robert you let me know when it's 45 minutes or something I gave a 15-minute Grace second tip First Timothy chapter 2. verse 8 if you dare you can say Amen pages are still turning I will try to keep this as a teaching I will therefore in other board Paul preferred I will therefore that man do what pray well so prayer should be way you pray in the bathroom you pray in the kitchen you pray in your car you pray in your bedroom you pray in Walmart Paul wants us to pray well so this thing that we're trying to talk about is available everywhere amen even at work lifting up holy hands without and water so if you want to pray you cannot be upset [Applause] oh Lord have mercy is my Bible I'm using this King James Bible okay is it different [Music] so you cannot Pray when you are upset amen and the second thing is you cannot pray where amen if you doubt why are you praying then and I'm gonna show you if you're already doubting don't waste your time amen if your husband got you mad or your wife got you mad or your children got you mad you need to cool down everybody okay everybody okay you cannot Pray when you are upset I'm already teaching you prayer amen one day there was a prophet who was upset his name is Elisha amen they brought him a case and because of what happened with the case and Jezebel he got upset to the man that was talking to him amen now they needed a solution and the man was a prophet not because of his attitude everybody okay there was no way for him to enter into prayer do you know what he did he called for a song leader Amen to play First music and when music came and changed the atmosphere amen then the spirit of the Lord was able to come and the men could receive a solution you don't pray when you're upset everybody okay so if you see something that is trying to upset you closer to your prayer time you need to be careful and try to avoid it because your state is important before you pray before you pray you must have a complete a a a a same a calm a good atmosphere sometimes you get into a house and you see children doing things to upset you if you're not spiritual enough you will begin to get upset because you don't understand that the devil is working with your children I have the quote where they were doing that for brother Branham amen and after you get upset then you're not going to be able to go pray you don't pray when you're upset you don't pray when you doubting everybody okay let's go to James chapter 5. I don't know if I'm teaching or preaching it's hard to tell amen God's people call by his name humble Earth and Heaven very important if I can only touch that that will be good let's go to James Chapter Five if you're there you can say Amen oh God glory to God verse 14. is any among you let him call the Elder of the church and let them do water so solution to sickness is water pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of water so you can pray without faith that's why Paul said do not pray doubting amen I will show you those things as I'm moving it's different than the prayer of faith it's not just praying amen it's the prayer of in his prayer with amen and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up if he has committed sin they shall be forgiven him confess your fault one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed the effects of fervent prayer so this prayer is not just prayer it is perfect amen there is an emotion there is a difference between a prayer with emotion and a prayer that is dry everybody okay we have a fervent prayer and I'm using the word emotion amen I know when we talk about prayer all we see is two hours five hours seven hours please let that alone first okay let's go like from kindergarten okay okay until we get to your five hours because you want to know how to you how you can pray seven hours you can go seven hours and come out to zero and somebody enter five minutes and come up with an answer amen the effects of prayer fervent prayer of a water not of a man a man that is how how can you be righteous because the Bible say Christ is our so that's why it's important to be called in his so when you are presenting before God you're not presenting you the one that is approaching God is Jesus Christ okay Elias was a man subject to like passion as we in other words their lies that you heard is not different than you he was eating like you he was a human like you talking like you doing things like you and he pray how earnestly amen that Iman naturally and he went not on the Earth by the space of three years and water and he prayed again another way he looks like Elijah have something that he can play with prayer open close open close and he works for him but but what James is saying is he was not a supernatural being like an angel he was a human but that human could talk and close heaven and he talked in the open again so you can close the entire country's Heaven one man can do that when that one man can also open not five men not a group of men not a whole church just one person amen and he pray again and they have indeed what gave rain and the Earth brought forth her fruit so the power to open to close was in the hand of a man in the Old Testament who knew how to pray let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly tonight father once again thanking you for your grace for your love and your mercy for me to be standing here it is nothing but the grace of God and your mercy Lord may you help us tonight as we're talking about this subject may you move me completely out of the way may you remove every trouble that the devil have thrown on your children on their Pathway to trouble them to weary them to make them tired but father May the strength from the Holy Spirit come tonight and may you speak to us and help us catch the things that belongs to us for the betterment of our families of Our Lives of our church of our of your kingdom in the name of Jesus Christ amen my subject tonight is teach us to pray my subject to none is teach us to pray everybody okay I will be reading brother Branham back and forth amen why is this prayer subject such a huge big subject why is he good amen Brother Brad I'm saying in the message faith brother Caleb the first uh quote in paragraph five brother Branham say Prayer Changes Things prayer changes death to life he said prayer changes sickness to health I'm reading it's on the board right uh please give brother Benjamin the microphone come over here so we can do this job together amen let me get some amen coming up left and right amen glory to God yes sir please be to the name of the Lord brother Branham say prayer changes sickness to health that he changes Sinners to Center [Music] so if you want to change a deaf situation into a life you need prayer [Applause] if you want to remove sickness into Health you need prayer in other words prayer is something that you can connect to something bad and prayer will change it into something good [Applause] everybody okay brother Branham say you may last too much you may shout too much you may eat too much but you shall never pray too much because where do we pray everywhere [Music] [Applause] in other words you can never reach a level in your life that you feel like you're comfortable with praying prayer is something you need every day it is something you need every time [Music] [Applause] I know when we talk about prayer what we have a tendency is to go kneel and do this that's where we're missing how are you gonna kneel if you are driving your car how are you gonna near if you're working on your job how am I gonna kneel if I'm pulling a tooth how are you gonna kneel if you cooking but you can pray cooking you can pray pulling a tooth amen you can play drops in your car [Music] um everybody okay brother Branham said the Bible say I will that man pray everywhere lifting up holy hand so you shall never be able to pray too much so prayer will never have a summit you will not have a top level where you wish you say now I pray too much even if you pray now you can continue to pray amen prayer Prayer Changes Things amen glory be to the name of the Lord let me follow my GPS here why are we talking about prayer in the church brother Caleb where he said the burden for prayer it's on the second page brother Branham say I rather have a church that had such a burden on their heart for prayer that they just stay at this Altar and will be there day and night and everything else and in their house was constantly in prayer and humble so you pray in your house and you pray in the church but brother Branham is talking about humble because the scripture that we read say if my people do water [Music] and trying to get the people to God and making calls at the hospital and visiting the sick and trying to get the people to come to church and do right I rather have that all the other put together although the other is right he belongs in the church brother Branham wanted church that has a burden to pray a burden to pray in church and a burden to pray at home and they burden to pray every way we talking about teachers how to pray amen why do we need all of these things why is the importance in prayer brother Branham say prayer is the most father first that God ever put in the hand of a mankind the most effective force that is known to man is prayer do you believe that yes sir yes sir it is prayer that changes things if you want something to change in your life go to prayer amen if you want your children to change go to prayer amen if you need a good job God to pray if you want to change in your marriages God to pray if you want a good church God to pray amen why Prayer Changes Things in the second quote get the people to believe brother Branham saying god listen to a mortal's prayer and I say this with all true reverence there is not another force on Earth there is nothing on Earth no matter what it is what kind of gift it is there is nothing in the world that will come ahead of Prayer prayer is what does the work that's right we are talking too much you are spending five hours on the telephone try to solve something try praying [Applause] prayer will serve a situation without you doing anything prayer will change your situation when you are sleeping when you are eating prayer will resolve problems prayer will keep your child in school when you are not around yourself prayer will keep your husband at work [Music] come back if your husband is struggling with something put him in prayer because you're not going to be driving around with him put him in prayer and see what prayer can do oh God I'm I'm just on the surface we are dropping slowly okay brother Branham say in my angel go before me he said whatsoever you ask the father in my name that I will do whatsoever things Mark 11 24 whatsoever thinks you desire When you pray believe you receive it you shall have it now he gave us the strongest weapon that there is in all the world and that is prayer is what changes things the Christian does not relax what a force he has when he kneels on his knee before almighty God In The Name of Jesus Christ he does not realize what power that it is if the people could only realize that what is given right unto them anything that you ask for will be given if you can appropriate the faith to believe it for God's word is true one more and we clamber and the only way or not to do let me go back here on the next one brother Branham say expectation so what we got to do is to get back into the program of God and find out after all what God wants us to do and the only way and not to do is prayer prayer is the key that is the answer Prayer Changes Things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in control of human beings there is no atomic bomb no sir oh no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer amen prayer changes demand of God Amen do you know what atomic bomb does when they send it he goes there and destroy everything and he destroyed the enemy and if you want your enemy to be destroyed [Music] amen [Applause] brother uh uh tell him find me radar prayer is a radar because we're talking about shooting a bomb and we're gonna get into it brother brand I'm saying the message count down he says and we brother Branham say remember the astronaut is controlled by radar power you've seen them bring John Glenn in I look down there at Cape at Canaveral and seen that great big radar thing and you could not even see him nowhere but you could tell where he was by the way that the radar was pointing that is where he is it in other words they're looking at the radar it does and they can tell where the man is brother Branham say and we got a radar too that's right amen [Applause] [Music] ask the father anything in my name I will do it just watch the way the prayer is going you can see the way he is pointing just watch the way the church is what pray you can see the way the missile will do whatever if you want to send a missile you need to go and pray amen praise God that's what he said demon has been tormenting your family and you want to send a message you need to go in place that's right amen when you are in prayer that when you say in the name of Jesus that's right come out of my children come out of my husband come out of my job you can tell by the way the astronauts are traveling but the way the church is doing water prayer prayer prayer prayer is something very important everybody okay glory glory be to God Amen it is so important that it must come ahead of everything pray your life must be primary brother Kelly the next one brother Branham said in the message testimony a new Christian don't stay in your lukewarm condition anymore lay aside water everything just get as close to God as you can walk with him but your prayer life so your prayer life should be always the top amen because Prayer Changes Things that's right because prayer is the key amen because prayer is the one it's it's your best where you can send bomb praise God we took our prayer line we put them down [Music] and we put our intellect on top of them that's why we don't see God doing many things because we miss the order the top of your life should be prayer everything okay everybody good brother Stephen now we understand what prayer is we understand how important prayer is we understand that we need to pray everywhere we understand that if we want to change a situation we need prayer if we want to send an atomic bomb we need prayer if we want our house to change we need prayer we understand that prayer need to be the first place but can you teach somebody how to pray are you trying to introduce a Catholicism in the message can you teach somebody prayer or prayer is somebody that some ill or or is it something that someone needs to know let's go to Luke chapter 11. my subject tonight is teach us to pray let's go to Luke chapter 11. if you dare you can say Amen oh God Hallelujah thank you Jesus if you're there you can say Amen can you teach somebody how to pray Luke chapter 11 verse 1. if you dare you can say amen amen the Bible say and he came to pass that as he was what pray in a certain place when he did water ceased one of his disciples say unto him the Lord daughter teach us to pray that's why I got my tattoo so the disciple were living with Jesus Christ and the notice in the life of Jesus Christ that he was praying a certain way amen that they don't know [Applause] instead of just following Jesus Christ one of the disciples stood and say wait a minute when we go throughout the day this man doesn't pray too much he's always executing miracle why because he's already charged up before he can go out amen everybody okay his gasoline has already been filled amen Jesus was feeling his tank with prayer [Applause] [Music] so when he get on the highway if there is a traffic he doesn't bother him he bothered the one who doesn't have enough gasoline [Applause] because he's ambushed he didn't know whether there would be an accident on the road or not amen so one of the disciples they watch him praying praying praying praying praying when he finish he came out he say Lord teach us how to water pray so you can teach somebody how to pray amen it is not Catholicism oh sir everybody okay he said teach us to pray Karma as who John also did what else are his disciples so John the Baptist sat down and taught his disciple had to pray amen in the message we enter in the message and we grow up in the message and very few times have we learned how to pray preach Brothers everybody is praying according to the denomination they came under if somebody came from the Pentecostal Church they will be praying like a Pentecostal the Baptists will pray like a Baptist the one who came from the Methodist will pray like a Methodist but the disciples say Lord do what teach us how to do what to pray so you can teach somebody how to pray amen so we want to know prayer teaching from the master himself amen amen amen what is let's see how the master teaches everybody okay they ask the master they say teach us how to pray amen so what Jesus is delivering is a teaching everybody okay it is a teaching on water prayer I know Our Father who are in heaven Hallowed be thy name that Kingdom let's slow down they ask him a question teach us how to pray Jesus is trying to teach us how to pray let's see how he's teaching us you ready now verse 2. and he said unto them when ye pray water Our Father which are in water Heaven notice the father is well in heaven notice the father his way in heaven do you follow me yes sir [Applause] Our Father which are in water heaven Hallowed be the water the kingdom water that will be water I in heaven as in water Earth what does this mean it means if this is the teaching of Prayer so our life is simple if I have a problem Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name that Kingdom Come that will be done enough that's Catholicism and then amen amen amen if you're in the hospital Our Father who are in heaven if you wake up in the morning Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom and the power amen and amen and you go I did my prayer no sir if that is what Jesus gave how can Jesus was praying all night so was he there saying Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name our father that Catholicism so what is really about this prayer what is it everybody okay everybody okay yes sir buddy Caleb let's go to model it's way way way down toward the back in the message my life story preached in 1952 on July the 20th brother Branham say in paragraph 17. he said Our Father who are in heaven hallowed the kingdom come then we'll be done repeating the mother prayer so this prayer is a model everybody okay they prayed the teaching Jesus is bringing out Jesus is teaching Prayer by giving us a murder prayer a mother brother Branham called that a mother what is a mother everybody okay everybody okay in the message the house the one that followed brother Branham say now our head bow let's just repeat the water prayer a mother is something that is given to people everybody okay as an example to follow amen or to imitate amen this prayer is a standard model amen if you wanna if you have a prayer you need to take your prayer and learn how to match up your prayer with the prayer model that's right thank you I don't know if you're getting what I'm saying that's right amen amen because your need might be different than brother Mickey's boy they make his need will be different than brother John and father Mike amen but the model remained the same everybody okay everybody okay the formula remain the same that's right amen excuse me if he stumble you okay when I say X Plus y

two they were teaching you the model that's right how to add two numbers and to come up with something amen and Jesus gave us the mother prayer if you wanna pray father the mother Faith amen [Applause] everybody okay everybody good everybody good now before I go down with the mother of Prayer let's start it over again let's go my friend with our mother prayer now you understand that we can teach somebody praying and Jesus taught us by the model by our reference something we can imitate amen because somebody said Daily Bread all you need in your life is bread there are people here probably that didn't eat bread what about if you eat rice everybody okay what about if you eat pizza do you see Pizza there [Music] do you see what I'm saying everybody okay now let's go back my friend among my friend on verse two and he say unto them when ye pray amen say Our Father which our way in heaven let's stop ready and see how far we can go Jesus say when you are approaching God In Prayer everybody okay tell him our father that's right everybody okay call him our father everybody okay our word means two people everybody okay everybody okay when you are coming to him call him our father don't tell him amen crazy everybody okay everybody okay amen everybody okay so before you kneel down and you start praying cool down a little bit everybody okay remember who you are [Applause] everybody okay remember first of Who You Are remember your position [Music] because when the Holy Spirit come in your life the Holy Spirit make you call Jesus Abba Father everybody okay everybody okay because we according to what we went already we with Jesus Christ we are jointed yes everybody okay so you cannot go before God yourself uh-huh you must go with your hour uh-huh praise God you must go with Jesus Christ [Applause] foreign [Music] let me see if I can find it my friend glory to God Hallelujah brother Caleb found must be in his name the Bible brother Brahman said in the exposition of the seven churches is everybody okay yes sir if you want me to stop we stop praying you tell me okay mm-hmm an exposition of the seven Church ages five in the pilgrimage Church brother Branham say how do we pray we pray in Jesus name don't we you find that can you read with me we pray in which name Jesus name don't we every prayer in his water or there is not any water answer if you want your prayer to be prayed he must be praying in the name of who Jesus whatever you do in word or did you do it in the name of who Jesus right here so when you are approaching him remember I'm a joint head Our Father it is not only the father of Jesus Christ we went through that God bless you also just like he brought Jesus Christ as much as Jesus have a right to God we also have a right to God let this man that was in who Christ be also have you our father that's why if you notice the prayer of Jesus Christ Jesus always say father watching the scripture father I know that you hear me my father my father why have Thou forsaken me Father the hour have come glorify that name when you talk talk like Jesus everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay so when you are approaching God remember who you're approaching I'm saying this for a reason okay if you are a sister and you want to ask brother Robert a favor do you know how you ask a favor do you know how you talk to brother Robert okay you will come you say brother Robert can I talk to you a minute and brother brother and you go inside you say butter up and you have to check your your measurement your social distance and everything do you know why because of your relationship with brother Robin everybody okay but if it's sister Laurel she doesn't have any social distance [Music] we buy the rabbit when she approaches brother Robert she can put her hand on top of brother Robert and say hey honey I'm hungry when she speak she doesn't talk like you [Applause] she knows who she's talking to when you are approaching God you must know who you thought praise God together [Music] you're not approaching somebody else you are approaching your God your father your creator amen your husband [Music] how do you approach your husband [Music] Our Father when you talk to him tell him our father when you say that he understands amen because you have to approach the right way [Music] everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay God Wants You to Know Who You Are [Music] God wants you to approach him with confidence I will get to that if time permits let's go my friend everybody clear with our father yes sir you see how we repeat this Our Father which I and we don't even understand everybody okay everybody okay that's why when you upset slow down amen chapter verse two and he said unto them when ye pray say what Our Father which away in heaven Lord help me to get to this Our Father reach our way in heaven what is wrong with this statement why in heaven amen amen why in heaven amen now you're going to understand the prayer now when God created man in the Garden of Eden amen God and man has no restriction everybody okay in other words there was nothing between God and man in the garden of him that's right amen Adam and God could talk anytime everybody okay there was perfect harmony perfect Fellowship perfect communion everybody okay everybody good when men sin in the Garden of Eden God kicked men out from the Garden of Eden everybody okay so when man left the Garden of Eden everybody okay man left from the presence of God [Applause] amen everybody okay that's right so from Eden there was a separation everybody okay that was established between God and Men everybody okay one begin to feel like he's far away everybody okay one begin to see God as somebody who's far away everybody okay and him he's far away and he the god that used to be around that used to come down in the evening become unreachable it looks like it takes a lot for you to get a hold of that God everybody okay everybody okay and Jesus said when you pray everybody okay you say Our Father which our way in heaven it is a difference between that father and your father [Music] in other words you are not talking to your heavenly father you are talking to your father which is somewhere everybody okay let's go to the Book of Job first and now I can see if I can stop job 23. and then we Define to you prayer but I believe you're getting that already let's go to Job chapter 23. Lord help me if you dare you can say Amen job is in trouble job is talking Job chapter 23 if you dare you can say amen amen first one then Job answer and say even today is my complaint how better must choke his water heavier than my water grown in his situation is very bad okay watch job in verse 3. oh data knew where am I water find him so job is going to a situation in his life that is heavier than him it is too much on him he lost his family he loves his children he loves his business he lost everything and matter of fact the people that were supposed to come and uh and and comfort him are the one putting him down so job is heavy now job begin to wish something he said if Amma found him that I might come even to his Waters see job is saying if I can only find where God lives if you look in another translation I want to go where he lived and knock at his house and say please open me let's talk a little bit why am I going through this but it looks like a job doesn't know where God is he looks like God is somewhere and job is wishing that if I can only get to that spot if I can only go to his Palace everybody okay because as long as Esther stay in her Palace there won't be no solution as they must move from her Palace to the king Palace in order to find a solution for her people Esther's Palace is the Earth the king of hazardous Palace is heaven how do you leave the Earth and go into heaven which airplane do you take which ticket do you take which passport do you take which road do you take which Highway do you use to reach heaven which Bridge do you use to go to the other side everybody okay verse 4. I would order my cause before him and fill my mouth with water arguments I will know the word which he answered me which he would answer me and understand what he will say unto me in other words if I can find his place I will go down I have a lot of things to tell him I will talk I will make my argument I will make my point look at what I did you told me to be this how was this the people were suffering I helped them why a man like this and job say watch job let me read it again please so you understand prayer I want you to get the key let's go to verse four job say number one I must find where he is and I would knock at his door so I can enter there when you enter there when you find him look at what job is saying okay verse 4 I will order my water before him and fill my mouth with water remember the lawyer right when you approach him you must approach him like a what lawyer so job say as soon as I get into his presence okay I will tell him my problem and I will make my point with supporting detail I will bring proof why do I need what I need everybody okay job didn't stop there watch what job say so prayer is a back and forth amen amen are you following me are you following me oh God help me I understand what he will say and Twitter me so prayer is not going talking stand up and go out I know that's a hard exercise for all of us everybody okay job is describing the formula formula one find where God is when you get to where God is and they open the door for you when you enter plead your cause but don't go out until you hear him do you follow me tell you what you what is is responsible can I have few minutes if not we will continue to pray pray pray oh Jesus amen and then we go out and we look at the clock five hours I pray five hours what did God say what did God say in five hours father help me you there I'm going to read the message communion prayer is back and forth in other word prayer is communion [Music] prayer is communion oh God you have to understand these things so you know now how to pray brother Branham in the message communion he says communion is to talk and he talks back job told us something that you talk to the very word commune means to talk to or be associated with something that is talking back to you is God a love yes sir is God a human being the man Jesus Christ so God can talk God can even write he wrote down when he was on Earth he wrote on the wall of uh Babylon or Babylon amen brother brought them say go to paragraph 30. he say but I have wondered many times if that word we use is just right communion communion means to talk to see to commune with I wonder if really when we meet together like this in Heavenly places if that is not communion that we are communing with God talking to him listen to this 31 and then if we just sit still can you put that on the board so everybody says it [Music] because we pray many of us pray like Pentecostal yeah out teach us how to pray then if we could just do water sit still and let him do water commune 31. and let him answer back probably it's not that one that's 45 it should be paragraph 31. amen you go into the one further that was 48 go back again the one back they all come right there 31. you there he said if we just sit still and let him answer us back many thing and the one of the water horrible things who does that do I try to do all the water talking brother Kalima miss you my friend and not sit still how long enough for him to do water answer me back we do that so many times in water so when you pray you must also eat better to hear from somebody that's right [Music] welcome to the supernatural world if your religion was just like this today you need to start hearing from God that's right you will know the voice of God you will know God God will begin to talk in your life 25 years have you heard God talking in your life you don't even know how God talk I think we will get off of our heart what is in a job and express ourselves to the Lord Jesus job and then just kneel and just be how steal a water wow just see what he would what say back to us sometime I have did that and my whole opinion was changed you see I go ask him something now Lord these people really they got something I believe they want me over there and I just pray start praying and the first thing you know I'm just satisfied that it's the Lord will so brother Brandon pray Lord these people want me to do and when brother stop you say ah it's the Lord's will and he begin to go but look where the burner before he goes he stopped a little bit to hear back from God what is God saying brother Branham say but after I pray I just do it linger a little while then it is well changed all together sometimes sent somewhere else just commune with the Lord oh how glorious Fellowship if you're too quick that's why you continue to do what you already have in mind you already purpose in your mind you're gonna go there and you go pray five minutes you wake up and you go yeah that's what you have in your mind what does God have for you prayer is going back and forth that's right prayer is a firm call from Earth everybody okay and a phone call from Heaven it is you talking and you stop for God to talk back that's right everybody okay amen everybody okay go to 49 on the next one then I'm gonna get the definition brother Branham say there is where many times that we make a great mistake we do all the talking and don't wait and give him a chance to do what to answer that we got sometimes say Lord I would that you do so and so and so and so amen and get up and leave now that is not that is not communion that is going and asking a water a favor but when you stay how long enough until he does water answers so the life of prayer is not about you talking [Applause] you are staying two hours maybe you talk 45 minutes the other hours is you keeping quiet so you can hear him to say something that's right our life is if somebody say I pray two hours it means from starting to finish every second he was the only one talking teach us how to pray but when you stay long enough until he hears her back that is when you get to what communion communing with who the Lord now a great way to commune is to be have agree you must agree upon what certain things job was looking for something where is God where does God live if I found him I will get inside I will talk to him and then I'm gonna hear what he says back to me how do we find the address of God [Music] God is in heaven how do you enter Heaven [Applause] how do you get to heaven amen which Bridge do you use which airplane do you use which ticket do you use which Highway do you use what is prayer and probably we slow down here because it's getting someone everybody okay in the message that knoweth all things it says definition you there in paragraph 17 I want you to follow me carefully brother Branham say see what prayer does I want you to bring it my friend because I don't want you to hang on my word amen we are on earth we're trying to communicate with water jobs say there is one thing I need get me into his house when I get into the presence of the king he will ask me like King Esther like a Queen Esther what do you need what is bringing you here what is going on here Queenie tell me amen then you tell him what you want and he can cancel whatever he was trying to do he say I'm coming to your banquet right now amen but you must leave your place to go into his place how do you leave your place to go into his place we know now he live in heaven Jesus said when you pray you say Our Father which are in heaven we know where he is how do I get to heaven Amen in heaven why because there is a separation you there all right let's go see what prayer does help me my brother prayer is not exactly what bringing God down to man that's what we usually think I'm praying I'm praying I'm praying and God is coming down brother Branham say prayer is not bringing God down God will come down as a result of Prayer I have heard the Cry of my people and I have come down to deliver them but before I come down the people were crying they were praying then I heard their prayer and I came down in other words somebody calls someone and say I need help and that person left whatever they were doing and went to rescue everybody okay brother Branham say prayer is not exactly bringing God down to me it is bringing water man how up to God said show me his place Jesus said when you pray say Our Father which are in what heaven Jesus already gave you the destination My Father which is not in Gastonia not in Africa not in America he is in a specific place which is called heaven and brother Branham explained to us that heaven is not far away brother Brahman say heaven is where here only in the water another dimension in other words Heaven is here but the problem is the connection brother Branham say heaven is not far far away Heaven is here that's right but we are just Out Of Tune we are out of the presence of God we are out of connection amen that's why we don't feel him brother Branham say prayer what is prayer prayer is a way to take you to heaven to take you to the place job was looking for because once you enter Heaven that's it when we say heaven I'm not talking about when you enter Heaven you begin to see the cloud prayer it's bringing man how up to God listen carefully I don't know I need to stop somewhere see as you do water right you do water you lose sight of water these Earthly things brother Branham say when you start praying amen before you start praying you are worrying about your children yeah maybe you came from work whatever happened at work is in your mind everybody okay you were driving on the highway you saw maybe Food Lion you saw people there you were on the phone talking so your mind is so crowded and you are in full contact with the Earth the heaven seems to be far away now brother Branham said before you pray everybody okay you need to start first leaving the Earth [Music] in other words as you are entering in prayer what happened and work need to go what you saw in the highway need to go that's right amen everybody okay you are already changing dimension oh God let's go my brain as you pray you lose sight of this water Earthly thing that's the reason why men pray with their eyes closed normally you can pray with your eyes open the reason we close our eyes is to shut us out from what is surrounding us right amen amen when I'm here I have a puppet I have brother a polycarp I have the microphone I'm trying to forget all of this and to begin to think about one person this man that is on the picture that's right [Applause] Cannot drop something that's the reason why brother Kalima brother Branham have a tendency to pray before the picture of half man [Applause] because brother Branham wanna keep his focus on who he's going to talk to amen I am not talking to the pastor I'm talking to the man that look like this Offman picture [Applause] then I'm closing my eyes so I forget who's beside me [Music] and as you begin to Lose Yourself Amen in other words as you begin to detach from your surrendering that's when you are entering Heaven amen and the way to do it is by praying prayer is the vehicle that take you in the presence of God [Applause] we all are rebuked by this everybody okay everybody okay that's why before we pray amen we have a tendency to sing all we're trying to do is to get us out of what we wear are you trying to do is to detach from what was going on in the house so you can focus so the children can focus so everybody can begin to focus like okay okay okay now now now we are talking to to God we need to sit well we need to fix our skirt we need to to dress how we are because if you don't you're not conscious of that amen you can begin to pray you don't know how you pray but when you begin to know that I'm approaching God you will see a sister pulling because you are detaching you are now approaching somewhere let's go my brother and we can stop as you pray you lose sight of this water everything you sway out somewhere else way behind Beyond and water on and on and on until you become into water this present that's what job was looking for amen everybody okay then a fifth that you have laid it out before who God say now hear God here it is in other words you cannot ask until you get there amen brother Stephen if I need to get there how do I get there without asking because we get in our prayer in five seconds we start asking did you get into his presence did you get into his presence brother Branham say before you ask first you need to lose everything amen and you need to enter first into his presence once you enter in his presence then you begin to ask amen that's the reason why help me brother Robert Jesus say our father who are in water heaven go ahead again Hallowed be thy name did you see Jesus asking no sir it's later that Jesus said give us our daily bread oh that's right are you with me Jesus never said Our Father which is heaven give us Our Father which away in heaven Hallowed be thy water what are you doing by hallowby amazing glorifying you are worshiping him first so when you stop prayer you need to start praying by worship that's right and worship is taking you into his presence that's right once you fill his presence around you that's when you begin to talk teach us how to pray let's go my friend sorry about Robert as you pray you lose no now on the blue color now here God here it is I want to get well for this cause I want you to do this for me and this course I want you to hear me from this cancer or TB or anemia condition or whatever it is I will walk before you I will do everything I can I will give this testimony Everywhere I Go all of this are teaching right there is linking if you notice what Abraham is giving uh I mean a request with a reason why a request with a reason why jobs say I will give it with argument everybody okay he said I will be happy to do that law I will use my life not for myself I will use it for your glory to help other to see you do you see the prayer this prayer you talk only when you are in presence that's why Jesus said Our Father which are aware the water Hallowed be thy name Hallowed be thy name you see two three words in the prayer of Jesus what he means look what we were doing let me read this quote and then we wind up we stop somewhere here you there next my friend where you say definition the next one follow me carefully and I close this We Understand Job Supernatural brother Branham says this God never come for just any haphazard way is not perhaps please are you reading with me yes sir prayer is the water is talking to God watch brother Branham prayer is not okay get done shut your eyes and thinking about your washing all your work you are doing say Lord help me and John heal Mrs John and so forth that is not a prayer that is water repeating some words that's why we don't go nowhere when you are to praying you are thinking about something else in other words you are like this but your mind is somewhere when the Pastor said let's pray you are still thinking about the dishwasher at home brother Branham say your word is just repeating it's a formality because we want the one who's standing here to do the praying not us and and matter of fact we are listening to his prayer to make sure he is God in every request everybody okay everybody okay brother Branham said that is not prayer that is repeating some word listen now but prayer follow me carefully please I'm closing but prayer is what to come into water an atmosphere where you realize that you are in the water the presence of God and you are moving to them in house the deepest of sincerity first it is a worship [Music] uh-huh first it is water oh Jehovah I love you you see them after the water worship prayer then you come with us and see heart doing what you cannot ask without worshiping amen because the mother prayer say our father who are in water heaven Hallowed be that name that Kingdom I will get that that way I can't guess in that Kingdom Come amen I can't get in that Kingdom Come that will be another day because we need to know what does it mean our kingdom come because it's a mother prayer what do you keep today teach us how to pray ER is your vehicle everywhere that will take you from this Dimension to the heaven the heaven we're talking about it's not a heaven over there in the solar system that's the second heaven which is the solar system the first Heaven is the sky the third is what we're talking about amen and brother Branham said the third heaven is here but it's just in the fastest Dimension amen but the reason why you lose connection is because of your body your five senses are contacting the Earth all the time everybody okay when you're driving on your when you are walking in your house you see a spot there you need to clean this oh there is no sugar no that that's that's automatically the five senses that's the word you are in amen that's why we are the connection but God is worthy so now prayer is what take you from this Atmos for this Cosmos for the activities of the day and take you out until you drive in your car your subconscious knows that you're going somewhere that your mind is not in your car and someone will tell you did you see brother John over there brother John just pass us because your mind is somewhere you won't have an accident because your subconscious already memorized the exit to work you know how to leave my house to go to brother Mickey's House your subconscious will take you there you don't need a GPS you don't need a GPS to come to church how many people here use the GPS to come to church but how many times do you come to church and you talking on the phone how are you driving getting to your destination and you're talking on the phone is the talking of the phone I mean uh stopping your driving that's how prayer is until you can pass every stop sign and you don't see whatever is there somebody else will be looking like look at Mcdonough look at Chick-fil-A look at this but if you are under into a different world you will realize that you map passive and McDonald don't see McDonald because you are detached from the world and the only way to get detached is the prayer how do you detach from prayer you need to start getting into the atmosphere you need to create an atmosphere of prayer that's why you don't pray when you're upset you are praying when there is an atmosphere that's why we sing before we pray because we're trying to do what create an atmosphere that's why we stop the TV before we pray because we want to do water that's why we stop the telephone before we pray because we're trying to do water creating Atmos that's why we stop everything and everything is quiet in the house and every child is sitting in their place before we start the water and when the atmosphere is set our father which are in water Heaven before you start saying bless mommy bless this one bless this one in other words you start worshiping first Lord I thank you because you have been so good to me Lord You Are My Creator father you the mercy God the merciful god you're the one that died for me at the Cavalry Lord how much I love you how much I miss you when you're doing that you are automatically God of Adam said first worship when you are doing that you are moving from the things of the world you are detaching from this environment and you are entering into a different environment that job was looking for and when you enter in that environment that's when you need to plead your case and not only pleading your case you need to wait for him to tell you what do you think about the case Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name that's where we stop let's bow ahead time is up foreign you heard we could continue doing what we do and still don't get nowhere sometime he works sometime he doesn't work amen you heard what God spoke to you you heard what he says time is gone but for few minutes amen as you close in your head your eyes you bow in your head forget about who is beside you forget about what is going on at home forget about everything amen begin to talk to him and let's thank him and let's worship Him and we talked to him a few minutes and we can go home put a lot of volume on the music just the music a little bit I know now many of you don't want to speak loud it's because of something that we will learn later but if you know who you're going to see you forget about what is going on brother give them some music so they can speak to their King and we can all talk to our King and I'm looking at I'm going to watch the time and we will go home I got need in my life you got needed in your life so don't wait for me pray for your need pray for your life pray for your
