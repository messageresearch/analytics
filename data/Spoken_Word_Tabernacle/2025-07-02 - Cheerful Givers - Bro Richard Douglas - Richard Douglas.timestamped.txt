[0:00] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[0:03] could do or think. Is it wonderful? Now,
[0:06] tomorrow morning is breakfast. And I
[0:09] asked Brother Parker if I was to speak
[0:12] at that breakfast. And
[0:16] trying to get away from it, but he said
[0:18] no. And I was supposed to say a few
[0:20] words. And then tomorrow night, I want
[0:24] to try, the Lord willing, to preach,
[0:27] bring a little message. And I don't
[0:30] think I'll try again like last night
[0:32] because I felt real bad sitting here
[0:35] before teachers and renowned teachers
[0:38] who knows theologians like Dr. Lee Vale
[0:42] and all these other brethren here who I
[0:43] know my graduates and so forth and
[0:47] studied the Bible and trained in that
[0:49] and each senior try to bring a message
[0:51] of that type. I thought I'd come to pray
[0:53] for brother Parker's sick children. So I
[0:57] better stay on that line. So we are here
[0:59] to help. Now tonight I
[1:03] I want to try to speak and read some
[1:06] scripture so that it won't take me too
[1:08] long about 30 minutes or something. Then
[1:11] I want to pray for you sick people
[1:12] tonight. Just believe. Now anybody knows
[1:18] that human beings can't do these things.
[1:21] It's impossible. See and it's got to be
[1:24] the spirit of God. Amen. And so we the
[1:27] only thing we can do is pray for the
[1:29] sick, I can't heal anyone because you're
[1:33] already healed. Amen. If anybody tells
[1:35] you that they can heal you, that's
[1:37] wrong. See, if anybody tells you they
[1:39] can save you, that's wrong. You're all
[1:41] saved anyhow. See, you only thing you
[1:44] have to is just accept it. You accept
[1:46] what Jesus did for you. He was wounded
[1:49] for your transgressions with his
[1:50] stripes. You were

[5:44] Praise God.
[5:46] Amen and amen. Can we be upstanding
[5:49] tonight?
[5:50] Even as we commit the service into the
[5:53] hands of the Lord and ask that the Lord
[5:55] himself take preeminence tonight, can we
[5:58] all bow down our heads and in one spirit
[6:02] let us ask the Lord to take
[6:03] prereeminence. Father in the name of

[45:34] let's give him a big clap offering.
[45:39] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[45:42] Amen. Glory to God. Glory to God. Glory
[45:46] to God. Everybody happy.
[45:48] Wow. What a traffic today for some
[45:50] reason. But by God's grace, we made it
[45:52] to church. Amen. Amen. Full of energy.
[45:57] Ready for the word. Amen. The devil is
[46:01] completely unveiled.
[46:04] Now you know the turn of the flesh,
[46:05] right? Amen. That's why we take pleasure
[46:09] in what? In persecution. We take
[46:11] pleasure in whatever is going on. We are
[46:15] still rejoicing. If you're still sad in
[46:18] the midst of trial, you need to go back
[46:20] and listen to the song to the service
[46:22] again. Amen. No matter what's going on,
[46:25] God is there to heal you. Amen. But this
[46:29] world is full of trouble. A man born of
[46:32] a woman, full of trouble. Amen. We will
[46:35] have persecution but know one thing that
[46:38] I have overcome the world. Amen.
[46:43] Normally we should want him to remove
[46:45] the tribulation.
[46:47] But he says I'm aware of the
[46:48] tribulation. I know you're going to have
[46:51] tribulation. I know you will have it.
[46:53] But just know one thing. In other words,
[46:55] remember one thing that even though
[46:57] you're going through trial, I have
[46:59] overcome the word. In other words, there
[47:01] is no trial we can go through that the
[47:03] Lord did not overcome. You know,
[47:06] everything that we going through was
[47:08] packaged into the atonement. The
[47:10] atonement have everything packaging. The
[47:13] point is we just they have to believe
[47:15] the atonement and take our eyes off the
[47:18] symptom and the trouble and look at the
[47:20] cross and keep confessing. Everything
[47:23] will be all right because all things
[47:25] work together for what? Amen.
[47:30] Brother Brandham say even tension is a
[47:32] blessing.
[47:34] Yes sir. You want the quote again?
[47:38] Yes sir. Do you want the quote again?
[47:41] Even tension it's a blessing. Even the
[47:44] book the open book when you eat it it's
[47:46] sweet but when you begin to get to the
[47:49] gut it becomes bitter. But when it's
[47:52] bitter it's meaning that you are
[47:54] digesting the things correctly. Amen. So
[47:57] your trial has been measured. Yes sir.
[48:00] Predestinated
[48:02] and then they have been prepared and
[48:04] ordained for you. Amen. So you can take
[48:07] it because the scripture say you cannot
[48:10] have any anything higher than what you
[48:12] can handle. Amen. So whether it's a
[48:15] sickness, whether it's a thorn in the
[48:17] flesh, all of that, God is using
[48:19] everything to put it together. In other
[48:21] words, Paul, brother Brandham say when
[48:23] he told me he was do not fear. Brother
[48:25] Brandham said from there on he just keep
[48:28] moving and don't mind the devil that was
[48:30] following brother Brandham all the time
[48:32] that demon brother Brandham say when I
[48:34] go into every nation you remember the
[48:36] quote he said when I go he's there but
[48:38] after a while the the Holy Spirit always
[48:41] overcome him and then guess what what
[48:43] follow after that many souls are saved
[48:46] so it think so when you going to do
[48:48] something good and you feel the devil is
[48:50] there that's why Paul say whenever you
[48:52] want to do something evil is there amen
[48:54] And it's always there. When it's there,
[48:56] you know, okay, I'm doing something that
[48:58] is really bothering uh bothering him.
[49:00] Amen. God have everything under control.
[49:04] Amen. Amen. Glory to God. So stay
[49:08] focused. Everything is okay. Don't mind
[49:11] the throne of the flesh. It's going to
[49:14] be there. It is for your blessing. And
[49:16] if you want the power of God to rest on
[49:19] you,
[49:21] don't mind that thing over there. Just
[49:23] know it's there. Amen. God is using that
[49:26] brother Brandham say to soften you, to
[49:28] humble you, to to bring you down, to
[49:31] make you remember who is the boss. If
[49:35] not, you go, you say everything is all
[49:36] right in my life. Nothing goes on. Say,
[49:41] look up. I am your portion. Amen. It's
[49:46] not by might nor by power, but it is by
[49:48] the Holy Spirit. Amen. So you keep
[49:51] remembering brother Chris and sister
[49:52] Rebecca and the family in prayer. The
[49:55] the funeral is scheduled for this uh
[49:58] weekend. Uh it's in uh Tennessee in
[50:02] Tennessee in Chattanooga if I'm not
[50:05] mistaken. Yeah, it's in Tennessee. And
[50:07] then the viewing will be tomorrow on
[50:09] Thursday. So remember the family in
[50:11] prayer. If you can make it, no problem.
[50:13] Uh you need the address. We got all the
[50:15] information. But most of all, they need
[50:18] your prayer. especially brother Chris
[50:20] mother need your prayer. Amen. And
[50:22] another great news that I have is
[50:25] somebody yesterday gave me $3,000 for
[50:30] the building fund.
[50:37] Amen.
[50:38] Amen. Just came in envelope. So brother
[50:41] set I have it there after service you
[50:44] see me and I hand it quickly to the
[50:47] trustees and then you give it to the
[50:49] treasurer and we trying to get things
[50:52] paid off quickly because we've been
[50:53] using our card and moving with the card.
[50:56] Now we need to bring the card down. So
[50:58] everything is working together for good.
[51:01] You know that song praising you know you
[51:03] should do. Everything is working
[51:06] together for good. So don't worry about
[51:08] it. Just keep praying. Everything is
[51:10] there. And also in other news, should I
[51:12] say it? Yeah. The trusty want you to
[51:14] know.
[51:16] The city finally installed the tap up
[51:19] there.
[51:27] See what God is doing. Was it Monday or
[51:29] Tuesday? We had another inspection,
[51:32] electrical inspection. We passed again.
[51:35] You see?
[51:37] So a whole lot to do but who is this
[51:40] great mountain before Zerobel it shall
[51:43] became a plane. Amen. So pray pray pray
[51:46] and every step of the time we will
[51:48] continue to move by God's grace. God is
[51:51] doing great thing. If you look at the
[51:53] way God is beating the price down it is
[51:55] just a miracle because we could not even
[51:57] afford it. But somebody will come with
[52:00] this and then another person will come
[52:01] with something. Usually if somebody
[52:03] tells you 10,000 and this one tell you
[52:05] 8,000, it's a little bit closer. But
[52:07] that's not what we have. If you hear
[52:09] somebody 10,000, the next one might come
[52:11] with 3,000.
[52:13] This is what God is doing in this
[52:15] church. Somebody will come with 22 and
[52:17] the next one comes with uh 5,000.
[52:20] Another one say 14 and this one come
[52:22] with four 4,600. It's And I begin to
[52:26] learn, brother Robert, how to build my
[52:28] own house.
[52:29] [Laughter]
[52:32] Amen. Because you can spend so much
[52:34] money
[52:36] if God doesn't help you. You will spend
[52:38] a lot of money into things that if you
[52:40] go slowly with the Lord, you will cut
[52:42] down a lot of price and have we're not
[52:45] getting cheap stuff. It is correct
[52:47] expensive stuff. But it's just the grace
[52:49] of God with God. I don't even know how
[52:51] to explain it. It is just the grace of
[52:53] the Lord. So if you somebody who they
[52:55] say 5,000 boom this this you'll find
[52:57] yourself a million dollars up there. So
[52:59] keep praying, keep remembering brother
[53:02] set and then uh everything will be all
[53:06] right by God's grace. Amen. A lot of
[53:09] prayer because we bidding sometime
[53:10] against evil spirit and you can sense
[53:12] that this is the devil trying to block
[53:15] something here out of nowhere. Blockage
[53:17] blockage then finally it comes up. So
[53:19] prayer prayer prayer prayer. We know
[53:21] that the one who started the work will
[53:23] finish it himself. It is not our work.
[53:26] It is the work of the Lord. So
[53:27] everything is working together for good.
[53:30] So we greet you all in the precious name
[53:32] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[53:34] above visible and invisible audience.
[53:37] Any family member here, God richly bless
[53:40] you. I believe everybody. Sister Regina,
[53:42] good to see you. And if you see Sister
[53:44] Regina, you know who is preaching

[54:01] preaching for our convention tonight.
[54:03] Amen. Our Wednesdays are not regular
[54:05] service. So I'm a Wednesday at
[54:07] convention. So I don't preach. I let
[54:09] somebody else preach. So welcome to the
[54:11] convention. We say amen. Let's pull on

[57:44] with confidence knowing that Jesus is
[57:46] here? Amen. Ain't you glad we know he's
[57:49] here because we bring him with us. The
[57:52] scripture says that every and the
[57:54] prophet taught us this too. said, "Every
[57:56] time two or three are gathered in his
[57:58] name, he's in the midst." Amen. Ain't
[58:01] that ain't we thankful for that? We got
[58:04] so much to thank him for, so much to
[58:06] praise him for, so much to worship him
[58:08] for. We just want to give back to him
[58:11] what he's given to us. Amen. We want to
[58:14] do it with a cheerful heart. Amen. Amen.
[58:19] Would you turn with me? I want to greet
[58:21] y'all in the name of our Lord and Savior
[58:23] Jesus Christ, Brother Josh. Since his
[58:25] blessings and his love to each and every
[58:27] one of you. And you know, we're just at
[58:31] home. So, I'm part of the family. So,
[58:34] not not an odd man. I'm just part of the
[58:37] family. You don't have to worry. God
[58:40] will come. Amen. God will do whatever he
[58:43] wants to do. I'm just here. Whatever you
[58:46] need tonight, though, I believe God, if
[58:48] you'll operate that gift, God will give
[58:51] you just what you need.
[58:53] I don't have no doubt about that. I
[58:56] don't have to stumble and worry about
[58:57] that because he said, Brother Brand
[58:59] said, "You operate the gift." God don't
[59:02] need my notes. He don't need my
[59:04] thoughts. What he needs you to do is to
[59:07] pull on the word. Amen. And I know you
[59:10] will because I know you how much y'all
[59:11] love the Lord and love the word. Amen.
[59:15] Turn with me to second Corinthians
[59:17] chapter nine. Yes, sir. Amen. And just
[59:20] got a little thought tonight.
[59:24] God loves a cheerful giver.
[59:32] [Music]
[59:34] That's what he loves.
[59:37] Don't love one that don't.
[59:40] If you love him, you'll be a cheerful
[59:41] giver. That's right. Amen. Cheerful.
[59:45] Yes, sir. Amen. and full of cheer and
[59:47] happiness and glad to do those things to
[59:51] edify the house of God and to edify the
[59:54] word of God and and to bless one another
[59:56] with. Listen what Paul begins to take
[59:59] begins to speak to us. Let's start at
[1:00:01] verse six here in chap 2 Corinthians
[1:00:03] chapter nine. Yes sir. Listen to this.
[1:00:06] But this I say, he which sweth sparingly
[1:00:11] shall also
[1:00:13] sparingly
[1:00:15] shall reap also sparingly. That's right.
[1:00:18] And he which sawth bountifully shall
[1:00:22] also shall reap also bountifully. That's
[1:00:25] right. every man according to his
[1:00:27] purpose in his heart.
[1:00:30] So let him give not grudgingly
[1:00:34] or of necessity
[1:00:37] for the for God loveth a cheerful giver.
[1:00:43] Let's pray. Praise God. Father God, in
[1:00:46] the name of Jesus, the son of the living
[1:00:49] God, Lord, Father, Lord, we've come here
[1:00:51] to give my gift to you, Lord, that you
[1:00:54] might come and operate this gift for
[1:00:56] your children, Lord. Father, that you
[1:00:58] might set your children's hearts on
[1:01:00] fire, Lord. Father, they've come to give
[1:01:03] you praise, honor, and glory. So,
[1:01:06] Father, it's a it's a it's a position
[1:01:09] that we have as believers to give
[1:01:12] because you give. We are givers, too,
[1:01:14] because we are your sons and daughters.
[1:01:17] So, Father, come now and give your Holy
[1:01:21] Spirit, Lord. Father, I pray you'd move
[1:01:23] in such a way, God, that it wouldn't be
[1:01:25] the be a words of a man, but it'd be the
[1:01:28] words of God speaking through a man.
[1:01:30] Father, I give you myself, Lord. Father,
[1:01:33] that you might be edified in this
[1:01:35] service tonight that you might take
[1:01:37] preeminence and take complete control of
[1:01:39] this service. Lord, touch our sister now
[1:01:41] in Jesus name. Amen and amen. You may be
[1:01:45] seated. I love how Paul begins to tell
[1:01:48] begins to talk to us about this as he
[1:01:51] begins to tell he's talking to believers
[1:01:54] now. He's not talking to unbelievers.
[1:01:57] Paul is addressing believers. Amen. He
[1:02:00] said, "But this I say, he which seweth
[1:02:03] sparingly, That's right. shall reap also
[1:02:06] sparingly." Yes, sir. And he which
[1:02:09] seweth bountifully shall reap also
[1:02:12] bountifully. Amen. It says every man as
[1:02:15] he purposed in his heart. See, there has
[1:02:17] to be a purpose. There has to be
[1:02:19] something in there that has made you
[1:02:22] cheerful to want to give back because
[1:02:25] we've received so much from God that we
[1:02:29] are to be a cheerful giver back to him.
[1:02:31] We are to be so thankful that God has
[1:02:33] given you this sanctuary that you might
[1:02:36] come and express your love and worship
[1:02:39] to Jesus Christ. That's what we're here
[1:02:42] for because we are cheerful children.
[1:02:46] We're not sorrowful children. We're not.
[1:02:50] We don't have those things. No, sir. We
[1:02:52] are happy to be Christians.
[1:02:55] God has called me and you with a
[1:02:57] purpose. He has predestinated us. He has
[1:03:00] elected us. He gave that we might give.
[1:03:04] He said, "Freely I give unto you. Freely
[1:03:07] you give unto others." And if you want
[1:03:10] to get somewhere with God, you must be a
[1:03:13] cheerful giver. That's what's wrong
[1:03:16] around the world is too much taking and
[1:03:19] not enough giving.
[1:03:22] Whatever we need to do to God is to
[1:03:24] fellowship him and be thankful and give
[1:03:27] him our praise, give him our worship,
[1:03:31] give him our time.
[1:03:34] But I think sometimes we get so caught
[1:03:36] up we forget to be thankful and give
[1:03:39] back to him. Just like Nebuchadnezzar.
[1:03:42] Remember he made that mistake over there
[1:03:45] in Daniel chapter 3. He become
[1:03:48] unthankful.
[1:03:50] He began to think this is my kingdom. I
[1:03:53] have done this. He forgot to be cheerful
[1:03:56] that God had given him this kingdom. God
[1:03:58] had set him over this. God had done
[1:04:01] this. But then when he began to exalt
[1:04:03] himself, then God gave him the heart of
[1:04:06] a beast.
[1:04:08] Brother, that's what's wrong with this
[1:04:09] world. They forgot to give God praise
[1:04:12] for everything. This nation was formed
[1:04:15] on Christianity, but they have failed to
[1:04:18] give back the cheer and the glory back
[1:04:21] to God.
[1:04:25] And he, brother Brandon said, when you
[1:04:27] don't give cheer to God, he said, then
[1:04:31] God will give you a heart of a beast.
[1:04:33] He'll give you the heart of the world.
[1:04:35] And brothers and sisters, I believe if
[1:04:37] we really love God like we should, we
[1:04:39] need to get off of those cell phones and
[1:04:42] quit looking at them more than we do
[1:04:44] praying.
[1:04:46] If you love God, you'll show him you
[1:04:48] love him.
[1:04:51] We getting such so caught up in the
[1:04:54] things of this world that traps us. Why
[1:04:58] do you think they call it a worldwide
[1:05:00] web?
[1:05:02] To trap you. To trap your mind, to show
[1:05:06] you all the bad things, to take away the
[1:05:09] joy in your heart, to take away the
[1:05:12] spirit of God in your life.
[1:05:16] Glory be to God.
[1:05:18] Hallelujah.
[1:05:20] That's where we fail. We fail to edify
[1:05:23] God through cheer.
[1:05:26] Cheer means to be happy, to be thankful,
[1:05:30] to be gracious.
[1:05:34] What about that? Paul said, but they
[1:05:38] knew God, but they glorified him not as
[1:05:41] God, brothers and sisters. We see a lot
[1:05:43] of that around the message. They know
[1:05:46] God, but they don't glorify him as God.
[1:05:50] So, they can't worship him in spirit and
[1:05:52] in truth. That's right. And the Bible
[1:05:55] said, "And they became unthankful."
[1:05:57] That's right. And with unthankfulness
[1:06:00] come a dark heart. A heart full of
[1:06:03] sadness. A heart full of Oh my goodness.
[1:06:07] A heart full of amnesia.
[1:06:10] Forgetting where you come from. That's
[1:06:12] right. You wouldn't be here today if God
[1:06:13] wouldn't give you breath in your body.
[1:06:16] [Music]
[1:06:18] You're to thank him this tonight that he
[1:06:20] woke you up this morning in your right
[1:06:21] mind.
[1:06:24] with a world full of oh my a world full
[1:06:27] of neurotic
[1:06:30] see in the house of God he expects us to
[1:06:34] be thankful
[1:06:36] he expects that of us
[1:06:39] he wants us to be cheerful
[1:06:42] not just I'm not here to preach on
[1:06:43] tithes and offer but you should be
[1:06:45] cheerful when you give you should be
[1:06:47] givers
[1:06:48] [Applause]
[1:06:50] if you ain't a giver then you you've not
[1:06:52] got a revelation of who God is. The
[1:06:55] Bible tells me, "For God so loved the
[1:06:57] world that he gave his only begotten son
[1:07:02] that people like me and you might be
[1:07:04] saved."
[1:07:08] Glory. Hallelujah. The problem is is
[1:07:11] people are not cheerful hearers of the
[1:07:14] word no more.
[1:07:16] Nor are they cheerful doers of the word.
[1:07:19] Therefore, they cannot come in the house
[1:07:21] of God with a cheerful heart.
[1:07:25] Happy are we if we know these things. We
[1:07:28] should be happy. We shouldn't be sad.
[1:07:32] No, sir. We got so much to be thankful
[1:07:36] for.
[1:07:37] So much.
[1:07:40] You know what? There's many, many forms
[1:07:43] of being cheerful, being a cheerful
[1:07:44] giver. Not just in your in your money
[1:07:47] and your tithes. I mean, God, I don't
[1:07:49] know where I'm going to go with this,
[1:07:50] Brother Steve, but I'm going to go
[1:07:52] anyway. I'm going to jump in there
[1:07:53] anyway. God only asked you for 10%.
[1:08:00] 10% 10%.
[1:08:03] He could ask for 90 and be just
[1:08:06] [Applause]
[1:08:09] We act like it's such a hard thing to
[1:08:11] give.
[1:08:13] Huh? 10%.
[1:08:17] God. That's where we get in trouble. We
[1:08:19] grumble and complain about giving. You
[1:08:21] hear people, they'll say, "Well, I don't
[1:08:23] want to give that man my money." You
[1:08:25] don't have a revelation.
[1:08:27] You're not giving your tithes to Brother
[1:08:28] Steven. You're giving your tithes to
[1:08:31] Jesus Christ.
[1:08:36] I don't know why people have such a
[1:08:37] trouble with that,
[1:08:39] a trouble in giving. When he said,
[1:08:41] "Freely I give to you, freely you give
[1:08:44] to others.
[1:08:49] Hallelujah.
[1:08:52] Do you know what? Even even sons and
[1:08:54] daughters of God have to be willing to
[1:08:56] be a cheerful giver in the way they
[1:08:58] approach God. Yes, sir.
[1:09:02] Do you know we're brother Brand said,
[1:09:04] when you're living your life for others,
[1:09:06] can I say it like this? When you give
[1:09:08] your life for others, you're staring
[1:09:11] heaven in the face. Our problem is we're
[1:09:14] giving our life for our own
[1:09:15] self-edification
[1:09:18] or our own ministry. That's right. When
[1:09:20] we should be giving it for God to bring
[1:09:23] glory to God, not to man. God didn't
[1:09:26] send a man a message to glorify man. God
[1:09:29] sent a message to glorify himself.
[1:09:36] Yes, my brother. That's true. We will be
[1:09:38] instructed with these things. He gave
[1:09:41] gifts. Can we turn over to the scripture
[1:09:42] and be patient with me? Take your time.
[1:09:44] Amen. We always get in such a hurry.
[1:09:47] Hold the preacher. He time's running
[1:09:49] out. Oh my goodness. We got to go. We
[1:09:51] got to go.
[1:09:53] I wonder if Jesus thought that way
[1:09:54] toward us.
[1:09:56] What if he had thought that way toward
[1:09:58] us?
[1:09:59] Huh? I just don't have time for them.
[1:10:04] I I've got just a little bit. I've got
[1:10:06] three and a half years here.
[1:10:09] Think about it.
[1:10:11] But he wasn't worried about that. He was
[1:10:13] willing to give his time that we might
[1:10:15] receive time. Now, what are we going to
[1:10:18] do without our time? The Bible says,
[1:10:20] "Redeeming the time for the days are
[1:10:22] short."
[1:10:25] Glory be to God. Turn with me over to 1
[1:10:28] Corinthians chapter 12. Yes, my brother.
[1:10:32] Verse 25 through. And look at these
[1:10:34] gifts he gave these. Now listen, listen
[1:10:37] to what he says here. Yes, my brother.
[1:10:40] He says,
[1:10:43] look at what he I just want to start
[1:10:44] right here at 25. Will that be all
[1:10:46] right? Yes, sir. He said that there
[1:10:48] should be no shism in the body,
[1:10:52] no contention, no jealousy,
[1:10:56] no malice, don't you know when God
[1:10:58] blesses one of your brothers or one of
[1:11:00] your sisters, he's blessing you?
[1:11:03] We got so many people being jealous
[1:11:05] about certain ministers or ministry or
[1:11:08] God blessing somebody else. If you had a
[1:11:10] revelation, you'd know when God blesses
[1:11:13] them, he's blessing you because you're
[1:11:16] part of the body. When the stomach
[1:11:18] receives food, sir, it supplies the
[1:11:22] whole body.
[1:11:24] Hallelujah. No shism in the body. But
[1:11:29] the members should have the same care
[1:11:31] for one another.
[1:11:34] That's a gift. Cheerful. Same care. You
[1:11:37] should wear it. We should We should love
[1:11:38] one another. We should care about one
[1:11:41] another. That's it. Listen to this. And
[1:11:44] whether one member suffer, that's right.
[1:11:46] All the members suffer. Wait a minute.
[1:11:48] That brother, he deserved that.
[1:11:51] Oh, really? Really? Oh my. Then you go
[1:11:55] tell God, "Give me what you what I
[1:11:57] deserve." God, he'll say hell. Uhhuh.
[1:12:00] That's right. You want what you deserve.
[1:12:02] That's right. Brothers and sisters, the
[1:12:04] grace of God has stopped us from going
[1:12:07] to hell.
[1:12:10] And even we get so bold sometimes. God,
[1:12:12] you owe me this. God don't owe you
[1:12:15] nothing. That's right. You owe him
[1:12:17] everything.
[1:12:19] Amen. You're indebted to him to your
[1:12:22] love. That's right. Yes, my brother.
[1:12:26] Listen to this. One by one member
[1:12:28] suffers. Yes, sir. He said all the
[1:12:31] members suffer. He said or one member be
[1:12:35] honored. Oh my I just don't like the way
[1:12:39] my goodness that that I'm going to
[1:12:41] preach now. That preacher, I'm telling
[1:12:43] you, they sure give him a lot more honor
[1:12:45] than they do me. Praise God.
[1:12:50] I'm not here to be honored by man.
[1:12:53] Hey, if there be any honor, let God give
[1:12:56] the honor. Let God give the glory. Let
[1:13:00] God lift us up.
[1:13:04] Hallelujah. Listen to this.
[1:13:07] What? Hey, watch. The power of God is so
[1:13:10] beautiful.
[1:13:11] Amen. Be cheer. And again, I say
[1:13:15] rejoice.
[1:13:19] Give honor.
[1:13:21] All the members rejoice with it with it.
[1:13:25] Not against it. That's what Satan That's
[1:13:28] what got him in trouble. That's right.
[1:13:30] When he was in heaven and that God was
[1:13:32] getting the glory and the honor and the
[1:13:34] praise, Satan did not give honor.
[1:13:38] So he had to be cast out because
[1:13:41] jealousy, iniquity was found in his
[1:13:43] heart.
[1:13:45] Amen. Let me tell you what there. None
[1:13:47] of us are no good.
[1:13:49] We want to come with a prideful heart
[1:13:51] and say, "God, you owe me.
[1:13:54] He owes you nothing.
[1:13:56] We owe him everything." Brother Brown
[1:13:58] said, "He can put you away anytime he
[1:14:00] wants to.
[1:14:02] Anytime he wants to, let's don't get so
[1:14:04] spiritually swole up that we think we
[1:14:07] can't fall." That's what happened to
[1:14:08] Nebuchadnezzar.
[1:14:10] Yeah.
[1:14:12] And God, you know, the prophet when he
[1:14:13] bring that vision and he began to tell
[1:14:16] him the interpretation of vision, the
[1:14:17] the interpretation told him said, "If
[1:14:19] you won't do these things, this thing
[1:14:20] won't happen." But the Bible said he got
[1:14:23] lifted up in his heart, right? And he
[1:14:26] said, "Look what I've done. Look at
[1:14:28] this. Look at what I've done." We see it
[1:14:29] all the time. When a man starts saying,
[1:14:32] "Look what I did."
[1:14:34] That's a red light to me. I'm saying,
[1:14:37] "Wait a minute." Yes, sir. The only
[1:14:39] reason we do anything is because the
[1:14:41] grace of God.
[1:14:43] [Applause]
[1:14:48] Amen. He said
[1:14:51] now ye are the body of Christ. Uhhuh.
[1:14:55] And members in in particular. Yes sir.
[1:14:59] He said and God has set forth in the
[1:15:03] church. Yes sir. First apostles,
[1:15:07] secondary prophets, thirdly teachers,
[1:15:11] right? And after the miracles and the
[1:15:13] gifts of healings and helps and
[1:15:14] governments and diversities of gifts,
[1:15:17] are all apostles?
[1:15:19] Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are
[1:15:23] all workers of miracles? Have all the
[1:15:27] gifts of healing? Do all speak with
[1:15:30] tongues?
[1:15:31] But look at what he said. He said, "Cove
[1:15:34] earnestly the best gifts, right? And yet
[1:15:38] I show unto you a more excellent way.
[1:15:43] I show you how to love." Let's go right
[1:15:45] to jump to 13 right here. Listen,
[1:15:48] listen to this. He said, "Though I speak
[1:15:50] with tongues of men and angels and have
[1:15:53] not charity, I am become a sounding
[1:15:56] brass or a tinkling symbol." Right. He
[1:16:00] said, "And though I have the gift of
[1:16:01] prophecy
[1:16:03] and understand all mysteries,
[1:16:06] people just think, well, oh, well, I
[1:16:07] know God sent a prophet." That's not it.
[1:16:10] He's told telling you, "You better have
[1:16:12] the love of God in your heart."
[1:16:15] He said, "And have all knowledge, though
[1:16:19] I have faith so that I could remove
[1:16:21] mountains and have not charity, I am
[1:16:25] nothing." That's right.
[1:16:27] Nothing without the love of God. Amen.
[1:16:29] The love of God is God's gift to me and
[1:16:31] you.
[1:16:33] Yes, sir. Right out of the heart of God,
[1:16:35] brother Brown said, "Walk Jesus Christ."
[1:16:37] Satan had never seen God expressed
[1:16:40] through love.
[1:16:42] Hallelujah. Amen. That's why he gave.
[1:16:45] Amen. That's what that's how that he
[1:16:47] said, you'll know that you're my
[1:16:48] disciples, that you have love one for
[1:16:50] another, that you care for one another,
[1:16:53] that you listen at this. He said, ' And
[1:16:56] though I bestow all my goods to feed the
[1:17:00] poor, "Though I give my body to be
[1:17:03] burned and have not charity, it profit
[1:17:06] me nothing." Right? If you preach and
[1:17:09] you don't have the love of God in your
[1:17:11] heart for the people, you're nothing.
[1:17:14] You're unprofitable servant. Brother
[1:17:17] says, "There's three things that a
[1:17:18] preacher must have. Faith, hope, and
[1:17:20] charity in every ministry." That's
[1:17:22] right. Faith for all things, hope for
[1:17:24] the people, and love for all.
[1:17:28] Hallelujah.
[1:17:30] Listen. He said, "Oh my." Here we go.
[1:17:33] Yes, sir. He said, "Charity sufferth
[1:17:35] long and is kind." Well, me kind. Why
[1:17:40] should I be kind? That brother ain't
[1:17:41] never done that for me. Praise God.
[1:17:44] You're not here for that brother to do
[1:17:46] something for you. When you going to
[1:17:48] understand servitude?
[1:17:51] When you going to give?
[1:17:53] Give till it hurts.
[1:17:55] [Applause]
[1:17:58] A sacrifice without any any kind of
[1:18:00] effort with it is no good. God won't
[1:18:02] accept it.
[1:18:04] It has to have effort. Something you
[1:18:05] have to Oh my.
[1:18:08] Give.
[1:18:10] And he'll get back unto you. Hallelujah.
[1:18:12] What more does he give us than eternal
[1:18:14] life?
[1:18:15] Hallelujah. Lord, listen to this. Thank
[1:18:19] you, Lord.
[1:18:21] Charity envth not.
[1:18:24] Charity is cheerful.
[1:18:26] Love's a cheerful giver.
[1:18:28] Yes, Lord. We got to understand that the
[1:18:31] love of God is cheerful.
[1:18:34] Look at all the Indian and all that
[1:18:37] among the brothers and sisters.
[1:18:39] I wish that was brother Stephen.
[1:18:42] You know what? God showed me something
[1:18:43] about that about that. You know what? If
[1:18:46] I was Brother Steven, then God wouldn't
[1:18:48] need Brother Steven.
[1:18:50] Because God don't need two, brother
[1:18:51] Stevens. God needs one, brother Stevens.
[1:18:55] And so I would rather God not need me
[1:18:58] than not need him. That's the way you
[1:19:00] have to do it. That's the way we must do
[1:19:03] it. Say, God, I'm willing to step. What
[1:19:05] it is is people have, you know what,
[1:19:07] people have lost their ability
[1:19:10] to be charity
[1:19:13] with a cheerful heart, to be happy.
[1:19:16] Amen. We're I've never seen so many
[1:19:18] Christian walk around so sad.
[1:19:21] This is the greatest hour.
[1:19:23] I'm like, what are you sad about?
[1:19:26] I'm fixing to get a new body.
[1:19:29] I'm fixing to get out of here. Why
[1:19:32] should we be sad?
[1:19:34] Why have you lost your countenance?
[1:19:37] Huh? I like what Paul said. He said,
[1:19:39] "You did run well." Uhhuh. What's
[1:19:42] hindering us? Uh-huh. What about when
[1:19:43] God first got a hold of you in your
[1:19:45] life? That's right. And you were so
[1:19:47] charitable. You was willing to do
[1:19:48] anything for God. Hallelujah. But we sat
[1:19:51] around on our stools all this time and
[1:19:54] got to where we didn't want to do
[1:19:55] nothing anymore. We want God to do
[1:19:58] everything and we do nothing.
[1:20:03] God loves a cheerful giver.
[1:20:06] Anything you do, you better be happy
[1:20:08] doing it. Yes, sir. You say, "Well, I
[1:20:10] give my tithe. I give this. If it makes
[1:20:12] you sad, then you ain't give nothing.
[1:20:17] I'm glad that God has given me the
[1:20:19] ability to have something to give.
[1:20:24] Jesus died and gave something to you so
[1:20:27] you could give something back.
[1:20:33] [Music]
[1:20:36] Listen to this. Hallelujah. Envi not.
[1:20:39] Uhhuh. Charity vineth not itself. That's
[1:20:41] right. Is not puffed up. That's right.
[1:20:44] Brother Brown said he preached the word
[1:20:45] and he said the people was so like a
[1:20:49] toad eating butt shop.
[1:20:53] Yes, sir. Your attitude tells me whether
[1:20:55] you're a cheerful giver or not.
[1:20:59] And you don't leave. You don't give
[1:21:01] expecting to get back.
[1:21:03] [Applause]
[1:21:08] Yes, sir. Everybody wants I'll give if I
[1:21:11] get something out of it. That's this
[1:21:13] world's attitude. But you forget you're
[1:21:16] not of this world.
[1:21:21] You're no longer your own. You've been
[1:21:24] bought with a price.
[1:21:26] Yes, sir. People are so so reluctant
[1:21:30] to give Amen. obedience to God.
[1:21:35] That's why we see so many people who
[1:21:37] profess to be message believers and
[1:21:40] they're not because they was not willing
[1:21:42] to obey the word.
[1:21:45] They are message believers in their mind
[1:21:48] but not in their heart.
[1:21:51] Huh? Then why? If you are in your heart,
[1:21:53] then why do you complain about the
[1:21:55] things in the me? Oh, you can't do this,
[1:21:58] brother Steve. I can't go there. I can't
[1:22:01] do this. I can't do I can't wear this. I
[1:22:04] can't wear that.
[1:22:06] That's not a cheerful heart.
[1:22:09] I'm glad he asked me to do something and
[1:22:11] I'm willing to do it.
[1:22:15] He said his commandments are not
[1:22:18] grievious.
[1:22:21] I've never thought of it being that way.
[1:22:24] If you if you do, then you've got the
[1:22:26] wrong spirit.
[1:22:30] It's we ought to be thankful that he
[1:22:31] calls us sons and daughters and he's
[1:22:33] willing. He's got confidence in you to
[1:22:36] ask you to do something and you do it
[1:22:37] willingly. I love what brother Brown
[1:22:39] said about Enoch. He said he walked with
[1:22:41] God, talked with God, he said, but he
[1:22:45] never disputed with him about his word.
[1:22:47] Hallelujah.
[1:22:48] We got so many people fighting over this
[1:22:50] and fighting over that, promoting their
[1:22:53] own ministries and promoting one
[1:22:55] another.
[1:22:58] If you ain't promoting Jesus Christ, you
[1:23:01] made a major mistake. The Bible said,
[1:23:03] "If I be lifted up,
[1:23:06] not a man," that's what this message
[1:23:09] did. It lifted up Jesus Christ.
[1:23:13] Ain't you thankful for that? Listen to
[1:23:15] this.
[1:23:17] He said, "Do not behave itself
[1:23:20] unseemingly,
[1:23:22] saketh not her own, is not easily
[1:23:25] provoked,
[1:23:27] thinkketh no evil." Well, man, you just
[1:23:30] don't know. You just don't know how that
[1:23:32] brother, that sister treated me. So,
[1:23:35] what's wrong with that?
[1:23:38] Huh? That's what's wrong. That's what's
[1:23:40] wrong with us. Huh? You know why they
[1:23:43] did that? Cuz God allowed them to do
[1:23:45] that. That's
[1:23:47] remember when they come to brother Bram
[1:23:49] and said, "Brother Bram, didn't you hear
[1:23:50] what that man said about you?" He said,
[1:23:52] "Oh, brother, that was ordained before
[1:23:53] the foundation of the world.
[1:23:56] You need it." What people need to do is
[1:23:57] go back and listen to what the prophet
[1:23:59] said.
[1:24:02] Huh? A reaction to an action.
[1:24:06] Remember, this life is an action. It's
[1:24:09] according to how you react to it. Huh?
[1:24:11] Did Job react the wrong way? I admire
[1:24:14] Job. Here's a man that didn't then had
[1:24:17] the Holy Ghost in it like we do. Here's
[1:24:19] a man in a They come to him and told all
[1:24:21] these things happened to him, Brother
[1:24:22] John. And the Bible said he did not
[1:24:24] accuse God falsely.
[1:24:27] Do you know what he did in that time?
[1:24:29] That's where we get in trouble. In your
[1:24:31] troubles, in your trials, you fail to
[1:24:35] thank God.
[1:24:37] Because he had confidence in you. That's
[1:24:40] why he put you through those things.
[1:24:43] It said he fell on his face and he said,
[1:24:46] "The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh.
[1:24:49] Blessed be the name of the Lord."
[1:24:54] We're awful happy when it's being given.
[1:24:57] But when it's taken is when we show who
[1:24:58] we really are. Do you know even your own
[1:25:01] kids are not your own?
[1:25:04] They're only God that God give you to be
[1:25:06] stewards over them.
[1:25:09] I am I am such a blessed man.
[1:25:12] to have been under the fifth gospel
[1:25:16] where my mother taught me about Jesus.
[1:25:22] Sisters, we better teach our children.
[1:25:24] If you don't teach them, somebody will.
[1:25:27] That's right. That's right.
[1:25:31] If you don't love them, somebody else
[1:25:33] will.
[1:25:36] If you don't lead them, somebody else
[1:25:38] will. That's right.
[1:25:40] And we lead by example.
[1:25:45] Listen to this. Yes, sir. Does not mis
[1:25:48] does not behave itself unseemingly.
[1:25:51] Brother Steve, you just don't know. You
[1:25:53] just don't know what I'm going through.
[1:25:55] Maybe I don't.
[1:25:57] I bet you don't know what Jesus went
[1:25:59] through to save you, do you?
[1:26:02] You've not been through that. I've never
[1:26:03] seen none of us in here get beat with a
[1:26:05] whip. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I've never seen
[1:26:08] one of us put on a cross.
[1:26:10] I've never seen one of us get pierced
[1:26:12] with a spear in the sun. But he did all
[1:26:15] of that. Amen. He was such a giving God
[1:26:19] that even when he in his in his flesh,
[1:26:21] he had these beautiful powerful words.
[1:26:24] Amen. He said, "If it be your will,
[1:26:26] Father, Yes, sir. then let this cup
[1:26:29] pass." But nevertheless,
[1:26:31] that's the way we are to pray through
[1:26:32] our trials and our tribulations.
[1:26:36] If it be glory to God, if it be your
[1:26:40] will, God,
[1:26:42] if it be your will to take this off of
[1:26:44] me, then do it. But if you don't, God,
[1:26:47] I'm going to praise you anyway.
[1:26:51] [Applause]
[1:26:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:27:02] It's how you act. It's your attitude.
[1:27:06] It's your behavior in the trial. My
[1:27:09] brother, did did Abraham dispute God
[1:27:12] when he said, "Give me Isaac." You know
[1:27:16] what? He didn't even have a scripture.
[1:27:18] Never had nowhere in the Bible where God
[1:27:21] ever required the offering of a human
[1:27:23] body.
[1:27:25] [Applause]
[1:27:28] But he was testing him if he was going
[1:27:31] to be cheerful through the trial,
[1:27:34] if he was going to give.
[1:27:38] That's why we don't get to Amen. like
[1:27:40] brother Brown preached. We possess the
[1:27:43] gate of the enemy after the trial.
[1:27:46] After the trial.
[1:27:49] That's it. Because you have to do the
[1:27:50] same thing that Abraham did. Amen. He
[1:27:54] willingly took his son even though he
[1:27:56] knows. Yes, sir. He had a revelation
[1:27:58] that had God, he knew that if God had
[1:28:01] given his son as one from the dead, he
[1:28:04] was more than able to raise him from the
[1:28:07] dead. Amen. And I like how that says
[1:28:09] over here in the scripture, it says,
[1:28:11] "Now that I see Abraham that you was
[1:28:13] willing,
[1:28:15] not you was cheerfully going to give him
[1:28:18] to me cuz you was willing to give me
[1:28:21] your son.
[1:28:23] Then I can bless you after the trial. I
[1:28:27] say now you love me. That's what God is
[1:28:31] trying to us. We're Don't Everybody's in
[1:28:33] in under trials. Everybody's under
[1:28:35] attack right now. That's right. That's
[1:28:37] right. It's your attitude while you're
[1:28:39] going through it.
[1:28:41] Yes, sir. Whether you're cheerful or you
[1:28:43] ain't cheerful.
[1:28:45] He didn't say there wouldn't be no
[1:28:46] afflictions.
[1:28:48] He said, "Many
[1:28:50] are the afflictions of the righteous."
[1:28:52] But there's a word there that connects
[1:28:55] to a promise. But I am sir, the Lord thy
[1:28:59] God that deliverth them out of them all.
[1:29:05] Hallelujah. Amen. Glory be to God.
[1:29:10] Listen,
[1:29:12] not misbehave itself unseemly, seeketh
[1:29:15] not a wrong. Oh, brother, we ought to
[1:29:18] listen to this now. Huh? We're not here
[1:29:20] to seek our own.
[1:29:22] We're here to seek his will.
[1:29:25] Oh, glory be to God. Is not easily
[1:29:28] provoked. That's right.
[1:29:31] Boy, we can preach there for a while.
[1:29:34] We seem like everything provokes
[1:29:36] everybody.
[1:29:38] Everybody thinks everybody's against
[1:29:40] everybody.
[1:29:42] And the only one that's against them is
[1:29:44] Satan, and they don't realize it.
[1:29:47] That's right.
[1:29:50] How foolish we are. That's right. That's
[1:29:53] right. How foolish we are. That's right.
[1:29:57] Oh my.
[1:29:59] Ain't you thankful for the grace of God?
[1:30:02] Think no evil. Amen.
[1:30:05] If you got evil thoughts in your mind,
[1:30:07] you need to pray.
[1:30:11] And I better be glad. I hear people say,
[1:30:13] "Better be glad I'm a Christian. I'd
[1:30:16] give you a piece of my mind. I said,
[1:30:18] "Brother, don't waste your time. You
[1:30:19] ain't got none
[1:30:23] because the Bible tells me, let this
[1:30:25] mind, not that mind. Let this mind be in
[1:30:31] you which was also in Christ."
[1:30:37] If you got the mind of Christ, you know
[1:30:39] what? I love what the prophet told us
[1:30:42] about Jesus. He said he walked
[1:30:44] unconscious to criticism.
[1:30:46] Boy, somebody criticizes us. Oh, bless
[1:30:48] God. I I'm going to shake that man's
[1:30:50] hand. He ought to treat me better than
[1:30:52] that. Really?
[1:30:54] You know how I break that? When I feel
[1:30:55] that spirit coming on me, Brother
[1:30:56] Robert, if I think I've said something
[1:30:58] to you and there's contention or some
[1:31:00] kind of sh between me and you, well,
[1:31:02] there'd be none there at all. I'm going
[1:31:04] to go to brother Robert and say,
[1:31:05] "Brother Robert, will you forgive me?
[1:31:08] Have I said anything to you? Have I done
[1:31:10] anything?
[1:31:12] to bring separation between me and you.
[1:31:15] Have I done anything to break the
[1:31:17] brotherhood we have in Christ?
[1:31:20] But people are too proud to say they're
[1:31:22] sorry.
[1:31:26] And we know pride cometh before a fall.
[1:31:29] That's right. Listen to this. Says,
[1:31:32] "Rejoiceth not in iniquity,
[1:31:35] but rejoicth in the truth." That's
[1:31:37] exactly right. Amen. With the truth we
[1:31:40] have, we're to be so happy, Brother
[1:31:42] Kelly.
[1:31:44] So thankful. What he's given us. Yes, my
[1:31:47] brother. He's given me and you a ticket
[1:31:49] out of here. That's right.
[1:31:53] Hallelujah. Ain't you thankful for that?
[1:31:57] He said he gave these things to us. What
[1:32:00] did he say? He said he gave Brother said
[1:32:02] he gave the five-fold ministry. Yes,
[1:32:04] sir. For the perfecting of the saints.
[1:32:05] That's right. That's the ministry. Not a
[1:32:07] man. That's a gift. Yes, sir. Not a man.
[1:32:11] A man's a man, but a gift's a gift.
[1:32:14] And that gift is to dress the bride with
[1:32:17] the word. Not with your ideas,
[1:32:20] not with your doctrine, not with your
[1:32:23] revelation. I can see right now, you're
[1:32:25] not a unic.
[1:32:27] If you preach any other gospel than
[1:32:29] what's already being preached, right? We
[1:32:32] have no seat to sow.
[1:32:35] All we do is water the seed that's
[1:32:37] already been sown. We had a message that
[1:32:39] swed the seed. The spoken word is the
[1:32:42] original seed.
[1:32:44] And we're recipients of seeing that
[1:32:46] spoken a word being made alive in this
[1:32:49] hour. Amen. Listen to what? Let's look
[1:32:52] at the rich young ruler just for a
[1:32:54] minute.
[1:32:56] I had never I never really looked at
[1:32:58] giving this way, brother Stephen. I
[1:33:00] never really looked at him in this way.
[1:33:01] But you know what his failure was?
[1:33:03] Right? He failed to give.
[1:33:07] Huh? Do you know your eternal life can
[1:33:10] hinge on your giving?
[1:33:13] But he sold it out because he was
[1:33:16] unwilling to give. That's right. He
[1:33:19] said, "I've done." He had the testimony.
[1:33:22] I've kept every commandment. I've done
[1:33:24] all these things. He said, "But thou
[1:33:26] lackest
[1:33:27] one thing.
[1:33:30] Sell all you have and give to the poor
[1:33:33] and pick up your cross and follow Jesus.
[1:33:38] Think about that. And the and the key to
[1:33:40] it is is God made him rich.
[1:33:46] God made him rich or he'd never be rich.
[1:33:49] The Bible said he sets them up. He tears
[1:33:51] them down.
[1:33:55] But he was Oh, glory be to God. I'm
[1:33:56] gonna preach right now. is unwilling to
[1:33:59] give back what God gave him.
[1:34:02] That's what's wrong with a lot of
[1:34:04] people. They're unwilling to give back
[1:34:06] what God has given them.
[1:34:09] [Applause]
[1:34:12] Listening listening in Hosea 10:12.
[1:34:16] It says, "Sow yourselves in
[1:34:18] righteousness, reap in mercy. break up
[1:34:23] your father ground for it is time to
[1:34:26] seek the Lord till he come and reign
[1:34:30] righteousness
[1:34:31] upon you.
[1:34:33] Ain't you glad God sent a message?
[1:34:36] Amen. That they would be the five-fold
[1:34:39] ministry would come and under the
[1:34:42] anointing of God when we're not
[1:34:43] producing like we should, brother John.
[1:34:46] But the preaching of the word is tearing
[1:34:48] up the fall ground. When we become cold
[1:34:50] and indifferent and hard, somebody God
[1:34:54] sends somebody to tear up that ground
[1:34:57] that it might receive the water of the
[1:35:00] word.
[1:35:02] When the ground is hard, it won't
[1:35:03] receive the water. It just runs off of
[1:35:05] it, right? But it has to be tore up. Oh
[1:35:09] my. I like what the prophet said. He
[1:35:11] said, "You got to be willing to be
[1:35:13] broken so you can be made over."
[1:35:19] And be cheerful in the breaking.
[1:35:22] God help us. God help us. He said, "Hey,
[1:35:27] Jeremiah said, I'm going down to the
[1:35:30] potter's house." That's right. to be
[1:35:32] broken that I might be made over. You
[1:35:35] know what he was going down to be
[1:35:36] broken? His will, his desire, his
[1:35:39] ambitions. Well, brother Steve, you
[1:35:41] don't understand. I I I got to go. I'm
[1:35:43] going to college. I got things to do.
[1:35:46] Seek ye first the kingdom of God.
[1:35:49] There's nothing wrong with going to
[1:35:50] college. Nothing wrong with education.
[1:35:53] But if you put that before God, God's
[1:35:55] going to have to break your hollow
[1:35:57] ground, your fow ground. Uh-huh.
[1:36:00] Ain't you glad that the there was a
[1:36:02] servant Yes, sir. that when a church
[1:36:04] ain't blooming and the church ain't
[1:36:06] ain't going where it should be and the
[1:36:08] master come and told him said, "Let's
[1:36:10] just cut the tree down." He said, "Will
[1:36:13] you give me one more year?"
[1:36:15] One more year. How many years does God
[1:36:18] give us?
[1:36:23] And we're still unthankful for the mercy
[1:36:25] of God.
[1:36:26] We still sit in our own opinions and our
[1:36:29] own ideas
[1:36:31] by the leadership of our own spirit.
[1:36:36] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank God for
[1:36:38] men that preach this message. Thank God.
[1:36:41] Amen. Break up the fall ground means do
[1:36:45] not sow your seed among the thorns.
[1:36:50] Break off all the evil habits. clear
[1:36:53] from your heart the weeds of doubt and
[1:36:55] unbelief and all those things. Break
[1:36:58] them away.
[1:37:00] Don't be don't be angry when he's he's
[1:37:04] pruning us.
[1:37:07] The pruning is not easy.
[1:37:10] But he's taking off that because that
[1:37:12] limb is taking the life out of your
[1:37:14] reproduction. That's right.
[1:37:17] That li that old limb is sucking the
[1:37:20] life Yes, sir. out of you. Yes sir. That
[1:37:23] old doubt, that old unbelief, that old
[1:37:25] malice, that old anger,
[1:37:28] sucking the very life out of you,
[1:37:31] don't but despise the chastening of the
[1:37:34] Lord.
[1:37:35] So he rebukes and chasen those who he
[1:37:37] loves.
[1:37:40] Can we turn over to Let's just see here.
[1:37:44] Patient be patient with me now.
[1:37:47] Let's turn over to Matthew. Can we 13? I
[1:37:50] love the scriptures.
[1:37:52] I would know nothing about the
[1:37:53] scriptures. God hadn't sent a prophet.
[1:37:56] Don't fool yourself. I've seen men pick
[1:37:58] up the Bible and do nothing with it.
[1:38:03] Just because you carry a Bible don't
[1:38:04] mean you're a Bible.
[1:38:06] Paul said, "You're written epistles read
[1:38:08] of all men."
[1:38:10] I like what brother Brown said. He said,
[1:38:11] "Don't just preach me a sermon. Live me
[1:38:13] one." I want some living sermons. Don't
[1:38:15] you? I've never I'd never desired,
[1:38:18] Brother Steven, to be the best preacher.
[1:38:19] You know what? I've always desired to be
[1:38:20] the best Christian. That's it. Then that
[1:38:23] means that then when you get that way,
[1:38:24] you have no competitive spirit in you.
[1:38:30] [Applause]
[1:38:37] Hallelujah. We realize it's not a
[1:38:38] competition.
[1:38:42] Listen what Jesus said in Matthew 13. He
[1:38:45] said, "Blessed are your eyes for they
[1:38:47] see and your hearts for they hear." Yes,
[1:38:49] sir. For verily, verily, I say unto you,
[1:38:51] many prophets and righteous men have
[1:38:53] desired to see those things which you
[1:38:55] see and have not seen them. Think about
[1:38:59] that. And to hear those things which you
[1:39:01] hear and have not heard them. And then
[1:39:04] he begins to tell them he's he's trying
[1:39:06] to give them understanding here because
[1:39:08] they thought, what is it? We need to
[1:39:10] understand this parable of the swer.
[1:39:13] Yes, sir. And they didn't understand
[1:39:15] because the reason they couldn't
[1:39:16] understand because they need the Holy
[1:39:17] Ghost. Yes, sir.
[1:39:19] you. I don't care who you are. You can't
[1:39:21] understand this message unless you're
[1:39:24] born again. Amen.
[1:39:27] Ain't that what he said? He said, "You
[1:39:29] must be born again." Amen. That's what's
[1:39:32] wrong. People don't have a birth.
[1:39:36] What is the message? Jesus Christ.
[1:39:38] [Music]
[1:39:40] The same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:39:43] The unchangeable God. Amen.
[1:39:47] Listen. Then he then he begins to tell
[1:39:49] then he begins to tell, "Hear ye
[1:39:51] therefore the parable of the swer."
[1:39:53] Listen what he says about these things
[1:39:54] when the ground I want to talk about
[1:39:55] that foul of ground just for a few
[1:39:56] minutes. Give me a little time tonight,
[1:39:58] will you?
[1:39:59] He said, listen to this. He said, "Hear
[1:40:02] ye therefore the parable of the swore.
[1:40:04] When any one of you heareth the word of
[1:40:06] the kingdom and understandeth not, then
[1:40:09] cometh the wicked one." See how how much
[1:40:12] we must desire revelation. Yes sir. Just
[1:40:15] not hearing revelation but understanding
[1:40:18] brother Kim revelation.
[1:40:22] He said what about that? He said the
[1:40:24] word cometh and understandeth it not.
[1:40:27] Then cometh the wicked one and catcheth
[1:40:30] it away which was sown in his heart.
[1:40:33] Right. This is he which receiveth seed
[1:40:37] by the wayside. That's right.
[1:40:41] I call it a waste side.
[1:40:47] So why do we try to understand God with
[1:40:49] our own carnal minds?
[1:40:52] Listen to this. He said, "But ye but he
[1:40:56] that receiveth the seed
[1:41:00] and unto stony grounds, the same is he
[1:41:02] that heareth the word, and a non with
[1:41:06] joy receiveth it."
[1:41:09] He hears it, but he's not cheerful. He's
[1:41:11] hearing it.
[1:41:13] He has something holding him back from
[1:41:15] receiving that seed to come to life.
[1:41:17] Brother Steven, he's holding it without
[1:41:20] a cheerful heart. He's going to say,
[1:41:22] "Yeah, and then you know what? It
[1:41:23] becomes legalism."
[1:41:27] And let me tell you, your legalism
[1:41:29] will destroy you.
[1:41:34] Amen. Then it becomes a do and a don't.
[1:41:37] Instead of a want to. They say,
[1:41:40] "Richard, why don't you do this? Why
[1:41:41] don't you do that?" I say, "Brother Ro,
[1:41:43] because I don't want to. I'm free. I can
[1:41:46] do whatever I want to. Cuz God put me on
[1:41:49] free moral agency, but I don't want to."
[1:41:52] What the problem is people don't get the
[1:41:53] want to taken out of their heart.
[1:41:56] That's why they still do. They'll say,
[1:41:58] "I'm not going to do it because I'm
[1:41:59] afraid brother Stephen or or this one
[1:42:02] will get they'll they'll say something."
[1:42:04] You ought to do it because you don't
[1:42:05] want to bring shame to God.
[1:42:08] That's exactly. We're too busy worrying
[1:42:10] about what one another what somebody
[1:42:13] else thinks about and we don't worry
[1:42:14] about what God thinks. You better be
[1:42:17] worried about what God thinks about you.
[1:42:21] Hallelujah.
[1:42:22] Listen to this.
[1:42:24] He said, "Yet
[1:42:26] hath he not root in him, in himself."
[1:42:30] But listen to this, "Dendeth for a
[1:42:33] while." For when tribulation,
[1:42:36] tribulation, huh? He didn't say it
[1:42:38] wasn't coming. But if you've not, that
[1:42:40] word has not been sown right in your
[1:42:42] heart. You've not followed the ground.
[1:42:45] When tribulation comes, you'll turn and
[1:42:48] walk away.
[1:42:51] Amen. We better be very careful.
[1:42:56] Or persecution. Oh my.
[1:42:59] Listen. He said arises because of the
[1:43:03] word
[1:43:05] by and by. He is
[1:43:09] offended.
[1:43:12] I've never seen so many people offended
[1:43:15] at the message.
[1:43:19] That's right. It's a shame. Amen.
[1:43:23] Jesus said, "If you're offended in me or
[1:43:27] my words, I'll be offended in you."
[1:43:32] But because of offenses,
[1:43:34] then we want to go the easy way. Yeah,
[1:43:36] that's this man.
[1:43:38] The easy way cannot build character in
[1:43:40] you. We fail to realize that character
[1:43:45] is not a gift. It's a victory.
[1:43:50] [Applause]
[1:43:54] But boy, I like I like this right here.
[1:43:56] Come on. He said, "But he also that
[1:43:58] receiveth seed among the thorns and
[1:44:02] heareth the word and the care of this
[1:44:05] world."
[1:44:07] You care more about looking on your
[1:44:08] phone than you do reading the Bible. You
[1:44:11] care more about talking, gossiping,
[1:44:15] complaining than you do about praying.
[1:44:18] You said, "Well, I want to get closer to
[1:44:19] God." Read your Bible and pray.
[1:44:22] I don't God don't have no penances for
[1:44:24] you. You don't have to light a hundred
[1:44:26] candles. You don't have to crawl on your
[1:44:28] knees. He said, "Read your Bible and
[1:44:31] pray."
[1:44:33] It's so simple. We say, "Oh, we we need
[1:44:35] to do something." Yeah. Obey.
[1:44:38] We need to obey.
[1:44:40] When you obey, you'll notice though that
[1:44:43] the people that pray and read their
[1:44:44] Bible, they don't have as much troubles.
[1:44:46] or when they do have troubles, they get
[1:44:48] victories.
[1:44:50] [Applause]
[1:44:55] What about that? He said in the care of
[1:44:56] this world, listen to this deceitfulness
[1:45:01] of riches.
[1:45:03] Said we're rich, increased in goods. We
[1:45:07] don't need you, Jesus. Don't you know we
[1:45:09] got the best doctors? Uhhuh. And they're
[1:45:12] dying daily.
[1:45:14] That's right. Yes sir.
[1:45:17] Because they don't they fail to go to
[1:45:19] the great position
[1:45:24] about that deceitful of riches
[1:45:28] choke the word and becometh what?
[1:45:33] You tie a rope around a around a branch,
[1:45:36] it's going to choke the life out of it.
[1:45:38] Don't you realize that Satan wants you
[1:45:40] to get Can I say it this way right here?
[1:45:43] Satan wants you to get too busy.
[1:45:46] Do you know what busy stands for? Being
[1:45:50] under Satan's yoke.
[1:45:56] But I got news. There's a there's a cure
[1:45:58] for that yoke. Said, "Come unto me, all
[1:46:01] ye that are weary and heavy laden, and
[1:46:04] I'll give you rest. For my yoke is
[1:46:08] easy."
[1:46:10] Glory be to God.
[1:46:14] He said, "But he that receiveth seed
[1:46:19] into good ground, ground that's ready,
[1:46:21] prepared." When we come tonight, we
[1:46:23] should have been praying and reading and
[1:46:25] saying, "God, whatever you say, do you
[1:46:27] know just one word from God can change
[1:46:28] your life. It's not the eloquency of a
[1:46:32] man's speech or the ability of a man,
[1:46:35] but it's speaking the word of God in it
[1:46:37] due season." That's why Amen. Amen. He
[1:46:42] said, "But he receiveth seed into the
[1:46:45] good ground. Is he that heareth the word
[1:46:48] and understandeth it, that's revelation,
[1:46:51] which also beareth fruit and bringeth
[1:46:54] forth
[1:46:56] some hund, some 60 and some 30." Yes, my
[1:47:01] brother. That's what this message come
[1:47:03] to do was for us to bring forth the
[1:47:04] fruits. Amen. Of the spirit in our life.
[1:47:07] Yes, my brother. Amen.
[1:47:11] But the problem is many times men are
[1:47:16] not rooted and grounded in love.
[1:47:20] Do you know faith workketh by love?
[1:47:27] Paul was telling us that in third in
[1:47:29] chapter 13.
[1:47:31] Let's look at this. Enticing spirits.
[1:47:34] Listen to this. He said there's a
[1:47:36] negative and a positive.
[1:47:40] No matter how much positive this current
[1:47:43] run through here, if it hasn't got a
[1:47:46] ground wire, it will never light.
[1:47:50] Unless you're rooted and grounded in
[1:47:52] Christ, you ain't going to never be able
[1:47:53] to be a light.
[1:47:56] What are you going to be? You're just
[1:47:57] going to be a bub with no light.
[1:48:04] Be Satan's decoration. Uh-huh.
[1:48:07] Uhhuh.
[1:48:10] He said, "That's right. You got to be
[1:48:12] rooted, grounded in the love of God."
[1:48:13] Oh, brother. Bring the negative and the
[1:48:16] positive together. You'll have light. He
[1:48:20] said, "The good oldfashioned gospel
[1:48:22] light is spread from shore to shore. You
[1:48:26] never have it. You'll never have it
[1:48:28] without it. No matter how much shaking,
[1:48:32] how much jumping you can do with without
[1:48:36] the positive, you've got to have the
[1:48:38] ground wire to flash the light. Ain't
[1:48:41] you glad God sent us a flashing red
[1:48:42] light of his coming?
[1:48:45] Amen.
[1:48:46] What does it mean to be a cheerful
[1:48:48] giver? Yes, sir. It means to give
[1:48:50] without obligation. Uhhuh.
[1:48:53] Uhhuh. A bank loans you money with
[1:48:56] obligation. That's right. Amen. Do you
[1:48:58] know even that little dew drop rejoices
[1:49:01] when the sun comes? Amen. Because it
[1:49:04] knows it's going back where it come
[1:49:06] from. That's right. The sun is coming
[1:49:08] this hour. So us as the dew drops of
[1:49:11] God, we ought to be rejoicing when the
[1:49:13] spirit of God is moving because that sun
[1:49:15] is drawing that dew drop off the earth
[1:49:19] back to where it come from.
[1:49:24] Oh my. That's our problem. We do things
[1:49:29] and don't understand the love of God.
[1:49:33] We do things because we think preacher's
[1:49:35] going to say something.
[1:49:39] Preacher shouldn't have to say
[1:49:40] something.
[1:49:42] God's already said something.
[1:49:45] The preacher can't go home with you and
[1:49:47] make you live, right? No, sir. All the
[1:49:49] preacher can do is tell you what God
[1:49:50] said. It's up to you to do something
[1:49:53] with it.
[1:49:54] What will you do with this one called
[1:49:56] Christ?
[1:50:00] Remember Pilate Bo and said, "Don't you
[1:50:01] not have power to take your life or give
[1:50:04] your life?"
[1:50:05] Look at him. He had the wrong approach
[1:50:07] in giving, didn't he?
[1:50:10] He didn't realize it. But the master, he
[1:50:13] said, "You'd have no power unless it
[1:50:16] been given to you." Do you realize you
[1:50:19] can do nothing without him? Amen. The
[1:50:22] the the
[1:50:24] branch is supplying is getting its
[1:50:26] source from the vine. And he said,
[1:50:30] "Without me, you can do nothing." That's
[1:50:32] right.
[1:50:35] Listen to what scripture says in Romans
[1:50:38] 5'8. But God proves his love for us in
[1:50:41] this. While we were still sinners,
[1:50:45] Christ died. Amen. He knew what you was.
[1:50:49] He knew what you was, what you was going
[1:50:51] to be, and what you're going to be. What
[1:50:54] you are, what you're going to be.
[1:50:57] He knows what he was. He knew it before.
[1:51:00] He knew it when he chose you what you'd
[1:51:01] be.
[1:51:03] It's our problem is we don't realize
[1:51:05] what we are.
[1:51:07] We're now sons and daughters of God. Not
[1:51:09] going to be. People get saying, "When I
[1:51:11] get in, when I go up to heaven, I'm
[1:51:12] going to be this. I'm going to be that."
[1:51:13] If you ain't that now, you ain't going
[1:51:14] to be there.
[1:51:17] Amen.
[1:51:18] Listen to this. Romans 8:32.
[1:51:21] He who did not spare his own son, but
[1:51:26] gave him up Yes, sir. for all of us.
[1:51:31] Are you willing to give up all for him,
[1:51:33] brother Stephen? That's where they get
[1:51:34] in trouble, brother. Your failure to
[1:51:37] give him back your all.
[1:51:41] That's just too big a price. Really?
[1:51:45] I tell you what I said. The benefits are
[1:51:47] out of this world. For obedience is
[1:51:49] better than sacrifice. What about gave
[1:51:52] him up for us all? Yes, sir. How will he
[1:51:56] also not along with him freely give all
[1:52:00] things?
[1:52:03] Give us all things. Yes, sir.
[1:52:06] Freely.
[1:52:08] He never asked you to do anything. No,
[1:52:10] sir. He asked you to obey. Amen. Really,
[1:52:13] I give to you. Amen. I know you can't be
[1:52:16] good enough to deserve this.
[1:52:19] Can I say it like this right here? Yes,
[1:52:21] sir. We get We sit in church for
[1:52:22] sometimes we sit in church so long we
[1:52:24] think we're all that.
[1:52:31] But Paul said, "I am what I am by the
[1:52:33] grace of God."
[1:52:35] Amen. And we need to realize that your
[1:52:39] goodness means nothing. Amen. I don't
[1:52:43] care how good you think you are, how
[1:52:45] wonderful you are. Brother Stephen,
[1:52:46] there's people in hell better than me
[1:52:48] and you that did more good did more good
[1:52:50] things, natural good things, but because
[1:52:54] they was not obedient.
[1:52:59] For obedience is better than sacrifice.
[1:53:03] Didn't Didn't Samuel tell Saul obedience
[1:53:06] is is the spirit of witchcraft?
[1:53:09] Glory to God. Glory to God.
[1:53:13] First John 3. Amen. Verse one says,
[1:53:16] "Behold what manner of love, Amen, the
[1:53:19] Father hath given us, that we should be
[1:53:22] called, yes, sir, children of God." And
[1:53:25] that is what we are. The reason the
[1:53:28] world does not know us is that it did
[1:53:32] not know him. Amen.
[1:53:36] Amen. Well, I just want to be
[1:53:38] recognized. Really, they didn't know who
[1:53:40] Jesus was. What makes you think you're
[1:53:42] any different?
[1:53:45] Listening the message. Look. He says,
[1:53:47] "Sometimes a little love Yes, sir.
[1:53:50] stretched out will just cure an old
[1:53:53] sore." Yes, my brother. He said, "An old
[1:53:57] placeh that's been a grudge or
[1:54:00] something, it'll heal it right over."
[1:54:02] Amen. Just a little love, a little care.
[1:54:08] You know that not even Satan himself can
[1:54:11] stand before perfect love.
[1:54:14] Souls in prison.
[1:54:17] We must love each other. Yes, sir.
[1:54:20] Greater love has no man than he that
[1:54:23] laid down his life for his enemy. Amen.
[1:54:27] That they might become his friends.
[1:54:33] Are you willing to lay your life down?
[1:54:35] Jesus did his. Amen. Or we got so such a
[1:54:40] selfish love.
[1:54:42] Just me and mine.
[1:54:45] Oh god, I hate that's what the rich
[1:54:47] young ruler thought. I can't give this
[1:54:49] up. This was my grandpa's. This was my
[1:54:52] daddy's. How why would I give this up to
[1:54:55] the poor? Cuz God asked you.
[1:54:59] You know what? You can never outgive
[1:55:01] God. Amen.
[1:55:05] Amen. Living, dying, buried, raising,
[1:55:09] and coming. I love that. He said, "Real
[1:55:12] godly love, sir. Goes after the
[1:55:14] backslider
[1:55:16] till it finds him."
[1:55:20] You don't criticize him. It goes after
[1:55:23] him. You'll never win him by your
[1:55:24] criticizing. That's right. You'll never
[1:55:26] say, "Hey, look at me. I'm so much more
[1:55:28] holier than you." You'll never win him
[1:55:30] like that,
[1:55:32] but you'll win him because you love him.
[1:55:34] That's how Jesus won you.
[1:55:37] He won you because of his love.
[1:55:41] He said, "Godly love goes and stoops
[1:55:44] down to the lowest of hell to pick up a
[1:55:47] man or a woman who has fallen."
[1:55:50] And yet we get people rejoicing in them
[1:55:54] going back out in sin.
[1:55:58] God don't rejoice in that. He said he
[1:55:59] rejoicth not in iniquity.
[1:56:02] He said that none might perish but that
[1:56:04] all might be saved. Amen. You know some
[1:56:07] gave some well God gave all.
[1:56:11] He gave us everything. Amen. In the
[1:56:14] message live same message living dying
[1:56:18] burden coming. He said living he loved
[1:56:20] me. He died for me when I was a sinner
[1:56:24] when I was unlovable.
[1:56:26] He loved me anyhow.
[1:56:30] But boy, if somebody does something
[1:56:32] against us, we just so quickly don't
[1:56:34] love them.
[1:56:36] God have mercy on us.
[1:56:40] I'm going to say it like this right
[1:56:41] here. Yes, my brother. If you can't love
[1:56:43] one who you have seen, you'll never love
[1:56:46] him who you haven't seen. And the
[1:56:48] problem is the reason we can't love one
[1:56:49] another because we don't see one another
[1:56:51] like God does. Amen. Amen. Without him
[1:56:55] in our heart, we'll never see one
[1:56:57] another like we should. And don't tell
[1:57:00] me you're going to love your enemies
[1:57:01] when you can't love one another.
[1:57:04] Brother, we better tighten up. We better
[1:57:06] get We better get our nose to the grind
[1:57:08] and get serious.
[1:57:10] If you ever been serious, you better be
[1:57:12] serious now.
[1:57:14] He said, "Listen to this. I was
[1:57:16] unlovable. He loved me." Anyhow, my
[1:57:19] prayer is for the church that we can
[1:57:21] have such love. Yes, sir. Till we love
[1:57:24] people whether they love us or not.
[1:57:26] That's what brother Steven's desire is.
[1:57:28] That's what every preacher's desire is.
[1:57:30] That's what every church desires. That
[1:57:32] we'll love people even if they don't
[1:57:34] love us.
[1:57:36] That's the true love of God. He died for
[1:57:38] that man that drove the nails in his
[1:57:40] hand. That put that crown of thorns on
[1:57:42] him. He died for him. He loved him. He
[1:57:46] loves so much, sister Sharon, that when
[1:57:47] he said, "Father, forgive them." Amen.
[1:57:51] You know, forgiveness is a given.
[1:57:56] And if you don't realize that, you'll
[1:57:58] never be able to receive the taking of
[1:58:00] it.
[1:58:02] Hallelujah.
[1:58:04] Hallelujah. Amen. He said that's what
[1:58:07] the church needs is to express a love
[1:58:10] even a man that could spit in your face
[1:58:15] and you could still with him not from a
[1:58:18] hypocritical standpoint but from your
[1:58:20] heart pray for that man's soul that the
[1:58:25] kind of revival we need. He says in Los
[1:58:29] Angeles, California, he said without
[1:58:30] that kind of love manifested, right? I'm
[1:58:33] not going to make it.
[1:58:36] God help us. Amen. Lord be saying, "God,
[1:58:38] help me." Amen. Help me to love
[1:58:42] like you love.
[1:58:45] Our problem is we can't love our
[1:58:47] neighbor as we love oursel because we
[1:58:48] don't love ourselves like God does.
[1:58:51] If we loved oursel like God did, we
[1:58:53] wouldn't listen and watch what we do.
[1:58:55] Right. Right. We wouldn't read what we
[1:58:58] read. Right. We wouldn't spend more time
[1:59:00] with that than we do with God. That's
[1:59:02] right.
[1:59:04] Because of that, that's why you can't
[1:59:06] love one another. That's right. That's
[1:59:08] exactly a man who cheerfully gives to
[1:59:11] God. Uhhuh. Has gone beyond the fleshly
[1:59:14] selfish spirit. Yes. He has gone beyond
[1:59:20] the slaveitude
[1:59:22] of the flesh.
[1:59:24] He's no longer trying to do the penences
[1:59:27] that makes him better. He's willing to
[1:59:29] surrender all to his master.
[1:59:35] Our problem is we want to be
[1:59:39] driven like cattle
[1:59:43] and we need to be led by love.
[1:59:49] A cheerful giver gives all he has to the
[1:59:53] father in love.
[1:59:57] We give everything we have to Jesus
[2:00:00] Christ. Amen. Do you know even nature is
[2:00:04] a giver.
[2:00:06] That's right. Do you know the sun gives
[2:00:09] of its light without asking you for
[2:00:11] anything?
[2:00:14] That's right. He gives to the plants
[2:00:16] that life may come without that sun
[2:00:19] giving his light.
[2:00:22] We'd all die.
[2:00:26] And you know what? That moon is so happy
[2:00:29] to receive that light. It's the lesser
[2:00:32] light, but it still gives it light. And
[2:00:35] that light, Brother Kelly, controls the
[2:00:37] waters that keep from coming in. Brother
[2:00:39] Brandon preached a message on that one
[2:00:41] time. Said, "When the moon turns its
[2:00:42] back,
[2:00:44] age come in. But when it turns back,
[2:00:49] it mushes back.
[2:00:52] That's the power you have in your life.
[2:00:54] When you turn your back
[2:00:57] on your problems, then here they come.
[2:01:00] But when you face your problems, they
[2:01:03] will go back out.
[2:01:06] Cast your bread upon the water, for it
[2:01:08] will not return to you void. Amen. Amen.
[2:01:12] Amen. You know, even the plants give
[2:01:14] back to me and you. That's right.
[2:01:18] We give them nothing.
[2:01:22] Give them place for a pull pit. We took
[2:01:25] their life to the pool pit might be
[2:01:27] here. They asked you for nothing. That's
[2:01:30] right. Without that. Yes, sir. That that
[2:01:33] tree gave this pull pit its existence.
[2:01:37] Do you realize that? Yes. Do you know
[2:01:39] the minerals of the ground give the
[2:01:41] existence for you to have a car? That's
[2:01:43] right. It's all giving. Amen. It's all
[2:01:46] given. That's why God said he loves a
[2:01:48] cheerful giver.
[2:01:50] Do you know the trees give you oxygen?
[2:01:54] That's right. They don't ask you for
[2:01:56] nothing. No, sir. Have you ever walked
[2:01:58] by a tree and said, "Hey, don't breathe
[2:01:59] no more. You're taking up my oxygen."
[2:02:02] A tree just says, "Here it is." Take it.
[2:02:05] Amen. The master gave me life, so I'm
[2:02:07] going to give you option to breathe.
[2:02:13] Everything is a giver. Amen. And man
[2:02:16] struggles so much, brother Steve, with
[2:02:18] giving. That's right. It's so hard for
[2:02:20] him to give.
[2:02:22] What a hard what a terrible thing is,
[2:02:24] man. Do you know what the the the I'm
[2:02:26] not going to take much longer. Be
[2:02:28] patient with me, though. Preach, my
[2:02:30] brother. Do you know what the animals
[2:02:32] was willing to give to the response of
[2:02:33] God when they went in the ark?
[2:02:37] He called them one time, brother
[2:02:38] Stephen. Right. And they come seven
[2:02:42] clean and two unclean.
[2:02:45] He didn't have to keep hollering.
[2:02:46] Brother John, come on, elephant.
[2:02:50] Come on, tiger. What you waiting on?
[2:02:53] Don't you know you're going to die? He
[2:02:55] said, come on in here. There's a there's
[2:02:57] safety here. Amen. And they what they
[2:03:00] did, they received their marching
[2:03:02] orders. This message gave me and you
[2:03:04] marching orders.
[2:03:07] Said, "Come unto me all you that are
[2:03:09] weary and heavy laden, I'll give you
[2:03:10] rest."
[2:03:12] Do you know what our problem is, Brother
[2:03:14] Kelly? We don't we don't understand
[2:03:16] perseverance.
[2:03:19] He said, "To him that endureth to the
[2:03:21] end shall be saved." Yes, my brother. I
[2:03:24] like where I heard a thing one time and
[2:03:26] it said, you know, even the snail
[2:03:28] persevered into the ark.
[2:03:33] He didn't give up, brother.
[2:03:35] He was the slowest one. But you know
[2:03:38] what? He responded to the call. Brother,
[2:03:44] it's not to the swift, not to the
[2:03:46] strong,
[2:03:48] but it's to them that endure to the end
[2:03:50] shall be saved. I'll read just one quote
[2:03:52] and we'll go. Appreciate you. Love you.
[2:03:56] Thank you. Appreciate you for being so
[2:03:58] kind. Hallelujah. Listen
[2:04:01] in the message of deep call to the deep
[2:04:03] as we stand. Go ahead. We can stand. He
[2:04:06] said, "And Lord, let us be today." Amen.
[2:04:10] The lightgivers
[2:04:13] of this age. Amen.
[2:04:16] And the only way you can be a
[2:04:18] lightgiver, you got to be a recipient of
[2:04:19] the light.
[2:04:22] Do you know the diamond, the diamond is
[2:04:25] the only one that can absorb and take
[2:04:28] the light in out of all the minerals
[2:04:30] with and it reflects the colors of the
[2:04:34] rainbow.
[2:04:38] That's why you're his diamond.
[2:04:41] You're his.
[2:04:43] Hallelujah. Listen to this. He said
[2:04:47] givers in this age. He says that's when
[2:04:49] the great drama is set at the end of the
[2:04:51] road and each one of us comes up before
[2:04:54] you and the great screen is pulled out
[2:04:59] and our generation lives of generation
[2:05:03] is brought back before us. God, let us
[2:05:07] hear my voice screaming against
[2:05:10] unrighteousness and calling the people
[2:05:12] to believe in thy son Jesus Christ.
[2:05:16] God, let us be that kind of light in
[2:05:19] this day. Calling people to Jesus
[2:05:21] Christ. Amen.
[2:05:26] Lightgivers are part of the main giver.
[2:05:30] They can only reflect the light and
[2:05:33] given.
[2:05:35] So if you've been given, then let your
[2:05:37] light shine. Be a giver. When man of God
[2:05:41] asks you to do something, do it. Do it
[2:05:45] cheerfully. Don't murmur and complain.
[2:05:48] Be glad that God is asking us to do
[2:05:51] something for him. Every eye, every eye
[2:05:54] closed and every head bowed. We'll say,
[2:05:57] "Lord, help me to be more of a cheerful
[2:06:00] giver.
[2:06:01] Lord, I've been a taker for a long time.
[2:06:04] Lord, I tell you one thing, Lord. I'
[2:06:06] I've taken so much off the devil. I'm
[2:06:08] tired of it. I'm willing tonight, God,
[2:06:12] to give you my whole heart, Father, that
[2:06:15] you might take prereeminence in my life
[2:06:17] that Father, I can be a cheerful giver,
[2:06:20] Father. Lord, that's what I long for,
[2:06:23] Lord. I long for you, Lord. I long for
[2:06:27] going home, Father. Father, I can feel
[2:06:30] the trembling in my soul. Lord, the
[2:06:32] light is getting stronger. And as the
[2:06:35] strength of the light affects the little
[2:06:37] dew drop, Father, it's affecting our
[2:06:40] soul, Lord. As your love gets stronger
[2:06:43] and stronger, it compels us to want to
[2:06:47] go home, Lord. Father, we're right here
[2:06:49] at the end time, Father. There's one
[2:06:51] here, Father, that don't know you like
[2:06:54] they should know you. I pray you'd
[2:06:56] minister to their heart right now.
[2:06:58] Father, there's one that's kind of
[2:06:59] drifted off from you. Lord, Father, lost
[2:07:02] a value of you, Lord. Father, I pray
[2:07:05] you'd pull them right back to your
[2:07:07] heart, Lord. I pray you'd do these
[2:07:09] things, Lord. Bless brother Steve and
[2:07:11] God, Father, and his faithfulness here,
[2:07:13] Lord. I pray you'd work everything out
[2:07:15] with his with the building here, Lord.
[2:07:18] Father, may all of the people work
[2:07:19] together, Lord, to bring a place that
[2:07:22] the people may gather. Father, grant
[2:07:24] this to him, Lord. Bless him and
[2:07:26] strengthen him and sister Sharon. Lord,
[2:07:28] for their dedication and their love for
[2:07:30] these people, Lord, oh God, let us love
[2:07:34] one another.
[2:07:36] But Father, teach us how to love
[2:07:37] ourselves like you do. Then we'll love
[2:07:40] one another. Grant it to us, Lord, in
[2:07:43] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:07:46] Amen. Can we sing that little old song?
[2:07:49] Amen.
[2:07:51] I want to live
[2:07:54] the way
[2:07:57] he wants me
[2:08:00] to live.
[2:08:02] I want to give
[2:08:06] until there's just no more
[2:08:12] to give. Anyone need prayer?
[2:08:15] I want to
[2:08:19] love till
[2:08:23] just
[2:08:28] I could never
[2:08:35] I could never do it. Sing it again. I
[2:08:38] didn't know how much you love me.
[2:08:42] Remember
[2:08:43] Jesus loves you and I do too.
[2:08:50] [Music]
[2:08:54] I want to give
[2:08:58] until there's just no more
[2:09:04] to give.
[2:09:07] to love
[2:09:12] till there's just no
[2:09:17] love.
[2:09:20] I could never
[2:09:23] ever
[2:09:25] love
[2:09:26] the Lord.
[2:09:28] Amen. Glory to God. Do you love him
[2:09:32] tonight? Amen. A powerful sweet message.
[2:09:38] A cheerful giver.
[2:09:41] God loves a cheerful giver. Amen. Glory
[2:09:46] to God. I'm just going to read brother
[2:09:49] Brandham quote and that's what we close
[2:09:51] with.
[2:09:53] Brother Brandham says this in the
[2:09:55] message I am the resurrection and the
[2:09:58] life
[2:09:59] in paragraph 32. It's in 1952
[2:10:03] on uh August the 10th.
[2:10:06] Brother Brandham say, "Now look at
[2:10:08] little Mary here. She takes off up into
[2:10:12] the wilderness,
[2:10:14] up into the mountains to see Elizabeth,
[2:10:16] her cousin.
[2:10:18] Jesus and John were half were second
[2:10:21] cousins. Mary and Elizabeth were first
[2:10:24] cousins. And they went up into the
[2:10:27] mountain." She did to enjoy the
[2:10:30] fellowship of her cousin. Think about
[2:10:33] that. Just went to enjoy the fellowship
[2:10:37] of her cousin. Something happened to
[2:10:39] her. She run to somebody else to sister
[2:10:41] so and so and sit and before you know
[2:10:44] it, a dead baby that was there came back
[2:10:46] to life. Brother Brandham continue. He
[2:10:49] says that is what we need to do today.
[2:10:52] Amen.
[2:10:55] Amen. God did something for you. You run
[2:10:57] to sister so and so to brother so and
[2:10:59] so. You say brother let's sit down. I'm
[2:11:01] going to tell you what the Lord have
[2:11:02] done in our life. You never know what
[2:11:05] resurrection you can bring to that home.
[2:11:07] Amen. Brother Brandham said that is what
[2:11:10] we need to do today. The deadiest the
[2:11:14] deadest dead the deadest thing in the
[2:11:17] world is the Dead Sea.
[2:11:21] Amen.
[2:11:23] who takes everything in and gives
[2:11:27] nothing out.
[2:11:29] William brother, I'm going to start it
[2:11:31] again. He says what? That's what we need
[2:11:34] to do today. The deadiest things in the
[2:11:37] world is the dead. See who takes
[2:11:40] everything in always. Thank you. Thank
[2:11:43] you. Thank you. And gives nothing out.
[2:11:47] Amen. Or if we come to a meeting,
[2:11:51] God fill our soul with glory. We ought
[2:11:54] to tell 50 people a day.
[2:11:58] Everywhere. Every day. Tell another 50.
[2:12:02] Another 50. Give out. That keeps the
[2:12:06] systems cleans out.
[2:12:09] So when you give out, it's cleansing
[2:12:11] you.
[2:12:13] Amen. Amen. Amen. God give you give out.
[2:12:17] God give you give out. Yes sir. Do you
[2:12:20] know that there is a law to that?
[2:12:23] Do you know there is a law? Amen. You
[2:12:25] you are pulling. Do you know you have
[2:12:29] [Music]
[2:12:34] let me read it. I don't have any choice.
[2:12:36] Let's go to second Corinthian.
[2:12:41] Somebody ask me because some of the
[2:12:43] thing we don't teach them in the
[2:12:46] message. So
[2:12:50] we don't know
[2:12:53] we don't know how to do that and we
[2:12:56] usually make fun of denomination
[2:12:58] when they give and we say they're giving
[2:13:01] they giving they giving they giving but
[2:13:03] some of the stuff they learn they know
[2:13:05] they they correct more than message
[2:13:07] believer. Amen. Here it goes message
[2:13:10] believer sometime are stingy
[2:13:15] offering $10 $10 $10 $10 $10
[2:13:25] your suit, shoes and everything. $1,000
[2:13:31] and every time you trying to touch it.
[2:13:33] No, no, no, no. He's preaching
[2:13:34] prosperity. He's preaching prosperity.
[2:13:36] And then the gun
[2:13:39] 10 years in the church, you always give
[2:13:41] $10.
[2:13:45] A brother is in need, $10.
[2:13:48] Your hair $200.
[2:13:54] And then you condemning the
[2:13:55] denomination.
[2:13:57] Remember, remember the same God that was
[2:14:00] in Israel was also anointing Bum. Yes,
[2:14:04] sir. Come on now sir. So God will bless
[2:14:06] them according to his laws.
[2:14:09] Amen. He didn't say God didn't say
[2:14:12] they're part of the bride, but because
[2:14:14] they are obeying God with what they
[2:14:16] know, God is under obligation to bless
[2:14:18] them even though they're not part of the
[2:14:20] bride. And you could be in the broad not
[2:14:22] obeying the law and God won't bless you.
[2:14:24] Amen. But you are in the message rank.
[2:14:27] Praise. Amen.
[2:14:30] Amen. Amen. Let's go to 2 Corinthians
[2:14:33] chapter 9. Like it or not, we going to
[2:14:36] read it. Yes, sir.
[2:14:38] Lord,
[2:14:42] you there? Where brother Richie, stop?
[2:14:44] That's where I'm I'm starting. I'm
[2:14:46] sorry. I had to say this. I have to obey
[2:14:48] the spirit. Yeah. Because there are many
[2:14:51] things we are not taught correctly in
[2:14:53] the message. And I took this scripture
[2:14:55] with somebody who was willing. He said,
[2:14:56] "Brother Stephen, how do we sow to God?"
[2:14:59] And we sat me and him in the office and
[2:15:02] then we talked like two hours. I went
[2:15:04] through the scripture to show him
[2:15:06] things. Message believer don't even want
[2:15:07] to touch him. Come on now. And you will
[2:15:10] wonder why that man is prospering.
[2:15:14] Amen. Verse seven. He say every man
[2:15:17] according as he purpose in his heart.
[2:15:20] There is $10.
[2:15:23] So let him give
[2:15:25] not grudgingly.
[2:15:27] There's the key. Ah, he's going to say
[2:15:29] again. Amen. All of necessity. If I
[2:15:33] don't give, I get a booping. So, let me
[2:15:36] just give it. Amen. For God loves a
[2:15:40] cheerful giver. Amen. Watch verse eight.
[2:15:45] And God is able
[2:15:48] to make what?
[2:15:51] A bond toward who? You.
[2:15:54] You. Who? The stingy. Yes sir.
[2:16:00] The one who own everything the dead sea
[2:16:03] brother or the dead sea sister. She
[2:16:06] always receive. You are always in need.
[2:16:09] You are always lacking.
[2:16:13] Dead sea sister.
[2:16:16] That's why I'm against the ministry that
[2:16:19] is always asking other. No no no no no
[2:16:21] no. Take even your chicken. Give to the
[2:16:24] other brother. Amen. But we have
[2:16:27] developed a dependency. It's it's a
[2:16:29] parasite where we keep sucking for 20
[2:16:33] years. That ministry keep sucking.
[2:16:36] Lord, no you need to you need the God of
[2:16:39] Joseph to come to your church.
[2:16:43] And it become like a system. Those those
[2:16:46] minister are rich. This here are poor.
[2:16:49] So for for years 20 100 years in a
[2:16:52] message they just depending support.
[2:16:55] support. Support if you go visit them,
[2:16:58] you will pay for your hotel, you pay for
[2:17:01] your food. Come on.
[2:17:04] I'm preaching in my own pit.
[2:17:07] So, I'm free.
[2:17:09] Thank you for In other words, their
[2:17:11] giving doesn't exist because brother so
[2:17:14] and so is rich. So, brother so and so
[2:17:16] will take care of his. No, no, no, no.
[2:17:18] You call the brother. You pay for his
[2:17:20] altar.
[2:17:22] Cook your rice. cook your poor rice and
[2:17:25] bring it to the brother. You say,
[2:17:26] "Brother, this is what we have." Amen.
[2:17:30] And before you know it, they got they
[2:17:32] got uh I mean believers numbers. Amen.
[2:17:35] Amen. Dependency ministry. And the
[2:17:38] believer are going, we're going to give
[2:17:39] this brother. So he will be I mean uh
[2:17:43] blessed. We will be blessed. Since you
[2:17:45] gave him 40 years, he keep getting
[2:17:47] money. Dead sea. Dead sea.
[2:17:50] Now,
[2:17:55] I told you the reason why God sent me in
[2:17:57] this message, right? So, I don't have no
[2:17:59] clue when I have to shoot. I don't think
[2:18:01] twice. I have to pull it because that's
[2:18:04] the way I was built.
[2:18:07] Amen. A stingy brother.

[2:18:22] going to church for financial support.
[2:18:25] That church over there, when I get
[2:18:27] there, then I'm going to behave like I'm
[2:18:29] the poorest. So everybody give me their
[2:18:31] shoes, the
[2:18:39] you the special one.
[2:18:41] Amen. Can I continue? Verse eight. And
[2:18:45] God is able to make all grace. How many
[2:18:48] grace? All are born toward who? You.
[2:18:53] That ye always
[2:18:56] having what?
[2:18:59] In how many things?
[2:19:01] I don't know if you understand what
[2:19:02] you're reading.
[2:19:04] So God, let me continue. All things may
[2:19:08] abound to what? Every good word. Do you
[2:19:11] know what it means?
[2:19:13] So when God sees that you are a person
[2:19:16] that is a cheerful giver, God now will
[2:19:19] direct his anointing,
[2:19:22] his blessing towards you. Because he
[2:19:26] knows that if I give brother Charles, he
[2:19:28] will give. Yes, sir. So God will make
[2:19:30] sure that in all necessity, Amen.
[2:19:33] Brother Charles is covered.
[2:19:36] Amen. Amen. And then when his cup is
[2:19:38] full, God will make his cup to overflow.
[2:19:42] Yes sir. So that with the overflow he
[2:19:44] will continue to bless and you wonder
[2:19:47] why you don't have money now.
[2:19:51] Amen.
[2:19:52] Amen.
[2:19:54] Because when they tell you somebody's in
[2:19:56] trouble the first the first dollar $20
[2:19:59] is the highest. 50 you have a heart
[2:20:02] attack.
[2:20:06] Amen. But if you give, God will bring
[2:20:09] all grace toward you and say, you know
[2:20:11] what? If I want to bless that church
[2:20:13] over there, there is a brother there.
[2:20:16] There is a sister there. If I bless that
[2:20:18] sister, automatically that church will
[2:20:20] continue to move forward.
[2:20:23] And God bring it and the sister keep
[2:20:24] giving and she doesn't even understand
[2:20:26] why she keep getting stuff because God
[2:20:28] already look at the heart.
[2:20:31] But when you in the heart, you say, "Oh,
[2:20:33] you know what? My pastor is already a
[2:20:36] doctor
[2:20:38] and he has a lot of money. I ain't gonna
[2:20:41] give one penny. Good luck. Continue with
[2:20:44] your money.
[2:20:47] When you're in trouble, you will see me
[2:20:49] giving you freely and cheerfully.
[2:20:56] Are we together? You want God to direct
[2:20:58] his blessing toward you? Open your
[2:21:01] pipes. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Amen. Amen.
[2:21:06] Open your pal. Start giving. When you
[2:21:08] give, God say he give. First of all,
[2:21:11] number one, take care of him. Make sure
[2:21:13] all his bills are always paid. Then give
[2:21:15] him overflow. He's going to pay for it.
[2:21:18] So you want to be in financial security.
[2:21:23] You don't need a lot of school.
[2:21:27] You don't need a lot of school, a lot of
[2:21:28] books. Some of them are simple. Simple.
[2:21:34] Four years. No, no tithing offering. $5.
[2:21:38] $5. $5. Praise you, Lord. $100.
[2:21:44] The whole world will know.
[2:21:49] Are we together? And the first one to
[2:21:51] complain. Why we don't have soap in the
[2:21:54] bathroom?
[2:21:55] Soap means diero.
[2:21:58] Ah,
[2:22:00] brother Richie started the sermon. It's
[2:22:02] not me. I didn't start the sermon.
[2:22:03] Brother Richie started the man. I'm just
[2:22:05] I'm just riding behind that.
[2:22:08] Huh? Well, the building is not moving.
[2:22:11] How much did you give in?
[2:22:14] How much did you give in it?
[2:22:17] Oh, you expecting us to give it to you?
[2:22:20] Praise you, Lord.
[2:22:24] I was about to take the money the person
[2:22:26] gave me because I know the person. I was
[2:22:28] about to return the money back. I said,
[2:22:30] "No, no, this person cannot give that
[2:22:32] that much money." And the scripture a
[2:22:34] quote hit me.
[2:22:37] The widow woman and brother Brham wanted
[2:22:40] brother Brham took want to take a right
[2:22:42] to $20 and return back and God say the
[2:22:45] angel of the Lord say leave it. Brother
[2:22:47] Brham say she's suffering. He say leave
[2:22:48] it. Do you know what she got out of $20?
[2:22:52] [Applause]
[2:22:53] Huh?
[2:22:56] Something that money can buy. She got
[2:22:58] the salvation of her children. And
[2:23:00] brother Brandham say it was because of
[2:23:02] the offering she gave.
[2:23:05] How can offering be related to
[2:23:07] salvation? Do you see this stuff taught
[2:23:10] in the message? We don't teach them in a
[2:23:13] message because everybody is afraid. Oh,
[2:23:15] if brother Steven want to say this, it's
[2:23:16] about, hey, hey, uh, I have a job. I'm
[2:23:19] working.
[2:23:21] Amen. But I got to say the truth.
[2:23:28] Amen.
[2:23:31] Are we together?
[2:23:32] I used to wait at the end of the year
[2:23:35] and pay the tithing of my office, my
[2:23:38] practice. I saidm say that the devil.
[2:23:41] Amen. Because you got to balance
[2:23:43] everything. I say, "Hey." I said when
[2:23:44] you're waiting to balance everything
[2:23:46] there is an unconscious fear of loss
[2:23:49] behind that every month when my CPA send
[2:23:53] everything
[2:23:56] so I'm not worrying about waiting at the
[2:23:58] end of the year to balance everything
[2:24:01] bless you
[2:24:04] go watch my schedule
[2:24:08] overflown
[2:24:11] [Laughter]

[2:24:16] principle. I'm talking to you openly as

[2:25:23] pocket they know the difference between
[2:25:26] a $50 and and a $1 and they go toward
[2:25:29] the $1.
[2:25:32] [Laughter]
[2:25:38] Good thing they know very well. They say
[2:25:39] this is a $50. Uh if I bring money over
[2:25:42] there, let me leave it in church. My
[2:25:44] friend, my friend, they are laws. Some
[2:25:47] of the stuff if we teach you, you you

[2:26:48] scripture. Let me leave it alone. Go
[2:26:50] read it yourself at home. Amen. So God
[2:26:53] bless you. You blessing somebody and
[2:26:55] somebody goes to God and say praise the
[2:26:57] Lord. Thank you Lord for brother John
[2:26:59] Paul. Lord, I thank you. Now, God is
[2:27:02] receiving thanksgiving because of what

[2:27:37] one who usually take care of brother
[2:27:38] Khala will take care of. Sometime it's
[2:27:41] not even money.
