[5:45] amen
[5:46] the contagious christian hallelujah
[5:49] blessed be the name of the lord brother
[5:51] robert already announced you about
[5:52] sister mary
[5:54] we used to give her a ride lord
[5:58] if i'm not mistaken since she was 72.
[6:01] so she passed a 90. so we had an
[6:04] opportunity to see her we brought robert
[6:07] and sister lorell
[6:08] on thursday her daughter sent me a
[6:10] message this morning so we'll keep
[6:12] up with what they're going to be doing
[6:14] there whether the funeral and things
[6:16] like that
[6:17] she has been like a mother to me i knew
[6:19] her for a long time and
[6:20] been giving her a ride and everything
[6:22] but i pray
[6:24] we pray with brother robert and i told
[6:25] her i say in her subconscious i know she
[6:28] can hear us
[6:29] because she had a stroke so she could
[6:31] not move
[6:32] pretty much and say sister mary the lord
[6:35] can still raise you
[6:36] but if he doesn't raise you up and it's
[6:38] your time to go we meet you in the air
[6:40] amen that's the hope of christian the
[6:43] power
[6:44] to know him in the power of his
[6:47] resurrection
[6:48] amen you always want to keep the power
[6:50] of resurrection
[6:52] because if the quickening power that's
[6:54] what raised the dead
[6:55] heal the sick and does everything if god
[6:58] can defeat death there is nothing else
[7:01] that is out there that the lord cannot
[7:02] do amen
[7:04] so the work of the building already
[7:06] started
[7:07] just keep us in prayer and what we spoke
[7:10] with the trustees
[7:13] is that every second week of the month
[7:16] and every fourth week of the month we
[7:19] will be
[7:19] taking the building fund offering so
[7:22] if you want to bring it every day that's
[7:24] fine but we want to
[7:26] just kind of get get you time to get
[7:28] prepared
[7:29] so the second sunday and the fourth
[7:31] sunday
[7:32] we will be taking a regular offering and
[7:35] then
[7:35] the building fund so at least you have a
[7:37] time to get prepared
[7:39] for building fun because we need it to
[7:41] continue the building
[7:42] so if the trustees come here and
[7:43] continue to remind you
[7:45] that's the anointing amen that's their
[7:48] job i'm not going to get there
[7:49] they're going to keep telling you but
[7:51] mike is there but the team is there so
[7:53] they will continue to remind you until
[7:55] we get the job done
[7:57] it looks like it's a mountain there's a
[7:59] lot to be done
[8:00] but there is nothing too hard that the
[8:02] lord cannot handle
[8:04] amen we move by faith and faith can move
[8:07] the mountain
[8:08] even if it's a lot of tiny faith like
[8:10] this if you speak to this mountain
[8:12] that's it the mountain will be moved so
[8:15] brother andrew you here we only have one
[8:17] service take your liberty

[10:41] situations he's the answer to the
[10:44] problems he's the healer to the
[10:45] sicknesses
[10:46] he's a deliverer to the captains this
[10:48] morning heavenly father
[10:50] lord as your believers have gathered
[10:52] here today lord we don't gather here out
[10:54] of tradition father we don't gather here
[10:56] out of ritual
[10:58] the lord we gather here because there is
[10:59] a deep calling to the deep
[11:01] and lord your word says that the lord
[11:04] that didn't call
[11:05] there has to be a need to respond lord i
[11:08] believe this morning that there's a
[11:09] house full of believers here today lord
[11:11] that
[11:12] we're not desiring lord to be seen to be
[11:14] heard
[11:15] we're not desiring to be anything but
[11:17] what you would have us to be lord
[11:20] lord we know the enemy's fighting on
[11:21] every hand doing everything he can to
[11:23] stop and to defeat
[11:25] but this morning lord we say greater is
[11:27] he that is in us than he that is in the
[11:29] world
[11:30] and father i believe as these believers
[11:32] are here today lord we've come
[11:34] lord we're desiring more of you lord
[11:35] desiring more of your word desiring more
[11:37] of your power
[11:38] and lord we know that you're if there is
[11:40] a desire in our heart for
[11:42] more of you then there's more of you
[11:43] somewhere for us this morning
[11:45] and lord we don't believe there's more
[11:47] of you for us in the denomination lord
[11:49] or in a creed or in a dogma
[11:51] but lord we truly believe there is more
[11:52] of you for us in your word so now as the
[11:55] songs of zion have been sung
[11:57] lord as the atmosphere has been created
[11:59] i pray this morning o god

[12:59] to the book of saint john the fifth
[13:00] chapter of the book of saint john the
[13:03] fifth chapter
[13:04] and we have a few places we'd like to
[13:06] read this morning with you
[13:07] in the bible but beginning there in
[13:09] saint john 5. and while you're turning
[13:11] there we want to take this opportunity
[13:13] to greet you this morning in the name of
[13:14] the lord

[13:30] send their greetings to you all as well
[13:32] this morning and that was just
[13:34] honored to be a christian honored to be
[13:36] believing this message amen and
[13:38] sure good to have our family here with
[13:40] us this morning god bless you all and
[13:42] this morning if we could look in saint
[13:43] john the fifth chapter
[13:45] i want to look in the the 21st verse
[13:50] the bible here says for as the father
[13:53] raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them
[13:58] even so the son quickeneth whom he will
[14:02] for the father judgeth no man but hath
[14:04] committed all judgment unto the son
[14:07] that all men should honor the son even
[14:09] as they honor the father
[14:12] for he that honoreth not the son
[14:14] honoreth not the father which hath sent
[14:16] him
[14:17] verily verily i say unto you he that
[14:19] heareth number says that word heareth
[14:22] means understandeth so he that
[14:24] understandeth my word
[14:26] and believeth on him that sent me hath
[14:30] everlasting life and shall not come into
[14:33] condemnation but is passed
[14:35] from death unto life verily verily i say
[14:38] unto you the hour is coming and now
[14:40] is when the dead shall hear the voice
[14:43] somebody say the voice
[14:45] shall hear the voice of the son of god
[14:47] and they that hear shall live
[14:49] for as the father hath the life in
[14:51] himself so after he given the son to
[14:53] have life in himself
[14:55] and hath given him authority to execute
[14:57] judgment also
[14:59] because he is the son of man
[15:02] because he is the son of man now notice
[15:05] verse 28
[15:06] marvel not at this for the hour is
[15:08] coming
[15:09] in the which all that are in the grave
[15:12] shall hear the voice
[15:13] his voice and shall come forth they that
[15:16] have done good
[15:17] under the resurrection of life and they
[15:19] that have done evil unto the
[15:20] resurrection
[15:22] of damnation now if we could go the book
[15:24] of luke the 17th chapter
[15:26] there in john 5 jesus is speaking and
[15:29] saying
[15:29] he is the son of man and here in luke
[15:33] of the 17th chapter and the 30th verse
[15:37] i know this is a bride scripture
[15:41] amen in luke 17 30 jesus you're speaking
[15:44] now says
[15:46] even thus shall it be in the day when
[15:49] the son of man
[15:51] is revealed when the son of man
[15:55] is revealed but the realm says or jesus
[15:57] christ
[15:58] made manifest in his people so the hour
[16:00] shall be when the son of man
[16:01] is revealed or when jesus christ
[16:04] is made manifest in his people and i
[16:06] believe this morning i'm
[16:08] looking at the people that the son of
[16:10] man is going to be manifested in
[16:12] in this hour and one other place i'd
[16:14] like to read before we let you be seated
[16:16] is revelation 10 and verse 7
[16:20] the devil hates this verse but i'd like
[16:23] to dedicate it to him just once again
[16:25] this morning if that'd be okay
[16:27] in revelation 10 and verse 7
[16:34] the bible here speaking says but in the
[16:37] days
[16:38] of the voice of the seventh angel
[16:41] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[16:44] of god
[16:45] should be finished as he hath declared
[16:48] to his servants the prophets let's read
[16:49] that together
[16:51] but in the days of the voice of the
[16:53] seventh angel
[16:54] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[16:57] of god should be finished as he hath
[16:59] declared
[17:00] to his servants the prophets we asked
[17:03] the lord this morning to add the
[17:04] blessing to the reading of his word
[17:06] as you may have your seats there for
[17:08] just a few moments this morning
[17:10] from those scriptures if the lord would
[17:12] help me i'd like to speak to you here
[17:14] and if i will title this this morning
[17:16] maybe just talk to you here for a few
[17:17] moments on obey
[17:19] the voice of the son of man obey
[17:23] the voice of the son of man and maybe
[17:25] just to lay a bit of a foundation here
[17:27] sometime back i was listening to some
[17:29] tapes and a series of tapes there
[17:30] and bill abraham actually makes a
[17:32] statement there that really just struck
[17:33] my heart
[17:34] he says now if you recognize he is just
[17:37] using
[17:38] my voice it would say he is just using
[17:41] my voice and i'll let this read this
[17:43] quote he said now i'm asking you to all
[17:45] be reverent just as reverend as you can
[17:48] you say brother branham what are you
[17:49] talking about you're stalling
[17:51] he said i am exactly i am waiting for
[17:54] that angel of the lord to come
[17:56] that's exactly right i don't know none
[17:58] of you and how can i do
[17:59] anything i can't it's him
[18:02] i can't it's him i can't do it even when
[18:06] he comes
[18:07] unless your faith operates it amen it's
[18:10] not me so the prophet here is removing
[18:12] himself altogether from the equation
[18:14] and saying i can't do it even if he
[18:16] comes i can't do nothing
[18:18] it's your faith that operates it he said
[18:20] see i can't see
[18:21] visions unless it's your faith that does
[18:23] it sure god will
[18:25] by divine gift only thing i do is just
[18:28] keep yielding myself and as i get myself
[18:30] completely yielded
[18:32] to the holy spirit then he starts
[18:34] talking
[18:35] it's no me he's using my voice
[18:39] he said but it's not me it's him he is
[18:42] using my voice
[18:43] but it's not me it's him see that's just
[18:46] scripture
[18:46] all right is this the man all right i'm
[18:48] waiting for his
[18:50] now i want y'all to keep your seats be
[18:51] real reverent now this time through
[18:53] jesus christ's name
[18:54] i take this entire group of people under
[18:57] control
[18:58] under my control for the glory of god
[19:00] and every spirit in here to be subject
[19:03] to the holy spirit now
[19:04] what you're hearing is not a man or a
[19:07] preacher
[19:07] or just a prophet but what you're now
[19:09] hearing is a spokesman
[19:11] amen of the almighty god not just
[19:13] anybody saying anything
[19:15] amen but now this is a vindicated
[19:18] ordained anointed spokesman
[19:20] for the living god now hebrews 12 25
[19:22] will say
[19:23] see that you refuse not him that speaker
[19:26] somebody say
[19:26] speaketh see that you refuse not him
[19:30] that speaketh for if they escape not
[19:32] who refused him that spake on earth how
[19:34] much more shall not we escape if we turn
[19:37] away from him that speaketh from heaven
[19:39] now that word speak affair
[19:40] actually means to articulate sounds amen
[19:43] or to declare
[19:44] one's mind by speech or sound so there's
[19:47] a fault
[19:48] and then there's an idea there's
[19:49] something that's in the mind
[19:51] amen but the only way to reveal what's
[19:53] in the mind is by a voice now
[19:55] you can have all kinds of faults here
[19:57] this morning amen but until there comes
[19:59] a voice to those thoughts
[20:00] amen then they're just salt but when
[20:02] there is a voice
[20:04] amen connected to the thoughts then it's
[20:06] no longer thought
[20:07] it is now a word manifested and do you
[20:10] see this morning
[20:11] amen that this message is not just a
[20:13] fault amen it's not just an idea it's
[20:15] not just something that some man come up
[20:17] with
[20:18] amen but this message is the thoughts of
[20:20] god they've been that was in the mind of
[20:22] god from before the foundation of the
[20:25] world
[20:25] amen the prophet said what is the bible
[20:27] he said it's the thoughts of god
[20:29] they've been dropped down to the earth
[20:31] and they were written by the prophets
[20:33] they meant to be expressed through the
[20:35] people see
[20:36] they've been then this morning we're
[20:37] hearing all kinds of sounds
[20:39] amen but unless there comes an
[20:41] articulation amen or a distinction of
[20:44] the sounds and it's a bunch of noise
[20:46] amen the prophet said see what you're
[20:47] hearing is the evening light
[20:50] sounds coming on he said what is the
[20:52] even light sound according to malachi 4
[20:54] it's the message to restore the faith to
[20:57] the people
[20:58] amen the faith of the fathers to the
[21:00] children he meant a message now notice
[21:02] this
[21:03] malachi 4 god amen is going to sin
[21:06] somebody shout sinned
[21:08] and then god is going to send a prophet
[21:11] they've been noticed this and a true
[21:12] prophet
[21:13] is god sent not man made amen a true
[21:17] prophet that comes with a word
[21:18] it's not a man-made prophet a many is
[21:21] not a school made prophet
[21:23] amen but he is a god-sent prophet and
[21:25] god has kept his voice alive
[21:28] he been through the prophets you say
[21:30] what are you talking about bibraham says
[21:32] from eden
[21:33] he meant until now god has kept his
[21:35] voice alive
[21:36] he said but it's been through the
[21:38] prophets he said all the way back to
[21:40] abel
[21:41] he said when abel was silenced he meant
[21:44] god has raised up saith
[21:45] now i want you to catch this the prophet
[21:47] would stand there and say all the way
[21:48] from abel
[21:49] he meant unto now the voice of god has
[21:52] been speaking
[21:53] he said they tried to silence it in abel
[21:55] ain't been but he raised it up and said
[21:57] they tried to silence it itself and he
[22:00] raised it up in another generation
[22:02] he said see and even here this morning
[22:04] amen the same voice
[22:06] amen that was speaking in eden is the
[22:09] same voice
[22:10] that is speaking here this morning amen
[22:12] it's not a different voice
[22:14] it's not another voice the same voice
[22:17] amen that adam and eve heard in the
[22:19] garden
[22:20] is the same voice we are hearing this
[22:22] morning
[22:23] you say that what are you talking about
[22:24] i'm saying it is very important
[22:26] amen to believe on him that god sent to
[22:30] speak
[22:30] amen it is important to believe him that
[22:33] speaketh
[22:34] it is important to receive him that
[22:36] speaketh amen you say to receive him the
[22:39] prophet of god will
[22:40] show you amen that the works of god
[22:43] is believing on he whom god has sent
[22:46] amen they want to see the works of god
[22:48] want to manifest the works of god how do
[22:50] we manifest
[22:52] amen the works of god in this generation
[22:54] a prophet said it's by believing
[22:57] on he whom god has sent
[23:01] now i want you to catch this this
[23:02] morning amen he
[23:04] whom god has sent now in the dark ages
[23:07] the word was almost entirely lost to the
[23:10] people
[23:10] amen but god sent luther are you hearing
[23:13] me
[23:13] amen god sent luther with the word and
[23:16] the lutheran spoke for god at that time
[23:19] but they organized and again the pure
[23:21] word amen was lost for organization
[23:24] tends towards dogmas and creed and not
[23:26] simple word
[23:27] they could no longer speak for god then
[23:30] god
[23:30] sent wesley amen are you catching it god
[23:33] said luther
[23:34] he meant then god sent wesley amen and
[23:37] he was the voice with the word in his
[23:39] day
[23:39] and the people who took his revelation
[23:41] from god he met became the living
[23:44] epistles
[23:44] and then read and known of all men for
[23:46] their generation
[23:48] he said then when the methodist failed
[23:49] amen god raised up
[23:51] others and so it has gone on through the
[23:53] years until in this
[23:54] last day there is again another people
[23:58] in the land who under their messenger
[24:01] will be the final voice
[24:03] amen to the final age amen are you
[24:05] seeing it god sent luther
[24:07] amen with the word and those that
[24:09] received luther's message
[24:11] amen become the voice in luther's day
[24:14] then god sent wesley with the word
[24:16] and those that receive wesley amen
[24:18] become god's voice
[24:20] in the day they lived in he said and
[24:22] that pattern has gone
[24:23] on until now amen in the last days he
[24:27] has sent another voice
[24:28] it's not the voice of a preacher it's
[24:31] not the voice of a kentucky prophet
[24:33] it is the voice of god that has been
[24:35] thundering down
[24:36] amen all the way from eden unto now
[24:39] listen church
[24:40] we are not here hearing from a man we
[24:42] are hearing from the son of man
[24:44] we are not here hearing from a preacher
[24:47] we are hearing
[24:48] from the voice of our bridegroom who is
[24:50] saying let
[24:51] all come oh there is a final voice
[24:55] amen there is a final age or you hear me
[24:58] this morning
[24:59] if there's a final voice if there's a
[25:01] final age
[25:02] amen then there's got to come a final
[25:03] people amen if there's a final voice
[25:06] if there's a final age if there's a
[25:08] final message
[25:09] if there's a final messenger then
[25:11] there's got to come a final people
[25:13] and i say this morning the final people
[25:15] is not coming
[25:16] amen the final people is here amen the
[25:19] prophet said see
[25:20] when you recognize your word he said
[25:22] then by the living word
[25:24] you become the written epistles amen
[25:27] read and known of whole men
[25:29] think of this he said you've got to get
[25:30] the living word in you to have the
[25:32] living god in you
[25:33] and that's something you got to have the
[25:35] living word in you
[25:37] to get the living god in you
[25:39] [Applause]
[25:40] they want his cord they want god but
[25:43] they don't want his word
[25:44] amen but if you're going to have god
[25:46] then you're going to have his word
[25:47] he said because the word here is god he
[25:50] said now watch when it's made flesh in
[25:52] you
[25:52] made spirit laugh in you when it goes
[25:55] into your flesh
[25:56] and your faith and becomes life then you
[25:59] are
[25:59] a living example see you are an epistle
[26:02] of god
[26:03] amen read of all men and you won't have
[26:05] it like christ
[26:06] not the fullness because it's divided
[26:09] upon the day of pentecost now let me
[26:11] drive this home for a second it is
[26:12] important
[26:13] amen to receive amen it is important to
[26:16] believe he that speaketh
[26:17] but can i add something else to it it is
[26:20] also important to obey
[26:22] him that speaketh amen it's one thing to
[26:24] receive him
[26:25] one thing to believe him one thing to
[26:27] hear him but it's another thing
[26:28] amen to obey the voice in exodus the
[26:31] 23rd chapter
[26:33] in exodus the 23rd chapter and the 20th
[26:35] verse the bible says behold i send an
[26:38] angel before thee
[26:39] amen to keep me in the way and to bring
[26:41] me into the place which i have prepared
[26:44] beware of him and obey his voice
[26:47] provoke him not for he will not pardon
[26:50] your transgressions
[26:51] for my name is in him but if thou shalt
[26:54] indeed obey his voice
[26:56] and do all that i speak then i will be
[26:59] an enemy unto thine enemies
[27:00] amen and i will be an adversary unto
[27:03] thine adversaries from an angel
[27:05] shall go before thee amen and bring me
[27:08] into the amorites and the hittites and
[27:10] the parasites
[27:11] and the canaanites and the hives and the
[27:13] jebusites
[27:14] and i will cut them off notice this the
[27:17] angel is not behind them amen the angel
[27:20] is not beside them
[27:22] amen but the angel is before them amen
[27:25] as a sign
[27:26] that god does not send an angel amen to
[27:28] lead the church backwards
[27:30] amen but god sends an angel to lead the
[27:32] church forward
[27:34] now notice where he led them he led them
[27:37] right
[27:38] into the midst of their enemy he led
[27:40] them right into the heavens
[27:42] right into the amorites right into the
[27:44] canaanites and he said but if you'll
[27:46] follow that
[27:47] angel and obey his voice when you get
[27:50] in the middle of your enemy if you've
[27:52] obeyed the voice
[27:54] then you won't have to worry amen
[27:56] because i will take care of your enemy
[27:58] amen and i'll tell you this morning
[28:00] church let it be heard from the heavens
[28:02] let it be heard on the earth this
[28:04] morning there is a people
[28:06] who is not going to disobey amen the
[28:08] voice of the angel
[28:10] there is a people that is not going to
[28:12] turn their back
[28:13] on this message there is a pride and
[28:15] it's not going to turn around
[28:17] and begin to go back because we know
[28:19] amen without this message
[28:21] when we get in the middle of our enemy
[28:22] we're in trouble amen without this
[28:24] message
[28:25] when we're surrounded by sickness we're
[28:27] surrounded by depression
[28:28] we're surrounded by all kinds of
[28:30] troubles we are in trouble
[28:32] amen but with the voice of the angel he
[28:35] said i will come down
[28:38] and i will fight your battles and i will
[28:41] be an enemy to your enemies
[28:42] and i will be an adversary amen to your
[28:45] adversaries
[28:46] he said see then thou shall not bow down
[28:48] to their gods
[28:49] nor serve them nor do after their works
[28:52] but thou
[28:53] shalt utterly overthrow them and break
[28:56] down their images
[28:57] and you shall serve the lord your god
[28:59] and he shall bless thy bread
[29:01] and thy water and i somebody say i
[29:04] i will take sickness away from the midst
[29:07] of thee
[29:08] see there is a blessing in obeying the
[29:11] voice of the angel
[29:12] you say well brother andrew obedience is
[29:14] not very important
[29:15] my bible says to obey is better than
[29:18] sacrifice
[29:20] the prophet of god says obedience is the
[29:23] best
[29:24] he said see what does obedience do
[29:26] obedience
[29:27] unlocks the supernatural amen obedience
[29:31] unlocks the supernatural
[29:32] in genesis 22 and verse 18 and in thy
[29:36] seed
[29:36] shall all the nations of the earth be
[29:38] blessed he meant because
[29:40] thou has obeyed my voice amen what
[29:43] brought the blessing
[29:44] upon the seat of abraham was not his
[29:46] intelligence
[29:47] was not his education was not his
[29:50] ministry
[29:50] was not signs and wonders amen but what
[29:53] brought the blessing upon the seat of
[29:55] abraham
[29:56] was that abraham obeyed amen the voice
[29:59] of god
[29:59] the prophet said what a promise he meant
[30:02] because
[30:03] of obedience obedience is what god wants
[30:08] he said it's once and obedience is
[30:10] better than sacrifice
[30:12] to obey the lord is better than any
[30:15] sacrifice
[30:16] that you could do to obey the lord is
[30:19] better than any sacrifice
[30:20] i could do you could do anybody can do
[30:23] to obey the lord
[30:24] is better than any sacrifice now the
[30:27] prophet of god says god had called moses
[30:29] and he didn't want to go amen those
[30:31] prophets had such things to do
[30:33] until it was a hard thing to do he said
[30:35] they didn't want to be going out and be
[30:37] scorned at
[30:38] they wanted to have fellowship and they
[30:40] wanted to go in with the rest of them
[30:41] and go along with the brothers
[30:42] i forget what profit it was that said i
[30:45] don't want to do this in other words but
[30:47] my whole heart
[30:48] will catch a fire because god has spoken
[30:51] and i must deliver it
[30:55] god has spoken and i must deliver it
[30:59] notice this he said whether they liked
[31:01] it where they crucified him
[31:02] whether they stone him whatever they did
[31:04] amen god has spoken his heart
[31:07] and he must say it now catch this not to
[31:10] be
[31:10] different but to be obedient amen not to
[31:14] be different
[31:14] but to be obedient he meant obedience is
[31:17] better than
[31:18] sacrifice then see it was in his heart
[31:20] and he must do it it was his life
[31:22] he couldn't hold it there was something
[31:24] there was a pulsation
[31:26] there was a pulsation that pushed him
[31:28] they could bless it or they could curse
[31:30] it
[31:32] but god had so much complete control of
[31:35] them
[31:36] till he was their voice
[31:39] he was their action now notice this
[31:42] he said give me a church amen that is so
[31:45] completely anointed with god
[31:47] till every action and move is the sayeth
[31:50] the lord
[31:51] and will walk in the shackling glory and
[31:53] i will show you a messiah
[31:55] which is an anointed one of god standing
[31:59] up on the earth now i want you to catch
[32:01] something here this morning
[32:02] the prophet said those men were not
[32:04] saying things they meant to be different
[32:06] they were saying things to be obedient
[32:08] can you imagine moses coming down with
[32:10] the ten commandments
[32:11] how different that was amen how how
[32:14] strange that was to the normal mind
[32:16] amen but moses didn't say that to be
[32:18] different he said it to be obedient
[32:22] can i preach a minute amen when noah
[32:24] come down and said it's time to build an
[32:26] ark
[32:26] he didn't say that to be different he
[32:28] said it to be obedient
[32:30] he meant listen and when a prophet come
[32:32] in 1965
[32:34] and preached the message the rapture he
[32:36] said now go listen to it he said i'm not
[32:38] saying these things amen for prejudice
[32:40] i'm saying these things
[32:42] because the word of the lord must be
[32:44] declared
[32:45] you say then why was he saying was he
[32:47] saying third paul to be different
[32:49] was he saying theophany to be different
[32:51] was he said a third
[32:52] i mean a seventh peak to be different
[32:55] was he saying sunset mountain to be
[32:56] different
[32:57] was he saying a pillar of fire amen to
[32:59] be different i say no
[33:01] he was saying those things he meant
[33:03] because he wasn't in control
[33:05] of his own voice and then but there was
[33:07] another voice
[33:08] that had possessed the vessel of the
[33:10] seven angel
[33:11] and there was a pulsation there was a
[33:14] drive there was a fire
[33:15] and i say this morning that voice is not
[33:18] dead
[33:19] that voice is in the church this morning
[33:21] there is a pulsation
[33:23] of the holy ghost flowing through the
[33:25] building this morning
[33:26] not to be different but to be obedient
[33:32] not to be different i'm not preaching
[33:34] this message
[33:35] to be different i'm preaching it to be
[33:37] obedient
[33:38] amen amen come on church you all didn't
[33:40] start this church
[33:41] he meant to be different you started
[33:43] this church to be obedient
[33:45] amen because the voice that sounded in
[33:48] this age
[33:48] was more than a man it was more than a
[33:51] preacher it was the son of man
[33:53] it was jesus christ the mighty god
[33:56] unveiled in this generation
[34:00] we're not shouting to be different we're
[34:02] shouting to be obedient
[34:04] we're not screaming to be different
[34:05] we're rejoicing
[34:07] because we've been obedient to the voice
[34:10] [Applause]
[34:13] not to be different but to be obedient
[34:18] now there's going to be times you have
[34:20] to do things
[34:21] that makes you look different
[34:24] but don't worry about the criticism
[34:26] you're just being obedient
[34:28] [Applause]
[34:32] you say well you're just starting
[34:34] trouble no i'm just being obedient
[34:37] amen see amen there won't be nothing if
[34:39] you don't start nothing
[34:40] ain't it but if you start something
[34:41] there's gonna be something let me
[34:45] let me just preach here for a minute hey
[34:47] that you can talk about our house
[34:48] you can talk about our car you can talk
[34:50] about our clothes you can talk about
[34:52] anything you want to
[34:53] remember when you step on the message of
[34:56] the hour
[34:57] amen there's a fight that raises up in
[34:59] the heart of every bride member
[35:01] you know why not to be different but to
[35:04] be obedient
[35:06] see this is not about being different
[35:08] this message
[35:09] is about being obedient
[35:13] not to be different but to be obedient
[35:15] you see
[35:16] what it was it was the sign of god
[35:19] and the prophet said the signs of god
[35:21] are always
[35:22] overlooked now watch this one of god's
[35:25] signs
[35:26] is the coming of a prophet he said see
[35:29] the coming of a prophet
[35:31] is a sign that's overlooked by the
[35:33] people every time
[35:34] they overlook it he said but those who
[35:37] are elected to see
[35:38] it does see it amen those who are
[35:42] elected to see it
[35:43] they'll see it but the coming of a
[35:45] prophet was a sign
[35:47] that god is ready to speak when you see
[35:50] a prophet
[35:51] it's a sign that god is ready to speak
[35:56] because it ain't going to be speaking he
[35:58] said because if god
[36:00] ain't going to speak then the prophet
[36:02] wouldn't be
[36:03] on the earth if god didn't have
[36:06] something to say
[36:07] then the prophet wouldn't be on the
[36:08] earth he said now remember
[36:10] he wouldn't be on the earth unless god
[36:13] was ready to speak
[36:15] and the way he speaks is through those
[36:17] channels
[36:18] now how many will agree this morning
[36:20] that there is a sign
[36:24] there is a sign but then there is a
[36:27] voice
[36:28] amen there is a sign then there is a
[36:31] voice
[36:32] he said now the sign is given to get the
[36:35] attention of the audience
[36:37] amen to hear the voice amen see you
[36:40] can't stop at the sign
[36:42] and then you can't come as far as the
[36:44] sign amen but if you're going to go
[36:46] into the full blessing of the message if
[36:48] you're going to go
[36:49] into the untapped resources if you're
[36:51] going to break
[36:52] into the unseen where all things are
[36:54] possible you're going to have to go just
[36:56] beyond the sign
[36:58] into the voice the prophet said he wants
[37:00] an audience
[37:01] he wants somebody that's going to listen
[37:04] to what he
[37:05] is going to say
[37:08] the sign is an alert a meant to attract
[37:11] the attention of people
[37:13] that the word is getting ready to speak
[37:17] the sign is an alert to attract the
[37:20] attention
[37:21] of the people that the word
[37:25] somebody shout the word the word is
[37:28] getting ready to speak
[37:31] now let me say this many will see the
[37:34] sign
[37:36] but only the elected will hear the voice
[37:41] many will see the sign but
[37:44] only the elected will hear the voice
[37:48] many will see the first pull many will
[37:51] see
[37:52] the second pull even but the voice was
[37:55] not in the first pull
[37:56] amend the voice was not in the second
[37:59] pull
[37:59] the voice was in the third pull you say
[38:02] what is the voice the voice
[38:04] is the word and the prophet said what is
[38:07] the first pull
[38:08] it is healing what is the second pull it
[38:11] is prophecy
[38:12] what is the third pull it's the opening
[38:15] of the word the revealing of those
[38:18] divine mysteries
[38:22] are you hear me this morning church amen
[38:24] we are not here
[38:26] as a first pulled church we are not here
[38:28] as a second culture
[38:30] we are not a little bluegill we are not
[38:33] a little carp we are not a little bass
[38:36] we are a rainbow
[38:38] trout
[38:39] [Applause]
[38:42] we are a rainbow trout amen we have been
[38:45] caught by
[38:46] the voice are you hearing me when you
[38:49] hear the voice
[38:50] you can't unhear it when you hear the
[38:52] voice you cannot hear
[38:54] that voice awaken something on the
[38:57] inside of you
[39:01] you see what it awakened it awakened an
[39:04] announcement
[39:05] it's time for deliverance it's time
[39:09] to leave here it's time to go home
[39:12] it's time to turn northward we've
[39:15] compassed
[39:16] this mountain long enough
[39:19] now in exodus the third chapter
[39:24] god says i am come down
[39:27] to deliver israel amen but i'm sending
[39:30] you moses
[39:31] think about this the i am the god of
[39:33] gods
[39:34] the king of kings the lord of lords says
[39:37] i

[39:41] i'm sending you moses see the prophet
[39:44] said notice
[39:45] i have come down but i'm sending thee
[39:49] he says what is it it's god going in the
[39:52] form
[39:53] of a man
[39:56] it's the voice of deliverance amen
[39:59] failed
[40:00] in the form of a man see what happened
[40:03] god sent moses
[40:06] hope it's okay god sent moses
[40:10] to call an exodus to the people
[40:13] he said see moses was an angel
[40:16] to call an exodus upon the people now
[40:19] how many believes this morning in angels
[40:23] the prophet of god will tell us that all
[40:25] bible believers
[40:26] believe in angels in exodus 23 verse 20
[40:30] he said behold i sin are you catching
[40:32] this word i
[40:34] send an angel before thee to keep me in
[40:37] the way
[40:38] and to bring me to the place which i
[40:41] have prepared
[40:42] see god does not send an angel amen to
[40:45] lead you
[40:46] without having somewhere to take you
[40:49] god does not send a message ain't meant
[40:51] to catch your attention
[40:53] without there being some substance
[40:55] inside of the message you're hearing
[40:58] now notice this we could also say it
[41:00] like this behold
[41:02] i send a ministering spirit
[41:06] before thee to keep me in the way
[41:09] in matthew 18 10 the bible said that in
[41:11] heaven their angels
[41:12] do always behold the face of my father
[41:15] which is in heaven i want to read a few
[41:18] quotes here if that's okay
[41:19] see god always had ministering spirits
[41:23] i believe in them i believe in
[41:25] ministering spirits
[41:27] they've been sent from the presence of
[41:29] god the holy spirit ministers
[41:32] lead the church they are guardian angels
[41:36] that watch over us in another place you
[41:39] say well brother andrew only people have
[41:40] guarded angels is the prophet
[41:42] or is the pastor or is the ministry or
[41:44] is the deacon
[41:45] but the prophet said everyone has a
[41:48] guardian angel
[41:52] everyone has a guardian angel according
[41:55] to the scripture
[41:56] in the resurrection now before god sends
[41:59] a message to the earth
[42:01] god sends angels some time as messengers
[42:04] to the earth
[42:05] to bring the message to the people see
[42:08] do you believe that god has angels now i
[42:12] just want to take a few moments here
[42:13] and go through a few places in the bible
[42:15] where god had sent angels
[42:18] in genesis 16 7 the angel of the lord
[42:21] found hagar
[42:22] came in by a fountain of water and told
[42:25] her to return to syria
[42:27] and submit herself unto her hands
[42:30] notice this in genesis 19 15 the
[42:33] angels hastened lot saying arise
[42:36] and take thy wife and thy two daughters
[42:39] which are here
[42:40] lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of
[42:42] this city
[42:43] and escape for thy life in genesis 22 11
[42:47] the angel of the lord called unto
[42:50] abraham
[42:51] right before he slew isaac in first
[42:53] kings 19
[42:54] 5 there was an angel that was sent to
[42:57] elijah under a juniper tree
[42:59] and said unto him arise and eat
[43:03] there was an angel sent and that angel
[43:05] said arise and eat
[43:06] now the prophet said i want to pick out
[43:08] that angel here he is standing with the
[43:10] softest hands
[43:11] go over there don't you scare elijah you
[43:13] walk over and stroke his brow right easy
[43:16] i want the best cook among you go up
[43:18] there get all the vitamins you can find
[43:20] and put them in the cornmeal the world's
[43:23] turned him down
[43:24] but i'm going to treat him right
[43:28] that means hallelujah praise our god
[43:32] don't get scared of that amen bring
[43:34] forth the best that we got
[43:35] cook him a corn cake set him down some
[43:37] water and the
[43:39] soft-handed angel went over and stroked
[43:42] the little servant of god on the brown
[43:44] he said remember if you've done your
[43:45] best
[43:48] if you've done your best then god still
[43:52] got those
[43:52] angels in order
[43:56] he loves you just the same as he loved
[43:59] elijah
[44:00] now watch this in daniel 3 28 the bible
[44:03] says that god sent his angel
[44:04] to deliver the three hebrew boys that
[44:07] they would not give themselves
[44:08] over to the idolatry of the day in
[44:11] daniel 6 22
[44:12] daniel testified that god has sent an
[44:15] angel
[44:15] and shut the lion's mouth that they
[44:17] would not hurt him
[44:19] in mark 1 13 jesus in the wilderness for
[44:22] 40 days
[44:23] was tempted of satan and afterwards the
[44:25] angels came
[44:28] and ministered unto him in luke 16
[44:31] 22 do you realize there's angels in
[44:34] birth
[44:34] there's angels in life but there's also
[44:37] angels in death
[44:39] the bible said the beggar named lazarus
[44:41] died and was
[44:42] carried by angels into abraham's bosom
[44:47] in acts 5 19 the angel of the lord by
[44:50] night
[44:51] opened prison doors to the apostles that
[44:53] they were thrown behind
[44:54] now this one's the one i love brother
[44:56] kanema is acts 27 23
[44:59] and the angel of god stood before paul
[45:02] and warned him of the future
[45:07] no y'all didn't catch that an angel of
[45:09] god
[45:10] stood before paul and warned him
[45:13] of the future you know what that tells
[45:16] me brother stephen

[45:57] he sees him on the water 14 days with no
[46:00] compass
[46:01] with no light he sees him in a terrible
[46:03] condition but he goes back to the
[46:05] present
[46:06] and he says but listen paul there's
[46:08] going to be a shipwreck
[46:09] and there's going to be some hard days

[58:04] [Applause]
[58:06] angel
[58:08] [Applause]
[58:11] oh not all day
[58:15] angels watching over me my lord
[58:19] all day all
[58:22] [Applause]
[58:30] you're getting too carried away here no
[58:31] i'm not i'm preaching to you
[58:34] there were people there was other kids
[58:36] in the same waters
[58:37] that didn't escape the alligator's wrath
[58:41] but when it comes to the predestinated
[58:44] elected
[58:47] hands off
[58:51] hands off that's an anointed sign
[58:54] that's an anointed daughter there's a
[58:57] seal of god upon that life
[59:05] are you hearing me there
[59:08] is an anointing upon the elected
[59:13] to see the sign but to hear the voice
[59:18] now you you you may think people here
[59:22] get a little out of control because
[59:24] they're shouting and dancing
[59:25] rejoicing kind of i can't tell you
[59:27] what's actually happening probably said
[59:29] to meet one time and he said you wonder
[59:30] why
[59:31] he said i get excited he said there's he
[59:34] said there was a sister back in the
[59:35] church in jeffersonville
[59:37] she used to sing a song all night all
[59:40] day
[59:41] angels watching over me my lord
[59:44] he said now you have to he said if you
[59:45] notice me he said sometimes i have to
[59:48] take my hands and sit on them
[59:51] he said to keep from ruining the service
[59:57] imagine that a prophet of god
[1:00:00] sitting on his hands
[1:00:06] to keep from ruining the service he said
[1:00:09] the problem is
[1:00:10] when they get to singing about angels he
[1:00:13] said i
[1:00:14] have experienced it
[1:00:19] so they're not just singing a song to
[1:00:22] somebody that's pretty lyrics
[1:00:24] or pretty music but they were singing
[1:00:27] about angels
[1:00:29] watching over me all night
[1:00:32] and all day and the prophet said i had
[1:00:35] that kind of experience
[1:00:37] he said now you didn't think i acted
[1:00:38] like that did you
[1:00:41] he said you didn't think i act like that
[1:00:43] he said it's not me
[1:00:44] it's him doing it through me
[1:00:48] you mean it's jesus christ getting
[1:00:52] inside of a man
[1:00:53] causing him to have to sit on his hands
[1:00:56] to keep from worshipping
[1:00:58] to k alright now now don't don't go off
[1:01:00] in the left hill with that
[1:01:02] to keep from running the service he's
[1:01:04] sawing you here there's people around
[1:01:06] him that didn't understand why he was
[1:01:07] acting like that
[1:01:08] he said but the reason is i've
[1:01:10] experienced what they're singing about
[1:01:13] now do you see why just a minute ago
[1:01:15] there was such a release come in the
[1:01:16] building
[1:01:17] you realize why there was such an
[1:01:18] anointing begin to search
[1:01:20] because there was people here that has
[1:01:22] experienced
[1:01:24] the ministry of angels
[1:01:29] [Applause]
[1:01:31] so you can say i am a
[1:01:34] witness i know
[1:01:38] what he's talking about
[1:01:41] [Applause]
[1:01:43] you see ministering angels
[1:01:47] are sent to bring you to a prepared
[1:01:50] place
[1:01:51] now let me say this god has prepared a
[1:01:54] place of victory
[1:01:55] for every seed of abraham now let me say
[1:01:58] it like this
[1:01:59] the principle of obedience was
[1:02:02] established
[1:02:03] all the way back in the book of john the
[1:02:05] second chapter amen now
[1:02:06] you have to give me a little bit of
[1:02:07] liberty here because y'all's preaching
[1:02:09] me and i'm trying to get through this
[1:02:10] thought okay
[1:02:11] in john 2 verse 5 there was a wedding
[1:02:14] and they ran out of wine right when they
[1:02:17] when they
[1:02:18] they met when they ran out of the wine
[1:02:20] they didn't have nothing but water
[1:02:22] and his mother said in the servants
[1:02:24] whatsoever he saith unto you
[1:02:26] do it
[1:02:31] whatever he says unto you
[1:02:34] do it that's still good teaching today
[1:02:38] whatever he saith unto you do it if he
[1:02:41] tells you
[1:02:42] make ready for death you get ready if he
[1:02:44] tells you you're going to get well
[1:02:46] you believe it if he tells you that
[1:02:48] you're healed you are
[1:02:50] whatever he tells you he says to you
[1:02:53] do it to disbelieve it
[1:02:57] is a sin
[1:03:02] now now how many knows the problem of
[1:03:04] god amen if you could leave this monitor
[1:03:06] hard i'd appreciate it
[1:03:08] amen how many knows the father god said
[1:03:10] we've seen so much
[1:03:11] done now to disbelieve would be a sin
[1:03:16] now how many believes that god amen
[1:03:18] sends
[1:03:19] instructions thank you to an age amen to
[1:03:22] the angel messenger of that h
[1:03:24] see instructions to an age does not come
[1:03:27] to an evangelist
[1:03:28] does not come to the pastor let's not
[1:03:30] come to an apostle
[1:03:32] let's not come to a missionary the
[1:03:33] instructions to an
[1:03:35] age comes through a prophet
[1:03:38] which is a messenger now you realize
[1:03:40] what the messenger does
[1:03:41] the messenger has to deliver
[1:03:44] amen the messenger is under
[1:03:46] responsibility to deliver what he
[1:03:48] receives
[1:03:51] deliver what he receives in the book of
[1:03:54] first corinthians 15 verse 3
[1:03:56] paul says for i delivered which means to
[1:03:58] give over into one's power use
[1:04:00] or to deliver verbally i delivered unto
[1:04:03] you first of all
[1:04:05] that which i also received that word
[1:04:08] received
[1:04:09] means not to withhold obedience
[1:04:16] are you hearing me not to withhold
[1:04:19] obedience
[1:04:20] seek to receive with the mind by the
[1:04:23] instruction of teachers
[1:04:24] so paul here is saying the spirit has
[1:04:27] delivered
[1:04:28] unto me amen a message
[1:04:33] are you with me and i am under
[1:04:35] responsibility to deliver to you what i
[1:04:38] receive
[1:04:38] then see what paul received he delivered
[1:04:42] and what he delivered those who received
[1:04:45] it
[1:04:45] was delivered by what he received
[1:04:48] [Applause]
[1:04:50] now the prophet said
[1:04:53] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:04:56] the spirit saith unto the churches
[1:04:59] now it may be amen amen if you can bring
[1:05:02] this down just a little bit
[1:05:04] just a little bit it may be that
[1:05:06] millions will hear these words
[1:05:08] or read them but how many will pay heed
[1:05:11] to them
[1:05:12] that we do not know but he who will lend
[1:05:14] his ear
[1:05:15] and want to know the words of truth will
[1:05:18] find
[1:05:19] the spirit of god enlightening him if
[1:05:22] your ear is open to the word
[1:05:24] the spirit of god will make the word
[1:05:27] real to you but you've got to
[1:05:31] lend your ear to the spirit you've got
[1:05:34] to lend
[1:05:35] your ear to the voice of instructions
[1:05:39] now see the only way to receive the
[1:05:42] things delivered of god
[1:05:44] is by the spirit of god for paul will
[1:05:46] say
[1:05:47] to be carnally minded is death
[1:05:52] in the message harvest time the prophet
[1:05:54] says now how
[1:05:55] could it be bread and word it would be
[1:05:58] puzzling to the human mind
[1:05:59] but we are hoping this morning that
[1:06:01] there is no
[1:06:03] carnal minds among us that there
[1:06:06] is a spiritual mind among us
[1:06:11] we're hoping there's no carnal minds
[1:06:14] among us
[1:06:15] we're hoping there is a spiritual
[1:06:18] mind among us see that we
[1:06:21] could understand what the father is
[1:06:24] trying
[1:06:25] to get to us here
[1:06:29] another place amen
[1:06:34] it's all a spiritual revealed truth
[1:06:38] that's right it's laying here it takes
[1:06:42] the spiritual mind to catch it
[1:06:45] that's right see right onto the day rest
[1:06:48] on that
[1:06:49] only the spiritual mind can catch it
[1:06:52] see now what it does is it seems that
[1:06:55] the spiritual mind though
[1:06:57] is becoming numb amen i hate to keep
[1:07:00] saying it but i'm gonna have to have
[1:07:01] something up here i'm losing my voice
[1:07:03] a little bit more seems the spiritual
[1:07:05] mind is becoming numb now
[1:07:07] how many here this morning is god a
[1:07:08] spiritual mind
[1:07:10] we've got a carnal mind we've got a
[1:07:12] natural mind
[1:07:14] we got a human mind but without a
[1:07:16] spiritual mind
[1:07:17] this service is in vain do you realize
[1:07:21] it's only the spiritual mind
[1:07:23] that can catch somebody say catch that
[1:07:26] can
[1:07:26] catch the word teachings of the day
[1:07:30] the human mind it goes over their head
[1:07:33] the human mind misses it
[1:07:35] the carnal mind misses it but the
[1:07:37] spiritual mind
[1:07:42] [Applause]
[1:07:44] not your intelligence not what your
[1:07:46] family give you through education
[1:07:48] but a spiritual gene seed to catch
[1:07:51] you say what are you talking about okay
[1:07:53] like this three seeds
[1:07:55] have been sown in this day there has
[1:07:58] been a denominational seed
[1:08:00] there has been a word or there's been a
[1:08:02] pentecostal seed
[1:08:04] and there's been a word seed do you
[1:08:06] realize no other mind can catch that
[1:08:08] but a spiritual mind
[1:08:10] [Music]
[1:08:11] [Applause]
[1:08:13] you go out here and you scream out
[1:08:15] there's been three seeds shown and
[1:08:17] people look at you like you're crazy
[1:08:19] but to you that has a spiritual mind
[1:08:23] you can catch the reality of what the
[1:08:27] spirit
[1:08:28] is doing in this age see it's like the
[1:08:31] bible says
[1:08:32] the natural man receiveth not the things
[1:08:35] of the spirit of god for they are
[1:08:38] foolish unto him neither can
[1:08:41] he know them because they are
[1:08:44] spiritually
[1:08:45] discerned now watch this how many has
[1:08:48] received the holy ghost
[1:08:51] aren't you glad you've got it he said
[1:08:54] over here now
[1:08:55] eating the oak eating the strong things
[1:08:58] of god
[1:08:58] and got a clear understanding
[1:09:02] your spiritual mind is all unmuddled
[1:09:12] your spiritual mind is all
[1:09:15] unmodeled now watch this he said you
[1:09:18] know
[1:09:18] you cannot understand it until it's
[1:09:20] revealed to you the whole thing
[1:09:22] is built upon spiritual revelations
[1:09:26] you've got to hear and then recognize
[1:09:29] and then act see then what is acting
[1:09:32] acting is obeying
[1:09:35] see it's revealed to some and not to
[1:09:38] others
[1:09:38] one man can read hebrews 13 8 and say
[1:09:41] jesus christ
[1:09:43] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:09:46] and the carnal mind will say well in a
[1:09:49] way he is
[1:09:50] but the spiritual mind will say in every
[1:09:53] way
[1:09:54] he is the carnal mind will hear
[1:09:57] mark 16 and will say that was for the
[1:10:00] apostles but the spiritual mind will say
[1:10:04] he's the same yesterday
[1:10:11] today and forever into all the world
[1:10:15] and i'm a part of it
[1:10:19] are you hearing me i am a part of it
[1:10:22] see now i want to say like this david or
[1:10:25] rather daniel
[1:10:26] wrote in symbols and the natural human
[1:10:31] mind
[1:10:32] can read the symbols they're reading
[1:10:35] them this morning
[1:10:36] in denominations they're reading the
[1:10:38] symbols this morning
[1:10:39] and let me take a little liberty here
[1:10:41] and say the only reason why people
[1:10:43] that have left the message still claim
[1:10:45] to have a clear understanding
[1:10:46] is because they sat under the message
[1:10:48] long enough to get the benefit of
[1:10:51] understanding
[1:10:54] what can i preach a minute here amen but
[1:10:56] let me just say this
[1:10:58] without this message we are
[1:11:01] confused
[1:11:06] without this message this is still a
[1:11:09] book of symbols
[1:11:10] without this message it's still prophecy
[1:11:13] without this message it's just some
[1:11:16] fancy writings
[1:11:17] amen but with this message it's the
[1:11:19] reality
[1:11:20] of jesus christ it's the revealing of
[1:11:23] the symbols
[1:11:26] [Applause]
[1:11:29] in daniel 2 amen i hope i'm not taking
[1:11:31] too long
[1:11:33] in daniel 2 the bible said that old king
[1:11:36] saw us
[1:11:36] and behold a great image this great
[1:11:38] image whose brightness was excellent
[1:11:40] stood before thee and the form thereof
[1:11:42] was terrible
[1:11:43] this image's head was a fine gold his
[1:11:46] breast
[1:11:47] and his arms of silver his belly and his
[1:11:49] thighs of brass
[1:11:51] his legs of iron his feet part of
[1:11:54] iron and part of clay his feet part of
[1:11:58] iron
[1:11:58] and part of clay thou sawest till that a
[1:12:01] stone
[1:12:02] was cut out without hands
[1:12:07] which smoked the image upon his feet
[1:12:10] that were iron and clay and break them
[1:12:13] to pieces
[1:12:14] now the prophet said did you notice
[1:12:16] right now at the last hour
[1:12:17] when we brought in this last great
[1:12:19] conference watch khrushchev
[1:12:21] and five nations of the east eisenhower
[1:12:25] the leader five nations of the west
[1:12:27] represented
[1:12:28] and the ten toes the image they would
[1:12:30] not mix
[1:12:31] and crucifer took his shoe off and beat
[1:12:34] it
[1:12:35] he said the spiritual mind would pick
[1:12:38] that up quick
[1:12:40] [Music]
[1:12:42] and that's something the spiritual mind
[1:12:45] would pick that up quick
[1:12:46] he said but see the reason they're not
[1:12:49] is because the spiritual mind
[1:12:51] is all muddled up see now notice this
[1:12:54] they will not mix now the next thing is
[1:12:57] the coming of the stone
[1:12:59] we've got brass we've got iron we've got
[1:13:02] clay
[1:13:03] we've got all these things without an
[1:13:05] understanding
[1:13:06] but when a prophet comes he brings an
[1:13:09] understanding
[1:13:10] to the ten toes amen to the iron to the
[1:13:13] clay
[1:13:13] then he brings a revelation to the stone
[1:13:16] and says the next thing is the coming of
[1:13:20] the stone
[1:13:21] he's going to send this angel to what
[1:13:24] church to sodom
[1:13:25] no to the lukewarm no he sent it to the
[1:13:28] elected called
[1:13:30] out church
[1:13:32] [Applause]
[1:13:34] what kind of a sign did he show the same
[1:13:38] thing he did last night god
[1:13:41] elohim manifested in the person of the
[1:13:44] holy ghost
[1:13:46] in his church
[1:13:49] oh my it should send us he said
[1:13:53] a million miles with shouts and praises
[1:13:56] of his glory
[1:13:57] now what is it the carnal mind misses it
[1:14:00] but the spiritual mind
[1:14:02] catches it the word of god always
[1:14:05] attracts the spiritual mind
[1:14:09] because it's the mind of christ in you
[1:14:14] now we've just opened up a beautiful
[1:14:16] channel there and i don't have time to
[1:14:18] preach all of it but i will say this
[1:14:20] it's not you catching these things it's
[1:14:22] the mind
[1:14:24] of christ in you
[1:14:29] catching what's being done in the
[1:14:32] generation you're living in
[1:14:34] see now watch this the carnal mind can
[1:14:37] catch the scientific advancements of the
[1:14:39] day
[1:14:40] right and the spiritual mind can catch
[1:14:43] the spiritual advancements of this day
[1:14:46] he says in the third exodus i hope the
[1:14:48] spiritual mind can catch it
[1:14:49] i'm sure you do amen but i wonder out
[1:14:52] there anyhow you can't visit every
[1:14:54] nation
[1:14:54] you can send tapes to it god will have
[1:14:57] some way
[1:14:58] to catch that mind out there where that
[1:15:00] seed is sowed
[1:15:01] and as soon as the light strikes it it's
[1:15:04] gone
[1:15:04] it takes life like the little woman at
[1:15:07] the well
[1:15:07] she said there it is see the woman at
[1:15:10] the well
[1:15:11] had been under expectation for the
[1:15:13] fulfillment
[1:15:14] of the prophet's words for some 400
[1:15:17] years
[1:15:17] but one day
[1:15:20] [Applause]
[1:15:21] one day sitting at the well the prophet
[1:15:24] said it got in
[1:15:25] he said she said sir i perceive that you
[1:15:28] are a prophet
[1:15:29] see there was a sea lane there
[1:15:33] to come to life there was a switch
[1:15:37] that would turn on lot he said why she
[1:15:40] was looking
[1:15:41] for the manifestation of the word
[1:15:44] 400 years since malachi they had no
[1:15:48] prophets
[1:15:49] and here was a man that manifested to be
[1:15:52] a prophet
[1:15:52] and she said we know that when messiah
[1:15:55] cometh
[1:15:56] that's going to be wanting us he said i
[1:15:59] am he that speaks to you
[1:16:06] i am he that speaks to you
[1:16:09] now he can reveal himself
[1:16:12] she's already received him he's on the
[1:16:16] inside now see he can make
[1:16:19] himself known
[1:16:23] [Music]
[1:16:26] now can i say it like this when jesus
[1:16:28] went and sent by the well
[1:16:30] he didn't go there and sit there that
[1:16:32] morning
[1:16:34] hoping somebody would come by
[1:16:37] [Applause]
[1:16:40] [Music]
[1:16:41] [Applause]
[1:16:43] he was not sitting there hoping
[1:16:47] brother that was the sign that was the
[1:16:50] sign
[1:16:51] he was not sitting there hoping somebody
[1:16:54] would come by
[1:16:55] and catch the significance of him
[1:16:58] sitting at the well
[1:16:59] he knew he
[1:17:02] knew that that woman was coming by
[1:17:05] he knew the hour he knew the minute he
[1:17:08] knew the second
[1:17:09] he knew the day he knew the time
[1:17:12] she was coming by
[1:17:18] there was something in her to catch
[1:17:21] the significance
[1:17:22] [Applause]
[1:17:27] there was something in her to catch the
[1:17:30] significance
[1:17:31] of what he was doing are you hearing me
[1:17:34] now watch this
[1:17:35] god didn't send the marvelous acts into
[1:17:38] this
[1:17:38] age amen hoping somebody
[1:17:41] would catch the significance of it
[1:17:45] [Applause]
[1:17:48] is this okay the cloud over
[1:17:52] sunset mountain he didn't put that there
[1:17:55] hoping somebody would catch the
[1:17:57] significance of it
[1:17:58] the fish on the river he didn't put that
[1:18:01] there
[1:18:02] hoping somebody would catch the
[1:18:04] significance of it
[1:18:05] the sign in the hand was not there
[1:18:08] hoping somebody would catch it but he
[1:18:11] knew
[1:18:12] there was a gene seed that was sown that
[1:18:15] was going to see the sign
[1:18:17] but they were here
[1:18:19] [Applause]
[1:18:21] they would hear the voice are you
[1:18:23] hearing me listen church
[1:18:25] we are in the time we're just seeing the
[1:18:27] sign it's not enough
[1:18:29] we've got to here
[1:18:30] [Applause]
[1:18:37] oh 26 miles high in the shape of a
[1:18:41] pyramid
[1:18:45] are you with me 26 miles high in the
[1:18:48] shape of a pyramid
[1:18:50] hoping somebody would catch a
[1:18:51] significance oh no
[1:18:53] no sir when you saw it in the sky
[1:18:57] if listen the reason it was in the sky
[1:19:00] is because there was a people on the
[1:19:02] earth to receive
[1:19:04] the revelation of what was in the sky
[1:19:09] now are we going to stop there are we
[1:19:12] going to stop there
[1:19:12] no we've got to come to this day we've
[1:19:15] got to come to this hour
[1:19:16] we've got to come to this time and
[1:19:18] realize that jesus christ
[1:19:20] is not here
[1:19:23] in symbol form he's not here in theology
[1:19:27] he's not here in education he is
[1:19:31] here in the form of a message
[1:19:34] to receive the authority and vindication
[1:19:38] of that message
[1:19:39] [Applause]
[1:19:42] now amen i pray this is okay
[1:19:45] the only thing he could do said it at
[1:19:47] that well was be the message
[1:19:49] the only thing he could do was be in his
[1:19:51] place he could not
[1:19:53] fulfill her place she had a part to play
[1:19:57] he had a part to play he fulfilled
[1:20:00] his part now she has got to fulfill
[1:20:04] her part she has got to see her sign
[1:20:06] she's got to see the word
[1:20:08] she's got to receive the word she's got
[1:20:11] to believe the word
[1:20:12] and when she received it when she
[1:20:14] believed it then she obeyed it

[1:24:44] to her future are y'all hearing me
[1:24:47] and what are you saying i'm saying
[1:24:49] william branham's ministry was not just
[1:24:51] the voice of a man
[1:24:52] it was the voice of god not to be
[1:24:55] different
[1:24:55] but to be obedient to claim a vessel on
[1:24:58] the earth
[1:25:01] can i take a few minutes here i'm trying
[1:25:04] to wrap it up
[1:25:06] amen but i feel like preaching here for
[1:25:07] a second the devil's fallen every way he
[1:25:10] couldn't this morning but he's defeated
[1:25:13] do you realize in one man's ministry in
[1:25:16] the ministry of william branham
[1:25:18] he could connect three realms in one in
[1:25:20] one ministry
[1:25:22] past present
[1:25:26] future past
[1:25:29] present future he could have a woman
[1:25:33] standing before him
[1:25:34] and say i see there's a trouble over
[1:25:36] your life here's what it is
[1:25:38] he was bit by a dog as a kid on the way
[1:25:42] home from school
[1:25:42] so he's standing okay
[1:25:46] standing in the present and goes back to
[1:25:49] her past
[1:25:50] and sees it as plain as day and says
[1:25:53] you're running home from school
[1:25:54] and you dr i believe he says you dropped
[1:25:56] your books and the dog
[1:25:57] you got bit by a dog he said and that's
[1:25:59] haunted you all your life
[1:26:01] so he went from the past to the present
[1:26:06] [Music]
[1:26:07] but then he left the present and went
[1:26:09] into the future
[1:26:12] and said but i see you well in the name
[1:26:15] of jesus christ
[1:26:16] [Applause]

[1:26:33] you fell on those steps
[1:26:34] and when you fell on those steps you
[1:26:36] ruptured something in your stomach
[1:26:37] and that's been messed up all these days
[1:26:40] here he is the present
[1:26:41] he says but now i see you and you're

[1:28:18] can i say it like this on about 1100
[1:28:20] tapes
[1:28:24] to the congregation and they had to
[1:28:27] receive it

[1:28:30] on the door
[1:28:31] just because they had the blood of the
[1:28:32] house didn't mean they received nose or
[1:28:34] moses

[1:28:45] building the ark
[1:28:47] have you ever
[1:28:50] have you ever stopped to read all the
[1:28:53] instructions
[1:28:54] was delivered to noah the cubits
[1:28:57] the room the length the depth
[1:29:01] the height what kind of wood to put in
[1:29:03] it how to pitch it within and pitch it
[1:29:05] without
[1:29:06] go get go for it have you ever read all
[1:29:08] that do you realize it works as faith
[1:29:10] expressed the prophet of god said
[1:29:11] and noah being a carpenter
[1:29:17] noah being a carpenter received
[1:29:21] the instructions from the lord
[1:29:24] now how many carpenters no offense how
[1:29:26] many carpenters do you know
[1:29:28] receives the blueprint to a house and
[1:29:31] don't automatically start trying to
[1:29:33] change something
[1:29:36] well we wanted this wide and this on
[1:29:38] well we can cut corner here and we can
[1:29:40] we can take that out and we can add this
[1:29:42] in here we can do this to make it
[1:29:43] cheaper
[1:29:44] try they start trying to trying to
[1:29:46] trying to change it
[1:29:49] do you realize the prophet said had noah
[1:29:51] changed
[1:29:52] one thing on that ark it would have sunk
[1:29:58] but he obeyed the instructions
[1:30:01] from the messenger he received them from
[1:30:06] and here's what i love the prophet said
[1:30:08] after 120 years brother stephen
[1:30:11] of working on that ark and building on
[1:30:13] that ark and building on that ark
[1:30:15] he said all of a sudden they climbed up
[1:30:16] in that ark he said god shut the door
[1:30:19] he said now listen he said now you might
[1:30:21] not known it but there was
[1:30:22] other boats
[1:30:25] he said there was other boats out there
[1:30:27] he said there was men that knew noah was
[1:30:29] a little off in the head
[1:30:30] but they thought you know what he may
[1:30:32] have some truth you know you know
[1:30:34] you the sign was good but when he went
[1:30:36] in the word he went off you know
[1:30:38] so that's what they always say as long
[1:30:40] as brethren was preaching heal all that
[1:30:41] was fine but he went the word he went
[1:30:42] awful actually when he went the word he
[1:30:44] went on and you went off
[1:30:46] free of charge but anyhow
[1:30:49] they said maybe there's something to
[1:30:51] what noah was saying
[1:30:53] maybe we should say they went down they
[1:30:56] built a baptist boat
[1:30:58] they went building a pentecostal boat
[1:31:00] then they got a methodist boat
[1:31:02] they got all kinds of boats they said
[1:31:04] because there just might be something to
[1:31:06] know his thoughts
[1:31:07] on the day when they went in the ark the
[1:31:10] prophet of god said noah's kids climbed
[1:31:12] up in the ark
[1:31:13] and said his daughter-in-law was looking
[1:31:14] out the window and she saw
[1:31:16] all them other boats and the sun was
[1:31:18] still there
[1:31:19] and she said daddy all them other boats
[1:31:22] are still out there
[1:31:22] he said don't worry and about that time
[1:31:25] rain began to fall
[1:31:27] he said it began to fall and he said for
[1:31:29] a little while
[1:31:30] them other boats was okay he said but
[1:31:32] after a while
[1:31:34] the water started coming down and the
[1:31:36] floods started coming up
[1:31:38] and he said little by little by little
[1:31:40] them other boats begin to sink
[1:31:42] they begin to sink they begin to go down
[1:31:44] he said but noah's family
[1:31:46] was inside resting because noah could
[1:31:50] look at his daughters
[1:31:51] and his son her daughter-in-laws and his
[1:31:53] sons and his wife
[1:31:54] and all the animals and say don't worry
[1:31:57] i
[1:31:57] built this boat according to the
[1:32:00] instructions
[1:32:01] of the angel that delivered them to me
[1:32:06] do you realize do you realize what
[1:32:08] happened brother kanema
[1:32:09] you realize what happened i'll tell you
[1:32:11] what happened
[1:32:12] noah's obedience brought a shalom
[1:32:15] to the entire family
[1:32:21] noah's obedience brought an entire
[1:32:24] family
[1:32:25] under a shalom
[1:32:28] well what are you saying i'm saying
[1:32:30] there's some people in the world today
[1:32:32] that don't know if they're boys and they
[1:32:34] don't know if they're girls there's some
[1:32:36] people in the world today

[1:32:53] that has heard the voice of the angel
[1:32:56] and the message has put a shalom

[1:33:32] his own instructions
[1:33:35] before he delivers them
[1:33:36] [Applause]
[1:33:42] let me say this with everything within
[1:33:43] me noah was not building
[1:33:45] that ark hoping it was going
[1:33:49] to float
[1:33:56] them fathers that obeyed moses's message
[1:33:58] and applied the blood over the door
[1:34:00] the prophet god said they were sitting
[1:34:01] there reading the scrolls
[1:34:04] when the death angel come flying through
[1:34:07] the land

[1:34:21] dying the death angel flying through the

[1:35:07] my daughter rest family
[1:35:15] what are you saying brother i'm saying
[1:35:16] this
[1:35:18] we claim to believe the message
[1:35:23] we claim we've received the message of
[1:35:25] malachi 4.
[1:35:28] i've y'all forgive me i've got a whole
[1:35:30] nother part here i didn't get to
[1:35:32] but let me just put it here together
[1:35:35] but have we obeyed
[1:35:38] the message
[1:35:42] [Music]
[1:35:43] we've claimed it's the truth we've taken
[1:35:46] a stand for it
[1:35:48] not to be different but to be obedient
[1:35:54] have we fully obeyed
[1:35:58] the voice of the angel
[1:36:06] as you rest yourself to your feet this
[1:36:08] morning
[1:36:12] he said andrew what are you saying i'm
[1:36:13] saying
[1:36:16] there's a burden on my heart like never
[1:36:18] before brother stephen
[1:36:24] to preach the authority and vindication
[1:36:29] of this message and the power
[1:36:32] behind it like never before
[1:36:40] i was in my office a couple days ago
[1:36:41] reading and studying praying a little
[1:36:43] bit and it come to me
[1:36:45] because it's actually happening right
[1:36:47] around the ranks of our message
[1:36:49] i know the history and what's going on
[1:36:51] here and the things while the church is
[1:36:52] hearing things
[1:36:53] but if the devil if the devil can't get
[1:36:56] you to deny the message
[1:36:58] if he can't get you to come right out
[1:37:00] and say william branham wasn't a prophet
[1:37:01] and the message isn't the truth
[1:37:03] the cloud was nothing but a whatever
[1:37:05] they say it was
[1:37:08] the pillar of fire is nothing if the
[1:37:09] devil can't get you to come out
[1:37:11] and just outright tonight then they'll
[1:37:14] come in and start saying
[1:37:16] well maybe brother brown didn't actually
[1:37:17] mean what he said
[1:37:21] maybe that was a passing comment
[1:37:24] maybe maybe brother adam was influenced
[1:37:26] by by the government and what things
[1:37:28] what was going on around him when he
[1:37:30] said some of those things
[1:37:33] maybe he didn't maybe he didn't mean it
[1:37:40] change one instruction
[1:37:43] and the boat goes to the bottom of the
[1:37:45] ocean
[1:37:45] [Applause]
[1:37:47] change one instruction and the death
[1:37:49] angel takes your oldest son out
[1:37:53] change one instruction and you're going
[1:37:56] to tribulation
[1:38:00] but andrew that's pretty strong i don't
[1:38:01] know how much stronger to say it
[1:38:05] change one thing the angel said
[1:38:09] and bypass the rapture
[1:38:12] bypass the coming of the lord
[1:38:17] somebody said well you don't you only
[1:38:18] say this because because you're just a
[1:38:20] preacher
[1:38:23] i say this because it's my life
[1:38:28] with everything within me i believe this
[1:38:29] message
[1:38:31] is there anybody here today can say lord
[1:38:33] i'm willing to fully obey you
[1:38:35] [Music]
[1:38:38] if a prop if a prophet said something
[1:38:40] and i don't understand it i'll still
[1:38:41] believe it
[1:38:43] i'll still obey it i'll still do it
[1:38:49] there's a man come to me one time
[1:38:50] brother stephen i was preaching about
[1:38:52] robin said something about you know men
[1:38:53] shouldn't wear shorts you know
[1:38:55] he got all tore up i want mercy
[1:38:59] that's kind of weird a guy get all torp
[1:39:00] because he can't wear a pair of shorts
[1:39:01] but anyhow
[1:39:03] i said brother that's what brother brown
[1:39:05] said he said that's brother branham's
[1:39:07] opinion
[1:39:08] i said wait a minute wait a minute wait
[1:39:09] a minute i said brother brown was
[1:39:11] vindicated right
[1:39:13] he said yes i believe that i said you
[1:39:14] believe the pillar of fire vindicated
[1:39:16] yes i believe that
[1:39:17] but that was his opinion i said well if
[1:39:19] he was a vindicated prophet
[1:39:21] and you think that was his opinion then
[1:39:23] i take it as a vindicated opinion
[1:39:28] is that okay i'm not going to the
[1:39:32] tribulation
[1:39:35] i'm going in the rapture i need an angel
[1:39:39] i need a god
[1:39:40] that when i come in the midst of my
[1:39:42] enemies he'll cut him off
[1:39:45] he'll destroy the heavens he'll destroy
[1:39:47] the amorites
[1:39:50] take sickness out of the midst of thee
[1:39:52] bless thy bread
[1:39:54] and thy water can we bow our hearts
[1:39:55] together this morning
[1:39:58] [Music]

[1:56:01] is written as the life of abraham
[1:56:05] abraham journey they're right abraham

[1:56:08] the rod abraham was cooking the wrong
[1:56:11] that's your bible
[1:56:13] when they say brother branham say i was
[1:56:14] coming this morning i saw my wife i
[1:56:17] shook her hand
[1:56:18] why do you have a problem with that and
[1:56:20] you read abraham
[1:56:22] you read isaac playing with his wife

[1:56:40] gonna have a problem with the message
[1:56:42] that's why if you have a problem with
[1:56:44] the message you don't really believe
[1:56:46] your bible
[1:56:47] because it's the same pattern the
[1:56:50] message came from the bible

[1:57:20] paraphrasing

[1:57:26] is to read the bible and to listen to
[1:57:29] the tape
[1:57:30] and you put your car in neutral amen
[1:57:34] when trouble comes when something
[1:57:37] arrives in your life

[1:57:42] scripture
[1:57:43] is coming up do you understand me
[1:57:47] when you feel like a scripture is coming
[1:57:50] back to your memory

[1:58:22] for this case this is the scripture
[1:58:26] you need to use sometimes that scripture
[1:58:30] look contradictory to what you facing
[1:58:34] it is up to you to obey the engine
[1:58:38] just take the bullet and shoot it
[1:58:42] amen don't even think because
[1:58:45] you have this is the reason why people
[1:58:48] fail
[1:58:48] in their christian work amen you don't

[1:58:57] that's not what jesus said
[1:58:59] jesus said i do nothing
[1:59:03] nothing except water
[1:59:06] amen that's the reason why jesus never
[1:59:10] failed
[1:59:11] amen when jesus was going to lazarese
[1:59:16] he was not thinking or having faith
[1:59:19] he's going to raise lazarus he already
[1:59:21] saw it
