[42:47] big amen thank you musician thank you

[42:53] all in the precious name of our Lord and

[43:03] family member here new person first time
[43:07] God richly bless you and welcome to
[43:09] spoken word Tabernacle and uh for the
[43:12] invisible audience I apologize uh last
[43:15] Sunday we had a problem with a computer
[43:18] but thank God we had a backup system so
[43:21] the whole sermon was kept so if you are
[43:24] looking for the sermon on the same under
[43:27] the same link it's now working the
[43:29] sermon has been uploaded Again on
[43:32] YouTube so if you search for Part 41 you
[43:35] will find it it's there and we apologize
[43:37] again by God's grace actually I had a
[43:41] computer bought for two month almost and
[43:44] I left at home and I didn't have a time
[43:47] to get it to work on it so the old Betsy
[43:52] computer that I got used to was already
[43:56] playing around some glitch here and
[43:59] there I say you know what let me keep
[44:01] working with it it's still working so
[44:03] the mask was not working properly and I
[44:05] use the manual one and then keep moving
[44:08] until last Sunday so I got my message
[44:11] like it's over and enough it's enough go
[44:15] ahead and switch the computer and get a
[44:17] brand new one amen so by God's grace I
[44:20] did everything last night and he works I
[44:23] believe the day before last night it
[44:25] works perfect everything is working
[44:27] smoothly without any problem so all is
[44:30] well
[44:34] amen Oh Glory to God so for some reason
[44:38] I don't know why the Lord allowed that
[44:40] but he didn't want that sermon to be
[44:42] preached last Sunday he pushed
[44:44] everything this coming Sunday today amen
[44:48] so I believe we up to date with the
[44:50] sermon we reading our Bible twice a day
[44:53] I even heard uh brother brandham saying
[44:55] you need to study the Bible true so now
[44:58] it's not just reading the Bible now it's
[45:00] now to study the Bible amen he didn't
[45:04] say brother study the Bible because the
[45:08] tendency is that's for brother and the
[45:10] sister completely Escape he said you
[45:12] need to study the Bible so brother and
[45:14] sister you need to study the Bible amen
[45:18] and then I believe we're reading our
[45:19] cood book our church ages 70 weeks of
[45:22] Daniel the seals adoption or somebody is
[45:26] listening to the message of the hour
[45:28] amen just to give some
[45:30] clarification this coming Tuesday which
[45:33] is December the
[45:35] 31st that will be our new year service
[45:38] and that is considered to be our midweek
[45:42] service so meaning we don't have service
[45:45] on Wednesday so Wednesday you stay with
[45:48] your family spend some quality time and
[45:52] uh catch up and make some uh uh sit down
[45:57] and draw some plans for
[46:01] 2025 and what you're going to be
[46:03] accomplishing by the grace of God and
[46:05] talk things over and iron things and
[46:08] clean up everything and we move on Amen
[46:11] so it will be this coming Tuesday at
[46:14] 8:00 p.m. so we start not at 7:30 at
[46:17] 8:00 p.m. all the way to midnight so we
[46:21] already start having that flavor of
[46:23] magnify the Lord so you can feel that
[46:26] atmosphere of worship amen and Lord's
[46:29] willing we will have also the Lord
[46:31] supper we clear on that one so 8:00 p.m.
[46:34] we see you all the way to midnight so if
[46:37] you need to eat make sure you eat you
[46:39] relax at home so we get here until 2025
[46:44] the only thing that's going to stop is
[46:45] if the Lord comes then we leave
[46:47] everything and we go home amen and then
[46:51] on the oncoming year I don't have any
[46:54] date for question and answer yet brother
[46:56] Glenn is still working on it but the
[46:59] young man is on February the the 1st the
[47:02] young sister is on February the 22nd and
[47:05] the married couple is on March the 22nd
[47:09] which is going to be part five Lord's
[47:12] willing amen so you pray for us we got a
[47:16] lot to do this year I'm in a silent mode
[47:19] like I say all we have is whatever we
[47:22] have and faith and the Lord will provide
[47:26] because he is Jehovah jarra the way we
[47:30] operate in this church is completely a
[47:32] miracle and the way this church stand
[47:35] and move and accomplish things it is
[47:38] nothing but a miracle of God the credit
[47:42] is not to me the credit is unto the Lord
[47:45] Jesus Christ amen so we thank the Lord
[47:48] for everything that he have done for us
[47:50] until today and he will do more again if
[47:54] he tell you to come amen so this sermon
[47:57] today it's a little bit deeper okay all
[48:02] right so you stay tuned stay alert and
[48:08] I'll try the best that I can because
[48:11] it's easier to preach a sermon quickly
[48:13] and then we go and we assume that
[48:16] everybody got it but by the end of the
[48:18] day after 10 years of message you sit
[48:21] with people you talk to them you wonder
[48:24] how many sermon book did they read
[48:29] my friend you got the microphone amen
[48:32] you cannot be in this message 30 years
[48:35] and you already and you only read only
[48:38] 10 sermon something is wrong oh you
[48:41] listen only to five sermon something is
[48:44] wrong amen if you're 30 years you you
[48:47] you you you you should be done by the
[48:49] churches the 70 weeks all those things
[48:53] should be clarified and I know why I
[48:55] insist on the church ages because it's
[48:57] like a
[48:58] foundation Amen brother brandham uses so
[49:01] many scripture and the det and so many
[49:05] Doctrine and lay the ground correctly so
[49:08] if you don't have that you are actually
[49:10] in the air you don't even know how to
[49:12] fight for yourself amen so we will go
[49:16] slowly today and try to make sure we get
[49:20] down to where we going amen amen you
[49:22] know I came back up I'm under commission
[49:25] I was trying to preach this it didn't
[49:27] work out so by God's grace I don't have
[49:30] any choice he might hurt but if it hurts
[49:34] that's okay I'm on the commission I got
[49:37] to deliver the message of the hour Amen
[49:40] brother Bram say his ministry is
[49:43] different than Oro Robert he say Oro
[49:46] Robert he line up people lay hand on
[49:48] them and then they go and then tomorrow
[49:51] they can go back again in trouble
[49:53] brother Bram say but that's not the way
[49:55] his ministry is he say his ministry he
[49:58] need to find the
[50:00] cause of the problem because under the
[50:04] anointing the devil can go and wait for
[50:07] you outside of the church and as soon as
[50:10] you come outside of the church the Devil
[50:12] comes back again because the root have
[50:14] not been removed are we together so we
[50:18] if we don't go deep in the root to catch
[50:22] whatever is troubling Us in the root we
[50:25] will never be a bble to remove it that's
[50:27] why certain Spirit linger in this
[50:30] message because they were not dealt with
[50:33] all the way to the root amen and every
[50:36] time you try to go deep in the root then
[50:40] the first thing is preacher will attack
[50:42] you saying that okay we can have all
[50:45] this knowledge but uh uh you can have
[50:49] all this knowledge but what about life
[50:51] yes we have
[50:53] life amen if you have a problem with
[50:57] knowledge then you have a problem with
[50:58] brother
[50:59] Bram because the knowledge we have in
[51:02] this message was preached by Brother
[51:04] Bram and if you have a problem with what
[51:06] was preached by Brother Branham then you
[51:08] don't even believe the
[51:10] message maybe you staying in the message
[51:12] for a
[51:14] paycheck are we together are we together
[51:17] I didn't preach the seals brother
[51:19] Brandon preach it I didn't preach the 70
[51:22] weeks of Daniel he preaching he preached
[51:25] Revelation one Revelation 4 Revelation
[51:28] that big knowledge deep that we have
[51:31] comes from the message of the hour and
[51:34] you hear people in the message okay do
[51:36] we need all this knowledge to go to the
[51:38] Rapture of course you do do you think
[51:41] God was wasting his
[51:43] time and usually if you chase down you
[51:46] will find they already struggling in
[51:49] their walk with the
[51:51] Lord amen if what we need is give our
[51:55] life to the Lord
[51:57] and then be baptized you already did it
[51:59] so we might just stay at
[52:01] home amen and God wasted his time from
[52:06] 1933 all the way to
[52:09] 1965 something is wrong with you amen my
[52:14] people
[52:17] perish amen amen for lack of knowledge
[52:22] and the Bible say my people go to
[52:24] captivity because of lack of knowledge
[52:28] and God brought us the clear pure
[52:31] knowledge of the word of God by the
[52:33] message of the hour and the first thing
[52:36] we go is well it's
[52:39] intellectual so brother Bram is the
[52:42] greatest
[52:43] intellectual because he's the one that
[52:45] started with it I'm only under
[52:47] commission to repeat brother brandham
[52:50] amen a jealousy spirit
[52:56] amen if you cannot dig where somebody's
[53:00] digging stay where you are but
[53:02] appreciate the other
[53:05] person amen sister y cannot sing here
[53:09] with us I mean brother set and she
[53:12] cannot sing without the drummer she
[53:15] cannot sing without the one playing the
[53:17] guitar you need

[53:23] one playing the guitar say she's not
[53:25] singing good you got a problem we need
[53:28] you you need her you need brother John
[53:30] you need the song leader everybody is
[53:33] needed amen amen amen amen so stay in
[53:38] tune and let's dig right deep and see
[53:42] what is coming up today amen amen praise
[53:44] be to the name of the Lord glory to God
[53:47] my computer is working nice and smooth

[54:23] there and then when we climb we climb
[54:26] before we get 3 hours somehow brother
[54:28] Robert knows what I'm talking about
[54:30] brother Glenn knows what I'm talking
[54:31] about usually I don't even pray and you
[54:34] see a Deliverance breaking down because
[54:37] we learn by the prophet to go down in
[54:40] the root if not you will be playing

[55:06] we are preaching you to be independent
[55:09] between you and God of course the pastor
[55:13] will continue to be there but you must
[55:15] have a personal relationship between you
[55:18] and
[55:20] God so if you call me I cannot answer

[57:41] everything you have been doing for us
[57:43] father this is as far as I can go with
[57:46] the ability you have given us Lord but
[57:48] when it comes to preach to interpret
[57:50] your word Lord Lord father you only take
[57:53] the supernatural action of the Holy
[57:56] Spirit Lord may you move me completely
[57:58] out of the way and this audience both
[58:00] visible and invisible and those that
[58:03] would listen let the Lord father that

[58:50] amen the deeper your relationship with
[58:54] God
[58:56] the more your life changes
[58:58] correct amen amen if not brother Bram
[59:02] life would not have changed because when
[59:04] he get to the depth to the third pool
[59:06] the opening of the word then he got to a
[59:08] higher depth with the Lord you shall
[59:11] know the truth and the truth not the
[59:16] preacher the truth will set you free so
[59:20] our responsibility is to present the
[59:23] truth and let the truth deal with with
[59:26] you and you will be
[59:28] free amen if not we're playing
[59:31] Pentecostal
[59:33] games amen amen God stands in the
[59:38] congregation of the mighty and he judges
[59:42] among the gods you might be seated verse
[59:46] six I have said can you hear me okay
[59:50] amen I have said ye are
[59:54] gods and all of you are children of the
[59:58] most high amen amen this one we already
[1:00:03] explained this multiple time that this
[1:00:06] is verse six is a Divine record or a
[1:00:09] Divine part of
[1:00:11] you amen we are Gods it's deity amen
[1:00:17] this record is
[1:00:19] clean amen there is no floss to this
[1:00:22] record amen amen
[1:00:26] amen verse uh six and all of you are
[1:00:31] children of the most high but the one
[1:00:35] who's talking is God through
[1:00:37] prophecy but you shall die like
[1:00:42] men so the death doesn't Surpise God
[1:00:46] because God already know it's going to
[1:00:47] happen the one who say but it's God so
[1:00:51] God sees the trouble before he gets to
[1:00:54] you are we together
[1:00:56] God sees the trial before you get there
[1:00:59] God already seen it together he told
[1:01:01] Israel you're going to go in Egypt you
[1:01:04] will Sur there for 400 years and you
[1:01:07] will be slave over there and it happened
[1:01:10] and God spoke before Israel even went to
[1:01:13] Egypt so God already knows our
[1:01:17] journey before we even
[1:01:19] start are we together amen and he says
[1:01:23] and and if God already seen your tribe
[1:01:26] do you think that God will just fold his
[1:01:29] hand and be quiet matter of fact when a
[1:01:33] trial is
[1:01:34] disclosed or when a TR when uh when a
[1:01:38] when a trouble is already unveil it
[1:01:41] means there is already a
[1:01:43] solution are we together when the dream
[1:01:46] of pharaoh is
[1:01:48] interpreted he already give the solution
[1:01:51] for what is coming back what is coming
[1:01:53] down the road amen because God already
[1:01:56] saw it he saw what the enemy will do in
[1:02:00] your life it is not your fight it is the
[1:02:05] fight between God and Satan you are just
[1:02:08] put in the middle of the road and God
[1:02:12] and Satan are playing tag tag of War but
[1:02:16] we know who's going to win God in you
[1:02:21] Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:02:28] are we together he says and but you
[1:02:32] shall die like men and fall like one of
[1:02:35] the what princes so this one verse seven
[1:02:39] glory to God is your Earthly
[1:02:43] part amen this has to do with your
[1:02:47] flesh with your carnal
[1:02:50] nature amen so God already saw it just
[1:02:54] like he say I love
[1:02:56] Jacob amen before Jacob was even
[1:03:00] born are we together and I Can Am I this
[1:03:04] might shock you but I don't have any
[1:03:05] choice amen this part of you doesn't
[1:03:11] [Applause]
[1:03:15] S are we
[1:03:19] together are we together
[1:03:25] [Music]
[1:03:27] it's so sad that we preach the message
[1:03:31] for so long and the people in the
[1:03:33] message are so confused when the devil
[1:03:36] beat them
[1:03:42] down I'm sorry but I'm going to say
[1:03:46] this okay I just explained to somebody
[1:03:49] recently I'm just going to say this amen
[1:03:53] amen if you we have a
[1:03:57] sister okay a
[1:03:59] sister all right if we have a sister

[1:12:12] does what remain in him so the problem
[1:12:15] is not this envelope it is the
[1:12:19] seed and brother said that seed is the

[1:29:53] have seen a against heaven and to your
[1:29:55] sight but if you notice the sin he did
[1:29:58] it when he was not in himself so he did
[1:30:02] it by
[1:30:06] Ignorance by
[1:30:08] Amnesia he was not in himself he was not
[1:30:11] in the right man are we together because
[1:30:15] if he was in the right man he would not
[1:30:17] have done it that's why he said I am not
[1:30:20] worthy to be called your son in other
[1:30:23] word I read as a father like you cannot
[1:30:26] have a son that have done things the way

[1:30:35] part is the one that enjoy with the
[1:30:38] Harlot are we together and the Bible
[1:30:41] says verse 22 but the father say to the
[1:30:46] servant bring forth the best R and put

[1:31:07] the the the the fatted Cal was already
[1:31:09] there but he could not be killed until
[1:31:13] he come
[1:31:14] [Music]
[1:31:16] to so there is a provided
[1:31:21] sacrifice amen
[1:31:24] when the boy was sinning back there amen
[1:31:27] and he have to be freshly
[1:31:31] killed remember that my friend amen they
[1:31:35] cannot use the old food that they cook
[1:31:38] yesterday amen this son require a fresh
[1:31:43] atonement a fresh food are we together
[1:31:47] and kill it and let us eat and be what
[1:31:50] married for this my son was what
[1:31:54] and he's now what alive again let's look
[1:31:56] at this scripture the son was dead and
[1:32:01] he's what
[1:32:03] alive dead and alive speak of a
[1:32:08] resurrection are we together and then he
[1:32:11] was what lost and what and is found this
[1:32:16] is those that are
[1:32:17] living amen amen the Bible didn't say he
[1:32:20] was lost and found and then dead and
[1:32:24] laugh the Bible say he was dead and
[1:32:28] alive then he was what and what dead and
[1:32:32] the life come
[1:32:34] first the one who Who start the
[1:32:38] Rapture is the dead in
[1:32:41] Christ I don't know if
[1:32:44] we the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:32:49] first then the living will be quickened
[1:32:52] that's why the Bible say dead and alive
[1:32:55] first then lost and found second it is
[1:32:59] the order of the Rapture
[1:33:02] [Applause]
[1:33:03] Hallelujah are we together if I lost you
[1:33:07] raise your
[1:33:08] hand L somebody in the back the Bible
[1:33:12] says one dead and alive which which
[1:33:16] speak about the resurrection because we
[1:33:18] got sent that were dead that need to be
[1:33:21] resurrected and the Bible say is then
[1:33:24] lost and found these are those that are
[1:33:27] living amen because when you dead you
[1:33:30] gone but the Bible instead of saying
[1:33:33] lost and found dead and alive he start
[1:33:36] first with dead and alive amen then lost
[1:33:40] and found because according to the
[1:33:42] Rapture those that died are going to be
[1:33:45] resurrected first they the one that
[1:33:48] change
[1:33:50] first and then the living will be Chang
[1:33:54] after so this scripture is giving you
[1:33:57] the order of the Rapture or the order of
[1:34:01] the
[1:34:04] Resurrection are we clear we're going to
[1:34:06] get into that thank you my

[1:35:32] God are we together now when it come to
[1:35:36] the scene of
[1:35:38] ignorance are we together then the

[1:35:55] my
[1:35:56] friend Lord have
[1:35:59] mercy Judges 13 if you move quickly so
[1:36:03] we can
[1:36:05] go we very good
[1:36:09] on and usually when I say this that's
[1:36:11] when
[1:36:16] times let's go judges 13:14 if you
[1:36:20] thereare you can say amen amen please
[1:36:22] follow me carefully y okay verse 14 this
[1:36:26] is the story about the parent of
[1:36:30] Samson it's manoah and his wife okay
[1:36:34] follow me carefully verse
[1:36:36] 14 she this is the Angel of the Lord
[1:36:39] talking let's go to 13 so you get the
[1:36:41] picture and the angel of the Lord said
[1:36:43] to manoah the father of Samson Samson of
[1:36:48] all that I say to the woman let her be
[1:36:50] aware beware she may not eat of anything
[1:36:54] that comes of the
[1:36:56] vine amen neither let her drink wine or
[1:37:01] strong drink it's a Nazar vow nor eat
[1:37:04] any unclean thing all that I commanded
[1:37:06] her let her observe verse 15 and manoah
[1:37:12] said to the angel of the Lord follow me
[1:37:14] my friend I pray you let us detain you
[1:37:19] in either word keep you until we have
[1:37:22] made ready a what kid a kid for you so
[1:37:28] after the angel of the Lord delivered
[1:37:30] the message they wanted to offer a
[1:37:33] sacrifice to this Angel of the Lord and
[1:37:36] remember Samson came from the tribe of
[1:37:41] them it's in your Bible you can verify
[1:37:44] this verse at home I'm trying to save
[1:37:45] time are we together and then he says
[1:37:49] we're going to give him a kid which is a
[1:37:50] goat amen so this off in is a
[1:37:58] goat we clear a kid for you and the
[1:38:03] angel of the Lord said to manoah though
[1:38:06] you detain me in other word even though
[1:38:08] you keep me I will not eat of your bread
[1:38:12] because the form that God appear here he
[1:38:16] appears as an angel and an angel doesn't
[1:38:20] eat natural food right God eat only when
[1:38:25] he veil in human flesh and I'm going to
[1:38:29] go there and you will see what did God
[1:38:31] eat we will get there slowly my friend
[1:38:34] are we together are we together but in
[1:38:37] an Angelic form God cannot eat anything
[1:38:41] that's why Jesus told the disciple a
[1:38:43] ghost a spirit doesn't have Flesh and
[1:38:46] Blood give me a piece of chicken they
[1:38:48] give him uh I mean fish and he took the
[1:38:50] fish I say chicken for our day uh so
[1:38:52] don't come and say where did he say
[1:38:54] chicken they say fish and they give him
[1:38:56] a fish and he ate are we together now he
[1:38:59] says though you detain me I will not eat
[1:39:02] of the of your bread and if you will
[1:39:05] offer a burnt offering you must offer it
[1:39:09] to the Lord for manoah knew not that he
[1:39:13] was an angel of the Lord you're going to
[1:39:16] see that it's the
[1:39:18] angel they call him sometime an angel
[1:39:20] you remember last
[1:39:22] Sunday vers uh uh uh 17 and man Noah
[1:39:27] said to who the angel did they say an
[1:39:30] angel again so the angel of the Lord is
[1:39:32] God he say to the angel of the Lord what
[1:39:36] is your
[1:39:38] name that when you that when your saying

[1:41:20] took a kid with a meat offering and
[1:41:23] offer it upon a what rock
[1:41:27] remember yes sir plus all of this
[1:41:32] happened on a

[1:42:25] toward Heaven from off the altar that
[1:42:27] the angel of the Lord ascended in the
[1:42:31] flame of the Altar and Mano and his wife

[1:43:18] liquid what pror is trying to say is
[1:43:21] there is no drink

[1:43:26] offering because God you could worship
[1:43:29] him with a liquid it was called a drink
[1:43:32] offering the offering could be a bread
[1:43:35] and a meat I'm in The Book of Leviticus
[1:43:37] my friend so let's go slowly amen or you
[1:43:40] can bring a liquid and it's called a
[1:43:43] drink offering sir are we together let's
[1:43:45] go to Judges chapter 6 my friend so we
[1:43:47] can go verse one and the children of
[1:43:50] Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord
[1:43:53] amen amen and the Lord delivered them
[1:43:56] into the hand of Midian how many years

[1:44:08] Israel made them the dens which were in
[1:44:11] the mountains and cave and stronghold
[1:44:14] verse three and so it was when Israel
[1:44:17] has s that the midianite came up and the
[1:44:21] amalik and the children of the
[1:44:23] even they came up against them and they
[1:44:25] encamp against them and destroyed the

[2:05:03] spiritual
[2:05:05] Revelation on which the church is what
[2:05:08] built remember this church must be built
[2:05:11] upon the rock on a spiritual Revelation
[2:05:16] on the top of the rock not the bottom
[2:05:19] but the top on the seven Church ages
[2:05:23] with the seven years
[2:05:29] Bullock are we together my friend amen

[2:05:41] revelation of the will and the what word
[2:05:44] of God of a sacrifice that God was
[2:05:47] pleased with it and now
[2:05:52] [Music]
[2:05:55] I believe that is the day that we are
[2:05:58] living in now
[2:06:02] also we are building our churches upon
[2:06:06] the revelation of the word of God which
[2:06:10] is the message of the
[2:06:12] [Applause]
[2:06:16] hour remember the remember the vision of
[2:06:20] Jin Jackson the top was ripped off
[2:06:23] that's why you put the church where the
[2:06:26] capson is because over
[2:06:30] there Bard don't get
[2:06:34] there a Hulk doesn't get there when a
[2:06:37] Hulk get there they begin to get
[2:06:41] blind they cannot see what we see it is
[2:06:46] too high too deep they cannot reach
[2:06:50] there
[2:06:54] the Revelation blurs
[2:06:58] [Applause]
[2:07:00] them are we together are we together
[2:07:03] they can clam with you on what is the
[2:07:05] Holy Ghost what is the baptism in the
[2:07:08] name of Jesus Christ and they can clam
[2:07:10] with you but when you get to the deeper
[2:07:13] higher then they say do we need this to
[2:07:15] go to the Rapture I cannot see what why
[2:07:19] why those Ember those justment s the
[2:07:22] stone all these things here it's the
[2:07:24] heights of
[2:07:25] [Applause]
[2:07:29] God are we together are we together are
[2:07:33] we
[2:07:35] together so why
[2:07:37] B why bail brother Bram says this my
[2:07:41] friend everything that is on Earth
[2:07:45] today in the way of what spiritual
[2:07:48] things such as the spirit of God and the
[2:07:51] Spirit of the devil and all the
[2:07:55] coats and everything that we have today
[2:07:59] in the world they begin where in Genesis
[2:08:02] Genesis means what the beginning and all
[2:08:05] those things yet under what another name
[2:08:09] and under what another form but what the
[2:08:12] Same Spirit The Same Spirit that began
[2:08:15] where in Genesis in other words the name
[2:08:18] used there won't be the name used today
[2:08:22] but the spirit will be the
[2:08:26] same if you trust by the name you will
[2:08:30] worship
[2:08:32] Satan you need to trust by the spirit
[2:08:36] and the manifestation to recognize who's
[2:08:39] working there that's right brother Bram
[2:08:43] say the anointing of Elijah was the
[2:08:46] spirit of
[2:08:49] Christ if you need the C you see me
[2:08:52] after church it's under the seven seal
[2:08:54] are we together but when that anointing
[2:08:58] got into the man Elijah he picked up the
[2:09:01] name
[2:09:04] Elijah are we together when that
[2:09:07] anointing left Elijah and move on he
[2:09:11] pick up the name
[2:09:13] Elisha but he was the Same
[2:09:16] Spirit are we together when he left
[2:09:19] Elisha and he went to another person he
[2:09:23] picked up the name John the
[2:09:26] Baptist but he was the Same Spirit but a
[2:09:30] different name and today that anointing
[2:09:34] picked up
[2:09:36] William
[2:09:42] Mar it is still the spirit of Elijah but
[2:09:46] under a different name so it's still the
[2:09:49] same God but they
[2:09:52] form they form and the name
[2:09:57] change Elijah didn't wear a
[2:10:01] suit he had a mental the form changes
[2:10:05] the name changes from Elijah to Elisha
[2:10:09] to John the Baptist to William Maran
[2:10:13] Bram when I say that I'm even excited
[2:10:16] because it's my
[2:10:18] time hallah
[2:10:21] [Applause]
[2:10:23] [Music]
[2:10:25] if he doesn't except you that's your
[2:10:27] problem if you think we are worshiping
[2:10:29] brother Bram we not worshiping him we
[2:10:32] worshiping Jesus Christ and brother Bram
[2:10:35] is his Prophet vated
[2:10:38] [Music]
[2:10:38] [Applause]
[2:10:42] Prophet are we together are we together
[2:10:45] so Spirit changes name changes form but
[2:10:49] it's still the same spirit so when we
[2:10:52] say B that's in the Bible we need to
[2:10:55] find B
[2:10:56] [Applause]

[2:59:54] choose the first one the first is for
[2:59:58] B but the second one is for the Lord
[3:00:02] Elijah say you

[3:00:08] bulock is where God

[3:00:21] give us what two Bullock my friend you

[3:02:29] choose you one Bullock for yourself and
[3:02:32] dress it first did you see why is Elijah
[3:02:36] pushing them to go first because the
[3:02:39] first Bullock is not to the Lord the
[3:02:41] first belong to B it is the seven bulock
[3:02:45] it is the second bulock of seven years
[3:02:48] that belong to the Lord so Elijah say go

[3:03:13] which was given to them and dress it and
[3:03:16] call on the name of bear from morning
[3:03:19] until until noon saying oh B he has but
[3:03:25] there was no voice nor any answer and
[3:03:28] they leap upon the altar which was made
[3:03:31] and came and it came to pass at noon
[3:03:34] what a
[3:03:35] prayer what a
[3:03:37] Zeal huh maybe some were speaking in
[3:03:40] tongue
[3:03:43] already that elah mock them
[3:03:48] it's not me I'm reading the
[3:03:50] Bible oh no Elijah pray for
[3:03:57] them so I won't say what you want me to
[3:04:00] say I say what the Bible say Elijah mark
[3:04:04] them amen amen and say cry loud C for he
[3:04:09] is a God either he's talking or he's
[3:04:12] pursuing or he's in a journey or perhaps
[3:04:16] he's sleep and must be
[3:04:19] what let me leave those things because
[3:04:22] those things are one thing after the
[3:04:23] other because God our God one time was
[3:04:26] sleeping and they have to wake him up
[3:04:29] and brother Brandon preach a message go
[3:04:31] awake Jesus but let's leave it alone and
[3:04:34] they cried loud and did what cut
[3:04:37] themselves after their manner with
[3:04:39] knives and lens till the blood goash out
[3:04:43] upon them and it come to pass when
[3:04:46] midday was passed that they
[3:04:50] prophesy you see prophecy prophesying
[3:04:55] until the time of the
[3:04:58] offering of the evening sacrifice not
[3:05:02] the morning sacrifice in the evening
[3:05:05] time in the evening time there shall be
[3:05:08] light are we together and there was
[3:05:11] neither voice nor any answer nor any
[3:05:15] that regarded and Elijah said to all the
[3:05:18] people come near unto
[3:05:22] me watch and all the
[3:05:25] people came near everybody obey in other
[3:05:30] word Elijah just stood and say all of
[3:05:33] you
[3:05:36] here
[3:05:38] everybody are we
[3:05:41] together we clear watch verse 30 I'm
[3:05:44] about to finish and all the people came
[3:05:47] near him
[3:05:49] and he
[3:05:51] rep the
[3:05:53] altar of the Lord that was what broken
[3:05:57] down in other word Elijah rebuilt yes he
[3:06:01] did yes he did the altar on top of
[3:06:07] mon Elijah rebuilt the altar on top of
[3:06:14] mon on top of the mountain you put an
[3:06:17] alter there there was an altar there on
[3:06:21] top of the mountain and Gideon had an
[3:06:23] altar on top of the mountain and you put
[3:06:26] Stone then wood then a bulock Elijah
[3:06:31] already have a
[3:06:33] Bullock and it was the second bulock ah
[3:06:37] we clear now and he repaired the altar
[3:06:40] of the Lord that was broken
[3:06:42] down verse 31 and Elijah took 12 stone
[3:06:46] according to the number you must follow
[3:06:49] the order remember Gideon of the tribe
[3:06:51] of the sons of Jacob to whom the word of
[3:06:54] the Lord came saying Israel shall be
[3:06:56] called your name and with the stone he
[3:06:59] built like Gideon an altar in the name
[3:07:03] of the Lord and he made a trench about
[3:07:06] the altar as great as would contain two
[3:07:10] measures of
[3:07:11] seed and he
[3:07:14] put if you notice the measure is the
[3:07:17] measure
[3:07:18] of a
[3:07:20] seed and the seed was the meat
[3:07:25] offering the meat offering came as a
[3:07:27] seed a flour or it was cake I mean bake
[3:07:31] are we together so they measuring the
[3:07:33] trench based on the meat offering are we
[3:07:37] together and he says and he put the wood
[3:07:40] in order remember Gideon alar have wood
[3:07:43] he have stone and wood and then the
[3:07:45] bulock same thing to destroy B and he

[3:08:07] water what makes this water an
[3:08:10] offering because it was 3 and a half
[3:08:15] year there was no rain
[3:08:18] so water became
[3:08:20] precious so taking water and pour
[3:08:24] precious water on the ground becomes a
[3:08:27] drink offering remember David one time
[3:08:30] was thirsty and he sent his men to
[3:08:33] Bethlehem and when they brought him
[3:08:36] water David P water on the ground as a
[3:08:39] drink

[3:08:54] wood and he said verse 34
[3:08:57] what time they poured the water the
[3:09:00] first time and they did it which
[3:09:02] time and they did it the second time and

[3:10:15] of Abraham Isaac and Israel let it be
[3:10:18] done known this day that you are God in
