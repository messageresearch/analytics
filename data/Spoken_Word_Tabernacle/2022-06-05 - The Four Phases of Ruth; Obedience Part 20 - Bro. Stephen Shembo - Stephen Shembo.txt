man we don't want somebody to be treated vip and another one down no we want to make sure everybody is treated the same because we will be wearing the same robe everybody okay everybody okay what i have is loaded body so you better shake yourself let's go to first samuel chapter 10 you should be even more happy i'm in a hot seat my seat is more harder than yours everybody okay because i'm trying to deliver a big load into a squeeze time brother david everything back so the brother who is streaming i'm sorry i was just giving some announcement i hope the volume is back if your volume is not back trying to go out and refresh again because we were told that one person did lost the volume and they lost it so just make sure everybody's there first samuel chapter 10. if you're there you can say amen i want you to stay alert and stay really tight so we can get this together you ready verse one then samuel took a vial of oil and poured it on he upon his head the head of saul and kissed him and said is it not because the lord has anointed you to be captain over his inheritance this is not the baptism of the holy spirit this is a consecration as a king anybody care everybody cares so far so the spirit of the lord is commanded to come on the life of saul because what i'm saying that's the reason why we are known to the sick it's a representation of the spirit amen everybody okay so far now watch out carefully let me you may be seated after the finish this is what is following when you are departed from me everybody okay so far today then you shall find two men by water so when you leaving me samuel you will find two men not three by rachel sepulcher or rachel's tomb everybody okay in the border of benjamin at zilsa and they will say to you the asses which you went to seek are found because the assets of uh our soul's father were lost but those two men has a message they do have a message and their message is that what was lost are we up i can't preach in a quiet environment what was lost is water everybody okay so far make sure you got your bible body especially young folks what was lost is found amen and lo your father have left the care or he stopped worrying about have left the care of the asses he stopped worrying about the asses and sorrow for you saying what shall i do for my so the worry is no more about the access that was found but the worry now it's about saul himself what is going on here give me time because i cannot rush in this everybody okay they told samuel that the first step in his work the first step in his walk he's gonna leave samuel saul and then when he goes he will enter he will reach rachel's tomb and he will see two men by the tomb and those two men by the tomb have a message and the message is whatever was lost is found you know we are in the tabernacle this is the other court there is a present altar right here everybody okay followed by a lever everybody okay when you enter the holy place you have the candlestick everybody okay then you have the table of the showbread then you have the altar of incense and then into the holiest you have the ark of the covenant with the mercy seat and the caribbean everybody okay so far why does saul have to reach rachel's tomb first what happened in rachel's tomb anybody knows what happened in rachel's tomb anybody the bible says in genesis 35 verse 16 that jacob was journeying with his family and the bible say and the journey from bethel and there was by the leader way to come to ephrath which is uh bethlehem ephrata and rachel did water so rachel as they were going closer to ephrata or bethlehem rachel was pregnant rachel was pregnant and rachel was pregnant with a son and what was his name everybody okay which tribe did saul came out of it everybody okay everybody okay now we trapped the soul came out of it when you look at the scripture superficially you will come up with a everybody okay so rachel travail she needed to give birth and she had easy labor she had a hard or difficult labor in other words it was a difficult time everybody here for rachel pregnant hallelujah he says and he came to pass when she was in hard labor that the midwife said unto her fear not that shall have this son also so not only was rachel pregnant or traveling but rachel was giving birth but it was a painful birth everybody okay and it came to pass as her soul was wet so the birth of rachel was combined with her death yes everybody okay hallelujah i'm lucky because now you're stretching already anybody okay for she did water she died that she called his name ben oni which means the son of masoro but his father called him benjamin which means the son of my right hand in other words the son of my power everybody okay and richard died and was buried in the way to ephra which is water and jacob set up a pillar upon her grave that is the pillars of rachel's grave unto this so the third song that when you are leaving from uh samuel the first son you will see two men by rachel's tomb everybody okay now we well we know now that rachel's tomb have a story everybody okay the story of wretched tomb is that rachel was traveling rachel was giving birth everybody here and the same time she was giving birth she was also dying anybody care so the one giving birth is also the one dying everybody okay so far everybody okay so far in other words when they reach the tomb of rapture her water broke everybody okay so water came out of rachel and blood came out of rachel then a baby was born and the birth of the baby was connected to the death of the one giving birth [Applause] everybody okay so far everybody okay so far because one day there was somebody that was also pregnant and he was pregnant with his own pride [Applause] [Music] everybody okay and then he went on the cross of calvary and then on the cross of governing he was dying in travail of giving birth and the preaching on the side and water was coming out and blood was coming out and the baby was coming up and the one who was giving birth was actually dying everybody okay and they put them in the tomb and in that tomb there were two people [Applause] there were two angels that they were seeking you delivering among them the one you are looking is already out [Music] did i lose anybody the opening of the seventh seal the bible became anew [Music] in the tabernacle where are we here any question let's go with our reading verse 3 if you dare you can say amen then shall you go forward from there and you shall come to the plan of water table and they shall meet you how many men you see why i told you to stay alert they said meet you how many people three men going up to who somebody called it going up to him am i reading a different bible going up

another carrying three loaves of bread and another carrying a bottle of water and they will salute you and give you water [Music] why two two rules everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay did i

front of me still flying everybody okay the airplane of business the airplane of hattafar how when is he gonna finish the airplane as i i left my clothing i need to do them all those airplanes need to go quick you there esther chapter 2 verse 8 you there so it came to pass when the king's commandment and his degree was heard and when many men were gathered together to shoot underwater the palace to the custody of hege that esther was brought also to the king's house to the custody of reggae keeper of the women everybody cares so far jump to verse 10 esther had not showed her people nor her kingdom for mordecai had charged her that she should not show in other words there was an instruction that was given to esther from mordecai anybody here did mordechai d do whatever did esther do what mordecai told her to do so there got to be some obedience to the one responsible for you you there jump to verse 14. in the evening she went so the going to the king never happened in the morning am i reading a different scripture every virgin if you are chosen you going through the purification when it comes time for you to go to the king you don't go in the morning you only go in there they're going into the kingdom was always in the evening hallelujah in the evening she went and on tomorrow she returned in the second house of the women to the custody of shasgas the king chamberlain which kept the water so if you go there you miss it you always you you automatically are a concubine that's it forever anybody okay she came into the king no more you do man you miss the opportunity in other words you cannot miss that opportunity it's one shot you miss it you're gone anybody okay except the king delighting her and that she will call by water but even though they call you they're not gonna call you to be bride they're not calling you to be queen they are calling you as a concubine no more debra you already missed that opportunity everybody okay now when the turn of esther the daughter of abigail abigail the uncle of mordeca who had taken her for his daughter was come to go into the king she required water if you got the sermon you will understand what it means but what hecate the king's chamberlain the keeper of the women appointed and esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that look upon her so esther was taken to the king into the into his royal his his house royal in the water when he come in the time of esther she was going in which month of the which year hold on everybody okay anybody okay in the ten months of the seven years it's 10 and number seven [Music] everybody okay this message is biblical [Applause] the message of brother branham is perfectly in line with the scripture [Music] everybody have their own date but as the date must be 10 followed by seven [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah in the 10th month which is the month of tablets in the seventh year of his reign everybody okay so far and the king did water love is above and she obtained water no no no she obtained water grace she obtained grace [Music] and favor in his sight then all the virgins so that he sets the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of her job to verse 20 esther had not yet showed her kindred nor her people as mordechai has what had charged her for esther deep the commandment of mordecai like us when she was brought up with what a very obedient woman everybody okay last scripture hebrew 5. hebrew five verse eight you're reading of the scripture already flow my time you there hebrew five verse eight when you go home you sit down and you put this back again anybody care verse eight though he was a son he wear his son jesus yet learn he wanted by the things which he did water and being made perfect he completed his goal he became the author of eternal water to all them brother kelly that do what so if you obey him he can give you eternal salvation 10 call of god a high priest after the order of who let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly father this noon thanking you for your grace for your love your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us father we have done what any man that you give an ability an insight to do can do father now it's your time that you come and minister to your children may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to this church may you open the window of heaven and let no one be taken from any thought different than what you're bringing this morning but may you be gracious father that no one in this church under my voice and the one who's gonna follow letter miss what you're trying to tell them today father why we built every slumbering spirit and i pray lord that you give a revelation to your children in jesus precious name amen hallelujah my subject this morning auditioning is the four phases of roof roof under obedience in our tabernacle language we found out that there are many steps that roof have to go into the tabernacle roof enter into the gate you understand what it means and in the gate she had to face the present altar when she made a decision and that decision justify her and then you don't take a decision only to justify you but you move on to the next stage where roof have to be baptized everybody okay showing outwardly will happen inwardly amen and when you complete this stage according to ezekiel you get a new heart then roof move into the second stage into the holy place this is where we are everybody okay so far now as we begin to study this taking the tabernacle blending the tabernacle with roof and blending the tabernacle with the messenger and blending the tab and alcohol with ezekiel as far as must be a new heart a new spirit and the holy spirit we found out that on wednesday the holy spirit inserted esther everybody okay how does esther blend with the tabernacle because roof has four stages it is roof number one deciding everybody okay the second one is roof serving the third one is roof resting and the fourth one is roof rewarded and brother bonham said reward is talking about the rapture and in the rapture we go into the marriage supper everybody okay so far hallelujah praise be the name of the lord when we look at the book of esther we found out that in shushan the palace over here there was a queen there into the palace and her name was queen vesta and vassa was rejected by the king completely and when she was rejected by the king when she was rejected by the king a decree was given that they should gather new virgin everybody okay so we have a big castle here a big palace in shushan everybody okay this palace has gates you go read the book of esther nobody have a right to enter the gate into the palace of the king everybody here everybody okay so far but a decree was given that they should gather all the virgin and bring them into the palace everybody in other words the decree that was given from the king opened the palace yes everybody because no virgin outside of the palace was given permission to enter but the decree that came from the king was an opening of the gate of the palace but here the decree was an invitation into the palace the palace that was closed the palace that was not accessible that perilous issue an invitation and that invitation must go into all provinces but here according to your language that's why the gospel of jesus christ have to be preached in every nation all over the world according to your language and the coming of the gospel in your country or the coming of the gospel in your area or the coming of the gospel into your house it is a signal to you that the gate of the palace is open [Applause] i hope some of you slept good everybody here did we open the palace everybody okay and when the palace is open there is an invitation that is given everybody care so when the invitation is given the virgin that is picked must accept that invitation [Applause] everybody cares so far and when you accept the invitation you don't live the way you are going into the palace you need to fix yourself you need to take a shower you accept the invitation first you make a decision first then you have to be baptized [Music] everybody okay so far we are blending esther with the tabernacle everybody when they pick you up they are justifying you but you are still filthy you have to prepare to wash and to go into the palace when you enter the palace you enter under the custody of hegem and you have to go through the purification you must be purified six months with me which means you must die and then six months with sweet order so the sanctification doesn't kill you he purifies you first it is a dying to your own and then it also sweeten you in order to be presented to the king [Music] and when your turn happen you will enter into the inner court of the king remember esther gave the description of the inner quote esther said that no one goes there if they are not called if you enter there you're going to be killed everybody here and we know in the tabernacle in the holiest place you don't enter there if you will not come you must be qualified by the calling if you enter into the holiest without you being called they kill you [Music] roof blending with ester the decree opening the gate the picking up which is the president you're watching into the level you get under the custody of hager the holy place and then you enter into the inner court back here where you meet the king himself and in the inner court you do not enter in the morning [Music] everybody okay you have to enter in the evening brother branham said the lamb was killed in the evening time after being kept up for 14 days and the lamb and then the lamb was killed and the blood was applied in there you get it the token never come [Music] into existence until the water that's why all the virgins must enter in the evening time but thank god for esther she have to enter on the 10th month in the seventh year according to revelation 10 7 in the evening time there shall be light and this is the evening time of the age that we live in this is the evening time for the church this is the evening time for me this is the evening time for my message i am dying i am going i am moving out in the evening time of the gospel and we have come up through water and so far but this is the time that the token has to be what in other words brother branham told you that this edge here you must go all the way to the presence of the king you cannot be under this message and don't receive the holy ghost [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah i told you last sunday i had something i want to talk to you about this is it the time that when you just can't play with it it's got to be done if it's ever going to be done it's got to be done because we can see that the rough is about ready to pass through the land and the air and everything from under the token will do water the blood has water and we know that the blood is the message of the hour [Music] everybody here so far what are we talking about blessed be the name of the lord brother branham said israel come through many things but it was evening time when the talking was required not in the morning not in the preparation anybody okay no time to haggy the 14 days of the keeping up of the lamb israel no something was coming so did luther know it so did wesley know it so did finny knocks cavenoid this is it they knew there was there there would come a time that the pillar of fire will return back to the church they know that there will come a time that these things will happen but they didn't leave to see it but they look forward to it where are you going my friend but when i see the token i shall pass over you it is god requirement of the water god requires you under this message you must have the holy ghost [Music] do you hear me this is not the time for you to stop at hagen this is not the time for you to be just picked up you must go into the presence of the kings hallelujah the evening time message is to apply water doesn't matter what you are how good you are how many times you jump up and down how many churches you join how many good things you've done i want me one mean one thing to you if you if the token is not applied this is the evening time that work all right in the days off that works all right in the days of what but it don't work now you must be filled with the baptism of the holy ghost and they looted this work and the western this work and the pentecost is work but today the door is open you must go all the way into the end everybody here so far blessed be the name of the lord so now you can see that we blended not only roof now you blended roof and ester into the tabernacle the invitation was given opening the gate when they pick you up you wash you already completed the other coat when you get under head you're going through sanctification of purification and the last step is the inner court and when esther entered there and she was accepted then esther was rewarded how was she rewarded the bible says in esther 2 chapter 18 then the king made a great what unto all his princes and his servant even as there's what the feasts follow the acceptance into the inner code and he made a release to the province and gave gift according to the state of the water because after deciding serving resting rewarded you going to the marriage sapper which is a feast everybody okay and when the virgin were gathered together the water not to pick up a key a queen everybody here they were in that there was another gathering of the virgin but it was not to pick up a queen because esther is already picked everybody here but why are they gathering the virgin the second time the bible said in revelation 14 that they sung as he were a new song before the throne and before the phobias and the elders and no man could learn that song by the water which were redeemed from the water these are dead which were not deferred with water for their water after the marriage supper of esther after we're going into the rapture then there is another gathering of the hundred and forty four thousand not to be queen but to be the eunuch to be the guardian of the brother and the king everybody cares so far did i lose anybody hallelujah as we moving on into our ezekiel party right here we found out how you feel that's why it's good to sleep on time as we're moving up with ezekiel blending with the tabernacle we found out that whether you're born in a message or not you must go through the altar you get the new heart and you move into the holy all the way there that's where we stop hey but here now we're trying to move from the holy place into the holiest ever here because we found out that saul went into the present altar saul went into the holy place saul went into the altar of essence he already have the spirit of god he could even prophesy but they told him even if you professor you must wait we meet you a girl god what is going on hallelujah to enter the holy place if you remember when we talked about the high priest we found out that there was a mixture at the forehead of the high priest that said holiness to the lord in other words no one can enter the king without being purified let me help you up again no one can receive the holy ghost if you are not sanctified i hope you are following me because i see a lot of moving keep moving you'll be responsible everybody okay so far that's why you must go through hager before you enter into the health court everybody must complete sanctification if you are not sanctified god will never give you the holy ghost what are you trying to say brother stephen brother branham say how that would do for a real christian to get away from the things of the world and someday you talk about coming into the port on the wings of a dove he's coming for a broad one that don't fool with the world or defense of the world she is washing the blood of the lamb she is pleasure love to him only the love of the world is gone and dead to her the marriage of the lamb has come and his brother had made herself what remember if you have already made your pledge and still mingle with the things of the world [Music] if you already made your pledge at the present altar and you're still playing with defense of the [Music] yes sir world everybody okay jesus will not have a bride like that he will not have one that is adulterous because you have your first husband is alive all your love must be to him and if you love the things of the world and the water and the fashion of this world better than you love god [Music] in other words the fashion of your world have more importance to you than god in other words the fashion of the word are now your adult lord help your children and that fashion of this world better than you love god then you have not made yourself what so in order to make yourself ready you must go through purification you must go through sanctification you must clean up [Music] because when you're coming you have things hanging you have a snack in you you have things hanging you have a snack with you you have things hanging there is no way the holy ghost can get there you must work on the sanctification in the legalistic way you remember the wednesday you remember the wednesday because the legalistic way will one by one begin to remove defeats one by one what does legalistic way mean amen because we didn't finish it on wednesday we told you that there is a law that is caused also whatever you apply for your healing you can apply it for your salvation everybody okay so far when you are applying sanctification in the legal way the word legal speak of law all commandments everybody care the word legal is referring to the commandment of god which is the word of god or watching oh which is the requirement of god what does it do so i can help you anybody okay when god say i don't want you to do a or one anybody okay the desire to one is in your life do you follow me do you follow me you have to first obey without deliverance are we okay are we okay so when god said stop gossiping anybody care don't worry about gossiping anybody here you first take a decision you say because god said so from now on i won't do it even though the spirit is still on you [Music] everybody here so if you have a tendency to call people you stop the call even though you feel like calling lord father help me brother branham says with sozo you must first believe and you do what and you must confess everybody here when you believing that it's true god gossiping is bad i believe it anybody okay now you must stop what you're doing do you follow me and you must begin to confess confession set the mark of the of your christian life do you get know what i'm saying confession set the level you want to go everybody here confession you are telling yourself that i want to be a president i want to be a prime minister you the one that set the level everybody okay everybody okay so when you are confessing you are not what you are confessing yet everybody okay so far you are only setting the mark to what you want to reach [Music] hear what it is friend if you get it you are a christian because you believe that you are error and it's all sadder because he's what your confession put that lever you want to go and once you set the level he engages your high priest do you follow me if you say i am no better god will make sure you know better amen brother brother say he is the high priest of your confession you get what i mean what you confess you are that is what you are not what you are in the present time it's what you are in the vision you are struggling with a demon everybody here you have to shoot a pro a confession that shows you delivered [Music] everybody here ever here then god will pick up that stone everybody here and begin to work with it until you get delivered [Music] let me help you up again they tell you painting your nails is wrong everybody here you go home you take off your nail and you are taking those painting off in obedience to the word of god do you follow me once you do that god is obligated to deliver you from that demon [Music] everybody okay as long as you don't take that off god will never move glory what you want is lord i believe you and you want god to come and take the dresses and take them to the trash and put them in the garbage god won't do that do you follow me because why the problem say god have no hand but your hand god has no eyes but your eyes god have no feet but your feet you must do it yourself you must stop and say bring me my shoes this one high heel here this one low heel here this one high here here god i love high-heeled shoes but because of you since you told me it's wrong i am taking this off [Music] any man will never leave any father or any than what he believes he's living you take a man that is talking about drinking water he talks about drinking he think about water he drop right into that and becomes a water so you're talking and your thinking are actually pushing you somewhere [Applause] even if you struggle something don't talk about it [Applause] do you follow me don't say praise the lord for healing me for cancer you are talking cancer praise the lord for healing me you stop right there no negativity [Applause] everybody okay so far if thinking about drinking talking about drinking can make you drinking a joker how much is talking about the word thinking about the word reading about the word what is he gonna make you be [Applause] [Applause] go to philippians 4. [Music] everybody should be sitting here and listening amen let's go to philippians philippians 4. everybody there lord help me i have not even scratched the surface verse 8 everybody okay it's amazing when we preach like this you should even pray god not to move you and stay put because this stuff we grew up in a message we struggle with them we didn't understand how to get delivered and when you preaching somebody's moving somebody's out somebody's not in church somebody don't want to listen and tomorrow you're still struggling everybody here verse eight finally brethren what's all the things are what kama what's all the things are water come on watch all the things are what come out whatsoever things are what come out watch all the things are water karma watch all the things are water if there be any virtue and if there be any do whatever why think on those things [Music] tell me one thing that can qualify to all these except the word of god because the word of god is pure the word of god have good report the word of god is holy the word of god is everything that they describe here is the word of god in other words think on the word talk about the word it will automatically categorize you into a different step here but you need to tell god what you want to be tell god i don't want what i'm struggling with i want to see myself sanctified i want to see myself delivered i want to see myself as a good mother as a good husband as a good example as a christian that is filled with the holy spirit that is prospering in all his ways and you begin to confess that when you confessing it means that in the present state you are not yet what you are confessing but as abraham you begin to call the things that are not like they are already existing if you look at this economy to buy a house you will never buy one do you follow me the interest went down went lower do you know what they did they raised the price now the the price are going down what they do they raise the interest when are you gonna buy it when are you gonna buy it because you're watching the market you're wasting your time watch the promise of god and tell god what house you want how do you want it to be built which neighborhood you want to live and you put it up there don't worry about the wedding god will make sure they will drop that interest just for you because somebody took him at his word [Applause] [Music] lord help me hallelujah brother brother a man say that always thinking about water and look at what and think about it and read the birth what do you think you're gonna be so if you listen to the message if you're reading the message if you're talking about the message if you're listening about the message what are you gonna be [Music] when the inspiration of the holy ghost is here to inspire you remember god will make your body come into your water if you say you are a drunkard and want a drink don't worry you will soon be one amen everybody here if you say you are a sinner and want to sin you will be right into it if you say you are a christian and believe it all along god your testimony will bring you right into it if you believe in healing and believe that god have healed you confess it and god will make you water obey your water why he is the high priest of your confession sitting at the right hand of the father now with his own blood to make intercession for how many confessions upon anything that he died use calvary my friend [Music] somebody already suffered use the benefit of his suffering he died to read sin and sickness is a result of sin because he was wounded for our transgression with his trap we are water do you know the problem the majority of us are like neman do you know the story of naaman yes my brother that's right and then i shall send the messenger out to him naman was a leper he want to get leprosy they told him go to israel there is a king there that's going to pray for you there is a prophet there that will pray for you neymar took his car get in the car go there stop there and he came out the prophet which is the pastor never came out to see him he called one of his deacons he said go tell that man that came on the parking lot don't come here i don't want to see him i'm going to give him instruction he said go and watch in jordan how many times and that flesh shall come again today and that shall be what how did elijah knew he was coming for healing [Music] elijah never met him elisha was inside he told his deacon he said go tell the man outside tell him to go and deep into the jordan seventh time he will get here who taught him that neyman should have thought first and say wait a minute i never seen this deacon and he's telling me what to do so this must be god he missed that what why did he miss it the bible says this and nerman was water angry why is he angry and went away and said behold i thought he will surely i'm a general he will surely come out to me and do water and call on the name of water and struck his hand over the place and recover the water this is why we miss many blessings from god come on hey we have idea of how we can get delivered and some of them come from the previous churches we wear if you come from a catholic you pick up certain ideas the one who came from pentecost have certain idea the one who came from the baptist have certain idea the way you grew up in your in your house in your family loaded you with certain ideas that broke your healing sometime [Music] so when they tell you about healing you are already thinking about healing the way it happened according to your talking in your family you coming to god to get here god said do this he get upset why because what i was expecting was he need to come out and say good morning general oh good to see you today ma your honor your excellency oh you have leprosy oh in the name of jesus christ let proceed move preconceived idea [Music] [Applause] and not only preconceive idea we have complicated the gospel until when you bring the simple gospel people don't understand it i am telling you by the word take whatever you struggling with throw it away in obedience to god and confess and move on in your life do you follow me i am struggling with my dresses i'm not gonna say i'm gonna sit and wait for the lord to help me grow in my uh the way i dress oh i'm gonna wait first and wait for the lord to help me and change my haircut and stop wearing the paint so then i will come back and serve the lord who told you that who told you that who told you that god say i need to cut my hair good tomorrow i'm at the barbershop i cut my hair good i said father forgive me for cutting my hair bad from today on because i love you i will never do that again and i'm back in church and i continue to serve god because when you confess you are not naturally delivered yet but here the problem is we try to hold on to the think we don't want to let it go and we're expecting a power to come down here and what we're giving you is a simple instruction but we're not used to simple stuff [Music] you want somebody to tell you go fast 10 days guess what all of you will do it if somebody tell you first 10 days you're gonna get delivered you'll see young people fasting 10 days because we love complicated stuff do not sleep all night pray somebody will stay all night pray if you look at him you say hey talk to god when you finish go to sleep i don't think i've seen people really really really how many times have you been doing all your praying why is that demon still there you don't understand the principle of god everybody here are not a banner and purple reverse of water better than all the water of water may are not washing them and be clean so he turned and went away in water not only did he want his ways but he want to take the prophet way and alter change the prophet message to fit what he want the prophet said jordan you don't think the prophet did not know these rivers but he says no let's let's listen together jordan got water right these rivers also got water right and matter of fact this river the water are cleaner than jordan why not going in a clean water versus this do you see where you get in trouble i don't see what is wrong with this haircut it is just a scissor that they put like this what does it have to do with spirit you say that paint that paint it's just a paint no no it's a spirit it is a spirit that high heel is a spirit that painting there is a spirit glory ever here take that away because that spirit will remain on you as long as you have nothing he has a claim on you lord help me and his servant came near and spoke unto him and say my father if the prophet had beated to do some great things would not would that not have done it if they would have asked you for your healing bring a million dollars you will go to your bank account and bring it they didn't ask you money they didn't tell you fast they didn't tell you god to honor that prayer they didn't tell you oh they told you go to the water one two three four five six seven eight seven boom out it's finished what is the problem hallelujah how much rather than when he said to thee watch and be what very easy people don't expect it because when we talked about them oh the seventh seal the day it's gonna be open oh all heaven will be there the seven seal is simple we show it to you here the trumpets are not complicated the top and alcohol is simple as they simple it's not complicated [Music] it is the simplicity of the gospel that staggered the water they tried to make it a great intellectual something another when it's the water but god takes the very tool of water and water and water to work his work with it that is two in god's water it's very simple oh brother stephen will preach sanctification let's get ready how are we going to get started because you are waiting for something to do want a formula easy you know the same way you confess for healing that's the same way you get sanctified is he complicated oh it's that simple i don't think this is true let's go to preacher so and so we're over there you're gonna sit in the room they pray for you seven days and people and you see that's why the pentecostal fill with people and they even make them pay for prophecies everybody here and guess what they paid for them they paid for handkerchief to be prayed and sent back because people love that you tell somebody you go there the pastor who will who will uh bless your wedding will be paid guess what they got paid the pastor you say in here we don't pay the person it's free do you know what they want to show that they pay for the blessing anybody here whatever you struggling with whatever we already preached to you here take it off everybody if it's your friend on facebook cut them off don't wait to get sanctified to cardamom you cut them off first you are leopard yes god see the priest as they turn to see the priest they get here hallelujah hallelujah brother bottom said neyman dipping in the water of jordan why he said the water up in his country is much cleaner and better but that was not what the prophet said deep he dipped once lepros is still there sixth time he was still there in other words he went the first time brother branham said there was one of his soldier waiting he said master he say seven two three at the end who's laughing for your own benefit but you are getting mad at the preacher [Music] he had to obey and come god's way and when he did what god's what the prophecy i said tonight that if we obey god's provided way leprosy will sickness will everything will but we got to come for his for this any complication hallelujah so don't come and tell me no no i need to take my time first maybe a year or two to prepare myself before serving the lord continue taking your time you'll find yourself more backslidden that's not the way you play with the devil he knocks you down you step up you say no problem devil but i'm going back again everybody here i am not quitting church i am not quitting serving the lord i am not quitting singing for god i am not quitting preaching for the lord no matter what you bring i will repent and go back in line we paint and go back in line we paint and go back in we paint and go back in line [Applause] [Music] here oh i won't do that until my children get saved do you know that do you know the year your child will get saved if it's going to take 20 years so you will serve god after 20 years take that child put him in the hand of god put the blood on him claim him leave him alone and move on with your life [Applause] even if somebody called you we saw your child drunk over there don't worry about you say thank you for the information he's under the blood [Applause] but here when you enter to church shut the dead for you happy even if the whole church knows what your church did on facebook it doesn't matter you can gossip about me but i will be dancing like everything is good hallelujah hallelujah oh i'm gonna come to church everybody knows that my child mess up so if i shout they say look at her shouting her child over there so everybody come sister it will be okay everything okay no sister we heard about your child keep praying for him he's doing well all is well all is well all is well i will serve god i will praise god i will dance for god i will live for god regardless of what happened [Applause] everybody okay so no more i'm gonna take my time and he need to take his time too much time let me let me ask you a question when your child is suffering do you stop work [Music] do you do you follow me when you struggling and you don't want to sing here did you stop your work why you didn't stop your word you stopping the work of god you want to take your time off take your time off from the church take your time off from your work take your time off from everybody then you stay with god [Applause] [Music] you see how the devil play around with you when he comes to work you don't want to take time off but you only want to sacrifice the church we don't go to church because of coronavirus why are you going to work sit also at home don't work [Applause] amen in other words i am not in the other court i have an always christianity in winter i'm praising him in summer i'm praising him in in fall i'm praising worthy i am praising him [Applause] until when you look at me you will probably think brother stephen never suffered he's always happy he's always joyful because i won't show you my tears [Applause] you saw me standing here preaching do you know what i went through do you know what i went through every pen i was feeling i don't feel it right now because i knew i said let's go let me get on that pulpit i

[Music] [Applause] at that point the deacon now become your help he's not embarrassing you when he check you say praise the lord thank you my brother hallelujah preach the word preach the word preach the word [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is everybody okay never wait to see the changes before you serve god never do that confess and move forward [Music] anybody here the devil you don't know the devil you don't know the devil i'm going to feel like this no forget it forget it no no no i need to take my time before i need to do this you're wasting your time what do you want me to do this i do it i keep moving because you cannot change yourself if god doesn't change you you won't change so why are you worrying about yourself [Music] [Applause] jesus said it is those that are sick that seek the water oh so if you are healed praise god me i still need the physicians and jesus look at the pharisees and say because you don't have sickness you will die now in your sin [Music] [Applause] who told you the church is for perfect people if you perfect you should be gone like enoch but we're still together you're not going to heaven without me [Applause] so instead of gossiping me pray for me

bad one anybody here the commandments say kill them all whether it's a beautiful woman to you or she's not attractive wipe him wipe him off anybody here but so use his intellect you follow me and he use his listening and his eyes and begin to say well why do we kill this one there is nothing normally if we need to destroy something we have to be bad lamb diseased no no no i don't think this is a good choice he used his intellect above the word of god i'm going slowly everybody okay jump to verse 10. then came the word of the lord to samuel saying he repent me now god even regret i even justify him i sanctify him still stubborn he doesn't listen to instruction he repent me that i have said so in other words he repent me for even pick him up i should have left him where he was jesus he repent me that i have set up saul to be king for he's turned back from following me and has not performed my commandment and he grieved samuel the pastor and he cried to the lord samuel crying he is enjoying with his bodies because they slip up to the movie verse 12. everybody here watch carefully remember he made a mistake a gilgam you okay watch the second mistake where it's made verse 12. and when samuel rose early to meet saul in that morning he was taught samuel saying so came to karma and behold he set him up a place and he's gone about and passed on and gone down to what second chance again in gilgal anybody okay watch and samuel came to saul and so said to him blessed be you of the lord i have performed the commandment of the who ask you god bless you brother stephen i

watch the service in other words cool down that's your answer let's stop there anybody okay i'll preform the commandment of the law and samuel said what means then this bleeding of the ship in my ear and the lowing of the oxen which are here watch so and so say they why do we have this beer around no no i just brought them to the party they won but here who was responsible for that trip who was responsible for that party how did bill get in here you gave somebody to be a dj who doesn't even know the message because you must make sure all your friends are there everybody here and they have brought them from the america for the people spare the best of the ship and the oxen to sacrifice to the water not the lord my god your god samuel the lord your god and the rest we have done what in other words samuel let's reason together good things and bad things we have taken them not to eat we want to use it for the lord intellectual religious you covering that you covering your mess with a religion reason i went there because he's a friend we just need to show our christian behavior to them so they see that we christian maybe one day they will come to us but truly that's not the case there is something in you that push you there everybody okay all right buddy okay verse 18 and the lord send you on the journey and say go orderly destroy what can you read it loud the sinners the water so when god was telling saul god destroyed the amalekite god was saying destroy sinners clean up clean up the last mess remove the last habit clean them up you didn't understand you want to keep them to please your friend you ready verse 19 why then did you not obey the voice of the lord but did fly upon this pole and did evil in the sight of the lord and saul said to samuel yeah i have obeyed what a stubborn man he's still insisting he have to make his point you know what i'm saying you don't you don't you don't you don't you don't understand me you follow me this is the young people you know you know you fell down you're still saying you know you know if you knew why did you fail [Music] here i have obeyed the voice of the lord i have gone the way which the lord sent me i have brought aegon the king of america i have destroyed have all the ladies show the america but the people took off the water the spoil of the sheep and oxen and the chief of the things which should have not which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice to the lord again on water a pleaser of man paul say for do i now persuade man i'm going to the airport oh god oh do i seek to please man for if i yet please man i should not be the servant of christ if you want to please god you must watch what you're doing by pleasing man samuel say as the lord has great delight in burnouting and sacrifice as in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than water and to listen than the fat of the realm for rebellion is water when god refused to speak this to solve where did saul go and what rebellion is that the sin of witchcraft he ended up at a witch everybody okay and stubborn is as water meaning you know better you don't want to do it that's why it's like iniquity and idolatry because you gave whatever you want to keep the first place before god that's why you stubborn you don't want to do it anybody okay this is what brother branham said children of disobedience disobedience means rebellion i look up that in the dictionary to be sure rebellion rebelling against what the revealed word of water like can rebel against evil's revelation reveal revelation vindicated of god that he was water buckle up i'm going to drop to the airport and cain rebelled against him and slow his brother the pharisee with their own denominational knowledge of what the word of god was select hand-picked men rebelled against the vindicated word of god made manifest for the day jesus christ indeed what that is what the children of disobedience is a rebellion against the word of god to disobey you are rebelling against the word of god that's why paul said oh foolish galatians who have what it's like a sin of witchcraft that you should not what [Applause] obedience witchcraft obedience witchcraft rebellion witchcraft rebellion stubbornness everybody here go check the people that left the message try to help them they don't even want they rebel they know better they rebel it's a witchcraft spirit spiritually speaking that turned them against the revealed word of god they are not witches they are not wizards but they are under a spiritual witchcraft everybody here so far what is the message so from here to here to here miss gilgal why did he miss gilga by failing to obey when you want eternal life you receive a token showing that the press has been paid it is not the blood but it's the token of the blood it is the life itself for what it is full obedience to the whole word of god to god's entire world will entitle you to the full obedient song to the word of god would have given you the kingdom forever forever full obedience to the full word of god entitle us to the token how do you get in the holiest full obedience full obedience will open the holiest for you amen hallelujah know other way is there that you could ever be entitled to the token until you do what know what somebody else has put it into or added to it by what god has said about it full obedience to the world brings ames can i repeat it again for obedience so to the word brings god the word eternal in you and that is the token how do i get the holy ghost [Music] how do i get the holy ghost is it complicated you want me to give you a formula go faster 20 days and then don't eat it on the water and don't eat meat do you want me to give you that purify your water in water obeying the truth purifies your soul that's why a stubborn spirit is a bad spirit but here through the spirit and to unfailing love of the brother that ye love one another with a pure heart being water but first you must then any question let's fill it blessed are dead if you love me that they may have air to water is it complicated if i tell you to do something and you do it it gives you a right to the tree of life because full obedience to the word entitles you to the token when you're obeying my word that full obedience will automatically put you into the tree of life amen why you don't have the holy ghost everybody here and may enter through the gate into the city brother bonham said when the token is once placed in your heart and you know it's the resurrection of jesus christ in you something is happening there is nothing going to turn you you know where you belong full obedience to the whole word of god entitles you to the and nothing else blessed is he that do all his commandments he might have the right to the tree of water [Music] you are blocking the holy ghost because of a high-heeled shoe you are blocking the holy ghost because of your haircut you are blocking the holy ghost because of your friend you are blocking the holy ghost because of something very simple that shoe will be destroyed your nail doesn't make you pretty you didn't burn with those nails like that the makeup you put in this is not the way you are you trying to change your skin or your complexion god did not create you like that it's an insult to god anybody here god say separate yourself from your kingdom that is what you have to do a lot of times separate yourself from a lot of unbelief and remember until abraham fully obey god the blessing never come until he water he took his daddy along he caused trouble and that lord finally caused trouble and the headsman and then as soon as he got separated from everything he fully obeyed when he come to full obedience then god brought the water when god expects you to do a special thing he demanded complete separation from any doubt you got to come to full obedience to obey what he says god demands it you cannot do no other way he always set an example and that was his example of a complete separation from all his family all his kindred and so forth to work a life separated to god what are you concluding brother stephen the token is a sign let me jump here what believe accept and full obedience to the whole world will intention you to the token full obedience not the part of it as far as your denominational goals but all of it fully obedience to the word which is bring you into christ how do you get to the holy earth full obedience to christ bring you into christ when you obey hey gay completely and you let loose for head get to dress you he will bring you into the presence of the king everybody okay jesus answer and say unto him if a man he will keep my word and my father will and who will come unto me and make our what you want god to make a dwelling in you you want god to come into you in the baptism of the holy spirit what do you have to do any question so is also the holy ghost whom god has given to them if ye then be evil know how to give good gift unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the spirit to them obey but here ask but whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we kept his and do those things that are you want god to dwell in your heart you want to receive the holy spirit you want to get in the holiest you want to receive the baptism of the holy spirit very simple my friend surrender obey what god is telling you to do and before you know it you'll find yourself into a different dimension and god himself because full obedience to christ he himself will pull you and put you there and it's not going to be the laying of hand on anybody you will know that something happened in you because you have obeyed but you are holding into unnecessary things stop dancing widely you don't listen you think we're taking fun off of you as soon as a party struck you crazy i'm soon as a pastor you crazy and when the holy spirit look say they don't get it yet i cannot put a seal like this with a woman that is dancing like this in front of a what and you don't know even where they are posting you yeah i've seen people going somewhere and somebody else posting them and i have the phone number of that person and i watched everything that happened i was not there very simple thing you want to go to hell for a haircut for an earring for a high heel for a tattoo dress for a short dress for a tight pant for something simple you blocking the holy ghost he's the author of eternal salvation to them da let's stand there i have talked a lot i have pointed over and over and over you're struggling there is even more than that some of you are on the internet some of you i have very very friends some of you on the telephone you know where your struggle is you know where your weaknesses are you know what you're doing that you know clearly it's not good according to the word of god according to the message that we preach that we believe i'm going to move forward i will not continue repeating i'm gonna move forward if you wanna enter into the holiest this is now between you and god you wanna hold on to your high heels you want to hold on to your dresses you want to hold on to your nails to your painting whatever you do that's between you and god but i'm not responsible for it because the word has been preached i cannot spin around here i have to move forward let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly father thanking you for your grace for your love and for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father a simple key obedience but it's a great key because that's the last greatest test that abraham had after you did so many things for abraham but still you are still looking for that final touch to make sure abraham is a good hair until you could testify when you came down and you want to destroy sodom you say shall i hide anything to abraham because i know abraham will teach his children how to behave correctly and you took abraham assad and you even give him the privilege to be able to plead for his family because you look at abraham father and you see something that is like you abraham had weaknesses abraham lied david had weaknesses many of them all of them had weaknesses but father the key they knew how to repent and they knew how to let go and they knew how to obey and sometimes you bring trial and heartache just to make sure we understand a certain language but father if he doesn't take your grace there is no way we can make it because who can make a man obey if it's not you lord father you the one that can give abraham such a faith to be able to take his own son and bind him and not only then bind him but even be able to take the knife and pull it up father already straighten his heart to kill isaac but father when you saw that determination that abraham can love him above all his treasure above even his own son father you say abraham let loose and you provided the land to show him that now i know that all the family of the earth will be blessed by thee father made this church understand the key to obedience father to let loose and may every spirit of stubbornness every spirit of rebellion every spirit of peer pressure every spirit of complexes to try to please people or to seek attention or to seek approval from everybody father may you break those complexes may your people be completely free and to make sure that they are not send in this world to be the pleasers of men the pleasers of friend the pleasers of families but to be pleaser of you and to make sure that you have preeminence you have the first place in their life that's all you require you require the same thing unto jesus christ which was to have preeminence and you did have preeminence in christ and you are requiring the preeminence into the blood and once the bread gives you preeminence what else can you withhold what else can you not give us because you will give everything to those that obey us that obey you father this is what we want to do lord sometimes we are born with complexes from a family strength that we battling with a spirit of rebellion and suppleness father but you the god that breaks circle lord may you break every genetic lord that is connected to stubbornness to disobedience every intellectual spirit every religious theological intellectual spirit that will be reasoning against the word of god because they don't want to let go something they still want to please themselves they still want to make sure they fit with the fashion of this world to make sure they can blend with the people outside and with the people inside to make sure they can further satisfy this flesh not knowing that they are grieving the holy spirit that is taking report day by day to give report to the father to make sure that the cargo is fully loaded and it's not shaken so that they can seal and seal forever the kingdom that faith that justified them that moved them into the whole new place and further now entering into the holiest that you want to sell them lord i pray that you granted unto them may you continue to minister unto them and give them revelation more and more about lord father what was preached today and strengthen their body touch those that are sick lord those that are going to struggling and different lord requests lord i pray as a shepherd that you give it unto them i commit everything unto them lord unto you father in the name of jesus christ amen a blessed church we love you [Music] [Applause] well this is the day this is the day that the lord has made that the lord has made i will rejoice i will rejoice and be glad in it and be glad yes this is the day that the lord has made i will rejoice and be glad in here this is the day this is the day that the lord y'all can be dismissed we're gonna sing it again amen hallelujah yes this is the day this is the day that the lord has made that the lord has made i will rejoice i will rejoice and be glad in it and be glad in it yes this is the day that the lord has made i will rejoice and be glad in him this is the day this is the day that the lord has made and i will enter his courts with thanksgiving in my heart i will enter his court with praise i will say this is the day that the lord has made i will rejoice for he has made me glad yes he has made me glad oh jesus made me glad and i will rejoice for he has made me glad [Music] he has made me glad oh jesus made me glad and i will rejoice for he has i will enter his gates hallelujah yes i will enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart i will enter his courts with [Music] praise i will say this is the the lord has made and i will rejoice for he has made me glad yes jesus made me glad oh jesus made me glam and i will rejoice for he has made me land jesus
