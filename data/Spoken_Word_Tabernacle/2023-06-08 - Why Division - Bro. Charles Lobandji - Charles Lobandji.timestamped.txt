[40:18] [Music]
[40:19] [Applause]
[40:20] [Music]
[40:27] Lord I believe
[40:30] Lord
[40:33] I believe
[40:34] [Music]
[40:35] Lord
[40:40] I believe
[40:44] all things
[40:47] are possible
[40:51] oh
[40:53] Lord
[40:55] [Music]
[41:00] I believe
[41:04] Lord
[41:07] I believe
[41:10] [Music]
[41:12] all things are possible
[41:16] [Music]
[41:18] Lord
[41:20] I believe amen
[41:26] we pass through
[41:30] I greet you all in the precious name of
[41:33] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[41:37] God richly bless you
[41:40] know
[41:42] we are so glad to gather together in
[41:45] this church
[41:49] and we thank the Lord for this
[41:51] fellowship
[41:54] and I would like to thank brother
[41:56] Stephen
[41:58] for his Hospitality his love
[42:02] and his confidence
[42:07] you know love will express that to
[42:10] everyone
[42:12] because the Bible say love even your
[42:15] enemies
[42:17] but the Bible never say trust your
[42:20] enemies
[42:22] amen amen
[42:26] so to let someone to your Pulpit it is
[42:30] even more than lost
[42:32] so it's a son of a trust
[42:36] because the pulpit is like a bad chamber
[42:41] so you don't let anybody come in
[42:44] especially at this time
[42:47] where the devil is rising
[42:52] because as the bride has been awakened
[42:55] the devil also is away
[42:57] so everything is going to maturity as
[43:01] the bread goes to maturity the church
[43:04] also is uh the devil also is going to
[43:06] maturity
[43:08] because the seed of God will reach
[43:10] maturity
[43:11] so the seed of the devil also will do
[43:14] the same
[43:15] complicated so it's very complicated
[43:18] so to make it so you must be the seed of
[43:23] God
[43:26] so
[43:33] that God will keep me to always keep his
[43:37] Trust
[43:40] so God richly bless you
[43:43] yes
[43:44] let's go straight to the scriptures
[43:48] John chapter 4.
[43:53] Beginning by the fifth verse
[43:56] John chapter 4
[43:58] is
[44:04] then come he to a city of Samaria which
[44:08] is called sakar near the parcel of grand
[44:11] that Jacob gave to his son Joseph
[44:16] Jesus
[44:25] Jesus therefore being wearied with his
[44:28] journey sat Das on the well and it was
[44:31] about the sixth hour read from the
[44:34] summary event without
[44:37] there come a woman of Samaria to Joe
[44:40] water Jesus said unto her give me to
[44:43] drink
[44:46] for his disciple were gone away unto the
[44:49] city to buy meat foreign
[45:11] for the Jews have no dealings with the
[45:15] Samaritans
[45:16] foreign
[45:36] give me to drink that Waters have asked
[45:39] of him and he would have given the
[45:41] Living Water
[45:43] foreign
[46:15] foreign
[46:28] Jesus answer and say unto her whosoever
[46:31] drinketh of this water shall test again
[46:34] but whosoever drinketh of the water that
[46:36] I shall give him shall never Thirst by
[46:39] the water that I shall give him shall be
[46:41] in him a well of water springing up
[46:44] until everlasting life
[46:46] foreign
[47:26] I have no husband Jesus say unto her
[47:29] that is well said I have no husband for
[47:32] I have five husbands and he whom that
[47:35] has now has it not the husband in that
[47:38] say that truly
[47:40] foreign
[47:50] here the language is changing
[47:56] the first he called she called Jesus
[48:01] and there is no relationship between the
[48:04] Jews and the Samaritans
[48:08] there is no relationship between
[48:10] American and French
[48:13] between the belgians and uh uh Germany
[48:20] but here if you notice the language have
[48:24] changed
[48:26] so now she's calling him Lord sir
[48:32] Jesus
[48:37] our father worshiping this mountain and
[48:41] you say that in Jerusalem is the place
[48:43] where a man ought to worship
[49:00] Jesus said unto her woman believe me the
[49:03] hour cometh when you shall neither in
[49:06] this mountain nor at Jerusalem worship
[49:08] the father you worship ye no not what we
[49:11] know what we worship for salvation is of
[49:14] the Jews
[49:24] cometh and now is when the true
[49:27] worshiper shall worship the father in
[49:29] spirit and in truth for the father's
[49:32] sake of such to worship Him
[49:41] God is a spirit and they that worship
[49:44] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[49:47] truth
[49:48] is
[49:57] the woman say unto him and know that
[49:59] Messiah cometh which is called Christ
[50:02] when he is come he will tell us all
[50:05] things and Paula de Messi or Messi she's
[50:10] talking about the Messiah to the Messiah
[50:12] himself not knowing that she was talking
[50:14] to them
[50:17] to the Messiah about the Messiah not
[50:20] knowing it's the Messiah
[50:28] we are talking about God without even
[50:31] knowing that we are addressing our
[50:33] thanks to God
[50:35] foreign
[50:46] because she was repeating what she heard
[50:49] from the Pharisees
[50:55] the one that they were waiting of his
[50:58] coming was already there and she was not
[51:01] aware of it
[51:03] she began to preach Jesus Christ about
[51:06] Jesus himself
[51:14] Jesus say unto her I that speak unto
[51:18] thee I am he
[51:21] Ard from
[51:26] and upon this came his disciple and
[51:28] Marvel that he talked with a woman
[51:32] yet
[51:34] no man say what sick is that or what
[51:37] talk is that with her
[51:41] you see the thought of God always quick
[51:44] to think about it
[51:46] they already live a long time with Jesus
[51:49] Christ
[51:50] and they already pee they even mentioned
[51:52] that he was the president but now he
[51:55] begins to be suspicious about Jesus
[51:57] Christ talking to a woman
[52:00] a lot of men always quick for evil
[52:05] is
[52:09] mentioned that the thoughts of men are
[52:12] always turned toward evil
[52:14] even the scriptures mentioned about it
[52:26] the woman then left the water part and
[52:29] went her way into the City and said to
[52:31] the man come see a man which told me of
[52:33] all things that I ever did is not this
[52:36] the crust
[52:38] then they went out of the city and came
[52:41] unto him
[52:43] verse 41 and
[52:48] many more believe because of his own
[52:51] word
[52:52] and say unto the woman
[53:02] now we believe not because of that
[53:05] saying for we have heard him ourself and
[53:09] know that this is indeed the Christ the
[53:12] savior of the world let's pray
[53:16] heavenly father
[53:19] father I just read your word
[53:22] but you are the one that can give a
[53:25] context
[53:26] give it to us
[53:29] for the blessing of our souls
[53:32] father may you move me out of the way
[53:37] because your children want to hear your
[53:39] voice
[53:42] because in your word that's the only
[53:45] place that we can find life
[53:47] from the beginning to the end of this
[53:49] service
[53:51] may you be the only one directing this
[53:54] service and speaking to your children
[53:58] father speak to us
[54:00] so that at the end
[54:03] thank you every heart be convinced
[54:07] that's really God have spoke to us and
[54:11] that we are really blessed
[54:13] in the name of Jesus Christ we thank you
[54:17] and ask it amen amen
[54:21] God bless you you might be seated
[54:23] tonight
[54:26] that was my scripture Foundation
[54:31] and I would like to add
[54:34] Genesis 1 verse 26. we did thee God said
[54:53] let us make man in our image after our
[54:57] likeness and let them have dominion over
[55:00] the fish of the sea over the fall of the
[55:03] air over the counter and over all the
[55:05] Earth and over every creeping thing that
[55:08] creepeth upon the Earth
[55:11] I'm gonna add First Corinthians chapter
[55:14] 13.
[55:18] you will understand the
[55:21] Harmony between those scripture hours we
[55:23] blend them together
[55:26] first Corinthians 13 verse 8.
[55:31] 8-13
[55:35] charity never fellas foreign
[56:49] is charity
[56:53] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[56:56] word
[56:58] we already prayed
[57:01] we read the scripture
[57:03] and from those scriptures
[57:07] I would like to take a title tonight for
[57:11] my sermon
[57:13] why division
[57:15] in the message of the hour
[57:20] amen amen
[57:25] because reading the message
[57:30] of it several times
[57:34] so it is our duty to repeat the prophet
[57:39] if the prophet spoke he was not brother
[57:44] he was the talk of God that was
[57:46] expressed
[57:49] and if that thought was delivered
[57:52] it means that somewhere there is a
[57:55] problem
[57:55] [Applause]
[58:48] is to pray for them
[58:51] amen
[58:56] that's why I gave a title
[58:59] The Division in the message
[59:03] we are reading the message
[59:06] we all are catching the thoughts
[59:09] sometimes we repeat the same thoughts
[59:14] we are manifesting something else
[59:20] and the greatest responsibility
[59:23] is started with the pastors
[59:28] that's why brother Branham says
[59:31] [Music]
[59:32] [Applause]
[59:37] not because he can preach God
[59:40] because he's living what he's preaching
[59:44] that's why
[59:46] it is better to leave a sermon than to
[59:50] preach one
[59:51] [Applause]
[59:54] amen amen
[59:57] that's why
[59:59] you just bear with me
[1:00:05] back home we don't use computers
[1:00:08] so just bear with me I will be using
[1:00:11] books
[1:00:14] so as my introduction
[1:00:18] I'm gonna read Hebrew chapter one
[1:00:21] it was preacher August the 21st 1957.
[1:00:27] this is
[1:00:28] brother Branham says this
[1:00:32] is paragraph 60. major Los
[1:00:36] s and I believe when he was speaking to
[1:00:39] this is Brother Brown I'm speaking
[1:00:46] that God have predestinated us to be
[1:00:49] sons and daughters
[1:00:51] and God have adopted us
[1:00:54] a Christian so that we children of Jesus
[1:00:57] Christ
[1:01:03] before the foundation of the world
[1:01:06] now notice this
[1:01:10] 61.
[1:01:12] and then when he spoke about in the
[1:01:15] Roman
[1:01:17] them they were adults
[1:01:22] yes
[1:01:24] they had the other sons of the Holy
[1:01:27] Spirit
[1:01:29] but they never frame made their
[1:01:33] Productions
[1:01:34] they never made up Sensations
[1:01:38] or some kind of feelings
[1:01:41] or some kind of funny feelings
[1:01:44] they never made up stuff
[1:01:48] is only sales Center speakers they let
[1:01:51] the Holy Spirit works
[1:01:54] so they only stop where the spirit of
[1:01:57] the Lord
[1:01:58] they never added their own thoughts
[1:02:02] continues
[1:02:07] 62. Paul says
[1:02:12] you you are going further with this
[1:02:19] you should be Master but you are still
[1:02:22] babes
[1:02:22] [Music]
[1:02:29] it has been more than 50 years
[1:02:36] meaning that we went beyond the very
[1:02:39] time of the Rapture
[1:02:41] that now we are in the long sufferings
[1:02:48] so the blood of Jesus Christ is supposed
[1:02:51] to be already mature
[1:02:54] but when we're looking at what is going
[1:02:57] on between the children of God
[1:03:00] we can tell that we are still children
[1:03:03] a lot of time a problem here we have
[1:03:11] [Music]
[1:03:14] we are still like in a backyard with
[1:03:17] children playing
[1:03:22] that's why brother Brian I'm adding
[1:03:24] paragraph 63.
[1:03:26] So I'm also reading
[1:03:29] [Music]
[1:03:30] and brother Branham say I always try
[1:03:34] do not come down with it
[1:03:37] so that this Tabernacle
[1:03:40] be like that
[1:03:44] not a bunch of babies
[1:03:47] we must be adults
[1:03:51] stay on the road
[1:03:54] oh my that's it
[1:03:58] that's why the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:04:02] The Secret of our success is in the
[1:04:05] message
[1:04:09] something somebody to take the message
[1:04:12] away
[1:04:13] we must cherish the message
[1:04:16] the problem is
[1:04:20] are doing something else
[1:04:26] that's why we that's why we get the
[1:04:29] problem well today
[1:04:31] massage the message
[1:04:36] we are supposed to know all the
[1:04:39] Mysteries that were revealed to us
[1:04:42] but we're still acting like babies
[1:04:45] a lot of tiny problems
[1:04:48] all conflict here conflict left and
[1:04:52] right
[1:04:55] we have enemies
[1:05:02] that in this age
[1:05:05] God did not hide anything to his brother
[1:05:10] amen amen we yes
[1:05:17] I gave you the complete the full advice
[1:05:21] of God
[1:05:23] do you understand
[1:05:25] we yes
[1:05:29] and he revealed unto us all the secrets
[1:05:32] of God
[1:05:33] foreign
[1:05:38] how to stand
[1:05:41] how to react come on say how to do
[1:05:46] how to walk and how to live why basket
[1:05:54] because we are not meant to live like
[1:05:58] the rest of the world
[1:06:02] worship like other churches because
[1:06:07] we have all the secrets of God
[1:06:11] and we know what God wants and what God
[1:06:14] is expecting from us
[1:06:17] reproducing that
[1:06:21] that's the problem
[1:06:24] we yes
[1:06:27] I'm already showed us what to do how to
[1:06:31] live
[1:06:32] but we are still looking at
[1:06:35] it do you follow
[1:06:39] in the sermon the Messiah
[1:06:44] I will just stay with me and be very uh
[1:06:48] pay attention and you will understand
[1:06:49] why
[1:06:53] the Messiah preached in 1961
[1:06:57] paragraph three
[1:06:59] oh
[1:07:04] this is Brother Brown I'm saying I'm
[1:07:07] sure you Prophet a promise
[1:07:10] that the prophet prophesies that at the
[1:07:13] evening light time they will be like
[1:07:17] so the light that came at the evening is
[1:07:20] this message
[1:07:23] and at that time
[1:07:25] when everything is dark in the world
[1:07:31] and knowing that we are living and
[1:07:33] working in the lights
[1:07:35] the light that he promised to bring
[1:07:38] that he did promise
[1:07:41] and to see yourself
[1:07:45] a privileged people who feel this is to
[1:07:49] Rejoice of these things in the end time
[1:08:11] [Applause]
[1:08:29] and it's almost the same thing in this
[1:08:32] age
[1:08:33] in this age of laodicea
[1:08:41] so
[1:08:49] how many American people knows that God
[1:08:52] sent us a prophet
[1:08:55] over there
[1:08:58] in our country in America and one uh an
[1:09:02] American original from Jeffersonville
[1:09:17] but he's an American
[1:09:20] and the message started here
[1:09:23] to show you that message that this
[1:09:26] message
[1:09:27] it's not to the Americans
[1:09:30] it is the message of the children of God
[1:09:36] we have children of God
[1:09:49] [Applause]
[1:09:55] [Applause]
[1:10:01] and the messenger has always been a
[1:10:04] secret to the sovereign
[1:10:21] foreign
[1:10:22] [Applause]
[1:10:38] [Applause]
[1:10:59] [Music]
[1:11:11] but we are not doing what the courts are
[1:11:14] saying
[1:11:15] [Applause]
[1:11:17] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:11:20] do you follow me carefully
[1:11:23] I'm still at the introduction
[1:11:31] [Applause]
[1:11:49] is having more we miss you brother
[1:11:52] Branham say yes sir legless
[1:11:57] the church is not God's mouthpiece
[1:12:02] a lesson
[1:12:04] she become her own mouthpiece
[1:12:07] [Applause]
[1:12:10] that's why God is turning against her
[1:12:28] [Applause]
[1:12:47] [Applause]
[1:13:00] it is the description of the life of the
[1:13:03] brother
[1:13:05] Hallelujah
[1:13:31] the world will hear directly from God
[1:13:35] as in the day of Pentecost
[1:13:38] but it's evident that
[1:13:41] as in the first age
[1:13:45] that bad will be rejected
[1:13:48] so don't worry about it even people are
[1:13:51] rejecting it it's the word being
[1:13:53] fulfilled
[1:14:02] so he spoke in this age
[1:14:06] you have the word
[1:14:10] than ever
[1:14:13] but
[1:14:15] you're not doing anything else but to
[1:14:18] dislocate it
[1:14:19] to cut it here and there
[1:14:22] taking what you wanted
[1:14:26] and living what you don't want
[1:14:29] I'm gonna give you an example just tell
[1:14:32] us another one the foreign
[1:14:43] how many people are doing that today
[1:14:57] is sinning
[1:15:05] it is
[1:15:08] not up to us to tell God what we want to
[1:15:12] be done it is up to us to submit to what
[1:15:15] God wants us to do
[1:15:16] [Applause]
[1:15:24] there is nothing to modify
[1:15:29] everything
[1:15:31] but today the Christians they come to
[1:15:34] church every day later
[1:15:36] there is no guiltiness
[1:15:41] because the one who's supposed
[1:15:44] is when the Holy ghosts the Holy Ghost
[1:15:48] will tell you that you're going out of
[1:15:50] the line
[1:15:53] that's why we see everything that we can
[1:15:56] see
[1:15:58] so what is matter to us
[1:16:00] is to do what we want
[1:16:05] brother pranam said it is not living the
[1:16:09] world
[1:16:10] it is about debating
[1:16:13] [Music]
[1:16:33] to do why are we discussing the fossil
[1:16:37] group everyone each one is defending his
[1:16:40] Clips
[1:16:42] because we have many clips
[1:16:46] and each one wants to show that my
[1:16:48] brothers
[1:16:49] now listen to me carefully
[1:16:52] when the message says
[1:16:55] that the seven Thunders
[1:16:59] they're bringing bags together
[1:17:02] it is
[1:17:05] this is not the Gathering of this
[1:17:14] the body of Christ
[1:17:16] not a local church
[1:17:23] God doesn't recognize you because you
[1:17:26] are going to a certain Church no no
[1:17:30] God will recognize
[1:17:33] when you are baptized in the body
[1:17:38] amen
[1:17:41] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:17:44] you following me
[1:17:46] listen today
[1:17:50] in the sermon the attitude toward God
[1:17:54] preached in 1950 August the 5th
[1:17:58] in paragraph three brother brand I'm
[1:18:01] saying you know
[1:18:05] I believe that when God Jesus Will
[1:18:09] appears
[1:18:13] he will not ask us if we are a member of
[1:18:16] a certain denomination
[1:18:21] we will be judged according to what we
[1:18:24] have done with Christ in our heart the
[1:18:27] christianism Christianity
[1:18:32] doesn't mean to be a member of a
[1:18:35] particular Church unless
[1:18:38] it means you are born in the Kingdom the
[1:18:42] kingdom of God that's why the summit
[1:18:45] we are in the same church body yes
[1:19:02] the body of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:19:06] hallelujah
[1:19:07] [Applause]
[1:19:15] [Applause]
[1:19:22] so we should not be arguing
[1:19:26] [Applause]
[1:19:26] [Music]
[1:19:28] amen amen
[1:19:30] are you still following me
[1:19:34] it is not living that is uh discrete it
[1:19:37] is about debating
[1:19:41] I would like that be called
[1:19:47] and you rejected I will support us
[1:19:53] if you want to know the truth of the
[1:19:55] word then
[1:19:57] I will praise you foreign
[1:20:06] [Applause]
[1:20:20] amen
[1:20:26] agency and brother Branham says
[1:20:31] 356 brother Branham says we yes
[1:20:36] this is
[1:20:37] the last warning La vertices
[1:20:41] this is the warning of the church
[1:20:44] it is
[1:20:49] a message doesn't belong to us
[1:20:53] but the problem is when we see the
[1:21:05] so at that point we need to scream like
[1:21:07] the prophet
[1:21:09] yeah
[1:21:14] the spirit will never speak in another
[1:21:16] way
[1:21:18] because the age of clothes
[1:21:22] [Applause]
[1:21:24] so that certainly we are at the end
[1:21:38] blocking him
[1:21:41] says
[1:21:50] we learned
[1:21:53] oh how true that is
[1:22:12] [Music]
[1:22:28] and then bring that man to perform
[1:22:31] miracles
[1:22:38] Spirit shall be very close
[1:22:43] it should even deceive the very like
[1:22:45] seriously was possible
[1:22:47] but it's impossible we yes
[1:22:52] [Music]
[1:22:54] just as Judah have a true Ministry in
[1:22:58] the Holy Ghost
[1:22:59] and he was declared that he was a devil
[1:23:03] [Music]
[1:23:11] and miracle and gift and friendship
[1:23:14] [Applause]
[1:23:16] be careful
[1:23:18] be careful with that
[1:23:21] gift Salah
[1:23:24] to accompany the world
[1:23:28] [Applause]
[1:23:36] be careful with that
[1:23:38] yeah
[1:23:39] Hallelujah
[1:23:43] we must be very careful about it we yes
[1:23:47] it's not Judah
[1:23:51] Judah went to preach
[1:23:55] in the group that Jesus said he was
[1:23:57] among them he preached he you heal the
[1:24:01] sick he came back and he gave a report
[1:24:04] to Jesus and Jesus
[1:24:09] because the the spirit is
[1:24:20] but his name was taken out
[1:24:25] meaning that
[1:24:27] is
[1:24:28] that the gift is not the primary thing
[1:24:32] I know why I'm saying that because today
[1:24:36] when we pray for the sick when we do
[1:24:40] this and this
[1:24:42] we think that we got the true thing
[1:24:46] and look at what the Pentecostal people
[1:24:48] do
[1:24:49] they pray about the sick and the things
[1:25:07] they don't have those promises
[1:25:10] that's the difference
[1:25:13] that's the difference
[1:25:16] amen amen we got promises we are living
[1:25:21] in the promises
[1:25:35] we
[1:25:42] cannot receive any other learning
[1:26:08] but he will listen in order to come
[1:26:10] against it
[1:26:34] [Applause]
[1:26:59] [Music]
[1:27:10] foreign it and we cannot receive the
[1:27:13] thought of a man when brother Branham

[1:29:40] in the sermon the spoken word is the
[1:29:43] Original Series

[1:30:31] religion and they have big religious
[1:30:34] questions and the people are going to
[1:30:37] concert

[1:31:19] that are following the world
[1:31:24] amen amen
[1:31:28] I can preach you the word like a sense
[1:31:32] but if I don't like brother Stephen

[1:31:38] I'm gonna follow Judah
[1:31:40] Judas have a gift

[1:32:32] Jesus warn us yes
[1:32:41] it's the same Spirit very close
[1:32:44] you should deceive the very elect if it
[1:32:47] was possible
[1:32:49] it's like one day
[1:32:51] I saw a Believer coming Pastor he said
[1:32:55] I met someone on the road
[1:32:58] and he told me I say why
[1:33:02] I said why I say so follow him
[1:33:09] we are not attracted by songs
[1:33:29] amen
[1:33:31] amen amen

[1:34:58] [Music]
[1:35:04] [Applause]
[1:35:10] [Applause]
[1:35:18] but it's always the word that
[1:35:44] itself that the Holy Ghost gives the
[1:35:47] energy
[1:35:48] that's what brother Branham
[1:35:50] you want to get it
[1:35:53] first start a favor toward him the words
[1:36:08] of everything that is following your
[1:36:10] ministry
[1:36:12] [Music]
[1:36:26] keep your eyes on the message
[1:36:30] keep your eyes on the message
[1:36:40] [Applause]
[1:37:32] only the Prophet the word himself
[1:37:39] and we want to stick with the teaching
[1:37:42] of the prophet yeah
[1:37:45] I'm gonna say something
[1:37:47] listen to me carefully
[1:37:50] we are in the time
[1:37:53] that the word
[1:37:58] let me say it clearly we are in the time
[1:38:02] that the word and the sun alone are not
[1:38:06] sufficient I'm gonna show you that
[1:38:10] let's come back to our lesson are you
[1:38:14] following me
[1:38:15] so now let me go back to the scripture
[1:38:19] let's look at this John
[1:38:24] let's look at this woman from Samaria
[1:38:28] we yes
[1:38:29] jean-ship John chapter 4.
[1:38:36] then say the woman of Samaria
[1:38:41] how is it that that being a Jew
[1:38:45] which I am a woman of Samaria yes
[1:38:49] for the Jews have no dealings with the
[1:38:51] Samaritans said the father this woman
[1:38:54] was praying said the fam this woman know
[1:38:58] the words
[1:39:07] and she was also segregationist
[1:39:13] foreign
[1:39:14] do you follow me carefully
[1:39:21] because she never met the Messiah
[1:39:25] Jesus said
[1:39:27] [Applause]
[1:39:28] if you know the gift yes
[1:39:41] what is the gift of God
[1:39:44] John 3 Verses says verse 16.
[1:39:50] God so loved the world
[1:40:05] in other words
[1:40:08] and you won't perish
[1:40:14] that called me when I was in Kentucky
[1:40:17] from England and she asked me a question
[1:40:23] can someone be uh saved without the
[1:40:27] message
[1:40:31] there is no salvation
[1:41:29] that came out of Mary
[1:41:52] they did
[1:42:50] this is
[1:43:02] I won
[1:43:04] [Applause]
[1:43:09] he's not greater than his word
[1:43:13] and the form God took today
[1:43:16] this is the form of the message
[1:43:20] that is finishing its course in the
[1:43:22] children
[1:43:23] that's why he missed yeah God a dead
[1:43:27] manifested us that God has manifested in
[1:43:29] the Bible
[1:43:31] God by his words
[1:43:37] many bodies
[1:43:39] [Applause]
[1:43:43] the end time God is manifesting in Many
[1:43:47] Bodies many members
[1:43:49] [Applause]
[1:43:53] and I thank God
[1:43:55] because the sister finally understood
[1:43:58] she said thank you
[1:44:01] so now listen
[1:44:04] verse 25 La Familia the woman says unto
[1:44:09] him
[1:44:10] now the woman is
[1:44:13] preaching Jesus to Jesus
[1:44:16] vegetables
[1:44:33] the same Pastor that was preaching about
[1:44:35] Jesus Christ told the woman that that
[1:44:37] one is bearable
[1:44:40] that's why I said the family that woman
[1:44:43] left
[1:44:46] her home
[1:44:48] as a Samaritan to the world as a
[1:44:51] prostitute
[1:44:57] the very gift of God
[1:45:00] amen
[1:45:02] do you follow me
[1:45:06] he say when he come he will tell us
[1:45:12] so because Jesus can never hide before
[1:45:16] his own seed
[1:45:17] s Jesus said
[1:45:20] I am he
[1:45:23] [Music]
[1:45:24] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:45:27] we yes
[1:45:29] I am
[1:45:42] denominational and she told away
[1:45:45] thank you
[1:45:45] [Applause]
[1:45:47] and she ran
[1:45:50] when she was leaving home
[1:45:52] he was a prostitute
[1:45:55] [Applause]
[1:45:57] with the knowledge
[1:45:59] of the pastor prostitute prostitutes
[1:46:04] segregationists
[1:46:06] and everything trouble
[1:46:09] problems
[1:46:11] but when she met the Messiah amen amen
[1:46:15] let me save yourself
[1:46:41] [Applause]
[1:47:00] forgiven foreign
[1:47:21] another place if Jesus was no longer a
[1:47:24] jealous he was not the Messiah
[1:47:28] Amen
[1:47:29] to somebody that she was no longer
[1:47:32] somebody president
[1:47:53] and the Bible says
[1:47:59] they all came out
[1:48:46] hallelujah
[1:48:50] amen amen
[1:48:54] do you listen
[1:48:58] ing do you really get it
[1:49:02] now she had a new experience
[1:49:35] brought the Forgiveness of all her sins
[1:49:41] so what happened to us
[1:49:44] we are in the world
[1:49:46] but we are not really in the word
[1:49:50] we are in the message but we're not
[1:49:52] really within the message we are in the
[1:49:55] church
[1:49:56] but we are not in Christ
[1:50:00] we have a confusion between the church
[1:50:03] and the mystical body of the Lord
[1:50:05] and I want you to know that
[1:50:08] for that Pastor
[1:50:11] Jesus was the devil may God said the
[1:50:14] family but when that word
[1:50:17] experience
[1:50:29] it's individual
[1:50:31] [Applause]
[1:50:39] might be just like a bridge taking you
[1:50:42] from one place to another example let me
[1:50:45] give you an example there is a uh
[1:50:48] everything and that is separating two
[1:50:50] cities and they put a a bridge there
[1:50:55] is
[1:51:01] but listen to me carefully
[1:51:03] okay let me explain it
[1:51:08] okay let me explain this if you have two
[1:51:11] cities and there is a river in the
[1:51:13] middle there is no communication between
[1:51:15] the two cities so when they spend a
[1:51:17] bridge there the bridge is the one that
[1:51:20] is bringing communication between the
[1:51:21] two cities but the bridge will never
[1:51:23] enter either cities
[1:51:42] but
[1:51:44] you're a fun Pastor that will be only
[1:51:47] there to help you abide themselves won't
[1:51:49] get there
[1:51:51] [Applause]
[1:51:52] do not stay in a group
[1:51:56] stand in Christ
[1:52:01] [Applause]
[1:52:04] that's why brother Branham says this is
[1:52:12] It's a preaching 19 uh 56.
[1:52:17] in October the 4th 1957. paragraph 55
[1:52:21] brother Brandon says this is
[1:52:31] a good preacher yeah
[1:52:37] can preach more than you anytime
[1:52:44] no more than you that than you will ever
[1:52:47] know and yes 10 more
[1:52:49] certainly foreign
[1:53:22] says
[1:53:27] that's not right
[1:53:29] amen
[1:53:32] to know the word is not life
[1:53:34] [Applause]
[1:53:36] to know about your Creedence
[1:53:41] to not the doctrine of your church
[1:53:45] that is not life
[1:53:49] let you know him
[1:53:52] that is life
[1:54:02] no Jesus Christ in theology
[1:54:12] [Applause]
[1:54:16] and that was it that settlement
[1:54:20] amen
[1:54:23] go to The Villages
[1:54:26] if you go back home to our Villages
[1:54:30] brothers and sisters who don't know even
[1:54:32] how to remember
[1:54:34] but they have the Holy Ghost they don't
[1:54:36] know how he would manifest a Christian
[1:54:37] on Earth and they will show you question
[1:54:39] they must say believe but they don't
[1:54:41] know if there is that they know Jesus
[1:54:45] but they know Jesus
[1:54:49] say Amen
[1:54:51] oh man
[1:54:55] [Applause]
[1:54:57] I mean
[1:55:09] to whip Brothers instead of helping
[1:55:12] people
[1:55:14] okay let's go ahead
[1:55:18] but you are not one with the scriptures
[1:55:24] are speaking about the gift of God the
[1:55:27] gift of God
[1:55:33] nobody can die before the gift of God
[1:55:37] if he was you and me
[1:55:40] if we had the discernment of this place
[1:55:42] do you know why
[1:55:44] everybody will be like you a procedure
[1:55:49] no you Jesus
[1:55:55] Jesus never go in a rush way with her
[1:56:06] tell me a little bit
[1:56:09] Among Us here tonight
[1:56:17] let me explain you this Among Us here
[1:56:20] tonight who among us if you know who
[1:56:23] will kill you in 10 years you already
[1:56:25] know this man in 10 years will kill me
[1:56:27] and you will live with him like Jesus
[1:56:30] did with Judah
[1:56:31] and and God already told you that in 10
[1:56:34] years are you going to live with him but
[1:56:38] Jesus
[1:56:39] three and a half years
[1:56:42] knowing that it's gonna be Judas
[1:56:48] never even criticize Judah says
[1:56:52] Jesus even gave him
[1:56:55] in a job as a treasure in the church
[1:57:00] that is going to be Judas
[1:57:03] was calling him
[1:57:07] but Jesus also bear with him
[1:57:13] amen
[1:57:14] but as today for a small mother
[1:57:18] I'm upset
[1:57:20] no we speak everything
[1:57:23] any kind of words will come up foreign
[1:57:32] ah
[1:57:35] though
[1:57:36] but Jesus known set of me see he knew
[1:57:40] that this man will kill me
[1:57:43] he knew that
[1:57:45] is
[1:57:50] you know that this man will kill you and
[1:57:53] you still bear with him and can you do
[1:57:55] it
[1:57:56] can you tell me twice
[1:58:01] and he took him and responsibility
[1:58:07] let me explain you Jesus
[1:58:13] never even talk about it Jesus never
[1:58:16] even asked him for the inventory
[1:58:19] I'm enough a report he just let him
[1:58:21] continue
[1:58:22] do you have a scripture of a report that
[1:58:25] was given about Judah yeah
[1:58:27] so you take a child of God you give him
[1:58:30] a job in your face and if he does an
[1:58:34] error you start saying this is your
[1:58:36] brother
[1:58:38] talk about talk to his God and then shut
[1:58:41] up
[1:58:42] [Music]
[1:58:44] I mean I mean
[1:58:48] do you understand that well
[1:58:51] do you understand that well
[1:58:54] listen to this
[1:58:56] Mercy oh thank you Jesus
[1:58:58] I'm going to go to paragraphs I'm not
[1:59:02] going to read everything brother Branham
[1:59:04] says
[1:59:06] no matter if you spoke in terms
[1:59:14] every all that goes together with the
[1:59:16] things
[1:59:17] speaking in tongue gifts it's always
[1:59:21] following them
[1:59:23] and if that word
[1:59:27] I'm not going to be caught by that
[1:59:34] in the message when the angel came to me
[1:59:37] it is this
[1:59:40] listen to me
[1:59:43] come online
[1:59:53] this is the truth
[1:59:58] we can have gift without knowing god
[2:00:02] God
[2:00:04] obey awards are connected you you can
[2:00:07] have gift without knowing god Japan
[2:00:11] I thought people will say Amen
[2:00:16] even says
[2:00:19] in 1965 in Paradox Bradham says
[2:00:25] he said Divine Healing is the children's
[2:00:28] bread
[2:00:31] and Paradox
[2:00:33] in January the 17th
[2:00:39] 1965.
[2:00:43] it's a different paragraph whether you
[2:00:45] take it from the uh
[2:00:48] healing is the children it's in the
[2:00:51] atonement
[2:00:55] and the atonement first applied to your
[2:00:58] soul
[2:01:04] always forerun every message and every
[2:01:08] message in order to gather the people
[2:01:09] Madam Jesus
[2:01:13] many people come to a healing meeting
[2:01:20] or maybe at a musical concert many
[2:01:22] people can fall survey
[2:01:25] but when it comes to save a poor soul
[2:01:28] you won't see many people that will be
[2:01:31] interested
[2:01:32] why that
[2:01:34] girl is not even healing like concern oh
[2:01:38] music account

[2:03:37] even our denomination
[2:03:40] we have a right to respect him
[2:03:49] we have to respect

[2:04:00] and go and preach to them
[2:04:03] amen amen
[2:04:07] do you understand
[2:04:09] we yes that's why brother Branham says
[2:04:16] maybe we will never meet again

[2:13:05] so the preacher of the Samaritan woman
[2:13:08] called Jesus
[2:13:11] showing for him from where word
[2:13:17] this one was reflecting the modern
[2:13:19] opinion of the time
[2:13:24] but that little prostitute woman that he
[2:13:27] met and say is
[2:13:48] he will tell us all things
[2:13:51] so she recognized the anointed one why
[2:13:58] because he was fulfilling the scriptural
[2:14:01] requirement since Sun said

[2:14:07] together
[2:14:07] [Music]

[2:15:01] spirit
[2:15:02] expressing Jehovah
[2:15:05] what he was and what he is

[2:32:27] amen
[2:32:28] what a message of unity
[2:32:32] the biggest trouble we have is because
[2:32:34] of lack of Revelation
[2:32:37] amen
[2:32:38] that's why I told somebody I say
[2:32:40] in order to preach this message
[2:32:43] you need to make sure you got the spirit
[2:32:45] that was with William Marion Branham
[2:32:50] and from there you will really catch
[2:32:52] what the prophet was saying and what the
[2:32:55] prophet saw that's why brother Branham
[2:32:57] saying he can never over emphasize the
[2:33:00] need of a revelation to the believer
[2:33:03] once you receive the true revelation of
[2:33:05] this message then there is no more
[2:33:07] fasting you are heading toward heaven
[2:33:10] and moving forward praying one for
[2:33:13] another let's pray Heavenly Father
[2:33:16] Lord we are approaching you humbly
[2:33:18] tonight
[2:33:20] father thanking you once again for your
[2:33:22] grace

[2:33:41] I will be blessed and edified by the
[2:33:44] sermon that was preached tonight
[2:33:47] father it's a heart searching testimony
[2:33:50] a heart searching sermon where Lord
[2:33:54] father each one of us
[2:33:56] should spend their time in the quietness
[2:33:58] of the day
[2:34:00] thinking over their life
[2:34:03] and checking to see whether we are in
[2:34:06] the faith
[2:34:09] like brother Branham say we didn't come
[2:34:11] to be in a message but to get into the
[2:34:14] message
[2:34:15] father
[2:34:16] may you unfold the revelation
[2:34:19] to those that don't have it

[2:34:41] because this is a wake-up call
[2:34:43] to realize Where We Are where we have
[2:34:46] failed
[2:34:47] and father to recalibrate ourselves
[2:34:50] and stand in the middle of the road
[2:34:53] Lord may you strengthen brother Charles
