So the boys the the patriarch knows what is going on with the vow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry young uh young sisters, adult I told them things I was I didn't teach you for some reason. He came from the patriarch. I was sitting a brother Kelly before even we start and the scripture keep coming and I have to write scripture. So we went we had even one person who was not even a message believer &gt;&gt; not even in a message came up with braided hair &gt;&gt; but you should see how the word [laughter] was going and piercing that soul. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were there right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I mean we went scripture and never I I taught them things I didn't even know myself because it was vow in the scriptures after scripture after scripture after they got so many scripture in the v a vow is a dangerous thing &gt;&gt; amen yesterday &gt;&gt; the bible say he binds your soul &gt;&gt; that's right [screaming] &gt;&gt; I brought that from the bible yesterday &gt;&gt; he brands your soul and you are binding your soul by a word &gt;&gt; that's Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They have the scripture.

But brother Brandham say it's not even a preacher that bind you. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; I gave them a coach yesterday. Brother Brandham say it's not a preacher that marries you. &gt;&gt; He say you are married by your own word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; By your promise. He say it's not a magistrate. It's not even a preacher. What we do here, we just sanction &gt;&gt; what you already have done somewhere else. &gt;&gt; So I told them, young man, it's not about decoration going in downtown and put uh candles all over and make a big show. I say you will be in trouble, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What did I tell you yesterday?

It's impossible for this message. It's it it's God. &gt;&gt; This message is nobody but God &gt;&gt; to line up. When brother Brandham was speaking, he didn't give all the scripture I gave yesterday. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham just laid the foundation and when we took the scripture and took the message and put it together, hand and glove fitting all together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I warned them stay away from trouble. I told them, I said, "You have a free way to not make any mistake and marry without any problem and we don't have to deal with anything because a vow is a dangerous thing." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So parent, let's stick with what we are teaching the children here because I'm pulling that from the Bible and from the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want to deal with divorce cases. &gt;&gt; No, sir. in your generation.
