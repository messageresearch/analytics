[38:44] the name of jesus christ
[38:46] amen god bless you all tonight
[38:52] we thank you all musician
[38:55] and i want to thank also our pastor who
[38:58] said
[39:12] but every time he's bringing a minister
[39:15] whether it's a local or outside minister
[39:18] duties a person you see everybody that
[39:21] has been ministering through this church
[39:24] they always build up upon something in
[39:27] this church
[39:30] and we are all benefiting from there and
[39:32] we are growing
[39:34] [Music]
[39:37] may the lord bless our pastor for that
[39:39] spirit of simplicity amen
[39:42] amen
[39:47] if you notice on our scripture tonight
[39:50] uh we started with ephesians
[39:52] five verse fourteen nunavut musa
[40:11] [Music]
[40:12] my subject tonight is awake
[40:16] that that sleepeth arise from the dead
[40:19] and christ shall give thee light
[40:29] [Music]
[40:31] the same scripture is in romans 13
[40:34] verse 11
[40:42] [Music]
[40:44] that it is very important that you know
[40:46] the time that we are living in is the
[40:52] time to awake from sleep
[40:56] every prayer they know
[41:00] for now is our salvation nearer than
[41:03] when we believed
[41:07] in verse 12 he said the night is first
[41:09] spent
[41:11] the day is a hand
[41:18] let us therefore cast off the works of
[41:21] darkness
[41:22] and let us put on the armor of light
[41:26] brothers and sisters in the lord
[41:29] [Music]
[41:33] the lord jesus christ is calling each
[41:35] one of us tonight
[41:38] that we must wake up
[41:42] because we are living in such a
[41:44] treacherous time
[42:01] and the bible says that we must awake
[42:04] because
[42:04] we are sleeping like dead people amen
[42:08] amen
[42:10] [Music]
[42:13] let me read something in second peter
[42:15] verse 3
[42:16] uh chapter 3 verse 9 to 10 the bible
[42:18] says this
[42:21] [Music]
[42:25] the lord is not slack concerning his
[42:28] promise
[42:31] as some man counts likeness
[42:36] but he's long suffering to orders
[42:41] [Music]
[42:42] not willing that any should perish
[42:45] [Music]
[42:47] but that all should come to repentance
[42:50] [Music]
[42:53] but the day of the lord will come as a
[42:55] fifth in the night
[43:07] the heavens shall pass away with a great
[43:09] noise and the elements are met with
[43:11] fervent heat
[43:12] and the earth also and the works that
[43:14] are therein
[43:15] shall be burned up
[43:18] [Music]
[43:20] if you notice here it is not the will of
[43:23] god for any
[43:24] to perish
[43:28] god doesn't want anybody to remain in
[43:31] sin
[43:32] [Music]
[43:35] you will even notice when you start in
[43:37] the book of genesis
[43:43] donate or friends and friends when they
[43:46] both offered their offering unto the
[43:48] lord with evil
[43:50] friends the god granted to the offering
[43:55] of evil
[43:59] and the bible stated that can't change
[44:01] his countenance
[44:05] and if you notice before even can
[44:09] kill his brother
[44:12] if you notice in the scriptures
[44:16] god came first to warn him
[44:20] and god begin to deal with him why are
[44:23] you angry
[44:24] angry if you did something that is wrong
[44:30] you all you need to do is just fix it
[44:34] but can't
[44:42] and that's the same thing the scripture
[44:44] is telling us today
[44:46] that it is not god doesn't want to lose
[44:48] anybody god want that everybody
[44:51] repent but the nature of
[44:55] men god does
[44:58] man doesn't want to hurt them
[45:01] that's why we face lot of issue in our
[45:04] lives amen
[45:05] amen israel that's a party
[45:08] in the church israel and the uh and the
[45:11] church
[45:12] in the in the sermon israel and the
[45:15] church part five
[45:18] which in 1953 march the 29th
[45:22] tell a paragraph in paragraph 127.
[45:25] let's prophet the decency brother
[45:27] brandon says this
[45:30] is
[45:45] your condition tonight accept that
[45:48] deliverance
[45:50] you have to accept your deliverance
[45:53] according to the things you are facing
[45:57] you need to take possession of your
[45:59] inheritance
[46:02] always remind us
[46:09] that every problem or situation in this
[46:12] life
[46:18] the scripture says for instance that no
[46:21] matter
[46:21] should be taken into account unless we
[46:24] have two or three witnesses
[46:26] lost
[46:39] from the dead
[46:55] number one you must take conscience of
[46:57] your situation
[46:58] you must wake up from your situation
[47:02] you must wake up from that sleepness
[47:04] that got you
[47:06] and that number two you must rise amen
[47:22] but you must move on and take possession
[47:26] father the wind you face no matter this
[47:29] problem you face
[47:32] but brother branham said you must stand
[47:34] and you must possess your possessions
[47:50] the bible said that arise and shine for
[47:53] that light is come
[47:58] because isaiah is speaking about the
[48:00] restoration of jerusalem
[48:17] if you take maybe abraham or something
[48:20] so
[48:24] but you must be the one replacing
[48:26] abraham tonight by your life
[48:29] amen amen glory
[48:32] glory be to
[48:44] preach in 1963 in november uh
[48:48] 1963
[48:51] in paragraph 105
[48:55] [Music]
[48:56] i'm just going to read something just a
[48:58] glance today
[49:06] that human beings are always telling
[49:09] what god did
[49:12] and what we believe what's going in what
[49:15] god
[49:16] is going to do
[49:20] but always forgetting what he is doing
[49:23] oh
[49:27] you that you are not living in the times
[49:29] of abraham and david
[49:31] and the author you are not even in your
[49:35] future yet
[49:36] together you are still living in the
[49:38] present
[49:43] and our time is a present time
[49:46] [Music]
[49:49] he wants to be called the on-time god
[49:53] and you one day
[50:06] [Music]
[50:07] and the lord explained to moses that i
[50:09] would like to deliver my people
[50:12] okay moses says okay may god jesus
[50:15] but when i got there over the monday get
[50:19] down
[50:20] israel will question me who is that god
[50:23] that sent me
[50:25] what is the name that i shall give
[50:27] israel about the god
[50:31] do you know how god answered moses
[50:34] he said moses if they ask you my name
[50:37] tell them
[50:45] he never says i will send me jesse
[50:49] but i am sent me
[51:04] one day he was with his disciples
[51:08] and he could talk to them with a
[51:10] different uh
[51:11] parable and things like that and he was
[51:14] talking to them about the father all the
[51:16] time
[51:17] but you know one day something happened
[51:19] the discipline disappeared the disciple
[51:22] says that's good master
[51:24] everything you have been preaching to us
[51:25] about the father that's yours
[51:28] but today we are tired of hearing my
[51:31] father my father
[51:33] you are tired of you talking about your
[51:35] father
[51:37] show us the father and that will
[51:40] satisfies us and that is what is written
[51:44] in the scripture
[51:46] so i don't know the condition
[51:49] felt
[52:03] oh you are behaving like somebody who's
[52:06] in the future
[52:08] the future does not belong to you
[52:11] the future belongs to god
[52:15] god knows what is coming up on the
[52:17] future
[52:18] god knows what is going to happen
[52:20] tomorrow
[52:22] so the future belongs to god not you
[52:25] it does not belong to you
[52:28] you you need to live on your time
[52:32] and the god of the present time
[52:37] and jesus gave the disciple an answer
[52:40] he said philip it has been so long
[52:50] [Music]
[52:58] that within my flesh here
[53:01] if you see me you see the father amen
[53:04] amen
[53:09] the one that knows the father is the
[53:11] same one that came down
[53:25] that's why the people got trouble
[53:29] [Music]
[53:32] when the woman at the world told him you
[53:34] know this is the
[53:35] the well our father jacob he said
[53:39] it's good you can talk about abraham
[53:41] your father
[53:43] but let me tell you guys the day your
[53:45] father abraham
[53:46] saw me they said he was so happy
[53:53] they looked at him they said you're not
[53:54] even 50 years old
[53:56] [Music]
[53:57] are you talking about you being with
[53:59] abraham
[54:03] just to show you that he is the i am
[54:07] the god of power
[54:27] [Music]
[54:36] you must believe the word of god you
[54:39] must believe the promises of god amen
[54:41] amen the prophet
[54:45] the job brother branham spoke about job
[54:48] amen amen
[54:52] explained something very good about job
[54:56] equity listen to this
[55:00] in the message here that is in you
[55:04] paragraph 183
[55:08] the one who was in job
[55:12] was greater than the skin worms
[55:16] and death and the grave an effect
[55:22] [Music]
[55:46] in my
[56:01] nobody came here to declare unto jobs
[56:05] let's go to job job chapter
[56:09] there job chapter 2.
[56:33] all i wanted to tell you is nobody put
[56:36] those words
[56:37] in the mouth of job job himself nobody
[56:40] confessed for job
[56:42] he didn't he was the one
[56:46] confessing his own problem amen amen
[56:51] just like you you must confess for your
[56:53] own life
[57:04] in the bible the bible says that at the
[57:06] beginning god created the heaven and
[57:08] earth
[57:09] so with what did god created amen
[57:14] i'm asking you the question what did god
[57:16] use to create
[57:17] amen amen
[57:20] god is the word
[57:24] and at
[57:36] let me help somebody who is discouraged
[57:38] tonight
[57:42] in the beginning god created the heaven
[57:44] and earth
[57:47] and the earth was without form and void
[57:50] and darkness was upon the face of the
[57:52] dead
[57:54] and the spirit of god move upon the face
[57:56] of the world
[57:57] now listen to this verse 3
[58:00] and god says let there be light
[58:05] and there was
[58:11] [Music]
[58:13] when you go to proverbs chapter 2 i
[58:15] believe
[58:17] the book of prophecy for example we
[58:20] probably proverbs 18 instead
[58:24] verse 17 verse 21
[58:28] the bible says this
[58:31] death and lies are in the power of the
[58:34] tongue
[58:38] and they that love it shall eat the
[58:40] fruit thereof
[58:43] so you must first believe we know that
[58:48] and i'm going back to genesis 1 3.
[58:52] prayer the bible says god created but he
[58:54] spoke
[58:56] when he spoke and things
[58:59] came to existence brother branham
[59:02] explained
[59:08] [Music]
[59:15] but god believed his own word
[59:18] amen amen
[59:21] when god believed his own word
[59:25] then he came to manifestation
[59:45] in the beginning was the word the second
[59:47] book you already know about it
[59:49] amen amen
[59:55] in the beginning and the word was with
[59:59] god
[1:00:00] and the word was god the same was in the
[1:00:04] beginning with god
[1:00:06] now listen to verse three
[1:00:09] all things were made
[1:00:26] even you and me it is the word of god
[1:00:30] that created us
[1:00:33] today we have books and sermons
[1:00:37] so what is in these books and sermons
[1:00:41] he was first a spoken word by a prophet
[1:00:46] we have believed the spoken word of a
[1:00:48] prophet
[1:00:52] brother branham believed the spoken word
[1:00:54] of god
[1:00:56] and god told him that take the pen
[1:01:00] take a purpose and write this and by the
[1:01:03] problem
[1:01:04] and brother believe on what he wrote
[1:01:07] and brother branham received the benefit
[1:01:10] of the word
[1:01:12] and we have it in books and tapes
[1:01:16] and tapes
[1:01:20] and that same word is in the bible but
[1:01:24] what is the bible the bible is god's
[1:01:26] spoken word
[1:01:27] amen amen but where is your situation
[1:01:33] the quran god only asks you to believe
[1:01:50] 1821. 21. so god
[1:01:53] took the power of death and
[1:01:56] laughs and put it on your tongue
[1:02:01] if you want to change your life
[1:02:16] and it's going to change your situation
[1:02:32] i begin
[1:03:00] maybe you are appending saturdays
[1:03:04] i don't care what your name is

[1:04:57] importantly no matter the situation that
[1:05:00] is happening

[1:05:20] to that condition
[1:05:23] so they are they they have been put to
[1:05:26] sleep by the enemy

[1:05:37] that you must awake
[1:05:41] and you must rise so that god can give

[1:05:58] your confession

[1:17:20] jonah
[1:17:22] amen amen
[1:17:27] i'm not going to read a lot
[1:17:39] now the lord had prepared a great fish
[1:17:42] to swallow up jonah
[1:17:43] and jonah was in the belly of the fish
[1:17:45] three days and three nights
[1:17:50] then jonah pray unto the lord his god
[1:17:53] out of the fish's belly
[1:17:56] let me ask you do you understand the
[1:17:58] situation jordan was in
[1:18:01] sweden listen to this
[1:18:04] verse 3 he says this
[1:18:08] for that has cast me into the future
[1:18:12] i have prayed into the lord
[1:18:15] and the lord heard me descending
[1:18:19] from the deep
[1:18:21] [Music]
[1:18:23] i called and you answered me
[1:18:28] you put me into the dip
[1:18:32] you cast me in the midst of the sins
[1:18:35] and the flood compassed me about
[1:19:07] just look at the picture that this man
[1:19:10] was in it
[1:19:12] now look at your own life and compare
[1:19:14] the two
[1:19:17] look at the situation that is that are
[1:19:19] coming left and right
[1:19:30] so there was no gps he could not see
[1:19:34] anything but he spoke to the lord
[1:19:37] in that condition
[1:19:41] how can you open your mouth in the field
[1:19:45] but even in his soul he can speak
[1:20:02] there is no wireless problem
[1:20:05] the network is always wired pretty good
[1:20:11] when god is speaking to his children
[1:20:15] that network is secure
[1:20:18] god heals and he looks at your situation
[1:20:21] he looks at the word amen what position
[1:20:24] are you taking
[1:20:25] jonah spoke
[1:20:28] in the difficult a situation
[1:20:32] where he was corner-squeezed
[1:20:36] and he says that god heard him
[1:20:40] is that god of jonah different than your
[1:20:43] god
[1:20:44] is he different than the god we worship
[1:20:48] is jonah a human being different than us
[1:20:52] he even rejected what god told him
[1:20:56] and god put him in that situation in
[1:21:10] the same thing god must hear you tonight
[1:21:22] and we saw that everything was created
[1:21:24] by the word of god
[1:21:32] [Music]
[1:21:37] and we are what we are by the message
[1:21:39] that came through brother
[1:21:46] and that word changed us and we are
[1:21:49] different
[1:21:49] than other people why because we believe
[1:21:54] in that word
[1:21:56] so you must believe the word
[1:22:02] if god could change a being like jacob
[1:22:06] how can he do the same for you
[1:22:15] we speak about the good things that
[1:22:17] those people do
[1:22:19] but they also did bad things in their
[1:22:21] lives
[1:22:34] when that deceiver met god
[1:22:38] he said i believe the word of god today
[1:22:41] i'm not going to let you go my condition
[1:22:44] must change
[1:22:47] i cannot continue always deceiving
[1:22:50] people
[1:22:52] that fifth spirit must depart that lying
[1:22:56] spirit must depart from my life
[1:22:59] the sin in my life must be important
[1:23:02] so today that sickness must leave and
[1:23:09] [Music]
[1:23:20] a man like moses a
[1:23:23] very angry man he even killed somebody
[1:23:27] in hiding
[1:23:28] amen he had his
[1:23:32] weaknesses
[1:23:46] he knew everything that egyptian taught
[1:23:48] him he had all that great knowledge
[1:23:51] he was a man that was a forceful speaker
[1:23:53] very intelligent man
[1:23:56] but when he met the pillar of fire when
[1:23:59] he met god
[1:24:02] because it says you know what i don't
[1:24:04] know how to talk
[1:24:06] he found somebody who can transform he
[1:24:09] found somebody that can change him
[1:24:13] that man is called god he is able to
[1:24:16] change you tonight
[1:24:19] he is able to change you tonight
[1:24:22] no matter your infirmities
[1:24:26] or your situation
[1:24:37] he is the master of time and
[1:24:39] circumstances
[1:24:41] he is able to change all things amen
[1:24:44] amen
[1:24:47] he changed the life of sarah
[1:24:50] he changed the story of anna he changed
[1:24:54] the story of roof
[1:24:55] bull boys
[1:25:04] if you talk to them today they will
[1:25:08] confess to you and witness that god
[1:25:10] changes
[1:25:11] that god is able to change all things
[1:25:15] all you have to do is be connected to
[1:25:17] his promises
[1:25:20] it is possible for god to work with your
[1:25:22] heart
[1:25:24] god is able to change your nature
[1:25:27] god is able to change you you must rise
[1:25:33] stop doubting amen amen
[1:25:42] rahab was a prostitute it's all written
[1:25:45] in your scripture
[1:25:48] can you imagine a woman like temer went
[1:25:51] and slept with his father-in-law
[1:25:57] he killed christian he killed servant of
[1:26:01] god
[1:26:02] amen god never looked at those
[1:26:05] situations
[1:26:19] if you read the story of those people
[1:26:21] rahab ruth
[1:26:23] paul those are the people that took a
[1:26:27] decision for their life
[1:26:30] they believed the word of their time
[1:26:34] they believed in the word of god
[1:26:37] and god changed their life
[1:26:40] and god changed their lives god changed
[1:26:43] their life
[1:26:46] all those people started bad
[1:27:00] and they succeeded
[1:27:15] if you did something wrong he's still
[1:27:18] the savior
[1:27:20] when he was looking for adam
[1:27:24] and adam was hiding god didn't have a
[1:27:28] weapon
[1:27:29] he had the lamb
[1:27:44] i didn't even read about joseph
[1:27:47] joseph to change yourself
[1:27:50] go ahead and preach joseph okay okay
[1:27:54] glory to god
[1:28:11] the lamb was already been slain
[1:28:16] before even you begin to think
[1:28:22] the lamb was already being slain amen
[1:28:26] amen
[1:28:30] but you're still living a life of
[1:28:32] condemnation amen
[1:28:33] amen
[1:28:37] why god already saved you
[1:28:41] when you are living under condemnation
[1:28:46] when brother when the pastor is
[1:28:47] preaching all his servants of god
[1:28:49] preaching
[1:28:50] god will use that channel because they
[1:28:53] are
[1:28:53] tools of god
[1:29:03] and believe that god already saved you
[1:29:07] and since he already saved you
[1:29:11] god never saved you for you to continue
[1:29:13] on your condition
[1:29:15] no
[1:29:18] maybe you did something wrong in the
[1:29:20] past
[1:29:22] and you were living under condemnation
[1:29:25] but now when you meet god
[1:29:27] god bring you pardon us god give you the
[1:29:31] lamb
[1:29:33] [Music]
[1:29:34] the reason why he's giving you that so
[1:29:36] that you cannot continue in the sinless
[1:29:39] and that you can be saved amen amen
[1:29:42] amen because we don't want people to
[1:29:46] misunderstand
[1:29:49] that oh since i'm already saved
[1:29:53] so since i know the truth now i can
[1:29:56] continue to sin no
[1:29:57] that's not what we're talking about
[1:30:00] you did something wrong in the past
[1:30:02] that's that's that
[1:30:03] that was by mistake amen
[1:30:07] if you fail you must rise
[1:30:12] the one who always stands
[1:30:15] the only one that fell and never stood
[1:30:19] was the serpent
[1:30:21] by the children of god if they found the
[1:30:23] riser
[1:30:25] they believed the word of god they
[1:30:27] believed the word of god
[1:30:29] [Applause]
[1:30:31] so god have to display his attributes he
[1:30:34] was a father
[1:30:36] amen amen
[1:30:39] when they said when they asked jesus
[1:30:42] jesus said i am the father you see me
[1:30:45] you see the father
[1:31:02] [Music]
[1:31:10] and those fruits are his children you
[1:31:13] and me
[1:31:15] if jesus was not dead
[1:31:16] [Music]
[1:31:19] he would have taken all the deity with
[1:31:21] him all the power should be gone
[1:31:24] but because the kill no witch died and
[1:31:26] rise again
[1:31:27] he gave the promises and he fulfilled
[1:31:30] the promises
[1:31:32] and that promise belongs to you it's
[1:31:35] also for me
[1:31:37] it's the promise of the holy ghost
[1:31:41] why that promise of the holy ghost so
[1:31:44] that the work that he did
[1:31:47] the church should be able to continue
[1:31:50] on the same work jesus believed his own
[1:31:54] word
[1:31:55] jesus was going somewhere and he cursed
[1:31:58] the trees
[1:32:00] because he want to eat something but he
[1:32:02] believed
[1:32:03] his word the disciple did not believe us
[1:32:06] but on the next day the disciples saw
[1:32:09] that the tree dried up
[1:32:10] and jesus told them and paul said
[1:32:13] look at the tree you cursed it's already
[1:32:15] dried up
[1:32:18] jesus always believed his word so we
[1:32:21] demonstrated here
[1:32:23] you must believe in the promises of god
[1:32:26] and the promises of god are in you
[1:32:29] now present unto god his own promises
[1:32:34] tell god that i am a sinner and your
[1:32:37] name is savior
[1:32:39] i am a sinner
[1:32:44] maybe i'm in a difficult situation
[1:32:47] but you are the answer to that situation
[1:32:51] and i know that you are able that's what
[1:32:54] we always sing here
[1:32:56] and god is still able to change your
[1:32:59] situation
[1:33:01] to change your problem to take your
[1:33:04] problem
[1:33:05] and transformatory he's still able
[1:33:10] tom is gone joseph
[1:33:16] lord glory be to god
[1:33:34] paragraph 189
[1:33:38] 198. the prophet
[1:33:41] jesus said but branham says this come to
[1:33:44] pray

[1:36:19] and that's the word that created you
[1:36:23] and that's the word that is giving you
[1:36:25] commission
