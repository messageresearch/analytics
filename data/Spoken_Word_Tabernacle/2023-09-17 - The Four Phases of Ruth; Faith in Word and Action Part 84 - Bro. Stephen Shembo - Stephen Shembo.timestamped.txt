[48:32] expression amen glory to God I believe
[48:35] everybody are reading their Bible
[48:38] everybody are
[48:40] uh we are reading our Cod book our
[48:44] church edges the seals and the 70 weeks
[48:47] of Daniel Amen make sure you keep your
[48:51] word your head in the word
[48:53] not on television not on the information
[48:56] we listen to information for so long and
[48:58] there is so much lies on what is
[49:01] happening on the media let's keep our
[49:03] head in the word one chapter in the
[49:05] morning one chapter before you go to bed
[49:07] your pastor will always remind you that
[49:09] amen we had a wonderful question and
[49:13] answer yesterday I went home
[49:17] I went home and I felt like I just
[49:20] preached a whole sermon because it was
[49:22] so anointed
[49:24] until I have to tell the Deacon go ahead
[49:26] and record this so I can remember those
[49:28] answers because the answer was coming
[49:30] right away but unfortunately I'm not
[49:33] going to release that for the prophecy
[49:35] of the people because when I have
[49:37] questions and answer we interact with
[49:39] the people so I don't want people to go
[49:41] ahead and hear what other people were
[49:43] saying and it's all over the world no
[49:45] sorry
[49:48] talk to the people that were there and
[49:50] they can get it amen I just want to keep
[49:52] the answers so in case the new
[49:55] generation is coming up and they have
[49:57] the same age so the same question we can
[49:59] go ahead and handle it Lord's willing
[50:01] October the 21st brother Kelly if I'm
[50:05] not mistaken that's the next question
[50:07] and answer October 21st I have few
[50:11] questions left so almost finish all your
[50:13] questions unless you add them and Lord's
[50:16] willing we will try to dig into it one
[50:19] was hard we could not dig into it I
[50:21] believe it's the Holy Spirit we'll talk
[50:23] about the dreams when you have dreams
[50:25] who's supposed to tell you about the
[50:27] dream
[50:29] let's keep it that's fine everything
[50:31] will be okay sister Devon you let me
[50:34] know to confirm the topic with every
[50:37] sister we talked about it so make sure
[50:40] they're all in agreement you send me a
[50:42] text message shoot up the date and we go
[50:45] from there amen if I forgot something
[50:47] you let me know Deacon but I believe I
[50:50] got everything squared away so let's
[50:51] stand and go straight to the word of God
[50:55] amen
[50:57] foreign
[51:10] okay
[51:11] if you meet with me
[51:14] and you have a struggle in your life
[51:17] and I talked to you about it
[51:20] it doesn't stop me from preaching about
[51:22] it
[51:25] did it make sense
[51:27] so if you see me preaching about it
[51:29] don't think I'm talking about you
[51:31] because there could be somebody else
[51:33] who's struggling the same thing
[51:35] so it stays spiritual like that so when
[51:37] I'm moving on with the machine gun I'm
[51:40] not shooting you shooting the devil just
[51:42] know that it could be somebody else I've
[51:44] seen it many times you say something you
[51:46] talk to somebody you come and you and
[51:48] the Holy Spirit bring it and it's
[51:49] somebody else and the Holy Spirit bring
[51:51] it and it's somebody else so when you
[51:53] hear me saying don't say I was talking
[51:55] to the pastor and that's why he brought
[51:56] it to the pulpit
[51:58] because you're not the only one
[51:59] struggling with it
[52:01] so I'm saying this so you have peace
[52:03] when I'm shooting
[52:05] I'm shooting to the devil
[52:07] okay so if you come you tell me
[52:10] something it doesn't mean that never
[52:12] preach about it if it's the word that
[52:14] will continue to preach about it there
[52:16] is one thing I'm really grateful to God
[52:19] number one I don't have a bishop
[52:22] except the Lord Jesus Christ and I have
[52:24] freedom to deliver what God put in my
[52:27] heart
[52:29] because I Want to Be Free when I meet
[52:32] him I want to go to heaven please I want
[52:34] to go to heaven I don't want to stay
[52:36] here so I want to make sure I'm also
[52:38] clear to get in heaven we okay
[52:44] I love you so much but I gotta stay true
[52:48] to the world and I have to deliver the
[52:50] message the way it's given Deuteronomy
[52:53] chapter 30.
[52:57] love doesn't means compromise
[53:03] amen
[53:06] glory to God
[53:10] amen if you follow the sermon on
[53:12] Wednesday Brothers Aaron was already
[53:14] preaching the Sunday sermon
[53:16] those who got it you write in line
[53:19] Deuteronomy 30 verse 6 if you dare you
[53:22] can say Amen
[53:25] um
[53:25] but they were just a part of me
[53:29] just as much
[53:31] please
[53:33] amen you there amen and the Lord your
[53:36] God will circumcise your heart
[53:40] we already went through that because the
[53:42] heart need to be circumcised what
[53:45] happened in the flesh was already
[53:46] attacked but God was targeting the heart
[53:49] the Lord will circumcise your heart
[53:51] comma and the heart of your seed so the
[53:55] promise of circumcision is unto you and
[53:58] to your children and as many as the Lord
[54:01] your God will call do you see how the
[54:03] Old Testament the New Testament worked
[54:06] together you might be seated
[54:09] and
[54:11] to love the Lord your God we already
[54:13] went through this how the Holy Ghost
[54:15] comes and bring the love of God Amen to
[54:19] love the Lord your God with all your
[54:21] heart
[54:22] and with all your soul that you may live
[54:26] so the purpose of the circumcision is
[54:29] that it brings the love of God he puts
[54:33] you together in invisible Union with God
[54:36] and God become the top of your life you
[54:38] love him above everything
[54:40] amen verse 7 and the Lord your God will
[54:44] put all these curses
[54:47] upon hope thine enemies well you see how
[54:50] being an enemy to a child of God is a
[54:53] problem
[54:54] you're bringing curses to yourself
[54:56] if you declare yourself an enemy to an
[54:59] elect
[55:01] you just open up a direct deposit from
[55:04] hell
[55:06] correct of curses amen
[55:10] and the Lord your God will put all these
[55:13] curses upon your enemies
[55:17] remember yesterday oh nobody anything
[55:20] except one thing love
[55:24] amen amen which persecuted you
[55:28] verse 8 and you shall return and obey
[55:32] the voice of the Lord and do all his
[55:35] Commandments which are commanded which I
[55:37] command you this day
[55:39] get ready now and the Lord your God will
[55:42] make you have plentice plantures in
[55:45] every word of your hand
[55:50] can you say amen amen so you can get
[55:53] blessing
[55:56] God so everything that you do is
[55:58] supposed to be have
[56:00] plenty years
[56:05] God
[56:06] Jesus gave the parable of the talent
[56:10] and everyone that have the parable uh
[56:13] everyone that received the talent had
[56:15] the potential to receive a hundred
[56:18] percent research the return even the one
[56:20] who refused if he would have put it to
[56:23] work it would have worked
[56:26] amen
[56:27] so when God gives you something he knows
[56:29] what he's doing
[56:31] amen God knows what he's doing amen he
[56:36] says he will make you planchous in every
[56:38] work of your hand
[56:40] in the fruit of your water Daddy
[56:43] and in the fruit of your water cattle
[56:46] and in the fruit of the water
[56:48] for water for good forever
[56:51] for the Lord will again Rejoice over you
[56:55] for good
[56:57] as he Rejoice over your father everybody
[57:00] okay
[57:02] watch verse 11. if you shall hearken we
[57:05] already dealt with the Eve if you shall
[57:08] hearken to the voice of the Lord your
[57:09] God to keep his commandment and his
[57:12] statute which are written in this book
[57:15] of the what law so there is a book
[57:19] called The Book of the law
[57:22] the book of the law amen
[57:26] this book of the law
[57:28] Israel in the Old Testament had the book
[57:31] called The Book of the law and in that
[57:34] book there are stuff that are written
[57:35] there and God said if you follow
[57:37] everything that is in that book amen
[57:40] verse 10 if you hearken
[57:44] if you hearken you shall hearken to the
[57:46] voice of the Lord your God to keep his
[57:48] commandment and his statute which are
[57:51] written in this book of the Lord
[57:54] and if you turn to the Lord your God and
[57:58] if you turn to the Lord your God with
[58:00] all your heart and we fall your soul for
[58:04] this commandment which I commend you
[58:06] this day is not hidden
[58:10] from you
[58:13] the Commandment is not hidden
[58:19] from you in other words the Commandment
[58:22] is available
[58:25] if he was sealed
[58:29] it is often
[58:32] are we okay this commandment is not
[58:35] hidden
[58:36] from you neither is he how far off so
[58:41] this book can be far off
[58:45] but God is saying it is no longer
[58:47] pharaoh
[58:49] in other words the book
[58:51] moved
[58:58] the book can move
[59:02] from one location
[59:07] Amen to another location
[59:11] and we know that the book of the law is
[59:14] the law of God
[59:16] it is God but God is saying that that
[59:19] book
[59:20] is no longer with me
[59:26] I know you're having trouble
[59:28] stay where you are let's go to chapter
[59:30] 33 and we come back
[59:35] let's go to chapter 33.
[59:38] we will see how this how did the Lord
[59:41] get to Israel
[59:43] okay
[59:44] okay
[59:46] chapter 33 just a few chapter
[59:49] you there amen verse two you there amen
[59:58] here brother Benjamin
[1:00:00] that is creating an echo
[1:00:03] because it's a bazooka
[1:00:09] try that one
[1:00:10] amen uh-huh
[1:00:12] that's it okay I'm starting to learn
[1:00:15] some tech stuff
[1:00:18] everybody okay verse two and he said the
[1:00:23] Lord came from what Sinai and Rose up
[1:00:26] from sale to them he Shone forth from
[1:00:30] Mount Paran
[1:00:32] and he came with ten thousands of water
[1:00:35] Saints
[1:00:37] so God came down with people
[1:00:40] I'm reading the Bible
[1:00:43] and when he came down watch clearly from
[1:00:47] water his right hand went a fiery law
[1:00:51] for them so the law
[1:00:55] I mean arrived to Israel by God coming
[1:00:59] down on the mountain
[1:01:04] the mountain of Sana God came down and
[1:01:08] God was had the company
[1:01:12] are we reading the same Bible and in the
[1:01:15] right hand
[1:01:16] of God
[1:01:20] are we okay now I'm reading the Bible in
[1:01:24] the right hand of God there was a law
[1:01:26] and the law came from the right hand of
[1:01:29] God
[1:01:31] amen so the law moved from heaven
[1:01:35] and came down to the Earth by God
[1:01:39] himself
[1:01:40] the Lord himself
[1:01:44] he descended on a mountain
[1:01:47] and we fellow on his right hand
[1:01:51] and he had the company
[1:01:53] to be more specific
[1:01:55] listen to Stephen here in the book of
[1:01:58] acting Stephen said
[1:02:00] who have received the law by the
[1:02:04] disposition of angels
[1:02:08] so we thought that it's just Moses
[1:02:10] talking and coming back
[1:02:12] God came with angels
[1:02:18] and he brought the law God Came Upon the
[1:02:21] mountain
[1:02:23] and met a prophet Called Moses
[1:02:29] Moses went to the mountain and met God
[1:02:33] the god that met Moses in the mountain
[1:02:36] came down with a book Amen in his right
[1:02:40] hand amen with angels
[1:02:43] to deliver unto Moses if you don't
[1:02:47] understand my language what's the
[1:02:49] picture over there
[1:02:53] because according to Revelation 10 the
[1:02:56] mighty Angel also came down the Lord
[1:02:59] himself came down with a book in his
[1:03:02] right hand
[1:03:04] and the book was open
[1:03:09] stop playing with mysteries in this
[1:03:12] message
[1:03:13] this message is the revelation of the
[1:03:16] Mysteries
[1:03:18] yes
[1:03:19] [Music]
[1:03:20] [Applause]
[1:03:26] we don't need the Deep Prince of God
[1:03:29] the Deep things of God move God down
[1:03:35] God could not give that to uh Gabriel
[1:03:39] the Lord himself
[1:03:42] [Applause]
[1:03:43] not anybody else the Lord himself amen
[1:03:49] the message of William Mayon Branham is
[1:03:52] the revelation of the mysteries of God
[1:03:56] love is a mystery
[1:03:59] sin is a mystery the serpent seed is a
[1:04:03] mystery amen so when we're preaching the
[1:04:06] mystery we're preaching everything amen
[1:04:11] I don't know where preacher gets the
[1:04:13] separation between oh we don't need to
[1:04:15] preach the Mysteries we need to preach
[1:04:17] the life of the people how can you
[1:04:19] separate the mystery with the life
[1:04:21] [Applause]
[1:04:25] this is why most of the churches hey I'm
[1:04:30] independent in this message look like
[1:04:32] Pentecostal
[1:04:34] foreign
[1:04:35] [Music]
[1:04:37] look like Baptists
[1:04:40] because they don't want to apply the
[1:04:43] mystery the mystery will separate you
[1:04:46] from denomination
[1:04:48] Pentecost of Hell brought upon and
[1:04:52] preach a message where the Pentecostal
[1:04:53] fell but this message won't fail
[1:04:59] [Applause]
[1:05:01] [Music]
[1:05:04] are you gonna impress a Pentecostal by
[1:05:07] Healing The Sick
[1:05:08] are you going to impress a pen because
[1:05:10] about speaking in tongues you need
[1:05:12] something higher
[1:05:14] a language they don't know
[1:05:17] [Applause]
[1:05:23] we preach the message we're preaching
[1:05:25] the message like Pentecostal and we
[1:05:27] begin to pump people the people are not
[1:05:30] pumped by emotion they pop by revelation
[1:05:36] [Applause]
[1:05:43] God wasted his time to preach to us the
[1:05:47] mystery that we don't need you don't
[1:05:50] need the seals to go to heaven so God
[1:05:53] wasted his time
[1:05:54] the angel of the Lord wasted his time
[1:05:57] God himself came down wasting his time
[1:06:01] it's an insult to the message
[1:06:03] [Applause]
[1:06:07] put me on tick tock
[1:06:13] we clear now
[1:06:14] we're clear now so let's go back to our
[1:06:17] server to our the Deuteronomy 30.
[1:06:23] [Music]
[1:06:25] it's all over the message you don't need
[1:06:27] the Deep things the Bible say for the
[1:06:31] spirit of the Lord searcheth the Deep
[1:06:34] things of God so if you don't know the
[1:06:37] difference I wonder if you got the Holy
[1:06:39] Ghost
[1:06:41] because the Holy Ghost searches the Deep
[1:06:44] things of God
[1:06:46] hey if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:06:48] come let's pray for you
[1:06:54] how can the holy ghost search the
[1:06:56] difference and you say we don't need the
[1:06:58] difference
[1:07:01] any salt to the Holy Spirit
[1:07:05] we don't need the 70 weeks of Daniel so
[1:07:08] why did they preach it
[1:07:11] [Music]
[1:07:15] the Mysteries the Mysteries the
[1:07:18] Mysteries is what is bringing young
[1:07:20] people here in this church I don't force
[1:07:23] them to come to church
[1:07:24] they are very honest when you talk to
[1:07:26] them the mystery is pulling them
[1:07:30] the Red Bull Shark when you begin to
[1:07:34] bring the first pool he just watches
[1:07:36] around
[1:07:37] you bring the second pool he's just
[1:07:40] watching around but when you open the
[1:07:42] world
[1:07:43] [Applause]
[1:07:49] without the opening of the word you can
[1:07:52] feel the church before you wanted the
[1:07:55] rainbow tract is attracted by one thing
[1:07:57] the opening of the world
[1:08:00] because when the world open it is
[1:08:02] releasing the name
[1:08:04] [Applause]
[1:08:07] and there is something in you that say
[1:08:09] wow
[1:08:11] that is nothing but the truth
[1:08:14] [Applause]
[1:08:18] [Music]
[1:08:28] they put me here for a purpose I will
[1:08:32] shoot until I get to heaven
[1:08:35] I'm not gonna back up I'm not
[1:08:37] intimidating
[1:08:39] I will stand for this message
[1:08:41] brother Branham said what happened
[1:08:42] before was the years of preparation
[1:08:45] you heard the sister singing here when
[1:08:47] his mystery come it's an indication of
[1:08:50] his love
[1:08:52] that's why the Capstone is love it is
[1:08:55] God bringing his own self
[1:08:57] [Applause]
[1:09:02] the book that was still now it's open
[1:09:06] when John saw that he began to Jubilee
[1:09:08] in heaven
[1:09:11] [Applause]
[1:09:13] our difference you can sing somewhere
[1:09:16] with this
[1:09:17] but if we begin to bring the word the
[1:09:20] Pentecost I will be sitting but the
[1:09:23] message believer
[1:09:24] you see them on fire
[1:09:27] because the world is coming
[1:09:30] brother Branham says the restoration of
[1:09:34] the word bring the restoration of the
[1:09:36] power
[1:09:37] God sent his word to heal you
[1:09:40] [Applause]

[1:10:02] hours and continue to give you coat

[1:10:15] something new
[1:10:16] because of the seals
[1:10:18] [Applause]

[1:24:32] do you know what confess means do you
[1:24:34] know the one who delivered the box to
[1:24:35] you he's not supposed to open the box
[1:24:39] he's supposed to just take the box the
[1:24:41] way he receive it and deliver that
[1:24:43] that's why the prophet of odd used to
[1:24:46] say that's safe

[1:24:51] the Lord in other words my intellect my
[1:24:55] preferences is not added to this I'm

[1:25:34] so what comes here

[1:26:01] verse uh that was verse 10 verse 10 for
[1:26:05] with the heart man do what Believe It
[1:26:09] Believe to water righteousness and with
[1:26:12] the mouth
[1:26:13] confession confession is made to utter
[1:26:17] salvation so you can not only believe
[1:26:20] with us speaking
[1:26:25] everybody okay everybody okay and you
[1:26:28] cannot speak without doing it
[1:26:34] one push to the other one make a way for
[1:26:38] the other if you believe
[1:26:40] your mouth begin to get some anointing
[1:26:46] when your mouth begin to talk your body
[1:26:48] want to move
[1:26:50] yeah
[1:26:53] everybody clear let's go to the last one
[1:26:56] James
[1:26:57] chapter two oh God
[1:27:02] if you dare you can say a man
[1:27:07] James come after Hebrew
[1:27:12] glory to God James chapter 2.
[1:27:16] very very familiar scripture
[1:27:20] 17.
[1:27:22] amen
[1:27:25] even so what faith
[1:27:28] if he has not what works it is out dead
[1:27:36] being water
[1:27:39] in other words it is impossible
[1:27:43] to have faith without work
[1:27:48] impossible
[1:27:49] if there is a faith without work you
[1:27:53] don't have faith
[1:27:54] it's a dead faith
[1:27:58] Verse 18 yeah a man say you have faith
[1:28:05] and I have works
[1:28:07] show me your faith without work and I
[1:28:11] will show you my faith by my works
[1:28:17] I will show you my faith by
[1:28:23] my words
[1:28:25] that's why brother Branham say words is
[1:28:28] Faith Express
[1:28:31] so the words that you do here is only an
[1:28:35] expression
[1:28:37] or a manifestation
[1:28:40] or a reflection
[1:28:43] of your faith
[1:28:47] everybody clear
[1:28:48] verse 19 you believe that there is one
[1:28:52] God
[1:28:53] you do well
[1:28:55] the devil also believe
[1:28:58] why is it not change
[1:29:00] because we can't go to that process
[1:29:03] and tremble verse 20 but will you also
[1:29:07] will you know oh van man that faith
[1:29:10] without work is how there was not
[1:29:13] Abraham Our Father justified by what
[1:29:17] works when he had offered Isaac his son
[1:29:21] upon the altar
[1:29:22] see
[1:29:24] you have faith
[1:29:26] working what
[1:29:29] with his work and by work was Faith made
[1:29:33] how perfect that word perfect usually
[1:29:36] means complete
[1:29:38] so what start here is incomplete
[1:29:44] amen until it's put in action
[1:29:49] when we reach the action then your faith
[1:29:52] is perfect
[1:29:53] oh your faith is complete all your faith
[1:29:57] has reached its goal
[1:29:59] we clear so far
[1:30:01] for a team I'm gonna get this one
[1:30:05] the Bible says in Revelation 12 verse 11
[1:30:09] and they
[1:30:11] overcame him the devil
[1:30:14] by water the blood of the Lamb
[1:30:18] you know in this message
[1:30:21] when we say the blood of the Lamb
[1:30:23] we usually looking for some liquid
[1:30:33] that I read
[1:30:36] when you meet Jesus in the air we live
[1:30:39] bleed
[1:30:42] Jesus already have a transformation he
[1:30:45] had the glorified body
[1:30:47] can you go into glorify body and pull
[1:30:49] blood
[1:30:52] but but the Bible says here that they
[1:30:54] will overcome him by the blood of the
[1:30:57] Lamb when we say blood in this message
[1:30:59] we have Pentecostal thinking
[1:31:03] we think about the liquid that is red
[1:31:06] with plasma and you leave it there and
[1:31:09] it begins to dry that's not the blood
[1:31:11] that one was done in Calvary
[1:31:16] and if you go to California you can
[1:31:18] search all around you won't even find a
[1:31:20] drop of it
[1:31:21] and if we would go to the body of Jesus
[1:31:23] Christ and withdraw all the blood he
[1:31:26] won't surface all of us
[1:31:29] because it is a multiple of people that
[1:31:31] were saved what is the blood
[1:31:37] because we will overcome by the blood
[1:31:42] brother Branham says in the message they
[1:31:44] took it
[1:31:46] he said God only recognizes what the
[1:31:50] token
[1:31:53] what is the token
[1:31:55] which is the blood that was pulled the
[1:31:58] token was the blood that they put over
[1:32:00] there God called that the token or the
[1:32:03] Sun but what is the token
[1:32:08] brother Branham say that is the message
[1:32:12] of the hour amen
[1:32:20] so the message of the hour is the blood
[1:32:23] of dilemma amen
[1:32:26] [Applause]
[1:32:29] no message no blood
[1:32:34] [Music]
[1:32:36] can I continue
[1:32:37] can I continue when you remove the
[1:32:40] message from a church you are removing
[1:32:43] the blood from the church
[1:32:48] amen when you don't want to preach the
[1:32:52] message in the church when you don't
[1:32:54] want to quote the message in the church
[1:32:56] you are actually removing the blood
[1:32:59] [Applause]
[1:33:01] from the people
[1:33:07] can you say Amen
[1:33:08] can you say a man brother Branham say
[1:33:11] that is the message of the hour that is

[1:33:36] the blood of the Lamb which blood
[1:33:40] you will overcome by the message of
[1:33:43] Yahweh
[1:33:49] it stumbles you a little bit swallow
[1:33:52] this one my friend
[1:33:53] brother Branham say in the message the
[1:33:55] Rapture one day there will come a blast

[1:34:56] chest
[1:34:59] now if the blood is the liquid
[1:35:04] how are we going to get that liquid
[1:35:07] because the one who have the blood is in
[1:35:09] love he's waiting for us in the air but
[1:35:13] when you go toward him you must have a
[1:35:16] blood
[1:35:17] right there on your chest
[1:35:24] what is the blood he said proudly
[1:35:27] displaying the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:35:29] upon the water yes the message of God in
[1:35:33] the hour that the water lived there
[1:35:41] so the blood is your message amen
[1:35:45] [Music]
[1:35:48] let's go back again in Revelation 12 now
[1:35:51] let's read it again and day of the camp
[1:35:55] by water the blood of the Lamb
[1:35:58] now it changes
[1:36:00] how do you overcome the devil how can I
[1:36:03] overcome the devil now
[1:36:08] the message of the day
[1:36:09] you remove the message in the church no
[1:36:12] blood
[1:36:13] you don't want to read the message no
[1:36:15] blood
[1:36:16] you're rejecting the message that came
[1:36:18] done with the mighty Angel we don't need
[1:36:20] those seals you are removing the blood
[1:36:23] from the people
[1:36:24] and thinking you're preaching the
[1:36:26] message
[1:36:32] they will overcome him by the water
[1:36:34] blood of the Lamb comma and bite the
[1:36:37] water word of their testimony so
[1:36:40] somebody must speak
[1:36:44] you don't you don't overcome just by the
[1:36:47] message
[1:36:48] because they told John when you take the
[1:36:51] book you do what now you have the
[1:36:54] message you have the blood but they say
[1:36:57] to John that you must also do what
[1:37:01] you must prophesy again
[1:37:05] because somebody already prophesied
[1:37:09] Revelation 10 7 but we as the bread we
[1:37:13] must prophesy again
[1:37:17] we must repeat what the messenger
[1:37:20] already say
[1:37:23] you overcome by the blood of the lamb
[1:37:27] and by the word of your testimony
[1:37:33] and they love not their lives and to
[1:37:36] what the death any question so far let's
[1:37:39] pray Heavenly Father Lord we are
[1:37:42] approaching you humbly this morning
[1:37:43] Father thanking you for your grace your
[1:37:46] love and your mercy and for everything
[1:37:48] you have been doing for us father we are
[1:37:51] committing once again this service unto
[1:37:53] their hand Lord may you move me
[1:37:55] completely out of the way may you come
[1:37:57] and speak to our soul this morning Lord
[1:37:59] as we're waiting and expecting from thee
[1:38:02] in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:38:05] my subject this morning
[1:38:09] I'm good in town is the four phases of
[1:38:13] roof
[1:38:14] faith
[1:38:15] in Word
[1:38:17] and in action
[1:38:22] faith
[1:38:23] faith in Word
[1:38:27] and
[1:38:29] then your faith is complete
[1:38:32] we clear we clear now we understand
[1:38:36] clearly Where We Are
[1:38:39] you got the Holy Ghost you're in the
[1:38:41] holiest you're waiting for the Rapture
[1:38:42] and then you go but before you go to the
[1:38:45] rapture
[1:38:46] you're not gonna go like a coward
[1:38:51] you're not gonna leave this earth like
[1:38:53] somebody that was desperate and God is
[1:38:56] coming to rescue you
[1:39:00] you are living from this Earth Prada
[1:39:04] amen and you turn around you say devil
[1:39:07] you got it
[1:39:09] I will come back
[1:39:12] amen
[1:39:13] amen you tell the devil you say I'm
[1:39:16] coming back when Armageddon come you see
[1:39:19] me
[1:39:21] and when you see me on a white horse
[1:39:27] you see me I'm coming and when we finish
[1:39:31] Armageddon I go to the honeymoon and
[1:39:34] after the honeymoon God get murder is
[1:39:36] there and I will judge you
[1:39:44] in other words we are not living here
[1:39:47] powerless
[1:39:48] that's why the book was sent down
[1:39:51] to make a church that's gonna be
[1:39:54] victorious
[1:39:55] a church that look like God
[1:39:58] a church that have restored Adam back on
[1:40:01] Earth
[1:40:02] in other words we tell the devil you
[1:40:05] know what you did to Adam now you got it
[1:40:10] you are paying for what you did to Adam
[1:40:17] in other words you want to see Adam
[1:40:19] again on display before we leave here
[1:40:22] I'm not gonna live without the
[1:40:24] restoration
[1:40:26] because the book was already paid for
[1:40:28] and the book is no longer in heaven the
[1:40:31] book is now on the Earth but it's not
[1:40:33] with William Mayan brother Branham
[1:40:36] already gave me the book
[1:40:37] [Applause]
[1:40:42] and the book is the title
[1:40:45] in other words they give me some right
[1:40:48] some power and authority
[1:40:55] what are we dealing with my friend
[1:40:57] brother Branham says this that what we
[1:41:01] need today
[1:41:03] is what my friends some real genuine
[1:41:06] Faith put into actions
[1:41:09] we need real genuine Faith that's number
[1:41:13] one
[1:41:16] so when you have real genuine Faith
[1:41:18] you're already good but it's not good
[1:41:21] enough
[1:41:22] that Faith must be put in action
[1:41:28] brother Branham said we need some real
[1:41:31] genuine Faith how put into action yes
[1:41:35] sir we need real faith
[1:41:38] and man who dared to put God's word to
[1:41:42] the what heart and water apply it to who
[1:41:46] themselves
[1:41:52] not only Heroes
[1:41:55] doers you take the word you put it in
[1:41:58] your heart but it doesn't stay there
[1:42:01] you take that word you apply it to
[1:42:03] yourself
[1:42:05] you know how you apply lotion you apply
[1:42:08] the word to yourself
[1:42:11] every morning you put lotion you apply
[1:42:14] the word to yourself you say you buddy
[1:42:17] you must shine
[1:42:18] you must reflect the message
[1:42:21] you must be in good health
[1:42:24] you must look good
[1:42:26] you must be bright like Moses
[1:42:35] don't worry my friend the good thing is
[1:42:37] you swallowing so it's gonna come back
[1:42:40] brother brought them say our religion
[1:42:43] must become water in action
[1:42:47] Christian religion is what in action
[1:42:51] a Christian religion is a nation
[1:42:55] it is Jesus Christ himself in water
[1:42:59] action
[1:43:01] that what can
[1:43:05] so my life is no longer my life that's
[1:43:08] why Paul said the life I live now I
[1:43:11] leave it by the faith of the son of God
[1:43:17] we clear so far
[1:43:18] let's continue to clumber brother
[1:43:20] Branham says this they're Heroes of the
[1:43:23] Old Testament Headwater faith
[1:43:29] put it in that they didn't stop at
[1:43:32] having faith When Faith come they went
[1:43:35] to action they put it in action you got
[1:43:39] them for an example now we got faith but
[1:43:42] you won't put it in action right away on
[1:43:46] the powers of the Holy Ghost
[1:43:50] there is a prophecy in the Old Testament
[1:43:52] the prophecy of Zechariah 9 verse 9. the
[1:43:57] Bible says this that Rejoice greatly o
[1:44:02] Daughter of Zion
[1:44:04] shout oh daughter of Jerusalem behold
[1:44:07] that King
[1:44:09] cometh upon thee he is just and having
[1:44:12] salvation lonely in other words humble
[1:44:15] and riding upon in US
[1:44:18] and upon a court they fall off in Us in
[1:44:22] other words they ask that he will be
[1:44:23] driving will be a young one
[1:44:27] and if he's a call he's a four because
[1:44:30] they have not broken that ice that that
[1:44:32] us yet in other words nobody have read
[1:44:34] in their eyes yet
[1:44:36] everybody okay so according to this
[1:44:38] picture we are looking at the king
[1:44:41] a king that is coming that is riding on
[1:44:45] us amen that King is humble because he
[1:44:49] came in humility but when he's coming in
[1:44:52] glory that's a different story he came
[1:44:54] he's coming humble and we will see the
[1:44:57] daughters of Jerusalem rejoicing
[1:44:59] amen that's the picture
[1:45:02] so this one is something it's a
[1:45:05] foundation that was placed there by the
[1:45:08] prophet now how to make this
[1:45:12] this word that's the problem
[1:45:14] now when he come come to this prophecy
[1:45:16] this is what happened
[1:45:19] the Bible says in Mark chapter 11 verse
[1:45:23] 1 that when they came nigh to Jerusalem
[1:45:27] and to Bedford and Bethany at the Mount
[1:45:30] of olive he sent the forth two of his
[1:45:34] disciples
[1:45:36] we don't know who they are when he sent
[1:45:38] them for the Passover it was Peter and
[1:45:40] John
[1:45:40] this one I don't know unless I see
[1:45:43] brother Brown I'm saying that
[1:45:44] and the Bible says and say unto them go
[1:45:49] your way
[1:45:51] Jesus was not sending this disciple just
[1:45:55] like that
[1:45:56] Jesus already have a foundation
[1:46:00] in the scripture that spoke about him
[1:46:05] in other words he was not venturing
[1:46:08] without a promise
[1:46:11] he already have something in the Bible
[1:46:13] that back him up
[1:46:15] [Music]
[1:46:16] so when he's going he has a scripture
[1:46:20] he has a promise
[1:46:23] he has something that was already
[1:46:26] pressed there for him
[1:46:28] and upon the authority of that vision
[1:46:32] upon the authority of this prophecy
[1:46:35] Jesus begin to move
[1:46:37] when he moved he takes to disciples
[1:46:41] in other words those two disciple were
[1:46:45] Unwritten in this prophecy
[1:46:53] in other words this prophecy has a
[1:46:56] written part and an Unwritten party
[1:47:00] the written part is the king is coming
[1:47:03] on the horse but how did the King get
[1:47:06] the horse
[1:47:07] it's not taking it it's not saying
[1:47:09] anything down
[1:47:11] hidden in the Thunder
[1:47:14] [Applause]
[1:47:15] everybody okay which disciple is he
[1:47:18] gonna use we don't know they therefore
[1:47:20] don't know it is hidden under the seals
[1:47:24] everybody okay so Jesus is coming he
[1:47:27] tell the disciple he said go your way
[1:47:30] into the village
[1:47:32] offer against you and as soon as you
[1:47:34] enter into it you shall find a quote
[1:47:39] time
[1:47:41] precision
[1:47:42] where on never man said because he's a
[1:47:47] foe amen he has not been broken yet to
[1:47:51] break a horse it doesn't mean to take
[1:47:52] him and cut him no it's just to master
[1:47:55] him amen he says
[1:47:58] we're on never men sat and you do it
[1:48:01] lose him and what bring him
[1:48:05] not everybody can do this
[1:48:10] Jesus had many disciples he chose two
[1:48:16] when you are chosen
[1:48:18] father your choosing
[1:48:22] [Applause]
[1:48:23] [Music]
[1:48:26] all of them are disciple but they were
[1:48:29] not part of that vision
[1:48:34] so you have a project for your own life
[1:48:38] follow your leadership
[1:48:42] when God say move you move
[1:48:45] don't look at your brother over there
[1:48:49] it doesn't mean your brother is massive
[1:48:52] but what I'm accomplishing now he's not
[1:48:55] part of it
[1:48:56] [Music]
[1:48:57] God knew who will believe it
[1:49:00] and who are believer
[1:49:03] this disciple never questioned Jesus
[1:49:05] Christ
[1:49:06] they say go they went Jesus said when
[1:49:08] you go you found the court these are the
[1:49:11] description what do you do lose him
[1:49:17] if you intellectual you're going to
[1:49:19] start asking questions ready
[1:49:22] amen but Jesus gives them another
[1:49:24] package
[1:49:26] we clear verse three and if any man say
[1:49:31] unto you
[1:49:33] uh-huh
[1:49:36] at the beginning you don't talk to
[1:49:38] nobody
[1:49:40] follow me carefully
[1:49:41] you just go and do
[1:49:46] [Applause]
[1:49:56] it is not finished yet
[1:50:00] Jesus said if anybody
[1:50:04] If any man say unto you what do you do
[1:50:08] this
[1:50:10] in other words when you are entering the
[1:50:14] vision you will find a position
[1:50:22] when you're going to Egypt to pull
[1:50:25] Israel you will find your position
[1:50:30] everybody okay everybody good when you
[1:50:33] enter in division to do what God wants
[1:50:35] you to do opposition will rise up in the
[1:50:39] will of God
[1:50:42] in the path of Duty opposition will rise
[1:50:45] up expect the devil
[1:50:49] thank you
[1:50:50] are we okay are we good he says when
[1:50:55] they say to you why do you do this
[1:50:58] say ye that the Lord
[1:51:03] not Jesus
[1:51:06] the Lord do you know what Lord means
[1:51:09] ownership
[1:51:12] where did Jesus buy that donkey
[1:51:15] tell him that the honor the Supreme
[1:51:18] owner
[1:51:26] tell him that the Supreme the top on
[1:51:29] them
[1:51:30] the master of the Sabbath need it
[1:51:32] because everything that was created is
[1:51:35] mine
[1:51:37] so when they question you I am the one
[1:51:41] who sent you tell them that purple the
[1:51:44] top
[1:51:46] the Lord has need of him and straight
[1:51:50] away he will send him how hither so when
[1:51:53] opposition rise up you can't keep your
[1:51:57] mouth shut
[1:52:05] everybody okay when you are fulfilling
[1:52:08] God's word in your life an opposition
[1:52:11] begin to rise up don't keep your mouth
[1:52:14] shut
[1:52:18] make that therefore no
[1:52:19] [Applause]
[1:52:23] that listen to me very carefully I'm not
[1:52:26] venturing myself
[1:52:28] I'm not doing this just like that
[1:52:31] I believe a message
[1:52:34] and because of the message that's why
[1:52:36] I'm doing what I'm doing so you better
[1:52:39] shut up
[1:52:40] [Applause]
[1:52:47] are we together
[1:52:49] are we together
[1:52:51] let's see who spoke
[1:52:54] the Bible says and they went their way
[1:52:57] and found the code Tie by the door
[1:52:59] that's already an action of faith
[1:53:02] without a place where two ways meet
[1:53:05] let's leave that alone
[1:53:07] at the intersection and they did water
[1:53:10] lose him
[1:53:12] and a certain of them that stood there
[1:53:15] so what they were doing that people were
[1:53:17] standing
[1:53:18] watching them you need faith my friend
[1:53:21] in other words God wants you to rise
[1:53:24] higher
[1:53:25] [Applause]
[1:53:28] because the devil is shooting at that
[1:53:31] time they will take you as Thief
[1:53:33] you know uh they will call the police on
[1:53:34] you ah they will do this ah and they
[1:53:37] will take you to jail everything but
[1:53:39] they must bypass all of that get there
[1:53:46] and notice when they are losing the
[1:53:49] court nobody speak
[1:53:51] when they begin to go their way
[1:53:55] that's when the opposition was up
[1:53:58] Are We There Are We There the Bible say
[1:54:00] certain of them that stood there say
[1:54:04] unto them why do you lose why do you
[1:54:07] losing the code who is there those
[1:54:09] people listen to The Book of Luke say as
[1:54:14] this as they were losing the court they
[1:54:16] were the owners
[1:54:30] so the one who was in opposition is not
[1:54:34] just anybody
[1:54:37] it is the honor
[1:54:40] of the animal
[1:54:41] he owns the animal
[1:54:43] that's why Jesus tell him to say tell
[1:54:46] him the master owner
[1:54:54] if he is a president tell him the
[1:54:58] president of the president
[1:55:00] taught you to do that
[1:55:02] amen
[1:55:03] and the Bible says glory to God that and
[1:55:06] they say unto them even as what Jesus
[1:55:10] Headwater commanded they repeated
[1:55:13] exactly what Jesus gave it to them and
[1:55:16] they did what let them go so when you
[1:55:19] are entering a vision
[1:55:22] everybody care and you are implementing
[1:55:25] something when opposition come up you
[1:55:29] cannot keep silence
[1:55:35] let's continue to move slowly glory to
[1:55:38] God Amen let's go to Isaiah 55.
[1:55:44] thank you Jesus
[1:55:47] Isaiah 55
[1:55:50] if I pass this then I'm soaring quickly
[1:55:52] we are very good on time
[1:55:56] Isaiah 55 if you dare you can say amen
[1:56:00] amen verse 8.
[1:56:04] pages are still turning
[1:56:07] if you're there you let me know
[1:56:10] Isaiah 55 verse 8.
[1:56:15] for my thoughts
[1:56:19] are not your thoughts
[1:56:22] I'm glad for that
[1:56:24] in other words what I'm thinking is not
[1:56:26] what God is thinking
[1:56:29] what my little brain is thinking
[1:56:32] when my little brand is blocked it's not
[1:56:35] what God is thinking when I say I'm done
[1:56:38] it's not what God is thinking
[1:56:41] I'm glad for that
[1:56:44] amen
[1:56:45] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[1:56:49] neither are your way your plan that you
[1:56:52] make my way says who the Lord in other
[1:56:56] words we have our plan and his plan our
[1:56:59] thought and his plan
[1:57:01] and he stopped and they are done the
[1:57:03] same
[1:57:05] we clear verse 9 for us the heaven
[1:57:10] I hired to the Earth
[1:57:14] so are my ways higher than your ways and
[1:57:19] my thoughts than your water in other
[1:57:21] words what God has for you will pass
[1:57:25] your mind
[1:57:30] that's why they say hell Mary you are
[1:57:32] well faithful it is beyond
[1:57:35] that's why they say Gideon Mighty Men of
[1:57:38] value it is beyond
[1:57:40] it might be made of out of me
[1:57:44] his daughter higher
[1:57:46] so get used to something you don't even
[1:57:49] have in your mind when God is bringing
[1:57:52] to you
[1:57:54] don't be afraid
[1:57:56] when God tells you something that you
[1:57:59] see like
[1:58:00] I don't deserve this one it's an
[1:58:03] indication that it belongs to you
[1:58:05] [Applause]
[1:58:06] [Music]
[1:58:08] because his way are not your ways his
[1:58:12] daughter not your thoughts when you
[1:58:14] disqualify yourself that's when he
[1:58:17] qualifies you
[1:58:22] it's called paradox
[1:58:26] we clear verse 10 the Bible says for us
[1:58:31] the heavens our first thing for us the
[1:58:34] rain
[1:58:35] comes well down
[1:58:38] and the snow from water heaven
[1:58:41] and returneth not there but do what
[1:58:44] watereth the Earth we got two things
[1:58:47] here
[1:58:48] we got water
[1:58:51] which is really watery and we got snow
[1:58:55] that is a little bit more firmer
[1:58:58] those two amen comes and watered the
[1:59:02] Earth
[1:59:05] why
[1:59:07] amen
[1:59:09] as the for us the rain comes down and
[1:59:13] the snow from heaven
[1:59:15] and return not there
[1:59:18] so the rain when it comes down it will
[1:59:20] go back
[1:59:22] amen
[1:59:23] it is wired to come down and to go back
[1:59:28] amen but he will not go back
[1:59:32] until let's read it but Waters the Earth
[1:59:36] and makes it bring water forth and bird
[1:59:39] fourth and bad that he may give seed to
[1:59:43] the water sower and bread to the water
[1:59:45] eater
[1:59:46] Isaiah is saying when the water comes
[1:59:49] down and it rains
[1:59:52] and water the grass and everything that
[1:59:56] rain is supposed to go back where we
[1:59:59] came from
[2:00:00] but he won't go back
[2:00:03] everybody okay until he have finished
[2:00:06] its mission
[2:00:10] are we together
[2:00:12] and the mission of this rain Isaiah say
[2:00:15] is to bring forth
[2:00:21] and to bother
[2:00:23] and what else my friend that it may give
[2:00:26] seed to the sower to give seed let's go
[2:00:29] straight when the earth is bringing
[2:00:32] forth it means something was in the
[2:00:35] Earth
[2:00:38] are we together so the red was not
[2:00:41] really coming from the Earth
[2:00:47] are we together
[2:00:49] are we together are we together so the
[2:00:53] Earth has a mystery
[2:00:57] that's why I say mystery you gotta love
[2:00:59] mysteries this is the Earth
[2:01:02] maybe you have some trees here
[2:01:08] amen and then there is some rain
[2:01:11] dropping here like today amen the Bible
[2:01:14] says when the rain comes it doesn't go
[2:01:17] back
[2:01:18] because there will be an evaporation
[2:01:20] that would suck everything up back again
[2:01:22] into the into the heaven but the Bible
[2:01:25] says he won't go back until it have
[2:01:27] fulfilled its mission
[2:01:30] and when they come down and he watered
[2:01:33] the grass its Mission we will see
[2:01:36] certain things
[2:01:37] begin to stick out
[2:01:42] are we together when this thing begin to
[2:01:45] stick out the rain has finished its
[2:01:48] Mission and the rain now can go back
[2:01:51] so the ram is coming back not for the
[2:01:55] Earth
[2:01:57] but the uran is coming back for what is
[2:02:02] inside the Earth
[2:02:07] in other words the rain is coming for
[2:02:10] revelation
[2:02:12] we don't know what is in the Earth
[2:02:15] if there is no rain
[2:02:18] because what is in the earth is hidden
[2:02:21] if there is a seed there
[2:02:25] do you follow me this seed we don't know
[2:02:28] what it is
[2:02:29] we don't know whether it's a corner or
[2:02:32] whether it's a wheat we don't know we
[2:02:34] need the rain
[2:02:37] everybody okay so when the rain come the
[2:02:41] rain will get and water the Earth in
[2:02:43] other words the wind that's a stop here
[2:02:47] brother Robert impervious the word will
[2:02:49] be the the rain will begin to go down
[2:02:52] and just something in the Earth
[2:02:59] whatever was in the Earth was alive but
[2:03:03] sleeping
[2:03:05] are we together are we together and the
[2:03:09] red will Quicken that up
[2:03:16] [Applause]
[2:03:18] help me understand this so we can move
[2:03:21] on
[2:03:22] the Bible says in Deuteronomy 32 verse
[2:03:25] 2. my Doctrine
[2:03:28] we don't love Doctrine in this message
[2:03:30] my Doctrine
[2:03:32] shall drop us water the rain
[2:03:35] [Music]
[2:03:37] oh no we don't like the doctrine in this
[2:03:39] message we don't like those mysteries in
[2:03:42] this message
[2:03:44] my Doctrine or my teaching
[2:03:47] shall drop us water the rain my speech
[2:03:51] shall distill us the water do as the
[2:03:55] small rain upon the tender water and as
[2:03:58] they shower upon the Water Christ so God
[2:04:01] when he said that's why move will come
[2:04:04] the teaching Reign before the Harvest
[2:04:08] rain
[2:04:08] [Applause]
[2:04:13] have to come first to water the grass so
[2:04:18] when the teaching is coming the teaching

[2:04:45] on you is not really coming for this
[2:04:47] it's coming for what is inside of you

[2:12:51] testimony is also the word of God
[2:12:55] in other words your life is running the
[2:12:58] Bible
[2:12:59] [Applause]
[2:13:06] the Bible that we read is what God did
[2:13:10] with Abraham he helped Abraham in that
[2:13:13] time but he was the word for future use
[2:13:18] today we begin to say the god of Abraham
[2:13:24] what you going through is not only to
[2:13:28] deliver you for the present time but
[2:13:31] somebody else can use your testimony
[2:13:34] for the future
[2:13:37] in other words when I go to trial I save
[2:13:40] God if you deliver me from a kidney
[2:13:43] trouble
[2:13:44] [Applause]
[2:13:45] you can also do it again
[2:13:49] is the word for the time
[2:13:53] [Applause]
[2:13:56] everybody clear the woman that was in
[2:13:59] Tennessee that the child was dying she
[2:14:02] opened the Bible she looked at the
[2:14:04] sunamite that was an experience for that
[2:14:06] day that he was a seed for future time
[2:14:09] she said God where is Elijah
[2:14:17] so your life is written a pizza what God
[2:14:21] does in your life will be helping
[2:14:24] somebody else
[2:14:31] that's why never give up don't go back
[2:14:35] whatever happened in your life you are

[2:14:52] you think you're going to trial your
[2:14:55] trial you're riding another Bible
[2:14:57] [Applause]
[2:14:58] that's why Christ in the church is a
[2:15:02] continuation of the book of actors in
[2:15:06] other words you cannot put a period on
[2:15:08] the revelation
[2:15:12] when you talk to people and they are
[2:15:14] down you say you're done I was in the
[2:15:17] same situation like you

[2:15:20] situation about you I could not have a
[2:15:22] child but you know what we pray and God
[2:15:25] give me a chance you already have a
[2:15:27] child it was bred for you but now it
[2:15:29] becomes seed to the soul now you are
[2:15:32] sowing you are giving it to somebody so
[2:15:35] somebody can use it
[2:15:37] that's why everything that goes in your
[2:15:41] life all things work together for what
[2:15:44] the good
[2:15:46] Hallelujah
[2:15:50] don't hide your testimony

[2:17:07] over there he was where is the god of

[2:17:13] Mayon Branham the nature of this day
[2:17:21] your trial is the Bible whatever you go
[2:17:25] through is a Bible because your word has
[2:17:28] been quickened and God is making another
[2:17:31] history
[2:17:33] in your life
[2:17:39] [Applause]
[2:17:40] don't let your trial put a complex on
[2:17:43] you no use your child you say I'm using
[2:17:47] that as an example this is a testimony
[2:17:51] there will overcome by the blood of the
[2:17:54] lamb and by the word of my testimony
[2:18:04] Oh Glory to God
[2:18:07] glory to God never get complexing God
[2:18:11] knows what he's doing
[2:18:15] Abraham didn't know that there were
[2:18:17] children down the road that's going to
[2:18:19] use his example
[2:18:21] job didn't know what he was going he's
[2:18:23] going to help somebody he helped him in
[2:18:25] that time but he was seed for the future
[2:18:28] how many people claim on job how many
[2:18:31] people claim on Mary Magdalene a woman
[2:18:33] that is a prostitute can use rehab and
[2:18:37] say father you use rehab you can sell my
[2:18:40] family through me
[2:18:43] you thought he was a prostitute God was
[2:18:46] riding his Bible
[2:18:48] [Applause]
[2:18:50] because God knew somebody will be a
[2:18:53] positive but that in the shop they will
[2:18:56] have a predestinated seed let me lay the
[2:18:59] foundation for future use
[2:19:02] somebody who killed someone can use
[2:19:04] Moses Moses kill an Egyptian god use him
[2:19:08] [Music]
[2:19:11] [Applause]
[2:19:16] brother Branham say those that have
[2:19:19] blemished outnumber those that their
[2:19:23] life seems to be perfect
[2:19:25] the people God used
[2:19:28] Amanda so we can look we say he did it
[2:19:31] for this one and in the same condition
[2:19:33] that's it
[2:19:35] everything worked together for good
[2:19:38] because it's going to work for the
[2:19:40] present time it will also work for the
[2:19:42] future you can use it and move on father
[2:19:45] I pray you gave me this I pray you gave
[2:19:48] me this honey don't worry do you
[2:19:50] remember how God pass us
[2:19:52] the same God will do it again
[2:19:56] let's go to sleep it's used for the
[2:20:00] future it become a testimony he
[2:20:03] encourages you
[2:20:08] glory to God
[2:20:09] [Applause]
[2:20:15] let me skip this one my friend let me go
[2:20:18] straight now to the point so we can get
[2:20:20] where we're supposed to get
[2:20:22] devil not at this time
[2:20:25] oh God gracious not at this time Amen
[2:20:29] brother Branham says so what is faith
[2:20:35] faith is something that is revealed to
[2:20:38] you
[2:20:40] father help me Faith is something that
[2:20:43] is revealed to you that is not yet
[2:20:46] but you believe it will be
[2:20:49] faith is a revelation of the will of
[2:20:53] water God it's what God wants to do
[2:20:58] that's why Faith have no doubt
[2:21:00] because you know that that's what God
[2:21:02] wants to do help me up my friend we
[2:21:05] still have time I'm just sowing in
[2:21:07] eternity
[2:21:08] the Bible says in Hebrew 11 verse 3
[2:21:11] through water faith we understand that
[2:21:14] the worlds
[2:21:16] where water refrain by water the word of
[2:21:19] God so that the fix which are sin
[2:21:23] were not made by things which water do
[2:21:26] appear in other words they came from the
[2:21:28] invisible
[2:21:33] hold tight my friend
[2:21:36] when we say the world was framed by the
[2:21:39] word of God how that what does it mean
[2:21:42] because when we say the word we're
[2:21:44] thinking about the Bible
[2:21:46] that word is a living person
[2:21:50] it's called the logos
[2:21:52] in Psalm 33 verse 6 the Bible said by
[2:21:56] the Water World by the word of the Lord
[2:21:59] where they have and how may and all the
[2:22:02] hosts of them by the water breath of his
[2:22:04] mouth
[2:22:05] now we begin to get it clear in other
[2:22:08] words somebody spoke
[2:22:10] somebody heard something in his mind and
[2:22:14] he didn't keep it to me to himself but
[2:22:17] he expressed it
[2:22:19] verse 9 for God did what to spake and he
[2:22:23] was water done he did what command it
[2:22:25] and it was water stood fast so whatever
[2:22:28] happened here came by this way
[2:22:33] are we clear are we clear let's get to
[2:22:36] our territory brother Branham Say by
[2:22:39] that same says God spoke when there was
[2:22:43] nothing

[2:28:09] little bit see where we can get brother
[2:28:11] Branham say when you say you got faith
[2:28:14] forward Divine Healing and something
[2:28:17] struck you
[2:28:19] and say what move out
[2:28:22] that is the confirmation that God has
[2:28:26] received your faith for what Divine
[2:28:29] Healing that's right when you got
[2:28:31] courage
[2:28:33] to put your faith in water action but
[2:28:36] when you say you got faith and afraid to
[2:28:39] let it go your faith is half dead
[2:28:43] [Music]
[2:28:45] but when you get Faith and willing to
[2:28:49] water let it go then God is confirming
[2:28:53] it with water the signs following and
[2:28:55] you shall see your water healing in
[2:28:58] other words when you act upon your faith
[2:29:01] God said hey this boy locked me up
[2:29:05] yes sir I must I must react because once
[2:29:09] he moved like this
[2:29:10] I don't want to play with my reputation
[2:29:12] this boy everybody knows him in the in
[2:29:16] the neighborhood everybody knows him at
[2:29:18] work so I better heal him quickly before
[2:29:23] this message get in trouble
[2:29:25] in either way you are forcing God
[2:29:27] when you begin to act one stuff you are
[2:29:30] pulling God like wake up
[2:29:38] let me move on
[2:29:40] let me move on listen to all this the
[2:29:43] Bible said death
[2:29:46] and what life our way in the power of
[2:29:49] the tongue
[2:29:53] and they they love it shall do what eat
[2:29:57] the fruit thereof so I need to eat rice
[2:30:02] so my word must be life all the time
[2:30:09] can I continue watching Isaiah 54 no
[2:30:13] water weapon
[2:30:15] thank you
[2:30:19] continue my friend not weapon that is
[2:30:23] what formed against thee Shadow prosper
[2:30:26] and every tongue that's how water rise
[2:30:30] against thee in water judgment you shall
[2:30:33] do what condemn in other words you
[2:30:35] cannot keep your mouth quiet
[2:30:39] this is why when somebody is around me
[2:30:43] and speaking negative things
[2:30:47] I cannot keep quiet
[2:30:53] [Music]
[2:30:54] one day Jesus was Gone with the disciple
[2:30:58] and Jesus begin to speak his agenda that
[2:31:01] you know what I'm going to Jerusalem and
[2:31:03] what's going to happen they will kill me
[2:31:05] and they will do this The Prince and
[2:31:06] this this and Peter
[2:31:09] not a sinner
[2:31:11] a disciple
[2:31:13] a Son of God a predestinated seed
[2:31:19] God is Spirit on him
[2:31:21] they therefore God on him so don't
[2:31:23] expect your trial sometime to come
[2:31:25] outside
[2:31:27] do you follow me
[2:31:29] the brother is not bad
[2:31:31] he's just a brother may be in weakness
[2:31:34] and the devil took over him everybody
[2:31:36] okay because the devil knows how Jesus
[2:31:38] and pee they love one another
[2:31:40] can I continue and then as the moving
[2:31:44] Peter begin to repeat that you know what
[2:31:46] it's not going to happen to you
[2:31:50] Jesus didn't say ah
[2:31:52] I don't want to offend him
[2:31:55] [Music]
[2:31:57] Jesus turn around
[2:32:00] and say Satan not Peter I'm not talking
[2:32:04] about you Peter Satan
[2:32:07] the one who's talking right now get deep
[2:32:10] behind me
[2:32:11] in other words
[2:32:14] and I'm doing my thing
[2:32:16] about my life and my faith with God
[2:32:19] don't be negative around me because I
[2:32:23] have to condemn that term
[2:32:26] I cannot say quiet when I'm saying God
[2:32:28] will do this you say no I don't think
[2:32:31] it's going to happen I'll say please
[2:32:32] hush
[2:32:34] it will happen
[2:32:37] because what you're saying is contrary
[2:32:40] to what God is telling me
[2:32:42] and anything that goes contrary to the
[2:32:45] world I will act like it doesn't even
[2:32:49] exist
[2:32:50] that's what Abraham did everything that
[2:32:53] was contrary to the promise of Abraham
[2:32:55] Abraham never even considered that
[2:32:58] right and the Bible say every pound that
[2:33:01] rise against you you condemn it
[2:33:07] if you want to take the court and
[2:33:09] somebody want to say something about it
[2:33:11] tell him they must need it
[2:33:15] it's over don't stay quiet
[2:33:17] because it's a seed that the devil is
[2:33:19] shooting
[2:33:20] the Bible said that is the heritage
[2:33:25] it's a Heritage of the servant of the
[2:33:27] Lord and the righteousness is of me say
[2:33:30] who the Lord so our heritage is to
[2:33:33] condemn everything that is contrary to
[2:33:35] the world
[2:33:37] [Applause]
[2:33:40] oh God let me get to the airport brother
[2:33:43] Branham say we have faith in our heart
[2:33:46] the faith of God where in our heart
[2:33:50] and can see how it clear it become water
[2:33:54] of Faith then we do what to speak it and
[2:33:57] he comes into what existing the same
[2:33:59] thing because the mind of Christ Israel
[2:34:02] in the man that is what makes healing
[2:34:04] and so forth when you get the perfect
[2:34:07] revelation just what you're doing then
[2:34:10] you know how to walk
[2:34:12] that's it because that is the Christian
[2:34:14] water walk
[2:34:16] so when God delivers something you open
[2:34:19] up your mouth and deliver it
[2:34:22] and you don't stop at delivering it you
[2:34:25] begin to act according to it
[2:34:28] [Applause]
[2:34:31] let me leave it alone
[2:34:33] brother Branham say this if you go back
[2:34:36] you want to go back a little further
[2:34:38] just as far as historical you could see
[2:34:42] the word in the beginning was water the
[2:34:45] world but what is the word
[2:34:59] he became a word and the word became
[2:35:02] water material so everything that God
[2:35:05] has spoke in his word receive in the
[2:35:09] right channel will materialize that word
[2:35:12] for whatever the promise behind it is
[2:35:17] God will do it he is what obligated to
[2:35:22] water it if he a bad way in me and my
[2:35:26] word about where in you then you have
[2:35:28] hope God and the word is where in you
[2:35:31] and you believe the word just as you
[2:35:33] believe who God because God it is who
[2:35:36] God because God it is God and it is what
[2:35:39] Inseparable then if you have God's word
[2:35:42] in you you have God's life where in you
[2:35:45] you have God where in you and whatever
[2:35:47] God's word speak forth out of you is I
[2:35:51] have to do what come to pass just like
[2:35:53] he was speaking from who God
[2:35:56] amen
[2:36:00] perfect faith is a master of water all
[2:36:03] circumstances perfect Faith Master water
[2:36:05] all circumstances no matter what it is
[2:36:08] he does what Masters is when you believe
[2:36:10] anything what do anything and you got
[2:36:13] faith in what you are doing no matter
[2:36:16] what the circumstances is they don't
[2:36:18] have one thing to do with it a master
[2:36:21] that circumstance amen if it is in the
[2:36:24] room of sickness and the Lord do
[2:36:26] whatever revealed that these certain
[2:36:29] things is going to happen what do you
[2:36:32] have to do you just speak it and go on
[2:36:38] faith is not good just to be faithful
[2:36:42] When Faith come you speak it and you act
[2:36:46] like it you don't have a baby go buy

[2:37:14] about it you speak it because it's not

[2:44:00] you say father thank you for giving me
[2:44:03] that

[2:44:08] if they ask you did you receive that job
[2:44:10] you say of course
[2:44:12] don't you see how I am now
[2:44:14] [Music]
[2:44:17] amen
[2:44:19] amen let's pray Heavenly Father
[2:44:22] Lord once again we are approaching you
[2:44:24] humbly
[2:44:25] father this morning thanking you for
[2:44:27] your grace
[2:44:29] thanking you for your love
[2:44:31] thanking you for your mercy and thanking
[2:44:33] you for speaking to us Lord
[2:44:35] because this is where you are reaching
[2:44:38] for for the bride
[2:44:40] to restore us back exactly where Adam
[2:44:44] lost
[2:44:45] father you send the message
[2:44:47] and you say the faith of the Gentile
[2:44:50] doesn't lie in the laying of hate that's
[2:44:53] why the Roman said to you and say you
[2:44:55] don't even have to come to my home but
[2:44:57] if you can speak the word
[2:45:00] just the word like Peter say at that
[2:45:03] word
[2:45:05] that's all I need
[2:45:08] Peter never stood to check the water
[2:45:12] to see if there were fishes or not
[2:45:14] once he received the word yes
[2:45:17] he took the net and throw it up
[2:45:21] where did the fish come that's not a
[2:45:23] mystery
[2:45:24] that is your responsibility
[2:45:26] but what happened is when he pulled the
[2:45:29] net he was even unable to pull it
[2:45:32] because he was beyond what he was
[2:45:34] expecting Lord maybe somebody have
[2:45:37] worked too much
[2:45:39] and they have not gotten anything
[2:45:41] maybe they try many thing and it's not
[2:45:44] working
[2:45:45] maybe they hope for this and that and it
[2:45:49] seems like they cannot grasp it
[2:45:51] that you are still the same God that can
[2:45:54] roll up a revelation from heaven and
[2:45:57] drop it into the channel of their soul
[2:46:00] so that Lord father whatever the need is
[2:46:03] they can get what they need and be free
[2:46:06] and as soon as that Revelation struck
