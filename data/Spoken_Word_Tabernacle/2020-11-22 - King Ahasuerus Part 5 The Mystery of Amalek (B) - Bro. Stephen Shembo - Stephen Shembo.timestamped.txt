[0:00] back and it is also written
[0:04] jesus defeated this has defeated satan
[0:07] without using any divine gift
[0:11] divine gift that he had
[0:14] showing that there the what
[0:19] when you are in the valley he is not the
[0:21] god of the hill
[0:23] only he is also the god of death
[0:26] even when you are weak when i am weak
[0:29] than i am
[0:32] [Applause]
[0:34] that the weakest christian can defeat
[0:37] satan
[0:38] on the word of what that's the reason
[0:42] that i tried to get before the person
[0:45] nothing in the individual the preacher
[0:48] it is
[0:49] in and christ is in his
[0:52] so when you are low when you don't feel
[0:56] like the anointing is around you
[0:58] like god is listening to your prayer
[1:01] stick to the word
[1:04] stick to the word because that word
[1:08] will defeat the devil when you are in
[1:11] your weakest spot
[1:14] are you there so when you go through the
[1:18] valley
[1:18] amalek is there remember the formula
[1:22] because it's the same yesterday today
[1:25] and forever whatever he used the first
[1:28] time
[1:28] will always be good to be used any time
[1:32] he's not only the god of the hill he is
[1:35] also the god of the
[1:37] valley amen the enemy
[1:41] is going to study our strategy
[1:44] with the world he knows
[1:47] that jesus gave us the secret when he
[1:50] come
[1:50] use the word brother branham say satan
[1:53] will
[1:54] study now you how you are moving with
[1:57] the world
[1:58] are you okay all right now satan studied
[2:03] that
[2:03] all so perfectly till when he come to
[2:06] eve
[2:07] the best strategy he could use upon her
[2:11] and that was the reason that was to do
[2:13] what
[2:14] to reason with the word now you
[2:17] never want to reason with god's word
[2:21] just believe don't try to
[2:25] don't try to you cannot figure it out
[2:30] god so god is there
[2:33] it is just meant to do what
[2:36] [Applause]
[2:38] don't stress yourself in the valley
[2:42] relax believe the world
[2:47] don't reason with the word
[2:50] how is this going to happen you are
[2:53] opening the door for a marmalade
[2:57] to kill you where you are
[2:59] [Music]
[3:02] hallelujah amen
[3:05] amalek what is the origin of amalek
[3:09] take genesis 36 hallelujah
[3:13] i'm watching time just be relaxed
[3:19] i know where we stop so that should
[3:22] remove that pressure for the weak one
[3:25] who are struggling
[3:29] so your god is mindful
[3:32] he already got everything under control
[3:35] with your pastor
[3:40] genesis chapter 36 verse 12.
[3:43] everybody there
[3:48] brother john caught this
[3:52] and timna was conquering
[3:55] to elephants he saw
[4:02] amen and she brought
[4:05] to elephants who
[4:09] these were the sons of other jesus so
[4:14] amalek
[4:15] comes from which lineage
[4:19] i will have a storm will come out of
[4:22] jacob
[4:24] are you there that star won't destroy
[4:28] his soul but after he saw
[4:31] it's going to kill her do you understand
[4:34] now
[4:35] because amalek came from the lineage of
[4:38] who
[4:40] so now mordecai a jew
[4:44] fighting with agar gate heaven
[4:47] which is an amalekite which is
[4:50] of itself in other words the fight
[4:54] between jacob and esau are drawn right
[4:57] there
[5:01] you okay now brother branham said the
[5:03] word have two forces
[5:05] the two sons of who jacob esau
[5:08] and jacob now we found out that
[5:11] amalek comes from esau
[5:18] from the lineage of esau take genesis
[5:22] 25.
[5:24] hallelujah genesis 25 verse 22.
[5:31] you there rebecca is pregnant
[5:35] with this pregnancy trouble trouble
[5:38] trouble trouble trouble trouble
[5:40] say wait a minute i'm tired of this let
[5:42] me go ask the lord
[5:43] and god is answering verse 22 and the
[5:46] children struggle together inside
[5:51] the battle was within rebecca
[5:54] rebecca is a woman which is a top
[5:56] officer
[5:58] and the brother is within the church
[6:02] amen esau and jacob are fighting within
[6:06] the church
[6:07] amen and mordecai fighting
[6:11] within the kingdom amen
[6:16] the old battle is going to the end
[6:20] and the lord and the lord verse 23
[6:24] and the lord said to her to what
[6:28] every nation have a national spirit
[6:31] [Music]
[6:32] so two spirits are fighting
[6:36] the men can die by that spirit move on
[6:38] to the next
[6:40] two nations are in your womb and two
[6:43] money of what
[6:45] it's two different people
[6:48] too many of people shall be what
[6:51] separated from your vows
[6:53] and the one people shall be what
[6:57] you gather now stronger than the other
[7:00] people
[7:01] and the elder shall serve there
[7:04] so this battle of mordecai
[7:08] and heaven the victory is already being
[7:13] prophesied
[7:15] you with me so when you fight with
[7:19] amalek remember it is
[7:22] already been speaking that amalek will
[7:25] be your footstep
[7:28] amen don't fight with him like who's
[7:31] gonna win
[7:33] i was already being told i'm gonna win
[7:38] are you with me i am fighting like a
[7:42] champion
[7:45] because we already know the women from
[7:48] the beginning
[7:49] because now we're finding out that this
[7:52] battle
[7:53] between mordecai and airmen is not
[7:56] the battle between mordecai and amen it
[7:59] is the battle between
[8:00] esau and jacob
[8:05] amen the world today is gripped by the
[8:08] two forces
[8:10] two great religious forces that is soon
[8:13] coming to the head
[8:14] or a showdown it is well represented in
[8:18] our scripture reading tonight of the two
[8:21] sons of
[8:22] isaac esau and and when they represent
[8:26] both these forces and they both come
[8:29] from the same father
[8:31] and same mother the holy one that was
[8:34] for
[8:34] dead of god isaac and was told by god to
[8:38] his father 25 years before he was born
[8:40] he would have a child by a separated and
[8:43] consecrated mother rebecca a virgin
[8:46] and these two son was in the same womb
[8:49] they came to the world
[8:50] fasting and at war with each other
[8:54] and they have been at war with each
[8:57] other

[22:36] back
[22:37] and god said because they are attacking
[22:40] you from the back
[22:41] they are not fearing me why they don't
[22:44] feel me
[22:46] brother obama say not only do we in this
[22:49] day
[22:49] are guilty of the same crime they are
[22:52] discerning the body of the lord
[22:54] that paul was rebuking the corinthian
[22:56] church for but of trying to do something
[22:58] that the lord has commanded
[23:00] without discerning the body of the
[23:03] and the body of the lord is there
[23:06] [Music]
[23:07] you okay now so when amalek was
[23:10] attacking the children of god from the
[23:12] back
[23:13] god saw that they are not discerning the
[23:16] body of the lord
[23:18] i have done so many things in egypt i
[23:21] have destroyed egypt
[23:23] these people should be afraid that don't
[23:26] touch those folks
[23:27] because their god is muddy but because
[23:30] they didn't discern the body of the lord
[23:32] they didn't discern the children of god
[23:35] they didn't
[23:36] discern the church of the living god
[23:38] they didn't discern the children that
[23:40] are filled with the holy spirit
[23:42] they don't care about the anointing they
[23:45] can kill saul
[23:47] without any remorse amen
[23:50] they don't have respect from god god
[23:52] said i know what to do
[23:54] i'm going to wipe them completely but
[23:56] they attack
[23:57] usually from the back you people
[24:01] we fought these sawblade tempers that is
[24:04] always padding off in the mouth at
[24:06] somebody
[24:07] can put up and things like that be
[24:10] careful
[24:11] you are guilty if you speak a word
[24:13] against your brother that is not
[24:15] right because a malachite
[24:18] backbite not just go around and tear
[24:22] down it
[24:23] you don't have to stick a knife in a
[24:25] man's back to kill him
[24:27] you can break his character and kill him
[24:31] kill his influence speak against your
[24:33] pastor here
[24:34] say something bad about him you just
[24:37] might as well as
[24:38] shoot him told something that was not
[24:42] right about him well
[24:43] he shall kill his influence with the
[24:45] people and things like that
[24:47] and you are guilty of it there is
[24:50] something matthew 18
[24:51] go see your brother go see your sister
[24:54] when you attack from the back
[24:57] it's a sign of an amalekite
[25:00] are you there they hated him because
[25:03] they were jealous of him
[25:05] that's the only reason they were jealous
[25:07] they were trying to destroy
[25:09] his influence before the people the same
[25:12] as they are doing
[25:14] now if they can destroy the influence of
[25:18] them a malachite
[25:23] amalekite amalekite
[25:27] if they can destroy the influence of
[25:29] them
[25:30] before their amalekite
[25:34] then they have got they think if they
[25:37] can just destroy
[25:38] the influence of the message just know
[25:41] they disarm you
[25:45] amen amen take second soul

[25:51] to finish
[25:54] and then we're gonna continue again

[28:48] brother the word is at the end of the
[28:52] age
[28:53] only in the crust are you saved i am not
[28:56] saying that to scare you
[28:58] i am just saying it i am saying it
[29:01] just as sadly as i know how to stand
[29:04] here
[29:04] in this platform and say but my heart
[29:07] has been stirred for a time
[29:09] and i know that we are ready for
[29:11] something
[29:13] now coming in and you christian don't
[29:16] stay in that lukewarm condition anymore
[29:20] you did it before the world is changing
[29:24] lay aside everything just get
[29:27] as close to god as you can walk with him
[29:32] talk with him let everything be
[29:37] secondary we bought you all
[29:40] [Music]
[29:42] back to your prayer life in other words
[29:44] accept your prayer life
[29:47] stay right with him all the time
[29:50] now i don't know why you're stopping my
[29:53] speech to say that
[29:55] but i could prove that i'd be willing to
[29:58] say that
[29:59] that is the spirit of god there that is
[30:02] speaking right now
[30:03] a warning to you that's right remember
[30:06] i'm saying that under the anointing of
[30:08] the spirit of god
[30:10] under the anointing of the spirit of god
[30:13] don't let your prayer life be secondary
[30:17] because when we're going to go back to
[30:19] the book of esther you'll find out that
[30:21] mordecai next fasted
[30:24] amen to fight a man
[30:27] are you there brother branham if you
[30:31] watch
[30:31] nature you shall see god and they shall
[30:33] have a wild dog in the country
[30:36] and they eat the deer they would come
[30:38] pack
[30:39] pack dogs and they overtake the deers
[30:42] and one of the things they do
[30:44] is to cut the line what we call
[30:47] hamstring in the back
[30:48] this muscle are you so when the dog
[30:51] attack
[30:52] the deer they usually get him here and
[30:54] break this
[30:55] why do they break this are you there
[30:59] brother one of them say and just cut the
[31:02] whole pack
[31:03] then they can run so the running muscle
[31:08] is in the upstream so when the
[31:11] the wolf attack they usually get here
[31:14] and pull the upstream then they
[31:18] the deer amen when the deer is crippling
[31:22] he cannot run
[31:23] then they overtake him what is the
[31:26] abstract
[31:27] what is steven those dogs
[31:30] will eat as much as they can pulling the
[31:33] aspirin
[31:34] then the other can pull away very much
[31:37] they are
[31:37] crippled and then they are easier
[31:39] praying
[31:40] than to run right back and get them
[31:43] that is the way the devil does he will
[31:47] cut off from your prayer meeting
[31:52] you okay please don't cut
[31:55] the hamstring right there so when you
[31:58] are not
[31:59] praying enough just know
[32:02] your arm strings have been cut
[32:06] the hand of moses are going down now
[32:09] amalek
[32:10] is getting power are we okay
[32:14] please don't cut the hamstring right
[32:16] then you shall
[32:17] pull around from this church to do that
[32:20] you shall run from here today
[32:22] but at any time the devil wants to
[32:25] gobble you up
[32:26] he's got you under his because your
[32:29] prayer life is crippled
[32:31] are you there when he cuts your prayer
[32:34] life brother
[32:35] you are what you see that
[32:39] you need to understand amalek when he
[32:41] cut
[32:42] that test of you and perverted into the
[32:45] things of the world
[32:46] no more prayer life you are seeking the
[32:48] things of the world
[32:49] he's got you where he wants you to he
[32:52] we've got you where he wants you he will
[32:56] let you gobble up along till you get to
[32:59] a certain place like so
[33:02] then what crush your life out
[33:05] without god ready he lets all
[33:09] soul went until he went to the witch
[33:12] when he was weak that's when the
[33:14] amalekite was
[33:16] standing right there and slew saw
[33:19] are you there what is your take-home
[33:22] message
[33:23] sometimes we got off on tension
[33:25] somewhere
[33:26] and not think about god not pray over it
[33:30] ask the lord whether we should do it or
[33:32] not
[33:33] and we found out that our supplier of
[33:36] blessing is cut off
[33:37] then we wonder sometimes well wonder why
[33:40] i can't get
[33:41] and i can't have no more blessing you
[33:43] don't watch you let down in you
[33:46] you say well i'm a christian well that
[33:49] is
[33:49] more sun you should pray more than ever
[33:52] read the bible every day pray
[33:56] don't make any decision too harshly
[33:59] or too quickly without first considering
[34:02] god about it
[34:04] ask him shall i do this father ask him
[34:08] is it your will for me to do this then
[34:11] see what the spirit will speak to you
[34:13] he might not give you a vision but he
[34:16] will speak in some way to you
[34:18] to let you know if you are sincere and
[34:21] ask him amen to beat amalek
[34:26] you must have a prayer life we have come
[34:30] to kurdish barnia brother poland
[34:33] when god has given the issue to the
[34:35] church to call to a heart
[34:37] back to your prayer life back to your
[34:39] consecration
[34:41] back to a spot that we consecrate
[34:43] ourself
[34:44] away from the things of the world away
[34:47] from our leader petty differences among
[34:50] and get back to god and brotherly love
[34:53] and humility back to the power of god
[34:56] again let's stop rudy let's stand here
[35:08] amen i'm sorry i went six minutes over
[35:16] let's pray heavenly father
[35:20] lord we thank you again for your grace
[35:23] for your love and your mercy
[35:25] father you told us this morning that to
[35:28] overcome we must recognize
[35:30] the devil in all his tactics lord father
[35:33] you have spoken to us showing us many
[35:35] aspects of the amalekite
[35:37] how this demon this spirit that i fight
[35:41] have fought the christian throughout the
[35:43] ages is the same spirit we are fighting
[35:46] now
[35:47] the same old devil that started from the
[35:50] garden of eden
[35:52] it is the same devil we are dealing with
[35:54] him lord
[35:55] the tactics are still the same attacking
[35:58] from the back
[35:59] waiting when we are feeble to attack and
[36:02] to destroy our life
[36:03] and the life of our children lord father
[36:06] but you gave us a promise today
[36:08] and you reminded us again lord that you
[36:11] are not only the god of the hill
[36:13] you are the god of the valley even
[36:15] though we are going through difficulties
[36:18] to trial to problem through any kind of
[36:21] persecution
[36:22] father you are reminding us that you are
[36:25] dead because you spoke in your word that
[36:27] you shall not leave
[36:28] us nor forsake us you will be with us
[36:31] all the way to the end
[36:32] father we believe those words because
[36:34] they are truth
[36:35] and those words are lies to us father
[36:39] lord jesus christ you spoke again
[36:41] tonight this morning
[36:42] insisting in our prayer life lord
[36:45] because amalek always attack when we are
[36:47] weak lord
[36:48] father may you consecrate our life may
[36:51] you bring each one of us to a strong
[36:53] prayer life than before
[36:55] to a connection lord father that all the
[36:58] channel
[36:59] that you have built in us when you send
[37:01] us to this world
[37:02] can be completely unclogged and the
[37:05] spirit of the lord will be moving freely
[37:07] and blessing us speaking to us
[37:09] ministering to us
[37:11] fellowshipping with us lord until our
[37:13] life become a true
[37:15] living sacrifice and a reflection of
[37:18] jesus christ being the same
[37:20] yesterday today and forever lord we
[37:22] commit this church
[37:23] we commit every family unto the hand and
[37:26] we're asking you lord father
[37:27] that you continue to speak to us so you
[37:30] cannot send your word and your word will
[37:32] return void
[37:33] if you send your word you know the grant
[37:35] that the word will fall onto
[37:37] and father may he bring forth fruit may
[37:39] lord father consecration comes more
[37:42] in the life of your children because in
[37:44] your word there is power
[37:46] power lord father to live your life
[37:48] because your word is a seed
[37:50] and every seed shall reproduce itself
[37:53] according to its khan
[37:54] may lord father the seed that you have
[37:56] brought this morning
[37:57] lord father bring forth fruit some 100
[38:00] some 60 some 30 lord but whatever it can
[38:04] be brought according to the ability
[38:06] that you have on someone may lord father
[38:08] everyone
[38:09] flourish and make the move in a position
[38:12] higher than before
[38:13] as we committed everything unto the hand
[38:15] and ask it
