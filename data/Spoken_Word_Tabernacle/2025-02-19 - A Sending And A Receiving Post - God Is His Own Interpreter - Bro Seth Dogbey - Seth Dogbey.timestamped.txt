[31:04] prophet to give us the
[31:07] timing that he was two to three hours

[46:24] amen from The Book of Proverbs
[46:28] amen thank you very much musicians amen
[46:32] amen it's quite a different feeling
[46:35] standing here
[46:37] amen amen so I want to read um The Book
[46:41] of Proverbs chapter
[46:43] 3 amen verse 5 and
[46:50] six Proverbs 3 5 and 6
[46:57] it says trust in the Lord with all thine
[47:01] heart yes sir and lean not onto thy own
[47:05] understanding Amen in all thy ways
[47:09] acknowledge Him yes sir and he shall
[47:12] direct thy path amen amen amen can you
[47:16] be seated tonight amen amen
[47:20] amen we thank the Lord that we could all
[47:22] make it to church tonight amen the
[47:25] prophet said if you want to see the
[47:26] right come to the weekday
[47:29] Services amen you going to see the
[47:32] people who really want to come to church
[47:35] amen
[47:36] amen and the real ones amen and I
[47:40] believe I can see the real bride tonight
[47:42] amen of spoken with Tabernacle amen
[47:45] regardless of the challenge of the
[47:47] weather we are here we are the ones who
[47:49] are able to roll back the storm amen
[47:53] whatever storm it is we know is not
[47:56] going to prevent us amen and we shall
[47:58] come to the presence of the Lord amen
[48:01] amen amen so you want to thank the Lord
[48:05] tonight amen for calling us bride amen
[48:09] amen amen now Bible says trust in the
[48:14] Lord with all your heart and lean not
[48:17] onto your own understanding yes
[48:20] sir there's one interest interesting
[48:23] thing about
[48:25] communication men
[48:28] that when somebody says
[48:31] something it is easy to misund
[48:35] understand that's right when let's
[48:38] say um point a say
[48:42] something as soon as it moves from point
[48:46] A there is the likelihood that it's
[48:50] going to get misunderstood correct amen
[48:53] before it gets to point
[48:55] BH that has always been a challenge yes
[48:58] sir that is why we have
[49:02] um in let's say in our uh maybe doctor's
[49:07] offices we have maybe when we are using
[49:10] certain products and stuff like that
[49:13] they really invest in what we call
[49:17] uh communication or we have uh frontex
[49:21] that you have to talk to or you have
[49:24] customer service amen cuz when maybe
[49:28] you're using maybe uh maybe AT&T or
[49:32] using uh uh T-mobile any of this ones
[49:37] and decide you said okay today I'm I'm
[49:40] going to stop using
[49:41] T-Mobile after that they're going to
[49:44] call you to ask you what really happened
[49:49] why did you switch from this to that
[49:53] they really want to understand what is
[49:56] the problem that's right so it is always
[50:00] important for companies to really see
[50:04] that they are on the same page with
[50:07] their customers that's right because for
[50:10] the business to really move on well yes
[50:13] sir the um the uh the provider and the
[50:17] customer must be on the same page that's
[50:20] right amen yes sir so it's very
[50:22] important that companies really invest
[50:25] in customer service because of one thing
[50:29] called misunderstanding or
[50:32] misinterpretation communication is a
[50:34] very important to yes
[50:38] amen
[50:41] so now when God says
[50:45] something God says I am going to do this
[50:49] or I've given you a
[50:51] promise it is very important to
[50:54] understand what he saying amen
[50:58] very very important to understand what
[51:00] God is saying right so when God says I
[51:05] am going to do
[51:06] this many of the times is either we
[51:10] heard it and didn't really understand
[51:12] what he's
[51:13] saying or we didn't really hear it
[51:17] right right so when point a is saying
[51:21] something before it gets to point B
[51:24] point B must be on the same page as
[51:28] point a to understand what point a is
[51:32] saying that's right even taking uh maybe
[51:35] a husband and a wife at home a husband
[51:39] can be saying something the wife can be
[51:42] receiving in a different direction
[51:44] that's right or vice versa the wife can
[51:47] be saying something but the husband can
[51:49] be re can receive a different
[51:52] understanding of what the wife is saying
[51:54] that's exactly so that causes a lot of
[51:59] misunderstanding now when the wife says
[52:03] something before the husband will
[52:07] understand one is one is that he can be
[52:10] on the same page the other is that the
[52:14] wife has to come and explain exactly
[52:17] what she meant by what she's
[52:19] saying so it makes the wife the the one
[52:23] who is her own interpreter of what she
[52:27] was saying that's exactly right so when
[52:30] God says something he is his own
[52:35] interpreter so God can say something and
[52:38] we can
[52:39] misunderstand what he's saying exactly
[52:43] so God has to come and interpret what
[52:46] he's saying that's exactly right that is
[52:49] my seron tonight he said a sending and a
[52:54] receiving post god is his own
[52:59] interpreter
[53:02] amen so we want to um read this
[53:11] um now before we read this quote let's
[53:14] go to uh second
[53:16] Peter chapter 1 second Peter
[53:20] 1 um forgive me tonight I'm trying to
[53:24] read amen um
[53:31] now second Peter chapter
[53:37] 1 second Peter chapter 1 from verse one
[53:43] amen it says Simon Peter a servant and
[53:47] Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that
[53:52] have obtained like Precious Faith with
[53:55] us
[53:57] through the righteousness of God and our
[54:00] Savior Jesus Christ now Peter is talking
[54:04] to a specific people that's right that
[54:08] is the the the the Saints of like
[54:11] Precious Faith that's right he was
[54:14] specific now when Peter came Bible gave
[54:17] a description of who he was it is always
[54:22] good to understand who we are when we
[54:25] are speaking
[54:27] when I am a child of God there's nothing
[54:30] wrong by saying that I am a Son of God
[54:34] when God has called you into ministry as
[54:37] a pastor there's nothing wrong by saying
[54:39] he's the pastor of the church that's
[54:42] right amen yes amen and it's specific to
[54:46] a specific people he said Grace and
[54:49] peace be
[54:51] multiplied unto you through the
[54:54] knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord
[54:58] am so he's talking about a
[55:01] multiplication yes sir of Grace and we
[55:05] could see that it is through a channel
[55:07] called the knowledge of God that's so
[55:11] before we talk about Grace and peace one
[55:14] important thing that we can talk about
[55:16] is the knowledge of God that is why the
[55:20] spirit of God will always bring this
[55:22] knowledge of Christ to our remembrance
[55:25] because Grace and peace must be
[55:28] multiplied to a specific called
[55:32] people amen said according as his divine
[55:37] power have given unto us all
[55:42] things that pertain unto life and
[55:47] godliness Christ has given us all
[55:52] things it is not some things it is not
[55:56] that yesterday I was healed of a
[55:59] headache tomorrow okay I go to God and
[56:02] say oh Lord I mean you you did enough
[56:05] for the headache when I come back today
[56:07] with a different problem it is a promise
[56:10] to me that God will
[56:13] answer when God heals me today tomorrow
[56:17] when I have a need I go back to God
[56:19] because he's giving me all things am am
[56:23] am amen amen
[56:27] that pertain to life and
[56:31] godliness everything about your life
[56:35] everything about your eternal life he
[56:38] has given to us anything that is pertain
[56:42] to Godliness he has given to us that is
[56:46] why God is using the ministry to
[56:49] strengthen things out because everything
[56:53] that is connected to Godliness has been
[56:56] given to the bride in this last age so
[57:00] anything the prophet said if there is
[57:03] any question Bible question there is a
[57:07] Bible answer to it amen so when we come
[57:10] with our questions we know that God is
[57:13] going to have an answer to it amen he's
[57:16] given us
[57:18] everything that pertain onto life and
[57:21] godliness through the knowledge of him
[57:25] that had called us to glory and
[57:29] virtue so it is very important to really
[57:34] understand the one who has called us am
[57:38] am very important to understand the one
[57:41] who has called us amen he said whereby
[57:45] are given unto us
[57:48] exceeding great and precious
[57:53] promises exceeding great and precious
[57:55] prom promises their promises are not
[57:58] little promises they are great and
[58:02] precious great means great something
[58:06] beyond your understanding something
[58:08] beyond your imagination is what God has
[58:11] given to us they are promises that he's
[58:14] given to us and those promises pertain
[58:18] to life and godliness that's right
[58:21] anything that we need concerning our
[58:24] lives and godliness he has given to us
[58:29] amen amen so whereby are given unto us
[58:33] exceeding great and precious promises
[58:36] that by this ye might be
[58:38] partakers of the divine nature am amen
[58:43] amen God's promise is that we are
[58:46] partakers of the divine nature amen so
[58:50] that's why God is bringing to us to
[58:53] understand that we have a Divine part
[58:55] and a human part
[58:57] amen so our mind must go back to the
[59:01] Divine part that he has made it
[59:04] partakers of that divine
[59:07] nature amen amen amen amen amen all
[59:12] right so I I want to um skip
[59:16] to verse 8 so um with with the preceding
[59:22] verses it talks about um add unto your
[59:25] faith um
[59:27] and all that love being the topmost of
[59:29] all and then so I'm reading from vers
[59:32] for if these things be in you and abound
[59:36] they make you that you shall neither be
[59:38] Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[59:41] of our Lord Jesus Christ amen but he
[59:44] that lath these things is blind and and
[59:47] cannot see a far off and have forgotten
[59:51] that he was pered from his old sins so
[59:54] we are talking about a divine nature
[59:57] that brings us into
[59:59] remembrance of who God is amen so when
[1:00:02] we don't have this divine nature it
[1:00:05] means we've lost something we can't see
[1:00:09] amen we we under a kind of Amnesia and
[1:00:13] didn't even understand that God had
[1:00:16] taken us away from our old nature that's
[1:00:19] right amen so God consistently bring to
[1:00:22] our remembrance that we are partakers of
[1:00:24] that divine nature amen so so let's keep
[1:00:29] reading it said wherefore the rather
[1:00:31] that's verse 10 Brethren give diligence
[1:00:35] to make your calling and election sure
[1:00:38] for if you do these things you shall
[1:00:41] never fall am amen now let me go to 15
[1:00:46] it said moreover I will endeavor that
[1:00:49] you may be able after my
[1:00:53] decease to have these things always in
[1:00:57] remembrance Peter is saying that even
[1:01:01] when the Lord take me away he wants to
[1:01:04] keep bringing these things to our
[1:01:07] remembrance let us understand this
[1:01:10] things and before that he said we had
[1:01:13] not believed kindly devis
[1:01:17] fables
[1:01:20] amen they were
[1:01:22] witnesses to the experience yes sir of
[1:01:26] divine nature amen they were witnesses
[1:01:28] to the experience of deity that's right
[1:01:31] amen and before Christ left he said the
[1:01:35] glory that the father had given to me I
[1:01:38] give unto you that's right amen so Peter
[1:01:42] is reminding the saints that we are
[1:01:45] partakers of that divine nature that's
[1:01:48] right amen so when God
[1:01:51] speaks it takes an understanding to
[1:01:55] really know what he's talking about
[1:01:57] that's exactly right amen now you know
[1:02:00] what the Holy Ghost does the bible as
[1:02:04] Jesus was leaving he said I'll send down
[1:02:06] I'll send to you another comforter and
[1:02:09] what is the comforter doing he's
[1:02:11] bringing to
[1:02:12] you remembrance he's remembering the
[1:02:15] things that Christ has said to you
[1:02:17] that's right amen so in Peter the Holy
[1:02:20] Ghost was operating to bring it back to
[1:02:24] our remembrance the things that Christ
[1:02:27] has said that's right amen so said
[1:02:30] moreover I will endeavor that ye may be
[1:02:32] able after my decease to have these
[1:02:35] things always in remembrance for we have
[1:02:38] not followed kindly devis fables when we
[1:02:42] made known unto you the
[1:02:44] power and coming of our Lord Jesus
[1:02:47] Christ now when you look at it you can
[1:02:50] read it this way it said when we made
[1:02:52] unto unto you the power of of our Lord
[1:02:56] Jesus
[1:02:57] Christ made unto you the coming of our
[1:03:00] Lord Jesus Christ so the power of our
[1:03:03] Lord Jesus Christ was manifested in the
[1:03:06] disciples amen the power was not left
[1:03:10] alone to
[1:03:12] Christ but Peter is saying we manifested
[1:03:16] to you the power of our Lord Jesus
[1:03:18] Christ right so is bringing to our
[1:03:21] remembrance that that same power was
[1:03:24] given to the bride that same power was
[1:03:27] given to the church so the spirit of God
[1:03:30] keeps coming to remember you that that
[1:03:33] divine power was given to you am am amen
[1:03:38] amen so 17 said for he received from God
[1:03:43] the Father honor and Glory when there
[1:03:47] came such a voice to him from the
[1:03:50] excellent Glory this is my beloved Son
[1:03:54] in whom I am well pleased right and this
[1:03:57] voice which came from heaven we heard
[1:04:01] when we were with him in the Holy
[1:04:03] Mount we have also a more sure word of
[1:04:08] Prophecy where unto you do well that you
[1:04:11] take heat as unto a light that shineth
[1:04:15] in the dark place until the day Dawn and
[1:04:18] the day star AR right in your heart
[1:04:21] knowing
[1:04:24] this amen yes sir knowing this first
[1:04:29] that no
[1:04:31] Prophecy of the scripture is of any
[1:04:35] private
[1:04:38] [Music]
[1:04:41] interpretation amen
[1:04:44] amen amen so that was the point yes sir
[1:04:47] he said knowing this first yes sir that
[1:04:51] no Prophecy of the scripture is of any
[1:04:54] private interpret a for the prophecy
[1:04:58] came not in Old Time by the will of men
[1:05:02] but holy men of God spake as they were
[1:05:06] moved by the Holy
[1:05:08] Ghost so when Peter was speaking to the
[1:05:11] church he was telling them that it is
[1:05:13] the holy ghost that is speaking to you
[1:05:16] he's bringing these things to
[1:05:18] remembrance that remember that same
[1:05:21] power was given to you that's right amen
[1:05:24] amen amen amen so now when when let's
[1:05:28] say somebody gives you a
[1:05:32] promise let's say um I said brother
[1:05:36] Freddy um I'm going to give you
[1:05:40] $1,000 right
[1:05:45] now amen
[1:05:49] amen so now what is brother Freddy
[1:05:55] supposed to
[1:05:56] do all what brother Freddy is supposed
[1:05:59] to do is to sit and wait for the
[1:06:03] $1,000 brother
[1:06:05] Freddy is not going to manufacture the
[1:06:08] giving of the
[1:06:10] $1,000 I am the one who is supposed to
[1:06:13] come in to perform that amen so when a
[1:06:18] promise is given sir it it it is it is
[1:06:22] an obligation to the one giving the
[1:06:25] promise to perform whatever he has
[1:06:29] said so when God has given us a promise
[1:06:33] it is his obligation to perform that
[1:06:37] until that that promise is not
[1:06:40] fulfilled
[1:06:42] amen amen now talking about
[1:06:44] misunderstanding this is from the
[1:06:46] message God being misunderstood yes
[1:06:49] brother take it said you
[1:06:52] know misunderstanding gets in a lot of
[1:07:02] trouble a lot of
[1:07:04] trouble
[1:07:06] misunderstanding gets us in a lot of
[1:07:11] trouble it said many times that people
[1:07:14] say things that they repeat after
[1:07:18] somebody
[1:07:20] else where they misunderstood them
[1:07:25] yes sir so when somebody says I am going
[1:07:30] to give brother Freddy
[1:07:32] $1,000 and you heard
[1:07:34] it you must come back to me and
[1:07:39] understand what I'm trying to
[1:07:41] say am I going to give him cash am I
[1:07:46] going to give him a
[1:07:48] check am I going to do a Zeal transfer
[1:07:52] to
[1:07:53] him I money order
[1:07:59] amen so when a third party comes in in
[1:08:04] that
[1:08:04] conversation and picks
[1:08:07] that bra Bram is saying that we get into
[1:08:11] a lot of trouble when somebody else is
[1:08:14] repeating what is being said so when God
[1:08:18] gives a promise to the bride and a
[1:08:22] minister comes here and is not in line
[1:08:26] is not in tune with what God has said
[1:08:30] he's going to give a wrong
[1:08:32] interpretation and that is going to
[1:08:34] bring a
[1:08:37] misunderstanding hallelujah
[1:08:39] amen
[1:08:41] amen amen so the prophet said that gets
[1:08:45] a person in trouble that's right I
[1:08:48] believe it will be good for us if we
[1:08:51] just well wait till we understood what
[1:08:57] you was talking
[1:08:58] about don't you think
[1:09:02] so that's what the prophet is saying I
[1:09:05] said I know it will be for me a very
[1:09:09] good for me to find out first and then
[1:09:13] say
[1:09:16] it amen so many times we can have
[1:09:20] somebody come to talk to us about one
[1:09:22] sister or about one brother
[1:09:26] this one did that this one did this this
[1:09:28] one said this this one said
[1:09:30] that most of the time the problem is
[1:09:34] with the third party that is receiving
[1:09:36] that
[1:09:37] information amen and it becomes very
[1:09:42] dangerous when that person is
[1:09:44] propagating that message without going
[1:09:47] back to understand from the one who said
[1:09:51] it or the one who did
[1:09:54] it amen
[1:09:56] amen that has always been a problem but
[1:09:59] BR said we get into trouble with
[1:10:02] that amen it says see but we are always
[1:10:06] seem to be
[1:10:10] misunderstood amen amen so the prophet
[1:10:13] was talking about um Psalm 106 we are
[1:10:17] going to read Psalm 106 amen I mean if
[1:10:21] we can turn to some
[1:10:24] 106 vers 7
[1:10:28] uhuh Psalm 106 verse
[1:10:36] 7 Psalm
[1:10:41] 106:7 if we are there we can say amen
[1:10:45] amen Psalm 106:7 said our fathers
[1:10:50] understood not thy wonders in Egypt
[1:10:56] they remembered not the multitude of thy
[1:10:59] mercies but provoked him at the Red Sea
[1:11:04] at the sea amen even at the Red Sea it
[1:11:07] said our fathers did not understand what
[1:11:12] you were doing in
[1:11:14] Egypt so God was doing something that's
[1:11:17] right to um to Israel to make Israel see
[1:11:21] something but they didn't understand
[1:11:24] what he was doing
[1:11:25] through the Miracles that was doing in
[1:11:28] Egypt amen so the prophet is saying here
[1:11:31] David is speaking of Israel
[1:11:33] misunderstood his miracles when they
[1:11:36] were in Egypt that's right
[1:11:39] amen now in the same message God being
[1:11:42] misunderstood he said now to
[1:11:45] misunderstand is just not to say well I
[1:11:48] didn't hear what he
[1:11:51] said so you could have heard what the
[1:11:54] person
[1:11:56] said amen amen you could have heard what
[1:12:00] God Said of the promises you could have
[1:12:03] heard what the prophet preached about
[1:12:06] the
[1:12:06] message but BR saying now to
[1:12:09] misunderstand it's just not to say well
[1:12:12] I didn't hear what he said we all heard
[1:12:16] what the prophet
[1:12:17] said but to see something done and
[1:12:23] misunderstand what it's for
[1:12:25] that's right amen that's right so you
[1:12:29] saw it but you didn't understand what it
[1:12:33] was for the meaning of that thing ex
[1:12:38] amen you saw a movement you saw somebody
[1:12:42] moving from point A to point B yes you
[1:12:45] saw it but what was the meaning of
[1:12:49] that amen that has always been the
[1:12:52] problem sir amen say said that you're
[1:12:56] missing the boat all completely then it
[1:13:00] said now God doesn't do Miracles just to
[1:13:04] say see I'm
[1:13:06] God God does a miracle for un
[1:13:11] understanding see God does it for a
[1:13:16] purpose so when God heal somebody in
[1:13:20] this
[1:13:21] church God does that for a
[1:13:24] purpose amen for us to understand what
[1:13:27] he's saying there's a message he's given
[1:13:30] to the church that is why God pick
[1:13:33] somebody and he always uses somebody as
[1:13:36] an example when God heals somebody of a
[1:13:40] kidney disease is an example that the
[1:13:43] spirit of depression can also be healed
[1:13:46] by God that cancer can be healed by God
[1:13:50] that any form of headache can be healed
[1:13:53] by God Amen so when God sends something
[1:13:57] like that it is a sign that he's given
[1:14:00] to the
[1:14:02] church amen so he said God does a
[1:14:07] miracle for un understanding see God
[1:14:11] does it for a purpose and did you notice
[1:14:13] the reading of the Psalms here in in
[1:14:16] this seventh verse which you read I
[1:14:18] think it's so beautiful I want to read
[1:14:20] it over again it said our fathers
[1:14:22] understood not thy wonders in Egypt see
[1:14:25] they he understand it they remember not
[1:14:28] the multitude of thy mercies but
[1:14:31] provoked him at the sea even the Red Sea
[1:14:34] so nevertheless he saved them for his
[1:14:37] name's sake that he might make his
[1:14:41] mighty power to be
[1:14:42] known so even though they didn't believe
[1:14:45] even though they provoked him God still
[1:14:48] saved them why because he was still
[1:14:51] sending a
[1:14:53] message he was still sending a message
[1:14:56] to you and I who come and read
[1:14:59] that amen so regardless of unbel in the
[1:15:04] land God still did the miracle because
[1:15:08] he's still sending a
[1:15:11] message amen it said see they did not
[1:15:16] understand why God down in Egypt
[1:15:18] performed this Miracles he was trying to
[1:15:20] show them his mercies that's right he
[1:15:23] was trying to get them to understand
[1:15:25] that he was God in their midst I love
[1:15:29] that I love that the prophet said I love
[1:15:32] that so when somebody comes here and we
[1:15:36] we pray for the person and the person
[1:15:38] gets healed what is the message the
[1:15:41] message is I am God in your
[1:15:44] midst amen when somebody ask for
[1:15:47] something from the Lord and the Lord
[1:15:49] provides what's the message he's trying
[1:15:52] to tell the church I am in your midst
[1:15:56] amen
[1:15:58] amen amen so say and that's what in the
[1:16:03] same message uh paragraph 117 said and
[1:16:06] that's what he's trying to do today
[1:16:08] that's right he just doesn't heal people
[1:16:11] just because he can heal he's trying to
[1:16:14] get to you that he's the resurrection
[1:16:18] that he can make you well he can raise
[1:16:21] up your body amen so he's healing you to
[1:16:26] tell you that the Rapture is not a myth
[1:16:30] the Rapture is a reality he can raise up
[1:16:33] your
[1:16:35] body
[1:16:37] amen he can do whatever he wants to he's
[1:16:42] Jehovah I like
[1:16:44] that said but the people misunderstood
[1:16:46] him God is so easily to be
[1:16:51] misunderstood by unbelievers
[1:16:54] [Music]
[1:16:57] unbeliever so that's the point
[1:17:00] unbelievers that's why the prophet said
[1:17:03] only
[1:17:04] believe only believe because that's how
[1:17:08] you can understand God when he's doing
[1:17:11] something amen it said God is so easily
[1:17:15] to be misunderstood by unbelievers by
[1:17:17] those who don't want to understand
[1:17:20] that's
[1:17:21] right now let's take a conflict yes my
[1:17:24] brother of two
[1:17:28] people if one or two of them do not want
[1:17:33] to
[1:17:34] understand nothing is going to be
[1:17:37] solved nothing is going to be
[1:17:40] solved let's say a wife and a husband
[1:17:43] has a conflict and then they bring it to
[1:17:45] the
[1:17:46] pastor and this one says I'm right that
[1:17:49] one to says I'm
[1:17:50] right nothing is going to be solved
[1:17:54] amen because somebody would
[1:18:01] understand
[1:18:02] amen amen it said many people try to
[1:18:06] understand many don't want to understand
[1:18:10] they just shut up
[1:18:14] themselves so let's talk about the
[1:18:16] message of the
[1:18:18] hour you talk it you speak about
[1:18:22] it many don't want to
[1:18:26] understand you call the name of brother
[1:18:29] Braham they don't want to
[1:18:31] hear even in the message talk about the
[1:18:35] cloud talk about the pillar of fire they
[1:18:37] don't want to go near
[1:18:40] it and one difficult thing as the pastor
[1:18:43] is taking us through I just thank the
[1:18:45] Lord for that is God veiled in
[1:18:50] flesh that is a big one now bring it
[1:18:55] that to the church it depends on whether
[1:18:58] the person wants to understand or the
[1:19:01] person doesn't want to understand but
[1:19:04] whether you want to understand or you
[1:19:06] don't want to understand it is a fact
[1:19:10] God interpret his own word to his
[1:19:13] church
[1:19:15] amen said many don't want to understand
[1:19:17] they just shut up themselves and say
[1:19:20] there's no such a thing I don't believe
[1:19:22] in such
[1:19:25] then they can never
[1:19:28] understand amen when you shut up
[1:19:31] yourself when the word of God is coming
[1:19:34] as long as it's coming from the Bible
[1:19:36] it's coming from the message of the hour
[1:19:38] and you shut up yourself you won't
[1:19:42] understand amen because you shut up
[1:19:47] yourself amen the proph said then they
[1:19:50] can never understand but a man that is
[1:19:53] willing ah to understand that is willing
[1:19:58] to sit down and come let us reason
[1:20:03] together say the Lord now that man is on
[1:20:08] the line of learning something from the
[1:20:12] Lord when the difficult word is coming
[1:20:16] to you you don't understand it's and and
[1:20:20] Bible says that lean not onto your own
[1:20:23] understanding right amen many of times
[1:20:26] we switch or we are always on the line
[1:20:29] of the fleshly understanding because so
[1:20:33] many things have been pumped into our
[1:20:35] minds we see a whole lot of things we
[1:20:37] read a whole lot of things and excuse me
[1:20:39] to say sometimes a lot of garbage goes
[1:20:42] inside and and and there's there's one
[1:20:45] thing sorry I have to go into Data amen
[1:20:49] there's there's a saying in there that
[1:20:50] garbage in garbage out when you when you
[1:20:52] bring in garbage we can analyze
[1:20:55] something meaningful whatever analysis
[1:20:58] we come up with is garbage so when you
[1:21:01] go into the world and you are hearing a
[1:21:03] lot of garbage from people a lot of
[1:21:06] garbage from the internet what is coming
[1:21:08] out of you is
[1:21:10] [Applause]
[1:21:16] garbage
[1:21:18] amen
[1:21:21] amen said but people who always are
[1:21:25] associated with God and God's power said
[1:21:29] you can hardly be associated with god
[1:21:31] without being associated with his
[1:21:35] power you can hardly be associated with
[1:21:39] God and not associated with his power so
[1:21:42] when we are connected to God we are
[1:21:45] connected to his
[1:21:47] power it goes together am amen amen it
[1:21:52] said because when you associated with
[1:21:54] him you are acquainted with to him or a
[1:21:58] relative to him and then you have his
[1:22:01] power in
[1:22:03] you a relative to him amen so my wife is
[1:22:09] my spouse it's a relative to me amen so
[1:22:14] when I'm connected to God I am God's
[1:22:17] wife and that power is also pertaining
[1:22:21] to
[1:22:22] me amen is said that that's the reason
[1:22:25] that people cannot believe in miracles
[1:22:27] today because they don't have anything
[1:22:29] in them to believe with that's right
[1:22:32] amen there's nothing inside to believe
[1:22:34] in miracles amen so they not going to
[1:22:37] believe it said they've they've got to
[1:22:40] have something in there to believe with
[1:22:44] and when the spirit of God is in a
[1:22:46] man he will say Amen to every word of
[1:22:52] God and every Mir
[1:22:55] of
[1:22:56] God
[1:22:58] Amen so when the spirit of God is in US
[1:23:03] amen yes sir so don't have a problem
[1:23:05] with me when I'm shouting
[1:23:09] amen amen when the word of God is coming
[1:23:14] you can't take away my
[1:23:16] amen because the word is for me because
[1:23:21] the word is inside of me the word has to
[1:23:24] con to the word so you can't stop my
[1:23:27] amen it can never
[1:23:30] happen
[1:23:32] amen I don't care whether I lose my
[1:23:34] voice amen I'm going to shout amen
[1:23:38] because that word is
[1:23:40] me amen so now the prophet said you
[1:23:44] can't get blood from a turnip because
[1:23:47] there's no blood in it no no blood amen
[1:23:51] so that's the same way you can't get
[1:23:53] believe out of unbeliever because
[1:23:56] there's nothing there to believe
[1:23:58] with there's nothing there to believe
[1:24:01] with now we we go to Daniel
[1:24:05] said the prophet said Daniel was
[1:24:07] misunderstood when all all the rest of
[1:24:10] the children of Israel bow down to the
[1:24:13] image but he and shedrach and mesach and
[1:24:19] Abednego refused to bow down well they
[1:24:22] said what's the matter with him
[1:24:25] the whole nation said what's the matter
[1:24:27] with this crazy guy well all the rest of
[1:24:31] the
[1:24:35] Hebrews the rest of the
[1:24:38] Hebrews now we
[1:24:41] had four friends who were Hebrews who
[1:24:46] also believed the god of Isaac the god
[1:24:49] of Jacob the god of um Abraham they all
[1:24:53] believe that
[1:24:54] but these four special people did not
[1:24:57] believe it so the prophet said they were
[1:25:01] misunderstood when they didn't bow to
[1:25:04] the image because the rest of the
[1:25:07] Hebrews bow to the
[1:25:09] image so I can see one Hebrew child
[1:25:12] coming to them you know we all believe
[1:25:14] in the god of Isaac we all believe the
[1:25:17] the god of Abraham you know uh it's a
[1:25:20] Lord that has given that we should
[1:25:23] obey amen
[1:25:25] it's an image of
[1:25:27] Daniel the Prophet
[1:25:31] himself
[1:25:32] amen and and and this happened when
[1:25:37] Nebuchadnezzar saw the manifestation of
[1:25:40] God in a man in human
[1:25:43] flesh amen so he brought that image Amen
[1:25:48] to show
[1:25:50] [Applause]
[1:25:53] Dey amen
[1:25:56] amen but the prophet
[1:25:59] said Daniel shedrach mishak and abedu
[1:26:04] refus to bow down amen
[1:26:07] amen the
[1:26:09] prophet and the
[1:26:14] bride they say the same thing yes sir
[1:26:18] and they do the same
[1:26:20] thing the prophet or the prophets are
[1:26:24] always examples that God gave in every
[1:26:28] age so you see Daniel being a prophet
[1:26:33] Amen in that age had friends who were
[1:26:38] the bride and they were doing exactly
[1:26:41] the same thing that Daniel was doing
[1:26:45] that's right amen so when the prophet
[1:26:47] comes with the message it is an example
[1:26:51] to the bride who are looking onto the
[1:26:55] Prophet yes my brother amen
[1:26:58] yes now now I'm taking this for how can
[1:27:01] I overcome yes so the prophet said and
[1:27:05] Daniel a man a prophet amen shedrach M
[1:27:10] Abednego Daniel was the prophet and that
[1:27:14] was the size of the church in that day I
[1:27:17] mean the bride that's exactly right amen
[1:27:21] so the prophet is saying that Daniel was
[1:27:24] the prophet shedrach mesach and Abednego
[1:27:28] were the bright in that age amen so he
[1:27:32] said there's lots of
[1:27:35] church about 2 million of them went down
[1:27:40] there amen they bow to the
[1:27:44] image he said that was the size of the
[1:27:47] Overcomer and them Overcomers were put
[1:27:50] was put to the test and every overcomer
[1:27:54] has to be put to the test and when they
[1:27:57] said you take back what the word says or
[1:28:00] either be throw it in the fiery furnace
[1:28:02] they refuse anything but the word amen
[1:28:07] so the church the bride always stand
[1:28:11] according to what they see manifested in
[1:28:14] the prophet that was sent to them that's
[1:28:17] exactly
[1:28:19] amen amen amen so
[1:28:24] as as um we we we seeing tonight God
[1:28:28] sends a prophet as an example to his
[1:28:31] bride now an example is always a model
[1:28:34] that is shown for
[1:28:36] replication it so when when let's say
[1:28:40] let's say you um you're going to get a
[1:28:43] house or you're going to get an
[1:28:44] apartment normally when you go to the
[1:28:47] leasing office they have what we call a
[1:28:50] model amen where the Furnitures are
[1:28:52] being arranged where the FL flowers and
[1:28:54] all that stuff are put together it's
[1:28:56] just to tell you that you can have your
[1:28:59] room as beautiful as this that's it amen
[1:29:03] so a model gives you an idea that we
[1:29:06] have a window here we have a door here
[1:29:09] we have a dining room here we have a
[1:29:11] bathroom here we have this here and it's
[1:29:14] an example that is given to you now you
[1:29:17] can see that example and know that okay
[1:29:22] in this apartment complex in this house
[1:29:25] complex when I go for a room like this
[1:29:27] or when I go for a house like this I'm
[1:29:30] going to find a window I'm going to find
[1:29:33] a door I'm going to find a bathroom I'm
[1:29:35] going to find two bedrooms I'm going to
[1:29:37] find all those things so when the
[1:29:39] prophet was sent to this last age we
[1:29:42] watch exactly what God manifested in the
[1:29:45] prophet to tell us what the bride has
[1:29:49] amen everything that the prophet had
[1:29:52] been manifest or or everything that God
[1:29:55] manifested in the prophet was an example
[1:29:58] to the bride to
[1:30:00] replicate amen for us to see that this
[1:30:04] is who we are
[1:30:08] amen amen so Amos chapter 3 talks about
[1:30:12] um God not doing
[1:30:15] anything except he reveals it to the
[1:30:18] prophet so the prophets are always
[1:30:21] examples that we would have to see amen
[1:30:24] Paul says follow me as I follow Christ
[1:30:26] amen so whilst you are watching Paul
[1:30:29] following Christ you are seeing exactly
[1:30:32] the manifestation of the word of God in
[1:30:35] Paul that's in that age
[1:30:38] amen amen
[1:30:40] amen now Bible says God in s times spoke
[1:30:44] through the prophets but in this last
[1:30:47] days through his
[1:30:49] son before the son started manifestation
[1:30:53] there was a prophet called John the
[1:30:55] Baptista amen so God never did nothing
[1:31:00] without the prophets even when the sun
[1:31:03] was manifested there was a prophet on
[1:31:06] the land amen amen there was a prophet
[1:31:09] on the land amen so are we sons of God
[1:31:15] Amen as children of God there is also a
[1:31:19] prophet that is manifested for us to see
[1:31:23] because God won't do anything when God
[1:31:26] is sending a message he has to send it
[1:31:28] through a channel amen and there is a
[1:31:31] message in this last age the message to
[1:31:35] us is the Capstone Ministry what is the
[1:31:39] Capstone the fullness of Christ manifest
[1:31:43] in
[1:31:45] flesh the fullness of God manifest in
[1:31:50] flesh that is the Capstone amen men sent
[1:31:54] to the bride in this last age so it is
[1:31:57] telling us that God has given us a way
[1:32:03] for us to become equal with
[1:32:06] Christ amen so that's why Peter is
[1:32:10] saying that we have been called to be
[1:32:12] partakers of the divine nature
[1:32:16] sir amen through all these promises the
[1:32:20] knowledge of Christ we have been called
[1:32:23] to be part Akers of this divine
[1:32:25] nature amen now this is from the message
[1:32:29] who is this
[1:32:31] Meed
[1:32:33] amen he said now we see the attribute
[1:32:36] signs of his Spirit have not yet entered
[1:32:40] into the word form body
[1:32:43] aop amen because um we are we are trying
[1:32:47] to see how different we are from Christ
[1:32:51] right so um as Peter was saying that
[1:32:56] that power that was in Christ we have
[1:32:59] manifested that amen so our mind is okay
[1:33:04] so how did Peter manifest that if they
[1:33:07] were not in the
[1:33:09] Toopy amen so if Christ manifested
[1:33:12] something amen he was in the toopan as
[1:33:15] the prophet said that's right now let's
[1:33:17] read this
[1:33:19] amen said this body is subject to the
[1:33:21] word and earnest
[1:33:24] this body is subject to the word and
[1:33:26] Earnest waiting for the earnest change
[1:33:29] of the body that's I said now the
[1:33:32] difference between him and you as a son
[1:33:35] see he was at the beginning the word and
[1:33:40] morphe body amen he came in and lived in
[1:33:44] that in the person of madc then later we
[1:33:48] never heard no more of madc because he
[1:33:51] became Jesus Christ amen
[1:33:54] MC was the priest but he became Jesus
[1:33:57] Christ now you bypass that because in
[1:34:02] that form you know all things and you
[1:34:05] have never been able to know that
[1:34:09] yet amen you come like Adam like
[1:34:14] me now my question
[1:34:17] is when we came like Adam amen we bypass
[1:34:21] our theop
[1:34:24] the
[1:34:24] beginning Adam was able to name the
[1:34:28] Animals Adam was able to say three move
[1:34:32] here or this go here animal come here he
[1:34:35] was able to talk to that animal but Adam
[1:34:37] bypassed the
[1:34:40] theophany
[1:34:41] amen how did that happen how did God
[1:34:45] achieve that somebody who was not in his
[1:34:48] theophany so God is sending us a message
[1:34:52] that even if we are not in the theop
[1:34:56] body he showed us an example in Adam
[1:35:01] amen so there is a way that we can
[1:35:04] manifest deity without even being in a
[1:35:08] theop
[1:35:11] body amen so Peter is still remembering
[1:35:16] the
[1:35:18] church that that power power amen that
[1:35:23] was Christ we have manifested that same
[1:35:26] power to
[1:35:28] you
[1:35:30] remember amen it is a promise and he
[1:35:33] said it's an exceeding great
[1:35:37] promise given to you the
[1:35:39] church that's right amen it said you
[1:35:42] became from the attribute to the flesh
[1:35:46] to be tempted but when the life is
[1:35:49] finished here if this Earthly Tabernacle
[1:35:51] be dissolved we have one already waiting
[1:35:55] that's where we go that is the word then
[1:35:58] we can look back and see what we done
[1:36:02] now we don't understand it we have never
[1:36:05] become the word we just become flesh men
[1:36:08] not the word that's amen
[1:36:13] amen now we said um in the same message
[1:36:17] who is this me sedc it said uh from uh 2
[1:36:21] Corinthians 5:11 he said if this Earthly
[1:36:23] body be dissolved I'm trying to run very
[1:36:26] fast with this I'm not looking at the
[1:36:29] time but I'm trying to go fast this
[1:36:32] Earthly Tabernacle we have another one
[1:36:35] see we have bypass that to come straight
[1:36:37] from God the attribute to be flesh to be
[1:36:41] tempted and tested by sin like Adam did
[1:36:45] but when testing of his word is over
[1:36:48] then we are taken up to this body that
[1:36:51] was prepared for us before the
[1:36:52] foundation of the word it is a word
[1:36:55] there that we
[1:36:57] skipped amen it's talking about the
[1:36:59] theop body that we skipped to come right
[1:37:02] around down here to be tempted and
[1:37:04] tested if we have come through that he
[1:37:09] there had been no temptation we know all
[1:37:12] things that's the reason Jesus know all
[1:37:15] things because he was wor before he was
[1:37:17] flesh then we become the
[1:37:20] word amen he said here we we are formed
[1:37:24] to the word image to be a partaker of
[1:37:28] the word am feed on the word by being
[1:37:32] predestinated since the beginning you
[1:37:35] see that little spark of life that you
[1:37:37] had in you from the beginning when you
[1:37:40] started your journey many of you can
[1:37:42] remember it you join this church and
[1:37:44] joined that church you tried this and
[1:37:47] that nothing satisfied that's right but
[1:37:50] one day you just recognized it right
[1:37:52] amen amen amen so when the prophet is
[1:37:57] saying that we have been formed to the
[1:38:00] word image to be a partaker of the word
[1:38:03] yes sir that is why a child of God
[1:38:07] cannot separate himself from the
[1:38:11] word amen the word has to be a partner
[1:38:16] to a child of God wherever the child of
[1:38:19] God is going the word of God is
[1:38:21] following wherever he's going he's
[1:38:24] moving with the word of God because we
[1:38:26] are being partakers of the
[1:38:29] word
[1:38:31] amen sir this is seeking after Jesus he
[1:38:33] said now a man that's born of the spirit
[1:38:36] of God a man then becomes in the image
[1:38:41] of God inwardly yes sir
[1:38:44] amen so there is a God inside of
[1:38:49] you that is when you are born of the
[1:38:52] spirit of God yes
[1:38:54] amen God when he made this world he just
[1:38:58] spoke the word he had nothing else to do
[1:39:01] nothing else to make it out of he just
[1:39:02] spoke it into existence the word was
[1:39:05] made by the word of God God spoke the
[1:39:07] word said let there be and it be began
[1:39:10] to materialize and the very
[1:39:13] ground that you said over tonight is the
[1:39:16] word of God materialized amen did you
[1:39:18] know that amen God just said let there
[1:39:21] be and it was he believed own word then
[1:39:24] he's almighty God and if he's always God
[1:39:27] and if he's almighty God he can do all
[1:39:30] things amen and if he cannot do all
[1:39:33] things he isn't almighty God and if the
[1:39:36] scripture tells us that he's the same
[1:39:38] yesterday today and forever
[1:39:41] amen now in this message the uncertain
[1:39:44] sound amen we don't have no more
[1:39:46] security of the
[1:39:47] home says send your children to school
[1:39:51] what do they teach them out there many
[1:39:53] times too many times they teach them we
[1:39:56] come from
[1:39:58] apes well we don't believe
[1:40:01] that amen he said no and if a man no
[1:40:05] more than an animal then eat drink and
[1:40:08] be merry amen that's what makes so many
[1:40:11] juvenile delinquent amen that's what
[1:40:13] makes so many crimes committed because
[1:40:16] if People's know more than an animal it
[1:40:18] makes him act like an animal that's
[1:40:20] right amen so when you are making
[1:40:22] somebody look like you're animal you're
[1:40:26] Beast you're this you're that you're
[1:40:29] sinful that what do you expect from the
[1:40:32] person that is why the spirit of God
[1:40:35] comes to you and makes you understand
[1:40:38] that you have two
[1:40:39] parts even if you seeing an animal likee
[1:40:43] behavior amen there is a Divine part in
[1:40:47] you amen it depends on what you're
[1:40:51] activating amen and that is what is
[1:40:53] going to bring the result amen he said
[1:40:56] we go to tell him he's a Son of God born
[1:40:59] for the kingdom of God and he's somebody
[1:41:03] this is just a negative a picture
[1:41:07] negative waiting for it to be developed
[1:41:11] Sunday and death is the only thing that
[1:41:14] can develop it when you die out to
[1:41:18] yourself a new picture start on the
[1:41:22] inside
[1:41:24] and then that new creature amen Christ
[1:41:28] Jesus begin to show itself
[1:41:33] through
[1:41:34] amen so when this
[1:41:38] negative is
[1:41:42] developed when this
[1:41:44] negative is
[1:41:46] developed amen Christ is saying a new
[1:41:51] picture starts on the
[1:41:54] inside a new one starts on the
[1:41:57] inside
[1:41:59] amen I'm going to move to this uh this
[1:42:02] message the voice of the sign it said
[1:42:05] there is only one form of eternal life
[1:42:08] if you've got eternal life then you
[1:42:11] yourself was in God's thinking before
[1:42:14] the world was
[1:42:15] created you are an attribute of his
[1:42:18] thinking cuz Eternal never did begin or
[1:42:22] never end we never did begin will will
[1:42:26] never end talking about the inside man
[1:42:29] you are a part of God's economy always
[1:42:32] it's just reflecting it's becoming now
[1:42:36] they got one more picture to develop
[1:42:39] that is death then the negative becomes
[1:42:44] positive then you are in the bright and
[1:42:47] with Christ as he taught like husband
[1:42:51] and wife today so God Christ and the
[1:42:54] church will be the
[1:42:58] same amen so when that negative is
[1:43:03] developed to a positive the prophet is
[1:43:06] saying that we God and Christ we become
[1:43:11] the same it said now the that's why we
[1:43:14] are called the
[1:43:15] elected
[1:43:18] amen now the prophet said that
[1:43:23] we can't see from AAR or the the vision
[1:43:26] is D because there's no Divine
[1:43:30] Joy amen now we read job 17 verse
[1:43:37] 7 if you can take job 17 verse 7
[1:43:57] job 17:7 yes sir it said my eye also is
[1:44:02] deemed by reason of Sorrow that's right
[1:44:06] and all my members are as a shadow right
[1:44:10] so job is saying his eye is dim because
[1:44:14] of Sorrow right so when your eyes are
[1:44:17] deam you can see from a far off you can
[1:44:20] see the picture that is ahead of you
[1:44:23] and the prophet said we've lost Divine
[1:44:27] Joy
[1:44:29] amen and that makes the vision door we
[1:44:34] can't see from afar the vision is door
[1:44:36] because there's no Divine Joy there is
[1:44:39] sorrow in our lives amen that bless the
[1:44:43] picture amen that is
[1:44:49] why God said in second Timothy 1 1:
[1:44:54] 7 amen 2 Timothy 1 ver
[1:45:06] 7 yes sir second
[1:45:09] timo1 amen verse 7 amen it said Desiring
[1:45:15] to
[1:45:16] be oh
[1:45:19] just second Timothy 1:7 yeah it said for
[1:45:22] God have not given us the spirit of fear
[1:45:27] but of power and of love and of a sound
[1:45:33] mind amen now A sound mind amen makes
[1:45:39] makes us think
[1:45:41] differently amen A sound mind makes us
[1:45:45] think differently makes us look at the
[1:45:49] picture differently as how other people
[1:45:52] are looking at it amen now in
[1:45:56] Philippians
[1:45:57] 2:56 said that we have been giv that
[1:46:02] mind of Christ let let's just read
[1:46:05] Philippians
[1:46:08] 256 Philippians
[1:46:17] 256 Philippians 2:56 said let this mind
[1:46:21] be in you amen which was also in Christ
[1:46:24] Jesus who being in the form of God T it
[1:46:27] not robbery to be equal with God amen
[1:46:30] amen so we have been given a mind to
[1:46:33] think like
[1:46:35] Christ
[1:46:37] amen to look at things amen as how
[1:46:41] Christ looked at things amen amen amen
[1:46:44] so he didn't think it Rob robbery to be
[1:46:48] equal with God cuz there's a Divine part
[1:46:52] in Christ amen amen so he's he's given
[1:46:56] us that same mind to think that way amen
[1:47:01] so in the message show us the father
[1:47:03] said and then when Jesus Christ spoke
[1:47:06] this word I'm reading this um um quote
[1:47:09] again they never die science claims in
[1:47:12] 20 years from now they can pick up the
[1:47:14] literal voice they'll be able to pick up
[1:47:17] the literal voice of Jesus is still in
[1:47:19] the earth C see it's a sending post you
[1:47:23] are then there has to be a receiving
[1:47:25] post and if you can be the receptacle
[1:47:28] see receiving post to receive the word
[1:47:31] of God then it's real to you and it will
[1:47:34] live just like it was then amen amen so
[1:47:39] when we have that same mind of Christ
[1:47:42] and thinking as Christ Tau yes sir
[1:47:46] whatever we do or whatever we say Amen
[1:47:51] we must have that same mind as Christ
[1:47:54] did amen amen
[1:47:57] amen now in in the message the calling
[1:48:00] of Abraham but that's it friend see we
[1:48:02] have a sending station that's Heaven
[1:48:05] we've got a receiving station that's
[1:48:08] your
[1:48:09] heart so I'm back to um as sending a
[1:48:12] receiving post
[1:48:14] amen now there's a sending station from
[1:48:16] Heaven the word of God speaks something
[1:48:20] right amen and the prophet said there
[1:48:22] has to be a receiving station that's
[1:48:24] right that is in your heart yes sir amen
[1:48:27] so there's a sending there's a receiving
[1:48:29] amen now when you receive the word of
[1:48:32] God as we said the one who sent the word
[1:48:36] must interpret exactly what is saying
[1:48:39] that's exactly so that you receiving
[1:48:41] will be on the same line as the one
[1:48:44] sending that's exactly right amen that
[1:48:48] is where the Prophet said that when we
[1:48:51] misunder stand the message we get into
[1:48:55] trouble that is why we don't need a
[1:48:58] third party to come inside to wrongly
[1:49:01] interpret what the sender is given so
[1:49:05] when God send something amen it takes he
[1:49:09] himself to interpret because it is
[1:49:12] coming to a receiving station amen now
[1:49:16] when Christ was moving when Christ was
[1:49:19] doing anything as we heard from um last
[1:49:22] Wednesday
[1:49:23] Christ didn't do anything except he saw
[1:49:25] the vision from the father amen so when
[1:49:29] the father send a vision then Christ
[1:49:31] moves to do it and this same mind that
[1:49:35] was in Christ must be in you a child of
[1:49:37] God so when God send something and it
[1:49:41] falls down in your heart it means you
[1:49:44] are also sending exactly what God is
[1:49:48] given to you and when you are repeating
[1:49:51] that you are receiving exactly what God
[1:49:55] is sending that's exactly right amen
[1:49:58] amen I'm just trying to um go very fast
[1:50:02] amen
[1:50:03] sir now this is God's covenant with
[1:50:06] Abraham it
[1:50:07] said um paragraph 28 say believe it no
[1:50:11] matter what takes place believe it
[1:50:13] anyhow you see Christians don't look at
[1:50:16] what they see Christians look at things
[1:50:19] they don't see and the things you don't
[1:50:21] see are more real than the things that
[1:50:23] you see you see that microphone it will
[1:50:27] perish this one I see faith that will
[1:50:31] never perish see I I see love joy peace
[1:50:36] longsuffering goodness meekness
[1:50:38] gentleness patience those ones we don't
[1:50:42] see amen every Shield of the believer is
[1:50:45] Supernatural everything that belongs in
[1:50:48] the realm of Christianity is worked by
[1:50:51] Supernatural and anything this one said
[1:50:53] to me he said anything that can be
[1:50:55] scientifically proven isn't real I said
[1:50:58] anything that can be scientifically
[1:50:59] proven isn't real that's vice versa he
[1:51:03] said there's something wrong with
[1:51:06] you ah yeah I got saved that's what's
[1:51:09] wrong the the prophet said that I got
[1:51:11] saved that's what is wrong he said and
[1:51:13] he said oh look he said I said now you
[1:51:15] are here you are looking at television
[1:51:18] you was trying to sell me he said I said
[1:51:21] that's wonderful I said you see there's
[1:51:23] something that's Supernatural that
[1:51:26] picture is coming through us it hits
[1:51:29] that screen right amen so the prophet is
[1:51:32] saying that when you see a television
[1:51:35] amen there is a sending post that's
[1:51:38] right amen from somewhere and then the
[1:51:40] television is receiving amen he said oh
[1:51:44] yes but said that's easy said we've got
[1:51:47] a sending station and a receiving
[1:51:48] station I said so have we amen that's
[1:51:52] right we got a sending station and
[1:51:54] receiving station suddenly just tune all
[1:51:57] the static amen the unbelief out and
[1:52:00] watch what takes place watch the picture
[1:52:03] clear then you say oh yes Lord I see now
[1:52:07] that makes the difference it depends on
[1:52:09] how much stalic you let get in am amen
[1:52:14] yes
[1:52:16] now what is an interpretation amen when
[1:52:20] somebody gives a word right or somebody
[1:52:23] say
[1:52:24] something we can interpret it by words
[1:52:28] say brother said said his giving brother
[1:52:31] Freddy
[1:52:32] $1,000 amen so somebody can say okay
[1:52:35] that's what brother set said we can also
[1:52:38] interpret that by
[1:52:42] performance action so when I take the
[1:52:46] money and give it to brother Freddy it
[1:52:49] means there's an interpretation of that
[1:52:53] so there has to be a performance amen so
[1:52:56] another expression or another
[1:52:59] understanding of interpretation is
[1:53:01] performance so God is his own
[1:53:06] performing um if if I put it a
[1:53:08] performing unit amen or God performs his
[1:53:12] own
[1:53:13] word amen so when God has given a
[1:53:16] promise he's the same person who comes
[1:53:18] to perform so that's to interpret the
[1:53:22] word to you you amen because when I say
[1:53:24] it by word form only and there's no
[1:53:27] action you don't really get the
[1:53:29] picture amen amen amen
[1:53:33] amen now I take this quote again I I
[1:53:37] believe it was read um so few weeks back
[1:53:39] he said now if you notice what caused
[1:53:43] this great thing in the beginning God
[1:53:45] took man for a
[1:53:47] partner and he made a covenant with a
[1:53:50] man equal
[1:53:53] and told a man if you shall do this and
[1:53:55] do and not do this and the man broke his
[1:53:59] Covenant yes and he always breaks his
[1:54:02] Covenant
[1:54:04] now the prophet is saying that there was
[1:54:08] a covenant between man and God and he
[1:54:11] said it's an equal Covenant now there's
[1:54:14] one one
[1:54:17] um Covenant type we call parity
[1:54:21] Covenant where both parties have equal
[1:54:25] responsibilities and equal
[1:54:28] rights Amen to whatever thing that you
[1:54:32] have to the assets that you have amen so
[1:54:35] one party and the second party goes into
[1:54:38] an agreement and we call it a parity
[1:54:40] Covenant so we are equal yes sir amen so
[1:54:45] God gives us that Covenant amen so
[1:54:48] whatever God is doing he's trying to
[1:54:51] tell man that man you are also capable
[1:54:54] of doing
[1:54:56] that amen I'm trying to skip this
[1:55:00] amen now talking about
[1:55:06] interpretation this brings my mind to um
[1:55:09] that old Vin that was um brought out for
[1:55:12] auction amen and then they were trying
[1:55:15] to put a price on it until they got to a
[1:55:18] dollar amen and then one person got out
[1:55:22] and then said I don't think this violin
[1:55:25] is for $1 amen so he takes a violin and
[1:55:29] starts to play beautifully and then the
[1:55:31] price of the violin went up
[1:55:34] amen so we can be in a state Amen in a
[1:55:40] human nature till we get to that point
[1:55:43] where we devalue ourselves that's right
[1:55:47] amen but it takes God to come and take
[1:55:52] this body and play it right to prove
[1:55:56] exactly the value that we have amen
[1:55:59] because inside of us amen is the divine
[1:56:03] nature is the god nature he's given to
[1:56:06] us amen
[1:56:10] amen
[1:56:12] now in Mark 11 I'm trying to skip I'm
[1:56:16] trying to go faster in Mark 11 20- 24
[1:56:21] amen
[1:56:22] let's just take this uh Mark
[1:56:29] 11224
[1:56:31] Hallelujah Mark 11
[1:56:37] 2024 Mark 11:
[1:56:40] 20-24
[1:56:43] amen now this is where
[1:56:47] Jesus had an encounter with the Fig Tree
[1:56:50] he came he was hungry saw the the Fig
[1:56:52] Tree and then the Fig Tree didn't have
[1:56:54] fruit amen and then he cured the Fig
[1:56:57] Tree amen we all know that story amen
[1:57:00] and then the following morning when they
[1:57:03] were were they were walking by the Fig
[1:57:05] Tree the disciples told him that Master
[1:57:07] the fig tree that you had casted um
[1:57:10] yesterday we we see that it is dying
[1:57:13] amen amen
[1:57:17] now when Jesus talked to the fig tree
[1:57:21] uhhuh
[1:57:22] amen he had to
[1:57:27] connect to the Fig Tree by the
[1:57:30] root
[1:57:32] amen now there is one thing called a
[1:57:36] master Seed
[1:57:39] Faith it is a little kind of Faith we're
[1:57:42] going to get into that it's a little
[1:57:44] kind of faith that that uh we all know
[1:57:48] grows to a tree right amen right
[1:57:52] it is a little fi from the beginning but
[1:57:55] it grows through a tree amen now when
[1:57:58] Christ saw this F tree and he cursed it
[1:58:03] he just talked to it and then left amen
[1:58:06] now the following day they come to see
[1:58:09] that it was dying from the root
[1:58:13] right let me just read
[1:58:18] this so this from the message God being
[1:58:21] misunderstood again he said there's a
[1:58:22] question that um a brother sent to
[1:58:25] brother Braham he said brother Braham I
[1:58:28] am saved and have been baptized in the
[1:58:30] name of Jesus Christ but how do I get
[1:58:33] away from a stubborn spirit that I can't
[1:58:36] seem to break away he said well my
[1:58:39] Christian brother or sister whoever it
[1:58:42] may be now most times when you find
[1:58:45] people that's got stubborn Spirits is
[1:58:48] usually a complex that crosses this
[1:58:51] either they have inherited from a mother
[1:58:54] father uncle aunt or grandmother
[1:58:56] grandfather somebody like that and if
[1:58:59] you trace back down through your life
[1:59:02] you find now I've taken this by
[1:59:05] experience amen but brah is saying
[1:59:08] that so many times when he goes to meet
[1:59:12] people with stubborn spirit is just
[1:59:13] trying to um just trying to go through
[1:59:16] this amen he's saying that through
[1:59:20] discernment he could trace the root to
[1:59:23] either the grandfather or the
[1:59:24] grandmother the uncle or anything like
[1:59:26] that
[1:59:27] amen so brother Braham is saying that
[1:59:30] with this amen with this stubbornness it
[1:59:34] said stubbornness is not of God and now
[1:59:37] the only way to get away from this is
[1:59:39] you have to have faith to overcome that
[1:59:43] you a Christian you're a son or a
[1:59:45] daughter of God
[1:59:47] whichever whichever you may be and you
[1:59:50] will never be able to to
[1:59:52] find able just to stand and rebuke it
[1:59:56] and rebuke it and rebuke so the prophet
[1:59:57] is saying that with stubborn Spirits
[2:00:00] amen you can't stand before it rebuke
[2:00:03] rebuke rebuke it said the way you
[2:00:06] overcome the stubborn spirit amen is by
[2:00:10] faith because it is linked to a
[2:00:13] grandfather or a grandmother or
[2:00:16] something amen
[2:00:19] so linking it to Jesus Christ at the Fig
[2:00:23] Tree there are some
[2:00:26] situations which have Roots
[2:00:29] right like a stubborn spirit is going
[2:00:33] root to the ground that's right so what
[2:00:36] did Christ do he just spoke to it and
[2:00:41] left so brother BR is saying that in a
[2:00:45] way to overcome a stubborn Spirit
[2:00:48] connect to connect to Faith and leave it
[2:00:51] alone yes
[2:00:53] sir amen yes sir so I believe no amount
[2:00:58] of stubborn Spirit no matter how linked
[2:01:02] it is to any Source no matter how the
[2:01:06] lineage is amen it can't overcome the
[2:01:11] power of
[2:01:13] faith and Bram said that speak to it and
[2:01:17] leave it alone so when we see the
[2:01:20] victory it's it started to die from the
[2:01:25] root so when you are not seen that thing
[2:01:28] go away it doesn't mean that it is not
[2:01:32] being taken
[2:01:33] away so brother Brown said resist the
[2:01:36] devil and flee away from you by faith we
[2:01:40] overcome that amen so I believe tonight
[2:01:44] no matter the stubborn Spirit no matter
[2:01:48] how link it is to any lineage right amen
[2:01:52] it can have power over the
[2:01:56] believer amen so in this all said did
[2:02:00] you hear him say if you got faith the
[2:02:03] size of a master seed he said a master
[2:02:06] Seed Faith W perform a
[2:02:12] miracle a master SE faith will perform a
[2:02:15] miracle so we understand that we have
[2:02:19] Divine Healing and miracle healing
[2:02:22] that's
[2:02:23] right amen so the prophet is saying that
[2:02:27] with miracle healing as we all
[2:02:29] understand you pray for it and instantly
[2:02:31] it goes off but Divine Healing it takes
[2:02:34] a while so the prophet is saying the
[2:02:36] master Seed Faith won't perform a
[2:02:40] miracle but if you hold to it it will
[2:02:44] bring you
[2:02:46] out amen just anchor it that's
[2:02:50] it so message tonight is if there is a
[2:02:54] stubborn spirit that is linked to any
[2:02:58] channel amen any lineage we hold on to
[2:03:02] the master Seed Faith we speak to it
[2:03:05] amen and leave it alone amen regardless
[2:03:09] of how little the faith is it is
[2:03:13] powerful enough to overcome it
[2:03:16] amen amen amen amen I'm just trying to
[2:03:22] skip this and read my last quote amen it
[2:03:26] said the promise is yours I'm closing
[2:03:31] the promise is yours but if you ever get
[2:03:35] it you ain't going to get it easy I'm
[2:03:38] going to tell you that you're going to
[2:03:41] have to take it away from Satan Satan
[2:03:44] captures your health you've got a right
[2:03:48] to go to Satan say give it back
[2:03:52] took my child you got her mixed up with
[2:03:55] the wrong boy you took my boy and mixed
[2:03:59] up with the wrong girl I claim them
[2:04:02] that's right I claim my children I claim
[2:04:05] my brother I claim my sister yes Satan
[2:04:09] you've took them from God's House Co
[2:04:12] them out there but I'm coming after them
[2:04:14] I claim them well how you know I'm an
[2:04:18] heir of all things amen it's given to me
[2:04:22] I'm an heir I can claim everything that
[2:04:24] God promised me amen there you are it's
[2:04:27] mine how do you get it something you
[2:04:30] done no sir it's the unmerited gift that
[2:04:34] God gave us and it's ours it belongs to
[2:04:38] us Satan cannot hold it if you go to him
[2:04:42] in the scripture authoritative word with
[2:04:45] faith to say it's mine lay it down amen
[2:04:49] glory I like that amen and amen let's
[2:04:53] give the Lord a hand of Amen tonight
[2:04:57] amen amen amen so let's be up standing
[2:05:01] amen even as we invite brother Steven
[2:05:04] Amen to take over the ppit amen
[2:05:08] amen
[2:05:13] amen
[2:05:18] amen praise God Amen
[2:05:22] wonderful wonderful wonderful
[2:05:25] wonderful he's a lot of deep
[2:05:28] teaching that went through there amen
[2:05:31] but remember God is his own interpreter
[2:05:36] amen amen
[2:05:39] misunderstanding causes a lot of trouble
[2:05:42] and the example is very clear he told
[2:05:45] Brother Freddy I'm going to give you a
[2:05:48] $1,000 he didn't tell you how he's going
[2:05:51] to give him maybe it's a Zeal maybe it's
[2:05:54] a money order maybe it's a bank transfer
[2:05:57] maybe it's cash or maybe it's a check we
[2:06:00] the one trying to figure it out what it
[2:06:03] is when God have not said anything if
[2:06:06] you don't understand you need to ask God
[2:06:08] himself but when God speak his V his uh
[2:06:11] his word will never return to him void
[2:06:14] until he have fulfilled that which God
[2:06:17] send it for amen and the only way to
[2:06:20] receive God word you must have God on
[2:06:22] your
[2:06:23] inside are we together amen so that God
[2:06:28] can hear God because only God can
[2:06:31] interpret God Amen there is a sending
[2:06:35] post from Heaven that's God and there is
[2:06:38] a receiving post that is in your heart
[2:06:42] that heart it means the soul amen the
[2:06:46] soul is a receiving post the soul is not
[2:06:51] your brain
[2:06:52] no amen if you want to know whether you
[2:06:55] receive something in your heart versus
[2:06:57] your head watch if you reason with
[2:07:02] it I don't know if I'm helping somebody
[2:07:05] tonight if God speaks something amen
[2:07:09] watch your
[2:07:10] reaction if you reason with it just know
[2:07:13] he have landed in your
[2:07:15] brain are we together if he land in your
[2:07:19] heart the heart only say I believe it
[2:07:23] and their heart does not reason brother
[2:07:26] Bram compar that to a television are we
[2:07:30] together if you take a television post
[2:07:32] and you turn it on yeah the television
[2:07:35] cannot answer you
[2:07:37] anything the television only

[2:07:43] you ask the television why are you
[2:07:45] showing this the television have no
[2:07:47] answer the television will only reflect
[2:07:50] what you tune the television too and God
[2:07:53] design these are laws of the souls God
[2:07:56] designed the souls of men so that the
[2:07:59] soul doesn't have the ability to
[2:08:02] reason the soul only pick up
[2:08:06] something are we together yes sir and
[2:08:08] then reflects it that's why brother
[2:08:11] brandham say everything that God lead
[2:08:15] your soul to
[2:08:17] believe not to reason yes sir you will
[2:08:20] feel in your heart like something is
[2:08:22] telling you that I am entitled
[2:08:26] something if they ask you why you don't
[2:08:29] know how to explain it you don't even
[2:08:31] know how to say it but there is a
[2:08:33] conviction in you that one of these day
[2:08:36] I will be living Closer by day you don't
[2:08:39] know why it's coming you don't know
[2:08:41] where they thought is coming but
[2:08:43] something in you keep telling you that
[2:08:45] you know what one of these day I will
[2:08:47] travel to such and such and that's
[2:08:49] exactly something that is coming from
[2:08:51] the of the Soul amen if they ask you a
[2:08:54] question there is no way you can explain
[2:08:55] it because the soul does not reason the
[2:08:58] soul was meant to receive something from
[2:09:01] God and just
[2:09:04] become what he just received sir amen
[2:09:08] because the Brin will reason and God
[2:09:10] doesn't
[2:09:12] reason amen I don't know if you're
[2:09:14] getting what I'm saying amen your
[2:09:17] receiving post is not your head your
[2:09:20] receiving post is your heart yes sir
[2:09:22] amen when it ring in your heart and you
[2:09:25] receive it no matter the obstacle just
[2:09:29] take what your heart say you hear people
[2:09:32] saying listen to your heart amen listen
[2:09:35] to the god that is in your heart when he
[2:09:37] says that just take that and put it
[2:09:41] against whatever situation it is and
[2:09:43] leave it alone amen it might take a
[2:09:46] while but you will see for some reason
[2:09:49] somehow in an next expected way your
[2:09:53] solution will come to pass amen you are
[2:09:56] a receiving post the only way you are
[2:10:00] sending to God a uh uh uh a vibration
[2:10:05] back that you receive what he say is by
[2:10:09] believing it yes sir when you believe it
[2:10:11] it's telling Heaven that somebody have
[2:10:14] just received the message right amen
[2:10:17] then heaven will back you up yes sir are
[2:10:20] we together amen these laws are very
[2:10:24] simple if you want to see Big Miracle
[2:10:27] they're very simple amen the Pentecostal
[2:10:31] R put us to a lot of pressure a lot of
[2:10:35] man working stuff and fabricating
[2:10:39] manufacturing Miracle until we begin to
[2:10:41] try to push people to make people to
[2:10:44] fall on the ground and you will see
[2:10:45] Pentecost until the person fell on the
[2:10:48] ground and the person fell on the ground
[2:10:49] and woke up and nothing happened because
[2:10:51] it's coming from the work of men too
[2:10:53] much exercise amen you don't need muscle
[2:10:57] exercise you need to exercise your heart
[2:11:01] your faith in your soul and let the
[2:11:03] faith exercise because the faith is the
[2:11:05] only thing that can do it amen Adam
[2:11:09] bypass the
[2:11:10] theophany we also bypass the theophany
[2:11:14] amen he bypassed the theophany brother
[2:11:17] Bram say at the beginning God created
[2:11:19] him in a theophany and God took him away
[2:11:22] from the theophany and put him in the
[2:11:24] flesh that's when he bypass it are we
[2:11:27] together sir then when he bypassed he
[2:11:30] was not different than me and you that's
[2:11:33] the reason why he could die are we
[2:11:36] together yes sir but whatever Jesus did
[2:11:39] if you follow brother brandham through
[2:11:41] brother brandham always repeat over and
[2:11:44] over that Jesus restore us back
[2:11:47] to he doesn't say restore us back to you
[2:11:51] to
[2:11:53] him yes sir you didn't get
[2:11:57] that you didn't get that you didn't get
[2:12:01] that every race that is on Earth came
[2:12:05] from Adam yes sir the Bible say we came
[2:12:07] from one blood it is from Adam amen and
[2:12:11] by representation all of us of we were
[2:12:15] represented in Adam that's why whatever
[2:12:17] happened in Adam is coming straight here
[2:12:20] but Adam
[2:12:21] bypass his theophany Jesus did not
[2:12:26] bypass his theophany so Jesus cannot
[2:12:29] bring you back to
[2:12:35] him can I repeat it again you want me to
[2:12:38] repeat it again amen Jesus came with his
[2:12:42] theophany he was the word made flesh so
[2:12:47] if Jesus restore us back to him we must
[2:12:50] be the word made flesh but we don't have
[2:12:53] a offing so Jesus restoring us back not
[2:12:57] to him but back to Adam that's why
[2:13:00] brother brandham keep saying we are back
[2:13:02] to Adam when before the fall because in
[2:13:05] Adam you can find a man that doesn't
[2:13:08] have a theophany but he's living like a
[2:13:11] God and he's a God on the earth
[2:13:14] yes because the Satan will tell you you
[2:13:17] don't have a
[2:13:19] t so Jesus was doing Mir Miracle because
[2:13:21] he has a theophany so you better shut up
[2:13:24] because you wait till the day of the
[2:13:25] Rapture then when you're going to have
[2:13:27] your theophany you can perform Miracle
[2:13:30] that's what the devil will tell you and
[2:13:32] you will be like yeah yeah yeah brother
[2:13:34] Bram say we will get our theop when the
[2:13:36] Rapture come Jesus restore you not to
[2:13:38] him he restore you back to Adam because
[2:13:41] in Adam you say Satan Adam bypass his
[2:13:43] thean so how how why didn't you go to
[2:13:47] him and talk to him why did you go to
[2:13:49] his wife because you knew exactly what
[2:13:52] he was without aop he knew how to handle
[2:13:55] you so God is restoring us back to Adam
[2:13:59] before the fall to tell you that right
[2:14:02] the way you are you can do the greater
[2:14:05] work amen greater greater work let's
