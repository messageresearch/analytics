[56:37] thank you
[56:39] magicians very good singing very good
[56:42] music
[56:45] playing I would like to greet my
[56:47] precious Brothers and Sisters in Christ
[56:52] tonight I would like to give thanks to
[56:54] brother Sten you know from the in the
[56:57] Lord for entrusting me with a full
[57:00] sermon um I believe that uh the Lord
[57:03] will not
[57:04] disappoint um because it's not me to
[57:07] begin
[57:08] with
[57:10] um before I start I would like to
[57:14] glorify the Lord even more by saying
[57:17] that uh what the Lord was showing
[57:21] me for
[57:23] today um around last week Monday when
[57:27] brother uh Timothy aong um ministered it
[57:33] kind of was in line and then Sunday the
[57:37] Lord kind of put a stamp on it with with
[57:39] a bullseye so I know I'm in the I'm in
[57:42] the line of duty I know uh the Lord is
[57:44] behind this so
[57:47] um as you open your Bibles take our
[57:51] reading um I would like to go to
[57:54] Revelations 9 verse
[57:57] uh this came from uh inspiration from uh
[58:00] demonology number two um because I was
[58:04] uh as I was listening uh to demonology
[58:08] number one where the Aaron preached and
[58:11] then I was like okay and then uh you
[58:14] know because we know that you know
[58:15] there's 200 million demons that are
[58:18] released right and I said okay there's
[58:21] 200 million demons but I know there's
[58:22] not 200 million diseases so the demons
[58:25] are somewhere else you know where are
[58:27] they you know there's more demons out
[58:28] there so um so I started uh searching my
[58:32] scriptures and the Lord was rilling it
[58:33] on to me and um I like to read
[58:37] Revelations 9
[58:39] verse6 uh so it reads the number of the
[58:42] army of the horsemen were 200,000,000
[58:45] and I heard the number of
[58:48] them um see so with 200,000,000 so this
[58:54] is why you know it's good to in school
[58:57] you know your numerical placeholders
[58:59] because it's 200 so it's
[59:02] 20 200,000 so that's two
[59:06] z0000 z, extra z00 Z so that's 200
[59:11] million that's how you get the re re
[59:13] revelation of it see so now go to uh
[59:15] Matthew
[59:20] 24:24 when you get there say
[59:24] Amen all right um it it reads for there
[59:28] for there shall arise false Christ and
[59:31] false prophets and shall show great
[59:34] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[59:36] were possible they shall deceive the
[59:39] very elect that's why I would like to
[59:41] take my uh title as as of if it were
[59:45] possible okay um so as we um bow our
[59:48] heads in prayer put God
[59:51] first Lord God we come unto you humbly
[59:53] father God Jesus Christ Our God the
[59:56] beginning the end father God the author

[1:01:13] Christ's name we pray father amen right
[1:01:16] be
[1:01:17] seated all right um so I would like to
[1:01:21] read um this this uh excerpt from uh
[1:01:26] brother brandom this
[1:01:28] 64719 in the morning the Feast of the
[1:01:30] trumpets it's talking about those 200
[1:01:33] million demons okay so it says um notice
[1:01:36] 200 million he said 200,000 demons but
[1:01:39] you see it's just like the 144,000 still
[1:01:42] you know what he was saying you CAU the
[1:01:43] Revelation see so it says uh turn loose
[1:01:46] upon those Jews see so that's where they
[1:01:48] were I believe we went over that in the
[1:01:50] hotel it says um then I skipped down on
[1:01:53] 75 what has it done in the com as he
[1:01:56] said he'd come in like
[1:01:59] flatteries and what has he done bringing
[1:02:02] the Protestant economical Council of the
[1:02:04] world
[1:02:06] churches the spirit of the Antichrist
[1:02:08] upon both of them bringing them to the
[1:02:10] slaughter just like they did the other
[1:02:11] in the hour to call the bride how loose
[1:02:14] in the ecclesiastical Church Spirit
[1:02:17] loose upon what not upon denominations
[1:02:20] upon the bride see so um then I would
[1:02:23] like to go down to uh Christ is the
[1:02:25] Myster of God revealed in 63 says think
[1:02:27] of it holy men couldn't put your finger
[1:02:29] nowhere on their life the father's life
[1:02:31] grandfather's life or the great great
[1:02:33] great great great grandfather's lives if
[1:02:35] they did they died in shame they were
[1:02:36] stoned to death see so um and then I
[1:02:40] would like to read the scripture that
[1:02:41] the Lord brought to me after this
[1:02:43] because um I'm bringing you to a thought
[1:02:45] and I pray the Lord allows me to to
[1:02:47] bring you to the thought okay so second
[1:02:49] Peter so you don't have to go to them um
[1:02:52] uh if you you can if you want to but I
[1:02:53] have all the scriptures right here just
[1:02:55] I'm saying so you know what I'm reading
[1:02:57] uh second Peter 2 1-2 but there shall
[1:03:01] arise false prophets among the people
[1:03:03] and and there shall be false teachers
[1:03:05] among you see and then I'mma drop down
[1:03:07] too it says many shall follow their
[1:03:10] pernicious ways see every time a big
[1:03:13] word pops up in the scriptures I like to
[1:03:14] look at it because usually it's pretty
[1:03:16] common speech but when that's put in
[1:03:18] there putting there for a reason see it
[1:03:20] says pricious means having a harmful
[1:03:22] effect in a gradual way see so at first
[1:03:25] first happens it's not going to see if
[1:03:28] you give Satan an inch it'll take a mile
[1:03:30] so he comes in real real slight see so
[1:03:33] it says uh 2 Corinthians 11: 2-4 see
[1:03:36] because so it says for I am jealous over
[1:03:38] you with a Godly jealousy for I've
[1:03:40] espouse you to one husband see I'm going
[1:03:42] present you a Chase version of Christ
[1:03:44] but I fear lest by any means as a spirit
[1:03:47] as a serpent begal Eve through his
[1:03:49] subtlety so your mind should be
[1:03:50] corrupted in the Simplicity that is in
[1:03:52] Christ for if he that cometh preaches to
[1:03:54] another Jesus whom we have not preached
[1:03:56] or received another Spirit we have not
[1:03:59] received another or another gospel who
[1:04:01] we have not accepted see and I would
[1:04:04] like to um parallel this with brother
[1:04:06] brandham because brother brandham said
[1:04:07] the exact same thing see he said I'm
[1:04:09] here to try to help you because I love
[1:04:11] you you're my children that have gotten
[1:04:12] to Christ I claim every one of you I
[1:04:14] claim you tonight see and he goes on
[1:04:17] down and he says um um I espouse you to
[1:04:20] Christ gave you to Christ as a chased
[1:04:22] virgin see see I'm I'm I'm trying to get
[1:04:24] you to a thought see spous the Christ as
[1:04:27] a Chase version see um now go to
[1:04:29] Galatians 1 6-8 ver10 see what was that
[1:04:33] other Jesus see because because if it
[1:04:36] verse six reads I Marvel that you are so
[1:04:38] soon removed from him that called you
[1:04:39] into the grace of Christ into another
[1:04:41] gospel which is not another so it's not
[1:04:45] another gospel it's not another they're
[1:04:48] not calling it something else they
[1:04:49] they're still saying Jesus but but it's
[1:04:52] in the it's not Jesus it's not that it's
[1:04:56] the old shoe bread it's the dead word
[1:04:58] it's not the revealed word it's not the
[1:05:00] fesh shoe bread that that that's in the
[1:05:02] in the in in the Tabernacle that's every
[1:05:05] every Sabbath is is refreshed see um it
[1:05:08] says um now he see it's a subtle demon
[1:05:11] see because it says Galatians 5 7-9 says
[1:05:14] you did run well who did hinder that you
[1:05:16] should not obey the truth this
[1:05:18] persuasion that's another way saying
[1:05:20] subtlety see that Satan right there see
[1:05:23] cometh not of him that calleth you the
[1:05:25] le le the whole lump see so
[1:05:32] um okay um in 1 Corinthians 5 6-12 see
[1:05:38] because this is following the little 11
[1:05:39] see um your glorying is not good know
[1:05:42] you not the live 11 little 11 leth the
[1:05:45] whole lump right see oh because uh what
[1:05:48] does that mean glorifying is not good
[1:05:51] see it says therefore let see that's 1
[1:05:53] Corinthians 3:21 therefore let no let no
[1:05:57] man glory in men for all things are
[1:06:00] yours see so stop don't look at the man
[1:06:04] see having a form of godliness but
[1:06:06] denying the power thereof see that's the
[1:06:08] false anointed ones in the end times
[1:06:10] just uh but denying the power that's
[1:06:12] denying Jesus denying Calvary refusing
[1:06:14] the main thing see now um in
[1:06:18] uh I praise the
[1:06:20] Lord uh Abraham's Grace COV okay 61 the
[1:06:26] Antichrist in the last days so religious
[1:06:29] even Pentecostal so it would reive the
[1:06:31] very elected if it were possible that's
[1:06:33] right see Billy GM said the other night
[1:06:35] in his message he said the devil is so
[1:06:37] roaring until he's absolutely deceived
[1:06:38] the elected I thought oh oh Billy you
[1:06:41] made a mistake there that's right you

[1:07:47] the Holy Ghost on the on the on on on a
[1:07:49] cult toils of your parents see because
[1:07:51] it's an individual Affair see God God
[1:07:53] don't have grandchildren see see because
[1:07:56] see because you have to be certain of
[1:07:58] God see and in the message being certain
[1:08:00] of God brother Bram talked about how
[1:08:03] this lateran age is a is a is a uh
[1:08:06] what's the word it's a it's a idolatrous
[1:08:09] age see and the Lord hit on that hit on
[1:08:11] that a while ago see it's an adulterous
[1:08:13] age because in in the in the message be
[1:08:16] certain of God brother Brenham he
[1:08:18] referenced how uh when Elijah went to
[1:08:21] that woman the widow woman of how the
[1:08:23] drought that was going on at that time
[1:08:25] the drought it was a reflection of the
[1:08:27] sin it was reflection of the idolatry at
[1:08:30] that age see see now when she was now
[1:08:35] the widow woman when she was going she
[1:08:37] was picking up two sticks that's right
[1:08:40] and what do the two sticks represent
[1:08:41] what did the prophet tell us it was the
[1:08:43] two scks was the cross see see and did
[1:08:46] not the Bible say God say I pick up the
[1:08:49] cross and follow me forsake all else see
[1:08:52] so if you're certain of God have you
[1:08:54] trly forsaken everything else because
[1:08:56] look you got this right here it's right
[1:08:58] here every time you walk into church you
[1:09:00] got this looking at you right here
[1:09:01] that's a Rich Young Ruler right there
[1:09:03] have you truly forsaken everything see
[1:09:06] see see and there's a reason there's a
[1:09:08] reason why that's up there see now see
[1:09:11] because because because we're pilgrims
[1:09:13] see we're pilgrims looking for a for a
[1:09:15] city not made by the hands of men but
[1:09:17] made by the hands of God see see because
[1:09:20] see and thank God that you're the you're
[1:09:23] part of that if it was possible see
[1:09:26] because because see did not see yes sir
[1:09:31] see did not did not the prophet like an
[1:09:33] election unto a quilt see was not was
[1:09:36] not the quilt now the lady when she got
[1:09:39] the quilt she had to purchase the whole
[1:09:40] the whole material she had to purchase
[1:09:42] everything right right so when she
[1:09:43] purchased a quilt when people say oh
[1:09:46] well God died for everybody well yeah he
[1:09:47] did but but look he knew who would
[1:09:50] accept him there was elected portion see
[1:09:54] when she when that lady B the quilt she
[1:09:56] knew what portion she was going to use
[1:09:57] outside of the in the quilt so she took
[1:10:00] the part she was going to use and threw
[1:10:01] the other side away see see because
[1:10:04] because see because God knows who he's
[1:10:06] going to use God doesn't waste his time
[1:10:09] he's an on time God see God will not
[1:10:11] return to him void because before the
[1:10:13] foundation of the earth he knew who
[1:10:15] would accept him that's right see see so
[1:10:18] so and because you're elected you have
[1:10:20] no right to look down on the sinner see
[1:10:22] because because because you're saved by
[1:10:24] God's grace see see see we're we're save
[1:10:29] we're saved by his grace see see with
[1:10:31] with Abraham how how was it reckoned
[1:10:34] uncircumcision circumcision no it was
[1:10:36] reckoned in
[1:10:38] uncircumcision he wasn't if you in a
[1:10:40] church Message Church nothing it don't
[1:10:42] matter see it's uncircumcision see it
[1:10:44] was predestinated he received the
[1:10:46] promise when he was uncircumcised see
[1:10:49] see see what did uh what what did God
[1:10:52] say to uh to Nathaniel oh behold isite
[1:10:55] in whom there is no G see behold my
[1:10:58] Gentile bride to whom there is no spot
[1:10:59] nor wrinkle see see see now look see see
[1:11:05] see now look oh Lord uh when is thou

[1:11:11] I wish brother brother C was here
[1:11:12] because I heard him talking to my dad
[1:11:14] about something see and that's why I
[1:11:16] love listening to the elders because
[1:11:18] they got so much wisdom in them so much
[1:11:20] Revelation in them see cuz cuz the
[1:11:21] scripture tell tells you the scripture
[1:11:23] tells you to be uh uh Qui to hear and
[1:11:25] slow to speak see so always listen see
[1:11:29] see see that word see that word no see
[1:11:32] that word when you knowest me see in the
[1:11:35] scriptures that's used many times in in
[1:11:38] uh in uh intimate relations see and
[1:11:41] intimate relations Is type with the with
[1:11:43] the Holy with the holies for holies is
[1:11:45] not see and and and for for for for
[1:11:49] humans for for uh take for humans when
[1:11:53] your intimate relations Is the highest
[1:11:56] degree of love you can show by draining
[1:11:57] in one to somebody see because we have
[1:12:00] that feel your love we have that agape
[1:12:03] love see see and and and with the
[1:12:07] um with the when thou knowest me Lord
[1:12:10] when did you love me so much see when
[1:12:12] did you when did you choose me see see
[1:12:16] why why am I not that part why am I that
[1:12:20] if it was possible why me see see why am
[1:12:24] I part of that see he said before before
[1:12:27] the foundation of the world I chose you
[1:12:30] so you was in the back part of my mind
[1:12:32] see before the foundation of the world
[1:12:35] see before the foundation of the world
[1:12:38] see when you grow outside see the trees
[1:12:40] I was the the the grass I was see see
[1:12:44] the the the clouds I was see see when
[1:12:48] you see
[1:12:50] see see see I was I was before all of
[1:12:54] that and my d in construction all my
[1:12:56] life so I know I I picked up some things
[1:12:59] this building right here has has a
[1:13:01] foundation you can't see the foundation
[1:13:03] of the building see the foundation of
[1:13:05] the building see when when you're when
[1:13:08] the construction starts you got to dig
[1:13:10] down first that's right and and and and
[1:13:13] don't that don't that s like the pyramid
[1:13:15] got to go down and go up see see don't
[1:13:18] that don't don't that sound like the
[1:13:20] story of Jesus Christ went down and went
[1:13:23] up see when he made the the foundation
[1:13:27] of of the world the foundation of this
[1:13:29] building they went down put the concrete
[1:13:32] slabs in it and then he built up see see
[1:13:35] that means if I apply that the
[1:13:37] scriptures if the scriptures are
[1:13:39] consistent that must mean that that
[1:13:42] before the foundation of this world
[1:13:44] before the very axis that's keeping this
[1:13:46] the Earth the Earth centered before the
[1:13:49] very gravity that keeps the Earth in
[1:13:51] rotation I was before that see
[1:13:55] and and and if that holds true if that
[1:14:00] if that that hold if that holds true
[1:14:02] that means when God was was all covering
[1:14:05] all space and all time the Elohim the
[1:14:08] Jehovah I was right there I was with him
[1:14:11] see see and then when he condensed
[1:14:13] himself into the pillar of fire I was
[1:14:16] still there and then and then when he
[1:14:18] made the earth I was creating the Earth
[1:14:20] with him because he made the Earth for
[1:14:23] me see see
[1:14:25] that's why that's why I I I can walk and
[1:14:29] there can be a bull and I can tell the
[1:14:30] bull I'm just passing by Bo see that's
[1:14:33] why that's why I can talk to the bees
[1:14:36] when I'm cutting my grass see that's why
[1:14:38] I can cause to tell the Sun and the Moon
[1:14:40] to stop see that's why I can stop that's
[1:14:44] why that's why I can stop the rain for
[1:14:45] three years and six months cuz want man
[1:14:48] are like passions see
[1:14:50] see see see cuz it was made for me see
[1:14:54] look God had a threefold plan what was
[1:14:57] that what was that threefold plan that
[1:15:00] three-fold plan was God in Christ Christ
[1:15:02] in me and then and then Christ me and
[1:15:05] then it was to to restore back to
[1:15:08] restore back the Garden of Eden position
[1:15:11] see see see look
[1:15:15] see see in the title Christ is the
[1:15:18] mystery of God Christ is the mystery of
[1:15:20] God
[1:15:21] revealed that's why did he not say Jesus
[1:15:24] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:15:25] uhuh why didn't he say that
[1:15:28] no take your God is very particular
[1:15:32] that's right see and and anointed ones
[1:15:35] in the last in the end time not the
[1:15:37] prophet Prophet tell us that Christ
[1:15:40] means the anointed one that's right so
[1:15:43] so if I apply that uhuh take your time
[1:15:47] one in the end time if I apply that to
[1:15:50] myself because if there's a false
[1:15:52] anointed ones that's right there has to
[1:15:54] be you anoint to see if there's a bogus
[1:15:58] that has to be a real do see see so so
[1:16:03] and did God not say that the father uh I
[1:16:06] and the Father the father me and I and
[1:16:08] you that's right did did he not say uh
[1:16:11] look at the works that I do and he said
[1:16:14] if you don't believe me believe the
[1:16:15] works I do they speak of did he not say
[1:16:17] did he not come right around and then
[1:16:19] say uh these works you shall do even
[1:16:21] greater that's see what does that mean
[1:16:24] see that means I'm God that's exactly
[1:16:27] what that means see see look see look
[1:16:32] see see
[1:16:34] see see that means that that means that
[1:16:38] I am God see and and and
[1:16:42] and what just happened what just
[1:16:45] happened
[1:16:47] Sunday a war cry went out

[1:17:26] good and evil that's right she was
[1:17:28] already God see see that's why that's
[1:17:33] exactly
[1:17:35] why that's exactly why the second Eve
[1:17:38] won't fall cuz she in CA the Revelation
[1:17:40] that she's already God see we have
[1:17:42] Satan's answer see see see see see see

[1:18:34] see all that was in God the Father all
[1:18:36] that was in Christ there was all put in
[1:18:38] me so that means that all that was in
[1:18:40] God what in Christ is in me so all that
[1:18:42] is in God is in me see see so so so so
[1:18:47] San heard it right now s got 200 million
[1:18:50] demons he's freaking out right now he

[1:18:55] see see see you probably even started
[1:18:57] fighting already see see see because
[1:19:02] because brother brandom yes sir called
[1:19:05] himself a typologist right that's
[1:19:07] exactly right and right I'm follow the
[1:19:11] thought take your follow
[1:19:15] the the the Old Testament was a shadow
[1:19:18] of the things to come that's right
[1:19:20] written from written for admonition and
[1:19:22] learning uhhuh that's right in the old
[1:19:24] Old Testament kept typing Christ kep
[1:19:27] kept typing Christ kept typing Christ
[1:19:30] God in flesh kept saying God in flesh
[1:19:32] kept saying God in flesh and then Old
[1:19:35] Testament then New Testament came right
[1:19:37] God in flesh came right no one picked it
[1:19:40] up that's right no one got it that's
[1:19:43] right see that's right and if this
[1:19:47] message in this Bible are
[1:19:49] w why is it that brother brandham always
[1:19:52] said friends I believe we're in the
[1:19:55] shadow of the coming of the Lord see so
[1:19:58] if I apply that same principle Old
[1:20:00] Testament New Testament brother bham
[1:20:03] time my time right right shadow of the
[1:20:07] coming of the
[1:20:08] Lord don't miss it coming to the Lord
[1:20:11] just came it's already here see see see
[1:20:17] see because word God just God just
[1:20:22] had his whole bride right he's telling
[1:20:25] his whole bride that second part of the
[1:20:28] plan right sir is Christ in you right
[1:20:31] it's God in you right it's me in you if
[1:20:35] I'm in you then you are me see see am
[1:20:39] you are that mystery see see I'm I I'm
[1:20:43] going to go to a scripture see see it
[1:20:45] says um see because not him that with us
[1:20:48] not by him that runneth but by him that
[1:20:50] uh by the grace of God see see it says
[1:20:54] uh where the scripture see uh it's
[1:20:56] Colossians 1 yes sir verse uh 26 yes sir
[1:21:00] even the mystery which has been hid from
[1:21:02] ages and from Generations but is now
[1:21:05] made manifest to his Saints to whom God
[1:21:07] will make known what is the riches of
[1:21:08] the glory of this mystery among the
[1:21:10] Gentiles we're the Gentiles see which is
[1:21:14] Christ in you the hope of glory see see
[1:21:18] the only see brother bar said the only
[1:21:19] way you can actually be a Christian is
[1:21:21] for Christ to identify himself in you
[1:21:23] see see see that means he's recognized
[1:21:25] you see see look I got another quote uh
[1:21:29] I got another quote it reads it reads it
[1:21:34] reads yes sir this is this is this quote
[1:21:38] comes from Christ is a misery of God
[1:21:41] revealed 63 amen it reads look uhhuh
[1:21:44] Christ in you makes him the center of of
[1:21:46] life of the Revelation yes sir that's
[1:21:49] right Christ life in you makes him the
[1:21:50] center of the Revelation yes sir Christ
[1:21:53] in you makes you the complete re of the
[1:21:55] whole thing see see see see see look

[1:22:03] time is running out see see because
[1:22:07] because Satan done Satan he doing this
[1:22:10] for years thousands of years he knows

[1:26:19] because see this sword I got see I can
[1:26:22] chop his head off see he I need 200
[1:26:25] million demons it ain't hard to miss one
[1:26:26] to 200 million of them so I'm hit
[1:26:28] something see see
[1:26:32] see see see look see so look so look
[1:26:37] after sir after David cut his head off
[1:26:40] that's right after cut the Demon's head
[1:26:42] off he picked his head up that's right
[1:26:46] he picked his head up that's right and
[1:26:47] what happened yes sir all the armies of
[1:26:50] God yes sir caught the Revelation
[1:26:53] finally they finally caught the
[1:26:55] Revelation and then after they caught
[1:26:57] the Revelation the demons realized they
[1:26:59] caught it and they started running cuz
[1:27:01] they got scared see and guess what and
[1:27:04] what did the Army God do they chased him
[1:27:06] and killed them see
[1:27:09] see and I picked the head up and I
[1:27:11] showed it to my festar general j s s and
[1:27:15] I showed it to him and I still have the
[1:27:17] sword in my hand because the job ain't
[1:27:19] done yet I got 199,999
[1:27:24] 999 demons left to go see see see look
[1:27:31] see
[1:27:32] see so since AOS that dialysis demon it
[1:27:36] head was picked up see and what happened
[1:27:39] that Demon's head was picked up Sister
[1:27:42] Kelly the Demon's running it's scared go
[1:27:43] kill it see see see see look look see
[1:27:51] and that and and and I also and I also
[1:27:54] you think of also when that thought that
[1:27:57] thought C me to another thought of uh of
[1:28:00] Israel when Israel was told of the pro
[1:28:02] was told of the promised land see and
[1:28:05] when Israel was told of the promised
[1:28:07] land God told him this is yours see he
[1:28:10] said he said I'm Yours see I'm typing
[1:28:12] I'm typing it right now see he said he's
[1:28:14] that you're God go take it because after
[1:28:16] you get a revelation you have to get the
[1:28:18] you you have to take it for yourself
[1:28:20] first see it's hearing the word you hear
[1:28:23] it the word of God and accepting it so I
[1:28:27] you just heard it yeah you heard it but
[1:28:28] did you accept the word that he told you
[1:28:30] he he told you that you're God you take
[1:28:32] that you're God see see so so yes sir so
[1:28:38] he told him that follow that Spirit he
[1:28:40] told Israel yes sir to go and take the
[1:28:44] promise that's right see and on the way
[1:28:46] to get the promise there was all wrapped
[1:28:48] up in the gifts and the oh the milk and
[1:28:49] the honey the grapes all the big stuff
[1:28:52] you see and
[1:28:55] what happened when they found out they
[1:28:58] had to fight they got scared see it was
[1:29:01] on it was on a loudspeaker a couple
[1:29:03] Services ago see it was on a
[1:29:05] loudspeaker brother bam said he said the
[1:29:08] church got it wrong he said he said it's
[1:29:11] not a picnic he said it's a battlefield
[1:29:14] it's a war see after you accept the
[1:29:17] Revelation Satan's come right s's coming
[1:29:19] right behind it cuz he wants to fight
[1:29:21] that Revelation see see after after
[1:29:24] Jesus told Adam and Eve their God Satan
[1:29:26] came right behind and tried to fight it
[1:29:28] with with he said you'll be like God if
[1:29:30] you uh know good and evil I'm already am
[1:29:33] God what are you talking about see see
[1:29:36] see so look so
[1:29:38] look he told he told them to go take the
[1:29:41] promise they got scared they got scared
[1:29:43] when it was time to fight am and when it
[1:29:46] when it was when it took only two people
[1:29:49] actually took the Revelation that's it
[1:29:51] that was Joseph no sorry not Joseph
[1:29:53] Joshua
[1:29:54] and Caleb yes sir and they went and they
[1:29:58] fought
[1:30:02] now now they were giants right that's
[1:30:05] right GL was a giant GL was a type of of
[1:30:09] a demon
[1:30:10] right I wonder how many demons was in
[1:30:13] Canaan land was it 200 million of them
[1:30:17] because they're type type of demon too
[1:30:18] right right so does that not mean that
[1:30:22] after you accept revelation after after
[1:30:24] God told you that you're God and Satan
[1:30:27] comes and you got to know you got to
[1:30:29] fight you got to fight the demons
[1:30:30] afterwards see see
[1:30:33] so amen me see take your time
[1:30:39] see
[1:30:41] because some's going to receive it and
[1:30:43] some's not right see some people going
[1:30:46] to take the revelation of they're God
[1:30:48] and some's not going to take the
[1:30:49] revelation of their God see so get ready
[1:30:52] for a fight
[1:30:55] is not Satan like a roaring lion seeking
[1:30:58] who he may devour that's right didn't
[1:31:01] David picked that demon by his face by
[1:31:04] his by his by his his name and killed
[1:31:07] him right see so so we got the devil's
[1:31:11] answer so it's like Elisha watching
[1:31:13] Elijah see every time God tell us
[1:31:15] something we watching we looking yes
[1:31:18] amen hallelujah praise the Lord every
[1:31:20] time every time Jesus is telling us
[1:31:22] something we're watching him right see
[1:31:25] because the devil's going to come and
[1:31:27] he's going to try and fight it see so
[1:31:30] we're watching and Satan's coming around
[1:31:35] and he's trying to hit us with because
[1:31:38] he's not going to hit us with uh with
[1:31:41] with things that are not wrong he's
[1:31:44] going to hit us with thoughts that are
[1:31:46] valid but they're misplaced that's see
[1:31:52] see
[1:31:55] see help me Lord see because because see
[1:31:59] look when you get that Revelation see
[1:32:03] what happened when God was telling
[1:32:05] Joshua after they were fight when he was
[1:32:07] getting the soldiers picking the
[1:32:08] soldiers to fight and brought to the
[1:32:10] water and he had him drink the water
[1:32:13] Gideon he had him drink the water and he
[1:32:15] he was watching how they were drinking
[1:32:18] the water see because God's watching how
[1:32:20] he just took the Revelation he gave you
[1:32:22] because the water is water is the word
[1:32:24] right and some of them went down and
[1:32:26] drunk the water with both hands the face
[1:32:28] down see they put the sword down they
[1:32:30] put the Revelation down cuz they was
[1:32:32] fighting trying to take it they couldn't
[1:32:33] really take it they was fighting it but
[1:32:35] then there was some people that had the
[1:32:37] sword in their hand they was looking up
[1:32:40] why they drinking the water see they're
[1:32:42] looking up because the Lord says when
[1:32:44] you see these signs look up for your
[1:32:46] Redemption comes now see see because
[1:32:51] what time are what time are we in right
[1:32:53] now
[1:32:54] if what time are we in right now if
[1:32:58] brother Benham was saying we're in the
[1:32:59] shadow of coming of the Lord and brother
[1:33:02] B said the shadow reveals what that
[1:33:03] thing is see so if God tell us we're God
[1:33:08] that's the second part of his uh of of
[1:33:11] of his plan that's exactly right he got
[1:33:13] one more step left and that's to restore
[1:33:16] see see it can't it can't be far see see
[1:33:21] see so look so look that's exactly right
[1:33:25] see yes sir see so so so don't don't
[1:33:31] tell me
[1:33:32] that brother Stephen how long have we
[1:33:34] been um at this church three four years
[1:33:38] see God is redeeming his bride for
[1:33:41] Redemption redeeming his bride telling
[1:33:44] her who she is amen and what do we
[1:33:49] leave what what what uh um series were
[1:33:53] we on before we left the
[1:33:56] hotel that was king of hazus wasn't it
[1:33:59] in the feast right right so God told us
[1:34:02] that we're
[1:34:04] God and in King hazus Feast after Satan
[1:34:08] was dealt with after hmon was hung and
[1:34:13] killed after the marriage
[1:34:15] supper what was the marble
[1:34:18] flooring what was the colors on the
[1:34:20] floor of the marble flooring it was
[1:34:23] death h the grave the five uh uh the
[1:34:26] five horse riders see we're walking on
[1:34:29] Satan he's underneath us see see that's
[1:34:33] the that's the boo boo boo boo boo
[1:34:37] That's That was cuz he's down now see
[1:34:40] and he kept trying to fight that
[1:34:41] Revelation see so I got I got another
[1:34:44] quote see um yes um see it says uh it
[1:34:49] says
[1:34:50] um Ephesians 1 1-6 that's
[1:34:54] it says Accord uh this verse four I'm
[1:34:56] sorry according as he hath chosen Us in
[1:34:58] him before the foundation of the world
[1:35:00] that's right that we should be holding
[1:35:01] without blame for him in love that's
[1:35:03] right having predestinated us unto the
[1:35:05] adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:35:07] himself see what is Heavenly
[1:35:11] places Heavenly places brother bam said
[1:35:14] is a believer's position in Christ
[1:35:17] that's see so we are entering Heavenly
[1:35:20] places we are getting our position in
[1:35:22] Christ see it says it says uh according
[1:35:25] to the good pleasure of his will sir to
[1:35:27] the praise of the glory to the praise of
[1:35:29] the glory of his grace for he ha made us
[1:35:31] made us accepted in the Beloved that's
[1:35:33] exactly and then brother Brenham says in
[1:35:35] God's provided way 61 he says now it's
[1:35:38] election right see I want to get on that
[1:35:40] election strong because it's the truth
[1:35:43] see now you didn't become a Christian by
[1:35:44] just a coincidence you became a
[1:35:47] Christian before you was in this world
[1:35:49] am before you were born see God ordained
[1:35:52] you to be a Christian in the Gard of
[1:35:54] Eden see and he's restoring the Garden
[1:35:56] of Eden right now see see and that's the
[1:35:58] truth God before there ever was ever you
[1:36:01] know anything see no man can no man can
[1:36:04] walk and know where he's walking no man
[1:36:07] can walk without making sure he knows
[1:36:08] where he's walking that's we know where
[1:36:10] we stand because we're walking with the
[1:36:11] scriptures believing God keeps every
[1:36:13] word the word told us we're god brother
[1:36:16] bam told us that word God Walk with it
[1:36:20] and just accept that Revelation see see
[1:36:22] because if there's a see on Sunday when
[1:36:26] the Revelation came if there was a deep
[1:36:29] within the Deep there was a pull that
[1:36:31] that that made your your heart burn
[1:36:33] within you see see brother Bram says in
[1:36:35] God's provided way and as sure as that
[1:36:37] crave is in your heart there's got to be
[1:36:39] something spring somewhere to satisfy
[1:36:40] that craving you never have that craving
[1:36:44] see see see so so because remember when
[1:36:49] brother brandham gave the uh testimony
[1:36:52] of of the boy who was eating the erasers
[1:36:55] and he was eating the erasers because
[1:36:57] there was a craving in his body because
[1:36:59] he was he was lacking it see that's what
[1:37:01] he needed see
[1:37:03] he but remember the other story when
[1:37:06] brother Bon was saying how um how uh
[1:37:09] there was two men and uh he was like be
[1:37:12] growing up in the ranks of the
[1:37:14] Pentecostal church he said there was two
[1:37:15] men um he said in the and the uh
[1:37:18] anointing the genuine anointing fell on
[1:37:20] both of them right see but one of them
[1:37:22] was a was a anyone Christian other one
[1:37:24] was a
[1:37:25] hypocrite see
[1:37:30] so look um glory to
[1:37:35] God see so because you know this
[1:37:37] Revelation because you know that you're
[1:37:39] elected of God don't look down on
[1:37:44] someone else or a sinner you have no
[1:37:47] right to no sir because because did not
[1:37:50] God say that you can't even call Christ
[1:37:52] Lord if by the holy is not by the Holy
[1:37:54] Ghost that's right see see did did he
[1:37:57] did he not say that um uh you can't even
[1:38:00] come to me unless my father draw draws
[1:38:02] you to me that's exactly so so you a
[1:38:04] even have you it wasn't even you didn't
[1:38:07] even do
[1:38:08] nothing
[1:38:09] but brother Benham told us he said that
[1:38:12] brother Benham said that you had nothing
[1:38:13] to do with it in the first place see see
[1:38:17] that's exact see see and brother Benham
[1:38:19] says in um it is I 61 he saids many
[1:38:21] times people think when a Ministry comes
[1:38:23] become Supernatural think that a person
[1:38:25] ought to wear Rob clothes touch me not
[1:38:28] you know and when a person acts like
[1:38:30] that they're trying to be something that
[1:38:31] they're not see God uses men just
[1:38:33] ordinary men it and see a person like
[1:38:36] that to me it's a stuffed shirt see
[1:38:38] somebody trying to be something they're
[1:38:39] not see see so so so you didn't save
[1:38:42] yourself so don't so don't try to make
[1:38:44] it seem like you saved yourself cuz you
[1:38:46] didn't see because see you say oh um uh
[1:38:50] uh the Lord said don't cast a PR Before
[1:38:52] Swine yeah he says that yeah yeah he
[1:38:54] said that that's scripture but you're
[1:38:56] misinterpreting you're putting it in the
[1:38:57] wrong place because because did not the
[1:38:59] scripture give us wisdom on how to deal
[1:39:01] deal deal with the people of the world
[1:39:03] he said be kind un to all men and apt to
[1:39:05] teach that's right see see see because
[1:39:09] because because he said be kind to all
[1:39:11] men be apt to teach that means that see
[1:39:14] see I live on a college campus so I know
[1:39:16] how it is you tried to you try to uh
[1:39:18] give the Holy Ghost to somebody or speak
[1:39:20] about Jesus to somebody they look at you
[1:39:21] crazy they uh they try to you or they uh
[1:39:24] they ignore you or or they try to uh uh
[1:39:27] argue with you see see but what you do
[1:39:30] is be kind on to all men after to teach
[1:39:32] you be so kind to them that that the the
[1:39:35] the the Holy Ghost that's bubbling
[1:39:37] outside of you doesn't make it hard for
[1:39:39] them to give you a glass of water see
[1:39:41] the Holy Ghost is bubbling bubbling
[1:39:43] outside of you doesn't make it hard for
[1:39:45] them to to to to to to to share share a
[1:39:47] Kit Kat with you or share some food with
[1:39:49] you see the Holy Ghost inside of you
[1:39:51] when you're at work or when you're at
[1:39:52] school the Holy Ghost inside of you
[1:39:54] that's bubbling so much it makes it
[1:39:56] bearable for them that's the only reason
[1:39:58] why they're going to work or going to
[1:39:59] school because of you see so so so so
[1:40:03] one day when when you don't come come to
[1:40:05] work and come to school they're woring
[1:40:07] where you at so so they ask you or they
[1:40:09] call you or you text you and they ask
[1:40:11] you how you doing and you say man you
[1:40:13] say you know uh uh uh I'm feeling down
[1:40:15] in my body but by his Tripes I'm Healed
[1:40:18] and by I'm Healed and my body is just
[1:40:20] catching up to my confession see so so
[1:40:23] and they're going to say man he said
[1:40:25] even even when they're sick they just
[1:40:27] they have a consolation in Christ man I
[1:40:29] want to go and talk to them I'm going to
[1:40:31] go visit them while they're sick because
[1:40:33] because I I want I want what they have
[1:40:35] see see so so don't don't be a be a
[1:40:40] stuck up person because God just told
[1:40:43] you who you are see still be humble see
[1:40:47] see because because the Way Up Is Down
[1:40:51] see because because because see but
[1:40:54] brother bam said when a man thinks he
[1:40:56] accomplished something that's when he
[1:40:57] start going to sin he said he said
[1:40:59] that's when he start messing up that's
[1:41:00] when he realize that he ain't no one to
[1:41:01] begin with see see so so don't don't
[1:41:06] um don't don't be a stuffed shirt see
[1:41:10] see see so in
[1:41:13] um see and and when it comes to uh fight
[1:41:17] not Revelation see brother bam says is
[1:41:19] and lean not on th own understanding see
[1:41:22] brother bam says
[1:41:23] when God speaks speaks a word he doesn't
[1:41:26] need any man or woman or no one else to
[1:41:28] say what it what that means see I don't
[1:41:31] need any interpretation it only needs an
[1:41:33] exception am see so just accept it see
[1:41:38] see me Lord see take your time see and
[1:41:44] when God said put this
[1:41:46] mind in you with Christ thinking not
[1:41:49] robbery to be equal with God
[1:41:53] brother bham said that there's a bogus
[1:41:56] is a real thing see and in the time
[1:41:58] we're in brother bham said to neurotic
[1:42:00] age right and if it's a neurotic age
[1:42:02] that me many people has lost their mind
[1:42:04] that's right and if many people has lost
[1:42:07] their mind that means that that means
[1:42:09] that it's a it's a perversion and in
[1:42:12] that perversion what is it telling us
[1:42:14] it's telling us that if you're able to
[1:42:16] lose your mind and have and have when
[1:42:18] you're insane you're super strong and
[1:42:20] have superpowers what does it mean if
[1:42:22] you take the mind of and put it in you
[1:42:24] if you accept that what is possible with
[1:42:26] that see see see see just follow that
[1:42:31] thought see in
[1:42:33] um in
[1:42:36] uh another quote uh yes sir brother bham
[1:42:40] said and lean not th own understanding
[1:42:41] that's it he said my sheep know my voice
[1:42:46] right he say they're not subject to any
[1:42:48] other voice that's right they won't
[1:42:50] uhhuh in other words they will not
[1:42:53] understand the theological voice that's
[1:42:55] teaching contrary to the word see the
[1:42:58] Sheep don't understand that no more than
[1:43:00] the eagle last night could understand
[1:43:01] the clucking of the head see remember
[1:43:04] that uh Parable brother brother Brenham
[1:43:05] gave us of how um he said that they was
[1:43:09] walking out and they said man I I heard
[1:43:11] him call me a vulture I heard him call
[1:43:13] me an eagle see see see because when God
[1:43:17] told you that you're God see there were
[1:43:19] some people that walked out and thought
[1:43:21] that wasn't me I'm unworthy to be be God
[1:43:23] but then there's some people that said
[1:43:25] that accept the Revelation said I am God
[1:43:27] see
[1:43:30] see see
[1:43:34] because amen see um got another quote
[1:43:38] yes my brother another quote see yes sir
[1:43:41] see and
[1:43:43] and there is a mixed multitude that
[1:43:46] still here because it has to the
[1:43:49] scriptures have to be fulfilled see if
[1:43:55] if there was a Cain there was Abel when
[1:43:59] there was a when there was a uh Jacob
[1:44:01] there was a Esau when there was a Jesus
[1:44:03] there was a Judas iscar see see and when
[1:44:07] those
[1:44:08] disciples and when Judas was with
[1:44:10] them when Jesus was showing them God in
[1:44:14] flesh I don't think Judas really caught
[1:44:16] the full revelation of God in flesh
[1:44:19] because if Judas knew that God could be
[1:44:21] in flesh he would have knew that you
[1:44:23] can't kill God so he never would have
[1:44:24] did what he did in the first place see
[1:44:27] see so if you if
[1:44:30] you are struggling to accept that God
[1:44:35] can be in flesh be careful of that
[1:44:38] Spirit be careful of because it's a
[1:44:40] demon see because there 200 million
[1:44:41] demons there's a demon that's trying to
[1:44:43] get in your mind and that's trying to
[1:44:45] make
[1:44:46] you doubt make you doubt it's trying to
[1:44:49] make you uh what what did Brother Bron
[1:44:51] say crucify God AR fresh again see see
[1:44:55] because because see brother BR says in
[1:44:57] Israel in the church 53 he says and
[1:44:59] watch it's moving right out today in a
[1:45:01] terrible Force oh it behooves you my
[1:45:03] brother my sister consider what you're
[1:45:05] listening at don't you never
[1:45:07] underestimate Satan's power for
[1:45:09] deceiving don't you underestimate him
[1:45:11] he's smooth as he can be see the
[1:45:13] Antichrist Spirit isn't communism see
[1:45:15] the Antichrist spirit is so close to the
[1:45:17] real thing if it was possible he is a
[1:45:20] religious spirit able brother
[1:45:23] The Crow and the dove sat Dove sat in
[1:45:25] the same Roost Esau and Jacob were
[1:45:27] brothers Judas and Jesus were of the
[1:45:29] same church right okay and then and then
[1:45:33] there's um another quote um another
[1:45:36] quote it says uh that spirit in their
[1:45:38] earnestly contending for the faith and
[1:45:39] 54 yes uh brother Bram says he says th
[1:45:43] Spirit of Cain in the Garden of Eden
[1:45:44] right he says here's the spirit of Abel
[1:45:46] from the Garden of Eden coming on coming
[1:45:48] right on see both of them going up to
[1:45:51] the stop now it's it's reaching its head
[1:45:53] that's right see look at them they're
[1:45:55] ready to bloom out now the church and
[1:45:57] the world together the former church and
[1:45:59] the spiritual church he said let them
[1:46:01] grow together see cuz rain falls on the
[1:46:03] just and the unjust so when God brings a
[1:46:06] revelation down it falls on the just and
[1:46:08] the unjust so God brought that
[1:46:10] Revelation that you were God down and
[1:46:12] fell on everybody see see so it says let
[1:46:15] them grow together notice and pers
[1:46:17] Nations and so forth see as jambre and
[1:46:20] janz with stood Moses so did so do these
[1:46:23] resist the truth men of rep probate
[1:46:26] Minds concerning the truth see Justus as
[1:46:29] popularity they won't go into it because
[1:46:30] they're afraid to tackle it see see EXA
[1:46:34] they're they're afraid to identify
[1:46:36] themselves with Christ see see they're
[1:46:38] afraid to accept that Revelation that's
[1:46:40] right see see um now another I got
[1:46:44] another
[1:46:45] quote in um follow the spirit my brother
[1:46:49] and um Amen brother bam said is the
[1:46:53] church number one yes sir 53 uhhuh he
[1:46:56] says now I want you to quiet and you
[1:46:57] down for just a minute uhhuh and Judas
[1:47:00] was with them that's right Judas was as
[1:47:04] big as a big a duck was in the puddle he
[1:47:07] was shouting and rejoicing too and he
[1:47:10] followed the church right down on until
[1:47:12] it came to Pentecost see what is
[1:47:15] Pentecost see Pentecost is God coming
[1:47:18] down himself yes sir see Pentecost when
[1:47:21] Israel was going to the promised land
[1:47:24] right that was see when Pentecost came
[1:47:27] to receive the Holy Ghost to receive the
[1:47:29] Holy Spirit to receive that Revelation
[1:47:32] see a lot of them couldn't accept it a
[1:47:34] lot of them weren't able to take it see
[1:47:37] see they they can get all the way down
[1:47:39] to sanctification but when it comes to
[1:47:42] the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother
[1:47:44] said that's when they show their colors
[1:47:45] that's right but when it comes to see
[1:47:47] this is continuing but when it comes to
[1:47:49] Pentecost to receive the baptism of the
[1:47:51] Holy Ghost he refus it and betay and
[1:47:53] betrayed Jesus and that was the
[1:47:55] Antichrist and that Spirit today will
[1:47:57] come right on down and teach
[1:47:58] justification by faith and everything
[1:47:59] and move on right down and it show us
[1:48:01] colors that's right see see
[1:48:06] now amen
[1:48:08] amen
[1:48:10] amen see it says
[1:48:14] um another quote some it says
[1:48:18] uh take your
[1:48:20] time it says in John 29 uhhuh see
[1:48:25] because uhhuh when God gave the
[1:48:27] Revelation yes see there are some
[1:48:30] doubting Thomases that's it see that's
[1:48:33] it there's some people that they're
[1:48:36] stuck in the
[1:48:39] calistic see they can't get past that
[1:48:42] barrier see and and and verse 29 it says
[1:48:47] Jesus said unto him Thomas because thou
[1:48:50] has seen me thou has believed right
[1:48:52] blessed are all they that have not seen
[1:48:54] and yet have believed see I didn't
[1:48:58] physically see before the foundation of
[1:49:01] the world I didn't physically remember
[1:49:04] seeing even though I did because brother
[1:49:06] bham say just spiritual Amnesia so I
[1:49:08] still saw it I'm just it's still hard
[1:49:11] for me to remember it see see but but
[1:49:14] bypass my theophany see and and even
[1:49:17] though I didn't see it I still believe
[1:49:19] it see and blessed is he blessed is he
[1:49:22] that amen say blessed are they that have
[1:49:25] not seen and have yet believed see so
[1:49:28] because I believe and I'm even more
[1:49:30] blessed than that see and and and also
[1:49:33] because you were given this Revelation
[1:49:35] more stripes to him that knoweth so be
[1:49:37] careful that because you you you know
[1:49:39] this Revelation now be careful of how
[1:49:42] you handle it because if you mess up see
[1:49:44] because especially for the young people
[1:49:45] too because our parents see they they um
[1:49:50] went through you know the domination
[1:49:52] years in teaching but we have the Divine
[1:49:54] word of God see and more stripes are to
[1:49:57] us that know because if you mess up and
[1:50:00] if you reject this Revelation and if he
[1:50:02] reject like Esau with the pot of meal
[1:50:05] going for things of the world for things
[1:50:07] for things for things that that will
[1:50:10] that will that will pass away for things
[1:50:12] that are not permanent see if we give up
[1:50:16] that you give up your birth right see I
[1:50:19] know how much my stamp cost I know how
[1:50:22] much my birth right call see I know how
[1:50:24] much that that uh that um uh that
[1:50:27] promise C see because it was the blood
[1:50:29] of God and that in in the blood is a
[1:50:32] life that life is in the blood see see
[1:50:35] so Jesus came down himself because if
[1:50:37] it's left up to man man can't save
[1:50:39] himself see because every time God was
[1:50:42] left men was left to their own devices
[1:50:44] they failed see and the in the um uh
[1:50:49] before the into the Delian flood they
[1:50:51] couldn't do it they fell right before
[1:50:54] the uh uh s gomor they couldn't do it
[1:50:56] they fa even now it's happening again
[1:50:59] they fa see but there every age there
[1:51:01] was an elected seed there was an elected
[1:51:03] people of that if it were possible
[1:51:05] people there was an elected seed that
[1:51:08] did not fall for for for they did not
[1:51:11] reject that
[1:51:12] Revelation because because if if all the
[1:51:16] scriptures are showing us that it's just
[1:51:19] Christ and you if just like right now
[1:51:21] like the five garments God is showing us
[1:51:23] that is Christ in us because you can see
[1:51:25] the five garments in your life see if
[1:51:28] you're seeing it that means that God is
[1:51:30] telling you that that if Joseph was a
[1:51:33] type of Christ does that not mean that
[1:51:35] he's shown you that it's Christ in you
[1:51:37] it's Christ in me see that's what he's
[1:51:39] telling us see he he he he's teaching it
[1:51:43] to us in a way to where we will
[1:51:45] understand it because he hid it from the
[1:51:46] eyes and the wi of prudent and gave to
[1:51:48] babies such that would learn that's
[1:51:50] right see see so so um come me Lord see
[1:51:55] see
[1:51:56] um see
[1:51:59] because in uh Christ's mystery God
[1:52:02] revealed in
[1:52:04] 63 brother Bram
[1:52:06] says and the other night you didn't get
[1:52:09] the tape that I preached here one night
[1:52:11] on a prisoner of Jesus Christ Paul a
[1:52:14] prisoner see when God gets you to be his
[1:52:17] prisoner then you can't do nothing what
[1:52:18] the spirit says do got and then verse 84
[1:52:22] this is how I knew that the lord gave me
[1:52:25] this message because I had this quote
[1:52:26] and then brother stepen came up and had
[1:52:28] po this exact quote up it says 84 says
[1:52:31] he said then take this Rod to take this
[1:52:33] thy rod God speaking that's God's word
[1:52:36] right go out there and point it towards
[1:52:38] the east and call for flies and the
[1:52:40] flies came into creation see cuz that
[1:52:42] was the third pool see and if you want
[1:52:44] to utilize the third pool if you want to
[1:52:46] utilize it if you want to accept you got
[1:52:48] to accept the Revelation that's your God
[1:52:50] if you want to utilize that third pool
[1:52:52] and the only way you can fully utilize
[1:52:54] is because if you accept the mind of God
[1:52:55] that's in Christ see a man that a man
[1:52:58] that has a god of Christ has is die
[1:53:00] completely to his flesh he has no fault
[1:53:03] of his own he he has no desire of his
[1:53:05] own see so when you're that means you're
[1:53:08] a complete prisoner because everything
[1:53:10] God says do that's what you do that's
[1:53:12] right see so so see and the FES came
[1:53:14] into creation because he was a prisoner
[1:53:16] that Pharaoh couldn't pay off with
[1:53:18] nothing see nobody else could turn away
[1:53:20] he was complete prisoner in the chains
[1:53:21] of God's
[1:53:23] bound up only to thus sayith the Lord
[1:53:25] that's right see see um see and then
[1:53:28] that's when he went into uh God's words
[1:53:30] you know interpretation see see so he
[1:53:33] says brother B says lean up to their own
[1:53:35] understanding 65 he says we're not asked
[1:53:37] to understand it we're asked to believe
[1:53:39] it that's it believe it by what by faith
[1:53:42] amen if you understand it that makes
[1:53:44] Faith know you can't understand it but
[1:53:48] you believe it anyhow see I may not
[1:53:52] understand everything as of yet yes but
[1:53:55] by and by I understand it better by and
[1:53:58] by amen see I may be young in the faith
[1:54:01] and I may not understand everything just
[1:54:03] yet but by and by as I subit myself more
[1:54:07] I'm understand more and more amen see
[1:54:10] amen see see because because because
[1:54:12] with Christ being the center of
[1:54:13] Revelation being because of Christ being
[1:54:15] the center of it all see because because
[1:54:17] I've caught that Revelation see that
[1:54:20] means that I have no thought on my own
[1:54:22] that means Christ is in me speaking
[1:54:23] through me amen see see amen that's
[1:54:27] exactly right see um that's what it is
[1:54:30] amen praise the Lord um I would like to
[1:54:34] uh to pray pray now I think that's my
[1:54:38] time um I have to pray now
