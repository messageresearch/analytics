[25:10] okay is that your you said your brother
[25:13] okay
[25:14] your brother is in europe and he's sick
[25:16] we'll remember him in prayer this
[25:17] evening
[25:18] david could you come and lead us in a
[25:19] repair this evening
[25:32] let's bow our heads dear lord we thank
[25:35] you for all you've done for us for being
[25:36] with us and keeping us
[25:38] lord we know you are enough we know you
[25:39] are provider and you've already provided
[25:41] every answer for these requests
[25:43] we thank you for being with sister
[25:45] sharon's brother and make giving him a
[25:47] touch in his body lord
[25:48] be with the ones traveling to alabama
[25:51] this week lord and
[25:52] just be with us all to get our lights
[25:54] lit a little bit brighter lord we thank
[25:56] you for all you've done we pray you
[25:57] bless the service and we're just
[25:58] expecting because
[26:00] we know you if we're expecting we know
[26:02] you'll be here and you'll answer
[26:03] and you'll deliver we thank you for all
[26:04] you've done father god and we ask this
[26:06] in the name of jesus christ
[26:08] amen you all may be seated as they
[26:11] gather the offer
[26:15] you all just keep uh me and brother john
[26:18] and one for one brother robert fills in
[26:19] you all just keep us in prayer as song
[26:21] leader sometimes it's hard to
[26:23] find a balance of what's okay to sing
[26:26] and what's not okay to sing and
[26:28] because you'll see some of these people
[26:29] that sing some of these songs and they
[26:31] look
[26:32] they look really rough like you're like
[26:34] oh that's
[26:35] how could this be of god with the person
[26:37] that's singing it looks they're not
[26:38] living a life at all
[26:40] and sometimes it's hard to understand
[26:41] but but you know the gifts and callings
[26:43] are without repentance and the rain
[26:45] falls on the just and the unjust and
[26:47] like for the for instance this song
[26:49] it's directly out of scripture so if the
[26:52] scripture is anointed
[26:53] and somebody turns right out of the
[26:55] scripture like this part up here
[26:57] he's more than enough according to the
[26:59] power that worketh in us
[27:01] they get that from the scripture so
[27:02] whoever this writer is i believe that
[27:04] the anointing is on this writer
[27:06] so if we look past the singer or
[27:07] sometimes the
[27:09] music gets out of control in some of
[27:10] these songs but if you look to the words
[27:12] and that's the benefit of being able to
[27:14] bring it here in the church and sing it
[27:16] because you can just you can change the
[27:18] music and you can change the atmosphere
[27:20] but yet the words i believe are inspired
[27:22] so you just keep us in prayer i don't
[27:24] ever want to come up here and sing
[27:25] anything that's
[27:26] not pleasing to the lord and i know
[27:28] brother john doesn't i know brother
[27:29] robert doesn't so
[27:30] keep us in prayer as we as we study and
[27:32] we pray about what we what we sing
[27:34] and uh wish us our desire to get
[27:37] ourselves out of the way and
[27:38] allow the holy spirit to come come and
[27:40] and
[27:41] be the leader to the people and get us
[27:43] prepared for the word so
[27:44] does anybody have a special on their
[27:46] heart this evening i asked a couple on
[27:48] my way in and they said no
[27:49] so zaddy do you have one she was one of
[27:52] the people i asked
[27:54] and she said she didn't so i guess the
[27:56] lord put something on her heart
[27:59] praise the lord
[28:04] michael as well
[28:08] that's embarrassing it's okay um
[28:11] you know it's funny sometimes you may
[28:13] not want to
[28:15] do what the lord calls you to do based
[28:17] off of something simple as you know not
[28:19] feeling like
[28:20] you you know came in with the right
[28:22] attire or you know just something simple
[28:24] as that and then as we were worshiping
[28:27] it was just like you know what i forgot
[28:29] how great god has been to me
[28:30] especially recently with a lot of things
[28:33] that's been going on and
[28:34] just how he's been delivering me and
[28:36] just keeping me in a
[28:37] in a great state of mind and even
[28:39] recovering the joy of my salvation so
[28:41] i just want to sing a song to is the
[28:43] glory it's actually a song that
[28:45] i had um actually last year
[28:48] um and there's just kind of a list of
[28:50] songs that i've wanted to sing but
[28:51] just waiting for the right time and the
[28:53] right anointing so i pray this would be
[28:55] a blessing to you tonight it's just a
[28:57] small
[28:58] medley that i just want to sing to him
[29:03] this is coming from my heart straight to
[29:05] the lord

[40:59] offering lord's willing brother david
[41:02] was saying the text

[41:09] message telling you about the progress
[41:12] of the church as far as what we need to
[41:14] do amen
[41:16] so just be on the loop you're going to
[41:17] receive a text message and it will tell
[41:19] you exactly
[41:20] what we need in church because we have
[41:22] certain things we have to do
[41:23] to make sure we ride on track everybody
[41:26] got it
[41:27] blessed be the name of the lord tonight
[41:29] i'm not preaching
[41:32] i'm starting coming up from the wedding
[41:35] so lord dwelling on sunday we're going
[41:37] to pick up
[41:38] we stop at the mystery of the weakness
[41:42] amen you remember that mystery part 41
[41:46] god strength is expressed in that
[41:49] weakness
[41:50] amen yeah now you understand that what
[41:53] that a woman is not designed
[41:55] or created by the devil she was
[41:58] created by god but designed by
[42:01] perversion
[42:02] by the devil and we understand the two
[42:05] battle of wisdom
[42:06] and how god and satan are fighting
[42:09] and they use a woman as a by-product a
[42:12] weaker visa
[42:13] to express the plan of redemption
[42:18] amen without a woman the plan of
[42:20] redemption could be locked
[42:22] because the lamb was slain before the
[42:25] foundation of the world
[42:27] so it took the weakness of a woman to
[42:30] introduce the plan of redemption
[42:32] and he also took a woman to introduce
[42:35] the messiah
[42:36] god himself have to come through the
[42:39] channel
[42:39] of a woman let me tell you this message
[42:42] is the perfect message that can take a
[42:45] woman
[42:46] and bring her in her proper place to be
[42:48] respected
[42:49] with dignity and honor amen
[42:53] blessed be the name of the lord so we
[42:55] have brother bruce

[43:07] now it's brother mayangi and there is
[43:10] something that he spoke that always
[43:11] stuck with me
[43:13] when he was preaching he said that when
[43:15] israel got to the red sea
[43:17] there was a road there but it was only
[43:20] covered by water
[43:22] so that always stuck in my head for
[43:25] years

[46:39] sing any more amen i bring greetings
[46:43] from brother
[46:43] scott smith and the assembly there and
[46:46] then he wanted to make sure i
[46:47] sent greetings down to brother stephen
[46:49] and the church and
[46:51] amen and amen amen it's just good to be
[46:55] in this presence
[46:57] amen looking around and see a few faces
[47:00] amen praise the lord well let's get into
[47:04] the
[47:04] into the scripture because i know that's
[47:06] what we come for
[47:08] hebrews the 10th chapter
[47:11] hebrews the 10th chapter
[47:20] hebrews the 10th chapter and i'm going
[47:21] to look there in the
[47:24] 35th verse
[47:34] i want to speak if i had to give it a
[47:36] title i'd
[47:38] lord laid it on my heart the unveiling
[47:42] of you amen the unveiling of you
[47:47] it would kind of be like the you know
[47:49] the road's already there but it just has
[47:51] to be unveiled
[47:53] amen i believe that that everything that
[47:57] that is supposed to be is is here we
[48:00] know that
[48:01] we know that the rapture is here we know
[48:04] that
[48:04] christ is is here we know that he's
[48:07] living in us we know that the rapture
[48:09] is in us we know him in the time that
[48:12] we're living in what's
[48:13] what's taking place but a lot of the
[48:15] things we don't naturally
[48:16] see but i believe as we walk it's being
[48:20] unveiled who we really are
[48:23] amen and i know the prophet said that
[48:25] maya when she recognizes
[48:27] she'll be an invincible army and i
[48:30] believe she is that invincible army
[48:32] i believe that she is an undefeated
[48:35] army i believe that she is one that's
[48:38] come with
[48:39] the savior this evening i believe she
[48:42] stands with a
[48:43] a warrior tonight that that lives in her
[48:46] putting on the whole armor of god
[48:48] brother brandon said he dressed himself
[48:49] in
[48:50] us and he's walking amen he's fulfilling
[48:53] his word this evening
[48:56] so with that in hebrews the 10th chapter
[48:58] and the 35th verse
[49:00] paul's speaking he says cast not away
[49:04] therefore your confidence
[49:07] which hath great recompense of reward
[49:11] for you have need of patience that after
[49:14] you have
[49:15] done the will of god how many believes
[49:17] you're doing the will of god
[49:21] amen how many believes you're doing the
[49:22] will of god
[49:23] [Music]
[49:25] he talked of jonah he said he was in the
[49:27] perfect will of god
[49:29] amen it's a mystery so he said
[49:32] have patience that after you have done
[49:34] the will of god ye
[49:36] might receive the promise
[49:39] for yet a little while and he that shall
[49:41] come will come
[49:43] and will not tarry so there's something
[49:45] that is that is being
[49:47] unveiled here now the just
[49:50] shall live by faith that just we know is
[49:53] it
[49:53] is the justified amen it's a people it's
[49:57] not just an
[49:58] idea or an attitude or or something but
[50:01] it is a it is a people that just
[50:03] shall live by faith
[50:06] but if any man draw back my soul shall
[50:10] have no pleasure in him
[50:12] now this i believe this is more than
[50:13] just paul speaking but i believe this is
[50:15] god speaking
[50:17] amen and he's he's making a division
[50:19] here between the just and
[50:21] everybody else he's he's he's
[50:24] unveiling who is what in this hour
[50:28] or we can say he's manifesting who we
[50:31] are
[50:32] amen and as the just are being
[50:33] manifested so are the others
[50:36] amen and so he said my soul shall have
[50:39] no pleasure
[50:40] in him but we are not of them who draw
[50:44] back
[50:44] unto perdition but of them
[50:47] that believe to the saving of the soul
[50:51] dear heavenly father we just ask you
[50:53] tonight god
[50:55] lord that you let our minds be upon thee
[50:57] and our hearts be open unto you god lord
[50:59] let us forget everything that is behind
[51:01] us tonight
[51:03] and father as we enter into this secret
[51:05] place tonight god lord let every door be
[51:07] shut
[51:08] around us and father let us stand in thy
[51:11] presence alone god
[51:13] for lord we come god out of things lord
[51:15] that that lord in our own minds we might
[51:17] not understand
[51:18] father we've walked through things today
[51:20] this week god lord that be
[51:23] beyond our understanding father but god
[51:25] i pray in this place lord you'll make it
[51:27] known
[51:27] to us and father we commit it now into
[51:30] your hands lord
[51:32] this time that we have lord redeem in
[51:35] our time
[51:36] lord that it might be with you and you
[51:37] alone in jesus christ's name
[51:41] amen and amen you might be seated
[51:45] and as we look at this in hebrews the
[51:47] 10th chapter in the first
[51:49] verse paul says for the law having a
[51:52] shadow of good things to come
[51:56] amen so something is always coming
[51:59] something when you put a seed in the
[52:01] ground something's coming
[52:03] amen something has to people say well
[52:05] what kind of seeds you put in the ground
[52:06] well wait and see
[52:07] what seed it is jesus laid good seed in
[52:10] the ground one time his disciples
[52:12] wondered where the weeds come from
[52:14] amen and they asked shall we go ahead
[52:15] and tear them up he said no let them go
[52:17] until the harvest why
[52:19] because the lord of the harvest knew
[52:21] what seed he put in the ground
[52:24] see he wasn't worried about any
[52:26] circumstance on the outside that was
[52:28] going to interrupt the seed
[52:29] he knew his seed was good seed and
[52:32] listen
[52:32] saints in this hour is coming to harvest
[52:35] time and as we
[52:36] see everything beginning to bloom around
[52:38] us we know for a
[52:39] certainty we are confident in this one
[52:42] thing
[52:43] that the word of god cannot fail
[52:46] and that word of god is that good seed
[52:48] because that good seed was that original
[52:51] seed which was that spoken word
[52:54] and i believe that's where we come from
[52:56] amen so i believe that as the shadow of
[52:59] good things to come
[53:00] not the very image of the things
[53:03] can never with those sacrifices which
[53:05] they offered year by year continually
[53:08] make comers there unto perfect
[53:12] and then as we looked here and we saw
[53:14] how that paul was getting down after he
[53:16] brought forth all the
[53:17] the separation for my take of the way
[53:19] the first that he might
[53:20] how did he establish the second how he's
[53:22] taken away one thing that he's bringing
[53:24] something better that he's
[53:26] that he's taken his you know something
[53:28] that was that was bringing us to a
[53:29] certain point just a shadow but
[53:31] he said it wasn't the very thing that he
[53:33] was looking for
[53:35] see god is it was looking for something
[53:37] the law couldn't do it
[53:39] because god was looking for fellowship
[53:41] but the law couldn't bring it
[53:43] he was looking to restore it back to
[53:45] what eden was and even pentecost brother
[53:47] brahm said couldn't do it
[53:49] amen because brother brahman said listen
[53:51] we're not going back to pentecost
[53:53] wow we're not going just back to some
[53:55] some sensation or some emotion or some
[53:58] idea
[53:58] but we're going back to the very
[54:00] beginning where we had fellowship
[54:02] with god himself and to where he could
[54:04] have fellowship with us
[54:06] amen why did he say it's not good that
[54:09] man should dwell
[54:10] alone because one day god knew that he
[54:12] was going to be a man
[54:13] see god made preparation amen that his
[54:16] word would
[54:17] manifest and that he would find pleasure
[54:21] in his word amen
[54:25] all things were created by him
[54:29] amen all things were created by him and
[54:31] they were also created
[54:33] for him amen all encompasses everything
[54:37] and including you and i
[54:38] we weren't created to live our own life
[54:41] to do our own thing to gather our own
[54:43] riches or wealth or our our natural
[54:45] blessings on this earth
[54:46] but we were created in the image and in
[54:48] the mind of god
[54:49] that we might be pleasing unto him
[54:53] we what is it we are the very the very
[54:56] desire of god's heart
[55:00] we're the very desire when he when we as
[55:02] we're being unveiled we're
[55:04] god is beginning god is beginning to see
[55:08] us now
[55:09] and we are beginning to see ourselves
[55:13] how he sees us amen it's the unveiling
[55:16] because watch now
[55:20] you know i've i've looked at it before
[55:21] and you know you look at and when god
[55:23] talked about ephesians he said
[55:24] it's his pleasure his pleasure not
[55:29] not my pleasure his pleasure
[55:33] now see when i have when i have a desire
[55:35] and that desire gets met
[55:37] then it becomes my pleasure amen
[55:41] when i desire you know maybe maybe a a
[55:44] piece of chocolate cake then when i get
[55:47] that it it becomes
[55:48] my pleasure when you desire something a
[55:52] deep calleth to the deep once you have
[55:54] received it then it becomes a pleasure
[55:56] and see god this this whole creation was
[55:59] was designed by god to fulfill his
[56:01] pleasure
[56:03] and so here we are the bride is created
[56:05] to fulfill
[56:06] his pleasure and so when paul said there
[56:09] in verse 38 and chapter 10 he said now
[56:11] the
[56:12] just shall live by faith
[56:16] the justified shall live by faith now
[56:19] you'll look over in romans as we see
[56:21] that
[56:21] just shall live by faith we'll go to
[56:22] romans 8 and 29 are we
[56:24] familiar familiar this evening and and i
[56:27] don't bring anything
[56:28] different but amen i trust the lord will
[56:31] just unveil what's there to us
[56:34] romans 8 and 29 for whom
[56:38] he did for no
[56:41] when did he foreknow us we all know
[56:44] before the foundation of the world he
[56:47] knew us
[56:48] he knew who we were he knew he'd be
[56:50] sitting here he knew what you'd go
[56:51] through today he knew what you'll go
[56:52] through tomorrow
[56:53] he knows everything about us he for knew
[56:55] who we were when god was there when he
[56:57] was elohim when he was sitting there he
[56:59] knew who
[56:59] he had us in his mind when he when he
[57:01] when my when he was sitting there
[57:03] thinking he was thinking of us
[57:05] amen you've got to realize for whom he
[57:08] did for no
[57:09] and he didn't just think about us but he
[57:11] also had the power that he did
[57:13] predestinate
[57:15] that also he did predestinate to be
[57:17] conformed
[57:18] to the image of his son so he had a plan
[57:22] not to be conformed to an image of a
[57:23] church or an idea or a thought but to
[57:25] his son
[57:26] that he might be the firstborn among
[57:29] many brethren
[57:30] so what he was we are wherever he goes
[57:33] amen we're going also for wherever the
[57:36] head goes the body follows
[57:38] so if he was predestined if he was
[57:40] foreknown if
[57:41] if he was slain before the foundation of
[57:43] the world there was a purpose
[57:44] and when he was raised up there was a
[57:46] reason amen and we're going with him
[57:49] tonight we're
[57:49] recognizing to be the firstborn among
[57:52] many brethren
[57:53] moreover whom he did predestinate
[57:58] [Music]
[57:59] them he also called wow he had a plan
[58:04] he had a pla he didn't just you know
[58:06] brother brandon said he didn't hang on
[58:07] calvary hoping somebody feels sorry for
[58:09] him
[58:10] he didn't hang on caliber and hope we
[58:11] could get emotional some preacher could
[58:13] preach you into some
[58:14] some some you know persuades you to feel
[58:17] sorry for god because he hung on a cross
[58:19] and that you might get saved
[58:21] but see but when he knew you he
[58:23] predestinated you to be conformed to
[58:24] that image
[58:25] against your own better judgment you're
[58:27] coming to his penalty
[58:28] to his plan this evening
[58:32] so then he also quotes when he calls you
[58:34] he has a purpose and calling
[58:36] then he also called in whom he called
[58:40] them he called then he also justified
[58:44] and whom he justified now listen the
[58:47] just
[58:48] shall live by faith that justified shall
[58:50] live by faith
[58:51] and if we're living by faith then we're
[58:53] going to something that is unseen
[58:56] amen there's something that we're
[58:58] walking towards we're living by faith
[59:00] them he also
[59:04] glorified so this isn't the end of it he
[59:07] said be patient to sit in the end of it
[59:09] how many feels glorified amen in ourself
[59:13] we don't feel glorified
[59:15] amen we've got aches and pains and
[59:16] sickness and sorrows and depressions and
[59:19] and all kinds of disappointments but yet
[59:21] there's a glorification in our life
[59:23] amen that is drawing us to a place and
[59:25] as this word is spoken and lived
[59:27] it is calling to a bride this evening
[59:31] amen there's a sharp stone mason it is
[59:34] cutting us
[59:34] amen to unveil to us who we really are
[59:38] so hear the justice of my face so we see
[59:40] that we are going to a glorified state
[59:43] in mind
[59:43] i believe that the glorification is not
[59:45] even of us
[59:47] but it's what he thought of us now
[59:50] brother branham preached in the
[59:51] unveiling of god
[59:55] he says this after reading the scripture
[59:57] in second corinthians and
[59:59] and over in philippians talking about
[1:00:02] how that
[1:00:03] how that why that jesus christ
[1:00:06] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:00:08] god but took on himself of
[1:00:11] no reputation took on himself of
[1:00:15] of no reputation he wasn't going to be
[1:00:17] anything in this world
[1:00:20] he didn't want the name of this world he
[1:00:23] but then he comes down and he speaks
[1:00:25] this he says now i'm a subject this
[1:00:27] morning
[1:00:28] i trust that god will reveal this
[1:00:32] i trust that god will reveal this and
[1:00:35] each time if you who take the tapes and
[1:00:37] listen and i hope and trust that you
[1:00:38] have had a spiritual understanding of
[1:00:41] what
[1:00:41] that god has been trying to get over to
[1:00:43] the church without saying it
[1:00:44] right out there
[1:00:48] you know before when brother branham
[1:00:50] started this message you go back and
[1:00:51] listen to it he's
[1:00:52] he's talking about how that for for
[1:00:54] several months it seems god been dealing
[1:00:56] with him on this
[1:00:57] subject but out in out in the field he
[1:00:59] couldn't preach it because it
[1:01:01] it takes too long he said i try to keep
[1:01:04] it a 30-40 minutes out in the field
[1:01:06] he said but but here he come back to the
[1:01:08] tabernacle after he'd been out in tucson
[1:01:10] and he came back to the tabernacle and
[1:01:11] he said but now i've got the tape set up
[1:01:13] i've got everything and i'm wanting to
[1:01:15] to speak this
[1:01:17] and and and i'm i'm of the nature that
[1:01:19] believes that brother branham had no
[1:01:20] idea what was going on
[1:01:23] but i believe there was something inside
[1:01:24] of brother branham that was desiring to
[1:01:27] preach this
[1:01:28] not because he knew what it was but i
[1:01:30] believe god even under the
[1:01:31] even even bypassing man's understanding
[1:01:35] that god was speaking something to who
[1:01:38] not to even the tabernacle there but to
[1:01:39] a bride somebody because he comes down
[1:01:42] and his brother abraham's talking he
[1:01:43] said oh that those even that get the
[1:01:44] tapes
[1:01:47] see god doesn't stop in 1965.
[1:01:50] god didn't die back there amen but god
[1:01:53] even today when those tapes are played
[1:01:55] amen when we said under the presence of
[1:01:57] the preaching of the word
[1:01:59] amen it's not just a man or we don't
[1:02:01] gather under some idea
[1:02:03] amen but god said by the foolishness of
[1:02:05] preaching
[1:02:06] i've chose to save them which
[1:02:09] believe and whether we don't preach to
[1:02:12] save the unbeliever we preach to save
[1:02:14] them which believe
[1:02:16] why because under the power of the word
[1:02:18] under the beyond our understanding
[1:02:20] there's god is doing something in the
[1:02:22] midst of his word
[1:02:23] amen when the sun comes out the seed
[1:02:26] don't understand what it is
[1:02:27] but something down on the inside of is
[1:02:29] pulling out of him
[1:02:31] what does it want to do it's wanting to
[1:02:33] go back to where he come from
[1:02:35] oh saints we don't gather in church that
[1:02:37] everybody might see us
[1:02:38] but we gather in church amen that god is
[1:02:41] recognizing
[1:02:42] that the son has come out upon us and he
[1:02:45] has drawn us unto himself
[1:02:48] oh my we're not drawn to one another but
[1:02:50] we're drawn to the god in
[1:02:51] each other amen when light recognizes
[1:02:55] light
[1:02:55] amen we come together amen what does
[1:02:58] that omnipotent might meet and
[1:02:59] something's going to happen
[1:03:02] might not even be something we see
[1:03:05] but we are confident we are
[1:03:09] confident we are confident
[1:03:14] that what god won't lose a one of us
[1:03:18] amen that he's gonna he's not gonna lose
[1:03:23] before we get to glorification he's not
[1:03:26] gonna lose us
[1:03:29] and every step we take is getting us
[1:03:31] there
[1:03:34] every one of them brother talked about
[1:03:36] weakness amen in all of our weaknesses
[1:03:38] when paul said
[1:03:39] oh lord take this in permanency take
[1:03:41] this weakness away from me
[1:03:43] that infirmity we realized was a desire
[1:03:46] to be
[1:03:46] what paul couldn't be in himself
[1:03:50] because there was a life living down
[1:03:51] inside of paul that said yeah i'm dead
[1:03:53] yet i liveth why
[1:03:54] he said none of myself but by the faith
[1:03:57] of the son of god
[1:03:59] something in paul was living hold on
[1:04:02] something in his bride tonight is
[1:04:04] living her mind is bringing himself out
[1:04:07] it's bringing itself
[1:04:08] out and so here brother brandon he was
[1:04:12] saying look he said now of you that take
[1:04:14] the tapes of you that are here and you
[1:04:15] that are less than you that are
[1:04:18] he said you that had a spiritual
[1:04:20] understanding of what god has been
[1:04:21] trying to get over to the church without
[1:04:23] saying it
[1:04:25] right out see it's a thing sometimes we
[1:04:28] have to say things in such a way that it
[1:04:30] may thin
[1:04:31] down amen
[1:04:34] why because listen an unveiling is
[1:04:36] taking
[1:04:37] the unveiling is taking the sheet down
[1:04:39] and you see it
[1:04:41] the unveiling is also when that rock of
[1:04:43] of of
[1:04:45] of david or moses hell that that the
[1:04:47] great uh
[1:04:48] artist uh
[1:04:51] michelangelo was was was chopping away
[1:04:54] every
[1:04:54] every stroke that he took upon that rock
[1:04:56] amen it was beginning to show the
[1:04:58] unveiling of what was deeper in that
[1:05:00] rock
[1:05:01] amen we know that rock is a revelation
[1:05:04] it's not a revelation of a person or a
[1:05:05] church or anything but it's the
[1:05:07] revelation of who he really is
[1:05:09] amen and peter realized one day that
[1:05:11] might thou art the christ
[1:05:14] so we see that even even flesh and blood
[1:05:16] is not going to reveal this to us
[1:05:20] our flesh and blood is not going to
[1:05:21] bring about
[1:05:25] what god's wanting of us
[1:05:28] i don't know how to say it any other way
[1:05:29] our flesh and blood is not going to
[1:05:31] bring about what god wants of us
[1:05:34] we can we we can we can stand in front
[1:05:36] of the mirror all night and trying to
[1:05:37] make ourselves look perfect for god but
[1:05:40] it's not going to bring them about
[1:05:42] we can lay in the presence of this bible
[1:05:43] and read and read and read and read and
[1:05:45] read in our intellect and it's still not
[1:05:47] going to bring us to what god is
[1:05:48] desiring of us
[1:05:50] amen because if we're reading this thing
[1:05:52] hoping that we can prove somebody else
[1:05:54] wrong guess what
[1:05:57] amen but look because that we are we are
[1:06:00] that that's on the inside of us that
[1:06:01] opens the book and it is beginning to
[1:06:03] unfold to us see i don't we don't pick
[1:06:05] up this book trying to
[1:06:06] trying to learn or study or do anything
[1:06:08] we read this because my
[1:06:10] our lover left us a love letter
[1:06:13] oh my there's something inside of us
[1:06:15] that longs to be into contact with him
[1:06:18] amen if you ever got a letter from your
[1:06:20] lover hey man yo you'll know if they're
[1:06:22] far away on a in a foreign land amen you
[1:06:25] get that letter that's the closest thing
[1:06:26] you got to them
[1:06:28] so you'll pick you'll pick that letter
[1:06:29] up mine you'll begin to read that
[1:06:31] you'll smell that thing why because
[1:06:33] you're trying to get just a little bit
[1:06:35] of that that wrote the letter you're
[1:06:36] doing everything you're reading between
[1:06:38] the lines you're thinking about what
[1:06:40] were they doing what were they saying
[1:06:41] when they went to bed at eight o'clock
[1:06:43] what were they meaning when oh my when
[1:06:45] david
[1:06:46] slept over there with with my sheep but
[1:06:48] what is my lover trying to tell me
[1:06:51] what is he trying to show me what is he
[1:06:54] trying to deliver
[1:06:55] in this hour my lord what is it it's
[1:06:57] become because this thing is is
[1:06:59] beginning to
[1:07:00] come to us so watch now in that in that
[1:07:03] cutting away and that thinning down it
[1:07:05] it might bring some to go out
[1:07:08] it might have some to leave and some to
[1:07:11] ponder over
[1:07:13] see he's placing he's unveiling
[1:07:16] each one remember we said we're
[1:07:20] unveiling you
[1:07:21] the word has come to unveil who you are
[1:07:26] amen why do some why do some get mad and
[1:07:28] leave because that's who they are
[1:07:30] amen why do some fall back because
[1:07:33] that's who they are
[1:07:34] amen but the just or who they are they
[1:07:37] live by
[1:07:38] faith amen what is faith there's
[1:07:40] something down inside of you
[1:07:42] longing amen
[1:07:45] hebrews 11 chapter now paul paul laid
[1:07:48] out over there
[1:07:50] that the just are going to live my faith
[1:07:52] he talked about if you go back and read
[1:07:53] all of hebrews the tenth and you'll see
[1:07:55] my he's talking about the passing away
[1:07:57] of the law the
[1:07:58] bringing in of the the light and the the
[1:08:00] reality and
[1:08:01] but then he as all of that comes across
[1:08:03] but then he brings it down and we read
[1:08:05] how that that cast's not away therefore
[1:08:07] your confidence
[1:08:08] and the just shall live by faith faith
[1:08:12] and we are not of them who draw back
[1:08:13] unto perdition but
[1:08:17] of them that believe to the saving of
[1:08:20] the soul
[1:08:21] [Music]
[1:08:23] and how how how god had paul to write
[1:08:26] that
[1:08:28] because we'll look at it we say mother
[1:08:32] of the just shall live by faith but if
[1:08:35] any man draw back
[1:08:37] my soul shall have no pleasure in him
[1:08:40] right there a lot of people will pick up
[1:08:41] doubt
[1:08:43] preacher will pick that up they'll
[1:08:45] they'll they'll run somebody into the
[1:08:47] ground thinking
[1:08:48] man you're falling back
[1:08:51] you're falling back you're doing this
[1:08:53] you're doing that you're doing this
[1:08:54] you're doing that and you're falling
[1:08:55] back
[1:08:56] but see paul comes right back around and
[1:08:58] speaks to the bride
[1:08:59] he comes right back and says but we are
[1:09:02] not of them
[1:09:04] see paul is showing he is discerning
[1:09:07] between the two so it's not paul it's
[1:09:09] the word and it's discerning
[1:09:10] the just lived by faith the ju everybody
[1:09:13] else falls back by the just now
[1:09:15] now in the unveiling of you then it
[1:09:18] becomes personal it's not about the
[1:09:20] unveiling of a church
[1:09:22] he's not unveiling a church tonight he's
[1:09:24] unveiling you you don't come together
[1:09:27] amen that we find out where the church
[1:09:28] is
[1:09:29] we come together under the power of the
[1:09:30] word standing in his presence lord
[1:09:33] who am i amen and then god begins to
[1:09:36] show who we are because as he speaks
[1:09:39] amen we begin to hear things others
[1:09:40] don't hear we begin to see things
[1:09:43] others don't see we begin to gather and
[1:09:45] desire things others don't desire
[1:09:47] because there's something down the
[1:09:48] inside of us ain't mean it was there
[1:09:50] before the foundation of the world
[1:09:52] it was god's foreknowledge spoken word
[1:09:55] amen and it's coming to pass in this
[1:09:56] hour
[1:10:00] it's a mystery
[1:10:03] it's a mystery how the two people can
[1:10:06] sit in church
[1:10:07] side by side and brother you know you've
[1:10:09] heard anything well he called me a buzz
[1:10:10] and
[1:10:11] he over here he called me an eagle amen
[1:10:15] but you know it's coming down into that
[1:10:17] hour where we're here and
[1:10:19] some people are hear themselves oh my
[1:10:21] i'll never make it i'll i'll never be no
[1:10:23] good
[1:10:23] i'll never do this i'll be falling back
[1:10:25] all the time but others hear my
[1:10:27] others here but we're not of those glory
[1:10:31] there i
[1:10:31] am there i am
[1:10:35] am i because the judge shall live there
[1:10:36] i am amen but we're not paul said we are
[1:10:39] not as many
[1:10:41] amen that pervert the word we're not who
[1:10:43] am i i'm not as many
[1:10:45] see we we hear different things others
[1:10:47] will read that love story and by they'll
[1:10:48] hear
[1:10:49] they'll hear the bad stuff hey remember
[1:10:51] the bride all she hears is the love
[1:10:52] letter
[1:10:53] to her heart she recognizes who he is
[1:10:56] so she sees herself in him this evening
[1:11:01] oh my oh my because watch now in
[1:11:05] hebrews 11th chapter
[1:11:08] hebrews 11 chapter
[1:11:12] verse 1. now faith
[1:11:16] is the substance
[1:11:20] that word we know is the realization
[1:11:25] it's the it's the real realization
[1:11:31] you know job looked at it one time and
[1:11:32] he said
[1:11:34] i've heard and i've heard and i've heard
[1:11:36] but now i see
[1:11:39] i've heard i've heard of her but but now
[1:11:41] i see
[1:11:43] because you're here and you're here and
[1:11:44] you're here and it doesn't change
[1:11:45] anything
[1:11:46] but when you see it changes everything
[1:11:50] i've heard the message i've heard the
[1:11:51] message i've heard the message i've
[1:11:52] heard the message but do you see the
[1:11:53] message
[1:11:55] see
[1:12:00] it's not a denomination that we're just
[1:12:02] getting to be a part of
[1:12:05] amen revelations 10 out there when he
[1:12:08] come down to another mighty angel he
[1:12:09] said who was they said that's none other
[1:12:11] than christ
[1:12:13] amen oh my the messenger
[1:12:16] was christ and so it come down to where
[1:12:18] listen we're not gathered around just
[1:12:20] just an idea we're not gathered around a
[1:12:22] thought
[1:12:23] we're gathered around a person
[1:12:26] amen and and watch now because here he
[1:12:30] says now faith
[1:12:31] is the s the realization of things hoped
[1:12:35] for
[1:12:37] the realization oh just
[1:12:42] you know outside that door we could say
[1:12:44] you know there's
[1:12:46] there's a new car and more you can start
[1:12:48] imagining
[1:12:50] you could almost get excited you could
[1:12:53] almost shout and jump and sing songs
[1:12:55] about it
[1:12:57] come on you'd start testifying
[1:13:00] glory to god there's a car out there for
[1:13:02] me
[1:13:05] but something could happen along the way
[1:13:07] somebody could beat you to the door and
[1:13:08] all of a sudden your hopes would be
[1:13:09] smashed
[1:13:11] you'd be depressed you know you might
[1:13:15] you might trip break your leg not be
[1:13:16] able to get there
[1:13:18] your phone might ring somebody get you
[1:13:19] on the line and then you know it's kind
[1:13:21] of like the
[1:13:22] pull of bethesda see there was a hope of
[1:13:26] oh if if i can get there
[1:13:30] oh if i ca or if i can just and see
[1:13:32] that's where the church has been under
[1:13:34] for seven ages
[1:13:35] if we can do anything oh my we want to
[1:13:37] do our best
[1:13:40] but all alone there's been something
[1:13:42] about a bride in this hour he's pulled
[1:13:44] the veil off of who god was
[1:13:45] but when he pulled the veil off of who
[1:13:47] god was it began to show her who she was
[1:13:49] because we find over in revelations over
[1:13:51] there in the fifth chapter when john
[1:13:53] got the veil pulled off and he
[1:13:55] recognized who he really was
[1:13:56] amen in all of heaven under earth
[1:13:59] everybody above earth
[1:14:00] everybody in heaven heard out john
[1:14:02] saying why
[1:14:03] because brother brown said he saw when
[1:14:05] that book was crossing the hands
[1:14:07] he said i saw my name there what was it
[1:14:10] is the realization
[1:14:12] oh saints is the realization that we've
[1:14:14] already made it
[1:14:16] it's the realization amen there's
[1:14:18] nothing can stop us now
[1:14:19] it's the realization amen as the quarter
[1:14:22] is in my hand
[1:14:23] amen it's better than that because
[1:14:26] faith is that substance to realization
[1:14:29] that's why he said what cast not
[1:14:31] assigned that confidence
[1:14:34] the realization and there's
[1:14:38] we're not we're not as paul said we're
[1:14:40] not as many but
[1:14:42] by believing this hour we are those
[1:14:46] that the justified are living by this
[1:14:51] faith faith is not just a hope so or
[1:14:54] something i learned in the bible and i
[1:14:55] now believe because he said it 2 000
[1:14:57] years ago

[1:16:05] amen there's
[1:16:06] no fear no doubt no pulling back on this
[1:16:09] thing
[1:16:10] we don't pull back and say we're
[1:16:11] glorified into the very presence of god
[1:16:13] then pull back and say but wait he might
[1:16:14] not want me no listen we're going on in
[1:16:16] because god has said we wanted us
[1:16:19] oh man you've heard it in your heart and
[1:16:21] there's a realization that
[1:16:22] nothing's going to stop me now oh my

[1:16:32] did the prophet of god pick up and
[1:16:33] preach
[1:16:34] preach a rapture on that over in psalms
[1:16:36] why because it's the confidence
[1:16:39] oh my that it's not in my ability that
[1:16:41] i'm taking a rapture
[1:16:42] it's in my confidence that in what god
[1:16:44] is saying amen he will fulfill in our
[1:16:46] life
[1:16:48] oh my the church has made us doubt for
[1:16:50] years the church has called us
[1:16:52] disappointment for years
[1:16:53] but i believe christ is coming this hour
[1:16:55] amen that he might find a bride ready
[1:16:58] [Music]
[1:16:59] and she is getting the understanding
[1:17:01] she's recognizing
[1:17:03] she's like moses when he walked up to
[1:17:05] the red sea bro steven
[1:17:06] he's he saw that road god unveiled that
[1:17:10] road to him and he said why stand you
[1:17:12] here

[1:17:16] now speaking
[1:17:18] she is now testifying again prophesied
[1:17:22] why because she has the word she knows
[1:17:24] what he wants done with him
[1:17:26] amen oh my we're not of the kind that's
[1:17:31] backing up saints
[1:17:32] we're not backing up into some
[1:17:34] denomination it says you better be
[1:17:35] careful
[1:17:36] we're walking into the very presence of
[1:17:38] almighty god where he
[1:17:39] careth for us oh bride listen
[1:17:44] listen hebrews it's the faith is the
[1:17:46] very substance of things hoped for
[1:17:48] the evidence of things not seen
[1:17:52] for by it the elders obtained a good
[1:17:55] report
[1:17:57] and through faith we understand
[1:18:00] that the worlds were framed by the word
[1:18:03] of god
[1:18:04] listen we didn't read it and just
[1:18:07] believe it
[1:18:08] [Music]
[1:18:10] but we were there
[1:18:14] oh my when that logos was a circling
[1:18:16] where were you
[1:18:19] amen when when that first clinker went
[1:18:22] off

[1:18:34] listen where were we through faith we
[1:18:36] understand why
[1:18:37] not because we read and understand and
[1:18:39] it sounds good but because he told us he
[1:18:41] showed us and we were there
[1:18:44] oh that's why the world don't understand
[1:18:45] us we're framed by the word of god so
[1:18:48] that things which are
[1:18:49] seen that we see
[1:18:53] others might not be seeing them little
[1:18:55] bride but you're seeing them
[1:18:57] they're going back and they're saying
[1:18:58] all right there's nothing to it there's
[1:18:59] nothing to it but we're still walking
[1:19:02] why because we've seen it we're not made
[1:19:04] of things which do appear
[1:19:06] in other words what we're seeing is not
[1:19:08] by things that are appearing around us
[1:19:10] but they are created and made by he that
[1:19:12] is unseen but yet he's speaking and
[1:19:14] talking and showing this little bride
[1:19:17] who she is amen
[1:19:21] and look in verse four and that's i want
[1:19:22] to get here and now we're trying not to

[1:20:07] i just want you to realize who's talking
[1:20:09] to you
[1:20:11] oh my i just want us to realize who's
[1:20:13] talking to us
[1:20:15] that's why brother branham said oh you
[1:20:17] that are spiritual in heaven and have an
[1:20:19] understanding he said without coming
[1:20:20] right out and saying it
[1:20:22] then when you pick up this bible and
[1:20:24] you're reading and it's telling you who
[1:20:25] you are you're hearing that tape and
[1:20:27] it's telling you who you are
[1:20:28] listen it's not some seventh grade
[1:20:30] educated kentuckian
[1:20:31] it's not some man we're not feeding on a
[1:20:33] man amen but there's something that is
[1:20:36] still
[1:20:36] and if we only realize who's telling us
[1:20:38] these things if we only realize the one
[1:20:40] that's brought us this far
[1:20:42] if we only realize the one that's
[1:20:44] showing us these things if we only
[1:20:45] realize who he really is
[1:20:47] amen that we can begin to realize who we
[1:20:49] really are
[1:20:50] glory glory if we only realize who's
[1:20:54] talking to us
[1:20:56] oh my who wakes you up in the middle of
[1:20:58] the night who talks to you throughout
[1:20:59] the day
[1:21:00] who draws you into his presence who
[1:21:02] calls for you to step
[1:21:03] amen when he tells you esther step
[1:21:06] forward when he lays out that scepter of
[1:21:07] his promise to you
[1:21:09] who is it is talking to us oh it's not
[1:21:12] some church thought
[1:21:13] amen but this is the very son of man of
[1:21:15] god come down made flesh among us in
[1:21:18] this hour
[1:21:18] where is he ah
[1:21:22] the realization of this bride is
[1:21:24] beginning to understand now
[1:21:27] oh my we ain't been listening why does
[1:21:29] everybody else go because all they can
[1:21:30] see is a man
[1:21:31] amen but she don't see the man she hears
[1:21:34] the god
[1:21:36] oh my the same one when she was there at
[1:21:38] the beginning of time
[1:21:39] when he was throwing stars out across
[1:21:41] the universe i mean that same voice is
[1:21:43] talking to her now
[1:21:45] oh my the same god
[1:21:48] why do you think before those seals
[1:21:50] could be opened he had to come down and
[1:21:52] restore the word back to the spoken word
[1:21:54] because this thing's not coming on a
[1:21:56] written word it's coming on a spoken
[1:21:58] word
[1:21:59] human education human ability
[1:22:03] human and smartness can read a word
[1:22:06] however it takes a supernatural god amen
[1:22:09] to speak a word
[1:22:10] oh and then it come to pass all saints
[1:22:14] if we'd only realize
[1:22:15] whose presence we're standing in if we
[1:22:17] only realize
[1:22:19] oh my this isn't some church you're
[1:22:21] gathering in but this is under the power
[1:22:23] of the word
[1:22:24] then when we gather on wednesdays and
[1:22:25] sundays amen we're standing under the
[1:22:28] power of god
[1:22:30] all to realize that we come and god is
[1:22:33] beginning to unveil us
[1:22:36] that we might see oh and it was
[1:22:39] excellent
[1:22:40] oh my that wasn't paul speaking
[1:22:44] that wasn't paul saying that his his his
[1:22:46] offering under god was that more
[1:22:48] excellent
[1:22:48] that was god saying that's excellent
[1:22:52] boy he put the seal of approval said
[1:22:53] that's excellent
[1:22:55] that's an excellent sacrifice than cain
[1:22:59] by which by watch now by which
[1:23:02] he obtained witness
[1:23:10] he obtained witness
[1:23:13] i want you to now go and you go into the
[1:23:15] court of law with me because a witness
[1:23:16] has to see something
[1:23:20] glory a witness has to see something
[1:23:25] he obtained somebody stood in the court
[1:23:29] of law and said do i have a witness
[1:23:32] and somebody stood up in abel's defense
[1:23:35] and said i'll stand and give witness
[1:23:37] oh my saints when we begin to realize
[1:23:42] oh they said some story you learned in
[1:23:44] sunday school
[1:23:45] oh but this is the very life of god
[1:23:47] being revealed in this hour
[1:23:49] this is the very presence of god coming
[1:23:52] down and making his bride realize who
[1:23:54] she is
[1:23:55] oh the world will keep going in church
[1:23:57] the world will keep running in the
[1:23:59] nomination
[1:24:00] but oh that little bride
[1:24:03] oh my she's obtained witness in this
[1:24:05] hour
[1:24:06] she has obtained witness in this hour
[1:24:10] oh glory to god
[1:24:13] now who's the witness that he was
[1:24:16] righteous
[1:24:17] god testifying glory
[1:24:21] oh brother so-and-so didn't say you were
[1:24:23] good enough
[1:24:24] oh but god testified oh that i am
[1:24:28] satisfied
[1:24:30] oh that my desire is met with your
[1:24:33] sacrifice
[1:24:35] oh oh but it's more than that saints
[1:24:39] oh it's more than that
[1:24:42] it's more than god just saying oh that's
[1:24:45] a good sacrifice
[1:24:48] that's more than god just saying
[1:24:51] eyewitness
[1:24:52] that's a good sacrifice that's more than
[1:24:55] him testifying
[1:24:57] go with me over into genesis go with me
[1:25:00] over to genesis
[1:25:01] look over here in revelations in the
[1:25:03] third fourth chapter
[1:25:05] and we see where paul picked it up and
[1:25:07] god was speaking through paul and he
[1:25:08] said
[1:25:10] in the first verse
[1:25:15] and adam knew eve his wife and she
[1:25:17] conceived and bear cain and said i had
[1:25:19] gotten a man from the lord
[1:25:21] and she again bear his brother abel and
[1:25:24] abel was a keeper of sheep
[1:25:26] but cain was a tiller of the ground
[1:25:29] and in process of time
[1:25:33] remember be patient
[1:25:38] be patient because in the process of
[1:25:41] time
[1:25:42] listen cain cain didn't just get mad at
[1:25:44] abel at one instance
[1:25:46] cain was building this anger at abel
[1:25:48] over a long time
[1:25:49] because abel was living a different life
[1:25:51] than cain was
[1:25:53] well they might have been walked they
[1:25:54] might have been coming to church with
[1:25:56] mom and dad
[1:25:58] they mean they might have been sitting
[1:25:59] at their feet at dinnertime and
[1:26:00] listening to mom and dad tell about the
[1:26:02] story in the garden
[1:26:04] they might have been hearing about what
[1:26:05] the serpent did and what god did and how
[1:26:08] he brought a sacrifice
[1:26:09] or gave him a lamb's clothe but in the
[1:26:12] preaching of that word somebody was
[1:26:14] hearing something different in that
[1:26:15] church service
[1:26:17] amen while he was unveiling who cain and
[1:26:19] abel really were
[1:26:20] it was beginning to show who they were
[1:26:23] it was beginning to unveil
[1:26:25] and that's oh my oh that's what made
[1:26:28] kane so mad
[1:26:30] that's why he turned around despised his
[1:26:32] brother abel
[1:26:34] whole mind because abraham he came with
[1:26:37] a different kind of sincerity
[1:26:40] and one day in the process of time when
[1:26:42] it was time to manifest
[1:26:44] what they had been hearing
[1:26:48] and when it comes time to manifest what
[1:26:51] all we've been hearing
[1:26:53] when it comes to a showdown
[1:26:56] when it come time for faith to speak
[1:26:58] expressly
[1:27:00] when it come time for something to be
[1:27:02] expressed something to be unveiled
[1:27:04] something to be shown amen it come in a
[1:27:06] process of time
[1:27:09] so be patient
[1:27:12] and able now watch it and in the present
[1:27:15] time it came to pass that cain brought
[1:27:17] of the fruit of the ground and offering
[1:27:19] unto the lord
[1:27:22] he came to church and gave his offering
[1:27:28] oh my brother brown said they both come
[1:27:29] to church they both did everything that
[1:27:32] my they they both worshipped
[1:27:36] am i oh you can't compare and look
[1:27:39] somebody one way somebody's a worshiper
[1:27:42] and just because somebody may be louder
[1:27:44] or something than you or doing something
[1:27:45] more
[1:27:46] that don't mean it's a worshipping god
[1:27:49] because the devil comes to church to
[1:27:50] worship
[1:27:52] the devil oh man he'll sing louder in
[1:27:54] the next guy
[1:27:56] come on he'll hey man shout sometimes
[1:27:58] louder i don't mean i'm going to quit
[1:28:00] shouting in amen and
[1:28:01] glory amen abel didn't stop
[1:28:04] worshiping just because cain was
[1:28:06] worshiping
[1:28:08] he didn't draw back he didn't draw back
[1:28:10] because somebody might think he's being
[1:28:12] a false devil
[1:28:14] oh no because when he come in the
[1:28:16] process watch now and once
[1:28:18] cain cain brought his offering
[1:28:22] unto the lord and then abel he also
[1:28:25] brought to the first things of his flock
[1:28:26] into the fat thereof
[1:28:30] and the lord had respect
[1:28:35] now the lord's not a respecter of
[1:28:37] persons
[1:28:40] but he is a respecter of his word
[1:28:43] come on he is a respecter of his word
[1:28:47] and he recognizes his word
[1:28:50] he recognizes when his word is returning
[1:28:53] unto him
[1:28:54] he recognizes when he is getting an amen
[1:28:57] according to the word
[1:28:59] oh he's not he's not
[1:29:03] now watch that word respect if you look
[1:29:05] it up you'll find out that word respect
[1:29:07] means
[1:29:09] to stare upon whoo
[1:29:13] to look at to notice
[1:29:18] i'll bring it up in the new testament to
[1:29:20] witness
[1:29:22] oh my god witnessed
[1:29:25] oh my something that caught his
[1:29:26] attention when abel
[1:29:28] look god was sitting up there in heaven
[1:29:30] and he was sitting there watching
[1:29:32] king brought up all the first slings of
[1:29:33] his are all the best fruits the biggest
[1:29:35] pumpkins the greatest squash
[1:29:36] amen the biggest worship he could ever
[1:29:38] brought
[1:29:40] and god was just looking off
[1:29:43] but all of a sudden he heard the
[1:29:44] blinking of a lamb and the blood running
[1:29:46] out he turned
[1:29:47] in the twinkling of an eye he looked and
[1:29:49] he saw abel and god right there
[1:29:51] respected he saw
[1:29:53] a something called god's attention
[1:29:56] oh my something that had been covered
[1:29:59] something that had been healed
[1:30:00] something that was unseen even god
[1:30:03] looked and saw
[1:30:05] that sacrifice what was he seeing he was
[1:30:08] seeing the
[1:30:09] understanding of that word that when
[1:30:12] that when adam and eve were standing up
[1:30:13] there preaching the word
[1:30:16] somebody was hearing oh my somebody was
[1:30:19] realizing
[1:30:20] oh my somebody was realizing when adam
[1:30:23] was telling him
[1:30:24] about the day he come home whole mind
[1:30:27] and god wasn't there anymore
[1:30:29] and they run off into the trees and adam
[1:30:32] was telling him all about the time that
[1:30:34] now they sowed they worked night and day
[1:30:36] [Music]
[1:30:37] pulling leaves off of trees hoping to
[1:30:40] find good grace to god
[1:30:42] working herself to death trying to sew
[1:30:44] up some aprons
[1:30:45] working herself to death hoping they'd
[1:30:47] find the cover and good enough
[1:30:49] to satisfy god but one day when god come
[1:30:53] looking
[1:30:56] he couldn't see him come on
[1:30:59] he couldn't see him oh my because he was
[1:31:02] looking for something
[1:31:03] god is looking for something inside he's
[1:31:06] not looking for anything
[1:31:08] well he's not looking for just any
[1:31:10] church he's not looking for just any
[1:31:12] woman
[1:31:13] he's looking for his wife oh
[1:31:16] my god so god said adam where art thou
[1:31:22] adam and run off out there showing lit
[1:31:24] fig leaves doing everything he could in
[1:31:26] church and god didn't see him
[1:31:28] but finally finally adam comes shaking
[1:31:30] up
[1:31:32] here we are laura it's my wife she she
[1:31:36] told me
[1:31:37] she turned around and said well it's a
[1:31:38] servant beguiled me god throwed the
[1:31:41] sacrifice on

[1:31:45] abel this story
[1:31:47] came just he was still enamored with the
[1:31:50] fig leaves
[1:31:51] he said i wonder how in the world he
[1:31:53] sewed them together
[1:31:55] i wonder you know kane his mind would
[1:31:57] drift in church and thinking about them
[1:31:59] fig leaves and
[1:32:00] my but i i see he think about the figs
[1:32:04] you know maybe the fruits that was
[1:32:05] growing on the fig tree you know he
[1:32:06] started to think about the beautiful
[1:32:08] fruits and
[1:32:08] see he began to unveil who he really was
[1:32:12] amen but abel he constantly he'd go out
[1:32:14] there and he'd look at them sheep he was
[1:32:16] attending to
[1:32:17] oh my daily he began to think and he
[1:32:19] began to grow
[1:32:21] he began to realize that what that sheep
[1:32:23] was all about he began to realize that
[1:32:25] there was more than just some pet
[1:32:27] he began to realize it's more than just
[1:32:28] some clothing he began to realize
[1:32:30] it was more than just some attire or
[1:32:32] dress amen but he began to realize
[1:32:34] that was his savior he began to realize
[1:32:37] that was the very desire of god
[1:32:39] amen that he might have fellowship
[1:32:43] and what was it abel desired fellowship
[1:32:46] [Music]
[1:32:47] oh my why because that was what was
[1:32:48] poured into him from his father
[1:32:50] he wanted fellowship with god again
[1:32:54] he wanted god to recognize him
[1:32:57] he wanted god to see him
[1:33:02] oh prophet of god told a story about
[1:33:04] that little girl standing on the street
[1:33:05] corner
[1:33:06] waving at the queen and the king rolling
[1:33:09] by
[1:33:10] she's over there just to crying and
[1:33:11] going on and daddy said did you not see
[1:33:13] her
[1:33:14] she said oh yeah i saw her but i don't
[1:33:17] know if she saw me
[1:33:19] see that's where it is to the believer
[1:33:23] she don't get up and dance trying to
[1:33:25] trying to trying to trying to just see
[1:33:27] him
[1:33:28] she wants what him to see her
[1:33:32] oh my what is that's the desire of her
[1:33:34] heart
[1:33:37] that's the desire of her heart is that
[1:33:39] oh lord that you'd see me so he said
[1:33:41] there what was it
[1:33:42] unto abel and his or he had respect
[1:33:45] in other words what was unseen became
[1:33:47] seen
[1:33:48] was it something that you couldn't see
[1:33:50] now become visible
[1:33:52] now the greek word there that form i've
[1:33:53] been looking for it all day yesterday
[1:33:55] trying to think of it was and i find
[1:33:57] coming
[1:33:57] with this word in in morphe now we all
[1:33:59] know this here it's spelled and he goes
[1:34:02] on and spells it looking in the greek
[1:34:04] to find out what in morphe was i may
[1:34:06] pronounce that wrong but the reason i
[1:34:08] spelt it when if a tape is released the
[1:34:10] people with scholars will know
[1:34:12] what i mean by it
[1:34:15] we don't have to be a scholar to know
[1:34:17] what he means by it
[1:34:19] amen he said
[1:34:23] when if tape was released and scholars
[1:34:25] said know what i mean he said when in a
[1:34:26] morphe that means that he changed
[1:34:28] his self he come down
[1:34:32] now the greek word there means that
[1:34:33] something
[1:34:35] that could not be seen yet it's
[1:34:39] there and then it's
[1:34:42] changed and the eye can catch it
[1:34:47] amen now something that's not there
[1:34:50] something that's
[1:34:51] veiled or covered but when a morphe
[1:34:53] comes
[1:34:55] it takes that unseen and makes it
[1:34:57] visible
[1:34:58] amen so watch now watch now in paradox
[1:35:01] brother brahm talks about
[1:35:03] he said now it's a paradox i believe
[1:35:06] that the same god that fell on the day
[1:35:07] of pentecost upon his church was a
[1:35:09] pillar of fire
[1:35:10] and divided himself with cloven tongues
[1:35:12] among his people is here
[1:35:13] tonight it's the same
[1:35:17] god he was then he is today with the
[1:35:20] same holy ghost
[1:35:21] i know it's a paradox it cannot be
[1:35:23] explained
[1:35:24] emotion screaming crying and so forth
[1:35:27] cannot be
[1:35:28] explained but it's a paradox
[1:35:32] how god does it it's the unseen
[1:35:35] god dwelling in the human heart
[1:35:41] making his self visible
[1:35:44] by vindicating his word
[1:35:47] what is the vindicated word is when the
[1:35:49] word that it spoke comes to pass
[1:35:51] when it's manifested then it becomes
[1:35:53] light thus it's vindicated
[1:35:56] so we're listen when when when the word
[1:35:59] when god is speaking and somebody is
[1:36:01] hearing
[1:36:02] then when that begins to come to pass
[1:36:03] when we are patient and wait and we see
[1:36:05] it
[1:36:06] it's vindicated but who's doing the
[1:36:08] vindicating it's not us
[1:36:11] it's in more faith god living in us
[1:36:15] so we see that it's listen we live by
[1:36:18] faith
[1:36:19] because we're justified because we
[1:36:21] realize
[1:36:23] oh my this ain't me doing it
[1:36:31] you know we often say it's not listen
[1:36:33] it's not the preacher preaching
[1:36:37] then it can't be the listener listening
[1:36:41] [Music]
[1:36:44] amen
[1:36:46] [Applause]
[1:36:47] amen oh glory
[1:36:50] oh my see
[1:36:54] it's not god on the platform but it's
[1:36:57] god in your heart
[1:36:59] and when he hears his word whom i
[1:37:02] respond
[1:37:03] so what is he saying he's saying abel i
[1:37:06] see you
[1:37:07] who am i and it's abel speaking back to
[1:37:10] god
[1:37:10] saying i see you and now it's what it's
[1:37:13] to having fellowship
[1:37:15] now we're not alone anymore now it's god
[1:37:18] in us
[1:37:18] living through us oh saints is not us
[1:37:22] walking anymore
[1:37:25] the church has walked age after age
[1:37:29] not knowing this
[1:37:33] but in this hour god has pulled his
[1:37:34] little bride to his side
[1:37:37] and began to tell her the secrets of her
[1:37:39] heart
[1:37:42] lord why do i feel this way i got a
[1:37:45] message for you
[1:37:46] oh oh god why did this happen i'll tell
[1:37:50] you
[1:37:50] lord where's my life like this let me
[1:37:53] show you
[1:37:54] oh my you're sinning church and god
[1:37:56] talks to you
[1:37:57] oh god thank you lord see pentecostal
[1:38:01] wants to take all the attention just to
[1:38:03] healing
[1:38:03] but god wants to vindicate his word to
[1:38:06] your heart
[1:38:07] or this bride is recognizing
[1:38:11] oh my this isn't just a church
[1:38:16] and i'm not just another person
[1:38:20] but i'm his the unveiling
[1:38:24] the unveiling coming together miles
[1:38:27] let's bring it down right here i want to
[1:38:28] read in timothy
[1:38:31] timothy i'm gonna bypass a few things
[1:38:32] i'll read this in a second timothy
[1:38:35] why god tell me
[1:38:38] tell us lord what second timothy chapter
[1:38:42] three and verse
[1:38:43] three we know the in the end to be
[1:38:45] perilous times
[1:38:49] but i want you to look at something
[1:38:51] because
[1:38:52] there was something about adam that god
[1:38:55] looked at and saw
[1:38:56] and had respect too amen
[1:39:00] second timothy chapter three and verse
[1:39:03] 33
[1:39:07] without natural affection truth breakers
[1:39:10] talking about the end time false
[1:39:11] accusers
[1:39:12] and consonant fierce watch
[1:39:15] think of cain and abel now despisers of
[1:39:19] those
[1:39:21] that are good listen
[1:39:24] read the word for what it says and hear
[1:39:25] it and realize those
[1:39:28] that are good
[1:39:31] they don't despise you because you do
[1:39:33] good
[1:39:34] he said well they don't like me because
[1:39:35] i wear a skirt no that's not why they
[1:39:37] don't like you
[1:39:40] oh they don't like me because i'm in a
[1:39:41] message no that's not why they don't
[1:39:42] like you
[1:39:43] they don't like me because i go to
[1:39:44] church all the time though that's not
[1:39:45] why they like
[1:39:46] don't like you they don't like you
[1:39:48] because you are good
[1:39:50] there's a big difference between doing
[1:39:52] good and being good
[1:39:54] amen why because jesus comes when a rich
[1:39:57] young ruler runs up to jesus said good
[1:39:58] master
[1:39:59] jesus turns around and says there's none
[1:40:01] good
[1:40:02] but god
[1:40:06] now we're beginning to see it clearly
[1:40:07] now it's beginning to unveil who we
[1:40:09] really
[1:40:09] are oh they don't hate you because
[1:40:13] you're a goody two
[1:40:14] they don't hate you because you're
[1:40:16] packing a message they don't hate you
[1:40:18] because you wear this or do that
[1:40:19] they hate you because you are god
[1:40:23] glory they hate you because of why the
[1:40:26] creator
[1:40:27] has come down to take possession of his
[1:40:30] earth
[1:40:31] they hate you because god has come to
[1:40:34] claim that which is rightfully
[1:40:36] his he paid it on calvary but now he's
[1:40:39] come to claim it
[1:40:40] or when will they hate you when will
[1:40:43] they turn everything against you
[1:40:46] oh my when in these end times in these
[1:40:48] perilous times
[1:40:51] oh saints they don't hate us just

[1:51:06] that the law was something
[1:51:10] that was always pointing to something to

[1:51:13] and there has been a time in our life
[1:51:16] that temporarily
[1:51:20] i'm not boasting but i'm just telling
[1:51:22] you so you know what happened
[1:51:25] i'm not boasting but i'm just telling
[1:51:28] you so you know what happened
[1:51:30] god permitted
[1:51:34] us to be somewhere temporarily
[1:51:39] almost like under the law
[1:51:42] but that was not what god was looking
[1:51:46] for
[1:51:47] amen god heed
[1:51:50] something and what he hid
[1:51:55] was what you were lacking in your life
[1:52:00] to bring you exactly where he wanted to
[1:52:04] you
[1:52:05] amen that's why we were going
[1:52:08] and it seems like things were not
[1:52:10] changing
[1:52:12] it seems like things were getting harder
[1:52:16] and harder in our life like we can't get
[1:52:19] victory on what we were doing
[1:52:22] we were on the first step amen
[1:52:26] but god came and shook everything away
[1:52:30] amen he allowed that chaos
[1:52:34] to happen so that god can pull you out
[1:52:40] to bring you the unveiling of the word
[1:52:45] and the word unveiling unto you
[1:52:48] begin to talk to the word that was
[1:52:52] always laying in you amen
[1:52:56] and now the message become clear
[1:52:59] and you begin to understand things
[1:53:01] better
[1:53:03] it has nothing to do with brother
[1:53:05] stephen
[1:53:07] there are stuff that are preached here
[1:53:09] that are never seen before
[1:53:12] there are things that i continue to see
[1:53:14] day
[1:53:15] and day that i never seen before
[1:53:18] it is not me it is god
[1:53:22] preaching through the preacher and in
[1:53:25] god
[1:53:26] in you listening to himself
[1:53:29] [Music]
[1:53:31] amen will begin to pull you in church
[1:53:35] every day
[1:53:37] what makes you to have joy to come to
[1:53:39] church
[1:53:40] they say churches at two o'clock
[1:53:42] everybody's there
[1:53:43] at two o'clock it is not you it is god
[1:53:47] coming to listen to god and when two
[1:53:51] omnipotent
[1:53:52] meets
[1:53:57] the guarding you and the god in the
[1:54:00] preacher
[1:54:01] then the miraculous begin to take place
[1:54:05] don't force yourself to quit something
[1:54:08] just lay put your car in neutral
[1:54:11] get united with the world and you're
[1:54:14] gonna see
[1:54:15] later but later things begin to be
[1:54:18] chipped away
[1:54:19] in your life without any effort
[1:54:23] and all will be based on faith
[1:54:26] which is given by grace and paul says so
[1:54:29] nobody can boast
[1:54:34] hallelujah it's gonna be all
[1:54:38] grace that's the reason why certain
[1:54:42] things has been
[1:54:43] tougher amen it is god
[1:54:47] ambushing you
[1:54:51] hallelujah you have been praying for
[1:54:54] something it is not working
[1:54:56] god knows that if he give it to you
[1:55:00] now you cannot handle it

[1:55:06] all your impurity all your anger
[1:55:10] all your religious spirit all your proud
[1:55:14] everything begin to come up on the
[1:55:16] surface

[1:55:22] banquet before you go to the second one
[1:55:26] amen you cannot destroy a man
[1:55:30] with the first banquet in the first
[1:55:32] banquet airmen was sitting and he was
[1:55:34] happy

[1:57:37] fellowship

[1:57:54] and any impurity from the
[1:57:57] denominational spirit in the message
[1:58:01] that religious demon in the message
[1:58:04] that made you treat a woman like a slave

[1:59:16] it is not intellectualism it is not
[1:59:19] sitting
[1:59:20] arguing about doctrine we had that for
[1:59:22] years
[1:59:23] and the people did not even know what
[1:59:25] they were believing
