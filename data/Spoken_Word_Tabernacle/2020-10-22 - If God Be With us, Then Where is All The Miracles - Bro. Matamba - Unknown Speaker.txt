reason for the hotel praise god you know we is that too loud or something praise the lord now uh we had quite a time trying to get here from charlotte and the 85 was blocked and so forth and and i asked the police officer what's the matter is that the president is in town and uh but he encouraged me that if you'll just wait here a little bit you know the road will be cleared so we are so happy to be here and i thought my what a difference when jesus is in town nobody knows but you that know you are blessed jesus christ is in our midst tonight and we thank him for his presence i certainly appreciate brother stephen giving me the opportunity to come and i really appreciate brother stephen i i remember when he first came from the congo and very young and i could see that love for the word of god was there and i knew the lord had something in store for the young man so we thank the lord that he has given him this wonderful wonderful ministry my god my god when he came and spoke for us a few times you know the people who you know follow us online they say who was that preacher who preached that wednesday night i said brother stephen shame said oh that was magnificent so we certainly thank the lord for this ministry it's not his ministry it's me the ministry of the lord jesus christ and we all are the beneficiaries of that ministry and we thank the lord for that and so tonight just uh just to get acquainted a little bit with the place and you know uh we're not going to be lengthy i know it's wednesday night but it's just good to see all the folks here my pressing the battle knowing the coming of the lord is very near so let's just read for a little short talk here on gideon in the book of judges chapter 6 praise the name of the lord gideon chapter 6 i mean judges chapter 6. and we'll take from verse 1. and if you're there say amen praise god and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and the lord delivered them into the hand of the midian seven years and the hand of the of media prevailed against israel and because of the media knights the children of israel made them the dens which are in the mountains and caves and strongholds and so it was when israel had sown that the midianites came up and the amalekites and the children of the east even they came up against them and they encamped against them and destroyed the increase of the earth till thou come unto gaza and left no sustenance for israel neither sheep nor ox nor ass for they came up with their cattle and their tents and they came as grasshoppers for multitude for both they and their camels were without number and they entered into the land to destroy it israel was greatly impoverished because of the medianites and the children of israel cried unto the lord oh my mom i watch out now when the people of god go to crying unto the lord something happens always no matter how fallen we are when we can just turn and begin to cry unto the lord something always happens see and uh verse 7 and it came to pass when the children of israel cried unto the lord because of the midianites that the lord sent a prophet unto the children of israel which said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel i brought you up from egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage and i delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of of all that oppressed you and drave them out from before you and gave them gave you their land and i said unto you i am the lord your god fear not the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but ye have not obeyed my voice now verse 11 and there came an angel of the lord and sat under the oak which was in ophra that pertained unto josh the abyr abby's right and his son gideon thrashed wheat by the wine press to hide it from the midianites may the lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated so just for a little talk tonight we want to look at gideon the prophet preached a message called if god be with us where are all the miracles if god be with us where are all the miracles because god himself is a miracle you and i we are standing upon this earth which is a miracle because where does it hang we think we are on the top of the earth if you go down there those fellows think they are on the top of the earth so so this is a miracle there was a time when there was nothing no creation nothing at all and that's beyond conception there was not even space there was nothing at all but yet before that time god was see he never had a beginning he never will have an ending if you don't believe in him it doesn't bother him because it doesn't diminish him god is before there was an atheist god was hallelujah see he he has no beginning of days he has no ending of life he is god and he he is waiting for somebody that will believe him amen see jesus christ said in yet a little while and the world will see me no more and that's sealed for the unbeliever they will never see god hallelujah but ye will see me because i will be with you and even in you and the prophet says in every generation there's always that little ye there's always that little group of believers who see god hallelujah and so we find here let's just the previous book is uh joshua let's just turn there excuse me let's just turn there to joshua 24. joshua the great leader see after moses led the people all the way to the jordan river and uh moses died hallelujah and god came to joshua and told him joshua moses my servant is dead but i am not dead [Music] is that right i am still god i don't have an ounce less of power than i had when moses wanders on the scene see you take the people take them over to the promised land and he gave him the secret stay with the message stay with moses don't depart to the left don't go to the right stay with moses and you will prosper hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord and that's what this church has done oh glory to god brother stephen i don't know what i'm going to go this which erection tonight but i'm telling you this church took a decision to stay with moses praise the name of the lord hallelujah moses my servant is dead but i am with you joshua you go forward but meditate moses message day and night blessed be the name of the lord and joshua now the secret is to stay with the word and to believe the word and joshua had great success until he even stopped the sun when he was having a great campaign one evening and the sun was about to set and joshua said son stand still won't hang over age alone i must finish with these enemies oh brother sister that's the same god we are serving tonight not a different god the same god and in chapter 24 of joshua we find these words verse 14 now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity in other words don't be a funny believer be genuine believe the message with all that's within you you have no time to get on the internet and start checking who said what about the message hallelujah i know what god said about the message hallelujah believe the message in sincerity praise god he says and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood and in egypt and serve you the lord in other words put away all the worldly things all the denominational things put them away hallelujah verse 15 and if it seem evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom you will serve amen if it seems evil to serve the lord you choose the night if it seems evil to come to the house of god you make your choice tonight if it seems evil to praise god to sing unto the lord like my sister here was seeing tonight if it seems evil to you to clap your hands unto the lord if it seems evil to you to stand up and say amen to the word then make your choice oh we don't want to go back to catholicism we don't want that we want freedom [Applause] blessed be the name of the lord we want freedom to worship the lord i remember my brother jewel forney when he told when i met him years and years ago he told me brother matamba you know that i used to have friends white friends black friends when i was in the world and we used to get drunk and when we would get drunk we would all act the same way the black and the white we would all act the same way is that true or not true he says but if you be drunk and the holy ghost how come there is a special holy ghost for the blacks and the special holy ghost for the white and the special holy ghost for this if you are drunk you are drunk doesn't matter what color of your skin hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord drunk people do not control themselves they are under the control the prophet of god says don't you say i got the holy ghost you should say the holy ghost got me praise god praise the lord you know brings to my memory a story of our i believe it was brother hiddlebrand up in canada i came down here in south carolina in north carolina many years ago and told a story of a little uh mouse a little mouse that was being chased by a cat and this mouse thought my life is in jeopardy and all of a sudden he finds a bottle and that bottle was just the opening of it was just big enough for the mouse to squeeze right in there and the cat was left outside but in there was a little remnant of some alcohol and when the mouse got to breathing see the alcohol was getting in the system the alcohol was getting in the system and after a while he began to feel so good inside the bottle and you're going to feel so good that the bottle became too small he said let me get out of this place and when he got out of the place where's this cat that was following me where's this cat that was chasing me and the cat looked never seen a mouse following a cat and the cat took off and ran away why that mouse was not in its right mind because it had been drunk and brother sister oh glory to god there was a bunch of people they were cowards they were in the upper room they were waiting on a promise hallelujah and all of a sudden there came a stimulation from heaven they came wine from heaven they were filled with a wine and the place got too small for them where's that old pharisee that was following me glory to god peter said hearken unto my words why he wasn't himself no more he was drunk with the holy ghost glory to god and that's what we need we need to be drunk on the holy spirit glory to god thank you jesus and so we find out my friends that joshua told them make up your mind if you want to stay dead as it were in need that's your choice but as for me and my house [Music] [Applause] we will serve the lord as for me in my house we will serve the lord hallelujah and you see the people said we will serve the lord too but it wasn't long until they and so forth and we find here and they were slaves practically to the midianites they would plant their crops and the medianites would come and oh my take all of it away and this is israelites these are children of the promise seed of abraham that god sent the promise that i'll bring them out i'll give them a choice land i took a vine out of egypt i have planted my vine in a choice spot and here they are afraid of the midianites we find gideon here he was actually threshing with hiding so the midnights wouldn't see him oh my my my my and so as i told you before the bible says they that call upon the name of the lord they shall be delivered and that's one lesson we have to learn we have to call on the lord that's god's principle we have to pray we have to call on the lord hallelujah here's a man that was perishing he was sinking peter on the water and the bible never says jesus rushed to him hey no jesus waited until peter said what lord save me lord save me we have to learn to call on the lord lord i need you lord help me hallelujah and when israel got to crying unto the lord my my mind the bible says that the lord sent a prophet unto the children of israel and we find that we don't know the name of this prophet the lord never told us the name of this prophet this is in the book of judges because we know after judges the first prophet we know of always samuel is that right but here's a prophet unnamed because it doesn't even matter it's the word that he has hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord and now the prophet of the lord says this here let's just get this real quick here a prophet says my my my my now now and he began to show them what was taking place and immediately god came on the scene immediately after the prophet's message and it's always been the god now remember god moves behind the prophet if the prophets got the word of the lord amen for my word will not return to me void but it'll accomplish that from for which it was sent and remember see oh don't miss this after the prophet's message god steps on the scene and the prophet says what for to get in the word and activate the word not in everybody but in the ones that believe that word hallelujah see oh my see notice now every time after the prophet's message god himself steps on the scene now watch the scripture here judges chapter six it says this verse uh verse 10. and i said unto you i am the lord your god fear not the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but ye have not obeyed my voice the prophet now this is have having not sent thee 1962 january 24th so god spoke to this prophet and the midianites had taken all they had and they were starving to death and he said don't you remember that i'm the god that brought you up out of egypt don't you know that i performed all my miracles down in egypt don't you know i opened up the red sea i fed your fathers for 40 years in the wilderness i broke up the enemies around them did not i take out the amalekites and everything else from before you i am the lord just turn back to me hallelujah just come back to the word i am the one hallelujah that brought the mighty miracles in the life of the prophet amen i am the one that brought the seven angels over arizona i am the one that raised the dead from the floor and i am still god and after my prophet's message i am here to get in the message when you have become the message then god gets into you hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord and he he brings a salutation that's quite strange and if you notice in verse 12 he says in the angel of the lord appeared unto him and said unto him the lord is with thee thou mighty man of valor that's how god addressed gideon a man that was hiding with his threshing and gideon said unto him oh my lord if the lord be with us why then is all this befall in us and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of saying did not the lord bring us up from egypt but now the lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the medianites now remember now this man is being honest and god will deal with every honest heart [Applause] this man was not ready to put on just some kind of fake he said lord i was born here i wasn't born in egypt [Music] but they told me that you opened up the mighty red sea they told me when they were hungry you baked bread from heaven and sent it down to them but look at my kids starving look at all my neighbors starving to death they told me that you opened up the jordan river but if that same god be with us what happened to all those miracles hallelujah and he said why would you call me a man of vailor let's read the scripture he says this in verse in verse 14 and the lord looked upon him and said go in this time might and thou shalt have israel shall save israel from the hand of the midianites have not i sent thee and he said unto him o my lord wherewith shall i save israel behold my family is poor in manasseh and i am the least in my father's house and the lord said unto him surely i will be with thee and thou shalt smite the medianites as one man brother this man was not going to be phony this man told the lord lord my family is the least and i am the least in my family in other words lord i don't want to dispute your word but why would you address me as a man of vailor why would you call me a man of failure when i'm the least of the least but here's the secret here's the secret gideon had a burden in his heart gideon had a burden in his heart the reason why god came to gideon is because there was a burden in [Music] and if that burden ever gets upon a believer if that burden ever gets upon a believer that will say lord god i have heard what you have done with brother branham i have heard what you have done in the past but lord we are raising children now let my children see the same god amen let my children see that same power see the prophet of god says if if you take ezekiel chapter 9 you'll find that there went out as sealer as silly angel and that ceiling angel was commissioned and the commission was go across the city and when you get to a place where you find them so burdened so concerned crying for the abomination that's committed in the city when you find that place where the people are so hungry for god that once in a while meals are left aside but they can turn off turn off rather than televisions they can tune off the telephones they can shut down this shut down that and say where is our goal lord if you be with us show your power brother branham says it was mary in the sea of nazareth a mean city but mary kept herself clean and virgin and gabriel came to her it was elizabeth is that right and zechariah who are righteous fearing god waiting on the consolation but gabriel came to them the prophet says you can run around with the world and expect visitations of angels hallelujah god has a program his program is consecrate yourself amen amen mean business with god and god will mean business with you hallelujah so the angel speaks to him oh my the prophet of god says this let's just look in the bible real quick in verse 20 and the angel of god said unto him oh my take the flesh now first of all let's not skip this now watch this verse 17 and he said unto him if now i have found grace in thy sight then show me a sign the thou talkest with me depart not hints i pray thee until i come unto thee and bring forth my present and set it before thee and he said i will tarry until thou come again that's god almighty who appeared unto our humble man and gideon didn't just want to take some haphazard thing he wanted to be so sure he said lord if this is you talking with me i want you to wait here and i'll run home and bring an offering and brother branham says the lord waited there two three hours hallelujah we can wait two three minutes but the lord waited there two three hours waiting for a man to go kill a cow cook it bring them here everything and the lord was still waiting there you see we get in a hurry he is never in a hurry you know one time brother brother made a challenge in a congregation he said whatever you bring here the lord will heal and they brought and they brought a blind man and the prophet says i stood there and i prayed and i prayed and i prayed 30 minutes went by the boy was still blind 45 minutes boy was still blind one hour a boy was still blind today's congregation they would have gone get their hamburgers that's right but the prophet says one hour and 45 minutes hallelujah hallelujah the psyche why mr impatient will not see the glory of god the thing we need is to mean business here god is not a liar oh glory to god god is true if i die tonight let me perish believing god's word [Applause] because heaven and earth will pass away but the word of god will never pass away hallelujah so you see two three hours gideon comes back and he's got some he's got some meat and he's got some broth look what the lord instructs him to do and the angel of god said unto him take the flesh and the unleavened cakes and lay them upon this rock and pour out the broth and he did so then the angel of the lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the flesh and the unleaved cakes and the rose up a fire out of the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened case then the angel of the lord departed out of his sight praise the name of the lord now let's listen to the interpretation the prophet brings it here see now watch see now watch he took the stick from his hand and like an old man a staff and touched it and when he touched it the smoke went out and his sacrifice the sacrifice was consumed what was it he took him back to the scriptures to prove what he was the same god that was with elijah and mount carmel the same one i talked about this morning when you lay your soul upon his breast altar of judgment what takes place glory to god if he's the same god he'll take the sacrifice and you've over you've offered it in sincerity upon the altar he will consume the sacrifice and the world will be gone out of you just the smoke will fall away amen what is bothering the church today is mortalism the greatest sin of this age is wartism the world is creeping in our homes in our lives in our churches we should be past the doctrine of holiness we should be way beyond that the doctrine of holiness should be way past but when we still have to tell sisters how to dress and brothers even there's something wrong hallelujah when we let televisions invade our homes entertainment the place of the altar of god how do we expect angels to come you see the prophet of god says this how are you ever going to see a miracle until you become one that means you and i we got to become a miracle we're living in a time where people are seeking signs people want to see miracles and that's wonderful but the prophet says the first miracle should be you you should be a miracle of god's grace amen jesus said except the man be born again he can't even see the kingdom of god if you want to see a miracle become one let god work on you first he's got some over howling to do some different lenses to put on your eyes because you were blind dead in sin and trespasses spiritually blind double dead see god has to give you life amen touch your eyes so you can see amen you become the miracle hallelujah you lay yourself upon the altar of god you forget about all these instagrams you forget about all these what's up post i don't know how people get to know this one posted this this one said this this one said that oh my god forget about it what does god say hallelujah shut these things down close them out the rapture is here one of these days you look to the left and to the right and you say i thought there was going to be a rapture and some voice will say it's already gone and you did not know it why because of wordlism wordlism is killing the church today oh god help us you see how the angel said wait here see gideon said wait here see god you know he says when you come to the house of god and you get an offering and when you come here then you remember that somebody has ought against you oh my what must i do ignore it that's their problem i'm in church forget it first go back make peace with that brother god is going to wait for you [Music] amen he will wait for you because he said so he told gideon to go and that he would wait and he tells you and i to go i'll wait here when you make it right come back here oh glory to god satan is a bluff tonight the lord jesus has told us you are my bride me lord with all my mistakes with all that i am you are my bride because the message he sent to william branham was such a tremendous message there has never been a generation that has ever been given what we have received we have been given things so tremendous things so sublime things so good he tells you with all your mistakes i knew you before the foundation of the world i chose you hallelujah i chose you and when you come he tells you i justify you [Music] you're standing as if you never did it in the first place who is going to believe that the bride will believe that amen when we confess our sins they go back to the devil they will never be remembered against us no more you may remember them your neighbor may remember them but in the mind of god they're gold never to be brought back to the mind of god again and if that is not enough for a person to come to the house of god full of praise full of joy full of worship than what is [Applause] brother the pentecostals they are seeking signs they want miracles they have no seed the seed is the word the seed is the original life and god gave us the original life the original seed and what we need to do is create the atmosphere the atmosphere of worship brother branham says this if you were going to a country let me see if this would work if you're going to a country away from america and you they speak a different language there he says now see could you imagine this is in faith is our victory could you imagine some of you slaying using christians using smutty dirty words and yet belonging to church could you imagine going over to another land and then going around through america learning all this american slang that you know see you wouldn't do that see you know if you're going to sweden and you try to pick up all the american slang all the bad words how are you going to use them in sweden you see i've told this illustration many times when i first came to america was a place i came from a place where they spoke chiluba and then i moved to place where they spoke lingala and then i when i got on the big plane a great big lufthansa plane they spoke uh no more our local languages it was just french and german french and german and we flew all the way to frankfurt germany and when i got there then i took another flight from frankfurt germany to boston massachusetts and that flight no more french german english german english no more french and when i got to boston i had to take another flight from boston to charlotte and on that flight no more german it was just english it was just english a prophet says learn the language of the place you are traveling to oh god help us watch this he says he says now watch see if you're going to to to go over there see see the thing you would want to try to do would be learn a few words of that language at least as much as to say how do you do in that language and i think it would behoove us christians more today if we were trying to learn some heavenly language the praises of god amen that we're going to sing over there amen because heaven lives on the praises of god [Applause] there's hallelujah boulevard there's praise the lord avenue there's hosanna drive all in heaven praise god and heaven has to come here first amen and pick us up and take us to heaven there has to be here on earth in message churches a heavenly atmosphere [Applause] where we come to the house of god with praise in our hearts where the song leader doesn't have to push nobody we're full of praise hallelujah [Music] why because we have seen our name in the book oh hallelujah you can't control a person that has seen their name in the book blessed be the name of the lord that person oh my you could tell them this that this this one said this this one said that against you but that person has already seen their name in heaven john when he saw his name in the book what happened all the scorpions of the patmos aisle didn't bother him no more he went to shouting and praising god oh glory to god thank you jesus the prophet says this you see you that don't believe in shouting you are going to be out of place in heaven i say the truth i lie not you will be out of place in heaven what are they doing that that fellow that was in there somehow managed to get in there and he didn't have a robot how'd you get here he was speechless he was speechless and they took him and pushed him out tribulation period our churches message churches true believing message churches will be on fire it will be a worship amen it'll be a worship because christ has opened the book and when the book is open what do you see you see your name you see yourself praise the name of the lord hallelujah my my see moses when moses saw the people there pharaoh

veteran they know how to do their work if you consecrate it you're going to see what the holy spirit is doing amen it is a no and it's so it's sacred it brings you a fear and respect of what god is doing when brother matama called me the 85 was closed and he was waiting for the old five to open and we have been in the book of esther we preach on the sovereignty of god and we blend it trying to get to the line of duty so i was already prepared i said if it happened that he can't make it i will get into the esther and the wine and here brother matama comes and begin to speak about the wine and the stimulation of the revelation i wanted to jump quickly into the line of duty because the lord decoded to me esther and the praises and i say let me stay in the line of duty and i tried to avoid it and brother matamba came tonight and stressed on the praises so in other words it's a signal to me that you can bypass that you need to speak to the church before you get to the line of duty amen and even the court that i read we spoke about the first chamberlain of esther which was haggai and then if you miss the king you're going to go to ches gaza and there is another type of chamberlain which goes after you are chosen by the king and i look at that i saw the quote brother batamba read about the angel coming into your home i say let me deviate that let me stay in the line of duty brother tamba spoke about it tonight again in other words they are telling me you need to pick all those stuff and pull it out to the church amen even when he mentioned at the beginning he said stay joshua stay with the message until he reached a point to stop the sun he was not here when we spoke about joshua stopping the sun amen how can a man orchestrate things like that amen last wednesday wednesday we spoke about esther you need to go to the purification six months under the murder where you gotta die and then you go to the perfume where the rules of sharon is broken to perfume you it was six months with murr and six months with perfume you go through murder to yourself dying and then the rose of sharon comes to perfume you here brother matamus comes and say lay your life on the altar it is not brother stephen it is not brother matamba it is god amen we are talking about being chosen by the king as esther and here he comes he said the lord have chosen you why is this thing keep coming he's a pastor in another church he's coming never probably he was not even following what we we have been preaching here and everything is lining up together on sunday everything lining up together a minister out of state wake up church god is doing something brother branham say bethlehem was a place where god was moving in a mysterious place we talked about you entering the king you remember you entered the presence of the king by meditation you spend your time thinking about him worshiping him and here he comes again he didn't listen even to that and he began to speak about the same thing over and over we are not preaching to feed your mind we are preaching the message to the heart because the message of malachi 4 came to restore the heart amen if you take what we are preaching into the heart it's going to change your life if you take it into the mind it makes sense it makes sense then you're going to stuck in the intellectual part where you know mystery is in your mind in your head but it's not changing you we don't want that anymore we want mysteries in the heart and then those mysteries become flesh and you yourself become a thunder for the devil amen let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace we thank you for your love we thank you for your mercy and for giving us this great opportunity father we humble ourself like a gideon lord who are we to receive such great mans of god coming here one after another to bless this church lord we are the least like the brother preached from a dot to a destination we are just a dot lord father just like a pebble on the beach lord father but you keep sending ministers they're opening their heart opening their ministry coming one after another and keep lining up exactly with the direction of the holy spirit lord father we thank you for everything you're doing for us for each individual person in this church each family lord father and this church as a whole lord we thank you for the word that was preached mightily tonight lord father we spoke about the dressing of the women and the brother came and struck the same thing and here he's talking about what's up which we already spoke about lord father we thank you for everything you are still insisting in those things because probably there are some that are still lagging behind they don't want to give away they don't want to get separated from the land of moab and go to the land of judah where there is more lord father in store for ruth father may you strengthen your servant may you bless him more and give him the desire of his heart lord may you help this church lord as you have given me signal to go back to do his things lord father all that i can do is obey because i'm not the shepherd this shepherd is the holy spirit i'm just a shepherd led by this shepherd father to lead this church toward the rapture lord father may you anoint us again more may you bring us again more closer and closer unto thee father give your children travel mercy lord and if that terry lord father to come before sunday may lord our heart be so consecrated that when we get here we will be on fire for the work of the king lord we thank you for everything and committing tonight unto the hand and our families lord under the blood of the lamb lord we are protection lies lord in the name of jesus christ amen take the name of jesus with you take the name of jesus [Music] amen [Music] foreign [Music] you
