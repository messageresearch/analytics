I get so worried about my labs because of my immune system and all that. So I always get worried but then I know it is well. So I asked her to check my GFR that's the first thing I'll ask for and they say your GFR is 118 is is good. You know just that because of the pain medication you're taking your liver was a little elevated. And then last week I went to check and the liver was good. The GFR was good. I saw my kidney doctor on that was yesterday. She also said, "You're doing so well." And she's amazed, you know. So, I just want to thank God for my life.

It's your kidney, it's your liver, it's your this and I'll go to sleep on my left side. I'm okay. But when you go on the right side, you know, this pain just start coming. And I it was in the day and it start to get worse. So you start to waver a little bit and say, "Lord, devil, I'm not taking this. &gt;&gt; You got to leave. &gt;&gt; I I'm not taking this." And the same Wednesday night, Brother Valentine came and preached on the same thing, you know.

Lord, and we're believing that the prayer nights are making a difference, Lord God. how it fills our hearts, Lord, to spend time in your presence, Lord, and to bring our supplications and our praise and worship, Lord, and ask in your presence to come down, Lord, and just fill our homes and our lives, Lord. How wonderful it is, Lord, to take that time and just spend it with you, Lord God. Lord, we're here for a Wednesday night service tonight, Lord God. We thank you, Father, convention night.

These are perilous times, Lord. We're seeing those scriptures come to life right before us, Lord God. And we thank you for the assurance that we have in your word, Lord God, and the promises, Lord. And we're looking, Lord, every day for you to come get us, Lord God. How much worse does it have to get, Lord, before you come and take us from this world, Lord? Thank you for helping us, Lord, under the leadership of this church, Lord, and this pastor to help us to make ourselves ready, Lord God. We ask that you bless the pastor and his family as well, Lord. Put Job's hedge up around every one of us, Lord, and keep Satan away from us, Lord God, that we can just continuously serve you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, it comes time now for the tithing and the offering, Lord. And we just want to ask that you bless it, Lord. &gt;&gt; We watched the plumbers a little while today, Lord God, prepare in the fellowship hall, Lord Jesus. And we know that those are just the beginning of things, Lord. But we know that you're going to take care of us on everything that we need for that, Lord. So, we just ask, Lord God, that you have your will in that building, Lord, and the times to come, Lord, that we'll share together in there, Lord God, if you terry, we'd rather you not terry. We'd rather you come on the scene, Lord. So we thank you once again tonight, Lord. Bless the tithing and the offering. Bless the giver, Lord. Bless those who can't, Lord, and wish they could, Lord. But we want everything to go to the furtherance of the kingdom of God. We thank you for the wonderful worship service this evening, Lord, the songs that were sung, Lord.

[Applause] [Music] I want to thank God &gt;&gt; because on last two weeks, the last Thursday in the month, I picked up my prescription. Thanking God I met my deductible so I didn't have to pay anything. The two prescription amongst close to $1,000. I had to rush to work, so I left it in the car. Apparently, Adasa thought it was trash and she threw it away. So Sunday when I was looking for it because I I needed it, I couldn't find it anywhere. She said, "Mom, I think I throw it away." So we came to church hearing the word that God is going to restore without money. I said, "Lord, is either it comes back out the trash some because trash went on last Wednesday or you just do something miraculous." The Lord said, "Call the insurance company. Let them know what happened." I told them. Now, before I misplaced a med, I I forgot it somewhere and it was just about $100. And they says, "I'm sorry, you already got your prescription for the month. We cannot restore it." So, I had to pay the $100. So, they told me to they would evaluate, give them 72 hours. So, they called me this morning and they said, "Miss Falby, go pick up a prescription. One is not quite ready, but you pay $0 and I got everything restored." I want to thank them. What celebration on that day? &gt;&gt; We know it can't be far away. [Applause] Heaven's bridegroom has descended. And the bride of God is heaven bells will sweetly ring.

And today, this one day, I say, I know exactly why you upset because something is working. &gt;&gt; I know you got hit yesterday pretty good. And it's working really, really, really well. Just a matter of time, you will see the answers of your prayer and you will see the manifestation of everything that we're not spending time in vain, but God is alive and we serve a God that hearing our prayer. Why all this time my internet never got a problem? Only on Tuesday at 4:00. So he knew what was coming up on Tuesday. But thank God we had a backup and today everything is back to normal and it was an accident and somebody didn't tell me. They just cut my line and didn't say anything. And after prayer prayer right after prayer finished they sent me a message to let me know what happened. So the prayer convicted them &gt;&gt; and today everything is back and they took that line and bury that again down. Amen. Everything is working together for good. Amen. If you're not sure about it, listen to the sermon tonight. Something is coming up. I'm not preaching. Brother Polycarp is preaching and brother JM, Brother Albert will interpret. Amen. with full force and full energy because I'm right there as a backup. Somebody need to be blessed tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody need to receive a blessing tonight. We don't come to church and go back the same way. When you get in church, something must take place. When you leave, you say, "It was good to be in the presence of the Lord." Amen. So, let's go with only believe. Oh, we believe. Oh, we believe all things are impossible. [Music] We believe [Music] we believe [Music] Jesus. you for me. [Music] I [Music] All of the [Music] I believe I [Music] All king. [Music] Thank you musicians. &gt;&gt; Everything is possible to those that believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you don't believe, it's impossible to receive something from God. That's right. We may clap for the Lord &gt;&gt; for the gift that he has given us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; You can receive nothing from God. If you don't have faith, &gt;&gt; the faith to his word and what does his word say? &gt;&gt; They asked Jesus a question. &gt;&gt; What is the works of God? Jesus said, &gt;&gt; "The works of God is believing, &gt;&gt; believing to whom he has sent." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Believing to the person that he chose. &gt;&gt; And in this church, we have a pastor who is chosen by God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's things that we'll see this evening. You can pray very well and stuff will not come down from heaven. Why? Because what you have asked had already left heaven &gt;&gt; and is already dwelling in a man &gt;&gt; and is dwelling in men. When you have the revelation of season, your destination is clear. And that's what we'll see this night. May God bless you richly. Since y'all are standing, [Music] we'll open our Bible to the book of Mark. &gt;&gt; Mark chapter 11. [Music] &gt;&gt; We'll take verse 12 to 14. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And even 21. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you there? Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. We read in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; And on the tomorrow when he were come from Bethany, he was hungry. [Music] And seeing a fig tree a far off having leaves, he came if happily he might find anything thereon. And when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for the time of figs was not yet. [Music] And Jesus answered and said unto A, "No man eat fruit from thee hereafter forever." And his disciples heard it. &gt;&gt; That's right. [Music] [Music] And verse 21, and Peter calling to remembrance says unto him, Master, behold the fig tree which thou hast cursed is withered away. That's right to save time. We won't read in Mark. It's the same story. We'll pray the Lord, &gt;&gt; eternal Lord, heavenly father, creator of heaven and earth, we see ourselves this evening in your house, knowing that we're in the end time. We're in this season of the end time. And we're in need of you, Lord. If there's a moment that we need you, it's this moment here right now that we need you. The woman with the blood issue needed you. She didn't want to miss the season knowing that you were deceiving. Their answer to all questions, to all problems. And this evening, Lord, your people are before you. They're not before a man, but before you, God, they came. Even those online hearing us, they're waiting for you, Lord. There are people that are disappointed, discourage, but they know that you're the person kept on giving them glory. It doesn't matter the sickness. It doesn't matter the problem. It doesn't matter the situation. You, Lord Jesus Christ. You're the one who does operation without scars. you you can manifest yourself this way. We want to thank you Lord. Bless the service of God. Remove us from the past. We came from reading. But the people that were in school to learn how to read. But when it comes to interpret your word that takes your domain alone may come down so you may manifest yourself. So you may speak to us all. may remove us from the way. May you take control from the pulpit all the way to the last row and bless your people. Thank you for everything in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; We thank the pastor for this opportunity again that he gave us to make a little noise in the behalf of God. Without taking time, we'll also read something. Exodus. &gt;&gt; In Exodus chapter 23. &gt;&gt; Exodus chapter 23. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Verse 10 to 12. He says this, [Music] "And six years thou shalt sow thy land and shall gather the fruits thereof." That's right. [Music] [Music] But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and and lie still, that the poor of thy people may eat, and what they leave, the beast of the of the field shall eat in like Amen. In like manner thou shalt eat with thy vineyard. Verse 12. Six days thou shalt do thy work and on the seventh day thou shalt rest that thine ox and thy ass may rest and the son of thy handmade and the stranger may be refreshed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can also read in leviticus chapter 25. &gt;&gt; Amen. Fore! Foreign! Foreign! [Music] Verse [Music] 10. And ye shall hollow the fif the 50th year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land, unto all the inhabitants thereof. It shall be a jubilee unto you. And ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family. &gt;&gt; That's right. [Music] Very [Music] a jubilee. Verse 11. A jubilee shall that 50 50th year be unto you. You shall not sow, neither reap that which go which groweth of itself in it, nor gatherth the grapes of the grapes in it of thy vain undressed. I'll read something in Deuteronomy 23. Deuteronomy 23 verse 10 to 12. [Music] If there be, if there be among you any man that is not clean by reason of uncleanness, that chances him by night, then shall he chaseth him by night, then shall he go aboard out of the camp. He shall not within the camp. He shall not come within the camp. But it shall be with the evening cometh on, he shall wash himself with water, and when the sun is down, he shall come into the camp again. Thou shalt have a place with also without the camp whether thou shalt go forth aboard. May the Lord God add a blessing to the reading of his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] The pastor just kept from talking here that we are creators that we are gods. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham speaks &gt;&gt; in and &gt;&gt; give me a minute &gt;&gt; and the love divine divine love. &gt;&gt; You can read it. of 56 &gt;&gt; 0926 &gt;&gt; in par in paragraph 26 &gt;&gt; he speaks of this &gt;&gt; he says that you are a creator [Music] a amateur a miniature &gt;&gt; as we are here we are creators &gt;&gt; am I creators meaning we can create something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It it doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; Don't look at your condition. Brother Brandon speaks about the gift unfold of God of 1960 in paragraph 25. He says this, it doesn't take it doesn't take a big church but of a big God &gt;&gt; inside the church. It doesn't take &gt;&gt; It doesn't take a mountain. &gt;&gt; It doesn't take a holy mountain, but a God who is holy in the mountain. It doesn't take a holy man, &gt;&gt; but a God who is holy inside the man. We saw the little boy who was singing right here. &gt;&gt; You had to remember so the walls of Jericho can fall down. It was not prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was the shout. &gt;&gt; It was the shout after this trumpet. &gt;&gt; The walls of Jericho fell down like this evening. The amen hallelujah that you will give to God that will make that will crumble the walls of Jericho in your life. It doesn't matter your situation. &gt;&gt; Our subject this evening is Jesus is your season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus is your season. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter the place that you may find yourself. When the season comes, everything even the condition that that's there should be subjected to it &gt;&gt; when the season comes. If the trees may have to drop their leaves, it doesn't it doesn't matter how many times &gt;&gt; they the leaves will fall. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the season the season will condition things and that's what we'll see this evening. &gt;&gt; I don't know your your state of your soul. I don't know the state of your health or your situation or your affairs, &gt;&gt; but you have to know that this evening that this season &gt;&gt; is coming to your boat, to your arm. Amen. &gt;&gt; May God be blessed. &gt;&gt; May God be worshiped. We read in Exodus, &gt;&gt; I'll read something that the prophet said. Jehovah Gyra, second part, 1962, paragraph 31. I'll just read something. The prophet says this, "If I love Christ, it'd be a lot more better for me to brag on his church." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then it would be brag on him. &gt;&gt; Because I would rather you brag on my children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Me, Brandham. may God be worshiped. That's what Jesus said. They asked Jesus, &gt;&gt; "What is the works of God doing his will, &gt;&gt; believing to whom he had sent?" He was not speaking about the father. He was speaking about the people that will be chosen, that will be sent out, him as one that was sent. You need to believe on those that are saved. &gt;&gt; You need to believe on those that are sent to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I told you that &gt;&gt; what you're looking for this evening already left heaven and is already dwelling on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham. &gt;&gt; Abraham. He was seeing visions. He was seeing dreams that God was talking to him. He did not have the son of the promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter all the vision that he saw &gt;&gt; or how many times that God could have spoken to him. &gt;&gt; He was seeking for the son and he did not obtain it until he received &gt;&gt; the visitation of three strangers. Amen. God gave the earth to man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God cannot steal. &gt;&gt; He cannot violate. &gt;&gt; He cannot operate on earth without the permission of man, without associating himself with the hands of man or it will be a violation. a jurisdictional violation. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why every single time God wants to do something, he has to compare. He has to come to man. He had to confront with man. Even in the forest where you may be. Amen. He would take the form of man to come down over there. Amen. Amen. That's why God cannot operate. on earth. &gt;&gt; It's always through men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May God be worshiped. Abraham &gt;&gt; and Abraham &gt;&gt; and received three visitors [Music] &gt;&gt; but Lot only received two. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're asking where's the third um from Lot. &gt;&gt; I believe it was the promise of Abraham that was the third that was walking. Maybe it was Isaac who was talking. God promised Abraham that next year I will come. The next year came and then there was nobody. But who was in the third year? I mean in the next year. It was the promise of Isaac. It was Isaac who was talking now. &gt;&gt; It was Isaac who was in the wall. Amen. &gt;&gt; God cannot operate anything on earth &gt;&gt; without associating with men. Hello. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now this evening we read the fig tree &gt;&gt; that Jesus had cursed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus had cursed the fig and we all know that the that the season that Jesus found himself &gt;&gt; it was the season of the fig. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he had no fig. It was not the season of the fig. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he sees the leaf. &gt;&gt; But he is God. He knows all. How is he going to approach something that has nothing? &gt;&gt; My beloved, &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I came from the lost sheep from the house of Israel." &gt;&gt; Amen. Doesn't matter your situation. It doesn't matter your sin. The lamb was slain. And Jesus came close to the tree. because he had because he was hungry. He was reclaiming the fig. &gt;&gt; Like now since the fig tree couldn't give fig to the fig, &gt;&gt; it is not your season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. is the season of the sun. Where is the sun? &gt;&gt; It is the works, the fruit. &gt;&gt; Wherever the feast, the sun is is the fruit. &gt;&gt; Where is the sun? It's the fruit. &gt;&gt; He found Mary tells him, "We're looking for wine." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because wherever the sun is, the fruit must appear, he takes water and after he turns it, he changes it to wine. And people were happy. Meaning where the sun is, there has to be words. Amen. That's why on that day &gt;&gt; when Peter &gt;&gt; with his knowledge &gt;&gt; with his science that he had &gt;&gt; knowing the season of everything [Music] he threw and was fishing all night. He didn't receive anything. He didn't catch anything. But when Jesus came to his boat, &gt;&gt; Jesus wanted to show to Peter that wherever the son is, &gt;&gt; that's when the works are there. &gt;&gt; Wherever the wherever you must be, works must be manifested [Applause] in one part. The six in the Bible represented Israel like a nation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in the other part also the fig also represent the believer the Christian. Now Jesus in his time when he saw the Pharisees and the Sadducees he did not find fruits in their life. Because a man, a tree in the Bible is a type of man. &gt;&gt; And when and you must bear fruit. &gt;&gt; And what we notice is there are certain trees that give bad fruit and there are humans. There are people that have bad bad living lifestyle that are producing the wrong fruits. And Jesus said to those tapestry that we will cut them off and they will be tossed in the fire because wherever the sun is there has to be fruit. &gt;&gt; Peter threw. Peter threw &gt;&gt; he threw his net but when the son had said not when he threw casted out his net he caught a lot of fish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This evening I don't know where you tossed your net. Maybe they maybe it's work that you're looking a job. Maybe it's children that you're looking for. &gt;&gt; But Jesus is coming to your boat. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's coming to your boat. &gt;&gt; The word that you're hearing this evening, &gt;&gt; but it's a season. We're in a season. The teaching that the man of God is giving that we're in a season. Don't let that season pass like that. It doesn't matter the condition that you find yourself in. May you be in the valley or not. You have to know that the season changes. &gt;&gt; When you're placed in the season, it's so God can bring you somewhere. Don't look at what you had done. Don't look at what you had done. Don't look at your mistakes. &gt;&gt; You have to be focused &gt;&gt; at the season. There is in the Bible, you know, just to save time. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a um a sinful woman. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know the story. &gt;&gt; But when she met this season, she said, "I cannot let this season pass by. It doesn't matter my condition. I see the season that could change everything. &gt;&gt; A woman caught in adultery. When she met the season, people accused her. People were there to condone her, condemn her. But before the season, the season has said, "The one who had not sinned yet toss the first stone. The woman had recognized her fault &gt;&gt; and made her confession before Jesus and the season had forgiven her. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter your condition. It doesn't matter the errors that you had made. &gt;&gt; You had to know that the season changes and Jesus is the season this evening. It is he is your season this evening. &gt;&gt; May God be worshiped. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I read something. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; In the mark of the beast of 1956, &gt;&gt; September 15, paragraph 55, &gt;&gt; July [Music] The prophet says says this, "But God said, remember you were one time slaves yourself and down in Egypt, &gt;&gt; and I have freed you." Therefore, at the sounding of the trumpet, every slave, no matter how long he's been in or how short a time, it doesn't matter how long you've been in sin, because the person that knows that knows the sin is a slave to the sin. The one that commits sin is a slave to the sin. And here in the Old Testament, there were slaves. There were people in position of hurt for what maybe they couldn't eat well. Maybe they couldn't do a certain action. They were called to be a slave to work somewhere to obtain at least food. But now there were an ordinance. There was a law. There was the law of Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That said this, &gt;&gt; even if the slave had dwelt with you for a long time, but if the 50th year come in that period, you're obligated to free them. Even if he killed who? Even if he did whatsoever, he's obligated to be free unless he himself decide to stay slave. But I believe the children of God cannot accept, &gt;&gt; cannot accept to dwell to remain a slave to sin. &gt;&gt; No. No. The lamb was slain &gt;&gt; and the the grave is empty. The tomb is empty. The tomb is empty. And this evening we'll see the season in all its dimensions. How he can come to you for your aid. Amen. &gt;&gt; We spoke on how they fig represent Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know that this the fruits are seasonal. &gt;&gt; But in that time Jesus had reclaimed &gt;&gt; and we had seen that. It's because he himself was the season because wherever the sun is &gt;&gt; there is fruits. We asked Peter &gt;&gt; when he had tossed the net. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had he didn't catch the net. &gt;&gt; But when the season approached the season had said cast thy net and Peter caught many fish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now Jesus, your season is coming. It doesn't matter the condition of your life, &gt;&gt; the impact that the season have in our life. In our life, what impact does the season have in our life? When we notice that we're going through a difficult time, we notice that we're going through a serious time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What happens? &gt;&gt; Usually God finds a way &gt;&gt; to bring you into you your presence. His presence &gt;&gt; to bring you into his presence. He He brings you to your presence so you may have time to have to make a decision like Ruth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You look at the situation that you have &gt;&gt; and you look at the word of God. &gt;&gt; What did God say? &gt;&gt; Is there a promise for me in the Bible? &gt;&gt; And then you have to attach yourself to that promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was one day Jesus had many disciples and he told them that I am the bread that came down from heaven. you must eat me so you may have eternal life. You need to drink my blood. And people were scandalized. And among many of them, among many disciples, there were many, most of them, majority of them left, but there was only a small little group that stayed, a small little group that lived the word of God. It was a time for decision. And Jesus had asked the question to the disciples. &gt;&gt; Your friends have left. &gt;&gt; What are you doing here? &gt;&gt; It's a time for decision. But Peter has said, &gt;&gt; "You have the word of eternal life." &gt;&gt; To whom shall we go again? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He took the decision like Ruth had also talking the taken the decision to to go to a strange land to trust in a God that she did not know &gt;&gt; to follow Naomi. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's how a Christian must be. God is bringing us to that &gt;&gt; so we can take a decision. You'll notice that certain people will run away, &gt;&gt; but some will stay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Please excuse me. &gt;&gt; You will notice maybe somewhere you did some errors in your life. Maybe you are committing certain sin, but you will find yourself when you hear the sound of the trumpet. When you hear the gospel, when we read the prophet was talking about the sound of the trumpet in the Bible, the sound of the trumpet and tonight, the sound of the trumpet that you're listening to, this gospel that I'm preaching to you, it's this word that you're listening to. That is the sound of the trumpet that God is sounding on you that it doesn't matter your condition. Even the sickness, God is capable tonight to change your destination. &gt;&gt; He's capable to change your destination. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God be worshiped. &gt;&gt; There's a time when trees in the season and the earth must rest and that's what we read in Exodus. [Applause] There's a time that the earth must rest. There's also a time that people must rest. You work for like six six days, but on the seventh day, you have to rest. &gt;&gt; You had to go in the house of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the same thing. You believers, &gt;&gt; you did what you had done, but now you had to take rest. &gt;&gt; You had to free yourself from me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to free yourself from me. &gt;&gt; May God be worshiped. [Music] &gt;&gt; You have to look at yourself if you're carrying good fruits or not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're speaking about this season. &gt;&gt; There was a man. &gt;&gt; There was a small little boy &gt;&gt; in the Bible. He was doing certain affairs. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And his work was not working. &gt;&gt; But one day he met the disciples. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what I tell you this evening. &gt;&gt; Your blessing. &gt;&gt; I told you you could pray. &gt;&gt; God will answer. Heaven will answer. So, but for you to obtain it, &gt;&gt; you have to meet a Peter. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to meet a Peter. &gt;&gt; You can read the Bible, but you have to meet a Phillip. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A deacon Phillip. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because there are people that are ordained. You have a question. You had to come to Pastor Steven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the question and answer. There are certain people that God ordained. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm returning. There are someone that was doing certain affairs. Maybe somewhere maybe among you someone is doing a business and it's not working. You're in need of a connection. You're in need of a connection. When Jesus was preaching to the people, he had compassion that people did not eat &gt;&gt; and said, "You must give them something to eat." He told the disciples and the disciples said, "No, &gt;&gt; but the disciples and but the disciple made um an option gave an option. Unless one tell you, let me tell you. &gt;&gt; So you can meet Isaac, you need Eleazar. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you can meet You're Rebecca. &gt;&gt; You You're in need of Isaac. &gt;&gt; You're an Eleazer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's an Eleazar. It's like no in this. It's like us in the time of the &gt;&gt; You know, you know our Eleazor, right? Mario. &gt;&gt; It's William Mario Brham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's this message of the end time &gt;&gt; that's making us &gt;&gt; that's making us meet the master. Now this little boy had in his activities just five little bread and two fish. And the disciples made a connection between the little boy and Jesus. When you brought it to Jesus, &gt;&gt; when you brought it to Jesus, he multiplied it and fed &gt;&gt; 5,000 men. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the capture received what was left, 12 full baskets. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But look at the five bread that they had &gt;&gt; to find 12 full basket. Why? Because they were in faith with the season. &gt;&gt; For your season also, you're in need of a connection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're in need of a connection. &gt;&gt; Jesus is a God of of a meaning. He's a place. May God be worshiped. &gt;&gt; In John 6 said, "What must we do to do the will of God?" And Jesus had told them, "The will of God is the works of God." Meaning believing on whom he had sent. me the person he had ordained. &gt;&gt; Jesus had said, "The person who receives you receives me. &gt;&gt; You're seeking to find Jesus, to receive Jesus, &gt;&gt; but his interest has already been taken. It's in men." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are certain people that are uh anointed by God. &gt;&gt; And that is the habitation of God. Amen. When you meet those people everything that you're in need of, they will give it to you, you must remember of Eleazar in the Elisha in the Old Testament of a woman that had lost her son, the Shinomite woman. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This woman had found the uh address of God. &gt;&gt; She saw that this was a man of man of God. I cannot miss the season. It doesn't matter for the son that was dead. You know the following of that story. &gt;&gt; The things that you're reclaiming today are no longer in heaven. &gt;&gt; They're already somewhere. In the day of Pentecost, &gt;&gt; Jesus had promised Joel 2:28, "In the last day, I will send my spirit to all flesh. Your son and your daughters shall prophesy. The young shall have visions and the old will see dreams. &gt;&gt; But in the day of Pentecost, The Holy Ghost had came down, God came down in his fullness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But what I noticed, since that day, the Holy Ghost had not stopped to come down since that day. Has stopped coming down since that day. Why? Why? nowhere because God had dispersed himself in his church in his fullness. He was in man. That's why act nine, if I'm not mistaken, &gt;&gt; Cornelius, a man was praying to God, a holy man. He was praying for heaven so he may receive the Holy Ghost so his house may have eternal life. God had answered. &gt;&gt; God did not come down in the house. He said, "There's a certain Peter." That's someone send Peter. Send people to Peter. When they sent Peter to Peter, Peter came down to his house. He started to speak. While y'all are here, y'all have problems. And the sound is is sounding. The word of God is being preached. The gospel is being proclaimed, but you're not noticing. You're not catching your situation. So, the season can take care of it. The season can resolve it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But Cornelius and his house and everything that he had invited just by hearing the gospel, the word that Peter was speaking, &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost had came down in the house of Cornelius who brought down the Holy Ghost. It was a man that was ordained that was chosen. A man that had the key that Jesus had said, &gt;&gt; "What you will bind here on earth, &gt;&gt; heaven shall also bind, &gt;&gt; your prayers that you're praying to nine." &gt;&gt; You got to change the your way of praying. Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to change your style of praying. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's good to pray. &gt;&gt; God will answer you. But when God will send you a man, may when God will send the season, &gt;&gt; will you be capable of seasoning the season &gt;&gt; so you can ordain? So you can ask for what you're in need of. Cornelius had prayed and Peter had came. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost had came down over there. Why? Because the Holy Ghost had already left heaven. Mean what Cornelius was looking how had already left heaven and was already dwelling in the in the um body of of of human. &gt;&gt; It was in man. It was dwelling in man. Amen. &gt;&gt; May God be worshiped. &gt;&gt; The same thing also [Music] the unique Ethiopian He was reading the Bible. He was reading the uh the scribe, the scrolls and the scriptures. The same way you're reading the scriptures, the message &gt;&gt; will be different than the way brother Steven is reading the scripture. Just how he was reading, God has sent Philillip. He said, "Go over there. There is someone who does not understand the scripture and what he is in need of you already have it. Go over there and give it to him. That's how Philip went over there and he asked the question what you're reading. Do you understand it? And then he explained it. And the man decided there's a time for decision. God put people always in places of decision. So you can take a decision. &gt;&gt; Man took a decision to repent. He saidapt, &gt;&gt; take the baptism &gt;&gt; and be filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You want another example? &gt;&gt; There was a man. He was not in the Bible. His name was William Ron Brandon. There was an anti anti who was looking for the salvation of her children. But God who had heard from heaven, who left heaven, came down and covered himself with with badger skin, a fat skin of man, and said, "What do you want? In a minute, I will give it onto you." And he said, "I want the salvation of my children." And in that instant, the salvation, you see what Antarai was looking for had left heaven and was already dwelling in the in the man of God. What you're looking for this evening &gt;&gt; is in man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Only if you could believe. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet is saying. &gt;&gt; God had told him. &gt;&gt; If you bring if you bring men to believe nobody will resist even cancer, nothing will resist this evening. &gt;&gt; I don't know your condition. There's a lot of things I haven't even read the prophet. I don't even know where to begin. &gt;&gt; May God be worshiped. &gt;&gt; May God be worshiped. &gt;&gt; I'll read a prophet. [Music] the things that are to be 1965 December the 5th paragraph 45 I'm going down I'm reading there's something &gt;&gt; may God be worshiped A man is an agent of God. You know that particularity. &gt;&gt; Every man of God has his particularity. Why? &gt;&gt; Because he is a god of variety. You will notice that Joshua, he was the one who stopped the sun. He he was capable to make the walls of Jericho crumble. But it was to Moses alone to make the cloud be shown. Why? Because he's a god of variety. Whenever a man of God is coming up here, you have to be you have to pay very close attention to obtain. The prophet of God says this. I believe that God is a God of variety. The world proves that. &gt;&gt; He's got big mountains and little mountains. &gt;&gt; He's got plains and and he's got desert. He's got different things because he made it the way he wanted it. And he made the season, summer, winter, spring and autumn. He made it season. &gt;&gt; It shows he's a god of variety. That's right. &gt;&gt; It shows that he's the God of variety. He made you in a variety. Amen. Some men are real blusterous &gt;&gt; and some are real dogmatic &gt;&gt; and others are fine and others are kind and you just find all different kinds of people and in his kingdom. See &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Look at St. Peter and judge him by Andrew. See and judge him by Andrew. See, &gt;&gt; let's speak a little about Andrew. Andrew, I said in the in the life, you will always need a post for your for your promotion. You need connection. &gt;&gt; Maybe for your marriage, &gt;&gt; you need a connection. You need an eleer for your healing. &gt;&gt; You need a man of God &gt;&gt; for everything that you're in need of in your life for your salvation. You're in need of the servant of God as well. Amen. &gt;&gt; Andrew probably brought Peter to Jesus and Andrew wasn't known. But look, was not popular. But look at the works of Peter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at what Peter did, the miracles. &gt;&gt; But they're not speaking about what Andrew did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are people that God put as a post. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May God be worshiped. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's a God of variety. &gt;&gt; Look at St. Peter and judge him by Andrew. See, &gt;&gt; Andrew, Andrew is that prayer warrior. Just stayed on his knees all the time. And the Apostle Peter was one of those fire brand that preached &gt;&gt; and so forth. &gt;&gt; Andrew was probably behind here. &gt;&gt; Praying. Praying. &gt;&gt; Oh, support a pastor. Support a pastor. Support your servant. Support your servant. &gt;&gt; But when the man of God goes, &gt;&gt; souls are saved. Amen. &gt;&gt; The same the same the same reward we also remember for that for the those that were on their knees &gt;&gt; and so forth and Paul was more scholarly more a prophet something and set back and set back And see, Moses wrote the first four books of the old which &gt;&gt; he wrote the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; The rest, &gt;&gt; the rest of it was the laws and kings and so on and so forth. and what someone and what someone wrote of the prophets. But Moses wrote the law, &gt;&gt; the first four books of the Bible, &gt;&gt; Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy. And Paul wrote the New Testament. That's true. Matthew, Mark, Luke, John wrote the Acts of what taking place. And so Paul separated the law and grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I was speaking about God of variety. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He is the God of variety. You have to be very You have to pay very close attention. &gt;&gt; Oh, I took your time. We will drop. &gt;&gt; We'll drop. Don't worry. &gt;&gt; We'll say a little something. &gt;&gt; May God be worshiped. &gt;&gt; We're in the season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when the season comes, &gt;&gt; you have to take a decision. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You should not look at your condition. Don't look at your neighbor. &gt;&gt; There's a woman that was yelling and screaming in the Bible. Amen. Amen. There were people stopping her, disciples trying to stop her, but because she knew I am in the face of the season, my my situation needs the master. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. She didn't listen to everybody else trying to stop her. &gt;&gt; In fact, she even screamed louder to obtain what he needed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the season, &gt;&gt; it's a time of blessing. It's a time of deliverance. It's a time of testing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a time for testing. It doesn't matter &gt;&gt; whatsoever for God to bless you, &gt;&gt; you will go through a test. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The three Hebrews so they can see their God. They went through the burning furnace and they met their Lord. They met their God. They were not disappointed. It doesn't matter the situation. We will stand with the word of God. We will apply the word of God. &gt;&gt; The season doesn't choose the place so it can operate like this evening. I will tell you the season does not choose the place. I I don't know your condition. Maybe they have declared that you cannot receive. Maybe you have cancer that your situation could not work. Maybe your business is not working. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe they had buried your documents. Maybe you put your document somewhere. But I want to show you that the season that the season does not concern itself with the place. &gt;&gt; In the book of Matthew chapter 9 verse 18 23-2 there was a resurrection of the daughter of Jarius. &gt;&gt; This resurrection was in the house. If your problem is in the house, &gt;&gt; the season can resolve it. Amen. Jesus had resolved that in the house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now in the book of Luke 7 verse 11 to 17, there was a resurrection. There was a a resurrection. &gt;&gt; There was a feast of the resurrection. There was a &gt;&gt; there was a resurrection of the widow son. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was a story in Luke 9, Luke 11. Their son was already dead. The child was already dead &gt;&gt; and they were bringing him to the cemetery. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not sure the state of your situation where it's going. &gt;&gt; I don't know the level of your situation or how bad it is. I don't know how bad your situation is. But this child was in a carcass. It was in a coffin &gt;&gt; and they were going to bury him. &gt;&gt; They were going to bury him. But because the season was there, wherever the sun is, there is fruits. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He stopped the coffin. He stopped the mark and he resurrected his son of the of the widow. Jesus is capable this evening for this word that you're hearing &gt;&gt; so he may resurrect. Maybe it doesn't matter the relationship that was destroyed, that was messed up, your reputation, &gt;&gt; God is capable this evening. &gt;&gt; God is capable in this moment, this minute &gt;&gt; and in this season in John 11 verse. &gt;&gt; Oh, there's the story of Lazarus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lazarus when he was sick, they called Jesus and Jesus didn't come &gt;&gt; and Lazarus died and they buried him &gt;&gt; in the in the cemetery. I don't know where they buried your situation over here. Lazarus, there was no hope. um his sister didn't have hope like your situation like the doctor probably declared maybe you're without hope but let me tell you that this season is capable of resurrection when Jesus came in the cemetery in the tomb he resurrected Lazarus your situation may be &gt;&gt; your situation may be restored right now your business, your affairs may be restored right now only if you could believe. The musician can approach, the musician can come forward. may no matter your condition. If you could only believe, I just came from showing you 34 different cases in three different places that Jesus who is your season that he had operated. He is the same tonight to operate in your season. If your situation is in the house, he will do something. If it's already, it's already if your situation is already on its way to be buried, he's capable. If they already put it in a in a coffin, he's capable. I mean, I don't know which domain. I don't know. You're the only person who know the circumstance. the domain of what's not working in your mind that's not working in your life that's not working in your health in your works in your business in your relation I'm saying this evening Jesus this evening he's capable pastor you can come forward Jesus is cap is capable this evening he's capable this evening wherever the the sun is where the fruits It doesn't matter your condition. If you could stand, if you could rise, if you could rise, Jesus is capable this evening. &gt;&gt; He is capable this evening to honor your faith. He's capable this evening. If you could only believe. If you could only believe. If you could only believe in the people that God chose the to the people that God sent. One day Anna had a situation in her relationship, the situation in her house and a situation in her family. She had prayed. She had prayed. She had prayed. When the man of God was there, when the man of God took the situation, when the man of God had pro um announced the word, &gt;&gt; the demand &gt;&gt; of and of Hannah was resolved in God, was answered in God and he had the son of the prophet &gt;&gt; and he had Samuel and he had Samuel. The same thing maybe you found yourself in this exact situation. God is capable. God is capable &gt;&gt; this evening. May God bless you. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus is your season. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus, &gt;&gt; not a person. Jesus is your season. Amen. And I love the last illustration. It summarize everything for us. Three resurrection in three different places. &gt;&gt; The first one in the house because he's the season. He brought resurrection. &gt;&gt; The second one was not in the house &gt;&gt; because in the house the corpse is still there. They must still think about maybe calling a preacher and bringing the preacher and maybe the preacher can come and lay hand. Now the situation change. It's a little bit more uh more more advanced &gt;&gt; where they took the body and they put it in a coffin and they close everything and the funeral home already put all type of medication, all type of stuff. So it's pretty much gone. And now there's still a little hope. Maybe a preacher can stop the the funeral service and then come and pray over it. And then the season came &gt;&gt; and brought the resurrection. Now the third one was even far beyond that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where they went and bury and close everything. &gt;&gt; In other words, no no no no coming back. &gt;&gt; Because when they spoke to Martyr, Martha was waiting for the general resurrection. In other words, all hope were completely gone. But when the season came, the season removed everything and brought up again Lazarus. In other word, there is no as long these are dead people. &gt;&gt; You are not dead, you alive. And don't &gt;&gt; if God can resolve problem for people that are already dead. &gt;&gt; What about you who still have the breath of life? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter how advanced your case is. &gt;&gt; Your case could be in the house. It could be at a certain intersection already where they taking you to the cemetery or it's already been buried. It doesn't matter where it is. What's matter is to find the season &gt;&gt; and the season is Jesus Christ. When you bring him in, he have everything that you need. &gt;&gt; Amen. Never let the season pass. &gt;&gt; God doesn't send his word and then his word will return to him void. That's absolutely impossible. Amen. God is speaking. Touch the master. And if you do touch the master, you will receive what you need. I know usually we are on a hurry and we're trying to go home, but God already spoke. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know yourself. &gt;&gt; You know your situation. You know how far you are, where you are advanced, whether you need a salvation, whether you need a healing or whether something trouble you throughout the day. They have declared to you tonight that the season is Jesus Christ. Invite that season and then tell him where the problem is. He knows where the problem is, but he want you to tell him to invite him. Amen. Take a few minutes as they play softly. Forget about who's beside you or who's going to listen to what you're saying. Amen. We cannot be in the presence of the Lord and try to rush out. You rush out, you meet that same devil waiting for you. Amen. Make sure you can talk to your Caesar. You want to kneel, you can kneel. You want to stand, you can stand. But let's take few minute. You know your problem where it is. Whether it's in the home, whether it's on the road, whether it's already buried, whether you work your mind up like Peter and you did all that you can do all night and were was not able to find anything. I don't know where your situation is. You know your need. The season is the word. The season is Jesus Christ. Call the season and tell him where you need him. Open your heart. Open your house. Open your business. You might be afraid to talk to somebody. You might be afraid or ashamed to talk to somebody, but never be ashamed to talk to the one that knows you better than yourself. So, open your mouth and talk to him. Speak to him. Focus on him because he's the season. Seize this opportunity tonight that you don't leave this service the same way you came in tonight. He is the season. Jesus is the season. Wherever he is, he knows what it is. If your spiritual life doesn't bear fruit that are meat for the gospel, he's still the one. He's divine that you can get connected to and you can bear fruit and the father will help you bear more fruit. If it's a business, take the business to him. Like the little child, take whatever you have in your hand to him. [Music] Let him be your season. Thank you Lord. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you humbly tonight.
