[27:29] up here he has a spoken praise report
[27:31] this morning and uh we're going to let
[27:33] him come up and tell this and then uh we
[27:35] do have a we have a couple of
[27:40] specials you keeping your eyes on the
[27:44] light um yeah I sent this to Brother
[27:46] John just as a spoken praise report but
[27:49] then it just came on my heart I just
[27:52] need to speak this so um about a month I
[27:56] guess month and a half ago went to have
[27:58] my regular checkup everything was good
[28:02] except for my
[28:04] PSA it was 53 54 I think it was well he
[28:11] scheduled me to go see a
[28:13] urologist well they called sent me
[28:16] appointment about a week and a half two
[28:18] weeks out and and they called and said
[28:22] well he has to be in surgery that day so
[28:25] he need to reschedule
[28:28] and uh that was another two three weeks
[28:31] down the road and the whole time the
[28:34] devil's telling me you know this is
[28:36] going to go up it's going to get worse
[28:39] you know and I've been I was having some
[28:42] discomfort okay and I just kept I said
[28:46] Satan I said you can't touch
[28:49] me you know Jesus covered this when he
[28:54] said it's finished
[28:57] [Applause]
[29:02] so I finally made it to the urologist
[29:05] this is about a month and a half later I
[29:09] think it
[29:10] was and um he uh he checked my prostrate
[29:15] he said your prostrate is
[29:17] fine he drew some more blood to do a PSA
[29:21] check and he called me a day or two
[29:24] after that and said your PSA has dropped
[29:29] to to four and he said I'll see you in
[29:32] six
[29:40] months
[29:45] am that's that can get scary them
[29:47] numbers but God's a numerologist
[29:51] amen he got an answer for it we got a
[29:54] text from a neighbor uh of ours um
[29:58] she she has a daughter that's really
[30:01] really really got autism really bad so
[30:04] she we chat with her occasionally but
[30:05] she has people coming over to help her
[30:07] um you know caregive for the for the
[30:09] daughter and uh one of them uh just had
[30:13] a grandbaby and apparently when they
[30:16] were the little guy's name is Leo so
[30:19] apparently when they were when they were
[30:22] giving birth or the mama was giving
[30:24] birth um I'm not sure how it works but
[30:26] the doctors kind of help with something
[30:29] to get it out and they nicked his head
[30:31] in the back nicked
[30:33] it so
[30:37] um they you know they were trying to get
[30:39] it tested help me out if I'm wrong on
[30:41] this they were they were testing it but
[30:43] theyve concluded that it's uh menitis
[30:46] that was that it's developed into
[30:48] menitis in the little
[30:55] sword yeah just kind of blowing it
[31:11] yeah to Charlotte to line so yeah he's a
[31:16] week old so they've asked us to bring
[31:17] his name up that God can take care of it
[31:20] you know
[31:23] um um so his little his his name is Leo
[31:26] he's just a little guy
[31:29] and um you know I think that's probably
[31:31] a a common practice is it not um sister
[31:34] Rosemary about
[31:43] helping yeah we don't know
[31:50] that yeah it's just kind of sad that
[31:53] they would try to you know that's her
[31:55] opinion you know that they're trying to
[31:57] just kind of blow it off and minimize it
[31:59] and I I mean I can understand that but
[32:02] let's stand this morning we're going to
[32:03] go to the Lord this morning I'm going to

[1:06:33] brothers he have many Brethren he's the
[1:06:36] first born among many what in other word
[1:06:39] he was not the only one that came out
[1:06:41] from that
[1:06:46] womb are we together but whoever came
[1:06:49] from that womb need to be
[1:06:52] confirmed or match him that's exactly
[1:06:56] amen because in the beginning he was the
[1:06:58] first one that was created as the
[1:07:01] logos that's right Amen in the beginning
[1:07:05] was the
[1:07:06] word and the Word was with who and the
[1:07:10] Word was what God so God gave birth to
[1:07:15] himself but God never stopped that birth
[1:07:18] right there he birth other Sons that's
[1:07:22] right but the first one that came was
[1:07:26] Christ and after Christ there are
[1:07:29] brothers that follow Christ and Christ
[1:07:32] and all the brothers are one church and
[1:07:36] Christ is the
[1:07:38] [Applause]
[1:07:42] pastor he's the firstborn among many
[1:07:47] Brethren so he's your brother that's
[1:07:50] right amen I'm reading the Bible he is
[1:07:54] your brother
[1:07:57] amen don't worry Colossians 1 verse1 15
[1:08:01] the Bible say who Jesus Christ is the
[1:08:05] image of what the invisible God the
[1:08:08] first born you see that again of what
[1:08:11] every creature so before God create any
[1:08:14] of us he created himself first that's
[1:08:17] right God created himself God became a
[1:08:23] son the son is not different than the
[1:08:26] Father the Son is another manifestation
[1:08:30] of the Father the father lower himself
[1:08:34] to become a
[1:08:36] son in other word we are fragments of
[1:08:46] God I have a question what happened in
[1:08:48] the app
[1:08:50] room what happened in the Apper room the
[1:08:53] pillar of fire came and did
[1:08:56] what and chop himself why was he
[1:08:58] chopping himself up because those are
[1:09:01] are Pillar of
[1:09:05] Fire make sense he chop himself in other
[1:09:09] words from the pillar of fire were
[1:09:11] coming out some pillars of fire because
[1:09:15] those Pillar of Fire were already in
[1:09:17] eternity so when he's coming in the
[1:09:20] upper room he have a list of the Church
[1:09:23] of the first born the Church of the
[1:09:26] firstborn in heaven God name that are
[1:09:29] written if your name is over there God
[1:09:32] will find your God part and dispatch it
[1:09:36] and release it so your Pillar of Fire is
[1:09:40] different than my Pillar of Fire but
[1:09:42] it's the same material
[1:09:47] amen so when we bring all the pillar of
[1:09:50] fire together then we begin to get God
[1:09:53] back again like he was in the
[1:09:57] [Applause]
[1:10:01] original that's why it's not good for
[1:10:04] God to be
[1:10:05] alone because he's missing part of
[1:10:08] himself he's missing a rib and that rib
[1:10:12] need to be brought back again through
[1:10:15] marriage amen are we together amen so
[1:10:19] God stand in the congregation of the
[1:10:22] might it is a congregation it it is a
[1:10:25] church it is an assembly it is a
[1:10:28] tabernacle where God is the

[2:46:02] many things comes through our
[2:46:05] mind and the more the word is unfolded
[2:46:09] the more regret comes that I wish I have
[2:46:13] known this 10
[2:46:15] years I wish I never was born in that
[2:46:18] family
[2:46:19] I wish I was born with a good family
