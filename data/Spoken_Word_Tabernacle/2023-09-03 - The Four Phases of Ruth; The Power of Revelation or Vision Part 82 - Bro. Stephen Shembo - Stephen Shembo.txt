amen amen so in 10 years 10 more years if the Lord tarries you'll be 27. that's good amen I'm going to invite um sister zaddy to come up she has a testimony she wants to give really quick and then Charles the Third has one as well a man praise God Amen God bless you Saints I just wanted to give this testimony for the glory of God um first I want to thank him for another year of Life on August 10th I turned 29th and so grateful just to be on earth for another year but mostly to be able to be a child of God and a servant of God it's a privilege to be a Christian I just want to also thank him for um bringing me as far as he has I'm just continuously working and revealing himself to me all of us but I especially thank him just for the revelations that he's given me um I just wanted to let him know how grateful I am just for his leadership um I've been working at Hilton Garden in the hotel that we used to have church in and um I've been there for a year and a month maybe and I feel like I I caught a routine that the Lord has always done in my life when it comes to jobs most of the jobs that I've worked since I started working for the most part I always walk in and get the job I usually don't apply before getting the job and I never really realized that until this last time where he kind of dropped it in my my heart to say that I'm the one who's providing these opportunities for you it's not you um because you know sometimes you can think it's you know your personality or these things that that you get granted but when you have the Revelation that it's God that you know is in control of everything in your life then you can realize who's really orchestrating things so um I walked into um this just drop and now I can say what it was because I was keeping it hush because I was trying that approach where you keep it quiet until the Lord provides um but um when we're working as a sales expert for a mattress firm um so if you need Matt I'm joking I'm joking but um basically I walked into the job and the the manager you know she had a very pleasant demeanor about her and I was having trouble with Management in my last job but instead of getting upset uh well I actually was frustrated but instead of like acting on I was like you know what Lord you've always come through for me every single time I believe that you'll do the same so I don't need to worry about my bills I don't need to worry about anything and I didn't um and through the month of August though things were tight financially I was able or things were everything was covered all my bills everything through different means um the Lord provided and I was so so grateful because I was like I didn't know how I was going to do it um and then in between that that's when the job came and literally it was like just a transition all the bills are just covered right between I get into the next payroll and so I just wanted to give glory to God and encourage anybody who you know may be going through anything that you know if you just keep your mind on Christ you know he will provide and lastly on Wednesday brother Paul who preached everything that that brother was saying was everything that was contemplating on or I'm sorry not contemplating um um thinking on for the like the last two months three months you know just the Lord dealing with me about having faith and just believing and having the spoken word and that same approach in which I was taking I can see that he confirmed it for me once they say that you're on the right track and I just keep going in that direction and so I just wanted to thank the Lord for that this morning thank you Hallelujah amen all right God bless you thanks I first want to say thank you for your prayers amen I appreciate your prayers a lot so um I just wanted to give a testimony on how like everything actually like went like during the event um so I was in the TA section of the math and help center for my uh on for a math problem and like the TA guy he was like on his phone for a second and he like got like super like scared out of nowhere and I was like what is it what's wrong with him and he like was like okay we're gonna go and there was so it was me uh two girls I was Ill right there and there was two two or three girls I was at a table um across the room and then there was a guy in the back and another guy over here in the back and they just like got up and were leaving and so I was getting my stuff and the guy was like so scared it was like he's forgot he was in a leadership role he was like was leaving everybody and I was I was first I understand what's going on so I looked at my phone and it said it was an active shooter find shelter get away from Windows I was like okay so um I got my stuff and I realized he was leaving the two guys that were on in their headphones they had headphones on they were working so um I went to them and I calmly told them you know the situation I said I'd advise with the Packer things and leave and follow the group and um they said okay thank you very much and I was like well I said I said I feel bad if you guys got shot and I was the last one I see y'all yeah so so they ended up packing their stuff and they went uh to leave uh follow the group and I went finished packing my stuff and as I walked out the door they were going and I was like okay so they left so so I started walking around and I do want to thank the Lord because I was surprisingly calm through the whole Endeavor like I really wasn't like frantic at all so I was I was like walking around trying to find them at first then I found myself in the basement of the building and there was two older gentlemen they're like staff members and he was like what are you doing you know you need to go and hide and I was like well did you see a group of people I'm trying to find a group I was with and he was like well I put some people in the break room and it was like a solid metal door he had to like use a key to open so he put me in there and he's like these the people and I was like no I didn't know who they were so I said I'm not gonna be picky though right so I went I went in there with them and there was um there was like so there's like a couch right here couch right here and there was a couch um right in front of me and there was a girl sitting on the couch and there was like an empty spot right there and I sat next to her and she was like really frantic like every time I swear I said something she was like shut up don't say anything about it be quiet and it was it was like crazy because they were all like very like uh like their nerves are jumpy and everything and I sat down and I was like well any of y'all gonna Cactus coming with this math problem in the office started laughing because I just wanted to like kind of get their minds off the situation and um they were like it's hard laughing and so we worked on the amount of time for like 20 minutes and then I said this is getting boring I started playing games on the computer I got them to play games with me on the computer and then uh after that it was like quiet for a while and I started thinking about it again you could tell they're like try to like get jumpy every time they heard something so I said man I'm hungry and they started laughing again and so and then throughout throughout the whole Endeavor like it was like the Lord was like I was like praying the whole time but I wasn't praying you know getting me through the situation and protecting me it's just I was so like calm I just knew I was okay and I was like the whole time I was praying thank you Jesus for getting me down here amen amen because I was just thinking like you know that I lost my group you know I could have very well like been in danger and then somehow I'm in a basement behind a securely locked door you know like why did that happen to me and then um like and also the other miracle was the where the man got shot at and died the teacher um he was right across from the street from where I would have been two hours later and then the um the shooter's vehicle where I was actively hiding at was right outside the building so he was around me the whole time but just couldn't find him so I was like that's right you know I was talking to my father and we were saying you know he messed up his GPS he was trying to find me but he couldn't find me so that's why that's why that GPS do for God's protective system for him amen amen let's stand I don't have any prayer requests this morning amen I'm sure we have some unspoken amen and we probably could acknowledge those by lifting the hands you want to come up brother pray over these real quick in the tithing amen let us pray Precious Jesus we thank you Heavenly Father for all the things you're doing in our lives Lord God father we thank you Heavenly Father for allowing us to have a place of shelter and refuge in your lord Jesus Christ father we

announcement thank God we got a little bit of extra time because we didn't have any special so let's see if we can get advantage of it I believe everybody is up to date with the sermon everybody is reading the Bible twice a day amen everybody's reading the Bible twice a day Amen brother Branham say you read it one chapter in the morning and one chapter before you go to bed do you want me to send you those quotes again are we clear on that we clear on that right the technicians are working pretty hard they got me a little device here that I can heal myself the way you hear me so now if you don't say a man I can still hear myself when I say amen I hear myself saying amen amen so continue to read your Cod book continue to read your changes continue to read your skills and your 70 weeks of Daniel Amen uh we have a wonderful young man meeting yesterday you heard them saying amen a wonderful one they gave me 25 questions all together total and I Only Could tackle five of them so at this point they should know how to deal with sisters what they learned yesterday I told them I said I don't want any complaint from your matters because now you know how you can deal with Mama how you can deal with your sister and how you can deal with your wife so whoever was not there you need to catch up quickly and make sure you meet with the young men so they can tell you what's going on I don't want headache in your marriages I want you to treat young sisters the correct way like Christians should amen you know most of the time we say women are complicated there is a reason why they're complicated amen there is a reason why they're complicated they're not complicated just the way they complicated it is not even a complication it is something that we men lack to understand and because we don't understand that we call that complications one of these they will talk to the married people amen can you say Amen is everybody okay sisters are not complicated they are not complicated at all that's what the world say the problem is we don't understand their world that's where we get in trouble and I'm gonna show you that by the scripture that a man should understand the woman world I showed the young men's yesterday they were there I even gave them scripture it seems like the Holy Spirit gave me a different gear when I was talking to the young man and I got scripture that unfortunately I didn't give to the young sisters they came later on so when they heard that the guiding something you don't they were all clapping their hands [Laughter] they were all happy they said we patriarch we the one that are supposed to know those things so I will try my best to refer okay not fair but fur so I will try to give you the scripture before we start a war amen I never even seen it I don't know how I forgot it and the Holy Spirit brought it to me and give me two scripture and now the third and the fourth one so there should be no question at all with something that I don't want to say here and I told them if you ever marry a woman outside this church who is a message believer search for some time so we can sit and we make sure we can brainwash somebody pretty good and make sure what they have is in the word and the message of the hour and if you young sister ever get married to a young man outside this church bring it to me let's sit and let's talk a little bit let me make sure he understands what he's getting into it amen before you become the preacher at home you're the one giving quotes and he doesn't know which coach you're talking about and you keep pulling code one after the other until he's like are you preaching to me you're not preaching I'm just exhorted So to avoid that preaching bring it to me I know what to do I know how to download the USB and I'll put it together amen so give me some time and we'll work together amen glory to God so brother able please if you can work with the young man so we can continue the questions and young sisters I'm still waiting sister Divine on the date for you so we can continue what we're supposed to be dealing with amen Lord's willing on September the 16th this is our question and answer brother Mark Hall contacted me and uh he's having a youth meeting I believe the 14th 15th and 16th something like that but I have the flyer I will give it to the Deacon and they will post it on the on the wall so if somebody have some free time and you have time to go support it be more than happy to go ahead and show some fellowship so he told me that and he sent me the uh the flyer so I would download it and print it out and give it to the Deacon so they can put it on the board I believe I got everything squared away so let's go straight to our scripture now first Samuel chapter 28. can you hear me very good okay I have to be adjusted to hear myself now glory to God praise God amen amen praise God it's first Samuel chapter 28. I told the young man yesterday I say on Sunday when I'm preaching I don't want anybody to have trouble every young man stay up so you get what we're about to deliver every young man stay up if you're struggling a little bit with sleeping you go in the back there I don't want you missing anything amen amen because you are patriarch you're the head of the family the head of the family just like the scripture says it's amazing how people have a problem with God's order I don't know what this world is going to if you're there you can say Amen first Samuel chapter 28 verse 5. the Bible says and when Saul sold the host of the philistine he was afraid and his heart greatly trembled and when Saul in choir of the Lord you might be seated so went and want to hear from God he inquired of the Lord amen how did he inquire from the Lord what was he looking for amen the Bible says verse 6 and when Saul in choir of the Lord the Lord answered him not so the Lord have a way to answer but this time he didn't answer and brother Branham said the reason why because he vaccinated so when you backslide you shut yourself from God it doesn't mean it's God is Not There but it's just God cannot reach to you when it will continue with prayer I will show you why we have to start by confessing our sin first there is a reason why because in the prayer of Jesus Christ forgive us sin was not at the beginning it was somewhere in the middle but when we pray we need to start with there is a reason why and the Bible says and Saul inquire of the Lord and the Lord answer him not neither by what dreams my brother you there yes sir thank you neither by dream nor by what your room you know what I mean John yes sir you remember in time right in which brother brought them say it's the word amen neither by dream not by neither by dream nor by the Europe nor by what Prophets so this is God's system is God's sister of operating amen so if you want to talk to God God can talk to you through a dream God can speak to you through the urine you know the human right you go the prophet goes before the priest the priest had it on the chest amen like a breastplate and then you go you speak and whatever you speak will shine light or not or by the prophet so God can use an inspiration by dream or he can use the real momentum which brother Branham say it's the word or he can speak to you by the prophet and Prophet see visions amen if you recall last Sunday we spoke brother Branham says this and Discord just reminding you brother Branham say but where my faith is based he is concerning a gift that was given me some people receive a revelation some people pick it up out of the water the word the Europe some people take it by what inspiration man is a vision because he's a prophet so God can speak through the dreams he can speak straight by a prophet or God can speak straight through the yo momentum and the prophet in the New Testament brother Branham say it's a preacher in other words when a preacher is preaching the word God can use the preaching of the word and speak to you something straight like that and then you pick it up and that's your Revelation right there that's why we go to church so that we can hear from God Amen and the prophet himself sees also dreams the Bible says in number 12 verse 6 that he says he now my word if there be a water Prophet among you I the Lord will make myself known unto him in what a vision and will speak unto him in a water a dream everybody clear amen a prophet can see a vision or a prophet can even see a dream a dream is when the prophet is sleeping we went through that amen and a vision is when the prophet is awake everybody clear amen we clear so far so verse 7 then say so to his servant God doesn't want to speak seek me a woman that has a what a familiar spirit so when God locks a revelation he opened the door for you to get Revelation from any sources amen in other words you now going into a dangerous ground because God can speak to you in other words lack of Revelation lack of God talking to you amen remove the limits out of your life amen you don't control yourself anymore if God would have spoken in the dream Saul would not have went to the witch if God would have spoken into the your momentum Saul would not have gone to the witch that's right if God would have answered by the prophet Saul would not have wandered all around and and and looking for her for a witch the reason why Saul is going to the witch is because there is no more Revelation amen nobody verse 7 then say song to his servant seek me a woman that has a water familiar Spirit Saul was not looking for this woman to do witchcraft he went through this channel trying to get God from that channel amen is my Bible different amen is my Bible different is my Bible different so when God doesn't speak forget the witch you will find yourself listening to a witch oh she's uh what is a witch I know you thinking about maybe going into the mall and see a fortune tell a woman that's what you're thinking about let me show you the real witch you want to know him huh you want to know the witch let me continue first and then I'll show you the witch amen the Bible says this the Bible says this in the Book of Proverbs verse chapter 27 verse 7. the Bible says that the full soul is that in other words the soul that have eaten and he's full there is no more room for food that's all loaf a honeycomb to explain to you this easily if I give you food and you eat until you fool you cannot eat no more even if I bring you a chocolate cake oh it's strawberry cake you are full you won't even mind the cake you will disgust the cake because you are full so whoever who eat good does it even even a good food you don't need it anymore is it clear now now look at the second part but to the hook hungry Soul every bitter thing is how sweet wow so when you hungry and you don't get food you will eat from a garbage can when you're hungry and you don't eat food you will eat for YouTube you will eat anything that is on YouTube it would taste sweet because you're hungry because you are on the survivor mode like Saul was in survivor mode in survival mode anything help even if it comes from a garbage can you will eat to survive song now forgot who he is he begin to listen to a witch he even want to talk to a Witcher and if you read this the story down the witch even cook for him it is written in your Bible wow amen amen amen verse 7 then say Saul to his servant seek me a woman that has a familiar spirit a medium amen that I may go to her and inquire of her and his servant said to him behold there is a woman that has a familiar spirit and water and door so somebody already knows there is some activity going on there how did they know there was a woman over there they were a Christian how did they know there was a woman over there and they even know the corner how did you know that corner over there when we talk we say do you know some yeah yeah yeah if you go this way you pass this way you pass this how do you know that place how do you know that nightclub how do you know there is a nightclub over there what were you doing over there how do you know the hours of operation huh verse 8 Lord help me and so disguise himself and put on the water Raymond do you see when you're trying to do something wrong you don't want no brother to see you now you will see a brother putting a hat and he changed his way of walking because he doesn't want to be seen why is your heart all the way here why do you have glasses to camouflage because you don't want somebody to meet you at the movie theater everybody okay amen and he disguise himself and put on other water Raymond not the ravemen that he usually put he have to change with me amen amen and he went and two men with him and they came to the woman by what night they even have the address wow and he said I pray you divine to Me by The Familiar spirit and bring me him up whom I shall name to you so poisson was not looking for the devil verse 9 and the woman said behold say to him behold you know what who so have done who was talking to the woman so he was saw this guy until the woman doesn't remember or know that this is so the woman is talking to Saul about Saul what testimony is the woman giving About Soul watch the testimony he said and the woman said to him behold you know what Saul has done how he has cut off those that have what familiar spirits he's giving a very bad stuff that Saul destroy he's going back again to Eden amen amen and The Wizard out of the land wherefore then lay you a snare for my life to cause me to water die so when God doesn't give instruction you will eat the very thing that you condemn before everybody okay you stood against it you condemn it but because God doesn't say anything guess what you go back again to your own vomit the family the things that you already vomit you don't even want to see now you're going back to your own vomit to eat it why because of a lack of Revelation amen amen what is a witch he got used to Harry Potter but let's look at this Rich bill we're looking at somebody on a broom who's flying let's look at this switch here this switch here doesn't have a group he looks very good she looks very good very nice let's see the witch brother Branham saying and they're in the vision of the brother brother Branham say and they were singing this here and doing what twist and roll songs you go to make parties now [Music] and they're putting that even on Facebook you know I already preach about music you know or ever what you call going down doing what singing there and going by I said is that the church brother Branham look at the music that was playing and the dancing that the people were dancing that are supposed to be Christian and brother Branham asked a question is that the church in other words when you go to a party you dance somebody's sitting and saying is that a message believer is that a message believe a sister dancing like that in that kind of a music this was not a worldly music it was a Christian music amen but he was playing in the wisdom of rock and roll amen amen amen and brother Branham say and I was standing there and in my heart I was doing what crying and this hope which brother brought them say the churches that were dancing wrong were all led by a witch ER wow you don't know the scripture you don't know the quote Brother Brad I'm saying at the beginning the bread came without any problem but the other Church began to come and the Church of America and every other country and brother Branham saying in front of those churches there was a witch leading them everybody okay amen the witch that you destroy at the beginning you going

river [Applause] everybody okay amen everybody okay brother Branham said they were leading them well right straight down the road down the road where she was watering going and she went off to the water the left and disappear away in chaos reading this music and making really funny sound and shaking their body and you hear people shake shake shake shake keep shaking your body everybody okay and shaking their body one side and then the other and then like that carry on like that doing what walking any question also let's go to our second scripture prophet proof I am on the second special everything glory to God so lack of instruction lack of vision lack of Revelation from God open the door to consult a witch that's why it's important to hear from God because if you're hungry and you're seeking God and God is not answering you're gonna eat from anything from a garbage canner amen and you're gonna have all kind of wisdom that they will put on you oh it's wisdom they they just giving advice of life they themselves look at their life hey everybody okay young man wake up today Proverbs Chapter 30 uh chapter 29 verse 18. if you dare you can say amen amen Oh Glory to God let's go where there is water no vision what happened when there is no vision amen what is the result the Bible says when there is no vision the people do what you perish when we hear that word perish we usually think about dying when we say there is no vision the people died that's not what the scripture says if you look at another translation and you check the root of the word perish everybody okay the correct word is restraint in other words when there is no vision the people do not have restraint and lack of restraint will make you perish the one who's reading even in French will see that you look at another translation the correct translation is when there is no vision the people live without restraint amen amen in other words if you don't have a vision you're going to leave any kind of ways when we say restraint the best way to describe restraint is what Paul uses Paul says this in uh James chapter 3 verse 3. Paul says that behold we put what bits do you know what a is it's called a brother we put beats in horses math that they may do What obey us so the reason why we take Brits and brother and put it in the horse's mouth it's to control the horse so the Restraint of a brother on the horse's mouth amen bring obedience I don't know if you're getting me in other words if you take the brother off the horses the horse says everybody okay so the reason why they put a brother on the horse mask Paulie said James is saying that the reason why they put that is to uh to bring the the the horse in obedience so every a brother is a restraint amen so when a restraint come in your life it brings obedience [Music] as soon as there is a restraint on a horse not only do the horse obey me but the horse will begin to move according to my desire my direction in other words the horses will begin to do the will of the horse riding everybody okay so the brother on a horse remove the self-wheel of the horse amen everybody okay and the will of the horse is no longer there now the horse is reflecting the will of the one ready everybody okay if they rather want to go to Charlotte the horse will go to Charlotte the horse have no more Direction but the direction of the master the horse have no more will no more desire but the desire of the one running and to bring a horse to that level you must put a brother you must put a restraint you must put something that will limit that will control the movement of a horse amen and now Solomon say if there is no vision amen the people have no restraint in other words a vision from God will bring restraint when you catch God vision for your life that Vision will put you into a different moment that Vision will rock your life everybody good good everybody good Solomon say a lack of vision amen where there is no vision the people perish in other words the people live without self-control they are uncontrolled amen he says the people perish but he that keep if they want the love happy is he with that vision so didn't have any more restraint he can eat anything and before you know it he goes to the witch because the vision put a brother on soul when they took the vision of God doesn't speak by Vision God doesn't speak by dream God do not speak by anything now there is no more brother there is no more restraint so forgot who he is he forgot what he did he forgot what he destroyed he now go back to what he destroyed and begin to end it what caused him because lack of a vision any question let's go to look one lack of vision lack of a revelation it's a problem if you dare you can say a man Luke chapter 1 verse 34 I'm going down because we already dealt with the first one then say Mary to the angel how shall it be seeing a no no not a man and the angel answer and say to her the Holy Ghost shall come upon you and the power of the highest shall overshadow you therefore also the holy thing which shall be born of you shall be called The Son of God and behold we went through this your cousin Elizabeth amen she also she has also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called Baron for with God nothing shall be impossible we clear amen verse 38 and Mary say behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to your word and the angel did what departed from her the scripture never describe anything happening to me beside the conversation the package was delivered to the right address and Mary look at the package he say is this my package they say yes this belong to you you are highly favored you say okay if this is what God wants for my life how is this going to happen God help her a little bit brother Branham said because nothing like that happened before and God gave a little bit more explanation so that Mary can receive the package when the explanation was given like it's not you it is the Holy Ghost who will do it Mary say you know what let it be down unto me according to water that's all that happened that's what we know but look what happened in Mary that we didn't know because of what she said when she said no sensation no feeling she didn't scream she didn't roll on the ground she just said be unto me according to his word what is that declaration doing in Mary's life let's see what he does verse 39 and Mary arose in water those days so it was not like seven months in the very within the very same period Mary moved amen she arose in those days and went into the Hill Country with haste into a city of water Judah because they told her about Elizabeth so she packed everything quickly and just move on straight I'm gonna see what happened over there and enter into the house of Zechariah indeed what saluted Elizabeth and he came to pass that when Elizabeth heard the water situation of Mary the salutation what kind of salutation is it if I tell you hi and the baby begin to jump you need the Thunder for this amen it was not like hello that's not the sanitation there was a salutation different only a thunder can reveal this and brother Branham went inside and brother Branham got into the conversation and he looked at the conversation he said it was not alone he said the two girls were talking a little bit I will show you a scripture like that amen because sometimes the Bible will say something and hide something and you have to go to another book to see what really happened between the storm I will prove to you everybody okay according to what they say here it's just a salutation hello hello and the baby begin to jump no the baby didn't jump like that amen there was something that was spoken in that salutation that made the baby jump and brother Branham say it was the name of Jesus Christ that was mentioned by Mary and the First Time The Name of Jesus Christ was mentioned not by Angel but by a human being he brought a dead baby to life [Applause] [Music] how can the word of Mary begin to bring Resurrection where did she get the power of Resurrection because the judge was dead amen so the simple fact of saying be unto me according to your word have already transferred power and Mary didn't know until she spoke and she began to see things begin to happen so when you're saying a man to this message amen you might not feel nothing [Applause] you might not see a lot of things happening but when you gonna speak you will see what was holding you amen brother Branham say the restoration of the word bring the restoration of the power so when you receive the word you are actually transferring power amen [Applause] amen means so be in other words be unto me [Applause] that's why when I tell you say amen I know why I'm saying you man because I want you to say beer to me so that the power can be changed [Music] [Applause] don't say Amen to me as a man but you say Amen to the world Amen amen [Applause] oh my God where am I at brother Kelly amen amen and he came to pass when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary the babe did what lived in her womb leap in her womb now we're calling brother Stephen we fondly believe amen and Elish and Elisabeth was filled with the water the holy ghost look what [Music] he goes will come upon you now the Holy Ghost begin to go to somebody else all she had to do is be they add to me that's all [Music] everybody okay everybody good everybody good amen verse 42 and she spoke out this is Elizabeth with a loud voice and said blessed are you among what women follow me carefully Karma and what blessed is the fruit of thy womb stop Elizabeth Mary spoke to the angel the angel said this is what's going to happen to you she said how is it going to happen to you Mary said uh the angel said the Holy Ghost will come on you and whatever will come on you will do something on you according to Mary maybe okay let me wait for the Holy Ghost so I'm waiting suddenly I will heal then I know oh now something happened in me brother Branham say she never heard anything nothing happened to her but when Elizabeth got the holy ghost Elizabeth say the fruit of your word so Elizabeth begin to see through the womb of Mary when did the baby get today Elizabeth said the fruit of your water in other words Mary was already pregnant I'm reading the Bible when did the baby get there So when you say amen amen when he says [Music] [Applause] forward amen Mary didn't have morning sickness yet but the baby was still there so when you ask God for something [Applause] you have not seen what you're asking yet it doesn't mean it's nothing [Applause] the morning sickness sister oga it's only a language to tell you that something is there amen but when they get there we don't know and blessed is the fruit of your what so she was already pregnant when verse 43 and what is this to me that the mother so Mary was already a mother without any symptoms just saying be unto me you're already a mother what is this that the mother of my Lord so Jesus was already there should come unto what me not the future mother of my Lord she is already the mother of my Lord everybody okay why do I know that you already are pregnant Mary why how did I know you already are pregnant how do I know that something already happened to you how do I know that you are not the same marriage that I used to know verse 44 for law as soon as the water voice of your water salutation [Music] amen the voice of the salutation sanded in my water ears is the ear connected to the womb how did John the Baptist heard that and sounded in my ear that babes did what leap in my water for water Joy watch verse 45 and blessed is she that did what believe how did she know Mary believe she was not there he was the faith of Mary that put the baby there and that Faith was only expressed by Beyond Two that's all amen believed for dare shall be a water performance of those things which were taught her from who the Lord where did she were told to marry she was not there she didn't have any Facebook at that time how did she know because the same holy ghost that work with Mary was now in water and begin to reveal to Elizabeth the things that Elizabeth was not dead and even tell Mary that hey if you still have doubt about what you say amen I already said that you already have it you are pregnant you're a mother in other words she begin to confirm Mary of what God already done in her life that she had not seen yet that's why when you walk when you are getting something from God make sure you stay around Elizabeth [Applause] everybody okay stay around positive people amen stay around people that will tell you you know what happened on Wednesday something happened to me too so bless me amen and let Mary and Elizabeth begin to worship before you know it the anointing will strike you [Applause] if you're not Elizabeth be of my life because I don't want you to keep me off decision I want somebody who will keep me on your attention somebody will keep me in line somebody will remind me what God already done for me [Music] yeah glory to God let's pray my friend Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father we thank you for your grace for your

to God Amen is the four phases of roof the power of Revelation or the power of vision what does revelation do to you we need to walk by vision we need to walk by Revelation but what does revelation do to you amen amen and as a team I will keep this Romans 8 verse 14 for as many as are LED by the word spirit of God the sons of God so the sons of God are the fire the eyes in other words in their life the Holy Spirit tell them stuff the Holy Spirit tells them what to do the Holy Spirit guides them the holy spirit is their GPS the people to whom the Holy Ghost sees the GPS those people are called the sons of God and the Son of God means equal to God that's why Jesus said as the father said to me that's the same way I sent you and brother Branham said the father son Jesus To Us by getting in Jesus Christ that's why God come into you by the Holy Ghost amen so that God himself can drive you into what he wants you to be [Applause] everybody okay amen everybody do this we're still under the

do it [Music] [Applause] do you want me to tell you what he's telling me do you want me to tell you what he's telling me the direction that you think that you are running away from God actually it is also his way for you in other words what you think you're running away from God you are actually in his past because he knew you gonna run away prepare extra said Jordan was in the perfect will of God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] have you ever seen a fish in the ball in a noodle bowl when they put a fish in a in a small aquarium and when you come and that fish is running where

and he condemned you and he said you are guilty of prop success [Applause] [Music] [Applause] traveler follow me of my life [Applause] [Music] glory to God that's why when they put Jonah in the water the one they won't kill Jonah the word they just opened up so the world can swallow how can you live in the world baby for three days and he begin to prophesy of Jesus Christ so the running away was to make the New Testament [Applause] [Music] they're running away of Jonah was giving Jesus something to preach [Music] imagine what your entire life is already programmed you would do what God wants

brother Stephen I have trouble I have trial what can I do with the trial I go through listen to brother Branham father help me I'm my God brother Branham say neither can he take you oh can you do what take me until the purpose of God of our water life is water finish that's what Jesus said the court said now it is water finish the today senior at the cross let me continue so we gather from their water consolation nothing nothing will change God's program for you whatever God already programmed you to be there is no devil there is no hair there is no sickness sometimes you went through difficult sickness until the thought you wanna die and for some reason you begin to come back up again and back up again and you come out and they dismiss you for the hospital because you are not finished yet [Music] [Applause] the devil put this one they will move you several us he come with this one you still alive he come with this one you still alive he come with this one you still alive you are invisible based on your problem [Music] [Applause] everybody do this everybody good listen to brother Branham brother Branham saying in paragraph 43 so why does God let trouble come this is our question you want to know the answer let's brother Brown a mentor himself brother Branham saying God do what harness is trouble and put water [Music] in other words God put their brother on your trial [Music] he said he puts water bits in its mouth to make it obey him [Applause] remember the word when Satan is coming towards you before he touches you God said hold on [Music] he said who are you going to brother Charles wait a minute I need to put some brother on you to put that restraint on you only do what a purpose for you to do on him [Music] when Satan wanted to tempt job God gives jobs and limitation he said you can touch him here but don't take his life because job had the purpose of God and the purpose was not fulfilliant there is no way Lucifer can take job out a matter of fact God multiply everything everything double [Applause] your trial has been brought up by God that's why the scripture say he can never give you a trial that is greater than your water greater than your strength because God brought up the child he gives limitation he said only what I want you to do do this this one you do it to your own children not my children [Music] [Applause] [Music] when somebody else discipline your children they discipline them differently than yourself but when you discipline there is something in you that is hurting you because it's your own child so you are disciplining carefully that's how God discipline you sometimes he discipline and he himself goes and say why have I done this [Music] the Bible said God repented when he looked at Israel God repented [Applause] brother Branham say God harness trouble put in the mouth and makes it water obey him just like a horse and those trouble bring us into a water a closer fellowship with God who wins who wins what did the devil do he just brought you closer to God and you are still alive [Applause] so you can turn around and say Satan before you came I didn't know the resurrection but since you came now I know that my redeemer lives [Applause] [Music] I need more revelation [Applause] you will see her second turn around and say get out of here [Music] Amanda glory to God oh my God listen to what brother Branham saying Lord help me to move brother brought him say I said he was a prophet he had to be saved God saved him and God is what not an Indian giver do you know what an Indian giver is do you know what an Indian giver is how many knows what an Indian giver is brother brother say an Indian giver is somebody who comes and gives you something and then tomorrow that same person can come back and say no give me my stuff [Music] brother Branham say God is that like that in other words when God already decided to give you something even God cannot take it back [Applause] everybody okay everybody good listen to brother Prana he said God is not an Indian giver brother said as we call it amen well if God gives you the Holy Ghost knowing that he's going to lose you rather than today I had to write down here why what the foolish thing it will be for him to give you the holy ghost in the first place why did you give me the Holy Ghost and you know I'm gonna die and I will be lost God don't invest like that he's a very good investor [Music] God don't invest for loss [Applause] he always invests to make again you know the parable of the talent everyone that was giving the tenant had the power to multiply hundred percent [Applause] you might impersonate the Holy Ghost and act like you got the Holy Ghost but if you get the Holy Ghost God knows your beginning the end everybody okay that's right that is a lose weight to run business God don't run he's like that here's how infinite he knows the water and from the beginning and know if everything that ever be here fly every night would be a be would ever be on earth he knowed all about it before the word ever water began see would he run his business for he in other words whatever God already gave you at your creation at your making at your fabrication whatever God already put in you God will never remove that and that purpose will be fulfilled exactly how God wanted to be prepared the responsible there is no politician no governmental not even your father can catch that no doctor can change that you know I gave you a testimony when I was born do you know that they wanted to remove me do you know why they wanted to remove me do you know why do you know why because there was a cancer in my mother's womb so me and cancer we started fighting the womb amen [Applause] when the cancer was coming I was there and the predestination said look at the castle [Applause] everybody okay because I was in the casa Edge [Applause] not even [Music] so before he reads the message the message already spoke about me here I am preaching the message because no cancer could stop me [Applause] prophet [Music] [Music] [Applause] there is nothing even fewer even fabroma he won't take you nothing you are born a woman [Applause] and God cannot change his decision because God already saw and he cannot take his word back you are condemned for an expected future you have won them to succeed you are condemned to prosper you are condemned to be in good health you are for them for the spoken word amen [Applause] [Applause] everybody okay everybody good let's see the power of a vision you want to see it let's go to Fest Timothy let's take Paul Lord help me let's go to First Timothy chapter one where am I at glory to God oh my God we're good in time glory to God Hallelujah God has a purpose for you gailed God has a plan a future a thought a project that he that he made you and the way God make you is according to your project [Applause] that's why I say last Sunday you're a woman be happy there is a props but there is a project for you and God has to make you a certain way a certain height a certain complexion your hair have to be a certain way because there is a certain man that will always match that one [Applause] he won't see none of them he's blind because he's also programmed for a certain woman a certain height a certain type that when the woman comes he's already designed [Laughter] Oh Glory to God let me leave that channel let's go let me go to another Channel let's go to First Timothy Oh Glory to God this this thing you need to know them so it gives you peace in the midst of trial when things don't go wrong don't go right you say don't worry Satan I know who I am [Applause] he didn't create me for this you lying this is lying that's what Jonah said this is because Jonah know what God told him let's look at Paul my God glory to God let's look at the power of vision in thoughts First Timothy chapter one if you're there you can say amen amen verse 12 Paul say and I thank Christ Jesus our lord who has done what enabled me for that he counted me how faithful how can you count perfect for putting the the water Christian in prison huh how could Paul be faithful he's blaspheming he's torturing the Christians when God look at him he said Paul is faithful so which Paul was God looking at can I continue can I continue Paul says that he counted me faithful putting me into the water the ministry God didn't see a risk for putting Paul in the ministry because God run his business a certain way so when he looked at Paul he said this is a good asset to put in the business he's going to be faithful everybody okay verse 13 who was before a water a blasphemer Kama and a water a persecutor injurious comma but I obtained what Mercy because I did it how ignorantly unbelief so we got two Paul here we got the first ball that was bad in ignorance not knowing the project of God for his life and we got a second Paul that understood that huh he counted me faithful what what he does to Paul you there verse 14 and the grace of our Lord was how exceeding abundance with water faith and water and love which is in water in Christ Jesus above the faith who gave him the love a Paul of faith and love who gave it to Paul why they didn't give it to Judah Judah only betrayed and was stealing money but Paul was killing and putting people in prison and blaspheming if you look you say wait a minute but Stephen Judah preached the gospel Paul is making a big mistake God was not looking at that everybody okay everybody okay verse 15 and he says this is a faithful sin and worthy of water acceptation of Water all acceptation in other words Everybody Must agree with this I agree with what that Christ Jesus came into the world Amen to save who Sinners of whom I am what Chief how can Paul be a sinner do you think Paul was going to the nightclub I will show you he was a Pharisee of the Pharisee but he found out that he was a religious sinner which is the top really the top sinners The Sinner the jack her off and then knows what he's doing the religious is the top one let me continue amen however for this course I obtain Mercy that in me first amen Jesus Christ must show forth on water long-suffering for a water a pattern to them which should hear after belief on him to Life water Everlasting so Paul was an example that Jesus used to demonstrate his grace that because Jesus knew that there are some people that will come on the future they will do stuff like Paul they will need some hope so let me use Paul and put him as an example so in the future when those people come when they look at Paul they say if Paul can make it I will make it [Music] everybody clear so far everybody clear so far we clear so far let's go to uh Acts chapter 9. we understand Paul here a religious injurious did bad stuff and everything we're trying to see the power of a vision or the power of a revelation let's go to the book of Acts this man that was the Pharisee of the Pharisee they ate today from the stock of Benjamin according to the Lord Paul said he was blameless but when he come to cross he said I was the chief sinner what changed Paul Acts chapter 9 if you dare you can say Amen verse one and Saul yet breathing out what threatening and water Slaughter do you see what he was grieving in other words he was conceiving project to kill Slaughter against the disciple of who the Lord went to the high priest and desired what is you of him and letter to Damascus to the synagogue that if he found of any of this way whether this were men or who women he might bring them out bound to Jerusalem what can how can a man like this be be a child of God they didn't call him he himself went to the high priest he said I'm here I can do the job for you amen who would think what is in power look at the power of a vision you ready you ready amen verse three and as he Journey he came near Damascus and suddenly their son ran about him a water a light from water heaven and he fell on the earth and heard the voice saying unto him what Saul Saul why persecute you me and he said who are you Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom you persecute it is hard for you to kick against the what the breaks and he trembling and astonished say Lord what will you have me to do and the Lord said to him arise and go into the City and it shall be told you what you must what do according to this interpretation God didn't tell Paul what to do he just saw them go and somebody would tell you right but watch the scripture correctly everybody okay somebody would help her but watch the scripture correctly you there you there amen jump to verse 13. you there amen then then ananias answered Jesus Christ let me go to verse 11 or 10 please and there was a certain disciples Damascus and to him say the Lord in a vision ananias and he said behold I am here Lord and the Lord said to him erase and go into the street which is called straight an inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus for behold he does what prayeth how is he praying he need to wait for instruction yet watch and has sin in a what a vision Paul before they even pray for him he begin to see vision that's right everybody okay have sin in a vision a man named ananias coming in and putting his hand on him that he may receive what his side then ananiah says with the Lord I have heard by many of these men how much what evil not good he had done to your Center Jerusalem and here he has Authority from the hype from the chief priest to bind all that call on your name that's the testimony they have about Paul look at God's changing the vision everybody okay amen amen Paul was born for a different purpose than what he was doing amen verse 15 but the Lord said to him go your way for he is the water a chosen vessel when did they chose Paul when he was born when he was serving the devil no sir the purpose of God for power will not change no matter how much mistake how much destruction how much trouble Paul was not killing sinners [Music] Paul was killing Christians the purpose of God in the life of Paul cannot change God cannot stop and say man you kill so much of my children I need to change my mind never God is doomed to use nothing nobody else but Paul be faithful killing why because Paul is a chosen vessel everybody okay the Bible said Paul Yahweh he is a chosen vessel to me to Bear my name before Gentile and Kings and the children of Israel for I will show him her great thing he must suffer for my name water saying this is not God talking to Paul this is God talking to ananias God fixing the vision of ananias fixing fixing the perception of ananias toward Paul because ananias still see Paul as an evil man and God says Paul is not evil Paul in my calendar in my in in the Book of Life he's not a sinner he is a chosen vessel another nice I want you to change your vocabulary [Applause] for men [Applause] and then you could call Paul an evil man but since me and Paul met [Applause] [Music] [Applause] did you get me before you can call Paul a murderer you can call him a blasphemer you can call him a Nigerian man but Paul on the road to Damascus don't call him again that way don't look at him that way change your vision [Applause] thank you do you follow me since you met Jesus Christ somebody must change their vocabulary foreign [Applause] [Music] but if you meet

amen it is not a two-way rule so when division of Paul came to his life Paul stop his car he took the rear viewer and he removed it with a screwdriver everybody okay and he put it on the downstairs so that whenever Paul is driving he will never see what happened in the past because the past will discourage you the best won't weaken you the past will condemn you a class there is no condemnation amen
