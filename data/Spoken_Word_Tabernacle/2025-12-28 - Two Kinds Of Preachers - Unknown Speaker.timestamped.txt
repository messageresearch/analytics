[0:18] WE FOUND OUT THAT IN JOHN CHAPTER 6,
[0:20] buckle up my friend.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; Verse 70, THE BIBLE SAY JESUS SAY JESUS
[0:26] ANSWERED THEM AND SAY, "HAVE I NOT WHAT?
[0:29] &gt;&gt; Chosen you 12."
[0:30] &gt;&gt; JESUS CHOSE 12 disciple
[0:33] &gt;&gt; and he SAY AND ONE OF THEM is what?
[0:36] &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL. SO CALL IS NOT THE END.
[0:40] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[0:44] &gt;&gt; MANY ARE CALLED [screaming]
[0:47] &gt;&gt; BUT the chosen.
[0:50] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[0:51] &gt;&gt; HE CHOSE 12.
[0:53] &gt;&gt; BUT ONE OF THEM WAS A DEVIL.
[0:56] &gt;&gt; SO THE TRUE BREAD
[0:59] AMONG THE DISCIPLE WAS ONLY 11 PEOPLE.
[1:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:04] &gt;&gt; But be careful. This one here preached
[1:08] the gospel.
[1:11] &gt;&gt; No, that's that's easy for you.
[1:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus say, "I have not chosen you."
[1:16] What?
[1:17] &gt;&gt; One of you is what?
[1:19] &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL.
[1:19] &gt;&gt; THAT DEVIL PREACHED THE GOSPEL.
[1:22] [cheering]
[1:25] &gt;&gt; Can you SAY AMEN?
[1:26] &gt;&gt; THAT DEVIL PRAYED FOR THE SICK.
[1:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30] &gt;&gt; AND THE SICK GOT HEALED.
[1:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:32] &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS A DEVIL.
[1:34] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:36] &gt;&gt; SO THE MINISTRY OF THE SON OF MAN,
[1:39] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:41] &gt;&gt; USUALLY PULL TWO KINDS OF PREACHER.
[1:45] [cheering]
[1:49] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:51] &gt;&gt; HE USUALLY PULL TWO KIND OF MINISTRY.
[1:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:55] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL SEE PREACHER THAT ARE TRUE
[1:57] BRIDE
[1:58] &gt;&gt; AND THEY WILL BE ADDED THAT ARE DEVILS.
[2:03] IT'S HARD TO SAY,
[2:05] &gt;&gt; PREACHER,
[2:06] &gt;&gt; BUT BE CAREFUL. THOSE DEVIL WILL PREACH
[2:08] THE MESSAGE FOR A WHILE.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:11] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. [screaming]
[2:12] &gt;&gt; THOSE DEVIL WILL DO MIRACLES.
[2:14] &gt;&gt; UH-HUH.
[2:18] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:20] &gt;&gt; UNTIL A CERTAIN LEVEL.
[2:22] &gt;&gt; UH-HUH.
[2:23] &gt;&gt; SO, BE CAREFUL WITH MIRACLE.
[2:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:26] &gt;&gt; AND HEALING.
[2:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:28] &gt;&gt; LORD, LORD, HAVE WE NOT CAST THAT DEVIL?
[2:31] THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:32] &gt;&gt; HAVE WE NOW PROPHESIED
[2:34] &gt;&gt; AND THE LORD SAY I NEVER KNEW YOU.
[2:38] &gt;&gt; SO THE MINISTRY OF THE SON OF MAN
[2:41] &gt;&gt; OR IN PLAIN WORD THE [screaming] MESSAGE
[2:43] OF BROTHER BRAHAM HAVE TWO KIND OF
[2:46] PREACHERS.
[2:52] [cheering]
[2:56] HE HAS PREDESTINATED PREACHERS
[2:58] [cheering]
[2:59] &gt;&gt; AND DEVIL PREACHER.
[3:01] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU WATCH WHICH CHURCH YOU
[3:04] GOING TO.
[3:07] [cheering]
[3:11] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[3:12] &gt;&gt; JUDAH MAY PREACH THE GOSPEL AND AFTER A
[3:15] WHILE HE WILL DEVIATE.
[3:18] AFTER A WHILE, HE WOULD DETACH
[3:23] &gt;&gt; from the group.
[3:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:27] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[3:29] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM that was already
[3:32] it's obvious.
[3:33] &gt;&gt; If you detach from the from the message.
[3:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. You collapse.
[3:39] &gt;&gt; So, a new invention is coming.
[3:42] &gt;&gt; It's already on
[3:44] &gt;&gt; where we detach from the message, but we
[3:46] stay IN THE MESSAGE.
[3:48] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]
[3:53] &gt;&gt; YES.
[3:54] &gt;&gt; THE P THE FIRST THE FIRST LINEAGE OF
[3:57] JUDAH
[3:58] &gt;&gt; WAS LEAVING THE MESSAGE AND WHEN THEY
[4:01] LEAVE THEY COLLAPSE.
[4:03] &gt;&gt; THEY LOSE EVERYTHING
[4:05] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE MESSAGE IS WHAT BUILD THEM
[4:07] UP. SO ARE THEY THAT ARE STILL AMONG THE
[4:11] GROUP ALREADY CAUGHT THEIR VISION
[4:14] &gt;&gt; THAT IF YOU PUBLICLY DENOUNCE THE
[4:17] MESSAGE YOU WILL LOSE YOUR PAYCHECK.
[4:20] [cheering]
[4:22] [applause]
[4:24] &gt;&gt; Can you SAY AMEN?
[4:26] &gt;&gt; SO BECAUSE OF THAT WE WILL STAY IN THE
[4:28] MESSAGE
[4:29] &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T GET THE PEOPLE TOO DEEP.
[4:32] [cheering]
[4:37] GIVE THEM ENOUGH RELIGION,
[4:40] &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T TAKE THEM IN THE THIRD POOL.
[4:47] &gt;&gt; You don't get me, my friend.
[4:48] &gt;&gt; Preach, brother.
[4:49] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[4:51] &gt;&gt; PREACH TO THEM LIKE BAPTIST.
[4:54] &gt;&gt; PREACH TO THEM LIKE PENTECOSTAL.
[4:56] &gt;&gt; PREACH TO THEM LIKE METHODIST. BUT DON'T
[5:00] GET INTO THE MYSTERIES
[5:02] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE MYSTERIES IS WHERE LIFE IS.
[5:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[5:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[5:10] &gt;&gt; KEEP THEM WARM [screaming] UP.
[5:12] &gt;&gt; MICROWAVE
[5:14] THE CONGREGATION. MICROWAVE THE
[5:17] CONGREGATION. KEEP THE CONGREGATION WARM
[5:19] [screaming] UP.
[5:24] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[5:25] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? BUT DON'T TOUCH THE
[5:28] STAFF.
[5:31] &gt;&gt; Am I reading a different Bible?
[5:33] &gt;&gt; Who chose Judah
[5:37] &gt;&gt; who gave Judah the ministry?
[5:38] &gt;&gt; Jesus himself
[5:42] &gt;&gt; AND HE HIMSELF SAID, "BUT IT'S A DEVIL."
[5:49] &gt;&gt; SO IF SOMEBODY DON'T LIKE THE MESSAGE,
[5:52] DON'T WORRY.
[5:53] IT'S ONLY AN INDICATION THAT THE MESSAGE
[5:56] IS RIGHT.
[6:01] &gt;&gt; You don't understand me.
[6:03] &gt;&gt; IF EVERYBODY THAT THAT believe the
[6:06] message, no one have refused the
[6:08] message, something is wrong with the
[6:10] message
[6:12] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JESUS CHRIST IS THE SAME.
[6:17] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER THEY DID TO HIM, THEY MUST DO
[6:18] IT NOW. WHEN THEY BEGIN TO LEAVE THE
[6:21] MESSAGE, WE SAY GOOD STUFF.
[6:23] &gt;&gt; NOW WE KNOW WHAT WE GOT. [cheering]
[6:25] &gt;&gt; NOW WE GOT THE SON OF MAN.
[6:27] &gt;&gt; NOW WE KNOW FOR SURE WE ARE IN THE RIGHT
[6:30] PLACE BECAUSE WHATEVER JUDAH DID NEVER
[6:33] INFLUENCE OTHER DISCIPLE.
[6:38] [cheering]
[6:41] &gt;&gt; I hope we together.
[6:43] &gt;&gt; I hope we together. IN JOHN CHAPTER 6
[6:48] VERSE 666,
[6:52] IT WAS NOT ONLY THE MINISTER, THE
[6:54] CONGREGATION,
[6:56] &gt;&gt; THE DISCIPLE, MANY OF THEM LEFT JESUS
[6:58] CHRIST.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE HE SAYING EXCEPT THE MAN
[7:02] EAT WATER
[7:04] &gt;&gt; AND DRINK WATER.
[7:06] &gt;&gt; THEY HAD A PROBLEM WITH THAT MYSTERY.
[7:11] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[7:13] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? AND THEY BEGIN TO LEAVE
[7:15] ALL OF THEM.
[7:16] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS TURNED AROUND.
[7:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT LOSING
[7:21] PEOPLE IN THE CONGREGATION.
[7:24] &gt;&gt; HE LOOK AT THE 11.
[7:26] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
[7:28] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE SO [screaming] GOOD."
[7:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[7:36] &gt;&gt; BUT THE SPOKESMAN PETER CAME OUT.
[7:39] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WHY DO WE GO
[7:42] &gt;&gt; IN ETERNITY? ME AND YOU, [cheering]
[7:44] WE'RE DANCING TOGETHER. We came with
[7:47] you. WE CAME FROM YOU. WHERE DO
[7:49] [screaming] WE GO?
[7:52] [cheering]
[7:54] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together.
[7:56] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we're together.
[7:58] [applause and cheering]
[8:02] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORD, IN OTHER WORD, what Peter
[8:05] was telling Jesus Christ, he said, "DO
[8:07] YOU KNOW WHERE OUR ADDRESS IS?
[8:10] &gt;&gt; OUR ADDRESS IS IN HEAVEN." YES.
[8:12] &gt;&gt; SO WHERE DO WE GO IN HELL? WE DON'T HAVE
[8:14] AN ADDRESS THERE.
[8:18] &gt;&gt; WHERE ELSE SHOULD WE GO?
[8:20] &gt;&gt; YOU [screaming] THE ONLY ONE
[8:22] &gt;&gt; THAT HAVE ETERNAL LIFE.
[8:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[8:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[8:31] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU SWALLOW THIS?
[8:33] &gt;&gt; I'm just appetizing. Can you swallow
[8:35] this?
[8:36] &gt;&gt; PETER SAID THAT WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST,
[8:45] DID I SAY SOMETHING WRONG?
[8:47] &gt;&gt; PETER GOT THE HOLY GHOST ON THE DAY OF
[8:49] PENTECOST. IN OTHER WORDS, EVEN IF
[8:52] YOU'RE NOT BORN AGAIN YET, [cheering]
[8:55] [applause]
[8:58] &gt;&gt; NO ONE CAN MOVE YOU FROM THIS MESSAGE
[9:05] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S A MATTER OF THE SEED.
[9:09] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[9:10] &gt;&gt; I DON'T UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING. I DON'T
[9:12] KNOW EVERYTHING. BUT I JUST KNOW ONE
[9:15] THING. THERE IS SOMETHING IN ME
[9:17] &gt;&gt; THAT LOVE THIS MESSAGE.
[9:20] [applause and cheering]
[9:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. [cheering]
[9:25] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[9:28] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[9:29] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[9:31] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[9:36] I have chosen you 12.
[9:39] &gt;&gt; One of you is a devil.
[9:42] &gt;&gt; So don't be surprised in the group that
[9:45] is called from God,
[9:46] &gt;&gt; devils are there.
[9:51] &gt;&gt; I didn't call them devil. Jesus say
[9:53] devil.
[9:56] &gt;&gt; Son of hell,
[9:58] &gt;&gt; son of predestination.
[10:01] Are we together? And if you notice, he
[10:03] always attached to money.
[10:10] &gt;&gt; ALL HE WORRY ABOUT IS [screaming] TI AND
[10:12] OFFERING. [cheering]
[10:15] &gt;&gt; IT'S A PAYCHECK,
[10:17] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT THE SOUL.
[10:20] &gt;&gt; HE'S WARMING THE MESSAGE BECAUSE OF A
[10:23] PAYCHECK.
[10:28] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[10:30] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? IN JOHN 13,
[10:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus looked at Judah. He said,
[10:36] "Whatever you want to do,
[10:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't say, "Brother, why are you
[10:42] leaving the message,
[10:44] &gt;&gt; BROTHER? YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS
[10:45] TRUTH." HE SAY, "NO,
[10:47] &gt;&gt; I know what you want to do.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; Do it."
[10:50] &gt;&gt; And do it how?
[10:52] &gt;&gt; In other words, make your show quickly.
[10:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. PUT IT ON YOUTUBE QUICKLY.
[10:59] &gt;&gt; PUT IT ON YOUTUBE QUICKLY.
[11:01] WHEN YOU FINISH WITH ALL YOUR EVIDENCE
[11:04] AND STUPIDITY,
[11:06] THEN THE WORD UNFOLD.
[11:10] [cheering]
[11:13] [applause]
[11:15] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[11:17] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[11:18] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[11:20] &gt;&gt; NOW WHEN JUDAH IS OUT,
[11:24] &gt;&gt; GO VISIT.
[11:25] &gt;&gt; Go search your Bible. Jesus never called
[11:28] the disciple children. Only when Judah
[11:31] was out,
[11:32] &gt;&gt; when Judah was out, HE SAID, "CHILDREN,"
[11:35] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE KNEW NOW THESE ARE MINE.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; "ALL THAT THE FATHER GIVEN ME, I WILL
[11:41] LOSE NONE
[11:42] &gt;&gt; EXCEPT JUDAH."
[11:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[11:46] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN JUDAH LEFT THE MESSAGE,
[11:48] &gt;&gt; yes sir.
[11:51] [cheering]
[11:54] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE LEFT THE MESSAGE, NOW JESUS CAME
[11:57] BACK AGAIN.
[11:58] &gt;&gt; YES. He says that YE HAVE NOT WHAT
[12:01] &gt;&gt; CHOSEN ME
[12:02] &gt;&gt; BUT I HAVE WHAT
[12:03] &gt;&gt; CHOSEN YOU.
[12:04] &gt;&gt; WHY IS HE REPEATING CHOSEN AGAIN?
[12:07] &gt;&gt; HE ALREADY SAID CHOOSING IN JOHN 6.
[12:09] &gt;&gt; NOW HE COMES BACK AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT
[12:11] YOU DIDN'T choose me.
[12:14] &gt;&gt; I am the one that look at the at the at
[12:18] the at the whole sheet and I cut you
[12:21] off.
[12:22] &gt;&gt; And I say I pull this.
[12:24] &gt;&gt; This is the bride.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. I am the ONE THAT CHOSE YOU AND
[12:28] did what?
[12:29] &gt;&gt; Ordained you
[12:30] &gt;&gt; that you should do what?
[12:31] &gt;&gt; Go bring forth fruit.
[12:32] &gt;&gt; Bring forth water.
[12:34] &gt;&gt; Fruit.
[12:35] &gt;&gt; If you are bringing fruit, where is the
[12:36] fruit?
[12:38] &gt;&gt; Inside of you.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; The fruit only come out.
[12:41] &gt;&gt; The fruit must be first in you
[12:43] &gt;&gt; for you to bring fruit.
[12:45] &gt;&gt; And the fruit is a seed.
[12:47] &gt;&gt; And the seed tells your nature.
[12:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So when you bring in
[12:53] THE FRUIT, IT SHOWS the nature of the
[12:55] tree that you are.
[12:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[12:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[13:00] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BROWN SAID THE FRUIT WAS THE
[13:02] WORD.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; SO YOU MUST BE THE WORD TO PRODUCE THE
[13:07] WORD.
[13:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[13:09] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE EVERY SEED MUST REPRODUCE AFTER
[13:13] ITS OWN KIND.
[13:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[13:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:19] &gt;&gt; We clear so far now.
[13:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to Luke 19.
