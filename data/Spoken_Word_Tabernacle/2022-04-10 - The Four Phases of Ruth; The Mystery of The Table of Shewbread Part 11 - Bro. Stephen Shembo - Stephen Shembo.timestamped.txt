[26:54] Saints I'm going to make it quick it's
[26:57] actually two testimonies that um when it
[27:00] happened I didn't have the opportunity
[27:03] or didn't take the opportunity to tell
[27:04] it but I think it was so profound that I
[27:06] wanted to share it with you guys um it
[27:08] was a maybe about two three weeks ago
[27:11] our brother MB came here and preached um
[27:13] on that week um I was sick um with I
[27:16] believe it was a stomach virus that was
[27:18] going around a lot of people had it at
[27:19] my job and different things um I thought
[27:22] I had food poisoning um but I wasn't
[27:24] sure to identify what it was um as as I
[27:28] got really sick it was on the Wednesday
[27:30] that I got sick so the same day I was
[27:32] sick I came home I was throwing up um
[27:36] uncontrollably and um in my heart though
[27:38] I knew it was Wednesday and I wanted to
[27:40] go to church so as I'm home um I'm
[27:43] trying to rest and I'm tossing and
[27:44] turning with excruciating pain um and I
[27:48] couldn't even I was so weak I couldn't
[27:50] even pick up my phone to like send out a
[27:52] message or text anyone to say can you
[27:54] please pray for me I just need someone
[27:55] to intercede on my behalf um um I also
[27:58] said Lord you know help me that's all I
[27:59] could say I didn't really even send a
[28:01] prayer up for myself because I was so
[28:03] disoriented um so I I after throwing up
[28:06] about three times or so I I I went to
[28:09] sleep and when I woke up it was exactly
[28:11] 7:18 now I wasn't aware that brother MCB
[28:14] was preaching on that night and I didn't
[28:16] wasn't aware that I was having people
[28:18] come in town um to basically support him
[28:21] which are my very close friends so I um
[28:23] they called me when they called they
[28:25] said uh you know are you're not going to
[28:27] church I said I've been sick all day I
[28:29] said I couldn't even text anybody to say
[28:31] anything and something in my heart was
[28:33] like as soon before she called I would I
[28:35] felt better I felt completely good I was
[28:37] like I believe I can go to church it was
[28:39] my first thought before she called and
[28:41] then when she did um I told my mom I
[28:43] said Mom she was she she was already
[28:45] prepared just to stay home with me to
[28:46] make sure I was okay and I went
[28:47] downstairs said Mom you know you want to
[28:49] go to church I said I want to go in the
[28:50] house of the Lord um and so when I went
[28:53] when I came um they're in service so of
[28:56] course I felt better but as I was
[28:57] driving driving then I had excruciating
[28:59] back pain and I literally couldn't even
[29:01] sit down and almost couldn't stand up
[29:03] through service and so I was praying to
[29:05] the Lord and I was claiming my healing
[29:06] because whatever brother Brent pra was
[29:07] preaching about it was talking about you
[29:09] know speaking you know over yourself and
[29:11] over your situation so I said Lord I
[29:13] claim my healing and nothing was
[29:16] changing I said I claim my healing
[29:17] nothing was changing and so after church
[29:19] um brother Stephen found out that you
[29:21] know I wasn't feeling well I went to the
[29:22] car immediately cuz I could barely stand
[29:24] up and I started singing my healing I
[29:26] just started singing song that came to
[29:28] my heart and I said I rebuke this I said
[29:29] I'm not going to be sick tomorrow I
[29:30] refuse I said I know if I claim that
[29:33] he'll do it then I went um then brother
[29:35] steam came over he's like do you want me
[29:36] to pray for you mind you I already
[29:38] claimed it so I didn't want I didn't
[29:39] feel like it was necessary to have
[29:41] anything else added to that because I
[29:43] feel like that would be doubting God and
[29:45] he said are you sure I said yes I'm sure
[29:46] I'm Healed he said are you sure I said
[29:47] I'm Healed and the next day I woke up I
[29:49] was
[29:56] healed
[30:00] God bless you
[30:03] Church um on Friday
[30:06] morning all of y'all know that I deliver
[30:08] milk I was in my um truck and I stopped
[30:12] to talk to my wife because our policy is
[30:16] you can't drive and talk at the same
[30:18] time even with the handfree
[30:21] stuff so as we talked you know we said
[30:24] all goodbyes and I said how much I love
[30:27] after got on the road I was headed
[30:29] towards
[30:31] Greenwood and about maybe 20 minutes the
[30:34] speed limit had changed from 55 to 45 so
[30:40] I dropped my
[30:42] speed and it it's like a four lane two
[30:46] going this way and two coming up on
[30:49] 25 and there was an
[30:51] intersection I noticed the 18wheeler
[30:54] stopped you know to have me p pass and
[30:58] the other one was coming in the opposite
[31:00] direction he was about to make a left
[31:04] turn I don't know how he didn't see me
[31:08] the man didn't stop just pulled in and
[31:12] started making his turn and I was coming
[31:16] down 45 50 miles an hour and I said I'm
[31:22] there was no other
[31:24] way I said we're going to crash we
[31:28] are I'm going hit his cargo whatever is
[31:30] in that cargo it'll I I just saw the end
[31:34] of my life I mean it's God's grace that
[31:37] I'm standing in front of y'all amen
[31:42] so everything slow down amen amen I was
[31:49] looking and thank God I was not in the
[31:52] far right lane I was in the left you
[31:55] know left lane that gave me uh ability
[31:59] to maneuver the truck and I had to to
[32:03] avoid him otherwise my whole cab would
[32:06] have been in this cargo and I God only
[32:08] knows what he was carrying could have
[32:10] been metal it could have been whatever
[32:13] so I maneuvered a
[32:15] truck and went into the other two
[32:19] lanes had there been a vehicle coming it
[32:22] would have been a head on collision so
[32:25] God had a said where there wasn't any
[32:27] other vehicle
[32:29] coming and
[32:31] so in the truck I didn't Panic it was
[32:35] such a a
[32:38] lovely uh presence that came in the
[32:43] truck and the Lord just slowed
[32:46] everything down I was able to see the
[32:49] that was the only way to get out of that

[1:01:03] hard on the young people right no
[1:01:06] cording somebody into the world Amen I
[1:01:09] have to insist it because I was sensing
[1:01:12] something so if you hear cording with
[1:01:16] somebody or talking to somebody who's
[1:01:18] not in the message you need to stop what
[1:01:21] you're
[1:01:22] doing amen amen regardless of how nice
[1:01:26] that person is if you're texting with a
[1:01:28] boy or something and you know he's not
[1:01:31] part of this church or part of the
[1:01:34] message somewhere in a message Church
[1:01:36] you got to stop it that's the reason why
[1:01:38] I was insisting because somebody
[1:01:40] probably is doing something so I'm not
[1:01:43] talking about you that are already here
[1:01:45] I'm talking about you being here going
[1:01:48] now outside then it's a problem that's
[1:01:51] what I was insisting amen so if you're
[1:01:53] texting with some somebody in the world
[1:01:55] who's smoking or maybe he's not smoking
[1:01:57] he's just a good boy look clean at work
[1:02:00] or something or in school stop
[1:02:03] it if you don't the holy spirit will
[1:02:06] catch you bad and I will rescue you
[1:02:09] before I rescue you I spank you
[1:02:13] first amen so I was talking about the
[1:02:17] people that are already here going into
[1:02:19] the world Amen everything clear so
[1:02:23] far
[1:02:24] blessed be the name of the Lord you saw
[1:02:27] something outside
[1:02:29] right how many are curious to know what
[1:02:32] it
[1:02:34] is somebody is not curious because they
[1:02:37] already know or somebody already Tau
[1:02:38] them what's going on Amen all right that

[1:39:49] the message that's why why you need to
[1:39:51] listen to the tape cuz some of you are
[1:39:55] lost everybody
[1:39:57] here the Bible says in Hebrews
[1:40:01] 12:14 follow peace with all men and
[1:40:05] Holiness Holiness without which no man
[1:40:10] shall see who if you want to see God you
[1:40:13] must be
[1:40:14] what everybody
[1:40:17] okay my subject this morning is the m of
[1:40:21] the table of the
[1:40:23] showbread normally I should call this
[1:40:27] the four phases of roof roof at the
[1:40:30] table of the showbread but I call this
[1:40:34] the mystery so you can have a reference
[1:40:36] quickly instead when you need it
[1:40:38] everybody here the mystery of the table
[1:40:42] of the showbread or the four servies of
[1:40:45] roof roof at the table of the showbread
[1:40:49] everybody okay when we looked in the
[1:40:52] Tabernacle we found out that the
[1:40:55] Tabernacle have different stages of our
[1:40:58] life you cannot be happy to just being
[1:41:01] in the camp of Israel but being in the
[1:41:04] camp of Israel doesn't bring you
[1:41:06] Redemption because Paul say not all
[1:41:09] Israel is Israel you must go through the
[1:41:13] process of redemption that was locked up
[1:41:16] or the Plan of Redemption that was
[1:41:18] locked up into the Tabernacle you got to
[1:41:21] find your way in when you get your way
[1:41:24] in you enter the Tabernacle you find an
[1:41:26] altar you remember last night and when
[1:41:29] you find the the the altar you take your
[1:41:31] decision over there you repented of your
[1:41:34] sin and then from there you are justify
[1:41:37] because you made peace with God after
[1:41:40] justification you move to the next step
[1:41:42] and then over there you get your water
[1:41:44] baptism amen and then from there you
[1:41:47] continue your journey you don't stop
[1:41:49] there and you enter the holy place this
[1:41:53] is where we have roof roof under the
[1:41:55] holy Place everybody okay so far now
[1:41:58] roof under the holy place means roof
[1:42:02] serving it means roof under
[1:42:05] sanctification it means roof under
[1:42:08] Wesley it means roof under Armenian ISM
[1:42:13] everybody okay so when you enter the
[1:42:16] Tabernacle inside the Tabernacle we have
[1:42:19] furniture there go
[1:42:21] ahead everybody here and as you
[1:42:24] approaching the inside of the Tabernacle
[1:42:28] you must interact with every Furniture
[1:42:31] of the Tabernacle that is correct
[1:42:33] everybody here if you meet the bre and
[1:42:35] altar you must deal with that bre and Al
[1:42:38] and dealing with that bre and Al for us
[1:42:41] today means you got meet Jesus Christ at
[1:42:44] the cross you got to repent of your sin
[1:42:47] you got to recognize yourself as a
[1:42:49] sinner even if if you were born in the
[1:42:52] message you are still a sinner even if
[1:42:55] you never went to the nightclub you are
[1:42:57] a sinner you just a clean
[1:43:00] sinner everybody even if you never drunk
[1:43:03] a whiskey in your life you still a
[1:43:06] sinner a sinner by birth everybody so
[1:43:11] you need to meet the Lord you need to
[1:43:13] interact with the braen Altar and once
[1:43:16] you finish your interaction with the
[1:43:18] braen altar you move to the next step
[1:43:21] and you interact with the lever and with
[1:43:23] the lever you got to be baptized in the
[1:43:25] name of Jesus Christ and what a baptism
[1:43:29] is
[1:43:30] essential the only time you're going to
[1:43:32] be spare is when you on the death bed
[1:43:35] and there is nothing else to do and you
[1:43:37] got to die and you give your life to
[1:43:39] Jesus Christ then you go but if you
[1:43:41] still alive you must be baptized in the
[1:43:44] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:43:48] remission of your sin then you shall
[1:43:50] receive the gift of the Holy Spirit
[1:43:53] everybody okay so far all right praise
[1:43:56] God now Ruth under serving we says that
[1:44:00] rof under serving means to make herself
[1:44:03] ready make herself ready for
[1:44:07] what brother bam continue because you
[1:44:09] already know this quote he say under
[1:44:12] serving he said Ruth have to serve in
[1:44:15] the field of boas because the field of
[1:44:18] boas was the only one that have the
[1:44:20] power of
[1:44:22] transformation he can take you from a
[1:44:24] widow wood until you get married to a
[1:44:27] new husband and be counted as a child of
[1:44:30] Israel and be dissolved in the nation of
[1:44:34] Israel until when they look at you they
[1:44:37] cannot find any Gentile Trace in
[1:44:42] you everybody okay she was serving
[1:44:46] barefooted painful and gleaning behind
[1:44:49] the Reapers when you serve you do not
[1:44:52] glean ahead of the
[1:44:55] he you must stay behind the reaper when
[1:45:00] the Ark of the Covenant was moving
[1:45:02] toward Jordan everybody have to stay
[1:45:05] behind the ark and the Ark was carried
[1:45:09] by the priest and the sheath was carried
[1:45:13] by the Reapers the Reapers move on and
[1:45:16] they drop the sheave and you solo behind
[1:45:19] the Reapers and you start picking up
[1:45:21] your food everybody care so far so what
[1:45:26] we saying here is we are under
[1:45:29] sanctification under sanctification I
[1:45:31] want to remind you brother brandham say
[1:45:34] that sanctification is the second stage
[1:45:36] of Grace which cleans the Mind everybody
[1:45:40] okay and set the heart the mind of the
[1:45:45] heart because the heart have mind as a
[1:45:47] man thinking in his heart everybody here
[1:45:51] you can think here or you can think here
[1:45:53] everybody here in order of what because
[1:45:57] with our Holiness you cannot see who a
[1:46:00] man can repent of sin you already know
[1:46:02] this and he's still thinking maybe he's
[1:46:05] an immoral man every immoral looking
[1:46:07] woman he found he's still there maybe
[1:46:10] he's a drunker every time he smelled the
[1:46:12] drink he's still there so the justify
[1:46:14] state in the Tabernacle here doesn't
[1:46:17] take away the desire of sin that's why
[1:46:21] you see people in the message keep
[1:46:22] backsliding back and forth back and
[1:46:24] forth in the world and come back and
[1:46:26] repent and re baptize and go back in the
[1:46:28] world because they don't understand
[1:46:29] they're in a wrong State they need to
[1:46:31] move quickly forward everybody care so
[1:46:34] far and brother brandham say but then
[1:46:36] when he gets Sanctified roof under
[1:46:39] sanctification that cleanses that desire
[1:46:42] out of him it takes the want of it away
[1:46:47] he can still be tempted but he takes the
[1:46:50] want of it way but is not right
[1:46:54] yet why because even though the want is
[1:46:58] taken away in your beautiful heart you
[1:47:01] still have a snake that's exactly right
[1:47:03] brother amen thank you Lord everybody
[1:47:06] okay so far blessed be the name of the
[1:47:09] Lord and brother Bram said that is what
[1:47:12] the matter we don't get seal so
[1:47:14] much because we are too lose about
[1:47:18] things everybody care the Holy Ghost
[1:47:21] will not come on you if your life is not
[1:47:25] Sanctified yet because God live in the
[1:47:30] holiest everybody if your life is still
[1:47:34] not clean yet there is no way you can
[1:47:37] see
[1:47:38] God there is no way you can enter the
[1:47:41] holiest you need to clean up that's why
[1:47:44] roof serving that serving is making roof
[1:47:47] ready preparing her to meet the
[1:47:51] King brother Bram say that's what the
[1:47:54] matter we don't get seal so much we are
[1:47:57] too lose about things when the inspector
[1:48:00] goes around to inspect your life to see
[1:48:03] if you are not just a little loser about
[1:48:07] things a little lose about your
[1:48:11] what little lose about that what you
[1:48:14] still have that snake active little lose
[1:48:17] about to that what that talk about what
[1:48:21] you need to cut away from every
[1:48:25] brother or every sister in this message
[1:48:30] that whenever you meet them or whenever
[1:48:34] they call you they always have story
[1:48:37] about other people you need to cut those
[1:48:40] people
[1:48:41] [Music]
[1:48:42] away if you are enjoying the story and
[1:48:46] being informed of everything that
[1:48:49] happened in every Church CH you have a
[1:48:51] snake in you that is still active and
[1:48:55] the snake want to feed on certain things
[1:48:59] everybody okay you got to cut those
[1:49:01] people because they are blocking you
[1:49:04] from moving
[1:49:07] forward I love them they're your friend
[1:49:11] your friend is blocking you from moving
[1:49:13] forward everybody here all you need to
[1:49:17] tell him listen if we want a fellowship
[1:49:19] from now on I don't want to hear about
[1:49:21] people's mother when you call me don't
[1:49:23] tell me about anybody else mother let's
[1:49:26] talk about the word or things that
[1:49:28] belong to me and
[1:49:32] you he shall never seal the car some
[1:49:36] dirty habit under justification some
[1:49:39] vile things under justification some
[1:49:42] vulgarity what constantly your mind is
[1:49:46] vulgar all it takes a little bit of
[1:49:49] sleeping you
[1:49:51] pornography he cannot seal you everybody
[1:49:55] okay he can't seal the car but when he's
[1:49:58] found everything in place the inspector
[1:50:02] then he does
[1:50:03] what there be anybody open that seal
[1:50:07] until the car reach what its destination
[1:50:10] to where it's what because once you seal
[1:50:13] with the Holy Spirit you are seal until
[1:50:16] the day of what nobody can touch you
[1:50:19] anymore
[1:50:21] the devil can tempt you he can make you
[1:50:23] suffer but he's not going to do anything
[1:50:26] and even the suffering of the devil he
[1:50:28] need permission from God if it's in your
[1:50:31] path of Life everybody okay so far
[1:50:35] everybody okay so far so when we clean
[1:50:37] up this table and we are dealing with
[1:50:40] the Holy place we find out that roof
[1:50:43] entering justification or the other cour
[1:50:46] roof have to interact with the furniture
[1:50:49] of the the other court she had to
[1:50:52] interact with the braen Altar and she
[1:50:54] has to interact with the lever now the
[1:50:57] holy place also have furniture
[1:51:01] right and those Furniture we already
[1:51:04] told you is the Candlestick the table of
[1:51:07] the showbread and the golden altar which
[1:51:09] we already spoke about so Ruth when she
[1:51:12] entered the holy place just as she
[1:51:16] interacted with the present altar just
[1:51:19] as you have to interact with the braen
[1:51:21] which is the cross in your life you have
[1:51:24] to interact with the lever which is your
[1:51:26] word of baptism when you enter in the
[1:51:28] Holy place you must interact with
[1:51:31] everything that is in the Holy
[1:51:34] place that's right did I lose somebody
[1:51:37] in the Holy place we spoke last Sunday
[1:51:40] on roof under the golden
[1:51:43] Candlestick now I want to remind you we
[1:51:46] were in rof Chapter 2 that the golden
[1:51:49] cand sck the Bible says in the Book of
[1:51:51] Revelation that the mystery of the Seven
[1:51:54] Stars which thou sest in my right hand
[1:51:58] and the Seven golden candles stick the
[1:52:00] Seven Star are the Angels of the seven
[1:52:04] Church ages and the Seven Candlestick
[1:52:07] which the S are the what in other words
[1:52:11] you cannot separate the candles stick
[1:52:14] from the
[1:52:15] Star amen everybody here the candlestick
[1:52:19] are the churches everybody here and the
[1:52:23] star are we have the star and we have
[1:52:27] the churches everybody here the
[1:52:29] Candlestick are the churches and the
[1:52:32] star are not just star but they are the
[1:52:36] star of the church ages in other words
[1:52:39] you cannot speak about the star without
[1:52:42] talking about the churches or you cannot
[1:52:44] talk about the churches without talking
[1:52:47] about the star everybody clear I hope
[1:52:49] the devil I mean God will keep your mind
[1:52:52] straight from moving around everybody so
[1:52:56] the star and the church ages both of
[1:52:59] them are connected if you need to go to
[1:53:00] the restroom that's fine but let's stay
[1:53:03] focus a little bit the star and the
[1:53:05] church ages both of them are connected
[1:53:08] you cannot speak about one without
[1:53:10] talking about the other everybody clear
[1:53:12] so far and then when we deal with it on
[1:53:16] Sunday we found out the Bible say uh
[1:53:20] brother Bram says that the next thing
[1:53:23] she has to do is
[1:53:25] serve that is what the church has to do
[1:53:28] the church after making your decision
[1:53:31] you have to serve serve God according to
[1:53:35] his what you don't serve God any kind of
[1:53:41] way God is a god of
[1:53:44] order the Devil is a man of disorder
[1:53:49] that's why hell there is no other in
[1:53:51] hell but if you want to serve the devil
[1:53:54] you can serve him any kind of way you
[1:53:56] can sleep in the world and don't come to
[1:53:58] church the devil is fine or you can come
[1:54:01] to church and be a hypocrite the devil
[1:54:04] is still fine but God you don't serve
[1:54:06] him any kind of way you got to serve God
[1:54:10] according to his plan according to his
[1:54:15] diagram you got to serve God according
[1:54:18] to his diagram according to his what
[1:54:21] blue blueprint you must serve who what
[1:54:25] is the diagram of God under the
[1:54:28] Candlestick the diagram of God under the
[1:54:31] Candlestick we found out in roof that we
[1:54:34] have
[1:54:36] bers everybody here boas was a type of
[1:54:40] Christ who was the owner of the field
[1:54:44] and because the seed in the field
[1:54:46] belongs to boas and he is the one that
[1:54:49] have the plan of everything everybody
[1:54:52] here and under bers we have the chief
[1:54:58] Reaper everybody here the chief Reaper
[1:55:02] is one is the
[1:55:05] messenger of the
[1:55:09] age you serve God according to the
[1:55:13] blueprint you must know what is the
[1:55:15] blueprint under the Candlestick in order
[1:55:18] to serve God properly everybody here

[2:01:35] [Music]
[2:01:36] Doctrine everybody here if you believe
[2:01:39] the message what do you
[2:01:41] do hang on to it matter what the price
[2:01:46] is stay right with it right on if you

[2:02:02] it in the process of time you got to get
[2:02:05] away from stuff you got to clean up
[2:02:09] yourself you got to clean up your friend
[2:02:12] even your message
[2:02:17] friend
[2:02:20] because he's in the message doesn't mean
[2:02:21] he's in the holiest he might be just in
[2:02:24] the
[2:02:26] camp so you are on the holy place he is
[2:02:30] in the camp who's pulling the other
[2:02:32] one because he was a friend for you for
[2:02:35] 5 years you didn't change
[2:02:39] him somebody's changing somebody either

[2:02:44] one becoming like them but if you check
[2:02:47] them they don't change meaning you the
[2:02:50] one that is
[2:02:53] dropping because you are
[2:02:56] compromising to keep them
[2:02:58] alive because if you stand with what the
[2:03:01] message say they won't like you anymore

[2:03:13] going to stay here I am
[2:03:17] going everybody okay so far blessed be
[2:03:21] the name of the Lord so after the chief
[2:03:24] Reaper the blueprint of God you got
[2:03:29] Reapers everybody here plural and these
[2:03:32] Reapers works with Maiden you remember a
[2:03:37] Reaper we found out in the scripture and
[2:03:40] under brother brandham that a Reaper was
[2:03:42] an angel and menen were women and women
[2:03:45] speak of
[2:03:47] what everybody
[2:03:50] Hallelujah brother Bram says this that
[2:03:53] you who remember the messenger are
[2:03:56] Pastor your you remember in the hotel
[2:04:01] your pastor when he stand here on the
[2:04:05] platform ministering the what the word
[2:04:08] of God the word of God he is God's what
[2:04:12] to the what he's a Reaper for that
[2:04:16] church Messenger to that
[2:04:19] not messenger of the age but messenger
[2:04:23] of the local
[2:04:25] church the messenger of the age is the
[2:04:29] chief
[2:04:30] Reaper but the pastor is Messenger to
[2:04:33] his own local
[2:04:35] flock everybody here therefore a pastor
[2:04:39] should
[2:04:40] what never leave the what that's why
[2:04:44] brother Bram say if he leaves the word
[2:04:47] what do you do you leave him because
[2:04:50] he's not under the program of God he's
[2:04:53] no longer under the diagram of God he's
[2:04:56] no longer under the blueprint of
[2:05:00] God everybody here because but stay with
[2:05:04] the word because he's
[2:05:06] feeding the shepherd place because the
[2:05:09] word pastor means what look it up and
[2:05:12] find out if that Ain right a pastor is a
[2:05:15] Shepherd the Holy Ghost has made him
[2:05:18] overse here over a certain flock to feed
[2:05:21] them what
[2:05:24] with the chief Reaper must be under
[2:05:29] boas the reaper must be under the chief
[2:05:33] Reaper and the Maiden must be under the
[2:05:37] reaper that are under the chief
[2:05:44] Reaper can I repeat again because boas
[2:05:48] thought
[2:05:49] stay with the
[2:05:52] maiden and follow the
[2:05:55] reaper you must stay under a
[2:05:59] church that have a pastor that is
[2:06:02] following the messenger of the age
[2:06:05] according to the program of
[2:06:09] God you must be following a maiden under
[2:06:14] a Reaper under a chief Reaper under bers
[2:06:18] Amen in other words The Church Must
[2:06:23] preach bers according to the revelation
[2:06:27] of the chief
[2:06:29] [Music]
[2:06:31] Reaper and The Reaper must preach Bowers
[2:06:35] according to the revelation of the chief
[2:06:37] Reaper and The madeen must reflect
[2:06:42] Bowers according to the revelation of
[2:06:45] the chief rep that have been given to to
[2:06:48] the reaper because that's why the church
[2:06:52] is a
[2:06:54] reflector you must
[2:06:57] reflect bers you must reflect the word
[2:07:02] that you have been
[2:07:05] preaching why because if a new roof
[2:07:09] comes in the camp God expect the new
[2:07:13] roof to follow
[2:07:16] you if a
[2:07:19] if a woman come from the world and she
[2:07:21] was wearing pants and everything when
[2:07:24] she gave her life to God and she get
[2:07:27] baptized God put that woman under you to
[2:07:31] follow the older sister that are already
[2:07:34] in the churches so that woman will begin
[2:07:37] to watch you oh they don't wear pant
[2:07:39] then she changes she put another another
[2:07:41] skirt okay they don't wear makeup and
[2:07:44] the sister remove it oh they don't wear
[2:07:46] earrings so you become the word to the
[2:07:50] roof that enter in the camp
[2:07:55] GL everybody here everybody here that's
[2:07:59] why we need to be very careful you who
[2:08:03] believe the message a long time because
[2:08:06] sometime you are the hindrance to the
[2:08:09] children that are coming
[2:08:12] up the children are coming up but they
[2:08:16] have bad example
[2:08:19] bad example from their
[2:08:24] parent your child is 11 years old can
[2:08:29] your child drive a
[2:08:30] car how is your child going to
[2:08:36] church if you don't come to church what

[2:08:43] to drive a car because they don't own a
[2:08:46] car because daddy stay home home Daddy
[2:08:49] is a hindrance to that
[2:08:51] child Mama become a hindrance for that
[2:08:55] child when they younger children want to
[2:08:57] be on time on Church it is the parent
[2:09:01] causing the
[2:09:04] [Music]
[2:09:06] delay until the young children come to
[2:09:09] church and the parent are still
[2:09:11] struggling to make it to
[2:09:16] church you forgot you are the menen you
[2:09:20] are the reflector that the new younger
[2:09:23] are following but you mama are not an
[2:09:26] example that is not an example you come

[2:10:19] everybody you will hear them telling you
[2:10:22] Mama AR supposed to do this he said shut
[2:10:25] up you are trying to use Authority now
[2:10:27] to shut the word down because the child
[2:10:30] is telling you the truth you must be
[2:10:33] humble enough to recognize when you are
[2:10:36] wrong even if you a
[2:10:39] parent the children are ready Daddy's
[2:10:43] the one in the bathroom the children are
[2:10:45] ready momm is the one in the bathroom

[2:11:12] Holy Ghost will not make you behave like
[2:11:14] that because there are certain young
[2:11:16] people that are coming up they are
[2:11:18] looking at the order in the message they
[2:11:21] expecting you to be the guide they
[2:11:23] expecting you to give us an example how
[2:11:26] to talk how to behave how to dress how
[2:11:30] to

[2:11:33] react stay by the
[2:11:36] medens that are under the
[2:11:38] reaper Hallelujah brother Bram says this

[2:11:54] will not spare one thing for one person

[2:12:00] member of the church the maiden he's
[2:12:04] called to be a member of this certain
[2:12:06] group then he will not do what so not
[2:12:09] only does the minister do not have to
[2:12:12] compromise you also don't have to

[2:15:35] we spoke again that they were beat
[2:15:39] work what has beat work speaks right
[2:15:42] around I'm say but the only but not only
[2:15:45] is the Candlestick of gold it is of
[2:15:48] beaten gold hand grafted beat gold
[2:15:51] according to her blueprint which were
[2:15:54] spirit-given outside of the Lord and
[2:15:57] Master Jesus Christ was ever a people so
[2:16:00] beaten and purged as The Brood of Jesus
[2:16:04] Christ when you are living under your
[2:16:07] Candlestick remember you are working
[2:16:10] barefooted there is a suffering that
[2:16:13] goes with it there is a pain with
[2:16:16] sanctification sanc ation is not a easy
[2:16:19] process they got to put it in the hot
[2:16:22] water and
[2:16:24] boil everybody care surely she is
[2:16:28] filling up the suffering that Christ has
[2:16:31] what there is a measure of suffering her
[2:16:35] goods are despoiled her life is in
[2:16:38] Jeopardy she is accounted as a sheep for
[2:16:41] Slaughter she kill all day long she
[2:16:44] suffer much but it in uh in it all or
[2:16:48] retaliate not because God is working on
[2:16:51] your character neither that shos areed
[2:16:53] to do what worthy of the Gospel is this
[2:16:57] lovely bread of Christ and the gold is
[2:17:01] malleable whereas bras will break with
[2:17:04] the water this gold of God will bear her
[2:17:08] suffering for the Lord Not Bow not
[2:17:12] compromise not broken you're not going
[2:17:14] to quit not destroy but for as a thing
[2:17:18] of what and joy Forever by there and the
[2:17:23] testing of what it is on your path of
[2:17:27] way of
[2:17:29] life what brother digs was ministering
[2:17:32] everybody here according to Paul God has
[2:17:36] left his church a measure of what
[2:17:39] suffering but their faith in God while
[2:17:42] suffering for him will come to a place
[2:17:44] of what the Bible say my brethen count
[2:17:47] it all joy when you fall in diverse
[2:17:50] Temptation knowing this that the trying
[2:17:52] of your remember Peter are pay for your
[2:17:55] faith
[2:17:57] amen because you were under justify and
[2:18:00] sanctification now God is working on
[2:18:02] that Faith before he seals it everybody
[2:18:07] the trying of your faith work what but
[2:18:10] let patience have her perfect work that
[2:18:13] he may be perfect and entire wanting
[2:18:16] what it's a time of preparation
[2:18:21] Roman unless we suffer with him we
[2:18:24] cannot what remember when you under
[2:18:28] sanctification this is the Tabernacle
[2:18:30] you already finished justification with
[2:18:32] the Brazen Altar and a lever now we are
[2:18:35] here God is trying to bring you into the
[2:18:38] holiest because over there this is where
[2:18:41] the king is that's right God is trying
[2:18:43] to get you in a place where you will
[2:18:45] begin to rain yes sir but to get you to
[2:18:48] that place because the Bible says when
[2:18:51] the Holy Ghost come on you he will give
[2:18:54] you power do you remember that do you
[2:18:57] know that it's on act 1 ver8 the Bible
[2:19:01] say you shall receive power after the
[2:19:04] Holy Ghost come on you and God cannot
[2:19:07] give you power if your character is not
[2:19:12] correct how many have the Holy Ghost
[2:19:15] your character is how you claim to have
[2:19:18] the Holy
[2:19:19] Ghost unless we suffer with him we
[2:19:22] cannot what you have to suffer to rain
[2:19:26] the reason for this is that character
[2:19:30] simply is never made without water
[2:19:33] that's why rof have to serve Why didn't
[2:19:36] boas stop the serving of rof and say rof
[2:19:39] I already heard about you you know what
[2:19:41] you a virtuous woman no more work if you
[2:19:44] notice Bo has never done that he say I
[2:19:47] already heard about you I'm giving you
[2:19:49] instruction stay in this field don't go
[2:19:52] anywhere but continue to
[2:19:54] work he didn't take the work off of roof
[2:19:58] why because that work will create
[2:20:03] character everybody okay so far brother
[2:20:06] theam say a man without character
[2:20:10] character is a victory it's not a gift a
[2:20:14] man without character
[2:20:16] cannot because power apart from
[2:20:19] character is what but Power with
[2:20:22] character is fit to rule so since he
[2:20:25] want us to share even his what the holy
[2:20:29] of holiest on the same basis that he
[2:20:32] overcome and sit down in his father's
[2:20:34] Throne then we have to overcome to sit
[2:20:38] with
[2:20:39] him you got to work until bers look and
[2:20:44] say that's what I want now push him here
[2:20:48] then I'm going to seal it everybody here
[2:20:51] and if you notice when the roof came the
[2:20:54] Bible say Naomi returned and roof the
[2:20:57] Moab as her daughter-in-law with her
[2:20:59] which returned out of the country of
[2:21:01] Moab they came to Bethlehem
[2:21:04] when in the beginning of the barley
[2:21:07] Harvest they just start working and you
[2:21:11] think boas would look and say this woman
[2:21:13] travels so long she she's already a good
[2:21:16] woman let her go Bo I say uh-uh you came
[2:21:20] right on time now you're going to jump
[2:21:22] into the work you're going to start
[2:21:24] working suffering how can you make a
[2:21:26] woman that you want to marry
[2:21:30] suffer you want to marry her normally we
[2:21:34] understand if you marry her you make
[2:21:35] everything good flower in the morning
[2:21:37] flower in the mailbox flower everywhere
[2:21:39] flower everywhere flower everywhere not
[2:21:42] Bas the flower are there but they are in
[2:21:45] the
[2:21:46] holiest
[2:21:48] I want to get your character first
[2:21:50] because if I give you what I have with
[2:21:52] our character you're not going to serve
[2:21:57] me everybody okay oh God give me a
[2:22:00] million dollars you don't come to church
[2:22:03] you don't give your tth and you want a
[2:22:06] million dollar no he's not going to give
[2:22:09] it to you and the one that give more it
[2:22:11] looks like God is keep giving him more
[2:22:14] there is a law in the scripture on that
[2:22:18] there is a law in the scripture let's
[2:22:20] leave Prosperity let's get into this and
[2:22:24] rof the Mo B say he said unto me also th

[2:34:08] brother Bram is calling the showbread
[2:34:13] manner who's saying the truth brother br
[2:34:16] Bible but the message we know it's
[2:34:20] always what is wrong here that's why you
[2:34:24] need to study the message you ready
[2:34:27] what's going on brother Steven in Exodus
[2:34:30] chapter 16 follow me
[2:34:33] carefully the Bible says when the
[2:34:36] children of Israel saw it they say one
[2:34:40] to another it is what when they came up
[2:34:43] in the morning they look they say it's
[2:34:46] Mana they gave the name Mana everybody
[2:34:49] here for they wish not what he was they
[2:34:53] didn't know what it was God told them
[2:34:54] I'm going to give you food bread they
[2:34:56] came up they say what is this food Mana
[2:35:00] everybody here and Moses say unto them
[2:35:03] this is the what bread so Mana is a
[2:35:10] bread did that miss
[2:35:12] somebody
[2:35:14] Mana is also Al a
[2:35:17] bread and the table of the shoe Bread
[2:35:20] have
[2:35:23] what this is the bread which the Lord
[2:35:27] has given you to do whatat in Exodus
[2:35:31] 16:31 the Bible says the house of Israel
[2:35:34] called the name thereof mana and it was
[2:35:37] like corander seed white and tasted the
[2:35:41] taste of it was like what wafer made
[2:35:45] with what
[2:35:48] what the bread of the Holy place the
[2:35:52] holiest was mana and Mana tasted like
[2:35:58] honey not the
[2:36:01] showbread the showbread didn't have
[2:36:03] honey I'm going to go slowly the honey
[2:36:07] is on the bread that is in the
[2:36:09] holiest follow me carefully follow me
[2:36:13] carefully everybody okay number
[2:36:16] 117 the Mana was a coriander seed right
[2:36:20] here and the color thereof was the color
[2:36:23] of
[2:36:24] delium and the people went about and
[2:36:27] gather it and did what ground it in the
[2:36:31] mill and did
[2:36:33] what in the mortar and did what bake it
[2:36:37] with pan and did what off it and it
[2:36:40] taste and the taste of it was as the
[2:36:42] taste of what oil and honey
[2:36:46] both of them in the Mana and the Mana
[2:36:49] have to be worked on and baked into a
[2:36:54] cake the Mana have to be baked into a
[2:36:57] cake that tasted like
[2:37:00] honey you know what honey means and then
[2:37:04] oil everybody okay everybody okay that
[2:37:07] is the Mana everybody here in other word
[2:37:11] in the
[2:37:13] Tabernacle we have two bread
[2:37:18] did you get me in the Tabernacle we have
[2:37:22] two bread and both bread are carried
[2:37:26] upon certain things the first bread is
[2:37:30] the sh
[2:37:31] bread everybody here and the second
[2:37:34] bread is the
[2:37:37] Mana when you carry the ark when you
[2:37:40] move the Mana is moving when you go back
[2:37:43] the Mana is going back when you move
[2:37:45] forward the man is moving forward when
[2:37:47] you carry the table you move the bread
[2:37:49] are moving you go back the bread are
[2:37:51] moving you go up the bread are move
[2:37:53] because they always
[2:37:55] connected everybody okay why is brother
[2:37:59] Bram calling that the same brother Bram
[2:38:01] give me some
[2:38:02] explanation hidden manner which is in
[2:38:05] the holiest let's give the
[2:38:07] interpretation the best we can what do
[2:38:09] hidden Mana tap what does he do
[2:38:14] what not to what he
[2:38:16] is what
[2:38:19] he hidden Mana was the Mana that was
[2:38:23] kept or a
[2:38:24] what in
[2:38:29] what everybody okay but the Bram was
[2:38:33] calling the Mana show bread in type
[2:38:38] because Mana was also
[2:38:43] bread go back and listen to the uning of
[2:38:46] God now your eyes will be open Hidden
[2:38:49] manner show bread in the Bible that was
[2:38:52] only for the what they had the bread for
[2:38:55] the congregation but there was a special
[2:38:57] bread for the common bread and hollow
[2:39:01] bread this is a special bread a special
[2:39:05] bread hidden what what is it who is our
[2:39:09] Mana
[2:39:11] who the six uh John 6 Jesus say the
[2:39:16] bread I am the bread of life that came
[2:39:18] out of what the
[2:39:21] what tartarian churches brother I'm say
[2:39:25] now we got to find also the hidden
[2:39:27] manner the hidden Mana is
[2:39:30] what tap to what the hidden Mana is not
[2:39:34] the showbread but it is T as the
[2:39:38] showbread because the shortbread and the
[2:39:42] Mana both of them are bread that's why I
[2:39:45] brought the Bram sometime will call the
[2:39:47] Mana the showbread in
[2:39:51] type you okay
[2:39:55] now everybody okay the show bread was
[2:39:58] for the priest alone the show bread was
[2:40:01] just for The Who so now we understand
[2:40:04] that in the Tabernacle you have bread in
[2:40:07] the table of the showbread and you also
[2:40:09] have bread in the what in the ark right
[2:40:13] here the priest who was entering could
[2:40:15] eat but in the Holy Place only the high
[2:40:19] priest can go and eat
[2:40:23] the everybody okay now praise God

[2:41:07] other words to understand the show bread
[2:41:10] you need to see the Ark of the Covenant

[2:43:12] 1.5 and the breath of the table is one
[2:43:16] 1.5 - 1 is what so the difference
[2:43:21] between the Ark of the Covenant and the
[2:43:24] table of the showbread is only a
[2:43:34] half this is
[2:43:37] Christ this is
[2:43:40] Christ the difference between this
[2:43:43] Christ and this Christ
[2:43:46] is 1.5 which is half everybody okay what
[2:43:50] does he mean brother Bram say it's been
[2:43:55] through the F test friend don't believe
[2:44:00] but thank God we are still on the
[2:44:02] Victorious side
[2:44:04] today because we are in Who and the what
[2:44:10] has never yet been
[2:44:14] what
[2:44:17] everybody okay everybody okay so when

[2:44:45] praise
[2:44:47] God everybody K the measurement of the
[2:44:51] table and the AR the difference is half
[2:44:55] everybody so when you eating on the

[3:05:38] what we talking about the blood of Jesus
[3:05:41] Christ everybody what does he mean
[3:05:44] brother Bram say the fourth mystery of
[3:05:46] the New
[3:05:48] Testament is the mystery of the New
[3:05:51] Testament Church as one body composed of
[3:05:56] what you remember the body of Samaritan
[3:05:59] and we found one row was how many
[3:06:02] bread and another row was how many bread
[3:06:06] and they were under the
[3:06:08] Candlestick speaking of the Church of
[3:06:11] Jesus Christ composed of two kind of men
[3:06:15] the Jews and the Gentile that are eating
[3:06:18] the bread of God in the blood of Jesus
[3:06:23] Christ did I lose you did I use you
[3:06:27] under the blood of Jesus Christ under
[3:06:29] the seven Church ages it's not only
[3:06:32] Gentile we have Jews and Gentile you got
[3:06:35] six the number of men and six the number
[3:06:38] of men both of them are eating the same
[3:06:41] bread under the same candles s and they
[3:06:43] are part of the same
[3:06:46] Brad The Mystery of the table of the
[3:06:49] showbread Paul say the genter should be
[3:06:52] fellow her of the same and partaker of
[3:06:55] his promise in Christ by the what in
[3:06:58] Ephesian 2 the Bible says at that time
[3:07:02] we Gentile we were without what we were
[3:07:05] alien from the common wealth of what we
[3:07:08] were stranger from the Covenant of the
[3:07:10] water we have having what and without
[3:07:14] what but now in Christ Jesus ye who
[3:07:18] sometime were
[3:07:20] Gentile off we are made what n by the
[3:07:24] blood of who for he is our and who made
[3:07:29] both what both the Jew and the Gentile
[3:07:32] he put them on the same table one and
[3:07:36] had broken down the water the m a wall
[3:07:39] of partition now rof a gent can can
[3:07:43] enter the field of boas and she can

[3:10:21] be removed they have to put fresh bread

[3:10:30] seventh Sabbath is the seven Church
[3:10:33] ages let me call move forward you can
[3:10:36] read this at home Hallelujah the Bible
[3:10:39] says this that Jesus said I am the
[3:10:42] living bread
[3:10:43] which came down from what if a man eat
[3:10:46] this bread he shall live what forever
[3:10:51] and the bread that I will give you is my
[3:10:53] flesh which I give for the life of the

[3:11:12] seven days what does that typify they
[3:11:15] complete what church seven Church ages
[3:11:19] why why had they have to eat it seven
[3:11:23] days before what before going out and
[3:11:25] the whole church age from the beginning
[3:11:28] to the end has to live only by the word
[3:11:31] of God for
[3:11:32] that the Candlestick shining on the
[3:11:35] table every seven new bread new message
[3:11:39] Luther new message Wesley new message
[3:11:42] columus new message they changing the
[3:11:44] bread every Sabbath day but it's going
[3:11:47] to be unle bread they cannot be seen in
[3:11:50] that leav everybody care so far and then
[3:11:52] we found that the 11 those bread must
[3:11:55] have frankincense on them brother Bram
[3:11:59] say frankincense is the offering of a
[3:12:02] service to
[3:12:03] who that's why rof have to work
[3:12:07] everybody here if you want to put this
[3:12:09] scripture down Leviticus 2:2 and
[3:12:11] Leviticus 6
[3:12:13] 6-5 we found out that is the order of
[3:12:16] the priesthood to make an offering to
[3:12:18] Jehovah when he made the offering he had
[3:12:21] to be made and mixed with what Frankin
[3:12:24] says for a sin offering they took
[3:12:27] different things and mixed it for the
[3:12:29] meal offering Frankin sin was added
[3:12:31] because he was acceptable to Jehovah if
[3:12:34] he was what Anointed with frankeny so
[3:12:38] when the priest was putting frankeny the
[3:12:41] priest was anointed anointing the bread
[3:12:44] with service everybody okay Frank which
[3:12:48] mean the service to who Jehovah and they
[3:12:51] brought him frankincense was a tap that
[3:12:54] he was a service to who Jesus is
[3:12:59] Jehovah's
[3:13:04] servant
[3:13:05] everybody brother Bram says this he said
[3:13:09] in s Matthew 12 15-2 one we found out
[3:13:13] that he was Jehovah's servant because
[3:13:16] the Bible say behold my servant which
[3:13:18] was Jesus in whom I'm well what and I
[3:13:22] put my strength upon him so his life was
[3:13:25] anointed with what to Jehovah's as a
[3:13:29] what so the bread you are receiving from
[3:13:32] the messenger is the food that God gave
[3:13:35] you so that the food can put you in
[3:13:38] service for God that's why woff was
[3:13:41] under
[3:13:44] service everybody here let me go to the
[3:13:47] airport oh my God let me go to the
[3:13:50] airport if you notice here we have
[3:13:55] what a crown here how many Crown do we
[3:13:58] have I'm heading to the airport your
[3:14:01] prayer will be answered my
[3:14:03] friend everybody here how many Crown do
[3:14:07] we have in the ark one how many Crown do
[3:14:10] we have in the in the table two in the
[3:14:13] table we got two crowns we got also two
[3:14:17] crown and those two Crown we also have
[3:14:20] two rows and if you remember the crown
[3:14:23] was like a border right and the crown
[3:14:26] was separated by a hand breath do you
[3:14:30] remember that what does hand breath
[3:14:33] means everybody
[3:14:36] here Psalm 39 David say Lord make me
[3:14:41] know my end
[3:14:43] and the
[3:14:45] what David want to know the measure of
[3:14:48] his day on Earth what it is that I may
[3:14:52] know how FR I
[3:14:54] am behold th has made my day as a
[3:15:02] what so the hand
[3:15:04] breath is the measure of your life on
[3:15:09] Earth everybody okay everybody okay and
[3:15:13] the two Crown have to be separated by a
[3:15:17] hand breath everybody in other word
[3:15:21] David is saying that my life in Earth is
[3:15:24] short that's why job says that man that
[3:15:29] is born of a woman is of what which
[3:15:32] represented what the hand breath but
[3:15:36] thank God why thanking God everybody
[3:15:40] here because Jesus say I I am the bread
[3:15:44] of life that came from what that a man
[3:15:48] eateth and do what you will live forever
[3:15:51] because David by the hand breath it is
[3:15:54] showing the shortness of a human life
[3:15:58] because life is no more eternal men sin
[3:16:01] and because of sin we begin to die so we
[3:16:04] needed a bread that when we eat that
[3:16:08] bread will give us eternal life and it
[3:16:11] will s the hand breath of man and we
[3:16:15] won't die
[3:16:19] anymore I know now it's sping on someone
[3:16:22] everybody okay the crown on the Ark of
[3:16:27] the Covenant how many Crown you do
[3:16:29] have who do we Crown
[3:16:32] King so it seems like we got two kings
[3:16:35] there and here we got one king
[3:16:38] right right yes sir why brother Bram
[3:16:42] brother Bram say they put a crown on it
[3:16:45] on the ark why he was the what what did
[3:16:49] that gold crown laying on top of that
[3:16:51] box means it means that here with that
[3:16:55] gold laying over it Humanity was covered
[3:16:58] with God blood sprinkling on top of it
[3:17:00] and a crown was laying there so the
[3:17:02] crown on the ark brother Bram say
[3:17:05] because he was a King Jesus was 100% man
[3:17:08] and he was a 100% God he was Humanity
[3:17:12] cover with deity and they put a crown of
[3:17:15] him everybody clear brother Ram said the
[3:17:17] Gold Crown does that represent
[3:17:20] Christ yes when Christ was here on Earth
[3:17:24] he was crowned with the crown of thorn
[3:17:27] to shed the blood that's right but every
[3:17:30] believer that come through the shed
[3:17:32] blood pull forth the crown of thorn and
[3:17:36] crown him with what Glory of praises and
[3:17:39] what every believer that Step In The
[3:17:43] Presence the holiest of holiest accept
[3:17:47] that blood from his breast BR with tone
[3:17:51] and crown him glory and praise and what
[3:17:54] he crown him as what so the crown in the
[3:17:59] Ark of the Covenant is a crown of Jesus
[3:18:03] as king of
[3:18:06] King it's only one Crown everybody here
[3:18:11] everybody here
