========================================

[music] I have something that I want to talk about briefly. I don't know how long it's going to take me, but as a shepherd, I have to talk about it from the pulpit. And uh if he rob you the wrong way, I do not have any choice. But as a shepherd, I'm responsible to the church that the Lord put me. Every church is sovereign. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Uh so I need to talk to my church visible and my church invisible. Are we together? &gt;&gt; So give me one one uh minute. Let me work with this as the devil has been attacking since this morning. left and right, but by God's grace, all is well. &gt;&gt; Let me go to the slide. It's 963. Let's see if we can get there. Brother Aaron, don't scream. It's slide 963. Okay, let's see. All right, buddy. you know, go ahead and connect this. I need these quotes so everybody can read them correctly. I want to make sure we clear on that one. Give us some few second and then we go from there. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's going to work. &gt;&gt; I got you in season or out of season. So whether there is trouble or not, we will shoot it. And I know what is coming up. &gt;&gt; That's why the devil has been doing that. He tried this morning. They came they say the water was frozen and by God's grace the water is working. &gt;&gt; So now we move from the water and then my monitor was not working. Then they fix it. Then the monitor is working. Then he jump from the monitor to the computer. So somebody is trying to trouble but everything will be okay. So let's see if it's uh that's 9 30. Let's see what comes up. Okay. The screen is a little bit smaller than I wanted, but let's work with this. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. In the hotel, we cover Christmas. &gt;&gt; Can you put your seat belt? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. In a hotel, we cover Christmas. &gt;&gt; And for some reason, by God's grace, the Lord lead us during the time of Christmas. I don't prepare this sermon like this is going to be preached on Christmas or whatever because God is maneuvering things differently. &gt;&gt; So the Lord made it happen that closer to Christmas, we ended up dealing with the fathered calf &gt;&gt; and Bale and Jezebel and took Christmas from the root of it. &gt;&gt; If you still have a problem with that, that's between you and the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And then we pull it from there. Then the following Sunday I gave some chemotherapy. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But as believers in this church are evangelist, some are sharing the messages and things and they are going left and right. And when the message are going back and forth, it's raising up also &gt;&gt; uh spirit and it's uh disturbing people &gt;&gt; because uh we trying to get the lollipop out of their mouth. [cheering] &gt;&gt; The people don't want to be free from tradition. &gt;&gt; We only quot the other code. In this church, we take everything &gt;&gt; and we don't believe THERE IS A CONTRADICTION SIR &gt;&gt; IN THE MESSAGE of brother Brham. &gt;&gt; Not at all. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So, brother Brham is the one who say celebrating Christmas &gt;&gt; it's a worship of devil. &gt;&gt; I DIDN'T SAY THAT. &gt;&gt; I GAVE YOU THE COAT. &gt;&gt; And matter OF FACT, EVERY COAT I give it to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; BUT PEOPLE STILL HAVE A HARD TIME CHEWING THAT ONE. &gt;&gt; So somebody send me a response &gt;&gt; from the people. They say, "Well, &gt;&gt; they send me an article. Please follow me carefully. &gt;&gt; You online, repeat my word &gt;&gt; and don't cut me short. &gt;&gt; Start where I started. &gt;&gt; I don't have a choice. I cannot back up. I have to say what I want to say. &gt;&gt; Do you follow me? I don't have any choice. I'm under commission. [screaming] I got to do the work that God put me TO DO. &gt;&gt; Do you follow me? &gt;&gt; So, they send the person an article written by brother Brham's children &gt;&gt; describing how they were doing uh celebrating Christmas. And they also sent me a photo showing brother Billy Paul &gt;&gt; giving gift &gt;&gt; of Christmas. &gt;&gt; I'm saying this name [clears throat] because this thing these things are not secret. &gt;&gt; They all over the internet. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So they say let's see what brother Steven will say about it. &gt;&gt; Now spoken word &gt;&gt; visible and invisible. Follow me carefully. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Number one, BROTHER BRANDHAM FAMILY HAD TO grow &gt;&gt; with the message. &gt;&gt; I'm going to help you up for the rest of your life. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM OWN CHILDREN HAD to grow with the message. And not only growing but brother brand ammon children had to have the REVELATION &gt;&gt; of the message. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; HIS OWN FAMILY HAD TO grow &gt;&gt; and his own family had to have a revelation. I know somehow allergic &gt;&gt; when I begin to touch these things. &gt;&gt; Okay. But I don't have any choice. &gt;&gt; Are we together? I know where I'm heading. SO, BROTHER BRANDHAM FAMILY HAVE TO GROW. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, BROTHER STEVEN? I mean, turn your timer off. I have not started my message. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM IS PREACHING in 1933. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm picking UP AN EXAMPLE. &gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU EXPECT THE BROTHER BRANDHAM FAMILY to dress &gt;&gt; 1933 &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO 1933? &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; DID BROTHER BRHAM PREACH IN 1960? &gt;&gt; DID HE PREACH IN 1959? &gt;&gt; DID HE PREACH THE SEVEN SEAL? &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU TAKE A PICTURE OF BROTHER BRANDHAM family and YOU WANT TO UH SUPPORT YOUR BAD DRESSING, &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THAT HERE. &gt;&gt; YES [cheering] SIR. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU HEAR PEOPLE WEAR MAS OH. OH. WHAT? SISTER MIDA'S DRESS OR SKIRT WAS MAYBE HERE AT WHICH YEAR? &gt;&gt; WHICH YEAR? &gt;&gt; COME ON, LORD. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF BROTHER BRHAM SPOKE ABOUT THE IF BROTHER BRANDHAM spoke about the skirt in 1957, HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME &gt;&gt; IN 1933 TO DRESS ACCORDING TO 1957? &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; So you need to BE PATIENT &gt;&gt; WITH BROTHER BRAHAM FAMILY &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GROW &gt;&gt; AS THE MESSAGE WAS COMING. &gt;&gt; WE ARE DIFFERENT. WE GET EVERYTHING IN THE BOOK [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; OVER THERE. THEY HAVE TO GO STEP BY STEP. SO YOU NEED TO BE PATIENT WITH THE FAMILY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham preached the seals &gt;&gt; and HE CONDEMNED SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU go and condemn brother Billy Paul in 1952 &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE SEALS WERE NOT BROKEN YET. &gt;&gt; THEY HAVE TO DO THE BEST THAT they can. IN OTHER WORD, NO EXCUSE &gt;&gt; SHOULD BE TAKEN UPON THE BRHAM FAMILY &gt;&gt; TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS CONTRARY TO THE TEACHING OF THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; I don't know if we clear. &gt;&gt; I KNOW I'M TOUCHING SORE SPOTS, &gt;&gt; but I don't have any choices. &gt;&gt; Are we together? And I'm saying this with a LOT OF CONSIDERATION and respect. &gt;&gt; We clear. We love brother Brandham. We love his family but we must say the truth &gt;&gt; and the TRUTH MUST SET YOU FREE. ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; SO BROTHER BRANDHAM FAMILY HAVE TO GROW. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRANDHAM FAMILY HAVE TO HAVE THE PERSONAL REVELATION OF THE MESSAGE THAT THEIR FATHER WAS PREACHING. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY BROTHER BRHAM IN 1963 HE SAY INTELLECTUALLY THEY are receiving the message. AND BROTHER BRHAM SAID, "NOW YOU BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND." &gt;&gt; So the people were there following brother Brandham, but they didn't catch what brother Brandham was saying. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Why are you saying this? Because somebody gave an article. Sister Rebecca said this and brother Billy Paul was giving her cards. &gt;&gt; That was the first approach. &gt;&gt; We clear on that one. &gt;&gt; The second approach is this. This is the hard one. &gt;&gt; In the book of Act, Paul preached his message. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; WHEN PAUL FINISHED HIS MESSAGE, &gt;&gt; Paul knew that he had to die &gt;&gt; and he needed to go &gt;&gt; and they're going to kill him. So now Paul called the elders &gt;&gt; in Ephesus &gt;&gt; AND PAUL BEGIN TO TALK TO THEM &gt;&gt; knowing that he's going to be gone. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AND IN THE BOOK OF ACT PAUL SAYS this in verse 27. AND I HAVE NOT sh &gt;&gt; to DECLARE UNTO YOU SOME OF THE COUNSEL OF GOD. How many concert? &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, PAUL GAVE EVERYTHING &gt;&gt; THAT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO GIVE. &gt;&gt; THE ENTIRE MESSAGE WAS DELIVERED. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY GOD WILL NEVER TAKE YOU OUT &gt;&gt; IF HE HAS NOT FINISHED YOUR JOB. &gt;&gt; IF PAUL IS TAKEN OUT, IT MEANS HIS JOB IS FINISHED. AND THE SAME APPLY TO BROTHER &gt;&gt; Brham &gt;&gt; for returning ministry people. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRANDHAM AND THE BIBLE SAY TAKE HEED. This is Paul saying therefore unto yourself &gt;&gt; AND TO ALL THE FLOCK &gt;&gt; of the which the Holy Spirit has made you OVERSEER &gt;&gt; TO DO WHAT? feed the church of God &gt;&gt; WHICH HE HAS PURCHASED WITH HIS OWN BLOOD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Follow me carefully. &gt;&gt; For I know &gt;&gt; this. What do YOU KNOW, PAUL? &gt;&gt; THAT AFTER MY DEPARTING &gt;&gt; SHALL GRIEVOUS wolf &gt;&gt; enter in among you. &gt;&gt; SO PAUL ALREADY SEEN THEM LOOKING AROUND THE CHURCHES. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE WAITING FOR PAUL TO GO. THEN THEY MAKE THE ENTRANCE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND PAUL SAY, "LISTEN, I ALREADY GAVE YOU THE FULL PACKAGE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT EVERYTHING." &gt;&gt; AMEN. I KNOW SOME PEOPLE WILL COME IN. &gt;&gt; FOLLOW. &gt;&gt; He says, "After my departing shall grieve wolf enter in which brother Brandham say was a nicolatan spirit, &gt;&gt; NOT SPARING THE FLOCK." That's the first aspect. according to the first aspect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is people from outside. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Getting into &gt;&gt; the rank. &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; Now look at verse two. &gt;&gt; Look at the B which is the the WORST ONE. &gt;&gt; ALSO OF YOUR OWN SELF, &gt;&gt; THOSE THAT YOU CALL BROTHER THOSE THAT PREACH THE MESSAGE, &gt;&gt; THOSE THAT BELIEVE THE MESSAGE, &gt;&gt; THEY WILL GO WITH YOU FOR A WHILE &gt;&gt; AND AFTER A WHILE SOMETHING WILL FLIP THEM. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; SHAN ARISE SPEAKING WHAT? &gt;&gt; Perverse things. &gt;&gt; So is he a problem if somebody woke up and say the cloud was not true? &gt;&gt; Then the same person preach about the cloud &gt;&gt; and they come back they say the cloud is not true. What is the problem? &gt;&gt; It is no more. &gt;&gt; IT IS JUST IDENTIFYING THAT YOU ARE NOW PART OF us &gt;&gt; people &gt;&gt; from the inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Rising up. &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE YOU GOING? SPEAKING PERVERSE THINGS &gt;&gt; TO DRAW away disciple after them. making a move so the people will follow them. &gt;&gt; I'm reading the Bible. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; THEREFORE, WATCH. THIS IS PAUL saying &gt;&gt; and remember THAT BY THE SPACE OF HOW MANY YEARS? &gt;&gt; THREE YEARS. &gt;&gt; This apostle worked for THREE YEARS. I SEIZED NOT TO DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; WARN &gt;&gt; EVERYONE. HOW MANY TIMES? &gt;&gt; Night and day. &gt;&gt; WITH WHAT? &gt;&gt; TEARS. PAUL [screaming] CRIED FOR THREE YEARS. &gt;&gt; KEEP WARNING THE CHURCH. BE CAREFUL. &gt;&gt; BE CAREFUL FOR THOSE COMING IN AND FOR THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY INSIDE. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, WATCH YOUR STEP. &gt;&gt; The Bible continue. &gt;&gt; Now this is a conclusion. BRETHREN, I COMMEND YOU TO GOD. AND TO THE WORD OF HIS GRACE. &gt;&gt; IF YOU NOTICE HERE, PAUL is recommending the church to two things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Number one, to God. &gt;&gt; And number two, to what? &gt;&gt; The word of his grace. &gt;&gt; And that word is the whole council of God. &gt;&gt; Which is nothing but the message completely. IN OTHER WORDS, PAUL RECOMMENDED THE CHURCH TO GOD AND TO THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; PAUL DID NOT RECOMMEND THE CHURCH TO HIS FAMILY. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GET ME. PAUL DIDN'T RECOMMEND THE CHURCH TO HIS FRIEND. [cheering] PAUL SAYS THE CHURCH NEED TO FOCUS ON TWO THINGS. &gt;&gt; GOD AND THE WORD. &gt;&gt; GOD AND THE MESSAGE. DON'T LOOK AT THE FAMILY OF PAUL. LOOK AT THE MESSAGE OF PAUL. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE GETTING ME. I'M GIVING YOU A FULL VACCINE &gt;&gt; AND IT'S GOING TO HELP YOU IN EVERY ASPECT. THAT'S WHAT IT IS. &gt;&gt; Let me START IT AGAIN. &gt;&gt; PAUL SAY, I COMMEND YOU TO WHO? &gt;&gt; GOD. &gt;&gt; And to who? &gt;&gt; The word of HIS GRACE. &gt;&gt; WHICH IS ABLE TO DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; BUILD YOU UP &gt;&gt; AND GIVE YOU AN INHERITANCE AMONG THEM WHICH ARE WHAT? &gt;&gt; SANCTIFY. &gt;&gt; IT IS THE MESSAGE THAT WILL BUILD YOU UP. IN OTHER WORDS, WE ARE RECOMMENDED TO GOD &gt;&gt; AND TO THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now listen to brother Brham because he preached like Paul. &gt;&gt; God hiding himself in simplicity. &gt;&gt; Because brother Brandham family are giving gift. Brother Brandham family say this and this. So who who who do we follow? &gt;&gt; BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY DON'T DO IT. &gt;&gt; So who do we follow? &gt;&gt; GOD COMMAND. PAUL PUT THE CHURCH IN THE HAND OF THE MESSAGE &gt;&gt; and in THE HAND OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT. &gt;&gt; PAUL DIDN'T EVEN SAY THAT I PUT YOU IN THE HAND OF PETER. &gt;&gt; NOT IN THE HAND OF &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE HAD TO REBUKE PETER. HE SAID IF SOMEBODY COMES AND PREACH A GOSPEL &gt;&gt; DIFFERENT THAN WHAT ME PAUL ARE PREACH &gt;&gt; EVEN IF IT'S AN ANGEL COMING FROM HEAVEN &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THAT ANGEL IN THE FACE AND CALL HIM YOU ARE A CURSE [applause] &gt;&gt; I'm giving you time to soak in &gt;&gt; so &gt;&gt; you ready &gt;&gt; you ready to get more &gt;&gt; you ready AH, OKAY. IN GOD HIDING HIMSELF IN SIMPLICITY, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY, "NOW LISTEN TO EVERY WORD." &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; You ready, MY FRIEND? &gt;&gt; DO IT. &gt;&gt; CATCH IT. &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU ARE TAKING IT ON TAPE or anything, THEN YOU STAY RIGHT &gt;&gt; WITH THAT TAPE. WHAT &gt;&gt; TEACHING? &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; WHY DO WE STAY WITH IT? THE TEACHING. &gt;&gt; THE TEACHING OF WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE TAPE. &gt;&gt; THE TEACHING OF WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE TAPE. &gt;&gt; SO IF IT'S NOT ON THE TAPE, [cheering] &gt;&gt; you didn't get me well. &gt;&gt; You didn't GET ME WELL. YOU MIGHT BE FRIEND TO BROTHER BRANA. &gt;&gt; THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; I RESPECT YOUR TESTIMONY. &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOUR TESTIMONY IS NOT ON THE TEXT, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I APPRECIATE IT, BUT I'M NOT DUTY BOUND &gt;&gt; TO FOLLOW YOUR TESTIMONY &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE CHURCH FROM WHERE WE CAME OUT, &gt;&gt; THAT MAN WAS DEDICATED BY BROTHER, &gt;&gt; HIS FAMILY WAS IN THE MESSAGE. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; THE CHURCH THAT I WAS IN &gt;&gt; THAT MOST OF YOU WERE IN &gt;&gt; THAT MAN HIS FAMILY WITH WAS WITH BROTHER &gt;&gt; AND TODAY HE'S THE GREATEST ENEMY AMONG THOSE ENEMIES OF BROTHER BRANA &gt;&gt; WHY DIDN'T YOU STAY WITH HIM &gt;&gt; I'M NOT FOLLOWING HIM &gt;&gt; I FOLLOW THE TALLEL &gt;&gt; STAY WITH THE message &gt;&gt; amen Amen. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; IF YOU HUNTED WITH BROTHER, &gt;&gt; THAT'S between you and brother. &gt;&gt; IF YOU SLEPT ON THE TEMP TENT WITH BROTHER BRANA, THAT IS YOU AND BROTHER. &gt;&gt; IF YOU WENT AND EAT DINNER WITH BROTHER BRANA, THAT'S BETWEEN YOU AND BROTHER PRANA. &gt;&gt; ME, I'M RESPONSIBLE TO GOD AND TO THE TEACHING OF THE [cheering] IF YOU ARE A BROTHER, BROTHER AND WIFE, THAT SON. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE HIS CHILDREN, THAT SON. &gt;&gt; ALL I'M ENTITLED TO IS THE TAPE. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; My friend, &gt;&gt; I'm not attacking anyone. &gt;&gt; I know it's easy for people, especially me. They they are looking for me left and right. I and I already got used to that. &gt;&gt; But I'm saying this because people must be free. &gt;&gt; Let's continue WITH BROTHER BRHAM. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY STAY WITH WHAT &gt;&gt; THE TAPE &gt;&gt; THE TAPE WHAT &gt;&gt; TEACHING. &gt;&gt; DON'T SAY NOTHING &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT THE TAPE &gt;&gt; SAYS. &gt;&gt; JUST SAY EXACTLY WHAT THE TAPE &gt;&gt; SAYS. &gt;&gt; SO WHO DO YOU WANT ME TO REPEAT? &gt;&gt; REBECCA OF THE TAPE. BILLY PAUL OR THE &gt;&gt; JOSEPH [screaming] BROWN OR THE &gt;&gt; I ONLY NEED THE TAPE. &gt;&gt; GIVE ME THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH IS A BROTHER. BIPON IS A BROTHER. REBECCA IS A SISTER. BUT AS [screaming] FOR ME AND MY HOUSE, &gt;&gt; AS FOR ME AND THIS CHURCH, [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; WE ONLY LOOK AT THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Why the tape? &gt;&gt; Why the tape? &gt;&gt; The church we came out of it. &gt;&gt; The even reason why this church is birth &gt;&gt; is because somebody left the message. &gt;&gt; The one who LEFT THE MESSAGE GO GOOGLE MY FRIEND, &gt;&gt; HIS FAMILY, THE NAME OF HIS FATHER AND MOTHER IS IN the tape. &gt;&gt; So what are you GOING TO DO? AM I GOING TO FOLLOW THAT OR AM I FOLLOWING THE TEACHING OF THE TABLE? &gt;&gt; I I I have a ballistic missile. It's already warming up. It want to shoot, [cheering] &gt;&gt; but I'm not there yet.

I'M GOING TO EMPTY ALL THE LOLLIPOPS FROM YOUR STUFF. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; JEFFERSONVILLE. &gt;&gt; JEFFERSONVILLE IS INDEPENDENT AND SOVEREIGN. &gt;&gt; SPOKEN WORD IS INDEPENDENT AND SOVEREIGN. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; I CANNOT DO WHAT THEY DO OVER THERE. EVERY CHURCH IS SOVEREIGN. WE ARE COMMITTED TO GOD AND THEY TAKE TEACHING [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; IF THEY DO SOMETHING IN JEFFERSON. I'M NOT SAYING I'M JUST SAYING IF THEY DO SOMETHING CONTRARY TO THE TAPE, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? &gt;&gt; What are YOU GOING TO DO? &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; OKAY. A BIG INFLUENCE CAME.

[applause] [cheering] I have not finished yet. &gt;&gt; JUST SAY WHAT? &gt;&gt; Exactly what the tape says. &gt;&gt; See now because why? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE THINGS &gt;&gt; WE ARE going to understand A WHOLE LOT ABOUT THIS. NOW WHY IT is what? &gt;&gt; Misunderstood. &gt;&gt; SEE SO YOU BE HOW? &gt;&gt; SURE. JUST SAY &gt;&gt; JUST WHAT THE TAPE &gt;&gt; SAYS. &gt;&gt; DON'T SAY WHAT? &gt;&gt; NOTHING ELSE. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I DON'T SAY THAT ON MY OWN. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] THE TEMP &gt;&gt; CELEBRATING CHRISTMAS IS THE DEVIL WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I DON'T SAY THAT [screaming] OF WHAT &gt;&gt; MY OWN. &gt;&gt; IT IS him &gt;&gt; that what &gt;&gt; says it. Who said it? &gt;&gt; JESUS. &gt;&gt; WHO SAID IT? &gt;&gt; SO, SHOULD I LISTEN TO WHO? LISTEN TO WHO? &gt;&gt; TO THE ARTICLE OF REBECCA. &gt;&gt; OH, TO WHAT JESUS SPOKE THROUGH THE MESSENGER. &gt;&gt; Take a take a picture OF THIS STUFF. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?

[cheering] [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU READ IT AGAIN? JUST DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; Just leave it the way it is. Are we together? &gt;&gt; In other word, MY DIRECTION DOESN'T FOLLOW JEFFERSONVILLE. [cheering] &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING I HAVE PUT IN THIS CHURCH, I ALWAYS HAVE A QUOTE &gt;&gt; AND A SCRIPTURE TO BACK IT UP. &gt;&gt; WHETHER IT'S THE OFFICE, EVERYTHING I CAN PROVE TO YOU BY THE COURT. WHY? BECAUSE THE CHURCH NEED TO BE FOUNDED ON THE MESSAGE. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; brother Brham says that &gt;&gt; his family did it. &gt;&gt; This is the picture brother Steven his family did it. &gt;&gt; So who am I committed to? &gt;&gt; Follow the family &gt;&gt; or should I follow the tape? LET ME DEAL WITH the family a little bit. &gt;&gt; It's not me. I'm reading, brother, BROTHER. SO, YOU DON'T WANT ME TO READ THE CODE? &gt;&gt; If you don't WANT ME TO READ THE CODE, YOU YOU NEED TO SEARCH ANOTHER PASTOR. &gt;&gt; NOT ME. ME, I WILL READ THE QUOTE. [cheering] &gt;&gt; You want me to read the quote? &gt;&gt; I DON'T SAY MY WIFE WON'T DO IT. COME ON NOW, LORD. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM WAS TALKING ABOUT THE DRESSING. HE SAYS, "I DON'T say my wife won't do it." &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, EVEN HIS FAMILY &gt;&gt; IS SUBJECT TO THE ATTACK OF THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T WANT TO SAY AMEN. HE SAID, "I DON'T SAY MY WIFE WON'T DO IT, &gt;&gt; BUT I HAVE TO BE CHANGED &gt;&gt; AND PROVIDED &gt;&gt; TO WHAT I AM NOW. IF I EVER LIVE WITH HER WHILE SHE'S DOING IT, &gt;&gt; SHE'S DOING IT. &gt;&gt; IF HIS FAMILY IS SUBJECT TO THE DEVIL, &gt;&gt; WHO SHOULD WE FOLLOW? FOLLOW HIS FAMILY OR FOLLOW THE WORD. [cheering] [screaming] &gt;&gt; I knew it was a ballistic missile. &gt;&gt; IT'S STILL RINGING. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY HE SAY THAT IS EXACTLY &gt;&gt; MY [screaming] GO. &gt;&gt; THEY MAY DO IT WHEN THEY GET TO BE WOMEN. &gt;&gt; I DON'T SAY THEY WON'T. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW. THAT IS UP TO THE MERCY OF WHO? &gt;&gt; I HOPE [screaming] THEY DON'T. SISTER SARAH DID THIS THIS THIS THIS. Sister Sarah is NOT YOUR EXAMPLE. &gt;&gt; YOUR EXAMPLE IS THE WORD. [cheering] &gt;&gt; SO IF SARAH LEAVE THE MESSAGE SO WE NEED TO LEAVE THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM SAID THAT IS UP TO WHO? &gt;&gt; THE MERCY of God. &gt;&gt; I HOPE THEY DON'T. IF THEY DO &gt;&gt; HIS CHILDREN, &gt;&gt; THEY SHALL WALK OVER THE PRAYERS &gt;&gt; OF A RIGHTEOUS WHAT? &gt;&gt; FATHER, &gt;&gt; THEY SHALL WALK OVER THE LIFE OF SOMEBODY WHO TRIED TO LIVE. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; IF THEY HAVE A WHAT? &gt;&gt; DO IT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. BUT I WANT TO LIVE HOW, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; TEACH WHAT? &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BE WHAT? &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND COULD INSTRUCT THEM HOW, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; IF THEY DO THAT, THEY SHALL BEAT THEIR WAY TO HELL. SAY &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'M GIVING YOU TIME. &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAY IF HIS FAMILY DOES IT, THEY WILL DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; BEAT THEIR way to hell. &gt;&gt; SO WHO SHOULD WE FOLLOW AS AN EXAMPLE? &gt;&gt; PAUL SAY FOLLOW ME AS I FOLLOW. &gt;&gt; SO WHICH MESSENGER DO WE FOLLOW? &gt;&gt; HOW MANY MESSENGER DO WE HAVE? &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; HEY, &gt;&gt; IF YOU DON'T KNOW, WE ONLY HAVE ONE PROPHET MAJOR &gt;&gt; AND HIS NAME IS WILLIAM MARION BRANA &gt;&gt; AND HE TOLD ME STAY WITH the [cheering] s. &gt;&gt; CAN I CONTINUE? &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; Can I continue? THIS IS WHY YOU SEE PEOPLE SO SO SO CONFUSED IN THE WORD. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE IN AFRICA. THEY FOLLOW IN JEFFERSONVILLE. &gt;&gt; PREACHING AFRICA. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; PREACH IN SOUTH AMERICA. LEAVE UNITED STATES ALONE. &gt;&gt; GO TO THEM. YOU SAY, "BROTHER, DO YOU HAVE THE MATERIAL?

[applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; I'm giving you time. OUCH. &gt;&gt; Don't worry, my friend. I'm giving you time. &gt;&gt; LET ME CONTINUE READING. HE SAYS, "IF THEY DO THAT, THEY SHALL DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; BEAT THEIR WAY TO HELL." &gt;&gt; OVER THE TOP OF MY WHAT? &gt;&gt; PREACHING. &gt;&gt; AND OVER THE TOP OF WHO? &gt;&gt; MY CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AND OVER THE TOP OF WHAT? &gt;&gt; MY WARNING. &gt;&gt; THAT IS RIGHT.

[cheering] WHO DO YOU FOLLOW? &gt;&gt; It looks like human being never want to be free. &gt;&gt; If they free them from something, they get under something. &gt;&gt; They never want to BE FREE &gt;&gt; AND GOD CAME TO FREE YOU. &gt;&gt; BE UNDER ONE THING, &gt;&gt; NOT ME. THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. [cheering] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY I DID I DIDN'T SAY MY family won't do it. What about if his family does it? &gt;&gt; You go for &gt;&gt; this court. I prayed over it. I lost it &gt;&gt; and I pray I pray. I said, "Lord, please help me find." And finally, the Lord pulled it up to me. I say, "I'm not going to send to the person. I'm going to put it so the whole church can see this. &gt;&gt; I commit you to God and to the word. &gt;&gt; WE ARE COMMITTED TO GOD AND THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR." &gt;&gt; You might be brother Brandham best friend. You might be brother, brother, whatever, FAMILY MEMBER OR COUSIN or whatever. If it's not on the tape, &gt;&gt; SPOKEN WORD. IF IT'S NOT ON THE TAPE &gt;&gt; AND THE BOOKS THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM HIMSELF SAY THE CHURCH IS BOOK AND IF IT'S NOT THERE, &gt;&gt; PLEASE with a lot of respect, &gt;&gt; keep your testimony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you're getting me. &gt;&gt; Keep your testimony. &gt;&gt; I APPRECIATE IT. I'M NOT SAYING YOU LYING, &gt;&gt; BUT I'M NOT DUTY BOUND &gt;&gt; TO WHAT happened between you and brother. &gt;&gt; What about if at the end somebody was lying? &gt;&gt; So what are you going to do? &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU GOING TO DO? &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO IF SOMEBODY LIED TO YOU? &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY we want to see it ON THE TAPE. SHOW ME THE QUOTES. &gt;&gt; SHOW ME THE SCRIPTURE. &gt;&gt; PERIOD. &gt;&gt; IF YOU WANT TO HUNT, CONTINUE HUNTING. THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM. KEEP THE PICTURE. THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM. I'M NOT GOING TO FILL ALL THE PICTURE of brother Brandham family here. No, I HAVE SPECIFIC PICTURE. THAT ONE HAVE A REASON. THAT'S NOT EVEN THE PICTURE OF BROTHER BRHAM. BROTHER BRHAM SAY THAT WAS THE PICTURE OF CHRIST. HE WAS JUST STANDING BY HIM. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY I PUT IT THERE. THIS ONE. DO YOU SEE THE FACE OF BROTHER BRANDHAM? &gt;&gt; IT IS THE FACE OF JESUS CHRIST &gt;&gt; WHICH WAS DEFENDICATED BY THIS ONE. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; What do you want? &gt;&gt; This is my position when it come to Christmas. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can take the picture. Everything you want to take, I stay with what he says on the table. If they step say no, that's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's it. Oh, no, no, no. We know the family of so and so. [laughter] Let me put my foot right there on the tape. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So, we spoke about this in the hotel. We preached this again here. &gt;&gt; We gave you chemotherapy. And the fourth one is what I spoke today. And what I spoke today, IT'S NOT ONLY APPLYING TO CHRISTMAS &gt;&gt; BUT to everything. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Bipo, our brother, &gt;&gt; HIS FAMILY WILL RESPECT THEM. &gt;&gt; But when it comes to the word, &gt;&gt; we stay with what the tape say. &gt;&gt; If you want to know the dressing, don't look at THE DRESSING OF REBECCA. &gt;&gt; LOOK AT WHAT the tape say. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you want to know how to marry, look at what they did in the tape. &gt;&gt; Stay with tape teaching. &gt;&gt; Are we clear? &gt;&gt; ARE WE CLEAR? &gt;&gt; AH, LET'S GIVE THE LORD a big clap. [applause] &gt;&gt; You can turn your camera on. My subject this morning &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; If you fool, we close here. &gt;&gt; And I see you next Sunday. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you fool, you tell me. We close here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why I don't want to preach Wednesdays and things like that because if I give Sunday, Wednesday, Sunday, it's it will overwhelm you. I'm giving you a week to digest. &gt;&gt; Then we come back.
