[27:56] the name of the lord
[27:58] how many enjoy the service last week
[28:02] amen
[28:05] blessed be the name of the lord tonight
[28:08] i'm not preaching
[28:10] we have one of our local ministers who
[28:12] will be preaching
[28:14] for us tonight but i just want to
[28:16] mention i know i've seen a lot of folks
[28:19] online streaming if you would brother
[28:22] david probably will remind it to the
[28:24] church
[28:25] you can read this day one and it's the
[28:28] chapter two
[28:30] amen just focus on one and two
[28:33] a book keep opening opening opening
[28:37] opening it seems like i don't know when
[28:40] we're gonna leave western go back to the
[28:43] mystery of the two steps amen
[28:47] so just remember esther chapter one
[28:50] we already dealt with the first feast of
[28:52] king ahazarys
[28:53] we dealt with the second one now we need
[28:55] to get to the third fist
[28:57] so to prepare to the third fish you need
[29:00] esther one
[29:01] and that's the chapter two you focus on
[29:03] them and those who can
[29:07] in the church age book
[29:11] you start having homeworks now amen
[29:15] in the church age book you can get this
[29:18] online it's for free
[29:20] in the age of sardisian churches the
[29:24] fifa
[29:26] there is a section where brother branham
[29:28] handled the promise
[29:30] to the overcomer i didn't say read the
[29:34] whole
[29:34] churches if you can read it that's fine
[29:38] but that section deal with i will not
[29:41] blot
[29:42] his name out of the book of life
[29:46] just that section if you have a time
[29:50] you can read just that section
[29:53] you need it for esther chapter 2
[29:57] because the book of life opened up in
[29:59] esther chapter 2.
[30:01] i'm not gonna preach it the whole book
[30:05] but we need to touch it but if you get
[30:08] the book of life
[30:09] from the sardisian church age it's gonna
[30:12] be easy for you to travel on sunday
[30:15] without any problem
[30:16] so once we get to the mystery of
[30:18] predestination
[30:20] then we can preach the book of life then
[30:23] it's going to be
[30:23] clear and you're going to appreciate god
[30:26] more
[30:26] and more in your life for god
[30:31] having chosen you before the foundation
[30:34] of the world
[30:35] it's gonna bring you more closer to god
[30:39] never like before because you're gonna
[30:42] see where you're coming from
[30:43] and what you could have been if it was
[30:47] not
[30:48] for the choosing and the grace of god
[30:51] and even when he came he chose judah
[30:53] [Music]
[30:55] but judah had to be let go because
[30:58] according to the progress
[31:00] the program of god judah was not there
[31:03] so esther chapter one esther chapter two
[31:07] the sardisian church age the section
[31:09] that say
[31:10] the promise to the overcomer brother
[31:12] problem is dealing

[36:28] i'll tell you it's just uh it's a
[36:31] blessing i said lord it's
[36:32] amazing how you do things i said lord my
[36:34] precious brother i
[36:36] looked at him when he came out the door
[36:38] suddenly there and
[36:39] i said lord strengthening strengthen our
[36:42] pastor
[36:42] i said lord there's some don't
[36:44] understand you know it's a different
[36:46] anointing when you're up under here
[36:48] and then when you leave it it takes your
[36:51] toll
[36:51] i think brother branham said what 30
[36:53] minutes of preaching was like
[36:54] eight hours of work i think he said so
[36:57] we have to realize you you know you're
[36:59] getting yourself
[37:00] out of the way especially when you have
[37:02] a precious group like this
[37:04] that love the word of god you know when
[37:07] you're just poor and you're just
[37:08] poor so he won't let you down tonight he
[37:11] said look here once
[37:12] once you have it say amen let's look at
[37:15] the
[37:15] psalms 33 and let's look at verse 16 we
[37:19] look at verse 16 through 22.
[37:22] he says there is no king saved by the
[37:24] multitude
[37:25] of and hosts a mighty man is not
[37:29] is not delivered by much strength he
[37:31] says
[37:32] and a horse is vain thing for safety
[37:35] neither shall he deliver any by his
[37:38] strength in other words there's no
[37:39] salvation in nothing but the lord jesus
[37:42] christ
[37:42] nothing but him he said now he says to
[37:45] deliver their soul
[37:46] he said beho behold the eye of the lord
[37:50] is upon them that fear him upon them
[37:53] that
[37:53] hope is is in his what mercy it says to
[37:57] deliver their soul from death and keep
[37:59] them
[38:00] alive in the famine oh we got a word in
[38:02] here tonight you don't have to worry
[38:04] about the virus
[38:05] huh he says our soul waited for the lord
[38:08] he is our help and our shield he said
[38:12] for our heart shall rejoice in him
[38:15] because he have to
[38:16] because we have trusted in his what holy
[38:19] name
[38:20] let thy mercy o lord be upon
[38:23] us according as we hope in thee
[38:26] in psalms 106.
[38:34] and uh we'll just read two verses out of
[38:37] here when she said
[38:38] have it say amen psalms 106 and
[38:43] so seven and eight our fathers
[38:46] understood not thy wonders in egypt
[38:50] they remember not the multitude of thy
[38:52] mercies
[38:53] but provoked him at the sea even
[38:56] at the red sea nevertheless he
[38:59] saved them for his name's sake that he
[39:02] might make his mighty power to the
[39:05] name may the lord have a blessing to the
[39:07] reading of his word
[39:08] you may be seated
[39:11] you know here on tonight i tell you i
[39:14] just i thought i really couldn't change
[39:16] the title because it was such
[39:17] it was so good you know brother branham
[39:19] um minister
[39:21] a message uh misunderstood
[39:24] misunderstanding god
[39:26] a misunderstood god is that right
[39:29] so we're going to look at that here on
[39:31] tonight you know right there before that
[39:33] message it was something because he had
[39:35] a question and answers
[39:36] and then the question and answered you
[39:38] know at that time even
[39:40] most of them was it was linked towards
[39:42] the gifts and things that were operating
[39:44] in the church
[39:45] and they had questions but you know it
[39:47] was he thought he didn't have many uh
[39:49] questions so he just had two somebody so
[39:52] he went and studied and he looked at
[39:53] this thought
[39:54] but i believe this thought was burning
[39:56] on his heart because he still
[39:58] asked the congregation to give him grace
[40:00] to preach this thought
[40:01] so we want to read here and look what he
[40:04] said
[40:05] he says uh verse he said the lord
[40:09] were now now we're turned into psalms we
[40:13] read the psalms
[40:14] he said our fathers understood not the
[40:17] wonders in
[40:17] egypt they remember not the multitudes
[40:20] of thy mercy
[40:22] he said but provoked him even at the red
[40:25] sea
[40:26] see now we notice we're going to look
[40:27] because you help us tonight
[40:29] because we want to bring it up to our
[40:30] day by the grace of god
[40:32] you know it was always through every age
[40:35] they always
[40:36] misunderstood god they misunderstood the
[40:39] spirit of god
[40:40] they misunderstood the people of god
[40:42] through every age you know
[40:44] so we have to understand we're our balls
[40:46] is that right
[40:47] it's no different we're peculiar people
[40:49] but we're of what
[40:50] we're the royal blood we are the royal
[40:53] family we are the royal priesthood
[40:55] we're talking about something okay we're
[40:57] in this at night this is the age okay
[41:00] you know where the lord has the pastor
[41:03] at because he's preparing you for
[41:05] something
[41:05] you know i don't want to get ahead of
[41:07] myself but we want you to understand
[41:09] now we're moving to a higher level is
[41:11] that right
[41:12] god is preparing you for something but
[41:14] he's got to build a character in you
[41:17] so you can handle what he's got for you
[41:19] is that right
[41:24] let us look misunderstood it says it
[41:28] is to stand is to understand wrongly to
[41:31] misinterpret it
[41:33] the prophet told us don't misinterpret
[41:35] the scriptures is that right
[41:36] it's trouble okay you can throw people
[41:39] off they're relying on
[41:41] the salvation from here is that right
[41:43] the words that come from here
[41:45] is because why this is the throne of god
[41:48] a pulpit is the throne of god
[41:50] it's the mount peace of god and where
[41:52] the word of god comes from
[41:54] is that right he said now misunderstood
[41:58] it's not comprehended it's wrongly
[42:00] interpreted it's not appreciated at the
[42:03] truth
[42:03] is that right so it's so when the lord
[42:06] talked about that sunday is that right
[42:08] people some people are not really
[42:10] desiring and hungering for the truth is
[42:13] that right
[42:14] because why it has to be a sea in you
[42:17] that god put there
[42:19] before the foundation of the world is
[42:21] that right
[42:22] first we were an attribute an attribute
[42:25] is a thought
[42:26] is that right that's why when you come
[42:28] into the house of the lord
[42:30] if you know the house of the lord you've
[42:32] got to be spiritually enlightened you've
[42:34] got to be prayed up
[42:35] you've got to catch what the holy spirit
[42:37] is doing in the air
[42:39] is that right that's why god is building
[42:41] a house
[42:42] god is building this house it's a
[42:44] spiritual house that god is building
[42:46] is that right the lord showed us their
[42:48] son you had cain
[42:50] he had abel is that right what have
[42:52] religion
[42:53] what had salvation is that right we're
[42:56] going to show you in the scripture
[42:57] reading this message his two spirits is
[43:00] that right
[43:00] but it's going to be so close it's going
[43:02] to deceive the very last
[43:04] but it won't deceive the very leg why
[43:07] because god had promises and we're
[43:09] holding on to the promise of god
[43:11] but i'm telling you there's some things
[43:13] out there that's real close
[43:15] and you're making you make to make you
[43:16] think it's just say the lord
[43:19] hallelujah i got a whole lot in here
[43:22] tonight but i'm just going to let him
[43:24] have his way is that right
[43:26] huh say what brother yeah i gotta have
[43:29] it wait see this and this
[43:31] i tell you i got time you know why i got
[43:33] time because god's given me grace
[43:35] now i worked 14 years on one job i
[43:38] worked 14 years on another job
[43:40] my wife waited 36 years sleeping late
[43:43] at night and i just retired last week i
[43:46] worked 23 years on that job
[43:49] the devil's in trouble now i can do the
[43:51] work for the lord
[43:57] i'm giving him the glory he kept me
[44:00] he watched over me he kept me in good
[44:03] health
[44:03] now he's in trouble
[44:08] huh the war is on now huh
[44:12] oh what do you say brother steve
[44:16] is in the message the message is in the
[44:20] fight
[44:21] [Applause]
[44:26] oh hallelujah when you got time
[44:29] look what he said let's look and see
[44:32] what the prophet said okay
[44:34] he says now he said now our fathers
[44:38] understood not the wonders in egypt they
[44:41] remembered nothing
[44:42] the multitudes of thy mercies they
[44:45] provoked him at the sea
[44:47] he said now he said now the lord added
[44:50] his blessings
[44:51] now look in here and see what the
[44:52] prophet says he said now i'm going to
[44:55] speak to you if the lord
[44:57] willing on the subject of being
[45:00] god being misunderstood he
[45:04] said i'll tell you i'll take it like
[45:06] that
[45:07] god being misunderstood he said you know
[45:10] misunderstanding gets us in a lot of
[45:13] trouble
[45:14] you know you know when i supervise
[45:16] people when i was on my job
[45:18] that's what i was telling them i said
[45:19] miss you got understanding and
[45:21] understanding
[45:22] that's why you've heard me say when
[45:24] understanding comes confidence comes
[45:26] confidence comes faith come faith is a
[45:28] revelation that only god can give it to
[45:30] you is that right
[45:31] so when we get around and i said tell
[45:33] myself mr glenn and he said i understand
[45:36] and you know it took me seven years and
[45:37] i was getting ready to leave to tell
[45:39] this one fella you know what
[45:41] oh was he a challenge but you know what
[45:44] i should get her in and teller
[45:45] finally we got these new machines and we
[45:48] got these new machines and their
[45:50] machines is under gps
[45:52] so some of y'all probably winning
[45:54] walmart seeing these scrubbers run
[45:55] around the store and buy them by
[45:57] themselves now whether they go
[45:59] controlled by the gps
[46:01] and you know i would tell the fellow
[46:03] there go put this
[46:04] get this started over this here at a
[46:06] certain time
[46:07] if you don't get it at a certain time
[46:10] then you're going to have to reroute the
[46:11] valve
[46:12] but technology is moving so moving so
[46:15] fast now
[46:16] you know if you don't run that machine
[46:18] certain times so many hours
[46:20] it's connected directly to corporate is
[46:23] that right
[46:24] and so corporate is monitoring
[46:26] everything so now but this machine
[46:29] replaces three workers so now i don't
[46:32] know what their thinking is
[46:33] but you know we gotta watch the machine
[46:36] so not only replace three people
[46:38] but it also supposed to do the job of
[46:40] these three people but anyway i was
[46:42] telling the gentleman he had to start at
[46:44] a certain time
[46:45] and they get around him so he didn't
[46:47] start a couple times
[46:48] he didn't do it i said you didn't start
[46:51] the machine
[46:53] he said yeah but i understand i said
[46:56] no you don't
[46:58] [Applause]
[47:01] i said i said you just has an
[47:04] intellectual conception of what i told
[47:07] you
[47:08] i said but if you had understanding it
[47:10] would be in performance and you were
[47:12] moving to it
[47:13] is that right now we're getting
[47:15] somewhere you want to see
[47:17] how it is in this message some got an
[47:19] intellectual conception
[47:21] and some are spiritual some are cardinal
[47:24] and some are fleshly minded
[47:25] and that's where it's going to come the
[47:27] battle is on is that right
[47:29] oh it's going to be showdown is that
[47:32] right
[47:32] because god when he send the word signs
[47:35] and wonders follow it is that right then
[47:38] now we have a brother come up here
[47:39] and say that the lord delivered him from
[47:41] a migraine headache
[47:42] is that right then not the pastor prayed
[47:45] for him but he know it wasn't him it was
[47:47] christ
[47:48] demonstrating that he's on the scene is
[47:50] that right all you got to do is speaking
[47:52] and stand on the word that god has given
[47:54] up in this hour here now
[47:56] i don't want to get ahead of myself
[47:58] because i tell you i want to blast the
[48:00] devil tonight
[48:01] okay i've been waiting for this is that
[48:03] right some of them don't know what's
[48:05] going on they might have the election
[48:06] out here but you know what
[48:08] we got it right in here tonight is that
[48:10] right the holy ghost
[48:12] is that right he has his selection that
[48:15] he wants to minister to
[48:17] he said now look he said god being
[48:20] misunderstood
[48:21] you know misunderstanding gets a lot of
[48:24] us in trouble
[48:25] many times that people say things that
[48:27] they repeat
[48:28] after somebody else where they
[48:31] misunderstood them
[48:33] he said is that right he said now that's
[48:35] what the holy ghost is doing in here
[48:38] ah i don't want to get ahead of myself
[48:41] it's things that people have said and
[48:43] been told and now
[48:44] instead of willing to say god had mercy
[48:47] upon me
[48:48] i recognize lord you're sharing
[48:50] something with us
[48:51] now that's opening up maybe i need to go
[48:54] back and correct lord
[48:56] and maybe i need to get this
[48:57] straightened out is that right
[48:59] huh let me brother brown who said you're
[49:00] shooting a gun and you just missed that
[49:02] bullseye
[49:03] is that right but i just missed that
[49:04] bullseye the father i walk away
[49:07] they see i don't get it corrected and
[49:09] then it becomes a mess is that right
[49:12] that's what has happened the message has
[49:14] become the message yes
[49:16] he said now look he said now i believe
[49:19] he said that person
[49:21] he said that gets a person in trouble
[49:24] i i believe he said don't you think so
[49:27] he says i know
[49:28] it would be for me a very good for me to
[49:31] find out
[49:32] first and then say it
[49:35] is that right you know what i used to
[49:37] tell the people i supervise
[49:39] i said think twice and speak once
[49:46] lord someone was glad to get rid of me
[49:48] but you know what they got trouble you
[49:49] know why
[49:50] because you can't work for a christian
[49:51] who can you work for
[50:00] he said but we're always seemed to be
[50:02] misunderstood
[50:04] he said now and and david david is
[50:07] speaking of
[50:08] israel misunderstood that the miracles
[50:11] when they were in egypt now to
[50:14] misunderstand is just to say
[50:16] listen to this now you see why when the
[50:19] holy ghost drop down in here
[50:21] you're saying that they seem like the
[50:22] pastor is being hard

[53:26] he said now look him we can look over
[53:29] there and saw
[53:30] the ones that tell you what we're going
[53:32] to turn some scriptures we're moving
[53:33] good
[53:34] my god my god turn the uh uh uh
[53:37] acts 8. i may not get a chance to re
[53:41] read it all but we're going to read what
[53:43] the lord bring to us
[53:47] see what happens we know in that after
[53:49] out here in here
[53:51] in the book of acts chapter 8
[53:54] we know that the jessica finish was
[53:56] stoning persecuting stephen is that
[53:59] right
[54:00] and he said now but at the time
[54:03] of they were driven out
[54:06] of their of jerusalem is that right he
[54:09] said
[54:09] but god was allowing this to happen for
[54:12] for a purpose
[54:14] he said now and when he would allow this
[54:16] to happen for a purpose
[54:18] and saul came and drove and and was
[54:21] making havoc
[54:23] they're destroying the church you're
[54:25] covering it but you had a
[54:27] predestinated seeds is that right
[54:30] he said now look for the sake of time
[54:34] hallelujah the scripture he said then
[54:37] philip
[54:38] went down to samaritan he says and
[54:42] and i'm at verse five i'm sorry eight
[54:44] and five
[54:45] he said then philip went down the city
[54:47] of samara and and and preached christ
[54:49] unto them
[54:50] he says now and the people one accord
[54:54] gave heed unto those things which philip
[54:56] spake
[54:56] hearing and seeing the miracles which he
[54:59] did
[55:00] for what unclean spirits crying with the
[55:03] loud void
[55:08] they recognize the presence of the holy
[55:10] ghost some people don't
[55:13] you let the devil trouble your mind but
[55:15] the lord but the pastor called it last
[55:17] time i wanted to preach
[55:19] earnestly contending for the faith that
[55:22] was once delivered to the saints
[55:23] the last time we hear but god caught and
[55:26] he recognized it was a sinner that was
[55:28] in here
[55:29] god knew someone needed to hear the
[55:31] gospel
[55:33] so god's changed it but you got to be
[55:35] yielding to be able to get out of your
[55:37] mind
[55:37] and to get into his mind get yourself
[55:40] out of the way
[55:41] and take the leading of the holy ghost
[55:43] is that right because he promised to
[55:45] lead
[55:45] and guide you into all truth is that
[55:48] right look what he said
[55:50] he said not anything and the unclean
[55:52] spirits cried with a loud voice came out
[55:54] of the many
[55:55] that would possess who posses possessed
[55:58] with them
[55:59] and many take with pauses and take
[56:01] william
[56:02] where what we're healed and there was
[56:05] great what
[56:06] now we're talking about it was great joy
[56:09] in the city
[56:10] but see when them brothers came in there
[56:12] but they misunderstood their ministries
[56:14] is that right
[56:15] so saul he didn't understand at the time
[56:18] that saul didn't realize that god
[56:21] was using him to push the saints forward
[56:23] is that right
[56:24] the saints went to scatter but it just
[56:27] didn't go and scatter and sit down
[56:29] when the saints went to scatter they
[56:31] went to preaching the gospel brother
[56:32] mike
[56:33] they went around and then telling them
[56:35] about the goodness of the lord
[56:37] is that right he begins now thy mercy
[56:39] that's what paul
[56:40] said paul said i beseech you my brother
[56:44] by the way by the mercies of god is that
[56:47] what he was telling them
[56:48] he would tell them don't forget god's
[56:50] benefits let's turn to psalm 103 it
[56:52] comes to me
[56:53] turn the psalm 103 help me lord
[56:56] hallelujah

[57:04] psalms 103 he said bless the lord o my
[57:07] soul

[57:11] holy name
[57:12] he said bless the lord o my soul and
[57:15] forget not what
[57:18] forget not all his businesses this is
[57:21] the only age of brother steve
[57:23] this is the only age that got all the
[57:26] benefit is that right
[57:27] because paul only had in part but when
[57:30] he sent
[57:30] malachi 4 luke 17 30 revelations 10
[57:34] 7 revelations 18 revelation 19
[57:38] when he's sending him down there on the

[1:00:55] got
[1:00:56] problems out there i can tell you why
[1:00:58] they they ain't got the
[1:01:00] the miracle because there's so much
[1:01:01] unbelief in these poop pets
[1:01:10] you drive around you see and when you
[1:01:12] sin you say my god my god
[1:01:14] you got to catch the mind of god you

[1:01:22] right
[1:01:23] huh god honors faith god
[1:01:27] god does not send someone out

[1:01:33] them
[1:01:34] because god will not be mocked
[1:01:39] [Applause]
[1:01:40] that's why if i come here in any name
[1:01:44] other than the name of the lord i better
[1:01:46] be careful
[1:01:47] the burden is not brother steve's uh the
[1:01:50] burden of god is that right
[1:01:52] when he brought us out of egypt when he
[1:01:54] saw what we were going to be before the
[1:01:56] foundation of the world
[1:01:58] he said i'm the lord thy god that he'll
[1:02:02] all thy disease
[1:02:04] listen to this here brother branham
[1:02:06] talks about the plagues

[1:02:11] chicago
[1:02:12] he said let me pass something here
[1:02:14] quickly
[1:02:15] as our time is going listen did you know
[1:02:18] that the bible predicts
[1:02:20] that in the last days that there will be
[1:02:23] a
[1:02:24] german war
[1:02:32] that disease will break out upon the
[1:02:34] people and will
[1:02:35] fall on everyone without the what
[1:02:38] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:02:44] he says he said now look but with
[1:02:47] but with the angel or who or
[1:02:50] or out well let me back up these
[1:02:53] diseases will break out upon the people
[1:02:56] and will fall on everyone without the
[1:02:57] baptism of the holy spirit
[1:02:59] but with the angel or who had charged
[1:03:02] over these plagues was given orders
[1:03:06] i'm rather steve a commandment he was
[1:03:09] given an order
[1:03:10] he came from the throne of god touch

[1:03:18] why how much kind of teachers have
[1:03:21] we got to be brethren we got to do what
[1:03:24] we got to get the church in order
[1:03:28] to be in that condition

[1:03:51] that's what it was
[1:03:53] remember brother branham also said from
[1:03:56] genesis to malachi he said it was two
[1:03:59] things
[1:04:00] every prophet touched on he was saying
[1:04:02] it was the coming of the messiah
[1:04:06] and he said the atonement the plan of
[1:04:09] redemption
[1:04:10] isn't that what
[1:04:15] we're bringing you into a knowledge of
[1:04:17] who you really
[1:04:18] are the prophet god said when they come
[1:04:22] into the knowledge of who they really
[1:04:24] are

[1:05:42] he says they wanted the army to rise up
[1:05:45] and to take them out and beat the
[1:05:47] egyptians down

[1:13:06] now we know here this is right after the
[1:13:08] resurrection
[1:13:10] but we're showing how even those
[1:13:13] disciples
[1:13:15] and even the uh some of the apostles
[1:13:18] they can clearly even have understanding
[1:13:24] when god is moving he's brought this
[1:13:26] ministry here for a purpose
[1:13:29] remember the prophet that god said but
[1:13:31] you got to know why
[1:13:33] god is doing what he's doing he says now
[1:13:36] look
[1:13:37] in verse 13 he said behold two of them
[1:13:39] now i'm going to speed up
[1:13:40] okay my yankee english is getting ready
[1:13:42] to come out
[1:13:43] he says now behold two of them went down
[1:13:45] same day into the village of came emails
[1:13:47] and which was from jerusalem about three
[1:13:49] scores four long
[1:13:51] and they talked together of all these
[1:13:53] things which had
[1:13:54] which had happened and it came to pass
[1:13:56] that while they
[1:13:57] commune together and reason jesus
[1:13:59] himself drew near
[1:14:00] and and went with them he says but there
[1:14:03] was
[1:14:04] their eyes will hold that they should
[1:14:06] not what
[1:14:07] know him see he says and he and and he
[1:14:10] said now remember we're talking about
[1:14:13] understanding
[1:14:14] misunderstanding god he had people that
[1:14:17] be right there and sitting and walk with
[1:14:19] him
[1:14:19] and still didn't have the revelation of
[1:14:21] who he was
[1:14:23] he said people are sitting now in this
[1:14:25] day and time
[1:14:26] in this message and don't even realize
[1:14:28] who he is
[1:14:29] is that right that's why you've heard me
[1:14:31] say if you go over the second you can't
[1:14:33] have time to turn this if you go to
[1:14:35] second kings two
[1:14:37] write it down and go home there and read
[1:14:38] it when you go over to second kings two
[1:14:40] and you recognize it was the sons of god
[1:14:42] and it was the sons of the prophet
[1:14:44] is that right elisha he was keeping his
[1:14:46] eye on elijah is that right
[1:14:48] but he wasn't watching just elijah he
[1:14:50] was watching the spirit that was on
[1:14:52] elijah
[1:14:53] and when he coming in and watching the
[1:14:54] spirit that was on elijah
[1:14:56] he knew that he was about to leave and
[1:14:58] when they told him not to know that he
[1:15:00] was
[1:15:00] about to leave he said i know hold your
[1:15:03] peace side
[1:15:04] is that right when he come around in
[1:15:05] there he wasn't watching him he watched
[1:15:08] what god
[1:15:08] how god had vindicated him he watched
[1:15:11] the ministry that god had given him is
[1:15:13] that right
[1:15:14] he didn't we wasn't going to miss that
[1:15:15] double portion is that right
[1:15:17] hallelujah 50 sons of the prophet
[1:15:21] stand by sons of the prophets in this
[1:15:24] message brother mike

[1:15:31] their performance

[1:15:49] james was looking at what man said is
[1:15:51] that right they were not contradicting

[1:46:01] as much as we love our car as much as we
[1:46:04] love our home

[1:46:22] that's why you filled the pool amen so
[1:46:25] keep yourself consecrating
[1:46:27] we already talk to you about the
[1:46:28] sovereignty of god
[1:46:30] how to break into the sovereignty of god
[1:46:32] by meditating by getting close to god
[1:46:35] that's how brother branham break into
[1:46:37] speaking to the square are you there so
[1:46:40] break into
[1:46:40] stay in tune with god stay prayed up
[1:46:43] praying doesn't mean you have to be at
[1:46:45] home just kneeling down
[1:46:46] you might be on your couch praying you
[1:46:48] might be driving praying
[1:46:50] you might be working praying you might
[1:46:52] be at work but your mind
[1:46:54] is constantly meditating upon the word
[1:46:57] of god

[1:47:08] my bible on sunday
[1:47:10] to show that memo can't have seven
[1:47:12] letters

[1:47:16] constellation
[1:47:17] of seven chamberlain the last one was
[1:47:20] carcass
[1:47:20] which was the seventh cell the angel but
[1:47:23] when he comes
[1:47:24] down there is seven princes that sees
[1:47:27] the presence of god

[1:47:30] that those priests
[1:47:32] are first in the kingdom you remember
[1:47:35] that
[1:47:36] that's the reason why in the sixth
[1:47:38] dimension when brother branham went
[1:47:39] there he was elevated on the throne
[1:47:42] because he's one of the seven princes
[1:47:45] it's memocan who have to speak

[1:48:22] that was sent from the presence of the
[1:48:23] king was carcass which was the covering
[1:48:26] of the lamb
[1:48:28] and i'm gonna show you a quote where
