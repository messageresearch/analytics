with the same energy if you go slow you stop the drum and you stopped it and tell them to go in the same Rhythm all right so no faster than that no slower than that but you just want to keep it that way amen so it warmed the brother and all the Dominion all the Thrones all the principalities and all of them begin to just run away glory to God my God unbelievable if you were City just shake the devil off of you completely until you feel like I'm ready to fight hallelujah hallelujah glory to God man I feel so good oh my God oh my God especially when the sermon brother John is not here when his sermon goes very good to the end this is when we dance for the Lord if you don't want to dance no problem I will dance for them Amen Let the Holy Spirit strike you you will you will handle yourself Hallelujah glory to God amen amen amen I was notified that all the sermon except one since we started the hotel till now it's now uh titled correctly on YouTube so if you go you won't see King a hazardous entry for you see King ahazarus part one and he put the theme just like we did for the four phases of Ruth then he says the son of man you'll see just say king of Hazards then he tells you what was dealt on that day so you will see all of them line up so if you want to reference to maybe Nell or I hear or the four types of love that we went through you will see it right away you can click and just go ahead so somebody did a great job to begin from the back there all the way brother Caleb did it foreign so we thank God for everything indeed all of them except the one because one of them the preacher didn't give the title so maybe we can come up with a title or just leave it alone that way amen it's good to hear Brother take my show back there we thank God that he's here tonight your fight amen glory to God you continue to stay in prayer the devil is fighting everywhere left and right people trying to miss accident this in the accident this one going on this one going on but through it all we are in the army of the Lord if we want to die in the Army because the Army will be resurrected and his army is the brother that's why in Revelation 19 he come with his army which are the Saint in Christ Jesus so let me be buried in Christ because I know we can be resurrected from there amen glory to God am I probably remind you this if I forgot forgive me but make sure you sleep good on Saturday okay make sure you're going back down time because we're gonna dive into territory that probably you have not got into it yet okay the boss opened up certain things I never seen it I've seen brother brand I'm saying something here and there and for years never understood why brother Branham say that and we called it but still don't understand how it was coming up but now when he opened up and see how everything line up together it's amazing how the scripture has hidden this message I don't know what to do amen amen amen so I pray God that I have enough time to dive into it and you'll see how the scripture hides things and when you open up you will be like my goodness this was written right here and we miss it for years so make sure you sleep well okay and you come refresh if you're struggling I tell sister Charlene to sing and then Shake everything up and then you're ready for the word amen and you pray for me because the devil doesn't want me to even touch the bible okay just me touching the Bible when I begin to read one two three four verses it's something going on amen but I still continue and I finish my verses amen if I begin to just meditate a little bit and I get something then everything begin to go like go off and I know what he's after but all I need sometime is just five minutes and they produce five sermon God amen so remember one another in prayer remember me in prayer so relax everything will be good we got Brothers Solomon and his wife is here sister Gabriel she's here you know brother Solomon he's not a visitor and when I see them I just tell them you preach like home because this is uh okay second home if I can call it so they can come and be comfortable and preach the word of the Lord amen so we

well Stephen your church make preaching enjoyable amen praise God so only believe oh please [Music] only believe [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] possible [Music] let's just think Jesus is here oh

under that promise that we're two or three will gather together in my name that I'll be there in their midst amen we we just appreciate the opportunity to stand here before you tonight and speak to you and we always kind of the great privilege to be here and we certainly appreciate both Stephen the invitation to come and to give us the confidence to stand here and speak to you tonight and amen though we'd love to see one another I tell you what I I just love to see the Lord not you amen he is the main reason for our services and we want the Lord to have his way tonight I mean how many could just agree with me on that Lord have your way tonight speak to our hearts if it's if it's healing if it's Deliverance if it's correction whatever it may be this is the place to do it ain't that right the prophet taught us the house of God's a house of judgment amen I swear God helps us and gives us what we need and so we just want to go to the Lord in a word of prayer and if you have a need on your heart just lift your hand to God and ask him to remember you and amen I believe that God will minister to you tonight father well we're certainly appreciative to you tonight Lord for your grace and mercy in our lives Lord to let us have another time that we could assemble ourselves together Lord with one another and Lord Believers of like Precious Faith Lord and Lord we we want to be in one mind and one Accord here tonight Lord we don't have any agendas or motives or things to promote but Lord we want to get in one Accord in your word like they were at the day of Pentecost and Lord they were all in one mind Lord they all had one objective and that was to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and I I will leave to tonight Lord if you're believing bride could put theirself in one mind and one Accord Lord I I believe there could be another Pentecost outpouring tonight Lord I I believe Lord there could be a refilling Lord if we would consecrate ourselves to your word Lord and Lord be desperate in our hearts to hear something from you lord lord truly that's our desire tonight lord it's for you to minister to us Lord this is Lord this this place tonight lord it's a place where you minister to us Lord You Lord in this building you you heal us Lord you correct us Lord You You Deliver Us Lord this is a a sacred Time Lord that you've allotted to us on this on this Earth tonight Lord we want to take advantage of being in your midst Lord and and just constrain you Lord to to minister to us Lord I pray for every hand that was raised Lord Lord truly we're a needy people but Lord we believe you're a great God that can meet every need that we have and Lord I pray that you just speak to every heart and every life tonight Lord Lord and granted the needs of your believing children I pray that you would just help me tonight Lord to surrender this little gift of God that you placed in me Lord Lord you didn't place it here for me you placed it for your people Lord I pray that you would use it to help someone tonight Lord to minister to someone and may you anoint your children Lord that they could hear and receive what they have need of when we leave this place tonight may we have the testimony that our hearts burn within us as you spoke to us along the way we'll be sure to Praise You In Jesus Christ then we humbly pray amen and amen amen God bless you uh if you have your scriptures with you let's read together in the Book of Matthew and the 10th chapter and the 40th verse I certainly enjoyed the the song service tonight amen that sister that uh sang that song that special my such a blessing amen I tell you I I I'm just one I believe you can come to church and have a good time am I said okay I believe we should enjoy worshiping God Amen if we don't enjoy worshiping I I wonder what we're doing but I tell you I I enjoy coming to church I enjoy worshiping God and serving God Amen it's the joy of our heart and so God bless you uh here in Matthew 10 and 40 the Bible would read this he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me and he that receiveth the prophet and the name for Prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he that receiveth the righteous man in the name of a righteous man shalt receive a righteous man's reward if you if you flip over a couple chapters in Matthew the 18th chapter uh we'll just build a little foundation with that text we'll we'll come back to it as we cover a couple of things here amen Matthew the 18th chapter the third verse the Bible would read this and said verily I say unto you except you be converted and become as little children amen now this is Messiah teaching here and and to think it's a deep thought it's not a deep thought but it's so simple amen that nobody else could could handle his teaching became as little children you should not enter into the kingdom of heaven so unless you're like a child you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven and this is where I want to draw your focus whosoever there are for shall humble himself as this little child the same as greatest in the kingdom of God or in the Kingdom of Heaven A man we ask that God will bless his word is you can be seated and for a few minutes of time we won't hold you very long just a simple thought the Lord's laid Upon Our Hearts I want to speak to you on humbling ourselves to the word amen humbling ourselves to the word I I believe that that God God loves humility amen God the very God that we serve he is he's the humble of humblest Amen there's there's none other uh that's as uh as far as humility that is greater than our God Amen brother random in many places throughout the message he would teach us that the great Elohim himself came in a body of Flesh and washed washed the feet of his creation so if there's anybody that knows about being humble it's God Amen and I believe that God loves humility we know one of the greatest traits of a true Christian carries would be humility and you know as simple as humility is I believe it that it's one of the uh one of the rarest things to find in the age that you and I live in today amen I believe that the devil the devil is always pressuring uh people to get puffed up in their mind and the devil's always pressuring people to Amen to make yourself more than you are to uh to have a big head if you will amen it's the God of this evil age that is trying to put a pressure uh to make people be more than what they really are but but tonight let's just be what we are amen let's simply just be what we are amen and I want you to notice it's the devil's job to to make us more than we are amen he's always out to Puff you up and to think you're the high and mighty one to think you're the great person and and we know that God resists the proud person is that right but he gives Grace unto the humble God Amen God ain't paying attention to the person making the most noise in the church now we all love noise do we not amen but that's not how you get God's attention you want God's attention amen see how humble that you can get now now brother random here in demonology and religious realm he would say now a humble submitted heart in the Simplicity is what brings you to God he said well that's true a humble heart God loves now no matter you don't know your ABCs don't make any difference just a humble heart amen that God dwells in God dwells in a humble heart now I don't know about you but but I I would rather not know any amen any of the deep things of God any of the uh the mysteries of God and amen I would rather not know any of that if I couldn't remain humble and know the word of God I I just want to say this amen amen the more the word of God you get it don't make you greater amen it makes you lower it makes you more humble amen true Revelation from God Don't Make You greater amen it makes you lesser it makes you realize how great God is amen and it causes a humility hey man it don't matter how much you know hey man just keep a humble heart and the message humble thyself you just bear with me as we build a little something in this Brethren would speak on uh humility and you you that's very familiar with the message you know uh as well as I do throughout the whole message you you find a theme of humility you you find amazing display in the ministry of our Prophet you find humility uh like none other and and we'll get to that here amen but brother Adam in the message humble thyself he says you know people want power but they really don't know what power is he said see they really don't know what goes with it the Way Up Is Down always if you want Power if you want Power see how humble you can get how many wants power to overcome the devil how many wants powered overcome loud to see you amen see how humble you can get that that's your access to power see how little you can become I must see how small you can become amen and that's where your power is he says just get away from worldly thinking and humble yourself before God and then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big bunch of noise amen other prophets not against noise no one being amen but you got more power when you can humble yourself amen listen friends God is looking for a humble church is that right he's looking for a humble people that will that will humble themselves before God amen continuing on there in the 77th paragraph there remember I'm gonna say now you show me a church that's humble now I know this is simple but stick with me you show me a church that's humble that's really humble not an arrogancy but a sweet Humble Church and I'll show you a church that has the favor and the power of God in it that's right that's the thing that takes it humility and humbling ourselves before God and letting God work through us he said preacher we want the power of God in this church we want the favor of God in this church I say it's time we humble ourselves and say God we ain't nothing and you're everything amen we want the favor of God to bless us amen let's get real sweet before god let's get real humble before God and say God without you in our midst we're nothing without you in this church it's nothing more than a lodge without your anointing we can't preach without your anointing we can't not saying where without you doing it it ain't nothing it's just a form of godliness Hallelujah amen you want God's favor see how humble you can get amen now now coming into this text here by the way and I'm in questions and answers he talks about that in Matthew 10. uh he has the question there well what's that prophets or word somebody gives brother random a question I want to know that Prophet is a war and mother ma'am said well it's whosoever receives a prophet in the name of the Prophet receives a prophet's reward amen romance speaks on that reward he says that's your reward he's your friend he said like the shunamite woman and it might come in handy sometimes amen I tell you it might come in handy believing a prophet it might come in handy but even what the prophet taught it Hallelujah amen and and to build a little uh Foundation be speaking on humbling ourselves to the word but the way I mention is the shunamite woman there but I I just want to draw your focus here for a moment on that widow woman that was there in First Kings very familiar uh text and reading in this but it's one of the most powerful stories that would link to the message of the hour but but you find that widow woman that Elijah the prophet how how she received him you you write it down there in First Kings 17 and 9. God tells him arise and go to Zarephath which belongs to Zion and dwell there I've commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee Heroes and went to the place where God told them to there and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was was there Gathering of sticks and he called the Earth and said fetch me I pray thee a little water in a vessel that I may drink and she was going to fetch it and he called to her and said bring me I pray a a morsel of bread in thy hands so so I want you to notice there's a woman here she's receiving a word from God's Prophet is that right she's receiving a word to do something from a prophet Amen to do something a prophet's telling her this he says uh to bring me I pray thee most of the bread and thy hand notice her response as she said as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruise and behold I'm gathering two sticks and I may go in and dress it for me and my son and we're going to eat and we're going to die in simple words and Elijah's said unto her fear not go and do as thou has said but notice this this is now amen he's telling her to do something that's not even reasonable he he's telling her to do something that the logical person they would not do and they would not obey if amen now now just be a human for a moment if you can but imagine this is your last meal you're going to eat and you're gonna eat it and you're gonna die and here comes a man and tells you no uh you you're gonna make a cake I'm asking you make me a cake and give it to me first now anybody in their right mind would not do that but I want you to notice the heart of this woman Elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou has said and make me thereof a little cake first bring it to me and after make for thee and for thy son now now notice this he says for thus saith the Lord God of Israel remember everyone said I believe he likes to hear that thus saith the Lord amen the barrel of milk shall not waste and neither shall The Crucible fail until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth now notice this amen she receives thus saith the Lord from a prophet now now stick with me on this she receives the word of a prophet now remember the Abel she didn't get mad and start to argue I tell you what bless God this is my food and I'm feeding my family first that was not her attitude but as she heard this saith the Lord amen and it put her into humility amen she humbled herself as she got underneath the word amen she got underneath so says the Lord amen she heard the word of that prophet and instead of fighting with it and arguing with her she said I'm going to go underneath that word and I'm gonna humble myself to that word he said well how happened preacher amen thus says the Lord fulfilled to her and brother the curse of all Never End dry amen and the meal never ran out because she humbled herself to the word of almighty God Hallelujah brother I tell you she didn't stand there and argue with the word amen and she didn't argue with God's Prophet she didn't say well I tell you why you're arrogant to ask something like that brother it was the humility in her and because she had humility her household was blessed and her son was blessed amen oh God Amen she lived a blessed life because she was I mean she was smart enough Amen to Humble herself to the word of God and I want to say this to you amen as you'll humble yourself to the word of God the oil won't run dry you won't be a dry Church you won't be a church that's starving to death amen but to all will always be there Amen in the meal will never run out you'll always have the spirit of God in your midst amen when you humble yourself to the word of God hallelujah amen you humble yourself to this work brother you ain't going to be starving for his Spirit you ain't going to be starving for bread of life whether there's an unlimited supply of oil and because the bride has humbled herself underneath the word of God yes sir Hallelujah amen she humbled herself to the word and receive such a powerful blessing now now there's many scriptures in the entire Bible that would portray humility hell amen God loves shamila to you find David and to me it's a very powerful illustration of humility amen he's a man after God's Own Heart now by the way I'm going to teach us that the reason he was a man after God's Own Heart is because he was quick to repent and I thought about that I thought you know he he was he was humble of to admit he was wrong he was humble enough hey when I'm wrong I'm wrong and I'm going to go repent I mean I want you to show I want to show you this man he's loved by God friends because he was quick to repent I mean he had a humble heart that he would humble himself to the word of God now listen just for a moment because he gets caught up in the flesh was that right he gets caught up in the flesh he was still a man of God Amen he goes out and kills Uriah amen kills your eye and takes Bathsheba to him amen and then God had a prophet brother shimbo amen by the name of Nathan and he sent him amen he sent him down to David and that Prophet Nation told David a story he said David what do you think about this there's a man that has all these sheep and he's very rich and there's a man that has these sheep or whatever the story he tells them he's a very poor man and he goes out and kills amen kills this man and takes a Sheep amen Nathan illustrates it and he says perfectly amen the situation that went on between David and Bathsheba amen and he says David what do you think should happen to a man that would commit a sin like this and Brother David in his indignation he said well but I tell you what he ought to be killed he ought to be slaughtered amen he ought to be in his End Amen but but then Nathan had a word for or for David there and he said David thus saith the Lord that man is you David you're the one that made that mistake you're the one that said and what did David do well bless God I tell you what nation I'm the king that's not what he did but he had a heart of humility and he said oh God he was so kind to send the prophet to my azarius and tell me I was wrong and tell me I was wrong amen I'm coming under subjection I'm coming under submission to the word of your prophet and I'm humbling myself and admitting I am wrong admitting he was wrong amen yeah give me some Grace I just got to preach I'm sorry amen listen church amen God has sent us a prophet in the age you and I live in and he called out things that was wrong that's right yes if I get top for a minute give me some Grace I had a brother tell me one time he said brother you know I remember the man preached about those TVs they're saying in my notes look around and preached about those TVs but but you know I would get rid of it if God ever told me I thought my god brother God's done sent a prophet and told you that you shouldn't have them things in your home amen it's a bad influence song that's right I mean he said a Christian shouldn't be in the movies here that's it yes he shouldn't go to them places they shouldn't be there my brother Simon if God ever told me that amen God has sent you a prophet amen he sent you a prophet he told you what God liked and he told you what God didn't like and I'm humbling myself under the ministry of a Vindicated Prophet yes and be said it's wrong then it's wrong that they set us right then it's right and I'm humbling myself to the word of God [Music] [Applause] I know it ain't popular it's the truth if I'm wrong I want to know I'm wrong now the world ain't that way but the bride should be but if I'm wrong and God don't like something amen I want I want to know about it amen listen church we should be constantly chasing after righteousness I said we should be constantly chasing after righteousness amen I want to go the way of the righteous amen not the way of the scornful I want to walk in the steps of the righteous not the way of the world I'm in an all by myself tonight I say oh God Amen may we come under subjection as your bride may we come out of humility amen and be underneath your word yes my brother yes Hallelujah wait hey man David was humble enough to admit he was wrong that's why God loved about David amen he didn't fight about it he didn't argue about it he was humble enough aiming to receive a prophet's correction ask you the question tonight I'm going to Sure living wrong are you humble enough tonight to receive a prophet's correction why you are you humble enough if you're wrong can you say God I'm wrong I cannot live and lie can you say God I'm not living God but help me Lord project hallelujah hallelujah yes sir amen humble yourself under the word of God Peter I mean this is simple but I just got to obey Gods amen Peter's a very good illustration in this same in this same teaching here I mean but but Peter's here brother he's taught all night he's a professional fisherman all he's done is fish is you know maybe his whole life he knew how to catch a fish amen he could watch the moon and watch the tiger he knew what he was doing amen and Peter comes in from the night fishing all night and didn't catch anything but brother amen he comes into the bank there that morning and the word is standing there and says Peter launch back out into the deep and cast your net sign go cast your net back out there Peter and Peter didn't argue and say bless God you may have God's word but I tell you what I'm a fisherman official that's not what Peter did but he humbled himself he said you know what I'm sure he knows is what he's talking about so he said ask our word Lord at Thy word I will go out and I'll cast The NED and when he became obedient to the word of God brother he couldn't bring in the match because there were so many blessings hallelujah oh God Hallelujah he humbled himself brother you you know what are you trying to say tonight here's what I'm trying to say we want blessings in our church it's time we get humble to the word we want blessings in our day-to-day life let's get humble to the word we want the favor of God on our families now let's get humble to the word hallelujah yes sir I'm in everything everything testifies of humility God God loves the humble he resists the proud many many scriptures and in Luke 14 11 for whosoever exalts himself shall be amazed and he that Homeless themselves shall be exalted people don't like that though brother they want to be exalted amen they don't want to get humble they don't want to get low I say Church like we if we can get down low we can be blessed by God I mean if we can get real humble before God In Prayer well we can get blessed by God and get saturated by God and brother if we want Revival in our own walk with god let's just get humble before God Amen and start praying yes sir yes my brother I'm in everything testifies Hallelujah brother Adam would teach us there that God has three Bibles you all are very taught uh you're taught very well here I'm sure you're familiar with this but the man we're taught that God had three Bibles he said it was the Stars it was the pyramids and it was the book amen God's three Bibles but but you'll find there in that pyramid I mean if you ever studied out there's different there's different chambers in that pyramid right I mean you ever look out in the diagram you got the bride's chamber and you got the gallery that goes up to the king's chamber that's a very powerful illustrator because it's God's Bible correct yes testifying of God's heart testifying and watch on God's mind is that right he said preach I thought you said humility ain't it's not deep it's everywhere you look you find humility it's the thing that unlocks blessings is your humility but you look at that pyramid there and the Queen the Queen's Chambers down there at the bottom of it then you got the gallery to the king's chamber now you studied out it's amazing because that gallery that goes up to the king's chamber it starts out a decent size a lot of people can go pretty far about that last little bit before you get ready to enter into the king's chamber it gets really tied and you got to get really low it gets really tied and you gotta bend down a little bit you gotta hunker down my brother the lower you get the closer you get to the Chamber of the king and the lower the bride gives the closer we're getting to the king's chamber I say oh God may we get down to the lowest of the low and get closer and closer to the Chamber of the king that's where I want to be tonight I want to go to the king's chamber and the only way through it is through that small little open way The Pride the prideful can't ever get there ain't that right I mean the prideful man can't get there I mean because they're too sharing they can't fit through it but by the people that will humble themselves and say God if this is your way and this is your way to meet you then I will go that way that this is your method that you have made then I will come down as small as I need to get I want to say this this is the place to say it amen God has made it such a simple humble way Amen brother amen some of you amen you can come and meet God tonight brother amen in such a simple humble manner I mean you say preacher what way is God made but God has made a way amen that you can receive amen the same exact experience that they had in Acts the second chapter but it's foolish to the world all this screaming and shouting everybody all these amens to the world right the world don't understand it but this is the way that God has given us yes my brother yes sir Hallelujah glory to God Amen Let Us humble ourselves amen that we can go into the Chamber of the king and all it all testifies of the meek and the lowly amen Jesus said blessed are the meek and blessed are the humble blessed are the lowly Hallelujah I'm in a powerful area in this year you find Elisha amen Elisha there as as he encounters uh meeting Elijah there have been very very powerful uh scripture to me but you find as as Elijah has came amen I met with Elisha yeah I want you to notice the reaction of Elisha after he meets with this Prophet that Elijah passed by him and he cast his mantle upon him now now notice what Elisha did amen after after Elijah came by him he threw his man along him and the Bible says he left the oxen and he went after Elijah and said let me I pray they kissed my father and my mother and then I will follow thee and he said unto him I go back again what I have a what have I done to thee and he would turn back from him and took a yoke of oxen and slew them and bought their flesh but the instruments of The Oxen and gave unto the people and they did eat and then he arose and went after Elijah and ministered unto him now notice notice the heart that Elisha has as he has encountered the ministry of Elijah amen he throws that I mean he throws that mantle on him amen and it puts him into action now notice him this for the longest time amen Elisha lived his own life he did his own thing he did what he wanted to do but rather there was a certain day at a certain time that he encountered something that he had never seen before amen he encountered something that was different than anything else that ever happened to him amen amen he encounters the prophet there amen I noticed that that heart of Elisha amen that when Elijah found him he draped his cloak around him and one Theologian would actually say it this way I thought it was very beautiful he was recognizing that he had been chosen to finish the job begun by Elijah and Elisha immediately he still loud in his oxen and he cut the meat over the fires of his plowing equipment amen and Elisha gave the meat to his co-workers and he set out to follow Elijah and become his attendant now now he humbled himself to be mentored by a prophets he humbled himself and brother the the way he does it is so powerful to me amen because uh his his whole life he's a farmer I mean he plows for a living he has the auction for a living but brother when he encountered the prophet amen he went he said hey I'm going to follow after this man I don't understand what's happening but brother I'm selling out everything of God and brother he went and he slaughtered all the oxen amen he burned his plowing equipment saying if I'm going to come and be mentored by this amen then it's worth giving everything of God it's worth selling out completely if I'm going to be mentored by this Prophet that I'm going to get rid of any hindrances I'm going to get rid of the job if it hinders it I'm going to get rid of whatever I need to that hinders it that I may follow this profits yes sir now his actions testified what he thought about it I mean brother my brother I'm taught there on speaking on that he said you see what he did he burned everything behind him and he cut loose of everything amen now a man in his right mind would never do that but brother he severed himself from his intellectual sanctions and when he was going to get a new life amen following the prophet and following his word hallelujah yeah brother Graham said what he did he said my he burned every bridge behind him brother he burned up his past and because he knew hey when the going gets bad I might want to go back to it but if I sell everything out if I set out reasoning if I shut out I believe amen if I get rid of all other and it won't be a stumbling block I want to say this that your job gets in the way of you and God Amen then burn the job up if the oxen gets in the way of you and God then Florida if it's hindering you and God and get it out of your life [Applause] amen if you're gonna follow the word brother you've got to let go of everything I'm gonna trigger to humble yourself to God's word brother it is all of the word amen not just the ones that you can bear but are the ones you can't bear you gotta humble yourself church and come under subjection to every word of God yes yes hallelujah amen amen yes that's exactly what Elisha did brother he got rid of everything that could hinder him he sold out completely I just want to say this friends amen we ought to shout out completely to God yes yes hey man if you're gonna do it then do it all away amen I just say what a prophet said he said my I would rather be an Infidel on that day amen to be a hypocrite amen I would rather amen this this may not be popular but I'm just saying amen if you're going to be in the house of God and be a hypocrite being here amen you should just go home amen God will sing more of you that you're just an Infidel and your eye hit by queer but if you want to serve God and you'll want to sell out to God and give it everything you got and set out every time every bridge behind you not least I've ever Shoreline glory to God hallelujah amen hey if it's worth giving anything to it this was giving you all I mean there ought not to be anything hindering us with God Hallelujah in other words amen Elisha testified by the life that he by his actions amen if it's worth I mean if it's worth uh serving at all at me following after the prophet is worth serving hey if it's worth doing it at all I mean it's worth everything I've got amen now now I want you to notice him this you you find in First Kings 19 amen and it's all the way till second Kings chapter two you don't even hear Elisha's name mentioned you have no scripture for for many many chapters I got into thinking on that one day and study I thought my I wonder where Elisha is I don't want them to hit me I know that I know exactly where Elisha is he's wherever Elijah is and that's exactly where he was now now historians believe it to be about six years that Elisha followed Elijah now studying this and I thought it was very beautiful I mean could you imagine being with a prophet of God for six years straight amen I'm sure amen I'm sure that he learned how to handle a whole lot of things I mean I I'm sure he really learned how to serve God Amen how to worship God Amen by following the ministry of that word Prophet I mean I'm sure he learned a lot of things amen amen humbling himself underneath that prophet anyway I'll tell you I try to imagine sometimes amen being that person in the Bible amen I tell you I can imagine Elisha I've been thinking what why am I doing this anyway I mean what what's the point of me following this what's the point of this new life that I've got I I've gotten rid of everything I've left my I've left my job I've left this I have mercy amen Elisha didn't know if he just kept on serving God and just kept on following that Prophet it will lead him all the way to a double portion of the spirit of Elijah he will just keep following it yes hey man I'll tell you amen I'll tell you why I think happened it's just me amen but I I imagine it this way as he is there amen with salisha when he walks by him and drops that mantle on him amen I'm sure maybe there was an anointing on that man and maybe he felt something maybe he felt maybe he felt the power of God on that same and so my God this is the most realist thing I've ever felt amen this is the most realist thing I've ever failed amen and he was hooked on that ain't been feeling the power of God I just want to say this even the prophet and the age you and I live in brother he has introduced even the power of God to the Church of God and brother ever since I felt the power of God and the reality of God whether I'm a hook to it and I'm serving God Hallelujah [Music] ever since then amen no doubt yeah there was times that got hard I'm sure there was times Elijah probably felt like giving up as a man six years following this Prophet but rather and maybe he was taught by that prophet and don't you ever give up Elisha don't you ever stop following don't don't you ever give up on it amen amen Elijah they're testing him one time three times actually hey man he's there while he's following him you just stay with me we'll bring this into something just a minute I remember he's here amen and and he said well I'm going to go up and go into uh to dalston or wherever those three cities were you just stay right here and by the way I'm taught a powerful lesson in that and because Elisha amen he saw where Elijah went and Elijah said you just stay right here he said hey as as your soul lives I'm going where you go I'm going where you go I'm gonna happen again you just stay right here I'm going on here he said hey that's my soul I'm going where you go and then it happened again hallelujah amen he said just stay back here I'm going where you go brother he hobbled himself I do that Ministry and he said I'm walking where you walk and I'm going well you go you say preacher what do you say yeah aiming a word Prophet taught me this he said you see what it was he was stepped into justification by faith he said you just stay back there I ain't staying there I'm going all the way and he came to sanctification and said will you just stay right there a Prophet Prophet she went there that's where I'm going you just stay right there no I'm going on I'm going where you go I'm going to the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going where you go foreign I ain't staying here amen church amen you call me crazy call me enough call me what you want to but rather everywhere I saw my Prophet go I saw him go to justification I saw him go to a Pentecostal experience I saw him go to laying hands on the sick I saw him go to speak and storms at him man I saw him do it I heard him do it and I'm not stopping shorts can I see it manifest in this body in these hands in this voice in this church I'm not stopping sure as your soul lives I'm going where you go [Music] I've spoken here before what was it amen to wave she a chief of maturity and when I'm sitting here now now get this just for a moment amen why was he following Elijah the whole time so he could sit there and say why am I I tell you what Elijah you're doing that preaching it's just so good you just keep it up Elijah you you're laying hands on the sick sign that that's money fine you're casting out Devils what a blessing that could be oh you're you're doing all this around you you just keep on going amen he was not he was not being mentored by a prophet Amen to set in a seed and to watch him do all of it he was being trained by the word to pick up where Elijah left off and the bride of Christ has been trained by the word you ain't here just to sit here brother you're here to cast out Devils you daughters are signed you're here to worship God you're here to praise God you're here to speak a word over your

old-fashioned Revival my Prophet went there brother speaking in tongues running the aisles and shouting them well brother you just don't know we don't do that in our church if the prophet could praise God and he could receive it if he could have Revival so Cameron brother if he got happy and shouted to God the bride ought to be able to brother amen if he could stand there and speak somewhere amen I'll go out on a limb Audrey might as well amen this is the age we're living in we're living in maturity but if he could stand there and speak a tumor at a sister Brandon amen come on friends this

I'm willing for it brother I'm gonna fight amen if that's what it takes to get a refresh and he's a preacher you really mean that I mean it takes humility that's all but I'll tell you I mean I've seen the spirit of God take people over brother put them unconscious and when the power of God Almighty he said how'd that happen brother it was people that was so humble and they didn't care how it came they didn't care what they they just knew they needed God and they wanted God and they desired it brother amen hallelujah I'll share a testimony with you yes I don't give a brother's name but many of you know him I mean this brother we had a meeting and his brother had uh the minister got done preaching and uh the brother at our church went down to the Altar and he was just praying and praying and

God's here to give it to you God Amen God's here to let you receive it and I said well let's just pray again so I put my hand on them and just began praying and praying and praying amen just as dry as it could be and we're not getting nowhere seemed to be we went through this ordeal about two or three times and the spirit of the Lord tonight this ain't for me this is God and by the spirit of God just quickened me amen I grabbed the brother I said let me speak to you I said the prophet told us amen of the story of a boy that he didn't know how to pray amen but he said and this boy didn't know how to pray so he would say his ABCs you say what are you saying this is literally what happened amen say your ABCs I said brother God knows your heart and he knows you want something from God he

of glory amen just just saturated that brother brother amen he was so saturated by the spirit of God Amen he couldn't even walk I was so full of the Holy Ghost that's my brother got an experience with

it be if amen if it's true teaching let whatever is true let God answer and let God speak and let him deal with us yes Hallelujah yes my brother I said let us be humble to the word hallelujah and when you find there when the disciples are there with Jesus and Jesus is teach them Amen brother man actually talks on that there uh when he went to teach on Amen unless you uh Eat My Flesh and drink my blood you have no part in me but the Lord said you see what he was doing he was I had too much crowd following him had too much crowd around him amen so he broke out the word I even had too many people around him that was there for the Miracles and so he broke out the word amen so he took the word amen I'm taught unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you shall have no part with me and the Bible says a multitude left a multitude left and went away but right there was a couple they were so humble brother they they probably didn't understand what he said is that right and let's be real that they didn't understand what he said what what Peter Peter talked to talk talk to John said what is he trying to say but no doubt they didn't understand it and so Jesus went to them and he knew they was Believers he wasn't trying to run them off but he went there to them and he said are y'all going to leave also hey remember brother they were humble they said hey we all have to understand it all to believe it all we don't have to understand it all Amen to follow you I said Lord we ain't never heard word like your word we ain't never heard a voice like your voice you alone have got the words of life eternal we will follow you what was it it was people brother that were humble they were high my brother they didn't have to prove it all they didn't have to explain it all but they knew his word and they believed him Hallelujah [Music] they believed his word yes my brother brother they were humble enough now now I'm amen I believe you ought to prove all things you believe that and but I believe there's things that we will not find out till eternity I believe whether Prophet taught and they're amen those things will be learning throughout all eternity amen sometimes God wants us just to believe him amen it ain't about your understanding it ain't about if you understand it all it's about if you're humble enough Amen to believe it even if you can't cross all the amen cross all the keys and amen and get everything the way it needs to be you know it's his word Hallelujah we're trying to find somewhere to turn a corner even Moses and Joshua the same way amen Joshua was our Prodigy of Moses amen followed that prophet and there came a point when Moses the servant was dead amen and there came a time brother sister that Joshua had to come on the scene amen he was the same way followed Moses for years and years amen and he followed him Amen to continue the work that Moses started amen amen amen to continue the work that Moses started amen not to stop the word but to continue it amen I want to say this I believe even though I'm looking at a people here tonight and when they have a Joshua commission that you have been commissioned by the almighty God to continue on the work amen our pocket has left us brother Hallelujah we've been trained for a time as this question as we'll turn it here and bring it to a close amen I believe that the

appear amen before the king we've been taught by the word of almighty God we've humbled ourselves by the word of almighty God Amen I believe God has given us an example you believe that amen amen I'll ask you a question amen how many sick people did you watch our Prophet just turned down and and not pray for you won't find any amen how many demons would he come up against that you would find him just back down to and say well this one's too bad how many I mean how many people would you find amen how many Devils would you find that I mean they came against him in his ministry that he would just back down and and just say well I guess this one's too hard you you won't find any cases that way hey when that he backed off amen of the devil backed off on the enemy never happened but he would always stand there pray in a prayer of faith I'm believing God believing his word I believe as the bride we have been trained with that same Ministry amen let's not back off any promises of God and let's not settle short of any any word of God let's not back off of it but brother I believe God has showed us an example in the age we live in amen of maturity as his children amen not gonna believe

it's it's how the favor of God is here be humble a malicious power of heads and have a word of prayer you know if you want to lift your hand to the Lord and say Lord help me to humble myself I mean maybe something you think ain't a big deal it is a big deal to God if it's in his word and let's be followers of righteousness and say God help us to walk before you in righteousness father lord it's our desire tonight Lord to walk humbly before you Lord as the prophet taught us there in the quotation we read that you show me a church that's humble Lord that'll humble themselves that that church will have the favor of God but that church will have the blessings of God lord we we want to be a church that's humble before you Lord we realize our lowest State we realize we're nothing without you

insignificant well we want to tell you tonight you're the great one in our midst lord well there ain't no great one but you Lord or may we be humble before you that we may Lord Lord be pleasing in your sight Lord and now that we're trying to obtain your favor not that we're trying to Merit your blessings but Lord we want to be a bride Lord that Lord that's humble before you may we be pleasing in your sight Lord I pray that your word would find a resting place in someone's heart tonight would you you see how you deliver this on My Heart Lord that Lord has chopped up as it may be Lord Lord I

brother Branham say total obedience to the word of God will entitle you to the token amen must have struggled that we get in this life is because we don't want to Humble ourselves we want to have our ways we want to make people know that I am so and so and this is the way I do stuff and they're gonna hear me they're gonna get it that's not God's way that's why your trial keep coming back and forth until you learn how to humble yourself and to let things go let people say what they want to say as long as you know that between you and God everything is all right that's what matters amen you don't have to answer it to everybody amen take your flesh out take the arrogancy spirit out be teachable be humble sometimes God will just allow something to come to your life just to try you to see where you are in your walk and before you know it you're on the ground you're on the floor don't get discouraged it's a trial to show you that you still have things in your life that you need to let it go instead of getting upset you're gonna miss God trial to a Believer are not the main are not meant for frustration say God is not the author of frustration When Trials come you need to be quick to discern what is going on and what how does God want you to react to what is going on and then from there on you can learn amen if you want to prove who you are God will send another trial he was send another trial until when a trial comes you will take your hand off you say God I'm not going to fight anymore I'm just going to let this go then the Lord will say now you understand let me go ahead and handle it this is why we have difficulty people pulling on each other Between Brothers Between ministers between married people because one don't want to let go if you want to prove to the other that what I say is what I'm gonna do and before you know it you'll be spinning yourself wasting time telling one another amen discern what God is doing humble yourself to the word the word is preached take what the word said and go do it yes if you come see a pastor and I tell you what to do not according to me according to the word humble yourself amen even if you know more than me maybe you're in a domain you know more than me maybe you're in a profession that I don't know but if I tell you what is good what God is telling me to do you need to humble yourself because you came to see me not as a man you came to see me as a pastor and I'm responding to you as a pastor so it's up to you to take your way your plan B what you have in your thought and drop it down and just obey now when you obey you say God I'm not obeying brother Stephen I'm obeying the servant of the Lord that you put there to instruct me this is what he told me to do and I'm gonna do it if this if you learn to do that quickly Deliverance won't be taking too long the problem is we get instruction we go we do something else we get instruction we go we do something else because the instruction that was not given does not match your expectation you are coming to see a man of God and you want him to tell you certain things things the way you want it to be done and when it's not safe that way you won't take it you go back and it shows that you were not even supposed to come to begin with so when you're approaching me as a pastor amen humble yourself amen amen when you are approaching the word of God to humble yourself if anybody brings you the scripture or a quote humble yourself amen don't argue just go down amen if you did what is wrong you don't need further explanation just go back and repent and move forward amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you once again for your grace for your love and for your mercy and I know exactly why this message came because they are individuals not one individuals in this church and all over the world that need to Humble themselves somehow in one part of the other may we learn how to be taught may they all Corner men father dies father you let Elisha 10 Years brother Branham says to follow Elijah before the mental can feed him and sometime we can't stand one year we cannot stand two three years while every Road that you are taking us
