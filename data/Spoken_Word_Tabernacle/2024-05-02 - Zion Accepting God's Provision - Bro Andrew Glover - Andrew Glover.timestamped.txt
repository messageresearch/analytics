[0:00] to do swinging your hands and everything
[0:02] else you know like the preachers done I
[0:04] thought I'd done just every one of them
[0:05] I'd watched him and done just what he
[0:07] did he said worst I ever heard I said
[0:10] Brother Davis he said I never heard such
[0:13] in my life he said a young man I wanton
[0:15] you meet me in my study tomorrow
[0:16] afternoon at 2:00 I oh M so 2:00 I went
[0:20] down my feathers all pulled over you
[0:21] know I said good evening Dr David said
[0:24] how do Billy sit down I said yes sir he
[0:27] said I guess your feelings is hurt I
[0:29] said they're just stepped on that was
[0:30] all I said what what did I do wrong he
[0:34] said I w't tell you a little story he
[0:35] said you know I studied was a lawyer
[0:37] before I was a minister I said yes sir I
[0:39] know that he said Billy one time I
[0:41] studied the law and I did it just the
[0:43] way you did the Bible or way you studied
[0:45] about the ministry he said I thought
[0:47] that I was a lawyer and I swore into the
[0:49] bench he said I got up there and
[0:50] pleading a divorce case one time my
[0:52] first case and said I'd see those
[0:54] lawyers beat on the table like that and
[0:56] your honors are judge and cry and wipe
[0:59] their face off with yours this poor
[1:01] little woman she's so and so and like
[1:02] that said after a while the old attorney
[1:05] was my opponent on the other side said
[1:07] he just sat and watch me for a long time
[1:09] said I cried I beat the desk and done
[1:10] everything just like the lawyers did and
[1:12] said my uh uh the old opponent said over
[1:15] there the other lawyer on the other side
[1:17] the man's lawyer sat there direct he
[1:18] said said judge your honor how much more
[1:22] of this nonsense can this score your
[1:28] stand said I lost a case and said I I
[1:32] was really whipped out he said I learned
[1:34] something then you see he and I asked
[1:36] the judge he said not and said the
[1:38] attorney too was a friend of mine but
[1:40] said he come down there and said Roy I
[1:41] did that purposely said you see you were
[1:44] going through emotions you were crying
[1:45] shaking your head and beating it said I
[1:47] do just like the other lawyers do he
[1:48] said but you wasn't putting one IE OD of
[1:51] law into it it's not how your emotions
[1:54] that wins the case it's the verdict of
[1:56] the law you got to know what the law
[1:58] says about it and that's the same way
[2:00] said about you said Billy you shook your
[2:01] head and you cried and jumped up and
[2:03] down but you never preached one word out
[2:05] of the Bible you went through all kinds
[2:07] of emotions it's God's word that counts
[2:09] it's God's word that tells us exactly
[2:12] right it's got to be the word exactly
[2:15] the word and when they seen that word
[2:19] made flesh there in Jesus Christ Andrew
[2:22] was thoroughly convinced and then he was
[2:24] concerned about his brother he went
[2:26] right quick did you notice him he said
[2:28] come over Simon I I I want you to come
[2:31] over set in the meeting with me perhaps
[2:33] maybe we could discern the spirits and
[2:36] we could find out whether this man
[2:38] really is the Messiah not he never said
[2:40] that he said we have found him amen amen
[2:45] it was no stuttering about it we found
[2:47] the Messiah come seeing he was
[2:50] thoroughly
[2:51] convinced Moses likewise when he thought
[2:56] to take over down in Egypt and killed an
[2:58] Egyptian he had got
[3:01] unconcerned he didn't he wasn't

[54:33] here on a Wednesday evening father as it
[54:35] was Lord that day on the Emmas road walk
[54:38] when you were walking with them Lord and
[54:40] it was in the evening time your Prophet
[54:42] said that they constrained you to come
[54:43] into that little room and Lord you

[54:51] here once again tonight in that little
[54:53] room of your word father we're inviting
[54:56] you to come into our midst and take this
[54:58] broken bread of life and may you break
[55:00] it apart to our eyes Lord we don't want
[55:03] to leave here the way we came oh God
[55:05] lord we want to leave here changed we
[55:07] want to leave here edified so Lord may

[55:49] give thee all the praise all the honor
[55:51] and all the glory in the wonderful name
[55:53] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we
[55:56] pray and all the Believers
[55:58] says amen and amen The Book of Psalms
[56:02] the 23rd chapter and in the first verse
[56:04] here I love the readings rather the
[56:08] writings of David uh because they're so
[56:10] powerful and here David is actually
[56:13] writing to us about the confidence he
[56:15] has in God's grace and he says here in
[56:18] Psalms 23:1 he says now the Lord is my
[56:22] shepherd I shall not want now I have to
[56:27] say it's astounding to me that David
[56:30] identifies the confidence in God's grace
[56:33] and starts writing about the provision
[56:35] of God if you read Psalms 23 he'll write
[56:38] about my soul is restored there's food
[56:40] in the presence of my enemies but what
[56:42] he's saying here is I have confidence in
[56:45] God's grace to provide now when you look
[56:47] at that word want the word want there
[56:50] means to diminish for lack of need so
[56:53] David is saying I shall not diminish for
[56:56] a lack of need but there's a God who
[57:00] will provide the need now in Psalms
[57:03] 132 right in Psalms
[57:06] 132 and beginning there in the 13th
[57:08] verse David here writing again and he
[57:11] says now the Lord hath chosen Zion he
[57:15] hath desired it for his habitation this
[57:18] is my rest forever here will I dwell for
[57:23] I have desired it now watch what he says
[57:26] I will abundantly bless her provision I
[57:30] will satisfy her poror with bread I will
[57:34] also clothe her priest with salvation
[57:37] and her Saints shall shout aloud for Joy
[57:41] thee will I make then there will I make
[57:45] the Horn of David to Bud for I have
[57:47] ordained a lamp for mine anointed I love
[57:51] Verse 18 and his enemies will I clothe
[57:54] with shame but upon himself shall his
[57:57] crown flourish amen the enemies are
[58:01] going to be cold in shame but upon
[58:03] David's head his crown amen is going to
[58:06] flourish now in the book of Philippians
[58:08] the 4th chapter Philippians chapter 4
[58:12] and I know this is one verse here
[58:13] tonight that we everone amen that's ever
[58:16] read our Bibles we could read this verse
[58:18] from heart Amen in Philippians chapter 4
[58:22] Amen in verse 19 Paul here
[58:24] writing in Philippians 4:19 and he says
[58:27] these words he says but my God shall
[58:31] supply all your need according to his
[58:35] riches in Glory by Christ Jesus amen
[58:40] let's just read that together but my God
[58:43] shall supply all your need according to
[58:46] his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus amen
[58:50] we ask the Lord this evening to add the
[58:52] blessing to the reading of his word as
[58:53] you can have your seats here this
[58:55] afternoon amen I want to by the help of
[58:57] the Lord for just a few moments this
[58:59] afternoon to speak to you here and if I
[59:01] title this tonight I want to talk to you
[59:03] about this amen Zion accepting God's
[59:06] provision amen Zion accepting God's
[59:10] provision brother B preaches a sermon
[59:12] and he calls it accepting God's provided
[59:15] way at the end time he said now for a
[59:17] text I would like to speak from on this
[59:20] is accepting God's provided way for the
[59:23] end time he said now let me quote that
[59:25] again because on the tapes I believe
[59:27] they're taping the messages and on the
[59:29] tapes we have some 500 texts that I
[59:32] guess I've preached from he said now
[59:34] they've got something similar to that
[59:37] amen but not exactly this they've got
[59:40] something similar to that amen but not
[59:43] exactly this accepting God's provided
[59:46] way at the end time now amen if you
[59:48] study the message you go all the way
[59:50] back in the 50s and brother's preaching
[59:52] messages like God's making a way or
[59:54] God's provided way God's provided a way
[59:57] of healing for this generation but then
[59:59] a prophet comes in 1965 and he says
[1:00:02] you've got tapes on this but not exactly
[1:00:04] this amen see accepting God's provided
[1:00:07] way at the end time goes on to say you
[1:00:10] know there's many ways that people take
[1:00:13] amen but there's really only two ways
[1:00:15] that a man can go so there's many ways
[1:00:17] that man can take but there's only two
[1:00:19] ways that man can go he said see that's
[1:00:22] the right way and the wrong way he said
[1:00:25] we're on one those roads the right or
[1:00:27] the wrong one see there's no middle
[1:00:29] ground because Jesus said you cannot
[1:00:31] serve God and Mammon which he was
[1:00:34] meaning the world he said see we're
[1:00:36] either right or we're wrong and now if
[1:00:38] we'll just get away from our own way is
[1:00:41] the only way we can get into God's way
[1:00:43] so the only way we can get into God's
[1:00:45] way amen is to get away from our own way
[1:00:48] and he says and God has made a provided
[1:00:51] way for everything amen he has provided
[1:00:55] the way amen so God has made the way in
[1:00:58] other words God has provided the way and
[1:01:01] where we get in trouble is not following
[1:01:03] that way and injecting into it our own
[1:01:05] ways and that makes a perversion and
[1:01:08] anything that's perverted is not
[1:01:10] Dependable amen so God has a way amen
[1:01:14] I'll say this tonight amen his ways are
[1:01:16] perfect amen his ways are not the ways
[1:01:19] of a man they're not the ways of a
[1:01:21] church but they are the Perfection Amen
[1:01:24] on display of the almighty God God now
[1:01:26] you know the Bible says in Proverbs
[1:01:28] 14:12 amen that there is a way which
[1:01:32] seeth right unto man amen but the end
[1:01:34] thereof are the ways of death amen now
[1:01:38] it's a it's astounding to me amen that
[1:01:40] there is a direct connection now amen
[1:01:43] between a man a way and a
[1:01:46] destination there's a man's way and it
[1:01:49] seems right into a man amen but watch
[1:01:52] the destination of a way that seeth
[1:01:54] right amen ends up in death can I say
[1:01:57] this amen there is a vast difference
[1:01:59] Amen in something that seems right amen
[1:02:02] and knowing something is Right amen let
[1:02:05] me say this denominations amen are
[1:02:07] walking in the way that seems right amen
[1:02:10] unto a man so if they're walking in a
[1:02:12] way that seems right that means they're
[1:02:14] walking without an absolute amen but I
[1:02:17] want to say we are not walking in a way
[1:02:20] amen which seems right amen but we are
[1:02:22] walking in a way that has been
[1:02:24] Vindicated amen as the right way amen
[1:02:27] I'll say this we are not walking in our
[1:02:29] choice amen but we are walking in God's
[1:02:31] choice amen denomination is walking in
[1:02:34] the ways of their own choosing of how to
[1:02:37] baptize of how to believe of how to pray
[1:02:40] of how to approach the word amen but
[1:02:42] there's a bride on the earth tonight
[1:02:44] amen who has died to her own thinking
[1:02:47] she has died to her own ways and she has
[1:02:49] come back to God's provided way amen and
[1:02:52] she is standing in the provision of God
[1:02:55] brother Bon all the denominational ages
[1:02:57] of 900 and something different
[1:02:59] Protestant denomination he said each one
[1:03:01] of them of course you could see their
[1:03:03] idea he said I cannot blame them amen
[1:03:05] each one claims that they are the truth
[1:03:08] amen that they have the truth and the
[1:03:10] people that belongs to those churches
[1:03:12] should believe that amen because they
[1:03:15] have stake their destination amen their
[1:03:17] Eternal destination upon the teaching of
[1:03:21] that church amen and there's so much
[1:03:23] different one from the other till it
[1:03:25] makes n 900 and something different
[1:03:27] questions amen got 900 denominations
[1:03:31] amen walking in the way that seems right
[1:03:33] amen and behind those 900 denominations
[1:03:37] amen is 900 questions amen but there's
[1:03:39] got to be one correct answer and he said
[1:03:42] I would like for us tonight amen being
[1:03:44] that we are trying to go to heaven and
[1:03:47] to meet our lord Jesus who we love amen
[1:03:50] let's search in the scriptures amen and
[1:03:53] find the correct answer amen I just want
[1:03:55] to stop here and say Amen I'm wanting to
[1:03:57] go to heaven amen I'm wanting to see

[1:04:06] getting tired of the pressures I'm

[1:04:28] want to see him that gave his own son
[1:04:30] amen that I might stand not in a way
[1:04:33] that seems right but in a way that I
[1:04:35] know is
[1:04:37] right hey we're trying to go to heaven

[1:06:09] guide us hey I'm not dependent on a
[1:06:12] preacher I'm not dependent on a church

[1:06:22] didn't bring us as far to leave us he
[1:06:24] didn't teach us to swim to let us drown

[1:07:48] price and is raising up the body the
[1:07:50] devil can't stand it that's the reason

[1:11:01] need is to walk the streets of gold what
[1:11:04] we need is to sit at the married supper
[1:11:06] of the
[1:11:08] Lamb that's why Paul said that my God
[1:11:11] shall supply all your needs I love the

[1:11:27] full he will feel until full come on
[1:11:31] Church in Luther's day he started
[1:11:33] feeling but it wasn't full in Wesley's
[1:11:36] day he fed some more but it wasn't full
[1:11:39] in Pentecost day he fed some more what
[1:11:41] it wasn't full hey but you are living in
[1:11:44] the hour of the fullness of the
[1:11:47] restoration of the word of God listen we
[1:11:50] ain't looking for a provision we ain't

[1:11:56] provision of God as the Bride of Jesus
[1:12:01] Christ I'll say Christ Jesus amen is the
[1:12:04] god of our needs amen which means he
[1:12:07] knows what we need he knows what we need
[1:12:10] and he knows what we don't need
[1:12:12] according to Matthew 5 amen I love the
[1:12:15] scripture in Matthew 5 he said blessed
[1:12:17] are they which hunger and thirst for
[1:12:20] they shall be filled if God has given us
[1:12:23] that blessed promise then the only would
[1:12:25] keep us from being filled with
[1:12:27] everything that we thirst for would be
[1:12:29] because we do not believe
[1:12:31] it if we could just believe now that God
[1:12:35] will give us the very thing we're here
[1:12:37] for we'll all go home happy and
[1:12:41] satisfied tonight I'm so glad he
[1:12:43] supplies are every need he promised he
[1:12:46] would do that now he never promised that
[1:12:49] he would Supply our wants but it was our
[1:12:52] needs that he would Supply because
[1:12:54] there's many times
[1:12:55] amen that we want things that's not good
[1:12:57] for
[1:12:58] us can I say this God will supply all of

[1:13:05] Glory can I say this and at the time we
[1:13:09] have need of it see there's times we
[1:13:12] need things and we think right now is
[1:13:14] when we need it amen but if we got it
[1:13:16] we' just hurt
[1:13:18] oursel come on y y'all remember brother
[1:13:20] talk about about Joseph as a little
[1:13:22] 5-year-old boy he said I was in there
[1:13:24] the other morning and shaven and he said
[1:13:26] now Joseph come by and he said Daddy I

[1:13:32] this well come on Church Joseph was a
[1:13:34] 5-year-old boy amen it wasn't that
[1:13:37] Joseph didn't need the razor he just
[1:13:40] didn't need it at the level of maturity
[1:13:42] he was at but there would come a day
[1:13:44] that he would be a full grown man with a
[1:13:47] full beard and he would need a razor to
[1:13:49] save it come on church and God could not
[1:13:52] give the things he's give to you to the
[1:13:54] Lutheran he cannot give the things he's
[1:13:56] given to you to Wesley or even to
[1:13:58] Pentecost but there shall come an
[1:14:00] adoption according to Romans 8 amen the
[1:14:03] spirit of bondage again to fear will be
[1:14:06] broken by the restoration of the word of
[1:14:08] almighty God and there will be a full
[1:14:11] mature Holy Ghost filled amen adopted
[1:14:14] bride of Jesus Christ who will have thus

[1:14:28] not give the Pentecostals what he gave
[1:14:30] the
[1:14:32] bride there had to come a maturity now

[1:30:00] Israel can I say this as the Lord is
[1:30:03] meeting with natural Israel he is
[1:30:05] meeting with us can I say what Israel
[1:30:09] Israel was led in their in their Journey
[1:30:12] amen by a god-given promise brother said
[1:30:15] they were going to a promised land they
[1:30:17] were going out of a chaos into a
[1:30:19] Promised Land from the ridiculous to the
[1:30:22] sublime can I ask you one question
[1:30:25] brother Maurice what did they do before
[1:30:27] they started on their Journey they went
[1:30:28] in their tents and began to eat the
[1:30:32] lamb for their Journey come on Church
[1:30:36] what they were feeding on was either
[1:30:38] going to give them strength for their
[1:30:40] Journey or keep them in the confusion of
[1:30:42] Egypt come on church amen they were
[1:30:45] going from the ridiculous to the sublime
[1:30:47] they were going from the chaos Amen to
[1:30:49] the promised land but they wasn't going
[1:30:51] by some Voodoo they wasn't going by some

[1:30:57] by feeding on the provision of Jehovah
[1:31:00] to supply the strength in their body for

[1:44:55] [Applause]
[1:44:57] provision what was provision something
[1:45:01] supplied or provided for
[1:45:05] use so when you see the provision of God
[1:45:09] use
[1:45:11] [Applause]
[1:45:13] it come on church when you see the
[1:45:17] provision of God use it you know the
[1:45:20] Bible says amen that there's seven
[1:45:23] compound Redemptive names of Jehovah the
[1:45:26] Jehovah of the old is the Jesus of the
[1:45:30] new butam said like this he said what he
[1:45:33] appeared as God to the human race in the
[1:45:35] beginning he has to continue on under
[1:45:38] those names and under that
[1:45:41] provision if he didn't he certainly told
[1:45:45] something that was wrong when he
[1:45:47] appeared to the human race and said
[1:45:49] that's what he was and took what now now
[1:45:52] brother said look what you made God then
[1:45:53] just a man yes sir come on church if you
[1:45:57] refuse the Revelation brother
[1:46:00] said I hate to steal it so soon brother
[1:46:03] Josh but you forgive me amen Josh
[1:46:04] Bennett preached at our our Saturday
[1:46:05] morning meeting and I tell you Josh
[1:46:07] preached like a man from another planet
[1:46:09] brother Josh broke in on that on that uh
[1:46:11] that quote where brother B said they
[1:46:12] reserve the right to deny his deity at
[1:46:14] any time brother B talked about it he
[1:46:17] said see he said by tradition they
[1:46:18] subscribe to Christianity by flesh but
[1:46:21] not by Spirit he said now watch they
[1:46:23] reserve the right to deny his deity the
[1:46:26] minute you deny his deity is the minute
[1:46:29] you move into a perverted way that is
[1:46:33] undependable anything perverted is not
[1:46:37] Dependable are you hearing me anything
[1:46:40] perverted is not Dependable here a
[1:46:43] prophet of God and if the Redemptive if
[1:46:45] you if you remove him from being Jehovah
[1:46:48] you make him a man you make him a liar
[1:46:50] if oh my I'm sorry I I stopped my
[1:46:55] timer if the Redemptive names did not
[1:46:57] apply to Jesus then he isn't the Savior
[1:47:01] if all these Redemptive names was in
[1:47:02] Jesus well he's the same yesterday today
[1:47:05] and forever and so there's no way out of
[1:47:07] it they're Inseparable if Jehovah
[1:47:09] appeared as Jehovah that will provide
[1:47:11] the sacrifice he appeared as Jehovah
[1:47:13] that will heal as Jehovah our Banner as
[1:47:16] Jehovah our Shield as Jehovah our
[1:47:18] strength and Jehovah is our praise and
[1:47:21] all these different names he appeared in
[1:47:25] he has to remain that because he
[1:47:27] introduced himself Amen to the human
[1:47:30] race by those names the seven compound
[1:47:34] Redemptive names of Jehovah was God's
[1:47:37] introduction to the human race oh god

[1:47:43] the people I'm going somewhere from Eden

[1:55:59] Prophet when he taught
[1:56:01] something you'll find it in the
[1:56:06] scripture we're going to our destination

[1:56:30] closing right here when it was in effect
[1:56:33] until that hour the blood of the Lamb
[1:56:35] was all right until that day but now the
[1:56:38] crucifixion it changes the old system is
[1:56:41] done there was a new one and the lamb
[1:56:44] was at the sacrifice the sacrificial
[1:56:46] lamb was on the grounds they were
[1:56:49] condemning and doing the very thing
[1:56:51] there that they had to do that's right
[1:56:54] he says and God be blessed for seeing
[1:56:56] this wonderful Heavenly light in this
[1:56:58] last day because the churches is doing
[1:57:01] the same thing today until the hour that
[1:57:03] organization religion is condemned and
[1:57:06] proved to be sacrificing Christ's word
[1:57:09] from then on comes the word and the word
[1:57:12] only from the old Pascal lamb has passed
[1:57:15] away and Christ become our lamb at the
[1:57:18] day of crucifixion and the day of
[1:57:20] denomination crucified the word of God
[1:57:22] and accepted a Creed in the stad of the
[1:57:25] word that's the day the word come into
[1:57:28] full effect that's just being
[1:57:34] recently what are you saying I'm saying

[1:58:17] saying this oh God the problem will
[1:58:21] never ever change the
[1:58:24] promise but the promise will change the
[1:58:31] problem so don't plead the problem plead
[1:58:35] the
[1:58:36] [Applause]
[1:58:45] promise and now somebody say now if the
[1:58:50] churches chur would forget their
[1:58:53] Creeds forget their
[1:58:55] dogmas and just take the Bible take the
[1:58:59] Bible plead the promise theise then then
[1:59:03] it would become effective it become
[1:59:06] effective to
[1:59:08] [Applause]
[1:59:10] them
[1:59:11] hallu can I say this you're under the
[1:59:16] effect of the
[1:59:18] provision of almighty God
[1:59:23] [Applause]
[1:59:26] come on
[1:59:27] musicians Hallelujah Jesus said with
[1:59:30] your Traditions you make the word of God
[1:59:32] not effective to you well that's the
[1:59:34] same thing today with spiritual Eve see
[1:59:37] the spiritual bride of the day so-called
[1:59:39] the church she takes the word of God and
[1:59:42] she won't accept it she accepts dogmas
[1:59:45] instead therefore the word's not
[1:59:48] effective to her see because she tries
[1:59:51] to inject her cre with the word and it
[1:59:53] won't
[1:59:54] work what are you saying preacher I'm
[1:59:57] saying this we are not carried
