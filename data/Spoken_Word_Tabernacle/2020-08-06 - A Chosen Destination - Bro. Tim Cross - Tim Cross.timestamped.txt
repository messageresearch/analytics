[16:28] i was just a child
[16:32] when i felt the savior leading
[16:38] i was drawn to one i could not

[16:44] [Music]
[16:46] and for the cause of christ
[16:50] i have spent my days believing
[16:56] that what he had me be
[16:59] is who i am
[17:04] as i come to see the deeper side
[17:08] of me
[17:12] i realize his strength is
[17:16] what i need
[17:21] as in the man there's justice
[17:25] for our souls
[17:28] mercy said no
[17:32] i'm not gonna let you go
[17:35] [Music]
[17:36] i'm not gonna let you slip away

[17:54] life in that's the face to face
[17:59] trying to seal our hearts away
[18:03] [Music]

[18:09] said no
[18:14] god so loved the world that he sent his
[18:19] son to save
[18:20] us with a cross he built a bridge
[18:26] to set us free
[18:28] [Music]
[18:30] but deep within our hearts
[18:33] there is still a war that's raging
[18:38] that makes the sacrifice so
[18:42] hard to see
[18:45] oh as midnight fell
[18:48] on crucifixion day
[18:54] the light of home seems so far
[18:58] away
[19:02] as satan tries to stop
[19:05] redemptions flow
[19:08] but mercy said no
[19:12] i'm not gonna let you go
[19:16] i'm not gonna let you slip away
[19:20] you don't have to be afraid
[19:25] mercy said no
[19:28] sin will never take control
[19:31] [Music]
[19:34] the life to is
[19:38] as darkness tries to steal our hearts
[19:42] away
[19:44] but oh thank you jesus
[19:48] because your mercy said no
[19:52] i'm not gonna let you go
[19:56] i'm not gonna let you slip away
[20:00] you don't have to be afraid
[20:04] [Music]
[20:05] said no sin
[20:08] will never take control
[20:11] [Music]
[20:14] life and death steps face to face
[20:18] as long as tries to steal our hearts
[20:22] away
[20:24] but we thank you jesus
[20:28] because your mercy said no
[20:41] amen the god who is reaching mercy

[24:12] lord when we sing the words of that song
[24:15] lord it holds such a special meaning to
[24:18] us
[24:18] lord as believers of your word
[24:22] lord and as a people whose attention has
[24:25] been called
[24:25] lord by a message that you have sent to
[24:28] us in this hour
[24:30] lord and your servants told us lord that
[24:33] the
[24:33] angel of the lord liked that song father
[24:37] god
[24:38] lord what it means to us father to
[24:41] realize
[24:42] lord things are constantly changing the
[24:45] times are changing the pressures
[24:47] the world the situations are changing

[24:55] that we have

[25:02] unchanging faith lord
[25:04] lord and we'll remain anchored father
[25:06] god regardless

[25:10] when that

[25:16] how it must take the attention of satan
[25:19] to realize
[25:20] yet one more time he's going to be
[25:22] defeated
[25:23] he's going to be overcome lord he's
[25:26] going to be overthrown oh god because
[25:28] you have supplied your children with
[25:30] something lord
[25:32] that is invincible lord and you have
[25:34] given us a faith father god that cannot
[25:36] be defeated
[25:37] will never be conquered lord we come
[25:40] tonight

[25:43] our needs at your feet
[25:45] lord every situation every circumstance
[25:48] every condition lord

[25:57] god to believe you
[25:59] lord to denounce every lying vanity
[26:02] every
[26:02] circumstance every symptom father god no
[26:05] matter lord how impossible the situation
[26:08] may look
[26:09] lord we realize with you all things are
[26:11] possible
[26:12] and we're looking to you tonight father
[26:14] god i pray that you'll take this vessel
[26:17] into your complete control
[26:19] lord may you guide every word that
[26:20] spoken lord jesus
[26:22] and may you minister to the hearts and
[26:24] to the souls

[26:38] this evening i'll invite you to turn
[26:39] with me in your bibles
[26:41] to the book of micah chapter five and
[26:44] we just like to say it's a real
[26:47] privilege to be
[26:48] in service with you tonight and
[26:51] our brother called and just asked if we
[26:54] were able to come and minister and
[26:56] we agreed to and just really counted an
[26:59] honor to be here
[27:00] and just feeling in my heart the lord
[27:03] has something
[27:04] special tonight for each of us
[27:07] and we thank the lord for that we
[27:10] are so thankful for this work
[27:14] that god has ordained for your stand for
[27:17] the truth
[27:19] and our prayers have been with you uh
[27:21] knowing
[27:22] uh what a what an ordeal it has been but
[27:25] god is faithful amen i believe you're
[27:28] standing for the truth
[27:30] and i believe where god's children are
[27:32] standing on the truth
[27:33] he's standing with him amen so we thank
[27:36] the lord for that tonight and
[27:38] just counted an honor to be numbered
[27:40] with you
[27:42] i'll find our scripture reading tonight
[27:44] in
[27:46] micah chapter 5 verse
[27:50] number 2 but thou
[27:53] bethlehem ephrata
[27:56] though thou be little
[28:00] among the thousands of judah
[28:03] yet out of thee shall he
[28:06] come forth unto me that is to be ruler
[28:10] in israel
[28:12] whose goings forth have been from
[28:15] of old from everlasting
[28:19] amen i want to speak tonight on a chosen
[28:22] destination you can be seated tonight if
[28:25] you'd like to take your seats
[28:28] as we read these as we read this verse
[28:31] of scripture tonight
[28:32] we realize that bethlehem was
[28:35] a chosen place a place
[28:39] that god chose to make his entrance into
[28:42] the world
[28:44] amen it was an insignificant place it
[28:46] was a little place
[28:48] it was a place that otherwise would
[28:50] never uh capture
[28:52] the attention of the world or the uh be
[28:55] an attraction to the world but
[28:57] because it was a chosen place
[29:02] amen it has a great meaning
[29:05] to the world today amen it it was a
[29:09] little place
[29:10] it was an insignificant place until god
[29:14] made it the place of his choosing
[29:17] and the place his destination where
[29:20] where he chose to make
[29:22] his entrance into the world amen down
[29:25] through time
[29:26] we realized that god
[29:29] has used places to meet his
[29:32] children and to change the courses
[29:36] of their lives amen the bible says that
[29:39] god met
[29:40] jacob one night in a place where he
[29:42] journeyed and had laid his head to rest
[29:44] on a stone
[29:46] and there you know jacob just thought
[29:49] you know perhaps like so many people
[29:51] he was just wandering through life and
[29:54] wandering through this world and you
[29:56] know maybe felt like he was
[29:57] he was just being uh controlled
[30:00] by the circumstances that were around
[30:03] him by the strife
[30:05] by the pressures by the family situation
[30:09] by the economic situation
[30:11] and all the things you know maybe jacob
[30:13] just felt like you know
[30:14] i'm just drifting along with wherever
[30:17] the wind or wherever the currents take
[30:19] me
[30:20] but as he laid his head down that night
[30:23] to rest
[30:24] he had a dream and in the dream he saw
[30:27] angels ascending and descending upon a
[30:30] ladder
[30:31] and the lord god spoke to him and we we
[30:33] read this
[30:34] in genesis chapter 28 beginning at verse
[30:37] 10 the bible says
[30:39] and jacob went out from beer sheba and
[30:41] went toward haran
[30:43] and he lighted upon a certain place
[30:47] amen and tarried there all night because
[30:50] the sun was set
[30:51] and he took of the stones of that place
[30:55] and put them for his pillows and lay
[30:57] down in that place to sleep
[30:59] and he dreamed and behold a ladder set
[31:01] up on the earth
[31:02] and the top of it reached to heaven and
[31:04] behold the angels of god

[34:39] god doesn't begin something to abandon
[34:42] it along the way
[34:43] the bible says he that hath begun a good
[34:45] work in you
[34:46] will be faithful to perform it until the
[34:49] day

[35:00] part of this as the apostle paul was
[35:03] we are as much a part of this as every
[35:05] disciple

[35:09] character we read them in the scripture

[35:41] to make me what i ought to be amen
[35:45] until i have done that which i have
[35:47] spoken to the of
[35:50] and jacob awakened out of his sleep
[35:54] and said surely the lord is in
[35:57] this place
[36:01] and i knew it not amen
[36:04] i just thought this was another stopover
[36:07] i thought this was just another pile of
[36:09] rocks
[36:10] i thought this was just another place
[36:12] amen another circumstance
[36:15] another child amen he says
[36:18] surely the lord is in this place
[36:22] and i knew it not and he was afraid and
[36:25] said how dreadful is this place
[36:28] this is none other but the house of god
[36:32] and this is the gate of heaven
[36:35] amen so this place tonight
[36:38] it became hallowed because it marked the
[36:42] spot where god met
[36:43] jacob and began to reveal his promise to
[36:47] him
[36:48] and his will for jacob's life
[36:52] there were other places that were
[36:54] special there was a place called manoham
[36:56] spoken of in genesis 32 where the angels
[37:00] of god
[37:00] met him there was a place where he
[37:03] wrestled
[37:04] with the angel all night and received a
[37:08] blessing
[37:08] and a name change but bethel
[37:11] was a place and god said i'm going to
[37:14] bring you back
[37:16] to this place
[37:19] amen it doesn't have to be a one-time
[37:22] experience
[37:24] you can be brought back to that original
[37:28] experience
[37:29] you can be brought back to that original
[37:32] visitation
[37:34] amen you might say in your mind tonight
[37:36] oh you might remember
[37:38] how wonderful your fellowship with the
[37:41] lord
[37:41] and the communion with the lord used to
[37:43] be
[37:45] well i want to tell you that doesn't
[37:46] just have to be a memory
[37:48] but we're serving a god tonight who can
[37:51] bring you
[37:52] right back to that same place
[37:56] hallelujah where your youth can be
[37:58] renewed
[37:59] as the eagles and everything that god
[38:03] ever was
[38:04] he can be to you again in an even
[38:07] newer and greater and more powerful way
[38:11] hallelujah amen i want to tell you the
[38:15] christian journey
[38:16] doesn't start on the mountaintop and
[38:18] gradually diminish over the
[38:20] over the course of your journey amen
[38:22] it's not all mountaintops
[38:25] there are mountains and valleys and
[38:27] mountains
[38:28] and valleys and mountaintops
[38:31] amen but i want to tell you amen you
[38:34] don't go through a valley to stay in the
[38:36] valley
[38:37] when you're in the valley you're just
[38:39] changing mountaintops
[38:40] [Applause]
[38:42] you're just headed for another climax
[38:45] you're headed for another height
[38:46] amen and your relationship with the lord
[38:49] will be growing
[38:50] stronger amen
[38:53] will you get on that next mountaintop
[38:56] you might say i'm just as
[38:58] high now in altitude as i was on that
[39:00] mountaintop
[39:02] but because of the things i experienced
[39:05] in that valley and because
[39:08] god revealed himself to me the way he
[39:12] did
[39:12] in that valley my faith now
[39:17] hallelujah hallelujah
[39:21] i have muscles now i have
[39:25] strength now i trust god
[39:29] in a way now where i knitted in
[39:32] hallelujah when i was on that
[39:36] mountaintop
[39:36] i didn't know god the way i'm known now
[39:40] when i was on that mountaintop i still
[39:43] had some immaturity
[39:44] i still had some selfishness i still had
[39:47] a lack of trust
[39:49] or lack of confidence but now amen i'm
[39:52] stronger because of that valley
[39:57] amen there were other places but bethel
[40:01] was a place where he would one day
[40:03] return
[40:04] he would build an altar again and he
[40:07] would renew
[40:08] his dedication and his devotion to god
[40:12] sometimes i think it's good for us to
[40:15] revisit the places
[40:17] where god first met us i don't think you
[40:20] should ever forget
[40:23] that first great experience you had with
[40:25] the lord
[40:26] amen don't ever let that sit from your
[40:28] memory amen
[40:30] because it might be good for you to go
[40:32] back and visit that place
[40:34] and be renewed amen it's good to
[40:37] to remember where god first met us and
[40:39] we we laid aside our burdens and
[40:42] our weight of sin we started a new
[40:44] journey
[40:45] and enjoyed the newness of fellowship
[40:47] with him
[40:48] even sometimes we need to revisit the
[40:51] places where god's promise was revealed
[40:53] to us
[40:54] and we knew his will for our lives
[40:57] we tend to drift we tend to lose sight
[41:00] of what we once held true and we need to
[41:04] be taken back and reminded
[41:06] of his unchanging will i know that's
[41:09] something that encourages me you know
[41:11] you go through things
[41:12] and you think lord why am i here
[41:15] and why have i been here for all of this
[41:18] time
[41:19] amen but then you can go back a little
[41:21] farther and you realize how you even got
[41:23] there
[41:24] was the hand of the lord and i began to
[41:27] think lord how you provide it
[41:29] and lord how you open the door and lord
[41:32] how you
[41:33] just at the right moment just at the
[41:35] right time exactly what i needed and say
[41:38] lord i'm sorry
[41:39] i'm sorry i question i know i'm exactly
[41:42] where you would have me to be
[41:44] and this is only a stepping stone to
[41:47] another place
[41:49] amen a place where you are taking me oh
[41:52] my brother benham
[41:53] and we know in the scriptures the word
[41:54] of god talks about the outer court
[41:57] the holy place and the holiest of holies
[42:01] the prophet of god says into this holy
[42:04] place aaron went
[42:05] once a year the congregation watched him
[42:08] he was dressed right
[42:10] he had to be anointed right he had to
[42:12] walk right blessed be the lord
[42:15] dressed right walked right anointed
[42:16] right he had a bell and a pomegranate on
[42:19] his garment
[42:20] and as he walked they played holy holy
[42:22] holy and to the lord
[42:24] he taken before him a charge of blood
[42:27] the blood of the lamb the blood of the
[42:29] atonement
[42:29] and he was anointed with the rose of
[42:31] sharon an anointing run off his beard
[42:34] plum to the hymns of his skirt
[42:36] and he was walking into the inner veil
[42:41] into the presence of god
[42:44] amen it was a place it was an anointed
[42:48] place it was a divine
[42:49] place amen where once a year aaron would
[42:52] go
[42:54] to present the atonement and brother
[42:56] brown says and when he went behind there
[42:58] the veil fell behind him and he was shut
[43:02] out
[43:03] he was hid from the outer
[43:07] world oh my
[43:11] he was hid from the outer world
[43:16] in the old testament there was a yearly
[43:18] entrance by the high priest
[43:20] and to the holiest of holies where he
[43:22] would enter the veil
[43:24] leave the world behind to stand in the
[43:26] shekinah glory of god
[43:28] in the life giving presence of jehovah
[43:32] amen this was once an exclusive
[43:36] privilege to a sanctified high priest
[43:40] but calvary opened the way
[43:44] opened the way for every true believer
[43:48] washed in the blood of the lamb
[43:51] to enter into that same place
[43:56] you can now experience the same
[44:00] blessing that the high priest once
[44:02] experienced
[44:03] amen you don't have to read about what
[44:06] aaron experienced
[44:07] and say i wonder what that could be like
[44:11] oh no friend amen that privilege amen
[44:15] is not prohibited from the overcomer
[44:19] or from the true believer now but
[44:22] paul picks it up in hebrews chapter 10
[44:25] and he says in verse 15
[44:27] whereof the holy ghost it also is a
[44:30] witness
[44:30] to us for after that he had said before
[44:34] this is the covenant that i will make
[44:36] with them after those days saith the
[44:38] lord
[44:38] i will put my laws into their hearts and
[44:41] in their minds will i write them
[44:43] and their sins and iniquities will i
[44:46] remember no more
[44:48] now where remission of these is there is
[44:50] no more offering for sin
[44:53] having therefore brethren boldness
[44:57] to enter into the holiest
[45:00] by the blood of jesus by a new
[45:04] and living way which he hath consecrated
[45:08] for us through the veil that is to save
[45:11] his flesh
[45:13] and having an high priest over
[45:16] the house of god let
[45:19] us draw near with a true heart
[45:23] in full full
[45:27] assurance of faith
[45:30] having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[45:32] conscience
[45:33] and our bodies washed with pure water
[45:38] amen this is for every son and daughter
[45:41] of god
[45:42] we have a high priest that can be
[45:45] touched
[45:46] by the feeling of our infirmities amen
[45:49] oh if the devil is battling your mind
[45:51] tonight
[45:52] battling your body he's battling your
[45:54] conscience
[45:55] you've got this on your record you've
[45:57] got this in your past
[45:59] you've got this hanging on you amen you
[46:01] have a high priest
[46:03] which can be touched by the feeling of
[46:05] your infirmities
[46:06] amen take whatever that is amen and
[46:09] present it to the high priest
[46:12] lord i'm in need of healing lord i'm in
[46:14] need of deliverance
[46:15] lord i'm in need of a re-feeling and
[46:18] lord i'm in need of
[46:20] joy of peace amen whatever you need is
[46:23] confess it
[46:24] to your high priest amen
[46:27] and then go into the holiest of holies
[46:30] he said let us hold fast the profession
[46:34] of our faith
[46:36] without wavering don't give up now
[46:39] brother sister
[46:41] don't back up now hold fast
[46:44] the profession of your faith
[46:48] amen i believe god is coming back for
[46:50] people that are convinced
[46:52] god is coming back for people that are
[46:54] certain
[46:55] what he has done in this day in this
[46:57] hour amen and they're not wavering
[46:59] they're not wondering they're not
[47:01] questioning they're not backing up
[47:03] they're not apologizing they're not
[47:05] putting anything on the shelf amen
[47:08] hallelujah but they're standing on it
[47:12] let us hold past the profession of our
[47:15] faith
[47:15] without wavering for he has faithful
[47:18] that promise
[47:20] he is faithful that promise
[47:24] you didn't make the promise you're just
[47:27] standing on the promise
[47:30] and the reason you can be faithful is
[47:32] because you know
[47:33] he cannot be unfaithful
[47:37] he cannot say something and then retract
[47:42] he cannot retract his statement
[47:45] god doesn't change his mind about his
[47:48] word
[47:49] so we're standing amen on an unwavering
[47:52] word
[47:53] amen it's uncompromising it's
[47:55] unrelenting and it's unchanging amen
[47:59] he is faithful that promise and let us
[48:03] consider one another
[48:04] to provoke and to love into good works
[48:08] not forsaking the assembling of
[48:10] ourselves together
[48:11] as the manner of some is but exhorting
[48:14] one another
[48:15] and so much the more as you see the day
[48:18] approaching
[48:20] the prophet of god says this there is a
[48:22] hiding place
[48:24] abiding place that we can walk
[48:27] in the presence of god and be hid
[48:31] from the things of this world you don't
[48:34] hear them no more
[48:36] it's sound proof hallelujah sound proof
[48:39] the world is on the outside gasping and
[48:42] looking
[48:43] but you're on the inside in the presence
[48:46] of the
[48:47] eternal everlasting god
[48:50] eating from this manna
[48:54] eating from this manna
[48:58] that will last for spans of years
[49:00] hundreds of years
[49:02] it never contaminated neither did it
[49:05] give out
[49:07] i remember years ago being uh in in a
[49:10] certain
[49:11] church and under a ministry and they
[49:13] were making fun of the holy ghost
[49:16] they were blaspheming the holy ghost and
[49:18] they were saying the holy ghost
[49:20] is is like the manna that fell in israel
[49:23] and it grew still and grew wiggle tails
[49:28] overnight so it had to fall fresh every
[49:30] day and they said the holy ghost
[49:31] is something from an age gone by and
[49:34] it's grown stella and has wiggletales in
[49:36] it
[49:37] and i said but wait a minute that manna
[49:41] that was in the holiest of holies was
[49:44] different
[49:47] it was preserved for years
[49:50] for decades and for centuries
[49:54] why because it was in the holiest of
[49:58] holies
[49:59] and every high priest had the privilege
[50:03] of going in there
[50:04] every year and partaking of the same
[50:07] manner that moses and aaron
[50:11] and the grandfather and the father and
[50:14] this one
[50:14] and this one and this one hallelujah
[50:19] so if you think the man has grown still
[50:23] you're just eating it in the wrong place
[50:25] because when you get into the holiest of
[50:28] holies brother
[50:29] amen it's the same manner
[50:35] amen hallelujah
[50:39] hallelujah amen it doesn't get old
[50:43] it doesn't get old it doesn't lose its
[50:45] strength
[50:46] it doesn't lose its value but this is
[50:49] the same manner
[50:51] that peter and paul this is the same
[50:54] matter that the old
[50:55] uh the the original church this is the
[50:58] same manner that the martyrs ate
[51:01] this is the same manner that the prophet
[51:03] protocol
[51:04] amen the manna won't grow stale
[51:08] if you'll stay in the holiest divorce
[51:13] oh my it cannot grow still
[51:17] unless you leave the holiest of holiness
[51:22] amen and if you leave that presence
[51:25] all of a sudden the message won't be
[51:27] enough for you
[51:29] the bible won't be enough for you you'll
[51:32] be going for this man's idea
[51:34] and this man's interpretation and we're
[51:36] going out searching
[51:37] and we're going out searching why
[51:39] because you're not satisfied
[51:41] but as long as you stay in the holiest
[51:43] of holy
[51:44] everything you have need of
[51:48] and the true believer will be satisfied
[51:55] amen there's no criticism
[51:58] in the holiest of holies there's no
[52:00] internet
[52:01] in the holiest of holies there's no
[52:03] man's opinion
[52:05] and the holiest of holies there is god
[52:08] in god alone
[52:11] amen
[52:16] eating from this manner that will last
[52:18] for spans of years hundreds of years
[52:20] it never contaminated neither did it
[52:24] give out
[52:25] and man that walks into god and the veil
[52:28] drops behind him shutting off the things
[52:30] of the world
[52:31] he's in the presence of god eating the
[52:35] manna
[52:36] no wonder 12 o'clock
[52:39] nine o'clock late or anything
[52:42] he is living in the presence of the king
[52:46] amen no matter no wonder every day is
[52:50] fine for him he knows where he is at
[52:54] he has found the secret place he has
[52:58] went behind the veil
[52:59] the doors is closed behind him he don't
[53:02] see
[53:02] nothing of the world them doors was made
[53:05] soundproof by sheepskin and goatskin
[53:09] and this is made soundproof by the
[53:11] baptism of the holy spirit
[53:14] that hides a man in christ there he
[53:17] becomes a new creature
[53:18] and he walks daily before him in this
[53:20] manner
[53:21] what a beautiful picture of the believer
[53:25] in the presence of god all
[53:28] things are his dead
[53:32] oh my brother sister when the high
[53:34] priest went behind
[53:35] the holiest of holies he did not have to
[53:38] ask
[53:40] permission everything
[53:43] was available for his consumption
[53:47] for his protection he even put an old
[53:50] dead dried almond rod there
[53:54] that had been cut down stripped and for
[53:57] years had bore
[53:58] nothing but when that almond rod
[54:01] came into that presence of the shekinah
[54:04] glory
[54:06] it did the things it once did
[54:11] it branched forth and butted forth with
[54:14] the same life
[54:16] that it once did brother that's the
[54:19] difference
[54:20] amen when you get into god's presence
[54:22] amen you will experience the things
[54:24] you once did amen the life will come
[54:27] forth again
[54:28] amen there won't be some grafted affair
[54:31] it won't be something taped on or glued
[54:33] on or stuck on
[54:34] but it'll be something birthed forth
[54:36] from the inside amen
[54:38] because the life-giving presence of the
[54:40] shekinah glory
[54:42] amen has brought you back to original
[54:45] manifestation of the original
[54:48] life that was in you all the time
[54:52] that presence did not make that almond
[54:54] rod into some other nut
[54:56] or some other fruit but that presence
[54:59] vindicated
[55:00] what the original life was
[55:05] man you could have painted anything
[55:08] you could have put anything you could
[55:10] have put any identification on that
[55:12] almond rod you wanted to
[55:13] but when it got back in that presence it
[55:16] proved
[55:17] what it was by the life that it bore
[55:19] forth
[55:20] [Music]
[55:21] oh my friend that's what we need tonight
[55:25] that's what we need tonight church
[55:27] theology won't do that
[55:29] man's personality won't do that church
[55:32] systems won't do that
[55:33] but the shekinah glory can amen
[55:38] what a beautiful picture of the believer
[55:40] in the presence of god
[55:42] all things are his dead
[55:46] amen my friend when you
[55:49] when your faith is so stimulated you
[55:52] won't have to beg god for your healing
[55:54] you won't have to plead with god for
[55:56] your promises
[55:58] you recognize that's my promise that's
[56:02] my healing
[56:03] that's my inheritance amen
[56:07] joshua and caleb weren't fussing about
[56:08] what their portion in the promised land
[56:10] was
[56:11] they knew what their portion was amen
[56:14] and they were there to tell the
[56:15] canaanites
[56:16] you never owned this in the first place
[56:19] this was mine all along amen
[56:22] you've been a temporary inhabitant of
[56:25] something that i've got a deed to
[56:27] amend because god gave this to my father
[56:29] abraham
[56:31] i'm not here taking something from the
[56:33] devil that whatever was his
[56:36] i'm taking back what was mine all along
[56:39] [Laughter]
[56:41] this was mine all along how will you
[56:44] have faith for a glorified body
[56:47] because a prophet came to say a
[56:48] theophany was what you bypassed
[56:52] but it was yours all along
[56:55] amen the faith of the promise has come
[56:58] in this hour even to tell the sons and
[57:00] daughters of abraham
[57:02] what has been ours all along
[57:05] so we walk into it by faith claim it
[57:08] put your stand right there amen i'm not
[57:10] moving i'm not budging
[57:12] this is mine because god gave it to me
[57:16] amen i'm not backing up amen all things
[57:19] are his then
[57:20] all things was given to christ all that
[57:22] god was he poured into christ
[57:24] all christ was poured into the church
[57:27] that day you'll know that i am in the
[57:29] father
[57:29] and the father in me and i in you
[57:33] all the privilege that the believer has
[57:36] if they can only accept it
[57:40] i was some months ago i was flying
[57:44] on an airplane and in these uh
[57:46] commercial airlines they
[57:48] have in the seat back pocket a magazine
[57:52] that the the carrier whether it's delta
[57:54] or american or united
[57:56] they all have their own magazine and so
[57:58] i i pulled this
[58:00] magazine out and i was looking through
[58:01] it and i saw an article there
[58:04] that caught my attention it was written
[58:07] by one of the
[58:08] executives of the airline
[58:11] and the the the title of his of his uh
[58:15] editorial there the the article that he
[58:17] had written was
[58:18] from adot to a destination
[58:24] from a dot to a destination
[58:28] and he began to describe that his role
[58:31] as an
[58:32] executive for that airline was to go
[58:35] into a city
[58:37] or a town that they currently did not
[58:40] offer flights
[58:41] into or service into that area but he
[58:44] would begin looking around that
[58:45] city he looked at the you know the
[58:47] economy and and the
[58:49] maybe the restaurants and the hotels and
[58:51] the entertainment and
[58:52] and all of these of these different
[58:54] factors
[58:55] he would be taking these things into
[58:57] consideration
[58:59] and if everything looked like that would
[59:01] be a good
[59:02] future destination he would take his
[59:05] report back
[59:07] and eventually this little town that was
[59:10] once just
[59:11] a dot would become
[59:15] a destination of that airline
[59:18] and they would begin flying their
[59:20] customers into this city and those
[59:22] customers go and they stay in their
[59:23] hotels
[59:24] and they eat in their restaurants and
[59:26] they begin meeting business owners and
[59:28] they begin growing
[59:29] and developing the economy of that city
[59:32] why because one person
[59:36] saw worth and sold value
[59:40] in this little city
[59:44] oh my and i saw that in my mind begin
[59:47] thinking
[59:49] from a dot to a destination
[59:53] i was thinking about a little dot a
[59:56] little
[59:56] 16 year old girl by the name of mary
[1:00:00] who was walking to the well one day and
[1:00:03] she was just
[1:00:04] another little girl like every other
[1:00:06] teenager in her
[1:00:07] city amen just trying to serve the lord
[1:00:10] and be
[1:00:11] faithful amen hold true to god's word
[1:00:14] but god spoke to that little dot and
[1:00:17] said mary
[1:00:19] thou art highly favored
[1:00:22] among women you're not just any virgin
[1:00:26] you're not just any young girl amen
[1:00:28] you're not just here drifting along
[1:00:31] and floating along but you are the
[1:00:33] object
[1:00:34] of a promise there is a prophecy
[1:00:38] that is pertaining to your life and the
[1:00:41] purpose of the angel was there to
[1:00:44] connect
[1:00:45] her as an individual with god's promise
[1:00:51] oh my was there amen to to to begin to
[1:00:55] minister to her faith
[1:00:57] you've heard it preached you've heard it
[1:01:00] read
[1:01:01] you've heard it quoted you've heard it
[1:01:03] pondered
[1:01:04] you've heard it debated you've heard it
[1:01:07] argued
[1:01:08] but now you are going to experience
[1:01:14] and now it's not going to be just a
[1:01:16] story
[1:01:17] now it's not going to be just a mystery
[1:01:20] now
[1:01:20] it's not going to be just the words of a
[1:01:22] man
[1:01:23] or the words of a prophet but the angel
[1:01:26] came to connect her
[1:01:28] with that promise and say mary this is
[1:01:31] you
[1:01:33] you hallelujah you are the destination
[1:01:38] that god is going to kindly send
[1:01:42] from glory and wrap himself in a blood
[1:01:46] cell
[1:01:46] and an embryo and god is going to
[1:01:49] deposit
[1:01:50] a part of himself in you
[1:01:53] and the fullness of god will be burst
[1:01:57] forth from your womb
[1:02:01] oh my from a dot
[1:02:04] to a destination the prophet of god says
[1:02:08] this
[1:02:08] in the church ages books his outstanding
[1:02:10] statement
[1:02:11] he said he fulfilled at that time
[1:02:16] all that was written of him
[1:02:19] because she accepted
[1:02:23] his word to her
[1:02:27] amen he manifesting
[1:02:30] his life his glory think about it every
[1:02:33] miracle
[1:02:35] every healing every dead child that was
[1:02:37] raised
[1:02:38] every great thing that he performed on
[1:02:40] this earth was possible
[1:02:42] because she accepted amen his word to
[1:02:46] her be it unto me
[1:02:50] according to thy word behold
[1:02:53] the headmate of the lord she didn't
[1:02:56] understand it
[1:02:57] any more than any other girl she didn't
[1:02:59] understand it any more than the priest
[1:03:03] or any other a religious leader but she
[1:03:06] became
[1:03:07] the recipient of it and she received the
[1:03:10] promise by
[1:03:11] faith and it birthed itself
[1:03:14] forth from her
[1:03:19] god made bethlehem a dot
[1:03:23] god made that little insignificant city
[1:03:27] a dot oh bethlehem though thou be little
[1:03:33] that's what qualifies you
[1:03:36] oh my because you've been overlooked
[1:03:42] because you've been passed over and then
[1:03:45] because
[1:03:46] others considered you to be ineligible
[1:03:49] or unworthy or incapable
[1:03:52] you were little oh among
[1:03:56] thousands amen there were many
[1:03:59] more deserving there was many more
[1:04:02] worthy
[1:04:02] there was many more capable and more
[1:04:05] qualified
[1:04:06] but there was only one that was chosen
[1:04:10] because you are chosen amen you will be
[1:04:13] given an
[1:04:14] age amen you will be given a reputation
[1:04:17] you will be given a standing immovable
[1:04:21] uh unforgettable amen god

[1:04:30] amen oh if we if we just uh just
[1:04:33] bear with me for a moment as i go that
[1:04:36] and go
[1:04:36] over that again in the scripture in
[1:04:39] genesis
[1:04:40] uh chapter 10 there is jacob continued
[1:04:43] pardon me just a moment i have to find
[1:04:45] it
[1:04:46] amen i appreciate this
[1:04:49] wonderful pull tonight
[1:04:53] praise the lord oh my jacob rose up
[1:04:56] early in the morning verse 18 and took
[1:04:57] the stone that he put for his pillows
[1:05:00] and set it up for a pillar and poured
[1:05:03] oil
[1:05:04] upon the top of it amen he said i'm
[1:05:08] going to make a memorial here i'm not
[1:05:10] going to let this slip
[1:05:12] i'm not going to let this pass these
[1:05:15] aren't ordinary stones any longer
[1:05:18] amen something happened here he took
[1:05:21] those stones and he
[1:05:22] he made an altar he set it up for a
[1:05:24] pillar and poured
[1:05:25] all upon the top of it verse 19 and he
[1:05:29] called the name of that place
[1:05:30] bethel but the name of that city
[1:05:34] was called luds at the first
[1:05:39] but it got a new name it got a new
[1:05:42] identification
[1:05:45] you know who ever heard of luz who
[1:05:48] if i hadn't read that who would have
[1:05:50] ever heard of lust but we've all heard
[1:05:51] of bethel
[1:05:53] and we've all heard of bethlehem
[1:05:57] when god visits you it erases the old
[1:05:59] identity
[1:06:02] it erases the past that old man that a
[1:06:06] woman who ever heard of them
[1:06:08] who ever heard of him who ever heard of
[1:06:11] her
[1:06:11] amen i've got a new identity because of
[1:06:14] an experience
[1:06:16] that god gave to me amen and everyone
[1:06:19] has heard of the glory
[1:06:20] that took place in a place called bethel
[1:06:24] oh my he gave it a new name
[1:06:27] he gave it a new identification because
[1:06:30] he said the old one doesn't fit
[1:06:33] the old one doesn't worry amen that's
[1:06:36] going to be revealed
[1:06:37] through this one amen
[1:06:42] hallelujah jerusalem has the glory but
[1:06:45] it's not like bethlehem
[1:06:47] amen these other cities these other
[1:06:51] places
[1:06:51] have a glory but not like bethlehem
[1:06:54] because bethlehem
[1:06:56] is where it began at bethlehem
[1:06:59] is where there was a little stable and a
[1:07:02] manger
[1:07:03] and an innkeeper that couldn't make room
[1:07:06] in a regular room
[1:07:07] but there in a cave amongst the animals
[1:07:10] in a manger of hay
[1:07:12] bethlehem bethlehem
[1:07:16] was where god took his first breath
[1:07:20] as a human being
[1:07:23] glory to god hallelujah bethlehem
[1:07:29] is where the lamb slain before the
[1:07:32] foundation of the world
[1:07:34] made his entrance to buy back
[1:07:37] the earth and the sons and daughters of
[1:07:41] god
[1:07:42] that have been lost in the garden of
[1:07:44] eden
[1:07:45] eden will always be known for the fall
[1:07:48] that took place there but bethlehem
[1:07:53] glory to god
[1:07:58] [Music]
[1:07:59] amen hallelujah
[1:08:02] eden will be known for the sin that was
[1:08:05] committed there
[1:08:07] but bethlehem will be known as the place
[1:08:10] where the solution
[1:08:12] was born where the atonement was born
[1:08:16] where for the first time god
[1:08:19] jehovah took a breath and his voice
[1:08:24] cried forth like a little baby
[1:08:28] oh my i wonder if satan trembled
[1:08:32] when the little lord jesus cried his
[1:08:34] first cry
[1:08:36] i wonder if satan realized every time
[1:08:39] he opens his mouth is trouble
[1:08:45] every time he opens his mouth
[1:08:48] it's victory it's power
[1:08:52] it's resurrection it's healing
[1:08:55] it's life amen
[1:08:58] every breath he breathes every drop of
[1:09:02] blood that comes forth from his body
[1:09:04] every step he takes every direction
[1:09:08] he looks even when the sick
[1:09:11] touch the hem of his garments
[1:09:15] there will be a change there will be a
[1:09:18] transformation
[1:09:21] and bethlehem was the place
[1:09:25] that he chose and jacob bowed about
[1:09:29] saying
[1:09:30] if god will be with me and will keep
[1:09:34] me in this way that i go and will give
[1:09:37] me bread to eat
[1:09:38] and raiment to put on so that i come
[1:09:42] again to my father's house in peace
[1:09:46] then shall the lord be my god
[1:09:49] and this stone which i have set for a
[1:09:52] pillar
[1:09:53] shall be god's house
[1:09:55] [Music]
[1:09:58] and of all that thou shalt give me will
[1:10:00] i surely give the tenth
[1:10:03] unto thee this vision
[1:10:06] this experience at bethlehem turned
[1:10:09] jacob into a permanent tithe fair
[1:10:15] and he said i'm not i'm not giving god
[1:10:17] what's mine
[1:10:19] i'm giving god back what was his all the
[1:10:21] time
[1:10:25] that's right you see brother sister when
[1:10:28] you have met god face to face
[1:10:30] serving god won't be a chore it won't be
[1:10:33] a drag it won't be a burden
[1:10:36] when you have really met god out of a
[1:10:38] willing heart
[1:10:40] amen with no coercion with no pulling
[1:10:44] with no persuasion amen he says
[1:10:47] i will surely give the tips unto thee
[1:10:52] rocks became a stone which became a
[1:10:56] pillar
[1:10:58] which he said will become god's house
[1:11:02] and i'm just thinking about another
[1:11:05] another disciple
[1:11:07] whose name was peter
[1:11:14] and he could not read he could not write
[1:11:19] he had he did not come from a family of
[1:11:21] wealth
[1:11:22] he did not come from some great
[1:11:25] illustrious
[1:11:26] uh you know dignitary or royalty or
[1:11:30] some blue blood pedigreed man he was a
[1:11:33] fisherman that was illiterate
[1:11:39] oh he was a dot
[1:11:43] oh my but one day
[1:11:46] jesus asked his disciples whom do men
[1:11:49] say that i am
[1:11:50] well jesus some say
[1:11:54] you're this some say you're
[1:11:57] john the baptist some say you're elias
[1:12:00] some say you're one of the prophets but
[1:12:03] then jesus brought the question more
[1:12:05] personal
[1:12:06] because jesus really is not interested
[1:12:09] in what everybody else
[1:12:14] he said who do you say
[1:12:18] that i am and a man
[1:12:22] that could never say anything right
[1:12:24] almost
[1:12:25] every time he spoke jesus had to
[1:12:27] apologize
[1:12:29] or correct him or come back and clear up
[1:12:31] the question amen
[1:12:33] but this time it wasn't peter speaking
[1:12:37] it was a stone speaking
[1:12:40] amen this time
[1:12:43] it wasn't a man speaking it was a
[1:12:46] deposit
[1:12:48] that jehovah god had placed there
[1:12:51] before the foundation of the world
[1:12:54] hey amen hallelujah
[1:12:58] and when that representation begins to
[1:13:01] speak
[1:13:02] it won't put god off in some other day
[1:13:05] it won't deny the present
[1:13:08] day manifestation of the revealed word
[1:13:12] of the hour amen peter wasn't caring
[1:13:16] about what the newspaper
[1:13:18] said what the internet said what the
[1:13:21] scribe
[1:13:21] said or what the pharisee said when the
[1:13:24] rock spoke
[1:13:27] when the stones spake amen he said thou
[1:13:31] art the christ the son
[1:13:34] of the living god amen
[1:13:38] oh my and when revelation spoke
[1:13:43] revelation answered he said
[1:13:46] and thou art peter
[1:13:50] and upon this rock i'll build my church
[1:13:55] you're going to become my house you're
[1:13:58] going to become
[1:13:58] my destination amen
[1:14:02] oh my i'm not only going to make you a
[1:14:05] destination
[1:14:06] i'm going to make you the spokesperson
[1:14:09] of the church
[1:14:10] i'm going to give you the keys to the
[1:14:12] kingdom whatsoever you bind on earth
[1:14:14] abind in heaven whatsoever you loose on
[1:14:17] earth i'll loose in heaven
[1:14:19] amen jesus knew there's something there
[1:14:24] peter went on and said other things he
[1:14:27] said i don't know him
[1:14:28] i deny him but it didn't dislodge
[1:14:33] the stone
[1:14:38] peter cursed but it did not
[1:14:41] dislodge the deposit
[1:14:46] oh my all
[1:14:49] that the father has given me will
[1:14:53] come to me and no man
[1:14:56] amen hallelujah
[1:15:01] jesus never disowned peter he never
[1:15:04] stripped away his disciple
[1:15:06] qualities he never removed them from his
[1:15:09] administration
[1:15:10] he just said tarry ye in jerusalem
[1:15:14] until you be endued with power from on
[1:15:16] high
[1:15:17] because when i come back in the form of
[1:15:21] the holy ghost
[1:15:23] i will be in you i'm going to enter into
[1:15:27] that temple
[1:15:28] i'm going to enter into the holiest of
[1:15:30] holies and my shekinah glory
[1:15:33] is going to begin to radiate forth where
[1:15:36] peter
[1:15:36] will not even speak his own thoughts any
[1:15:38] longer
[1:15:39] [Music]
[1:15:41] amen hallelujah
[1:15:45] i feel good tonight brother sister
[1:15:48] amen you're not gonna dislodge
[1:15:52] you're not gonna dislodge that stone
[1:15:55] your mistakes won't dislodge it you're
[1:15:58] backsliding on this logic
[1:15:59] what somebody else says won't dislodge
[1:16:02] it
