we have here this afternoon amen amen if there was just two or three of us here tonight all things are possible amen but looking around tonight there's more than two or three here there's a whole house full of Believers and amen I believe that when Believers get together something good always happens amen I believe the miraculous comes into action the god of paradox comes on the scene and amen he does only what he can do amen and I'm sure glad tonight to be numbered among those who believe in him and the power of his resurrection amen we we want to say God bless you all this evening my such a wonderful atmosphere here in the house of God tonight and I believe the Lord is among us to do miraculous things for us and amen I know you've come here tonight with needs in different situations but maybe before we open the word we could just approach him for a moment maybe we just ask him to come and speak to us in a special way tonight I believe he's able to do it would you just join your faith with me tonight Heavenly Father Lord As We Gather here on this Wednesday afternoon father we're very well aware that we're not here in this building by ourselves Lord but father there's an unseen host of angelic beings that has lined the walls of this assembly father Lord we're not here as denominational-led people but father we're here as people that's been taught by a Vindicated prophet and he is declared in this generation that there would be an angel that would meet us and would escort us to the seat where we would even sit and Lord there would be there would be a great Warfare it would break out in the service between the power of God and the power of the enemy and Lord that the enemy would do everything he could to beset your word and to defeat your people from receiving that word but Lord your Prophet said that it only takes one to believe that word and every devil will be defeated so Lord I believe tonight that there's more than one here but Lord I believe there's a house full of Believers here Lord and I believe as we join our little Elixir fire together and Lord we make that one great Pillar of Fire come down Among Us Lord I believe sicknesses can be healed father diseases are already healed Lord I believe that Deliverance can take place I believe all things are possible tonight for Lord we've gathered here under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and father I pray Lord that you would drive out every Spirit of tiredness oh God or whatever spirit that we're trying to hinder your word from coming forth may you driving out of the building dear God and Lord may you bring a Unity of a liberty father or that your word could come forth now Lord we pray a special blessing upon our brother Steve and O God upon his family Lord upon this assembly father as he or have been raised up here as a lighthouse in this community for what you've done in this generation I pray Lord you would continue to bless them may you continue to give him courage and Grace to stand up on this word and we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we do pray and all the believer says a man and amen if you have your Bibles tonight we want to turn to the Book of John The Book of John the 12th chapter I have a couple places I want to read with you tonight but we'll begin here in the Book of John the 12th chapter and while you're turning there we do want to say God bless you all this evening God bless you brother Stephen we appreciate the invitation to come and the grace that the Lord has given us to be here tonight I I want to say it's always an honor to come this way and to speak to the people and be in service and I tell you I have to say you have a very gracious Pastor he's been going back and forth with me for a few months on dates and the Lord finally give us a Grace and made a way for us to be here tonight and we we sure appreciate that brother Steve and it's an honor to be here and we also glad to have our in-laws you're with us tonight and of course to have my wife with us and baby Malachi back there is growing up quickly on us so we're sure glad to have them and I tell you I ought to feel special tonight we've been on the road for about three weeks and I just got home Monday night and I figured I'd be at home resting this week but here she is on the road with us again so we're sure thankful to have her with us tonight and we just trust the Lord to speak to your heart tonight in the Book of John the 12th chapter and then the 23rd verse I know this is a very familiar reading to you the Bible said and Jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of a man should be glorified now brother Remus says that's the forming of the body of Jesus Christ and watch the 24th verse here's where he picks this up on the formation of the Bride verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit so the shuck pulls away to give the wheat a chance to ripen before the sun which the prophet said is the message coming right back into the church again forming the full body of Jesus Christ which is the perfect body to receive the perfect head except the corn of wheat die and fall on the ground and die at abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit now in the book of Colossians the first chapter those that you study the message I know you do this is Brother brahm's text and the powerful sermon he preaches on Christ is the mystery of God revealed and in Colossians 1 in verse 9 Paul here says for this calls we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that you might be filled somebody say field you might be filled with the knowledge of his will and all wisdom and spiritual understanding that ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work increasing in the knowledge of God strengthened with all my according to his glorious power unto all patients long-suffering with joyfulness giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son now I want to look one other place if that's okay in the book of Galatians the fourth chapter the book of Galatians the fourth chapter I believe we're speaking here tonight from the scriptures on the seed amen coming to the fullness and in Galatians 4 I love here what Paul says in verse number 19 Galatians 4 and 19 Paul says my little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you if you skip down to the 27th verse he says it is written Rejoice thou Barren that bearth not break forth and cry thou that traveleth not for the desolate hath many more children than she with hat which hath and husband now we Brethren as Isaac was now watch Paul connect us to Isaac we are a the children of promise but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now so the battle did not stop thousands of years ago but that battle has come right into this age where this flesh is persecuting the spirit but nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the bonds woman and her son which is Hagar and Ishmael for the bond for the son of the bonds woman shall not be Heir with the son of the free woman so then brethren we are not children of the bonds woman but of the free amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word is you can have your seats here this afternoon I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments if I could I want to speak to you on a thought here tonight if I title this I want to speak to you on worthy of the full promise worthy of the full promise you know I believe that here tonight I look around and before we go any further let's just all agree that we're humans We're Not Angels we'll never be angels we never were born we never were created never intended to be Angels amen we're humans now I realize that we're a twofold being there is a human element as well as there is an element of deity it's laying on the inside of every believer then as the as the human element is there every human struggles amen with the fact or with the thought of am I worthy am I am I worthy to be a part of this am I worthy to see what I'm seeing am I worthy to hear what I'm hearing amen we all go through that battle of shruggling with am I worthy but you know when you start hearing the prophet he'll say it like this in present stage of my Ministry he said there's a little row preaching down from the throne tonight and it's called the lifeline he said no while I'm praying I hope it drags by every unconverted person in here he said and won't you reach up and take a hold of it sinner friend you say well brother Branham you're getting old and I guess that's the reason he said no brother sister when I was a little boy I believe this I give my life for it and there's only one regret that I have that I haven't got but one life to give if I had Ten Thousand Lives I'd want to give them all for it yes sir won't you take a hold of that line when it passes by tonight your way and you say brother Branham I'm not worthy to take a hold of it I know you're not child amen but you've got to do something to get worthy and tell me what you've done he said I want to do it too there ain't nothing you can do to get worthy you was born unworthy there's only one thing you can do just take a hold of the way that's been made for you and meant you're drowning but you don't have to drown in that amen God has thrown out the lifeline let's reach and get it tonight amen well I got to do something to get worthy do you realize you cannot pray enough prayers you cannot give enough offerings you cannot attend enough Services that's right you cannot memorize enough quotes and scriptures Amen to bring yourself to a place of worthiness to receive amen what God has done for you and the age you're living but the prophet says amen it's not my worthiness that I'm standing here amen but I'm standing here to represent somebody who is worthy see amen I'm not worthy no one else is worthy amen but I'm only representing him who is worthy amen amen then there's not a preacher worthy enough to save you there's not a there's not a prophet worthy enough to save you but there is a God who is rich in Mercy amen and he is right here in this building tonight in the power of his resurrection declaring amen that you aren't worthy by the blood now I love another quote he says what am I trying to do I'm trying to show you amen that it's God's grace that made you worthy amen I'm trying to show you that it's God's grace made you worthy you're no good I'm no good but he is the one that's good amen so let's look to him and he's the one that did it amen that's the difference it's God's grace amen another place he said now we know that we are not worthy in ourselves amen none of us are but that we are not trusting in our own worthiness his worthiness that we have died to our own thinking and we just think his thoughts and live to everything amen that we believe he commands us to amen we die to our thoughts we die to our ideas and we live according to everything amen that God in his word has commanded us to now I love what Paul says here in Galatians 4 20 at 4 28 he said now we Brethren amen as Isaac was we are the children of promise now when you start looking at this in the Bible you will find amen that there are children of promise and there are children of God some places it's called Promise some places it's called children of God and in the New Testament when you study the children you will find amen that the Bible is referring to Israel amen who were the people of God Amen and they were especially dear to God now in the New Testament in Paul's writings we find out that the children of promise or the children of God Amen are all who are led by the spirit of God Amen and they are thus closely related to God so amen it's not that you're a million miles away from God trying to find an identity amen but by the spirit of God you've been made Sons and Daughters of God Amen and listen you're no longer just a seed of an Earthly father Amen in that product of an Earthly womb amen but you are the product of the predestination of almighty God in the age that you're living listen you all no there is a natural Israel right there's a natural Israel amen but then there's also a spiritual Israel now the prophet of God said we are Israelites now I know what you're thinking you're thinking how in the world am I an Israelite amen we are Israelites amen because we are the Seed of Abraham we are because we are the Seed of Abraham now I love what the prophet says that Israelite not that which is of the flesh amen but that which is of the spirit so we are a spiritual Israel amen not by the flesh but by the spirit prophet of God said now we are Abraham's seed if we are in Christ and then if you are Abraham's seed you have the same faith that Abraham had because it was the faith that we're talking about amen especially in the church now amen it's the Royal Seed of Abraham amen so we're not focusing so much on the natural seed amen but now we're looking at a spiritual seed which is a royal seed which is a super seed listen you come on church amen if the devil had his way he would tell you amen now let's go back to the Jewish race amen there was always a battle over who's worthy amen if you do this you're worthy if you do that you're worthy amen but when Jesus Christ the son of God God came on the scene he defeated the Jewish idea of doing something to get worthy and he grafted a branch in and he made you worthy by the death of his own son at the cross of Calvary listen amen oh God there is nothing we can do to get worthy amen but there is a super God who is a super race who is a super savior he's a super Redeemer he's a super healer he's a super deliver amen and he is our savior he is our healer he is not just the god of Abraham he is not just the god of Isaac he is the god of every King seed and is a part of him from before the foundation oh I'm not talking about a natural seed I'm talking about a royal seed and that seed is Christ then there were two seeds of Abraham right there were two seeds of Abraham one of them was natural Isaac amen but then the other one was Christ amen and Christ was the promise now watch a prophet so the Royal seed how much greater that would be than the natural Seed of Abraham you say I wish I was Isaac but how much greater is the Royal seed than the natural seed so if you are in Christ you have a super seed and you are super to what Abraham was because you come by the Royal seed that was Christ if you are dead in Christ then you're Abraham's children you have Abraham's seed Abraham's faith and Abraham's Faith was in God's word regardless of what the conditions was amen that's why the devil hates this seed it's because it's the seed of Christ which is the Royal Seed of Abraham and the same anointing that was upon Abraham to call things that were not as though they were is upon this seed and the same anointing that was upon Abraham to call things that were as though they were not is upon this seed listen Church you got to shake yourself and realize you're not a hybrid you're not a hot bed plan you're not a halfway church member you are the living breathing talking manifested seed of almighty God that is coming this age to whip a devil oh God hallelujah there's an anointing upon the Royal Seed of Abraham he has made you his seed that's why the Bible says amen amen we are a part of that Original Seed and then I'll come on some of y'all have been down but you got back up you've been through some stuff but you're still here do you know why because you're not a hybrid seed oh God when a hybrid seed goes down that seed is finished amen but if original seat goes down you can put it down but if a corn of wheat pie and it go into the ground it'll raise up a hundredfold and there's a bride here tonight who's not a hybrid church with a hybrid Faith with a hybrid religion but she is a literal spoken word she bride and it's been prophesied from the scriptures and the age that she's living she don't back up she don't turn around she don't lay down she don't quit she don't give in she don't compromise she don't doubt she stays with a word because all that was in God he is poured into Christ and all that is in Christ he has poured into his seed then there's an anointing resting upon this church that's why you're a church not of creed but it promises you're not a church of religion you are a church of promises come on now somebody say well brother Andrew I don't want to talk about the seed well if you don't want to talk about the seed then you don't want to talk about the promises because the promises are only made to the seat if there's not a seed then there's not a promise but if there's a seed then there's a promise and there's a seed to receive amen the Fulfillment of the promise come on church do you realize who you are you are the seed to receive the Fulfillment of every Divine promise that has been given to Abraham supersede the Royal seed unborn church we got more than just a promise to be saved we got more than just a promise to go to church we got the promise it's some morning our bodies are going to change we got to promise it some morning we're going to see dead loved ones appear we are not a hybrid seed We Are The Original Seed and thy seed thy seed thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies if there's no seed then there's no possession but if there is a seed then there is some gates to be possessed and you are the possessors of every gate of the enemy somebody's going to possess every Gate of Hell somebody's going to be sin guard somebody's going to be David somebody's going to be Samson somebody's going to manifest the sea life Oh Glory to God I'm talking about seed time I'm talking about literal spoken word seed my Bible said thy seed will be as the stars of the Heaven and the sand which is upon the shore thy seed shall possess amen they gave his enemies thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed when God has a seed there is a blessing upon that seed when God has a seed there is a promise resting listen can I say it this way your seed is Anointed by the promise of God the seed that's on the inside of you is Anointed by the promise of God probably God said God had been testing the patriarch because he had given him a promise how many knows that God gave Abraham a promise and now watch this and when God makes a promise he wants to be sure that the person is worthy of the promise so God does not make a promise unless the person receiving the promise is worthy of a promise before he fulfills what he said or what he promises listen church amen you know why the Baptist is not shouting about the opening the word because they're not a power to that seed that was to receive the Fulfillment of the book coming open in Revelation 5 but do you know why you're shouting about the mystery of the Rapture do you know why you're shouting about Seven Seals and seven Thunders and three pills and the Mystery of redemption is because you was the power of the seed of her Christ that was to arise in this generation come on you ought to put that devil under your foot you are worthy of the promise of God you are worthy of every Divine promise that God has made you all right God wouldn't make the promise God wouldn't make the promise unless there was somebody worthy to receive the Fulfillment of the promise that he made now you all know Abraham Abraham was 75 years old and Sarah was 65 years old and the prophet said they had test after test he said but then final test the final tests come to see how you react and when he gave Abraham the test he found Abraham just as true as he was when he started when God fulfilled the promise of Abraham receiving a son that through the seed he would bless the Nations come on 75 years later and Abraham was just as faithful as he was the day that he left the land of the Chaldeans to follow Jehovah oh god well I feel like preaching here amen and my Bible says amen now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and divine seed which is Christ now watch a prophet so it wouldn't be Abraham's Siege it was Abraham's seed one and that was Abraham's Faith seed that was pointing to the Royal seed to come through Abraham's faith not through Abraham's natural life but Abraham spiritual life amen why but would call anything contrary to God's word that's the real seed amen that we are speaking of the real seed we are speaking of is the seed that we'll call anything contrary to God's word wrong they will call anything contrary to God's infallible word error to stay with the word do you see what the prophet said he said there must come a loyal bride there must come a bride who will stay with the word now now when you start talking about this seed amen this Royal seed ride you've got to realize that there's only one alpha and there's only one Omega there's only one first and one last there's only one beginning and one ending there is only one he which was which he is and which shall be come on you know who I'm talking about it's none other than the Lord Jesus Christ but do you realize under the voice of the seventh angel he said there would be an alpha bride and an Omega bride he would say that the alpha has become the Omega then it's not to many churches or many seeds but there has been churches churches and there's been Brides brides but there has got to come one that's not only got the mechanics but she's got the Dynamics to make the church move and to live in the power of his resurrection as he be in the groom the bride has come forth as he be in the groom the bride has come forth because it's a part of him the Bride is a part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoken book of the Bride it can only manifest so the bride can only manifest the life of the seed that's only inside of her if it does something different from the groom then it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh she is born of his bone she is life of his life she is power of his power she is him see a man and a woman are one and woman taken from the side she has taken a spirit the feminist Spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and Dynamics the wife see the spirit of him and the Flesh of him have been put together and made mechanics and Dynamics somebody say well preacher we just want to be a mechanics church then you better start looking for tribulation because that's where you're headed well preacher we just want to be a Dynamics Church well you better start making preparation for the tribulation because that's where you're headed because if this bride does anything then what if it groomed us she is not the bride and this bride will not be just a mechanical bride and neither will she just be a dynamical bride but she will be made both the mechanics and the Dynamics in other words if he fired on 16 cylinders she's going to fire on 16 cylinders if he walked on the Promises she's going to walk in the promises if he walks in perfect Faith then she's going to walk in perfect faith if he walks in perfect love then she's going to walk in perfect love come on Church don't you let some devil reduce the power of the anointing in the Church of the Living God to some emotion or some sensation or some little funny feeling that went up your spine I'm talking about the same anointing that rest Jehovah of the old in Jesus of the new is resting upon this bride in the form of the word come on church I'm talking about the anointed Church of the Living God the anointed body will be both mechanics and Dynamics you know what she can do she can take everything the prophet said preach brother think I believe I will she can take everything the prophet said if he said she was the bride she can take it if he said she was justified she can take it if he said she never done it in the first place she can take it if he said I seen her getting out of line but I begin to scream brother Greg get back in Step then you are a part of that Omega bride that can receive prophetic correction and get back in step hallelujah we're not a bunch of church members we are the Bride of Jesus Christ manifesting manifesting everything he said we would be we are [Applause] that's the beauty of just saying what a prophet said that's the beauty of just preaching the message now that's the beauty of not taking part of it and leaving other parts that's the beauty of taking every part now can I preach brother Stephen can I take some Liberty some people want to just use certain ways brother random approach something and put some right in a bondage not to be fully who she was ordained to be [Applause] and I can I can prove it to you from the message because we got oh God I won't get in trouble we got people that want quiet Services they want quiet meetings they want quiet preaching so they'll get up and say if you're really anointed then you'll be like Jesus was in Luke the fourth chapter when the prophet said he picked up the scroll read what was wrote about him closed it sat down and he said precious words proceeded out of his mouth and the prophet said what is the anointing it's supreme power in control somebody somebody told me the other day they said if you really preach that then you'll act like that I said problem is brother I've preached that exact quote and been shouting down the middle of the church when I was preaching it so was I not anointed because I was not sitting was I not anointed no the prophet said anointing is supreme power in control well let's not just take one quote let's take another one where he says what is the anointing he said the anointing is the joy of the Lord some of you all come in this service tonight some of you all come in this service and you was burdened down you had a heaviness upon you you couldn't raise your hands you couldn't sing brother Stephen said you got to get free to receive the word and so they begin to sing and as the songs of Zion begin to Be Sung there was an anointing dropped in the building and the spirit of heaviness was ripped off of your life and you was able to receive a joy that maybe you hadn't felt since Sunday I'm talking about the anointed bride of Jesus Christ that knows how to be in control as well to have joy unspeakable and full of Glory I want to put that devil on notice you ain't gonna take my shouts you ain't gonna take my dance you ain't gonna take my victory I have been liberated and because of the anointing the Yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing the Yoke shall be destroyed [Applause] I say let the anointing fall let the anointing come in the church and Liberate the children of God [Applause] what is this anointing doing it's liberating you it's bringing you to the full promise now you say preacher you're getting out there am I really properly God said we can do two things he said we can bow our heads and open our hearts we can bow our heads and open our hearts to receive a living God he said to bring a living Christ to a dying generation do you realize the prophet said that you are taking Jesus place on the Earth now can we take all of what he said you are taking Jesus place on the Earth then what did Jesus do he brought a dying generation full of traditions a breath of fresh air and a drink of Artesian well water he brought him away out of bondage into the Glorious Liberty of the father whom he was sent to manifest what are you saying then I'm saying that this is the bride's time to take Jesus place on the Earth you know what your Bible says in Revelation 1 3 the Bible says this blessed he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep the things which are written therein for the time is at hand now can I read you something from the church age book he said the time was not at hand previously in the wisdom and economy of God this Mighty Revelation somebody said Mighty revelation this Mighty Revelation though fully known to God this Mighty Revelation though fully known to God can I say it to you like this there never was a time that God did not know the revelation of his word laughs it was always fully known to God but was only released to the humanity in the season that they needed it to be released in brother Ben said thus we immediately learn a principle that the revelation of God for each age can only come in that age and at a specific time look at Israel the revelation of Deliverance could only come at a specific time brother Brahm says an even more specifically as Israel began to cry for it he said look at Jesus himself he came at the fullness of time now watch he bring him the complete revelation of the godhead and in this layout of sin the revelation of God will come in its due time it will not falter and neither will it be premature the revelation will not be released too early and it will not be released too late when the Revelation is released it will be released at a specific time to a specific people in a specific season to receive a specific Revelation listen friends this is not a shotgun message where we shoot and it just lands wherever but this is a laser-guided message [Music] that was delivered to a specific seed to receive the Revelation I love that word time in Revelation 1 3 it means opportunity so the opportunity is at hand you know what the prophet said he said we have opportunities that Saint Paul never dreamed of heaven we have opportunities that Enoch and Elijah and all of them never had we have opportunities now well someday somehow I'm going to do something for God I say why not now why not this hour why not this service why not this church [Music] come on I'll tell you what you're going to do you're going to sit back and wait on it till it's over and still be looking for it I might as well preach that my brother Craig amen you're going to sit back and look for it and it's already happened and it'll be over I'll come on Sir some of you all day been looking forward to this service you've been looking for church you've been looking for church church is coming church is coming 7 30 church is coming somebody gonna sing somebody gonna preach we're going to Rejoice amen now listen let me say this quit looking for it it's happening quit looking for service it's happening and you're right here in the middle of it if you keep on looking before long we're going to dismiss and we're going to go home and you're still going to be looking for it and it's already happened right in front of you well that's the same way it is with this bride's Revival that's the same way it is with the third pull we got a bunch of return Ministry Devils that have crept in the church and they've got people looking for something way off in the future and failing to see that it's happening right here brother Maurice it's not coming it's here right now it's here upon us we are in the middle of the bride's Revival you want to speak the word it's time to speak you want to believe for the impossible it's time to believe you want to walk in the anointing and the grace of God well now's the time to do it there's not another age coming open up your eyes seize your opportunity [Applause] well preacher I want to shout what are you waiting on you might as well shout right now well brother Andrew I want to know what David felt like when he danced you got the same opportunity to dance like David [Applause] you say how can you say that because David's dance was because the word of the Lord was returning to its rightful position and if anybody got a right to dance if anybody got a right to praise God it's the Bride of Jesus Christ she has seen the word of the Lord fully restored hallelujah hallelujah in both mechanics and Dynamics [Applause] what are you saying preacher I'm saying the hour of fullness is here well someday brother Stephen Sunday someday know this day this hour [Applause] well I might as well preach I'm here brother Brown said like this he said the hour of fullness now when you move into this hour of fullness look what Paul says in Romans 15 29 he says I'm sure that when I come unto you I shall come in the fullness of the blessing Paul said when I come to you I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ do you realize William Brandon preached the same thing that Paul preached then I can say when God said the seventh angel he was not coming in a partial blessing he was coming in the fullness of the blessing in Ephesians 1 10 Paul says that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven which are on the earth even in him Ephesians 3 19. ye know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God the fullness of the blessing the dispensation of the fullness of all things then Paul says that you might be filled with all the fullness of God I didn't have time to pull it but I can preach it to you from memory Paul says be not drunk on wine in excess but be ye filled with a spirit be ye filled with the spirit somebody say field you know what that word fullness means in the New Testament it is the body of believers in the New Testament the word fullness is the body of Believers as that which is filled with the presence the power the agency and the riches of God and of Christ this body of Believers is full of the power of the rate of the agency come on of the blessings and of the presence of Christ now the prophet of God said you are filled with something right here tonight spoken word you're filled with something he said you're either filled because you cannot sit here without being full of something he said now you might be full of the world loving the world or the things of the world God be merciful to you you might be full of Creeds from some church or some little prayer that you said God be merciful to you you might be full of religion and yet that's the worst yet that's right in the last days it'd be very religious having a form of godliness but would deny the power thereof now watch a prophet if you are full of religion you're miserable if you are full of religion you're miserable you're just religious if you're full of Creeds you don't know what you're talking about if you're full of the world you're blind if you're full of religion you're miserable if you're full of the Creeds you don't know what you're talking about and if you're full of the world you're blind but then again you may be full of the Holy Ghost oh I hope you're full he said and if you're full the Holy Ghost what have you got you got power you got love you got peace then church we are not like denominations who have received and settled down and satisfied with just a portion of what God has for the church and the age we're living we are not happy with halfway intellectual conversions we are not satisfied with halfway sermons and halfway Services we are under the potentials of this Royal seed of Christ and our soul must receive a satisfying portion and the satisfying portion to the believer is all that was in God was poured into Christ and all that was in Christ has been poured into the church yes sir then Paul could say in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily now watch a prophet he says and ye are complete in him then watch a prophet say thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed right spoken word Tabernacle y'all want to put your joy shoes on this bride is the literal spoken word seat right whereas once God was manifested in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ he is now manifested in a many membered body what are you saying preacher I'm saying that the spirit of God is here to raise up the bride to go over into the full promise we have got to quit sitting in the come can I preach I think it's time to quit sinning in the shallow Waters of this message come on Church well we're just going to sit over here you know what Ezekiel said he said there's ankle deep water then there's Knee Deep Water then there's then there's hip high water amen but then there was some swimming water come on there's three right there amen but notice there's a fourth one the third one was hip water but the fourth one was swim and water and we are not a part of just a partial restoration but justification made way for sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost which has made way for the person of the word which is the swimming Waters come on Church take your floaties off come on Church get off of the bank it's time to go swimming in the revelation of the entire mystery of the book we have been called worthy to go into all the promises of God [Applause] [Music] oh it's a full promise it's a full promise it's a full land it's a full commission now I know what you're thinking about you're still thinking about your Humanity I'm not worthy I can't do it I'm not gonna what can I put you in Joshua's shoes for a minute can I put you in Joshua's shoes who's standing at the river and Moses is dead and the word of the Lord comes unto Joshua and says you got to take this brother Maurice you gotta take this people over into the promised land and Joshua looks at his commission and realizes who's been before him and Joshua has the same struggle that you have how can me Joshua have this ability with all my failures and all my mistakes and all my shortcomings to lead this people a promise into the land that God has given them as an inheritance within all of a sudden all of a sudden the spirit of God fell upon Joshua and these words proceeded as I was with Moses foreign Joshua called a revelation with all of Moses's mistakes with all of Moses's failures the presence of God never left him when he was bound God was with him when he was hooked God was with him when he was in battle God was with him when he was found God was with him and that Revelation struck Joshua and he said God if you never left Moses with all of his mistakes then I'm going to put my marching shoes on cause if you didn't leave Moses then you ain't going to leave me well I feel like preaching here tonight as I was with William Branham so will I be with you if William Branham had mistakes and I had mistakes get up spoken word Tabernacle he's still with you because he has called you as I was with Moses as I was with Moses as I was with the seventh angel as I was with the prophet so am I with the prophecy get up get up put your walking shoes on your mistakes will not keep you out of this land your failures will not keep you out of this land [Applause] oh crap your Humanity your Humanity will not keep you out of this land well somebody blow a trumpet Russ somebody's child aloud [Music] greater is he that is in you that he I feel I feel like praising him he never left me he never forsook me he was always with me when my friends walked out he stood with me [Applause] yeah yeah you gotta come out of your Humanity to come into your identity of deity I said you got to come out of your Humanity to come into your identity of deity gonna let me preach to you the deity part is greater than the humanity thank you as I was with brother Branham [Applause] so will I be with his bride she will not stop short she will not go halfway now now now now you all know what I'm talking about don't you God wants separators God's not looking for mixers he's looking for separators God's word calls for total separation from unbelief if it calls for total separation then that must mean there's a full identification coming to the seed that has fully separated now the Bible says it very beautiful that that God called in Deuteronomy 7 verse 6 now are the holy people you know that you're a holy people can I go on the Lord thy God had chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all the people that are upon the face of the Earth the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for ye were the fewest of all the people brother man said what was this scripture showing it was showing it was going to take the grace of Jehovah over the children to put him in the promised land can I say this you're not going to take this land by law you're not going to take this land by works you're not going to take this land by legalism you will take this land by grace that's why in 1961 the prophet preaches an entire sermon and calls it the message of Grace now do you know what he's showing you and brother brother Greg it's always amazed me brother I'm saying I'm going to preach on Grace he said the one thing I've been gotten after for is preaching Grace now in my little finite mind I wonder who in the world is going to get after a prophet brother Kelly for preaching Grace don't everybody love Grace don't everybody want to hear Grace but they did not want to hear true Grace because true Grace would not take Grace and make it a disgrace and turn the grace of God into this Jesus that's why Paul said amen do we leave the law and come into Grace so that sin May abound he said God forbid that's why Paul preached Romans 7 and said when I would do good evil is always present that's why Paul said I must mortify the Deeds of My Flesh that's why Paul said I Must Die daily come on Church your Victory is crucifying your Humanity to look in the complete identification of deity can I say that again your Victory is crucifying your Humanity to walk in complete identity of deity God have mercy Hallelujah then we're not if if oh God you know what y'all to do in the morning you ought to Walk and Walk and Walk and work different than the Baptists do you ought to walk in on your job in the morning different than the Pentecostals do they walk in well it's just another day I think I'll barely get through I wish I could just stay home but if you've got a revelation of who you are you would go walk in there and say deity is on this job deity is in this school deity is in this truck deity is in this flesh because there is a royal seed well somebody shot deity deity in humanity now now it's going to take the grace of God now can I have a few more minutes it's going to take the grace of God to get us out of the old land into the new now Revelation 5 I love this Revelation 5 can you give me Revelation 5 verse 1. you all know it by heart but I love this here uh I know it's okay to preach it because this is a message Church I've been gotten after preaching this and churches claimed to be the message but I feel pretty good to preaching here not because y'all believe the message the Bible said in Revelation 5 1 I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book sealed or a book written within and on the back side was sealed with Seven Seals now watch verse two and I saw a strong Angel proclaiming who with a loud voice who is worthy who is worthy who is Worthy who is who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof listen to the problem of God he said Lord you let us by the Holy Spirit reach out in that word and get those real things reach out in that word and get those real things and tie them into Calvary can I preach her for a second anybody tries to tell you that this message does away with Calvary they're a liar anybody tries to stand In a Pulpit and say this message does away with a cross of Calvary they are a false prophet they're Anointed with a spirit of hell [Applause] because when the prophet preaches the revelation of the book he says let us reach into the word and get those real things and tie them to Calvary he tied every seal back to Calvary he tied every Thunder back to Calvary he tied predestination back to Calvary he tied the Oneness of a godhead back to Calvary do you know why he done that because the prophet said that they might see that we have the fullness the prophet had to tie these things back to Calvary so the church would see that we have the fullness and the riches and the blessings and the glory and all goes to him who is worthy that come to the book out of the right hand of him that's set up on the throne and sat it down on himself for he was slain since the foundation of the world can I go on right brother says right in this seven sealed book that we're entering now holds the whole mystery of all the Redemption blessings of God if this book does not come open we are a partial Church walking in partial understanding but if the revelation of redemption is released from the word of God then that will put you back on the same side as the lamb himself is on and we are walking in glory we are walking in power we are walking in honor well we're either going to be a message church or not we're either going to be the bride or not we're either going to believe these things or not and I'll just tell you what I think I think if you're going to try to enjoy the benefits of this message without preaching the benefits of this message you ought to take the sign off your door and go join the denomination somewhere and quit being a trespasser you're looking at one preacher that's not ashamed to identify myself with the revelation of the seventh seal being open in the age I'm living in you can shoot me you can stab me you can beat me you can bang me but you will never stop me from walking in the fullness of the identity of deity by the opening of the word now now I know what you're saying you're searching my brother please you're saying how in the world are you getting out there I'll tell you how I'm getting out there the prophet said he said now remember he's the lamb he's the only one that redeemed it remember first seal John 12. brother said let's read it he said now we won't have to wonder anymore he said what the Thunder is in John 12. he said now watch the hour has come that oh I'm running out of time he says the Hours come that the son of man must be glorified he said see you're at the end of an age his ministry is ending see now listen when you come to the end of something you got to go somewhere when time is up when time runs out you got to go somewhere and a prophet was here oh God the prophet was here as the signifying Angel and he stood between the Gap and said church denominations over time is run out you got to go somewhere the hour has come that the son of man must be glorified now now can I just say what he said can I say what he said he automatically ties the son of man being glorified and says what about the hour that when his bride must be taken away what about the Hours come that time shall be no more now watch he reads this and he said now this Revelation it cannot be revealed until what he said here at the end time but it come in a symbol it come in a symbol so whatever was in the mind of God remember the quote was fully known to God all the time but in the Christ the mystery he said he's gradually let it out he's slowly unfaded or slowly uh released it are you with me what is he showing you he's showing you that it come forth in the symbol now watch the brothers should remember a loud clapping noise of Thunder is the voice of God the Bible said it's a clap of Thunder now watch though though it was a thunder but it was God they thought it was a thunder but it was God he understood it for it was revealed to him who is him he's the Lamb of Revelation 5. in his mind the Revelation was fully known but what did he do he said the first seal when it was hoping it was open in symbol form and it thundered now if it thundered in symbol form he said what will it do in reality for him if there was a thunder in symbol form he said then what will it do in reality for him now watch he said now not all itself but first can we preach this first is with God first it's with God he said then it's in symbol then it's revealed first with God when John wrote it it was in symbol come on but when John received the symbol brother great God already knew the Revelation okay when Daniel and John saw the same thing God already knew what the first symbol of the first seal of a seven sealed book was can I go and say it but the revelation of that symbol that comes from God had never been unclosed until 1963 and a prophet walked to the pulpit and opened his Bible and said God hides himself in Simplicity and reveals himself in the same and he said now there's a breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals and then he says and here's that first seal here's that first seal oh God I wish I was a preacher right now here's that first seal he said I've been preaching it's Christ he said but it's not Christ it's the Antichrist so as long as it's in symbol form there's room for error but oh God but when it moves from symbol when it moves from symbol into Revelation then somebody catches the revelation [Applause] oh somebody's shot aloud when it moves from God to symbol to Revelation there's a specific people there is a seed in position to receive the revelation of the symbol as it's come from God and a prophet said here's the reality of it it's not Christ it's the Antichrist [Music] come on you say well preacher we just need our Bibles and you'll just be a good church member as deceived as the rest of them are but if we have and I believe we do I believe we have by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine vindication come on Abraham come on Isaac come on Royal seed the heir of the seed will not be Heir with a Bond's woman you gotta cast out oh God I'm just going to preach and quit you got to cast out the bonds woman come on spoken word Tabernacle I know God's done a lot for you in the last few years but you got to cast out everything that's unlike this message I don't care who said it I don't care who taught it this bride will not be Heir with a denominational shook and brother Maurice before a prophet reveals the set of the first seal before a prophet reveals the first seal he says I'm going to call you bride I'm going to call you bride so there will be an understanding I'm no longer going to call you church I'm no longer going to call you church I'm going to call you bride brother Stephen so you'll understand what I'm getting ready to reveal I've been waiting for thousands of years to reveal this but I'm not going to give it to the church I'm not going to give it to the Catholics I'm going to give it to the Royal seed he's a part of the full Plan of Redemption glory to God [Applause] are you hearing me Church are you hearing me and a prophet turns and says the white horse rider in symbol is the Antichrist he's the devil can I preach this to you I don't have time to preach all of it I'm going to say this he's the devil and now watch a prophet now we all know as Christians that God swore to David that he would raise up Christ to set on his throne and give him an everlasting Kingdom here on the earth he did it and Jesus said he that overcomes the Antichrist he that overcomes the Antichrist and all the things of the world shall set with me on my Throne as I have overcome oh God I have overcome and am sat down with my father in his throne can I preach to you now the alpha has become the Omega come on church when Daniel wrote about it God had you in mind when John wrote about it God had you in mind where Arthur and Finney and Knox and Calvin and the reformers probed at it God had you in mind that's right oh God yes Mom now hear me Church hear me church this was not a church book this was not a coat of morals this was not a code of ethics this was the book of redemption and if the book doesn't come open then everything is lost that's exactly right but not anybody but not anybody but not anybody could take the book could rip the seals I could release the Revelation there had to be someone worthy oh God only a worthy person only a worthy person could take the book and tear the seals off well I might as well go ahead and say it it's only a worthy person could reveal it yet only a worthy person can receive it if only a worthy person could tear off his seals then only a worthy person could receive what's been tore off and you are the worthy people are the worthy people to receive everything that Adam lost [Applause] me hallelujah hallelujah it's not coming it's here amen it's here it's here Redemption is here healing is here the Salvation is here restoration Hallelujah [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] it's your time take your time Hallelujah I'm talking about a bride I'm not talking about a church I'm not talking about a hybrid people I'm talking about somebody I'm talking about somebody who is in the mind of God [Applause] foreign Church [Applause] you gotta whip that devil you gotta whip that devil that says you're not worthy come on can I say this can I say this the bride overcomes the Antichrist [Applause] amen the bride overcomes the Antichrist amen you know how she overcomes by the revelation of Jesus Christ amen then if we don't have the revelation we are a vulnerable church group but brother Maurice if we have the Revelation well I'm this close to it brother Stephen gonna go ahead and say it I'll ride this Trail again foreign this Trail again listen and I tell you what happened I tell you what happened a devil of deception got a hold of a powerful quote and twisted it and made a return Ministry Doctrine out of it and they got a tent and a horse and an airplane and they've got an entire Congregation of people sitting there bound under the change of not knowing who they are what their position is so here's what they say we're just going to have some good meetings and some good Services until brother Branham comes back and takes the book and releases the Revelation that is a demon of heresy amen I return that demon I said that devil in the name of Jesus Christ amen that is not what my Prophet taught but it's not what this Bible teaches amen pigs so that devil got among the people and they said well we'll just wait on brother Brandon to come back but what about that quote where he said she'll ride this Trail again [Applause] what about that quote Amber the prophet said she will ride this train again amen come on church if this book don't come open you have nothing to combat the Antichrist with if this book don't come open you have nothing to whip the devil with but if this book comes open then you can get on your white horse and you can get on the sword and you can ride that devil down and defeat every demon of deception defeat every false Spirit defeat every wrong idea oh God what are you saying preacher I'm saying we did not become seed we always were seed therefore when the Revelation come we were already quickened in position to receive the revelation listen I gotta leave these notes and preach we are in position right here tonight for translation are you hearing me man we cannot stay brother Stephen we cannot stay time is run out the end is here seven Gentile dispensations are over we gotta go somewhere Church well I heard another Angel come down from heaven saying this come out of her my people what was he calling you out of a layout of seeing age into a bright age listen to me Church you cannot stay where life was you cannot stay where life was you've got to move to where life is you cannot stay can I say it like this brother Stephen you cannot stay in the horse and buggy age you cannot stay in the automobile age you come on church we got a bunch of honest friends who are still ride horse and buggy and every year in Pennsylvania there's somebody gets killed because they're trying to compete with an 80 mile per hour car and a 10 mile per hour horse and buggy it will not work and neither can you put the Dynamics of the revelation of the Seven Seals in a church that's in a horse and buggy she'll blow up she'll blow up but if you take that same Revelation and put it in the redeemed bride she'll do the Greater Works she'll speak the word she'll believe God [Applause] how many is ready to walk let's go where life is we cannot stay where life was we gotta go where life is now brother brother Stephen you're telling me to preacher preach me you realize what's going to happen if you advance you're going to become an oddball if you advance you're going to become a spectacle if you advance you're going to I remember what they told me brother I remember when I started evangelizing and they told me you're just an evangelist you can't get no Doctrine you can't preach the seventh seal you can't preach a third pull you don't have no rights there but you know what I found out if I didn't stay there I had no anointing because my anointing is coming from the anointed word of my age so listen they then told me not to preach it and I'm still preaching it they done told me not to quote a prophet and I still study this message every day of my life you can call me an oddball you can call me a spectacle you can call me a wannabe but one of these days you're going to call me gone because the Revelation is going to change my body [Music] [Applause] it's going to change my body and I'm going to step out of time back into eternity I'm going to lay down mortality and I'm gonna put on immortality I'm gonna take off this corruption and put on incorruption [Applause] I gotta go where life is my brother brother Stephen might as well say it take a step take a step and start preaching the Revelation and every devil in hell start howling but I'm just gonna can I take some Liberty I want to take the Liberty tonight to say thank God for our brother Harold hildebranch thank God forever the Ed mysticals thank God for those men who was with a prophet but they did not stay where life was come on can I preach to you brother biscoll God bless his soul 88 years old still standing for this message body failing him but still gonna fire for this word just the other day had the privilege to sit with him and though his voice is failing he's still got his strength about this message you know when I got to thinking I got to thinking about our brother bisco he had to step out in front of an entire generation that just thought this message was God sent a prophet and a prophet went hunting and a storm stopped but a man who was underneath the inspiration of the Revelation had to step out and say there's more to this than just sitting around the campfire there's more to this than just a belt buckle there's more to this than just a Colt or a hat like brother random there's a reality there's a reality the son of man is among the church well come on Church our forefathers our Pioneers our brother Hildebrandt went to Africa year after year and preached the revelation of the son of man till nearly every person could hear that there was more to this message than just God sent a prophet listen friends can I go I'm going to close on this point I'm going to close on this point listen that generation is behind us but they pushed us they pushed us to where we are let me say this young people don't you let this message don't you let this message become a bunch of fussing and fighting and ideas and doctrines if they fought and Blaze the trail to bring it to where its head you get behind your pastor draw your sword and ride that devil down until every soul is walking in the fullness of the potentials [Applause] he's gonna walk out I said you're gonna walk out you got to be willing to be made a spectacle but you're gonna walk out look at somebody and say you gotta walk you gotta walk a walk you gotta walk oh no you can't stand still gotta walk you gotta walk walk adoption series part one program says that's where the church is failing they're failing in their walk he said it's a perfect walk how can you walk perfect under an imperfection but if there's a perfect word then there's a perfect faith and if there's a perfect Faith then there's a perfect people and if there's a perfect people brother Kelly we're walking a perfect walk can I tell you what walking is it's Enoch's walk it's Enoch's walk it's not Man's Walk it's not Church age walk it's Enoch's walk and you know what Enoch did Enoch walked with God when he felt like it he walked with God when he didn't feel like it he walked with God when he was happy he walked with God when he was sad he walked with God when he was broke he walked with God when he was rich he walked with God when his family was doing good he walked with God when his family was doing bad he walked with God and there is another bride in the Earth today who her type is Enoch and she's gotta walk with God I'm sorry brother

left your sermon no I hadn't I have it Revelation 3 4 they have not defiled their garments for they shall walk with me for they are worthy [Applause] Matthew 25 there were five wise and five foolish five wise virgins was a type of the bride of Christ who was granted fine linen clean and white which is the righteousness of the Saints the five foolish virgins were working to get their garments they were working we are granted oh God I know I'm doing a horrible job at this but let me connect this that word granted you know what that word granted means that word granted means to give to someone whom it already belonged to [Applause] brother Maurice when something is granted it's given to you it was already yours well then why does it have to be granted because we come from God but we bypass our theophany contacted a human spirit preacher to be tested and tried but when the testing and trials are over can I break this down as plain as I know how if you're on Interstate 85 running Interstate 85 North to 85 South and you run into an area they got a bypass brother RAM used that word didn't he bypass they got a bypass called 485. so you're on 85 you get on the bypass 485 and you bypass something go back around but you get back on 85. testing one two it's still working you was on one with God you was on 85 but then you had to bypass it but you got back on it he was always in the mind of God but a fall in the garden put you on a bypass but in the end time God would send the seventh angel to preach the Seven Seals that would put you back on Oneness with God and say Church you're going to walk like Enoch and you're going to walk back in the Garden of Eden say these words with me and I'm done for they are are Worthy [Applause] for they are not might be not could be r

about had an explosion in your office but he said that I knew where I was going probably God said what is it done Daniel 11 32 he said such as do wickedly against the Covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries but for people that know their God shall be strong and do exploits he said what is it done and the kindness as he said come in like flatteries Feast of trumpets what has he done he is bringing the Protestant ecumenical council of the world churches the spirit of the Antichrist upon both of them bringing them to the slaughter just like they did the hour in the hour to call the bride in the hour when the Antichrist is being put up on the Protestant and ecumenical is the hour a seventh angel is calling a bride by the revelation of the symbol that was in the mind of God eternally how loose in the ecclesiastical Church Spirit loosed upon what not upon the denominations but upon the bride but here you'll get it but here you'll get it the bride will not go through that time [Applause] the church will but the bride won't the church will but the bride won't why will the church because she's been mixed with the Protestant and ecumenical but I'm no longer going to call you church I'm going to call you Brian [Applause] can't you see you say the church has to go through the persecution for the Perfection of it the blood of Jesus Christ perfects the bride oh a man who chooses a wife don't put us through a lot of punishment he's already found Grace too with her she has found Grace with him and so will it be upon the bride and so is it on the bride we unworthy
