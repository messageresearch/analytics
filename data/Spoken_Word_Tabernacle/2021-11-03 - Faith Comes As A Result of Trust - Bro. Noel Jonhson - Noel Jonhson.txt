a day amen they've been created just to worship god they'd be holding the face of the father they're holy but yeah they know nothing about redemption amen and and what kind of a story are we gonna tell them when we get up there and then this song just came to me that this would be a story the plan of redemption is our story amen it's to you personally individually it is your story amen let's

raised my voice is that your story is that your song if you don't know that song yet we need to bring you to the altar amen it's a song of redemption angel descending from above from glory whispering mercy in the cloud of seven angels amen amen it's amazing if you look through the scripture you will see how the cloud of seven angel has been hidden many places in the scripture amen even in the zodiac you have the cloud of seven angels so it has been perfect in the zodiac perfect in the pyramid perfect in the written word it's all over the scripture it just takes a matter of revelation amen so where have you been living in humanistic revelation who reach into the visions [Laughter] who is in a vision not yet [Laughter] somebody is confessing at least who lives in a revelation so nobody in humanistic no more thinking and reasoning and pondering and trying to figure it out or things like that amen blessed be the name of the lord the three reigns no more humanistic you did it for years it didn't help you cause you a lot of headache sometimes he works a little bit and then before you know it something is hunting you back and biting at you amen revelation is better because you walk by faith and not by in other words you walk in the realm of revelation and not in a humanistic way that's what paul said walk by faith and not by sight is your greatest enemy amen no who was it i believe it's jonah who say i ever think that was compassing him about where lying how can you call lying vanity you in a belly of a fish you see how which gps did he have to know where where the the temple was where which gps how did he know the north for the south for the east or the west you see what faith can do to you he can even give you a perfect gps when you don't have no direction nothing no label no landmark that would tell you either you're going to go this way or they will be going this way all you need is faith because with faith it's impossible there's nothing nothing nothing that's going to stand on your way amen so keep praying lord's willing we will catch up on sunday and then see how we can climb a little bit more amen blessed be the name of the lord tonight we have brother noel johnson you saw him here before and i miss him if i want to blame probably was because but greg didn't tell me here the time so he was on the service amen so by god's grace we managed to catch him right on time when he is available so extended our open door and he will be the one ministering for us tonight so sister shirley is here we appreciate you you're not visitors we don't have visitors in this church you're just part of the big family of jesus christ amen amen so we came from somewhere and we are going back to god everybody clear yeah for the young man i believe there was only six responses if i have understood correctly you need please to respond to the text when you get it not look and say i got the message if you got a message you say yes or no just say no or say yes so we know only six people responded if you would please respond and talk to the deacon then we will see what will do for the young brothers meeting amen one question on a page not one page with four questions amen so make sure you got one note notepad you write just one you put it there so it will give somebody else a chance to pull their question if not we will get one individual and go through ten questions and we're not going to be able to be reaching to the other and it might take three months before we get there so if you want to write five ten questions that's fine but make sure they in one post card each one so the deacon will get them and shout for them and bring it to me like prayer request or like what was it the prayer request with brother branham or the line of prayer they will move them around and hand it to me and we go from there amen so just do your best i know we need some time you need to make some time so we'll be okay if we go one one weekend a month it might take a while because some of them are deep some of them are you need to talk and get in there and explain and go up and move on so we might just get one question and the whole evening just to deal with it so make sure we be mindful of other people amen and i would strongly encourage you continue with the cod book those who already started and who are still reading the code book somehow you should see a lot of things and a lot of changes amen if you are not talk to me amen amen you ready for the word open psalm 133 so we can warm you up more seems like somebody's really quiet calm maybe the devil has been fighting you but thank me to god you're already in the church amen can you hear me very well okay psalm 133 separation yes division i like that can i start it again separation division why psalm 133 you there a song of decree of david behold how and how it is for brethren to dwell together in what division okay right brother robert behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren not sinners you get it brethren be clear sisters to dwell together in in unity what is unity like it is like the precious ointment upon the how can unity be like an anointing oil how can unity be an anointing all it is like the precious ointment upon the head not everybody's head it's a specific head brother robert it's upon the head not everybody's head upon the head that run down upon the beard even errands so it's not everybody's head it is the head of aaron and aaron was who a little bit higher a high priest so unity is like the anointing all that was upon the high priest but that high priest he was on his head and what did you get it on the head and on the beard what are you looking at if you're looking at the head and the beard what are you looking at brother robert is laughing if you're looking at somebody and you look and you see the head of that person and the beard of that person what do you see okay the face of a high priest the face of a high priest just keep pondering on him okay continue to ponder on that face of a high priest and that high priest have some beard oh somebody's getting it somebody's getting that did you get it what did you see oh my god this church you see now now you warm up pretty good right you ready for the word can i stop here [Laughter] amen it's like the precious ointment upon the head the head of a high priest and we know that we are not under iran or levitical priesthood we now under melchizedek priesthood and we have also a high priest and a high priest have beard it is like the precious ointment upon the head that run down upon the beard even the even aaron's beard that went down to the skirt of his what is the skirt of a high priest what is in there brother kelly where is those pomegranate what is in the skirt why did the woman with the bloody she went and touched her what is in there i see the lord high end and his did what go search what is the chain of that person amen that went down to the skirt of his garment the train brother random say represented the angels so the anointing start from the head all the way to the as they do of herman the scripture is really hidden and as they do that descended upon the mountains plural of zion do you know what harmonies have you searched herman okay as they do of hermann and as they do that descended upon the mountains of zion for their the lord commanded the blessing what blessing even life forever more look what unity is look what unity is so when people are in unity it's like dear knowing all that is coming upon the from the high priest let me do one thing and then we call the preacher let's go to act chapter one warm you up a little bit if you're there you can say amen act chapter one go to chapter two sorry verse one and when the day of what was fully they were all in division how were there one accord so everybody was in so if unity is like the anointing all right let's see what this unity does and let's see what the high priest did when he saw his children in and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in the same place and all of them in what did he do verse two and suddenly there came a sound from what as of a rushing muddy wind and he feel all the house where they were sitting and they appear unto them clothing tongues like as of fire and he sat upon each of them and they were all with their unity it's pleasant it's good for the brother to draw together in it's like the anointing all the unity and the day of pentecost under the promise of god under the command of god go sit there stay there in jerusalem when we obey that command and we come together in agreement in unity look what he pulls down then that anointing that was on the priest could not stay no longer on the priest he was running down from the priests head which is crushed the head of the church then he's going to run down upon the body he gathered on the pentecost everybody clear then at the end it must go to the feet the angel must come till the end time that anointing will come with the angel in the skirt and it's like the dew of hermann you search her herman in the scripture and you'll see that herman is another name for ma zion you see now jerusalem they were all in jerusalem see your scripture is clear amen so stay together pray together remember one another in prayer support one another in prayer everything will be all right before you know it we all gonna make it to the other side amen let's call brother noel only believe [Music] [Music] things are possible [Music] only [Music] believe [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] lord i believe [Music] lord i believe that all things are possible i believe lord i believe lord i believe so all things [Music] i want to greet you all in the name of the lord jesus christ and it's my privilege to be amongst you this evening while you're standing if you'd open your bibles to romans the fifth chapter read verses one and two and the subject matter is faith comes as a result of trust i did a study on the book of habakkuk a number of years a couple years ago anyway and that changed my whole concept of what faith is faith is not believing for something it's believing in someone and hopefully that'll make more senses as we get into the scriptures so romans 5 reading verses one and two it says therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom we have access by faith through through this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of god and let's just pray our most gracious and loving heavenly father it is always our privilege to gather ourselves together around your word and to sit at your feet and to receive what you have for us you've chosen to minister through men but lord we are imperfect but lord you are the perfect one and you are the preacher and so lord it's asking you to come this night and guide the thoughts of my mind and the words which are spoken the lord they wouldn't be mine but lord they would be yours the lord we might be able to comprehend more fully just what it means to have faith and then lord to be able to trust in you for all things grant this lord for i ask it in jesus christ's name amen amen you can be seated says here being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ when we talk about being at peace it means nothing bothers us nothing disturbs us we are at peace we are at rest things will come around us and problems will arise and then our world is will to go upside down if you will but yet we will at peace because we have faith because we have come to a relationship with jesus christ that nothing bothers us that is when we look at brother branham's life and i look at his life and the things that he has gone through i realized this is what he where he had to come because he had to come to a place in his relationship with god where nothing bothered him where he knew something would have something happened or something would disturb or he said somebody asked he says he said well the civil devil is hindering us he says well maybe not maybe it's god trying to tell us something and so here again but see brother branham could look beyond circumstances and he could begin to realize god is the one who was in control we look at the world we're in today we look at our government and the chaos that exist there if i did not believe that god was the one in control i would go crazy because nothing is making sense i mean it it's you don't know what tomorrow will bring i mean literally you don't know what tomorrow will bring he could write a little edict and say okay because of such and such and such and such we're going to ground all their airplanes they did that in india in one day overnight the government of india shut down all transportation they said down the airlines they shut down the railway they shut down the buses they shut down the taxis you wanted to go someplace you walked people would go people who people who hired men to go into do different jobs they would go into villages they would hire the men which are able-bodied and they would take them different places and some of them would be four or 500 miles from home and when they shut down all the transportation they had to walk home there was no transportation one guy happened to be in in africa it took him six months to get home finally they opened up one airline was able to fly into i think it was it was bombay and there he had to rent a car to drive all the way to the other side of india so he could get home but he was the and and a bunch of people got together to help rent the car because that was the only means of transportation there was but see our government could do the same i mean we're in the same situation but it comes down to the place and now it come we're talking about having faith but it comes to having a relationship with jesus christ because without that relationship you cannot be at peace but that that relationship the world will bother you and all the circumstances in your life they will bother you but if you understand god is in control you understand god is the one in charge of all things then you can be at rest you know but one of the struggles we have in our life is trying to have faith for something this is generally how we apply faith we get sick oh i need to have faith for healing i need to have faith for healing and so we try and generate something within ourselves to believe god's promise so that he'll heal us but see that is not that's the wrong atom that's the wrong way to approach this brother branham in the exposition of the seven church ages he says he says we need to call on god for revelation more than anything else in the world he says we have accepted the bible we have accepted the great truths of it but it is still not real to most people because the revelation by the spirit is not there the word has not been a quicken the bible said in ii corinthians 5 21 that we have become the very righteousness of god by our union with jesus christ he said did you get that he says it says we are the very righteousness of god himself by being in christ we have become we are the very righteousness of god himself by being in christ okay he says it says that jesus became became sin for us it does not say he became sinful but he came sin for us that by our union with him why me we might become the righteousness of god he says if we accept the fact and we must that he literally became sin for us by his substitution for us then we must also accept the fact that by our union with him we are the very righteousness of god to reject one is to reject the other to accept the one is to accept the other he said now we know the bible says that and it can't be denied he said but the revelation of it is missing and it's not it is not real to the majority of god's children it is just a good verse in the bible but see here again to me the problem comes down why isn't it real to us why do we struggle with salvation why do we struggle believing we are the very righteousness of god because we say oh we believe the bible well that's true but see i have come to the understanding if i have faith in in god and i believe that what he has said is true then i don't look at myself anymore i look at him because he is the one who has made the pro the proclamation he is the one that says i am in myself i say well no this can't be possible i mean i look at myself but then i have to go back to the word brother brown says it's better for you to believe what god says you are than what you think that you are and see but see this is our struggle why do we have faith why do we have why do we have why do we struggle to have faith in god to believe for something it's because we're always looking at us we keep looking at our shortcomings we keep looking at our faults really keeping our faith and we all have them you know welcome to the human race okay but if we can begin to comprehend what god is and what god has said and if you have trust in him and what he has said then there's no more argument because what he has said has to be true because he cannot lie [Music] when we go and we tell we just look at this what paul said here um it says therefore being justified which brother brown says is it's as if you never sin okay which is what he was talking about there in in in what he said in the church ages or in the in the church but church age book he says therefore being justified by faith it says we have peace or we are at rest or through jesus christ and when i when i read that verse i figured well that's interesting but where does where was paul quoting this from and that's found in havoc the second chapter verse 4 it says behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but the just shall live by his faith and this is where paul took this thing if therefore by by faith we believe okay but he's going back to habakkuk and habakkuk is only three chapters it's it's not a very big book but yet habakkuk lived in the time of of jeremiah before the destruction of jerusalem and god had taken habakkuk and and him to have a good being a prophet god had showed him all the sins and the iniquity and the hypocrisy of the priesthood and habakkuk's righteous indignation rose up and says lord why don't you bring judgment on these people i mean how god how can you being holy and righteous and pure how can you tolerate this mess and so god says well you know that's a good suggestion i'm paraphrasing okay he says that's a good suggestion i think i'll bring judgment and habit hooks is great you see i'm going to send the chaldeans oh no no no no you don't want to do that no no because they're not nice people they kill because they like to kill when they come into a city they destroy everything man woman child it doesn't matter and so and and so all of a sudden you know habakkuk became fearful for himself and that's why and then god spoke down into him and says behold the soul which is lifted up is not upright but the just shall live by his faith he's telling habakkuk you have to have faith in me you have to literally trust me for your very survival i read in a commentary and it's and says he whose soul is not right in him in him places himself in a fortress or tower to set himself on high uh there from the enemy and does not return to god nor seek deliverance from him in other words the man says i can do this myself i can i'm you know oh yeah we've had troubles before i survived i've survived the other trouble yeah i'll survive this one no problem you know i can take care of myself in other words i don't need god and the man and god says if you are of that opinion i will let you alone i will take my hands off of you and i'll let you do what you do your own thing but he said but it says the person who who will trust me i will provide for him i will watch over him i will take care of him and so god is telling habakkuk you have to trust me you have to come to a relationship with me that you put your total trust and reliance upon me as your god and so often when we when we begin to apply that into our own lives we say well yeah you know we may not realize it but we are trying to justify ourselves we're trying oh yeah you know if i read my bible every day then god will look favorably upon me or if i do this god will be favorable upon me if i do this and god will be favorable toward me and so we're trying to earn you don't earn favors from god you don't earn salvation from god salvation is a free gift which god gives you because of what he has done at calvary god heals you because he allowed the stripes to be put on jesus's back he already purchased your healing all you have to do is believe it so why don't we believe it because we don't trust him i mean to me this is where it all comes back to if we trusted god if literally we trusted god and we began to realize that our very existence is relying upon him then everything else becomes becomes different god says i'm healed well than i am i mean i mean it can't be anything but that i mean god can't lie so god says the stripes laid on his back he purchased my healing well therefore i am healed oh but you still have symptoms well that's just a lie of the devil because god says i'm healed and and see this is where it has to come in our lives this is what has to come in our thinking it has to come to the realization where we literally trust god where if god said something in his word god cannot lie and therefore we have total confidence in that god to bring to pass what that god has said you know it talks brother jesus christ talks about a man who relies on himself and this is found in luke the 18th chapter verses 9 through 14 and i'll paraphrase this also he says he says there's two people went into the temp near the temple to pray he says one was a pharisee and the other one was republican now pharisee was the righteous of the righteous they kept all of the law and and even then some okay the publican on the other hand was the tax collector he was the jew he was a jew who took and took money from his own people to give it to rome so he was he was a traitor to his own people and so he here's the examples that jesus christ was using and so the pharisee went up into the temple to pray and he stood up and thus prayed within himself and says god i thank you that i am not as all these other men are extorted unjust adulterers and bloody dotty dolls even as this republican over here i fast twice in the week give tithes of all that i possess and he would list on and on and on and on and on he was trying to he was trying to tell god i am righteous because of what i have done and god says no and then he goes on and the public and standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven but smote him on his breath saying god be merciful to me a sinner and jesus as i tell you this man went down to house justified just as if he never sinned rather than the other and everyone that because everyone that exalts himself will be based and he but he that will humble himself god will exalt and scofield has a has a footnote in his bible when he when he looks at this prayer of the publican he said be toward me as thou lookest upon the atoning blood he was not relying upon himself he wasn't replying upon his works he was relying upon the sacrifice which had been taken and the blood had been placed upon the mercy seat he's saying don't you even begin to look at me because i have nothing to offer you but look at the atoning blood that's been placed there and on the basis of that regard me but see this is where we have to come in our lives god don't look at me because i have nothing to offer you i'm a failure in so many things in so many areas of my life but yet lord you went to calvary and you became the sacrifice for my sins and because you were willing to die for my sins therefore you have paid the price for my sins and therefore i am righteous because you have said that i am righteous it's not me looking at myself it's not me trying to say that i how great i am and all these other things no is looking and beginning to realize what god accomplished for us at the cross i go to the cross many times a day because everything i need that is where i will find it if i need healing well lord you already paid the price because of the stripes on your back lord i made mistakes today but you already because of your sacrifice at calvary you've already paid for my sins and therefore i confess my sins and therefore you will forgive me my sins and cleanse me from all unrighteous and will you we will establish the relationship between you between him and i but see this it has to come to this in our life it's like i won't ask it here because i only get half the response i asked a few congregations how many here got up this morning you know about half the people rose their hands i figure well the other one's obvious you didn't but you know you're here anyway um and but how many how many here had food today and well more of them actually had food you know okay but the thing of it is why did you get up because god woke you up [Music] why did you eat today because god provided you food oh but i work for i work for a living i make all this money well who gave you the job who gave you the help who gave the ability to do the things that you are doing i mean i i have looked at other people in their lives not not to judge but you know some of the people says oh yeah look at what i have created look at what i have done you know look at how successful i have been and all these other types of things but you know all it takes because we like we used to i work in a hospital laboratory and the businesses would go and they would they would do health screenings um and so we would run 50 or 60 specimens of from a company through and uh we were doing one person so i noticed this guy has leukemia he didn't know it leukemia has no symptoms but all of a sudden we looked at the blood work i said this guy has leukemia and it's advanced and so we sent the report off so this guy would show up to work the next day and they would call him in the office and say we had a health screening yeah yeah yeah i feel great what's going on he says you need to go see your doctor you only have about three months to live that changed his whole outlook on work it changed his whole outlook on everything i know my brother when he was gonna planning for retirement he wanted to work a couple more years and stuff and uh all of a sudden he had a heart attack and uh his his his wife his her um her brothers one of a couple of them are doctors and stuff and so she called up her brother and says hey this is the symptoms my my lyle's having and he listen he says get him to the emergency now don't wait for nothing get him there now so she drove him to the hospital walked him in there a doctor was just prepping himself to do a heart cath on a patient and when my brother walked in there and they saw him in the middle of having a heart attack they wheeled him in five minutes later and he was on the table and they did ended a heart calf on him if that doctor had not only been prepped my brother would not have lived that changed his whole outlook on life that changed all the plans that he had ever made all of us said now he realized the only reason he was alive was because god allowed him to live but and sometimes it takes that action within our lives for us to be able to acknowledge that god is the only supplier of the life that we have if it was not for god we would not be alive it was not for god we would not have jobs if it was not for god we really would have nothing and so it's the it's learning to acknowledge god in all things that really we glorify him and the things which we do you know brother branham asked how long does healing last he says as long as you have faith he says how long does salvation last as long as you have faith if you no longer believe you're saved you're lost if you no longer believe you're healed then you're not it takes a continuous believing it takes a continual struggle within our lives because brother bradham even struggled with this he said sometimes he says i feel so low and so bad but he says he says when i get to that point he says how do i know that i'm saved he said i go back to the scriptures and i realize this is the requirements god has placed and i've met those requirements therefore i am saved he didn't look at the fact that he was a prophet he didn't look at the fact how god ministered through him he didn't look about anything else he went back to the word he said based upon the word i have salvation so it's upon the word of god he rested his faith and that's where we have that's where we have to come in going through the scriptures i began to look at the lives of of different people and why did abraham have faith um we know that god spoke to him and we don't know in what form and he was at 75 years of age when finally he finally left heron and and turned it into the promised land and god had told him i want you to leave your family and your your place of your nativity and stuff like that well he didn't exactly obey like you know jump to it and do it um he got into the into the cane in the into the promised land into canaan and they were in the middle of a famine so he said well this isn't much of a nice place to live at so we went down into egypt but god says no i didn't call you to live in egypt i called you to live in the promised land god has not called us to live in egypt in the world in ourselves in our abilities no he has called us to live in in canaan land which brother brahms is represents the holy spirit it's in the holy spirit we are to live it is in the holy spirit we are to have our existence it's in the holy spirit that we are to be in communion with god and and by that we are we are to be to be able to to access god and be able to believe unto and god for all these things so so abraham finally he got in there and and god tried him in different ways but it was through the trials that abraham went through that he came to the place where he began to trust god when there was a famine in the land he had to say god i need to have water for my cattle from my sheep and for the other thing lord there's this going on i need you i need you to supply here i need you to supply there and so over time abraham had to come to the faith where he had total confidence in the god that had called to him until finally he came to him after the promised land had came he says i want you to take your son your only son and i want you to take him up and offer him for a sacrifice and so abraham says i don't know how you're going to keep him alive because all my pro all the promises rested in him he took him up to the mountain and and he had the the fire and the wood and stuff like that and he took isaac tied his hands and put him on top of the pile of wood and he was going to slay isaac and then god says stay your hand but see abraham had had faith he had such confidence in god that even though isaac was reduced to ashes god would bring him up and restore him fully and they would walk back down the mountain but he had to go through an awful lot to come to that place in his life where he could have that confidence in in god we could look at a man named david david was out taking care of his dad's sheep a lion came in and david ran after the lion he killed the lion he rescued the lamb a little while later however the time framing was a bear came in and he went after the bear and he killed the bear rescuing the lamb why why did david have to go through those incidences because there was a day he was going to have to face goliath and he had to have confidence in the god that had called him so that he knew that when he faced goliath that he would be able to slay the giant and bring deliverance to the children of israel but see we go through the things we go through in our lives in order for us to develop us to have the confidence in god we have sickness and then we pray and god heals okay and then we go for the hardship and god supplies and we go through other circumstances in our life and we see the hand of god repeatedly coming and taking care of us here and taking care of us here and healing us here and doing this for us and doing that for until it should come to the place in our life where we have such a relationship with god that we literally trust him for everything [Music] then it came to the time that david was called he um because he was he was there minding his own business and um a messenger came from his dad's house and says hey your dad wants to see you and they would say well okay so he walks into his house and here's this crazy old man with a horn of oil in his hand he looks at david the next king of israel and david looks at him as his oil is poured on his head and you know king of israel yeah huh yeah uh-huh i've heard this one before and so then he says thank you i'm going to go back and take care of the sheep but see god had a plan in his life and david did not know this so he had to go into the in into the king's court and there he had to learn what it was like to rule a kingdom but it got to the place where saul became jealous and then tried to kill david and then david had to run for his life and hid out in caves in different places but see from that point on in david's life he remembered that crazy old man that poured that oil all over his head and said i was going to be the next king well if i'm going to be the next king god has to keep me alive and god has to watch over me and protect me and so and so david over time he developed this confidence in god where he where he believed that what god had said god would bring to pass we go and i i looked at brother i i studied brother branham's life a couple years ago because i was curious in his life and and you know one of these things there's garbage going on in the world about you know believing the sign all this other stupidity once you have a relationship of who brother branham is they can put all this garbage out all they want [Music] i know who he is he was the territories messenger there is no other there's no under coming so if you could if you're gonna you're gonna approach me with that nonsense keep it to yourself i'm not interested okay [Applause] but that but then when you look at brother branham's life he was a renegade i mean he had a temper um some kids beat him up he went home got his gun and also those kids came around the corner and he was a dead shop he says every one of you is dead man he took his rifle and he could have killed every one of them but god stopped that because there was a calling on his life there's other things that went on in his life that all of a sudden it tried brother branham to the place where brother branham had to come to the place in his own life that he had to have total confidence in the god that had called him until it reaches wherever he went he believed god was there he believed god was in charge he believed god was in control and then he listened to god and so he followed that all all through his life so the faith that habakkuk speaks about here it's it's not a faith it's not trying to believe for something but it's coming to a real con a real confiding faith it's one of having a relationship between the creature and its creator where the creature is totally dependent upon his creator where you literally you acknowledge him in all things you praise him for all things and and you believe that no matter what is going on in your life god is going to work it out for your good because that's what god has promised at the end of the book of habakkuk in chapter 3 verses 16 to 18 it goes on here when i heard my belly trembled my lips quivered at the voice rottnest centered into my bones and i trembled in myself that i might rest in the day of trouble when he cometh up unto the people and he will invade them and he will invade with his troops so he was scared i mean when it talks about my lips were covering and i was shaking and i was nervous and i was wondering about you no yeah he was scared because he did not know what tomorrow would bring he did not know when the invasion came if he would survive but god was coming to the place that says for you to survive you have to have total trust in me and for us to survive what's coming we have to come to the place where we have total confidence in our god so it goes on here in habakkuk 3 17 it says although the fig tree shall not blossom neither shall fruit be in the vines the labor of the olives shall fail in the field shall yield no meat the flock shall be cut off from the fold and there shall be no herds in the stall though there be total devastation he goes yet i will rejoice in the lord i will joy in the god of my salvation in the in the commentary that i read it says i will i will not rejoice only but i will shout for joy and not only so but i will bound for joy and not for this time only both words express a drawing of yearning he says yet he says yet more and more i will shout for joy and i will and i will jump for joy and and i would and and and he will he put when he worshipped god from what i can gather from habakkuk he put his whole self into it he would jump and he would shout and he would run around the temple and he would do all kinds of why because he was praising his god and he would do that when he had nothing [Music] so if so if you rejoice in god because of your blessings because your possessions because of the things that you possess and have okay what happens when they're all gone what happens when you're reduced to total poverty because to me that's what's coming i mean i'm not a prophet i can't predict but all i knew is i listened to what brother branham said and there is a destruction coming that this world cannot plan for when california goes under as a result of an earthquake there will be a tidal wave that will sweep the world and hundreds of millions of people will die within 48 to 72 hours florida will be gone california will be gone oregon washington will be gone okay cal from what i understand even even i think phoenix or something like that might even become a seaport um but you have that much demonstration you have the volcanics all of a sudden begin to erupt and you have all this other stuff going and all of and you know it talks about having the mark of the beast he says if you want to buy if you want to sell if you want to go to the grocery store you have to have the mark you have to have this you have to have that on all of us and unless you're going to take the mark of the beast um but what happens when you have nothing can you come to your relationship with god to where if everything else is gone that will not change your relationship and your in your willingness to praise god you know i look at this pandemic and all the stuff that goes and and it disturbs me that people have come to the place they no longer want to gather for worship they just as soon sit at home in their pajamas with their coffee and donuts and sit there and sit there and and scam okay and if that is as far as your relationship with god has come in my opinion you're in deep trouble because if you brother branham says if you love jesus christ you cannot wait for those church doors to open one of the things that i've noticed with it that this pandemic has done and it has it has hindered our fellowship with each other and it's the fellowship that we have with each other that encourages us each each other we could not wait when finally we could get together as a church i mean even if we're only allowed ten and i was well okay this one's not there that means i can go okay i can go and and i told my pastor i got a bad attitude i says i want to go to church and i couldn't and so i was having terrible terrible attitude because i wanted fellowship i wanted to gather together with somebody else where i could join with them in worship and praise to god we can go to walmart we can go to lowe's we can go to we can go to all these other places grocery store i mean it's like in india oh yeah they were shutting it down but then then they would take a transit car that was only supposed to hold maybe 30 or 40 people and they would cram a hundred people in there so they could get to work but yet they wouldn't go to church i'm sorry this doesn't compute but it has to come to the place what is your relationship with jesus christ have you come to have you come to the place in your in your life and your relationship with god that you literally trust him for everything i trust him for my health i trust him to supply my needs i trust him to supply the food that we have i trust him literally for everything and because i put my trust in him he honors that and he sees the cc we just traveled to india i mean to arizona and i went to one place and i ministered a church in phoenix and come to find out the next day when we were traveling to another city come to find out that my translator had come down with covid so we were exposed and then we went to another church and come to find out that after we left there that people there had come down with covid and we were exposed then we went someplace else and came to find out they also came down with covet and we were exposed so for a month we traveled up and down arizona put two thousand miles on the car we rented and we never got sick on anything okay but here again it's i put my trust in him what happens if i get covert tomorrow well then god has a reason for it i have to look at it that way but i'm also trusting him for my health i'm trusting him to supply you know brother battery says you don't know the faith that you've got it's an unconscious matter with you he says could you imagine jesus questioning whether he had the faith or not to to stop the wind or to steal the waves or faith enough to raise lazarus he says brother branham and he swore by himself he makes this statement he says listen i'm going to say something look faith is unconscious he says do you believe it he says i've learned in the years of travel around the world and meeting the people of all different walks but faith is unconscious you've got faith and you don't even know it that's right he said jesus christ no matter if he was in a storm and the gale was knocking the boat from one side to the other or he was standing in the face of a mess of demons if he was hanging anywhere it just never moved him he walked right along just as calm and quiet as he could be why he was simply unconscious of fear of anything around him he said that's right whether it's going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he knew it was going to happen because god had said so he didn't say oh i wonder if i prayed through i wonder if i fasted long enough i wonder if i did this he said no he just walked right along unconscious that's right he believed what god he believed what god said was true and the words and and the words must be fulfilled we living in the time when the when we are in the bright age the world is in ladies we're in the bright age and there's there are there's a word that the bride itself has to fulfill revelations 10 7 the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god is going to be finished we are that mystery [Music] we are that mystery what what is the mystery that paul said he says the mystery is christ living in you where god was coming and where god would come [Applause] where god would come and he would sanctify a people where he himself could so come and live in them until it was no longer them living but christ living his life through them but see that's where we have to come but in order for that to happen we have to have faith in god we have to come to having a relationship with god himself that we literally trust him for everything i know when we landed in arizona i had i had a scheduled mello made out and we had to change that schedule seven times in a month we the day before we landed the place we were going to stay was no longer available so we had to stay someplace else but god orchestrated that because he had a reason for that then we were going to go do something else and all of a sudden something else came up as well that takes care of that plan so let's go ahead and go up here so we went up there and then god had orchestrated that and then we wanted to go someplace else and that wouldn't work out so okay well let's change our plans and let's do this and so god had orchestrated that and so we kept changing and changing but i i had come to the place and i still try and be in that place where it doesn't matter what tomorrow brings it says that whatever it brings okay i will adjust to that because god has a reason for that and i've had to learn to become comfortable with all of a sudden my my plans being changed at a moment's notice but see jesus christ he walked around he didn't matter he said because he knew that the word that he was to fulfill had to be fulfilled but see there's a word that we are to fulfill we are to be the final voice to the final age we are to be the final manifestation to go into this world until god takes us home because you are the only jesus christ this world is going to sing and so they have to see the life of god living itself out through you it's not you you know people say well i'm trying to live a christian life you'll never succeed because you're trying because you're trying no god doesn't want you to try and live a christian life he wants you to die to yourself so that he can live through you because see his life is the only one that he will accept and so if you die out to yourself and you let him live his life through you then it's no longer you living but now it's christ living his life through you and that's what god is trying to do what happened to brother brown's life in ministry he managed to he managed to come to a place in his own life where he totally surrendered to the god that lived in him until wherever he went it was no longer him living but it was christ living his life through him he was still a man he still had imperfections he still had all the problems that men have okay i mean i mean when you when you listen to it to the things that he said but he had come to a place in his life that he realized it could no longer be him living but now it had to be god living through him but see that has to come to us now you stick it in the prophet and leave it there no that's not that that wasn't the idea god could take a sinner god could take a man with a hot temper and god could sit there and sow mold and so remake him until he became the very image of jesus christ and so god could do that in a prophet's life why can't he do it in the rest of us [Applause] you know you know when we talk about when we talk about brother brandon went beyond the curtain of time because sometimes he said oh yeah he said he says oh yeah he's there there'll be one in charlotte and there'll be one in in in in in detroit and there'll be one in in chicago and you know one one here one here one here and i figure well basically that leaves me out but then he says beyond the curtain of time he says and there were thousands well now hey that gives me hope because i'm one of those thousands i'm one of those thousands which are there on the other side and i ran up to him and said precious brother because i was in that vision you know one of the things i've learned in in studying the message is you know what you see is not really me what you do is you see the tabernacle i dwell in but see the real me is my theophany on the other side and see that's what that's what brother branham saw he saw my theophany there and it's my theophany calling me to become what i am so so don't look at yourself because what you see is not the real you the real you is that the offending which was a part of god from the beginning and that the often is calling you to a higher plane to a higher level where all of a sudden you become what god said that you are the bible says god has predestinated us to be conformed to the image of his son predestinated means my predetermined end is to be totally in in the very image of jesus christ which means i will have the same character that he had he wasn't talking about power he was talking about character the same love the same joy the same peace the same long suffering the same gentleness because see it's it's in the character that christ is glorified it's in the character that the world is looking for they see all this other garbage out there but they're looking for something that's real and the only real one is jesus christ and if you can if you can surrender your life to god and let him live his life through you then they will find the reality that they're looking for okay brother branham and the god who is rich in mercy he said he says i'm only saying this to straighten it out that you might get away from this fear and the scare you don't know who you are you're not going to be but now you are the sons of god see you always were the sons of god for when god had you in his thinking in the beginning you have to be some part of your house has to be a part of him but he says he says the problem is he says we have this fear and there's scared and and say when i looked at when i watched when i studied brother branham's life when brother branham was born he was born to be the prophet to this age no question but there was training that he had to go through first he had to accept christ as his savior and until that had happened there was there was nothing god could do with him but he once accepted christ and he then he became a baptist preacher and he went down to the river he's baptizing some people he had differences with his pastor and uh so he went down he started his own church he rented a sonic lodge or something like that and he was down at the end of the street and he was baptizing and all of a sudden this light came down and spoke and says as john the baptist four around the first coming christ you have a message that will forerun a second and brother braham says you know i was just standing there when god came he says it's not about me it's about the god that came and so then he then when they when they they made this the branham tabernacle he put a little thing in there and god spoke to him do the work of an evangelist so that's what he started doing he was as a baptist and he was studying his word he was preaching on a regular basis and stuff like that but god was keeping to give him visions and he said these visions he says everybody tells me this is of the devil so i don't want to be having anything of the devil but he knows that every vision always came to pass so he came to the place where he began to trust in those visions and then he would go along a little later on in his life and he was reading and and he was studying and he looked at how god dealt with prophets he says well the same way that god spoke to them is the same way god's speaking to me therefore i must be a prophet and then he acknowledged that and for lack of a better way of expressing it he walked into that and then he and then when discernment came he said oh he says there's a scriptural reference to this that's abraham abraham and sarah and then he would say oh yeah so this is see this is it me but he says this is the god in me and he would turn his back to the audience and say say i want to show you christ is here he says it's not about me he said he says jesus christ is here he's just using my body and he stepped into that office but he always in in his tapes he always he always mentioned that he believed that billy graham was to be the messenger to this age but then when kennedy got elected he went back to his visions books and he says the women's vote got this guy into office and man look at my all these visions they've almost all been fulfilled so then he preached the church ages and that's when the angel at the end of that he says now you read malachi 4. and he came to the revelation i have to be that messenger but he also made mention of the fact he says when the seventh angel begins to sound he says that seven the angel did not begin to sound until the opening of the seals he said and from that point on he says a message has been committed to me that i must be obedient to from that point on he was no longer it was no longer him saying what he wanted to say no it was god no speaking through him but now apply that to us when you were born you were sons and daughters of god you always were sons and daughters of god okay if you're if you have salvation you had to be a part of god from the beginning okay but he says we have this fear and this scare we're not willing to step into what we are we are now willing to claim i am the bride of jesus christ i am a member of the body of jesus christ and and god is trying to live his life and manifest himself through me and there are certain scriptures that the bride itself must fulfill because the angel told john he says go ahead and take the book because you have to eat that book until you literally you and the word becomes one and when you and the word become one he says because you must you the bride must prophesy before many nations tongues and kings and people but that's what we have to be doing this is the ministry that we have to fulfill so we have to be willing to acknowledge who we are we have to be willing to acknowledge that i am a son and daughter not looking at myself not looking at my faults and my shortcomings and all the things that go with being huma being humanity but i have to look beyond that and says god you have said that i am you have told me i am the very righteousness of you because i am in you and now lord you have a ministry you have something you're wanting me to fulfill you want me to witness to the world that you are alive you want me to witness to the world that you heal you want me to witness to the world that that you that you are still god and you are still the god of miracles so wherever you go in the things that you do your life is supposed to be a testimony of jesus christ i know we we joined a senior choir i guess that's what i call it um there's a bunch of us old folks that get together at church and we sing songs and there's uh at at any point in time there's 26 differently not different churches represented and some of them are are seven day adventists and some of them are jehovah witness and some of them are baptist some of them are pentecostal and some of them are i don't know what but they all we all have one thing in common we love jesus christ that's why we get together and sing there's we don't discuss doctrines no we we get together and one heart and one mind and one accord we sing songs to praise the god that we love and there was a month ago i guess it's been it turned around people began to testify there was one lady there that had mentioned the fact that she had no money she was she had hardly any gas in her car and she had to get around and do different things so she takes a bottle of oil and she put it on her car and she says lord i'm anointing my car i need for it to run for the next whatever this period was without me putting any gas in it i don't know how many miles she drove on an empty tank but she drove along quite a bit she was she could testify she could testify that god honored her request and allowed her to drive on an empty tank for probably a week or two that's the faith she had in god you know brother branham makes mention of the fact that he was flying home and as they were flying over memphis tennessee um all of a sudden either there was a storm or whatever the problem was and his flight was grounded and uh so okay they put him up in a nice hotel and in the morning they were going to pick him up and fly him home and so he's out there he's going to mail a letter or do something and all of a sudden god told him keep walking and brother branham began to question it but he says they're going to he says no walk but but he says no don't question just do it walk yes so he walked and he walked and walked and came into the poor section of town and there there was there was this lady there and as she walked by and she looked um she addressed him and said morning parson and so brother ram stops and says says auntie he says how'd you know i was a parson he says well i fell asleep last night and god showed me you were coming god spoke to her and showed her exactly the way he was going to be dressed she says i'm that pseudomite woman and i prayed for god send me the elijah she had a relationship with god that allowed for her prayer to bring that plane down so that god could prophet could go and minister to her she didn't know how to rebel she he asked i'm my brother brandon have you heard of me nope never heard of you before oh do you understand the seven seals right you've got a revelation of the seventh seal do you understand the tent vision right you've got you finally got a revelation of the ten division right no she knew jesus christ she had a relationship with jesus christ that allowed her prayer to reach god for god to bring that plane down so brother branham could go and minister to her and the question i always have is do we have the same level of trust have we come to a place in our relationship with jesus christ that we believe in that we believe that the promises god has given to us god will act upon all of them for our good lord and that's a challenge and one last thing my wife and i we were flying to india i guess it was 2021 i guess now 2020. okay anyway time flies when you're having fun anyway i was sitting in a church uh about a week or a month before i forget what it was and i was just opening my bible and trying to be quiet and prepare myself for the service and i opened up to isaiah the 31 and verses one to three and i'll just read part of it it says in 31 and one it says woe to them that go down to egypt for help and stay on horses and trust in chariots because they're many and in horsemen because they're very strong but they look not to the holy one of israel neither seek the lord and verse three it says now the egyptians are men and not god and their horses are flesh and not spirit and so that it came down here he god at this point in in in the life of israel and anyway the king which was there um he had been over he had been surrounded by by the king of babylon and uh he didn't have enough manpower to be able to defend the city so he was going to go go to egypt and go down and give them some money and hey come give us a hand and so isaiah went to that went to the minister hezekiah was that was it was the the king at that time and and isaiah said don't go to egypt trust god for i for hezekiah to put total reliance upon god for deliverance was asking a lot because his whole city his whole nation was at stake but he did and then god delivered so anyway so my wife and i we were flying we landed we took off from one of the cities landed in in london and uh made our connecting flight so we're looking at a good eight to ten hour flight from london into hyderabad and uh the food isn't what it used to be but food's still food and so they serve it normally speaking about an hour and a half after they take off because they all want to go to sleep because it's a night flight and i noticed well i was hungry always and so i was eating and my wife she wasn't eating anything she wasn't even touching it i said well honey what's wrong with that she says well i still got this severe headache when we when we landed in london i guess the fumes and all the stuff that was there it just says i just got this really bad headache and i just can't eat and so i said well okay in another four or six hours we'll land in hyderabad we got some pills there in our luggage you know in the belly of the plane i said then you'll go to bed and get some sleep and you know and you'll be fine within a day or so because she has these periodically or did have and then knockout said god reminded me what i read in isaiah woe to them that go down to egypt for help why do you always rely on yourself why do you always rely upon your own abilities why is it you think you can take care of it yourself he said the egyptians are men they're not god and the horses are flesh they're not spirit man is limited we can only do so much but god is unlimited so god says trust me this time okay so i prayed for surely i said well we're on a trip and we've satan is harassing us and i'm asking for mercy lord i want you to touch my wife and remove this headache well within an hour or so the headache began to go away and before we landed she was fine but see god god was trying to teach me don't rely on yourself and the things that happened on that trip to india if we had not relied upon god we probably wouldn't be here but god all through that whole trip he says you must trust me not trust in this not trusting that no you must put your trust in me because i am the only one that is going to survive i'm the only one that's going to take care of you and see you to the end of this journey so like i say god's been trying to teach me this and i'm coming to the place i'm i haven't graduated yet but i'm hoping you know i'm working my way through the sophomore year maybe but you know it's trying to come to the grasp into the into the into the understanding that if i ca and this is the way i look at habakkuk if i take my hand and i put my hand in his as a child to his father and i trust totally in my father for my very existence and for memory very sustenance and for everything that i have and everything that i'm needing that he says he will take care of me and that's the relate that that is what i got out of when i did in my study in havaka and so that's basically what i try to practice i says okay lord we've got problems coming up now lord i don't know how you're going to provide or supply but okay you said you would okay so now i'm waiting for you to do it it's like with healing well lord you told me i'm healed okay well obviously i am now i'm just waiting for its manifestation because you have to honor your word you cannot lie and so if you're going to honor your word and you told me i'm healed obviously i am now i'm just waiting for it to come into manifestation and see this this is what god has been dealing with me in my life and like i say this study in havoc it changed my whole concept of faith it's not trying to believe for something but it's coming to have it believing in someone to the place where i can put total trust and total confidence in him let's just pray heavenly father we thank you for having been with us this evening and i trust what you've put through my mind and my mouth lord i trust it's been a blessing unto the people because lord what i see coming into this world lord there is no hope outside of you and so lord what's going to happen tomorrow we don't know but lord we know you've already been there and since you've already been there you already know what's coming and so lord if we put our hands in yours we're trusting you to take care of us and to watch over us and to provide for us so take this group of people lord and bless them i pray bless the pastor and and and lord just let it prosper and grow the lord could become a lighthouse into the area in which they live grant this lord for i ask it in jesus most precious name amen [Applause] [Applause] blessed be the name of the lord how many enjoy the service amen let's stand do you keep realizing something you keep realizing that you realize it more and more so you should have more confidence now because you know who's running it right he was not here on sunday amen ask him i didn't tell him anything about what i preached on sunday amen the holy spirit is coming back again keep telling you take your hand off your life take your hand off your life stop struggling stop worrying stop trying to figure it out stop fighting leave this stuff alone just trust in god and he will do everything amen take second corinthians 3. hallelujah you heard about faith you heard about origin you heard it all amen all this pressure that is coming up god wants you to learn to depend on him because when everything will collapse it's not going to bother you you'll be ready for the hour amen remember sunday leave the humanistic level get into the realm of faith he was not there the holy spirit bring it right straight to the point again in other words god is insisting god is telling somebody stop what you have been doing he's insisting that stop if not he's going to break you if you don't understand i'm not saying he's going to kill you but he will until you realize that you have no power you know when somebody get in the river what do they do sometime if they try to get him he's going to kill you once you get there he will step on you and he will try to breathe they usually let him a little bit get some water water then when he's tired or hope he's gone then the master get in and pull him outside amen if you are you still want to go fight thank god no problem we'll continue to pray for you but you need to stop amen stop if god call you to do something invest yourself into it and give him the first place and you will see what god will do hard thing for people to believe amen we always try to make sense i have to be here i have to do this i have to do this yes you have been doing like that for 10 years what is the result that you get can you at least try once try the second time and see how it works amen do you want to try you never even try to ask for a change of schedule because there is no desire to be in church if you were desiring to be in church desiring to be in church if it's burning it might push you to at least say can i be able to at least on wednesday if i can finish early and then i can go to church did you try that no you just conformed to the humanistic level in the humanistic level that's the way it is it's eight hours i gotta be there god i understand he knows my heart that's it no pushing for something amen you know with the lack of employment the salary of the people went higher because people do not want work so the people they hire newly make more money than those that have been there and those that have been there don't do anything they keep working they don't understand that the new one that came and making more money you see what i'm saying and you're doing the same thing but somebody's getting paid sooner more than you and you've been there for years why got used to something and not aware of something amen amen if god call you something give him the first place try the preeminence and you will see amen you can do it in one shot or you can do it in five i had a patient on monday and i had a procedure to do on monday and there was a saint that wanted me to pray for him on friday don't get an appointment and everything and then i needed some equipment for that specific patient when i call they say the equipment will come on friday and i need to pray for somebody on friday i call the person and say you know what can we change the schedule a little bit so i can come later and the person turn around and say pastor you can just speak the word amen and look i say i appreciate your faith i appreciate your faith but i told you i'm going to be there amen i sleep in first and give that the preeminence and went and pray for that person and came back to the office and the gps came earlier and they missed me what would the devil tell me you see you could have tell that person you can come back later and then you will get the package first and go right because on monday you have a procedure get broad guess what happened on monday the procedure was not done if i would have given that patient preeminence on sun on one on friday who will be condemned on monday you see what i'm saying you see what i'm saying the one who knew told me give the preeminence here he knew that patient is he's not going to do it i thought somebody if you get down my road it's going to be tough because you're going to be tightened harder and it's the way it is it's not easy trusting in the lord amen it's usually when everything is going against you and contrary and it seems like nothing is working that's the time you give the most preeminence to god and when god does something one time to you it's going to be like abseil in your life you will never forget it when something happened you will be using that spot like like an ankle god you did it there david used it he said the girl that helped me kill the lion do you think it's easy to kill a lion have you seen a lion before have you seen a bear ask brother robert we went to a store to get the carpet brother mike daley asked him a big bear it's even high like double my size i was like wait a minute this thing is huge and david kill it if you if he can kill that thing what was goliath you see what i'm saying so sometimes god bring things in life and go with you higher like let's go let's go let's see how higher you can go and before you know it we drop he said he's still in level two let's try again trust him one time and see what god will do give him a preemie and when you do that the devil would automatically challenge you to show you that if because you did it look what is happening if you hold tight you're gonna learn one thing in your life it's gonna help you through your marriage through your trouble through everything you'll begin to use the same weapon and keep using it when it happened you use the same gun and keep moving just one experience all it takes is just one amen but we so caught up into this we want to justify everything we're doing no the lord understand i have to do this so i'm not going to do this the lord understand i'm going to do this but i'm going to go this the lord understands if everybody dies like that who's going to be even in church here everybody will be at home we got stuff to do we got a streaming i will stay home the lord understand i'm going through this i can stream i didn't miss the service i'm up today the pastor asked every day i'm still up today but i'm now coming to church you see what is going on that uh that presence here is different than in your home i gave you a quote here when we started this church brother branham say angel stays in the church you remember that's why the atmosphere in the church is different how can the holy ghost tell you when the day approaching do not forsake the assembly so the holy ghost already seen that it's going to be a spirit of people that's going to forsake the assembly as the day approaching so somebody's fulfilling a prophecy but i'm going to fulfill mine i'm going to be on the one that's not going to forsake the assembly of the church second corinthians chapter 3. church please take your hand off your life the brother speak clearly do not look at yourself do not look at yourself the day the holy ghost will give me signal to go through justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost you will see how many errors you did on looking at yourself amen do you think when god called you he didn't know who you are he didn't know your failure when they say oh david a man after my own heart we think like david was perfect how did they grab paul going to kill people how can you get somebody who has been causing havoc holding christians putting them in jail going even in the road to kill somebody in that very moment of anger the the scriptures say he was angry raging for the christian what kind of prayer did paul do to bring god to his sin he was operating in a humanistic level religiously humanistic what prayer did paul do who prayed for him who prayed for paul so what happened in act nine god told paul you were a chosen vessel that's all that's all the matter a chosen vessel right in the middle of raging battle he turned him up and turned him 360 opposite direction and he become even the most deadly weapon ever if he get there the jews are in trouble if he get in a synagogue the jews are imprisoned the very man that was sitting under the command of the high priest what else can paul trust that's why paul when he went higher he say everything that i ever learned humanistic down now i am in a different level amen second corinthians 3 verse 2 ye are our pistol written in our hearts known and read off that's what the brother told you for as much as he are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us now he explained it plainly written not with ink but with the so the spirit can write what is the pain the spirit used somebody called it you know the pain the spirit is you will see it on sunday amen written not with ink but paul say we are written in peace right right so how was paul writing what was paul using to write in the people's tongue so paul was coming and do a surgery and right amen written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of though and such trust have we through christ to god's word amen not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is off anybody clear learn to depend on god for every thing even if you lost your pain learn to pray lord help me find a pain don't say the pain is easy i can do it god can complicate it and you won't find it amen it's easy because god allows you to find it learn to depend on god in everything that you do remember your relationship put trust on the one that you gave your heart to and remember his word would never fail heaven and earth will pass away but his word will never never never fail if you have that confidence on god's word then you will understand why peter say that word amen because somebody learned through experience that when he say something it happened when he say something it happened when he say something it happened at that word that it if he says it i'm not questioning it anymore i'm not going to question it i will go straight ahead and do what he say and if you apply the bible like that you will see what he's going to do that's that's that's what brother branham was trying all along to bring the people to bring the people to a perfect confidence in the bible where somebody look at the promise and just pick it up from there and that's it and he can bring anything that he wanted just using the scripture because this is god's eternal word this is god who spoke god cannot even god cannot take back what he spoke the bible say when it's revealed it belongs to who he belongs to who so this doesn't belong to god anymore he was in him he spoke it so he doesn't belong to him anymore he belongs to me and my children everybody here so this is my property now so whatever god say here he cannot take it back if i hold him here he's in trouble if i just hold him here he's in trouble if you want to use what does the lawyer do to the law they just hold to one law and they can bring that case down and pin it down and you say it's the greatest lawyer he knows how to hang on the law amen the city can say whatever they want to say but if you find a law in the city that gives you right over the city you can hang on to that law and say this is what the law say you need to leave my property right now the city will leave i don't care how many police officers are there how many sheriffs out there they're gonna be living because somebody recognized the right period that's the same thing with this word amen if you understand it belongs to you you can cling into one thing we let god sleep like the disciple and god continued to sleep until they recognized we need to wake him up and say we got in trouble who are he amen that lady could have slipped he woke god up god look he said where is elijah say go find elijah quickly and bring him over there because somebody's in trouble amen learn to depend in god amen let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us lord i'm so glad because this is not a work of man it is the working of the holy spirit through the body father we can see how you working in a special elected ministry lord that you are bringing now everything together where your prophet says that we're going to speak one language father the brother was not here he didn't

power where you can show your glory where you can show your magnificence where you can show your serving power when you can show how you can bless somebody because you explain it lord father

all over the scripture so that your children lord father will lack nothing and in the time of need we know lord father that you are that present help lord may you help us lord climb higher from the humanistic ground lord and may we lord father stay in the reigns of the revelation lord like your prophet said that it means more than we all realize lord it is true lord father the church shall live

human element lord that everything should be under the control and we follow nothing else by the leadership of the holy spirit because those that are the sons of god are led by the spirit of god father bless your children for the sacrifice lord father driving and coming lord father on wednesday evening lord father you know some have job to do some have children some have probably sickness of different things they have been battling throughout the day lord but lord father you came and spoke to us lord and if you can speak about faith lord certainly there is somebody that is in trouble certainly there is somebody who is in need certainly there is somebody who's looking for a leadership lord who's looking for a help lord father a deliverance somewhere lord father we don't want to let this opportunity go lord but we want to work on this procession lord based on lord father the scripture and the sermon that you spoke to your children father i pray that every request that have been brought to lord father in the heart of your children in the presence of the mighty and holy god tonight lord father may you granted unto them in the name of jesus christ because you are our provider you have jehovah jarrah we are your children you are our father lord we're looking unto thee who is the author and the finisher of our faith lord father lord jesus christ may nobody depart from this place lord without having that which they ask lord may they never look at the circumstances may they never look at the symptom may they never look at lord father or who they are but may we always lord

in the church lord and remember us as we commit the rest of the week unto the hand lord as we continue lord father under the leadership of the holy spirit to be consecrated lord father and to draw
