[39:55] but inside of you you love God
[39:58] you are children of the Lord you don't
[40:00] mean to do bad you are just trapping the
[40:02] body that is waiting for Redemption
[40:06] therefore there is no condemnation to
[40:09] those who are in Christ Jesus who walk
[40:12] not after the flesh amen but after the
[40:15] spirit of the Lord you pray so that
[40:17] Lord's willing on Sunday we're going to
[40:19] dig now deeper and to see where you are

[40:29] talking to God you are The Offspring of
[40:32] God Amen to begin with we are
[40:37] computer programmed by
[40:39] God I can prove it to you it took
[40:43] brother Bram to explain this and to
[40:44] remove all the confusion all around amen
[40:48] the way we are wir we are computer we
[40:51] have trained the body we have trained
[40:54] the spirit but we never were trained in
[40:57] the
[40:59] Soul because the soul is a different
[41:02] entity and religion got into it to try
[41:05] to train the soul and confuse the
[41:10] soul now when we say faith everybody
[41:13] think on their own thing what is Faith
[41:16] sometime he works sometime he doesn't
[41:18] work why is he working sometime and
[41:21] sometime it's not working there are
[41:23] stuff that are hidden right there I'm
[41:26] not the one preaching
[41:28] amen why is he working sometime why you
[41:31] pray and he work why you pray sometime
[41:34] he doesn't
[41:37] work that's true Lord's willing we need
[41:40] to go back to the prayer of Jesus
[41:42] Christ amen and you will see why what is
[41:47] going on Amen it takes a prophet if not
[41:50] even in this message sometime we say I
[41:52] have faith I have faith I have faith and
[41:54] something happened boom you Bast start
[41:55] you start crying right did you really
[41:57] have faith but when Faith really comes
[42:01] it's because the soul is a complete
[42:04] different complex entity that was never
[42:07] been touched until the Prophet come and
[42:11] the seals are broken amen that's the
[42:14] only way you can get to the soul amen we
[42:17] train everything we never train the soul
[42:20] the soul is you but it's a powerful
[42:23] you that doesn't work with you it works
[42:26] a different
[42:29] way amen amen glory glory glory to God
[42:34] so remember Romans 7 and go to Roman 8
[42:37] and then no condemnation then we can
[42:39] manifest the son of man and then when we
[42:42] do it we getting ready for the body

[46:08] that you just speak on what you reveal
[46:10] Lord God I leave everything onto you in
[46:12] Jesus Christ name I pray
[46:21] amen hello
[46:24] and if we could go to First King Chapter
[46:27] 19 Verse
[46:42] 5 if you're there can you say amen
[46:45] amen now first king first king chapter
[46:48] 19 verse5
[46:51] says and as he lay and slept under a
[46:54] Jenifer tree behold then an angel
[46:56] touched him and said unto him arise and
[47:00] eat and he looked and behold there was
[47:03] cake bacing on the co and he Cruise of
[47:07] what and a cruise of
[47:08] water at his head and he did eat and
[47:12] drink and laid him down again and the
[47:14] angel of the Lord came again the second
[47:17] time and touched him and said arise and
[47:21] eat because the journey is
[47:24] great and because the journey is great
[47:28] for thee and he arose and did eat and
[47:30] drink and went in the strength of that
[47:33] meat 40 days and 40 nights onto her up
[47:36] the Mount of God may the Lord God bless
[47:38] the reading of his
[47:40] word last time we also read in first in
[47:44] John chapter 4 verse
[47:47] 32 and we spoke about how Jesus the
[47:51] disciples asked
[47:53] him um did he eat and he said that he
[47:57] did eat and they asked what type of food
[47:59] did you eat and Jesus said that the food
[48:02] that he ate was um the will of God to do
[48:05] the will of God that's the type of food
[48:06] that he ate and the prophet of God said
[48:09] the journey that Elijah Was preparing
[48:11] was for a tribulation was representing
[48:13] tribulation and we're talking about how
[48:16] we're trying to find out what type of
[48:17] food that is so without Ado I'm going to
[48:20] talk about Divine eating part three
[48:22] going beyond your limit I didn't really
[48:25] think I was going to do three parts for
[48:27] the Lord God
[48:29] knows now last time when we spoke we
[48:32] spoke about how you can't serve God and
[48:34] Mayon you can't be you may be
[48:37] seated we spoke about how you can't you
[48:40] can't um divide your mind you can't
[48:43] worship God and worship man at the same
[48:45] time you can't worship God and worship
[48:46] the world and the prophet even gave an
[48:48] analogy of a deaf blind man who stood
[48:51] for God Al he was
[48:53] deaf and then we also got into how what
[48:57] you eat is what identifies you and what
[48:59] you eat is what also strengthens you and
[49:01] we also typed it with uh the armor of
[49:04] God that when you're eating spiritually
[49:07] it strengthens your Spiritual armor and
[49:09] not only does it strengthen your your
[49:11] Spiritual armor it helps you prevent
[49:14] certain attacks of the devil and he also
[49:16] helps you so you can fight the um the
[49:19] devil when they come so he helps you to
[49:21] pre to prevent it as in in a defensive
[49:24] aspect and he also helps you attack on
[49:26] off
[49:27] off and then we talked about how Through
[49:31] Your Eyes what you look at what you hear
[49:33] and all that it goes He feeds your inner
[49:35] man it feeds your your spiritual man and
[49:37] everything that you do goes into the
[49:39] heart and it's not what what goes in
[49:43] that defiles man but what comes out and
[49:44] we also spoke about how what the only
[49:47] thing good inside a man's heart is God
[49:50] and where we stopped that was at healing
[49:53] because people when they hear healing
[49:55] they just tend to think about the
[49:56] physical body and I want to pick up from
[49:59] that uh from where we left off on
[50:01] healing because as I was studying the
[50:04] scripture because we got to the part
[50:07] where healing also means correcting
[50:09] correcting of character and when I was
[50:11] reading in second
[50:14] king it was in second king
[50:18] verse second king chapter 5 when Elisha
[50:21] the king of Syria came to him King nonon
[50:24] came to Elisha and after that he was
[50:26] sick he was suffering from leprosy and
[50:28] then Elijah didn't like take him and
[50:32] after that started healing him and pray
[50:34] for him so he can heal automatically he
[50:36] sent out his word and when he sent out
[50:38] his word the word that God gave him and
[50:41] the King when the king received that
[50:42] word and he obeyed the word his sickness
[50:45] left him and when the pastor or anyone
[50:49] that has um that's under authority of
[50:52] the Lord God and he's bringing forth the
[50:55] word of God when that word comes forth
[50:57] and is's telling you to do a certain
[50:58] things and you do it it shall also
[51:00] deliver you not only deliver you from
[51:02] your uh physical sickness but from your
[51:05] spiritual sickness also and it took it
[51:08] took uh the king of Syria seven dips
[51:11] into Jordan which Jordan represents
[51:13] separation he took him seven dips into
[51:15] the Jordan so he can be completely clean
[51:18] and we found out that the word of God
[51:21] that comes that comes to correct and
[51:24] remove when it comes to correct removes
[51:27] the bad things from us little by
[51:33] little and I wanted to connect it with
[51:36] uh what brother Brenham said in
[51:38] 1961 jary 8 in Revelation chap 4 part 3
[51:41] he says now let's take Matthew 10 verse
[51:45] one and when he called unto him his 12
[51:47] disciples he gave them power oh just
[51:51] pacify the baby just a minute now just
[51:53] listen listen close and gave them power
[51:56] against unclean spirits many pastors
[51:59] just let the unclean Spirit stay right
[52:01] in his church women dress ax card cart
[52:05] parties Bunko games dances soap serer
[52:09] every oh mercy against unclean Spirit to
[52:11] cast them out and to heal all manner of
[52:14] sickness and all manner of diseases see
[52:17] when God when God sent out uh send his
[52:21] disciples with he gave them power to
[52:23] send them out he said to heal all manner
[52:26] of sickness and all manner of diseases
[52:29] that mean because some some people have
[52:32] different characteristic that like
[52:34] different habits I I could say they have
[52:37] different habits that they do and to
[52:39] them it's like normal but and some
[52:42] people like um there's no cure for
[52:45] habits that's what people thinktime they
[52:47] said there's no cure for habits oh that
[52:49] habits is just the way I am or it's the
[52:51] way God built us but we found out even
[52:54] last Sunday when God came when they
[52:57] uh when the prodal saw rather when he
[52:59] went and after he sin he came back with
[53:01] his complex he came back talking about
[53:03] his sin what he did and then the father
[53:06] said he came and that started tell he
[53:08] was trying to remove the sin out of him
[53:11] by telling him that you're my son but he
[53:13] kept saying but I have sinned I have
[53:15] sinned and when the when the message was
[53:17] coming forth I remember uh a revelation
[53:19] Job saying that we're not going to enter
[53:21] into Heaven until our Amnesia is removed
[53:25] until all of our sin is removed
[53:27] God already paid this God already paid
[53:29] the price for us he already died on the
[53:31] cross so technically our sin is already
[53:33] removed all you have to do is just claim
[53:35] that claim that Victory claim that
[53:39] Clement I have to do just claim it and
[53:41] when you claim it then every like your
[53:44] race already started once you claim it
[53:46] you just keep moving
[53:49] forward and the word of God when it
[53:51] comes yes it comes correct but it's also
[53:54] a type of washing
[53:56] it's also a Tope of watching and this
[53:59] was actually the last quote that we
[54:00] stopped at it
[54:02] says it says so we just sing until the
[54:05] last one is singed out and then Jesus
[54:08] will come how do we know who they are
[54:11] you just throw the gospel net and throw
[54:14] it that's why I come here with my
[54:16] brethren stand on the corner somewhere
[54:18] and throw the net with them reach out
[54:21] with my Ministry and pull it out and
[54:24] pull it and say there they are bre what
[54:26] is it now but this is the burn over
[54:29] territory did you notice back there when
[54:32] I first come to you in Oregon people
[54:34] were people was coming from everywhere
[54:37] thousands time thousands couting in oh
[54:40] it was fine it was I was just going
[54:42] along praying for the sick but when I
[54:45] come back and begin to lay the truth
[54:48] down laying the gospel down oh many
[54:50] turned turned aside right compare that
[54:53] with the days gone by with our Lord when
[54:56] he was Healing The Sick and The
[54:58] Afflicted many people come to him and
[55:01] when he fed 5,000 many people came right
[55:05] but when he began to sit down and tell
[55:08] them the truth what happened all of them
[55:11] began to turn away he be even the 70s
[55:14] even turn you see when the word comes
[55:16] people tend to get hurt one of the um
[55:21] one of the main key points that I
[55:23] remember ever since our church first
[55:24] began when the word was coming forth he
[55:26] said whenever a word comes and you don't
[55:29] understand it just say Amen if it's in
[55:30] the Bible and it's in the message say
[55:32] Amen if you don't understand it just say
[55:34] Amen later on it will
[55:37] come yes sir later on later on the
[55:40] revelation will come to you in due time
[55:43] and the other thing that was the first
[55:45] one the second was if the word is coming
[55:47] and it's hurtful and it it hurts you
[55:50] don't just get up and leave just stay
[55:52] there and the more you stay there it's
[55:54] going to change you slowly and slowly
[55:56] just stay there don't just get up and
[55:58] leave because people tend because of our
[56:01] natural flesh we don't like to be
[56:03] corrected we don't like to feel pain we
[56:04] don't like to be hurt there's a lot of
[56:07] people when the moment they see
[56:08] something that's going to hurt them they
[56:10] automatically start backing away out of
[56:12] it's like out of
[56:15] instinct
[56:18] sir and I'm really thankful that the
[56:21] Lord God sent out his word lately so he
[56:24] can Purge that little complex and that
[56:26] characteristic of
[56:31] us in in 1957 the lamb and the dog
[56:34] brother brandom said oh brother I know
[56:37] it's um sickening to you but my Mom this
[56:41] is actually um when brother brandham
[56:43] used to eat and after that he would get
[56:45] like a skin outbreak their mother would
[56:48] give them castoral and brother Brandon
[56:50] would tell his mom he would tell his mom
[56:52] well that gets me sick it hurts my
[56:53] stomach and everything now this is this
[56:55] is um brother Brandon's mom responding
[56:58] to brother Brandon telling her telling
[57:00] her oh it makes my stomach sick she says
[57:03] she said honey if it doesn't make you
[57:06] sick it doesn't do any good to you so
[57:09] maybe I'll apply that to the gospel
[57:11] tonight if it doesn't steer the church
[57:13] up and make you a little sick and
[57:15] ashamed of yourself it might it might
[57:17] not do you too much good what we need
[57:20] today is The Good Old Time Gospel
[57:22] cleaning
[57:23] that's that's exactly right
[57:26] taking all the world out of the church
[57:29] and putting Christ back on the throne of
[57:31] the heart now if you would like to have
[57:34] the dove of God to come to your heart
[57:37] tonight you say brother brandom I used
[57:39] to have those feelings I used to just
[57:42] love to pray I used to love to talk
[57:45] about the Lord but I've got to a place
[57:47] where I don't want I don't want them to
[57:50] talk to me about it oh I go to church
[57:53] now and then because I don't want to go
[57:55] to hell
[57:57] but but you're you're sure not making a
[58:00] very good this brother Bri talking
[58:01] you're sure you're sure not making a
[58:03] very good act to keep away from it as in
[58:06] keep keep away from hell that's right
[58:09] you say I would like to be back now I'm
[58:13] not I'm not I preached hard to you
[58:15] tonight and scold you but look brother
[58:18] it's for your good that's right it's for
[58:21] your good it's to help you I love you
[58:23] see last time we also spoke about how
[58:25] correct is also love because the Bible
[58:27] says correction is love and a child of
[58:31] dis like a child of disobedient doesn't
[58:33] like correction they run away from
[58:36] correction and and brother brandom
[58:39] saying that if it doesn't hurt you that
[58:41] mean it's not doing anything to you
[58:43] there's a lot of people that just come
[58:44] to church just to feel comfortable just
[58:46] to sit down and feel comfortable just to
[58:49] help have people baby them into their
[58:51] emotion it's kind of like I remember
[58:53] seeing online an article or so were
[58:56] there are psychiatrist and stuff like
[58:58] that instead of attacking the issues
[59:00] especially when it comes to like um
[59:03] people with their gender dys phobia or
[59:07] gender identity crisis instead of
[59:09] targeting and telling them that that's a
[59:12] disorder that's not normal they start
[59:15] just just because they want the money
[59:16] they start just babing them to it they
[59:18] start complimenting complimenting them
[59:21] to it and it just start sugarcoating it
[59:23] instead of giving them the real truth
[59:25] and expecting and then the person goes
[59:28] over there expecting to change expecting
[59:30] to be given something that will make
[59:32] them change and recover but they can't
[59:35] recover because those people those
[59:36] psychiatrists are just feeding them the
[59:38] wrong
[59:43] thing um I'd like to go to like TI up
[59:47] with the Bible
[59:51] also in Ephesians chapter
[59:54] 5 verse 26 6 to 27 says that he might be
[59:59] Sanctified and cleansed with it with the
[1:00:02] washing of the Water by the word that he
[1:00:04] might present it to himself a glorious
[1:00:07] church not having spot or or wrinkle or
[1:00:11] any such thing but that it it should be
[1:00:15] holy and without blemish see over here
[1:00:17] it's saying that the word of God when it
[1:00:19] comes it comes to sanctify comes to
[1:00:21] remove the spots and wrinkles that those
[1:00:23] represents your sins and all those
[1:00:25] things it it represents your complex all
[1:00:27] those uh habits that you've built up the
[1:00:32] Holy Spirit comes to remove all those
[1:00:34] thing that way he can present to
[1:00:37] himself that way he can present to
[1:00:39] himself a virtuous bride a glorious
[1:00:41] bride it want a bride without spot or
[1:00:50] wrinkle I'd also like to take
[1:01:04] Ezekiel chapter 36 verse
[1:01:14] 25 the Bible says then I will sprinkle
[1:01:18] clean water upon you and ye shall be
[1:01:20] clean from all your filthiness and from
[1:01:22] all your Idols will I cleanse you see
[1:01:25] it's it's not not just because the word
[1:01:28] of God when it comes it doesn't just STS
[1:01:30] by cleaning you it's not in fact the
[1:01:32] scripture is not talking about cleaning
[1:01:33] you physically like washing your skin
[1:01:35] and removing dirt it's talking about
[1:01:37] removing filthiness as in your bad
[1:01:39] habits removing Idols that mean your
[1:01:41] ideologies that you have of worshiping
[1:01:43] the wrong um God not their lord God the
[1:01:47] Creator if a new heart also will I give
[1:01:50] you and the new spirit will I put in you
[1:01:53] and I will take away the Stony heart
[1:01:55] heart out of your flesh and I will give
[1:01:57] you a heart of
[1:01:59] Flesh see God is removing our old
[1:02:02] because that heart of us is wicked
[1:02:04] because the Bible also says that men
[1:02:06] thinks they're right in their own heart
[1:02:08] and and men are evil in their own
[1:02:16] heart and in verse 32 it says not for
[1:02:20] your sake do I do this this is God
[1:02:23] talking to uh us he said not for your
[1:02:25] sake that it's not by your will by your
[1:02:27] work or anything that you've done but
[1:02:29] it's by God sayth the Lord God be it
[1:02:31] known unto you be ashamed and confounded
[1:02:34] for your own ways because when we when
[1:02:37] God let us do what we wanted to do we
[1:02:40] faed even in Eden when we did we when
[1:02:42] we're left to our own accord we ended up
[1:02:44] falling for
[1:02:46] sin and he said not so we can be
[1:02:49] confounded in our own ways or House of
[1:02:51] Israel because Israel when when
[1:02:54] God when God had let Israel be uh by
[1:02:58] himself he let he let Israel because God
[1:03:01] was guiding Israel then at some point
[1:03:03] Israel wanted to guide himself they
[1:03:05] started asking God oh can can we can you
[1:03:08] appoint a king for us and after they
[1:03:10] appointed soul and then so fought failed
[1:03:12] from God and soul started disobeying um
[1:03:16] disobeying the Commandments of God just
[1:03:18] because of popularity
[1:03:28] I would also like to
[1:03:36] take second
[1:03:38] Timothy Chapter 2 verse1 15
[1:03:58] it says study to show yourself study to
[1:04:01] show thyself approved unto God a Workman
[1:04:04] needeth not to be ashamed rightly
[1:04:07] dividing the word of truth but but sh
[1:04:11] profane and vain babbling for they will
[1:04:14] increase onto more ungodly
[1:04:17] mess see the scripture of here it says
[1:04:20] to study the scripture to prove yourself
[1:04:23] because if you study the scripture you
[1:04:24] would know how to rightfully the the
[1:04:25] scripture you would know how to rightly
[1:04:27] take it break it down and after that let
[1:04:29] the Lord God like reveal it to you
[1:04:32] scripture by
[1:04:34] scripture excuse me reveal it to you
[1:04:37] scripture by
[1:04:38] scripture which reminds me of uh a time
[1:04:41] I was seeing a lot of people they were
[1:04:43] talking about how oh you know those
[1:04:45] people that have their own wrong
[1:04:47] ideology of the their own interpretation
[1:04:49] of the Bible and some of them were
[1:04:50] saying Jesus is black and stuff like
[1:04:52] that and that was just laughing I didn't
[1:04:53] want to debate or anything and they saw
[1:04:56] and someone saw me laughing and that
[1:04:57] they came to me and they were like but
[1:04:58] he is and that I was like no he's not
[1:05:00] but then they I asked them can you show
[1:05:02] me where it says it and they brought me
[1:05:03] the Book of Revelation I started
[1:05:05] laughing I was like did you even read it
[1:05:07] thoroughly because even in the first
[1:05:09] paragraph it said these signify meaning
[1:05:11] it's a representative it's showing you
[1:05:13] that when he says Jesus his face
[1:05:16] resonated it was talking about like his
[1:05:19] hair resonating it's white as well it
[1:05:20] was talking about the Judgment like him
[1:05:22] coming as a
[1:05:23] judge and then which reminds me when I
[1:05:26] went to the scripture I mean to the
[1:05:28] prophet to the message Rebecca had went
[1:05:30] to school U brother bram's daughter had
[1:05:33] went to school and then the school
[1:05:34] taught her about how the Earth was made
[1:05:37] millions and millions of years old and
[1:05:40] then she came and that started talking
[1:05:42] to brother brandham telling brother
[1:05:43] brandham the school had taught has
[1:05:45] taught us that they had proven to us
[1:05:47] that the Earth was made billions and
[1:05:49] billions and billions of years old and
[1:05:51] brother brandom since he studied the
[1:05:53] scripture and he knows the scripture he
[1:05:54] took just the first uh two verse or so
[1:05:57] the first verse of the Bible he started
[1:05:59] speak talking about Genesis he was like
[1:06:01] in Genesis 1:1 it said God created it
[1:06:03] the the Heaven and the Earth and between
[1:06:06] that and when God started creating the
[1:06:08] days there was a period of time there it
[1:06:11] could have been millions of millions of
[1:06:13] um ages it could have been trillions of
[1:06:14] trillions of time that mean science was
[1:06:17] not uh what's it
[1:06:19] called was not disproving the Bible in
[1:06:21] any sort of way that's what brother BR
[1:06:23] was showing like was revealing was
[1:06:25] saying that everything that they were
[1:06:27] doing they it's not like it's
[1:06:28] contradicting the Bible because Rebecca
[1:06:30] came to brother brandham because she
[1:06:33] clear because she clearly because she
[1:06:36] clearly had
[1:06:38] um she had thoughts that as SC have
[1:06:41] probably told her that oh the Bible is
[1:06:42] wrong and this this this this because
[1:06:44] they did not study the Bible and they
[1:06:46] did not have the right revelation of the
[1:06:47] Bible so they couldn't divide the Bible
[1:06:50] rightly as the scripture says
[1:06:56] and you can also find that uh when
[1:06:58] Rebecca has talked to brother BR you can
[1:06:59] find that 1962 the spoken word is the
[1:07:02] Original
[1:07:05] Seed in 1961
[1:07:08] Revelation um chapter 4 paragraph 158
[1:07:11] part three brother Bram says oh I
[1:07:14] wouldn't oh wouldn't that make a sermon
[1:07:16] right now doctor oh my wouldn't that
[1:07:20] wouldn't that just is Strike me watch
[1:07:23] them before any SE any sacrifice is is
[1:07:27] just received is just received to God
[1:07:31] it's first got to be washed oh how not
[1:07:35] emotionally but Washed by the
[1:07:49] word could you go back and get where
[1:07:52] this Jewish rabbi when I was preaching
[1:07:55] on the sermon of the water separation
[1:07:57] the red he Waters that kept up that they
[1:08:01] were made and Waters of separation and
[1:08:03] before we can ever come to God with true
[1:08:06] faith we first got to come By the Waters
[1:08:09] of Separation yes sir you've got to come
[1:08:12] by what the the word the word is the
[1:08:14] water of Separation as as in when the
[1:08:17] word comes for and you take the word
[1:08:18] it's separating you see when um Elisha
[1:08:21] had sent his word to the king it's not
[1:08:24] that the word talk the King and that
[1:08:26] started dragging him to go to the Jordan
[1:08:28] it's not that that's not what happened
[1:08:30] when the word came forth and the King
[1:08:32] received the word the king automatically
[1:08:34] started separating himself he went and
[1:08:36] started dipping himself it's not the
[1:08:38] word literally dragging you it's because
[1:08:40] you're receiving the word by eating the
[1:08:42] word is chipping away those little
[1:08:43] comple
[1:08:46] complex the more you reside with the
[1:08:49] word the more you're like becoming the
[1:08:51] word now some true Waters some some
[1:08:55] through Waters some through floods some
[1:08:58] through deep trials but all through the
[1:09:00] blood that's that's God's way of leading
[1:09:02] his
[1:09:06] people and over here brother BR says
[1:09:09] compare compare that with the days gone
[1:09:13] by with our
[1:09:15] Lord over here it says and he said to
[1:09:18] his disciple will you go and Peter made
[1:09:20] this state those statement the great
[1:09:22] words that said to whom shall we go see
[1:09:25] but now that didn't stop his Mir his
[1:09:28] miracles he went right on and and a few
[1:09:31] days after that he opened the Man's eyes
[1:09:34] that didn't even have eyeballs in his
[1:09:36] sockets those Miracles got greater but
[1:09:39] the crowds got less and he became more
[1:09:42] or less Popular until they um crucified
[1:09:45] him on the cross see when the word come
[1:09:48] forth some people may leave the church
[1:09:51] the church may get small for a little
[1:09:52] while the church may get small but the
[1:09:54] Miracles inside the church would keep
[1:09:56] growing and keep growing and keep
[1:09:57] growing just as even when this church
[1:10:00] was first started there was a lot of
[1:10:01] people even because I came in when most
[1:10:04] of the people that was a part of I guess
[1:10:06] the old church were already left but as
[1:10:08] the words start coming in as the words
[1:10:10] start removing our complexes start
[1:10:13] removing the way we think our ideology
[1:10:17] and everything certain people started
[1:10:19] leaving because they didn't like the way
[1:10:21] the word was coming forth
[1:10:23] because because their body just didn't
[1:10:26] like it they didn't feel comfortable and
[1:10:27] instead of just residing so they can
[1:10:29] grow and learn from it they're not
[1:10:31] residing and growing from it Peter when
[1:10:33] the word came forth and many people were
[1:10:35] leaving Peter came in and said to whom
[1:10:37] shall we go because this is life that
[1:10:39] mean if the word of God is coming and
[1:10:41] the word of God is life and the word of
[1:10:43] God is speaking to you and is telling
[1:10:45] you that you need to change where else
[1:10:47] would you go if that's life if that's
[1:10:48] the way to the gate where else would you
[1:10:52] go now in Amos chapter 8 verse 11- 12
[1:10:56] says behold the days come sayth the Lord
[1:10:59] God that I will send a famine in the
[1:11:01] land not a famine of bread nor a thirst
[1:11:04] of water but of hearing the
[1:11:07] words of the Lord God the um the words
[1:11:11] of the Lord and they shall Wander from
[1:11:14] sea to Sea and from the north even to
[1:11:16] the east they shall run to and fro and
[1:11:19] seek the word of the Lord and shall not
[1:11:21] find it see the scripture doesn't say
[1:11:23] that oh there will be a famine or food
[1:11:24] and everything because even in our house
[1:11:27] we have stored food inside our house but
[1:11:28] he say that we it will be a famine of
[1:11:30] the word the word of God
[1:11:33] because as you can see the famine
[1:11:36] because the famine as um the famine also
[1:11:38] represent tribulation because in
[1:11:40] Tribulation the word of God won't be
[1:11:41] there and why won't it be there because
[1:11:43] the bride also won't be there and right
[1:11:46] now God is already removing ministers
[1:11:49] one by one like uh a few months ago
[1:11:51] Pastor barudi went Pastor Edward Frank
[1:11:54] was also lifted up from the earth that's
[1:11:57] God removing the gospel little bit by
[1:11:59] little bit and the famine is slowly
[1:12:02] creeping in into the world until there's
[1:12:04] until the whole bride will be lifted up
[1:12:06] after the whole entire Earth will be
[1:12:08] lefted with a
[1:12:10] famine even in uh Hosea 4:6 it says my
[1:12:14] people perish my people are destroyed by
[1:12:17] lack of knowledge and they rejected the
[1:12:20] knowledge of God that's why God also
[1:12:22] rejected them
[1:12:26] and um in the end time in
[1:12:31] 1962 in
[1:12:33] 1962 the end time evangelism brother
[1:12:36] Bram says now we're going to we're going
[1:12:39] to end right here by saying this the
[1:12:42] anti message is to get the bride ready
[1:12:44] and prepar for the Rapture what can it
[1:12:47] do according to Malachi 4 is bringing is
[1:12:50] bringing them back to the faith that was
[1:12:53] once delivered to the Saints bringing
[1:12:55] them back to the faith of the fathers
[1:12:57] the Pentecostal part in the restoration
[1:12:59] time I will restore says the Lord the
[1:13:02] that's the real event end time
[1:13:04] evangelism now I just want to say these
[1:13:07] couple words before I close I bypass the
[1:13:10] rest of these scripture and maybe
[1:13:12] sometime I can get to them but I want to
[1:13:15] say this we believe we're in the end
[1:13:17] time we believe it and though it seems
[1:13:21] like at the end time at this time as in
[1:13:23] this time that the message and the
[1:13:25] messenger both is about broke looks like
[1:13:29] Satan has tried his best to rim wreck us
[1:13:32] brother nille brother Neville his
[1:13:35] accident brother CRA there and gone
[1:13:37] blowing it see it looks like right now
[1:13:42] when every church out through there is
[1:13:45] thumbs down on me and see see it looks
[1:13:48] like it it's just about broke looks like
[1:13:51] we're defeated but don't worry you know
[1:13:55] it's usually at the end time it's it's
[1:13:58] usually at that time when God steps in
[1:14:01] on the scene and sometime he's been
[1:14:03] watching for a long time you remember
[1:14:07] and brother brandham also says that the
[1:14:08] Sadducees and the Pharisees they they
[1:14:11] had thought they caught Jesus when they
[1:14:12] um crucified Jesus but it was at that
[1:14:15] time when they thought that they they um
[1:14:17] caught Jesus that's when Jesus rose
[1:14:19] again see even brother brenon preached
[1:14:21] the sermon of perfect strength by
[1:14:23] Perfect witness because God is made
[1:14:25] strongest when we're weak that mean when
[1:14:27] the famine is growing in when the famine
[1:14:30] is cripping in and yes you may feel a
[1:14:31] little weak yes you may feel a little
[1:14:33] bit hungry but the word when you're
[1:14:35] eating and feeding on the word that word
[1:14:37] will give you strength because Jesus
[1:14:39] Christ went through the um through
[1:14:40] famine he went not to F but he went to
[1:14:43] um fasting for 40 days and 40 nights and
[1:14:47] when he came out the devil started
[1:14:48] tempting him the devil thought just
[1:14:50] because that's his weak State he could
[1:14:52] have won but that was actually when when
[1:14:55] God was strongest and he started saying
[1:14:56] it is written it is written it is
[1:14:58] written and you cannot Test the Lord God
[1:15:00] your
[1:15:03] God and over here brother B also says
[1:15:06] that it was when Jacob had wrestled
[1:15:09] against I mean when Jacob had rested all
[1:15:11] night until his strength was gone and he
[1:15:14] was crippled and he was weak and his
[1:15:17] body was broken up it was at that time
[1:15:20] when God come riding in on the scene the
[1:15:23] next morning we find him what
[1:15:25] a Fearless Prince after this weakness it
[1:15:28] looked like he was defeated but we find
[1:15:31] him a Fearless Prince the message was
[1:15:33] going on and the messenger was with it
[1:15:36] that's exactly right he was a Fearless
[1:15:38] Prince right the other day see that's
[1:15:42] also like the message that was coming
[1:15:43] forth last Sunday when he was talking
[1:15:45] about that yes we are Gods but we shall
[1:15:47] die like Prince and we're not going to
[1:15:49] die until we achieve our um our status
[1:15:52] of a prince you see it's when we're low
[1:15:55] is yes if you're you're battling and it
[1:15:57] looks like everything is uh going very
[1:15:59] hard and it looks like you're not going
[1:16:01] to win but it's at that time that you
[1:16:03] should clinge onto the word of God even
[1:16:05] longer you should cling onto the word of
[1:16:06] God even harder because that's when God
[1:16:08] will actually
[1:16:10] [Applause]
[1:16:15] work but until that day until that day
[1:16:19] like if you go to uh first king chapter
[1:16:22] 18
[1:16:25] yes
[1:16:31] sir First Chapter 19 Verse 18 it
[1:16:41] says yet I have left me 7,000 in Israel
[1:16:45] all the knees which have not bowed onto
[1:16:48] bow and every mouth which hath not
[1:16:51] kissed him see that mean Al to they age
[1:16:54] because earlier
[1:16:56] um earlier in if you go to First Kings
[1:17:00] chapter 19: 10 and 14 Elijah was talking
[1:17:03] to God saying that oh I'm very jealous
[1:17:05] of you God because people have turned
[1:17:07] away from your commandment and people
[1:17:08] are have killed and persecuted um your
[1:17:11] prophets and they're even looking to
[1:17:12] kill me and see the people has deviated
[1:17:15] away from the commandment and after
[1:17:17] there's already the famine that's
[1:17:18] already cripping in you see but if you
[1:17:21] and then at verse 18 when you go to
[1:17:23] verse 18 the Lord God says that there
[1:17:25] was he saved himself a group of 7,000
[1:17:28] and I believe that this night that group
[1:17:30] of 7,000 in this laian age is also part
[1:17:33] we spoken word are also part of that
[1:17:34] 7,000 you see God God Al there's um Al
[1:17:39] there's a famine Al there's ministers
[1:17:41] going here and there like in Joshua um
[1:17:44] chapter 1 verse 1-2 Eli Moses came in
[1:17:47] and Moses was taken up when Moses was
[1:17:49] taken up that's not where God ended God
[1:17:51] did not stop where Moses went God took a
[1:17:56] Joshua Ministry to lead the people into
[1:17:57] the land see as ministers are being
[1:18:00] lifted up up out of the earth God is
[1:18:03] also bringing young ministers that are
[1:18:04] rising up in this message that can
[1:18:06] preach his message you
[1:18:21] see I would like to go um I know there's
[1:18:25] a lot of scripture reading today but
[1:18:28] just bear with
[1:18:31] me but it's the word of God nonetheless
[1:18:33] is here to help
[1:18:36] you in Romans 11: 1-5 he says I say then
[1:18:40] have God Cast Away his people God forbid
[1:18:44] for I also am an Israelite of the Seed
[1:18:46] of Abraham of The Tribe of Benjamin God
[1:18:50] hath not Cast Away his people with which
[1:18:52] he fornew what ye not what he what the
[1:18:56] scripture sayth of Eli Elias how he
[1:18:59] maketh intercession to God against
[1:19:01] Israel saying Lord they have killed thy
[1:19:05] prophets and digged down thy Altar and I
[1:19:08] am left I am left alone and they seek my
[1:19:11] life but what say the what say the
[1:19:14] answer of the the answer of God unto him
[1:19:17] I have reserved to myself 7,000 men who
[1:19:21] have not bowed to the knee to the image
[1:19:23] of bow see in this laition age God has
[1:19:26] saved himself a church not just church
[1:19:29] but many churches because we also have
[1:19:30] sister churches that are standing with
[1:19:32] us with this Gospel of brother Brandon
[1:19:34] when people are rejecting it when people
[1:19:36] are are speaking ill of it and people
[1:19:38] are rejecting it just saying that oh
[1:19:40] he's not the messenger see so much time
[1:19:42] has gone by and this this this this this
[1:19:46] but God has kept himself God has kept
[1:19:48] himself a group of people here that
[1:19:50] still believes on the UN indoctrinated
[1:19:52] word of God you see that's why the
[1:19:54] prophet of God also says in 1953 12113
[1:19:59] he says that but I have food that I eat
[1:20:03] that the world knows nothing about and
[1:20:05] your spirit coming to me in faith
[1:20:08] believing what I'm telling you is true
[1:20:11] is the food that I leave on that's my
[1:20:14] eternal life if I don't feed this
[1:20:16] natural man I'll die and if I don't feed
[1:20:20] their spiritual man I'll die now our
[1:20:23] brother scientist sitting here would
[1:20:25] know that EV that would know that
[1:20:28] anything that doesn't eat very much and
[1:20:31] just keeps going dieting dieting dieting
[1:20:34] your stomach strengths and then if you
[1:20:37] become eating a whole lot your stomach
[1:20:40] you require more you see I sure I sure
[1:20:44] am a gluttony on this I tell you I
[1:20:47] really require a whole lot of it because
[1:20:50] I am c i my capacity just has no limit
[1:20:54] you
[1:20:55] see of here because this also remind me
[1:20:58] of an article because there are certain
[1:21:00] people that like certain tribes they
[1:21:02] have their own custom of feeding um of
[1:21:06] like it's ideal for them to look big and
[1:21:09] they have this little custom of feeding
[1:21:11] people for six months and they will feed
[1:21:13] them they will feed them food so they
[1:21:15] can get big and in the first week when
[1:21:17] they're feeding the people of like the
[1:21:19] people of that culture in the first week
[1:21:21] the children will start vomiting because
[1:21:24] it's beyond their limit but as they kept
[1:21:27] doing it weeks go by weeks go back their
[1:21:29] stomach start enlarging and their
[1:21:31] stomach as it start enlarging now they
[1:21:32] can withstand that capacity that they
[1:21:34] were giv them you see that's why the
[1:21:36] prophet God says I've often said if I
[1:21:38] was just a little bigger maybe I could
[1:21:40] feel better you know if I if it was I
[1:21:44] don't know how it could cont how it
[1:21:46] could contain it I believe we'll
[1:21:49] have I believe we'll have to have a
[1:21:52] Immortal body to contain it I think
[1:21:55] of what what about what about it friend
[1:21:57] see brother is talking about oropy we'll
[1:21:59] have oropy that will be able to contain
[1:22:01] all this word because even me when I'm
[1:22:03] meditating after the Revelation is
[1:22:05] coming sometime I feel like my physical
[1:22:07] body cannot cannot like contain that
[1:22:10] Revelation I feel like my brain is going
[1:22:12] to overload with the Revelation that's
[1:22:14] coming forth and I believe brother
[1:22:16] Brandon was also speaking about that he
[1:22:18] also felt sometime that he might get
[1:22:19] overwhelmed because of his physical body
[1:22:22] and he said I believe will have a
[1:22:23] Immortal body body to contain
[1:22:29] it now I want to speak about grinding
[1:22:32] because if you go by the dictionary of
[1:22:33] grinding grinding means to break
[1:22:36] something down but grinding also if
[1:22:38] you're a student or a gamer I'm not
[1:22:40] promoting gaming because game to me
[1:22:43] anybody that makes a profession out of
[1:22:45] gaming is like a professional clown but
[1:22:48] anyways a student grinding to them it
[1:22:51] means to study to study hard and to
[1:22:54] study and to study to become someone to
[1:22:56] study to improve to become better you
[1:22:59] see there are times where both for those
[1:23:02] that at least that was G that was a
[1:23:04] gamer or whatever and those that are
[1:23:06] students if you look at a student and
[1:23:08] when they're studying it's usually yes
[1:23:10] there are times where they study with um
[1:23:12] their peers but most of the time they're
[1:23:14] studying by themselves and most of the
[1:23:15] time when they're studying by themselves
[1:23:17] you're not going to see them studying
[1:23:19] there that's them eating it's kind of
[1:23:21] like um Elijah when he was speaking with
[1:23:25] God in the cave Elijah was over there by
[1:23:27] himself Elijah was feeding on the word
[1:23:29] by himself you see just the same thing
[1:23:32] with the
[1:23:41] students and I would like to uh tie with
[1:23:44] 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:23:46] 3:3 where it says that for as much as ye
[1:23:50] manifest
[1:23:51] declared for as much as ye are man
[1:23:54] manifestly declared to be the Epistle of
[1:23:58] Christ ministered by US Written not with
[1:24:00] ink but with the spirit of the Living
[1:24:03] God not in the tables of stone but in
[1:24:06] the fleshly tables of the heart see it
[1:24:09] says that we're written Epistles and
[1:24:11] we're not just written EP pistol by by
[1:24:13] other men or by other ideology but by
[1:24:15] God himself God himself was the one that
[1:24:17] wrote it God himself was the one who
[1:24:19] chose to make us a written epistle and
[1:24:22] not just the written epistle as in like
[1:24:24] having had knowledge but knowing the
[1:24:26] scripture in the flesh knowing making it
[1:24:28] become real not it just staying in
[1:24:31] history or staying in the books by it
[1:24:33] becoming a living because it says the
[1:24:35] spirit of the Living
[1:24:37] God that's
[1:24:41] right and in second Titus verse 2 verse5
[1:24:51] says second second Timothy verse 2 verse
[1:24:57] 5 says and if any man also strive from
[1:25:02] uh masteries yet is he not crowned
[1:25:05] except he strive lawfully see over here
[1:25:09] it's talking it says
[1:25:12] the see over here it's saying that if
[1:25:15] you're going through tribulation and
[1:25:16] you're working hard like a student
[1:25:18] that's grinding that's studying um
[1:25:21] that's studying for a degree if you're
[1:25:23] working right rightfully will you not uh
[1:25:25] obtain your degree that Crown will you
[1:25:27] not obtain your degree now you take that
[1:25:29] and you apply it to the word now if
[1:25:31] you're grinding the word you're eating
[1:25:33] the word you're feeding on the body of
[1:25:34] Jesus Christ because the word is God if
[1:25:36] you're feeding on God will you not
[1:25:38] receive your crown will you not receive
[1:25:40] your glory will you not receive your
[1:25:42] theophany and be next to to God because
[1:25:46] in Revelation talks about our reward
[1:25:48] will be seated with God in the in the um
[1:25:51] Kingdom that's right
[1:25:57] in second Corinthians chap 4: 16-8 says
[1:26:01] for which cause we faint not but though
[1:26:04] our outward men perish yet the inward
[1:26:06] man is renewed day by day for our light
[1:26:09] if Affliction which is but for a moment
[1:26:12] worketh for us a far more exceeding and
[1:26:15] eternal weight of Glory while we look
[1:26:18] not at the things which are seen But at
[1:26:20] the things which are not seen for the
[1:26:22] things which are seen are are temporal
[1:26:25] but the things which are not seen are
[1:26:27] Eternal which is
[1:26:29] saying when when a student is working
[1:26:32] and they're not looking at the things
[1:26:35] because a student at the time that
[1:26:37] they're studying they're not at a
[1:26:39] certain level but as they have the
[1:26:42] vision of what they want to become
[1:26:43] they're looking at what is not seen you
[1:26:46] see they're looking at their goal
[1:26:48] they're looking at something that that
[1:26:49] that they don't have yet and and the
[1:26:52] Bible is saying to amen the Bible is
[1:26:55] telling us that for our light Affliction
[1:26:58] that mean the little trial that you're
[1:26:59] studying it's just a little bit of work
[1:27:01] that you have to do but when you obtain
[1:27:03] That Glory when you obtain that Eternal
[1:27:06] Body when you obtain or when you obtain
[1:27:08] that degree you're not going to you can
[1:27:10] look back and you be like well that was
[1:27:12] light work that affection that was
[1:27:14] feeling wasn't that hard you
[1:27:16] see amen
[1:27:24] and in
[1:27:27] 1960 December 25th the prophet of God
[1:27:30] said there's nothing too good for
[1:27:34] Jesus there's nothing too good for Jesus
[1:27:37] give him your best give him everything
[1:27:39] you got your life your soul your being
[1:27:42] your time all that you have you see give
[1:27:44] it to him see it's saying when you like
[1:27:47] when you're a student when you're going
[1:27:48] through trial just give it your all
[1:27:50] because see what what separates um in
[1:27:53] New and a pro a Pro Gamer or a student
[1:27:57] and a teacher or even an immature God
[1:27:59] and God is the fact that you have to
[1:28:01] give your all to achieve that level you
[1:28:03] have to you have to study study study
[1:28:06] until you arrive to that to that
[1:28:09] um to that goal that you that you see
[1:28:12] but you don't literally see you see that
[1:28:14] goal that you're achieving to obtain
[1:28:20] amen and I believe that the bride today
[1:28:24] as we're feeding on the word of God as
[1:28:25] we're studying and as we're feeding and
[1:28:28] grinding on the word of God there will
[1:28:30] be one day where the bride of Christ
[1:28:32] will be like will shine like the sun of
[1:28:35] the light of seven days that's right
[1:28:38] amen
[1:28:40] amen
[1:28:47] and if we can go to two Peter
[1:29:12] two Peter
[1:29:14] chapter chapter two I mean chapter
[1:29:17] chapter one verse 1-7
[1:29:28] the Bible says Simon Peter a servant and
[1:29:31] Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that
[1:29:34] have obtained like Precious Faith with
[1:29:37] us through the righteous of God and our
[1:29:39] Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be
[1:29:41] multiplied unto you through the
[1:29:43] knowledge of Jesus Christ and of through
[1:29:46] the knowledge of God and of Jesus our
[1:29:48] savior see it's saying that Grace and
[1:29:50] peace will be multiplied unto you and
[1:29:53] how will it be multiply onto you through
[1:29:55] the knowledge not just any knowledge but
[1:29:57] saying the knowledge of God the
[1:29:59] knowledge of Jesus Christ that's how
[1:30:00] Grace and peace will be multiplied onto
[1:30:03] you that mean if you want peace in your
[1:30:04] life and you want Grace in your life
[1:30:06] just you just have to feed on the
[1:30:07] knowledge of God you
[1:30:09] see Accord according as his divine power
[1:30:13] have given us all things that pertain
[1:30:16] unto life and godliness to the knowledge
[1:30:20] of him that have called us to glory and
[1:30:23] virtue see everything that you need to
[1:30:24] live a Godly life God has already given
[1:30:27] to you and how did God give it to you
[1:30:29] God say he has given you that through
[1:30:31] the knowledge of him that called us to
[1:30:34] glory and virtue which is speaking about
[1:30:35] Jesus Christ and whereby are are given
[1:30:39] unto us exceeding great and precious
[1:30:42] promises that by these ye might be
[1:30:45] partakers of the divine nature having
[1:30:48] escape the the corruption that is in the
[1:30:50] world through through lust see the world
[1:30:54] the world is corrupted and the Bible
[1:30:56] says corrupted through lust to their
[1:30:58] strong desires of the wrong thing of sin
[1:31:02] but verse five then he says and besides
[1:31:05] this giving all diligence that mean
[1:31:07] giving all
[1:31:09] preeminence add to your faith virtue and
[1:31:13] to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[1:31:15] Temperance and to Temperance patience
[1:31:18] and to patience godliness and to
[1:31:20] Godliness brotherly kindness and to
[1:31:22] brotherly kindness charity you see
[1:31:24] and we know that faith faith is God
[1:31:27] every everything on this pyramid is God
[1:31:29] himself and we'll get to that faith is
[1:31:32] God he said that
[1:31:34] um uh what's it called it says that
[1:31:37] Faith how do you gain Faith how does one
[1:31:39] gain Faith he says that Faith cometh by
[1:31:41] the hearing of the word and it doesn't
[1:31:43] just say any type of word by the word of
[1:31:45] God and when Jesus came down he said
[1:31:47] that he he and the father is one and the
[1:31:49] Bible says that Jesus was the word of
[1:31:51] God as it says in Genesis one in John
[1:31:55] 1: and then virtue speaks about your
[1:31:59] morality you see it speaks about your
[1:32:01] moral principles right and wrong and it
[1:32:05] says to add onto your faith virtue and
[1:32:07] then virtue knowledge knowledge because
[1:32:11] the Bible says that my people are
[1:32:13] destroyed for lack of knowledge and to
[1:32:15] not perish to not be destroyed you need
[1:32:16] to have knowledge and then knowledge
[1:32:18] Temperance which is like self um
[1:32:20] restrainment then to Temperance patience
[1:32:23] which
[1:32:24] James chap 5 says behold we count them
[1:32:27] happy which endure ye have heard that
[1:32:30] the patient of job have seen an end that
[1:32:33] the end of the Lord because God had
[1:32:35] doubled everything job had after he
[1:32:37] endured God doubled everything he
[1:32:39] has and then to Patient godliness and
[1:32:43] godliness which
[1:32:45] in in Titus it says that the
[1:32:48] acknowledging of the truth which is
[1:32:50] after godliness in other words
[1:32:53] recognizing the truth brings godliness
[1:32:56] you
[1:32:57] see and then from godliness brotherly
[1:33:00] kindness and brotherly kindness when I
[1:33:02] was thinking about this I was like
[1:33:04] brotherly
[1:33:05] kindness excuse me
[1:33:25] brotherly kindness when I was thinking
[1:33:26] about brotherly kindness I was like what
[1:33:28] is brotherly kindness like how do you
[1:33:31] know
[1:33:32] uh you have brotherly kindness or what
[1:33:34] is it and I remember in Luke chapter 10
[1:33:37] like verse 25-37 you can read it at home
[1:33:40] Jesus was like tempted by his student or
[1:33:42] so he came to Jesus asking Jesus how do
[1:33:44] I obtain eternal life and Jesus said
[1:33:46] what does the law say about eternal life
[1:33:48] and after that the man the man told
[1:33:51] Jesus well the law says to to love uh
[1:33:56] God with all your being and to love your
[1:33:59] neighbors as you love yourself and after
[1:34:02] there Jesus told him then go do so then
[1:34:04] he tried to try Jesus again and after he
[1:34:07] said well how do I know which one is my
[1:34:09] neighbor then Jesus gave him the parable
[1:34:11] of the Good Samaritan and after the
[1:34:13] parable of the Good Samaritan God Jesus
[1:34:16] asked him so like why have you learned
[1:34:19] from this and after that he said that
[1:34:22] our neighbors is the one that shows
[1:34:23] Mercy Mery and that's Jesus said go do
[1:34:25] this which remind me from time to time
[1:34:29] when when when uh what's it
[1:34:33] called when I used
[1:34:36] to um when there was days that I
[1:34:39] wouldn't come to when I would have come
[1:34:41] to church because something was holding
[1:34:42] me brother Kelly would come in that that
[1:34:44] he would sit me outside that talk to me
[1:34:46] that that kind of scold me and that that
[1:34:48] uh scold me and ask me what's wrong and
[1:34:51] that that tells me and encourages me and
[1:34:53] try to find out what's wrong that was
[1:34:54] brotherly kindness right there because
[1:34:56] the scripture also says as iron sharpens
[1:34:58] iron shall a brother sharpen another
[1:35:00] brother you
[1:35:01] see and you don't just sharpen another
[1:35:03] brother just by uh talk to them and
[1:35:06] stuff like that but you also have to
[1:35:07] give them the word the word of God
[1:35:09] that's how you're going to sharpen one
[1:35:10] another you have to correct them by the
[1:35:12] word
[1:35:15] also and 1965
[1:35:19] October 31st the power of transformation
[1:35:22] brother Bram says and to think that you
[1:35:25] can come apart and gather like this
[1:35:27] where as the psalmist said which was in
[1:35:30] Psalm 133 verse one brother Bron was
[1:35:34] reading saying behold now sweet and
[1:35:37] pleasant for Brethren to dwell together
[1:35:40] in unity it's like the ointment oil it's
[1:35:42] like the anointing oil that was on
[1:35:45] Aaron's beard that ran to the H of His
[1:35:49] Garment that we know that oil represent
[1:35:51] the Holy Ghost and it's and brother when
[1:35:53] he was talking about that he said that
[1:35:55] it's sweet for brother as he was reading
[1:35:57] the scripture he said that it's sweet
[1:35:58] for as the scripture say it's sweet for
[1:36:00] brothers to dwell together and that it's
[1:36:02] like the anointing oil going down on
[1:36:05] Aaron's beard and if you ever have like
[1:36:07] oil for those I don't have the beard but
[1:36:09] for those that have one if you are when
[1:36:11] you have like oil going through your
[1:36:13] hair or something like that it's hard to
[1:36:15] separate it and you can even take when
[1:36:17] we have question answer meetings it's
[1:36:18] hard for brothers to separate it's hard
[1:36:20] for us to even div because we want to
[1:36:22] dwell and just eat the word and just
[1:36:24] keep talking about the word and even
[1:36:26] even if you're tired when you come and
[1:36:28] that you are fellowshipping with um the
[1:36:30] brothers you will feel like your
[1:36:31] strength is coming to you and you just
[1:36:34] don't want to separate from
[1:36:36] it and brother Bram says which you know
[1:36:39] what the anointing oil done it preserves
[1:36:42] him to go in the presence of God see he
[1:36:45] had the anointed with he had to be
[1:36:47] Anointed with the oil before he went in
[1:36:49] the presence of God and when Brethren
[1:36:52] can dwell together Unity is like likened
[1:36:55] onto the oil we then enter into the
[1:36:58] presence of the Lord with the anointing
[1:37:01] of Brethren together in unity oil all
[1:37:05] the oil represents the Holy Ghost yes
[1:37:13] sir and you can um in
[1:37:17] 1956 in August 14 paragraph 6 brother B
[1:37:20] also speaks about uh how
[1:37:24] how you got to be loyal and honest with
[1:37:27] one another brotherly love and then God
[1:37:30] will bless you you see you have to be
[1:37:32] loyal and honest with one another and
[1:37:34] God will bless you and there's even a
[1:37:36] scripture that says that you have to
[1:37:38] confess your um your sins you have to
[1:37:41] confess your faults you have to confess
[1:37:43] your stuff to one another to your
[1:37:44] brethren and after that God will bless
[1:37:45] you God will heal you you receive
[1:37:47] healing through death
[1:38:02] and I'd like to like show that also in
[1:38:04] the scripture I don't want you just to
[1:38:05] take my words for it but I would also
[1:38:07] like to show you that brotherly kindness
[1:38:09] in the
[1:38:11] scripture if we can go to James
[1:38:25] James chap James chapter
[1:38:35] 5 verse 16
[1:38:37] says that's actually the scripture that
[1:38:39] I was referring to confess your faults
[1:38:41] one to another and pray one for another
[1:38:43] that you may be healed and effect and
[1:38:46] effectual fervant prayer for the
[1:38:48] righteous man ath much you see and after
[1:38:52] that in G galatian he also says that in
[1:38:56] galatian he also says like galatian 6:1
[1:39:00] it talks about how we shouldn't be
[1:39:02] egotistical you
[1:39:03] see it talks about how we shouldn't be
[1:39:06] egotistical but to support one another
[1:39:08] to carry one another as the scripture
[1:39:11] say Brethren if a man be overtaken in a
[1:39:13] fault ye which are spiritual restore
[1:39:16] such a one in the spirit of meekness
[1:39:19] consider considering themsel considering
[1:39:23] thy s lest thou also be tempted bear ye
[1:39:26] one another's burden and also fulfill
[1:39:28] the law of Christ for if a man think
[1:39:31] himself to be something when he is
[1:39:34] nothing be deceived himself that mean
[1:39:36] don't think of yourself above your
[1:39:38] brother but you're supposed to help one
[1:39:39] another and you're supposed to help one
[1:39:41] when I'm saying help one another I'm
[1:39:43] just yes you can help one another in the
[1:39:45] physical but also help them in the
[1:39:46] spiritual aspect also if you say a
[1:39:48] brother doesn't understand something or
[1:39:51] let's say a person the word came for for
[1:39:53] that they say the word says not to do
[1:39:55] this or the word says to do this this
[1:39:57] this and this and after that you see
[1:39:58] that brother is having a hard time to
[1:40:01] understand that to grasp the word and
[1:40:03] God has revealed it to you it's up to
[1:40:05] you to take it and bring it to the
[1:40:07] brother that they tell them you say
[1:40:09] brother this is not right the word says
[1:40:11] this this this this or you should be
[1:40:13] doing this this this this and this you
[1:40:15] see
[1:40:17] am and and then there's Grace which is
[1:40:21] like the Capstone of it all and when I
[1:40:22] was p this Grace love love is God you
[1:40:27] see the scripture says
[1:40:28] so the scripture says so when I was
[1:40:31] thinking about love I was like what is
[1:40:33] love like what type of Love Are there
[1:40:35] what type of love has God manifested for
[1:40:37] us and and it thought came was about
[1:40:40] Reckless Love Like The Reckless Love of
[1:40:42] God coming down I don't think many
[1:40:43] people understand like that Reckless
[1:40:45] Love because if you even take a moment
[1:40:48] and look even in our humanistic realm
[1:40:52] when someone is of a high high sture and
[1:40:54] that they're trying to marry someone of
[1:40:56] a lower stature people are saying that
[1:40:58] oh you're going to belittle yourself
[1:40:59] you're losing your dignity or you will
[1:41:01] be cast out of the family if you do
[1:41:03] something like that when it comes to
[1:41:05] royalty see but when someone that truly
[1:41:08] loves someone even if you're in a high
[1:41:11] standard some people will risk losing
[1:41:13] that high standard just to go in there
[1:41:15] see The Reckless Love of God God being
[1:41:17] God he was all the way in the seventh
[1:41:19] Dimension he decided to come down to our
[1:41:21] Dimension just to teach us how we're
[1:41:23] supposed to act and how we're supposed
[1:41:25] to be just to teach us and feed us the
[1:41:27] word and he didn't only stop there after
[1:41:30] coming down from his Dimension he also
[1:41:32] went down to the lowest Dimension which
[1:41:35] was hell and he took the keys from the
[1:41:38] devil not only did he took the keys from
[1:41:40] the devil he also freed the saints that
[1:41:42] were in um Paradise see that that when
[1:41:45] people look at that they would be like
[1:41:47] why would God do that why would God
[1:41:48] leave a place where he was comfortable a
[1:41:50] place where he's all powerful just to
[1:41:52] come down and save someone that's as
[1:41:55] little as us you see God came down and
[1:41:58] invested himself in us see that's the
[1:42:01] Reckless Love of God which remind me
[1:42:03] that's the Reckless Love of God it's
[1:42:04] like one time there was a fire in the
[1:42:06] house and then my father came in and he
[1:42:08] told everybody to leave and after he
[1:42:09] took two wooden stick and carried a pot
[1:42:12] which was burning and took it outside
[1:42:14] the door and put it outside he he ended
[1:42:17] up having a burn but see he risked his
[1:42:19] life just to save ours he risked his
[1:42:22] life that's the same thing Jesus did
[1:42:23] Jesus came down and Spilled his blood
[1:42:26] spilled his blood on the cross and went
[1:42:29] all the way to hell just to save
[1:42:33] us and then there's also the mercy love
[1:42:36] of God because when I received that
[1:42:38] revelation of The Reckless Love of God
[1:42:39] the mercy love of God also came which
[1:42:41] represent Grace why because after Jesus
[1:42:43] resurrected he didn't just stop there he
[1:42:45] went up in heaven and after that went up
[1:42:47] in heaven that that splashed the blood
[1:42:49] on the book and took the book and came
[1:42:52] and gave it to us and he didn't give it
[1:42:54] to us because we were worthy of it but
[1:42:56] he just gave it to us out of his own
[1:42:58] Grace out of his Mercy he just gave it
[1:43:00] to us you
[1:43:01] [Applause]
[1:43:17] see and um
[1:43:33] in
[1:43:35] 1956 in the church and its condition
[1:43:38] paragraph 137 it was on August 8 brother
[1:43:41] Brandon says how many here that's
[1:43:44] backsliding oh you say I wouldn't admit
[1:43:46] that brother brandham but look if that
[1:43:50] Dove of meekness gone from you brother
[1:43:53] other there's something wrong there's
[1:43:55] something wrong when you can't bear with
[1:43:59] one another when you can't forgive every
[1:44:02] person from every death of your heart no
[1:44:06] matter what they've done or what they've
[1:44:09] said if you can't forgive them for the
[1:44:12] death Jesus said if you don't forgive
[1:44:14] every man his trespasses from your heart
[1:44:17] neither does your heavenly
[1:44:20] father forgives you and then brother br
[1:44:23] also say in the um the statute of a
[1:44:25] perfect man says so when you surren you
[1:44:28] surrender completely when you surrender
[1:44:31] when you surrender your complete being
[1:44:34] then the Holy Spirit just pours through
[1:44:36] you in The Virtue then you're a living
[1:44:40] Tabernacle then people look out and say
[1:44:43] that's a man full of
[1:44:45] virtue they say that's Man full of
[1:44:47] virtue that's a man full of knowledge
[1:44:49] he's believing the word Temperance
[1:44:51] patient godliness brotherly kindness
[1:44:53] fullness fullness the full of the
[1:44:57] Holy excuse me brotherly kindness full
[1:45:00] of the Holy full of the love of the Holy
[1:45:02] Ghost see there he is walking around
[1:45:05] what is it the stat the stature that
[1:45:08] unbelievers can look at and and say
[1:45:12] there is a Christian there is a man or a
[1:45:16] woman who knows what they're talking
[1:45:18] about you never seen a Kinder sweeter go
[1:45:21] godlier person you're sealed it seal
[1:45:24] shows on both
[1:45:27] side whether you're going or coming you
[1:45:30] see this seal just the same there you
[1:45:32] are see when a man or a woman possesses
[1:45:35] this then the Capstone comes down and
[1:45:38] seals them into the kingdom of God which
[1:45:40] is the Holy Ghost then the word the word
[1:45:45] coming from here manifest itself through
[1:45:47] each one of these beings see and makes
[1:45:50] this complete being a tacle of the
[1:45:54] Living God a walking living example of
[1:45:58] Christianity what what Christ was these
[1:46:01] people are because his life is in here
[1:46:04] there are in Christ and their and their
[1:46:07] life is dead and head in Christ through
[1:46:10] God and the seal and sealed in there by
[1:46:14] the Holy Ghost 1 Corinthians 12 that's
[1:46:16] right see you reckon Yourself Dead than
[1:46:20] you're born of Faith then virtue than
[1:46:23] these other things is added on onto you
[1:46:27] till you're perfect that's right until
[1:46:29] you're a perfect living image of God
[1:46:33] that wonderful see for you to become
[1:46:35] more like God you need to feed on the
[1:46:36] word of
[1:46:38] God for you to become more like God you
[1:46:40] need to fit on the word of God for you
[1:46:41] to become more like the image of God you
[1:46:43] need to fit on the word of
[1:46:45] God you need to fit on the word of God
[1:46:48] and and for for once again for all these
[1:46:52] things if you don't have it if you don't
[1:46:54] have faith if you don't have virtue like
[1:46:56] I said God is all those things that's
[1:46:58] why the name Jehovah means I am that
[1:47:00] means God who is existing it also means
[1:47:02] I am becoming see God is all these
[1:47:05] things that's why he used the I am but
[1:47:06] if God is Not faith in your life if God
[1:47:08] is Not virtue or knowledge in your life
[1:47:10] just pray to God and ask him because
[1:47:12] like I said God is I am who has all
[1:47:14] these things but he's also I am becoming
[1:47:16] that mean if he's not knowledge in your
[1:47:18] life I'm not saying if he's not
[1:47:19] knowledge I'm saying if he's not
[1:47:20] knowledge in your life just pray to God
[1:47:23] and God will become knowledge in your
[1:47:25] life you see just pray to God and God
[1:47:27] will become virtue and faith in your
[1:47:28] life just pray to God just keep feeding
[1:47:30] on the word and God will become every
[1:47:32] single one of those things in your life
[1:47:34] if you don't have love just pray to God
[1:47:35] and keep feeding on the word of God
[1:47:37] because the Bible says God is love and
[1:47:41] if you're feeding on the word of God
[1:47:42] which says the word of God is God that
[1:47:44] mean you're feeding on love and you will
[1:47:45] end up having go you will end up having
[1:47:47] love God will become love in your life
[1:47:49] you seej
[1:48:10] if we could um go to SEC second Peter
[1:48:18] again now I'm going to start by verse 8
[1:48:20] to9 or so it says the Lord knoweth how
[1:48:24] to deliver The Godly out of the
[1:48:26] Temptation and to reserve and to
[1:48:32] reserve chapter one first Peter I mean
[1:48:35] second Peter chapter 1 verse 9 but he
[1:48:38] that lath these things is blind and not
[1:48:40] see and cannot see a far off and have
[1:48:43] forgotten that he was purged from his
[1:48:46] old sins wherefore the rather Brethren
[1:48:50] give diligence to make your calling an
[1:48:53] election give diligence meaning give
[1:48:55] preeminence make your calling an
[1:48:57] election sure for if ye do these things
[1:49:02] you shall never fall that mean if you're
[1:49:04] if you have faith you won't fall if you
[1:49:06] have virtue you won't fall if you have
[1:49:07] knowledge you won't fall if you do all
[1:49:09] these things it doesn't just say if you
[1:49:10] do like one of them and after you stop
[1:49:12] you have to do all of those as the
[1:49:14] scripture say if you do these things you
[1:49:18] shall never fall for as an ENT shall be
[1:49:21] ministered unto you AB abundantly into
[1:49:23] the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and
[1:49:25] Savior Jesus Christ see it say it will
[1:49:27] be ministered to the entrance will be
[1:49:30] Minister unto you that mean when the
[1:49:31] word is coming forth it's being it's the
[1:49:34] Gate of the Kingdom being preached unto
[1:49:36] you that's what it
[1:49:39] is wherefore I will not be NE negligent
[1:49:43] to put you always in remembrance of
[1:49:46] these things through you through ye know
[1:49:49] them and be established in the present
[1:49:53] truth
[1:49:54] see see over here it's saying that he
[1:49:56] won CE to tell you to keep eating the
[1:49:58] word he won't CE to tell you to keep
[1:50:00] feeding on the word just as the pastor
[1:50:02] every every uh church service tells you
[1:50:04] have you read your church age book have
[1:50:06] you done this have you read your
[1:50:08] scripture twice a day or
[1:50:10] whatnot see even I also won't stop keep
[1:50:13] telling you to feed on the word of God
[1:50:14] because by feeding on the word of God
[1:50:16] that's how you get closer to God see
[1:50:18] there's many people there's many people
[1:50:21] many souls in the six demension that are
[1:50:23] earning that are that are um that are
[1:50:27] Desiring they're waiting on us to finish
[1:50:29] our race they're waiting on us if you've
[1:50:31] ever noticed if you've ever watched a
[1:50:34] race like a relay race when when you
[1:50:36] pass the Baton you cannot talk to the
[1:50:39] person that's running until they finish
[1:50:40] with the race just like they're in the
[1:50:42] sixth sixth D sixth Dimension they
[1:50:45] finished their race not it's up to us to
[1:50:47] finish ours and we need to keep running
[1:50:49] we need to keep feeding on the word and
[1:50:50] the way for us to run our races is by us
[1:50:53] feeding on the word and not just feeding
[1:50:55] the word but when we're feeding the word
[1:50:56] we have to reproduce the energy that the
[1:50:58] word is giving it the energy that the
[1:51:00] word is giving us we need to reproduce
[1:51:02] that we don't not we don't need to just
[1:51:04] sit down and let that energy Stack Up
[1:51:07] and pile up and just sit down and just
[1:51:08] keep saying amen but we need to let that
[1:51:10] energy come out and be manifested and be
[1:51:13] a living a be be a living epistle be a
[1:51:16] living reality in our everyday life you
[1:51:19] see
[1:51:25] yes
[1:51:28] um and this one in
[1:51:32] 1958 brother brandham says Eagle food
[1:51:35] comes from the mouth of the feeder not
[1:51:37] some man-made theology but from the
[1:51:40] mouth of feeder which is Jehovah Eagle
[1:51:44] who feeds with his own word and the ego
[1:51:47] will never bring her babies anything
[1:51:50] that would hurt them oh I just love that
[1:51:53] God will never make a promise that you
[1:51:56] won't that he won't stand behind and
[1:51:59] every Eagle just loves to get a hold of
[1:52:02] the of that word he loves it he becomes
[1:52:06] it
[1:52:08] becomes because he loves it he loves it
[1:52:12] because it comes from the mouth of
[1:52:14] Jehovah Eagle he loves to receive it
[1:52:18] oh oh I seen the little ones Waiting For
[1:52:21] Mama to come up and they're all raised
[1:52:24] and hold their little mouth open ever
[1:52:27] what Mama brought up that's all right
[1:52:29] and that's the way that a True Believer
[1:52:31] is no matter what Dr John's said or what
[1:52:36] anybody else said if Jehovah put it in
[1:52:39] his word they believe it and they
[1:52:41] receive it doesn't matter how bitter it
[1:52:43] might be or how hard it might be or
[1:52:45] anything but if it's God's word just
[1:52:48] take it feed it and receive it and
[1:52:49] believe it you see the scientists can
[1:52:51] say the days of Miracles is passed and
[1:52:54] there is no such thing as Divine Healing
[1:52:57] the Holy Spirit only fell on
[1:53:00] the2 and the 120 oh but when Jehovah
[1:53:06] said it's for you and your children and
[1:53:09] to them that's far off even as many as
[1:53:12] the Lord or God shall call if they're
[1:53:15] called they'll eat you
[1:53:18] see if they're called they eat if it's
[1:53:21] like when it's dinner time when they
[1:53:23] call you will you not come and eat
[1:53:25] unless if you want to starve but if
[1:53:27] you're called you'll eat if you're the
[1:53:29] true seed of God you'll come and eat
[1:53:31] because because Jesus said my sheep know
[1:53:34] my voice when you're called when Jesus
[1:53:36] calls his sheep his sheep will come in
[1:53:38] and they and they will listen to him and
[1:53:40] come into to him you
[1:53:42] see so he has the special bird he has a
[1:53:46] special bird to take this food and he
[1:53:48] has to be made up to go into those
[1:53:51] atmosphere
[1:53:53] that's another thing about about him and
[1:53:55] then in order to get up there he has to
[1:53:58] have strong Wings ordinary bird is
[1:54:02] is his feathers would fly out of him cuz
[1:54:07] he can't stand when he can't when he
[1:54:09] gets up there but an old Eagle can SAR
[1:54:12] where another bird can't can't get a
[1:54:15] hundred yards off the ground without
[1:54:16] flopping himself to death you know
[1:54:19] that's right yes sir they're just
[1:54:21] beating the air and launch in an old
[1:54:23] crane or something pumping up and down
[1:54:26] and trying to ride the waves and
[1:54:27] staggering over where a eagle just sets
[1:54:30] his wings and rides on the Wave It's
[1:54:32] Fearless its feathers are strong they
[1:54:35] don't move they don't give they just
[1:54:37] maneuver his body and cells
[1:54:40] away that's the way every believer he
[1:54:42] does a run from pillar to to post from
[1:54:45] place to place a Methodist this week a
[1:54:48] Baptist next week and to W this
[1:54:52] this week and another one next week he
[1:54:54] just sets his faith in God's Eternal
[1:54:58] Word and sells away riding on the waves
[1:55:01] of riding on the waves on the of the
[1:55:14] air and in John 6 verse 48 Jesus Christ
[1:55:17] says I am the bread I am that bread of
[1:55:19] life this is the bread which cometh down
[1:55:22] from Heaven that a a man may eat
[1:55:25] therefore and not die I am the living
[1:55:28] bread which came down from heaven If any
[1:55:31] man eat of this bread he shall live
[1:55:34] forever and bread and and the bread that
[1:55:37] I will give is my flesh which I will
[1:55:40] give for the life for the life of the
[1:55:44] world Jesus is saying that he is the
[1:55:46] manner that came down from heaven he's
[1:55:47] the manner that felt that if men eat you
[1:55:50] will not just eat but you have to truly
[1:55:53] receive him by eating and by truly
[1:55:55] receiving him by eating you won't
[1:55:58] die and we can also find this in uh
[1:56:01] Revelation when God came down and
[1:56:03] brought the book see that book was bread
[1:56:05] that book was the food for us when that
[1:56:07] book came down it it's when a man eats
[1:56:10] of it they're not going to die they're
[1:56:11] just going to switch Dimensions even if
[1:56:14] their body leaves them but their spirit
[1:56:16] is not dying their spirit is just
[1:56:18] switching demension their spirit is just
[1:56:20] transferring from one place to another
[1:56:22] place to get closer to God you
[1:56:27] see and brother BR says that but thanks
[1:56:30] be to God we got hidden food spiritual
[1:56:33] food that we're living on the goodness
[1:56:36] and mercy of the
[1:56:38] revelation of the revelation of Jesus
[1:56:41] Christ in this last day vindicating
[1:56:43] himself among his people amen they went
[1:56:47] in Elijah went in before the drought set
[1:56:50] in thank God for being in in before the
[1:56:53] Judgment sets in now it's time of coming
[1:56:56] out and going in getting out of those
[1:56:58] organization and getting into Christ and
[1:57:00] coming out and going in time for all
[1:57:02] True Believers then he was called and
[1:57:05] stayed in there remember he never left
[1:57:07] the brook until God called him
[1:57:10] to and notice there was a mill in the
[1:57:13] barrel every time she went after meal
[1:57:17] there was meal in the barrel there was
[1:57:20] meal there was oil in the Cruise every
[1:57:23] time she went for it why meal represent
[1:57:26] Christ in the meal offering their Birds
[1:57:28] had to be set just right to grind
[1:57:31] everyone every one of
[1:57:33] them every bird of this meal exactly the
[1:57:37] same showing that he is the same
[1:57:39] yesterday today and forever that was the
[1:57:41] word the bread of life following message
[1:57:45] to vindicate the word you
[1:57:48] see so it is today friends so it is
[1:57:51] today that the bread of life that the
[1:57:53] children eat follows follows the message
[1:57:57] of God to sustain them during the time
[1:57:59] of drought what if he stood in our
[1:58:02] presence today what if he stood in our
[1:58:04] presence right now he would act he would
[1:58:07] act and do just exactly like he done the
[1:58:10] day when he was in flesh here on the
[1:58:13] earth the bride is part of the husband
[1:58:15] and the the church is the same as Christ
[1:58:19] The Works that I do shall you do also
[1:58:22] and it is the word that done it he told
[1:58:25] us the things that he did that we would
[1:58:28] do also and even greater and if you um
[1:58:33] if you look even at Elijah and Elisha
[1:58:36] when Elijah when Elijah um when Elijah
[1:58:41] had the word with him because in the
[1:58:43] body of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ
[1:58:44] couldn't do as many miracles as he would
[1:58:47] because people lacked Faith they say
[1:58:50] Jesus was blocked because people like
[1:58:52] faith and if you look at the story of uh
[1:58:55] now Jesus in our body even in the body
[1:58:57] of Jesus of uh brother Bram Jesus done
[1:59:01] more miracles than he did in his time
[1:59:03] because there's more faith now than
[1:59:05] there was in his time you see and when I
[1:59:08] look at the story of Elijah and Elisha
[1:59:10] when Elijah multiplied the oil he
[1:59:12] multiplied it for like 3.5 years but if
[1:59:15] you look at Elisha in second king if you
[1:59:18] look at Elisha when he multiplied the
[1:59:20] oil the scripture said that the the um
[1:59:23] the Widow shall live with that oil with
[1:59:27] his son to the rest of their life see he
[1:59:30] multiplied oil for the rest of their
[1:59:32] life see they had unlimited oil for the
[1:59:35] rest of their life for Elijah hisid was
[1:59:38] limited but
[1:59:39] for Elisha it it went on all the way
[1:59:43] till the rest of their life just
[1:59:45] like Jesus when he came in he did what
[1:59:48] he needed to do his was limited and he
[1:59:50] sent down his holy spirit to finish it
[1:59:52] all the way to Eternity you see until
[1:59:55] we're done for the rest of our life here
[1:59:57] and until we merge with with um eternity
[2:00:00] until time merges within
[2:00:03] eternity in Proverbs 31:25 it says
[2:00:07] strength and honor are her clothing
[2:00:08] speaking about
[2:00:10] um the wise the wise woman strength and
[2:00:14] honor are her closing and she shall
[2:00:17] rejoice in time to come she openeth her
[2:00:21] mouth mouth with wisdom and in her mouth
[2:00:24] in her tongue is the law of kindness she
[2:00:27] lookth well to the ways of her household
[2:00:29] and eateth not the bread of idleness you
[2:00:31] see for her to even speak for wisdom to
[2:00:34] come out of her mouth and for her to
[2:00:36] speak the law of kindness that means she
[2:00:37] must have being feeding on the law of
[2:00:38] kindness she must have been feeding on
[2:00:40] the law of kindness and and for her to
[2:00:43] and the Bible says she didn't just spend
[2:00:46] her mind think about Idol stuff and just
[2:00:50] wasting her time doing
[2:00:52] um nonsensical things you
[2:00:55] see even brother Bram say that the mind
[2:00:58] is like the Devil's Playground when
[2:01:00] you're a idol thought is the is the
[2:01:02] Devil's Playground and she did not spend
[2:01:04] her her time eating bread of idol that
[2:01:07] mean eating
[2:01:09] uh eating on other people's
[2:01:11] interpretation eating on other people's
[2:01:13] message but eating on the word of God
[2:01:15] that's why her mouth only wisdom came
[2:01:17] and we know that wisdom is God and the
[2:01:20] law of kindness is God
[2:01:31] himself if the musician could come
[2:01:39] forward uh so far we spoke Al I didn't
[2:01:42] really go in detail a lot but so far we
[2:01:46] spoke about how you see God when he
[2:01:50] comes and sends he wor
[2:01:52] like there was a period of time where
[2:01:54] his word was leaving his word is leaving
[2:01:57] because the famine is creeping in but
[2:01:59] even within that famine God still has
[2:02:01] reserved thousands of people thousands
[2:02:04] of his Believers rather that are dare
[2:02:06] that are dare to believe his word and I
[2:02:08] believe that this afternoon and this
[2:02:10] time at this time right now at this time
[2:02:14] right now I am part of that thousand of
[2:02:15] people that believe the word of God and
[2:02:17] I believe that this church is also part
[2:02:18] of that Ding that God reserved it didn't
[2:02:21] say that men Reserve but God himself
[2:02:23] reserved that thousand to testify of him
[2:02:25] because in every age there's always
[2:02:27] there's always a um there's always a
[2:02:30] witness and we spoke about how you need
[2:02:34] to for you to be in peace and have for
[2:02:36] you to have Grace and peace you need to
[2:02:39] uh you need to have it through the
[2:02:41] knowledge of God not through any type of
[2:02:43] knowledge but through the knowledge of
[2:02:44] God and you gain knowledge by by eating
[2:02:46] you gain knowledge by reading more
[2:02:49] because the Bible says my people perish
[2:02:51] for lack of understand understanding the
[2:02:52] lack of knowledge you see and they and
[2:02:55] it's because people don't
[2:02:57] eat in this time people don't eat a lot
[2:02:59] the word is becoming the word like the
[2:03:02] revealed word I'm not just saying the
[2:03:03] word the revealed word is becoming
[2:03:05] scarce because people are not taking
[2:03:07] their time to actually take to study the
[2:03:10] word
[2:03:12] right because there's a difference
[2:03:14] between just reading and just reading to
[2:03:16] reveal word with the revelation of Jesus
[2:03:17] Christ
[2:03:23] if we could bow our
[2:03:25] heart Lord heavenly father thank you
[2:03:28] Lord Jesus Christ for this opportunity
[2:03:29] that you've given us Lord Jesus Christ
