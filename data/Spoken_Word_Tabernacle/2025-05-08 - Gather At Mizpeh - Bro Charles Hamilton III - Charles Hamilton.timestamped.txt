[30:33] God bless you. Saintless
[30:35] I cannot keep quiet because when I
[30:37] received the message, when I heard the
[30:39] news, it really touches me. It's it's a
[30:42] it's like a month. One of our sister
[30:45] called me from Florida. She sent me a
[30:46] message like in South Africa. Um one of
[30:52] our brother was kidnapped. She's 15
[30:55] years old. She was leaving uh to for
[30:58] school in the morning at 7 a.m.
[31:00] something like that. She never return.
[31:02] She never returned home. So the brother
[31:06] the the brother and the wife made like a
[31:09] group calling all the believer to pray.
[31:11] That's how our sister from Florida sent
[31:14] me the message to to pray. When I heard
[31:17] that I was really really touched. I
[31:18] start I start crying. So I'm like hey I
[31:21] don't have to cry. After crying I need
[31:23] to go pray. So I went to pray. I said,
[31:26] "Lord, I know about the one I'm give a
[31:29] testimony where a certain man lost a his
[31:32] car and you send the angel to get this
[31:35] car." I said, "Father, please if you can
[31:38] do something, go get that that daughter
[31:41] of yours. She's our daughter. Do
[31:43] something." So, we waited. We waited. We
[31:46] keep praying. We keep praying. But when
[31:49] I finished praying, something happened.
[31:52] Something that I know like a certain
[31:54] piece came to me. I spoke to the sister
[31:56] that sent me the message. I said they
[31:58] going to find her. So I told my kids my
[32:02] children, let's pray too so we can find
[32:04] this uh sister of us. She's 15 years
[32:06] old. So we waited yesterday as I opened
[32:10] the the status. I was watching our
[32:12] sister's uh who sent me the message. I
[32:15] was watching her status. She posted she
[32:17] has been found. She she's safe. She's in
[32:20] good health. Nothing happened to her. So
[32:22] I cried. I thank God for that. Thank you
[32:25] Jesus. Thank you Lord. Thank you
[32:29] Lord. Thank you.
[32:32] Thank the name of the Lord be praised
[32:35] tonight. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

[33:12] for the doi the mail key and the for. So
[33:18] last week,
[33:19] Monday, my husband dropped me to work
[33:22] because he had to take his car to
[33:24] something to be done on his car. And I
[33:27] was sitting on the passenger side, he's
[33:29] he drove the car. So I went to work.
[33:31] Coming back, he had to pick me and I
[33:34] couldn't find that key. And we looked
[33:37] all over. We we removed everything that
[33:42] we knew to remove in that car. we
[33:44] couldn't find the key at work at I mean
[33:47] everything I announced it so in the
[33:50] process we were praying so that is
[33:53] Monday Tuesday Wednesday Friday now in
[33:56] between this time um I usually uh help
[34:00] my brother with his children's school
[34:02] fees but he did something to me that I
[34:05] didn't like so I said now until you do
[34:07] this I'm not going to pay the school
[34:09] fees
[34:11] but I know
[34:14] But then my husband kept on saying, "But
[34:16] the the child didn't do anything wrong."
[34:18] I said, "No, they've taken advantage of
[34:20] me so long. All these years, I'm not
[34:22] doing it." So that Friday, I just
[34:26] thought and I said, "You know what? Let
[34:28] me just go ahead and pay the school
[34:30] fees." So I paid the school fees and as
[34:34] I was leaving work I got into my car and
[34:38] as if it was a force I just went in
[34:42] between in between the car and the
[34:44] console my hand just went down like that
[34:48] and I'm like Lord five grace and he was
[34:53] just waiting for me to do the right
[34:54] thing. I I'm so glad I just I just
[34:58] started crying in that parking lot
[35:00] there. I knelt down. I raised my hands
[35:02] up. I kept on crying. I called one of my
[35:05] sisters and I was just crying. He said,
[35:06] "No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop." I said,
[35:08] "No, no, no. This is too good. I can't
[35:10] even hold my tears." So, I want to thank
[35:12] God for that.
[35:16] Amen. And amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[35:21] Amen.
[35:23] Amen. Let us
[35:24] pray. Father, we thank you, Lord God,

[36:59] God, but you know all things, Father.
[37:01] Lord, we pray, Lord God, for the tithes
[37:03] and offerings, Lord God, and the

[59:55] If I have a lawyer in the church, he

[1:06:23] "And it came to pass at that time when
[1:06:25] Eli was laid down in his place and his
[1:06:28] eyes began to wax dim that he could not

[1:06:32] light with your vision. Amen. And we

[1:07:16] And it reads, "And it came to pass while

[1:07:21] Girum." Amen. That the time was long,
[1:07:24] for it was 20 years, and all the house
[1:07:26] of the Lord lamented after the Lord.
[1:07:28] House of Israel lamented after the Lord.
[1:07:30] And Samuel spake unto all the house of
[1:07:33] Israel, saying, "If you" So, this is a
[1:07:35] prophet speaking now. It says, "And
[1:07:37] Samuel spake unto all the house of
[1:07:39] Israel, saying, if you do return unto
[1:07:42] the Lord with all your hearts." Amen.
[1:07:44] What what did the prophet come to do?
[1:07:46] Amen. He said he said, "If you do return
[1:07:48] to the Lord with all your hearts, then
[1:07:50] put away the strange gods and from among
[1:07:53] you." And you know, we know who that is.
[1:07:55] Amen. That that's that's the false gods.
[1:07:57] And prepare your hearts unto the Lord
[1:07:59] and serve him only. And he will deliver
[1:08:01] you out of the hand of the Philistines.
[1:08:03] Amen. And it says, "And the children of
[1:08:05] Israel did put away Balam and Asharoth
[1:08:08] and serve the Lord only." Amen. And
[1:08:10] Samuel said, "This is the prophet
[1:08:12] speaking, gather all gather all Israel
[1:08:15] to Mispa." Amen. Mispa, and I will and I
[1:08:19] will pray for you unto the Lord. Amen.
[1:08:21] You may you may be seated. Amen. So the
[1:08:23] um I my title for today is gather at
[1:08:27] mispa. Amen. I um uh I was listening to
[1:08:30] a message and brother Ben Brandon was
[1:08:32] saying, you know, when you're trying to
[1:08:33] prepare a message, you know, how he said
[1:08:34] how a preacher ought to prepare a
[1:08:36] message is when they're reading their
[1:08:38] Bible and something strikes their heart,
[1:08:40] a word strikes them, you know, it's just
[1:08:41] take take that word and and go go behind
[1:08:44] a pulpit and the Lord will give the
[1:08:45] rest. Amen. So, so that's what I'm
[1:08:50] doing. Amen. Amen. And um and the Lord
[1:08:54] says something very powerful Sunday. He
[1:08:57] said, you know, when you see something,
[1:08:59] um, he was commenting on the the
[1:09:01] furlongs. He said, when you see
[1:09:03] something that you just usually would
[1:09:04] pass, you know, to pay attention to it.
[1:09:06] Yes, sir. Amen. So, I went back, you
[1:09:08] know, and I I started paying attention
[1:09:10] to the names of the places that we read
[1:09:12] in the scriptures. Amen. And when you
[1:09:14] look at the names of the places, you
[1:09:16] know, they're usually two words or a
[1:09:18] long word, you know, but they mean
[1:09:20] things. Amen. And they always name a
[1:09:22] place after something happens. Amen.
[1:09:24] That's right. Amen. and and and and um
[1:09:27] so I want to start with uh verse two um
[1:09:30] in chapter 7. It's um we look at when
[1:09:33] we're reading it, it says, "And it came
[1:09:34] to pass while the ark abode in Kirjath
[1:09:37] Gerham." Amen. So I stopped there and I
[1:09:39] said, "What does that word mean?" Amen.
[1:09:41] So I went and and I found out that
[1:09:44] Kirjaf Gerham is also called Bala or
[1:09:48] Kirajath Baal. Amen. We know every time
[1:09:50] we see Baal, Amen, we know that's
[1:09:52] referencing to Balum. Amen. And we know
[1:09:55] that was a false god. Amen. And and the
[1:09:58] the term the the definition of the word
[1:10:00] itself is city of forest. Amen. It's we
[1:10:03] know a forest is a wilderness. And we
[1:10:05] know the wilderness types the world.
[1:10:07] Amen. And we know that the Lord says
[1:10:08] that you cannot serve God in a mammon.
[1:10:10] Amen. So then, you know, because I've
[1:10:12] been reading Samuel and you go and you
[1:10:15] read the book of Samuel up to this
[1:10:16] point, you see that what was going on
[1:10:19] was that they they were they were um
[1:10:23] they they they were disrespecting God
[1:10:25] and how they were going they were uh
[1:10:27] living after the other gods. Amen.
[1:10:29] Because we see that when the Philistines
[1:10:31] came, Amen. when they first fought the
[1:10:34] Philistines, um because so Samuel went
[1:10:37] Oh, I'm sorry. I I'll go back. I'll go
[1:10:40] back. So, let's go to um let's go let's
[1:10:43] go to uh to 1 Samuel. Let's go
[1:10:47] to let's go to let's go to three. Let's
[1:10:51] go to three.
[1:10:54] Amen. Amen. And we're going to let's
[1:10:56] start at uh verse 10.
[1:10:59] Amen. And it says, "And the Lord came
[1:11:03] and stood and called as other time,
[1:11:05] Samuel." Samuel. Then Samuel answered,
[1:11:07] "Speak for thy servant heareth." Amen.
[1:11:09] And the Lord said to Samuel, "Behold, I
[1:11:11] will do a thing in Israel, at which both
[1:11:13] the ears of everyone that hearth it
[1:11:15] shall tingle, and in that day I will
[1:11:17] perform against Eli all things which I
[1:11:19] have spoken concerning his house. When I
[1:11:22] begin, I will also make an end. For I
[1:11:24] have told him that I will judge his
[1:11:26] house forever for the iniquity which he
[1:11:28] knoweth." Amen. Because his sons, they
[1:11:30] were they were sleeping with the with
[1:11:32] with the uh with with the with the women
[1:11:35] in in in the church. Amen. Amen. and and
[1:11:37] they and they were taking more than they
[1:11:39] ought to eat when they were giving
[1:11:40] offerings. Amen. Amen. That Amen. Amen.
[1:11:44] And so we see that what was going on was
[1:11:47] that, you know, they weren't doing
[1:11:48] right. And we know that, you know, you
[1:11:50] can't expect God to to back you up when
[1:11:52] you're not doing right. Amen. Amen. And
[1:11:54] and so if you go to uh chapter 4, Amen.
[1:11:58] Uh 1st Samuel 4. Amen. If you go to if
[1:12:02] you go to uh go to verse 7, Amen. And it
[1:12:07] reads, it reads that, "And the
[1:12:09] Philistines were afraid, for they said,
[1:12:11] God has come into the camp, and they
[1:12:13] said, "Woe unto us, for there have not
[1:12:15] been such a thing before. Woe unto us.
[1:12:17] Who shall deliver us out of the hands of
[1:12:19] these mighty gods." Amen. Who are they
[1:12:21] talking about? They're talking about the
[1:12:22] Israelites. Amen. They're calling them
[1:12:24] gods because they were children of God,
[1:12:26] were they not? Amen. They were they were
[1:12:27] the children of God. But in in this in
[1:12:30] this mo in this instance that we're
[1:12:31] talking about right now, they weren't
[1:12:33] doing right. Amen. that they were they
[1:12:35] were uh they were discussing the God's
[1:12:37] law. Amen. And and um and so see even
[1:12:42] the even others know who you are. Amen.
[1:12:44] So and even when you're doing wrong,
[1:12:46] even when you're um not when you're
[1:12:49] doing wrong, that doesn't take away from
[1:12:50] who you are. Amen. Because it says that
[1:12:52] it says that um these are the gods that
[1:12:55] smoke the Egyptians and all the plagues
[1:12:57] in the wilderness. Amen. And then as we
[1:12:59] as we drop down, we see that um they
[1:13:01] ended up they ended up slaying them. the
[1:13:03] the Philistine it says verse 10 it says
[1:13:06] and the Philistines fought and Israel
[1:13:07] was smitten and they fled every man into
[1:13:10] his tent and there was a very great
[1:13:12] great slaughter for their fellow fell of
[1:13:14] Israel 30,000 footmen amen so and so we
[1:13:19] see
[1:13:19] that the Israel the Israelites when they
[1:13:22] came against the Philistines they lost
[1:13:25] amen and and I want to go to back to
[1:13:28] verse verse seven I mean chapter seven
[1:13:31] I'm sorry and we see that Kiraf Jirum
[1:13:34] where the ark was. Amen. This is after
[1:13:37] they took the ark from the Israelites.
[1:13:39] And then they then then because the Lord
[1:13:41] started um uh uh hitting them with
[1:13:44] plagues. So they returned it back. Amen.
[1:13:46] But they returned to the wrong place.
[1:13:48] They returned it to Kirjath Gerham which
[1:13:50] is a city of forest. Amen. They were
[1:13:52] still doing wrong. They they weren't uh
[1:13:54] they were still uh not right with God.
[1:13:56] Amen. And then Samuel says uh gather to
[1:14:00] Mispa. Amen. And what does mispa mean?
[1:14:02] Amen. Misbah means watchtower. Amen. So
[1:14:05] this is the prophet telling them to come
[1:14:07] to the watchtowwer. Amen. And what
[1:14:10] happened there? What did they do? Amen.
[1:14:12] And in in chapter verse six it says,
[1:14:15] "And they gathered together to mispos.
[1:14:17] They were obedient and they drew water
[1:14:19] and poured it out before the Lord." And
[1:14:21] so what so I'm getting to that later. It
[1:14:23] says, "And fasted on that day and said
[1:14:26] there, we have sinned against the Lord.
[1:14:28] And Samuel judged the children of of of
[1:14:31] Israel in Mispa. Amen. So this is they
[1:14:32] were they were judged there as well.
[1:14:34] Amen. And I want to read I want to read
[1:14:36] a quote from brother Brandham in the
[1:14:38] letting off the pressure 1962. This is
[1:14:42] uh this is paragraph 34. He says his
[1:14:46] name is a tower a great mighty tower of
[1:14:49] refuge. Amen. Such a ch such a tower
[1:14:52] that when we come into it he gives us
[1:14:54] this assurance. Ask the father anything
[1:14:56] in the great name of this tower. It'll
[1:14:58] be given to you. Watch it. Come into it.
[1:15:01] Be born into it. Amen. Then ask the
[1:15:03] father anything you want to in that name
[1:15:05] and watch him honor. Amen. What kind of
[1:15:07] a tower? A tower of refuge. Amen. See
[1:15:10] what what were what were the cities of
[1:15:12] refuge made for? It was made for those
[1:15:14] who were unrighteous. Amen. Who who who
[1:15:16] who committed sins. Amen. Amen. And this
[1:15:19] said and this says um that we can go in
[1:15:21] there and that the word the Lord is the
[1:15:23] word. Amen. So, so he's also showing us
[1:15:26] that that the tower, this tower of
[1:15:28] refuge is also the word. Amen. And in
[1:15:31] the beginning was the word and the word
[1:15:33] was with God and the word was God and
[1:15:35] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:15:37] us. He says again, if he abide in me, he
[1:15:39] says the tower, my word abide in you.
[1:15:42] Now, that's when you're on the inside,
[1:15:44] not when you're on the outside looking
[1:15:46] in, but when you're in here looking out.
[1:15:48] See, if you abide in me, my words abide
[1:15:51] in you. You can ask what you will, it
[1:15:53] will be done for you. Amen. And I want
[1:15:55] to read some um some some verses from
[1:15:58] from the Bible. It says in Proverbs
[1:15:59] 18:10, it says, "The name of the Lord is
[1:16:02] your strong tower. The righteous runth
[1:16:05] into it and is safe." Amen. In Acts
[1:16:07] 4:12, it says, it says, "Neither is
[1:16:10] there salvation in any other, for there
[1:16:12] is none other name under heaven given
[1:16:14] unto men, whereby we must be saved."
[1:16:17] Amen. In Hebrews, Hebrews 10:1 19-23, it
[1:16:21] says, "Having therefore, brethren,
[1:16:23] boldness to enter into the holiest by
[1:16:25] the blood of Jesus, by a new and living
[1:16:27] way, which we have which he hath
[1:16:28] consecrated for us through the veil,
[1:16:30] that is to say, his flesh, and having an
[1:16:33] high priest over the house of God."
[1:16:34] Amen. And we know, Amen. And let us draw
[1:16:37] near with a true heart and full
[1:16:40] assurance of faith, having our hearts
[1:16:42] sprinkled from all evil conscience, and
[1:16:44] our bodies washed with pure water. Let
[1:16:46] us hold fast to the profession of our
[1:16:48] faith without wavering. Amen. Amen. And
[1:16:51] I want to go to um another another quote
[1:16:54] where brother Brandham says in a former
[1:16:55] and latter reign in 1960. He says we
[1:16:58] have a watchman. Amen. A watchman that
[1:17:01] climbed the ramparts of glory. The Holy
[1:17:03] Spirit was sent back to towering men and
[1:17:05] women who would believe God. Amen. He
[1:17:07] says that's the watchman. The Holy
[1:17:09] Spirit. Amen. To send us uh sent to us
[1:17:13] as a watchman and watches over us. He is
[1:17:15] our guardian. The Holy Spirit was led to
[1:17:17] men to be watchmen over our soul.
[1:17:19] Exactly right. Amen. Men wasn't to watch
[1:17:22] one another. It was the Holy Spirit to
[1:17:24] watch over us. Amen. Amen. Oh, forgive
[1:17:27] me. Forgive me. I didn't I didn't
[1:17:28] believe I prayed. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[1:17:30] Um I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Um
[1:17:34] I'm sorry. Let's let's pray. Amen.
[1:17:36] Forgive me. Amen. Father God, we come to
[1:17:39] you humbly, Lord God. Father God, we ask
[1:17:41] forgiveness, Father God, of our sins, of
[1:17:43] our shortcomings. Father God, of our
[1:17:44] iniquities, Lord God. Father God, we
[1:17:46] pray, Father God, that your will be
[1:17:48] done, Father God, not our will, Lord
[1:17:49] God. Father God, we pray, Father God, we
[1:17:52] came here to hear from you, Lord God,
[1:17:53] not to hear from me, Lord God. Father
[1:17:55] God, we pray, Lord God, that you, Lord
[1:17:57] God, come down, Father God, and give us
[1:17:58] a revelation of what you're saying,
[1:18:00] Father God. You know what your children
[1:18:02] need, Father God. You know what they
[1:18:03] want, Father God. You know what you know
[1:18:05] what's good for them, Father God. Father
[1:18:06] God, may you give them, Father God, what
[1:18:07] they need of, Father God. May be
[1:18:09] correction, Father God. May it be
[1:18:10] uplifting, Father God. May you provide
[1:18:12] it, Lord God. And Father God, we love
[1:18:14] you, Father God. Father God, abound
[1:18:15] every deont you've been forced, Father
[1:18:16] God, of religion, Father God, I bind
[1:18:18] every demon you've been forced, Father
[1:18:19] God, of fear, Father God, of of any
[1:18:21] anything may that that may rise up
[1:18:23] against your word, Father God. The God,
[1:18:26] I bind in the name of Jesus Christ, and
[1:18:27] I cast it out, Father God, every demon
[1:18:29] of slumber, Lord God. Father God, may we
[1:18:31] be attentive to your word, Lord God, in
[1:18:32] Jesus Christ's name we pray, Father God,
[1:18:35] we love you, Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:18:38] Amen. Um, now we're going to go to
[1:18:39] Revelation chapter 4 number two in 1961.
[1:18:44] Uh, Brother Brandham says, "Now what is
[1:18:45] a man? He's a triune being. Body, soul,
[1:18:48] spirit." How many knows that? Watch
[1:18:51] God's approach. What is his heart? You
[1:18:54] remember my message. God chose a man's
[1:18:56] heart for his control tower. Amen. Devil
[1:18:59] chose his head for the control tower.
[1:19:01] See, he makes him see things. Look
[1:19:02] through his eyes. But God in his heart
[1:19:05] makes him believe things that he cannot
[1:19:06] see. Amen. See, God is in his heart. The
[1:19:10] heart of man is the throne of God. Amen.
[1:19:12] And we know that the ark, the ark of the
[1:19:14] Lord, um the the ark of the covenant is
[1:19:16] as well is his throne. Amen. And the ark
[1:19:18] is in the throne of man. Amen. Amen. So
[1:19:21] he says in the works of faith expressed,
[1:19:22] brother Brennham says when it's directed
[1:19:24] from the inside, it throws all it throws
[1:19:27] all the rest of it together. That's the
[1:19:29] godpost. Amen. That's the control tower,
[1:19:31] the inside of the inside. The soul
[1:19:34] controls the spirit. The spirit controls
[1:19:35] the body. Amen. And and and and in and
[1:19:38] countdown, brother Bam says the
[1:19:40] spiritual now astronaut has a control
[1:19:42] tower. He says he says now it's down
[1:19:45] here. He said it's not down there like a
[1:19:47] man is. It's up there. Amen. It's the
[1:19:50] Holy Ghost that's in him that's
[1:19:52] controlling him. A tower of the baptism
[1:19:54] of the Holy Ghost. It's under control.
[1:19:56] Keeps him in control by the word. Amen.
[1:19:59] Now, not in a bunch of fanaticism, some
[1:20:01] whooped up nonsense, but thus saith the
[1:20:04] Lord. Amen. And it happens. It's always
[1:20:07] under control. Amen. He's got a control
[1:20:10] tower. That's the Holy Ghost. Amen. And
[1:20:12] the word is his program. And he lays
[1:20:14] right into that program. And the power
[1:20:16] of the Holy Ghost endows him to move
[1:20:18] out. And it brings the achievement that
[1:20:20] God wants to be achieved for his people
[1:20:22] that he might fulfill what he promised.
[1:20:24] Amen. Amen. And um I want to I want to
[1:20:27] uh uh um uh clarify something as well.
[1:20:30] Amen. That um we see when when we're
[1:20:32] reading Amen. When we read this, it says
[1:20:34] uh Samuel said, "Gather all Israel to
[1:20:36] Mispa." Amen. Now, we know when we read
[1:20:38] in other places, we have Elias and we
[1:20:40] have Elijah. Amen. So, you see how
[1:20:42] they're spelled two different ways, but
[1:20:44] they mean the same thing. Amen. If you
[1:20:46] go to Genesis 31, Amen. We see that is
[1:20:49] misb a. Amen. And and it means the same
[1:20:52] thing. It means watchtower as well. And
[1:20:54] as I was reading it, I saw something
[1:20:56] else in there that, you know, I believe
[1:20:57] the Lord wanted me to see. Amen. It was
[1:21:00] that um I I want try to see it also.
[1:21:02] Amen. Let's go to Genesis 31. Going go
[1:21:05] to Genesis Genesis 31 of verse 44. Amen.
[1:21:11] And remember, we're talking about the
[1:21:12] watchtowwer. Amen.
[1:21:16] Chapter
[1:21:17] 31 verse 44. Yes, sir.
[1:21:22] When you say there, when we get there,
[1:21:23] say amen. Amen. Okay. Now, what this is,
[1:21:26] this story is is covering when uh Jacob
[1:21:30] when Laban, you know, uh uh tricked
[1:21:32] Jacob into giving him Leah. Amen. And
[1:21:34] then he gave him Rachel. Amen. And so,
[1:21:36] this is just so you know the context of
[1:21:38] what's going on. Amen. And verse uh
[1:21:41] verse 44, it says uh let's go back one
[1:21:45] one one verse, verse 43. And Laban
[1:21:48] answered and said unto Jacob, "These
[1:21:50] daughters are my daughters. These
[1:21:51] children are my children, and these
[1:21:53] cattle are my cattle. and all that thou
[1:21:55] seeth is mine. What can I do this day
[1:21:57] unto thee my daughters or unto unto
[1:22:00] these my daughters or unto their
[1:22:01] children which I have born? Amen.
[1:22:03] Because Jacob was trying to leave. Amen.
[1:22:05] And he says, "And now therefore, and
[1:22:07] something had to happen before he could
[1:22:09] leave." Amen. He says in verse 44, it
[1:22:11] says, "Now therefore, come now, let us
[1:22:14] make a covenant." Amen. And I in thou, I
[1:22:17] and you. And let it be for a witness
[1:22:19] between me and you. Amen. Now, let's
[1:22:21] drop to verse 47. It's uh he says it
[1:22:25] says and Laban called it jear uh jeggar
[1:22:29] sa sah sahadua and Jacob called it
[1:22:33] galed. Amen. These these means a heap
[1:22:35] for a witness. They they both mean the
[1:22:36] same thing heap the heap of witness.
[1:22:38] Amen. And we go and we continue in verse
[1:22:41] 48. It says and Laban said this heap is
[1:22:44] a witness between me and you this day.
[1:22:46] Therefore uh therefore was the name of
[1:22:49] it called Gallid. And 49 says in mispa.
[1:22:51] Amen. For he said, "The Lord watch
[1:22:54] between me and you when we are absent
[1:22:56] from one another." Amen. If thou shall
[1:22:58] afflict my daughters or if thou shalt
[1:23:00] take other wives beside my daughters, no
[1:23:03] man, he says, "No man is with us." See,
[1:23:05] God is witness between me and you. Amen.
[1:23:08] And in chapter 5, in verse 55, it says,
[1:23:10] "And early in the morning, Laban rose up
[1:23:13] and kissed his sons and his daughters
[1:23:14] and blessed them. And Laban departed and
[1:23:16] returned unto his place." Amen. What I
[1:23:19] wanted to get out of this was what I saw
[1:23:20] was that um Mispa was also a witness.
[1:23:23] Amen. So it's a watchtower and it's a
[1:23:25] witness. Amen. And and the purpose of it
[1:23:28] was that he couldn't uh Jacob couldn't
[1:23:32] leave until Laban blessed his marriage.
[1:23:35] Amen. So at Mispa the marriage was
[1:23:38] blessed. Amen. Amen. And and also um he
[1:23:42] says who and who blessed that marriage?
[1:23:44] The father blessed the marriage. Laban
[1:23:45] blessed that marriage. the father and it
[1:23:48] was a private meeting. Amen. Because if
[1:23:50] you if if you go back in verse 25, you
[1:23:54] know, uh Msba was the place where the
[1:23:57] contract was sealed. Amen. Now, if if
[1:24:00] you go to if you if you go to verse 25,
[1:24:03] you could see, okay, exactly where.
[1:24:06] Amen. And 25 says, then Laban took
[1:24:09] overtook Jacob. Now, Jacob had pitched
[1:24:11] his tent in the mount. What mount? We
[1:24:13] don't know. And Laban with his brethren
[1:24:16] pitch in the mount of Gilead. So this
[1:24:18] happened in the mount of Gilead. Amen.
[1:24:20] And the prophet tells us in uh in the
[1:24:23] bomb and there's bomb in Gilead in 1954.
[1:24:26] He says GGilead is the church. Amen. So
[1:24:29] so this was a meeting between the father
[1:24:32] of of the bride and the and the
[1:24:35] bridegroom. A secret meeting. It was
[1:24:37] just them two at that meeting. Amen. It
[1:24:39] it was just them. Amen. And and when
[1:24:42] they have that meeting, Amen. They made
[1:24:43] a contract. He said, "If you take any
[1:24:45] other wife, you can't take no one else."
[1:24:47] Amen. You're stuck with with this wife
[1:24:49] right here. Amen. Amen. See, he said,
[1:24:51] "You can't take no one else." Amen. And
[1:24:53] and it it it was it was a it's a secret
[1:24:55] meeting. Amen. And and and and it it was
[1:24:58] a blessing when I read that. Amen. And
[1:25:00] and um Amen. Amen. And I want to
[1:25:03] continue. I want to go back to uh to
[1:25:08] to Samuel Samuel 1st Samuel uh 7. Amen.
[1:25:17] 1st Samuel chapter 7.
[1:25:22] And we're going to continue in verse
[1:25:23] six. And it says, "And they gathered to
[1:25:26] mispa and drew water." Amen. I want to I
[1:25:29] I want to stop there with drew water.
[1:25:30] Okay. What is happening? Why are they
[1:25:32] drawing water? Amen. What What is meant?
[1:25:34] You know, because we know that, you
[1:25:35] know, the the Bible is a book of types,
[1:25:37] book of Revelation. Amen. What did this
[1:25:39] mean when they were drawing water? Amen.
[1:25:41] And if you go to Psalm 62, it says, "And
[1:25:44] God is my salvation and my glory, the
[1:25:46] rock of my strength, and my refuge is in
[1:25:48] God." And in verse 8, it says, "Trust in
[1:25:51] him at all times, ye people. Pour out
[1:25:53] your heart before him. God is a refuge
[1:25:56] for us." Salah. Amen. So they're at the
[1:25:59] refuge. They're at Mispa. Amen. And
[1:26:01] they're pouring out their heart to him.
[1:26:03] Amen. And it's then and then in in Sam 2
[1:26:06] Samuel 14:14 it says for we must needs
[1:26:09] die and are as waters spilled on the
[1:26:11] ground which cannot be gathered up
[1:26:14] again. Neither neither does God respect
[1:26:16] any person yet doth he devise any means
[1:26:19] that his banish be not expelled from
[1:26:21] him. Meaning this is God's provided way.
[1:26:23] You can't get past this. Amen. So when
[1:26:25] you're at Mispa, amen, when you're at
[1:26:27] the watchtowwer, when you're at that
[1:26:28] witness place, amen, you have to pull
[1:26:30] yourself out unto God. Amen. And you
[1:26:33] have to die to yourself. Amen. And in
[1:26:35] Joel
[1:26:36] 2:11-13, it says, "And the Lord shall
[1:26:39] utter his voice before his army, for his
[1:26:41] camp is very great, for he is strong and
[1:26:47] executable. Who can abide it? Therefore
[1:26:50] also now sayaith the Lord, turn ye even
[1:26:52] to me with all your heart, and with
[1:26:54] fasting, with weeping, with mourning."
[1:26:56] It says, "Ren your heart and not your
[1:26:58] garments, and turn unto the Lord your
[1:27:00] God, for he is gracious and merciful and
[1:27:02] slow to anger." Amen. And the signs of
[1:27:04] his coming in 1962, Brother Brigham
[1:27:07] says, "What we need is to get back to
[1:27:09] the word. Get back to the real word of
[1:27:11] God." Amen. And then I'm dropped down.
[1:27:13] He says, "But you got to stay right
[1:27:15] there with the word and believe it. Not
[1:27:17] just slip over here this way and that
[1:27:18] way and say, I'll peck and try." You
[1:27:20] don't do that. You've got to come with a
[1:27:22] whole heart. Amen. Amen. And to continue
[1:27:25] in verse seven, it says, so after they
[1:27:28] poured out their heart, amen, after they
[1:27:29] listened to the prophet, he told them
[1:27:31] what to do, he gave them the
[1:27:32] instructions on how to do it. Amen. And
[1:27:34] uh in verse 7, it says, "And when the
[1:27:36] Philistines heard that the children of
[1:27:37] Israel were gathered together at Mispa."
[1:27:40] Amen. The lords of the Philistines went
[1:27:41] up against Israel. And when the children
[1:27:44] of Israel heard it, they were afraid of
[1:27:45] of the Philistines. Amen. So what I saw
[1:27:48] here was that they lost the ark due to
[1:27:50] their iniquity. Amen. But then but then
[1:27:53] they went to Misbah and they got back
[1:27:55] right with God. Amen. And after you get
[1:27:57] back right with God, Amen. that same
[1:27:59] enemy that thought they had you, they
[1:28:01] have to come back. Amen. And they have
[1:28:03] to come back and try you to see your
[1:28:05] they have to try that revelation that
[1:28:06] you get that you got now. Amen. See, so
[1:28:10] and and uh and
[1:28:13] because he has to come back and test
[1:28:14] you. Amen. And in Luke
[1:28:17] 11:21-26, Amen. Uh it says when a strong
[1:28:20] man arm keepeth his palace, his goods
[1:28:23] are in peace. But when the stronger than
[1:28:25] he shall come upon him and overcome him,
[1:28:27] he taketh him from all his armor wherein
[1:28:29] he trusted and divideth his spoils. He
[1:28:32] that is not with me is against me. And
[1:28:34] he not and he that gather gatherth not
[1:28:36] with me scatterth. And when the unclean
[1:28:39] spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh
[1:28:41] through dry places seeking rest and find
[1:28:44] none. He saith, I will return to my
[1:28:46] house when I come out. Amen. So after
[1:28:48] you've already after that that that
[1:28:50] demon is gone, it has to try to come
[1:28:52] back. Amen. After you've made yourself
[1:28:54] right with God, amen, it has to come
[1:28:56] back and test you. Amen. He says when he
[1:28:58] cometh, he find it swept and garnished.
[1:29:00] Amen. The strong man is in the house
[1:29:02] now. He can't come back. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:04] It's like when you have a a lease on a
[1:29:06] house and you can't go back. The lease
[1:29:07] is done. It's not it's not for you no
[1:29:09] more. Amen. Amen. And and um to to
[1:29:12] continue on. Amen. uh and to speak to
[1:29:15] the rock and there shall be it shall
[1:29:16] give forth his water in 1960. Uh brother
[1:29:19] Brennham says
[1:29:21] um brother Benham says and when they
[1:29:23] when they saw the Red Sea he's talking
[1:29:25] about he he's talking about um Israel
[1:29:28] again. Amen. He says when they saw the
[1:29:30] Red Sea that was laying the path of
[1:29:32] duty. Amen. They were on the road
[1:29:35] marching then come out. There was a
[1:29:36] pillar of fire before them and they
[1:29:38] marched on to the Red Sea. And when they
[1:29:40] got there right in the line of duty laid
[1:29:42] an obstacle. Amen. First thing you know,
[1:29:44] fear struck them. So, because you see
[1:29:46] that I was trying to figure out why did
[1:29:48] they get afraid? Amen. Because they just
[1:29:50] made themselves right with God. Amen.
[1:29:52] So, why are you getting afraid now?
[1:29:53] Amen. And and they got afraid. And then
[1:29:56] and brother Ben, he says that's the way
[1:29:58] people does today. Amen. When fear
[1:30:00] strikes them, when they're right in the
[1:30:01] path of duty, he says, "Listen, brother,
[1:30:04] let me say this. If you're walking in
[1:30:06] the light, having fellowship with God,
[1:30:08] with his people, and the Holy Spirit is
[1:30:10] upon you, and you meet the obstacle
[1:30:12] right in the path of duty, don't stop.
[1:30:14] Amen. Just keep pressing on. Amen. God
[1:30:17] will make your way through it. Amen.
[1:30:19] There, that's one of the greatest
[1:30:20] experiences in my life. Amen. That's the
[1:30:22] greatest experience of the prophet's
[1:30:24] life. Amen. And then um now we're going
[1:30:27] to continue. Amen. We're going to
[1:30:28] continue reading. Amen. And then it says
[1:30:30] in verse 8, "And the children of Israel
[1:30:33] said to Samuel, cease not to cry unto
[1:30:35] the Lord our God for us, for he will
[1:30:37] save us out of the hand of the
[1:30:38] Philistines." Amen. And Samuel took a
[1:30:41] sucking lamb. Amen. And offer it for a
[1:30:43] burnt offering holy unto the Lord. Amen.
[1:30:45] And Samuel cried unto the Lord for us.
[1:30:47] And the Lord heard him. Amen. And Sam,
[1:30:50] so we see that the offering was given.
[1:30:52] Amen. After they already made themselves
[1:30:54] right. Amen. And when I was reading
[1:30:56] this, I said, I thank God. Amen. that we
[1:30:58] had one offering and that's all we
[1:31:00] needed. Amen. We we we don't need
[1:31:02] multiple offerings. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:31:05] When it was a done deal, he said it was
[1:31:06] finished. Amen. Amen. And then and then
[1:31:09] uh verse 10 it says, "And as Samuel was
[1:31:12] offering up the burnt offering, the
[1:31:14] Philistines drew near to battle against
[1:31:16] Israel. But the Lord thundered with a
[1:31:18] great thunder on that day upon the
[1:31:20] Philistines and discomforted them. They
[1:31:22] were smitten before Israel." Amen. See,
[1:31:25] so in in verse 10, what I what I noticed
[1:31:27] was that after they made themselves
[1:31:29] right with God and then Satan came back
[1:31:32] to them. Amen. A thunder was opened.
[1:31:35] Amen. Amen. A thunder. Amen. And and
[1:31:38] what did it do? It discomed them. Amen.
[1:31:41] Disconfitted means to confuse. Amen. And
[1:31:44] we know that Satan can't understand the
[1:31:46] thunder. Amen. Amen. And and and and we
[1:31:51] know that. See, so the so the this
[1:31:53] thunder discomfeitted them. Amen. And we
[1:31:55] know that the revelation of the seventh
[1:31:57] seal discomits Satan. Amen. And and only
[1:32:00] the bride has the right to that
[1:32:01] revelation. Amen. Because that's what
[1:32:04] arms the bride. Amen. And and that's
[1:32:06] what arms the bride because if he
[1:32:08] understood it, if he could grasp it,
[1:32:10] then he would have been converted. But
[1:32:12] we know that he can't be converted.
[1:32:13] Amen. Amen. See, so so when I was
[1:32:16] reading that, I was like, isn't that
[1:32:17] something how you after you make
[1:32:19] yourself right with God, you have right
[1:32:21] to the thunder. Amen. You you have right
[1:32:23] of access to that. Amen. And we see they
[1:32:25] didn't do anything for it. It came,
[1:32:27] Father God, when um it came. Amen. And
[1:32:30] when the and when the the Philistines uh
[1:32:32] came to them, amen, they didn't have to
[1:32:34] do anything. Amen. God took care of it.
[1:32:37] Amen. And and and the and verse 11, it
[1:32:40] says, "And the men of Israel went out of
[1:32:42] Misbah." So after the thunder opened,
[1:32:44] amen, they were armed with the word.
[1:32:46] They got a stimulation of the
[1:32:47] revelation. Amen. And it says, and and
[1:32:50] they left. Amen. It says, "And the men
[1:32:51] of Israel went out of Mispa and pursued
[1:32:54] the Philistines." And what did they do?
[1:32:56] They smoked them until they came to Beth
[1:32:58] Carr. Amen. So what does Beth car mean?
[1:33:01] Beth car is sheep house. Amen. And it
[1:33:03] says they came under Beth Carr. Amen.
[1:33:05] And we know within the scriptures, it
[1:33:07] says that he will make your enemies your
[1:33:09] foottool. Amen. So, and we know that we
[1:33:11] are we are the sheep. We're tied as the
[1:33:13] sheep as well. Amen. And we also know
[1:33:15] that, you know, the sheep is ley and and
[1:33:17] we're supposed the Lord wants us to do
[1:33:20] something as well. Amen. So, so the Lord
[1:33:23] started started the battle. Amen. See,
[1:33:25] Jesus started the fight, but we have to
[1:33:27] continue the fight. Amen. Amen. Because
[1:33:29] he he took care of it at first when he
[1:33:31] opened the seal. Amen. And now it's up
[1:33:32] to us. Amen. To continue pursuing after
[1:33:34] the Philistines. Amen. Amen. And then um
[1:33:38] in verse 12 it reads, "And Samuel took a
[1:33:40] stone." Amen. So now he has a
[1:33:42] revelation. We know a stone that's a
[1:33:44] revelation. Amen. And set it between
[1:33:47] mispa and shen. Amen. So then I looked
[1:33:49] and I said, "So what does shen mean?"
[1:33:51] And shen means the tooth. I was okay.
[1:33:54] What does what does the tooth has to go
[1:33:56] with this? There's a re there's a
[1:33:57] revelation between there's a revelation
[1:34:00] between the watchtower and the tooth. So
[1:34:02] what what is connecting that? Amen. So,
[1:34:06] um, I was reading and and in Proverbs
[1:34:09] 25:19, it says, "Confidence in an unf,"
[1:34:11] it says, I'm sorry, it says, "Confidence
[1:34:13] in an unfaithful man in the time of
[1:34:16] trouble is like a broken tooth." Amen.
[1:34:18] And a foot out of joint. Amen. So, so
[1:34:22] who is your confidence in? Amen. Cuz our
[1:34:24] God is faithful. Amen. Amen. See, see.
[1:34:27] Amen. So, we have a revel we have, we
[1:34:29] have a consolation, a revelation between
[1:34:32] a watchtower. Amen. Uh uh because when
[1:34:35] the enemy comes in like a flood, he will
[1:34:37] bring up a great standard against it.
[1:34:38] Amen. We have revelation between that
[1:34:40] and we have a revelation and we have
[1:34:42] revelation within the faithful man.
[1:34:44] Amen. Amen. And and and then as you
[1:34:47] continue reading it says and the name of
[1:34:48] it and and they call the name of it, the
[1:34:51] stone, the revelation of it, Ebenezer.
[1:34:53] Amen. And then Ebenezer is stone of
[1:34:55] hell. Amen. Because they realized that
[1:34:57] it wasn't us who did this. Amen. It was
[1:34:59] a God who came and did this. Amen. Amen.
[1:35:02] Amen. And and then um and then and then
[1:35:05] because we know we that there's a
[1:35:06] there's a revelation between that tower
[1:35:08] and that in the time of need, you know,
[1:35:10] we we can rely on on that faithful man.
[1:35:12] Amen. Amen. And uh to to continue in uh
[1:35:16] a testimony of the sea, brother Brandham
[1:35:18] says, he says, "Brethren, no matter what
[1:35:21] people say and how much anyone wants to
[1:35:24] disbelieve, I'm certain sure now after
[1:35:26] today that we're not following a faker."
[1:35:28] Amen. We're following nothing less than
[1:35:30] God. Amen. For no man can do what he did
[1:35:33] unless it was God. Amen. I knew that. I
[1:35:36] knew that could have been no less than
[1:35:38] Jehovah because he acted like Jehovah
[1:35:40] did. Only Jehovah can create. Amen. And
[1:35:43] I know that that man is not a faker.
[1:35:45] There there's only one creator and
[1:35:47] that's Jehovah. And out of all the
[1:35:49] things I've seen that satisfied me.
[1:35:51] Amen. I want you to know now that my
[1:35:53] heart is completely surrendered. Amen.
[1:35:56] So what I got out of that was that was
[1:35:58] that that we're that God is not a faker.
[1:36:01] Amen. So when we have that revelation of
[1:36:03] him being that faithful man. Amen.
[1:36:05] Because we have because when when when
[1:36:07] something happens in the scriptures is
[1:36:08] always a memorial that that follows
[1:36:10] behind it. And the memorial they took
[1:36:12] was that stone. Amen. And so we're going
[1:36:15] to continue reading and it says, "So the
[1:36:17] Philistines were subdued and they came
[1:36:19] no more in the coast of Israel." Amen.
[1:36:21] So after the showdown happened, Amen.
[1:36:24] that the the Philistines were finally
[1:36:26] subdued. They came no more into the
[1:36:27] coast. They were abandoned and they
[1:36:28] can't they they knew not to mess with
[1:36:30] this person no more. Amen. Amen. And we
[1:36:32] see that um that you know the devil now
[1:36:35] has to come no more. Amen. Because a
[1:36:36] strong man is in the house now. Amen. We
[1:36:38] know that the house is your heart. Amen.
[1:36:40] We know that the devil's been his lease
[1:36:43] expired and it's time to move out. Amen.
[1:36:45] And and we're going to continue reading
[1:36:47] and it says that um they came no more
[1:36:49] into the coast of Israel and the hand of
[1:36:51] the Lord was against the Philistines all
[1:36:53] the days of Samuel. Amen. And and then
[1:36:56] continue reading and it says the cities
[1:36:58] which the Philistines had taken from
[1:37:00] Israel were restored to Israel. Amen. So
[1:37:03] after they overtook the Philistines,
[1:37:05] there was a restoration that followed.
[1:37:07] Amen. And it says that and it says that
[1:37:10] um is that from Echron even unto Gath.
[1:37:14] Amen. the coast in the coast thereof did
[1:37:16] Israel deliver out of the hands of the
[1:37:18] Philistines and there was peace between
[1:37:20] Israel and the Amorites. So then I went
[1:37:22] back and I said okay Lord so what does
[1:37:24] Echron mean? Amen. So I I looked at
[1:37:26] echon it means eradication. Amen. So
[1:37:29] after the Philistines were eradicated.
[1:37:31] Amen. They went to they were eradicated
[1:37:33] even unto Gath. Amen. And uh I stay on
[1:37:37] Echron for a second. So in 1st Samuel
[1:37:39] 175 52 um Echron pops up again. Amen.
[1:37:43] And this is after David slew Goliath. In
[1:37:46] verse 52 it says, "And the men of Israel
[1:37:48] and of Judah arose and shouted." So
[1:37:51] after they defeated the Philistines, we
[1:37:53] see a a a continuity between these these
[1:37:57] uh chapters. Amen. We see that the men
[1:37:59] of Israel and of Judah arose and shouted
[1:38:02] and pursued the Philistines. It says
[1:38:04] until they came into the valley into the
[1:38:06] gates of Echron. Amen. and wounded of
[1:38:08] the Philistines and fell down by the way
[1:38:11] to Shyam even unto Gath and unto Achron.
[1:38:14] So there's Gath again. Echron and Gath
[1:38:16] are always together. Amen. And then Amos
[1:38:18] 1 and Amos 1 and8 it reads and I will
[1:38:22] cut off the inhabitant from Ash died and
[1:38:24] him that holdeth the scepter from
[1:38:26] Ashcolon and I will turn my hand against
[1:38:28] Echron and the remnant of the
[1:38:30] Philistines shall perish sayith the Lord
[1:38:32] God. Amen. So we see that Lord is is
[1:38:35] serious about eradicating this Echrron.
[1:38:38] Amen. And in Zephaniah 2:4 it says, "For
[1:38:41] Gaza shall be forsaken and Ashcolon a
[1:38:43] desolation." And she says, "They shall
[1:38:45] drive out Ashdod at the noon day and
[1:38:48] Echron shall be rooted up." Amen. And so
[1:38:51] we see that that Echron is means
[1:38:54] eradication. And we see how the Lord is
[1:38:55] proving it through his word. Amen. And
[1:38:57] then I went to Gath and Gath means wine
[1:38:59] press. Amen. And we know that that wine
[1:39:01] is stimulation of revelation. Amen. And
[1:39:04] so we so now we see that once that Satan
[1:39:07] has been eradicated. Amen. There's a
[1:39:10] revelation that follows it. Amen.
[1:39:12] There's there's a wine that comes
[1:39:13] afterwards. Amen. And we know that
[1:39:15] there's a it's a scarecrow. Amen. We
[1:39:17] know that whenever there's a scarecrow,
[1:39:18] there's a revelation. Amen. Amen. And
[1:39:21] Amen. And um so just to go over Amen. We
[1:39:25] saw that um in verse in verse 5 we see
[1:39:29] that Samuel the prophet is telling them
[1:39:31] to gather at gather at Misbah. Amen. And
[1:39:34] just to recap, Amen. Misbah Misbah means
[1:39:36] a watchtowwer. Amen. And then after they
[1:39:39] left the watch the watchtowwer. Amen.
[1:39:41] They um it says um it it says in verse 7
[1:39:46] that the Philistines heard heard they
[1:39:48] were gathered at Misb. We know that uh
[1:39:49] the Satan came back. Amen. Satan tried
[1:39:51] to um try them again. Amen. And then um
[1:39:55] we see also that um the that the
[1:39:57] children of Israel they were they were
[1:39:59] afraid. Amen. And that they were afraid
[1:40:01] because as a prophet showed us that
[1:40:03] Amen. that when the enemy comes in amen
[1:40:05] uh uh people today they still get
[1:40:07] afraid. Amen. And and that um and that
[1:40:11] and that they asked them they asked uh
[1:40:13] the God to deliver them out of the hand
[1:40:15] of the Philistines. And after amen they
[1:40:18] uh and and after and after they um the
[1:40:21] Lord they the Lord heard their prayers.
[1:40:24] Amen. Um the the uh the Lord brought
[1:40:26] down the thunder. Amen. To help them
[1:40:27] out. Amen. He he discomed them and
[1:40:30] discomed Satan. Amen. And we know that
[1:40:32] that's to the bride. Amen. And then we
[1:40:34] go into um verse 11 to where the men of
[1:40:37] Israel went into Mispa and pursued the
[1:40:39] Philistines and smelled them until they
[1:40:40] came under Beth Carr. Amen. And we know
[1:40:43] that Beth Carr was Beth Carr was the God
[1:40:45] showing us that he wants us to he wants
[1:40:47] us also to um to work as well. Amen. And
[1:40:51] that he'll make the enemies our
[1:40:52] foottool. Amen. And they took a stone.
[1:40:55] Amen. And and uh set it between Mispa
[1:40:57] and Shen. Amen. And Misbah we know.
[1:40:59] Amen. Is a is a watchtower. And Shen was
[1:41:01] the tooth of of of a faithful man. Amen.
[1:41:04] And they came into Ebenezer which was a
[1:41:06] stone of hell. Amen. And then um and
[1:41:09] then and then saying uh hi there too.
[1:41:11] The Lord hath helped us. And we continue
[1:41:13] reading again. It says, "So the
[1:41:13] Philistines were subdued and they came
[1:41:15] the more to the coast of Israel and the
[1:41:17] hand of the Lord was against the
[1:41:18] Philistines all the days of Samuel." And
[1:41:20] then we continue and it says, "The
[1:41:21] cities were the cities which the
[1:41:22] Philistines had taken from Israel were
[1:41:25] restored to Israel." Amen. From Echron,
[1:41:27] which is eradication to Gath. Amen.
[1:41:29] Which is the wine press, the revelation.
[1:41:31] Amen. And the coast in the coast of the
[1:41:34] Israel delivered out of the hands of
[1:41:35] Philistines. There was peace between the
[1:41:37] Philistines and the Amorites. Amen. And
[1:41:39] there's a a quote I wanted to read that
[1:41:42] um brother Benham says. He says in the
[1:41:44] token in 1964 he says if God had spoken
[1:41:47] to me back before the foundation of the
[1:41:49] world when I was a thought in his mind
[1:41:52] and so were you. And he said what age
[1:41:54] would you want to live in? He said right
[1:41:56] now. Amen. This is the most glorious
[1:41:59] time there is. Believe it won't you?
[1:42:01] Amen. Because we see this is the time
[1:42:03] that the Lord chose us to live in. Amen.
[1:42:05] There's no other time to where we were
[1:42:07] able to express these things that the
[1:42:09] Lord is showing us in the Bible. Amen.
[1:42:11] We can't we won't be able to express
[1:42:13] misper won't be able to express the the
[1:42:15] wine press express Amen the the the
[1:42:17] faithful man unless it was in this time.
[1:42:20] Amen. Because in those times where there
[1:42:22] were former times amen and they didn't
[1:42:24] have the full they couldn't look in the
[1:42:25] word like we can today. Amen. Because
[1:42:28] how the prophet has given us the keys to
[1:42:30] open the book and and we can't go into
[1:42:32] the word. We we couldn't have gone into
[1:42:34] the word back then like we can today.
[1:42:35] Amen. And see these things to encourage
[1:42:37] us in the Lord. Amen. Amen. And Amen.
[1:42:40] And um and amen. So I just wanted to uh
[1:42:44] share this with you guys. Amen. As the
[1:42:46] Lord put it on my heart as I was
[1:42:48] reading, you know, my scriptures and I
[1:42:49] was curious of what this mispa meant.
[1:42:51] Amen. How the Lord wants us to gather
[1:42:53] here. Amen. And as we gather here, Amen.
[1:42:55] This is where the Lord, you know, uh um
[1:42:58] start this is where our journey starts.
[1:43:00] Amen. And and after the journey starts,
[1:43:02] Amen. that's when the fight comes
[1:43:03] afterwards. Amen. Amen. And um and and
[1:43:06] Amen. If that's all the Lord wanted me
[1:43:08] to say. Amen. Um, I'm not gonna I'm not
[1:43:11] going to try. I'm not going to force it.
[1:43:12] Amen. Um, that's all the Lord wanted to
[1:43:15] wanted to
[1:43:19] hear. Amen. So, um, so, so,
[1:43:23] uh, yeah, I'm not I'm not, uh, I'm I'm
[1:43:26] not going to, uh, add man's words to
[1:43:28] this. Amen. That's all God wanted y'all
[1:43:30] to hear. So, uh, uh, Amen. So, um, as we
[1:43:33] can, we can pray. Amen. Amen. Uh, Father
[1:43:36] God, we come unto you humbly, Lord God,
[1:43:38] Jesus Christ. Father God, we thank you,
[1:43:39] Father God, for a simple message, Lord
[1:43:42] God, Jesus Christ. Father God, Lord God,
[1:43:44] Father God, we thank you, Father God,
[1:43:46] for your grace, your love, your mercy,
[1:43:47] Lord God. Father God, we know, Lord God,
[1:43:49] Father, that you teach us, Father God,
[1:43:51] to not, Father God, to lean on our own
[1:43:52] understanding, Lord God. For you said,
[1:43:54] cursed is he, Father God, who who trusts
[1:43:56] in man, Lord God, and not in you, Father
[1:43:58] God. So, Father God, in all things we
[1:44:00] look up to you, Father God, we said we
[1:44:01] know that your ways are not our ways,
[1:44:03] Father God, and and your thoughts are
[1:44:05] not our thoughts, Lord God, Jesus
[1:44:06] Christ, Father God. So, Father God,
[1:44:08] Jesus Christ, I thank you, Father God,
[1:44:09] for Lord God, the word you've given your
[1:44:11] children, Father God. Father God, you
[1:44:13] know who needed it, Father God, and what
[1:44:14] they needed to hear, Lord God, Jesus
[1:44:16] Christ. Father God, so Father God, we
[1:44:18] put you first, Father God, between in in
[1:44:20] all things, Lord God. And Father God, we
[1:44:22] pray, Father God, I pray blessings over
[1:44:24] over this congregation, Lord God, over
[1:44:26] Brother Steven and the church, Lord God.
[1:44:28] Father God, I pray, Father God, that you
[1:44:29] continue, Father God, to bless them,
[1:44:31] Father God, and to bring them higher,
[1:44:32] closer to you, Lord God. For that's the
[1:44:34] goal, Lord God, Jesus Christ, Father
[1:44:35] God. for your prophet said, Father God,
[1:44:37] that all the preachers job is to do,
[1:44:39] Father God, is to show, Father God, that
[1:44:41] the that the fruits are real, Father
[1:44:42] God, to show that the fruits are real,
[1:44:44] Father God, and to bring your people
[1:44:45] closer to God, Father God. And that's
[1:44:47] all I'm here to do, Lord God. And Father
[1:44:49] God, we love you, Father God. We put you
[1:44:50] first amongst all things, Lord God. And
[1:44:52] Father God, I pray blessings over them,
[1:44:54] Father God, on the highways and the
[1:44:55] byways, Lord God, and the rest of this
[1:44:57] week, Lord God. And Lord God, Jesus
[1:44:59] Christ's name we pray, Lord. Amen.
[1:45:03] [Applause]
[1:45:15] Praise God. Amen. Gather together way
[1:45:20] and mispay. Amen. Or mispa or mispay.
[1:45:24] When you gather together and mispay.
[1:45:26] Amen. Israel sinned before the Lord and
[1:45:31] the they were they went farther away and
[1:45:35] the prophet came and the prophet always
[1:45:38] bring you back to the word and the
[1:45:40] prophet told them let's go and gather
[1:45:42] together and mispay when they gathered
[1:45:44] together and mispay the first thing they
[1:45:46] did the bible says that they draw water
[1:45:49] and the pour water before the lord which
[1:45:52] was a type of a drink offering that they
[1:45:55] giving unto the Lord And the Bible say
[1:45:57] that they fasted and as soon as they
[1:46:00] begin to pour the drink offering and
[1:46:02] they fasted before the Lord, guess what?
[1:46:05] The enemy heard it and the enemy begin
[1:46:08] to rise up again. So when you see the
[1:46:10] enemy begin to rise up in your life,
[1:46:13] when you start making things right, just
[1:46:16] know that it's a good sign. Whatever you
[1:46:19] doing is going is moving to the right
[1:46:21] direction. If you need to do some
[1:46:23] repenting, go ahead and repent. If you
[1:46:26] need to correct something, go ahead and
[1:46:28] correct it. But just notice, just
[1:46:30] remember that the enemy will rise up
[1:46:32] again to challenge you. But he's coming
[1:46:34] at the wrong moment because your
[1:46:37] repentance is just bringing you back in
[1:46:39] line so that you can smite him. And the
[1:46:42] Bible says that while Samuel was
[1:46:44] actually sacrificing unto the Lord, they
[1:46:47] attack Israel when they were in church.
[1:46:52] It's written in your Bible.
[1:46:54] They attack Israel when Israel was in
[1:46:57] church. That's the reason why the Lord
[1:47:00] himself step on and thunder from heaven
[1:47:04] and disconed them. Amen. So if somebody
[1:47:08] is attacking you on the post off duty
[1:47:11] when you are living your Christian life
[1:47:13] and doing what the Lord asked you to do
[1:47:16] and praying at your home and the devil
[1:47:18] trying to attack you, the battle is not
[1:47:20] yours. The battle is the Lord. The Lord
[1:47:24] will
[1:47:35] disiscons the Bible say the that thunder
[1:47:39] discom so that Israel can destroy them.
[1:47:43] So the thunder weakened the enemy but it
[1:47:47] strengthened the brother. So this
[1:47:49] message to us is a strength but to the
[1:47:52] enemy it's something that will weaken
[1:47:55] the enemy. That's why you cling to the
[1:47:57] word and to the message and always keep
[1:48:00] repentance in your life to bring
[1:48:02] everything back in order so that the
[1:48:05] Lord who's watching everything in your
[1:48:07] life even when you are not aware that an
[1:48:10] enemy is around God will discomfort your
[1:48:13] enemy because the Lord is your ebenezer
[1:48:17] up to this time the Lord will help you.
[1:48:20] He's a present help in the time of
[1:48:22] trouble. Amen. Amen. So stay strong.
[1:48:26] Everything is good. Let's keep going
[1:48:29] back to the word and moving on. The Lord
[1:48:31] is on our side. Amen. Let's pray.
[1:48:34] Heavenly Father, Lord, we approaching
[1:48:37] you humbly tonight. Father, we thank you
[1:48:40] for your grace, for your love and your
[1:48:42] mercy and for everything you have been
[1:48:44] doing for us. Lord, thank you for
[1:48:46] speaking to our soul. And I don't know
[1:48:49] who need this misp tonight, Lord.
[1:48:52] Whether you might be here or Lord Father
[1:48:54] those that are online, they need to go
[1:48:56] back to the place where they can make
[1:48:58] things right. They can kindle again the
[1:49:01] fire of the Christian walk. Go back
[1:49:04] again to the daily sacrifice. Go back
[1:49:07] again to the fasting. Go back again to
[1:49:09] the praying. Go back again to the
[1:49:12] consecration. And I know the enemy will
[1:49:14] be upset. But this time, Lord Father,
[1:49:16] you have a purpose. And the purpose is
[1:49:19] not lord father to destroy Israel but to
[1:49:22] give him victory and to open up a way so
[1:49:25] that every city that has been taken by
[1:49:28] the devil by the Philistine everything
[1:49:30] that we have lost lord father throughout
[1:49:33] lord our journey now through lord father
[1:49:36] this experience at mispay we can lord
[1:49:39] father recuperate everything and take
[1:49:41] from the devil everything that he have
[1:49:43] taken from us lord father we commit
[1:49:46] everything unto thy hand protect us and
[1:49:48] remember your men's servant and give him
[1:49:50] strength Lord. Father Lord you help him
[1:49:52] with the test and the schooling Lord
[1:49:55] help him again Lord Father with his
[1:49:56] ministry Lord Father we are committing
[1:49:59] the church unto their hand and the rest
[1:50:01] of the week Lord Father may you bless us
[1:50:03] and take the oncoming married couple

[1:50:08] go into our respective place and keep us
[1:50:11] consecrated and closer to your word
[1:50:13] father in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:50:16] Amen. Go ahead, brother.
[1:50:21] Amen. We want to take this song. Blessed
