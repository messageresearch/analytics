amen we appreciate all the family members that are here I got my mother from Canada she's sitting back there I'm going to let her stand mom will you [Applause] stand thank you very much amen amen amen amen God richly bless you I believe we are all up to date with the sermon and I believe that we all reading our Bible two chapters a day one in the morning one before you go to bed can everybody say amen amen okay thank you some are reading the church edges somebody's reading the seals somebody's reading the 70 weeks of Daniel somebody adoption or somebody's listening to the message of the hour somehow amen amen amen at least you got to listen to the message of the hour you cannot go one week without the bread of Joseph amen the only way you can withstand famine you got to have the bread of Joseph amen amen glory to God God will show you what is the bread of Joseph shortly amen glory to God Lord's willing on uh December 16th we have the Young's men meeting and all the information will be sent in the group chat and uh December the 23rd this is when we have our question and answer and I said a message to the young uh adult uh group about the young Sisters Meeting I have not gotten any feedback yet so you tell me what we supposed to be doing so we talked about finances in a personal aspect and we have not gotten finances into the investment part yet but certain keys were given to the young sister to make sure they know how to handle their money and when they married they know how to budget their finances when they are home but before we move into the investment part I felt led to stop and to make sure I get some feedback on what we spoke and to know that the material was soaked in pretty good versus just getting it memorizing it and go and you don't use it then you're going to be find yourself into a trouble so you think over it you ponder it you send me question then the next time we sit down we talk a little bit more and we point certain areas that we didn't get pretty good then we can move on to the investment part because if you do not master the personal finances there is no way you're going to be successful in the business part like I said all over the country in the internet and if you look there is many books that are written about finances in this country and as as much as we have the knowledge of finances this country is broke a amen amen amen there is so many people in depth in this country versus the people that own everything why with all the knowledge that we have we still find ourselves in depth because there are certain keys and I proove you those keys by the scripture all of them by the scripture if you don't Master those keys No matter how much knowledge you're going to acquire for business or for finances you're going to find yourself in trouble because those key are the best Bic that you need to have in order to withstand what is coming out brother Bram say America is a bunch of slaves am if you need a can you say amen amen oh you right there so you say Amen louder Amen brother Bram say America is a BN of slave because the system the way the world was created from Eden When sin was introduced brother brandham Trac it all the way from Eden and then when he got to Babylon and we inherited the system of Babylon so we are trapped by birth and as you grow up and you go to school everything we learn in school we are learning it according to the system and once you are hooked pretty good in a system it's hard to break away from it and the only thing that can deliver you is the word of God Amen that's why we brought those principle from the word of God if you don't understand this principle you're going to get in trouble somehow amen amen but if you understand the principle they're very simple and you put them in in in place automatically you're going to build 12 without any strength so I don't want you to memorize it and go and tomorrow some of you are broke or I find you with a bad credit score or something that is not going on or with big depth so it means that you didn't soak the material pretty good so wherever you are look at what you are where you struggling come back send me directly the question so he stays between me and the worshipper directly or put it in the box but if you put it in the Box make sure you say this is for the young Sisters Meeting then we can sit down and make sure we know how to budget we know that when your husband have a paycheck and he goes into direct deposit you know how to properly divide the money can you say amen amen you know how to properly divide the money and know what to do and don't put the family into depth because we want to eat too much or we trying to get something that is beyond our mean all of this I gave you from the scriptures so give me some feedback and I know what it is but if you say we are okay you understood everything then I'm going to jump into a big animal that is called investment and that's a different thing for you to understand so make sure we soaking before we get there amen amen you see there are older people here they wish they were in that meeting before you they are right there they can say Amen they wish they were in that meeting before you they learn it first before you [Laughter] amen I'm learning things in this message and the Lord is opening things in this message that I wish myself if I was in your shoes and I soak everything that I'm getting I will be far away than what I am here so you are most gracious to receive these things before you get married before you get in trouble before you mess up your credit God is unfolding these things to make sure you're successful amen amen amen amen so make sure you don't hear it but you do it amen because whatever Joseph say we do [Applause] amen glory be to God we have a baby dedication this morning and uh it's uh M Anto Scott Johns mommy's here Daddy's out of town he was unable to make it my mom is right there it's a family that is a big uh uh friend to brother Preston and uh they wanted to dedicate the baby the little one is there with the sibling and Mommy's there Mrs U Mary Scott so let's sing bring them in you know what before you do it let me read the quote so we make sure we finded everything in the scripture Amen in the Book of Luke 18 verse uh 15 the Bible says and they brought unto him also what infants babies we clear that he will do what touch them and Jesus is not here today but brother Bram say he our hands are his hands amen amen amen he's using the bride's body he's using the church and Jesus said that he would touch them Luke say that he will touch them but when his disciples saw it they did what rebuked him but Jesus called them unto him and said suffer the children to come unto who and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God and brother Bram in the message talken he said you know when I see little fellows like this like that he always takes me back when I was a little boy and now the old saying is you know they on your feet now and your heart Le in other word when they grow up that's when they start giving you trouble but brother brandham say but that don't believe it'll be so when we dedicate them to the Lord so when we take our children and we give them to the Lord because they don't belong to us it's a gift that the Lord have given to us if we return back the gift to God automatically God is Duty man to protect those children even if they struggle through teenager because the doors has open up for the black dog and all kind of stuff the holy spirit will watch over them if we dedicate them to the Lord and brother I'm say we have a responsibility here and God placed this in your hand he made you a preach he made a preacher out of you I always say about women preacher you know but every mother is a what preacher not on the pulpit here is her congregation see to raise what these little fellows the little fellows right while daddy is what working so when Dad is working it's Mama's responsibility to take care of the home and you got a respons ability so now you can help me singing bring them in my friend as Sister Mary approaches with the baby if the little one one comes no problem brother Preston you make sure you get that little photo so we can send it to Dad since he was unable to make it go ahead [Music] yes bring the little ones to Jes Jus bring amen bring from the amen thank you [Music] for amen bring the to Jesus amen this time I beat my wife on this one I'm the one carrying the baby first amen yeah the light is too bright precious praise God what a gift let's go ahead and you pray for me and you pray with me together and let's join together as we dedicate miles Antoine Scott John let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we humbly approaching you this morning Lord

amen amen he sound asleep so I managed to be a good daddy again amen amen amen amen amen glory to God this is one praise report that was missed this is from sister adasa I want to thank God for giving me the job I ask him for he giveth good gift to his children so praise be to the name of the Lord amen God is faithful you're going to have Miracle after miracle and testimonies after testimony if you stick with the word and follow what the holy spirit is saying amen go ahead let stand and go straight to the reading of the word I had a quot and I refrained to send the quot and the quote was speaking this but I'm going to read it and I found out that I should have sent it amen glory to God if I can find it quick it's not on the board here but brother Bram says in the message convinced and concerned he say the holy spirit in you will not hunger for the world I'm going to send it to you later he shall hunger for God Amen if it's hard for you to go to church and press yourself to come when the church is open there is something wrong with that spirit I wanted to send this morning he say is uh it is trying to keep you away from God the spirit of God will run you right straight to the church every time the door opens for Fellowship yes sir see so you got to be sure of this now the time is a hand amen I'm going to send it to you later on we must be in the house of the Lord the best that we can with everything that is happening with amas over there and Israel I don't know what you're looking at I don't know if you usually I'm not in the news but this one I follow because Israel it's a clock and I have to make sure I'm looking at the second and the minute and everything the way it's going on everything that you see happening there clearly it's in the Scripture it is a fulfillment of the prophecy so you need to be careful who you condemning you need to be careful what you're saying if you don't understand the word stay quiet but the scripture say you pray for the Peace of Jerusalem amen amen if I pull it from the scripture you'll be amazed how everything is L everything that you see is coming from the Bible am it is clear and only a prophetic Insight can get it amen because the the the whole world must come against Jerusalem according to the test according to the to the word according to the Bible and according to the message of the hour the whole entire world have to go against Jerusalem that's when we coming back to AR I mean in Armageddon but for you to go against Jerusalem something must be stirred let me leave it alone we'll catch up maybe one of these day I just want to shake you and tell you make sure you check your calling and election and make sure your faith is not a religious faith of coming to church and go home and leave any kind of way make sure you are ready for the going am you are ready for the coming of the Lord amen let's go to our scripture Genesis 41 again I'm going to try again if I can cross the scripture and then get to the material okay we will try okay if we can't finish it then we wait until we cross the material so I can't move on until we cross the scripture and we go so in other word you need your Bible amen yeah never come to church without your Bible the message of the hour is a bible message if somebody tells you that the message take people away from the Bible they don't know what they're talking about or whoever preached to them the message preaches wrong because the message and the Bible are one amen amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord Lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning Father we thank you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is as far as I can go with the ability you have given me but when it comes to the word and to interpret the word it is only something that the Holy Spirit himself Can Do Lord father may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to us and bless us Lord father let nothing of this weather affect the people people Lord may they forget about what is going on outside but if you can give us rain outside may you give us also rain on the inside Lord so that we can be blessed this morning and go home like the disciple on the road of EMAs saying Lord did not our heart burn within us as you spoke to us be the beginning and the ending of this service we move every demonic spirit away from us may you speak to our soul lord father may you help those that are backsliding in the name of Jesus Jesus Christ amen am let's go to Genesis 41 verse 28 if you dare you can say amen amen and the Bible says that this is the thing which I have spoken uh which I have spoken to Pharaoh what God is about to do he show to who Pharaoh we know that God was about to bring plenty and was about also to bring something that was bad which which is famine so both the plenty and the famine are coming from the Lord now you understand why famine should come amen verse 29 behold there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt and there shall arise after them seven years of water you might be seated and all the Plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt in other word the famine will devour everything amen when when we talked about famine what is really coming behind famine is death that's right amen amen amen hold your finger where you are go to Revelation 6 please so we see where we are you can go to Revelation 6 amen verse eight you know this clearly we went through the seals and I'm going to go back to Genesis you there yes and I look and behold a what a Pale Horse and his name that sat on him was water so the P horse his name is clear identified by the eag which is the fourth Beast the P horse you know this Clearly Now is death it's identified by the eagle it is the eagle anointing that is identifying death amen want to show you something and Hell follow with him and power was given to them death and Hell amen over the fourth part of the earth to do what to kill with what sword the sword and with what we clear so when hunger is coming it's a pale hor in disg are we together have i l somebody so famine famine which will bring hunger amen it's a riding of a p horse amen and if the P horse is coming the only way you can withstand the P horse you need an e we okay now by ego you need a prophet amen let's go back now to Genesis so when I give you this inside you know how we traveling Genesis 41 amen verse 30 and there shall arise after them seven years of famine and all the Plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt and the famine shall consume the land we clear and the Plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that fine following you understand what it means now for it shall be very Grievous and for that the dream was double to Pharaoh twice you understand the seven Church ages and the seal it is because the thing is established by who by God and God will shortly bring it to what yes we clear so the one who's opening the door for fine to strike is God but before that God send the plenty but the Plenty in the years of plenty there is a Ministry by the ministry of Joseph which we clearly identify last Sunday that Joseph was William Marian we clear on that one amen that's the one that has a Ministry to gather the food that escape amen I use the word lost last Sunday to match what brother Bram is saying even it's lost the way I mean uh the the terminology brother brandham says it's not really lost you cannot lose the word of God but it's a food that actually escaped the people or was not given to the people it was taken out from the people and it was stored for the time of famine so throughout the years of plenty you can never reach that food or you can never eat or be exposed to that food the food will always come when famine struck the land amen so the fif is what you need to withstand the famine so this famine that is coming with a pel horse bringing death can only be conquered by the fif amen which is the ministry of Joseph everybody okay if you're not in that Ministry if you don't have it you're going to die because it's going to conquer every single nation and he will kill and if you notice this famine was not in one place it was all over the world so there will be a famine that will come all over the world I will get you those scripture down the road if I can reach that level the fine will come all over the world and it will affect every single country and you got to find where is the wheat without the wi you going to find yourself in trouble amen we clear now amen are we claming okay amen so it's a it's a worldwide famine amen famine everywhere every country amen is affected every country is affected by the famine if you don't find food you're going to die because the fine is intended to destroy everything and the only resources you need is the fifth part that was taken or collected by Joseph so if you ask Joseph to give you food he will never give you the 80% he will give you the one that he have the fifth part but that fifth part represent every single year amen everybody okay amen and it is the fifth part the missing part that the devil will always attack you because they are the one you are already familiar to amen are we together if let me go this way so we can clim slowly if he takes 10 keys for you if the devil attack people in 10 different ways and you only know eight you are still vulnerable to the devil that's right make sense that's right if the devil come like one you will face him and bat him if he comes like two or three you will face him and bat him but if the devil ever attack you with nine and 10 you will find out that it's a different combat it's a different battle it's a different weapon that you are never been exposed to it and the devil will get you there so the only way for you to get the devil completely you need to have the missing part make sure but if you already been exposed to from 1 to 8 amen do you need it over again because you're already familiar to it so when the devil come it's already we already know about this thing but you need to focus more on the missing part because that's what the devil use every sing single time and knock everybody else that was before us everybody clear we clear so far as far as Paul I mean elaborate and and and and open the word plainly and clearly the devil came in as a nicolan spirit and inflict something when Paul was even there Paul even said the Antichrist is moving he's already there there is only one thing that can with stand it takes the ministry of Joseph are we clear amen we okay now now jum to verse 45 if you dare you can say amen and Pharaoh called Joseph what he called Joseph names what zna P zna pan my daughter even asked me this he said Daddy what do means and I gave her the answer I say okay I'm going to use her and quote her that that's where he comes from the word zaf panea means the man to whom hidden things are [Music] revealed any question I have three definition that I found out the word zap first definition means the man to whom hidden things are revealed the second definition is the man who reveal Mysteries amen so Joseph is Za he's the man that reveal Mysteries and the third definition is a founder of mysteries everybody okay so Joseph that's why we call Joseph William Marian Bram because the ministry of brother Bram is a Ministry to reveal the mysteries of God Amen which are the Revelation that were in the seven seal that's why this message is the mystery amen everybody okay amen are we clear so far everybody okay so far if you have a trouble with this message it's clear now amen verse 45 and Pharaoh called Joseph named what ZF p and he gave him as a wife Alena the daughter of pipera priest of and Joseph went went out over all the land of what Egypt and Joseph was 30 years old when he stood before Pharaoh when did Jesus started his ministry so this is the ministry of Christ himself are we together I already pray so don't wait for me to pray I already pray I'm just claming every everybody Okay we okay is it clear he say he was 30 years when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt and Joseph went out from the presence of who Pharaoh they don't say he went out from Pharaoh from the presence of pharaoh because Pharaoh Pharaoh is the type of God and God and Joseph must meet together am amen so before Joseph started ministry he already met with God Amen and then when he left Pharaoh he left the presence of God in order to execute his commission amen everybody okay the presence of God are recognized Amen in his presence are we together have I lost somebody sir okay praise God you need to put your head in the message amen and then he says that he went throughout all the land of what Egypt and in the seven plenus years the earth brought forth what by hand because remember the ministry of Joseph for the first time the entire land of Egypt begin to cry unto Pharaoh amen all Egypt was crying unto Pharaoh in other words the bread of Joseph took all Egypt and put him back to relationship with pharaoh and I quoted something and I'm going to give it to you so you make sure you get it Amen brother Bram says this in the exposition of the seven Church ages brother Bram say not for what one moment do I bring a what a message to the people that they may what follow me if you notice the entire Ministry of Joseph he never brought anybody toward him that's right everything Joseph was doing was giving toward pharoh amen everybody okay he says all to join what my church or to start some fellowship and what organization I have never done that and I would not do that now I have no interest in what those things but I do have an interest in the things of who God and what people and if I can accomplish how many things just one thing I will be how satisfied and that one thing is to see establish a what a true spiritual relationship between who God and what man man plural between pharaoh and his people amen wherein man become a new what Creations in Christ with his spirit and live according to what his word that was the purpose of William Marion BR he was not to bring us to go to Jeffersonville amen it was not to bring us to form a denomination amen it was not to bring us to bring I mean to bring us to go back to him because brother Bram is already dead am but it's to establish a relationship between the bride and Jesus Christ between the Son of God and God himself everybody clear am now watch clearly where are we at my friend um 4 verse 47 and in the seven he pled years the earth brought forth what by handfuls and he gather up up the food for the seven years which were in the land of what Egypt and laid up the food in the what cities let's stop right there the food were laid in the cities amen amen do you know what a city means right you don't know what it means I will tell you later on Amen what was smina City what was Ephesus a city what was pergamus a city what was tartarian a city what was Philadelphia a city what was lodia a city so what is a city a church church age are we together amen so the food are stor where in the church ages am keep this in mind okay amen okay have I lost someone no sir is it too hard okay let's go to verse 48 and he gather up the food of the seven year which were in the land of water Egypt and laid up the food in the water cities the food of the what field the food of the field was taken and locked in the city amen which was run about every water City laid he up in the water so every food that was in the city in the field was collected and brought into the City and locked up in the city are we clear you will see what it means give me one minute and then we can take where we are if we approach this as a Sunday school that's okay amen let's go to verse 49 now if you dare you can say amen amen and Joseph G I want you to be very careful now and Joseph gathered corn as the sand of what the sea very what much until he left what numbering for he was what without number if you notice the corn of Joseph right here is compared to something amen let's go slowly everybody okay the corn of Joseph that he was laying the one fif that Joseph was laying or the or the food that have to be distributed in the time of famine that food amen when he was collected for the years of famine he looked like the sand of the sea amen this food look like the sand of what the SE and it looks like the sand of the sea come and it was without numbers amen amen until they stop what they stop numbering or counting them in other word if you go there and you try to f out the number you will never come up with a number amen we clear the food look like the sand of the sea so the entire food that Joseph was supposed to deliver to the entire world Amen when he was put together are you following me he looked like the sand of the sea and he was without number what does he mean we clear let's clam a little bit in the Book of Genesis 15 verse 2 and 5 God was talking to Abraham he have not clicked yet it's coming and God begin to talk to Abraham and Abraham expressed his concern to God and in verse two the Bible say and Abraham said Lord God what will that give me seeing I go how childless and the steward of my house is this elzar of Damascus in other word I don't have a child I don't have a descendant and if I die everything will be given to to elezar of Damascus but elezar is not a true blood from me he's a man from Damascus amen and Abraham said behold to me thou thou has given what no seed Abraham was concerned about the seed and L one born in my house is my water air and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be what thine air in other words elar is not the hair amen but he that shall come forth out of thy own what bows shall be what thine air and he brought him forth where abroad in other word Abraham come outside and say look now toward what heaven and tell what the Stars if thou be able to do what number them and he said unto him so shall what thy seed be so the seed of Abra is a seed that is without number amen are we cling together amen the Seed of Abraham amen the Seed of Abraham was compared to the stars of Heaven amen and when he was compared to the stars of Heaven he was a seed without number Amen in other word Abraham cannot put a numbering to the Seed of Abraham if you look at that that word seed is it plural or singular singular the seed is in singular it's not plural are we clear now when we go to the book of uh in the New Testament Paul is saying this in the book of Hebrew Paul says this that therefore sprung there even of one and him as good as what dead so many as the what stars of the sky in what multitude and as the what sand which is by the what Seashore are what innumerable so the Seed of Abraham doesn't look only like the star the Seed of Abraham also look like the sand of the sea amen are we together the Seed of Abraham is also represented as the sand of the sea amen amen if you say the star of Heaven it's the Seed of Abraham if you say the sand of the sea it's it's also the Seed of Abraham and that seed is in singular it is s e e d singular not in plural amen and the Bible say when Joseph collected the food the food that Joseph collected looked like what the sand of the seed and the Seed of Abraham look like what the sand of the sea so what does he mean the sand of the sea amen are we together are we together have I lost anyone the Bible says in G 3: 16 and now to who Abraham and to who his Seed where the promise made and he said not and to what seed in other words it was not seeds plural it is seeds singular and Paul is saying that and he didn't say that he was seeds as of what many but as of what one and to that seed which is who Christ amen everybody okay amen so the Seed of Abraham is who Christ Hallelujah and chist look like what the sand of the sea and Joseph collected the multitude of bread like what the sand of the sea so the sand of the sea which is how without number so the food of Joseph represented who Christ any question so far amen everybody okay so what Joseph put off there was Christ amen everybody okay the food that were Ed throughout the ages were Crist amen but it's not Crist in one form it is Crist in a mixture of seven form everybody okay the lose end that word throughout the seven denomination when you put them together it is Christ we have what Ephesus meant amen what what what's mean lost or what's mean a miss that one we have amen we have we have what Luther did in heav amen we have what Wesley did in heav amen and what we have is called Christ amen but not Christ in one form but Christ in many form amen so Joseph collected Christ amen in other word the ministry of Joseph is the ministry of Christ amen everybody together amen everybody together listen to brother BR and my friend in the message the toen brother Bram say we are not come together to do what talk about the message but we come together to do what get in the message the message is who Christ are we together he is the what the word that is right we are to get into it how get beneath it yes sir that is what we are supposed to what do so Christ is the message of the hour and the message of the hour is a message that was collect Ed of the other seven years amen are we together in other words to withstand the Famine of this time you must have Christ amen not the crust of Paul not the crust of arenus not the crust of Columba because the crust of Paul is only represented in one form the crust of Luther is only justification the crust of Wesley is only sanctification the crust of the Pentecostal is only the restoration of the gift but you need the cross that is a collection amen of any other cross and put it together amen are we together are we together let me drop this so it makes sense let's go to the book of Isaiah amen amen let's go to the book of Isaiah let's go to Isaiah 30 so I let this one soak in I didn't prepare this but let's go ahead and get it Isaiah 30: 26 if you thereare you can say amen amen you know this right you know this right amen notice this the Bible says verse 26 moreover the light of the water the moon shall be as the light of what the sun in other word the moon and the light and and the sun will have the same light Amen in other words when you begin to look at the Moon the Moon will look like the sun amen until you cannot tell which one is the sun which one is the moon everybody okay if you look at the Moon it look like the sun if you look at the sun it look like the sun the Sun and the Moon became one Amen in other word the sun now has fused with the moon and both of them are one the husband and the wife become one amen whatever speak of the groom is speaking about the wife amen are we together and Isaiah say moreover the light of the moon shall be what as the light of the Sun as the light of the sun and the light of the Sun that sun that the Moon is reflecting amen amen am the moon will pick up the light of the Sun but before he pick up that sun we need to know what was the light of that sun before that light be reflected in the moon we need to know whether that light was one or two or three or four we need to know the magnitude of the sun are we together follow me carefully he says and the light of the sun shall be how Sevenfold So it's a light of a son seven time it's a message seven years H is that okay now it is not a message of one day it will be Sevenfold as the light of what seven days so it's not the light of one day it is the light of seven different day that have been collected together and put into one day so when you look at that Moon it's the light of seven days it is the food of s years it is the corn of seven years it is the crust of seven years it is the light of seven years are we together he says and the light of seven days in the day that the Lord will do what bindeth up the breach of what his people and heal what the stroke of their wounds so for you to be bind up completely for the bridge between the seven Church ages and the seal to be preached you need the light amen a light that the light of Sevenfold that's the light that can breach the seven churches ches in the amen are we together are we together that's why the message is chist amen the message is the collection of the food thou Escape through the seven Church ages are we together are we together listen to this my friend in the message what is the attraction and on the mountain brother brandom say I got what my mind in this what message this message what is the message that's that third pull so the message is what the third pool so the third pool is what the message is that complicated no sir the third pool is what the message and the message is what the third pool and the message is Christ amen so the third pool is who Christ any complication no sir what is the third pole in the message the anointing wanted to Ender brother Bram say you know this I'm just touching up he says noce the very day when this messageer what not when he starts on but when he begin to do what declare his message he's declaring what this his message he's declaring what his his message and the message is the third pool amen amen the first pull is what healing the second pool is what prophesying and the third pull is what the opening of the word the what Mysteries reveal the ministry of Z amen the revealer of the Mysteries the founder of the Mysteries that is the message of William May Bram in other word this message is the revelation of the mysteries of God Amen never pay with a mystery it is the mystery that will fight the famine amen the famine will not be fought by Divine Healing no sir he won't be fought by prophecy he won't be fought by dis you need the unfolding of the Mysteries amen do you need Mysteries yes sir [Music] amen no more there is no more what higher order to do what reveal the word but what then prophets but the only way the prophet can be is what Vindicated is by the word and remember the third pool is what the opening of them Seven Seals the opening of what them Seven Seals message which is the third pool the message is the opening of what the seven seal so the opening of The Seven seal is the message amen when you say the seals are not open you are rejecting the message am you are rejecting the of Joseph amen when you say we don't need the seals you are rejecting the corn amen the bread of Joseph when you say we don't need these Mysteries to go to heaven you don't know what you're talking about you need this Mysteries to go to heaven and it's all off of the message do we need to know the seals to go to heaven of course the first pool was not his message it was the years of preparation it was the preparation of Joseph in order to store the food but the food the storage must be broken amen the storehouse of Joseph must be broken to bring the food for the people do you need the seals yes because the seals are the third pole and the seals are the opening of the word and the seals are the message and the message is [Applause] Christ can you say amen amen let people online hear you say Amen this is what we believe in this church amen in this church you touch the pool you touch the seals you're not going to stand in this [Applause] pit are we together let me make you swallow this my friend you ready he is the what the one who did what open those seal he is what those seals so the seals are who Christ So when you say we don't need the seal you don't need who [Applause] Christ amen the seals are who Christ when you say we don't need the seals you don't need who Christ who are you rejecting Christ when you beling the se you are beling who Christ do you see the danger that people in the message are playing around you don't need them serious you don't need them in other word you're telling the people you don't need Christ everybody okay amen he is what those seals so the whole word of God is who Christ and Christ is what the seals that was open can you read it over again Christ is what the seals that was open and Christ is the seals that were what open so when you rejecting the seal you rejecting Christ Amen in other way you rejecting the very message that you claim to believe never play with the [Music] SE never play with this message you are playing with the very corn the very sand of the Sea The Very Seed of Abraham amen because the Seed of Abraham is Crist and he looks like what sand of the sea the sand of the sea right there God so the corn of Joseph represented who Christ if the corn of Joseph represented Christ so when Joseph begin to send out his cor it is who is looking for who it is Christ looking for who that's why his corn could not stay only in Egypt amen his cor have to go all of the world because the cor represent Christ and Christ has his children all over the [Applause] world everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay that's why brother Bram say it is like the history of an eagle in the pig pen because the mama Eagle have to fly amen this message must take flight amen amen everybody okay and when he flies all over the planet it is looking for things that look like Christ amen it is Christ searching for his children that's why brother say when you when you recognize this message to be eager food then you heard from your own you heard from your own representation amen thank you Jesus Christ is what the seals the seals that was what open what is the opening of the water seals revealing to who Christ so what is the opening of the storehouses of Joseph revealing Christ it is bringing the food crossed out so that the people can withstand the femine and that femine is the death angel it is the P horse so to combat the P horse you need an eagle anointing amen and the eagle anointing must be the seals to withstand the devil in this end time [Music] [Applause] Amen in this church this is where we stand the seals are the m and the seals are the tempol and the seals are Crist and the seals that's the bread of Joseph never let anybody sit around that say do you need to know all of these seals do you know what the seals mean who can interpret the Bible without the opening of the [Music] seals let me say even this he might shock you if brother Bram never reached the opening of the seals he was also vulnerable to the devil because brother Bram had the first food they impersonate him the second P they imperson him but when he Reach the the third pool that's why the devil could not touch it is a higher level amen the devil cannot reach that level amen and if you want the devil to get away from you take him inside the third pool Amen in the first pool the devil got oxygen the second pool he got oxygen but when you take him deep in the third pool he can no longer brief his oxygen is completely dep keep him in the third [Applause] [Music] po everybody good have I lost someone have I lost somebody oh sir let's go to Genesis 41 my friend hallelujah hallelujah [Music] I can move forward but I can't I'm following the boss Hallelujah he's the one preaching to this church he's the one telling me what to preach everybody okay never play with the seals the seals are not a book the book is only a little material that was put together because by the BR I'm saying one seal he can preach for three month did he preach one seal in three month so the seal is not really the book The Seal is Christ it is a person before brother Bram preached the seals Christ himself came to him and told him what the seal is so what Christ was telling him was himself so the seal is a person that's why this Bible is unlimited now we keep seeing new things every day because of the breaking of the seal you cannot find a number to put a stop here because Christ doesn't have a limitation he is eternity he is meis EDC no beginning of there no ending of Life he's unlimited he is Christ it is the G that is without number and if you are a Seed of Abraham you must your portion in this message there must be a part of this message when you open up to you you say that is me amen you say now I see now I understand the message now I got the point now I CAU the [Music] vision we there we are there we finished the first reading let's go

Pharaoh servant When You Reach this point of being servant then Pharaoh take you in charge and everything is given back to you any question so far let's go to the last reading Ruth chapter one if you thereare you can say Amen Ruth chapter one oh Lord few minute let's R if we can get this now amen if you there you can say amen amen Ruth chapter 1 remember the story of Ruth amen Naomi left the land of Egypt of Judah and went down to the land of Moab amen and after a while Naomi left the land of Moab and returned back to Judah we need to know what caused the moving back and forth what what what what started the moving toward uh uh Moab and what triggered the moving from Moab to what started North and South everybody okay are we clear we back in roof right let's go verse one now it came to pass in the days when the H judges r that there was a what a famine in so what start the trouble famine what start the history of redemption amen and fine in the land and a certain man of what Bethlehem Judah why only someone from Judah have to move not any other tribe only the tribe of Judah can move sir and not any family only the family of the royal lineage where Jesus will come yes so fine feine when he reach Israel amen he moved from the whole country of Israel everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay amen Israel is a clock everybody okay you know that a clock have hours right and after hours we have what minutes and after minute we have what seconds we clear so we need to move from a clock to hour to minute until we reach second amen when famine reach amen it struck Israel but it's not just Israel but when he struck not everybody move only a certain tribe was selected everybody okay but not everybody not everybody Israel not everybody from the tribe moved amen but when you reach down into that tribe it's a family so now we are precise we know the minute we know the second we know even the hour it is the tribe of Judah that moved it is the family of ALC and that family came from the lineage of the Messiah everybody okay what why only Judah have to move why only the royal family have to move because Judah is the only one that can marry a gentile and don't say anything can you say Amen can you say Amen when Jacob has his children of children it was Judah that went and marry outside and nothing happened if you marry from another tribe you bring them in they sack them up and they cast them away they're not going to accept them into the Commonwealth because Judah got decept decept break the law do you remember the Book of Esther the Lord said nobody can enter but when Esther enter what happened the king took the septer and did in other word when I I killed the law only Judah can make someone enter everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay and the country they were going towards the country of Moab which we already seen that Moab the Bible the law say no moabite can enter into the congregation of what so you need a king to break the law you need a king to to veto you need a king that have the VOR right that can say no I take this person and pull him in and what move that family is famine hunger started Redemption we together hold on I'm going to finish my friend because I have not start the sermon yet if I start the sermon so it's a problem let's go verse one and now now it came to pass in the days when the churches rule that there was a what famine in the Land There was a famine in the land and a certain men of what Bethlehem Judah not just Bethlehem Bethlehem look where it's coming from where the Messiah have to be Bethlehem Ludo you Bethlehem Ludo city of Judah out of you will come that's where somebody's moving from there amen from Bethlehem Judah went to seon in the country of what Mo and he and his wife and his wife two sons stop there jop to verse six that was the exod the starting of the journey started with a fine what is going to bring that family back to Israel verse six you there amen if you there you can say amen amen then she Naomi after husband die Sons die Naomi stayed there and would not move amen amen she was stripped completely husband di two sons died but she was still lingering she's not going look what trigger Naomi you there amen you there amen then she arose with her daughter everybody okay inlaw that she might do what return from the country of Moab for she have what heard in the country of Moab slowly that God how the Lord that the Lord has what visited his people in giving what them bread so what brought Naomi back to [Applause] Israel hallelujah what took her from Israel over there and what is taking her back over there when she heard that there is a bread in Judah the bread is what took Naomi and Ruth back to the promised land it is a bread that bring you back to your original position amen because when we come in this word we were born in sin shaping in iniquity coming to this word speaking lies and we lost our identity we didn't know who we are we thought we were the children of the parent that birth us but later on we begin to realize by the cone of Joseph by the bread of Joseph by the message of the hour by Christ by the third po by the opening of the seals that we are no longer Charles of a and Charles BR that we come from somewhere else we belong to another country and we need to go back to our position as Sons and Daughters of God so he take the
