[0:00] We'll separate ourselves from all this
[0:02] man-made dogmas and creeds and things
[0:05] and look in the Bible, see what God said
[0:07] about it. He ought to know what he's
[0:08] right. It's his word, his book. It's the
[0:10] reason I like the full gospel. Not half
[0:12] of it, all of it.
[0:14] &gt;&gt; The full gospel.
[0:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:16] &gt;&gt; Now, and then then he said the first
[0:19] thing you know, here come Andrew running
[0:21] in and saying that this preacher said he
[0:23] saw the Messiah sign over a man. It was
[0:26] a a light like a dove coming down. And
[0:29] the preacher saw it. There's many there.
[0:31] Nobody else saw it but the preacher. So
[0:33] I couldn't hardly go for that. I had
[0:35] heard all kinds of stuff. So I just
[0:36] forgot about it, you know. And one night
[0:39] he come to me and said, "You ought to
[0:40] just go down and listen at him for once.
[0:42] He's going to be down here on the shore
[0:43] the next morning and you ought to go
[0:45] down." Well, I thought poor old Andrew.
[0:48] He and I pulled this boat for a long
[0:49] time. And I remember one day I had a
[0:51] talk with my daddy and he was a good old
[0:54] Pharisee. He just lived in that church,
[0:56] a pillar in it. and his gray hair one
[0:59] night act fishing. We were poor. We had
[1:02] to just live meager as we could. And
[1:04] many times when mother and daddy was
[1:06] living, she used to gather us all around
[1:08] in the morning before we went out to put
[1:09] our nets in the water. We owed debts and
[1:12] we had to have some fish and we would
[1:14] pray to Jehovah to to fill our nets that
[1:17] day. and how daddy would rejoice when we
[1:20] taken a great big catch of fish and get
[1:22] to the bank and get out on the bank and
[1:24] sit down and thank God for giving us the
[1:26] fish for that day. Now we could go pay
[1:29] our debts now and have something to eat
[1:31] for the night and expect the next
[1:32] morning. And one night after we got
[1:34] through thanking the Lord, I remember
[1:36] daddy sat down on the side of the
[1:39] braille of the boat. And he called me
[1:41] over there and he said, "Simon,
[1:44] you know, I have longed all my life to
[1:48] live to see the day when I would see the
[1:51] Messiah." And we've been promised him
[1:53] for many years. All of our people has
[1:56] looked for him. Moses told us he was
[1:58] coming. All the prophets have spoke to
[2:00] him. But Simon's son, we haven't had a
[2:02] prophet among us for hundreds of years.
[2:06] And the church has got off in cold
[2:08] formal condition. But I believe it's
[2:10] nearing the time. If you see my gray
[2:13] hair, I don't suppose I'll live to see
[2:15] it. I'm old now. But Simon, before the
[2:17] Messiah comes, Satan will send out a lot
[2:20] of false stuff first. And there'll be
[2:23] false messiahs come. But I want you to
[2:26] always remember, Simon, don't you never
[2:28] leave this scripture. Our people are
[2:31] told in this Bible that the word of the
[2:34] Lord comes to a prophet.
[2:37] &gt;&gt; A prophet only
[2:39] &gt;&gt; and then first this prophet has to be
[2:43] vindicated by God.
[2:45] &gt;&gt; He has to tell the word and the word has
[2:48] to come to pass time after time. They
[2:51] are born. They're just not just somebody
[2:54] laid hands on them and made them a
[2:55] prophet. They are born. There's a gift
[2:57] of prophecy can come, but a prophet is
[2:59] born a prophet.
[3:01] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah was God said, "Before you is
[3:03] even formed in your mother's wombs, I'll
[3:05] ard you a prophet over the nations."
[3:08] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist 712 years before he's
[3:10] born. Isaiah said he's a voice of one
[3:12] crying in the wilderness.
[3:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ was the son of God before
[3:16] the foundation of the world.
[3:18] &gt;&gt; He was a woman seed that was to bruise
[3:20] the serpent's head. Certainly, God is
[3:23] God places these things. God has set in
[3:26] the church. Apostles, prophets,
[3:28] teachers, pastors, evangelists, all
[3:31] these things God placed in the church.
[3:33] Then there's nine different gifts who
[3:34] operates in that church. But these are
[3:37] offices that goes in the church. And you
[3:39] know, he told me, he said, "Son, we
[3:42] followed Moses and his law. Now Moses
[3:45] told us that this Messiah when he come
[3:47] would be a prophet. So I just thought I
[3:50] would go down and see who this young
[3:53] fellow was stirring up all this emotion
[3:55] down there and said people's being
[3:57] healed by him. So I thought I'd go down
[4:00] and one day when we got the nets all
[4:03] washed and laid out on the bank, he came
[4:05] down to preach and I got me a chunk and
[4:07] sat down up on a piece of driftwood up
[4:09] on the bank. And when he began to speak,
[4:13] uh, I knew that there was something
[4:15] different about this man because he
[4:17] talked like a man that knowed what he
[4:19] was talking about. And when I got up
[4:21] close to him, he looked me right in the
[4:23] face and he said, "Your name is Simon
[4:26] and you are the son of Jonas." He said,
[4:28] "That take it as enough for me."
[4:31] &gt;&gt; Not only did he prove to be the prophet,
[4:34] he knew me before he ever saw me. He
[4:38] knew me and he also knew that godly old
[4:40] father of mine that told me that would
[4:42] be the sign of the Messiah.
[4:45] &gt;&gt; That settled it for me. Oh my. How he
[4:48] was getting all excited too and must
[4:49] have been Philip jumped up said let me
[4:55] [Music]

[1:03:01] we love you, Lord God. We thank you,
[1:03:02] Father, for your grace, your love, your
[1:03:03] mercy, Lord. Lord, I've done all that I
[1:03:06] can as a man, Lord God. And now I pray,
[1:03:07] Father, that you come down, Lord God,

[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, um, tonight my subject would
[1:03:27] be, uh, the bride makes herself ready by
[1:03:29] the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Now, um, and I don't and with with what
[1:03:34] the Lord gave me, I'm not even sure if
[1:03:36] that's a a fair enough title. You know,
[1:03:38] the Lord gave me so much. I went through
[1:03:40] like four titles, but the Lord gave me
[1:03:43] one.
[1:03:46] So, um, um, so for another, um, another
[1:03:50] our other opening scripture, we're going
[1:03:52] to go to Ezekiel 1.
[1:03:54] I'm going to start with verses 4-5.
[1:03:56] We're going to be in we're going to be
[1:03:58] in Ezekiel for the most part. We're
[1:04:00] going to jump to Revelations 4. Um later
[1:04:02] on
[1:04:04] when you get to Ezekiel 1, say amen.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So verse four, it reads,
[1:04:16] "And I looked, and behold, a whirlwind
[1:04:19] came out of the north. a great cloud and
[1:04:22] a fire unfolding itself and a brightness
[1:04:25] was about it
[1:04:27] and out of the midst thereof as a color
[1:04:29] of amber and out of the mist of out of
[1:04:33] the midst of the fire. Amen. Now, I want
[1:04:35] to take some time and uh just stop right
[1:04:37] there at that scripture right there
[1:04:38] because we know exactly what that's
[1:04:40] talking about. Amen. And you know, I was
[1:04:43] meditating on it and the Lord just
[1:04:45] spoke, you know, spoke to me on that
[1:04:47] scripture. You know, when when you look
[1:04:49] at it, you have your cloud, got the
[1:04:52] fire, you got your whirlwind all in that
[1:04:55] scripture. Amen. And we know each one of
[1:04:57] those individual physical manifestations
[1:05:01] is Christ. Amen.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; And we know Christ is made perfect in
[1:05:04] three. Amen.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; And when we look at it, we know the
[1:05:07] fire. Amen. We know the cloud. But what
[1:05:10] I want to focus on is that whirlwind.
[1:05:12] Amen. See, because when we when we speak
[1:05:16] on that whirlwind, that's when God makes
[1:05:18] himself manifest on earth. Amen. Because
[1:05:21] when I was looking at it, you have the
[1:05:24] cloud, God above us. You have the fire,
[1:05:27] God with us in the in his children, the
[1:05:29] pillar of fire. Amen. Then you have the
[1:05:31] cloud, the whirlwind. Amen. So that
[1:05:33] whirlwind has to be God when he manifest
[1:05:35] himself on earth. Amen. So I I looked at
[1:05:37] it and I wanted to see what brother
[1:05:39] Brennham said about it. Amen. And in the
[1:05:41] unveiling of God in um 1964,
[1:05:45] brother Brenham says Moses one time
[1:05:47] desired to see God and God told him to
[1:05:50] stand on the rock. Amen. So him to stand
[1:05:52] on the revelation. Amen. It says on the
[1:05:54] rock Moses stood and he seen God pass
[1:05:57] by. Amen. It says and his back looked
[1:06:00] like the back of a man. Amen. He says
[1:06:02] God was in a whirlwind. Amen. See, and
[1:06:05] then he says again in the mighty God
[1:06:07] available before us. Amen. See this is
[1:06:08] the unveiling of God. He unveils himself
[1:06:10] in that in that whirlwind. Amen. And he
[1:06:13] says it says um brother Benham says in
[1:06:16] Job God was so real to him. He wanted to
[1:06:19] find out if he couldn't go back and
[1:06:20] knock at his door and have interview
[1:06:22] with him.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; See, but we find out that God did speak
[1:06:25] to him. But he was veiled. He was veiled
[1:06:28] in the form of a whirlwind. Amen. See,
[1:06:30] and he told Job to gird up his loins and
[1:06:32] to speak to him like a man. And he came
[1:06:35] down in a whirlwind and spoke to Job.
[1:06:37] And he was made known made known to Job
[1:06:40] through the whirlwind. Amen. Yet he did
[1:06:42] not he did not exactly see him. He could
[1:06:45] just hear the wind blowing and turning
[1:06:47] around the trees and the voice came out
[1:06:49] of the whirlwind. But God was veiled in
[1:06:52] the whirlwind. Amen. So we see we look
[1:06:54] at the scripture. So this is just all
[1:06:56] God right here. This all the scripture
[1:06:57] is saying. So So what did God So for God
[1:07:01] to come and manifest himself in this
[1:07:03] much. Amen. to show you this is me in
[1:07:06] all all facets. This is me. Amen. See,
[1:07:09] so what was so important for him to do
[1:07:11] that? See, why did he have to do all
[1:07:13] that? Amen. So, so then um so so then I
[1:07:17] also wanted to mention, you know,
[1:07:18] brother Benham, he talks about if you
[1:07:20] sow the wind, you reap the whirlwind.
[1:07:22] Amen. He said that many times. He said
[1:07:23] he always wanted to preach on it, but
[1:07:25] never but he never got to it. Amen. See,
[1:07:27] but he did preach on it. Amen. If you go
[1:07:29] through the message and things, he is he
[1:07:31] did preach on it. Amen. And uh and see
[1:07:34] it says it was usually in a negative
[1:07:35] context because when brother Ben better
[1:07:37] say you're reaping the whirlwind he
[1:07:38] would talk about how you know America
[1:07:40] how you know we're reaping you know all
[1:07:42] the parties and all the uh all the
[1:07:44] comedy you know want to have fun all the
[1:07:45] time. See the they're sewing to the
[1:07:47] wind. Amen. See and um the whirlwind was
[1:07:50] you know the wrath that's soon to come.
[1:07:51] Amen.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; And so um but then you know he comes to
[1:07:56] the world in one way but he comes to his
[1:07:58] bride. He comes to the rod as a lion.
[1:08:00] The bride as a lamb. So that whirlwind
[1:08:01] is different for us. Amen. See, and I
[1:08:03] wanted to see, you know, when the Lord
[1:08:05] is coming to us in that whirlwind, what
[1:08:07] is happening? Amen. See, and and the
[1:08:09] handwriting on the wall, Brother Brandon
[1:08:11] says, "Oh, he rides upon the whirlwind."
[1:08:14] Hallelujah. His wave is in a whirlwind.
[1:08:16] See, because when you look at it, Job,
[1:08:19] see Job, we see wind type trials, wind
[1:08:23] type war. Amen. See, so Job was going
[1:08:25] through his own wind at the time. Amen.
[1:08:27] See, and what was he reaping to that
[1:08:29] wind? Amen. Because he understood who
[1:08:32] really was causing the wind. Amen. See,
[1:08:35] because he rides that wind. Amen. See,
[1:08:37] because see, because see, he he uses
[1:08:40] what may seem bad, but it's not exactly
[1:08:43] bad. Amen. Just like he said, it's a
[1:08:45] season. Amen. See, see. So, so, so he
[1:08:48] probably has to see because remember the
[1:08:50] Michelin statue. Amen. See, it it don't
[1:08:52] feel good, but he's shaping you shaping
[1:08:54] you how he's supposed to be. Amen. See?
[1:08:57] Amen. So when you um so see cuz Job he
[1:09:00] was going through a trial through his
[1:09:01] his own winds and he was sewing to those
[1:09:04] winds but correctly. Amen. See see in
[1:09:07] that season of winds what are you sewing
[1:09:09] to? Amen. See see I mean are you sewing
[1:09:12] to the wind itself? Amen. Or are you
[1:09:15] sewing to the to the maker of the wind?
[1:09:17] Amen. See because because look see you
[1:09:21] have you have u um Lot Lot had eyes. Lot
[1:09:24] looked. Amen. See, he looked, but then
[1:09:27] God uh God told Abraham to look. See,
[1:09:30] God fix Abraham's eyes. Amen. See, so
[1:09:32] have God fix your eyes through the eyes
[1:09:34] of faith. Amen. Not not through the eyes
[1:09:36] of of sensual seeing. Amen.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; See, and and um Amen.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; And see, because see what he did was he
[1:09:44] reaped a conference with God. Amen. See,
[1:09:46] you reap to those winds and you reap
[1:09:48] that conference with God that you're
[1:09:49] seeking for. Amen. See, see what what do
[1:09:52] you need? What is your need? Amen. Are
[1:09:54] you are you struggling with something?
[1:09:55] Amen. Is there a uh is there a a
[1:09:57] question? Are you stuck between calls or
[1:09:59] a decision? Amen. What is it? Whatever
[1:10:02] you need. Amen. Uh uh uh that's when you
[1:10:05] sew towards that. Amen. In faith and
[1:10:07] prayer, like brother Benham said, a
[1:10:08] simple prayer of faith. Amen. And what
[1:10:10] happens? Amen. He'll come down. Amen.
[1:10:13] And we know that and he comes down in
[1:10:15] many different ways as we'll get into
[1:10:16] later on. He comes down in many
[1:10:18] different ways. Amen. But primarily
[1:10:20] today, he he works through man. Amen. As
[1:10:22] brother Benham said, it's the hardest
[1:10:24] thing for a man to do is to get for you
[1:10:26] to receive another man. Amen. Amen. See,
[1:10:29] because that's how God's working today.
[1:10:31] Amen. Because it's the pillar of fire
[1:10:32] now. He's in his people. Amen. He's
[1:10:34] talking through his people. You have to
[1:10:35] be sensitive to the spirit. Amen.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. See, see, it
[1:10:40] says it says in um in uh uh uh brother
[1:10:44] Brham says in the handwriting on the
[1:10:45] wall, he says, "Oh, he rides upon the
[1:10:47] whirlwind." Amen. See, and there's
[1:10:49] another quote. Brother Brennham says he
[1:10:50] takes the north, the south, the east,
[1:10:52] the west, all those winds and he rides
[1:10:54] them. Amen. See, it says he rides upon
[1:10:56] the whirlwind. His wave is in the
[1:10:58] whirlwind. See, and it says that Job, he
[1:11:01] reaped that conference with the
[1:11:02] whirlwind. Amen. See, and and what
[1:11:05] happened? See, uh, brother Brandham says
[1:11:07] and um, 1965, I have heard, but now I
[1:11:11] see. He says, so just about that time,
[1:11:13] this is brother Brennham when the
[1:11:15] whirlwind came to him. Yes, sir. He
[1:11:16] says, "So just about that time, I heard
[1:11:19] something come off the top of the
[1:11:20] mountain up there. A whirlwind rolling
[1:11:23] around and around. See, and here come
[1:11:25] down like that. And the spirit of God
[1:11:27] moved over the boat and said, "Stand to
[1:11:29] your feet." Said, "Speak to the dead
[1:11:31] fish. Say, I give you back your life."
[1:11:33] Amen. So when you reap that whirlwind,
[1:11:34] what does it do? Amen. It brings that
[1:11:36] third pull. Amen. It's it bring it
[1:11:38] brings it tells you what to say. Amen.
[1:11:40] See see because because look look. Amen.
[1:11:44] Look, because you see when we think of
[1:11:48] the third pull in speaking, Amen. See,
[1:11:50] it's not it's not you speaking on your
[1:11:52] own accord. Amen. It's the Lord
[1:11:54] speaking. Amen. See, because when we
[1:11:56] speak of Hattie, right, Amen. The Lord
[1:11:58] spoke through her. Amen. She the Lord
[1:11:59] told her what to say because she ain't
[1:12:01] know what to ask for. See, we got many
[1:12:03] things in our lives we could ask for and
[1:12:05] issues and and things we want. Amen. But
[1:12:08] it's it's God in you that'll tell you
[1:12:10] what to say. Amen.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. See? Amen. Because when he reaped
[1:12:13] that whirlwind, the whirlwind will give
[1:12:15] you the instruction. Amen. See, because
[1:12:17] because I was speaking to a brother um I
[1:12:19] was speaking to a brother recently and
[1:12:21] he uh we were speaking and you know um
[1:12:25] there was a quote I never seen before.
[1:12:26] Brother Benham said uh back in the
[1:12:28] scriptural days it was so common for men
[1:12:31] to for God to appear before men. Amen.
[1:12:34] It was so common but it's not common no
[1:12:36] more. Amen. Because we got too much too
[1:12:37] many voices today. Amen. Too much in the
[1:12:40] way today. Amen. Uh uh too much on the
[1:12:43] radios, too much on the phones. Amen.
[1:12:45] It's is is everything everywhere. Amen.
[1:12:48] Everything is vying for your attention.
[1:12:49] Amen. All the distractions. Amen. See,
[1:12:52] so if you if you want to have that
[1:12:55] conference with God, that conversation
[1:12:56] with God that you're seeking for. Amen.
[1:12:58] Because every believer wants that wants
[1:13:00] that whirlwind in their lives. Amen.
[1:13:02] See, cuz Brother Bham said, if you
[1:13:04] believe and just to believe, then
[1:13:05] something wrong. Amen. It has to be a
[1:13:07] reason for you to believe. Amen. You
[1:13:09] have to have that experience to believe.
[1:13:11] Amen. See, so we're so so we've had the
[1:13:13] experience in our hearts. Amen. But but
[1:13:15] but Lord, see Moses Moses had the
[1:13:19] experience with God. Amen. But yet
[1:13:21] again, he still wanted to see him. Amen.
[1:13:23] See, see. So it's not wrong. Amen.
[1:13:25] You're not disgracing God if you say,
[1:13:27] "Lord, I want to see you, Lord." Amen.
[1:13:29] See, Lord, see, Lord, see, see, look,
[1:13:31] I've been in this message for a long
[1:13:33] time, Lord. I believe you for a long
[1:13:34] time. I've been doing everything in my
[1:13:36] power I can, Lord. But Lord, I want to
[1:13:38] see you. I want something in my life,
[1:13:40] something. Amen. Show me something,
[1:13:42] Lord. Amen. See, because I know who I'm
[1:13:44] believing to, Lord. I'm not doubting
[1:13:46] you. It's not doubt. Amen. Amen. It's
[1:13:49] more of a push. Amen. See, because more
[1:13:51] revelation brings more of a
[1:13:52] relationship. Amen. More relationship
[1:13:54] brings more revelation. See, it's a
[1:13:56] cycle. Amen. It's a wheel. Amen. See, we
[1:13:58] get we'll get into that later, too. It's
[1:13:59] a wheel in the middle of a wheel that
[1:14:00] keeps turning. Amen. Amen. See, and then
[1:14:04] uh uh in in conference with God, Brother
[1:14:06] Brennham says, "But think that God
[1:14:09] invited us. God invited you. Amen. See,
[1:14:11] cuz before the foundation of the world,
[1:14:14] amen, you were chosen. Amen. See, it
[1:14:16] wasn't it was it's not by by not not by
[1:14:19] not by power, not by might, by the
[1:14:21] spirit, sayeth the Lord. Amen. No man
[1:14:23] can call can call him Christ ex Jesus
[1:14:26] except except by the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[1:14:29] See, so it's not you anyway who did all
[1:14:31] this. Amen. Lord, you called me here.
[1:14:32] Amen. I didn't ask to be here. I didn't
[1:14:34] ask to be on this earth, Lord. But I'm
[1:14:36] here. Amen. and and out of and out of
[1:14:38] all these people in the world. Amen. Or
[1:14:40] all the religions of the world. Amen.

[1:14:44] you here tonight? Amen. Out of out of
[1:14:46] everywhere you could have been. Amen.

[1:14:49] some food, doing anything else. Amen.
[1:14:51] But you're here tonight. Amen. See?
[1:14:54] Amen.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, it says, "But think that God
[1:14:58] invited us." God invited you. See,
[1:15:00] brother Brandham says that Jesus is the
[1:15:02] one knocking on the door. Amen. See, but
[1:15:04] it's up to us to open the door. Amen.
[1:15:06] You see, remember that uh that painting
[1:15:08] he said he said um um why uh why the
[1:15:11] knob's on the wrong side. He said, "No,
[1:15:12] it's up to you to open the door." Amen.
[1:15:14] See, and and and and see see we're
[1:15:17] opening the door. Amen. See, because we
[1:15:19] we believe this message. Amen. See, uh

[1:15:24] good works because we love God. Amen.
[1:15:26] See, see, so we're doing the right
[1:15:28] things. Amen. See, and and and and uh uh
[1:15:31] uh brother Benham says that he says
[1:15:33] that, you know, um that God wants to
[1:15:34] give us the Holy Spirit more than we
[1:15:36] want it. Amen. So, he's right here. He

[1:15:50] heaven invited you and I see poor finite
[1:15:54] people poor and invited us to come and
[1:15:57] talk it to him and talk it over of
[1:15:59] eternal life. Amen. Though our sins be
[1:16:02] as scarlet, yet they shall be white like
[1:16:04] snow. See, and further on, brother
[1:16:06] Benham says, "And God calls for a
[1:16:09] conference, all these great rich things
[1:16:11] in the word of God." It makes us rich
[1:16:13] people to know that God has given us an

[1:18:26] has all the checks and the the nice
[1:18:28] lovely pictures. Amen. This Bible is
[1:18:31] nice. It's lovely. Amen. See, because

[1:19:21] "Well, I mean, see, see, you don't
[1:19:23] really got revelation because it just it
[1:19:24] was just given to you." Amen. You you

[1:19:58] element despite the revelation. Amen.
[1:20:00] See, that's what we want. Amen. See,

[1:20:49] she didn't have a have someone to show
[1:20:51] her what the letters really were saying,
[1:20:52] she would she was going to die. Amen.

[1:23:16] working, you know.
[1:23:18] I got whole bunch of revelations through
[1:23:19] math,
[1:23:21] you know. And um so right now the Lord
[1:23:24] has me taking a economics class. Amen.
[1:23:26] It's called microeconomics. And um it
[1:23:29] uses some math. Amen. And um I wanted to
[1:23:31] share something with y'all that the Lord
[1:23:32] put on my heart.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we know that this woman, she
[1:23:36] had she had finances. Amen.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; And in in economics, they have this
[1:23:41] thing called an an indifference curve
[1:23:43] map. Amen.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; See, and in this indifference curve map,
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; you have two goods. Amen.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; And so you have good one here. And for
[1:23:53] this, I'm going to put Armenian here.
[1:23:58] Amen. It'll it'll make sense. It'll make
[1:24:00] sense. And then here, I'mma put
[1:24:03] Calvinistic here.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; See? And you see?
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen. And you see, and you see when
[1:24:12] we want to apply our faith to something
[1:24:14] when we're praying. Amen. You say,
[1:24:16] "Lord, I I want to know how to apply my
[1:24:19] faith correctly." Amen. See, because I'm
[1:24:21] trying to make an investment, Lord.
[1:24:23] Amen. See, because finances type because
[1:24:25] finances is faith. Amen. And I want to
[1:24:28] make the smart investment in what I'm
[1:24:29] trying to do, Lord. Amen. See, I don't
[1:24:31] want to put it all the way, put my faith
[1:24:34] in Calvinistic and go wrong. And I don't
[1:24:36] want to put my faith on many on many of
[1:24:38] them to go wrong, Lord. Amen. So, in
[1:24:40] this indifference curve map, what it's
[1:24:42] showing you is right here. This is what
[1:24:45] they call the budget line. Amen. See, so
[1:24:47] this is all of your finances right here.
[1:24:50] Amen. And one of the key principles in
[1:24:53] this is you're supposed to spend all
[1:24:55] your income. Amen. See, Lord, I want to
[1:24:57] spend all my faith, Lord. I want to put
[1:24:59] all my faith in the right in in the
[1:25:01] right area, Lord. That's what I want to
[1:25:03] do. Amen. See, and see, so this is the
[1:25:06] budget line. This is all all your income
[1:25:07] you have. Amen. And right here is the
[1:25:09] affordable range. Right here is the
[1:25:11] unaffordable range. Amen. But that don't
[1:25:13] apply to us. Amen. See,
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; and this indifference curve, how it
[1:25:17] works is this is your indifference curve
[1:25:19] right here. on this indifference curve.
[1:25:20] This is saying everything every bundle
[1:25:23] on this curve
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; is something that you're satisfied with.
[1:25:27] Amen.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; But however, the most optimal point on
[1:25:32] the indifference curve is where your
[1:25:35] where where your difference curve, which
[1:25:37] is your um which is what you like, meets
[1:25:40] perfectly meets perfectly with your
[1:25:42] budget. Amen. Right here in the middle.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Right here in the middle. Amen. See
[1:25:47] right there. Amen.
[1:25:49] Amen. See, and when I saw it, I said,
[1:25:51] "Wow, Lord." I said, "See, if I put it
[1:25:54] all up here, it's too close to the
[1:25:56] Calvinistic. I put it off here too much,
[1:25:59] Lord." But Lord, I want to put it right
[1:26:01] in the middle. All my money right here.
[1:26:03] That's why I want to spend it right
[1:26:04] here. All my faith, I want to spend it
[1:26:06] right there. Amen.
[1:26:08] Amen. And and also when you um and when
[1:26:12] they go when they teach you uh later on
[1:26:14] we we we all we all know what what a a
[1:26:18] demand line is. Amen. See uh supply and
[1:26:20] demand. Amen. See, so this is the math
[1:26:22] behind behind your demand curve. Amen.
[1:26:25] See, because your demand curve looks
[1:26:26] like this. Amen. It just goes just like
[1:26:29] that. Just like that. See, and what it's
[1:26:32] saying,
[1:26:35] this this is your goods right here.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; This is what you want to get. But this
[1:26:39] is how much it costs right here. And
[1:26:41] what it's saying is the more expensive
[1:26:43] it is, the less of it you want.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; But when I was looking at it, when I was
[1:26:49] looking at it for a believer, the more
[1:26:53] faith it requires, the more I want it.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so this is flipped for me.
[1:26:58] This ain't the same way. Amen. See, I
[1:27:00] was like, right. I said, Lord, I said,
[1:27:02] so you showing me this. This is showing
[1:27:03] me how much faith I got. Amen. See,
[1:27:06] because the more expensive it is, my
[1:27:08] life go like this. They go it go this
[1:27:10] way. See, that's how a believer works.
[1:27:12] Amen.
[1:27:14] Amen. You know, it's a man. When I saw I
[1:27:18] was It's a beautiful thing. Amen. You
[1:27:20] got You got to see God in everything.
[1:27:23] Amen. Amen. See, because because see and
[1:27:26] you can't expect to be understood by the
[1:27:28] world. Amen. Because just like the
[1:27:30] scriptures tells us, wherever the wind
[1:27:31] bloweth, that's where we go. Amen. See,
[1:27:33] so so we don't abide by uh we give into
[1:27:37] Caesar with seeds, but we're given to
[1:27:38] God what is God's. Amen. See, so if
[1:27:40] Caesar is going against God, we go with
[1:27:42] God. Amen. Amen. See, because uh because
[1:27:44] they told the apostles, "Stop
[1:27:46] preaching." They said, "Well, we going
[1:27:47] to keep preaching because God told us to
[1:27:48] preach." Amen. Amen. See? Amen. And and
[1:27:52] um and because because um you know uh in
[1:27:56] John 3:27, it says, "A man can receive
[1:27:59] nothing except it be given to him from
[1:28:00] heaven." Amen. See, so whatever is on
[1:28:03] your heart and whatever the Lord puts on
[1:28:05] your heart
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; on this indifference curve to want is
[1:28:08] yours.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, because
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; I didn't ask for it, it just hit for
[1:28:13] some reason I was going about my life
[1:28:15] and it hit my heart. Lord, it's what I
[1:28:16] want in my life. Well, you gave it to
[1:28:18] me, Lord. So, so later on, no matter
[1:28:20] what, how no matter how much faith it
[1:28:22] caused, Amen. Well, you're telling me,
[1:28:24] Lord, I can do it. Amen. See, because
[1:28:26] because faith faith is the is the
[1:28:28] substance of things hoped for, the
[1:28:30] evidence of things unseen. Amen. See, so
[1:28:33] so no matter no matter the measure, a a
[1:28:35] faith the size of a piece of grain can
[1:28:37] move a mountain, Lord. So this is
[1:28:38] nothing. Amen.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So um Amen. And uh another thing
[1:28:46] that pricked my heart, you know, when I
[1:28:48] was meditating on this, you know, uh uh
[1:28:50] brother Brandham says, "And let your
[1:28:52] light soul shine before men." He says,
[1:28:54] "Now, no matter how much I can reflect
[1:28:56] it here,
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; unless it reflects on you too, we'll
[1:28:58] never understand it." Amen. See, so no
[1:29:01] matter how much revelation brother
[1:29:02] Brandham got,
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; unless I don't got it, it don't do me no
[1:29:05] good. So I want that, too. I want the
[1:29:07] same revelation brother Brandham got.
[1:29:09] Amen. What did Elijah say? Where's the
[1:29:11] God where's the God of Elijah? Amen.
[1:29:13] See, where's the God of your prophet,
[1:29:15] Lord? That's how who I want to meet.
[1:29:17] That's the whirlwind I want to see when
[1:29:19] I pray, Lord, in my life, Lord. Amen.
[1:29:21] See, see, in my home, I want those
[1:29:23] angels in my home. Amen. That that's
[1:29:24] what I want to see. Amen. Amen. See, it
[1:29:27] says, it says, um, it says the gospel
[1:29:29] would be in none effect unless somebody
[1:29:31] was there to take it. Amen. See, there
[1:29:33] there will be many people who won't take
[1:29:35] it, but the ones that take it, it'll
[1:29:36] reflect in them. Amen. See, it says, and
[1:29:40] and this is what hit me right here.
[1:29:41] Brother Brennham says right after this,
[1:29:43] he says, you may never see a vision. You
[1:29:45] may never put your hands on a sick
[1:29:47] person and feel the charge of the
[1:29:49] almighty God make a skeleton of a man
[1:29:51] turn back to life again. You may never
[1:29:53] see him standing yonder through three or

[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; He says and here in Revelations 4, it
[1:31:57] means a living creature, not a beast,
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; but it's called beast.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.

[1:32:05] right here. This is that revelation
[1:32:07] that's revealing. Amen. This is what
[1:32:09] it's saying. This is what it really

[1:32:48] a wild untamed beast

[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; but zoom so he's saying here it's saying

[1:32:59] so zoom means a creature. See, four
[1:33:02] living Zoom creatures. Amen. Not beasts
[1:33:05] of wild Theion,
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; but Zoom living creatures. See? Amen.

[1:39:56] wilderness and all the way to all the
[1:39:58] way into the temple. So forth. And he

[1:48:34] guarded. They couldn't go back to the
[1:48:35] altar was covered with blood. Amen. See
[1:48:37] the church covered with blood. You can't
[1:48:39] go back till you're covered with blood.

[1:48:43] the true altar of God is in the heart of
[1:48:45] men. Amen. Then there's another altar
[1:48:47] down here representing the holies of
[1:48:49] holies in the holy place. Amen. See, and

[1:58:36] It's God's thumb. Amen.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; Old Micah the prophet stay with the word
[1:58:41] of God. Walk down there just as boldly
[1:58:44] as a lion. Amen. See, so it's still
[1:58:47] still there. Amen. It says the seventh
[1:58:49] seal. It says in the seventh seal,
[1:58:51] brother Benham says, now you just go
[1:58:53] back through the history and find out
[1:58:55] why exactly it will be contrary to the
[1:58:56] word. Exactly. When the first went
[1:58:59] forth, it was a lion that was prophet.
[1:59:01] That's what he said. Amen. In 1963 in
[1:59:04] the in the breach between the church
[1:59:05] ages and the seventh seal, brother
[1:59:08] Brennham says, "Now John looks on
[1:59:10] mission to write what he saw." We're on
[1:59:11] John now. He says he says, "So the
[1:59:14] apostle and prophet pick up his pen and
[1:59:17] write it." So Ben also told us
[1:59:20] evangelistic
[1:59:22] and um and apostle goes right next to
[1:59:25] goes right next to each goes right with
[1:59:27] each other too.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's a prophet too though. So that
[1:59:34] still has to go. Amen. Amen. Because
[1:59:37] brother Benham also showed us that
[1:59:41] the prophet can do all can can be in
[1:59:43] every one of these offices because he
[1:59:44] did it himself when he was on the scene.
[1:59:45] Amen. He saw prophet really can go every
[1:59:48] prophet can go everywhere around there.
[1:59:50] Amen.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; And then and then um and then in
[1:59:54] adoption and in the third seal, brother
[1:59:55] Brennham says John the Revelator, the
[1:59:58] prophet John was in the vision and saw
[2:00:00] it. Amen. So, just backing it up some
[2:00:02] more. Amen.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; In adoption number two, brother Benham
[2:00:04] says, I'd rather have an So, now we're
[2:00:07] getting to Luke now.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; He says, I'd rather have an old doctor
[2:00:10] that had went through that operation
[2:00:12] many times before before I went to be
[2:00:14] cut on. I want to know somebody not just
[2:00:17] out of school. I want somebody with some
[2:00:19] experience.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; And the best experienced one that I know
[2:00:23] to call on tonight is the Holy Spirit.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; He's God's great physician. Look what he
[2:00:28] says. Great teacher. Amen. So,
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; so teacher goes here.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then and then continue in uh
[2:00:45] first John 3 uh 3 and2. Amen. Let's go
[2:00:48] there. 1 John 3 and2. Amen.
[2:00:57] 1 John 3 and 2. Get there. Say amen.

[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; He says, "Beloved, now we are the sons
[2:01:15] of God and does not yet appear what we
[2:01:18] shall be, but we know that when we shall
[2:01:20] appear, we shall be like him, for we
[2:01:21] shall see him as he is." Amen. See, so
[2:01:26] in the preparation time, Amen. as we're
[2:01:29] preparing to meet Jesus. Amen.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; We need guards. Amen.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; To prepare us along the way cuz we're
[2:01:38] prepared with the gospel. Amen. See, and
[2:01:40] then brother Benham also says that these
[2:01:42] four gospels were the uh uh Mark, uh uh
[2:01:46] John, Matthew, and Luke. They were they
[2:01:48] were the the guards of the gospel.
[2:01:50] That's what he says. Amen. See? Amen.
[2:01:52] Amen. So these go these four gospels.
[2:01:56] Amen. This faithful ministry. Amen.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; See this is what guards the church.
[2:02:03] Amen. And the preparation. Amen. To meet
[2:02:06] Jesus Christ. Amen. See, and we'll be
[2:02:08] like him. Amen. Just like him when we
[2:02:10] see him. Amen. Amen. See, because it's
[2:02:12] for the edification of the bride. Amen.
[2:02:15] To where every joint, every everything
[2:02:19] will be in order. Amen. When it's when
[2:02:20] we see him. Amen. Amen. See, because
[2:02:24] we're all striving for something. Amen.
[2:02:25] We're striving for life. Amen. See, and
[2:02:28] that's what we're all striving for.
[2:02:29] Amen. See, cuz brother Benham says, and
[2:02:31] and the world is falling apart. He says,
[2:02:33] "Our political world, man-made system
[2:02:35] and fashions, we want everything so we
[2:02:38] can take it easy and retire, take life
[2:02:40] easy." He says, "Life wasn't intended to
[2:02:42] be easy." Amen. Life is a struggle.
[2:02:45] Anything that's got life is a
[2:02:46] struggling. Look at the trees, how they
[2:02:48] struggle. Look at every everything
[2:02:50] that's got life. It's a struggle. When
[2:02:52] we try to go get some kind of a system
[2:02:54] that takes it easy, then we're wrong and
[2:02:56] we know there's something wrong. Amen.
[2:02:58] See? Amen.
[2:03:00] In uh 1950 in Moses, brother Benam says,
[2:03:03] "Well, that's the way I did this. I just
[2:03:06] took him at his word." Amen. And there I
[2:03:09] went and you just take him at his word
[2:03:11] tonight. If you and if you may be a
[2:03:14] sinner and do not understand how to take
[2:03:15] God at his word, and then God sent me
[2:03:18] here, Amen. I want you to take take for
[2:03:21] I want you to take my word for it. Jesus
[2:03:23] the prophet. Amen. Not me the prophet.
[2:03:25] Amen. See he says he says take my word
[2:03:27] for it. See if it doesn't come to pass
[2:03:29] and God will bless you. Amen. See
[2:03:30] because in 2 Chronicles 20:20 it says
[2:03:34] they rose early in the morning and went
[2:03:35] forth into the wilderness of Jakoa.
[2:03:37] Nothing went forth. Jehoshaphat stood
[2:03:39] and said, "Hear me, O Judah, and ye
[2:03:41] inhabitants of Jerusalem. Believe in the
[2:03:44] Lord your God, and so shall you be
[2:03:46] established. believe his prophets, so
[2:03:48] shall ye prosper. Amen. So this right
[2:03:50] here, this revelation was given by the
[2:03:52] prophet. Amen. See? See? So, so just
[2:03:55] believe if if if you can't see in the
[2:03:57] words, believe the prophet. Amen. See,
[2:03:58] believe what he said because he's
[2:04:00] vindicated by the word. Amen. So, you
[2:04:01] may not see it now, but you'll see it by
[2:04:03] and by. Amen. Amen.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, he said, brother
[2:04:09] Benham says, he says, men are afraid to
[2:04:10] speak.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; They're afraid to take a stand. They
[2:04:13] have to have something behind them to
[2:04:14] back them up. some great denomination or
[2:04:16] organization or something they some
[2:04:18] great band what God called men needs is
[2:04:21] the Holy Spirit behind him to back them
[2:04:22] up amen see you stand alone today we
[2:04:26] won't do it we stand as organization we
[2:04:28] stand as a move stand this or that or
[2:04:29] the other amen but says but God wants
[2:04:32] men to be individuals like Elijah was he
[2:04:34] was the only one left so far as he knew
[2:04:36] it but he stood for the right principles
[2:04:38] noise and shakings didn't bother him he
[2:04:40] waited till he heard that still small
[2:04:42] voice and he answered and how do you
[2:04:44] hear that still small voice today. Amen.

[2:05:03] you towards Christ. Amen. That's all I'm
[2:05:05] here for. I'm here to do nothing else
[2:05:06] but that. Amen. See, so the very point
[2:05:09] of this is to show you the importance of
[2:05:10] the five-fold ministry. Amen.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, because you need, you can't
[2:05:14] go without it. Amen. That's like, that's
[2:05:16] like going to war, that's like going to
[2:05:17] war without a helmet on. Amen. You're
[2:05:18] going to get hit in the head. Amen. It's
[2:05:19] not going to work. Amen. Amen. See, he
[2:05:22] said, he says, he says, uh, but we want
[2:05:24] some kind of backing up. A man thinks
[2:05:26] because he's a minister, if he don't go
[2:05:28] out to some great organization to get
[2:05:29] them to back him up, well, he will not
[2:05:31] be able to preach. If God called you to
[2:05:33] preach, preach if you stand alone.
[2:05:35] Preach anyhow. God spoke to you. Stand
[2:05:37] out there and preach. It's your
[2:05:38] God-given right. Amen. See? Amen. Is my
[2:05:41] God-given right to share the revelation
[2:05:43] that God gave me. Amen. See, in 2
[2:05:46] Timothy 2 3-4, the scriptures say,
[2:05:49] "Therefore, endure a hardness as a good
[2:05:51] soldier of Christ." Amen. No man that
[2:05:53] worth entangle himself with the affairs
[2:05:55] of this life that he may please him who
[2:05:56] have chose him to be a soldier because
[2:05:58] you didn't choose to be a a soldier of
[2:06:01] Christ. God chose you. Amen. See? Amen.
[2:06:05] Amen. So now and and he knew he'll
[2:06:08] receive him. That's why he chose you
[2:06:09] because your affections are towards
[2:06:11] Christ. Amen. See, because see if you
[2:06:13] look at it, there's struggles in your
[2:06:15] life. Amen. The the the scripture says
[2:06:19] uh out of the treasures of your heart
[2:06:21] come the issues of your life. Amen. See,
[2:06:23] so the issues in your life, what you

[2:06:30] to see Christ do this right in your
[2:06:31] eyes. Amen. See, you're always trying to
[2:06:34] please Christ. Amen. See, so that shows
[2:06:36] who you are right there. Amen. See, cuz

[2:06:41] come come with the mind battles and
[2:06:43] attack you with that. And as a matter of
[2:06:44] fact, if it's a mind battle, if two
[2:06:47] countries are fighting over a land, they
[2:06:49] want that land because the land has
[2:06:51] potential to to to to to um the land has
[2:06:55] potential. Amen. See, there's a lot of
[2:06:57] resources in it. Amen. The the land
[2:06:59] wants to they both want to fight over
[2:07:01] that land. If the greatest battle ever
[2:07:03] falls in your mind, that means that both
[2:07:05] parties want your mind. Amen. That means
[2:07:07] if saying wants your mind, God wants
[2:07:09] your mind too. Amen. See? Amen. So that
[2:07:11] mean because God because there's a
[2:07:13] potential. Amen. Because the mind is the
[2:07:15] spirit. Amen. See cuz what you daily put
[2:07:17] in your spirit drops down to your soul.

[2:07:59] See? Amen. Amen.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm I'm about to close. Amen.

[2:08:07] answers 1961 there's a question it says
[2:08:11] is it possible for a holy ghostfilled
[2:08:12] person to be driven by thee to do minor

[2:08:49] thought you had a fight when you're
[2:08:50] trying to attain it. But now the real
[2:08:52] fight starts. Amen. See, he says, he
[2:08:54] says when you're there serving, when
[2:08:56] you're when you're down there serving
[2:08:58] the devil, he just let you slouch around
[2:09:00] any way you want to. But you once take a
[2:09:02] stand for Christ, you've got the other
[2:09:04] side. Then he changed every gun right
[2:09:06] around you. Every temptation, everything
[2:09:09] that can be thrown to you, then you got

[2:11:06] point your bride towards you, Lord God.
[2:11:08] Jesus Christ, I'm just a mouthpiece. I'm

[2:11:12] I thank you, Father God, for everything

[2:11:15] Father God, for the children that,
[2:11:16] Father God, that you've that you've

[2:11:41] throughout the week, Lord God. Oh God,
[2:11:42] in Jesus Christ's name we pray, Lord.
[2:11:44] Amen.
[2:11:46] [Applause]
[2:11:50] [Music]
[2:11:58] Praise God.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Let's give the Lord a big
[2:12:04] clap.
[2:12:08] [Applause]
[2:12:11] You talking about digging in a message.
[2:12:15] If you if you have not read Revelation 4
[2:12:18] 1 2 3, you need to go back again. This
[2:12:21] is a big homework. Amen. Praise God. I
[2:12:24] don't know how he put it all together in
[2:12:26] one sermon because if I try to touch on

[2:12:31] there's so much revelation hidden into
[2:12:34] this. But you did a wonderful job. Amen.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:12:42] In other word, all these things started
[2:12:45] since the Old Testament and they went
[2:12:48] through the seven churches and the
[2:12:50] five-fold ministry are right there. We
[2:12:52] got the teacher over here. We got a
[2:12:54] pastor over here. We got a there
[2:12:57] normally an eagle. Brother Brandham say
[2:12:59] it's a prophet.
[2:13:01] But in revelation, brother Brandham said
[2:13:03] the eagle also is an evangelist.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's why you will understand
[2:13:09] why God told brother Brandham to do the
[2:13:12] work of an evangelist because a prophet
[2:13:15] can move on into those two area. Amen.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; But if you wonder where is the apostle,
[2:13:21] apostle is somebody who set things in
[2:13:23] order.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; When the lion roars, everybody shut down
[2:13:27] and sit down right there correctly and
[2:13:30] sit down. And brother Brandham when he's
[2:13:32] referring to the prophet in the lion,
[2:13:34] brother Brandham specifically talk about
[2:13:36] Paul which was an apostle. So your lion
[2:13:40] right there is talking about an apostle
[2:13:42] setting things in order. You got over
[2:13:44] there your ego and you got all five
[2:13:47] ministry that are working and brother
[2:13:49] Brandham say they addressing the bride.
[2:13:51] The five four ministry are addressing
[2:13:54] the bride. That's why we believe in the
[2:13:56] five ministry. That's why we invite our
[2:13:59] brothers and sister to come and preach
[2:14:01] so that we won't be ourself but we have
[2:14:04] that five-fold ministry moving in and
[2:14:06] it's working and preparing the bride
[2:14:09] left and right. Amen.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I love when he says in Ezekiel
[2:14:14] that also out of the same thing came out
[2:14:17] the four uh living creature and brother
[2:14:20] Brandham tapped them also as the church
[2:14:22] because out of Adam came Eve. So we are
[2:14:26] coming from the same thing.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And when he say brass
[2:14:32] burnish uh brass look like gold. I
[2:14:36] didn't understand when I was looking for
[2:14:38] golden stuff for back there and they
[2:14:41] call it brass brass. And I say wait a
[2:14:44] minute brass is a different color. Then
[2:14:46] later on I learned that burnish brass
[2:14:48] look like gold. And when you look, you
[2:14:51] will see exactly look like gold. And the
[2:14:53] feet look like burnish brass. Amen.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a digging. I'm so proud of
[2:14:59] you digging so tight.
[2:15:07] Some of you might be lost a little bit.
[2:15:10] Go back home, take Revelation 4 part
[2:15:13] one, part two, part three and begin to
[2:15:16] listen to those sermon. You will begin
[2:15:18] to see everything clarify and clear
[2:15:21] where brother Ram goes into the detail.
[2:15:24] Amen.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; It's amazing and a miracle for a young
[2:15:27] man like this to touch the book of
[2:15:29] Ezekiel and the book of Revelation and
[2:15:32] put your head into it. Denomination are
[2:15:35] running away from it. But because of the
[2:15:38] message,
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; we have the prophetic insight where we
[2:15:42] can dive into it and get into it and
[2:15:44] come out of it. Amen. Amen.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; So these things can be applied in many
[2:15:49] ways. Amen. But you when you talking
[2:15:52] about the seven church ages themsel then
[2:15:55] you can get the four anointing and
[2:15:57] separate them together. And the last one
[2:15:59] will be the ego for the seven church
[2:16:02] ages. But all four is the number of
[2:16:05] deliverance the number of the earth.
[2:16:06] They work with the believer. So when you
[2:16:08] take all four of them you put them
[2:16:10] together they got the seven church ages
[2:16:12] together. Amen. The lion work with Paul
[2:16:15] and then the ox work through the dark
[2:16:17] ages. Then the man pick up with Luther
[2:16:20] and Wesley and Pentecost. Then the
[2:16:22] flying eagle that's where we are. You
[2:16:24] put them together that those four
[2:16:26] anointing are making the bride of Jesus
[2:16:28] Christ from the beginning all the way to
[2:16:30] the end. So the four of them are the
[2:16:33] church but specifically for this age of
[2:16:36] laia the anointing that is really
[2:16:39] working on us it is the ego. Not just an
[2:16:42] eagle, a flying eagle.
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; Can a lion fly?
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; Can a man fly?
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; Can an ox fly? No.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; Can an eagle fly? Why is the ego at the
[2:16:53] last stage when the rapture need to take
[2:16:55] place? Because the eagle is telling you
[2:16:58] there is a type of people that will be
[2:17:01] taking a flight. Amen. Amen. So when you
[2:17:05] see the squeeze, just know the third
[2:17:07] pull will be right there. And the third
[2:17:09] pull is in the bride because brother I'm
[2:17:12] vindicated that I know the third pull is
[2:17:14] right here.
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when you're going through your
[2:17:17] wind, through your trial, through your
[2:17:20] difficulty, saw the right thing so that
[2:17:23] you can get the whirlwind. Not a bad
[2:17:25] whirlwind, but we want the whirlwind of
[2:17:27] God where God can be closer to you and
[2:17:30] speak lip to ear to you. Amen. Let's
[2:17:34] pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are
[2:17:36] approaching you humbly tonight. Father,
[2:17:39] thanking you for your grace, your love,
[2:17:41] your mercy, and for such a miracle to
[2:17:43] see a young man that could be Lord,
[2:17:46] Father, talking about any type of
[2:17:48] things, talking about new gadget that
[2:17:51] are coming on the market, talking about
[2:17:53] what is going on on social media,
[2:17:56] posting things left and right and trying
[2:17:58] to see the things of the world. But Lord
[2:18:01] Father, this is a different caliber alto
[2:18:03] together. A young man that is really
[2:18:06] deep into the message. Showing Lord
[2:18:09] Father the diligency of standing and
[2:18:12] studying the message Lord and trying to
[2:18:14] get the mind of Christ and looking for
[2:18:16] the God of Elijah, the God of Brother
[2:18:19] Brham to be manifested in his life.
[2:18:22] Father, what a desire for a young man,
[2:18:24] Lord. Father, I pray that Lord, Father,
[2:18:27] this not stop at him, but every young
[2:18:29] man, Lord, Father, in this church will
[2:18:32] be affected by the same thing. Lord, may
[2:18:34] this not be a night that we come and
[2:18:37] watch a man, Lord, but may we see the
[2:18:39] supernatural working in the heart of a
[2:18:42] young man trying to tell us that if God
[2:18:45] can do it for one, they got to be more
[2:18:47] also that God can work through them,
[2:18:49] Lord. Father, we saw you working through
[2:18:51] the young man singing and we saw you
[2:18:54] working through another one preaching
[2:18:56] and we pray Lord. Father, we see the
[2:18:57] young man in technician that we see the
[2:19:00] young man working over there in the
[2:19:01] sound booth and all of that is the
[2:19:03] working of the Holy Spirit and we want
[2:19:06] to appreciate you father. I pray that
[2:19:08] you strengthen him Lord and may you help
[2:19:10] us Lord who are adult to always keep up
[2:19:13] a good example before them because
[2:19:16] another generation is coming Lord and
[2:19:18] they are zeroing in straight with the
[2:19:21] word of God. May you give us travel
[2:19:23] mercy Lord. Father if time terry again
[2:19:26] Lord may we meet again to fellowship
[2:19:28] about the things of the kingdom. Lord
[2:19:30] Jesus Christ I pray may the Holy Spirit
[2:19:33] take what was preached and presented
[2:19:35] tonight Lord. Father, may you minister
[2:19:37] to your children. May you give more
[2:19:39] revelation, Lord. Father, may you uh uh
[2:19:43] stir up a thirst in the heart of your
[2:19:45] children, those that are not deep in the
[2:19:47] message so that they can go back and do
[2:19:49] their homework. Lord, protect us and
[2:19:52] bless us. We also commit, Lord, father,
[2:19:54] the oncoming young sisters meeting unto
[2:19:56] their hand. Lord, protect us and bless
[2:19:59] us, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:20:02] Amen. Go ahead, brother S.
