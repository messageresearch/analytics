[53:49] preached unto you which also ye have
[53:52] received and wherein ye stand by which
[53:56] also ye are saved if you keep in memory
[53:59] what I preached unto you unless ye have
[54:01] believed in vain for I delivered unto
[54:04] you first of all that which I also
[54:06] received how that Christ died for our
[54:09] sins according to the scriptures now
[54:13] watch and that he was buried and that he
[54:15] rose again the third day according to
[54:19] the scriptures do you realize that Jesus
[54:22] Christ could have raised himself at any
[54:24] moment when they put him in the grave
[54:26] but prophetic word held him there for 3
[54:30] days because he must die he must be
[54:33] buried and he must rise according to the
[54:36] scripture amen now in St Luke chapter
[54:39] 24 St Luke chap 24 and verse number 32
[54:44] amen St Luke chapter 24 amen this is a
[54:48] very very familiar reading to the
[54:50] Believers brother Bram uses this many
[54:52] times in messages like when their eyes
[54:54] were open they knew him in St lukee
[54:57] chapter 24 and let's begin reading there
[55:00] at the 31st
[55:02] verse you love the Lord
[55:05] tonight the Bible
[55:07] says and their eyes were opened and they
[55:10] knew him and he vanished out of their
[55:14] sight amen yes sir their eyes were
[55:18] opened and they knew him and he vanished
[55:21] out of their sight and they said one to
[55:24] another did not our heart heart burn
[55:27] within us while he talked with us by the
[55:30] way now watch this and while he opened
[55:33] to us the scripture he has just raised
[55:37] from the dead according to the scripture
[55:40] and now he's walking with the two on the
[55:41] mayest road opening the scripture to
[55:45] them in St John chapter 14 St John
[55:49] chapter 14 I I know you believe this
[55:51] that the Bible speaks of the bridegroom
[55:53] right amen I believe I believe that the
[55:56] same Bible that speaks of the bridegroom
[55:59] also speaks of the Bride in St John chap
[56:02] 14 and verse 19 Jesus says yet a little
[56:05] while and the world seeth me no more but
[56:09] ye see me now watch this uhhuh because I
[56:14] live amen ye shall live also amen we ask
[56:17] the Lord this evening to add the
[56:19] blessing to the reading of his word as
[56:20] you can have your seats here this
[56:22] afternoon I want to by the help of the
[56:23] Lord from those passages of scripture
[56:26] tonight if I would take a title I want
[56:28] to talk to you on this thought for a few
[56:30] moments on walking in the precious light
[56:33] of his resurrection am walking in the
[56:35] precious light of his resurrection to
[56:38] maybe lay a foundation here brother B
[56:40] speaking 1958 and I know my redeemer
[56:43] liveth very powerful sermon he said dear
[56:46] God we are grateful this morning to be
[56:48] the people that is called by thy name we
[56:51] are so glad that we do not have to just
[56:53] imagine anymore of a great resur
[56:56] resurrection that is to come now I want
[56:58] you to catch this we are so glad that we
[57:01] do not just have to imagine any more of
[57:04] a great resurrection that is to come see
[57:06] because it's become a reality to us as
[57:10] we read it in the word I think that's
[57:12] very powerful that the the resurrection
[57:15] is no longer something that's in the
[57:17] future or a ways out there but as we are
[57:21] reading the word of God the resurrection
[57:24] is becoming a reality to us he said and
[57:27] to see that thou has promised this and
[57:29] we feel it within our souls That Jesus
[57:32] Lives he said we are thinking this
[57:34] morning the many heartaches that's been
[57:36] in life the many sadnesses that we went
[57:38] through he said the experiences that is
[57:41] toring us and throwing us to The Winds
[57:43] of the Earth how we have buried our
[57:45] loved ones and we've mourned at the
[57:46] grave he said and our soul seems to
[57:49] almost perish within us amen but then we
[57:52] can think of
[57:53] today now think about that did not say
[57:56] we can think of 2,000 years ago he said
[57:59] but we can think of today oh what it
[58:02] means amen that Jesus has raised from
[58:05] the dead he has spoiled every Power of
[58:08] the enemy when he rose up triumphant he
[58:11] took all the Shadows away he said and
[58:14] now we walk in the precious light of his
[58:17] resurrection in other words we are not
[58:19] waiting for the morning of the
[58:21] Resurrection to begin walking Amen in
[58:24] the light of his resurrection but there
[58:26] is a bride on the Earth today who by the
[58:29] message of the hour amen is already
[58:32] walking in the Blessed light of his
[58:34] resurrection brother speaking of job he
[58:37] said I know my redeemer liveth and at
[58:39] the last day he will stand up on the
[58:41] earth or after the skin worms amen
[58:43] destroy this body yet in my flesh amen
[58:46] shall I see God he said he seen the
[58:49] resurrection would be brought about by a
[58:52] man someday that's right and the sin
[58:54] question would be settled when that
[58:56] righteous one the Son of God Amen came
[58:59] to die for Sinners there was no man on
[59:02] the earth at that time or no man sense
[59:05] that could ever Bridge the way between a
[59:08] holy God and a sinful man amen but job
[59:11] here 4,000 years amen before his coming
[59:15] saw his death his burial and his
[59:18] resurrection amen and his justification
[59:21] that come amen by the resurrection now
[59:25] watch he didn't not just see the coming
[59:27] of the Lord Jesus amen the Redeemer
[59:30] resurrected but brother said and he also
[59:32] seen the absolute guarantee of the
[59:35] resurrection of the believer amen so
[59:38] joob was not just seeing the Lamb amen
[59:41] but he was seen the effect of what the
[59:43] lamb was doing amen that would also
[59:46] affect the Lamb's wife he said what a
[59:48] comfort it is to know amen that these
[59:51] things are true amen and it's not a
[59:53] fiction story I want you to say to you
[59:56] tonight the gospel amen is not a man
[59:59] it's not a church it's not a
[1:00:01] denomination amen but the gospel is the
[1:00:03] birth and the life and the death and the
[1:00:06] burial and the resurrection of Jesus
[1:00:09] Christ let me say it like Paul said he
[1:00:11] said I am so surprised amen that you
[1:00:14] would be turned to another gospel he
[1:00:17] said which there is no other amen but a
[1:00:20] make belief gospel to a denominational
[1:00:23] fiction he said she turning from that
[1:00:25] good news
[1:00:26] amen but Jesus said because I live amen
[1:00:30] ye live also he said and I live in you
[1:00:33] and the works that I do amen I do will
[1:00:36] identify myself in you he said what a
[1:00:40] message no wonder we've had a dark world
[1:00:43] of theology amen but in the evening time
[1:00:47] amen there shall come light again listen
[1:00:50] there was light in the morning time amen
[1:00:53] but according to brother Brandon amen
[1:00:55] there was to be lighted again in the
[1:00:57] evening time amen see listen he says
[1:01:00] there will be a resurrection in the
[1:01:02] evening
[1:01:04] time my goodness there was a
[1:01:07] resurrection in the morning
[1:01:09] time but there was prophesy to be a
[1:01:13] resurrection in the evening time he said
[1:01:15] it shall be light at the evening time
[1:01:18] listen because I live ye live also but
[1:01:22] stops and it is the rise of the sun he
[1:01:25] says now amen he was speaking to his
[1:01:28] wife because I live ye live also now
[1:01:32] listen to this quote what a resurrection
[1:01:34] that that was amen but what a
[1:01:37] resurrection this is to be quickened
[1:01:40] from the dead to be made alive in Christ
[1:01:43] Jesus by God's quickening power he was
[1:01:46] waved to them the word which he was was
[1:01:49] wave back to them on the day of
[1:01:51] Pentecost amen the word made manifest
[1:01:55] now and as I say it is to be waved again
[1:01:59] in the last day listen the same light
[1:02:02] that brought a resurrection in the
[1:02:04] morning time is prophesied to return in
[1:02:07] the evening time and to bring a
[1:02:09] resurrection in the evening time let me
[1:02:12] say that is coming from the word of God
[1:02:15] and the word of God is not a fiction
[1:02:18] amen the word of God is true because it
[1:02:20] Bears results amen that proves it is the
[1:02:24] truth he said this is the Bible it's
[1:02:26] God's truth it's his promise amen I have
[1:02:29] tried it and tested it and I know you
[1:02:31] can take God's word and he will make it
[1:02:34] right with you amen he will bring it to
[1:02:37] pass now we know by a prophet's teaching
[1:02:40] amen that there is to come an absolute
[1:02:43] to this
[1:02:45] generation say it is perfect in itself
[1:02:48] it is Unlimited in its power it is
[1:02:50] primarily in Ultimate see it's Unlimited
[1:02:53] in its power it is perfect in itself
[1:02:56] listen and it really is an ultimate said
[1:03:00] therefore I think everybody amen should
[1:03:02] have an ultimate every great achievement
[1:03:04] that's ever been achieved amen there has
[1:03:07] been an absolute behind it listen you
[1:03:10] cannot go through life amen without
[1:03:13] having an absolute listen you've got to
[1:03:15] be tied to something amen you can't be
[1:03:18] tied to anything you've got to be tied
[1:03:21] to something but make sure whatever
[1:03:24] you're tied to is tied
[1:03:27] itself are you hearing me make sure
[1:03:30] whatever you are tied to is also tied
[1:03:33] off itself listen you can be tied off to
[1:03:36] something but if it is not anchored then
[1:03:38] if it moves you're going to move with it
[1:03:41] amen but if you are tied to something
[1:03:43] that is anchored amen the winds can blow
[1:03:46] and the rains can fall and the storms
[1:03:49] can gather but there is an absolute in
[1:03:51] your soul because there's an absolute
[1:03:54] behind what your tithe to listen I am
[1:03:57] not tied to a church I am not tied to a
[1:04:00] preacher I am not tied to a denomination
[1:04:03] I am tied to the message of the hour
[1:04:05] listen I can trace my absolute all the
[1:04:09] way back to the throne of God listen
[1:04:11] this message is settled in heaven it is
[1:04:14] settled upon the Earth and it is settled
[1:04:17] in my heart and there ain't no Devils
[1:04:19] amen that can defeat this bride in her
[1:04:22] victory over the devil in this age we're
[1:04:24] living in
[1:04:25] [Applause]
[1:04:27] it's more than a message it's more than
[1:04:29] a book it's more than a tape it is an
[1:04:32] absolute
[1:04:34] guarantee now when you look at this word
[1:04:37] guarantee amen the word guarantee it is
[1:04:40] a formal promise or Assurance amen that
[1:04:43] is typically in writing so when you have
[1:04:47] a guarantee it's not just a handshake
[1:04:50] it's not just a good word amen it is
[1:04:53] something that has been put in right
[1:04:56] amen that certain conditions will be
[1:04:59] fulfilled listen it is something amen
[1:05:03] that gives a certainty of an outcome so
[1:05:06] when you have a guarantee listen you
[1:05:09] can't change it in the middle of the day
[1:05:11] are you hearing me if you have a
[1:05:13] guarantee amen that's why you have a
[1:05:16] contract amen if you're going to build a
[1:05:18] house you get a contract amen so halfway
[1:05:21] through the job amen they can't change
[1:05:23] the price on you they can't change the
[1:05:25] way things are done because it's been
[1:05:27] settled in writing let me say this the
[1:05:30] only absolute guarantee that I know of
[1:05:33] Amen is the revealed word of God that
[1:05:36] has been brought to us through the
[1:05:39] seventh Angels message listen this
[1:05:41] message was written in the Bible but it
[1:05:44] was preached amen by a living voice and
[1:05:48] was recorded on 1,200 books and tapes
[1:05:51] can I say this to you you've come too
[1:05:54] late to change us
[1:05:57] see amen that's why we don't believe
[1:06:01] everything that's why we don't swallow
[1:06:03] every doctrine that comes by because we
[1:06:05] got our own books and tapes we can go
[1:06:08] read for ourself what the prophet has
[1:06:11] said about the subject and we can
[1:06:13] discern what is truth and what is error
[1:06:16] listen church if there's ever been a
[1:06:18] time to get back in the books and to get
[1:06:21] back in the tapes amen now is the time
[1:06:23] to do it preachers teaching all kinds of
[1:06:26] things churches are going every
[1:06:28] direction men are interpreting can I
[1:06:31] just preach amen it's got to where now

[1:06:37] paraphrase them we got to figure out a
[1:06:39] better way to say them listen I refuse
[1:06:43] Amen to change the written guarantee
[1:06:46] that has coming this generation listen
[1:06:48] if you want to go to hell change the
[1:06:50] message if you want to go to tribulation
[1:06:53] change the message but ask for me and my
[1:06:56] house we're going to stand on what a
[1:06:59] prophet Tau every dotted eye every cross

[1:08:15] will make with the house of Israel after
[1:08:18] those days sayith the Lord amen I will

[1:08:31] hearts somebody say well I think we need
[1:08:34] to stream brother so and so I think we
[1:08:35] need to follow brother so and so I think
[1:08:37] we need to go back to listen to
[1:08:40] tapes come on Church a amen can I preach
[1:08:45] amen y'all remember when he used to hear
[1:08:48] something preach a little different
[1:08:49] right and you went to somebody and you
[1:08:51] said hey Heen where did Brother B teach
[1:08:53] at that's because you were listening to
[1:08:55] the tapes and you had the ability to
[1:08:57] determine what was certain and uncertain
[1:09:00] but then you start listening to brother
[1:09:01] so and so amen and he teaches it
[1:09:04] different than brother Brandon listen I
[1:09:05] am not going to be corrected amen by the
[1:09:08] way brother so and so teach you
[1:09:10] something I have been called to follow
[1:09:13] the message of the hour therefore amen
[1:09:16] as you are listening to them books you
[1:09:18] are listening to them tapes amen God is
[1:09:21] writing his law into your mind and upon
[1:09:24] your heart
[1:09:26] said listen amen and and Paul says and I
[1:09:29] will be to them a God and they shall be
[1:09:32] to me a people 1956 brother says
[1:09:36] therefore the man's spirit is Blended
[1:09:39] out amen and God comes in and takes over
[1:09:42] he said then they got Fellowship one
[1:09:44] with another and the Very God that
[1:09:47] created the heavens and the Earth amen
[1:09:50] that wrote his word amen dwells in you
[1:09:54] and you believe everything that God
[1:09:56] wrote is the truth and you will accept
[1:09:59] it you will believe it and hold on to it
[1:10:02] and you'll have Fellowship see the Bible
[1:10:05] is the scripture amen that has been
[1:10:07] given by inspiration of God it is
[1:10:10] profitable for Doctrine amen for Repro
[1:10:13] for correction listen and for
[1:10:15] instruction in righteousness we've tried
[1:10:18] to tell you that the Bible amen is the
[1:10:21] word of God Amen it is wrote by God
[1:10:24] himself listen now through the lips and
[1:10:27] instrumentality of man listen God can
[1:10:30] write himself amen God can speak himself
[1:10:34] God can do what he wants to amen but he
[1:10:36] chose man to do it listen because the
[1:10:39] man that wrote it is a part of
[1:10:43] God so God wrote the Bible he said the
[1:10:47] men didn't even know what they were
[1:10:49] writing in their own human thinking
[1:10:51] listen they might disagree with it but
[1:10:54] they wrote it
[1:10:56] anyhow come on Church they might have
[1:10:58] disagreed with it but they wrote it
[1:11:00] anyhow listen because men of old were
[1:11:03] moved amen by the Holy Ghost In other
[1:11:07] words they were writing out prophecy
[1:11:10] amen of the coming Messiah which was not
[1:11:13] other than our Lord Jesus Christ now in
[1:11:15] St John chap 5 and verse 46 I love what
[1:11:18] the Bible says Jesus is standing there
[1:11:21] and he said now listen for had you
[1:11:23] believed Moses amen you would have
[1:11:26] believed me now watch what Jesus says
[1:11:29] for he wrote Of
[1:11:31] Me amen Jesus stands there and says if
[1:11:35] you believe me you would believe Moses
[1:11:37] or believe Moses believe me because
[1:11:40] Moses wrote of me look at this word
[1:11:42] wrote it means to describe it means to
[1:11:45] commit to writing listen things not to
[1:11:48] be forgotten it means to record it is
[1:11:52] used of those things which stand amen
[1:11:55] written in the sacred books of the Old
[1:11:58] Testament amen by writing an epistle it
[1:12:01] is to give information to give direction
[1:12:04] listen to make so clear that it's not
[1:12:07] missed when it comes into manifestation
[1:12:10] so Moses did not just speak of him but
[1:12:13] Moses wrote of him and Jesus stands
[1:12:17] there now watch what he doesn't do he
[1:12:19] does not dismiss Moses's writings he
[1:12:22] said if ye believe not his writings amen
[1:12:25] then how shall you believe my words are
[1:12:29] you with me now see Jesus was the
[1:12:32] manifestation of the words the baby born
[1:12:35] down there an illegitimate birth in a
[1:12:37] cow stable how could that be this guy
[1:12:39] didn't go to any school he had no
[1:12:42] credentials he had no Fellowship card he
[1:12:44] didn't belong in an organization they
[1:12:46] didn't even know what school he went to
[1:12:48] amen how could this be anything amen but
[1:12:52] it was see they failed to see but but
[1:12:55] Jesus stood there and he said is this
[1:12:57] okay he said the works I do amen they
[1:13:01] testify of me he said search the
[1:13:03] scriptures for in them you think you
[1:13:06] have eternal life amen but they are they
[1:13:10] that testify amen they tell you who I am
[1:13:13] I love what brother says he said Jesus
[1:13:16] looked at him and said the scriptures
[1:13:18] are my
[1:13:20] testimony the scriptures were the
[1:13:23] testimony of Jesus Christ if you don't
[1:13:26] believe me believe the works I do they
[1:13:28] tell you who I am and they said well we
[1:13:31] believe Moses amen We Believe Moses but
[1:13:34] he said if you believe Moses you would
[1:13:36] believe me because he wrote of me now
[1:13:39] listen at the prophet's words he says
[1:13:41] they were so dark amen they were so dark
[1:13:46] he didn't say it was so dark he said
[1:13:48] they was so dark and still they couldn't
[1:13:52] see it he said I wonder if that couldn't
[1:13:54] repeat amen it's prophesied to you know
[1:13:57] it was prophesied to there you say in
[1:13:59] this day brother said oh yes because
[1:14:03] listen Jesus was all the inspired
[1:14:06] prophets testimonies all their prophecy
[1:14:09] was brought to light in his
[1:14:12] age that had been prophesied for his age
[1:14:15] I love this he lit up every candle of
[1:14:18] word that was in the Bible that was
[1:14:21] prophesied of him listen in other words
[1:14:23] y'all know what a candle is amen a
[1:14:25] candle is useless without a fire amen
[1:14:28] you can have a candle amen but unless
[1:14:30] fire comes upon it it'll give no light
[1:14:33] unless fire comes upon it it will
[1:14:36] release no kind of an aroma but if the
[1:14:38] fire ever strikes the wick it's going to
[1:14:42] give light and it's going to release a
[1:14:44] fragrance listen amen the Bible amen was
[1:14:47] the candle and Jesus was the fire the
[1:14:51] Bible said that a virgin shall conceive
[1:14:54] and Jesus struck that prophecy and she
[1:14:57] did the Bible said his name shall be
[1:14:59] called The Counselor the Prince of Peace
[1:15:01] the Mighty God the Everlasting father
[1:15:04] and he was I love this and the eyes of
[1:15:06] the blind shall see and they did
[1:15:09] everything that was prophesied of him
[1:15:12] amen it happened when he come on the
[1:15:15] earth when Jesus came on the earth he
[1:15:18] came bearing record or coming as the
[1:15:21] Fulfillment of the writings of Moses but
[1:15:24] said listen now we than thee to be the
[1:15:27] lightbearers of this age so Jesus was
[1:15:30] the lightbearer in his age but to be
[1:15:33] here now we are bearing the light in our
[1:15:36] age to manifest the promised word amen
[1:15:40] for the age that we're now living in
[1:15:42] knowing that at the beginning you
[1:15:44] allotted out your word amen can I just
[1:15:46] take time and read this he said knowing
[1:15:48] the end from the beginning each age you
[1:15:51] allotted your word to that age somehow
[1:15:55] we don't know how it ever happened but
[1:15:57] in each one of those ages as we look
[1:15:59] back upon Thy word we see there was an
[1:16:02] anointing that come in that age and that
[1:16:05] fulfilled the word so without the
[1:16:07] anointing there is no ability to fulfill
[1:16:10] the word but if the anointing comes
[1:16:13] Isaiah said the Yoke shall be destroyed
[1:16:16] because of the anointing when the
[1:16:19] anointing comes it destroys the Yoke and
[1:16:23] releases you to feel the word that is
[1:16:27] spoken over your life listen and in the
[1:16:29] day that we're now living in there is an
[1:16:31] alloted
[1:16:33] word there is an allotted word it is a
[1:16:36] promise for this age and we believe the
[1:16:38] holy spirit is here on the earth
[1:16:41] now and he's trying to find Hearts to
[1:16:44] manifest and bring to pass by
[1:16:47] vindicating the word that is now
[1:16:49] prophesied for this day and this hour
[1:16:52] listen the scripture cannot be broken it
[1:16:55] must be fulfilled Jesus said heavens and
[1:16:58] earth shall pass away amen but my words
[1:17:01] amen they shall never pass away said
[1:17:04] God's word is so real he said that's
[1:17:07] enough scripture right there to take all
[1:17:09] the communism out of the world and to
[1:17:12] convert the entire world it is an
[1:17:14] invitation to Salvation it is an
[1:17:16] invitation to Healing listen the
[1:17:19] guarantee of eternal life oh it mean now
[1:17:23] listen to me it means so much if it be
[1:17:27] received in the light that it's wrote in
[1:17:31] listen the word means so much if it be
[1:17:34] received in the light that it was wrote
[1:17:37] in let me say this eternal life is more
[1:17:40] than a cliche it is more than some idea
[1:17:43] of our imagination but eternal life to
[1:17:46] the believer is a written Divine promise
[1:17:50] of almighty God therefore I can announce
[1:17:52] to the devil tonight that we are not not
[1:17:55] here as educated Christians we are not
[1:17:57] here as theologians we are here as
[1:18:00] possessors of the greatest Revelation
[1:18:03] listen I can testify tonight I have
[1:18:06] Revelation in my soul I have eternal
[1:18:11] life well the devil didn't give it and
[1:18:14] the devil can't take it I know who gave
[1:18:16] it to me I know where I got it I got it
[1:18:20] from God I have come from God and I must
[1:18:23] go back to God
[1:18:26] Hallelujah brother said we're thankful
[1:18:28] we are thankful in the first seal he
[1:18:30] says we are thankful to be alive how
[1:18:33] many's thankful to be alive and to have
[1:18:36] this great revelation of eternal life
[1:18:40] dwelling within us listen these great
[1:18:43] Hidden Mysteries that's been hid since
[1:18:46] the foundation of the world and the lamb
[1:18:50] is the only one that can reveal it to us
[1:18:55] listen I pray he will come among us
[1:18:57] tonight and will take of his word and
[1:19:00] reveal it to us that we might know how
[1:19:03] to be better servants to him in this end
[1:19:07] time so the Revelation that was
[1:19:09] contained underneath those Seven Seals
[1:19:12] was going to release a character in The
[1:19:15] Bride of Jesus Christ to know how to
[1:19:19] better serve the Lord in the age that
[1:19:21] we're living in listen the Bible has
[1:19:24] become come a new book the Bible is not
[1:19:27] a man's book it is a prophetic book and
[1:19:31] this Bible is full of promises can I say
[1:19:35] this or written guarantees there are
[1:19:38] things that are wrote in this Bible that
[1:19:41] are written guarantees to you come on
[1:19:44] now there's certain conditions that must
[1:19:46] be fulfilled and there will be a
[1:19:49] manifestation my Bible says that you can
[1:19:52] believe for yourself and you can also
[1:19:54] for your house that is more than a
[1:19:57] scripture that is more than a good idea
[1:20:00] that is an absolute guarantee to this
[1:20:03] generation we have been called according
[1:20:06] to the revelation of the hour that we're
[1:20:09] living in oh Church of the Living God I
[1:20:12] think of all the promises all the
[1:20:14] promises in the Bible but
[1:20:18] tonight amen tonight amen I want to
[1:20:20] speak on one for a few moments that I'm
[1:20:22] very thankful for I am thank ful for the
[1:20:25] promise of light in Zechariah 14 it
[1:20:29] shall come to pass in that day that the
[1:20:31] light shall not be clear nor dark but it
[1:20:33] shall be one day which shall be known to
[1:20:36] the Lord not day or night but it shall
[1:20:39] come to pass listen so this is prophecy
[1:20:43] it shall come to
[1:20:44] pass that at the evening time it shall
[1:20:49] be
[1:20:50] light listen there will be a
[1:20:53] resurrection in the evening time said
[1:20:56] the evening light promised by the
[1:20:58] prophet of God in Zechariah 14:7 he said
[1:21:02] May again open the true believer's eyes
[1:21:05] to the events that's taking place today
[1:21:08] that is proved by the prophecies that we
[1:21:11] at the end time Jesus is coming modern
[1:21:14] events made clear by prophecy but the
[1:21:16] prophet said it shall be light again
[1:21:19] about the evening time the S oom the sun
[1:21:23] will peep out again
[1:21:25] it shall be light what the same son s o
[1:21:29] n that was revealed in the flesh in the
[1:21:32] morning time back there will be revealed
[1:21:35] again at the evening time oh Church of
[1:21:38] the Living God listen the only thing
[1:21:41] that changes is the flesh that the sun
[1:21:45] is revealed in in the morning time it
[1:21:48] was revealed in the flesh of Jesus
[1:21:51] Christ but in the evening time there
[1:21:53] would be a redemp message underneath
[1:21:56] Seven Seals that would be released and
[1:21:58] there would be Redemptive claims and the

[1:23:34] the earth and the gross Darkness the
[1:23:36] people so there's going to be a Darkness
[1:23:39] upon the Earth but there's going to be a
[1:23:41] heavier Darkness on the people but the
[1:23:44] Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory
[1:23:48] shall be seen upon thee now watch a
[1:23:51] prophet of God reads Isaiah 60 and
[1:23:54] brother Kelly right there in the middle
[1:23:56] of that age he says now good morning or
[1:24:02] Shalom darkness is gathering church he
[1:24:06] said but what is it gathering for it's
[1:24:08] Gathering to show the light listen now
[1:24:11] watch verse three Isaiah 60:3 and the
[1:24:14] Bible said and the
[1:24:18] Gentiles the Gentiles shall come to thy
[1:24:23] light listen
[1:24:24] this is a claiming light this is a this
[1:24:27] is a powerful light come on Church it
[1:24:30] doesn't say this light shall come to you
[1:24:33] but the Gentiles shall come to this
[1:24:37] light now amen I hate to I hate to just
[1:24:41] just stop here and say something but I'm
[1:24:42] going to say it okay amen amen we got
[1:24:45] people in this day and time and they get
[1:24:46] into all kinds of DNA and they get all
[1:24:49] kinds of spitting into a cup and send
[1:24:51] their DNA off hey if you're into that
[1:24:53] God bless you I ain't got no problem
[1:24:54] with it amen but what happens is they
[1:24:56] get to study a little bit and they find
[1:24:58] out somewhere they got about 1
[1:25:00] percentage of a percentage of a
[1:25:02] percentage of Jewish blood in
[1:25:05] them and now all of a sudden they're
[1:25:08] Moses and Elijah I mean they're going to
[1:25:11] they're they're they're one of the
[1:25:12] they're one of the prophets because they
[1:25:14] found a little bit of Israelite blood
[1:25:16] well let me just say this we're all
[1:25:20] Gentiles come on I hate to bust your
[1:25:22] bubble but we're Gentiles
[1:25:25] and the Gentiles were not a people but
[1:25:28] because of this light God said I will
[1:25:32] write my laws in their heart I will
[1:25:34] place them in their mind and I will call
[1:25:37] them from the darkness of the earth I
[1:25:40] will call them from the gross darknesses
[1:25:43] upon the
[1:25:43] [Applause]
[1:25:45] people Church a living God you say
[1:25:47] preacher you happy to be a gentile I am
[1:25:50] tonight I am tonight to know I was out
[1:25:54] outside of the Covenant I was outside of
[1:25:57] the Commonwealth I was outside of the
[1:26:00] household of faith but Jesus Christ who
[1:26:03] is rich in Mercy by the atoning blood he
[1:26:07] sent a word and it was a Reconciliation
[1:26:10] word and it reconciled me back to
[1:26:13] [Applause]
[1:26:16] God the Gentiles shall come to thy light
[1:26:21] B said the last days through his son
[1:26:24] Jesus Christ Jesus Christ came on the
[1:26:27] earth and he testified he said I am the
[1:26:30] light of the world he that followeth me
[1:26:34] look here shall not walk in
[1:26:37] darkness but shall have the light of
[1:26:41] life now you all know without light you
[1:26:44] cannot have
[1:26:45] life and the prophet of God said no one
[1:26:48] could deny that Israel had light they
[1:26:51] were the only people who had light as a
[1:26:53] nation
[1:26:54] it was when Egypt was so dark that one
[1:26:57] could feel it but in the homes of the
[1:27:00] Israelites in the homes of the
[1:27:02] Israelites amen there was light he said
[1:27:06] now listen but now True light has come
[1:27:10] and the True Light is the world the
[1:27:12] light of the world is Jesus he said now
[1:27:15] Moses and the prophets brought the light
[1:27:18] by the means of the scripture that were
[1:27:20] relative to the Messiah thus Israel had
[1:27:22] light amen but now now the Fulfillment
[1:27:26] of the light has come and what was but a
[1:27:28] glowing word has now broken forth into
[1:27:32] the brightness of God manifested among
[1:27:36] his people as the pillar of fire gave
[1:27:38] light at night that was wonderful amen
[1:27:41] but now light and life were manifested
[1:27:44] in the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:27:47] can I say this the light of life is
[1:27:49] shining and this Bible and his word in
[1:27:53] the hour that we live
[1:27:54] is shining upon those to catch the
[1:27:58] eternal life those who are predestinated
[1:28:02] to see it it won't do a bit of good upon
[1:28:05] the rest of them because there is no
[1:28:07] life in there to come forth by the True
[1:28:11] Light oh may I say to you tonight this
[1:28:14] light has brought a
[1:28:17] resurrection in Matthew 4: 16 the people
[1:28:22] with I know I'm reading a lot but stay
[1:28:23] with me the the people which sat in
[1:28:25] darkness saw great light and to them
[1:28:27] which sat in the region and the shadow
[1:28:30] of death amen light is sprung up now now
[1:28:34] that is not just something Jesus came up
[1:28:36] with that's a prophecy from Isaiah 9
[1:28:39] and2 it says the people that walked in
[1:28:42] darkness have seen a great
[1:28:45] light can I read the rest of it and they
[1:28:49] that dwell in the land of the shadow of
[1:28:52] death right listen we are dwelling in a
[1:28:55] land that the shadow of death is
[1:28:57] covering everything it's covering our
[1:29:00] schools it's covering our churches it's
[1:29:02] covering our politics listen darkness is
[1:29:06] covering everything it's underneath the

[1:29:26] shoulders every day with people who are
[1:29:29] under the spirit of destruction because
[1:29:32] they are living under the shadow of
[1:29:35] death but unto you Gentiles God said I I
[1:29:40] will bring a
[1:29:43] light Hallelujah we were possessed and
[1:29:46] we were condemned by God and their Idols

[1:29:51] the word of God made manifest that's the
[1:29:54] light made manifest listen David said y
[1:29:57] though I walk through the valley of the
[1:30:00] shadow of death he said I will fear no
[1:30:02] evil for thou art with me thy rod and
[1:30:06] thy staff amen they comfort me where
[1:30:10] said many times we say oh Through The
[1:30:12] Dark Shadow or the Valley of the Dark

[1:30:16] there he said it's the Valley of the
[1:30:19] shadow of death if it's got a shadow
[1:30:23] there there has to be a certain percent
[1:30:26] of light Hallelujah come on church do

[1:30:56] light Hallelujah he said there is a man

[1:46:34] message of the
[1:46:40] Hour come on Church well I know it might
[1:46:43] get tight there but let's just preach a
[1:46:45] second infidels will rise and Creeds
[1:46:48] will rise
[1:46:53] now y'all know what I'm talking about
[1:46:54] and I'm I'm I'm probably waiting out in
[1:46:56] some deep water right
[1:46:59] now infidels will
[1:47:02] rise Creeds will
[1:47:04] rise formalisms will rise Devils will
[1:47:08] rise but the light will remain the
[1:47:12] [Applause]
[1:47:14] same come on Church remember brother
[1:47:16] they had that great storm out there and
[1:47:18] he said all them birds were laying dead
[1:47:20] he said why he said instead of using the
[1:47:23] light to carry them to safety they use
[1:47:25] the light to fight against it they beat
[1:47:28] their brains out and they're laying
[1:47:30] there dead in other words he said the
[1:47:32] storms will come amen but don't only
[1:47:35] thing you got to do is walk in the
[1:47:39] light come on church this message is
[1:47:42] light I'm sorry I can't help what
[1:47:45] Devil's done with it but as for me in my
[1:47:48] house this message is the Vindicated
[1:47:51] light of the hour
[1:47:53] [Applause]
[1:47:56] that we're living in let me just say
[1:47:58] this before you can walk in the light
[1:48:00] amen you got to step in the
[1:48:02] light you know what the pro of God said
[1:48:05] well he said in the light of the angel
[1:48:07] of God Moses stand there on the mount
[1:48:08] that day everything he once had or
[1:48:11] thought would never happen it come to be
[1:48:14] a
[1:48:17] reality now I'm I'm just going to just
[1:48:20] going to get it out there that's it the
[1:48:22] message Ain respond responsible for this
[1:48:25] nonsense it's kind of like some oh God
[1:48:29] it's kind of like somebody runs off on a
[1:48:30] tangent preaching preaching crazy things
[1:48:32] about the bride age and then all of a
[1:48:34] sudden I'm supposed to stop preaching
[1:48:35] because of what somebody done with it
[1:48:38] are you
[1:48:39] crazy are you crazy I'm supposed to lay
[1:48:42] the light down and sit in darkness in a
[1:48:44] leyan age because some crazy man did
[1:48:47] something come on church I tell you what
[1:48:50] it's time to do it's time to get up it's
[1:48:52] time remember who you are and put your
[1:48:54] walking shoes on and start walking in
[1:48:57] the message of the hour
[1:49:00] again he said I think if a man woman
[1:49:03] today would ever step in the light of
[1:49:04] the Holy Spirit under the unction of
[1:49:06] God's word everything that God promised
[1:49:09] will illuminate to you and be real
[1:49:12] again oh mercy when word when God's word
[1:49:16] promised becomes enlightened by the
[1:49:17] presence of the Angel Lord Stop Moses
[1:49:19] now he's on his Ro road so let me ask
[1:49:24] you this because there's Darkness does
[1:49:26] that mean we quit using the
[1:49:28] light that's time does that mean we
[1:49:32] start questioning the light well my
[1:49:34] Bible says if we walk in the light as he
[1:49:37] is in the light we have Fellowship one
[1:49:40] with another and the blood of Jesus
[1:49:42] Christ his son amen cleanseth us from
[1:49:46] all sin look at this in the Amplified
[1:49:48] Bible but if we really walk in the light
[1:49:51] that is live each and every day in the
[1:49:53] Conformity with the precepts of God as
[1:49:56] he himself is in the light we have true
[1:49:59] unbroken fellowship with one another are
[1:50:02] you ready for this he with us and we
[1:50:06] with him and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:50:09] his son amen cleanses us from all sin I
[1:50:13] love this brother Thomas by erasing the
[1:50:15] stain of
[1:50:18] sin did I read that right by erasing the
[1:50:21] stain of sin
[1:50:23] keeping us cleansed from sin in all its
[1:50:26] forms and
[1:50:28] manifestations what are you saying I'm
[1:50:30] saying this I'm I I feel I I feel that
[1:50:34] devil pushing back at
[1:50:36] me I
[1:50:38] acknowledge let me let me let me just
[1:50:40] back up a second and say it like this I
[1:50:42] was preaching several years ago over at
[1:50:43] Josh Bennett on a Sunday morning and
[1:50:45] there was a sister there I've never seen
[1:50:46] her since she just come up to me at the
[1:50:48] service so while I was preaching I got
[1:50:50] to talking about bondage and
[1:50:51] condemnation and and and and and and
[1:50:54] things that's been put up on you and
[1:50:55] sins and scars and mistake all kinds of
[1:50:58] things like like like things you've been
[1:50:59] through and things people done and I
[1:51:01] just preached along there and I said
[1:51:02] these words brother Stephen I said now
[1:51:04] listen I said it wasn't the message that
[1:51:07] done that to
[1:51:08] you I said it's what a man done with the
[1:51:14] message I said the message didn't put
[1:51:16] that scar upon your life it's what
[1:51:19] someone did with a message
[1:51:23] that put the scar upon your life and
[1:51:25] when I said that brother Kelly she come
[1:51:27] to me after service she said brother
[1:51:28] Andrew for 20 some years I've said under
[1:51:30] bondage over something that happened by
[1:51:32] a preacher years ago and she said I've
[1:51:35] been scarred and hurt she said but this
[1:51:36] morning Jesus Christ came by my seat as
[1:51:40] the bomb in Gilead and showed me it
[1:51:43] wasn't the
[1:51:45] message she said I can say today I'm no
[1:51:48] longer offended at the
[1:51:50] message well can I say is amen if we
[1:51:54] preach this message the way brother
[1:51:55] Brandon preached this message it'll take
[1:51:58] a lot of nonsense away from the
[1:52:01] churches he preached this message as
[1:52:04] Jesus Christ raised from the dead as the
[1:52:07] savior of our sins as the Healer of our
[1:52:10] bodies as the god of Heaven as
[1:52:18] MDC now listen that word walk it means
[1:52:22] to make do use of
[1:52:24] opportunities now can I say this brother
[1:52:26] said when you see the light walk in it
[1:52:29] he said walk you don't know where you're
[1:52:31] going but keep walking now look here can
[1:52:34] I can I can I tie this together and say
[1:52:36] this we are not going

[1:55:39] is another
[1:55:42] hour this is another
[1:55:49] day this is the advancement of the
[1:55:53] Gospel it's coming to its maturity so we
[1:55:56] cannot live in what Luther said or
[1:55:59] Wesley said or some of the rest of them
[1:56:01] we've got to live in the light that's
[1:56:03] predicted for this day we're in the
[1:56:05] seventh Church age not the third or
[1:56:07] fourth Church Age The Grain should be
[1:56:10] able to receive it that's right if it
[1:56:14] doesn't it falls off and it means
[1:56:16] nothing to it the grain is matured with
[1:56:20] the light

[1:57:19] forgive me I'm I'm I'm tying this
[1:57:21] together
[1:57:24] Enoch he was the top of the Bride right
[1:57:28] he was a
[1:57:29] Believer now when you when you mention
[1:57:32] Enoch do you know Enoch done many things
[1:57:34] ahead when you mention Enoch do you know
[1:57:37] Enoch built a
[1:57:39] pyramid Enoch a stonemason built a
[1:57:42] pyramid a a
[1:57:45] pyramid that was full of
[1:57:48] Revelation that pyramid if you ever get
[1:57:51] time he meant to go in there and walk
[1:57:54] through all the Avenues and areas and
[1:57:56] Chambers and places that pyramid is
[1:57:59] loaded with
[1:58:00] Revelation do you know there's things in
[1:58:03] that pyramid that represent
[1:58:07] bread do you know that in that pyramid

[1:58:53] pyramid it said Enoch walked with
[1:58:57] God do you know why it says Enoch walked
[1:59:00] with God because the Revelation that was
[1:59:03] in the
[1:59:05] pyramid had come into Enoch and it was
[1:59:08] in his
[1:59:10] walk Enoch's walk was a perfect

[1:59:57] kept walking in the
[2:00:00] light so one day he felt his feet
[2:00:03] getting off the
[2:00:04] ground and he just kept on walking and
[2:00:07] he walked on him to Glory without even
[2:00:09] Dying God took him away because he was
