[28:04] because the question pop up somebody
[28:07] pulled up something say well when you
[28:08] open the seventh seal do you open the
[28:10] six first and this and this then
[28:14] did you have that question too
[28:19] but somebody heard the question have a
[28:20] seat
[28:22] let's handle that
[28:23] [Laughter]
[28:25] and i'm gonna call the preacher amen
[28:28] you see how the holy ghost knows how to
[28:30] get people
[28:31] amen
[28:34] hallelujah
[28:37] god working six days
[28:40] right
[28:41] the first day was labor the second day
[28:43] labor the third the fourth
[28:45] the fifth and the sixth day in the sixth
[28:48] day he created man
[28:51] amen
[28:53] which was the top of creation and that
[28:55] was it
[28:57] you know the word god was moving if you
[28:59] want to evolution the true evolution
[29:01] this is it right here
[29:03] amen not the one from darwin that comes
[29:06] from hell
[29:07] everybody care so on the seventh day
[29:11] the bible say that god rested
[29:14] so if you go on the seventh day you will
[29:16] see god sitting just the way you're
[29:18] sitting there
[29:21] and you say what are you doing today say
[29:22] nothing
[29:24] why are you not doing anything because
[29:25] i'm resting
[29:26] why are you resting because i work and i
[29:29] label six days everybody
[29:32] so the seventh day it's a quiet day
[29:35] a day of refreshness
[29:38] the bible says in exodus i believe
[29:40] 17 or 31 17 that god reflect let's go to
[29:44] exodus 31.
[29:47] i'm going to take a few minutes quick
[29:49] so don't pull too hard before you turn
[29:51] into 30 minutes
[29:56] amen
[30:02] exodus chapter 31
[30:06] verse 17. if you're there you can say
[30:07] amen
[30:09] you there
[30:12] let's go by verse 16. wherefore the
[30:14] children of israel shall keep water
[30:18] sabbath means what
[30:20] it means the rest shall keep the sabbath
[30:22] six days in the week you work on the
[30:24] seventh day khan
[30:26] why because somebody did it at the
[30:28] beginning amen wherefore the children of
[30:31] israel shall keep the sabbath to observe
[30:33] the sabbath throughout their generation
[30:36] for a perpetual covenant
[30:38] 17 it is a sign between me and the
[30:43] children of israel forever
[30:46] for in six days the lord made water
[30:50] heaven and earth and on the seventh day
[30:52] he did what
[30:54] arrested karma and did water
[30:59] so not only did god rested
[31:01] according to moses he also refreshed
[31:07] on the seventh day
[31:08] so the seventh day give you the resting
[31:12] and the refreshing
[31:16] everybody okay
[31:17] but this resting and the refreshing god
[31:21] expressed that to israel as a sabbath
[31:26] anybody okay no work
[31:28] no work for who
[31:31] work for god
[31:34] no work for who nobody work in israel
[31:37] but somebody was working
[31:40] do you know who was working
[31:42] the priest in the tabernacle
[31:46] everybody okay so when you're resting on
[31:49] the seventh day
[31:50] in the tabernacle inside there there is
[31:53] a priest working
[31:55] why are you resting
[31:57] anybody okay so this rest have a mystery
[32:00] of a priest still working
[32:06] anybody okay did i lose you
[32:09] okay praise god now when we come to the
[32:11] seal we have the first seal
[32:14] the second seal the third the fourth the
[32:18] fifth the six all the way to the seven
[32:20] the way we explain it to you you have
[32:22] the first seal the first row and the
[32:24] seals there right
[32:26] then the second one then the third
[32:28] then the fourth
[32:30] then the fifth
[32:31] then the six
[32:33] and then the seven which seal everything
[32:36] okay
[32:37] go to revelation 6.
[32:42] making me preach the seals now
[32:48] if you don't get it just relax down the
[32:50] road you're gonna get it amen
[32:53] revelation six chapter 1 i just don't
[32:56] want somebody to linger with a question
[32:58] moving on amen that's not good
[33:00] revelation 6 1
[33:03] and i saw when the lamb opened
[33:05] how many
[33:07] one of the seals
[33:10] everybody care
[33:11] i heard as the word the noise of water
[33:15] everybody okay so far so when this first
[33:18] seal was broken
[33:20] it broke with a thunder
[33:22] anybody care
[33:24] so if this the breaking
[33:27] of the seal
[33:29] everybody okay
[33:30] if the breaking of the seal
[33:33] releases the thunder
[33:36] everybody here
[33:37] that means that the thunder is inside
[33:40] the seal
[33:43] anybody okay so if you have a package
[33:47] inside this package there is a thunder
[33:50] anybody here and the thunder is the
[33:53] voice of god
[33:54] anybody care and this standard is sealed
[33:57] by a seal
[33:59] anybody care
[34:00] it's like a balloon that is sealed
[34:03] everybody okay when you open the balloon
[34:06] what happened to the air
[34:08] it comes out everybody okay so when the
[34:12] of the break the seal this is what
[34:14] releases the thunder
[34:16] everybody okay so far
[34:18] go to revelation 10.
[34:25] you there
[34:26] very easy
[34:28] amen
[34:29] verse three you there
[34:31] and cry with a loud voice as when a lion
[34:35] aurorath
[34:36] and when he had cry how many thunders
[34:40] if we got seven thunders how many seals
[34:42] do we need
[34:46] if the seals were broken were the
[34:48] thunder reveal
[34:50] you have any more questions with the
[34:52] seven thunders
[34:57] so i already preached the seven thunders
[35:00] everybody okay and seven thunders
[35:02] ordered their voices
[35:04] verse four and when the seven thunders
[35:07] had uttered their voices
[35:09] i was about to write
[35:12] so the thunder was saying something
[35:15] everybody okay
[35:17] and that thing whatever they were saying
[35:19] could be written
[35:20] anybody okay
[35:22] i was about to write and i heard a voice
[35:25] from heaven saying unto me close up
[35:28] those things
[35:36] the voice say what
[35:38] it didn't say close
[35:40] the
[35:41] voice say what
[35:43] the voice say what
[35:47] say what
[35:49] the things that the thunder
[35:52] ordered everybody care so every seal got
[35:55] a thunder
[35:58] anybody okay and those thunder got the
[36:01] voices of certain instruction of god
[36:04] written not all that are locked in the
[36:06] ceiling anybody okay so when you break
[36:09] this seventh over here anybody care
[36:13] according to revelation seven um i mean
[36:16] according to revelation 10 anybody care
[36:19] how many thunders ordered
[36:22] seven right but we know the book was
[36:24] closed right in other words when you
[36:27] break the seventh seal
[36:30] everybody okay
[36:31] you don't only break one
[36:34] the seventh seal will break every other
[36:36] seal
[36:37] as in a sequence anybody okay that's why
[36:40] brother branham say i went for the blast
[36:43] and he blasted one two three four five
[36:46] six seven like they were spelling
[36:48] something everybody okay so they're
[36:51] breaking off the f of the seventh year
[36:53] doesn't happen in one seal only
[36:56] it goes one two three four five six
[36:59] seven that's why when the angel come
[37:01] down all seven are broken
[37:04] anybody here that's what produced the
[37:07] seven angels in the constellation
[37:11] because brother branham said every angel
[37:13] was a seal
[37:15] that's why they have seven of them
[37:18] meaning the seven thunders has been
[37:21] broken down
[37:23] anybody okay
[37:24] everybody okay now that the book is open
[37:28] now you can begin to read it
[37:31] then on the morning the angel come and
[37:35] tell brother branham let's go to the
[37:36] first seal
[37:37] i am that's hill i know what it means
[37:40] the first cell means this this this this
[37:43] this this and when brother brandon begin
[37:45] to look it is contrary to larkins
[37:52] larkin's got a little glance out there
[37:54] brother branham corrected larkins put me
[37:57] on record
[38:00] brother branham did not copy larkins
[38:03] he corrected larkins
[38:06] and he went even far beyond larkins
[38:12] everybody okay so far on the second day
[38:14] de angel come back again and when
[38:17] brother branham was preaching brother
[38:18] branham say those seven ninja were
[38:20] sitting there
[38:22] making sure
[38:23] that everything that is coming there is
[38:26] exactly perfectly line
[38:28] that's why brother branham said if i
[38:30] ever preach something everything from
[38:33] the seal is totally inspired
[38:37] everybody here brother branham wanted to
[38:39] even make a mistake on the pulpit and
[38:42] the angel anointed somebody and that
[38:44] person talked to brother branham said go
[38:46] ahead and read back again
[38:48] because there is no mistake to that
[38:50] anybody here so for you to have all of
[38:53] this open you need the seventh seal to
[38:56] open that's why brother branham said it
[38:58] was only one blast but seven angels came
[39:02] in other words seven thunders came
[39:05] and when they came they were you open
[39:07] the book then you can start chapter one
[39:10] chapter two chapter three chapter four
[39:12] because the book is open if it's only
[39:15] one seal you're not going to be able to
[39:17] read this
[39:18] so when it's weeping it's ripping the
[39:20] whole book of redemption all the way up
[39:23] and the book is open that's why when the
[39:25] angel came down he came with an open
[39:28] in other words all seals has been water
[39:33] anybody okay
[39:34] so when you go to revelation chapter 8
[39:37] verse 1 the bible says when we open the
[39:40] seventy what happened
[39:42] nothing
[39:45] why silence somebody's there on the
[39:47] seventh seal
[39:49] he is the one that is coming to open
[39:51] amen why seven angels
[39:55] why seven seals how many spirit of god
[39:58] do we have
[39:59] which is one spirit manifested in water
[40:02] seven different times that's why when
[40:04] all of them gather together the head is
[40:07] who
[40:11] anybody care
[40:12] so this cloud is a great mystery
[40:16] this cloud is your message
[40:20] everybody here that's why brother
[40:22] branham said this cloud vindicate that
[40:25] the message is right

[40:32] a question why do people always try to
[40:35] attack the cloud

[40:42] i'll open the book of redemption and
[40:44] changes you completely amen

[44:54] at happy valley and we just counted an
[44:56] honor to be with you this evening amen
[45:00] praise god
[45:07] just a little simple evangelistic
[45:09] thought
[45:11] it's really the only kind i can preach
[45:14] i trust to be a blessing to you
[45:17] the bible says this
[45:19] and there went out a champion out of the
[45:21] camp of the philistines named goliath of
[45:24] gate
[45:25] whose height was six cubics and a span
[45:29] and he had a helmet of brass upon his
[45:31] head and he was armed with a coat of
[45:33] mail
[45:34] and the weight of the coat was 5 000
[45:37] shackles of brass
[45:39] which is about 78 pounds
[45:42] and he had graves of brass upon his legs
[45:45] and a target of brass between his
[45:46] shoulders
[45:48] and the staff of his spear was like a
[45:50] weaver's beam and his spearhead weighed
[45:52] 600 shekels of iron and one bearing a
[45:55] shield went before him
[45:58] and he stood and cried into the armies
[46:00] of israel and said unto them why are you
[46:02] come out to set your battle in a ray
[46:05] am not i a philistine and ye servants to
[46:08] saul
[46:10] choose you a man for you and let him
[46:12] come down to me
[46:14] and if he be able to fight with me and
[46:16] to kill me
[46:18] then we will be your servants
[46:20] but if i prevail against him and kill
[46:23] him
[46:24] then shall ye be our servants
[46:26] and serve us
[46:28] and the philistines said i defy
[46:31] the armies of israel
[46:33] which that word means curse i curse the
[46:36] armies of israel this day
[46:39] that was the wrong thing for him to say
[46:42] give me a man that we may fight together
[46:45] and when saul and all israel heard those
[46:47] words of the philistine
[46:50] they were dismayed
[46:52] and greatly
[46:54] afraid my my
[46:57] the army of god
[46:59] afraid
[47:01] let us bow our heads i want to speak to
[47:03] you for a few minutes this evening on
[47:06] why i believe
[47:07] david won
[47:11] heavenly father
[47:14] thy word is true
[47:17] i give this congregation
[47:19] and myself
[47:21] into your hands
[47:22] for your glory
[47:24] in jesus name
[47:26] amen god bless you saints you may be
[47:28] seated
[47:31] of course in our scripture reading this
[47:33] evening it's very very familiar to all
[47:36] of us
[47:37] and no doubt we've heard it from the
[47:39] time we just wee little things and
[47:41] sunday school teachers just taught us
[47:43] about the story of david and goliath
[47:47] but you know no matter how many times
[47:49] we've heard it
[47:51] it's still
[47:52] just as true
[47:56] david was just a boy facing a giant
[48:00] he was facing opposition much stronger
[48:02] than him much bigger than him and yet he
[48:06] overcame his enemy
[48:08] you see every time the devil produces a
[48:11] goliath
[48:12] god has gone to david somewhere
[48:15] the prophet said always remember that
[48:18] every time there is a goliath
[48:21] god produces a david
[48:24] hallelujah
[48:25] god produces a david and let me say in
[48:29] this day of goliaths a goliath of cancer
[48:32] and goliaths of pandemics and goliaths
[48:35] of evil and critics i woke the devil to
[48:38] know the night that there is a david
[48:42] who will meet the challenge of this hour
[48:44] amen
[48:46] god has always had a david and he's got
[48:48] him today
[48:50] now if you look at human reasoning
[48:54] goliath should have won this battle
[48:57] he was tall
[48:59] david was short
[49:01] he was the warrior
[49:02] david was a shepherd
[49:05] goliath was covered in armor
[49:08] his male coat weighed 78 pounds
[49:12] goliath was covered in armor
[49:15] david was covered in sheepskin
[49:20] who do you think vegas would have voted
[49:23] for who would have vegas put their money
[49:26] on
[49:28] what would have been the odds that vegas
[49:30] would have gave against this battle
[49:33] but you see why is that because the
[49:35] world looks at the natural part
[49:38] they look at what they can see with the
[49:40] eye
[49:41] how could this woman walk how could this
[49:43] man ever get up out of a wheelchair how
[49:45] could this man fixing the dive of heart
[49:48] disease get over it and be made well how
[49:50] can that be how can a little girl
[49:52] blinded in a train accident how can her
[49:55] eyes come open it's unreasonable
[49:58] but you cannot reason it out
[50:02] [Music]
[50:04] god isn't known by reasoning god is
[50:07] known by faith amen
[50:10] you see satan leads a man but what he
[50:13] sees with his eyes but god chose to lead
[50:16] man by his heart
[50:19] the eyes of the heart sees the unseen
[50:22] amen
[50:25] david had a sling goliath had a
[50:28] challenge oh hallelujah but david had a
[50:31] god who could not be defeated
[50:34] and let me say tonight that david's god
[50:37] is my god
[50:39] and there is no god like my god
[50:43] hallelujah
[50:50] [Applause]
[50:52] i said there is no god like our god
[50:56] hallelujah
[50:58] amen
[51:01] now the setting of this showdown
[51:03] was a valley between two hills
[51:06] on one hill was the philistines who
[51:09] served gods and on the other hill was
[51:11] the army of jehovah
[51:14] the army of israel
[51:16] they were trained
[51:19] they were armed
[51:21] they were
[51:22] god's army
[51:28] then why were they afraid
[51:31] [Music]
[51:33] they were the army of god
[51:37] and it came to pass that the philistine
[51:39] army had this challenger a big champion
[51:44] by the name of goliath
[51:47] he was nine foot and four inches tall
[51:51] he had 14 inch fingers
[51:55] from the back of his hand to the end of
[51:57] his fingers was 28 inches long
[52:01] [Music]
[52:03] he could smack you on one side to face
[52:06] and smack you on the other at the same
[52:07] time
[52:11] when you were smacked by goliath you had
[52:14] been smacked amen
[52:17] you see somebody walking with both sides
[52:19] of the cheeks red you can say goliath
[52:21] slap that boy right there
[52:25] he was a giant
[52:27] [Music]
[52:29] and he come out and he made a boast he
[52:31] said they don't need all these armies of
[52:33] suffering loss
[52:35] they don't need everybody sweating and
[52:36] getting all bruised up and just send me
[52:39] out of man
[52:41] you see how the devil is when he thinks
[52:44] he's got you on the edge he can see oh
[52:47] my when he thinks he's got the upper
[52:49] hand that's what he really likes to
[52:51] boast that's when he really likes to
[52:52] poke it into you possibly if he can
[52:56] and then i said let's have it like this
[52:58] send me out a man who'll fight me
[53:01] goliath wanted a man
[53:04] but god gave him a boy
[53:08] oh hallelujah that's my god amen god can
[53:12] take a boy and whoop a giant you see god
[53:15] don't need something big he just needs
[53:18] something yielded
[53:25] if anybody in the whole army
[53:27] of israel should have been able to fight
[53:30] this giant it was saul
[53:34] the bible said he was head and shoulders
[53:36] above every man in his army
[53:39] he was closer to goliath size than any
[53:42] other man in the army
[53:45] the prophet said he knew how to fight he
[53:48] knew how to maneuver a spear he knew how
[53:50] to raise the shield he knew how to knock
[53:52] a lick off he he knew how to train men
[53:54] he was a bishop he knew what he was
[53:56] doing
[53:58] but you see god never chose saul
[54:02] god chose david
[54:06] and if god has chosen you to do
[54:08] something they ain't nobody can take
[54:10] your place
[54:11] [Applause]
[54:13] well i'm just a housewife i'm just a
[54:15] painter i'm just this i'm just that but
[54:18] if god has chosen you for this hour
[54:21] there is nobody that can take your place
[54:27] hallelujah
[54:28] amen god didn't choose us to lose god
[54:31] didn't choose us to be defeated god
[54:33] didn't choose us just to survive but god
[54:36] chose us as overcomers amen
[54:44] they were an army god's army
[54:47] [Music]
[54:48] trained equipped
[54:50] they had tapes and books and pictures
[54:53] and belt buckles
[55:00] but the bible said that when they heard
[55:02] this boast
[55:04] they were dismayed
[55:07] and greatly afraid how could that be
[55:11] because they lacked something that david
[55:14] had
[55:18] listen to me it's not just enough
[55:21] i was in the backfield the other day
[55:22] praying and i was praying for the young
[55:25] people i just had a burden for them and
[55:28] i felt like the lord spoke to me
[55:30] and said go ask them
[55:34] are they just in the message
[55:38] or is the message in them
[55:44] it's not enough just to come to a
[55:46] message church it's not enough just the
[55:49] center of the pictures of a prophet but
[55:51] you must be born again the life of god
[55:55] must be in us amen
[55:59] what did david have he had an experience
[56:03] you'll never know god by education
[56:06] you'll never know god by reasoning out
[56:08] but god is known by experience amen
[56:17] they failed to see who they were in the
[56:20] word
[56:22] [Music]
[56:24] listen the devil don't care if we come
[56:26] and sit here on these pews if we don't
[56:28] know who we are if one day we're bribed
[56:31] and the next day we're not one day we're
[56:33] on fire the next day we're not
[56:36] you don't care if you sit here as long
[56:38] as you've got amnesia
[56:42] you see somebody with amnesia they're
[56:44] pitiful they don't know who they are
[56:47] [Music]
[56:48] and if the devil can keep you confused
[56:51] that's all he wants to do
[56:55] he always puts that little doubt
[56:58] [Music]
[56:59] he even used it against our lord
[57:02] he said if thou be
[57:05] if
[57:07] satan never denied the word he just
[57:10] tried to get jesus thinking maybe that's
[57:12] not him
[57:15] but jesus had perfect faith because he
[57:17] knew who he was in the word
[57:23] that army they lacked what joshua and
[57:26] caleb had
[57:27] what did they have they had a revelation
[57:30] amen
[57:31] what is faith faith is a revelation
[57:35] [Music]
[57:40] think about it
[57:41] these spies left they all went to the
[57:43] same church
[57:45] follow the same prophet
[57:47] was under the same message
[57:50] and they go over to spy off the land
[57:52] that god gave them
[57:54] he had already gave them the land
[57:58] god ain't no indian giver
[58:00] he don't give something and then take it
[58:02] back
[58:06] and ten of them came back
[58:08] and you know what they said
[58:10] we can't do it
[58:13] man there's jots over there
[58:16] they got walled cities
[58:19] it's just too much
[58:21] it's just too hard
[58:24] we can't do it
[58:26] and how fast the bible said
[58:29] that that night that they was weeping
[58:30] and wailing in the whole camp of israel
[58:33] how fast a negative report can spread
[58:36] through a church
[58:44] but there was two in the congregation
[58:47] who did not look to the giants amen they
[58:51] did not look to the walled cities they
[58:54] looked to the promise of god and they
[58:56] said we're more than able to do it
[59:00] gabe stood there with the revelation and
[59:02] he said give me my mountain amen
[59:07] god promised we could do it god said we
[59:10] could do it
[59:12] amen
[59:13] don't look at the walled cities we're
[59:15] not interested in the giants
[59:17] quit looking at the giant start looking
[59:19] at god's word
[59:23] but you see the devil
[59:25] always wants us to get our eyes off the
[59:28] word
[59:30] and look at the giants
[59:33] as long as your eyes sees the size of
[59:36] the giant
[59:37] that's all you'll ever see
[59:43] but god help us not to let situations
[59:47] and circumstances
[59:49] play on our emotions
[59:52] so many people are driven by emotion
[59:55] well i got prayed for i must have got it
[59:57] because i got a goosebump you can't base
[59:59] it on a goosebump
[1:00:02] you could get a goosebump off the air
[1:00:04] conditioner
[1:00:06] [Music]
[1:00:08] well i went up there got prayed for i
[1:00:10] didn't feel nothing what's that got to
[1:00:12] do with it he never said did you feel it
[1:00:16] but he did say did you believe it
[1:00:18] if thousand believe all things are
[1:00:21] impossible
[1:00:26] well brother daryl you against the
[1:00:27] motion no i'm not against the motion
[1:00:29] it's got its place
[1:00:32] but the word has the preeminence over
[1:00:34] everything
[1:00:40] amen we don't serve god by emotion
[1:00:44] we serve god by faith
[1:00:46] if you serve god by how you feel the
[1:00:49] devil will make sure you never feel good
[1:00:57] but the prophet said when men and women
[1:00:59] quit looking at their sickness
[1:01:01] and their disease and start looking to
[1:01:04] what god said about it
[1:01:07] you will take over
[1:01:10] [Music]
[1:01:12] how many believes all things are subject
[1:01:14] to jesus christ
[1:01:16] absolutely
[1:01:18] but here's the rest of the quote
[1:01:20] [Music]
[1:01:21] all things are subject to jesus christ
[1:01:24] and which is conjunction means something
[1:01:26] else and all things are subject to you
[1:01:30] in prayer when you ask in his name
[1:01:33] is all things subject to christ
[1:01:35] absolutely but all things are subject to
[1:01:38] you when you ask in his name there is
[1:01:41] power in the name of jesus
[1:01:44] [Music]
[1:01:47] he said ask what you will in my name and
[1:01:50] it will be done whatsoever things you
[1:01:52] desire when you pray believe you receive
[1:01:55] it
[1:01:56] and you shall have it
[1:01:59] god said so
[1:02:01] god said so
[1:02:03] let nothing stand in your way stop
[1:02:05] looking at the things you're looking at
[1:02:07] here
[1:02:08] look at the unseen god said we could do
[1:02:11] it
[1:02:14] look
[1:02:16] god gave moses a stick
[1:02:18] god gave shamgard an ox goat
[1:02:21] god gave samson a jawbone
[1:02:24] but god gave us his name
[1:02:29] [Music]
[1:02:29] [Applause]
[1:02:34] every man today knows he can take the
[1:02:37] name of jesus christ and meet any foe
[1:02:40] any place anytime and he will be
[1:02:43] defeated
[1:02:45] i've met witch doctors i've met demons
[1:02:47] of all sorts and never seen a time but
[1:02:50] what they bowed to the name of jesus
[1:02:54] when you speak the name jesus you are
[1:02:57] speaking an excellent word
[1:03:02] at the name of jesus dead babies sleep
[1:03:05] in the mother's womb at the name of
[1:03:07] jesus blinded eyes come open
[1:03:10] at the name of jesus the lame get up and
[1:03:13] walk
[1:03:14] amen oh hallelujah
[1:03:22] the prophet said i tell you friends
[1:03:25] when the church lost the name and the
[1:03:27] power
[1:03:28] of the name of jesus christ they lost it
[1:03:32] [Music]
[1:03:34] that first church they baptized in the
[1:03:37] name of jesus
[1:03:38] prayed in the name of jesus preached in
[1:03:41] the name of jesus took communion in the
[1:03:43] name of jesus
[1:03:46] so what what was the first thing satan
[1:03:49] done when he attacked the church
[1:03:51] he took the name of jesus out
[1:03:54] and gave them titles
[1:04:02] when you are baptized in titles you are
[1:04:04] baptized under a catholic doctrine
[1:04:10] and what did it through the dark ages
[1:04:12] they lost that name
[1:04:15] and they served him under titles and
[1:04:17] trinitarianism but what has god done for
[1:04:20] us in the last day he sent a prophet to
[1:04:23] do what restored the name of jesus to
[1:04:26] the church
[1:04:29] and he said i no longer call you church
[1:04:31] but i call you mistress jesus christ
[1:04:35] for the god that was in christ is now in
[1:04:38] his people making him the same yesterday
[1:04:41] today and forever
[1:04:47] hallelujah
[1:04:52] the prophet said
[1:04:54] when moses went down to egypt
[1:04:57] if they could have ever got that stick
[1:04:58] out of his hand
[1:04:59] they had him whipped
[1:05:01] but in that stick was where the power
[1:05:03] laid
[1:05:04] if they ever got the stick out of his
[1:05:06] hand they had he whipped it was the
[1:05:08] stick that smoked the rock it was a
[1:05:10] stick that he held into the air it was
[1:05:11] the stinky held over the waters it was
[1:05:14] god's judgment rod
[1:05:18] and what the stick was in moses hand the
[1:05:21] name of jesus christ is to the born
[1:05:24] again church today

[1:05:49] with armor and spear but i meet you in
[1:05:51] the name of the lord god of israel
[1:05:54] in the name of the lord god of israel
[1:05:57] and the prophet said the jesus of the
[1:05:58] new testament is jehovah of the old he
[1:06:02] only changed his mask
[1:06:05] from spirit
[1:06:07] to man
[1:06:11] he changed his mass from a spirit to a
[1:06:14] man called the bridegroom
[1:06:16] now he's changed his mask again
[1:06:18] [Applause]
[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:20] to a bride
[1:06:22] [Applause]
[1:06:24] and the same word speaks for the groom
[1:06:27] speaks also for the bride she's bound of
[1:06:30] his bone flesh of his flesh spirit of
[1:06:32] his spirit life of his life she is him
[1:06:35] expressed on the earth
[1:06:39] david knew where he was standing david
[1:06:41] knew how to meet that giant
[1:06:44] and i say tonight we know how to meet
[1:06:47] our goliaths
[1:06:50] in the name of jesus
[1:06:52] [Music]
[1:06:56] amen
[1:06:57] david picked up five stones j-e-s-u-s
[1:07:01] f-a-i-t-h
[1:07:03] five stones with five fingers
[1:07:06] faith in jesus and here he comes
[1:07:09] something has to happen when you come to
[1:07:12] meet your giant with faith in jesus
[1:07:18] [Music]
[1:07:19] [Applause]
[1:07:20] when he turned loose of that stone the
[1:07:23] spirit of god caught it
[1:07:25] and that stone slew goliath
[1:07:28] david cut his head off
[1:07:30] and when the philistines saw their
[1:07:33] champion laying there without a head
[1:07:36] they begin to run
[1:07:41] [Music]
[1:07:43] and the army of israel took courage and
[1:07:46] they cut the philistines pumped to the
[1:07:48] wall
[1:07:50] that's what it means tonight
[1:07:53] somebody who's got an experience
[1:07:55] to stand up and prove the power of the
[1:07:58] resurrection of jesus christ
[1:08:00] and the rest of them will take courage
[1:08:03] oh what we need in this congregation is
[1:08:06] a david hallelujah who will step out and
[1:08:08] meet the challenge of the hour
[1:08:13] amen the prophet said try it once and
[1:08:15] watch the group follow you somebody to
[1:08:17] take courage and thank god at his word
[1:08:22] how's down in oklahoma uh last year i
[1:08:24] believe it was
[1:08:26] i believe it was last year
[1:08:28] and there was a sister there and right
[1:08:30] at the end of the service she had a
[1:08:32] tennis elbow anybody ever had that it's
[1:08:33] painful you put that thing right there
[1:08:35] to kind of relax that tendon and it's so
[1:08:38] painful you can't clap
[1:08:40] but right at the end of the service the
[1:08:42] sister was standing there and she
[1:08:43] clapped her hands and she began to yell
[1:08:45] i'm healed
[1:08:47] i'm healed she said i couldn't do that
[1:08:51] but now i'm doing it i'm healed
[1:08:55] and when she's it's like the door opened
[1:08:58] when she proclaimed her healing others
[1:09:00] began to step through the open door
[1:09:03] this one was healed of arthritis in the
[1:09:05] neck this one was healed of a tumor on
[1:09:07] their leg why somebody took courage and
[1:09:10] drove the enemy to the cutting wall i
[1:09:12] tell you there's enough of us here
[1:09:13] tonight to drive every devil out of
[1:09:15] gastonia
[1:09:18] oh david do you hear me tonight
[1:09:25] the reason i believe david wood
[1:09:27] when david went to meet goliath
[1:09:30] god looked at him and laughed
[1:09:33] said am i a dog that you'd come out to
[1:09:35] meet me like that
[1:09:36] a little looking boy
[1:09:38] the prophet said he was a ruddy fella
[1:09:41] saul called him a stripley
[1:09:44] that's what saul said about it who is
[1:09:46] this little stripping out there just a
[1:09:48] little old kid you know little
[1:09:50] that probably said looking fella
[1:09:51] probably shoulders all stooped over
[1:09:56] goliath's armor probably weighed more
[1:09:58] than david did
[1:10:02] and ain't it something
[1:10:04] that saul and goliath agreed
[1:10:08] over david's qualifications
[1:10:14] saul said am i a dog did you send out
[1:10:16] this ruddy looking fella
[1:10:19] and saul said who is this
[1:10:21] who is the stripper
[1:10:23] what's his qualifications
[1:10:26] oh friends never take sides with the
[1:10:29] devil against your brother
[1:10:34] amen
[1:10:36] don't look at the size it's all
[1:10:38] i remember several years ago i was going
[1:10:41] out to preach and i went down to the
[1:10:43] barn to feed the horse
[1:10:45] when i got down there there was this
[1:10:47] little dog strange looking dog
[1:10:49] that kind of growled at me i got bit as
[1:10:52] a boy i've always been just a wee bit
[1:10:53] scared of dogs
[1:10:54] so i go back up to the house
[1:10:57] and i tell my wife i said honey there's
[1:10:58] a dog down at the barn you all be
[1:11:00] careful when i get home we'll try to
[1:11:02] find its owner i said just kind of watch
[1:11:03] them around the girls
[1:11:05] now we had an australian shepherd we
[1:11:06] called duchess
[1:11:08] when i came back from the meeting
[1:11:11] that little dog was on the couch
[1:11:14] and they named it
[1:11:21] they said can we keep it daddy i said oh
[1:11:23] no
[1:11:24] we'll feed it we'll take care of it but
[1:11:26] we will find its owner
[1:11:30] so they come us a little snow and the
[1:11:32] kids went out the sleigh rod
[1:11:37] and they put duchess up in the sled
[1:11:40] and they started off the hill here come
[1:11:42] this little dog after the sled just
[1:11:44] duchess jumped off the sled
[1:11:46] there's a fight broke out and i started
[1:11:49] screaming duchess don't kill the dog
[1:11:51] it's not ours
[1:11:54] but it wasn't long at all brochure
[1:11:57] that i was yelling
[1:11:59] little fella don't kill my dog
[1:12:04] and the prophet said it's not the size
[1:12:06] of the dog that's in the fight but it's
[1:12:08] the size of the fight that's in the dog
[1:12:12] oh don't let your qualifications be
[1:12:14] undermined well i'm not a pastor i'm not
[1:12:16] an evangelist i'm not a prophet be what
[1:12:19] god made you he will use you the way he
[1:12:22] wants to use you
[1:12:25] [Music]
[1:12:32] saul said now if you if i can't if i
[1:12:34] can't talk you into sitting down
[1:12:38] here you take my armor
[1:12:41] it's the best of the best i'm the leader

[1:12:53] why don't you use it
[1:12:58] [Music]
[1:13:00] and so he tried to put all this on david
[1:13:02] david said i can't use this

[1:13:26] he never said play what i say he said
[1:13:28] say what i say
[1:13:36] [Music]
[1:13:38] david said i can't use that
[1:13:41] it don't fit take it off of me
[1:13:43] let me go with what i know about
[1:13:47] oh my that's it tonight you don't have
[1:13:49] to have a great big education to know a
[1:13:50] whole lot of things the only thing we
[1:13:52] need to know is the power of the
[1:13:54] resurrected jesus christ let me go with
[1:13:57] that amen the power that saved me from
[1:13:59] sin that killed me from sickness that's

[1:14:37] he crossed over that little bridge
[1:14:39] he reached down and picked up five
[1:14:42] smooth stones
[1:14:44] now he didn't get five stones
[1:14:47] in case he missed four times
[1:14:51] he got five stones because goliath had
[1:14:53] four brothers
[1:14:55] and david said i'll kill them all if i
[1:14:56] have to
[1:15:01] i'll take care of the whole family or
[1:15:02] saints of god

[1:15:33] brothers i'm not afraid of the devil or
[1:15:35] his army amen
[1:15:38] for the prophet said every devil is
[1:15:41] under our feet
[1:15:50] years ago i was preaching up in kentucky
[1:15:52] my youngest daughter allison is just a
[1:15:54] wee little thing

[1:16:48] you need to tell him where he's going we
[1:16:50] need to tell him that his backbone is
[1:16:52] broken you need to tell him that he's a
[1:16:54] defeated being you need to tell him he's
[1:16:56] nothing but a bluff you need to tell him
[1:16:58] that hell was created for him it was not
[1:17:02] made for me it was made for him and his
[1:17:05] angels
[1:17:07] when the devil tries to remind you of
[1:17:09] your past you tell him his future

[1:18:06] he knew god amen
[1:18:10] why i believe david won
[1:18:13] not because he's a good marksmanship
[1:18:16] but because he knew god and he knew who
[1:18:19] he was
[1:18:21] he was a believer
[1:18:24] he was elected he was called he was
[1:18:27] anointed he was placed
[1:18:31] no matter whether you're young or old
[1:18:33] tall or short if god has called you for
[1:18:35] such a time as this you are undefeatable
[1:18:41] well if we had 500 we don't need 500 we
[1:18:45] just need one
[1:18:54] when you realize
[1:18:55] that god has revealed the truth of this
[1:18:57] thing to you
[1:18:59] there's nothing in this world that's
[1:19:01] going to defeat you in it

[1:19:26] knife in the drawer
[1:19:30] it's not this

[1:19:38] but it's the god that's in me
[1:19:41] it's the god that's in you
[1:19:44] the prophet said not you but the god
[1:19:46] that's in you
[1:19:48] not christ not the body not the man
[1:19:50] christ but the word that was in him
[1:19:55] not mary
[1:19:57] but the word that was born from her
[1:20:05] they couldn't understand it
[1:20:06] why that little boy wasn't afraid why
[1:20:09] that little boy could run after and say
[1:20:11] this day i'll take your head off
[1:20:15] they couldn't understand
[1:20:17] how could he be so bold how could he be
[1:20:19] so confident
[1:20:22] [Music]
[1:20:23] [Applause]
[1:20:27] he knew where he was at
[1:20:30] he knew where he was standing
[1:20:34] goliath made his boast but that's all he
[1:20:36] had was a boast
[1:20:38] david had a god that could not be
[1:20:41] defeated
[1:20:42] [Music]
[1:20:46] well god used to do it when brother
[1:20:47] brennan was here but he don't do it no
[1:20:49] more that's a lie that's not true
[1:20:52] if he don't do it no more he's not the
[1:20:54] same
[1:20:56] the bible said he's the same yesterday
[1:20:58] today and forever
[1:21:00] [Music]
[1:21:04] it might be
[1:21:06] the miracles might have been over for
[1:21:07] the army
[1:21:09] who didn't know who they were didn't
[1:21:10] know what they what their position was
[1:21:13] but not for david
[1:21:15] he was anointed he knew he was
[1:21:17] positionally placed in the body
[1:21:22] he knew where he was at and every david
[1:21:25] setting here tonight

[1:21:50] said where is the goliath who's the
[1:21:52] goliath
[1:21:54] it's that cancer that's eating you up
[1:21:57] it's that tumor that's hanging on you
[1:21:59] it's them cataracts on your eyes it's
[1:22:01] that arm that everything looks at
[1:22:03] it and says it cannot be
[1:22:07] done
[1:22:09] the devil says you might as well quit
[1:22:10] believing you might as well settle down
[1:22:12] you ain't no more going to get well
[1:22:15] your doctor said so all the rest of them

[1:22:33] i go to doctors don't you go to doctors
[1:22:38] people put so much faith in what the
[1:22:39] doctor said
[1:22:42] but just remember out of 100 doctors
[1:22:44] that graduate
[1:22:46] somebody graduated last in their class
[1:22:50] and it might be your doctor
[1:22:55] i'm telling you the truth

[1:23:11] lot about doctors

[1:23:20] see again i said sir
[1:23:23] i've got another doctor by the name of
[1:23:25] dr jesus
[1:23:27] and he said he hath anointed me to open
[1:23:31] the eyes of the blood
[1:23:35] that's where the anointing lays that's
[1:23:37] where my faith lays that's where our
[1:23:39] hope is in christ alone
[1:23:45] [Applause]
[1:23:49] the doctor says you can't be healed but

[1:27:14] and faced that giant knowing he was
[1:27:16] anointed by a prophet
[1:27:22] god is in his word god confirms his word
[1:27:25] and god keeps his word
[1:27:28] and god had come to david by a prophet
[1:27:31] and anointed him and told him things
[1:27:34] that are to be

[1:27:42] god sent a prophet to david to tell him
[1:27:46] who you are where you come from where

[1:28:00] we're not a caulk we are anointed to
[1:28:03] meet the challenge of 2022.
[1:28:07] [Music]
[1:28:13] david was satisfied with the prophet's
[1:28:16] message
[1:28:19] he was satisfied with what the prophet
[1:28:22] had told him when he poured the
[1:28:23] anointing all upon him
[1:28:28] a prophet has stood in this generation
[1:28:30] and has prophesied over you
[1:28:33] [Music]
[1:28:34] the things the prophet said would happen
[1:28:36] we're no longer reading about them we're
[1:28:39] living them
[1:28:42] we have become the vision
[1:28:46] [Music]
[1:28:48] [Applause]
[1:28:51] [Music]
[1:28:52] the word of god was on him
[1:28:54] the word of god was on david
[1:28:58] placed there by a prophet anointed by a
[1:29:01] prophet's message
[1:29:04] david you will reign
[1:29:06] as a king
[1:29:08] [Applause]
[1:29:12] did not he say that we are kings and
[1:29:14] priests
[1:29:16] [Applause]
[1:29:20] david you're anointed a king
[1:29:24] david said how
[1:29:27] can i die by a giant
[1:29:29] and reign his king
[1:29:34] it reminds me of paul
[1:29:35] when he was shipping his prophesied over
[1:29:37] paul you must go to rome
[1:29:40] and he put him on a ship and chains
[1:29:43] and a big storm comes up
[1:29:45] 14 days you talk about a storm i think
[1:29:48] 10 days it didn't even eat
[1:29:51] and men tried to act like they was
[1:29:53] letting down anchors but they was trying
[1:29:55] to let down little boats but the angel
[1:29:57] told paul tell them
[1:30:00] abide with the ship
[1:30:02] or perish
[1:30:07] these people walk away from this message
[1:30:10] trying to let it down under color
[1:30:13] well i've just got a few questions i
[1:30:15] better tell you like paul said you
[1:30:17] better cut that thing off
[1:30:19] you better let it fall into the sea stay
[1:30:22] with the ship
[1:30:29] the waves
[1:30:30] broke that ship up
[1:30:33] and what did they do they took pieces of
[1:30:35] the ship
[1:30:37] and it carried them to land
[1:30:45] and paul got on the shore being the
[1:30:48] messenger
[1:30:49] he was a servant to the people
[1:30:51] you see people get it wrong
[1:30:53] the bride is not a servant to the
[1:30:56] ministry
[1:30:57] but the ministry is a servant to the
[1:30:59] bride
[1:31:02] i am your servant
[1:31:06] and paul goes out and he picks up sticks
[1:31:10] and the stick was a snake
[1:31:18] in the sticks was a snake it might have
[1:31:20] been a a a a a mom bear is that how you
[1:31:22] say
[1:31:24] yeah
[1:31:26] whatever it was you had just a few
[1:31:28] breaths after he was built
[1:31:32] and when that snake bit paul
[1:31:34] the people you know what they said they
[1:31:36] said this man must have done something
[1:31:38] awful
[1:31:41] he survived those storms he survived the
[1:31:44] shipwreck he got on shore to be bit by
[1:31:46] the snake
[1:31:47] the snake was so poisoned they just sat
[1:31:50] down to watch him die
[1:31:52] they didn't even call 911.
[1:31:58] so they just sat down to watch him die
[1:32:02] i think i preached in that church one
[1:32:04] time
[1:32:06] [Applause]
[1:32:15] [Applause]
[1:32:15] [Music]
[1:32:19] that snake bit him on the arm
[1:32:22] paul looked at it shook it over into the
[1:32:24] fire
[1:32:28] and when he didn't die they said he was
[1:32:30] a god
[1:32:33] but you see paul took the word of the
[1:32:36] lord over the snakebite
[1:32:39] when that venom started crawling up oh
[1:32:41] that'd be a good message to preach when
[1:32:43] venom met faith
[1:32:48] [Applause]
[1:32:50] when that poison was going up his arm
[1:32:53] all of a sudden it met the faith that
[1:32:55] said you must go to rome oh my and the
[1:32:59] faith annihilated the venom
[1:33:03] oh don't worry about the snake bout
[1:33:05] we've got a word from the lord amen
[1:33:09] we're not going to rome we're going to
[1:33:11] heaven
[1:33:13] [Music]
[1:33:22] paul said how how can i die from a
[1:33:25] snakebite and go to rome so he took the
[1:33:27] word over the snakebite
[1:33:30] and david took the prophet's word over
[1:33:32] the globs boast
[1:33:35] [Music]
[1:33:38] he knew that's he what he was told but
[1:33:40] that's the reason he wasn't rattled
[1:33:44] where the people are absolutely scared
[1:33:47] to death
[1:33:49] i was at the bank the other day i saw
[1:33:50] two people in a car with the windows
[1:33:53] rolled up both of them had on masks
[1:33:56] scared to death
[1:33:58] i told my wife i said either they're
[1:33:59] afraid of coving or they're fixing to
[1:34:01] rob the bank one of the other
[1:34:08] the world is gripped in fear
[1:34:13] but david wasn't afraid
[1:34:20] you see the rest of them saw a giant oh
[1:34:22] going to god but david saw a target that
[1:34:25] was too big to miss
[1:34:38] it wasn't the sling that he had in his
[1:34:40] hand
[1:34:41] that killed goliath it wasn't the stone
[1:34:44] that he helped in his pocket that did it
[1:34:47] it was a hidden
[1:34:49] power
[1:34:56] you mean brother daryl you mean if we
[1:34:58] had that hidden power we could do what
[1:35:00] david did
[1:35:03] [Music]
[1:35:07] it was the hidden power
[1:35:10] that blessing of god
[1:35:12] that was upon davidson
[1:35:15] he that receives a prophet in the name
[1:35:17] of the prophet receives every prophet's
[1:35:18] reward
[1:35:19] [Applause]
[1:35:21] that blessing of god that was upon david
[1:35:24] when he let loose of that stone when he
[1:35:26] let loose of what he had when you let
[1:35:29] loose of what you've got
[1:35:31] [Music]
[1:35:33] god took it and blessed it with a hidden
[1:35:37] power
[1:35:39] it wasn't david it wasn't the stone it
[1:35:42] wasn't the slingshot it was that
[1:35:44] blessing that was on david that slew the
[1:35:47] enemy of david
[1:35:49] and david of today you have a hidden
[1:35:51] power
[1:35:54] well brother daryl if i had that hidden
[1:35:56] power i've come to tell you if you've
[1:35:58] got the holy ghost you've got it
[1:36:06] the prophet said david of today you have
[1:36:09] a hidden power
[1:36:11] the anointing of the holy ghost as david
[1:36:14] was anointed to meet his job so are we
[1:36:17] anointed to meet ours
[1:36:23] every man woman boy and girl that wants
[1:36:26] to go on with god don't pay any
[1:36:28] attention to what the world says whether
[1:36:30] we can or whether we can god promised it
[1:36:34] god said we could do it and that settles
[1:36:36] it god said there'd be a third pool god
[1:36:39] said limbs would be restored god said
[1:36:41] the dead would be raised god said
[1:36:43] there'll be a body change god said
[1:36:45] there'll be a rapture
[1:36:46] [Applause]
[1:36:48] god said it and he would never say it if
[1:36:50] he couldn't do it
[1:36:53] [Applause]
[1:36:59] amen
[1:37:01] hallelujah
[1:37:03] what we need in this hour his men and
[1:37:05] women to take the challenge to take the
[1:37:08] promise of god before the people

[1:37:12] pentecostal blessing in the last days i
[1:37:14] mean a real pentecostal pour out
[1:37:18] a cadis barnea has arrived

[1:37:31] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:37:33] we can preach the gospel with boldness

[1:37:47] that same holy spirit
[1:37:51] that was upon christ
[1:37:53] was his mantle
[1:37:55] that god gave him
[1:37:57] the anointing of the holy spirit
[1:38:00] was his mantle
[1:38:02] he sent it into the hands of the father
[1:38:05] and then my into thy hands i commend my
[1:38:08] spirit
[1:38:09] and what happened on the day of
[1:38:10] pentecost god sent the mantle back down
[1:38:16] and the church was clothed with the same
[1:38:19] anointing that he had
[1:38:24] they went up at pentecost and waited in
[1:38:26] the upper room
[1:38:29] jesus which was the antitype of elijah
[1:38:31] was taken up from death and resurrected
[1:38:34] and he sent back the mantle
[1:38:37] the same holy spirit that was upon him
[1:38:39] fell upon the church there's not two
[1:38:41] holy ghosts there's only one holy ghost
[1:38:48] it is that hidden power
[1:38:51] that every believer possesses
[1:38:54] to meet the giants hey listen to me we
[1:38:57] slay our giants one at a time
[1:39:01] [Music]
[1:39:04] the same holy spirit that was upon him
[1:39:08] fell on the church
[1:39:10] he said the things that i do shall you
[1:39:12] do also
[1:39:13] and greater than this shall you do
[1:39:19] a double portion
[1:39:23] when elijah
[1:39:25] time to go home
[1:39:27] he went down to the river
[1:39:29] elisha was following him
[1:39:32] do you know how many years elisha
[1:39:34] followed elijah 10 years
[1:39:37] during that 10 years god never cut the
[1:39:40] mantle to fit elisha
[1:39:43] but he cut and molded elisha to fit the
[1:39:46] mantle
[1:39:47] and god will never cut this message to
[1:39:49] fit our opinions
[1:39:51] but he will mold us and shape us until
[1:39:54] we fit the mantle
[1:39:59] [Music]
[1:40:01] and he walks down and noticed when they
[1:40:03] got to the river what was there
[1:40:06] critics
[1:40:09] sound familiar
[1:40:11] didn't see too many of when brother
[1:40:12] branham was here but now 70 years later
[1:40:15] all of a sudden we have these critics
[1:40:18] who want to challenge the message
[1:40:21] and the authority
[1:40:22] of the pillar of fire
[1:40:26] so there at the river was the critics
[1:40:29] but elijah took the mantle and he struck
[1:40:32] the water and the water parted and they
[1:40:34] went over and it closed behind them
[1:40:37] now they're in a secret place
[1:40:43] just elijah and elisha
[1:40:46] jesus and his brother
[1:40:52] [Music]
[1:40:54] and elijah said what do you want
[1:40:58] [Music]
[1:41:00] what are you wanting i said what do you
[1:41:02] want
[1:41:05] he said
[1:41:06] i want a double portion of your spirit
[1:41:10] notice he never asked for another spirit
[1:41:13] i want the same spirit just more of it
[1:41:19] like the guy eating watermelon he said
[1:41:21] that's good there got to be more
[1:41:22] somewhere
[1:41:26] and elijah said you've asked a hard
[1:41:28] thing
[1:41:29] but if you see me when i go you can have
[1:41:32] what you asked for
[1:41:34] now what did it cause it caused a
[1:41:36] singleness of heart a singleness of mind
[1:41:38] a singleness of eye he had to keep his
[1:41:41] eye on the promise
[1:41:44] don't look at the giant look at the
[1:41:47] promise
[1:41:48] don't look at the sickness look at the
[1:41:50] promise
[1:41:56] and a chair of the fire came down elijah
[1:41:58] stepped over in it
[1:42:01] and he went up and elijah said you
[1:42:03] promised
[1:42:06] you see the prophet of god said god
[1:42:08] likes for you to remind him of his word
[1:42:10] [Applause]
[1:42:12] you promised if i see you go
[1:42:16] down out of heaven
[1:42:20] [Applause]
[1:42:21] elisha goes over and he picks up the
[1:42:24] medal
[1:42:28] he goes back down to the same river
[1:42:32] with the same mantle
[1:42:35] with the same anointing
[1:42:37] with the same god
[1:42:39] at the same river
[1:42:41] in front of the same critics
[1:42:46] and he stuck the water he said where is
[1:42:49] the god of elijah
[1:42:51] and the water parted
[1:42:54] jesus said the things i do shall you do
[1:42:57] also
[1:42:58] [Applause]
[1:42:59] slay your giant slay your giant david
[1:43:08] [Applause]
[1:43:11] jesus sent the medal back on the day of
[1:43:14] pentecost and the church picked it up
[1:43:17] but what did god say he would do in the
[1:43:19] last days i will restore
[1:43:24] [Music]
[1:43:28] same god
[1:43:29] same anointing
[1:43:30] same word
[1:43:32] same manner

[1:43:37] boaz
[1:43:39] she pulled boaz as the bible said his
[1:43:42] skirt
[1:43:42] [Music]

[1:44:44] that next morning he gave her six
[1:44:46] measures
