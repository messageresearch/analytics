Eagles there amen amen we're going to invite sister Lely amen amen we still blasting the devil tonight amen amen um I'd like to give a quick testimony before I sing the song Just because I feel like the words preface the testimony a little bit um last Wednesday uh when brother Seth coffee was preaching um I don't know really I can't really explain it but right when the song service ended I was fine all day and as soon as the song service ended I just I got so defeated I I couldn't even pay attention during this during the service that or the sermon that he preached just because I had all these just discouraging thoughts of it was just random I know it was just a devil but it just it just clouded over the entire sermon for me I I I couldn't even pay attention because of them I just couldn't stop crying it was so random and it got to the point where towards the end of the service I was like I'm I'm not even going to go up to play the keyboard because I just don't feel like it's there's a point to it right now I just need to stay in my seat and pray and then he said you know can all the musicians come up and I just kind of stood up out of a habit and I was like well you know may as well I just stood up anyway I'll just cry and pray in my sea while I play um so as he was continuing to preach I was just you know staring at the back of his head listening and I I just had this thought in my head of God you know I I had all these thoughts that distracted me from the sermon I need him to either turn around and look at me and say something that I can take home and because I couldn't get anything from his sermon I need him to say something that I can take home you know or he's going to turn around to Zach and say something that we can both benefit from it was at 5 Seconds when that thought left my head that he turned around mid sentence and just looked at me hallu and I felt like my thoughts in my mind was just an open book because he just I don't know whoever was there he just stared at me for like 10 seconds dead silence and just spoke exactly what I needed to hear he said you know God loves you God has always loved you before the foundation of the world he knows your every need and there was such a pull to you and he said every single one of your I another thing I had had so many different things that were you know pestering me you know a little bit of debt that we'd accumulated and some and some other things that were that where we were stressed out about you know trying to figure out how to pay it and when he said all your prayers were answered all your pray prayers have already been answered I just I took that and when he prayed after I just I just put my hands in my face and I laid everything out just the words came out everything that was on my heart I just prayed out loud and I said I I know that you're going to give me exactly what what he just said i' I've fully put my trust in that and then my dad told me a few days ago you know you need to testify and I was like well I'm going to testify when I see the results and I know well that kind of that kind of you know came back to buy me because well not really you know because a testimony is never come coming back to buy you but the main thing that I prayed about was our debt that was the first thing that left my mouth and we just did our taxes a few days ago and well yesterday and we found out not only are we getting enough back to pay every red scent back but an a surplus so that's one thing done so that's the first thing done and I know everything else is just going to follow I'm not even going to worry about it it's in God's hands so this song is a testimony the devil has been attacking my body all week since Sunday even to the point five minutes before I came and sat in that chair because he doesn't want me to testify he doesn't want me to sing the song but if I have to whisper it I'm going to sing this song as a testify [Music] [Music] [Music] than I could never praise him enough for the cross of calary I could never thank him enough for salvation full and free I could never do anything to deserve such perfect love or for everything he's done I can never praise him enough for many years I've served the Lord the best that I know how giving unto him my time and telling of his power but if I were to spend unending hours on my knees praising him for everything he's ever done for me I could never praise him enough for the cross of Calvary I could never thank him enough for salvation full and free I could never do anything to deserve such perfect love oh for everything he's done I could never praise him enough [Music] tpr what as if he enough he gave his only son to hang upon the Red Cross and bear the of sin that explains why I can't express the love I have for him I could never prais him enough for the cross of Calvary I can never than him enough for Sal full and free I can never do anything to deserve such perfect love for everything he's done I can never praise him enough I never praise him enough for the cross of Calvary I can never thank him enough for Sal full and free I can never do anything to deserve such perfect love for everything he's done for everything he's done oh for everything he's done I could never Praise Him in all amen and amen amen amen amen I could never praise him enough amen for all what has done for me amen we just want to be up standing amen and invite brother Steven when I believe God Amen tonight amen I believe God I believe God ask what you will and shall be done TR and oy believe

praise God amen amen amen let's give him a big clap offering amen amen amen amen glory to God glory glory glory what a wonderful testimony that was right on time if somebody thought you out of order you were not out of order we needed that amen now I see who is pushing this thing when I'm at home I was wondering where is this coming from so it's coming from you you know when you you're in the middle of a Seri your your mind is constantly meditating on something and out of the blue something came out about depth and then the scripture open up again and it open up again I say okay the young Sisters Meeting the oncoming this is what I'm going to take and then dig into that with the de and then he begin to open the principles of how to pay a debt and I never said in it and it was in in the in the Bible all along when I look I said how did I miss the scripture right here and the first thing whenever you get the money go ahead and pay that debt first I can prove it to you by the bible let me keep it and I said and I sat down I said where is this coming from and I came tonight and I begin to search for that scripture and I was sitting right I mean underlying that same story in the Bible and he comes and it's about the depth so really the holy spirit is dealing with somebody amen people are going to come out of dep if you believe it you say Amen we don't want them no matter how big it is your faith can do it he's the god of parad amen amen it's in the Bible God took death out of people's home it's in the Bible it is in the Bible don't worry you're the first one that are line young sisters so let's dig into it and come out way sorry married people we will try one day and uh try to get the married people together you tell me which subject to start with it oh you tell me which subject you tell whether the marriage or whether depth or whether this or finances or what you tell me and then we start from there but make sure you there make sure you there when we sign up you make sure you there because I'm going to dig through the scripture and go in the scripture go to the message of the hour and pull everything together amen glory to God we greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ both visible and invisible audience we got one family members here we don't have visitor brother Micah from Canada welcome tonight again for living living spoken word Tabernacle God richly bless you welcome welcome welcome brother Micah is a younger brother to sister Amy so came down visiting and for a wedding welcome and we trust it's going to be a blessing tonight amen glory to God uh I CAU wind that brother Peter Chandler from London it's a pastor in London in UK he passed away so just remember one of the Elder just remember the Saints and the wife family in prayer amen yeah but we know he's sleeping because he went to be with the Lord all it takes is me and you to reach Perfection and before you know it everybody's back on the spot amen not to suffer anymore not any more problem backache headache whatever we have a perfect body that's going to be like his own body amen everybody clear with the Garment of a servant now we clear on that one was it hard easy so we need to dig more onto that then if you swallow that wonderful so the next one can be really positioned amen God trusted you with the Capstone this message have been trusted to be given into your hand amen so before message a Capstone is put on you that means you got perfection in you amen so God got to put you into a certain got to train you yes to know how to handle the Capstone message because it is dangerous think about anything you want coming in front of you if you upset will happen you don't want to bring a lion and you yourself begin to run amen amen you don't want to turn around and say hey may the Lord strike you and somebody's dead you need to be trained how to handle that when the disciple came out from the city they say master or I mean command the fire and Jesus turned around and look at them and say boy these need to get in Pentecost they need to go to the Apper room they're not ready yet to handle amen but the same people when the Holy Ghost came on them then they turn around they say what I have I give it to you so you got to be trained under the master amen because what you have your potential is greater than you think despite what the devil is doing the difference between a seed and a sand there is a life in a seed both of them are in the ground but one has a life when the sun come truct the seed then it makes a difference he shows that you're not just a dirt but you are are a person with a life on inside so when the Evening Sun have come the light have come on the end time now when the light is shining in our lives it begin to show the difference between you and anybody else that is in the world because in God we like pocketing his Chang you remember the changes in his pocket you remember some are pennies some are dollar some are this this it is his sovereignty amen but we are the Bride of Jesus Christ brother Angel Glover is preaching in tonight praise be to the name of the Lord we are privileged this year this year is blessing upon blessing upon blessing upon blessing because I know him correctly he is booked throughout the year but to have this kind of blessing God is doing something so don't take it like it's somebody coming to preach no no no God want the message to be delivered to this church so get ready let's pull on the give GI of the Lord and let's leave this church blessed and better than the way we came in only [Music] believe oh believe all [Music] things only be [Music] oh believe oh oh believe that all things are possible only believe and Lord I believe how many beliefs tonight Lord I believe

know that we're in for a good time amen whenever Believers get together something good always happens amen amen wherever two or three are gathered together in my name he said there I will be in their midst amen I believe tonight that I am that I am it's right here in our midst I believe he's here to do exceedingly abundantly amen above all that we could ask or thinkk amen I believe quickening powers in the building tonight amen to make the word live amen not just to talk about it to read about it but to make that word live and we do want to say God bless you all tonight and sure is an honor and a privilege to be here once again brother Steven we thank you for the open door the invitation to come and amen I tell you we've just been enjoying coming down here and spending a midweek service with you and pray it's been a blessing to you and Amen brother Steven always says let me know when you're available so amen we're trying to make it a point to to come by and visit you brother I think brother Greg I got out of the truck tonight and he said you're becoming a regular I said well we're trying to make thaten happen amen so we we sure sure love you all and appreciate you tonight amen it's a it's always an honor when you pull up somewhere and and somebody's glad to see you amen amen we we're always glad to see you all and amen seen you stand for this message under all kinds of conditions and amen I remember brother Greg there one time in a meeting at home and amen uh coming through a hard time there and just see him on his feet the at the pull pit amen pulling on the word of God we we appreciate men of God stand for this message amen amen we appreciate the men of God that preach it and we appreciate the Believers that stand for it amen and if you have your Bibles tonight we'll invite you in the scripture we want to go to the book of St John the 18th chapter the book of St John the 18th chapter and uh we just tonight want to share a little bit of our inspiration that we picked up here from the message uh to you tonight in in John 18 and verse number 37 um pilot here is recording ording the the case of Christ being arraigned before Pilate and in the 37th verse pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king to this end was I born that's and for this cause came I into the world Amen that I should bear witness of the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice now we can say it very plainly the voice is the message in verse 38 pilate saith unto him now look at this question what is truth and when he had said this he went out again unto the Jews and sa unto them I find him in him no fault at all that's but ye have a custom that I should release unto you one at the Passover will ye therefore that I release unto you the king of the Jews then cried they all again saying not this man look how look how much they had reduced who he was not this man but barabus now barabus was a robber so brother Bram says they refused the anointed word and received a robber amen let's just bow our hearts together tonight Heavenly Father we thank you for the anointing that we feel in the building Lord knowing that the angels of God have assembled themselves here tonight the Believers have gathered here at the appointed time and Lord as we as we report to duty we're inviting you to come Lord may you be the speaker here tonight may you drive out every Spirit that's unlike the Holy Spirit and Lord may you help us to get ourselves out of the way amen Lord these things we've been pondering and looking at and meditating over I pray tonight some way somehow that you would send the spirit of wisdom and Revelation into the building yes Lord that you could transfer these things from my thoughts and my heart and place them into the hearts of your children Lord that they would be edified by the ministry of perfection lord of the word of God father heal the sick Lord Save The Lost Lord filled with the Holy Ghost and Fire and we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory in Jesus Christ's mighty name we pray and all the Believers says amen amen and amen God bless you this evening amen as you have your seats I want to from those scriptures to talk to you here for just a few moments tonight if I titled this I want to speak to you on opportunity unities presented by the message of the hour amen opportunities presented by the message of the hour when you look at the definition of the word opportunity yes sir it is a set of circumstances that makes it possible to do something amen a set of circumstances that makes it possible to do something amen it is a chance for success or an advancement occurs so when there is an opportunity given amen it is a is an advancement it is a it is a possibility amen but it's because things have been fixed a certain way Amen to cause the advancement or to cause the success now brother says it very beautiful in the Easter seal he said oh Christian what an opportunity we have sir we have opportunities that St Paul never dreamed of having we have opportunities that Enoch and Elijah and all of them never had amen the opportunities that we have now amen I love how the prophet of God says this these opportunities are not in the future and they've not just been in the past amen but these opportunities are now they're in the present so we find then in 1 John 3:1 the Bible said behold what Manner amen of love the father hath bestowed upon us amen that we should be called the sons of God now listen to this therefore the world knoweth us not amen because it knew him so the world does not recognize the sons of God because they did not recognize the Son of God Amen but beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be amen but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is amen I want you to catch that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is now brother says it very beautifully he says we are in another pilot Hall we are in another pilot Hall so what it's telling me amen is Pilot's Hall was a place of opportunity the prophet of God picks this up in the Oddball and he says in the days of Jesus he was a fool to the world see to pilate but pilate was a nut see not also amen but to turn him down so pilot brother saying pilot was crazy amen because he turned him down he said he had an opportunity but when he had his opportunity to accept it he wanted some kind of a clown some kind of a trick some kind of a magic rabbit to bring out of a hat you know or something he said oh I would see you do some tricks you know or something like that he was a nut himself see he had a chance to receive it but he didn't amen pilate had an opportunity Amen to receive the anointed word but he didn't another place brother said pilate his only opportunity now think about this this was the only opportunity he ever had he said and he asked him he wanted to see something done he said let me see some sign brother said he ought to have repented amen so here's a prophet identifying amen what pilate should have done in his opportunity or when a set of circumstances was put together he should have repented but instead he sought after a sign I want to say thank God for sending us amen a Vindicated prophet messenger amen with the absolute message to bring us Amen to a complete identification of the word of God Amen and not to just look at that word not to just hear that word amen but to stand in the presence of that word and to accept that word and to receive it now amen I've just been pondering over this quote from the power of transformation brother said we are now ready for a battle the trumpet is to sound the hymns have been sung he said and now comes the word yes sir the songs have been sung the hymns have been sung the trumpet has sounded sir now comes the word he said but to hear these comments of these young soldiers here he said and myself getting old and listen around and your faith and confidence and what you have placed in to believe the message that I have been given of God now if it wasn't for you all the message would do no good if it wasn't for you all the message would do no good see it's got to be some somebody believe it amen somebody has got to believe it amen and as long as it's coming from God there is going to be somebody believ it amen amen that's what separates a message from God and a message from a church amen if it's coming from God somebody's going to believe it if it's coming from a church somebody might believe it amen listen but God has made a way he has affixed his great economy like that that when he sends for something there is something there to meet that something oh God Amen God has set it up amen God has arranged the circumstances amen God has fixed it so that when he sends something there's going to be somebody there to receive it amen can I say it like this amen just this week we had an appointment uh to to have some internet work done at the house and we had the appointment it was between 8 or 10 amen so so I forgot all about it you know amen at about 9:30 it dawned on me they were supposed to come so I called the company real quick and I said hey I said we missed the appointment I'm sorry can they still come the lady said well sir they've already been there and you weren't there uhhuh I said well I'm I'm on my way she said they've already been there and you weren't there she said now what we can do is we can set up another appointment I got to thinking about that amen they were there and I wasn't there amen and if I would have been there and they wouldn't have been there nothing would have got done so something has to be arrang amen There's an opportunity amen that when the when the worker arrives there's somebody there to let him in the house amen Church of the Living God Amen God has arranged you amen by a predestinated seed from before the foundation of the world that when he would begin to reveal the symbols he would begin to thunder the Thunders he would begin to tear off the seals he would begin to reveal the mind of God there would be somebody on the earth that would be in position Amen to meet the Revelation and when they stood face to face with it they would not say what is truth they would not say who are you they would say you are the Christ amen you are the son of the Living God my I want to say this tonight amen the message of the hour is not a man's message amen the message of the hour is a Divine message amen it's the king's message and you know what Paul said he said for this cause also we thank god without ceasing because when you receive the word of God which you heard of us you received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth somebody say truth you received it as it is in truth amen the word of God now watch they did not just receive the word of God Amen but the word which effectually amen worketh also in you that believe yes my so this word is not working in unbelievers it's not working in make believers come on church we got a whole tape called the trial and the prophet of God said blind prosecutor he did not promise to be here Amen in the form that you're looking for amen but according to the word he promised to be here in the form of a prophetic message and there's 900 and some denominations tonight amen they're looking for him they're trying to find him amen but God has so set it up amen that when the prophet would begin to sound there would be a bride on the Earth that would receive the message amen as the king's message she would receive it as a Divine message and then that message would begin to effectually worketh in you I want to say it the message is working in my hands amen the message is working in my feet the message is working in my heart it's working in my soul it's working all over me because I have not received it as the word of a man I've received it as the word of God we must receive and believe we must receive and believe the message of the hour at the same degree or level it was delivered in can I make a statement to you this message was not delivered casually no sir this message was not delivered luk horm no sir this message was not delivered half-heartedly no sir it was delivered with passion yes sir it was delivered with fervency that's right it was delivered with Authority it was delivered with power it was delivered with supreme authority then you know what I say I say we need to shake off the layot of sinness we need to shake off the lukewarmness we need to shake off all the cares and all the devils and spirits and come back to the message of the hour and stand on the word of God just like Rahab stood can I say this Rahab she received the message those spies came in there remember said those spies came in there and they delivered to her an Urgent Message listen Rahab didn't get an Urgent Message and handle it casually amen Rahab didn't get an Urgent Message and and believe it relaxed amen but the same urgency that it was delivered in was the same urgency she received it in and those spies told Rahab whatever you get underneath this token when the walls of Jericho comes down whatever is underneath that token will not not be destroyed I love what the prophet of God said he said Rahab went to work oh come on church amen Rahab went to work she went to her fathers and her mothers and her brothers and her sisters and she said come on Amen get underneath this token well I want to say this spoken word amen it's time to get up it's time to get to work amen because the night is coming and no man can work in the night but while there is light let us work let us get as many as we can underneath the token of the presence of Jesus Christ in the age we're living in I love what the prophet says he said oh God let us open our hearts and receive the message that Jesus is Alive tonight he is right here Among Us he is the same yesterday today and forever open up your house and let the messenger the Holy Ghost come in and identify You by his own presence come on church I'm not talking about a church identifying you I'm not talking about a preacher identifying you I'm talking about you opening up your heart opening up your house and letting the presence of this message more than a book more than a tape more than a picture but the person of the word Jesus Christ himself step into your home and identify his presence by the token on display come in and identify You by his own presence the token that's upon you I love what he says then you don't have to take anybody else's word for it he is there to speak for himself and he is the word when you receive the token when you receive the life of Jesus Christ and come underneath the identification of his presence then nobody else has to speak for you nobody else has to testify for you nobody else has to do your singing nobody else has to do your preaching nobody else has to do your praising nobody else has to do your pray they say Preacher what's wrong with you I tell you what's wrong with me is I opened up my heart and I let the person of this message step in there and I said you are the truth and you're nothing but the truth you are the absolute truth and we'll serve the word in the face of every difficulty that's right it's God's token to identify himself can I say this brother Brandon was convinced that the message he was bringing amen was of God and it was from God can you say this with me the message is of God God from God from God of God from God brother said I'm thoroughly convinced that my message comes from God I'm thoroughly convinced it's not my own fleshly mind puffed up it's the word of God I'm thoroughly convinced absolutely convinced that is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I'm thoroughly convinced that he's right here now another place truly friend I believe and with all of my heart with all of my faith I believe that my message amen comes from God another place now that's what we're here for that's my message has been all along in the word of God we must hold on to that amen regardless of what others thinks takes place always stay with that word another place I'm so I love this one I'm so thankful he says to have a people like you all what would my message be if I had nobody that believed it and there is people here you would die for it it's the message we got may you not forget that you're a part in that Resurrection amen the quickening power is now in you it's all settled you are God's child well I don't have time to preach there all night but I want to amen the Capstone of his revelation of his message was to announce to you you have a part in the resurrection amen quickening power is not coming it's already in you and then he says it is settled well I want to say this tonight it's settled in the heavens it's settled on the earth can I say this the word of God is settled in heaven it's settled on the earth amen don't get scared at me amen it's it's even settled in Hell the devils in Hell believe this word can I say this it's settled in heaven it's settled on the earth it's settled in hell but greater than all those places it is settled in my heart I am a part of the Resurrection I am a part of the quickening power of Jesus Christ ain't no devil can take me out cuz or what no devil put me in ain't no devil can discourage me I know who I am I know who my daddy is I am God's child hallelujah hallelujah amen when God speaks I love this when God speaks brother says when God speaks to a man he gives that man three things now according to Hebrews 1 he still speaks Hebrews 1:1 says God to at sundried times and Di's manner spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets but half in these last days I'm going somewhere half in these last days spoken unto us by his son come on Church the same one who was in Pilot Hall is speaking here tonight the same one that pilot looked at and said what is truth has come right here in Gastonia North Carolina in spoken word Tabernacle listen he's not here in the form of a of a bloody robe or crown head or nail prints in his hand he's here in the form of his word can I say this to you this is not just a service come on church when are you going to realize these are not just Services these are not just get togethers on Sunday morning and Wednesday night these are opportunities these are opportunities that have come from the message of the Hour come on Amen there's all kinds of churches trying to get what you got yes sir sir they're building buildings they're buying buses they're starting programs they're doing all kinds of things to get people in church and you know what they're going to stand fa to face with a Creed or a Dogma or a tradition or a denomination but God who is rich in Mercy has raised up this church out of nothing amen and made it something for his glory I say spoken word Tabernacle let the anointing oil of the Holy Ghost come over you again and realize these are more than just Services their opportunities hallelujah amen how can our sister Lily amen get up here and testify about a midweek service amen and God spoke directly to her you know why because it's more than a service it's more than a preacher it's more than a get together it's the Son of God has come down in this generation and he is speaking now I'm just gonna say it that word spoken can I say this the word spoken means to use words in order to declare one's mind and disclose one's thoughts oh God the word spoken means to use words to declare one's thoughts and to disclose one's mind come on church amen our sister was thinking it our sister was thinking about it she was was pondering on it she was thinking about it in her heart amen but God got a hold of a preacher and by that word he disclos what was in her mind he disclosed what was in are y'all hearing me you come in these services on Sunday morning and you got thoughts and you got situations and God takes your pastor to the pull pit and he begins to preach that's not just a sermon it's the message of the hour it's an opportunity that God has arranged a set of circumstances God has set it up but he's done it on purpose he wants to talk to you he wants to speak to you now when God speaks to a man brother when God speaks to a man he gives him a purpose he gives him ambition and he gives him Faith to do it or to accomplish or to achieve what his purpose in life is what God called him to do so God doesn't call you to do something and say now go find the means to do it by but if God calls you to do something he supplies you what you need to do it with in other words the prophet of God said he has called us to be in the Church of God so we're not just here trying to find a purpose trying to find ambition trying to find Faith but the message that called us has revealed to us our purpose it has imparted to us ambition and has anointed our faith to accomplish the word that's been spoken over our lives can I say this the spoken word hey this just come in the room I'm going to preach it amen the spoken word it gives purpose it gives ambition and it gives faith can I say this amen I remember just a few years ago amen when some of you all were looking for purpose you were looking for come on Amen door closed in your face got to find a church got to find somewhere to worship got to find somewhere to believe amen but look how far God has brought you come on church God don't need you to figure it out he just needs somebody to believe what he has sent come on Amen can I tell you why you got a beautiful building it's because you believe the message can I tell you why God has G you a solid Pastor is because you believe the message can I tell you why you got all these musicians is because you believe the message anybody that sets out to believe what God has sent God will back them up can I say this God is behind spoken word Tabernacle God is behind Steven Sango God is behind every Holy Ghost Field believer he presented to you a message and when others turned it down and when others walked away there was somebody that said it's the truth it's the truth I don't understand everything but it's the truth I can't figure everything out but it's the truth I can't answer all your false questions but the message of the hour is the truth yes [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah can

1837 pilate said to him you are a King Jesus answered you say correctly that I am a king this is why I was born look at this word born it is of me who father children to be born to be begotten of of

brother Steven got up and said I can biblically answer how to get out of debt I said praise God Almighty there's a message preacher that ain't int introducing Dave Ramsey to fix homes come on church we don't belong to Dave Ramsey and neither do we belong to James Dobson and neither do we belong to TD Jakes and neither do we belong to Joel ostein We Belong to truth we preach the truth we correct by the truth we speak the truth we are the children of [Applause] Truth what is truth John 1:14 the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth brother brandham said pilot had the opportunity and he should have repented come on now any anybody here ever had to repent you know what you three of you anybody ever had to repent you know what you found in the repentance you found Grace and you found truth and here is the person the person of Grace the person of Truth is standing in Pilot's presence and he says do a trick for me Jesus saith unto him John 14:6 I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me look at this word truth it is what is true in any matter under consideration can I say this put any Doctrine in this Bible under consideration and lay over it what William brandham taught about it and you'll say the truth take the Bible take the subject and lay a prophet's teaching over it and it's the truth you say now brother Andrew I feel that devil pushing at me but you got the wrong guy you say well now brother Andrew you're putting the message above the Bible I'm putting the message where it belongs brother BR said it's the word of [Applause] God come on church we might as well preach we're here can I just say this either believe the message or go somewhere [Applause] [Music] else come to a complete identification or go be a good Baptist come on church I'm going to say it or I'm going bust okay we should not still be asking questions like amen is it okay to quote a prophet is it okay to say what a prophet said we belong to truth you know what every Democrat in this County wants the county to know they're a Democrat so you know what they do they go put a they go put a Democrat candid presidential candidate signed in their front yard to identify can I can I just can I can I just break it down amen if you drive by somebody's house and there's a sign there that says reelect Joe Biden you're crazy to walk to the door and say are you voting for Donald Trump come on Church you had to walk by the sign that identifies who they're voting for and it's just as crazy to go go to a person's got a got a trump sign and go to their door and say Excuse me sir are you voting for Biden the sign identifies whose side they're on now I might as well preach I'm feeling good I'm feeling good you know what I think I think we ought to F our libraries back up with message material I think we ought to put the pictures back on the wall we ought to put the cloaks back on the wall come on church and you know what I think we ought to make it oh God I'm going to get in trouble I think we ought to make it plumb embarass for a preacher to have to walk by all kinds of message identifications and walk up to a pull pit and say is it okay to quote a prophet did you not see the pictures on the wall did you not see the books in in the office what are you saying preacher I'm saying this is the Battle of truth and somebody's going to rise and sharpen their sword and fight back against every devil that's trying to rob them of their identification in the [Applause] truth the people of God are of the truth they are a friend of the truth and belong to the truth brother them said an angel of God will take testify to the truth of God that's right and it will declare God it won't have some kind of mythical something and no one understands are you ready for this it'll speak of Jesus Christ and testify of Jesus Christ and produce Jesus Christ to the people see because Jesus was born of the will of God to save man now watch this and Satan tried to defeat that purpose through pilot by the Judgment he passed on the case of Jesus Christ brother said what should I do with this Jesus called Christ can can I take a minute and read this I hate to slow down but I want to lay this in here it was a time of the crucifixion of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he had done nothing as they could find in him he answered everything it was just the hour it had to be that way and it's a reason this had to happen to the greatest man ever lived on the earth or ever could live the reason it happened this way because it was time for it to happen see it must be thus and there was no way to escape it and Jesus had come to the Earth just exactly the way that God's word had predicted he would come he did just exactly what word said he would do he lived the life just exactly and God made known or manifested the seed of that time so God's purpose in sending Jesus was for the purpose of bringing out of bringing reality into the church go go to your tape uh total Deliverance I believe it is brother B says it like this he says now God's purpose or or excuse meemer kinsman redeemer God uh unfailing realities of living God he he hits it in there as well he says it like this he says the Christianity was looking for something to deliver them he said and here stands the god of reality now watch this can I say this brother brandham identified our purpose of being born and here's what he said Rec presence of God and recognize 64 we are born to believe the word of God we are born to believe Jesus Christ we were born to believe the message see there's something in you and what's in you identifies it's [Applause] real God have mercy there was a seed in you that when you heard the message come on some of y'all know what I'm talking about the very minute you heard this word something in you said it's real come on amen amen some of you women had earrings in your ears you had pain on your face some of you men were still drinking and smoking but when you heard the eagle scream when you heard the presentation of Truth there was something in you that said that's the truth come on Church you didn't Cliff the cigarettes the cigarettes quit you you didn't quit the makeup the makeup quit you because the seed that was on the inside of you had just Arisen the headship over your life and anything contrary to the headship had to [Applause] go so I got a question if it's coming back does that mean we've changed headships come on church if makeup and high heel shoes are coming back in the churches and skin tight dresses and boys wearing skinny jeans and dressing like sissies is coming back in the church Church we've changed headship somewhere but I say get back to the headship that clicking the seed in your soul and caus them little immoral things to just kindly drop off come on I'm gonna say it the house of God is not a New York Fashion [Applause] Show come on Church come on I said the house of God is not a New York Fashion Show it's a house of God I'm going get in trouble but I'm going to preach anyhow somebody somebody said the other day they said well they said I would praise God but the but what I'm wearing is a little too tight I thought you mean to tell me that you're going to let leoty and fashion Rob God of his praise you know what I say Amen if you can't pra God and what you're wearing you need to find something [Applause] else well it's culture I don't care about your culture we are not of this world we have come from truth we belong to truth we are a friend of Truth and we stand on the infallible absolute truth what do you saying my brother take your time I'm saying and brother Braham identified the message of the hour and said it is Christ okay now I love what Els he says he said I have to stay under the anointing of the Holy Spirit to find out what the message of the hour is so we now have a Vindicated identific identified definition of what the message of the hour is and it came out from under the anointing and the Bible say the Yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing here he says the message of the hour is truly you have risen from the dead another place the message of the hour is to repent and turn back again to the faith of the father pilate should have repented he was in the presence of grace and truth but he refused to repent another place the message of the hour is a sign of the churches it's a ass sign the people are you ready for this one the message of the hour is return back to the word those definitions did not come out of the commentary they came out from under the anointing can I say this one it's a direct quote we're not come together to talk about the message we are come together to get in the message and the message is Christ he is the word that's right we are to get into it and get beneath it yes sir that's what we are supposed to do so what is faith faith is a revelation of the will of God in other words it's real Revelation and the real Revelation is God keeps his word can I say this the Rapture I'm I'm I'm I I don't have time to go into all the opportun ities but I'm going to I'm going to pull this one for you tonight okay the Rapture is a revelation can I say this the message of the hour is the opportunity for Rapture the message of the Hour come on Church it is Jesus Christ has risen from the dead the message of the hour is a sign of the churches it's a sign of the people amen the message of the hour is repent and turn back to the faith of the fathers the me message of the hour is stay with the word of God and the message of the hour is the opportunity to take a Rapture what are you saying I'm saying the prophet of God said the bride of Christ will be waiting for the revelation of the Rapture I I want to I want to lay a few things in here in closing say this with me rapturing Faith raping faith and rapturing grace and rapturing grace not not rapturing works work [Applause] rapturing faith and rapturing Grace not rapturing works for by grace are ye saved through faith and what is Faith it's a revelation of the will of God so by the grace of God the message of the hour has revealed the will of God and the will of God for your life is to change your body some morning between 6:00 and 9 in

through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God can I tell you this I truly believe brother B says this before the church can have the Rapture it's got to have rapturing faith before the church can have the Rapture it's got to have rapturing faith right there can I say this what God requires God must provide come on come on Elisha you got to wear the Garment come on God will

amen amen amen amen amen I'm talking to people who will not see a grave the door to the Rapture amen the opportunity has been presented amen glory to God but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel yes sir when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as Heath declared to his servants the prophets amen amen amen can I say this say it when he shall begin to sound uhhuh yes remember he has spoken these last days amen spoken means to disclose amen with words amen what is in one's mind uh when he shall begin to sound uhh or when he shall begin to present by speaking amen amen who dare say that wasn't the inspired word of God direct quote when it foretold it here and sent out y to Arizona and brought it right back even with science and everything else and proved it so this book is already ready opened amen that's right amen just waiting for the the seventh seal to be identified of the coming of Christ another surge of the Holy Ghost right Spirit that's it into the church that's it for a rapturing faith that's it just before it comes amen everything amen is sitting straight in order for that that's exactly right I believe we're now the time that the wor should have preeminence amen I believe that the time to lay aside our Creeds our thoughts and come back to the word yes sir the third pull the thing that will start the rapure EXA right for the going away amen can I say this yes my brother the third pull yes sir puts the Rapture Amen in process that's exactly right will you stand to your feet with us tonight [Applause] in countdown 1964 don't don't miss it friend remember yes sir listen at my voice for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice voice so there's a connection between the voice of the seventh angel and the truth and the truth don't don't miss it friend remember listen at my voice it'll haunt you all your life if you haven't got in amen we're not come together to talk about the message we're come together to get in the message beneath it out yonder when you're suffering for your punishment and we're weeping and Welling and nashing of teeth that voice will scream back and forth you'll hear it all the time in that weary spooky place of hell don't fail direct quote now is your opportunity amen now look I've said some pretty rough things about airplane automobile remember they are horsepower too they're all horsepower but the church is just moving up holy ghost power it's the Holy Ghost we're justified by it's the Holy Ghost sanctifies us right it's the Holy Ghost fills us it's the holy ghost that gives us rapturing faith and the only hope for the church is to get direct quote get away from these manmade the Oles and get back to the Holy Spirit and get the spirit back in the church and get the church straightened out that's it that's it see and and and I'm just saying this it'll take a profit to straighten the church out any man that stands up and says I'm going to straighten out something in this message and then goes to his own interpretation of quotes and his own ideas that man is not saying what a prophet said amen R Stephen I caught something you've probably seen it but it it just it's it's it's astounding to me it'll take a profit to straighten it out see the only hope for the church is the coming of the Lord amen you know this you know this is an age where people actually say things like well that was just brother bram's opinion or actually not you know brother Stephen I've actually and I hate to even say this but I I've actually had preachers that claim to believe this message and they've said these words to me well that Cloud's really irrelevant it's really irrelevant they'll say things like it it really don't matter if it was there or not it really M it matters a lot but here's what I say a prophet of God writes the church age book remember he sends it to Lil to grammar eyesee it right right he sends an audio letter to leil remember and in that audio letter in the second paragraph here's what he says speaking about what's in the church age book he says in order to Proclaim this somebody say proclaima has to send a prophet in order to inject this to make this real again so somewhere it was real and something killed it but God would send a prophet in restoration to make it real again to show the people the hour we're living in because if they only see it in the hour past there's no hope for the church that's right the church must see it in the present tense so God sends his Prophet to manifest present tense of it amen John saw it Daniel wrote about it prophet of God walked to it and manifested it and said now there's your reality it's our Lord up [Applause] there but it took a prophet to go to Revelation 10:1 and bring it before the church and present you an opportunity for truth you love him tonight what are you saying brother Ander I'm saying opportunity yes sir has been presented by the message of the hour I I'll come back opportunity sir has been presented it's here it's before you brother brother Steven I want thank you thank you for the opportunity to come and to declare the message of the hour can I say this to you tonight sir Judas s the Bible says this Judas sought opportunity to betray him brother kma Judas literally put all his efforts in finding a way to betray truth he he literally sat down and got on YouTube [Music] and went to libraries and went to went to lawyers and went to congressmen and tried to find a way you say preacher you're getting way out there no I got a prophet's word for what I'm saying amen we're in another pilot Hall that's exactly right go look for quote up you know what he called it he called it pilot scheme you know what pilot scheme is brother said I want to give you three ways to identify it he said here it is he passes it off to another so what's the first thing they say what's the first thing they say well you know I've I've got some questions with the message okay present them to you well brother so and so made a YouTube video no there no no you said you had issues come on pilot don't push it [Applause] off be a man you want to be a man be a man and stand behind your questions quit pushing them off to this guy and pushing off that guy that's their problem come on if you want me to believe something be convinced of it yourself don't hand me a YouTube video to go look at be convinced of it yourself but you know what I'll say this I'm convinced of that cloud I don't have to send you to a YouTube video I don't have to send you to a reporter I can stand before you tonight and say that's Revelation 10 I love has descended in this generation and presented you with an opportunity glory to God sister Anna he fixed it he set it up where you as a young girl could see him and receive an opportunity Zach he set it up he fixed it in his economy where you could see it glory to God now you know what I'm not Judas I'm not seeking opportunities to betray it I'm seeking opportunities to testify to it I'm looking for opportunities to lift it up somebody said brother Andrew you need to slow down you're just a you're just a wild crazy preacher I don't have time to slow down I've got a message and it's the message of the seventh angel and every pull pit I get I'm going to lift it up I'm going to raise it up and say you want a Revival Look Away to Jesus you want a healing look away to Jesus you want to take a Rapture Look Away to the anointed word it's been presented yes my brother Hallelujah glory to God come on brother Steven God bless you tonight [Applause] friend hallelujah amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen in the time and the hour that we living in if you a coward you're not going to preach this message correctly do you hear my microphone good or should I change my microphone should I change my microphone do you hear me good do you hear me do you hear me good you don't understand why we get here and we get bold it is not us the Bible spoke about the disciple they got bold if you a coward in the hour that we are living in now you're not going to preach this message correctly let me repeat it again because there is a great cost now to preach the message then back then I'm free I don't have a bishop so I'm free you can take the step and push it wherever you want I'm free amen amen it is very difficult to preach the message now than back then back then everybody seems to believe the message over the time people begin to show their colors shama still hanging to the message but they don't believe it they don't want you to talk about the cloud they don't want you to get they don't even want to get deep into the word because the deeper you get into the word he unfold a different anointing that separate you from Pentecostal people want to preach this message like Baptist that's the truth and every time you want to stand on the line to preach this message it is very hard to preach it without bumping against the click because denomination has been created over the year but the time has come where we don't fear nothing we don't fear anything if the Bible said it and brother brandham said I will declare it without any question because the children of God must be free somebody must be set free somebody must know what is the truth somebody need to know what did Brother Bram say about this about this about this about this we need to know the message we can't play Church no more you want to say something you afraid you want to say something you afraid you afraid but somebody's bound right there do you think God is speaking this just like that whoever is playing around on the internet with the message you need to get off if you have a friend who keep sending you YouTube video and trying to convince you and to lure you away from this message you need to cut them off God is giving you a [Music] warning I asked somebody a question a preacher and I told him I say find me one right ET one rocket you can even go to Russia he have plenty of rocket go go get him to shoot rocket and find me one picture that will match this picture that will match the head of us man you will run out of all the rocket in the world none of them will be come out like this and this came out looking exactly like the head of Offman and brother brandham predicted a long time ago he said go get the lamb AB look on top of the Lamb Saab and you will see the Hebrew sign of the fire I showed you that before if you look at the Hebrew s exactly the so something that matches the Hebrew fire that was put by Dr lamama something that matches the picture of of man that was not painted by brother brandham and you still have a hard time believing that so what else can we give you by whom who is off the truth believe this thing in this church we put pictures wide identification there from the from the parking lot a big eagle looking at you telling you this is the home of the eagle from a parking lot they tells you that this is the home of an eego if you don't want it you go somewhere else but not in this church this one was raised to stand for the message and we will stand for the message of the God have given you opportunity to change your life you go to the Book of Daniel the Bible says this mystery will purify you this mystery God Gave You opportunity to change your life to correct your life to to to prepare your marriage to prepare your family to prepare your children to prepare you for the uncoming of the Messiah so we can meet him into the air what opportunity what else do you want where should we go again amen and you notice brother Bram say get in the message and he said get beneath meaning we have to be under Authority you you have to in other word the message must be on top when you in the message then the message get above of you in other word whatever William Marion Bram said you are under it because it's not the word of a man it is the word of God through a man that's why we don't argue with coat because we know it's a Vindicated message get beneath it if the message say something no matter how you love it take it off if you find an inspiration it's different than what brother Bram say please be humble enough take it way because after two years you found out brother brandham was right and you were wrong but if you ever humble yourself you will see the Holy Spirit coming W and say look at this look in the scripture here because you gave the prophet his correct Place amen if you don't God will lock it and give you argument and you will get a spirit of delusion to believe a lie and you're going to believe whatever is out there we thank God for the message of the hour amen I'm not ashamed of the message of the hour I'm not ashamed of the name of brother Bram I'm not ashamed to be identified with this picture and all the picture that I have I'm not ashamed this is my life amen amen Jehovah Witness would know we will make sure you know the Jehovah Witness amen a Catholic make sure you know some of them will even dress in Santa and everything to show you that this is what they believe and if they can do that what about me why should I be ashamed to pray before you amen amen God gave us great opportunity let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we approaching you again humbly tonight father once again we thank you for enlightening and refreshening in this church the importance of this message to us Lord father you have given us opportunity Beyond even what the brother preached because he mentioned that he cannot go through all opportunity that you disclose unto him Lord but the Holy Spirit father will continue to work to un to Lord father continue to teach and to prove to us more
