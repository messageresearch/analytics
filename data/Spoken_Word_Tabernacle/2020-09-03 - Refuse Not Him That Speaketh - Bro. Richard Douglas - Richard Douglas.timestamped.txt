[13:44] verse 22
[13:46] it says come ye
[13:49] but ye let's see let's start but ye are
[13:52] come
[13:52] unto mount zion and unto the city of the
[13:56] living god
[13:58] the heavenly jerusalem
[14:01] and into an innumerable company of
[14:03] angels
[14:04] to the general assembly the church of
[14:06] the firstborn
[14:08] which are written in heaven to god the
[14:11] judge of all
[14:13] and to the spirits of just men made
[14:15] perfect
[14:16] and to jesus the mediator of the new
[14:19] covenant
[14:21] and the blood of the sprinkling that
[14:23] sprinkles better things
[14:25] than that of abel see that ye refuse not
[14:29] him that speaketh
[14:30] for if they escape not who refuse him
[14:33] that spake on earth
[14:35] much more shall not we escape if we turn
[14:38] away from him that speaketh from heaven
[14:42] whose voice then shook the earth but now
[14:45] he hath promised saying yet once more
[14:48] i shake not earth only but also heaven
[14:52] and this word yet once more signify the
[14:55] removing of things that are
[14:57] shaken as of things that are made
[15:00] those things which cannot be shaken may
[15:03] remain
[15:06] wherefore we receiving a kingdom which
[15:09] cannot be moved let us have grace
[15:13] whereby we may serve god acceptably with
[15:16] reverence and godly fear

[15:40] realized lord that a man can do nothing

[15:46] i'm completely trusting in you that you

[16:10] you receive all honor and glory in this
[16:11] service for we ask it in jesus christ's
[16:13] name
[16:14] amen and amen you may be seated i want
[16:17] to speak tonight on a subject
[16:19] refuse not him that speaketh
[16:22] you know when we hear there's a it seems
[16:24] to be that there's a spirit that's come
[16:26] upon this age in this hour
[16:28] that everybody is in a in a in a
[16:31] in under a spirit where they refuse
[16:34] everything they refuse headship
[16:36] they refuse any kind of laws they they
[16:39] begin to refuse
[16:40] even the preaching of the gospel they
[16:42] they're just it's just under a
[16:44] spirit of this ages is what it the
[16:46] spirit is is
[16:47] it's a resenting spirit and uh the
[16:50] prophet of god taught us that he taught
[16:52] us and warned us about the
[16:53] the spirit that was that was coming upon
[16:55] this age and
[16:56] you know if you don't watch it you hear
[16:58] some if you don't if you listen to too
[17:00] much media which i believe
[17:01] sometimes you know we we are in this
[17:04] world and you know
[17:05] things begin to happen and that we hear
[17:08] say it and
[17:09] we hear talk but we know that we're not
[17:10] part of this world you know
[17:12] this is this is not this is a this this
[17:15] is not our home this is not my kingdom
[17:17] this is not where i i am this is not my
[17:19] dwelling place
[17:20] but you know we want to uh i want to
[17:23] speak tonight about being just being
[17:24] guarding ourselves from the spirit of
[17:26] this age you know
[17:27] you know the spirit has come upon us to
[17:29] resent
[17:30] this this race against that race and
[17:33] this that but
[17:34] you know what when we become christians
[17:36] we we
[17:37] we don't have that resentment because
[17:38] we're we're not looking at race
[17:40] we're looking at the children of the
[17:42] living god and he he said in his word
[17:44] that they'd be
[17:45] uh he out of every kindred tongue and
[17:47] nation he'd bring forth a people
[17:49] and that's to believe that's what he's
[17:50] done i believe he's he's bringing a
[17:52] brother
[17:53] a bouquet of flowers a variety of of his
[17:56] children
[17:56] and if we don't watch it we'll get
[17:58] caught up in that thing and you know
[17:59] what we'll start resenting
[18:01] one another we'll start to get into the
[18:03] place where we resent
[18:04] this and this one and the that one and
[18:07] we get on that spirit we have to watch
[18:09] those things because
[18:10] that spirit is trying to overpower us
[18:13] it's trying to creep in
[18:14] to the house of god and let me tell you
[18:16] there has no place
[18:18] in the house of god oh i'm thankful for
[18:21] the power of god he has given us the
[18:23] power
[18:23] to love one another even love those who
[18:26] despitefully use us
[18:27] to bless those who curse us but you know
[18:29] in such a such a resentful age
[18:32] everybody talk about their rights we got
[18:34] this right and we got that right
[18:36] but i'm glad that there was a prophet
[18:37] coming this hour and told him that we
[18:39] are
[18:40] prisoners of jesus christ we have
[18:42] forfeited our rights
[18:44] we don't have no right we are his
[18:46] prisoners
[18:47] a prisoner don't have a right to do what
[18:49] he do what he wants to
[18:51] say where he wants to act the way he
[18:53] wants to but under the holy spirit
[18:55] when the holy spirit has come upon a
[18:57] man's heart
[18:58] and you become a complete prisoner to
[19:00] him then you know you're not your own
[19:03] tonight we must remember that we're not
[19:05] our own we've been bought with the price
[19:07] the precious price of jesus christ the
[19:10] blood that he shed for us
[19:12] we should not allow those things we are
[19:14] brothers and sisters in christ
[19:16] jesus and you know what it's even
[19:18] creeped into we
[19:19] we give it such a resentment to a
[19:21] certain preacher
[19:22] or a certain personality if he don't
[19:25] come
[19:26] we resent and we don't realize that we
[19:28] can be resenting
[19:29] the holy spirit
[19:32] we've not come to hear from a certain
[19:34] personality we've not come to hear from
[19:36] certain men we've come to hear
[19:38] what god would say to us we have a
[19:40] design the desire of the christians to
[19:43] hear from god
[19:44] we come to the house of god to be washed
[19:46] by the water of the word
[19:48] and he might cleanse us from all these
[19:50] things these things we've been
[19:52] rubbed up against all these these when
[19:54] we work and where we go to certain
[19:56] places
[19:56] going to the into the markets and
[19:58] different the department stores are
[20:00] spirits
[20:01] that try to get on us and what we must
[20:04] realize there's two spirits in this
[20:06] hour we know these things are simple to
[20:08] you but we know we got to
[20:09] always remember those things and be
[20:11] prayed up no matter where we go
[20:14] because we we shouldn't resent anyone
[20:16] the one we should resist is the devil
[20:18] my bible tells me resist the devil and
[20:21] he shall flee
[20:22] that's who i'm against i'm not against
[20:25] flesh and blood
[20:26] i'm not against people i'm against the
[20:28] spirit of
[20:29] satan in this hour there's cause to
[20:32] probably bring forth
[20:33] this unity among the brother
[20:36] it doesn't matter what church we go to
[20:39] it matters who we
[20:40] serve we're sitting under the headship
[20:43] of the lord we're to be thankful for
[20:45] for the pastors that stand for the word
[20:47] of god in this south
[20:48] thank god for men of god thank god for
[20:50] brother stephen i'm not here to
[20:52] to build up brother see what i'm here
[20:54] i'm here saying thank him
[20:56] i'm thankful that he is he is doing what
[20:58] he's doing
[21:00] a lot of people are not doing that no
[21:01] more a lot of people are preaching a
[21:04] social gospel
[21:05] i feel good that's not what we're here
[21:09] hey uh you know what makes me feel good
[21:12] when i hear the word of
[21:15] you know what god my soul is the truth
[21:18] you know what set me free is the truth
[21:22] and i'm so thankful for the power of god
[21:23] in this eye
[21:25] paul warns us this he warns us that we
[21:28] must be careful
[21:30] that we don't refuse him that speaketh
[21:34] you know that the voice of god is still
[21:35] speaking in this day
[21:37] it didn't die when brother branham left
[21:39] he said the spirit and the bride are
[21:41] saying the same thing
[21:43] it said come then the ministry will be
[21:46] saying the same thing
[21:48] they ought to be warning of this these
[21:50] things that's going on
[21:52] we're going to be in such unity reverend
[21:54] said when a man gets involved we don't
[21:56] try to take the ball from him what we
[21:59] try to do is we block for him
[22:01] that he might that he might reach the
[22:03] goal that god has ordained for him to
[22:05] reach
[22:07] we're supposed to love one another
[22:11] just because we don't agree with
[22:13] everything
[22:14] don't mean we shouldn't love one another
[22:16] but you know what god we i tell you one
[22:18] thing we better agree with
[22:20] that's the word of god
[22:25] you know what a lot of people you know
[22:28] we we're not here
[22:29] tonight you know and we're not standing
[22:31] around the holy mountain
[22:33] that that that the where the fire was
[22:36] and
[22:37] that fiery mountain that that moses come
[22:40] before
[22:41] and went up into that mountain and
[22:42] received the word of god
[22:44] but you know what that fear that god had
[22:47] on the people
[22:48] was respect for the for the presence of
[22:51] almighty god
[22:52] and there was such a presence upon god's
[22:55] servant moses
[22:56] that he had to wear a veil when he come
[22:58] down and you know what i believe that's
[23:00] what's happened in this hour
[23:03] in a lot of places that it's lost people
[23:05] have lost a respect for the word of god
[23:08] loss of respect for the ministry
[23:12] and we ought to be the lovers of truth
[23:15] we'll be the lovers of this
[23:16] i'll tell you what this message has done
[23:18] for me can i just preach tonight brother
[23:19] statement
[23:20] can i just let god have his way amen you
[23:23] know what
[23:23] i believe there's such a a spirit of
[23:26] refusal
[23:26] because people get in their mind this is
[23:28] the way i think it ought to be
[23:30] this is the way the the prophet man this
[23:32] is the way but you know what god
[23:34] said refuse not him to speak it he
[23:36] didn't bring me and you to interpret the
[23:38] word
[23:38] he sent a man that he'd give the
[23:40] interpretation to
[23:41] that me and you right receive what god
[23:44] has for us in this hour
[23:45] and he made it so simple for us he made
[23:49] it so plain that we would not stumble
[23:51] and we would not fall at it and he bring
[23:53] it and he give us
[23:54] eyes to see ears to hear and a heart to
[23:58] receive
[24:00] you ought to be so thankful for that
[24:01] tonight that god has given us a heart to
[24:04] receive the word of god
[24:08] it's how oh i'm so i can't
[24:12] i tell you i can't tell you how excited
[24:13] i am i'm excited that
[24:15] the word has come to me in this hour
[24:19] and has brought me to such a love affair
[24:21] with jesus christ
[24:23] jesus even told us he said if you if he
[24:26] said you'll know that you're my
[24:27] disciples that you have loved one for
[24:30] another
[24:32] that that's the key to it all if we
[24:34] can't
[24:35] i tell you paul said if we can't how can
[24:37] we love one we haven't seen if we can't
[24:39] love one another
[24:42] i i'm so thankful that god's given me
[24:45] that
[24:46] even when you don't see one another
[24:48] there's still ought to be a love in your
[24:49] heart
[24:50] there'll sort of be a thanksgiving for
[24:52] that there's still ought to be a hunger
[24:54] you know it excites me so much to see my
[24:57] brothers and sisters in christ
[25:00] i mean i can never express it with words
[25:03] how special you are
[25:05] how special the bride of jesus christ is
[25:07] she's an elect lady she's a very special
[25:09] lady
[25:11] but moses but paul is warning us to
[25:14] refuse not
[25:16] be careful your attitude toward the word
[25:18] of god
[25:19] brother branham said you know you can't
[25:21] even receive the holy spirit i believe
[25:22] that's what the
[25:23] what the problem is in this hour as many
[25:25] as says they
[25:26] they've received the holy spirit and
[25:27] have not
[25:30] because if you receive the holy spirit
[25:32] you'll receive the word
[25:35] because the holy spirit testifies of the
[25:37] word
[25:38] [Music]
[25:41] it shows that the word of god is living
[25:42] in us james told us in chapter
[25:45] 4 verse 7 he says submit yourselves
[25:47] therefore to god
[25:51] we ought to examine ourselves tonight
[25:53] and say lord have i
[25:54] have i submitted myself therefore to you
[25:58] if you're submitted yourself to him then
[26:01] you have the ability
[26:03] to resist the devil if you
[26:06] and then he'll flee people think well i
[26:10] i'll just i'll just i won't be bothered
[26:13] with it
[26:13] you have to resist those spirits you
[26:16] have to cast down those imaginations
[26:19] you have to bring every thought under
[26:20] the obedience of jesus christ
[26:23] and the message hear ye him he said if
[26:26] you wrote a letter
[26:28] you would perhaps appreciate that letter
[26:30] and if you wrote it
[26:32] to me i'm sure i would appreciate it
[26:36] but my letter would just be to you and
[26:38] therefore
[26:39] after you read it once you know all the
[26:43] meaning
[26:44] and the letter would be insufficient
[26:46] anymore to anybody else because it was
[26:48] destinated
[26:49] to you or to yours
[26:53] or to me but it's not so with god's
[26:56] eternal word
[26:57] it's inspired therefore it's to all
[27:00] people
[27:01] all ages to meet all conditions that's
[27:04] what makes
[27:05] that's what makes it worth repeating
[27:08] itself he says as history swings around
[27:10] it swings with history
[27:12] and it never loses its value
[27:16] i want to challenge you tonight has this
[27:18] message lost his value
[27:20] to you i tell you what has made
[27:23] me more appreciative than i've ever been
[27:25] in my life
[27:27] it's made me more thankful than i've
[27:29] ever been
[27:31] i'm so appreciative of what god has
[27:33] given to us in this hour
[27:36] oh where is your value at tonight
[27:42] is your is your value upon the things of
[27:45] the world are getting a new house or a
[27:46] new car or this
[27:51] we order where your heart is that's
[27:54] where your treasure is
[27:56] you know if we're this this is such a
[27:58] treasure to us
[28:01] it's so special to us i know this is
[28:02] simple things but we need to never lose
[28:04] our vision on this thank you brother
[28:06] i appreciate that i'm so thankful it's
[28:10] not lost it's value
[28:11] in an hour when satan's trying to
[28:13] devalue the word to you
[28:16] trying to make you to refuse
[28:20] him that speaketh but i'm glad there's
[28:22] something on the inside that longs to
[28:24] hear him
[28:25] he said my sheep know my voice and a
[28:27] stranger they won't follow
[28:33] it's god's eternal word it's
[28:36] it's expired it's inspired by god
[28:40] he said if it's god's eternal word
[28:42] because it's god's eternal
[28:44] word it never loses its value it cannot
[28:46] lose its value
[28:48] and to the believer it will never lose
[28:49] its value
[28:51] we don't care who tries to disprove it
[28:53] or who disbelieves it we still believe
[28:56] it not here to fight against man i'm not
[28:59] here to
[29:00] say it what i'm here to do is tell you
[29:02] look i'm thankful for what god has given
[29:04] us
[29:06] and the only thing we are resisting the
[29:08] power of satan
[29:11] you overcome him by the word of your
[29:13] testimony in the blood of the lamb
[29:15] in the message here ye him he said a
[29:18] postage stamp
[29:20] was sold for a million dollars you know
[29:23] a little boy had a postage stamp and
[29:25] you know the value of it he didn't know
[29:27] what the value of it was
[29:30] and he took it and he sold it and he got
[29:31] him like five dollars and
[29:33] and then the man that bought the stamp
[29:35] he made more money and then the value of
[29:36] it
[29:37] you know what his father oh i'm sort so
[29:39] thinking but god has not valued me
[29:41] when i first started is that this
[29:43] finished value
[29:44] but sister chanel i'm glad that he
[29:46] invaded me at the end
[29:48] the end of the product the finished work
[29:51] of jesus christ
[29:52] that's what he values me do we realize
[29:57] that that in the eye that we live in
[30:00] there's
[30:00] all kinds of spirits
[30:03] ungodly spirits all kinds of voices
[30:07] all kinds of influences but i'm so glad
[30:10] that this
[30:11] truth has such an influence on me
[30:15] that no man can take it away no man can
[30:18] talk me out of it
[30:20] no man can hold me from loving it no man
[30:23] can change
[30:24] what my heart loves
[30:27] because god changed my heart not my cart
[30:31] for he says as the man thinketh in his
[30:33] heart so is he
[30:35] you know that god has given us so many
[30:37] blessings
[30:38] so many things he's given us even i mean
[30:41] if we don't we
[30:42] we got a reason to be thankful even in
[30:44] the things that's going on right now
[30:46] you know what he said when these things
[30:48] happen look up
[30:50] he didn't say look down he didn't say be
[30:53] discouraged
[30:54] he said look up your redemption draws
[30:57] now
[30:59] i'm glad that we have a sure word of
[31:01] prophecy
[31:03] we can't control what's going on but we
[31:04] know one that is in control
[31:07] and if he don't forget about despair
[31:09] that falls don't think he forgets about
[31:11] you
[31:12] if he hung the stars by the breath of
[31:15] his mouth
[31:16] if he'd done all those things and placed
[31:18] all that in there
[31:20] and it's never moved by his word do you
[31:22] think that the bride that she's the word
[31:23] she received
[31:24] will be movable she's unmovable
[31:29] she's unmovable because this word is
[31:31] sure
[31:33] it's truth but you know what sometimes
[31:36] satan tries to get us to a place
[31:37] where we're so busy so busy we're so
[31:40] busy caught up in
[31:42] media and facebook and all these things
[31:45] and we fail to read our bible and pray
[31:48] that's what we need to do brother braham
[31:50] told us he said if you want to get close
[31:52] to god
[31:53] read your bible and pray
[31:57] you know what you know what you're the
[31:58] one that makes the service go good is
[32:00] your attitude what goes on here
[32:03] your attitude toward what's being said
[32:06] your attitude
[32:07] oh do you know your attitude determines
[32:10] your altitude i want my attitude right
[32:16] when i it's not all about preaching when
[32:18] i come to church i'm expecting god to
[32:20] say something to me
[32:22] i want god to speak to me tonight so
[32:26] when i leave this place i'll be a better
[32:27] christian you either have two choices
[32:30] here tonight
[32:31] you lead better or you leave worse but
[32:34] let me tell you the word of god will
[32:35] make you better
[32:37] because god is able to clean us
[32:40] and wash us by the washington of the
[32:42] word
[32:44] you know what busy is
[32:48] it's being under satan's yoke
[32:52] we get so busy brother mike that we
[32:54] don't have time for this we got this
[32:56] going on and that going
[32:57] and you know what we've got such an easy
[32:58] thing everything's a push button now
[33:01] but it seems like it took more and more
[33:02] of our time
[33:04] we're so caught up in what's going on in
[33:06] the world
[33:08] we're failing to see what god is doing
[33:10] in this hour
[33:11] god is moving oh hallelujah
[33:16] you know there's many ways to refuse him
[33:18] that speaketh
[33:20] let's see it by examination
[33:23] not not hearing not listening
[33:27] to his voice too busy listening to every
[33:30] other voice
[33:34] that's how you you ever you know
[33:36] sometimes you come to church and you get
[33:37] your mind on your problems
[33:39] you got your mind on what's going on
[33:40] this and that but you know what you need
[33:42] to come and say god i'm not
[33:44] they were not my problems those are your
[33:47] problems lord
[33:48] i'm going to cast all my cares on you
[33:51] for he careth for me
[33:53] and you know what he's the problem
[33:54] solver he's the one that keeps us in
[33:57] this hour
[33:59] we need to always have an open heart and
[34:01] an open mind to receive what the spirit
[34:03] is saying to us
[34:05] i've always come to church within trying
[34:07] trying my best to have the right
[34:08] attitude pray that before i get here
[34:11] with a desire to hear what god has for
[34:13] me
[34:14] do you know one word spoken from god can
[34:16] change your situation
[34:19] do you know that god can turn the man
[34:21] and go right down
[34:22] your alley and start ministering to your
[34:25] need
[34:26] god don't need the minister's notes what
[34:29] he needs he needs
[34:31] uh his servant to be yielded to the
[34:33] spirit of god
[34:35] the bible said sons and god sons and
[34:37] daughters of god are laid by the spirit
[34:38] of god
[34:41] oh i've seen god do it so many times
[34:44] i've seen i've been sitting in the
[34:46] previous and the minister be preaching
[34:48] and i needed something that god would
[34:50] speak to me to encourage me and speak to
[34:52] me
[34:52] and give me what i had needed and he'd
[34:54] go right down there come right off of
[34:55] his nose
[34:57] and walk right down there do you realize
[34:59] that there's angels in this place
[35:00] this is not just a this is just not a
[35:03] building
[35:04] that you know when you come the angels
[35:05] come with you for the bible said the
[35:07] angels in camp around those that fear
[35:09] and love god
[35:12] oh hallelujah you know what we should
[35:16] never let anything penetrate our minds
[35:19] let's not have god you know we can't
[35:21] stop him brother mike from
[35:23] flying over our head but we can sure
[35:25] stop him from
[35:26] making a nest we sure we can sure keep
[35:30] them from laying eggs
[35:33] a lot of people sometimes they they come
[35:35] and they be under they come into church
[35:37] and they're so
[35:38] disheartened so beat down and they're
[35:40] that they just can't seem like they can
[35:41] they they live from service to service
[35:44] but let me tell you what if you stay
[35:46] under the blood
[35:48] if you stay prayed up you'll get a bonus
[35:51] every time you come to church and every
[35:52] day i want a refilling of jesus
[35:56] i'm not satisfied with what i received
[35:58] yesterday
[35:59] i want more today
[36:02] but you know what a lot of people live
[36:03] on what they received
[36:05] the days before but we know what we've
[36:08] got a word we need now
[36:10] we need god to speak to us directly that
[36:13] we might leave
[36:15] the way he wants us to leave
[36:18] you know what we got to have a hunger
[36:20] for the truth
[36:21] you know he said it'd be a famine in
[36:23] this hour
[36:25] not for bread and water sister shanghai
[36:28] but for the hearing
[36:29] of the word you ought to be so thankful
[36:32] tonight blessed are your ears for you
[36:34] here
[36:35] blessing your eyes for your sea blesses
[36:38] your heart for your receive
[36:43] many are seeing and not seeing many are
[36:46] hearing and not hearing
[36:48] because they don't have that that
[36:50] special
[36:51] predestinated seed that special holy
[36:54] spirit that lives in you that can says
[36:55] amen to every word of god
[36:59] listen to this quote brother brown talk
[37:01] about in the false and the only ones at
[37:02] the end time
[37:03] talking about refused not listen to this
[37:06] he said he's the same yesterday today
[37:09] and forever we know that
[37:11] he said denying his word how did they
[37:14] deny
[37:15] jesus in that day who did they deny when
[37:17] they denied jesus
[37:19] the word he said they were religious
[37:24] they talked from their bible but they
[37:26] denied the present day word
[37:28] what are they today same thing anointed
[37:32] preaching the gospel of pentecost but
[37:34] the nine the present present-day promise
[37:36] of the word
[37:37] being vindicated jesus christ the same
[37:40] yesterday
[37:41] today and forever i can say amen with
[37:44] that
[37:46] even stephen run into that every
[37:48] christian is going to run in
[37:50] to things like those in acts 7 51 what
[37:53] did
[37:54] what did stephen tell him he said you
[37:56] stiff-necked
[37:58] uncircumcised their heart and ears you
[38:00] always resist
[38:01] what the holy ghost as your fathers did
[38:05] so do ye well they was happy
[38:09] until they come down and started
[38:10] preaching about the life let me come
[38:12] down and tell them how they was
[38:13] how they was refusing the word of god
[38:16] for their eye
[38:17] they were so happy with the priests
[38:20] kissing the babies and
[38:21] all these things and a happy but when it
[38:24] come down and they had to measure up
[38:26] with the word
[38:27] that's what that's what offended them
[38:29] brother mike
[38:31] i'm so thankful i'm not offended in
[38:33] jesus christ
[38:35] he said if you'll be you're offended in
[38:37] me in my words i'll be offended in you
[38:38] before
[38:39] my father let's turn to romans chapter
[38:42] 13.
[38:44] you still love the lord amen we sure
[38:47] appreciate you
[38:48] amen how could we not love him one who
[38:51] has given us what he's given us in this
[38:53] hour
[38:55] romans chapter 13
[38:58] amen listen to us
[39:03] paul speaking to us he said let every
[39:06] soul
[39:07] be subject to the higher powers you know
[39:10] what everybody's so worried about the
[39:12] political powers
[39:14] about this when brother brown told us
[39:15] they wouldn't if they put a george
[39:17] washington or abraham lincoln in there
[39:19] it wouldn't change it why because they
[39:22] rejected
[39:23] their message for this hour
[39:26] it ain't going to matter who goes in
[39:29] what we got to do we got to be ready to
[39:30] go up
[39:33] how are you examining yourself and say
[39:35] god am i ready
[39:37] am i prepared am i willing
[39:41] am i looking for your coming i tell you
[39:43] what i don't believe people really
[39:44] looking for his chemicals they don't
[39:45] live like it
[39:51] hey he said you speak well of me with
[39:53] your mouth but your heart's far from me
[39:56] it's more than that brother brown even
[39:57] warned us he said satan don't care how
[39:58] religious you are
[40:02] he said he knows if you miss that life
[40:05] you miss it satan don't care how good
[40:08] you can quote
[40:09] say don't go care how good you can
[40:11] recite the scripture
[40:12] look the seven sons of stephen brother
[40:15] stephen thought that was enough
[40:16] just to know how to how to speak like
[40:19] paul
[40:20] how to use jesus's name but when it
[40:23] comes to a showdown
[40:24] that's where we're at because the bible
[40:25] we just read it where he's shaking
[40:26] everything
[40:28] he's shaking everything you must have
[40:30] that representation in your heart
[40:33] without that representation you're gonna
[40:35] be shaken off
[40:38] he said those things that will remain
[40:40] will be part of him
[40:42] [Music]
[40:44] oh hallelujah oh i'm so thankful for the
[40:47] grace of god
[40:49] he's shaking us he's asking us
[40:52] just like he did peter love us thou me
[40:56] more than these do you love him more
[40:59] than you love the world
[41:01] do you love him more than you love the
[41:03] things that were a lot of people ain't
[41:04] had no problem
[41:05] quit loving the world i don't see how
[41:07] mauricio he could anybody could love the
[41:09] world with all that
[41:10] but he's asked us a question even
[41:11] further than that do you love the things
[41:14] of the world
[41:16] he said if you do you don't even have
[41:18] the love of god anymore
[41:20] you know what that's a that satan
[41:22] is trying to attach us
[41:23] to our cell phones attach us to this and
[41:25] attach us to that
[41:27] but you know what we should be attached
[41:28] to the word of god
[41:31] the truth do you listen to the message
[41:35] do you read your bible do you live the
[41:38] message
[41:39] that's the key are you living what you
[41:41] believe
[41:43] because it says the sons of stephen
[41:44] thought well hey we just use this it
[41:46] worked for paul
[41:48] they said i adjure you by the message
[41:52] that paul preached
[41:53] didn't move him you can endure him by
[41:55] the message brother brown preached
[41:57] you're going to journal by them
[41:58] by the sermon brother stephen preaches
[42:01] or the ministers preach
[42:03] and even use the name of jesus christ
[42:06] but he said who are you
[42:10] you know what but even that's why they
[42:12] don't in that day he said he didn't
[42:14] rebuke them because they cast out devils
[42:17] he didn't rebuke them
[42:18] because they they did signs and wonders
[42:21] they
[42:22] laid hands on the scene he didn't rebuke
[42:23] him for that he rebuked them because he
[42:25] said depart from me you workers of
[42:26] iniquity
[42:27] i never knew you you never received me
[42:32] you never was born i was never born in
[42:34] your heart
[42:36] oh glory to god so it's more
[42:40] than just re reciting it's a living i'm
[42:43] so thankful that god has given
[42:45] us the ability sons and daughters of god
[42:47] to live
[42:48] the truth he said you know between the
[42:51] truth shall make you free
[42:53] has it made you free tonight i don't
[42:55] feel him but this message has never made
[42:56] me feel in bondage
[42:59] i know people think it's made them in
[43:01] bondage but it has not me
[43:03] i'm free and the bible says who the son
[43:06] is set free is free indeed
[43:09] the son of god set us free through the
[43:12] word of god
[43:14] and it was a privilege to hear it and
[43:17] the greatest thing was the privilege
[43:18] that you was able to receive it
[43:20] what is the paradox inside what is a
[43:22] miracle going on
[43:25] is that god give you the ears to hear
[43:28] god give you a heart to receive
[43:30] god give you a heart to leave this
[43:31] message and you know what he's rewarding
[43:34] you for something
[43:35] you had nothing to do
[43:39] all you did is yield yourself to him
[43:42] he said i am your guide
[43:45] oh hallelujah all we have to do is obey
[43:48] his voice
[43:50] listen to this for there is no power but
[43:53] the powers of god
[43:55] that be ordained of god whosoever
[43:57] therefore resists is the power
[43:59] resistance the ordinance of god
[44:03] but you know i understand when you
[44:04] resist the power of god
[44:06] you're resisting the ordinance of god
[44:07] the word of god
[44:09] you know what you can't live this
[44:11] message don't fool yourself
[44:14] i tried to live this as a young boy went
[44:17] out into the world but god's grace
[44:18] brought me back because it was a seed
[44:20] there
[44:20] sister cider he said he wouldn't lose
[44:24] one of us
[44:26] you can't you can't no more be lost than
[44:28] god can
[44:29] if you're a predestinated seed of god
[44:31] you're gonna come his
[44:33] the easy way or the hard way brother
[44:35] maurice
[44:38] i've got a lot of knots but i made it
[44:41] through
[44:42] but you know what the older i'm getting
[44:44] the more i'm learning to lean
[44:46] i'm learning not to refuse what god is
[44:49] speaking
[44:50] to us in this hour oh hallelujah
[44:53] the ordinance of god he said and they
[44:56] that resist
[44:57] shall receive to themselves what
[45:00] damnation
[45:03] so be careful what you resist
[45:06] i mean i'm so hey i'm just so thankful
[45:09] for the truth is
[45:11] for rulers are not a terror to good
[45:13] works
[45:14] but to the evil will thou then not be
[45:17] afraid of the power
[45:20] do that which is good and thou shalt
[45:22] have praise of the same
[45:25] what do you tell us to do brother mike
[45:27] return good for evil
[45:30] you can't do that let me tell you this
[45:32] flesh cannot do those things
[45:34] when somebody does you wrong something
[45:37] on the inside
[45:38] even though this man will get upset
[45:40] something on the inside that says father
[45:43] forgive them for they know not what they
[45:45] do
[45:47] now that's the spirit of the holy spirit
[45:50] that's god's spirit that's god's
[45:51] character that's god desire
[45:53] brother said there's only going to be
[45:54] one thing that we take out of here when
[45:55] we leave
[45:56] and that's the character
[46:00] oh he said for he is the minister
[46:04] of god to thee for good but if thou do
[46:07] not
[46:08] do that which is evil be afraid
[46:12] for he heareth not the sword in vain
[46:15] for he is the minister of god a revenger
[46:19] to execute wrath upon him that doeth
[46:22] evil
[46:23] wherefore ye must needs be subject
[46:26] not only for wrath but also for
[46:29] conscience sake
[46:31] for this cause pay ye tribute also
[46:34] for they are god's ministers attending
[46:37] continually
[46:38] upon this very thing oh
[46:42] if we could just recognize that it's not
[46:45] a man thing
[46:46] it's a god thing it's not a personality
[46:51] it's not a person it's the person jesus
[46:54] christ
[46:56] that's what we're here to hear here for
[46:58] tonight for just to hear from the
[47:00] personality
[47:02] of the holy ghost and what does the word
[47:04] always point us back to
[47:06] what does the spirit always point us
[47:07] back to the word of god
[47:11] you know some here intellectual the of
[47:15] it
[47:16] and then they've got this great
[47:17] revelation in their mind and
[47:19] they can't see anything else but what
[47:20] and then they
[47:22] build up barriers if you don't believe
[47:24] it like i do and
[47:26] you don't do it like i say but you know
[47:28] we must believe it like god sent it
[47:31] you know that's what happened to the
[47:33] calvins
[47:34] and the armenians they went out on a
[47:36] limb and when i let they didn't stay
[47:38] abiding in the vine brother mike if they
[47:42] had abide in the vine
[47:43] then the branches would produce that was
[47:46] more influenced by what the branch was
[47:48] going to do
[47:49] than what the vine was giving them
[47:53] oh they left no way to come back
[47:57] but if you stay in the middle of the
[47:58] road you won't have to worry about
[48:00] swaying here there
[48:02] what did this message come to do for the
[48:04] ministers to do
[48:06] the spirit of god come and what did
[48:07] prophet say when he seen the preview
[48:09] of the bride what was he screaming out
[48:11] stand line
[48:12] stay in line stand now that's what the
[48:15] five-fold ministry is here for
[48:17] the five-fold ministry is not a tape the
[48:20] five-fold ministry is alive
[48:22] and lives forevermore yes i listen to
[48:24] the tapes yes i push play but i tell you
[48:26] what god's got
[48:27] real men of god is preaching the truth
[48:30] and i tell you tonight be careful to
[48:31] refuse not him to speaketh
[48:35] because it's god that speaketh to us
[48:38] what did god choose to you he could have
[48:39] used the trees
[48:41] he could have used anything to do it but
[48:43] he chose man
[48:44] paul said in the foolishness of the
[48:47] preaching of the gospel
[48:49] that's what he chose and then sometimes
[48:53] you
[48:53] you know if you don't watch it you'll
[48:54] just say oh well it's just another
[48:55] service it's not another service
[48:57] this is going home time there's
[49:00] something being said
[49:02] i'm not promoting me i'm promoting
[49:03] christ i'm telling you don't refuse him
[49:07] be obedient to every word obey his voice
[49:12] he said my sheep know my voice no
[49:14] stranger they won't follow they won't
[49:15] obey nothing
[49:16] else i like a little thing i read one
[49:18] time about the shepherd
[49:19] you know the shepherd took a bunch of
[49:20] kids from school and they brought them
[49:22] down there to the
[49:23] shepherd you know and the shepherd was
[49:25] teaching them how to say things and
[49:27] how to how to call the sheep and bring
[49:29] them to get the sheep to come to them
[49:31] and obey
[49:32] and so they they got they tried to do it
[49:34] just like him
[49:35] they spoke like he did brother they
[49:38] moved like he did they commanded the way
[49:40] he commanded
[49:41] but you know what those sheep never
[49:42] moved until they heard the shepherd's
[49:45] voice
[49:47] ain't you glad no matter how close it is
[49:51] how good it sounds that you've got
[49:53] something on the inside
[49:55] that you can recognize the voice of god
[49:57] for your hour
[50:00] the shepherd there's nothing like that
[50:02] voice
[50:04] once you he's he designed a spec
[50:08] a special receiver in our heart
[50:11] that when that voice speaks we humble
[50:14] ourselves
[50:16] we say yes lord what did isaiah do when
[50:20] he really come into the presence of god
[50:22] and he's seen how great he was brothers
[50:24] and sisters and how magnificent he was
[50:27] he said woe is me a man of unclean lips
[50:33] you know and what did it take it took a
[50:35] cold off of the fire
[50:37] for him to do that you know he wasn't
[50:39] wanting to go he wasn't wanting to
[50:41] preach
[50:42] because he had his focus on a man
[50:46] but that man failed because he disobeyed
[50:48] god's word
[50:50] but then when that when that when that
[50:53] angel took that
[50:54] tongue and paul
[50:57] that fiery cold and laid it upon his
[50:59] lips
[51:00] he said send me oh my how can you
[51:04] be shut up they can't nobody shut you up
[51:08] they couldn't shut jeremiah up it's like
[51:09] fire shut up any bones
[51:11] i'm not here to fuss and hard and fight
[51:14] we're not here to dispute we're here to
[51:17] preach the truth
[51:19] and it's up to the up to us to receive
[51:21] it or reject it
[51:24] he said refuse not
[51:28] we need to have the testimony that the
[51:30] word of god lives in us
[51:33] it's not a recital of words it's a life
[51:36] that we have
[51:37] [Music]
[51:38] many refuse they accept the words
[51:43] but they refuse to life there's a lie
[51:46] this message brings a life
[51:49] it brings the very life of god in his
[51:51] bride
[51:53] this is not just any message this is not
[51:55] a denominational message
[51:57] this is the truth of god this is what
[51:59] has been
[52:00] ordained for me and you to receive this
[52:03] is not just in other words of a man
[52:05] this is the words of the living god that
[52:08] has spoken to us
[52:09] and we're blessed that we are hearing
[52:12] and we are blessed that we are receiving
[52:14] and we're blessed that we are living it
[52:23] many were offended at jesus that's right
[52:26] brother said they loved him when he
[52:28] healed the babies when he
[52:30] did all those things and he did all the
[52:33] things
[52:34] and but what changed everything can we
[52:37] turn to saint john 6 just for a minute
[52:39] i know this is this is still the truth
[52:44] amen oh my how beautiful god is
[52:48] you know what and i've never i tell you
[52:50] what i'm just what god made me
[52:53] i can't beat brother i can't be brother
[52:58] stephen
[53:01] god wanted me to be what he made me and
[53:04] i found out if i'll be what he made me
[53:06] he'll back up his word when i preach it
[53:10] and the prophet made it easy for us he
[53:13] said just say what
[53:14] i said hallelujah just say what i say
[53:19] you know some people refuse it because
[53:22] it don't come the way they want it to
[53:23] come
[53:24] it's not spoken the way they like it god
[53:27] don't care
[53:28] if you like it or not god said do you
[53:30] believe it
[53:32] do you love me
[53:35] oh hallelujah saint john 6
[53:38] verse 66 look at this these are men
[53:43] these are men that receive the power of
[53:46] god to
[53:47] cast out devils heal the sick the
[53:50] seventy
[53:51] walk with him the rest of them was
[53:52] disputed against him because he said
[53:53] unless you eat my flesh and drink my
[53:55] blood
[53:56] you have no part of me god didn't
[53:59] explain it to them brother stephen
[54:01] he said do you believe me he even tried
[54:05] to
[54:05] he even tried to use their words to show
[54:07] them that it was the life in the blood
[54:10] it was the sacrifice that was being shed
[54:12] for them they must be a partaker of it
[54:14] they might what did he tell john eat the
[54:16] book
[54:20] these men were renowned men it's always
[54:23] renowned men
[54:25] look at corn david if you look at the
[54:27] scripture renowned men withstood moses
[54:31] was not just some fly by night it was
[54:34] men that had positions men that the
[54:37] people looked up to
[54:39] men that they trusted people trusted
[54:44] but you can't put your trust in me you
[54:46] must put your trust in god in his word
[54:53] oh man listen let's read verse saint
[54:55] john 6
[54:56] verse 65 he said he said therefore i
[55:00] said unto you that no man can come unto
[55:01] me except
[55:03] it were given unto him of my father
[55:06] there is the difference maker
[55:08] if you've received this message and it's
[55:10] not been from the father you're going to
[55:11] walk away
[55:13] but if you perceive this because the
[55:15] father have given you this
[55:17] then you won't have to come under the
[55:19] curse of saint john 6 66
[55:21] that was just not there by perchance
[55:24] that was even recognized in the bible
[55:26] 666 which is the number of man the mark
[55:29] would be
[55:29] listen to that and look at that these
[55:31] men was with him walk with him talked
[55:33] with him
[55:34] seen the miracles but yeah when the word
[55:37] test comes
[55:38] when the word test comes that's what
[55:41] brotherhood said you don't know
[55:42] where a man stands give him the word
[55:43] test
[55:46] you know what god's doing to me and you
[55:47] he's giving us the word test
[55:49] and guess what with the word on the
[55:51] inside we'll pass the test
[55:54] if we've received the spirit of god the
[55:55] holy spirit of god we can't say can't
[55:57] help but say amen
[55:59] he said from that time many of his
[56:01] disciples went back and walked with him
[56:04] no more you didn't see him again in the
[56:06] upper room
[56:08] you didn't see him at the day of
[56:09] pentecost you seen them no
[56:11] no more because why they refused to walk
[56:14] with
[56:17] oh my brother he said this is a
[56:18] dangerous time to turn and walk away
[56:21] refuse not him to speaketh you're not
[56:24] refusing man you're refusing god
[56:29] listen to this in verse 67 he said then
[56:32] said jesus unto the twelve

[56:41] are you it's a challenge to us brothers
[56:44] and sisters
[56:45] are you are you going to leave me also
[56:48] well i like what peter said in verse 67
[56:52] then jesus said verse 68 then
[56:55] simon peter answered him lord to whom
[56:58] shall we go

[57:03] we believe
[57:04] that's the kingdom and we believe
[57:08] and are sure that thou art the christ
[57:10] the son of the living god
[57:12] well then listen what jesus said jesus
[57:16] answered them
[57:16] have not i chosen you twelve and one of
[57:19] you is the devil
[57:22] he knew right down to the end who would
[57:26] betray him
[57:27] he didn't run him off he let him stay
[57:30] right there
[57:31] because he would let him know look it's
[57:33] going to be so close
[57:35] it's not going to be out there in the
[57:36] church world the baptist the methodist
[57:40] all that the pentagon that's that's not
[57:41] all about what it's happening here
[57:45] oh hallelujah i'm so thankful for the
[57:48] word of god
[57:49] you know what this has never offended me
[57:52] you know what it's done
[57:54] this message has made me examine myself

[58:02] me
[58:03] amen aren't you thankful for that aren't
[58:06] you thankful that he gives you
[58:07] the ability to live
[58:10] the word of god he said don't just be a
[58:13] hearer
[58:14] be a doer there's a lot of hearers
[58:17] but the doer lives in there
[58:20] paul even said when i go to do good
[58:22] evil's always present
[58:24] that's not your brother that's not your
[58:26] wife that's this yes
[58:28] he said but you just cast down the
[58:30] imagination bring every thought unto the
[58:32] obedience of jesus christ
[58:34] you know what some reject him because of
[58:36] their understanding
[58:40] he didn't ask me to understand
[58:42] everything he said believe it
[58:45] he said he that believeth on me hath
[58:49] present tense eternal life he that
[58:51] believeth not is already condemned
[58:54] i'm not here to condemn anybody it's
[58:57] what you believe
[58:59] what do you believe is what condemns you
[59:03] you know some people reject him because
[59:07] of holiness you know that's what
[59:10] they resent holiness
[59:14] but without holiness no man shall see
[59:16] god
[59:17] you know who's holy it's the god that
[59:19] lives in you
[59:20] makes you holy makes you live right
[59:22] makes you act right makes you dress

[59:28] is the actions of the holy spirit
[59:34] you know what some rejecting brother
[59:36] steve because they want to fit in with
[59:37] the world
[59:39] they've got their eyes that's what
[59:41] happened a lot
[59:43] he looked down in sodom and the grass
[59:45] was greener
[59:46] but he failed to see the promised word
[59:49] was with abraham
[59:52] and guess what only him and his
[59:54] daughters get out
[59:57] they had to go through the tribulation
[1:00:00] but abraham didn't have to go i'm here
[1:00:01] to tell you you're not going to go
[1:00:02] through the truth this is not
[1:00:03] we're not in the tribulation what we are
[1:00:06] we're in the transition
[1:00:09] you know what people are falling brother
[1:00:11] stephen because they can't they
[1:00:12] fail to make it through the transition
[1:00:15] they're getting lost in the transition
[1:00:19] because he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:00:22] what the spirits say
[1:00:25] oh hallelujah
[1:00:29] oh but none oh i'm so thankful for the
[1:00:32] word of god aren't you
[1:00:34] he warned us don't refuse the
[1:00:36] ambassadors of christ
[1:00:38] men of god is ordained to preach this
[1:00:40] message
[1:00:42] i mean i love the way god is if i've had
[1:00:45] a question
[1:00:46] i've just put it on the shelf and i've
[1:00:49] waited on god
[1:00:50] to give me the answer do you know what
[1:00:53] if
[1:00:53] when i need that it comes at the perfect
[1:00:55] time
[1:00:57] and i say lord thank you
[1:01:00] for revelation but you know what a lot
[1:01:04] of people are doing
[1:01:05] but brad said if you don't understand
[1:01:06] something put it on the shelf
[1:01:09] but you know what people do and they're
[1:01:10] going back and they still don't have
[1:01:11] understanding and they're taking it off
[1:01:13] and they're making a mess of it when
[1:01:15] they should have waited
[1:01:17] for the understanding to come you can
[1:01:20] have wisdom but you
[1:01:21] and you don't have understanding the
[1:01:24] bible says ever learning
[1:01:26] and never coming to the knowledge of the
[1:01:27] truth
[1:01:29] you can learn and learn and learn and
[1:01:30] never come to the knowledge of the truth
[1:01:32] what is the truth is jesus christ is
[1:01:34] unchangeable
[1:01:35] in all of his ways he don't change for
[1:01:38] me he didn't change for this age
[1:01:40] people said oh he had to change to 50
[1:01:42] this age you know he didn't
[1:01:44] the word he spoke then is still the word
[1:01:46] now
[1:01:48] oh hallelujah oh i'm thankful for the
[1:01:51] truth
[1:01:52] [Music]
[1:01:53] listen just hear him so no man is any
[1:01:56] better
[1:01:57] than his word he said i'm no better than
[1:02:01] my word you're no better than your word
[1:02:04] god is no better than his word
[1:02:06] and his word is a part of him your words
[1:02:09] are part of you
[1:02:11] my word are a part of me so being
[1:02:14] infallible his word has to be infallible
[1:02:18] god being omnipotent his word has to be
[1:02:22] omnipotent
[1:02:23] so you see it it's the value of it
[1:02:26] and it is in vindication to every mortal
[1:02:30] on the earth
[1:02:32] if that if it be received right yes
[1:02:36] it's the way you receive it you can
[1:02:39] either be deceived
[1:02:40] or received you can either resent
[1:02:44] or you can resist the devil and walk on
[1:02:48] either resent the word or you can resist
[1:02:50] the devil whichever one you choose
[1:02:52] jesus is challenging me and you choose
[1:02:54] you this to him you'll serve
[1:02:55] yes the world falling apart 1965
[1:02:59] 1962 he says but we got a kingdom
[1:03:02] and in this kingdom it has eternal life
[1:03:05] not membership
[1:03:06] but eternal life and it is governed

[1:03:47] witness unless you've been partaker of
[1:03:49] it

[1:04:43] shrinker
[1:04:45] oh hallelujah listen in the message
[1:04:48] 19 respects 1961 he says the conclusion
[1:04:51] of the whole matter is to fear god
[1:04:54] and when you cannot have respect until
[1:04:57] you henceforth
[1:04:58] have fear
[1:05:01] do you not see everybody says no fear
[1:05:04] you don't fear you know what you know
[1:05:05] what the problem is people don't fear
[1:05:06] god
[1:05:07] i'm not talking about fear oh lord
[1:05:10] please
[1:05:11] it's reverence do you know why people
[1:05:13] don't even reverence the house of god
[1:05:15] do you know this is a holy habitation
[1:05:18] it's not holy because you're here it's
[1:05:20] holy because god's here
[1:05:22] god demands respect for himself for his
[1:05:24] word and for his people
[1:05:27] amen this is not a this is not just a
[1:05:29] motel
[1:05:30] this is the house of god that god has
[1:05:32] ordained for you to come together in
[1:05:33] this place
[1:05:35] we must look at it at more than just a
[1:05:36] place it is the house of god
[1:05:40] and the king dwells here
[1:05:44] this is the king's house this is his
[1:05:45] temple he said what have you done to my
[1:05:48] house
[1:05:48] you made my house a den of thieves he
[1:05:51] said well how you'll know that this is
[1:05:53] my house
[1:05:53] because you make it a house of prayer
[1:05:56] what should we come we should come
[1:05:57] and read our bible and pray that the
[1:06:00] spirit of god might move and speak to
[1:06:02] you before you leave
[1:06:05] respects to saint message 1961 he said
[1:06:08] now
[1:06:09] that don't mean that you're afraid of
[1:06:11] him
[1:06:12] but that means you're giving respects
[1:06:14] and reverence
[1:06:15] and when you respect god you fear god
[1:06:19] and you fear and
[1:06:22] you fear you might displease him
[1:06:27] in some way you fear at least you might
[1:06:29] do something wrong
[1:06:31] brother stephen pickles lost that you
[1:06:33] know what they don't care about
[1:06:34] offending one another he said if you
[1:06:36] offend
[1:06:36] the least of my little ones let's preach
[1:06:38] tonight if you defend the least of my
[1:06:40] little ones you've offended me
[1:06:42] where's the respect where's the honor
[1:06:45] that people
[1:06:46] give i honor you and respect you i
[1:06:49] wouldn't want to hurt you
[1:06:51] i'm hurting god you know what the
[1:06:54] prophet said
[1:06:54] he'd rather you love one another than
[1:06:56] love him
[1:07:00] you know what i didn't understand that
[1:07:03] but you know what
[1:07:04] sister he showed me why he said because
[1:07:06] when you're loving
[1:07:08] them you're loving me
[1:07:11] if we get that attitude brother we'd be
[1:07:13] careful what we say about one another
[1:07:16] we'd be careful how we approach one
[1:07:17] another we'd be careful how we treat one
[1:07:19] another
[1:07:22] because if you treat people that way
[1:07:25] you treat god that way too
[1:07:30] he said be careful you be under
[1:07:32] entertaining angels unaware
[1:07:35] same message he said you see you've got
[1:07:37] before
[1:07:38] you can have respect you've got to have
[1:07:40] fear god demands respect
[1:07:43] god does he demands it and fear brings
[1:07:46] it
[1:07:47] and we know that fear brings respect he
[1:07:50] demands it for his self
[1:07:53] and for his servants
[1:07:56] oh i'm glad that ain't you ain't you're
[1:07:59] glad that you are not
[1:08:01] you're not under that or you refuse
[1:08:04] him that's speaking if you get that
[1:08:07] attitude
[1:08:08] when you come to church it won't matter
[1:08:09] who's speaking as long as he's a real
[1:08:12] man of god do you know what disqualifies
[1:08:13] a man from being behind the pulpit
[1:08:14] brother stephen
[1:08:17] if he hasn't met the pillar right
[1:08:20] right and how can a man preach
[1:08:24] unless he see it oh i'm glad i met that
[1:08:27] pillow fire
[1:08:29] i'm glad i received that spirit of the
[1:08:31] living god
[1:08:32] oh listen to this you know what
[1:08:34] resentment is
[1:08:36] it's a bitter indignation treated
[1:08:39] unfairly that's what we're hearing all
[1:08:40] over the world we've been treated
[1:08:42] unfairly
[1:08:43] and people are but you know what i've
[1:08:45] forfeited my rights
[1:08:47] i'm not an american i'm i'm glad that
[1:08:50] i'm here in america because i still have
[1:08:52] the freedom
[1:08:53] to preach and come and go but i'm not an
[1:08:56] american
[1:08:58] i'm a christian there's a difference
[1:09:01] between an american and a christian
[1:09:05] i'm a christian that dwells in america
[1:09:09] and i want to present that life before
[1:09:11] the people
[1:09:13] because you're not going to win people
[1:09:15] unless you love them
[1:09:16] [Music]
[1:09:18] you know what some people get
[1:09:21] resentment because they've been demoted
[1:09:25] you know why people get demoted brother
[1:09:26] stephen because they don't do their job
[1:09:30] and people resent it but hey
[1:09:34] look at even even the prodigal son
[1:09:37] look at his approach when they even come
[1:09:38] back he didn't come and say look i'm
[1:09:41] your son
[1:09:42] you got to recognize me i'm coming back
[1:09:45] he said i'm just
[1:09:46] willing to be a servant that's me lord
[1:09:49] lord i'm willing
[1:09:50] to be a servant i'm willing to serve
[1:09:53] your children
[1:09:54] i'm willing to do whatever you want me
[1:09:55] to do lord just let me be
[1:09:57] in your presence let me be in your
[1:09:59] household
[1:10:00] oh hallelujah listen in the message 10
[1:10:04] virgins
[1:10:05] and 144 000. he said see if you've got a
[1:10:08] resenting audience
[1:10:10] the holy spirit won't reveal think about
[1:10:12] that
[1:10:13] what we need to pray when we come to the
[1:10:14] house of god lord don't let this
[1:10:16] worldly resenting spirit come on me
[1:10:20] you know what that hinders the moving of
[1:10:22] the holy spirit in the house of god
[1:10:24] do you know whatever that hinders the
[1:10:27] moving of the holy spirit in your life
[1:10:29] when you've got resentment against one
[1:10:30] another
[1:10:32] oh hallelujah he said you have
[1:10:36] got to have something that working
[1:10:39] together
[1:10:40] he said they were in one place in one
[1:10:42] accord then there come a sound from
[1:10:44] heaven brushing
[1:10:46] see but when you got no matter how much
[1:10:49] i'd pray listen to this we put it all on
[1:10:51] the preacher so much
[1:10:53] and the preacher should do his job he

[1:10:57] to what he said
[1:10:58] he said i he said no matter how much i
[1:11:00] pray
[1:11:01] lay lay day and night studying and
[1:11:04] praying before the lord walk down here
[1:11:07] maybe the anointing on me walk up here
[1:11:10] and feel resentment

[1:11:17] not a personality

[1:11:21] fight that as a young man because people
[1:11:22] say well you need to hear this preacher
[1:11:24] and you need to hear that preacher and

[1:11:47] and you know i got in i was that's who i
[1:11:48] come to hear
[1:11:50] i lost my vision as a young christian
[1:11:53] because everybody
[1:11:54] was pushing you know this you know you
[1:11:56] know how it is bro see when you're a
[1:11:57] young
[1:11:57] young man you know everybody's you're

[1:12:01] saying things you you they're pulled
[1:12:03] trying to pull you here and this way and
[1:12:05] trying to sway you now sitting down in
[1:12:06] there brother donald wasn't able to come
[1:12:09] so i got resentment i said man i drove
[1:12:12] all the way down here wasted my money
[1:12:16] i'm i'm telling you this is the way we
[1:12:18] think sometimes
[1:12:19] because i come to hear but and he's not
[1:12:21] here you know what
[1:12:22] i'm so thankful for the holy ghost
[1:12:24] brother stephen i'm so thankful for the
[1:12:26] holy ghost he come down upon me and he
[1:12:27] said who did you come to hear
[1:12:29] did you come to hear man of god i said
[1:12:32] lord i come to hear you and you know
[1:12:33] what it changed my attitude
[1:12:36] who did you come to hear from tonight a
[1:12:37] man personality would come to hear from
[1:12:40] god
[1:12:41] and he and you know what i realized that
[1:12:43] if i approach that every time i come to
[1:12:44] the house of god
[1:12:45] it don't matter who it is how far they
[1:12:47] up where they're at how low they are
[1:12:49] down
[1:12:49] you know what i'm coming to hear from
[1:12:51] god
[1:12:52] and if that's the man of god god's going
[1:12:54] to speak to that man to me
[1:12:56] and i'm not going to leave one listen to
[1:12:59] this he said
[1:13:00] the anointing on me walk up here and
[1:13:02] feel that resentment
[1:13:04] see it grieves him right away he won't
[1:13:07] reveal nothing what if we come to the
[1:13:09] house of god
[1:13:10] that god might reveal to us be careful
[1:13:13] that representing spirit that's in the
[1:13:15] world
[1:13:15] is creeping in the house of god
[1:13:19] oh god be careful he said but when you
[1:13:23] walk
[1:13:23] down here under the anointing feel your
[1:13:27] audience under the anointing
[1:13:28] that's when the holy spirit begins to
[1:13:30] work then he
[1:13:32] begins to move and do great things for
[1:13:34] us
[1:13:35] so you see oh hallelujah
[1:13:38] do you see the approach we ought to have
[1:13:41] when we come to the house of god
[1:13:44] we ought not to refuse him that speaketh

[1:13:51] to let you go
[1:13:53] amen i sure love and appreciate you i

[1:14:32] we've been able to come to the house of
[1:14:33] god
[1:14:36] if that's all the devil's got it's too
[1:14:38] late
[1:14:40] a mass won't stop me from going to god's
[1:14:42] house

[1:14:45] opportunity we ought to make the most of
[1:14:46] this

[1:14:59] as you walk
[1:15:00] forward if you wasn't there would be
[1:15:03] resentment there
[1:15:05] see the holy spirit knows that it's not
[1:15:06] man it's not brother stephen knows that
[1:15:08] it's not the ministry no that's not the
[1:15:10] holy ghost
[1:15:12] the holy ghost knows that he feels it
[1:15:14] when you were sinning
[1:15:16] brother brown said they was the people
[1:15:18] the men would hug me and tell me they
[1:15:20] loved me
[1:15:21] and if they had a knife they'd stab me
[1:15:22] in the back that's not christianity
[1:15:24] don't say it don't tell people you love
[1:15:26] me with your mouth tell them from your
[1:15:28] heart
[1:15:31] he said i know that resentment was there
[1:15:33] he said let's see
[1:15:34] and i know that you wasn't a christian
[1:15:37] if you've got resentment brothers and
[1:15:39] sisters you're not a christian
[1:15:41] i don't care what you say i don't care
[1:15:42] how much the bible you can quote
[1:15:44] how good you can preach how good you can
[1:15:46] talk
[1:15:47] if you if you've got resentment in your
[1:15:50] heart you've got a problem
[1:15:52] you know what it is brothers and sisters
[1:15:54] there's a heart problem
[1:15:55] going on until you get your heart right
[1:15:59] you'll never walk right you'll never
[1:16:01] speak right
[1:16:02] you'll never live right he said there's
[1:16:05] something
[1:16:06] in your life holding you back he said
[1:16:09] that when there's something in your life
[1:16:10] holding you back bro steven it brings
[1:16:11] resentment to the holy spirit
[1:16:13] that spirit resents the word of god it
[1:16:16] resists the spirit of god
[1:16:19] said evil or something in your soul
[1:16:22] something that would
[1:16:23] that you could correct in some way
[1:16:26] but he said i didn't feel that when you
[1:16:28] come in
[1:16:30] lord help us as brother stephen comes
[1:16:31] lord help us to never come
[1:16:34] into the house of god with a resenting
[1:16:36] spirit
[1:16:38] we do not want to grieve the holy spirit
[1:16:41] we do not want to refuse him to speak
[1:16:44] amen oh i'm so thankful for the word of
[1:16:46] god we sure appreciate you
[1:16:48] love you such a special group to me
[1:16:51] always been my brothers hadn't changed
[1:16:53] my love for you

[1:16:56] standing for the truth
[1:16:58] the truth will set you free let's bow

[1:17:05] resentful to a man or to your children
[1:17:08] or to anyone
[1:17:10] oh god my hand goes up to lord i'm
[1:17:13] asking you to search us before we leave
[1:17:15] lord
[1:17:16] because you said correction begins at
[1:17:18] the house of god
[1:17:20] father so lord we've you have revealed
[1:17:22] these things to us
[1:17:24] now we repent lord we repent if we've
[1:17:26] had any wrong thought any wrong idea
[1:17:29] anything lord that we have resented
[1:17:31] anything
[1:17:33] you've said or your children said father
[1:17:36] your prophet says sometimes the devil
[1:17:37] will let
[1:17:38] we'll get on somebody and they'll say
[1:17:39] something just to see how we react
[1:17:42] father let us react with love but not
[1:17:44] let us react with anger
[1:17:46] father for that's the way you did
[1:17:48] because the bible said you knew
[1:17:50] there was no guile found in your mouth
[1:17:53] and lord your children we ought to be
[1:17:55] the same way lord
[1:17:56] we ought to be no guy found in our mouth
[1:17:59] nothing but joyful things and happy
[1:18:01] things
[1:18:01] father he you didn't tell us not to
[1:18:04] resist the devil
[1:18:05] but we do resist him but we do not
[1:18:07] resist
[1:18:08] flesh and blood we pray for them lord we
[1:18:11] pray for those who despitefully use us
[1:18:13] we bless those who curse us lord lord we
[1:18:16] just ask you now father to help us bless
[1:18:18] brother stephen lord here
[1:18:19] bless his wife lord continue to use him
[1:18:22] father
[1:18:22] may he carry these people to greater
[1:18:24] heights and greater depths lord for his
[1:18:27] obedience to you lord may you have your
[1:18:30] hand of mercy upon him father
[1:18:32] guide him got his footsteps got his
[1:18:35] thoughts
[1:18:36] got his heart got his lips lord may your
[1:18:38] blessing be upon him lord
[1:18:40] we ask these things in jesus christ's
[1:18:42] name amen
[1:18:44] amen amen can you sing that song i love
[1:18:47] him i love him
[1:18:48] because he first loved me
[1:18:51] brother stephen would come

[1:19:48] salvation
[1:19:55] [Music]
[1:20:00] amen that's my desire this evening is
[1:20:02] just to have the love of god in my heart
[1:20:04] as he was preaching
[1:20:05] i was just thinking about a couple days
[1:20:08] ago i was in a gas station and
[1:20:10] and a gentleman brought his his snacks
[1:20:12] his drinks and his gas or whatever he
[1:20:14] had and
[1:20:14] he was going to pay and i swiped my car
[1:20:17] before he got the swipe
[1:20:18] his and he was wondering what i was up
[1:20:20] to
[1:20:21] and he was asking me what are you up to
[1:20:22] what are you up to and i'm like i just i
[1:20:24] just wanted to do something
[1:20:25] i want to do something nice for you and
[1:20:26] i'm like in a world that is lacking love
[1:20:29] in the extent that it is in our time
[1:20:31] right now
[1:20:32] to where you can't even do something
[1:20:34] nice for somebody without them thinking
[1:20:35] you're up to something
[1:20:36] and i'm just like lord like allow me to
[1:20:39] have
[1:20:40] your love in my heart just like he was
[1:20:41] preaching tonight and also brother
[1:20:43] branham talked about just a small route
[1:20:45] of bitterness will
[1:20:46] completely strip the love of god right
[1:20:48] out of you so
[1:20:49] as as he mentioned at the end just any
[1:20:51] root of bitterness in my life i ask the
[1:20:53] lord to just
[1:20:53] break it out to clean me out clean me
[1:20:55] out give him give me his love
[1:20:57] i want to have his love in my heart for
[1:21:00] each one and
[1:21:01] i just pray that the lord just you know
[1:21:03] do that for me do that for this church
[1:21:05] god bless you brother richie we
[1:21:06] appreciate you thank you
[1:21:11] [Applause]
[1:21:12] we'll sing that again as we invite our
[1:21:14] pastor i
[1:21:17] love him
[1:21:31] [Music]
[1:21:40] emperor
[1:21:54] oh
[1:21:58] [Music]
[1:22:02] hallelujah you know
[1:22:06] you might not realize it probably
[1:22:10] but you wait on sunday if the dear lord
[1:22:14] jesus christ there
[1:22:15] you're going to see that this message
[1:22:17] comes from god
[1:22:19] the brother preach and give me key and
[1:22:22] confirm the third part
[1:22:25] of the mystery of the two steps
[1:22:29] he even give me a scripture that i have
[1:22:31] to use on sunday
[1:22:34] but when i preach on sunday you're going
[1:22:36] to realize that god was speaking tonight
[1:22:40] there is a separation that is happening
[1:22:44] it is not caused by you
[1:22:47] you're going to see it on sunday it is
[1:22:49] not you that is causing it it is caused
[1:22:52] by the timing
[1:22:54] and by the word of god you can't help it
[1:22:58] all you need to do is just relax because
[1:23:01] something is really happening
[1:23:04] you remember me using a quote where i
[1:23:06] say that god wants you
[1:23:09] to serve him in a different category
[1:23:12] yeah you're going to go through four
[1:23:14] steps
[1:23:15] in that category and it's going to be
[1:23:18] for this church
[1:23:20] if somebody is online who have
[1:23:21] subscribed and god speak to them
[1:23:23] praise the lord and those that are
[1:23:25] battling resentment online
[1:23:28] getting in the online trying to find
[1:23:31] fault or think that we have a problem
[1:23:33] with them
[1:23:34] may the holy spirit touch them tonight
[1:23:36] to change it
[1:23:38] but this is a different level not to
[1:23:41] make ourselves special
[1:23:42] but you're going to go through four
[1:23:44] steps from this church
[1:23:46] and the last step will get you into the
[1:23:48] rapture
[1:23:50] amen yeah we're going to get deeper he
[1:23:53] even
[1:23:54] i was preparing working on a sermon
[1:23:58] on the mystery of predestination
[1:24:02] and he spoke about predestination
[1:24:03] tonight he didn't even know the quote
[1:24:06] that i was preparing when i was at work
[1:24:09] working today
[1:24:10] you're going to go deep in
[1:24:11] predestination and you're going to
[1:24:13] appreciate
[1:24:14] more god in your life than ever
[1:24:17] and just by knowing what god has been
[1:24:19] doing
[1:24:20] through predestination is going to
[1:24:23] change you
[1:24:24] you won't be worrying about what is
[1:24:25] happening in your life
[1:24:27] once you predestinate there is a mystery
[1:24:30] that happened there
[1:24:31] and god work according to that plan
[1:24:34] so your life does not happen by any
[1:24:37] chance
[1:24:38] praise the name of the lord so there is
[1:24:40] a separation
[1:24:42] that is coming when you get to church
[1:24:45] get your heart prepared
[1:24:47] stay prayed up don't bring a spirit or
[1:24:50] let a spirit of resentment coming in
[1:24:53] whoever the lord is leading here god
[1:24:56] knows exactly what he's doing
[1:24:59] if a resentment is there the ministry
[1:25:02] cannot help you
[1:25:03] it's going to be like we're pouring
[1:25:05] water on the duck
[1:25:06] on a duck's back it's not going to help
[1:25:08] you so may the holy spirit
[1:25:10] unveil this to each one remove all
[1:25:13] bitterness
[1:25:14] we have been hurt we have been done
[1:25:17] things wrong
[1:25:19] we have been like dumped down
[1:25:22] but don't build a complex against it
[1:25:25] everything
[1:25:27] is working together for good
[1:25:30] you
