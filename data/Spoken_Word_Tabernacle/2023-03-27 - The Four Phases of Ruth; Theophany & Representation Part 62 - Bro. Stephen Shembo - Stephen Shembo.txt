Glory to God Amen I hope some folks are not affected by the other court because it's raining outside everybody okay you can read between the lines how many are still reading the Cod book I know somebody finish it how about your church uh your question and answer we still have question and answer there we got them in English and we got them in French so they are still available and they're free so when I get before your maker our maker I will tell him that I put question and answer it for free so it was their responsibility to go ahead and read it amen Lord's willing on April 15th we will have a question and answer and that will be here in the church because they're still working on our secret place meeting amen this question and answers are very important not only to you but they are also important for me unless the Lord give you the Revelation but they are very important I'm going to read something from Brother Branham right here amen Oh Glory to God therefore don't start it's too early glory to God okay brother Branham say that I gave out for some questions you got a brother Angela good Grady okay some question tonight an answer just to Khan off he says the reason we do this is to kind of find out what is on the water on the hearts of the so I want to know what is in your heart and we know how we can continue to move if somebody's lost or he's behind or something we make sure we get it Brother David this one that's a bazooka right there and it works pretty good amen he say I think that's a very good for who a pastor a pastor to give out this and then he found out just about what the people's thinking about if they write their question they have something and I think every one of us is Duty bomb to do what expel our water third so you cannot hide your thoughts you need to speak out to expel our thoughts to our pastors our water spiritual leaders and so forth and anything that we see that is so we can make everything run house smooth and wow fine and for the kingdom of her God's sake so you don't speak up it's your problem you want to say something put it on question and answer it is very important so we know where you are spiritually where you're struggling and we can eye on these things and make sure everybody only is on the same page everybody clear so far and April 8th that will be music part two I ask every technician and every musician I got all of them on record for their response and they are open for April 8th so April 8th here at four o'clock in the building we have music part two everybody okay glory to God Lord's willing on April the 19th which is a Wednesday that will be our first Wednesday for prayer where we preach 30 minutes we stop and we pray all the way through everybody okay so once every two months you got the time to come to church and pray amen but remember once we start praying we're gonna cut up the streaming everybody okay so you tune in with us and everything will be good I love the singing and everything that was going on here I'm sorry I was back there I cannot enjoy the way I wanted to but we are among the best the bread is the best and we are a portion of the bread so we are among the best [Applause] glory glory to God I gave you 14 quotes on our stand for the playing of tapes in the church in this church so all of you have been giving those quote the in your possession so God richly bless you and as far as I'm concerned when it comes to push play you know where we're standing you know what we believe amen we always will encourage you to read your Cod book to read your question and answer to listen to The Prophet because that is the message of the everybody okay so far I believe I got everything covered quickly let's move on straight to our scripture glory to God amen I thought we will reach the resurrection can you adjust me a little bit I'm trying to save my voice thought we're going to reach the resurrection but there is something we got to deal with it a little then he kind of prepared and laid the foundation for everything and clarify the last portion of the theophany then we can move on how do we raise up from the dead how do we change what makes you change everybody okay since the opening of these Hills all everything the whole bubble is become a new so you know what it is amen so we must track a difficult Doctrine that you heard maybe you don't even know what it is really but you just probably heard of it amen you heard it people talking about it you want me to tell you that the two Souls I don't know how much you heard about it everybody okay so I'm gonna deal with that one okay once we deal with that one we come up with theophany then we are soaring we're in good run everybody okay so stay up it's raining outside we want it to rain down in this place amen for those that were in question and answer when I begin to read the Scripture it will automatically click because we went through this illness a little bit of detail amen Genesis chapter 1 verse 1. this is an easy one to find out you just open the scripture and it's there amen everybody okay I want you to be strong I go to sleep late I sleep at 3am and I have to wake up around eight something so you should be stronger than me okay yeah so don't be like I didn't sleep you already slept seven hours and then you complaining about you didn't sleep okay don't do that in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth we can get into the detail here but I'm just gonna get the scenario here verse 2 and the Earth was without form you might be seated how can God create something that doesn't look good am I reading a different Bible the Bible say God created the Heaven and the Earth so we expect when God created that when he comes out he will look out beautiful it will look perfect but when it comes out he doesn't look good he have no form and it's void why are you the Way You Are why were you created with the weaknesses you everybody okay and the Earth that was created by God was without form and how void and what was there Darkness who created here God how can he create the Earth and when you look in the earth you open the Earth it's Darkness what is he doing what is God doing everybody on board thank you so this Earth a little illustration is created like we know the planet but inside the Earth it's all dark so when you look at this Earth you don't see anything and you ask the Earth who created you he says you see that light over there that's the light that made me you don't know that light it's on the picture over there that light today created everything even this puppet here everybody okay and darkness was upon the face of the Water Deep and the spirit of God hey everybody okay if you notice there is a punctuation a full stop you need to be careful with the punctuation of the Bible we already talked about it amen it's a full stop then after this bad situation where everything is dark and gloomy the second part the spirit of the Lord everybody okay so there is a dark Earth a Nerf that is in the grip of Darkness everybody okay and then we got something that is coming to this earth which is called the spirit of God everybody okay and the spirit of God not the spirit of anybody the spirit of the one that created the Earth the spirit of the creator the Creator is here the Creator created the Earth so he's bigger than the earth everybody okay but he can make himself so small now he can humble himself you see what humility is and he can enter the Earth that he created now the earth look like big and he's small what is he doing in this earth and the spirit of God move upon the face of the waters war was on top of the water say it loud don't be afraid Darkness what was on top of the water Darkness where did the spirit of God move underwater upon what why is he chasing the darkness anybody okay he didn't get in the water no he he went to where darknesses are we okay are we okay so the darkness that is on the Earth amen already gave the spirit of the Lord where to work foreign you want to know the new birth right we already started last week right amen right so the spirit of the Lord is very specific it's going straight on the same spot so in other words when this spirit is entering in number one he's going straight where darkness is in other words if darkness is here when the spirit of the Lord entered this church he goes right here the first person he Shake hand with there it is the darkness he said good morning Darkness you know what Darkness do because the one that was created was a light you know what happened when you are bringing light and darkness see light you know what happened right it's a very beautiful scenario everybody okay glory to God verse 3 and God say Let There Be Water light so God get into the Earth and get in the position where darkness is and he speak let there be light what happened with the spoken word everybody okay let there be light and there was water light what does light have to do here and God saw that Delight that he was have good and God did water divided the light from Darkness he divided the light from water in other words God calls a separation everybody okay so when the spirit of the Lord enter and went where darkness is a result in a separation in other words the earth now become free from the grip of Darkness everybody okay everybody okay I didn't intend to do this but I'm gonna do that job to verse five and God called the light water the day and the Darkness he called water night and the evening and the morning were the first water day Darkness was removed and pushed that somewhere everybody okay but Darkness didn't leave the Earth completely Darkness will leave the Earth in the New Jerusalem because God called Darkness water in the city in the city where the camera do you want to read it you want to read it tell you okay let's go to revelation 21. don't be shy I already know you we know one another don't be shy just speak up you shy that's your problem you want to go home and then what was the scripture do you know the scripture and they want to say no I didn't know it but none of you spoke amen everybody okay this is a difficult territory here okay you're the one that asked for it let's go to revelation 21. if you dare you can say Amen you there verse 23. I don't want to get lost because if I move on somebody will continue to think over it and then can find out exactly where it is and the devil will be playing with your mind and you miss the whole service because you can't figure it out where the the actual scripture is if you there you can say amen amen verse 23. and the city had no need of the waters son neither of the water moon to the water shine in it for the glory of God did water lie in it and the lamb is the light water verse 25 and the gates of faith shall not be shot at all by what for there shall be water no night there everybody okay go to verse to chapter 22. you there you there and there shall be no verse 5 and there shall be no water right and they shall end this and they need no water candle need the water the light off from the Sun do you get something there do you see something if you don't see it tell me do you see something let me read it again and there shall be no night today there's no night and they need no water candle everybody okay come on need the water the light of the Sun did you see something did you see something did you see something if you didn't see raise your hand thank you everybody okay did you catch yourself did you catch yourself this is the other code this is the water the holy place and this is the water which light goes in the outer code the sun and the water are we okay when you move from this compartment you enter in the Holy Place ah which light is there which light is there the candle I'm ready to go hey everybody okay when you move from this place into this place which light is there which lighter you're not saying anything the pillar of Fire and the Bible said there won't be no water and no water so which light is there kill the fire do you see why you need to be in the holiest you see your Tabernacle there in other words the other court and the holy place is finished eternally it is the light that was in the holiest let's go now read it and this have been no night today they don't need and they need no candle holy place neither the light of the sun are they called for the Lord give them water the light the pillar of fire amen and they shall reign forever and water in add the word in the New Jerusalem who will dwell day where is roof at now where is she in the Tabernacle only the people that dwell here do you follow me who dwell in New Jerusalem because when they dwell here they already bypass the first light and they bypass the second light and they are now living by the third right everybody else will be outside of the city [Applause] so for you to dwell in the New Jerusalem you must first dwell in the third portion of the Tabernacle have I lost anyone Have I Lost You Ezekiel chapter 18. you want to go to the New Jerusalem you want to go to the rapture only those that dwell there will be taken up everybody okay if you foolish virgin whatever you are outside everybody okay the 144 000 who can get inside with us because they will receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in one day that's why they escort the brother that's why they can be in the city so you got to have the qualification of the city in you for you to live in that City in other words you must be the city first is it okay before you enter in the city we will get into that okay Ezekiel chapter 18 verse 1. if you dare you can say it man amen the word of the Lord came to me again saying what menu that you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel saying the father have eaten sour grape and the children teeth are set on the water in other words whatever the father have done have repercussion on the children but remember last week the predestinated seed make the difference even if your father was a drunker he would die at the Grand canachio everybody okay verse 3 as I leave say the Lord You shall not have occasion anymore to use this proverb in water in other words I don't want you to use that language anymore because if something happened to a child you say no this happened to you because your father did something bad the father ate the sour grip and the children are suffering God said no more that you need to change that okay what is the New Covenant verse 4. behold All Souls are water mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the sun is water they saw that in other words whoever does the trouble he's going to be responsible himself not you doing something wrong and your children are suffering not David doing something wrong and the child got to hell everybody okay not Jeff dad's father going to a prostitute having a child then Jeff that will be blocked from heaven are we okay are we okay are we okay job to verse 19. Hallelujah see sadly a bird you dead yet say you why does not the sun bear the iniquity of the father you remember until the 10th Generation when the sun has done that which is lawful and right and has kept all my statue and has done them he shall surely do what live God say wait a minute you say child is born and he begin to behave right and do things that are correctly that child won't die because of you everybody okay so it becomes now individual are we okay verse 20. they saw that water sinneth it shall do water die so a soul can die there is a compound meaning to this I'm gonna use one Avenue because the other one is is a little bit tougher everybody okay a soul that sin is someone that does so will do what he would die in other words a soul can die what does it mean it's all dying what does it mean you see we got our own conception on fixing the message and we use that intellectual conception and put it in the word of God and we are confused this is the Tabernacle right everybody okay the other court is the body the only place is what and the holiest is water So when you say the soul die what does it mean do you know the way we think do you know the way we think in the message we will do this and we say the soul is died you forget that the holiest is only a compartment did you get it the holiest is only a compartment it's only a building a portion of the building what dies is not the building that's fine let's continue okay let's continue we will pick it up okay verse 20. they saw that dies that that sins is the sun shall not bear the iniquity of the father neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the water the righteous the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon in other words whatever you do will fall on yourself verse 21 but if the wicked will turn from his sin that he has committed and keep all my statute and do that which is lawful and right he shall surely water live he shall not water so one person would die there is a soul that dies what does he mean let's go to Second Corinthians chapter four then we pray Hallelujah second Corinthians chapter four you need your Bible a little bit if you dare you can say amen amen Lord help me you there you there second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 6. remember the first scripture was in Genesis the Earth was dark and there was Darkness upon the face of the deep and the Lord enter and follow the darkness and causes water a separation everybody okay now is he ringing the bell now the message is never complicated never that's why they took somebody who didn't go in PhD so God doesn't want to mix it up together everybody okay everybody okay now verse 6 for God who commended the light where did he do it in Genesis 1. okay God who commended the light to shine Out of Water Darkness so in the midst of Darkness God turn on the light that's why brother Branham preached the message there is somebody that can turn on the light when everything is dark when God entered there he turned on the light [Applause] everybody okay so Darkness doesn't scare God as long as God knows what is under the darkness all right there is a ditch they put all kinds of stuff there everybody okay dirty your child sleep up and fell into there so you will be standing up there and say come out what will you do when you're entering there do you carry about what is in the ditch what are you looking at but if somebody say be careful there are germs there be careful don't get there there are many germs over there are you looking at the gym there is something there more precious than any germs and regardless of the price across you will clean up later but I need to get the boy out everybody okay everybody good for God who commended the light to shine out of water has sun in our water if God is shining in your heart what was in your heart is it complicated you want me to complicate it foreign so God is coming and he's also entering the light the heart that's what brought that's what Paul is saying so and when he entered the heart God Shine the Light so in other words the heart was in darkness is that complicated Amen in other words whatever happened to the Earth that was just a shadow of what God does to a believer everybody okay everybody good so when God shine Delight what will happen to the darkness that is there he will cause what again separation everybody okay let's read it for God who commanded the light to shout out of water Darkness has shown in our hearts not one person heart so there are many hearts a heart is a human being God will not shine in the heart of a beast everybody okay to give the light of the knowledge of who the glory of God in the face of Jesus Jesus Christ that we have this treasure in water the Earth everybody okay everybody okay so this heart has a vessel okay this is your body it's a nursery vessel amen within your body everybody that is here have a heart we clear we have this treasure in the earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power might be of who and not of what Us in either way you have nothing to be glorified everybody okay verse 8 we are trouble on water every side yet not water the stress why are we not distressed what hold on everybody okay we are how perplexed or puzzle but not in water despair verse 9 we are how persecuted but not whatever why he doesn't forsake us we are how cast down but not water how can't you destroy this man [Applause] in other words you can never be destroyed everybody okay let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly again this morning Father thanking you once again for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is as far as I can go as a human being a man that you give in the ability by grace to be able to read the Holy Scripture together with the purchase of the Bride father Lord may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to your children may you remove every spirit of destruction everything that have cast your children down that have puzzled them that have persecuted them in their mind and in talks may you completely clear them up may you come and give the freedom of the spirit so that Lord they can receive the unglifted word that is able to save their soul father be the beginning and the ending of this service as we commit all unto the hand sealing the devil completely out of this place in the name of Jesus Christ amen my subject this morning is the four phases of roof the theophany and representation everybody okay the theophany and your representation everybody okay you can't sleep now everybody okay we're just about to take off everybody okay still we are in the dressing floor where we're dealing between the two chapter from roof getting the sixth measure of Bali that Boaz unfolded The Mystery of the seals but on roof chapter 4 he finishes the work of redemption so that Boaz and roof can unite together in the body in a tabernacle just like we expressed this morning roof is in the holiest where she's preparing for the going away they're going away which is the rewarding or the Rapture and she changes Tabernacle what are we trying to speak today with the uh the theophany and representation where we are now we have established clearly two line everybody okay we have established the Eternal line and the temporary line or temporal line everybody okay by the eternal life we found out that first of all we are a seed everybody okay we call that again the word everybody okay we called it again a thought everybody okay we call it again an attribute amen we call it again a germ everybody okay all of this is the same thing so when you read brother Brown I'm saying word it means the same thing attribute you mean the same thing thought everything is just speaking about the same thing that is how you start how you not even stop because you always wear it like that everybody okay so this form of you here amen needed a body everybody okay if this form is eternal the body that must contain this form must also be eternal everybody okay and that body is what we call according to the scripture the tea or funny it is the body of the word or the body of the seed or the body of the thought this thought is not your thought it is not an imaginary thought it is actually a human being existing already everybody okay everybody okay in other words your thoughts your attribute your germ your seed your word is a hand is a glove are you following are you following me you cannot make a glove that doesn't match the end everybody okay in order to your funny came out your theophany came out in reference to who you really are everybody okay in other words if you never seen yourself really if you look at your theophany you already seen yourself everybody okay because your theophany is a reflection of the seed this seed here is a person [Music] everybody okay but that person needed a body everybody okay and this seed is eternal and that your family is water so when the theophany comes everybody okay he's not interested in your body here he has something that is coupled together with it he always chase for something amen everybody okay another word yoti or funny and your seed when you put them together they are exactly the same thing everybody okay that your family is the image of the seed everybody clear everybody okay and it's a body in the temporal line everybody okay temporal mean you have a beginning amen and if you have a beginning then you must end somewhere everybody okay everybody okay in this land God create you first as a soul we okay and by the soul God couple your soul with a spirit everybody Okay we okay this part right here is what we call the Inner Man or the East Side man where are you going Pastor we're going somewhere amen just as this part of you needed a body are we okay this part also the inner man or the Inside Man neither saw a body everybody okay that body is what we call your Corporal body everybody okay that's what James say the body without the spirit is what dead everybody okay your body that you have right now if you take the spirit off it's dead everybody okay but the body of the theophany even if you take the spirit off it is still alive [Applause] can you choose that are we okay everybody okay everybody okay so because you come this line you're following me God knew that from the beginning you are eternal everybody okay you jump or you drop down from the upper line everybody okay to a lower line everybody okay you become a human being now God wanted to pick you up and to pull you back again to the upper line anybody okay everybody okay so God uses your soul are you following me you want to know the new birth right God uses your soul to take this seed right here everybody okay this word this thought this attribute this germ this person are you following me and he dropped that person into your soul why is he dropping that person into the soul I know it's hard that's why I told you stay up but it's gonna clear every smoke William Marion brother brother Branham said but a man has a water so and therefore that soul is a water part of God what does he mean amen if you take the soul out of a human being he is not different than the dog everybody okay what gives you superiority upon the animal kingdom is because your soul in other words your soul is your Divine part amen amen everybody okay it is your party that make you God [Music] William everybody okay William Marion Branham brother Branham say and even in its Fallen state man yet it is the most water greatest greatest specie of all the species of the water Earth is who the man and then get him in water connection with his water maker how is he gonna get in connection to his maker oh man that's it that's it everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay we got internet here by the Robert we're getting our internet from atnt or Time Warner a TNT do you see a TNT here no do you know where atnt is do you know the central of ATT do you know what it is anybody knows if you know you can tell me if you notice nobody knows where it is how do we get a TNT everybody okay ATT is everywhere why do you get it here everybody okay when you sign up with atnt everybody okay atnt will send the technician here I'm going slowly amen and the technician will bring some equipment everybody okay everybody okay from the central of ATT everybody okay and when they come in this church they will enter inside this church and put that equipment in this church everybody Okay the reason why that equipment is placing the church is to establish connection [Applause] everybody okay is to establish connection between the central the headquarters atnt and you who are here and no matter where atnts as long as you get the receiver as long as you got the modem [Applause] amen you can operate the internet right here without any with that ATT coming here [Music] everybody okay everybody okay and you can even turn the Wi-Fi everybody okay everybody okay and brother Branham is saying if you can put men back in connection for man to be in connection you must bring a modem in men you must bring a device from God and put it in man so God can communicate with the device that is in men [Applause] everybody okay and one man when that device begins to communicate with God then you inside of you begin to receive a Godly Wi-Fi oh yes everybody okay if your child is sick your Wi-Fi [Applause] can lay hand on that child you don't need God you just need you [Applause] are we together are we together because you are you have white shark you have hot spots your hand the hot spot that you can connect with your baby and pray you become representative everybody okay everybody okay when somebody come in your house to visit you they will ask you your passcode [Applause] ever you can when you give them the passcode they can get also connected amen with the white father is in the house and begin to operate together everybody okay and when they leave your home they say my God it was good to visit brother Charles Hamilton I feel so good I was down but now I'm stronger you just made connected to a Wi-Fi everybody okay can I continue he says if you can get him in water connection with his hope maker he become how Superman almost because he's a water Son of God [Music] everybody okay so the device God used the modem God used to put in you is your seed or your word all your thoughts your real card or your attribute all your jam God get your soul and he dropped the seed into the soul and the modem stay ready waiting for a signal to pop up everybody okay and wherever at TNT's he can troubleshoot the modem they can send the signal and troubleshoot the modem and then the internet begin to work fine [Applause] everybody good we just left the airport okay I'm still this way amen he says and then he said he's the son of God he become how acquitted with his water in that way that the beginning you were not acquainted you just knew there was an ATT you just heard about how fast speed it is you heard all the good stuff but you didn't really know a TNT everybody okay he said with the creator of water and then when the man you up and when that man there acquainted with his maker become a part of water his maker you become a part of atnt become back into water fellowship with his water his maker every Divine Water World become a water living reality so everything they told you about atnt is a reality it is no more a story you are using atnt you can connect your alarm you can connect your ring you can connect your TV you can connect to your computer if you stop the signal all these things begin to die everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay so when you check your phone the internet is off when you check your your TV the internet is off when you go check your alarm the internet is off you need to check the modem [Applause] are you reading are you understanding check your modem and if it's not working what do you do you pick up the fun and you say Jeremiah 33 call me and I will answer you say father something is wrong with the modem [Applause] [Music] everybody okay then your father will pick up the phone and say where are you at he said where are you at let me troubleshoot the modem everybody okay everybody good so to be in connection God put the modem in you so that he can communicate with the modem and establish a connection so that you and him will be 24 hours synchronizing everybody good everybody good William Marion Branham glory to God hallelujah brother Bonham say if you get eternal life when tonight if we have eternal life then we will always have word because there is only water one full give him some volume my friend one form of water eternal life we always win right here and the reason we were because we are water part of God and God is the only thing that is how Eternal for when God had you in his water thinking in the at the beginning you have to be some water part your water life that is in you now had to be with water God before before that I'm going slowly so he suck well when he before he even become what material here on water before there was anything but who God you are one of his water attributes he not what your name will be he know the water color of your hair the color of hair you would have he knowed all about you the only thing happened is when you bring a water what are you trying to say Pastor William Marion Branham get ready my friend there was one time before the foundation of the world I was how eternal where were you Eternal you were Eternal I said as a word as a thought as an attribute as a germ you as a person you were eternal in other words you didn't have a beginning you never had an end you always were it's hard when you use this intellect when God thought of me amen I was part of before the water foundation of the world my name was put in the water Lamb's Book of Life let me stop here and help you when we say God thought of you it doesn't mean it's a new thought do you understand me I got three children they are in the house but they can be in the house but I don't I'm not thinking about them I might be thinking about the sermon but they are in the house but there will come a time I say I need a pen everybody okay then I thought about one of them that thought he didn't create them ah I don't know if you get me that thought didn't birth for my children they were already there everybody okay when I thought about them then I can call and say Isaac Isaac is real I just want to stabilize somebody everybody okay brother Branham say my name was put in the Lamb's Book of Life even so was who yours before there was even one grain of water how many knows that is the Bible congregation say Amen how many know that God put your name in the lamps book of life before the foundation of the world then in God's water thinking we were born right into his Water Kingdom okay I know you came to Jesus Christ in 1985. that's when you were at the altar but what happened in the altar is just a history all right amen everybody okay you already came in the altar from there everybody okay brother Brown I'm saying one day there come a buddy through a water this Corporal here my father and my mother and they served me and here I come who William Brennan William Branham represented in a body of water flesh everybody okay everybody okay brother Branham say when he get into this body here he got a representation amen this representation is a human representation this is where we take our picture for the passport everybody okay everybody okay if they wanna see you they will say I want to see your ID your identification your identification have a picture that picture look like your body right there everybody okay when they look at your ID and they look at you they want you on the ID to match you on the Corporal when you match they say yes that is his bank account open the information give him the information everybody okay that's the representation we use here on Earth brother Barnum say he said William Branham William Branham represented in a body of water flesh now you know me as water Williams how a man what do we see one another here what the state knows what the school knows what your supervisor bosses know they know you as a man or a woman God know me as what they never have to change and what in his not mine and a water expression you are looking at me here but when God look at me he remembers something what are you trying to say in other words there are two of me everybody okay there is one of you that is eternal and there is another of you that is how temporal everybody okay glory to God ah now let's get to this man and you gotta swallow it I was saying this taking for myself like you was going to say who William Branham well 40 years ago the William Branham it is not the same one out tonight everybody okay brother Branham said the one you see today is different than the one you knew 40 years ago we're not the same what are you trying to say William Branham he says if somebody back there 40 years ago would say William Branham he was a water everybody okay see because I was born of who Charles and water hello Brenham in the nature I was a water I came to the word and all the habits of the word lay where [Music] but I'm out everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay remember this is your soul remember this is your soul the soul is you everybody okay and inside the soul we have water we have a seed everybody okay and the seed is water water so it's also you everybody okay everybody okay so they were to you everybody okay everybody good this view of the Soul has a beginning and the end and this you is eternal amen everybody okay God is trying to take everything of you and make you completely eternal [Applause] but there are some part of you that are not Eternal yet everybody okay so God is moving in the process to start getting whatever is temporal and begin to make that eternal and he begins first from the inside amen but to begin the work he need the modem everybody okay and he pick up the modem and he put in your soul so he can first change your soul from a temporary resource to an eternal soul [Applause] I'm gonna help you up this way God gave Israel the manner everybody okay when God brings Manna in the morning the Mana only lasted for one day if you keep it the next day it's rotten spoiled completely amen if God give it to you tomorrow is spoiled but God told Israel pick up a manner what do you do with it he said take that manner go with faith in the holiest and put it there anybody okay when God took the man and put it in the Holy do you follow me when God came and sat in the holiest that manner never was destroyed anymore everybody okay that manner receives something that blocked the process of rottening [Applause] amen even if you keep it for 10 years that man is still fresh in other words there is something eternal that block the natural process and the manner begin to act like an eternal food I don't know if you're getting me so God knew that your soul has a beginning but God want to make your soul Eternal so God have to take that portion of Eternity which is your seed and load the modem in the soul so that when the modem is activated it take hold of your soul [Music] [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay another word by my example your modem your seed is your Pillar of Fire and your soul is your manner everybody okay everybody following me [Applause] William Marion brother he says brother Branham say you know me as this Rascal he said but done in there amen two what's another word nature present present see a water predestinated predestinated what was in there by who God in the same body [Applause] everybody good you got the soul you got the spirit and you got the water you got the body you got the spirit because this way is going to help somebody quickly and you gather Soul inside the soul God drop a water seed a seed right here amen amen so brother Brown I'm saying he said this body amen you got another person a seed that seed has a nature everybody okay that nature was predestinated and you get a nature here and you get another one both of these nature are in one body everybody good let me read it again brought upon them say bad down in there too what's another water another natural present see it was how was in there by who God in the same body see through what nature in water [Applause] everybody okay so one you knew the bad brother brother there was also another good father in the same body [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay so when you saw brother Branham doing bad stuff he said brother Branham there was also another brother everybody okay the brother Branham that was doing bad stuff was the soul everybody okay and the good brother Branham that good nature was his water but this song is not really the soul amen it is really the darkness [Applause] [Music] everybody okay it is the darkness that was his sad brother Branham hot that was doing bad stuff everybody okay [Applause] I pray God exceeds somebody so inside the soul there was also Darkness amen and this darkness is a nature everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay another word in your soul there is darkness and there is a seed the darkness is in nature and the seed is your soil and nature and you get to Nature in one body [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay so while you were yet sinner [Applause] while you are in a hotel sleeping with a woman everybody good this is 1965. so it's after the seals we don't argue with that everybody okay let me help you up a little bit let me stop and pause have I lost someone Have I Lost anybody if I lost you raise your hand and I make sure I started back again if somebody's sleeping shake his hand when I say that it means somebody's doing everybody okay brother Bruno say but damn was another nature present predestinated was in there by who in the same body how many Natures in there where I only catered water one as I grow as good as a baby Dada first thing you know I become a water lion better become everything else that is here because I was rather foul but down in there was a little water spec of life when all the time so so when you when you come on the altar out from Mama the day you were born there just United [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay because we were sharp in water we were water born in water sin sharp in water iniquity coming into the world doing water you got the nature there but in your predestinated seed there is another and how many major do you have two [Applause] everybody okay if you search the message to the best of my knowledge unless you found the court you won't see two Souls by the bottom used to Nature he didn't say do so there is one Court he said to so but he was talking about something else everybody okay Hallelujah get ready which year this is a dying spirit in a dying water body this Spirit dying in the dying water it's temporal but now you can be in two bodies say what one time that's you cannot be here and you hear remember we already went that Paul said that when I'm here in the body I am absent from the Lord I rather be absent here than what present with the law you cannot be to in this place you know and in one place brother Burnham said you can be in too bad yet the water one time but there can be what true nature in you and water one time there it is everybody okay we clear now continue brother Branham say the nature of the spirit of the Lord when you are water you are not born of physical like the baby was but what happened the spiritual Birth has what come to you the spiritual birth is coming to you everybody okay and while this spiritual birth is going well Heart Of God there is a physical body growing to receive water that Spirit when the life leaves this body goes in water when you live here you go away just as when the bad is presented to the Earth the spirit comes in when the spirit goes out of the body there is a body water so we know all we know that after this Earthly water be dissolved we have water that said the spiritual body of the water so we have established now that in one body you can have two nature the nature of your birth which is bad which is the darkness and then you have the nature that is linked or locked in the predestinated seed everybody okay so far everybody good so far and we found out that in Genesis when the Earth was created the Earth was created with water who created that God but the spirit of the Lord moved where Darkness was indeed water and Paul said in the book of Corinthians that the same way God did in the Book of Genesis he did it also to who to us in our water when he get in the heart he pushes water when he pushes darkness and when he's doing water separating everybody okay everybody okay William Marion brother now in Genesis the first chapter the spirit of God did water upon the face of the world move upon the face of the water in the beginning back there the world was without water and water there was nothing but just the water Darkness a darkness of chaos and what a horrible shape it must have been in nothing but but way into water Darkness without light or water anything the Charming of water water and the wandering water what is the star the Earth twisted around and around the orbit out there where it must have been a water terrific a terrific mass of something that is water lost like he was he couldn't water well the problem said when the Earth was created and when the Earth was in darkness it looks like the Earth was spinning Iran lost the GPS doing everything the Earth was lost what happened brother Branham say and that is what we become from the Earth to us from the Earth to us that is what we become when we become water wandering Stars away from who God just without water without water without just the water turning around out in water not knowing when where we are water foreign well there was one there was a time when the world was laying in other water Darkness it was without water and he was a Floyd and he was all covered with water water and was laying there in water the dark dark this Mile and how and the spirit of God move upon the water water and say water let there be light God had the reason to do that brother Branham now is saying when God move his son and went toward the darkness was and spoke there is a purpose for God doing that what was the purpose are you there brother Branham say foreign foreign [Applause] God put the water and over the seed you got Darkness but there is a reason why God must send you malachite for [Applause] eign [Applause] God planted the modem God blessed the seed that's why he's sending the light a rise and shine that light has water and the glory of the Lord has risen upon shalom Shalom beer peace everything is all right coming of the light is to Quicken the seed [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hey everybody okay everybody okay have I lost someone can I continue this church everybody okay everybody okay William Marion Branham in the what which message fourth seal 63 in the seals in Genesis 1 1 in the beginning God created the water Heavens now the world was Without Water full and how void brother Branham say and I said I believe every water she was laying where from some other water civilization or something [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay Paul is saying that God is coming and summing his light on our heart the same way he did it in the beginning why is God shining his light in your heart brother brother I'm saying in the beginning the reason why he shun his life is because her name is the one they were seed and God also is Coming to Your Heart To Shine the Light because inside of you in your heart there is also a seed my brother brother I'm here say that seed came from another civilization [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay the seed that God blessed in you they predestinated seed he plant on you he came from another civilization [Applause] in other words there was a civilization that already existed amen thank you everybody okay everybody good glory to God he said he came from another civilization or something and as soon as they were the water and the lights did watch us come the water tree and water everything the same thing with the water a human being is a water child when the meat has done water moved away and the reveal truth to that water it's still water and the light of the Gospel by the true affirm the casing of the water he got water life in it is he has not he has not got no life in water everybody clear everybody clear William Marion Branham the new birth the body is what you look at the spirit is what control you your soul is the what motive the motive of that spirit all the water nature [Music] so we came up with two Souls because the soul is the nature but you got to be clear what you're trying to say what two Souls what do nature one is the predestinated city the second one is the darkness that you were born under from your father and mother everybody okay brother Branham says that watch carefully now your soul is the motive of water or the nature of water they saw that the word die you are born in the world with a water sinful soul that said the nature of your spirit is how sinful you long for the things of the Water World then the Holy Ghost do what comes down the spirit of the Lord comes down and baptize you and do what changes the nature of that Spirit then the nature that is left on you is of what nothing then you profess that you are a water Pilgrim and a water then you are how born from above you are from water above you are a candidate of water you are a new water future in Christ Jesus with the same body with the same feeling only it has changed and you are and your nature of that spirit is changed from water unrighteousness to water righteous that is so body and water spirit so when God comes into you he removed the darkness away everybody okay God clean up this Darkness completely out of you by the light that is coming up and exposes the seed it's a modem then God sent the signal to the modem everybody okay and he quickened them on them and the modem is awakened everybody okay now you are you and you are and your other you isn't easy working now you are again true creature in the same flesh everybody okay everybody okay glory to God you okay brother Branham say as we were in the touch of God and then each person flesh they had to come a day when we will do water hear his voice he's worse the what the word and hearing that voice become aware of our water fathers doing what and weak on us that we are water the sons

[Applause] you heard from a TNT you heard the communication from a TNT AT&T send the signal and the modem remember because a seed and the theophany goes together when the seeds do something it is coming from the tea orphan they are like hand and the glass yeah everybody okay everybody okay look at that little woman she had water fallen from God's thoughts she could be how we did she wants water she had the water representation [Applause] she had a representation in heaven brother Branham said your body is your representation on Earth everybody everybody okay if your body is a representation on Earth and it's a body who shall be your representation on heaven [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay brother Branham say you become a water new person amen not just an old one Patcher by joining church or trying to turn a new page but you are a completely water brand new unit God takes the water oh man and water Burns him completely out [Music] with the water Holy Ghost and water fire and come where himself send down your representation no man can come to me except my father has water all that the father have given me give me will come unto to me same plan same way the same plan of the earth is the same plan of a human being [Applause] everybody okay everybody good brother Branham say not what happened when the soul is quickened when you are awake amen amen where because your Darkness was taken away amen it is called the healing of your soul up in Matthew 13. up in Matthew 13 and I'm going to run quick your representation if you dare you can say amen amen you there you there I'm gonna skip quick amen verse 15 for the people's heart is what grows and their ears are water and their eyes they have what clothes less at any time they should what with the water and here with the water and should understand with the what and should be how converted when you are understanding with your heart then you are converted and I should water heal them so the conversion is a healing to the heart everybody okay brother Branham says this he says not only to the healing of the body but the healing of the water also which is how far more essential can you give him some more volume than the healing of the water the body now it is possible that if you live long enough you get sick again because sickness the Bible say many are the Affliction of the righteous but God deliver him out of them so we have many Affliction promised by the deliverance from what says this I have been asked several times brother Branham when you going to start a healing service we have them every night we are talking about the healing of the water so right right now then we can the other would take half automatically in other words when your soul get quickened with what we just demonstrated amen when your soul is quitted when the modem is activated amen amen all the medically your TV turned on your iPad tunnel your alarm system click on your ring system click on [Applause] everybody okay brother Branham say automatically that take place as long as we can get the soul then we can have our faith if you are born again correctly automatically you have faith you will begin to use that faith for your child for your school for your work for your mother for everything in your life because you are wired now [Applause] if not you are struggling [Applause] Lord help me but let me tell you that let me tell you let me let them get the real Divine water healing the healing of the water so which making you preacher passage from deaf and to water life and then waiting in this old water for Redemption of the water body after the soul has been redeemed everybody okay let me straighten up my antenna brother Branham saying no matter in any kind of service the world should have water preeminence it should be half first and the healing of the soul is always first why when a man is Born Again of the spirit of God he's how Immortal they drop you from the lower to the upper eternal life and it shall never water perish but when a man is healed of his body it's just for a water military time but Salvation of the soul is how forever he becomes a new creature in him when he is healed of his water so everybody okay William Branham then I can run quickly Satan will be taken from the Earth just exactly laxative was taken from you everybody okay sent them cannot bother or he can do a tempt but he cannot get the water born again Christian it's finished for God from the foundation of the world first saw him and sent Jesus to the water redeem him and pray and the blood speak for him how can he sin when he can be seen even by God he don't the only thing he is is water your voice but he sees your water representation what's that so when you are sitting in prayer and you telling God here come in your presence father forgive me I was a bad boy from my child because when you tune in you activate your modem everybody okay in 18 Heaven God look up and also your mother have you ever caught the cable the cable company they will tell you your modem is not online how do they know everybody okay you have a modem when you turn on a TNT also turn on everybody okay when yours turn on father I come in your presence amen God won't be looking at you you are talking and he's hearing body talk all right everybody okay he will heal brother Charles for brother Charles brother Charles trial is natural trial everybody okay so when God when Brother David comes and he begins to speak to God God have to tune in and localize who is off for the David Kabir he pulls him up and when he pulls him up he's looking at Brother David Kabir yeah amen the one God is looking at is your theophany [Applause] because they work together when you are activated your theophany pop up amen now God sit down and begin to look at your theophany that your funny is an eternal body [Applause] can I ask you a question is sin have your tea off any sin now listen to your prayer Lord I'm a sinner I don't know if you get me God is looking at the theophany he said which sin you remember in 1992 when I stole something when I went with my my friend in the nightclub God is churching he said sir all the signals are looking good [Applause] can you disconnect the modem for five seconds and plug it back again because what we're receiving here is different than what you're telling us they

change your prayer buddy thank you let me move on let me move on everybody okay here's your water he sees your water representation man that is how true he was a leader in Fame water woman a water

there you there one for we know that if our Earthly water house our body the Bible called that how can you speak loudly please house of this water Tabernacle we were dissolved we have a water building is water do you know what a building is we have a building of God a water house made with what another a house not made with hand how Eternal in water Heaven let's stop a little bit there so etiofani is a house it is a building just like this building are we okay let's read John in my father water house how many house does the father have am I reading a different Bible how many house does the father have one house the father has one house see the intellect how are we going away from God one house then we begin to say yes there is many bedrooms that's the way we do because it's our father so you're looking at your father here with a house a house from your sister your house for your brother so that's how we look in my father has r r is which verb where I'm in which time which time it's present so when Jesus is talking no it's already there I'm going slowly in my father's house I have many mansions now how can a house have mentioned imagine is a house right everybody okay so there is a house in the house everybody okay so this mentioned are already existing because Jesus didn't say will be they are many mentioned and if he in other words they already were there if we were not so I would have what I told you in other words dimensions of the house of God already existed everybody okay I've got to prepare a place for you I thought he has a house I thought God have a house I'm just reading the scripture I thought God said he has a house amen why is he building another house foreign and and not only he has a house in his house there are many places so why is he looking for another place everybody okay in my father's house there are many water if he were not so I would have what I got to prepare a place for for you and if I go in either way that place is not there but they have the mentioned are already there and if I go and prepare a place for you I will water come again a return a coming of the Lord and receive you and to water myself that way I am there you may be what also so we found out that the house is one but Dimensions all the buildings are many many so when you get there they are building building building building building building and when you get to a place where there is many buildings many many many it is called what think this church is it a problem is it a problem a place of many mentioned is called water everybody okay everybody okay William Branham Hallelujah I never believed that heaven was a place where there is a batch of water buildings comma where there is a bunch of water houses up there comma what is slow down slow down let's read the prophet well there is a badge of water houses up there made with water mortar brother Branham didn't say there is no houses in heaven brother Branham say houses in heaven that are made with mortar I don't believe they are there he didn't say they are not houses because people don't read by the problem made with water double up with water paper on the water I never believed that air supernatural being we live in there the problem is talking about these houses I don't believe these are in heaven are we okay now we okay now he says I believe when Jesus spoke in water John 14 in my father house is many water mentioned he meant air body I'm gonna go slowly my friend a water a dwelling place because a [Music] building and it's also called a water a house everybody okay the message of William Marion Branham is perfectly in line with the scripture everybody okay he meant air body a dwelling place for the scripture verified the same if this is we have one water already being is the only one who live in water moral habitations in other words Eternal beings live in Eternal houses and eternal houses are to your family everybody okay then the place that we go in to until we return is not a place of what break or water or water clay or water precious or water it is a place of water condition that we move out of this Dimension that we live in into another dimension it's a water house a water a cabinet a water dwelling place everybody okay hold on I'm heading to the airport buddy now in John 9 14 in my father's house there are many water mentions speaking to his

bring judgment to that person do you know who you are Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly again this afternoon father thanking you for your grace for your love and for your mercy and father helping us Lord unloaded this difficult lesson now about the two Souls the two natures father anybody who is here can pinpoint in their life that they understand now that there were two of them there was a voice in them that could tell them this was wrong there was a little voice that could tell them the way you did the way you treated your friend the way you responded to your mother was not right but sometimes they struggle with it because of sin they go stubborn but they know that something bothered them and father today you just came by to remind them that all those things that happen in your life was only an indicator that you were carrier of a higher Cedar from a higher civilization and you are called to the mark of a high calling and you are my children I know you have been trapped I know you did things that were wrong I know some of them you are regretting that if I would if I could have been given opportunity to start over I would not have made such a stupid mistake I would not have been involved into that but I know everything if I know you so much that I can describe you this morning don't you think I know you're gonna go through what you went through don't you remember the man in John 9 that me purposely let him come to this world blind not because of his father but because I wanted to share something I'm not looking at what you think all the time I'm not looking at what people are saying I know what I put in you and I have confidence in you that's why I am talking to you you have been pardoned everything else has been demolished when you talk to me talk to me as a son talk to me as a daughter show me that love that I'm longing for I want to see you happy I want to see you talking to me like a strong like a young adult who is ready to take on responsibility because there are things that I could not finish yes I left it so that you can continue to do it but you're looking at what the devil is showing you I knew all about it if I would have taken care of everything that the devil have showed me about you I would not have come to you but that's not what I'm looking at I'm looking at what I have in my profile in my gallery I always seen you don't you remember the Prodigal Son do you think it's the money that I was longing for all I was looking is for a child to come back that's all I was looking for I know you would not listen to me that's why I gave you the leeway to go until you reach the pig pen and who we manage you that I was there Romeo who reminded you that the servant in my house I better fed than where you are he was that modem that I put in you I know there is no way you can go far away that's why when you coming you didn't see me in the house you saw me outside waiting because I knew you were coming father may you Quicken that Revelation to your children may you bring them back to a higher level so that they can behave like children of the king no matter the circumstances may they be like that slave with a chest up knowing that from a far land away I am a son of a king that's the best opium that can soothe anything any perplexity that the devil can bring we will not be destroyed we thank you for the patience father touch those that are sick may you heal them this morning Father Quicken those seeds that are still lingering and give them strength to overcome the things of the world because once
