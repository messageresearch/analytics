========================================

You know, I don't I only speak of the truth. When I was born in a little Kentucky cabin up there, the angel of the Lord come in the window and stood there as a pillar of fire. I said, "God has prove that. If I tell the truth, God will vindicate the truth. If I'm a liar, God will have nothing to do with me." And about that time, she went, "Here he comes." &gt;&gt; The American Photographers Association all in there look like Times collaring on them. The American photographer told they shot the picture of it said I believe it's psychology. We've seen it before but I believe and they took it home and there the lights struck the lens. They took it to George J. Lacy. They put it under everything they could and now it hangs in Washington DC in the hall of heaven. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why is it Jesus Christ with that bunch that they call holy rollers? &gt;&gt; God bless your heart. &gt;&gt; Ever famous ever. The man who painted the last supper there, it went through the hall of critics. What they criticized, it cost him his lifetime. But now it leaves in the hall of fame. It has to go through the hall of critics. Brother and sister, when we started in this what they call this Holy Ghost religion way back years ago, we had to get little old stables, somebody's house, a little storefront somewhere, and they stood on the outside. The sinners chew chewing gum last and made fun. Call us holy roars and slept in jail and everything else. That's right. They've been beat. They've been made fun of a little old preacher in my house that they turning out of sitting him and his wife to feed these babies. They sleep out in old blankets, wet blankets, and hang them up in the trees. Let them dry out of the morning and they go down the railroad track picking up a grain of corn at a time, had a little skillet. They beat it up with a rock and they live for 12 or 14 days at a time on beef corn. My old manager, God bless his heart, old brother Bosworth, laying down in Derban, Africa tonight, praying for me to come there, laid down in Texas with his back beat into stripes when he threatened to cut his throat and everything else when he walked with a broken wrist trying to pack his suitcase beat for preaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins and destituted in desert places of whom the world is not worthy to receive. The big churches made fun, pointed their fingers. They said we were holy rollers when I built the laid the cornerstone there. They said they'll turn that little old thing into a garage. It's been 20 years ago and the Holy Ghost still lives here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And what they said was fanaticism and everything. Kings and monarchs across the world has called. Great man has been healed. The powers of God has swept the world around. done. Now we stand millions strong. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One of these mornings she's went through the critics. They said it would burn out. They said to me down here said, "Oh, Billy, you lost your mind." That's all there is to it. Even my own mother-in-law said, "Wow, the boy's gone crazy." But if I am, I'm having a wonderful time. Let me tell you something, brother. Listen to this. I say this with respect. Hallelujah. All hell can't stop [screaming] it. It's ordained of Jesus Christ to be. So it will be upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. &gt;&gt; How? What is it? What kind of a church? Fresh and blood has not revealed it to thee, Peter. But my father which is in heaven is revealed to you. Spiritual revelation by the Holy Ghost of the word of God. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Can we stand this morning? We want to go to the Lord for a few minutes uh one on- one with in prayer and then um we'll pray together at the end [music] and uh start the soul service. Amen. It's good to see her.

So we were asking travel mercy for them. Got one from sister um Katrina Allen here too. Please keep sister Ununice Lopy's cousin William Museay in prayer. Uh he's not doing well. It doesn't it doesn't elaborate. So um it means a lot to her. So, let's remember um her cousin. I think she's traveling to DC to be with him in a little bit this morning uh or today. So, she's asking for traveling mercy also on her trip home. Uh she went up to see them and uh just asked to keep my wife in prayer. I speak to her occasionally and you know through texts and calls on WhatsApp and um it seems like it's it's um turning more spiritual now than um just the physical the physical is still there and the strain and uh you know but um trying to if anybody can help me we're trying to find uh the messages on YouTube translated into Spanish. I don't know if she can um maybe get on the table. I don't know. I know it comes in different languages written in written form, but I don't know if it will read them out in Spanish. If it does, I'll suggest that. But, um, I found one, but it wasn't an interpretation like brother Brandham spoke and then the man interpreted it. So, I don't know how accurate it was because it was just him, you know, speaking Spanish. So, I don't know that um it was the rapture, the one that I sent her. So, That's wonderful. Let's stand this morning. Amen. Got one more here. Good. Oh, is this big brother? Your dad. Okay. It's brother Polycarp's birthday today. Amen. He's walking in now. [applause] Praise God.

[laughter] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe we are all up to date with the sermon. We reading our Bible twice a day.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Glenn, you let us know for next year when is the question and answer. Sister ROF, check that noise on the monitor. Our question and answer for next year on the first quarterly uh uh question and answer for next year, he will let us know. The young man apologized, but this is not something that we we did. This is this was a major event that happened for uh brother Charles Anderson. That's an elder right there. So there is no way you can go around it. We have to cancel everything. But to the best of my understanding, brother Tony got you all schedule. Everything is working for November 8th. And I was told that you needed another one so to avoid the lap. So you got November 8th, which is a Saturday, and December 6th, which is a Saturday. So you got backto back so we don't give you uh a big gap between the two. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord help us. We we were able to sleep in with some of the folks to give support to brother Charles Anderson. It's not easy to lose a pastor's wife. It's something that is hurting not only the family, but it hurts the church, especially if uh she was a good one like sister. She was very very good. When you hear the testimonies and everything, it's a big loss for the church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we had to be there. I went there. We do you you talking about the funeral service. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I was sitting I wonder it looks like the Lord went to confirm to us everything we were preaching here. [screaming and laughter] Even the court &gt;&gt; 100% &gt;&gt; even the quotes that were coming up &gt;&gt; even the scripture Ecclesiastes 3:1 there is a season and there is a purpose and I will see you should hear your pastor hollering amen [laughter] &gt;&gt; what an encouragement and a confirmation I look at I I went after service to brother Jackson I say thank you very much I had to uh chat a little bit with brother Charles. So keep him in prayer and usually when a lot of people are there you strong and when the crowd begin to dwindle and you stay alone I mean alone then the memories begin to come back. So just keep him in prayer. I was not able to go to the repass. I just went all the way to the cemetery and have to leave the cemetery and hit the highway and to come back because I have to be prepared for today. But God was gracious that we were able to do it. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the married couple meeting will be part eight. It's in December the 13th. We go on finances the second part. And also remember our Tuesday's prayer. If you never been there, hop on the line. It is so good. Again, it's at 7:00. Remember to send to brother John or brother set all the requests before 5. So we get ready and we see you again at 7:00. And not only 7:00, we already inserted a a five minute time to pray here in the church before services. So those who come late, you are missing all that opportunity. So learn to be in church on time. So you can also get that opportunity to pray before the service. And if you didn't pray at home, there is a I'm in a space here that have been given to you. But Tuesday again at 7:00, it's uh it's our prayer service. And I begin to know some of the invisible audience. I never seen their faces and we see them. It's a lot of people online on Tuesday. Visible and invisible audience. It's a tremendous blessing. Sister Rosemary sent me a message saying that she's uh she's having now the luxury of yawning. [laughter] &gt;&gt; You heard her saying amen. Amen. When I heard the testimony, I told my wife, I say I was not even aware she was going through TMJ and everything. Oh my God, I know exactly what is going on. But God healing you, that's a miracle because the majority of the time, these are hard things to handle. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These are very, very hard things to handle. I've seen people going through surgeries and surgeries and the oral surgeon and it's still not working. &gt;&gt; So I I'm a dentist, [laughter] &gt;&gt; so I know exactly what I'm talking about. But to see her being delivered without a surgery and not even wearing a mouth guard, praise God. God is a miracle working God. Amen. Let's give God a big clap of [applause] amen. Amen. Amen. The building project, it's miracle after miracle. So you pray God the calling. It seems like we got a load of rain on Tuesday, but we need to go through the inspection on Tuesday. So let's go like Elijah pray so the rain can stop so they can do not only the inspection but we pass the inspection so he open up the way so they can pour whatever they need to pour there and we sore and uh keep moving so keep praying keep uh contributing keep uh praying for us and everything so everything continue to move smooth but I know I didn't start it it's God who started and God will take care of it amen &gt;&gt; I was uh communing with brother uh Glenn and we were uh uh fellowshipping, he called me uh contacted me, send me a a a question about Esther. And while I was talking to him, verifying it because I tried to avoid it and suddenly I found it, I say, "Oh my god, here was something that was missed from last Sunday. So, I'm just going to give it to you and then we move on." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You You need to say amen because we're going to get into some hard stuff today. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; In the book of Esther, Esther 2:5, the Bible says now in what? &gt;&gt; Shushan the palace &gt;&gt; which was like 250 miles away from Babylon &gt;&gt; because Babylon was taken over by the Persian and then and Daniel was both in Babylon and with King Cyus.

Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says to dress it and to do what? &gt;&gt; Keep it. &gt;&gt; So God gave man a divine responsibility. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I had a quote.

Go to who? &gt;&gt; The ant. &gt;&gt; You who? &gt;&gt; Slugger. &gt;&gt; You know what it means? &gt;&gt; It means what? &gt;&gt; You lazy. A man. And consider its ways and be what? &gt;&gt; Wise. &gt;&gt; You already understand this. We went through this. &gt;&gt; Which have what? No guide. &gt;&gt; You know what he means? Or what? &gt;&gt; Overseer. &gt;&gt; Or what? &gt;&gt; Ruler. &gt;&gt; Nobody to supervise them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse eight. Provide her meat when &gt;&gt; in the summer. &gt;&gt; And gather her food when &gt;&gt; in the harvest. &gt;&gt; So when it's harvest, [clears throat] when it's a harvest or when it's summer, the ant does two things. &gt;&gt; Number one, it's enjoying the season. &gt;&gt; But it's also preparing another season. through work. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Proverb 30. &gt;&gt; Today you're moving very good. Praise God. Proverb 30. &gt;&gt; If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Proverb 30:24. Why are you talking about the ant again? Brother Brandham says this in the message. a man running from the presence of the Lord after the seal. He says sometime we find ourself what &gt;&gt; prone &gt;&gt; to do what? run from work. &gt;&gt; I'm reading, brother. Brand &gt;&gt; I don't want to work. &gt;&gt; Oh god. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; My friend, this is the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah. Sometime we find oursel prone to do what? &gt;&gt; From work. &gt;&gt; We don't want to. We don't want to work. &gt;&gt; Some people just think they can make their living without what? &gt;&gt; Working. But I think Solomon was that said we could find here the answer. The answer in watching who &gt;&gt; in ant. &gt;&gt; So the answer about working is where &gt;&gt; in the ant. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say you know a little ant they tell me if that every ant does not work and laying that ant does not eat water &gt;&gt; that winter. &gt;&gt; So everybody has to do what? &gt;&gt; Work. &gt;&gt; Let me start again. Amen. &gt;&gt; Did he say some people? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Who should be working? &gt;&gt; Everybody. &gt;&gt; Everybody should work. &gt;&gt; And according to the ant, if you don't work, you don't eat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, don't feed the lazy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we will help you the first time, the second time, the third time, you need to go back to work. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. Unless you are disabled, we understand we will help you. But if you have two feet and everything is working, go to work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Proverb 30 verse 24. That's why I'm reading the ant because of this quote. &gt;&gt; Verse 24, he says, "There be four things which are what? &gt;&gt; Little upon the earth." If you look at the ant is not strong, &gt;&gt; it's very little. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the ant got more excuse than you. &gt;&gt; The ant got more excuse than you. &gt;&gt; The ant can say look how skinny I am. &gt;&gt; Look how little I am. &gt;&gt; But the Bible say the ant. Amen. &gt;&gt; There be four things which are little upon the earth. But they are what? &gt;&gt; Exceeding wise. So the wisdom of the ant is what make the ant different. &gt;&gt; And what is that wisdom? Verse uh 20 uh 25 the ant are a are a people what &gt;&gt; not strong. &gt;&gt; So strength is not an excuse &gt;&gt; not to work. &gt;&gt; You cannot say I don't I I I cannot work because I'm not strong. weak. &gt;&gt; That should not be an excuse. &gt;&gt; Or I'm always weak. That should not be be an excuse because the ant are not strong. &gt;&gt; But the ant are working &gt;&gt; and the answer to work is at the end. &gt;&gt; And the one who wrote the book of proverb is Solomon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The one who wrote the book of proverb is Solomon. So the wisdom of God in Solomon is sending us to the end &gt;&gt; and the end is sending you back to Genesis &gt;&gt; where work is divine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; If we kill a deer &gt;&gt; and we bring you a deer, &gt;&gt; it's a blessing. &gt;&gt; If we put a deer and give it to you and you keep watching the deer there, &gt;&gt; after a while you will spo the deer. That's right. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to get some work on the deh. &gt;&gt; So, the blessing came, but you got to work on the blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the blessing to become a blessing. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to come up from the airport. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Let me start it again. &gt;&gt; All right. Glory. &gt;&gt; Let me start it again. Let me start it again. &gt;&gt; Lord, give me food. &gt;&gt; Yes.

It will kill you if this was strong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go. First king chapter 3. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're talking about the age of Solomon. All this instruction about the end came from Solomon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is Solomon telling us what to do. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The message of brother Brandham have an answer to everything. &gt;&gt; And the message of brother Brandham affect every every area in our life &gt;&gt; and teach us how to dress, how to talk, how to respond, how to cook, how to treat our wife, how to treat our children, how to go to school and not cheat. Everything we got quote and quote and quote. So all your life is in the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh first Kings chapter 3 verse 4. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you had a hard time with what I'm saying now, you're going to really get it. &gt;&gt; Verse four. And the king went to &gt;&gt; Gibon. &gt;&gt; This is Solomon. to sacrifice there for that was the great high place. A what? &gt;&gt; A thousand burnt offerings. &gt;&gt; Did who? &gt;&gt; Solomon. &gt;&gt; So Solomon gave how many burnt offerings? &gt;&gt; A thousand. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; A $1,000. [groaning] Amen. A,000 burnt offering did Solomon offer upon what? &gt;&gt; That altar. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Verse five. In Gibian, the Lord appeared to Solomon when &gt;&gt; in a dream by night. &gt;&gt; So God talked to Solomon when Solomon was sleeping. &gt;&gt; God didn't appear to him like this. &gt;&gt; The Bible say he appeared to him how? &gt;&gt; In a dream. &gt;&gt; So there was another Solomon awaken when one Solomon was sleeping. &gt;&gt; Take your time, brother. Come on. &gt;&gt; We already went through this. &gt;&gt; There is two you in you. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a spirit you &gt;&gt; and the spirit uses your brain &gt;&gt; and reason and everything. &gt;&gt; But there is a you call your soul. &gt;&gt; That's the one you see in the dream. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because in the dream you are talking. You are even fighting. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But yet you are sleeping. The first you is sleeping but the other you is fighting with demon. &gt;&gt; The one who's fighting is your soul. &gt;&gt; And he looks like you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we have a sympathetic and parasympathetic. &gt;&gt; The sympathetic is the one that work with your brain. &gt;&gt; When you see danger, you run away. &gt;&gt; Are we together? But when you sleeping, you don't see danger. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if somebody bring uh fire, you will see yourself moving and they tell you in the morning I was closer to your bed. You say when did you come in my bed? &gt;&gt; But how did you move from the fire when you were unconscious? &gt;&gt; There was another you that is awaken and that is supervising everything &gt;&gt; and that you never even sleep &gt;&gt; because he's the one responsible for your respiration. &gt;&gt; You don't operate the way you are breathing. You don't operate the way the food are digested in your body. There is another you who's controlling all those things. He works in your unconscious part and your brain work in your conscious part. &gt;&gt; So God now is talking to the unconscious part of Solomon. &gt;&gt; Not the conscious part of Solomon. I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not the intelligence but the soul &gt;&gt; as a man thinking with in in what? &gt;&gt; His heart. So you can think with your brain or with your heart. &gt;&gt; So God is talking to Solomon when the first conscience is sleeping &gt;&gt; but the second or the subconscious is up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Solomon answer God &gt;&gt; when Solomon was sleeping. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? If I lost you raise your hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the scripture my friend. &gt;&gt; Verse five. In Gibon the Lord appeared to who? &gt;&gt; Solomon. &gt;&gt; When? in a dream by night. &gt;&gt; And God say what? &gt;&gt; Ask what I shall give thee. &gt;&gt; God appeared to Solomon. Follow me very carefully. &gt;&gt; And God told Solomon after the offering. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't say amen. After the offering. &gt;&gt; Uh for those who don't want God say ask everything you want. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ask what you want and I will give it to you. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? Amen. &gt;&gt; This is Solomon's soul reacting. &gt;&gt; Verse six. And Solomon say you uh drop to verse seven so we save time. And now, oh Lord God, Lord my God, you have made who? &gt;&gt; Thy servant &gt;&gt; David what? &gt;&gt; King &gt;&gt; instead of thy father. Amen. And I am but a little child. &gt;&gt; I know not how to go out or how to what &gt;&gt; or come in. &gt;&gt; In other words, I'm very immature. I don't know how to handle stuff. &gt;&gt; Verse uh uh uh 8. And your servant is in the midst of your people which you have chosen a a people that is how &gt;&gt; great &gt;&gt; that cannot be what &gt;&gt; number &gt;&gt; no counted for water &gt;&gt; multitude. &gt;&gt; So the promise of Abraham is now fulfilled naturally. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Because God told Abraham your seed will not be able to be numbered. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this promise is already fulfilled right here. &gt;&gt; Jump to verse uh uh &gt;&gt; nine. Give therefore your servant what? &gt;&gt; An understanding. &gt;&gt; So what did Solomon ask God? &gt;&gt; Understanding. &gt;&gt; Solomon. Ask God for what? &gt;&gt; Understanding. &gt;&gt; Understanding and what? &gt;&gt; A heart. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And what? &gt;&gt; To jud to judge the people. In other word, he asked wisdom. &gt;&gt; Which brother Brandham call discernment. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; God ask Solomon, what do you want? &gt;&gt; Solomon say, I got a big responsibility. I want you to give me wisdom. Are we together? &gt;&gt; He says in verse 9, give therefore your servant an understanding how to do what? &gt;&gt; Judge thy people. So he was asking wisdom for the purpose of who? &gt;&gt; Judging the people. &gt;&gt; For the purpose of the people. Follow me my friend. &gt;&gt; For the purpose of the people. &gt;&gt; Not his own purpose. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; For the purpose of the people. &gt;&gt; He says to judge your people &gt;&gt; that I may discern between what? &gt;&gt; Good and bad. &gt;&gt; Good and bad. For who is able to do what? to judge this thy so great a people. &gt;&gt; So the people are so great. Are we together? &gt;&gt; And the speech pleased what? &gt;&gt; The Lord. &gt;&gt; Remember Solomon is talking to God, but Solomon is sleeping. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; Are we clear? &gt;&gt; And the speech pleased the Lord that Solomon has what? &gt;&gt; Ask this thing. &gt;&gt; And God say unto him, because you have asked what? &gt;&gt; This thing. &gt;&gt; Wisdom. &gt;&gt; Come on. and have not asked for yourself what &gt;&gt; long life. &gt;&gt; Push the brake. So now God begin to tell us things that Solomon did not ask. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Solomon asked what? &gt;&gt; Wisdom. &gt;&gt; Solomon asked for something that is spiritual. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now God is bringing to Solomon things that he did not ask. &gt;&gt; So let's see what God is talking to Solomon. &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God says what? You didn't ask what? &gt;&gt; Long life. &gt;&gt; Long life. &gt;&gt; And what else? &gt;&gt; Riches for thyself. &gt;&gt; Riches for what? &gt;&gt; Thyself. &gt;&gt; Now I have a question. Who spoke about money? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Answer me please. Who spoke about riches? God. &gt;&gt; God. Solomon is asking for spiritual things. &gt;&gt; And God is bringing counter things. &gt;&gt; I already warn you. I already warn you. &gt;&gt; I already warn you. &gt;&gt; Put your seat belt. &gt;&gt; So who is spiritual &gt;&gt; and who is carnal? Answer me. Answer me. Answer. Spoken word. If not, we stop. I go home. &gt;&gt; I need also a break. &gt;&gt; If not, I go home. &gt;&gt; If you don't answer, I go home. &gt;&gt; Ah, answer me. &gt;&gt; Who? &gt;&gt; No problem. What is your prayer? Lord Jesus Christ, give me wisdom so I know how to how to serve you, how to walk with you. When we come, we listen to the uh uh speaker say this is a wonderful sister. &gt;&gt; She's a spiritual sister. &gt;&gt; She's a Christian. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is the kind of sister we want. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. But if you hear sister teaser saying Lord give me finances only kind of things. You need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You will never be able to fight me. I'm in the Bible. I'm in the word. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Did Solomon ask for money? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; So who brought the subject of money? Yeah. &gt;&gt; So why God is bringing something that is bad? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Push the brake. &gt;&gt; Remember remember I already warned you five times. So don't start problem with me. &gt;&gt; Don't don't start problem with me. &gt;&gt; Uh this is uh hold on some of them are put here to keep your seat belt where you are. &gt;&gt; Let's read this &gt;&gt; because the king and the chronicle are the same. But one give you more detail. &gt;&gt; We need to investigate this riches. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Who talk about money? &gt;&gt; So who is corner? &gt;&gt; God forbid. &gt;&gt; God forbid. &gt;&gt; You see now message believer chill out. &gt;&gt; Chill out. Let's go, my friend. &gt;&gt; In 2 Chronicles &gt;&gt; 1 &gt;&gt; verse what? &gt;&gt; 11. &gt;&gt; Verse what? &gt;&gt; 12. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And God said to Solomon, "Because this was what &gt;&gt; in thine heart &gt;&gt; and thou has asked not what? &gt;&gt; Riches, &gt;&gt; nor what? &gt;&gt; Now we are including not riches but also what? &gt;&gt; Wealth." &gt;&gt; Who spoke that &gt;&gt; Can I use this here? &gt;&gt; Can I use this here? God God is bringing options. What is the option? &gt;&gt; Riches, &gt;&gt; long life &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; Riches. &gt;&gt; Riches. Ah, God. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; Wealth. &gt;&gt; Are you sure? &gt;&gt; Me I wrote because the Bible says so. &gt;&gt; Can I continue? He says riches and what? &gt;&gt; Wealth. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; Honor. &gt;&gt; But the brother will fall. &gt;&gt; Don't worry. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Honor. &gt;&gt; Go ahead, my friend. And what? &gt;&gt; Nor the life of thine enemies. &gt;&gt; The life of what? &gt;&gt; Thine enemies. &gt;&gt; So Solomon already had enemies. &gt;&gt; Life of what? &gt;&gt; Enemies. Who's bringing this option? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Uh, let's go again. And then what? &gt;&gt; Neither yet has asked the long life. &gt;&gt; The long life is there, but have asked what? &gt;&gt; Wisdom &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; Knowledge for &gt;&gt; that thou may judge [snorts] my people. &gt;&gt; Over whom I have what? &gt;&gt; May thee king. &gt;&gt; Let's stop right there. So God is telling Solomon, you are a good boy. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; You ask spiritual things. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; But you didn't ask riches. &gt;&gt; You didn't ask wealth. &gt;&gt; That's correct. So basically the conclusion is this stuff I'm not going to give it to you but let's see what God does. &gt;&gt; Verse 12, wisdom and water. &gt;&gt; Knowledge is granted unto thee. &gt;&gt; This is what Solomon asked. &gt;&gt; Come on. And I will give thee what? &gt;&gt; Riches. &gt;&gt; So who gave Solomon riches? &gt;&gt; God. But brother, prosperity will make somebody to fall. &gt;&gt; Let's continue. He gave him what? &gt;&gt; Riches &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; And wealth &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; And honor &gt;&gt; such as none of the king &gt;&gt; have had that was what &gt;&gt; been before thee. &gt;&gt; And neither shall be one &gt;&gt; after thee. &gt;&gt; So what type of wealth did Solomon get? &gt;&gt; Great rich. In other words, no king &gt;&gt; can be compared to Solomon. &gt;&gt; Even before Solomon and after Solomon, no king can be compared to Solomon. &gt;&gt; In riches &gt;&gt; and in what? &gt;&gt; And in what? &gt;&gt; Who gave her to him? [cheering] &gt;&gt; I already told you, you're going to have a hard time swallowing. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But did Solomon ask this? &gt;&gt; So who is Connor? &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, let me let me show you the prayer of Solomon. When Solomon was praying, okay, so you see the difference between Solomon and God. Solomon when he was praying in the book of Proverb 30, Solomon said, "Two things have I what?" &gt;&gt; required of thee. &gt;&gt; Then deny me them not before I do what &gt;&gt; I die. &gt;&gt; What do you want? Remove far from me vanity and lies. &gt;&gt; Give me neither what? &gt;&gt; Poverty nor riches. &gt;&gt; This is Solomon heart. &gt;&gt; But that one was not Solomon heart. That was God's heart. &gt;&gt; According to Solomon, don't give me riches. Don't give me poverty. Give me balance. But according to God, I'm going to give you riches &gt;&gt; that no one has it before you &gt;&gt; and even after you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can I continue? He said, "Give me neither what? &gt;&gt; Poverty, &gt;&gt; nor what? &gt;&gt; Riches. &gt;&gt; Feed me with the food that is what? &gt;&gt; Convenient for me." &gt;&gt; Oh, this is what we want. Brother Steven, lest I be what? &gt;&gt; Fool. &gt;&gt; And do what? &gt;&gt; Deny thee. &gt;&gt; So there is a possibility to deny God when you full and say, "Who is the Lord?" And lest I be what? &gt;&gt; Poor. &gt;&gt; So poverty also have a danger. Yes. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is wrong? &gt;&gt; When I say when I say riches has a has a has a has a has a danger. All of you were cheering. &gt;&gt; And now when I say poverty, you are backing up now. No, you need to say amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; This message, &gt;&gt; the message of brother Brandham, &gt;&gt; huh? &gt;&gt; The message of brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; When you want to preach this message, &gt;&gt; like I was born in Africa, &gt;&gt; you got to take Africa culture &gt;&gt; because if you don't pay attention, you will put a little bit the African &gt;&gt; or you will put a little bit the American. You got to die &gt;&gt; to yourself &gt;&gt; and deliver the man of [screaming] God. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you following me. Don't deliver your preference. We don't want your preference. [cheering] &gt;&gt; If you grew up poor, you want everybody to be poor. If you grow up rich, you want everybody to be rich. We don't need your background. &gt;&gt; Give us the background of the world. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you see a pastor who was stingy, if he's not careful, everything stingy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you go one way. A pastor who's just liberal, liberal, he don't pay attention. Everything liberal. No, no, no, no. We want the middle of the road. &gt;&gt; We don't want to go there. We don't want to go there. Let's stay zero in. [cheering] Sweet Lord. [applause] &gt;&gt; Sweet Lord. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Riches is bad. &gt;&gt; So why did God give Solomon? Did Solomon ask for it? &gt;&gt; So in other words, it looks like it's God who push him to fall. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Because how can you blame Solomon &gt;&gt; when he didn't ask for it? &gt;&gt; And when he's asking God, he say, I don't want you to give me riches. Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope now I'm I'm I'm opening your canon. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm unclogging some channels. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you quote brother Brandham, &gt;&gt; quote everything. &gt;&gt; Don't get certain quote and keep certain. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Prosperity will lead people to uh uh I mean uh I mean uh I mean uh go astray. Amen. Quote that sir &gt;&gt; but also quote s &gt;&gt; brother Brham say prosperity is a blessing if it's handled right &gt;&gt; quote that as well &gt;&gt; bring both coats &gt;&gt; bring both of them &gt;&gt; don't go in one area and then you leave the no no bring us both &gt;&gt; Amen &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; amend Go to the message. &gt;&gt; Okay, it's a homework. Go search where brother Brham is saying. Prosperity is not a sign that God is with you. &gt;&gt; We are quick to read that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Prosperity is not Hallelujah. No, no, no, no, no. Slow down. &gt;&gt; You already been trained in this church to slow down. &gt;&gt; Slow down. &gt;&gt; Look who is brother referring to. Amen. &gt;&gt; You will see brother is talking about Jeroboam &gt;&gt; about Ahab &gt;&gt; and most of them they are bad king sir &gt;&gt; you won't see brother I'm showing you Solomon &gt;&gt; I'm going to get I know some of you are quiet but I I'm I'm loaded here. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? So before you go quick stop read a little bit. Brother Brham is talking about Micaiah in the time when a king is bad. That's why brother Brandham was showing that prosperity of that nation was not a sign that God was with them &gt;&gt; because God they rejected the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Bible said Jesus was how &gt;&gt; the Bible I gave it to you. Jesus was what? And he made himself what? &gt;&gt; So that you can become what? &gt;&gt; Why is that scripture in the Bible? &gt;&gt; Put everything together. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Bring everything together. &gt;&gt; So we know what to do. &gt;&gt; If not, we are confused. &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God gave Solomon what? Riches and what? &gt;&gt; And what &gt;&gt; like nobody before him. And what &gt;&gt; honor? He's going to have uh uh uh what? Uh what? Popularity. &gt;&gt; There you go. There you go. Take your time. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So let's go back to our scripture. Where we were, my friend? &gt;&gt; Where we were, my friend? I feel anointed. Let's move. Where are we? Verse 11. And God said to him, because you have not asked what? You have asked this thing and have not asked for yourself what? &gt;&gt; Neither have asked what &gt;&gt; riches. &gt;&gt; In the book of Chronicle, he say riches and wealth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Riches for yourself, nor ask what? &gt;&gt; The life of thine enemies. &gt;&gt; But have asked yourself what? &gt;&gt; Understanding. &gt;&gt; To do what? &gt;&gt; To discern judgment. &gt;&gt; To discern judgment. Behold, I have done according to what? &gt;&gt; Thy words. &gt;&gt; Continue, my friend. &gt;&gt; Lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; So that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. &gt;&gt; Stop. Now who knows Solomon fall? I mean fell. &gt;&gt; Who knows that? Say amen. &gt;&gt; So my question was why did what made Solomon fall? Was there money? &gt;&gt; If it's money, money came from God. &gt;&gt; Take your time right now. &gt;&gt; I'm going with you. &gt;&gt; If Solomon fell for riches, &gt;&gt; who gave him the riches? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; So God gave him something that will make him fall. &gt;&gt; Can you preach with me? &gt;&gt; If it's worth, so God gave him a wealth. He knows he's going to fall with him. &gt;&gt; Glory, glory, glory. &gt;&gt; Let's refocus our lessons. &gt;&gt; What made Solomon fall? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But before we refocus, who gave Solomon wealth? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Who gave him riches? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; We clear on that one? &gt;&gt; Are we clear? &gt;&gt; Are we clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What made Solomon to fall? According to Deuteronomy 17:17, follow me, my friend. &gt;&gt; The Bible say in verse 16, talking about the the the the laws that govern a king. &gt;&gt; Because God told Israel, when you have a king, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is how a king should behave. &gt;&gt; This is before even Saul, &gt;&gt; before David, before any king. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. &gt;&gt; It's in the book of Deuteronomy. This was under Moses. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the Bible say, "But he shall not what?" &gt;&gt; Multiply horses to himself. &gt;&gt; So the king must not multiply what? &gt;&gt; Horses. &gt;&gt; And I have a scripture where Solomon was getting more horses. &gt;&gt; But you don't get horses for free. &gt;&gt; You get horses with what? &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; And who gave him the money? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Push the brake. Let's continue. The Bible says, "But he shall not multiply water, &gt;&gt; horses to himself, &gt;&gt; nor cause the people to return what &gt;&gt; to Egypt." &gt;&gt; Solomon was getting horses from Egypt and from cure &gt;&gt; two places. It's in your Bible. &gt;&gt; Follow me, my my friend. This is the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To the end that he should multiply what? &gt;&gt; For as much as No cause the people to go to Egypt. For as much as the Lord has say unto you, ye shall henceforth water. &gt;&gt; Return no more that way. &gt;&gt; So you cannot multiply horses and cause the people to go where? &gt;&gt; To Egypt. &gt;&gt; That was the first requirement of a king. Verse 17. What is the next one? &gt;&gt; Neither shall he multiply wives to himself. &gt;&gt; The king must now multiply what? &gt;&gt; Wives. &gt;&gt; Only one. Sister, Sharon. Are we together? Only one. &gt;&gt; The king shall not multiply what? &gt;&gt; Wives to himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; That his heart turn not away. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; If you multiply wife, what is the danger? &gt;&gt; Your heart will turn &gt;&gt; the heart of the king, the heart of that king will turn away from God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And what else, my friend? &gt;&gt; Neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold. &gt;&gt; He cannot multiply what? &gt;&gt; Silver and gold. &gt;&gt; Silver and water. &gt;&gt; Gold. &gt;&gt; Now, who gave Solomon money? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; But God say the king shall not multiply silver and gold. &gt;&gt; I'm asking you. But the wealth of Solomon, no one has it before &gt;&gt; and no one after him. &gt;&gt; So who's breaking the commandment? &gt;&gt; God forbid. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; What was the problem of Solomon? &gt;&gt; Was there horses? &gt;&gt; Was there silver and gold? Because it was God that gave it to him. &gt;&gt; Let's see. What was the trouble of Solomon? Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's We are on first king 4. Let's go to first king uh 11. &gt;&gt; I'm still reading the Bible. &gt;&gt; If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; First king 11. If we we will stay in the book of first king for a while. So keep first king. Don't move. Stay put. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse one. But king who? Solomon &gt;&gt; loved what? &gt;&gt; Many strange women. &gt;&gt; So which commandment did he break? &gt;&gt; Wives. &gt;&gt; Which commandment did Solomon break? &gt;&gt; Multiply wives. &gt;&gt; Wives. And what is the consequences? &gt;&gt; Heart will turn away. &gt;&gt; You won't see where they are condemning Solomon for gold and silver. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know. I know. I know it sounds like a new Bible. &gt;&gt; Let's go, my friend. He said, "Strange woman together with who?" &gt;&gt; The daughter of Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; Women of what? &gt;&gt; The Moabites. &gt;&gt; And who? &gt;&gt; Ammonites. &gt;&gt; And who? &gt;&gt; And who? &gt;&gt; Zidonians. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; In other words, the brother went into the world. &gt;&gt; Very deep. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He got a united state of women. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse two. Uh, can I continue? Verse two, all of the nation concerning what? &gt;&gt; Which the Lord said unto the children of Israel, &gt;&gt; uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Ye shall not go into them, &gt;&gt; neither shall they come where? &gt;&gt; In unto you, &gt;&gt; for surely they will do what? &gt;&gt; Turn away your heart after their God. &gt;&gt; So what was the problem? Which commandment did Solomon break? &gt;&gt; Multiply wise. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He says Solomon clung to this what? &gt;&gt; In love. &gt;&gt; In love. And he had what? &gt;&gt; 700 wives, &gt;&gt; brother. Princesses and what? &gt;&gt; 300 concubines. &gt;&gt; I don't know how he was living. Amen. &gt;&gt; And his wife turned away what? &gt;&gt; His heart &gt;&gt; because he was that safe. The Lord &gt;&gt; when he broke the commandment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The the the consequences must come. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. What I'm trying to do, I'm trying to separate God blessing from the fall of Solomon. &gt;&gt; That's what I Because we mix, we say, "No, no, no. Because Solomon have money." Uh-uh. The money came from God. &gt;&gt; Let's separate things correctly. &gt;&gt; Correctly. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Job to verse uh let me skip quickly here. Job to verse uh uh nine. Let's go, my friend. &gt;&gt; And the Lord was angry with Solomon. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Because his heart was turned. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. He was angry because of the money. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Read very good. &gt;&gt; Because his heart was &gt;&gt; No, no, no. He was No, no, no, no. Let's read very good. He was angry because of the money that he got. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Ah, so he was not money. &gt;&gt; Oh, God was angry because of what? &gt;&gt; His heart was turned from the Lord God. The heart was turned as a consequences to the commandment of Moses. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; For because his heart was turned from the Lord God of what? &gt;&gt; Israel. &gt;&gt; Which appeared to him what? &gt;&gt; Twice. &gt;&gt; And had commanded him concerning what? &gt;&gt; This thing &gt;&gt; that he should not go what? &gt;&gt; After other gods. &gt;&gt; But he kept not the commandment which the Lord what? &gt;&gt; Had commanded. &gt;&gt; So God already warned Solomon. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. about idolatry. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But Solomon went the way of a women. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what caused Solomon to fall. &gt;&gt; And as a confirmation again in the book of Nehemiah 13 26 Nehemiah say did not who? &gt;&gt; Solomon &gt;&gt; king of Israel sin by what? &gt;&gt; These things. &gt;&gt; We need to know what are these things. He say among many nation was there what? No king like him &gt;&gt; who was beloved of what? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; God loved him so much and God made him what? &gt;&gt; King over all Israel. &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, even him did what? &gt;&gt; Outlandish woman to sin. &gt;&gt; So the problem of Solomon was the women. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But not money because his money came from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His wealth came from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; If it's the money, then God made a mistake. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have a problem swallowing this, you need to swallow this one. &gt;&gt; In the book of Job, &gt;&gt; I'm going slowly. &gt;&gt; Ah, in the book of Jo I don't know. I know somebody's sitting waiting. Where did brother Brham? I'm going to give you brother Brham. &gt;&gt; Let's go. In the book of Job verse what? &gt;&gt; One &gt;&gt; chapter one verse8. And the Lord say unto who? &gt;&gt; Satan. &gt;&gt; What did he say to Satan? Has thou considered who? &gt;&gt; My servant Job. &gt;&gt; So according to God, Job is who? &gt;&gt; His servant. &gt;&gt; Job. Is who? &gt;&gt; His servant. &gt;&gt; Servant of the Lord. Continue my friend &gt;&gt; that there is none like him in the earth. &gt;&gt; There is no one like Job on the earth. No one like Job &gt;&gt; in the earth. &gt;&gt; Continue my friend. &gt;&gt; A perfect and an upright man. &gt;&gt; Job is how &gt;&gt; a perfect &gt;&gt; a perfect &gt;&gt; and how? &gt;&gt; An upright man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Job is perfect.

So God is testifying of Job. &gt;&gt; He said Job is perfect &gt;&gt; in the blood of bulls and goat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus was not here. &gt;&gt; This is the blood of bulls and goat. &gt;&gt; But Job was found how? &gt;&gt; Perfect. &gt;&gt; Nobody like Job on the earth. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Job is too evil &gt;&gt; and God is telling the devil. &gt;&gt; Now listen to what the devil say. &gt;&gt; The devil say and Satan answer the Lord and say do job fe [screaming] God for nothing. &gt;&gt; In other words, the devil is telling God there is a reason why &gt;&gt; Job is a perfect man. There is a reason why Job is a good man. &gt;&gt; There is a reason why Job is unique. &gt;&gt; There is a reason why Job is serving you. &gt;&gt; Therefore, what is the reason? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; The devil say has thou not made a what? &gt;&gt; And hedge about him &gt;&gt; about what? &gt;&gt; His house &gt;&gt; and about what? &gt;&gt; All that he hath on every side.

And then he says, "Thou has what? &gt;&gt; Blessed the work of his hands." &gt;&gt; Ah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So Job was blessed &gt;&gt; and the devil recognized. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Let's read the Bible. So Job was blessed. &gt;&gt; And the devil recognized the blessing of Job was coming from who? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Job, [laughter] the devil is telling God, you bless Job. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And not only did you bless Job, his substance &gt;&gt; is what? &gt;&gt; Increased in the land. In other words, Job prospered. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What I'm trying to show you here is the prosperity of Job never [screaming] affected his spiritual life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me start it again.

Yet he was what? &gt;&gt; Upright. &gt;&gt; One. He was upright. He was just and everything. So Job was wealthy &gt;&gt; and yet Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the devil was trying to make God believe &gt;&gt; that the reason why he's Christian is because of the prosperity. [applause] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to this my friend. &gt;&gt; Huh? Brother Brham say in the message water &gt;&gt; why cry speak &gt;&gt; after the seal say let's go my friend &gt;&gt; brother Brhamam say I have a wonderful time this week at water &gt;&gt; at brother Bertam's place there there &gt;&gt; brother Burchham today we are reading you and I went into the factory where they made water &gt;&gt; the cheese &gt;&gt; I see he &gt;&gt; and his wife brother Burcham and sister Burcham &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; son and them &gt;&gt; and his children are present where &gt;&gt; this morning. &gt;&gt; So this brother was in church. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; This brother is in church with his wife and with his children in the church. &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; Brother Brham say and always thought that a what? &gt;&gt; A cheese factory &gt;&gt; will be something like water.

Guard yourself with riches, my brother. &gt;&gt; Who gave him the riches? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Let's see what the prophet say. Brother Brandham say, "But the Lord did what &gt;&gt; has blessed this man. I had the privilege of being where &gt;&gt; in his home &gt;&gt; a what &gt;&gt; a very lovely home &gt;&gt; and a fine wife &gt;&gt; consecrated wife &gt;&gt; that never [screaming] &gt;&gt; affected the spiritual life of his wife &gt;&gt; it's only you you when they give you money then you run away from church but brother Bham wife when they got money she get more consecrated [cheering] because they know who gave them the money. &gt;&gt; They know the source. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Is this too strong?

Be your be humble. Be humble. &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; Brother say a fine what water &gt;&gt; consecrated wife &gt;&gt; and there is no reason why they should not leave for Christ each day as [screaming] they are doing. &gt;&gt; Let's read it again. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say there is no reason why They should not live for Christ each day as they are what? &gt;&gt; Because God bless [screaming] them. &gt;&gt; That's why they living for God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And not only that, brother Brandham say I met what? &gt;&gt; Yes son. &gt;&gt; And they are bad [screaming] children. &gt;&gt; Very fine children. &gt;&gt; They are how many? &gt;&gt; Very fine children. &gt;&gt; They are what kind of children? &gt;&gt; Very fine children. So their prosperity never affected their spiritual life. &gt;&gt; Matter of fact, he brought them back [screaming] to God. &gt;&gt; Because they understood the source of the money. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me continue. Brother Brandham say we are so grateful for what? &gt;&gt; This fellowship &gt;&gt; that we have what? &gt;&gt; One with another. &gt;&gt; What am I trying to say? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Prosperity can lead somebody away from God. It is true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What God want is to know where it's coming from. &gt;&gt; And that is the problem between the devil and Job. &gt;&gt; The devil was trying to prove to God &gt;&gt; that if you remove prosperity, Job will run away from the church. &gt;&gt; And God say, I'm going to prove to you that Job where the money &gt;&gt; or no money. It doesn't matter. Job will remain Christian. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when Job receive wealth, he say the Lord giveth. &gt;&gt; If it's God, he said the Lord taketh away. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; In other words, prosperity does nothing to Job. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, Job controls prosperity. &gt;&gt; Brother Burcham controls prosperity. &gt;&gt; Prosperity push him to God. Not away from God. And I pray in this church we can have brother Job and brother Burton and sister Burton people that when God blesses you, you stay closer to God. You stay closer to his word. Our children serve him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If your money keep you out of the church, &gt;&gt; you got a problem. &gt;&gt; If your money make you miss services, &gt;&gt; miss question and answer miss all the meeting and the married couple and the whatever your money now with standing in the way of the Lord. The Bible say the love of money. &gt;&gt; It is the greediness of you loving money. But this is not me loving. This is God blessing me. &gt;&gt; I hope you can see the difference. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The more [screaming] you get prospered, the more you love him. &gt;&gt; The more you serve him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you realize everything is him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My wife is him. My children is him. This church is him. The building is him. The pulpit is him. [cheering] &gt;&gt; My clothing is him. &gt;&gt; What do you have that you didn't receive from him? Everything I have, I receive it from him. &gt;&gt; He is my [screaming] everything. [cheering] &gt;&gt; He's my source, my God, my wealth, my riches, my protection. &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Listen to Paul. &gt;&gt; Paul say, "Not that I speak in respect of water." &gt;&gt; For I learn in whatever state I am, &gt;&gt; there we be what? &gt;&gt; Content. &gt;&gt; I know both how to be what? A base &gt;&gt; and had to be water. &gt;&gt; Abound. &gt;&gt; Everywhere in [screaming] all things. I am what? &gt;&gt; Instructed &gt;&gt; both to be what? &gt;&gt; Full &gt;&gt; or to be what? &gt;&gt; Hungry. &gt;&gt; Both to do what? &gt;&gt; Abound. &gt;&gt; And to do what? &gt;&gt; Suffer and need. &gt;&gt; I can do what? &gt;&gt; All things &gt;&gt; through Christ that has what? &gt;&gt; Strengthened me. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; A brother get a promotion. Oh no, no, no, no. Be careful. Hey, I was praying for that &gt;&gt; and God gave it to me. &gt;&gt; I will master the promotion. &gt;&gt; That promotion will bring me in church on Wednesday, on church on Sunday, on question and answer. I am right [screaming] there &gt;&gt; and I praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Brother Robert, I praise the Lord for a muck. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Who gave Solomon the wealth? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Who gave him the riches? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Can God give him something to make him for? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; God gave it to Job. Did he make Job fall? &gt;&gt; No. But the devil trying to make God think that Job is serving you because of the money. Remove the money and I will show you. And God say you don't know the caliber of spoken word. &gt;&gt; Spoken word. Even if you remove money, they stay with the word. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because what is attracting them is the word. It's the quality of the word &gt;&gt; that is attracting them &gt;&gt; and then the devil destroy everything and God keep watching &gt;&gt; and after a while God say Satan &gt;&gt; enough &gt;&gt; enough.

Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you humbly this afternoon. Father, thanking you for your grace, for your love, your mercy, and for everything you have been doing for us. Lord, this is as far as you wanted me to go with the ability you have given me. Lord, you spoke about the [music] work. You spoke about your blessing. How, Father, you are everything to us. You the God that bless us spiritually, physically, financially, [music] materially, in every aspect because we are depending completely upon thee. Lord, when is when Israel was going to the promised land, you warned them about Lord not letting their heart going astray because of the blessing that we found. But Lord, Father, today you are showing us that there [music] are people like Job that will stand despite the blessing. They will always depend and recognize the master because you are the one that gave us everything. [music] Because you told Israel [singing] that remember I am the Lord that give you power to get her wealth. And that's what we want to remember all the time that our sufficiency is coming from thee and with you we can do all things. [music] Father, may you take what the words that were spoken tonight I mean today. May you continue to minister to your children. May you unfold more than what we gave. Lord, Father, so that we can keep a right balance and keep moving on and moving on and prosper as our soul is prospering indeed. We commit this oncoming week unto the hand. We claim the blood of the lamb upon us, upon everything that is connected to us. We rebuke the devil away from us. Father, take this inspection coming up on Tuesday unto thy hand. Let it go well. Let the rain stop and let you open up the way so that they can pour whatever they need to pour this week in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you church. We love you. [applause and music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Couple of things. We got a choir practice five minutes. Five minutes after we dismiss. Um, Sister Yokth wanted me to remind everyone that [music] her shower is this weekend. Uh, Saturday the time and everything are located out there.
