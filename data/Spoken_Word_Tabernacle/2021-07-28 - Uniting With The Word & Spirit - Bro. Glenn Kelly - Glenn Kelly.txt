it wasn't for him holding on to us we surely would let go but he's holding on to us and he said he would not lose a one of his so we know that's a promise that we can stake our life on that we're promised by the scripture i'm grateful for that i'm grateful for that amen amen thank you does anybody have a testimony on their heart this evening they would like to share brother [Music] [Applause] um god bless y'all i have a testimony like on monday early in the morning when my dad was about to go to work on his way to work there were he was it was a red light and a car came behind him as the red light was turning to green a car came behind him and after that hit him from the back the shock made him somewhat unbalanced but he hold it on to the break and he had to go to the hospital for a checkup so it's kind of like a testimony and a prayer request so i want to thank god for saving him and protecting him through that time and that accident and right now he still has a little bit of headache every now and then and still feels a bit of pain so i asked if y'all could remember him in your prayers amen does anybody else have a testimony this evening does anybody have a prayer request i have a prayer request on the way to uh on the way to church tonight we are going down 321 and we passed a car that i don't know if there was an accident i think there was another car involved so i think there was an accident but the car went up into a guard rail and the whole front end was destroyed and by the time we passed there was no one in the car and there was no ambulance on the scene so i'm sure whoever was in the car was was taken by the ambulance to the hospital so we'll just remember that in prayer anybody else have a prayer request okay brother lemon and sister gene and then also brother greg wanted me to announce that joe green at bible tabernacle is having his meetings starting on tuesday through friday and they're at the church this year they're not going to be in the auditorium but they'll be at the church this year so if you need an address to the church i don't know if brother greg has it or if you want to see one of the deacons we can we can get the address over to one of the deacons so that if you are trying to attend any of those services and you need the service times or the address you can contact the deacons as of right now they don't have it but we'll have to get the information to the deacon so they will but we'll remember the prayer request and the tithe and offer um let's bow ahead lord our heavenly father i come to you this evening first

uh i hope that didn't take all my time but um as the prophet was given that vision of the mamba the lord had told him that he needed a greater consecration he needed to be more sincere and that has been my heart the past two weeks and i'll just would i like to share this song with you please it's called a new consecration i hear the call calling me to my father's house where there's a place prepared for me like a lost son i wandered in the world of sin but his love beckons me to return to him and this is god's call to a new consecration i'm cold to a deeper dedication i'm called to be one with my theophany and to live eternally in my glorified body [Music] i mean i'm gonna pick up the beat oh i'm seeing things that i lack as you shine your light i'm searching diligently to find them back every virtue must be in me when you come for i'm called into the full statue of a perfect man and this is god's call to a new consecration i'm called to a deeper dedication i'm called to be one with my theophany and to live eternally in my glorified body [Music] i'm moving out into higher realms with great expectation for the supernatural to take place the time has come for this reality when the impossible must be manifested in me and this is god's call to a new consecration and i'm called to a deeper dedication i'm called to be one with my theory and to live eternally in my glorified body oh this is god's call to a new consecration i'm called to a deeper dedication called to be one with my theophoney and to live eternally in my glorified body seeing things that i lack as you shine your light i'm searching daily gently to find them back every virtue must be in me when you come for i'm calling to the full statue of a perfect man and this is god's call to a new consecration and i'm called to a deeper dedication i'm called to be one with my fiancee and to live eternally my glorified body [Music] and to live eternally in my glorified body praise god amen [Music] we'll sing this as we call our brother up this evening oh i will give you all my worship i will give you let's go up we'll carry on i will give you all my worship i will give you all my praise you alone are worthy of my praise and i will give you all my worship i will give you all my praise [Music] one more time i will give you all my worship i will give you all my praises [Music] hallelujah amen amen everybody happy tonight ready for the word did you kick the mamba down remember he's not going to do anything except god gave him the permission amen if he didn't get a permission there is nothing nothing not even deaf life nothing amen i had a question because the last verse we used was uh roman where the bible says nothing so i'm persuaded that nothing shall separate us and i say death what is separation death separation death separation death i was trying to drive a point there is a death physical that happened in the body physical amen and the devil will not touch you if the lord have not finished with you as long as the lord has a plan and a purpose on this earth you will not die even if they take you put you on a hot pot bowling you with oil like they did uh john the revelator they could not kill him because he was not time yet amen they took jesus push him all the way to the cliff could not do anything the bible say he walked pass through them and nobody could touch him until the time happened amen so not only that we have a security for a few a physical death we also have security in our spiritual soul when you are born again make sense now now nothing can separate you from the love of god the love of god the capstone crust in your heart there is nothing that can separate you from the love of god nothing can bring you death again to your soul no matter tribulation peril famine hunger whatever the devil is going to do there will not be anything that can come to your soul and separate you from your maker nothing amen brother branham found himself cornered his child dying over there his wife dying over there but i'm saying all everything that the devil was telling me was true but down deep in the soul something rose up he said he could not tell me that christ does not exist because i saw him that one nothing can separate you amen so security in the body security also in the soul amen we sang about the mamba the mamba remember when we talk about the feast of the seven days amen you remember the pavement was made out of red i hope somebody listened to that sermon again it was made out of red black white which were the three horse rather and the other color was blue which was the color of the breath of the mamba they were in the pavement amen that's where the seven fist was going on but the pavement is something that is under your feet whatever is under your feet you can kick him down you can throw upon it amen the way like i said the way the book of esther is written it's like the book of revelation if you go to revelation chapter 2 and chapter 3 it speaks about the seven church ages it tells you about the seven messenger the seventh star and everything and all the name of the seven church ages but if you go to revelation 14 it's speaking also of the seven church ages but he put an emphasis on the three last angels you remember one have the gospel of righteousness the other one was luther wesley and then the third one was william marion branham so when you deal with the book of revelation you got to take revelation 2 and revelation 3 you put it together then you go grab revelation 14 then you put it there then you go grab revelation 6 then you put the seals together then you go grab the trumpet and you bring it there then you go grab everything and before you know it you will see the full image coming out like this if the lord terry one of this day we're gonna line all of them up the seals and the church edges and uh and the seventh week of daniel and go all the way and you're gonna see it's like a beautiful story of redemption up and down up and down all the way to the new jerusalem and you're going to see it amen so when you look at esther on chapter one there is a feast of seven days that is your seven church ages but he also gives you a clue of the seventh chamberlain which are the seventh spirit that work that came in the constellation so now when you go it gives you again a feast of three days which is the three step again which is luther wesley pentecost but a man was killed on the fourth day go read the book of esther go read it again over amen esther fasted for three days the first day the second day the third day was the first banquet amen then esther requested a second banquet which is the fourth day amen it is the white horse rider the red horse rider the black one then the fourth one there is three four messenger that kills the tree and there are also four messengers that restore the life go read the restoration of the bad tree church you need a gig in the word amen how many are reading the c.o.d if you don't you're going to get lost because i'm shooting up amen make sure you stay tight with the message if not you will wonder we already finished with the black dog territory we are soaring into the air like ego amen so it's time to rise up and to kick him down everybody clear so far if it's a jargon shoot me a text then we can handle it tonight we have brother kelly who's going to be preaching for us brother kelly is one of our local we appreciate him and brother polycarp helping me left and right as we're navigating the ship and the church work and everything left and right but you have brothers that can help and give you some time to catch up on certain things we really really really appreciate you only believe oh [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] thank you lord hallelujah our hearts and minds are clear amen we won't prolong the time let's go to the lord lord we thank you for your grace your mercy lord jesus we thank you lord god for giving us an opportunity to come in the house of the lord once again and lord as we enter in your gates with thanksgiving father because we know lord jesus by your word you said we're two or three we're gathering thy name you will be in the midst of us so we thank you lord jesus we thank you lord god for all those lord god that pressed the way out tonight father and we thank you lord jesus for the pastor his family the deacons the trustees the ministers the musicians and the laity and those that are looking in father we just thank you lord god for allowing us to gather once again lord god under your precious word and lord god we say that humbly because all that you've been doing for us father we just give you thanks lord god thanking you for choosing us as being your bride lord god in these end times father so father now we bring every spirit under subjection tonight father i try to trouble the hearts and the mind of your children lord god lord god let them say did not our hearts burn within them as you spoke to us along the way so father we thank you for your grace and your mercy and by faith we claim that all done in jesus name we pray amen and amen amen we won't keep you standing let's turn to uh ephesians we're going to turn to uh ephesians thank you musicians chapter 2 i'm chapter four in the book of ephesians and once you have it let's for the sake of time and let's look at verse one we read the first three verses and i say amen okay i therefore the prisoner of the lord see that was a commandment to paul he was a prisoner he said beseech you that ye walk worthy of vocation wherewith ye are called it says with all loneliness and meekness with long-suffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring see diligently to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated you know here we we got the inspiration i tell you i was going to i i i wanted to look at another area but i tell you as the pastor always say he's the boss you know so i couldn't get away from this so it's like a long sunday school lesson so don't don't worry about it i got my timer set here we're not going to keep you alone by the grace of god but we want him to have his way okay and you know we got the inspiration from the uniting time in sign in the unity of one god into one church and uniting with the word and spirit is our topic is uniting with the word in the spirit see so when we look here in ephesians you know we're talking about believers paul was speaking to believers here and with these believers what we're saying now he's showing us how the way that we should walk but everything that we should be led by should be led by the holy spirit he's showing us that you know we should be united with one with the spirit in his time now you know it's it's united time it's the end time the science is all around us it's a joyous time it's a glorious time for the believer things you know we're going to read some things tonight the last time we were here you know we were talking about the cities of refuge and we were showing you those refugees had specific names and for you to get in that city we know that you there's no condemnation who those that are in christ jesus is that right so we know at that time all of us the joy of the lord is our strength is that right restore unto me the joy of our salvation so we're going to show you we should be the happiest people here in the land because we are united with the almighty god is that right we are co-workers is that right that's what we are looking at being connected with god in this hour here now and that's why when you had the holy spirit had to pass the minister you know he said some sunday says some have trouble being what born again is that right so you're having trouble truly being born again then you need to get the understanding why you can get it see repentance is a gift to you right now repent this is granted unto you a godly sorrow being a godly repentance that you don't have to be repented of anymore the only way the only one can unite to with god is god he's the only one that can unite you with himself is that right so we want to read so we have a lot here tonight by the grace of god but when the time would go off then the lord tell us to stop we'll stop but just be prayerful with us be mindful with us we know it's a wednesday night but we're going to do some jumping around but we want you to give us a spiritual ear tonight now brother brother he was working with the united one of god in the church on on this one here if you want to pull it up later on and it's on chapter 17 it's 12 21 58. so i don't have my board up here or the powerpoint right so you gotta you just gotta bear with me is that right use those young minds is that right if you can't use the mind let the holy spirit bring it to you is that right huh hallelujah he said now look he said now you know god made man to be an achiever we should never be living a low life we should always live a victorious life is that right brother steve i didn't take it lightly about that fly you know why because let me tell you i've been looking for this watch huh this isn't but a 8.88 watch that i got from walmart is that right but i used to work in this watch because i didn't want to wear my good watch to work so i wanted to wear this watch it and i found this watch i said i didn't find it the lord brought it to me is that right when i looked in there it was in one of my pants pockets i don't know if god put it there or not but i know i prayed and i'd ask god for this watch and hear that huh so i tell you the lord is good you give him thanks i tell you he's a miraculous god okay and he's a miraculous guy and benjamin you hold on is that right because your mama god's going to perform a miraculous work on your mama is that right we standing we got to believe this way now it's no tomorrow we believe when the omnipotent meet the omnipotent the miraculous have to happen we putting god's word to test now there's no tomorrow this is the last stage saints that's why jesus talked about more of his second coming it's the science united time of the end time it's the signs that god has given us hallelujah help us lord he said now you know god has made man to chief that's what man was made for and all down through life he was trying to achieve something and his achievement the reason he tries that is because he was so designed to do so god designed him to be an achiever god did not design you to be a loser god denied them not to design you to be defeated we have to go to trials we have to go to tests but he told labor abraham what you shall possess the gates of the enemy after the trial we all got to be tried and tested is that right but god foreknew he put you in laodicea because he knew that you were going to forsake the test is that right he knew it saying god made him that way he said but the trouble of it is in his achievement he tries to do something within himself he said there's where he makes his mistake and he gets in trouble you see so we're talking about brother robert kicking the devil out we exposing his tactics tonight is that right you got to understand your enemy we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and wickedness and rulers in high places but god has given you what he said put on the whole armor of god so the human baby with the wild be able to withstand the wilds and the trickeries of the devil in his end time is that right god told us we will not be deceased is that right so that shouldn't be a concern even in your thoughts because you say we will not be deceived hallelujah yeah we're going to ambush you tonight he said now look oh brother i gotta remember your back there brother keller help me lord he said there he says now in the beginning of genesis see he says he says now god on the highest life is man which is the image of god you are the highly image of god god has chose you to be his image in this end time you're going to find out why they're getting this word when they're getting this word the mysteries being unfolded it shouldn't be any question to anyone any longer because god came and showed us what is that it was there to increase your faith in this end time hour he says and in this life man begin to achieve things but when when he begin to leave god out of the picture the last time we was here we told you that even brother branham quoted he said you will if you always address god and go to god before anything you do you will always be successful [Music] he's giving us the instructions but we getting to get them moving and want to move in our own way in our own self-esteem i asked god for this year to give me words to get down in the soul we need some soul food noun is that right because people are being deceived when the god came he told your body spirit and soul we consist of is that right the five senses he gave us to contact this earth with sea taste fill and smell is that right and then for the free more will this is what he's talking about here some of you think it's the holy spirit and it's not the holy spirit it's your spirit that's telling you to go do things the holy spirit will line up with the scriptures [Applause] in their spirit memory reasoning conscious affection those are the avenues that satan can move and trick you on huh we're in a war a spiritual war that's why over in ezekiel he said he had to give you another spirit to tolerate yourself is that right we're talking about a war we're talking about exposing these things that satan is trying to trick the elected bride with but as we first came in here the devil ain't coming up in here he might as well forget about it why because this is the almighty god's church and this is the king the holy ghost runs this church the holy ghost runs his people the holy ghost is in charge of this the spirit of god we are uniting with the spirit of god [Applause] [Music] see look what he says he says now he made he says now and when we find let me go ahead god don't say and then in this life man begin to achieve things but when he did it he began to leave god out of the picture he began to have a selfish motive and when he did that he began to think of something for what [Applause] himself tonight you'll be set free in that area huh you can praise and you can rejoice okay the joy of the lord you never let the devil steal your joy if you seek god first seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all other things will be added unto you the critic says he says now he says and we find that it isn't long until he had corrupt the the very planet that god had put him on he had in such a condition till even his creator grieved him at his heart that he had ever made amen and you can imagine how god felt when he seen the very creature that he made in his image and give him domain and how that he made and made him to do something for him and yet he returned all of his strength and his power over to the selfish desires and achievements sound like god won't address that selfish demon tonight from somewhere huh we don't know where it is he's in charge that's what he did with samson when he looked at samson is that right when he looked at eve is that right it hurt the father it hurt god when he seen him walking around their images when they see those that's walking around trouble with drug demons trouble with alcohol demons trouble with lust demons trouble with pornography demons trouble with lesbian demons trouble with homosexual demons trouble with heroin demons trouble with these demons trouble with gambling demons hit some of his children locked up out there and traveling with those demons they just don't realize yet that they are not children of disobedience they are challenged and daughters of the most high god they are just are among the children of disobedience and god send the gospel the gospel word to do what to set them free hallelujah he says and then we find it isn't too long after this great lesson that god taught the man during the time by destroying the entire world is that it just seemed like that man can't learn ah you see what god the holy spirit told us you see what your brother if he's prospering he told cain cain even because you came out first if you do what you brother do i won't even put you over him but he couldn't do it he's telling you it's the the is he the faith or the doubt it's a faith that's working by love now they get around in there that's why god is bringing his elect loved the word they love the mysteries let me keep going hallelujah help me lord he says then he says and his children only through the hard way we find that even in our children we have to punish them many times serve to make them understand it just seems like that a man is just in himself a total failure to begin with see that's why the lord said train up a child in a way that he should go when he grow old he won't depart from it see some children you can use the words of wisdom and they'll straighten up and some of them you've got to whip them on the behind is that right you just got to do it sometimes and some of them some parents today got problem doing that they're letting the child tell them what to do huh yeah the children telling them what to do in this hour here now you know how you're going to handle he that is faithful with little will be faithful as much if you can't spanking when it's time to get spanking how you going to have a thus say to the lord he said now look he says he says when when we lost his relationship with god he become a unit of his own he didn't depend on god no more see and when god had taught him the lesson of what it was to try to do something within himself that his works would all come to naught see it's not going to amount to nothing anyway see they thinking this out here now material things is a prosperous thing no it's not all the time you got to examine your your motive and your exactly exact objection with the lord you can't fool god i can't fool god none of us can fool god god understands the heart god pour the reigns on the heart god tries the heart he made us all what do you do you can you want to be free you want to be free all you have to do is accept the truth the truth is what makes you free [Applause] don't sit up there with your heart our heart somebody and god's going this way i had no intentions on going this way he said look what he said he said god and when god taught him the lesson he said himself that his works he would come come to naught immediately we find them again going right down to achieve again he says in the bible said that they built them a tower and they were going to climb up into the heavens to get up into heaven without coming the way god had planned for them to come you see then god has to provide a way how are you going to be successful going against the lord huh no way look what he told him he says that man can achieve better when they are united together you see what i'm saying but we are united together god's order is a pastor he got deacons he got trustees he got treasurers he got song leaders he has musicians you see if this old clock here this whole watch here and one thing is out of order yes sir you can put on a pastor you can weigh him down now when we come here for the word god who can pour your beacon when it's time for him to go pray for somebody or visit the sick god is that right when your trustees has things to do but when you're musicians if you're out of place if this watch is not if something inside of it is running not right it's going to bring things out of order it will not keep the right time [Music] got too much going on this is god it's god's work it's god's work god's sympathy god sent you there god showed you this sunday you're not leaving here until he's finished with you huh he's got a purpose for us all look what he says he says when you got he said now look you're denying it together he says now you take one man by himself his power is limited to one man he said two men his twice the strength for men he makes them four times the strength god wants us to be one god made man when when we should be one our motives should be won they was up in the upper room is that right their motive and their objective was one is that right it was to do the will of the lord because they know if they came down here without what brother robert being united with god is that right oh death would come at them those jews would kill them they would persecute them they could not come out of there being in one with god you have to be one with god that's why the holy spirit was telling you young men young women you when you got friends out there pray for them please for them that they be a christian first before they take on a wife or a husband this is the order of god being united with god being united with the word of god look what he says he says god made them he said he said god made man that we should be one and our motives should be won our objectives should be won our achievements should be won he's just designed that way that's what he said huh i'm telling you we have to understand saints there's no tomorrow this is the last stage is that right and they looking for the end time so matt kovacs rising back up again out there why because the end time signs is that right they're not why it's because they have no desire to do the will of god their desire was to go back to their unrighteous filthy living [Applause] he said be transformed i beseech you brothers be he transformed he said be ye not conform to this to this world but be renewed by the what in the spirit of your mind your mind your spirit and soul works together is that right we getting it that's why we said those avenues those five avenues that you get into your spiritual realm that's self-will that's according to your will you can't blame nobody else because we have the word and we got all heaven back in us so we got to understand you got the lord lean not to your own understanding we got to understand god has given us of thus say the word the word then god has given us a word in his end time so we won't error we wanted to go left or right you could stay in the middle of the road with the word is that right when god has sent us the ministry that he hid as we said before he didn't hide it from us he hid it just for his bride just for his election is that right who can bring any charge against god's elect no one forgives god the one who has justified you who has called you who has sanctified you with glorified jew his god has we not no weapons formed against us can prosper is that right no weapons when the enemy come in like a flood yeah we'll lift up a mighty standard again [Music] it's a war brother within a real war in this word of god it's going to be anointed this is uniting with the word of god and with the end time signs let me read some of these end times signs for you god done brought them people forgot but the elect ain't forgotten god because they looking you know why because we're looking to get out of here huh that's what we're looking we're looking for the rapture he said look events he said remember rabbi kadura he reveals the messiah's name remember that he was the one influential um rabbi over in israel about 103 years old and he had a letter sealed up and that letter was sealed up and he told his son not to open it until after a year god bless you remember brother robert he told him not to open until after a year and he opened that letter that letters he testified that jesus christ was the messiah and listen to that now they thought he was out of his mind that he was out of his mind but look at us we know that anyone that professed that they're in their right mind he said a self-driving car is that right end time signs he said throughout the four blood moon isn't that right the pope visits the united states you got to go pour these things unusual weather patterns is that right end time signs it just had somewhere that had hailstorm so big and so hard yesterday one country it was busting the windows in in the cars the china has just had sandstorm a big sandstorm out there you got in india got floods going on we got fires going on it's an end time we're uniting with the end time sign that's what our prophet told us about you got you you had racial strife going on indonesia earthquake it says you got a woman women running for president already happened he said israel found oil i think brother greg was telling me about over there in uh syria was it that they are rushing them want to go over there and want to start dropping by and bombs remember israel found oil over there in in syria in iraq over there it was enough to carry keep them until the lord come he said and he told us watch russia we know russia is rising up same-sex marriages is that right abortion divorces he said now he says in second thessalonians two and one a falling away from the what truth falling away from the truth gotta come first is that right first remember israel for israel when titus overtook jerusalem first the jews had to reject the word is that right now so you have to understand then after they rejected the word then the national then the military force move in is that right and after the military force they come and they move in then what you have then now you got who rome and him taking over is that right well you have to understand it's the same thing happened in the end time message first it had to be brother out of falling away they had to move away from us they had to go was that right so that's why it is that we're here now don't take it lightly for the end time signs that's going on right now i'm saying some so god is bringing these things right before us look at here help us lord he says now he said there was no power he said now his question was not whether he would be jesus question let me examine the king of the prophets the lord jesus the day that we are living in is so much greater than when he was here he spoke more of his second coming than he did of his going away he says search the scriptures he says before he's going away he prophesies of things that would take place in this day he must be they said he must be crucified he knew he would rise from the grave on the third day there was no power to break that prophecy hallelujah living he love me dying he saved me bury he carried my sins far away rising he justified hallelujah is that right brother singapore hallelujah what are we talking about his question was not whether he would be crucified he would he would rise again or whether he would ascend on high or whether that wasn't his question he would send back because why he would send back the holy ghost is that right so you and i can be united with him again that's what we're talking about united times in the end time we're being united with the holy ghost the holy ghost and us are becoming one is that right and with god we are co-workers with him he would send back the holy ghost his question was would there be any faith on the earth at his second coming will he find people who believes the end time necessary and standing on the word let me keep going hallelujah look what he said he says now the end time sign he says they plan it he says god let me turn this in he says in all the time these things are going on the spirit of the living god is constantly striving with the flesh trying to get man away from his own achievements [Music] they see his family everything around them are failing and they still won't turn to god he says look he says trying to get man away from his own achievement trying to get man away from his own selfish motives he says then an objective a to a plan which god has laid down god has laid in pain the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of the lord he said and as long as a man works work his own plan he will be a failure why do you think your pastor in other words are successful is because they're not working their plan they're following the order of god's plan and then when they achieve it they give god the praise they give god the glory they give god the thanks and god gets the blessings god gets the testimonies he said look he says now and a man can only achieve right when he comes back with the right objective and motive and that is according to god's plan for him any other foundation is sinking sad he said upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it he built his church upon the revelation of the word that god has brought the revelation of who jesus christ is is that right that's the only way a man when you're going to be born again to be born again god's got to bring to you the revelation of jesus christ in jesus christ he's the son of god and he's god he was the son of god and god he was the heart he was the mind he was the soul of god and he came and he walked on this earth and children we all are children of god he was the example as a son to show us that he would live a victorious life if you're obedient unto the word of god that's what god's brought him here for to tear down the kingdom in the ways of satan hallelujah i better keep going we got a long way to go look what he says he says now he says satan he said we fight out and that they tried they tried to unite and then and become one person but in this united did that time he said it was under what a political power the uniting now is under political power everything is united any companies these little companies that didn't make it through the pandemic you see in the little ones that are still hanging on there well you got to read between the lines sometimes what god and what god is allowing them to do is the signs of the time is that right remember the pope he met with um chase banks he met with bank uh bank america and the other finance the top three financial groups in america challenged me and go see if not what i'll tell you is true they had to report to him once a year now see about these finances you have to understand when now the signs of the time when they first come they have to line up what with the prophecies is that right we know america got a debt that we cannot be paid it's not going to be paid unless the catholic church as the prophet said come in and pay off our debt so you have to understand saints and that where where god has brought you on his end time he see promise i'll never leave you or forsake you you've never seen the righteous forsaken or his seed begging for bread stop leaning to your own understanding let god have his way let god move look what he said in unity he said and finally he says when you find unity amongst people like that they do great things just look over the world when people unify themselves together yet under the wrong plan they'll do great things now they build the tower see modern science can't do that even today they have one mind one soul one purpose one motive one objective that's to build a tower so high to god if he ever took the notion and run right them right up into the heavens he said now look he couldn't keep them from doing that as they thought we find out they that they organize themselves together and we find them again completely what out of the will of god god already told him he wasn't going to destroy it by water again so you have to understand it because these minds now the prophet of god said it was a type of like jacob's ladder is that right he was a type of jacob ladder trying to go up in that ladder but what did he do he saved it for 2021 is that right when he sent malachi 4. revelation 10 7 when the angel of god he was ascending and descending ascending and descending he's bringing the revelation down in the word down to his messengers in the end time they say come on we ought to be a glorious church in this house the most happiest church in this hour that's right hallelujah that scares the devil they ain't gonna steal my joy he ain't gonna steal my joy i know where he brought me from to god be the glory i thank god for all this word that he's unfolding he said now he said and there isn't a beautiful picture this day is that when men are trying to unite together we should we should be united but they're uniting what the wrong system did you ever notice how the devil patterns of these things he said now you look he said remember russia i'm not going to read all that i'm going to quote some other remember russia the prophet of god said that russia was trying to type as pentecost is that right he's just trying to bring them under one order to bring everything to them he said but he was typing it from the scriptures in pentecost when he scattered them abroad is that right and they brought everything that they had to defeat their of the apostles and distributed so no one would be lacking but the prophet of god said so that the word can go forward he had nowhere to go backwards to they only had to keep moving forward is that right kick the devil out look what he says he keeps going help us lord he said jacob's ladder he said look he said did you ever think the protestants under the federation of the church no let me jump up here he said now look say you look at the united nations see united nations is trying to they had them for years is that right they've always been uniting under man's way instead of according to the way of the lord so a man had to understand what god is doing in his hour here and now and is that right he's uniting and the end time signs is right before us is that right we have to understand that we're here now saints let me keep reading help me lord he said did you ever think other than you in trying to make all the nations one great big brotherhood he says under a united power see one great brotherhood when elijah came when malachi 4 came it was also brotherly love time is that right he was coming and he was bringing them that's what the pastor was talking about when you started typing in the church agent you started typing in the seals even though they had all that false teaching in that false doctrine and lutheran age but god always had a word to override that false teaching in every age he always brought some light to every age in wesley's age he brought some light in wesley's age and in pentecostal age he's always brought some light for the believer in each age he said now look united states is all right but it's under the wrong thing satan controls all the nations the scripture says satan is the ruler of the earth when when he's taking jesus up up into a high a high place he said now look let me let me turn the scriptures let's turn to uh matthew three [Music] i gotta jump on it when it could when it come if i know i talked about the tower of babel if you're writing your notes down that's in genesis 11. if you're going in the tower of babel sometimes god unites god god united in groups god uniting individuals and god who when god is united we want to be trying to show you here the movement of god when the holy spirit unites with a man that's what we're looking at he says now you have to understand matthew 3 he said look at one of the greatest uniting of all times is that right he said god does nothing and look at matthew chapter 3 and verse 13 matthew 3 and verse 13 he says then come of jesus from galilee to jordan unto john to be baptized of him but john forbade him saying i have needed to be baptized of thee and come as thou to me why because remember the scripture says god do nothing unless it's first he revealed his secrets into his prophets is that right so john recognized it john saw the uniting sign it was uniting time but the sign was only given to john john was the messenger then john forbade him saying i have need to be baptized of thee and cometh down to me he says in jesus answering and said him suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh unto us to do what fulfill our righteousness remember every lamb every sacrifice had to be clean is that right we had to be justified we had to be sanctified we had to be filled with the holy ghost son then god showed us it was what the adoption time now right we're moving forth saints that word that power is already inside of you god has stored it in you before the foundation of the world speak the word we're under the faith that's working by love this your motive your objective you've got to be driven by love and this hour here now first you gotta love that's what he told him in the book of ephesians when he told him first he said you fell from your first love when you fell from your first love you fell away from the word you didn't love coming to church you know more he didn't like praying no more he didn't like reading your bible no more you didn't like the revelations anymore he didn't like the mysteries anymore the world is pulling on you he said i said have no fellowship with the world become one with god let the holy spirit unite to reunite you once again with the word of god let me keep going hallelujah look god he says suffer he said he suffered him and jesus when he was baptized went straight up out of the water and then lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw what the spirit of who god uniting descending like a what a dub some of you wonder why you ain't got the holy ghost in your life your life is up and down up and down back and forth up and down i need a refilling sometime too you know why because you get slack on your prayer life oh [Applause] it gets flagged going in the bible huh you get slack on reading the message you think the pastor's just telling you to read something just to be reading it huh i bet if that school teacher tells you to read some of your reading i bet you busy i bet you got a job you ain't gonna keep going to your job late i bet you ain't gonna keep going that job like you won't have no job huh is that right don't make god's grace a disgrace is that right all you got to do is follow the will of god is that right there's nothing that the will of god god's not going to send you into nothing where the grace of god can't get you out of it huh i'm telling this out here now saints put joy you young children you keep a smile on your face the joy of the lord those children out there make them thirst for what we have we got the revelation if god made them in their image in our likeness we got the goods that they need we got them all of them are really thirsting for god is that right they're hungry and thirsting those that hunger and thirst for righteousness shall be refilled filled with the holy ghost saints come on now look what he says help us lord he said look he said the spirit descending like a dove and lightning upon him holy ghost and fire john testified he wasn't worthy of the one then that was to come no i'm not that light but the light would come i'm not worthy even tie his shoes what'd he say benjamin but i tell you son we look in this hour here now you watch god move for your prayers try god he said prove me i'm like gold that's tried in the fire god in the holy ghost ain't coming down on no goat nature huh he ain't coming out on no goat nature he's gonna lift them the meat is burned the mickey's bird in heaven came down and the mickey's out number one earth touched and agreed is that right the most powerful sign ever there on earth when god and man feet touch the ground together again uniting time of the signs [Music] look what he says here he says now he says lower voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son and who i'm well pleased and now once it comes you see the test the tests always come we know in the next scripture is that right here come the devil the devil want to try you and see if you made of what you testify that you made us hallelujah let me keep going look what he says he says russia want to type the pentecost i'ma drop down here for the sake of time he said did you ever think of the protestants he says i'm still at 12 21 58 i'm a chapter 42. he said did you ever think of the protestant church under the federation of churches is trying to force all these little churches out and it will happen that you'll not be able to go to church unless you belong to the union of churches see you're nineteen time when the organizations that's why you keep hearing the prophets say i mean the pastors say it's a new book when those seals came open those guns he tied in all the loose ends it was elijah that came in in elisha in the old testament it was the light of john the baptist the spirit on them and then there when it came in the new testament it was when brother branham came it was the spirit of elijah but it was the anointing that christ it was christ in the holy ghost form back on the scene again this is christ he's the only one can break the seals he's the only one can descend in these sins is that right he said behold i send you what elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day the coming of the lord that's why you have people out there that don't even want to mention mention his name we're not preaching a man we're preaching what the anointed christ is that right is that the messenger had to come for this age i get a double portion because when you mention i get an opportunity he's not god we're not making him god jesus christ is lord but we're not ashamed as the prophet as paul said in the scriptures what he said remember me is that right all of y'all that's looking out there he's malachi 4 luke 17 30. revelations 10 7 he had the anointing of elijah on him church the scripture the scripture had to come it had to come elijah five times uh elijah elisha john the baptist william branham over in revelations 11 and the spirit of elijah had to come and win the spirit of elijah look at the sign over in genesis 18 this sign was never shown to the gentiles he was discerning the thoughts and the tense of the heart search the scriptures and see not of what i tell you if it's true [Applause] the times of the time look what he says he says did he ever think of the protestant church he said now look these little places like this will certainly pay for it but we got a scripture ah well we got a scripture we got a word we got all heaven back us ah we got all heaven back at us huh we got all heaven backing up what's the scripture fear not lucia god it's my pleasure to give that a kingdom is that right [Music] [Applause] in time sign huh uniting end time sign i tell you thank you jesus help me lord fear not little flock it's your father's good will to give you the kingdom that's what we look forward to how that's right sister hallelujah we look on brother grey we look forward to getting out of here is that right thank you jesus he said now then see it's all the achievement of the enemy tries to do is to achieve but under the wrong plan it's under his own plan but he has no original he has to take something that god has did and then perverted it on righteousness he tried to pervert it or convert it into some some big union is that right look what he says help me lord he says now look he says then now god has the order we quoted it earlier god does nothing unless he first revealed it to his servants the prophet is that right so we know god has that order he says now word of the lord by the prophets he says and now we know that god that made the heavens and the earth and so laid out his work that he would describe describe his time by a sign see he said that same guy he's that sign about the time he said now look here help us lord he says and now we know god that made the heavens and the earth so laid out his work and he would describe his time by sign that same god lives today he said now look god will never let these things happen without giving us a what a definite sign [Music] he had to keep his word so he's giving us a sign fear not little flock god staying on the promises of god is that right god brought us a mystery now i give something else to knock the devil out with brother robert i can say now by revelation oh death where is thy sting oh great where is thy victory glory be to god uh who can bring any charge against god's elect you can't bring any charge against yourself david couldn't even speak death on himself because david didn't have right to speak it is that right that was god's order hallelujah look what he's doing thank you jesus thank you lord he said now look it's definite he says and that's where that we understand see he's got to give us death give me about five more minutes he said now look he said god would never let these things happen he said now here is the thing today he said that the clergy they don't read it right it's just like it was it was then they didn't think that it was time see but we know it's time uniting signs of the time be sure that you got the baptism of the holy ghost you see because that's the only thing going to keep you he said to repent be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost see we can't make people be bright everybody's not bride but we can tell them about the saving grace of the lord jesus christ that's why the pastor said first go out and share the gospel every uniting time every believer is to tell someone about salvation every believer being like an evangelist go and tell them about the good news of the gospel i am not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ for this is the power of god unto whom those that are saved look what he says he says now help me lord let me speed it up he says now he says the he said they thought it's just like it was then and they didn't think that it was time he said they thought that they were living pretty peaceful then and so they wasn't looking for no messiah and jesus has just said he's coming would be as a what faith in the night he told us to do what watch him pray that's right brother steve watch him pray watch for the coming of the lord you know when the time is near because all the mysteries is finished is that right through the malachi 4 god has given us an opportunity to go down he sent the ministry to go down into the depth and he's unfolding this word and through these mysteries that was hidden there is that right these golden nuggets so our faith would be increased in these end times is that right god know when we return to the earth shall we find what faith the faith of what because you're pressing your way out you're coming for the word of god you love to hear the word of god don't worry children don't worry about this this is going to benefit you down the road let me keep going i want to read something before we go help us lord thank you jesus thank you lord he said now look he says coming he said he's coming he says but there there are some of the virgins he's when the people who were unaware of his coming but there were some of the virgins that went to meet him half of them had oil in their lamp and was ready they were watching for that sign see and that's who i'm speaking to see to those who are looking for the sign now the sign of his coming you see you don't want to get you to have to get the baptism of the holy ghost you want to have the baptism of the holy ghost now now the holy ghost was leading was giving you what you don't have to worry about anything the holy ghost of sin is going to lead it's going to guide you into all truth is that right so you don't have to worry about anybody deceiving you let us keep going it says now looking he said these signs given by the lord is given only to believers that's why we read out of the book of ephesians he was telling you to be to make sure that you're diligently every day praying getting directions from the holy ghost making sure leaving you and guiding you the truth brother robert that song was a vindication to what he gave me tonight we wanted to move higher he's moving the ministry into another level so you have to recognize in his hour here now that so many nuggets came out sunday morning come on saints and god will grant you the time it takes wisdom is that right get the wisdom of christ christ is the wisdom of god let me keep going thank you jesus he said look he says man the lord unbelievers see unbelievers will never see it they go right over the top of it he says you know paul fell down but they none of but none of them could see that light see the light was right now remember that was uniting time for paul is that right he was his uniting sign for paul is that right when it came down in ananias went and prayed for him his eyes was open he received the holy ghost is that right and when he received the holy ghost they said the next look what paul did let's go to acts nine while we turn to acts 9 glory be to god watch what paul did he says now for the sake of time acts chapter 9 and verse 17 he says in ananias with his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him and saying come brother saul the lord even jesus that appeared unto thee in the way then came and sent me that thou mightest received thy sight and be filled with the holy ghost and immediately and immediately from his eyes it became scales there had been scales he says and he received sight for with and arose and was baptized and when he had received me he was strengthened then was saw certain days with the disciples but at the marcus look what he did at the straight way he preached through christ in the synagogues that he is the son of god but all that heard him were amazed and said is it not that does he destroy them which called on this name in jerusalem came hither and intent he might bring them down unto the chief priests but saul increased the more in what strength and confound and the jews which dwelt at the mattress proving that this is the very christ let me tell you that you see what it did we don't have to get slack up when persecution comes when god comes when the anointing sign came it came to paul paul saw the voice and he heard the word is that right paul saw the light and he heard the word now we understand paul now was moving he was moving into what god had called him to do saints let's keep going hallelujah it was a uniting sign for paul at that time no longer saw he became paul he was united he was the messenger that was sent from true the gentile days is that right hallelujah glory be to god he said now look he says these signs he says giving he said these signs that no you know paul fell down none of them could see that light he said that light was right there when john stood there before the multitudes and thousands out of the bank there of clergymen and sages great men and john said himself he bore a record of seeing what the spirit of god descending like a gulf he saw the uniting time he said he saw it below this is my beloved son and who i'm well pleased what to dwell and nobody saw it but john you see it was just for him what you're getting is you're a believer you give god the praises you give god the glory you give god the honor this is only for believers this is not for to make believers this is not for the unbelieving he gave them grace he told him what he told joshua the anointing came to him when the anointing came to him he told joshua he said joshua when it's time to go take out every enemy every high heel every tight skirt every eyelash every makeup everything he said when you raise the sword he said raise it he said and then let it down for him to go forward don't you raise it back up until you finish give god be the glory it's a scriptural sign [Applause] thank you lord come forward musicians look what he says let me read this he says look he says now help us lord he said look the end time bry what are they looking at in the end time help us he said now look revelations 10 7 the seventh angel message now remember that's right at the seventh trumpets and there's seven angels blow seven trumpets that's what we're coming next he says but he's listen what he listen what he says remember where specifically it said the angel's message see you got some people out there now trying why did he say this i had i i had a a very influential pastor try to bring that scripture and tie it in with revelations 10 7. those ain't those trumpet angels if if you're not i'm telling you they were working it that's right brother mike they out there why did god have this prophet mentioned in front of again because he knows that i'll read it again he said revelation 10 7 the seventh angel's message now remember that's right at the seven trumpets and there's seven angels blow seven trumpets that's what we're coming to next but remember where we're very we're specifically it said the angels not the seventh angels trumpet he says but the seventh angel's message he said see not he said see not the trumpet angel the message angel the angel only sounded you see the trumpet the seventh angel the trumpet angel but this says in the days of the message of the seventh angel he says see when his message is finished that's the church age message that's why the pastor brother steve didn't know he was going he started telling you about the church ages he started telling you about the seals you got to run the messengers together you got to see the message in the age you had faith virtue knowledge temperance brotherly kindness

word should be finished he says now look what a day we're living in look at those seals how that draw that scattered the word of god he said what luther and all the rest of them those great reformers that went forth come right back and showed it in the bible he said where they be he said every man right to his spot what he would do and what would happen to the church what would he do and what would happen to the church he said and then in the last day when we know nothing about it us of a certain thing happened and even the newspaper and things picked it up and oh and comes right down and reveals it ties the mysteries together amen excuse me brother that sub line to me he said the line he says he says the sub line lines the word up it lines it up when god that's why you hear the pastor always say it runs perfectly with the scriptures because it came out of the scriptures it was hidden in the scriptures it was a mystery that was revealed in the end time by the holy ghost under the anointing of jesus christ the messenger in the end time christ is now on the scene he's only the believer whatever you want you can ask him if you're a true believer if you need healing for somebody

right for the millennium he says him this somebody made him that but the angel of the lord come down and bought up all them isms and poured out that truth out of it and presented it there it is just as perfect as it can be no other way you could you could go there it is what's that what he is the serpency and all those different things so mysteriously among the people what is it this is the sign

glorious day oh glorious day glorious day hallelujah let's give the lord a hands tonight amen hallelujah as you continue to play softly amen you jesus hallelujah thank you brother kelly thank you amen [Music] hallelujah going to ask you a question [Music] when do you want to serve god i wish the whole church was here when are you going to decide to serve god amen amen if we keep living the way we were living before and if we keep doing everything the way we were doing and just continuing with the trend of this world we're gonna miss god amen when do you wanna live for god branham says that we were designed to achieve things and that design need to depend on god amen and every time we do things for our own motives and objectives whatever we do we are doomed for failure amen and brother kelly read the quote here where brother branham said man still doesn't learn how many failure did we have in our lives how many times we did things and he failed and why did he fail because we were leaning upon our own understanding over and over and over and over and we keep doing the same thing over and over amen brother kelly spoke about the clock here amen and he explained that if one thing is out of order amen you are causing trouble to the whole clock amen [Music] i can prove you i'm not boasting i can sit down with you and prove to you that i don't have time based on what i have to do amen i can prove you i can sit down with you and show you that i gotta do this i gotta do this i gotta do this therefore i cannot be in church tonight amen i can prove you and give you all my schedule and show you that i must miss church to it amen we don't understand those things if you don't give god preeminence if you don't want to put your car in neutral if you don't want to stop the way you were living before and pull a break and believe the supernatural that god you designed me as a god you created me like a god you made me as a son of god and i have lived this life for so long depending and planning on things according to my intellect i'm reaching a point that i'm gonna live by faith amen because if you have responsibility here in the church to be a musician and you put your own life first [Music] do you follow me and your responsibility is struggling because you don't want to be there you're not going to answer to me you're gonna answer it to god do you hear me if you care you better sit on a chair than taking a responsibility and you can't make it amen if you are a deacon and you have a responsibility and your clock is not ticking the way it's supposed to be because you have a reason you have a job you have to do this you have to do this and you are forgetting one thing god can give you another sleep within four hours amen you can sleep three hours and you can feel like somebody who slept eight hours amen if you give him the preeminence i'm not saying you don't have to sleep but if you are trusted and there are stuff that a trustee need to do and you are not up to your responsibility if you're a treasurer if you're supposed to be in church on wednesday if you're supposed to be on church on sunday and you let everything take over because you always have a reason to justify what you're doing to justify not coming to church to justify missing church to justify not being able to drive one on this day you won't have to do that but you're going to go through the tribulation period god is trying to help you amen god is trying to help you god is here to help you god is here to open up the supernatural so that you can live a victorious life without struggling you don't have to work too much for your life somebody already worked for you amen you can work 80 hours a week and you can have a car accident and lose all of it amen [Music] nobody's gonna have a car accident i'm just showing you that you can work your life work work work you go home you tired you exhausted you warm out you can do nothing and tomorrow you go back again to work and monday tuesday wednesday thursday until the whole week you numb and the more you do it your body gets over over overworked until you are sitting and you're sleeping you're talking to people you're tired god is trying to help you amen you don't have to fight this life alone it's harder god is here for you activate your faith open the door to your faith believe god for great things god wants you to achieve great things he's just telling you you cannot do it without me as long as you don't want to let him do it you're going to spin around in the mud and it's not going to help because your motives are wrong your objectives are wrong you're trying to do things for you first then the things of god later that's wrong you put god first then put everything else behind then god will take care of everything else i hope you caught it this brother was my powerfully anointed tonight and some of you might be lost because you don't read the message except for the explanation or few examples he gave almost everything brother kelly spoke from the beginning to the end i can pull a quote a quote a quote a quote a scripture almost the entire sermon was based on quote and scripture if you don't listen to the message what are you gonna do we put the cod in your hand you got youtube you got an iphone you can even sleep with the message you can wake up with the message you can drive with a message we're spending three hours here two hours talking on the telephone and the last thing to do we have church tonight and we're late let's pray heavenly father lord have mercy on us father have mercy on your children and help us give you the preeminence fathers your prophet spoke that on your threefold purpose the first one you already fulfilled it in christ father he was that perfect son that demonstrated obedience to your children father now you are requesting only preeminence in the brother where we can let go and let god have his own way father lord if you can help us surrender our life to you if we can you can help us lord give you the first place with that first love in our heart lord then we're gonna soar in that unsearchable riches in christ that power that have not been touched before and we're gonna be living a supernatural life of experience daily as adam was in the garden of eden lord you will never send your word and your word will return to you void father you restore us back to the fellowship that was in the garden of eden and you prove it temporarily in the life of the prophet lord that if the people that knew you will do exploit lord father your children are walking father on the street your children are walking on foot why lord father servant are riding on horses that was something that solomon saw and lord father puzzle him because the princes were walking on foot and the servants were on the horses but father may you help us be the true princes filled with wisdom where we can be in the position where you want us to be lord where we can learn to lord surrender our life lord and give you the first place lord regardless of what is going on in our life may we always give you first because when we give you the first place the preeminence lord father you told us to seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and everything else shall be added unto us father you gave an example of the build of the air how his lord father not even laboring lord hardy lily is not even working for his manufacturer but father you take care of them how much more the children of god father may you help us lord overcome this wisdom of the devil this our lord civilization this system that we have been trapped into it lord and father may you free us completely lord for this complex and lord help us soul like ego in the realms of faith where all things are possible to them that believe lord we thank you for this powerful message tonight and we are committing ourself and each family unto the hand father lead us and guide us and protect us until we reach our respective place lord and keep consecrating us lord more and more to die more on our own lord and to give you more preeminence lord so that you can fulfill that which you're still keeping us here on earth because you send us here for purpose lord we ambly ask it and commit everything unto the hand in the name of jesus christ may you bless your children and protect them may your your grace continue to shine and give them strength lord to let loose lord and let you take the preeminent father we ambly ask it in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you church you dismiss [Music] i had destiny playing this song and brother shango quoted it as in his prayer and all these things shall be added [Music] [Applause] the kingdom of god and is righteousness
