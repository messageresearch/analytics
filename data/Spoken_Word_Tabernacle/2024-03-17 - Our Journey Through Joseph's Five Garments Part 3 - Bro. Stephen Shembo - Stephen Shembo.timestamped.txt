[52:03] reading our Bible twice a day two
[52:06] chapters amen uh you know job had to
[52:11] make sure that his children were doing
[52:13] the right
[52:14] thing amen and he had to put up a

[52:20] sure all kids are protected so I need to
[52:23] make sure you all doing the right thing
[52:25] and you are protect protected under the

[52:31] Church ages 70 weeks of Daniel the seals
[52:34] adoption or somebody is listening or
[52:37] reading the message of the hour amen
[52:40] yesterday we have a Young's men meeting
[52:43] and we talked about the priorities and
[52:47] depths so hopefully by the grace of God
[52:50] I don't want anybody to be in depth in
[52:52] this church so the young people should
[52:54] be free from that and Lord's
[52:57] next time we will talk to them about how
[52:59] to get out of depth if you already in
[53:02] trouble amen so they know what it is
[53:05] they know the principle of the Bible
[53:07] because every time you take a depth you
[53:09] actually hiring yourself
[53:11] yeah ask the young people who tell you
[53:14] approve them by the scripture every time
[53:16] you take a
[53:18] depth you hire
[53:21] yourself to work for somebody that's
[53:24] right approved to them by the scripture
[53:26] that's right
[53:27] you ask them they will tell you the
[53:29] secret amen so brother abble please you
[53:32] work with me on the next day and we get
[53:34] them squared away amen Lord's willing on
[53:37] March the 23rd this is our question and
[53:39] answer and our young Sisters Meeting
[53:42] will be on April the 20th amen I
[53:46] mentioned about friendship last Sunday
[53:48] and I back it up with the quotes of
[53:50] brother Bram I believe I give you I
[53:52] don't know three or four quot or two
[53:55] quotes about friendship and also what I
[53:57] spoke on Wednesday about whatever you're
[54:00] doing look at the coming of the Lord by
[54:02] keep working I gave you four quot to
[54:05] back up everything so whoever is in
[54:07] there you should receive those quot and
[54:09] keep it for yourself amen we have some
[54:12] wonderful singing going on I'm sitting
[54:14] there and I was thinking because God is
[54:16] doing great things in this church and
[54:19] elsewhere I have powerful testimony I
[54:21] even have images of them before and
[54:24] after so maybe one day brother Kelly
[54:26] we'll find maybe a Wednesday where we
[54:29] pray get some testimonies first and then
[54:33] some good singing and we
[54:35] pray the testimony will boost your faith
[54:39] and you see the before and after what
[54:41] God is doing is in people's life it will
[54:43] Amaze you completely God is
[54:46] alive amen I didn't prepare that but
[54:49] maybe one of this day if it's uh the
[54:52] person will let me do it I'll put it up
[54:54] on the screen and you will see what God
[54:56] is doing
[54:57] in people's life how God is transforming
[54:59] that power that resurrect power of the
[55:03] Holy Spirit you see what he's doing in
[55:05] people's body amen so I don't see any
[55:08] problem in your life that the Lord
[55:09] cannot tackle whatever is going on God
[55:12] is more than able to do it amen so we
[55:15] ready for part three let's go ahead and

[55:49] the mother continue to pray for the
[55:51] family so the Lord will strengthen them
[55:53] amen am glory to God let's go straight
[55:55] to our scripture
[55:56] in Genesis chapter
[56:00] 15 yes
[56:03] sir the mic is up too
[56:08] high praise God
[56:11] better
[56:12] better

[56:17] for this it's
[56:20] working how do you do all this thing how
[56:23] do you go to the young men meeting and
[56:25] then you leave and you go do all of
[56:27] these and you come back and you have to
[56:28] preach in the morning I taught the young
[56:31] people the young sisters and the young
[56:32] Brothers the first principle in finances
[56:35] you need to know how to budget your
[56:38] time if you budget your time well you
[56:41] will accomplish many things we all have
[56:43] 24 hours that's it it some in 24 hours
[56:48] they only do one thing some will do 10
[56:52] know how you budgeting your time poverty
[56:55] link directly if not knowing how to
[56:59] budget your
[57:01] time sleep too much trouble Sleepless
[57:05] trouble you got to balance it up amen
[57:09] let's go to Genesis chapter
[57:12] 15 praise
[57:14] God if you thereare you can say amen
[57:17] amen Genesis 15 don't worry about this
[57:21] sound you'll be okay that's if you want
[57:24] me to remove this you let me know and
[57:27] then I get another one I just like my
[57:30] hand to be
[57:32] free
[57:34] amen Genesis 15 verse 13 if you dare you
[57:39] can say amen amen and he said to
[57:44] Abraham know of
[57:47] assurity that your seed shall Sur in a
[57:53] Strange
[57:54] Land in a
[57:57] land shall be a stranger I'm sorry in a
[58:01] land thank you very much I love your
[58:04] spoken
[58:06] word know of shity that your seed shall
[58:10] be a stranger in a land that is not
[58:15] theirs and Shall Serve them and they
[58:19] shall afflict them 400
[58:24] years you can read this two ways you
[58:27] might be seated you can read what you
[58:32] see and what you see is God is telling
[58:35] uh Abraham that your seed your children
[58:40] will be Stranger in a land and they will
[58:43] afflict them for 400
[58:47] years that's all you can see depending
[58:50] on how you digging but this scripture or
[58:54] this prophecy has the name of Joseph in
[59:02] amen but it's it's there amen but you
[59:06] cannot read it with your eyes read it
[59:09] you need to he it to read it with a
[59:11] spiritual
[59:13] eyes how did you find Joseph here how
[59:16] did you find this prophecy contain many
[59:22] people many people's life are written in
[59:25] this prophecy
[59:28] but if you look you don't see their name
[59:30] depending on how you reading let's read
[59:33] it over
[59:35] again verse 13 and he said to Abraham
[59:39] know of of assurity that your seed the
[59:44] Seed of Abraham is like the sand that is
[59:46] on the
[59:48] seashore so everybody that is the Seed
[59:51] of Abraham is included right
[59:54] here amen amen amen
[59:56] you don't need to see your name written
[59:59] like the way your parent give you that
[1:00:01] is to identify you with your uncle or
[1:00:03] your grandma or your family this is a
[1:00:06] different family and the Bible says and
[1:00:09] your seed shall be a stranger in the
[1:00:12] land that is not
[1:00:14] theirs the question you need to ask
[1:00:17] yourself how are they going to be
[1:00:21] stranger how are they going to move from
[1:00:24] The Promised Land all the way to a
[1:00:27] Strange Land of
[1:00:31] Egypt yes so when you begin to answer
[1:00:34] that question you will see Joseph is
[1:00:35] hidden right
[1:00:37] there because Joseph is the one that
[1:00:40] caus Israel to leave and to go to the uh
[1:00:45] to
[1:00:46] Egypt but if you look you don't see
[1:00:48] Joseph but Joseph is
[1:00:50] there so the life of Joseph was already
[1:00:54] wrapped up amen
[1:00:56] in the prophecy of
[1:01:02] Abraham so whatever Joseph is doing is
[1:01:05] connected to something
[1:01:09] am that's why everything work together
[1:01:12] for good
[1:01:14] amen verse
[1:01:16] 14 and also that nation which is Egypt
[1:01:21] whom they Shall Serve will I
[1:01:24] judge and I afterward shall they come up
[1:01:28] with a great what substance now you can
[1:01:31] read with me differently you can see
[1:01:33] Moses right here
[1:01:36] amen hallelujah you need these things
[1:01:38] are written in the
[1:01:42] tunders they are in the Bible but you
[1:01:45] cannot see them with your hand they are
[1:01:47] not outside the Bible they're written in
[1:01:50] the Bible but they are hidden so right
[1:01:52] here chapter verse uh 13 you got Joseph
[1:01:57] and on verse 14 you got Moses how did
[1:02:00] they came out it was Moses that's right
[1:02:03] so when God is coming he say I remember
[1:02:06] my promises that I made unto Abraham
[1:02:10] that's that's why I have come down to
[1:02:13] deliver my people he's already telling
[1:02:15] Moses you were included in that prophecy
[1:02:18] amen I just hid you so that the devil
[1:02:23] would not decode you that's right
[1:02:27] all of these are hidden under the seven
[1:02:29] seal amen so the life of Joseph way
[1:02:34] before he even come on the scene was
[1:02:37] already written locked up in a prophecy
[1:02:41] your life also is locked up in a
[1:02:44] prophecy am because the Bible say I will
[1:02:47] send
[1:02:50] you who is
[1:02:52] you I will send you who Elijah the
[1:02:55] prophet
[1:02:56] so that prophecy that you is many
[1:03:00] people but as for me and my house am
[1:03:04] they send me William Mar BR so when you
[1:03:08] look in that prophecy depends on what
[1:03:10] you looking at my name is written there
[1:03:12] amen your name is written there and how
[1:03:15] do you know that your name is written
[1:03:17] there look at the way you respond to
[1:03:19] William Mar
[1:03:21] BR in other way you cannot take brother
[1:03:24] brandham out of the picture without
[1:03:25] taking me out amen
[1:03:28] God you cannot put brother Bram in the
[1:03:31] heaven without having
[1:03:37] me and if I'm not there this message is
[1:03:41] not doing what it's supposed to be doing
[1:03:44] because it's me they send me
[1:03:47] me
[1:03:49] am are we together amen let's go to

[1:56:33] trouble brother Bram say so is a what a
[1:56:37] real believer today he is of a what a
[1:56:40] different quality they shall do what
[1:56:42] separate themselves they don't what
[1:56:44] understanding it's what Copper from
[1:56:47] Silver listen to brother Braham in this
[1:56:50] brother Braham say all this
[1:56:52] Believers as we could go on for hours
[1:56:56] all these were like a bunch of what
[1:56:59] change out of your pocket in what God's
[1:57:02] hand brother Bram say Believers are like
[1:57:05] change in God's
[1:57:07] Pocket I'm reading William May
[1:57:10] BR
[1:57:13] penni
[1:57:15] n
[1:57:17] Diamond
[1:57:21] 50 some are $1 some are $5 some are
[1:57:28] 5050 some are $1100
[1:57:32] bill can you say
[1:57:37] Amen you pull out a bunch of what CH
[1:57:40] there is what pennies and what nickel
[1:57:43] what dime what quarter what half of
[1:57:46] dollars what dollar all in what coins
[1:57:49] that is what the world is in God's hand
[1:57:55] amen I'm letting you soak that in amen
[1:57:58] because in this message we say we all
[1:58:00] the same we all the same we all the same
[1:58:02] we all the same we all the same we not
[1:58:03] the
[1:58:05] same you are not brother
[1:58:08] Bram I cannot be brother Bram brother
[1:58:12] Bram is the prophet of the age I am a
[1:58:15] local pastor we are
[1:58:18] [Applause]
[1:58:19] different so don't try to do what
[1:58:22] brother Bram
[1:58:24] did because we are different brother
[1:58:27] Bram say that is what the world is in
[1:58:30] what God's hand there is some people
[1:58:33] that you just can't have a what pen
[1:58:35] worth of it and God can only use them
[1:58:38] for what in a penny way they don't have
[1:58:40] more than a
[1:58:45] penny you you you you you deal with it
[1:58:48] yourself he says and God canot only use
[1:58:52] them in a what a pen way that's all they
[1:58:55] can do
[1:58:57] what so don't expect your friend to
[1:59:01] believe what you believe
[1:59:03] in
[1:59:08] am because maybe his faith is a penny
[1:59:12] your faith is a dollar God is pushing
[1:59:15] you to get a dollar value you are
[1:59:19] blocked with your penis
[1:59:21] friend
[1:59:27] and usually when a penny don't reach
[1:59:30] something he doesn't want anybody else
[1:59:33] to reach
[1:59:35] it and if you try to reach it then he
[1:59:38] will say oh you trying to show off no my
[1:59:42] caliber is a dalar you are a penny
[1:59:46] that's why brother BR say I cannot stand
[1:59:49] in the way of somebody who want to take
[1:59:51] God in his way a because we have
[1:59:53] different level
[1:59:56] am God deals with the genter as
[2:00:04] individual are we together am are we
[2:00:06] together listen to what he says he says
[2:00:10] that God can only use them in a what a
[2:00:13] penny way that's all they can do what
[2:00:16] don't reject them if they can't believe
[2:00:18] the what real truth don't turn them down
[2:00:21] don't kick them out and say they are not
[2:00:24] in there because God uses what pennies
[2:00:26] sometimes lot was just a what
[2:00:33] penny can you say amen amen Abraham was
[2:00:37] a what silver dollar so he taken what
[2:00:41] 100 lots to make who Abraham aund what

[2:06:28] binding she in the water the
[2:06:30] field which job was higher than than the
[2:06:34] other all of them were doing
[2:06:38] what all of them were doing the same
[2:06:42] thing are you following me there is
[2:06:44] something that is uh you know when you
[2:06:46] have a gun when you shoot the next
[2:06:49] bullet goes up and then get into so I'm
[2:06:52] feeling the next bullet is coming up
[2:06:54] already and loading I don't want to
[2:06:56] shoot it yet okay the next one is coming
[2:06:59] up are we together amen he says and
[2:07:02] behold we were all binding what she in
[2:07:05] the field and lo my shei did what arose
[2:07:10] stop so apparently right here all those
[2:07:14] shei were
[2:07:16] dorment amen sir am I reading something
[2:07:20] different
[2:07:22] and they were all binding their
[2:07:25] shei they took the shei they were
[2:07:27] binding the shei Joseph didn't say that
[2:07:31] I took my sheath and I made a
[2:07:38] stand Joseph say the she did what who
[2:07:44] made that sheep to
[2:07:48] arose we need to go in detail now
[2:07:51] who did
[2:07:54] it because brother Bram this is the
[2:07:57] bullet that was loading spoke about
[2:08:00] slave in
[2:08:03] America that were all doing the same
[2:08:08] work and the buyer came but the buyer
[2:08:12] found one of them that was
[2:08:15] different
[2:08:17] amen when everybody was going this way
[2:08:20] that man has his chest up amen chest up
[2:08:24] in the message we call that
[2:08:29] proud in the message rank when you stand
[2:08:32] up like this we say you are proud but
[2:08:36] when the seven Angel met brother he was
[2:08:39] standing up like
[2:08:40] [Applause]
[2:08:44] this
[2:08:46] amen so there was something different
[2:08:49] about that slave than anyone one else
[2:08:52] and he put that St that slave in an
[2:08:57] attitude that is different than
[2:09:00] anyone until his owner never even
[2:09:04] understood
[2:09:08] him he said wait a minute what is wrong
[2:09:11] with this slave he's eating the same
[2:09:14] food doing the same food sleeping in the
[2:09:17] same place but when he react he always
[2:09:20] react different because in the slave was
[2:09:23] a
[2:09:25] revelation
[2:09:26] right the slave knew where he came
[2:09:31] from are we together in this dream all
[2:09:35] the chief were laying down they were all
[2:09:38] each person ruin here Zulan here naftali
[2:09:41] here Asha here all of them were pulling
[2:09:44] their staff together
[2:09:47] suddenly Joseph she
[2:09:50] Rose and
[2:09:52] stood we clear let's read it and behold
[2:09:57] your Chiefs did
[2:10:00] what they did what verse verse seven for
[2:10:04] behold we were banding sheeps in the
[2:10:06] field and L my she did what AR they fill
[2:10:11] this also the world that's what the
[2:10:13] scripture says amen and stood what
[2:10:17] upright who put the shei to stand
[2:10:20] upright God
[2:10:22] J look there Joseph didn't do it the she
[2:10:26] itself stood up there was a
[2:10:29] power that came and selected Joseph
[2:10:35] shei and that power made that shi stand
[2:10:40] upright but that power didn't stop
[2:10:44] there follow me carefully that power
[2:10:48] went and begin to collect other ships
[2:10:53] we clear we clear and behold your shei
[2:10:57] did what your Chiefs did what stood
[2:11:00] round about and made what Obe in other
[2:11:03] words they bow down to who my who made
[2:11:08] the shift to bow
[2:11:12] down Hallelujah are we together the same
[2:11:16] power that erected the Sheep of Joseph
[2:11:20] GL to God is the same power that took
[2:11:24] the other sheep ER wrecked them and made
[2:11:27] them
[2:11:30] bent that's why don't fight
[2:11:35] God the same power that is rising Jesus
[2:11:40] from the dead is the same power that
[2:11:43] will make every
[2:11:45] me to bow down before Jesus Christ amen
[2:11:50] amen when God selected somebody whether
[2:11:55] you like it or not God will bring you to
[2:11:59] understand his own
[2:12:02] language you may fight brother Bram but
[2:12:06] at the end of the day God will show you
[2:12:09] that brother Bram was his
[2:12:15] servant the same power that is rising up
[2:12:19] Joseph is the same power that is taking
[2:12:22] you and making you bent so you recognize
[2:12:25] because that standing of Joseph come
[2:12:28] from God and that bowing down come from
[2:12:35] God am are we together have I lost
[2:12:39] somebody have I lost somebody look at
[2:12:42] his brother verse six and his Brethren

[2:12:51] they always look at the big picture they
[2:12:53] don't see the
[2:12:54] details if they would have asked a
[2:12:57] question wait a minute how did your
[2:12:58] shift

[2:13:02] twice but all they see ah so you mean

[2:13:08] worker you start playing

[2:15:37] going to make them

[2:15:47] wrong brother Bram said Jesus was saying
[2:15:51] things to decrease to F down the
[2:15:59] crowd not to bring them back to him no
[2:16:02] so God chop only this portion and say
[2:16:07] Joseph this is the
[2:16:09] Revelation and Joseph as a prophet he
[2:16:11] can't help her he just woke up in the
[2:16:13] morning I saw a dream all of you were
[2:16:15] bowing
[2:16:18] down which portion why did didn't God
[2:16:21] take the portion when they're going to
[2:16:22] be all in Egypt they're going to be the
[2:16:25] most privileged people because of Joseph
[2:16:27] why didn't God take that portion and
[2:16:29] give it to them so everything will be
[2:16:32] peaceful you need to understand how God
[2:16:34] work we clear now we clear now listen
[2:16:38] now verse n and he dreamed yet another
[2:16:41] dream and told it to who his Brethren
[2:16:44] look at another portion that is
[2:16:46] compatible to the first one it's just
[2:16:49] another version that was a 2023 this is
[2:16:52] a 2024 version of
[2:16:54] it and said behold I have dream what a
[2:16:58] dream more and behold the who the sun
[2:17:01] and the what the moon and the what the
[2:17:04] 11 stars made what Obe to me we have the
[2:17:09] sun we have the moon we have
[2:17:14] how now we not more in we are no more in
[2:17:17] the earth we went to the zodiac
[2:17:21] amen so it's confirming the earth now
[2:17:24] it's confirming the Zodiac in other word
[2:17:27] it must
[2:17:28] happen amen but lacking the
[2:17:32] detail of this dream got them in trouble
[2:17:36] yes sir amen because his father
[2:17:38] interpret the dream his father said the
[2:17:41] son is
[2:17:43] me that's what his father said if you
[2:17:46] look at the next verse he said the Moon
[2:17:48] is your mother and the 11th star as
[2:17:51] these are your
[2:17:52] brother that as far as they can
[2:17:56] go but let me see how Paul interpreted
[2:17:59] this
[2:18:00] dream Paul say in 1 Corinthians chapter
[2:18:03] 15 verse 41 he says what there is only
[2:18:08] what one glory for the what of the Sun
[2:18:12] and what another glory for the what of
[2:18:14] the Moon in other words the glory of the
[2:18:17] sun is different than the glory of the
[2:18:20] Moon amen that's are we together and
[2:18:23] another what glory of the Stars so the
[2:18:26] glory of the sun is different than the
[2:18:30] glory of the moon and the glory of the
[2:18:33] Moon is different than the glory of the
[2:18:36] star but Paul didn't stop
[2:18:40] there we there Paul says that for one
[2:18:45] what star that fell from what another
[2:18:48] star how in glory
[2:18:50] [Applause]
[2:18:52] break it down break it down in other
[2:18:54] word the sun is
[2:18:57] special the Moon is
[2:19:00] special and as much as we all
[2:19:05] stars still among the star one is
[2:19:09] different than the
[2:19:10] other one is a penny one is a silver
[2:19:14] dollar one it's a god of variety even
[2:19:17] though we star we not the same that's
[2:19:20] right amen they miss that portion all
[2:19:24] they see is this man is going to be boss
[2:19:27] over us listen to this my friend William
[2:19:31] Maran Branham brother Bram say we know
[2:19:34] how that the patriarch sold Joseph which
[2:19:37] was what a perfect type of Christ how
[2:19:40] that he being love of what the father
[2:19:43] hated of who the brothers well he was
[2:19:46] what Christ in Joseph so they were
[2:19:48] fighting who Christ in Joseph
[2:19:51] amen and he says and they hated him how
[2:19:55] Without a Cause because he was what
[2:19:57] spiritual he was born how a SE and he
[2:20:00] seen Vision dream dream and interpret
[2:20:03] them he was he he were more what
[2:20:06] spiritual than the rest of his brothers
[2:20:09] and they hated him how Without a Cause
[2:20:12] follow me carefully they ought to have
[2:20:15] loved him more because the first that
[2:20:21] God was what with him
[2:20:24] amen when you see God working with
[2:20:28] somebody you need to be
[2:20:31] careful how you handling that
[2:20:36] person you can get yourself in trouble
[2:20:40] for attacking a sister not Discerning
[2:20:43] the Lord's body

[2:21:54] it sometime you are killing your own
[2:21:59] Prosperity that person will be a
[2:22:02] supervisor and because of him they will
[2:22:04] hire you and you kill him that person
[2:22:06] today you don't know tomorrow he will be
[2:22:08] in a company you going to make an
[2:22:11] application and he will be the one
[2:22:13] sanctioning your
[2:22:16] application but we want to be out I mean
[2:22:18] attacking each other not understanding
[2:22:22] that God is working his own
[2:22:27] purpose and God is always with his son
[2:22:31] who Christ Jesus you know that so just
[2:22:33] do him what favor and see how you do
[2:22:36] what
[2:22:37] Prosper brother Bram continue my friend
[2:22:41] Joseph a perfect example that was who
[2:22:44] Christ in Joseph he says why you notice
[2:22:48] he was loved of what his father despise
[2:22:51] of who his brothers because he was a
[2:22:53] what SE they hated him without a what
[2:22:56] cause the man could not
[2:22:59] help what he was and the other brother
[2:23:02] did what hated him a very good typ of
[2:23:06] what all ages every ages confirmed to be
[2:23:09] the same typ what are you trying to come
[2:23:12] out now with this coat of many colors
[2:23:16] last Sunday you say it was the Holy
[2:23:18] Spirit that got into Joseph the coat of
[2:23:21] many color what do you have today that
[2:23:24] you promis to us on Sunday this is
[2:23:26] William Maran Bram follow me
[2:23:29] carefully notice again when he was born
[2:23:33] his father loved him and he made him a
[2:23:36] coat of what many colors now there is
[2:23:39] only seven colors in all colors that's a
[2:23:42] teaching my friend all other are made
[2:23:45] off of these colors and the coat perhaps
[2:23:48] had color in it or seven different color
[2:23:52] straps or color into the coat that the
[2:23:55] father made if you
[2:23:58] notice maybe who Jacob Jacob didn't
[2:24:02] understand at that time but that signify
[2:24:07] a what promised
[2:24:09] one the coat of many colors brother
[2:24:13] brandham say it is an indication that
[2:24:17] that person is the promised one yes sir
[2:24:23] amen that was natural now it's done in a
[2:24:28] spiritual he says when God gave Noah the
[2:24:31] rainbow son the seven color it was the
[2:24:34] what promise or a what Covenant one a
[2:24:38] promised one or a what a covenant one
[2:24:42] what does he mean a covenant one Amen
[2:24:46] brother Bram continue he said God had
[2:24:49] made a covenant that he would destroy
[2:24:52] the world no more with water water so
[2:24:55] brother Bram is saying when they gave
[2:24:58] Joseph a coat of many
[2:25:00] colors God was
[2:25:02] indicating that among the children of
[2:25:06] Jacob the one that I
[2:25:09] chose the one that is the promise the
[2:25:14] one that me God have a covenant with him
[2:25:18] is
[2:25:19] Joseph
[2:25:21] in other word the court of many has a
[2:25:27] message hang tight my friend listen to
[2:25:31] this how Moses went down into Egypt
[2:25:34] brought them out before they got out how
[2:25:37] they got down there had Joseph a perfect
[2:25:41] typ of who Christ how he was born in
[2:25:44] amidst his brother hated of his who
[2:25:47] Brothers love of his what father
[2:25:50] quat of what many colors which means
[2:25:53] what
[2:25:55] distinction God made the
[2:25:59] distinction right by
[2:26:03] G sir by giving the coat of many color
[2:26:07] among many brothers as much as we grow
[2:26:11] up
[2:26:12] together as much as we are all in this
[2:26:15] together God Will Make A
[2:26:18] Distinction on someone for a
[2:26:22] [Applause]
[2:26:24] purpose what is a
[2:26:27] distinction a distinction is a
[2:26:32] difference it is a
[2:26:34] contrast between similar things or
[2:26:38] similar people we all look alike we all
[2:26:43] are human being yet there will be
[2:26:46] something in particular that will
[2:26:49] separate one person from
[2:26:52] another yes sir are we together this
[2:26:57] distinction house or hide a
[2:27:02] message this distinction is a
[2:27:08] bait God uses to attract the
[2:27:14] [Music]
[2:27:17] devil so that the devil can
[2:27:22] activate God's plan in your life towards
[2:27:26] your
[2:27:30] destination that's why everything work
[2:27:34] together for
[2:27:37] good at the beginning nobody knew Joseph

[2:50:38] become of what dream they want to
[2:50:40] challenge whose
[2:50:41] dream Joseph Joseph Dream who gave
[2:50:44] Joseph the dream God so they're trying
[2:50:47] to challenge the purpose of F they
[2:50:49] trying to challenge the thought of who
[2:50:52] they trying to challenge the counsel of
[2:50:54] who they trying to challenge the
[2:50:56] pleasure of who but his thought his
[2:50:59] purpose his counsel his pleasure what he

[2:51:06] challenge something that a deal that is
[2:51:09] already closed by the Supreme Court yes

[2:51:38] he might do what rid him out of their
[2:51:40] hand to deliver him back to his what his
[2:51:42] father again Ruben get a
[2:51:46] plan and the plan of Ruby work the first
[2:51:50] plan don't kill him because God purpose
[2:51:52] must be fulfilled but the second plan of
[2:51:55] Ruben is against the will of
[2:51:59] God he looks good he sounds good Ruben

[3:06:09] pain through difficulty through
[3:06:13] suffering Father I remember when I sat

[3:06:25] anymore to church people
[3:06:28] discouraged people shattered people
[3:06:32] confused families that we were together
[3:06:35] we can no longer Fellowship anymore
