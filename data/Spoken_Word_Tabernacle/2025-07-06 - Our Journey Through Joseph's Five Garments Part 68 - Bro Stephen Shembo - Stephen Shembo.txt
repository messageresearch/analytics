Oh God, and I you Lord, we thank you for that pull once again, Lord God, that you've drawn us into your house this morning, Lord God. that you've drawn us into your presence, Lord Jesus. We thank you, Father, for this wonderful little place that we can meet you, Lord God. We thank you for everything that you're doing in our lives, Lord God, each day and everything you're doing for us here, Lord God, revealing yourself to us more and more as we gather together, Lord, in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Lord, we thank you. And Lord, we want to just make a big deal out of today, Lord God, because we get to be with you, Lord God, this morning and this afternoon, Lord. And we just want to just want to welcome you in, Lord God. And just ask that you take a seat right beside us on the pew this morning, Lord God. We want you up here on the platform in the holiest of holies, Lord. And we want you in our hearts, Lord God. We want you on the stream, Lord God, that those watching, Lord, may receive the same anointing, Lord God, and the same presence that we have here, Lord God. We want to ask also, Lord, that you bless our precious musicians, Lord Jesus. Sometimes, Lord, it sounds like the angels are joining in, Lord God, with heavenly instruments. It's just more than what's on the platform, Lord. The same with the voices as we lift our voices to heaven, Lord. There's more here, Lord, than we can see, Lord God. And we can hear them. We can hear them, Lord. And we just ask, Lord God, we know they're encamped about us, Lord. Let them rejoice that we're gathering as well as people, Lord, as children of God, as sons of God and daughters of God. May you have your perfect will with everything that is said and done today, Lord God, and everything that transpires, Lord. Go to that front room once again, Lord, as I ask each Sunday, and touch our pastor, Lord. We know, Lord, we know the gift that you have sent us, Lord God. We know that it's not just a man when he comes out, and we want to give you the glory, Lord. So let him move himself out of the way, Lord, that you may speak once again this morning. Lord, do the same for all of us, Lord, as musicians and singers, Lord, even as the congregation, Lord, this very special people that has gathered in your name, Lord God, and the diligence, Lord, in our hearts to not let anything stop us from meeting when those doors are open, Lord God. We thank you, Father. You are a faithful God to us, Lord Jesus. So, how could we be anything less back to you. So, we thank you, Father. We give this service to you and everything about it, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. And amen. Let's give the Lord a clap offering this morning. Amen.

I do have uh some things to read and we have two testimonies this morning and then we have two specials. So, I don't know where to start. Um I'm going to start with the one that I that I wrote down this morning as a praise report. I wanted to um not only personally but I guess for my family in the church. Um, thank the FBI for opening up their home for the fun day this year and the birthdays. Amen. And for the fellowship and uh giving us an opportunity also to um get to know brother blessing and brother Phillip a little bit better. We had such a wonderful time. It was truly a blessing just the fellowship all around. And we just we just want to thank you very much for all the hard work and the sacrifice. Amen. Praise God. Praise God. Now, Sister Lorel wrote something also. Um she said she would like to thank all the saints for the birthday wishes and the lovely fellowship on Friday. She says, "May God bless you always." Um may God always bless you with a full measure. pressed down and running over. Amen. And that's that's from Luke. Amen. Luke 6. She said, "Love you dearly." Amen. And she also um wants to welcome her friend Cherylyn. She came all the way from Trinidad for Sister Lurel's birthday. Was there she's been here for a little while and uh and uh we enjoyed getting to meet her and we just want to make her feel welcome here at Spoken Word as well. Amen. Praise God. Sister Lurel said, "We used to be the young people in our church back home, the youth." So, you see where it goes. It goes to many blessings to a lot of people. Amen. Praise God. Amen. So, I have one prayer request that was written down. Actually, two. Um Chris and Rebecca are traveling back from Tennessee today. um after, you know, the pretty difficult week that they've gone through. We've spoken with them several times and uh so um we just want to ask for traveling mercy there. And uh this one was kind of for me, you know, there was um there was a flood in Texas. Uh it was kind of a flash thing. It sounded very similar to what we experienced in our mountains here. Um but this affected a uh Christian youth camp and it wiped out uh the whole camp and they're still they're still recovering um children mostly girls. So we want to u plus you know we we've heard stories of people who lived in in RVs on the river banks and they were destroyed or carried away the cars and everything everything that they owned. So, they're suffering over there. And I don't know if I don't know if any believers were affected as far as message believers, but um you know, we just want to um ask for mercy from God um for the families of the flood victims this morning. So, I just thought it would be appropriate to um to bring that up if we could stand. Amen. Brother Michael Omach, do you mind coming up and praying over these things this morning, sir? remember each other as well. Amen. I'm sure we could go to everybody in here and they could say, "Man, I'm going through something or I'm happy about something." We just want to love each other. Amen. With everything that's in us. Thank you, Lord. God bless you. We are thankful for the Lord to allow us to come to his house this morning. I think all of us we are ready. All right. Yeah. So, let him feel welcome. Let us pray. Father, we come before you as your children. What opportunity to come to meet you in this house where we come every day to magnify and to lift your name up, oh father, to glorify you, to show you that we love you, Father, because you first loved us, Father, and you died for us, oh God. Thank you, Lord, for the sweet spirit that is already here, Father. Oh God, how we thank you Lord for this little group that you have set aside. Oh God, I look forward one of these days. Oh father, we'll say the the camp for the group from Gastonia. Oh Lord, and we'll see. Hallelujah. Our first Oh God, there father and we are all piling up. Oh God, what a great day it will be. Father, thank you father for the requests that have been made of God. prayers, even thanksgiving for the day Sister Lorel's birthday. Oh God, we Lord want thank you for that family. Oh God, they are instrumental in your in your gospel. Father, Father, may you continue to bless them, oh God. Thank you, Lord, for brother Chris and Rebecca. Oh God, Lord, lead them all the way as they come back. Oh Lord, Father, give them traveling mercies. or the flood in Texas. Oh, Father, you said you'll be in us and with us, Father. We are not immune to the troubles that we have in this world. But your promise is that you'll be with us. Father, may you take care for what has happened in Texas and the believers and the children that are there. Bless us here. The needs that are in your children here. Father, may provide them. Oh God, there are many also that are online. Father, looking unto you, oh father, as we com combine our faith together. Father, come down. Oh father, feel welcome. Father, take a hold of the preacher today. Our dear pastor is just human just like any other father. But you decided to use man. Father, may use him today to talk to your children. Bless the tithes and offerings, Father. May you bless them father that they may be used for the benefit of the gospel father. Father at the end of the time when we are finished here let us go out there happy father saying thank you lord. Thank you for being with us father. Thank you for speaking to us. Thank you for healing us. Thank you for providing for us father. We love you and we bless you father. In Jesus name we pray. Thank you. Y'all can be seated. Sister Zatty has a quick testimony she'd like to give and then brother Seth has one as well this morning and we're excited to hear those here. Um God bless you saints. Um I just felt led to share this very small testimony. Um the other day I was um trying to get on one of my accounts so that I can do what I do which is driving sometimes. Um and I was having very a hard time doing so. Um it was like locked for some reason. and it wanted me to take a verification photo. Um, and so I was trying to do everything I could to do it, but what was wrong is my phone memory was full. And so I was very frustrated cuz I have a quota that I try to reach every week. And as soon as um I looked at it, I was I was not able to get through. And so uh something came to me was like this is such a small matter. Why can't you pray about it? It was just talking about the simplicity of like what we say we believe in, but we can't even, you know, take the time just to ask God for something so simple because we think it's minute, but he cares about all things. And so, um, I quickly just bowed my head and I was like, "Lord, you know, my situation at this very moment, you know, I need to be able to get on this account so I can do what I need to do." And it wasn't even um, less than 10 minutes. I turned the phone off. I turned it back on and and I really was believing. I said, "I I know it's going to go through this time because it's like he he he's going to answer me." And um I turned the phone back on. I went to the app and it immediately turned back on. I was able to do what I needed to do and finish my quota. So, I just told the Lord, I said, "I'm going to give a praise report because he's faithful." Amen. Our God is faithful. Amen. Amen. I just wanted uh to give this praise report a testimony. Man, I know many of us might have even forgotten what happened two years ago, but um just thinking about it, it's been 2 years since my wife had a kidney transplant, right? And it has been a testimony to my family and the whole church. We just want to bless the name of the Lord for all what he's been doing. Amen. It's Amen. Um we we went to see the we had a doctor's appointment that was last um Tuesday. Last Thursday. Yes. And and then one thing that um she said was that the the the major issue they deal with with transplant patient is with um their hemoglobin. Right. So that's something that they constantly deal with when anybody gets um um done with a transplant. But then right from day one, her hemoglobin hit the right spot. And since then, it has never changed. They never had to deal with that issue. So it's it's just a testimony. We just want to give to the name of the Lord. Amen. Amen. And and one other thing that uh I would want to say uh my wife gave a testimony some time back and then a brother came to me and said that we are sealing that with this token. I just want to thank the Lord for brothers and sisters who believe who believe in confessing before whatever we expecting happens. Amen. And I know the Lord is preparing for us to receive that token. Amen. And God bless you. Amen. Amen. Amen. Now, if you if you if you think you have a problem, just think about sister coach. She has been a very blessed lady and just a blessing to all of us as well. I didn't give this testimony last Sunday and I couldn't leave today. The Lord brought it back. But the day of my birthday, Brother Robert was out with the tractor, big tractor, big wheels, and he was moving a log. I was sitting outside and the Lord said, "Do not go inside. Stay there." And I'm watching him with the chainsaw and he's cutting up the the log from the tree that fell. I'm going to go inside again. He said, "Do not go inside. You sit right there." Hada came outside. She said, "What are you doing here?" I said, "Well, the Lord told me to sit here. I'm watching Robert with that chainsaw, but he's just telling me don't leave." She said, "Okay, mom." She didn't finish say that. I heard Laurel. Hear that? And I heard it again. Laurel, she took off running. I'm thinking it's the chainsaw. She got there behind before me. So, she's there trying to push this tractor. It had a little incline to go up and she couldn't get the the tractor to move. I don't know where the string came from. I got there, but the rubber foot was pinned. You know there is a a part at the back that you can add attachments to and that's the slipped and pinned his foot and his foot was under this metal and the tractor is running and it's the brake is on and when I saw it I don't know what happened saints the Lord just give me a strength I went behind that wheel and there's a little incline and the Lord give me the strength to push the tractor off and the tractor moved and went up the hill and we were just thanking the Lord and we looked We looked at his foot and you can see the imprint from the metal resting on it. He got no broken bones. He got no fracture. He got nothing. His foot, his foot swollen a little bit, but the next day it went down. He's walking normal. And I just want to thank God for the word we've been getting with obedience to listen to God. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Hallelujah. We're going to ask brother Tmaine to come up this morning and sing. He has a special on his heart. Amen. And then we have the sisters going to sing as well. Praise God. God bless you, saints. Everybody good? All right. Well, I'm good, too. Had this song on my heart. Um, I'mma try if you all if you know it, sing it with me. And like brother John said, we mess up, we mess up together. God bless you. Thank you, Jesus. I lift my hands and told to adoration unto you. You reign on the throne. Cuz you are God and God alone. Because of you, my cloudy days are gone. And I can sing to you this song. I just want to say that I love you more than anything. I lift my hands in to let the rain shine onto you. You reign on the throne. For you are God and God alone. Because of you, my cloudy days are gone. And I can sing to you this song. I just want to say that I love you more than anything. Hold me in your arms and you are my shelter from the storm.

I had a short testimony and um just want to let you know that all last week it's been it was a rough week. Satan was coming at me at the job and and I even had a lady ask me, "What kind of Christian are you?" And I said, "I'm a Christian that believes in Jesus Christ." Because I have testimonies and testimonies on testimonies. But this week, for some reason, I couldn't I couldn't even get out of my room. Friday and Saturday, I couldn't move. Body was hurting. And then it dawned on my heart, it said that no matter what we going through, Jesus has always been there. And I could I could have sat there and complained and murmuring and everything. And they and I thought about it. I said, "Look what God went through to save all of us." And it's like now I know I woke up this morning. And I said, I'm going to get up and I'm going to church and I'm going to sing because it wasn't nothing that was going to stop the blessing of God. And God bless you. Amen. Praise God. Amen.

That's wonderful. The 70 weeks of Daniel, the seals adoption or somebody is listening to the message of the hour. Amen. July 19, as a reminder, it's a question and answer. August the 9th, it's a part two with a young man on courtship. And uh September 20th, it's part seven for married couple. I will see about the two questions that were given to me because I'm trying to shift and get into finances based on the scripture and based on the message of the hour. Amen. I know there is a lot of going on with finances. I want to stay within the scripture and within the message of the hour. Amen. So married couple meeting September 20th. I don't know what you did but increase it for me my ear. The young sisters meeting it's September the 27th Lord's willing. I have not gotten a specific subject about it. So if I don't get it by the end of the month, what we will do, we will sit with you on oneonone question and answer about everything we cover before. Is that okay with you? Uh a few people. Amen. Because I don't want somebody who come and say no. Is that okay? So if you can get all your questions, send them to me. We sit with the pastor and the deacon and my wife and the deacon wife. we sit and let's go ahead and talk wherever you miss something or you you didn't understand something correctly. Let's go ahead and review that and make sure everything is soaking in. Is that okay? So, brother Kelly, you heard me. Brother Tony, you heard it. Brother Robert, you heard it. And congregation heard it. So, I got a witness. This is what we will do. Amen. So, do me a favor. Send me your question. just go ahead and send send it directly or give it or put it in a question box there and we'll go ahead and deal with it. Amen. The building is progressing pretty good. If you see a stop or something slowing, there is two cases. Either we're waiting for an inspection or either some diero is running a little low and then uh brother set needs some reminders. Amen. But by God's grace, the big deal is already taken care of. the top of over there. It's already connected. So, I'm looking at the big bill of $67,000 for the uh what do you call it? The the foundation of the the the whole metal building is already there. We just need to put the foundation, pour the slab, and then they erect everything together. But I'm still dealing with this. I don't have money, but I have a big God, and I have more than that one. Amen. Amen. So whatever I do, whatever is coming up, I mean like in a war, whatever is coming up is going straight. Thank God everything is working well. Amen. So what you can do, do it. God will bless you. He loves a cheerful giver. And I'm glad I didn't preach that. And he was not even a minister. I mean a minister from this church that preach it. So you know it's not brother Kelly, it's not brother Polycrop, it's not brother Steven. So it's coming from the Lord. A cheerful giver. Brother Freddy, when they giving offering, look at their faces. Look at their faces. They need to smile. Put in that offering. Look at them faces. Amen. Amen. You need to be happy because you cannot outgive God. And I thank God he gave me a job so that when I'm working the finances can go toward the progress of the church. So God knew how to orchestrate everything. Amen. Lord willing at the end of the service we will have a water baptism again. It's going to be somebody who want to be rebaptized and it's very important because I know the background a little bit. So that is wonderful that the Lord have touched him. Amen. Uh one last announcement. I don't know what's wrong. He looks like but it's the devil because once in a while he looks like somebody come up with something crazy in the message rank but uh we already went about we already talked about this in detail. It's on YouTube. I talked about the god of variety. You remember that in a hotel and we gave you quote we gave you scripture and everything is correct is clear. Amen. So for some reason overseas somebody it was an African-American who want to marry a Caucasian. So they presented to them into the church and they came up with a quote that have been fabricated. So if you know about the story you see people circulating quote online that quote is not true. It doesn't exist. So somebody manufacture a quote of brother Brandham and use even the sermon title of brother Brham and put it there where brother Brandham say it is not a sin and it's not true the court doesn't exist and the same message they use is the message brother Brandham is actually condemning it so I'm going to get two original table of the message and I will keep them in this church here because the devil is so aggressive now that they begin to manufacture quote in the man. That quote came from hell. Yes, he did. Can you say amen? So if somebody comes and say, "Oh, brother Brandham say he never say that." You will never find that quote in an English version. It doesn't exist. It's not on the tape. Amen. Stick with what brother Brham says. Are we together? Are we together? I'm not ashamed to say what I believe. Black people marry black people.

Whenever somebody brings you a quote and it sounds different like it's contradicting the message as a whole, push the brake. Amen. Go verify the quote. And make sure the quote is there. Amen.

So what drove Ic out of Israel? Famine. Famine. We clear? Amen. Famine drove them out. You know the story in between. I'm going to skip for the sake of time. Jump to verse six. Then she arose with her, we know Malon and Killian. All of them died. We already know the story. That's right. Then she arose, speaking of Naomi, with her daughtersin-law, and she that she may return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord has visited his people in giving them water. So when God begin to bless Israel, Naomi left to go back. In other words, there was no more famine. It was famine that drove them out. By when bread came back, Naomi turned around and going back. Amen. Are we together? Amen. So it was bread that pulled them back home. Amen. Are we together? Amen. There was a blessing that came. Yes, sir. Amen. Amen. Amen. But bread doesn't come in one day. No. No. It is first planted as a seed. Uhhuh. And then there is a time that the seed need to grow. Then it need to be harvested and then worked on there and then cooked. Then you get bread. Amen. Are we together? Amen. But they heard that there was bread. Bread. Food. Yes. Because famine is no food. Bread means we got food. Amen. Now they can go back. Are we together? Amen. Praise God. Jump to verse 11. I'm skipping because you know the story. And Naomi say, "Turn again, my daughters." He's talking to Ruth and Oprah. Why will you go with me? Remember, both of them are widows. That's right. Are we together? Amen. And a widow has a category here that she falls under. Yes, sir. I hope we are together. Amen. Checked. Yes, sir. We clear. Amen. All right. So Naomi said, "Turn again, my daughters. Why will you go with me? Are there yet any more sons in my womb?" "That they may be your husband." This is under the law. That's it. Are we together? Amen. In other words, there is no more hope. Yes. For you to have a husband from me because I only had two. Both of them are gone. I don't have any. And as a matter of fact, my husband also is dead. So if you follow me, you will remain single. Are we together? Amen. Verse uh uh 12. Turn again, my daughters, go your way. Amen. For I am too old. In other words, even though my husband is dead, Uhhuh. I have a right to remarry, but look at my age. Amen. I look already like a grandma. So even if grandma have somebody and if I have a Okay. Okay. No, no. Let me read the Bible because I don't want any problem. Let me read the Bible. For I am too old to have a husband. And if I should say I have hope that when I go there somebody will say grandma. Uhhuh. If I have hope if I should have have a husband also when tonight and should also bear what? In other words even if I get pregnant right now. Uhhuh. Amen. Would you tar for them until they were grown? Amen. Amen. Amen. Would you stay for them for having husband from having husband? Nay, my daughters, for it grieve me much for your sake that the hand of the Lord is gone out against me. In other word, if you follow me, I want to make sure you have an informed consent. Amen. Amen. Me and you sat down, I explain you the whole case. Number one, I don't have children. Number two, even if I get a children and I have a baby right now, you will not be there waiting. And in other words, don't compromise your youth. You have more freedom right now that you are widows to go than to follow me. So the message of Naomi is hopeless. Amen. Amen. Are we together? Amen. He doesn't have any hope for a marriage. Amen. He doesn't have any hope for a husband. Amen. If you follow me, just know you will remain single. Amen. Are we together? Amen. And Ruth was not only a widow woman, but she was also a stranger. Amen. Amen. Amen. Are we together? Amen. Are we together? Amen. Checked. Amen. Amen. Now jump to verse 16. We are going slowly. So we get there. Verse 16. And Ruth say, "Entreat me not to leave you. I understand what you say. But please don't push no more." I got enough of this. Don't push no more. You keep pushing, pushing, pushing. You don't understand. Uh-uh. Amen. Intreat me no more. Amen. Amen. Not to leave you or to return from following after you.

Amen. Amen. Amen. Are we together? Amen. So by faith, Ruth is a Jew. But if you struggle with her, she can also say, "Okay, if you call, if you consider me a stranger, Yes, sir. I still have a right." Amen. So both ways I'm winning. Amen. Are we together? Amen. Are we together? Amen. He says, "Your people shall be my people and your God."

And she said to them, "Call me not," this is Naomi, the entering in in Bethlehem. "Call me not Naomi, call me Mara," which means bitter. For the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me. I went out how? For and the Lord has brought me home again how empty. So, how did Naomi came back to Israel? Empty. Empty means what? Poor. And we know right here on my table, please my friend, I have to go slowly with this lesson. We know right here that there is another category that qualify to the DSS. Amen. Uh, are we together? Amen.

It is now exceedingly. That's right. And abundantly. I I don't know if we together. This one you can take it every day. So roof got more than 200%. Amen.

When I have broken the bands of their yoke and delivered them out of those that serve themselves of them. Uhhuh. It is a fortressless. Amen. Yes. Amen. Are we together? Amen. Let's finish with this my friend because uh I'm one minute over. Let me stop here. The Bible say in the book of Deuteronomy, I have not even read one quote of brother. You got to read one. Hallelujah. The Bible say a land in Deuteronomy 1 11 the Bible say a land which the Lord the God has what care for. Let me lay this principle so we can be good next Sunday if the Lord uh Terry. Amen. Ah season ah let's go. He says a land which the Lord that God do what care for. So God is telling Israel that he care for the promised land. Amen. He said I want to put you in the promised land and I take care of it. Amen. How does God take care of the promised land? He says, "The eyes of the Lord thy God are how always when?" Always upon it. From what? From the beginning of the year until what? The end of the year. That's right. Amen. God. Amen. So if you in January, where is God? He's there. If you come here, there. If you go there, he's there. If he's go there, he's there. Notice that the entire year is saturated with the presence of God. Amen. Follow me carefully now. Amen. Amen. But remember the year got season. That's right. Are we together? Amen. Year got four season. But God is everywhere. We get you get it. Amen. And the Bible says it shall come to pass if it shall hearken if you shall listen diligently to my commandment. The message that I'm giving you, we shall command you this day. The message of the day. Amen. The message of William May and Brham for today. That's right. If you pay attention diligently to this message. Amen. To love the Lord your God. Uh-huh. And to do what? Serve him. With what? All your heart. And all your what? That I will give you the rain Uhhuh. of your land when in his due season. Amen. Praise God. Are we together? Amen. The whole year have God. Are we together? Amen. But even though the whole year has God, but the rain doesn't come in the whole year. No, the rain still come in due season. Amen. Let's pick some up. Let's say the rain comes in May, June, July, August. Okay, this is the rainy season. We just pick up something. Just an example. Amen. But the Bible say the eyes of the Lord is in January. Amen. It's in February. Yes, sir. It's in March. It's in April. In May, God is there. Amen. But when May begin to do this, brother so and so believe that now God has come. Amen. I'm going to finish. I'm heading to the airport. I'm going to the airport, my friend. I hope you get that. I'm going to the airport. Help me land the ship, my friend. He said that Dameus give that uh that I will give you the rain of your land when in his due season. the first rain and the what? The latter rain that you may gather in the corn and that one and then what? So the point I'm trying to finish here or to stop here with you is the whole year God is there. That's right. The presence of God is there. Uhhuh. But the blessing doesn't come yet. No. Amen. That's why brother Brham say that material blessing is not a son that God is with you. Uhhuh. I hope you understanding me. Amen. I I hope you're understanding it. So even though what you're looking for, are we together? has not come yet, it doesn't mean God is not there. Amen. Amen. That's what I want you to go with it. It's a matter of season. Amen. The Lord is with you in January. The Lord is with you in February. The Lord is with you in March. But what you looking for will come in May. Amen. I hope you understanding me. Amen. I I hope you're understanding. But from January to April, you kill yourself here. Uhhuh. Kill yourself. Amen. You're talking about fasting. You're talking about prayer. You're talking about meeting. You're talking about running after preacher. You're talking about prayer. You're talking about how many land has been laid. How many prayer line prayer line prayer line prayer line prayer line prayer line prayer line prayer line until we are discouraged because we put our faith in the wrong thing. Amen. There it is right there. We put our faith in people instead of putting our faith in God. Uhhuh. Amen. There's nothing wrong with praying with the people. Uhhuh. But you pressing when it's not the time. Amen. Instead of being relaxed. Lord, I hope you understanding me. Amen. I don't know if you getting me. Amen. Instead of being relaxed here, you stress yourself so much over here. So much. My God. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And you find a lot of scar here, a lot of disappointment here. And when the time come, it's a faultless. God was here. It doesn't mean he didn't hear you. He heard you. He heard you. He heard your prayer. He have what you looking for. But he's waiting for the right time. Amen. and the right season to release it. Amen. That's why the Bible say when the time of the promise drew near. You remember that in the Bible? When the time of the promise drew near, then a pharaoh came. The Pharaoh cannot come if the season have not approached. Pharaoh is coming because the season is coming that we need to go. Amen. And I have a news for you. Can I tell you the news? The pope has come. The pope has come. Another pharaoh has risen. Amen. Because the season has come. We need to know what is the season for. Amen. That's right. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. My friend, let's stop here. Let's stop right here. Amen. Let's stop right here, my friend. Let's stand. Oh, glory. I'm sorry. I went 9 minutes of Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Season an opportunity. I thought I'm going to preach this a whole thing. But the Holy Spirit have a reason why he want me to stop where I stop. He has a reason why he didn't want me to continue. We push too hard. We stress too hard. We have taken too much responsibility of our own life in our own hand. like it's you who is in charge of you. Who told you you in charge of yourself? Amen. God gave you an example when you were a child. He put you under a parent to take care of you to show you you were born to depend. Amen. We know too much. We have too much confidence on ourselves. We think we can do too much. We have so much right. I have to do this. I have to do the you do it. Failure. You do it. Failure. You do it. It doesn't work. You do it in kicking. What am I doing wrong in prayer? Maybe I need to fast. You fast. It doesn't happen. You fast again, it doesn't happen. And when you forget, that's right. When you let it go, when you don't even worry about it, when you are discouraged, when you are no more stressed, that's when it comes so God will tell you, Gideon, it is not by the number of the people in the army. I am the one in charge. Amen. Amen. When you are completely gone, discouraged. Amen. Amen. Brother Brandham say take a woman who want to get pregnant and brother Brandham say let that woman keep getting worries. Yes sir. And being anxious to have a baby brother say draft the baby away. Yes sir. That's right. Amen. Yes sir. I have a quote my friend. Brother Bham say but what they do sometime to quieten the nerves of that woman they let her adopt a baby. Yes sir. So when she begin to adopt a baby finally unconsciously it will soak in her soul that you already have a child and when her nerve relaxes now the laws of God according to the season of a woman now begin to work and suddenly the woman is pregnant when we are pushing it don't work push back Push back my friend. Push back. Relax my friend. Remove all the stress. Yes, brother Stephven. I understand. So if I relax, what do I need to do? We will show you what you do. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we approaching you humbly this afternoon. Father, we thank you for your grace, for your love and your mercy. Father for coming down in the power of resurrection and Lord begin to unfold these things to us Lord.

What is it that every time I try it hard and somebody else is telling me different? What is it that I have missed? And we are living lives under worries under questions not understanding the providence of God. No wonder you say that your people perish for lack of knowledge. But father, you have come and unfolded these things to us. Lord, I pray that this sermon can go deeper, way deeper than he was received. So that we can realize who is in charge.
