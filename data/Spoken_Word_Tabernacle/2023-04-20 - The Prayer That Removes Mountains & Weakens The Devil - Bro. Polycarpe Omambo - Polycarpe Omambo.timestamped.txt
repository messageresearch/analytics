[43:30] a
[43:33] every place that the soul of your food
[43:35] shall tread upon that have I given unto
[43:39] you as I said unto Moses
[43:43] foreign
[43:59] [Music]
[44:01] there shall not any men be able to stand
[44:04] before thee all the days of their life
[44:07] as I was with Moses so I will be with

[44:14] thee
[44:24] [Music]
[44:27] be strong and of good courage For unto
[44:31] these people shall that divide for an
[44:33] inheritance the land which I swear unto
[44:36] their father to give them
[44:41] one more scripture in the Book of James
[44:44] [Music]
[44:47] chapter 5 verse 13.
[44:52] the scripture says
[45:01] any among you Afflicted let him pray
[45:04] is any Mary let him sing psalm
[45:08] s
[45:10] [Music]
[45:13] is

[45:26] name of the Lord

[45:40] and the prayer of faith shall save the
[45:43] sick and the Lord shall raise him up and
[45:45] if he has committed sins they shall be
[45:48] forgiven him
[45:51] may the Lord bless the uh the reading of
[45:55] his word
[46:00] I'm going to read something in the
[46:03] vision of Patmos
[46:08] page 48.
[46:13] my subject tonight is
[46:18] based on all the scripture we went
[46:20] through a
[46:28] I believe that the word my subject
[46:31] tonight is the prayer that removes
[46:33] mountain and weakens the devil okay amen
[46:38] the prayer that removes Mountains and
[46:41] weakens the devil amen amen
[46:45] he says this is
[46:50] the word that the lord gave unto the
[46:53] rubber bill
[47:02] is a prophetic
[47:06] I am standing here tonight as Zechariah
[47:09] speaking to you or speaking to the
[47:12] actual zero Babel amen amen
[47:18] it's not by your might nor by your power
[47:25] it is by my spirit safe the Lord of
[47:28] hosts
[47:30] it's not
[47:37] because of your veins
[47:40] it's not because of your beauty
[47:44] but all by the spirit of the Lord
[47:49] the fight that you have in your life
[47:52] you won't win it by your own strength
[47:56] but you will prevail by the spirit of
[47:59] the Lord
[48:00] that you will prevail
[48:03] and brother Branham says
[48:09] the angel that was speaking to Zechariah
[48:12] was saying this
[48:14] executive way you see significant in
[48:18] other words what you see here this is
[48:20] the meaning of it is
[48:33] meaning that the church cannot
[48:36] accomplish anything by its own might or
[48:39] power but by the Holy Ghost
[48:44] so just know that you are that church
[48:48] there is nothing you can do on your own
[48:52] that's what Jesus says
[48:55] without me you can do nothing
[49:00] only by me you can do something amen
[49:05] so tonight God is telling me to tell you
[49:09] is
[49:11] telling me to speak to us
[49:14] brother or sister
[49:16] or a church tonight
[49:20] it's you my brother you my sister
[49:24] God is speaking to you
[49:27] that it's not by Almighty diploma it's
[49:31] not because of your degrees
[49:33] it's not because of your height
[49:37] that you can change your own situation
[49:41] that you can cut down the mountain
[49:45] and tonight
[49:47] God spoke
[49:50] where are we ready
[49:52] in the story of Sarah
[49:55] it's God speaking
[49:58] you o great Mountain
[50:03] what are you doing in front of the
[50:05] rubber band
[50:07] apply you will be cut down amen amen
[50:14] a mountain
[50:16] what is a mountainous
[50:19] it is an elevation
[50:24] it is an elevation of the grand to a
[50:28] certain altitude
[50:39] [Music]
[51:00] and
[51:12] finally you end up having a mountain
[51:17] well we just read here
[51:24] that make notice to the mountains
[51:28] just like you my brother and sister you
[51:32] cannot really tell where the mountain is
[51:38] God who saw the mountain
[51:41] what is a mountain
[51:45] the mountain I'm talking about tonight
[51:48] is
[51:50] the image of the devil in front of you
[51:55] when a mountain is in front of you
[52:00] I am inhibited or blocked to go to the
[52:03] other side
[52:04] I cannot see on the other side
[52:22] [Applause]
[52:32] you will be made a plan amen
[53:04] why because that situation is so great
[53:07] for you
[53:15] you might probably escalate the mountain
[53:18] and go over
[53:20] there if he was a little Hill in your
[53:22] life
[53:27] probably you would already get pregnant
[53:30] and then have a baby all this time
[53:33] because it's a small mother you can go
[53:37] conquerors but when he becomes Beyond
[53:40] you there is no way you can escape
[53:43] and then you begin to get afraid
[53:46] when you begin to get fear there is
[53:50] nothing you can do in your life anymore
[53:51] amen amen
[53:54] and then in the life of the people
[53:57] we have so many mountains
[54:00] that's a natural Jesus oh they are
[54:04] man-made
[54:07] or maybe somebody brought a mountain and
[54:09] put it in front of you
[54:11] or maybe somebody push a mountain in
[54:14] front of you
[54:16] and when a mountain appear in front of
[54:18] you and
[54:23] you block your vision to see on the
[54:25] other side
[54:27] you cannot move on to the other side
[54:31] the great Mountain that is standing in
[54:33] front of you
[54:34] maybe it's a sickness a cancer
[54:40] I don't know maybe it's a female trouble
[54:43] that you have been struck
[54:45] maybe you are struggling with your feet
[54:47] amen amen Allah and then this has been a
[54:52] source of suffering in your life
[54:54] but God is speaking to you tonight
[55:00] I have been blocking your life
[55:04] because if you looking at the mountain
[55:07] if it's a great height
[55:09] you are already afraid to escalate you
[55:13] are even afraid to face it maybe it's
[55:16] your school
[55:18] maybe it's your work not moving right
[55:22] it could be your mountain tonight
[55:25] that doesn't bring joy into your life
[55:28] amen amen
[55:31] blessed be the name of the Lord
[55:35] I'm gonna talk a little bit more about
[55:38] the mountain
[55:45] we went in the Book of James 5 13.
[55:49] the Bible said
[55:53] if somebody is married
[55:56] let him sing song
[56:00] if somebody is afflicted
[56:05] let him call for The Elder of this
[56:07] church
[56:08] so they can pray for him amen amen
[56:13] why that prayer because prayer
[56:18] the prayer of the Justice are very
[56:22] effective
[56:24] prayer can change things
[56:29] no matter the situation you might be
[56:32] facing
[56:34] prayer changes it
[56:36] and you one day
[56:40] in the time of King Herod
[56:46] they were uh persecuting the church
[56:50] foreign
[56:53] and they already killed James
[56:56] amen amen
[57:01] since the people were pleased the king
[57:04] thought that he's going to move further
[57:07] so they arrested Peter
[57:10] I said
[57:13] at that point when they arrested Peter
[57:19] when they arrested James said first the
[57:23] church was still under distraction and
[57:25] they kill him because the church tonight
[57:28] is you
[57:31] the church was still under destruction
[57:34] [Music]
[57:37] but when they noticed that James was
[57:39] killed now it's the place now which the
[57:42] turn of Peter now the church rose up
[57:48] and then they went into prayer he is a
[57:51] fair
[57:52] and they begin to pray more
[57:58] you know the stories in the book of Acts
[58:01] chapter 12 verse 9
[58:10] this time the church said not Peter
[58:13] here in the party rapper be the one died
[58:18] Peter will not go away
[58:21] and they continue in prayer
[58:25] their prayer oh Faith
[58:28] their prayer opened the doors
[58:32] they broke the feathers
[58:36] that was imprisonment
[58:39] the scripture said that his father broke
[58:42] down because of their prayers
[58:45] so prayer
[58:49] has a great powers
[58:52] and tonight as we came here
[58:56] we came here to pray amen amen foreign
[59:24] Susan
[59:34] said Mama Advent
[59:37] have 17 children
[59:43] she could be cooking food for the kids
[59:46] maybe taking care of their clothing
[59:50] maybe uh saw some tone cloths
[59:55] and take care of them
[59:59] but despite having 17 children
[1:00:03] this is what brother Branham says
[1:00:06] that this lady reserves
[1:00:11] was taking at least three hours
[1:00:15] they need to be in the presence of God
[1:00:19] to be in prayer
[1:00:21] [Music]
[1:00:22] and the prayer of this woman
[1:00:26] have changed things in your life at that
[1:00:30] time
[1:00:33] and from that woman came out two big men
[1:00:37] John was slayed John Wesley the
[1:00:40] messenger a great preacher came out of
[1:00:43] it
[1:00:56] why because of the prayer of the mother
[1:00:59] amen amen
[1:01:02] this
[1:01:05] to pray for his family
[1:01:08] to pray for her children amen amen
[1:01:12] and the god that is faithful
[1:01:16] remembered her
[1:01:32] and the Bible says
[1:01:36] that the one who doesn't take care of
[1:01:38] his family
[1:01:41] he's watched them in Memphis
[1:01:44] he's worse than a hidden amen amen
[1:01:59] that are standing in front of our
[1:02:01] families
[1:02:03] we must cut them down
[1:02:10] [Music]
[1:02:13] you see the mountain must become a plane
[1:02:17] if the mountain is bigger God must take
[1:02:20] care of it and tonight
[1:02:23] we are not going to just move the
[1:02:25] mountains
[1:02:27] because if you move to Montana
[1:02:32] maybe that same Mountain will trouble
[1:02:35] somebody else
[1:02:38] and be a problem or trouble to someone
[1:02:41] else
[1:02:50] can come back in your life again
[1:02:56] to trouble your life
[1:02:58] so tonight
[1:03:00] we just now gonna move
[1:03:03] but we will carry down
[1:03:06] [Applause]
[1:03:08] in every every doorman of your life
[1:03:12] [Applause]
[1:03:24] maybe it's a
[1:03:28] lack of job
[1:03:30] maybe it's a bad business
[1:03:33] or maybe your school is not going well
[1:03:36] simultaneous all those mountains
[1:03:39] we must cut them down tonight amen amen
[1:03:43] remember yeah
[1:03:45] God promised Joshua
[1:03:48] he said nobody will stand in front of
[1:03:51] you
[1:03:52] so there should be no mountain standing
[1:03:55] in your life
[1:03:57] we're not just gonna move them
[1:04:00] and where are we ready
[1:04:02] God spoke
[1:04:04] it is not because of your muscles
[1:04:08] not because of your degree
[1:04:10] not because of your beauty
[1:04:12] not because
[1:04:16] because the Lord
[1:04:18] my spirit say the Lord
[1:04:21] you can do it by my spirit
[1:04:23] and we also tonight
[1:04:26] it is not by our knowledge
[1:04:37] but by the name of the Lord
[1:04:40] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:04:43] that's where we're gonna fight tonight
[1:04:55] he didn't go in the name of his father
[1:05:02] because of the knowledge that he had
[1:05:05] he says I come to fight you in the name
[1:05:09] of the Lord and the lord gave him the
[1:05:11] victory
[1:05:13] yourself you cannot do it
[1:05:17] but if you connect God to your problem
[1:05:20] you will you will have success
[1:05:24] tonight those mountains should be cut
[1:05:26] down
[1:05:29] Belgrade they are
[1:05:32] aggressive God will give us Grace
[1:05:34] tonight
[1:05:38] we can cut them down amen amen
[1:05:44] in the message believe in God
[1:05:47] the second day
[1:05:50] in 1952 in February the 24th brother
[1:05:54] Branham says
[1:05:56] I said in paragraph 107
[1:06:00] brother Branham says this is
[1:06:07] that is the reason
[1:06:11] the prayer of sick shall save the sick
[1:06:17] Perfection

[1:07:22] he did do it after death was pronounced
[1:07:25] to a man
[1:07:27] a man prayed yeah and God told the
[1:07:32] prophet go back and tell him
[1:07:36] I heard him yes
[1:07:43] hold on
[1:08:06] I won't read it all
[1:08:11] it's about uh King Ezekiel
[1:08:17] at that time the man got sick
[1:08:22] send the prophet Isaiah O Brother
[1:08:27] to tell him that saved the Lord

[1:08:34] give your order
[1:08:36] prepare your house
[1:08:38] prepare your family
[1:08:44] because you will die
[1:08:48] you shall not live anymore
[1:08:52] watch what the thing did is
[1:08:58] he never argue with the prophet
[1:09:01] is
[1:09:05] argue with the preacher
[1:09:10] he only heard what the man of God said
[1:09:14] and he looked at himself
[1:09:17] he said I won't waste my time talking to
[1:09:20] the preacher let me go straight to
[1:09:23] prayer
[1:09:24] and he turned his face
[1:09:27] toward the world
[1:09:29] and he begin to speak to God
[1:09:34] even if I'm sick
[1:09:36] even if I'm gonna die

[1:11:02] message
[1:11:04] he has not left the palace yet
[1:11:08] God

[1:26:22] little bit to help my voice

[1:26:48] trouble in your life take care of it

[1:27:01] confess your thoughts one to another
[1:27:04] and pray
[1:27:06] one for another amen that she may be
[1:27:11] healed
[1:27:13] the affection fervent prayer of a
[1:27:16] righteous man a valid match
[1:27:20] our righteousness God took care of it
[1:27:23] amen
[1:27:25] this is where I want you to get in verse
[1:27:27] 17.
[1:27:29] Elias or Elijah was a man subject to
[1:27:35] lack passions as we are brother Branham
[1:27:38] says that it means that Elijah has his
[1:27:41] up and down
[1:27:43] so tonight we're not calling Perfect
[1:27:46] People
[1:27:47] to pray
[1:27:49] if you were perfect you should not be
[1:27:51] even in this church you are here
[1:27:53] amen our Perfection is in Christ
[1:27:56] and the reason why I'm saying this
[1:27:58] because the scripture wants you to
[1:28:00] understand that the great Prophet Elijah
[1:28:02] that accomplished so many great things
[1:28:05] that could speak the word and Fire come
[1:28:08] down from heaven and burn the people
[1:28:10] that Prophet is not different than you
[1:28:13] that Prophet was not a perfect man the
[1:28:16] way you think
[1:28:17] that Prophet has his up and down in
[1:28:20] other words that Prophet made some
[1:28:22] mistake that Prophet could get up in the
[1:28:24] morning and get upset that Prophet could
[1:28:26] make a wrong judgment that Prophet was
[1:28:29] just like you
[1:28:30] but the problem is not to be
[1:28:33] to have the same passion like Elijah the
[1:28:36] problem is despite the state that you
[1:28:39] are in your Christian work you still can
[1:28:42] pray
[1:28:43] and God can still make things happen for
[1:28:45] you amen he said Elias was a man subject
[1:28:50] to like passion as we are and he prayed
[1:28:53] earnestly that Iman not reign
[1:28:56] so his passion his weaknesses were not a
[1:29:01] hindrance for his prayer
[1:29:04] this is not in the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:29:08] this is under the blood of bulls and
[1:29:10] goat a man with weakness could pray with
[1:29:14] forgetting his weakness and looking at
[1:29:17] the sacrifice
[1:29:18] a man of the Old Testament and things
[1:29:21] happen
[1:29:22] we don't have a sacrifice to look in
[1:29:24] Israel we are looking at the Throne of
[1:29:26] God where the Corporal body of Jesus
[1:29:29] Christ is standing there the Bible says
[1:29:32] that Elias was a man of subject to lack
[1:29:34] passion as we are
[1:29:36] and he prayed earnestly that he might
[1:29:39] not Reign and he Reign not on the Earth
[1:29:42] by a space of three years and six months
[1:29:46] so he is the one that locked the heaven
[1:29:50] before Jesus gave that power to the
[1:29:52] church
[1:29:54] because Jesus say whatever you bound I
[1:29:57] will bind by Elijah already exists I
[1:30:00] mean exercise the power in the Old
[1:30:01] Testament
[1:30:02] amen Verse 18 and he Pray Again
[1:30:07] and the heaven gave rain and the Earth
[1:30:10] brought forth her fruit so the condition
[1:30:13] or the weather of Israel was under the
[1:30:17] hand of a man
[1:30:19] who could turn the water on the way they
[1:30:21] on or just turn them off
[1:30:24] not looking at his weaknesses
[1:30:27] but looking at the blood and the
[1:30:29] sacrifice of the Old Testament everybody
[1:30:32] okay
[1:30:33] so as we are approaching God tonight
