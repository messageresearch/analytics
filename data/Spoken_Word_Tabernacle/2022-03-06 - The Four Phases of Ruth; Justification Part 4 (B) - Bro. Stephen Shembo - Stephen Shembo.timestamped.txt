[0:00] morning
[0:03] amen
[0:05] you can be seated actually yes
[0:08] god bless you saints
[0:10] uh just a quick testimony um
[0:13] you knew i was down with that terrible
[0:17] covet disease
[0:19] and
[0:20] i wasn't really sick
[0:23] as such it just
[0:24] triggered my sinuses
[0:27] and it's just my sinuses for just been
[0:29] raining draining draining making me
[0:30] cough cough cough and sometimes
[0:33] it comes so violently that i i choke and
[0:36] i get out of breath
[0:38] but then after it's gone i'm just normal
[0:41] so
[0:42] i've been battling that and i prayed and
[0:45] i
[0:46] claimed my healing
[0:48] tried to seek if there's anything i
[0:51] hadn't done
[0:52] that would hinder my prayers going up
[0:55] and you know how the enemy fights you
[0:57] but my faith has been steadfast
[1:00] listen to the messages demonology and
[1:02] all than claiming my healing
[1:05] so
[1:08] the enemy has just been pushing it
[1:10] pushing it and sometimes even when i'm
[1:13] in the middle of that prayer the cough
[1:15] comes and of course you know i have to
[1:16] stop but
[1:18] yesterday i went to work
[1:21] and i was
[1:23] i just passed by one of the patient's
[1:25] rooms
[1:26] and then later on that
[1:28] that
[1:29] patient's nurse asked me to go in there
[1:31] and help the patient
[1:33] and as i walked in
[1:35] the patient said
[1:37] oh we were just talking about you and uh
[1:40] you know because i want that because he
[1:42] wasn't my patient
[1:44] and he said
[1:45] i just told her that
[1:47] you're a christian
[1:50] i can feel the presence of the lord
[1:52] within you
[1:53] there's something different about you
[1:56] and that really encouraged me
[1:59] it really really really encouraged me i
[2:02] said thank you lord thank you lord you
[2:04] know when you when you're battling
[2:06] sometimes you pray you feel like okay
[2:07] lord what have i done
[2:09] is there something that i need to make
[2:11] right oh you know and and but you're not
[2:14] you feel like you're not breaking
[2:16] through and then
[2:18] something like that and he's he
[2:20] it just made me feel that god loves me
[2:24] so when you're discouraged
[2:27] just
[2:28] press on
[2:30] press on
[2:31] don't don't look back don't listen to
[2:34] him
[2:35] he only has a bow he doesn't have the
[2:37] arrow
[2:38] and so i know the masks have been lifted
[2:41] but they are still there in the hospital
[2:44] so that's why if you see us still
[2:46] wearing masks when we work with them we
[2:48] want to protect you
[2:50] so bear with us god bless you and i give
[2:53] glory to god
