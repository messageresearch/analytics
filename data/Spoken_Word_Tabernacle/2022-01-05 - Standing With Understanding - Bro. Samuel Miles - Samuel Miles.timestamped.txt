[23:55] revealed to us
[23:56] as brazilian singers in the service
[23:59] how could we not

[24:09] and that's that's what this song is
[24:11] about
[24:12] [Music]
[24:26] i've seen a
[24:28] vision harsh
[24:30] and sweet
[24:32] one who gave all he had
[24:36] for me
[24:39] i've seen the passion
[24:42] of
[24:43] his
[24:44] death and the forgiveness
[24:48] in his final breath
[24:52] no i could never
[24:55] be
[24:56] the same
[24:59] my heart has been
[25:02] forever
[25:04] changed

[26:19] make
[26:21] [Music]
[26:26] the cost
[26:28] next to the blood
[26:31] of cal freeze cross
[26:35] so if i live i'll live

[33:09] we spoke about the church age book and
[33:12] it's only one person that requested it
[33:15] so you all know all about the church
[33:16] ages right
[33:19] right
[33:21] so please see the deacon as soon as
[33:23] possible and give your name so we can
[33:26] order the books okay
[33:28] amen
[33:30] normally every single young man here
[33:33] young sisters especially
[33:36] because usually the brother read the
[33:38] word the system
[33:40] in the message sometimes they feel like
[33:42] no in the kitchen things like that you
[33:44] know the place of a woman in the kitchen
[33:46] [Laughter]
[33:48] amen
[33:49] amen
[33:50] so make sure everybody if you need it
[33:54] put your name not gonna pay for it i
[33:57] will be paying for it but if you get it
[33:59] make sure you read it
[34:01] there are four books
[34:04] if you get them down in this message you
[34:07] can begin to soar you want to know them
[34:10] if i tell you are you going to read them
[34:14] if you get the seven church ages
[34:18] especially the book there is a lot of
[34:20] scripture there that brother branham
[34:22] gave that can build your foundation very
[34:24] good
[34:25] and the way i want you to do it not just
[34:27] take the book and read it
[34:29] you know when you take the church age
[34:31] book make sure your bible is assad so
[34:34] when brother branham give a scripture
[34:36] stop don't move forward
[34:38] open the scripture
[34:39] i'm just giving you great keys
[34:42] amen
[34:43] if not you're going to be waiting for me
[34:44] to give you everything
[34:46] and then you're wasting your time
[34:48] amen
[34:49] you need to build your own spiritual
[34:51] life yourself you might be seated so you
[34:53] don't just stay long too amen
[34:56] so i know a lot of folks are not here
[34:58] tonight but by god's quest they will be
[35:00] following online
[35:02] so make sure when you read your church
[35:05] age book have your bible if brother
[35:07] branham says second corinthians 4 just
[35:09] stop open second corinthians 4 read it
[35:13] prayerfully
[35:15] and you will see sometimes it might take
[35:17] you an hour to read one page
[35:20] then you know you're really getting into
[35:22] it
[35:23] you cannot read it like a newspaper if
[35:25] you just read it through boom you don't
[35:28] understand what is going on this word is
[35:30] something you know how long it take me
[35:32] to read the bible
[35:34] it might take me four hours to read two
[35:36] verses
[35:37] okay
[35:39] okay
[35:40] so if you tell me you read the whole
[35:42] chapter in two minutes something is
[35:44] wrong amen it's not a newspaper so when
[35:47] i when you get your church age book put
[35:50] your bible aside read it slowly even if
[35:53] you don't understand that's fine that's
[35:55] where the question comes amen
[35:58] i was talking to uh
[36:01] to a young man and i told him i said the
[36:03] way
[36:05] we were trained and the way we ask
[36:07] question
[36:08] in the message because we have a session
[36:10] of question and answer we were reading
[36:13] the word
[36:15] everybody got it and then we read the
[36:17] message
[36:18] then we come up with questions from the
[36:20] message
[36:22] and from the word
[36:23] that's how you're going to grow
[36:25] not going on the internet and reading
[36:27] everything on the internet and pulling
[36:30] questions from the internet
[36:32] or somebody says this there is a
[36:33] historian that says this
[36:35] those are not stuff you need to put your
[36:37] hair there put your head in the word
[36:39] read the bible and come with a bible
[36:41] question read the message or listen to
[36:43] the message then you come up with a
[36:45] question from the message those are the
[36:47] questions that will make the inner man
[36:49] grow
[36:50] not reading everything in the message
[36:52] you go read about the history of india
[36:54] the history of this then you come up
[36:56] with a question i have a question that
[36:58] says this no no that's not the correct
[37:00] way read the bible read the message
[37:02] brother branham say put your head in the
[37:04] word amen
[37:06] so we need the church book that's the
[37:09] first book the second one is the seals
[37:13] amen the third one is adoption

[37:19] amen but there is a book where they
[37:21] combine all those sermons together

[46:52] apologize for what happened sandy just
[46:54] come see me i got a quote for you
[46:58] i got a quote for you
[47:02] brother brown was preaching one time and
[47:03] he started to apologize for keeping the
[47:05] congregation too long and he said no no
[47:07] no i'm not gonna do it
[47:09] i got that quote you want it just see me
[47:15] oh it was delicious
[47:18] so so the the other night

[47:23] listen to some of that tape i said yeah
[47:25] we'll sit down we'll listen about a half
[47:27] hour
[47:28] you know and then we'll maybe listen
[47:29] more the next night
[47:31] we listened all three hours
[47:35] it was so yummy we couldn't quit
[47:39] so we just appreciate you brother
[47:41] brother shambo uh he's got a real gift
[47:46] and uh you know my pastor back home ron
[47:49] walbert a very uh dedicated sincere man
[47:52] of god
[47:54] and he told me
[47:56] thank you
[47:58] better have too much water than not
[47:59] enough
[48:01] and brother abel where you at
[48:04] this one's clean on the outside
[48:11] amen
[48:14] and uh anyways my pastor told me he said
[48:18] he said a good teacher
[48:20] will take complicated
[48:22] topics
[48:23] and make them simple
[48:26] if you sit down you listen to a teacher
[48:28] for an hour and a half and you go and
[48:30] say boy that guy's got a lot of
[48:31] knowledge
[48:32] he didn't help you
[48:35] but when he takes things like
[48:38] what was the numbers 26 exodus 26
[48:41] and he tells you when you read it you're
[48:43] not going to understand it but read it
[48:44] anyways
[48:45] that's because he's going to break it
[48:46] down
[48:47] and make it so it is understandable
[48:50] so if we just do our part
[48:53] and then he does his part
[48:55] and the holy spirit will do his part
[48:59] and we'll be saying i'm so glad
[49:02] i'm a part
[49:04] of the family
[49:06] of god
[49:08] i've been
[49:09] washed in the fountain
[49:13] cleansed by his blood
[49:16] [Music]
[49:18] join heirs with jesus
[49:21] as we not when we get over there
[49:25] join heirs with jesus
[49:28] as we travel this side
[49:32] i'm so glad
[49:34] i'm a part of
[49:36] the family
[49:39] uh are you glad
[49:41] [Applause]
[49:43] if you're glad let's sing it together
[49:45] i'm so glad
[49:48] i'm a part
[49:51] of the family
[49:54] of
[49:54] god
[49:56] i've been washed
[49:59] in this fountain
[50:02] cleansed by
[50:05] his blood
[50:07] joint heirs with jesus
[50:12] as we travel
[50:15] this side
[50:17] for i'm part
[50:20] of the family
[50:23] the
[50:24] family of
[50:27] god
[50:29] amen
[50:33] we don't have visitors
[50:35] just family
[50:37] members
[50:39] and i have a couple family members that
[50:41] i believe
[50:42] are listening in
[50:44] my son and his wife kathy are listening
[50:48] in tonight
[50:49] and so i certainly do appreciate that
[50:52] and i hope they got a notebook open
[50:54] and if they have any questions they
[50:56] write down the questions
[50:58] and then we'll take them back into the
[50:59] bible and we'll make it simple for them
[51:02] see the gospel is not difficult
[51:06] and the gospel is good news
[51:09] and the gospel has come to set us free
[51:12] so if you're all bound up in your
[51:14] religious beliefs you don't have the
[51:16] gospel
[51:18] and we just want to keep the gospel so
[51:20] simple and so plain
[51:22] and so full of honey
[51:24] you see the thing of it is people want
[51:26] to give a lot of honey but they don't
[51:28] want to put it in the right place
[51:30] see the shepherd when they would get the
[51:32] honey they would put the honey on the
[51:34] limestone
[51:36] okay because in the limestone there's
[51:39] minerals so that when your belly's not
[51:41] feeling good if the if the shepherd puts
[51:43] the honey on the limestone they lick the
[51:46] honey but they're getting the limestone
[51:50] and that's what's settling their
[51:51] stomachs and that's what makes the word
[51:54] of god digestible and that's what makes
[51:56] you want to come back for more and for
[51:59] more and for more and i'm just trying to
[52:03] share with you friends that if you don't
[52:05] have a burden in your heart to be in
[52:08] church every time those doors are open
[52:11] get back to the altar quickly
[52:15] we are living in the last of the last
[52:18] times
[52:19] [Music]
[52:20] and remember from from the little uh
[52:22] exhortation we gave the other night that
[52:25] the that the seventh that the first
[52:27] church age messenger paul
[52:29] exhorted us the seventh church age that
[52:32] as we see that day approaching that we
[52:35] assemble ourselves all the more and
[52:39] and not to stay out now if you if you
[52:41] can't get to church on wednesday night
[52:43] and you gotta stream that's okay i
[52:46] believe the holy spirit can visit you
[52:47] where you're at because he's a discerner
[52:49] of the thoughts and the intents of the
[52:51] heart
[52:51] but i want to tell you something if
[52:53] you're staying home when you could be
[52:54] here what you're doing is you're getting
[52:56] a cold shower instead of getting a warm
[52:59] shower
[53:07] i just like smiles you all got beautiful
[53:09] smiles you know that
[53:11] hey man
[53:13] isn't god good to us
[53:15] and so i'm glad to have billy and kathy
[53:17] aboard with us tonight and i trust the
[53:19] lord will uh share something that will
[53:22] be uh edifying to them if you could turn
[53:24] with me to the book of
[53:26] ephesians and keep in mind that the book
[53:29] of ephesians
[53:30] brother brown taught us is a parallel to
[53:33] the book of joshua
[53:35] and the book of joshua we know it wasn't
[53:38] the great heavens but it was the it was
[53:41] the traveling through the promised land
[53:44] and we're traveling through a promised
[53:46] land how many of us have been promised
[53:49] the gift of the holy ghost
[53:53] let me ask again let me see a show of
[53:55] hands how many of us
[53:57] have been promised the gift of the holy
[54:00] ghost
[54:01] all right so you've repented of your
[54:03] sins and you've been baptized in the
[54:05] name of jesus christ and you received a
[54:07] promise that you would receive
[54:10] the holy ghost now the holy ghost is the
[54:14] literal life of jesus christ just just
[54:18] keep that in your thoughts and what i
[54:20] want to do is just read this scripture
[54:22] so that we can get started and you can
[54:24] be seated all right verse 10
[54:27] finally my brethren
[54:29] be strong in the lord verse i say
[54:32] ephesians 6 verse 10. i apologize
[54:35] okay everybody's page is turning and
[54:38] we're good all right
[54:41] and uh finally my brethren be strong in
[54:44] the lord
[54:45] be strong in the lord and in the power
[54:48] of his might
[54:50] put on the whole
[54:53] armor of god
[54:55] that you may be able to stand
[54:57] against the wiles of the devil
[55:02] for we're not wrestling against flesh
[55:04] and blood
[55:05] but against principalities
[55:08] against powers
[55:10] against the rulers of darkness of this
[55:13] world
[55:14] against spiritual wickedness in high
[55:17] places
[55:18] you remember john said the high places
[55:21] be mid low and the low place would be
[55:22] made high he said as those pharisees
[55:25] that was coming there to the baptism and
[55:27] he said you go and bring forth fruit
[55:28] meat to repentance
[55:30] these high places are are our liars that
[55:34] are in the pulpit who say they're
[55:36] apostles but you've tried them and found
[55:38] out that they're not
[55:39] but what we want is the truth the whole
[55:41] truth and nothing but the truth
[55:44] okay here we go
[55:46] high places wherefore take unto you the
[55:49] whole armour god that you may be able to
[55:52] withstand in the evil day
[55:56] amen remember
[55:58] satan is the god of this evil age and we
[56:01] are living right now in satan's eden
[56:04] satan's eden is being manifested here on
[56:07] the flesh and as satan came in and
[56:10] defiled god's uh child in the garden of
[56:14] eden now god is coming into satan's eden
[56:17] he's getting into our moral flesh he's
[56:19] perfecting our spirit his spirit his
[56:23] spirit now listen to that it's his
[56:25] spirit being perfected in us while we
[56:28] are in our mortal bodies in satan's eden
[56:36] all right now we're painting a picture
[56:38] because you got to have a vision if
[56:40] we're going to make a stand then we've
[56:42] got to have a vision of what we're
[56:43] standing for
[56:45] amen so here we go we know where we're
[56:47] at we know what we're doing and we and
[56:50] we know
[56:51] we know the uh the the tricks of the
[56:53] devil
[56:54] all right and we have the the devil's
[56:57] answer he said stand therefore having
[56:59] your loins gird about with truth
[57:01] having on the breastplate of
[57:02] righteousness and your
[57:04] feet shod with the preparation of the
[57:07] gospel of peace
[57:08] above all take the shield of faith
[57:10] whereby you're able to quench the fiery
[57:13] darts of the wicked and take the helmet
[57:15] of salvation and the sword of the spirit
[57:18] which is the word of god
[57:21] and probably this is the most important
[57:24] part saints and that is to be praying
[57:27] always
[57:28] praying always
[57:31] your personal communication with god
[57:35] cannot be over emphasized
[57:38] paul said it like this he said pray
[57:40] without ceasing when you're washing the
[57:42] dishes be in prayer
[57:44] when you're driving down the road in
[57:46] your car
[57:47] be in prayer
[57:49] when you're when you're doing your job
[57:51] whatever you're doing do it prayerfully
[57:53] do everything you do
[57:55] not and with lip service as unto men but
[57:58] as you're serving god to everything
[58:02] motivated by that same intensity that
[58:05] you want to serve god in everything that
[58:08] you do no matter what it is
[58:11] and we can take time with that but let's
[58:13] move on
[58:14] prayer prayer pray praying always
[58:17] in all prayer
[58:19] with and supplication in the spirit and
[58:22] watching with all perseverance and
[58:25] supplication for all the saints

[58:35] quickly to romans chapter 12.

[58:43] we'll read this and let you be seated
[58:55] all right now
[58:57] he said i beseech you therefore brethren
[59:01] by the mercies of god that you present
[59:05] your bodies
[59:07] a living
[59:08] sacrifice
[59:10] holy
[59:11] acceptable
[59:13] unto god
[59:14] which is your reasonable service and be
[59:18] not conformed to this world
[59:22] but be transformed
[59:25] by the renewing of your mind
[59:28] that you might prove what is the good
[59:31] and acceptable and the perfect will of
[59:35] god
[59:36] lord add a blessing to the reason of his
[59:38] word and may he help us now as we
[59:42] look to him to help us to understand
[59:45] what he would have us to know tonight in
[59:47] jesus name you can be seated
[59:51] now i want to take a
[59:53] text tonight standing
[59:55] with understanding
[59:57] standing
[59:58] but we have to know what we're standing
[1:00:00] about
[1:00:02] we have to know why we're standing how
[1:00:05] we're standing what the consequences of
[1:00:08] uh uh uh uh of it is for us to make a
[1:00:11] stand
[1:00:15] you didn't join just a little boy scout
[1:00:17] troop when you came to be a christian
[1:00:20] this is god's army
[1:00:23] we can already look back into the
[1:00:25] scriptures and we see at one time god
[1:00:28] chose to deliver jane deliver james unto
[1:00:32] death and then the very next uh
[1:00:34] scripture in the bible when herod saw
[1:00:36] that it pleased the jews he takes peter
[1:00:39] he puts him into jail and
[1:00:41] and god sends an angel into the jail
[1:00:43] cell to deliver peter
[1:00:45] we are soldiers in the army of god
[1:00:49] there's told a story and i heard it long
[1:00:51] ago don't even know where i heard it but
[1:00:53] it rings true in my heart and it was
[1:00:55] about a a a kingdom it was a small
[1:00:59] kingdom it was in the medieval times and
[1:01:01] they were up on us on a side of a cliff
[1:01:04] in a in in like a uh a bay of an ocean
[1:01:08] and so the only way that you could get
[1:01:09] to this city was to come at it by a boat
[1:01:12] and it was just a small kingdom
[1:01:14] just a small kingdom and they lived
[1:01:16] peaceably amongst themselves and there
[1:01:18] was a an army that was coming through
[1:01:21] that area brother stephen and they were
[1:01:23] just destroying everything in the way
[1:01:25] like a bunch of locusts they was just
[1:01:27] looking up everything along the way
[1:01:29] and so
[1:01:30] they come to this little kingdom they
[1:01:32] saw that kingdom on top of the hill and
[1:01:33] they said you know what that's an easy
[1:01:35] little thing for us to go up there and
[1:01:37] take and so they sent uh emissaries up
[1:01:40] to talk to that king and they said now
[1:01:42] look
[1:01:43] you're just a small kingdom and we've
[1:01:45] already taken out this empire and we've
[1:01:47] taken out that empire and we've done
[1:01:48] this and done that so we're going to
[1:01:50] give you a chance you can just surrender
[1:01:53] you can just surrender and then nobody
[1:01:56] will get hurt
[1:01:57] and the king thought he said well
[1:01:59] he says i understand that he said but he
[1:02:01] said and that's that's a nice nice view
[1:02:04] to do that for us he said but before you
[1:02:06] leave
[1:02:08] before you leave i just want you to
[1:02:10] witness one thing for me
[1:02:12] and they said okay and so he brought his
[1:02:14] army in a ray and they're all there with
[1:02:16] their swords up and their
[1:02:19] spears and their shields
[1:02:21] and uh and they're all just straighten
[1:02:23] attention whenever the king would say
[1:02:25] something they would do exactly what the
[1:02:27] king said if he said march they marched
[1:02:29] if he said stan they stand and then he
[1:02:31] turned around to one
[1:02:33] soldier
[1:02:35] and he said you
[1:02:37] sir yes sir and he come running i was in
[1:02:39] the army
[1:02:41] i'm sure he didn't say sir yes sir
[1:02:43] but that's the way it comes to me
[1:02:46] sir yes sir
[1:02:47] and so you're coming
[1:02:48] yes here i am i'm a soldier he said now
[1:02:51] i want you to run off that hill and give
[1:02:54] your life for this kingdom
[1:02:56] and without even batting an eye
[1:02:59] that man saluted the king and off he
[1:03:02] went and he jumped off the ledge and now
[1:03:04] he said to the emissaries that came he
[1:03:06] said now you go tell your leaders
[1:03:10] we're not going we're not going to
[1:03:13] surrender
[1:03:14] and if you decide that you want to try
[1:03:16] to come up these hills and take us
[1:03:19] every one of these men will do the same
[1:03:21] thing that that man just did
[1:03:24] so they seen them go down the hills and
[1:03:26] they got into their boats and they went
[1:03:29] back and you know what they saw they
[1:03:31] looked over the bay and those ships
[1:03:33] turned around and they just sailed out
[1:03:35] another way
[1:03:37] the dedication of one man
[1:03:40] saved the entire nation
[1:03:42] and friends that's the intensity that we
[1:03:45] have we're in this fight for the lord
[1:03:48] you remember what the lord shared with
[1:03:50] us the other day just one person getting
[1:03:53] out of cater if you sit in church
[1:03:55] half-hearted and you're not paying
[1:03:57] attention
[1:03:58] and you're not getting into the spirit
[1:04:00] then you're not going to understand
[1:04:01] what's going on brother branham said if
[1:04:03] you get into a symphony you have to get
[1:04:06] into the spirit of the symphony or
[1:04:08] you're not going to be able to
[1:04:09] understand the symphony and remember
[1:04:11] what we're talking about tonight we're
[1:04:13] talking about taking a stand for jesus
[1:04:16] but we're trying to take it with an
[1:04:18] understanding and we evaluate the cost
[1:04:22] and we don't want to enter into a battle
[1:04:24] with anybody without were willing to pay
[1:04:27] the price whatever the price is our
[1:04:30] brothers and our sisters went on before
[1:04:32] us and they loved not their lives unto
[1:04:36] death
[1:04:40] now being a christian takes a commitment
[1:04:44] amen
[1:04:48] it takes a commitment
[1:04:52] and
[1:04:52] and jesus said this he said he said
[1:04:56] love the lord your god
[1:04:59] with all your mind
[1:05:01] with all your heart
[1:05:03] and with all your soul
[1:05:06] what else is left
[1:05:08] let's do it again
[1:05:10] all your mind
[1:05:12] all your heart
[1:05:14] all your soul
[1:05:17] you don't want to be conformed to this
[1:05:18] world
[1:05:19] you want to be
[1:05:20] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:05:24] [Music]
[1:05:28] paul said with my mind i serve the law
[1:05:31] of god
[1:05:32] with my flesh the law of sin who will
[1:05:35] deliver me from the body of this death i
[1:05:37] said he said thank god through jesus
[1:05:40] christ my lord
[1:05:43] and because that he made that dedicated
[1:05:46] decision he could go on to write there
[1:05:48] is therefore now no condemnation that's
[1:05:51] a judgment there's no judgment to those
[1:05:54] who are in christ jesus who don't walk
[1:05:57] after the flesh but they walk after the
[1:05:59] spirit now if you get over into
[1:06:02] romans chapter 12 and you look at this
[1:06:05] word for transformed do you know that
[1:06:08] word is only used one other time in the
[1:06:10] new testament that greek word for
[1:06:12] transformed is the same word that was
[1:06:15] used in matthew 17 when jesus christ
[1:06:18] went up to the mount of transfiguration
[1:06:20] and it was transfigured before peter
[1:06:23] james and john and that's what we're
[1:06:26] coming to saints now see this this this
[1:06:29] taking a stand number one we have to
[1:06:32] take it individually
[1:06:34] each individual has got to be completely
[1:06:38] surrendered and totally dedicated and i
[1:06:42] don't want to be dedicated just to to
[1:06:44] some
[1:06:45] uh
[1:06:46] uh some some personality cult
[1:06:48] i am dedicated to one thing and that is
[1:06:52] to the manifestation of jesus christ in
[1:06:56] this flesh right here
[1:06:59] i am not going to be satisfied until
[1:07:01] when i look into the mirror of the word
[1:07:04] every aspect of it without a without a
[1:07:07] jot without without a blemish without a
[1:07:10] wrinkle without a spot it has to be
[1:07:12] perfectly jesus christ made manifest and
[1:07:17] when that spirit is made manifest what
[1:07:20] he does is he takes you and he sets you
[1:07:22] apart up on mount transfiguration and
[1:07:26] that's the adoption and then friends let
[1:07:29] me tell you something when you become
[1:07:31] adopted into the kingdom you're not only
[1:07:34] heirs but joint heirs do you remember
[1:07:37] what a hazardous told esther when she
[1:07:40] she came in and he reached out the
[1:07:41] golden scepter
[1:07:43] he said i'll give you up to the half of
[1:07:45] the kingdom now that didn't mean she was
[1:07:47] going to own the eastern half and he was
[1:07:49] going to own the western half that meant
[1:07:51] everything that she said in the kingdom
[1:07:53] was just as good as if a hazardous said
[1:07:56] it in the kingdom and when you become to
[1:07:58] so dedicated to the lord jesus christ i
[1:08:02] mean dedicated which one of your wives
[1:08:04] wants your husband to be 99 dedicated to
[1:08:07] you
[1:08:10] put your hand up
[1:08:12] 99 you 199.
[1:08:15] you agree with 99.
[1:08:17] all right let me repeat the question
[1:08:22] all right you didn't hear the question
[1:08:25] there's a lot of grace in this house so
[1:08:27] don't worry
[1:08:29] i don't know how many times i sat back
[1:08:31] there and gave the wrong answer
[1:08:33] let me ask theresa teresa
[1:08:35] would you be happy if your husband was
[1:08:37] dedicated to you 99 percent of the time
[1:08:41] no
[1:08:44] and you know i wouldn't be happy if she
[1:08:45] was dedicated to me 99 of the time
[1:08:48] it's a total
[1:08:51] look friends
[1:08:52] we've got to get our eyes
[1:08:54] off of the world
[1:08:59] [Music]
[1:09:02] can i say it like this
[1:09:04] let me say it like this
[1:09:06] let me say it like this i want to make
[1:09:08] this very simple
[1:09:10] get your face
[1:09:12] in the book
[1:09:16] and when you have your face in the book
[1:09:19] you don't have time for that other thing
[1:09:22] [Music]
[1:09:24] well praise the lord
[1:09:26] that was free of charge
[1:09:30] so we're see
[1:09:32] here's the thing that satan does is he
[1:09:34] gets us so tied up and worrying about
[1:09:37] what is not truth
[1:09:39] we don't study what is true
[1:09:42] that's why the pastor is sitting here
[1:09:44] telling you read your bible read the
[1:09:48] messages
[1:09:51] [Music]
[1:09:55] do you know when they send these people
[1:09:58] to school
[1:09:59] to study counterfeit money they don't
[1:10:02] show them any counterfeit money
[1:10:05] they don't show them any counterfeit
[1:10:06] money
[1:10:07] they study the real money
[1:10:11] they study the real money
[1:10:14] so much if there's just a little
[1:10:16] deviation to it they say that's
[1:10:17] counterfeit
[1:10:24] get your eyes off the antichrist
[1:10:27] and they're gonna help you to know
[1:10:28] what's wrong with his ministry and
[1:10:30] what's wrong with that ministry i want
[1:10:32] to know what is right with what i
[1:10:34] believe
[1:10:35] [Applause]
[1:10:38] i'm taking a stand for jesus and i'm
[1:10:41] letting the world go by
[1:10:45] [Music]
[1:10:54] brother robert i read about a man one
[1:10:56] time that loved charlie chapman
[1:10:59] he loved charlie chapman
[1:11:01] brother abel he studied charlie chapman
[1:11:03] so much
[1:11:04] that the way charlie chapman walked
[1:11:07] he walked
[1:11:09] and the way charlie chapman talked he
[1:11:12] talked
[1:11:13] and the way charlie chapman dressed he
[1:11:15] dressed
[1:11:17] that's what religious people do
[1:11:20] that's what religious people do
[1:11:23] that's what religious people do
[1:11:25] they study the bible they know how to
[1:11:28] say the right things they know how to be
[1:11:30] in the right places
[1:11:31] at the right times
[1:11:35] and he said that he so perfected the
[1:11:38] life of charlie chapman the way that he
[1:11:40] walked in the way that he talked and he
[1:11:41] combed his hair the same way and he
[1:11:43] brushed his teeth the same way
[1:11:45] that was free of charge
[1:11:52] that the people who knew charlie chapman
[1:11:55] if they was to put charlie chapman here
[1:11:58] and this man right here they couldn't
[1:12:00] tell you which one was which
[1:12:03] yes
[1:12:06] but
[1:12:09] see
[1:12:11] the two spirits
[1:12:14] will be so close
[1:12:19] it would deceive the very elect if it's
[1:12:22] possible
[1:12:24] but we've got a blood test
[1:12:32] if they take the blood out of charlie
[1:12:33] chapman and they take the blood out of
[1:12:35] this man it's going to say wrong dna
[1:12:42] if they take the blood out of a baptist
[1:12:45] and they take it out of christ it's
[1:12:47] going to come up wrong a dna
[1:12:51] if they take the blood out of a message
[1:12:53] believer and they take the blood out of
[1:12:56] jesus christ it's going to come up wrong
[1:12:58] dna
[1:13:01] there's people that fell in love with
[1:13:02] the prophet and they so imitated the
[1:13:04] prophet that they could walk around with
[1:13:06] a eagle bub buckle and they could keep a
[1:13:09] bible up underneath their hands
[1:13:17] they'll listen to the tapes
[1:13:20] but my bible tells me brother stephen
[1:13:23] that you cannot
[1:13:25] add to
[1:13:26] or take away
[1:13:28] one word from the book
[1:13:30] if you add to the book the plagues that
[1:13:33] are in the book will be added unto you
[1:13:35] brother greg and if you take away from
[1:13:37] the book then your name will be taken
[1:13:39] out of the book of life
[1:13:41] so what are they going to do when they
[1:13:43] say we believe malachi 4 5 and 6 but we
[1:13:46] don't need pastors and we don't need
[1:13:48] teachers and we don't need evangelists
[1:13:50] and all you've got to do is get to a
[1:13:51] tape recorder and hit play
[1:13:55] they're leaving the scripture unkept
[1:13:58] and it's got to be every word
[1:14:04] don't you leave nothing out of there
[1:14:07] it's all got to be fulfilled jesus said
[1:14:09] i didn't come to destroy the law and the
[1:14:10] prophets he came to fulfill the law
[1:14:14] and the prophets he said heavens and
[1:14:16] earth would pass away but my word would
[1:14:19] never pass away
[1:14:23] and so i asked teresa one time
[1:14:25] about my friend here with charlie
[1:14:27] chapman
[1:14:29] i said what would it be if charlie
[1:14:31] chapman
[1:14:32] was in trouble
[1:14:34] and somebody was trying to find him so
[1:14:36] that they could shoot him
[1:14:37] do you think this guy's going to stand
[1:14:39] around looking like charlie chapman
[1:14:43] he's gonna go change his clothes
[1:14:44] he's gonna comb his hair different
[1:14:47] but when you have the literal
[1:14:50] life
[1:14:51] of jesus christ
[1:14:53] living inside of you
[1:14:55] then the works that he did shall you do
[1:14:58] also
[1:14:59] and when it comes to time to taking a
[1:15:01] stand you'll be like daniel they said
[1:15:04] now look at daniel
[1:15:06] if you keep on praying the way you're
[1:15:08] praying we're going to put you into the
[1:15:10] lion's den
[1:15:13] didn't shake daniel
[1:15:16] do you know what daniel did
[1:15:18] come time to pray
[1:15:21] out in the public
[1:15:23] and so the little tattletails came down
[1:15:25] it up
[1:15:26] took him drug him down before the cat oh
[1:15:28] daniel what are you doing this for
[1:15:32] they put him into the lion's den
[1:15:34] daniel didn't flinch
[1:15:36] daniel didn't flinch do you realize that
[1:15:39] he understood the consequences of taking
[1:15:42] a stand and he chose to take the stand
[1:15:47] now friends this is what i want to come
[1:15:50] across crystal clear tonight
[1:15:54] you cannot resolve in your mind peter
[1:15:57] tried to do it brother stephen
[1:16:00] he said if they kill you
[1:16:02] they'll kill me first
[1:16:04] and jesus turned around and looked at
[1:16:06] him he said before the crows you'll
[1:16:08] deny me three times
[1:16:12] oh not me no no no not me but what
[1:16:14] happened brother stephen
[1:16:16] the crew and how many times did
[1:16:18] peter deny the christ
[1:16:20] oh my but that predestinated
[1:16:23] seed
[1:16:24] that was in peter and when he came up on
[1:16:28] the resurrection and he told mary she
[1:16:30] said go tell my disciples
[1:16:36] and peter
[1:16:38] he wanted to make sure peter knew even
[1:16:41] though he made mistakes he was still
[1:16:44] included in the grace of god
[1:16:47] so don't ever give up if you've got a
[1:16:49] hunger if you've got a thirst if you've
[1:16:52] got a just a craving in your heart that
[1:16:54] you want to be like jesus christ i don't
[1:16:56] care if you fall 100 times tomorrow you
[1:16:59] get up 101 time and you keep pressing on
[1:17:03] paul said
[1:17:04] uh
[1:17:05] uh
[1:17:05] uh forgetting forgetting the things that
[1:17:08] are behind he said i press on to the
[1:17:12] mark of the high calling and the high
[1:17:15] calling is the literal life of jesus
[1:17:18] christ come back into the believers
[1:17:22] brother branham said it like this and
[1:17:24] christ is the mystery of god revealed he
[1:17:26] said it's not a life that you live
[1:17:34] he said it's not a life that you live
[1:17:37] he said it's a life that comes in you
[1:17:42] and lives himself out through you
[1:17:47] so just get it settled in your heart
[1:17:49] you're going to dedicate yourself to the

[1:18:07] our god is an awesome god
[1:18:10] so we have as individuals we dedicate
[1:18:14] ourselves to god
[1:18:16] but friend god is not coming for
[1:18:19] individuals he's coming for a body
[1:18:22] a body thou has prepared for me
[1:18:25] and that's why why uh uh the the uh and
[1:18:29] let's go to ephesians chapter four
[1:18:32] and let's see how god is doing this
[1:18:35] ephesians chapter four
[1:18:38] amen god is good
[1:18:56] with supplication for all the saints
[1:19:00] when our when our body when our when our
[1:19:02] brothers and our sisters have a problem
[1:19:04] we have a problem
[1:19:05] let's just read this for a minute now
[1:19:06] ephesians chapter 4 he says i therefore
[1:19:09] paul
[1:19:10] i therefore the prisoner of the lord
[1:19:12] beseech you that you walk worthy
[1:19:15] of the vocation wherewith you are called
[1:19:19] that word vocation is the calling the
[1:19:22] calling many are called but few are
[1:19:24] chosen but your calling you make your
[1:19:27] calling and your election sure and how
[1:19:31] do you make your calling and election
[1:19:34] sure by examining your life with every
[1:19:38] word that's in the bible and not being
[1:19:41] satisfied until every ounce of your
[1:19:44] attitude
[1:19:46] every every aspect of your character and
[1:19:49] your conduct is in perfect alignment
[1:19:51] with him
[1:19:55] that's exactly right
[1:19:58] we pray like this at the home uh when
[1:20:00] when we pray in the morning we say lord
[1:20:02] jesus you come into our house you're
[1:20:04] welcome in our house you walk down the
[1:20:07] corridors of our conduct and into the
[1:20:10] chambers of our attitudes and if you see
[1:20:12] anything in my conduct or in my attitude
[1:20:16] that's not pleasing to you and remember
[1:20:19] what he said peter said that a meek and
[1:20:22] a quiet spirit was of great price in the
[1:20:26] sight of the lord
[1:20:27] christian people are not people who are
[1:20:31] constantly trying to have their own way
[1:20:34] they'll always let look at abraham
[1:20:36] abraham said to lot he said if you go to
[1:20:38] the right i'll go to the left if you go
[1:20:41] to the left i'll go to the right always
[1:20:44] prefer your brother and if you don't
[1:20:46] have a spirit that's always preferring
[1:20:48] your brother don't condemn yourself just
[1:20:51] come come back to jesus christ and say
[1:20:53] lord i don't think i'm quite lined up in
[1:20:56] that aspect
[1:20:58] and i need you thine is the kingdom
[1:21:00] thine is the power thine is the glory i
[1:21:04] want his kingdom inside of me we know
[1:21:06] his kingdom is joy peace and
[1:21:08] righteousness and the holy ghost and i
[1:21:11] should have a skip in my step and a
[1:21:13] smile on my face through every aspect of
[1:21:16] my life when the wind is blowing in my
[1:21:18] direction i should be happy when the
[1:21:21] wind is blowing against me i should be
[1:21:23] happy when things are going my way i'm
[1:21:26] happy when things aren't going my way
[1:21:28] i'm happy and when things are going
[1:21:30] crazy all around you and you don't
[1:21:32] understand just
[1:21:34] stand
[1:21:36] paul said when you've done all that you
[1:21:38] can do to stand
[1:21:40] just stand
[1:21:42] have your loins gird about with truth
[1:21:44] now
[1:21:45] your feet shot with the preparation of
[1:21:47] the gospel of peace have on the
[1:21:49] breastplate of righteousness and the
[1:21:51] helmet of salvation
[1:21:54] did you catch that children of
[1:21:55] melchizedek
[1:21:56] the breastplate of what
[1:21:59] your feet shot with what
[1:22:02] preparation of the gospel of peace
[1:22:08] your kings you're priests
[1:22:11] you're chosen of god
[1:22:13] we found out that we had another whole
[1:22:15] generation we belong to
[1:22:17] we don't even have to look to our mommy
[1:22:18] and our daddy anymore
[1:22:20] we don't have any beginning of days or
[1:22:22] ending of life
[1:22:24] oh my
[1:22:26] oh my
[1:22:27] god
[1:22:32] well if that don't make you happy i
[1:22:33] don't know what else to do for you
[1:22:36] with all lowliness and meekness with
[1:22:38] long-suffering forbearing one another
[1:22:42] and look what paul's doing he says
[1:22:44] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[1:22:48] spirit remember the church was perfected
[1:22:51] on the day of pentecost they were in one
[1:22:53] mind one heart and one accord but we
[1:22:57] found out from the teaching on sunday
[1:22:59] that when jesus went up
[1:23:01] judas went down and when jesus came back
[1:23:04] down jews came back up amen and we saw
[1:23:08] him manifested you know you can see
[1:23:10] judas manifested almost immediately
[1:23:12] because when peter and john go down
[1:23:14] through the gate called beautiful and he
[1:23:17] they tell the lame man so silver and
[1:23:18] gold have i none but such as i have in
[1:23:20] the name of jesus christ judas's buddies
[1:23:24] the one that he gave the silver to so
[1:23:27] that he could uh betray jesus christ
[1:23:30] they're there to condemn peter and john
[1:23:32] for doing what for preaching in the name
[1:23:35] of jesus christ
[1:23:36] and told him don't you preach in that
[1:23:38] name
[1:23:39] oh and then he worms his way in further
[1:23:42] i can't wait to hear the rest of that
[1:23:43] story
[1:23:44] we'll leave that to the teacher
[1:23:47] amen but there's a whole lot more to
[1:23:49] that now look endeavoring to keep the
[1:23:51] unity of the spirit
[1:23:54] now
[1:23:56] if we're going to keep the unity of the
[1:23:57] spirit
[1:23:58] that means you have to have the spirit
[1:24:02] read that it's not a small s
[1:24:05] it's capital s
[1:24:07] capital s
[1:24:08] you have to have the spirit you have to
[1:24:10] have the spirit and we're all in the
[1:24:13] same spirit
[1:24:15] we all will have the mind of jesus
[1:24:18] christ
[1:24:19] what's the pastor been telling us let
[1:24:21] the mind that was in christ jesus be
[1:24:24] also in you
[1:24:28] who being in the form of god
[1:24:31] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:24:33] god
[1:24:37] you say brother sam
[1:24:38] i can think myself equal with god
[1:24:41] if i said it it wouldn't be worth
[1:24:43] anything
[1:24:44] but jesus is one that said
[1:24:47] that in that day and that day is this
[1:24:49] day
[1:24:50] that i will be in the father the father
[1:24:53] will be in in me i will be in you and
[1:24:56] you will be in me
[1:24:58] and it was john who said greater is he
[1:25:01] who is in you than he that is in the
[1:25:04] world not greater is he that will be in
[1:25:06] you greater is he that is in you
[1:25:10] and did you ever notice that when jesus
[1:25:13] when when the disciples are talking
[1:25:15] about peter but about jesus it's always
[1:25:18] in the present tense
[1:25:20] look at john in first john chapter 3 he
[1:25:23] said now
[1:25:25] are you the sons of god
[1:25:28] it does not yet appear what you shall be
[1:25:30] but we know that when he shall appear
[1:25:33] that we shall be like him for we will
[1:25:35] see him as he is now if you want to see
[1:25:39] you the way you are then what you do is
[1:25:41] you go and you look into a mirror and if
[1:25:43] you want to see him the way he is then
[1:25:45] you want to look into the mirror of the
[1:25:47] word my little granddaughter came up to
[1:25:49] me the last time i was up there in
[1:25:51] maryland and she said unto me she says
[1:25:53] well poppy she says
[1:25:56] my sister does this and that and the
[1:25:58] other and my brother does this that and
[1:26:00] the other and she says i'm the only one
[1:26:02] to turn down all right
[1:26:07] i said well lisa honey that's awful nice
[1:26:12] i said but you're not supposed to
[1:26:13] compare yourself against your brother
[1:26:15] or against your sister i said you're
[1:26:17] supposed to compare yourself against
[1:26:19] jesus
[1:26:20] i said how you doing now
[1:26:23] oh poppy
[1:26:24] [Laughter]
[1:26:30] there's none of us righteous
[1:26:32] no not one
[1:26:33] we all must die romans 7 paul brings it
[1:26:36] out so beautifully in romans 7 9 brother
[1:26:39] brahm said not just not just put aside
[1:26:42] to the occasion hang it up in a closet
[1:26:45] that nature that you were born with
[1:26:49] must die
[1:26:52] just like that brazen serpent that hung
[1:26:55] up on the on the pole it was dead and it
[1:26:59] was our sins was judged that's why it
[1:27:02] was brass remember the brazen labor is
[1:27:05] in the outer court where the judgments
[1:27:07] take place
[1:27:08] and and we have got to judge ourselves
[1:27:12] dead
[1:27:13] and anything about that nature that we
[1:27:15] was born with the personality whatever
[1:27:18] it is it has to die
[1:27:21] and we must come into the unity of the
[1:27:24] faith and we must come into the bond of
[1:27:28] peace and the unity of the spirit
[1:27:30] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[1:27:31] spirit for there's only one body
[1:27:34] one body
[1:27:35] it's many members but by one spirit
[1:27:38] we're all baptized into
[1:27:44] now what is that spirit
[1:27:47] we say it's god
[1:27:49] but what is god
[1:27:53] perfect
[1:27:54] love
[1:27:56] perfect
[1:27:58] love
[1:28:00] amen
[1:28:01] perfect love can you imagine jesus
[1:28:04] the lord of all
[1:28:09] and he allowed a man to spit
[1:28:11] in his face
[1:28:14] and while as the spittle
[1:28:16] is dropping down off of his face
[1:28:20] there was no bitterness in his eyes
[1:28:25] brother
[1:28:26] jumbo he had dove's eyes
[1:28:28] he had gentle eyes he had eyes of peace
[1:28:32] he was he pitied that man
[1:28:35] he wept over jerusalem
[1:28:41] now friends we're talking about the
[1:28:43] literal life
[1:28:47] is everybody awake
[1:28:49] anybody not awake
[1:28:52] kick your neighbor see if they're awake
[1:28:57] amen
[1:29:01] when the angel comes
[1:29:03] with the ink horn writer
[1:29:07] who's he putting a mark on
[1:29:12] don't you see jesus
[1:29:15] weeping
[1:29:16] over jerusalem
[1:29:18] how oft would i have hovered you
[1:29:21] as a hand doth her brood but you would
[1:29:25] not
[1:29:26] and just think of the people that you've
[1:29:27] gone to witness to and you've gone to
[1:29:30] pray with and they've come to you with
[1:29:31] prayer requests and you took time on
[1:29:33] your knees praying for them and then
[1:29:35] they go right back into their same old
[1:29:38] habits and their same old ways
[1:29:41] and yet that burden is still in your
[1:29:43] heart
[1:29:44] brother branham said it was christ in
[1:29:46] moses that stood in the gap for the
[1:29:49] people when they rebelled it was christ
[1:29:53] in moses that did that
[1:29:55] brother branham always thought how can
[1:29:57] moses
[1:29:58] be able to tell god a better way
[1:30:02] there's only one body
[1:30:04] one lord one faith
[1:30:07] one god
[1:30:09] and father of us all who's above all
[1:30:11] through all and in you
[1:30:15] see individually
[1:30:18] individually we are dedicated we are
[1:30:21] consecrated
[1:30:22] that word dedicated is the same word
[1:30:24] that they used to name enoch
[1:30:27] he was dedicated to god and enoch had a
[1:30:30] testimony that he walked with god and he
[1:30:34] and he pleased god and therefore god
[1:30:37] took him
[1:30:39] and the bride will have a testimony that
[1:30:41] they walked with the word
[1:30:46] in the message how shall i overcome
[1:30:47] brother branham prayed this prayer
[1:30:50] he said lord i believe it's towards the
[1:30:52] end of the message
[1:30:53] he said lord i believe
[1:30:56] he said i believe lord
[1:30:58] i believe
[1:30:59] that you
[1:31:00] are my overcomer
[1:31:04] he said and let me walk with you
[1:31:08] that where you are
[1:31:11] there i want to be
[1:31:14] we want to be with him listen friends
[1:31:16] eternity is not going to start when you
[1:31:19] die
[1:31:21] we're in eternity now
[1:31:24] we're in eternity now time is just a
[1:31:27] part of eternity it's just a little
[1:31:29] segment of eternity
[1:31:32] your mortal life has a beginning your
[1:31:34] mortal life will have an end but we have
[1:31:37] a body eternal in the heavens that's not
[1:31:40] made with hands and when you die you go
[1:31:43] to that body
[1:31:47] but what are you going to take with you
[1:31:49] when you leave here
[1:31:51] that's all you're going to take
[1:31:54] is the character that you gained and how
[1:31:56] do you get character
[1:32:00] characters is not a gift brother branham
[1:32:02] said that character is a victory and it
[1:32:05] comes through the everyday struggling
[1:32:08] with uh your the trials that god in his
[1:32:12] wisdom allows to come to pass
[1:32:16] they asked brother branham said does god
[1:32:18] love you yes he does how do you know
[1:32:20] because he said so and how can i show my
[1:32:23] love to him by conducting myself with
[1:32:26] joy amidst the trials that he in his
[1:32:29] wisdom come to pass when you understand
[1:32:32] that your trials your heartaches your
[1:32:35] sorrows are the things that are
[1:32:37] identifying you with the literal life of
[1:32:40] jesus christ then you will understand
[1:32:42] why jesus said
[1:32:44] when when men revile you and persecute
[1:32:47] you and say all manner of evil against
[1:32:49] you falsely for my sake that you should
[1:32:52] rejoice
[1:32:54] and he didn't just say rejoice he said
[1:32:57] be exceedingly glad
[1:32:59] why because so persecuted they the
[1:33:02] prophets that were before you he said if
[1:33:04] they hated me they're going to hate you
[1:33:07] he said that
[1:33:08] that that offenses must come he said but
[1:33:11] woe unto them from whom the offense has
[1:33:13] come he said it's better for them that
[1:33:16] they were that a millstone was tied
[1:33:18] about their neck and they were cast into
[1:33:20] the undersea
[1:33:25] you know what james said about it he
[1:33:27] said counted all joy
[1:33:30] do you know what peter said about it
[1:33:34] he thanked god for the fiery trials that
[1:33:38] was to try him
[1:33:41] he said that the the trying of his faith
[1:33:46] was more precious
[1:33:49] now you got to get the the structure of
[1:33:51] the sentence there he didn't say his
[1:33:53] faith
[1:33:54] was more precious
[1:33:56] he said that the trying of his faith was
[1:33:59] more precious because friend if your
[1:34:02] faith is like muscles and if you don't
[1:34:04] exercise your muscles they'll atrophy
[1:34:07] and they'll go down to nothing but when
[1:34:09] you go through trial and trial and trial
[1:34:13] and your faith is exercised and you take
[1:34:15] a stand and you stand tall when the wind
[1:34:17] is blowing what happens you might be
[1:34:20] getting tossed back and forth up here
[1:34:22] but your roots is growing deeper and the
[1:34:24] dirt's getting looser and you know what
[1:34:26] the fruit's getting sweeter and now you
[1:34:28] can tolerate that brother that you
[1:34:30] couldn't tolerate before and now that
[1:34:32] person that used to annoy you they don't
[1:34:34] annoy you anymore
[1:34:38] amen
[1:34:40] let's see if we can get down here to
[1:34:41] where we're going
[1:34:43] but unto every one of us has given grace
[1:34:45] according to the measure of the gift of
[1:34:47] jesus christ we're unto
[1:34:49] when he ascended up on high he led
[1:34:52] captivity captive
[1:34:54] and gave gifts unto men
[1:34:58] now
[1:34:59] let's just keep on down to verse 11
[1:35:01] because the gifts that he gave was some
[1:35:04] apostles some prophets some evangelists
[1:35:07] some pastors and some teachers and those
[1:35:10] gifts are here for a purpose
[1:35:13] they're here for the perfecting
[1:35:16] of the saints
[1:35:19] for the work
[1:35:20] of the ministry
[1:35:22] for the edifying of the body
[1:35:25] until we all come in the unity of the
[1:35:29] faith and of the knowledge of the son of
[1:35:32] god
[1:35:33] unto a perfect man
[1:35:35] unto the measure of the stature of the
[1:35:46] amen
[1:35:48] paul said it like this to the ephesians
[1:35:50] i think it's in chapter three
[1:35:52] he said that you might be filled
[1:35:55] with all
[1:35:57] the fullness
[1:35:58] of god
[1:36:05] i read that brother shambo and just my
[1:36:07] head goes
[1:36:08] [Music]
[1:36:11] you see
[1:36:12] now that doesn't mean i'm all god
[1:36:15] but that means everything that is in me
[1:36:17] is god
[1:36:19] amen you go out to the ocean and you get
[1:36:22] a little a bucket and you dip it down in
[1:36:24] the ocean and you pull that bucket out
[1:36:27] and you set it over here it's not all of
[1:36:29] the ocean
[1:36:31] but everything that is is 100
[1:36:37] pure
[1:36:38] ocean
[1:36:41] and it's even clean on the outside
[1:36:44] we can possess our vessels in
[1:36:48] sanctification saints
[1:36:50] you can do it satan will come along and
[1:36:52] lie to you and say you can't do it but
[1:36:54] i'm here to tell you in laodicea in
[1:36:58] satan's eden with all the filth that's
[1:37:02] out in the world right now and
[1:37:04] everywhere you turn you can't even walk
[1:37:06] through the grocery store without seeing
[1:37:09] some picture of some woman that
[1:37:11] shouldn't even be in a bar room and
[1:37:14] there it is staring you right in your
[1:37:15] face
[1:37:17] but
[1:37:19] rich in his mercy
[1:37:21] has given us the holy spirit to equip us
[1:37:25] with the ability
[1:37:26] to turn our heads when we see those
[1:37:28] things and you know i came to the place
[1:37:31] one time i was walking through i think
[1:37:32] it was walmart and you look over there
[1:37:34] and you oh my goodness you look over
[1:37:35] there one and you know what i did i said
[1:37:37] well i said noah had to look up
[1:37:40] [Music]
[1:37:41] i said in order for noah to see out the
[1:37:43] window he had to look up because the
[1:37:45] window was in the top of the ark so i
[1:37:48] just went through walmart just looking
[1:37:50] up they might have thought i was a
[1:37:51] little bit crazy but you know what i
[1:37:54] didn't have to filter out all that
[1:37:55] garbage that was coming into my eyeballs
[1:38:01] it's hard to get a jug of milk while
[1:38:03] you're doing that though
[1:38:06] isn't god good
[1:38:08] i'm telling you saying
[1:38:10] we're striving
[1:38:12] to allow perfect love
[1:38:14] to be perfected in us
[1:38:17] and and and when and and i and and i had
[1:38:19] a brother come to me one time and he was
[1:38:21] telling me about how his wife was just
[1:38:23] being so hard on him and no matter what
[1:38:26] he did she was never happy and so he
[1:38:28] would just go on and on and on and on
[1:38:30] and on and i said
[1:38:31] stop just one minute i got to ask you a
[1:38:34] question before you go any further
[1:38:37] i said do you want the spirit of jesus
[1:38:39] christ in you
[1:38:40] he said yes yes i do
[1:38:42] i said well let me ask you a question
[1:38:43] brother
[1:38:44] i said if you're never confronted with
[1:38:46] perfect hate
[1:38:48] how are you going to know
[1:38:50] you have perfect love
[1:38:53] if somebody doesn't despise you with
[1:38:55] their guts
[1:38:57] and you from your heart you love him
[1:39:00] and you pray for him
[1:39:02] and there was a sister back home and by
[1:39:04] home i mean up in southern pennsylvania
[1:39:06] when i was conducting a little bible
[1:39:08] study and this lady come to my bible
[1:39:10] study and she had this testimony
[1:39:12] remember theresa she gave us his
[1:39:14] testimony there in the bible study and
[1:39:16] she was a cook and she worked in a in a
[1:39:19] little like a little um what do they
[1:39:21] call that like a um
[1:39:23] like a little like a little diner like a
[1:39:24] little diner and she was a cook in the
[1:39:26] diner and in that diner there was a
[1:39:29] little waitress and she was a christian
[1:39:32] and that little christian she would come
[1:39:33] in and she was oh happy go lucky and
[1:39:36] praise the lord and thank you jesus and
[1:39:38] every time somebody would do something
[1:39:40] wrong to her she just prayed for him and
[1:39:41] just went on never ever ever ever ever
[1:39:45] had a bad day
[1:39:48] where was she living at brother stephen
[1:39:51] she wasn't in the outer court
[1:39:53] she wasn't in the inner court
[1:40:00] she was behind that veil
[1:40:03] and when you're behind the veil you're
[1:40:04] not even dependent on whether the sun's
[1:40:06] shining or the clouds are out you know
[1:40:09] you're living in the presence of the
[1:40:11] shekinah glory and you're happy all the
[1:40:14] time
[1:40:15] and so she would all the time no matter
[1:40:17] what that lady did she would always have
[1:40:19] a blessing back at her and she'd say
[1:40:21] something sweet to her and she that's
[1:40:23] this lady she said oh she said every
[1:40:25] time i would and when she was nice to me
[1:40:27] she said now this is the lady that was
[1:40:29] coming to my bible study and she's given
[1:40:31] this testimony and said every time she
[1:40:33] said something nice to me i tried to
[1:40:34] think of something meaner and more
[1:40:35] wicked to say back at her i just wanted
[1:40:38] to get her goat i wanted to find her
[1:40:39] goat and she found out she didn't have a
[1:40:41] goat
[1:40:47] and so one day it was her birthday this
[1:40:50] cook the one that was always agitated
[1:40:54] friends
[1:40:55] this is what god has called his children
[1:40:57] to be
[1:40:59] brother branham said live for the person
[1:41:04] who would kill you if you could
[1:41:08] think about stephen
[1:41:11] think about stephen
[1:41:14] he lives so close to god that when god
[1:41:18] needed to get a hold of saul's attention
[1:41:20] he used stephen
[1:41:22] and stephen stood there and there was
[1:41:24] throwing stones at stephen why were they
[1:41:26] throwing stones at stephen did anybody
[1:41:28] know
[1:41:29] they were throwing stones at stephen
[1:41:31] because stephen tried to have a bible
[1:41:33] study and teach him about jesus and he
[1:41:35] kind of rubbed them the wrong way
[1:41:38] he said you stiff-necked
[1:41:40] uncircumcised in heart near
[1:41:43] that's the worst thing you ever want to
[1:41:45] call a jew
[1:41:46] you don't want to call a jew stiff neck
[1:41:48] you don't want to cause you
[1:41:49] uncircumcised i mean that's the nest and
[1:41:52] they're coming right out of state but it
[1:41:53] was the truth
[1:41:55] it was the truth and it wasn't him that
[1:41:56] was speaking it was the holy spirit that
[1:41:58] was just coming out and telling the
[1:42:00] truth and you know people don't want to
[1:42:02] hear the truth but he said you
[1:42:03] stiff-necked and uncircumcised and heart
[1:42:06] and yours he said you do always resist
[1:42:08] the holy spirit as your fathers did so
[1:42:11] do you
[1:42:13] and that just got their goat because
[1:42:15] they had a goat to give
[1:42:17] and they picked him up and they carried
[1:42:18] him out of the uh in the street and they
[1:42:21] started throwing stones at him and what
[1:42:23] did what did steven do
[1:42:26] see it was the same it was the literal
[1:42:29] do you see it sister
[1:42:31] it was the literal life of jesus christ
[1:42:33] was in stephen
[1:42:35] and so when they hung jesus on the cross
[1:42:37] what did he do he prayed for him father
[1:42:40] forgive them and so what's steven doing
[1:42:42] with the stone still coming at him
[1:42:45] hitting him in the head
[1:42:47] and he's falling to his knees he cries
[1:42:50] out
[1:42:51] they knocked this into their charge
[1:42:54] they don't know what they're doing you
[1:42:56] see
[1:42:57] now friends that's when you know you've
[1:43:00] got the goods
[1:43:02] when the heat comes you're not going to
[1:43:04] turn and run you're not going to try to
[1:43:07] change your clothes cut your hair off
[1:43:09] start looking more like the world
[1:43:11] because you don't want to be identified
[1:43:13] as one of them no you are proud of the
[1:43:16] uniform that god has given you and you
[1:43:19] wear it proudly and let me tell you
[1:43:21] something satan doesn't like it when
[1:43:23] you're happy and that's why he's always
[1:43:25] trying to wipe the smiles off of your
[1:43:26] face but if you go through the
[1:43:28] beatitudes it almost doesn't make sense
[1:43:31] because the word for blessed i'm going
[1:43:33] to get back to my story in a minute i'm
[1:43:35] going to get back to her i won't leave
[1:43:36] you hanging on her i still got her we're
[1:43:38] going to get back there but you know
[1:43:40] what the word blessed means
[1:43:43] happy
[1:43:45] it means happy
[1:43:48] and it says happy are you when you mourn
[1:43:56] can i use one of brother stephen's
[1:43:57] sayings
[1:43:58] am i reading a different bible than you
[1:44:00] are
[1:44:12] we're talking about overcomers here
[1:44:14] saints
[1:44:15] we're talking about people that walk
[1:44:18] with jesus
[1:44:20] not just when they're coming to church
[1:44:24] but every day
[1:44:26] every thought
[1:44:43] we're dedicated saints
[1:44:46] we are consecrated we want to know did
[1:44:49] you ever did let me get back to my
[1:44:51] sister friend here and so anyways so so
[1:44:53] it was this lady's birthday
[1:44:55] it was this lady's birthday and so in
[1:44:57] comes this uh this christian sister the
[1:45:00] the uh the christian and she has a
[1:45:04] birthday cake
[1:45:05] a birthday cake a nice birthday cake she
[1:45:08] baked her a nice birthday cake and she
[1:45:11] bought her a bunch of balloons and said
[1:45:12] happy birthday and god bless you and all
[1:45:14] those things on the balloons and so she
[1:45:17] comes in and she's singing her song and
[1:45:19] must jesus bear the cross alone and all
[1:45:22] the world go free no there's a cross for
[1:45:24] everyone and there's a cross for me and
[1:45:27] she takes that cake and she pushes it up
[1:45:29] into the window and then she shoves the
[1:45:32] balloons back up in there and she says
[1:45:34] happy birthday
[1:45:39] brother stephen the lady told me this
[1:45:42] she said that so affected me
[1:45:45] she said i took my apron off
[1:45:47] and i laid it down
[1:45:48] and i came out around
[1:45:51] around into where she was at
[1:45:53] and she said to that woman she said she
[1:45:56] said gretchen she said i don't know what
[1:45:58] you got
[1:45:59] she said but i want it
[1:46:06] i don't know what you got
[1:46:08] that day i don't know what you got
[1:46:10] but i want i don't know what you got but
[1:46:12] i want it and i liked your song
[1:46:14] that was a beautiful song how many
[1:46:16] enjoyed her song
[1:46:18] oh that was a beautiful song
[1:46:20] will you sing it again for us
[1:46:23] all right there you go
[1:46:25] that was a beautiful song
[1:46:27] i i took pictures i went on i went on
[1:46:30] when we were watching bro i took
[1:46:31] pictures on my phone so i could read the
[1:46:33] lyrics it was a beautiful song
[1:46:36] who wrote that song do you know
[1:46:40] huh
[1:46:41] you don't know it's not important it was
[1:46:43] a beautiful song
[1:46:44] it really was
[1:46:46] but that's what it's all about
[1:46:51] god didn't give us the holy ghost
[1:46:54] just so we could go around say we're
[1:46:55] christians
[1:46:58] we are here to continue his work
[1:47:02] you read the church age book and brother
[1:47:05] branham said that the last church will
[1:47:07] be a continuation of the book of acts
[1:47:10] let's see if i can find that i got that
[1:47:11] quote here
[1:47:12] and i want to just read that for you and
[1:47:14] then then we'll wind her down
[1:47:17] oh my goodness isn't it good to be in
[1:47:19] the presence of god amen
[1:47:29] he says now remember
[1:47:31] this
[1:47:32] christ in the true church
[1:47:35] is a continuation of the book of acts
[1:47:39] but the book of acts shows how the
[1:47:42] antichrist spirit would come into the
[1:47:44] church
[1:47:45] and make it uh defile it making it
[1:47:48] lukewarm
[1:47:49] formal and powerless it exposes satan
[1:47:54] revealing his work and the attempted
[1:47:56] destruction of god's people and the
[1:47:58] discrediting of god's word right down to
[1:48:01] the time that he's cast into the lake of
[1:48:04] fire he cannot stand it he knows that if
[1:48:07] the people get the true revelation of
[1:48:09] the true church and what she is and that
[1:48:13] she and what she stands for
[1:48:17] see we're taking a stand
[1:48:20] for
[1:48:20] jesus
[1:48:22] we're letting the world go by and when
[1:48:24] we take a stand for him we're standing
[1:48:27] with the understanding we've counted the
[1:48:29] cost and it may cause some of us to have
[1:48:32] to
[1:48:33] give our lives even that much for for
[1:48:36] the cause of christ
[1:48:37] but when the persecution comes we're not
[1:48:40] going to be like the man
[1:48:42] my friend charlie chapman had and when
[1:48:44] the persecution came against charlie he
[1:48:46] wants to go change his clothes no you
[1:48:49] sisters you don't know how bright that
[1:48:51] you shine in this land to see in church
[1:48:54] age oh i'm telling you something there's
[1:48:56] a you're going to be a beautiful branch
[1:48:58] when you get out of here you go into a
[1:49:00] into a walmart and you're dressed in
[1:49:03] holiness you stick out everybody knows
[1:49:06] there's something different about you
[1:49:08] and don't ever let satan make you
[1:49:10] ashamed of that you wear that proudly
[1:49:13] and brothers you wear your smile proudly
[1:49:16] and you wear your joy proudly and it
[1:49:18] can't be anything that'll ever take it
[1:49:21] away from us
[1:49:22] paul said neither heightened or depth
[1:49:24] nor all the rest of that
[1:49:26] i used to could say that brother stephen
[1:49:30] but watch this now
[1:49:32] she will be an invincible army
[1:49:34] if they get the revelation of the two
[1:49:38] spirits
[1:49:40] and it's important that we recognize
[1:49:42] where these two spirits are
[1:49:45] they're within the framework of the
[1:49:48] christian church
[1:49:50] and so how did the pastor tell us uh to
[1:49:53] tell
[1:49:54] what spirit you have
[1:49:56] if it's something
[1:49:58] if if you're wearing uh
[1:50:01] your dresses
[1:50:03] because you have to
[1:50:05] it's the wrong spirit
[1:50:06] if you're wearing dresses because you
[1:50:08] want to you got the right spirit
[1:50:11] if you live for jesus because you want
[1:50:13] to you if you just come to church
[1:50:15] because you're afraid somebody's going
[1:50:16] to say something about you because you
[1:50:17] didn't go to church then you don't have
[1:50:18] the right spirit
[1:50:20] but when you love god
[1:50:22] and you want to be in his presence and
[1:50:24] you want to be around his saints
[1:50:27] now you're now you're getting close to
[1:50:28] the kingdom of heaven
[1:50:30] the two spirits and by god's spirit they
[1:50:33] discern and withstand
[1:50:35] the antichrist spirit now when you're
[1:50:38] using god's spirit to discern and
[1:50:40] withstand the antichrist spirit that's
[1:50:42] when you're taking a love
[1:50:44] and you're returning love
[1:50:46] for a blessing for a curse when you're
[1:50:50] returning love for hate when you're
[1:50:52] returning a uh
[1:50:54] peace for war
[1:50:57] you you just use you employ
[1:51:00] you employ
[1:51:02] god's spirit and everything you do
[1:51:05] and if you've got a marriage that's
[1:51:07] upside down don't go in there with the
[1:51:09] word of god and say oh wifey or wifey
[1:51:12] listen here you'll do what i'm telling
[1:51:14] you to do because the bible said a
[1:51:15] husband a wife should obey her husband
[1:51:22] well why don't you just live a life
[1:51:25] so full of christ
[1:51:28] that she'll know it's not you but it's
[1:51:30] christ in you
[1:51:32] and she'll want to be with you and
[1:51:35] she'll want to do what you want her to
[1:51:37] do
[1:51:38] see
[1:51:40] don't you see it brothers
[1:51:42] it's it's employing the jesus christ
[1:51:44] this spirit that he gave us is just not
[1:51:47] to make us look pretty and set us on a
[1:51:49] pedestal it's to go into action is to go
[1:51:52] into war and if i die
[1:51:55] i die ruth
[1:51:57] if i die i die
[1:51:59] mordecai have all the people fast me and
[1:52:02] my maids will fast and then i'll present
[1:52:05] myself to the king and if i perish
[1:52:08] i perish
[1:52:10] oh you hebrew children they had to fire
[1:52:13] seven times hotter well they might have
[1:52:15] had the fire seven times hotter that's
[1:52:17] okay i'm living in the land to see in
[1:52:19] church age and yeah it gets pretty hot
[1:52:22] around here but my bible said i was
[1:52:24] rather you would be hot or be cold but i
[1:52:27] ain't gonna be lukewarm that's right i'm
[1:52:30] either going to be on fire for god or i
[1:52:31] don't want none of god
[1:52:38] well can your god deliver yes our god
[1:52:40] can deliver us
[1:52:42] but i'm going to tell you this
[1:52:44] whether he delivers us brother mickey
[1:52:47] or he doesn't deliver us we're still not
[1:52:50] going to bow to your image
[1:52:53] we're still not going to bow to your
[1:52:54] image friend that is taking a stand for
[1:52:58] god
[1:52:59] with an understanding and you make that
[1:53:02] determination that you're going to stand
[1:53:04] for god long before the trial ever hits
[1:53:07] you
[1:53:08] [Music]
[1:53:13] remember what the bible said be strong
[1:53:15] in the lord
[1:53:17] don't wait till the trial gets here and
[1:53:19] then try to get strong
[1:53:21] it's your everyday walking
[1:53:24] living presenting yourself a living
[1:53:27] sacrifice
[1:53:28] holy without blame acceptable before him
[1:53:33] in love
[1:53:34] and friends
[1:53:36] that's not even going out of your way
[1:53:38] that's just your reasonable service
[1:53:42] and now look at this
[1:53:43] and the reason that we're going to do
[1:53:45] that
[1:53:45] the the ministry is here the apostles
[1:53:48] prophets pastors teachers and
[1:53:49] evangelists trying to get down to this
[1:53:51] now for the perfecting of the saints for
[1:53:53] the work of the ministry for the
[1:53:55] edifying of the body
[1:53:56] of christ
[1:53:58] until we all come the unity of the faith
[1:54:00] the knowledge of the son of man unto a
[1:54:02] perfect man under the
[1:54:03] that we be no more
[1:54:06] children tossed to and fro
[1:54:10] and carried about
[1:54:11] with every wind of doctrine by the
[1:54:14] slight of men
[1:54:16] and the cunning craftiness whereby they
[1:54:18] lie in wait to deceive
[1:54:22] but speaking the truth in love
[1:54:27] may grow up
[1:54:28] into him
[1:54:30] in all things which is the head
[1:54:33] even
[1:54:35] christ
[1:54:36] now in malachi 4
[1:54:38] it said that when the spirit arises with
[1:54:41] healing in his wings when the son of
[1:54:43] righteousness arises with healing and
[1:54:45] wings it said that they will grow up as
[1:54:48] calves
[1:54:50] of a stall
[1:54:52] do you know what a calf of a stall does
[1:54:55] they put him in a stall
[1:54:57] and they feed him corn and they feed him
[1:54:59] corn and they feed him corn and they
[1:55:02] feed him corn
[1:55:03] and so you get into your closet and you
[1:55:05] eat the word and you eat the word and
[1:55:08] you eat the word and you eat the word
[1:55:10] and as you eat the word you become the
[1:55:13] word
[1:55:15] is that right
[1:55:16] and he said that they're going to grow
[1:55:17] up as casual stall i'm telling you this
[1:55:20] predestinated seed is going to be so
[1:55:22] hungering and so thirsting for god
[1:55:25] you'll see them walking through walmart
[1:55:27] with the new testament open and was
[1:55:29] there was they're going to get the milk
[1:55:31] we just want that word
[1:55:34] it's it's an insatiable hunger and what
[1:55:37] did jesus say blessed are you when you
[1:55:40] hunger
[1:55:42] and you thirst
[1:55:43] friend if you've got busy time that
[1:55:45] you're spending with some love novel
[1:55:48] just just get closer to the altar
[1:55:51] until god so burns that hunger in you i
[1:55:54] i can read the book of ephesians 25
[1:55:57] times a day and it wouldn't be enough
[1:56:00] you know that manna that was beyond the
[1:56:02] veil it never spoiled
[1:56:04] i can listen to the to the the future
[1:56:08] home of the earthly bride in the
[1:56:09] heavenly bridegroom i could listen to
[1:56:11] that four times in a day and i wouldn't
[1:56:13] get bored with it and every time i
[1:56:15] listen to the same message i get more
[1:56:18] out of it
[1:56:21] it doesn't spoil
[1:56:28] but speaking the truth and love may we
[1:56:29] grow up in him and all things which is
[1:56:32] the head even christ from whom
[1:56:36] from whom
[1:56:37] you see what it says
[1:56:39] where are we coming from we're coming
[1:56:40] from christ he is the head
[1:56:43] and what is the head remember the
[1:56:45] pyramid brother brandon had up there the
[1:56:47] head is divine love
[1:56:49] that's the capstone that's our source of
[1:56:52] strength everything about us is divine
[1:56:56] love there's no bitterness in divine
[1:56:58] love if you want to know what divine
[1:56:59] love is just go to first corinthians 13.
[1:57:02] love is patient love is kind love is and
[1:57:05] and if you understand all the mysteries
[1:57:07] and you have faith to move mountains and
[1:57:09] you give your body to be burned and you
[1:57:10] don't have divine love it's nothing
[1:57:13] it's nothing without divine love brother
[1:57:15] branham said when he went beyond the
[1:57:16] curtain of time and he saw all those
[1:57:18] people that went on before him and and
[1:57:20] and thousands and thousands have come

[1:57:38] way paul preached it

[1:58:17] compacted by
[1:58:19] which
[1:58:20] every joint supplier
[1:58:24] let me give you an example what he's
[1:58:26] talking about here
[1:58:27] let me just show you a little example
[1:58:29] here
[1:58:32] there we go so we're building
[1:58:36] a brick house
[1:58:38] and we're going to put a brick right
[1:58:39] there
[1:58:41] okay and so now
[1:58:43] we got that one in there we're going to
[1:58:45] put one right here
[1:58:47] now this is two bricks brick one
[1:58:51] brick two let's give a couple more
[1:58:53] bricks here
[1:58:54] so we can get our house going
[1:58:57] how about five we'll have five bricks
[1:58:59] here
[1:59:00] three four
[1:59:03] five that's grace yes this is a brick
[1:59:06] this is a brick
[1:59:08] this is a brick
[1:59:09] this is a brick
[1:59:11] this is a brick
[1:59:13] this
[1:59:14] is a joint this
[1:59:17] is a joint
[1:59:18] this is a joint
[1:59:21] and this is a joint
[1:59:25] now where they're going to put the next
[1:59:26] layer of bricks
[1:59:29] they're going to go right over top of
[1:59:30] that joint right
[1:59:32] right
[1:59:33] yes
[1:59:35] every
[1:59:36] joint
[1:59:37] is supporting the other joints see this
[1:59:40] one is supporting this brick that's
[1:59:42] supporting this bread and then we put
[1:59:44] another brick there
[1:59:46] that every joint and don't you realize
[1:59:49] how important if you are a predestinated
[1:59:53] seed of god we need you
[1:59:56] to move up into the position
[2:00:00] that god
[2:00:02] has supplied for you to fill let me tell
[2:00:05] you something
[2:00:06] this brick cannot do this brick's job
[2:00:11] and this brick cannot do this bricks job
[2:00:16] this brick has got to come to adoption
[2:00:18] this brick has got to come to adoption
[2:00:21] this brick has got to come to adoption
[2:00:23] you've got to come to adoption you've
[2:00:25] got to come to adoption you've got to
[2:00:28] come
[2:00:29] too you've got to come to adoption and
[2:00:32] the adoption my friend is the placing of
[2:00:35] the person into the body of jesus christ
[2:00:38] brother branham said that the adoption
[2:00:40] was the placing of sons and don't you
[2:00:43] know that if this joint is weak then the
[2:00:47] whole building is going to be weak
[2:00:51] you see
[2:00:53] so your personal
[2:00:55] everyday
[2:00:56] dedication to jesus christ
[2:00:59] could determine the quality of the
[2:01:02] service that we have this coming sunday
[2:01:11] he said your misbehavior
[2:01:14] and unconfessed sins
[2:01:17] can keep your brother
[2:01:20] from getting his healing
[2:01:23] that's not all he said
[2:01:25] you know what he said
[2:01:27] and he said and you'll be responsible
[2:01:29] for every bit of it on the day of
[2:01:31] judgment
[2:01:33] that's right
[2:01:34] so that's what it means friends we are
[2:01:37] building
[2:01:38] the building
[2:01:40] of the lord and we need every
[2:01:44] person to be into it with all their
[2:01:48] heart
[2:01:49] all their mind
[2:01:50] and all their soul if you're old enough
[2:01:52] to understand what brother stephen is is
[2:01:56] teaching then don't give it just
[2:01:59] casual hearing
[2:02:02] sit here
[2:02:03] prepare yourself before you come to
[2:02:06] church
[2:02:07] get some sleep the night before
[2:02:10] don't be laying around in the service
[2:02:12] and gone
[2:02:26] we have to understand how important
[2:02:28] every one of us and this is what paul
[2:02:31] was telling us let's see if you're
[2:02:32] reading the same thing i'm reading
[2:02:34] from whom that's from christ the body
[2:02:38] fitly joined together and compacted and
[2:02:41] we found out that word compact album was
[2:02:44] the same word that he used for knitted
[2:02:46] over in colossians chapter 2 and he said
[2:02:48] that we were knitted together with what
[2:02:51] love
[2:02:53] so we're coming from jesus which is love
[2:02:56] we're knitted together by love which is
[2:02:59] the bond of perfectness and when we have
[2:03:01] a revelation of who we are
[2:03:04] and that we can do the greater works
[2:03:07] then we
[2:03:09] each one
[2:03:10] totally dedicated to the body of jesus
[2:03:14] christ together
[2:03:16] we become
[2:03:19] thank you
[2:03:22] amen
[2:03:25] and then we'll wait on the lord and will
[2:03:28] renew our strength
[2:03:30] and we'll mount up with the wings of an
[2:03:33] eagle
[2:03:34] we'll run
[2:03:35] and not be weary
[2:03:37] we'll walk
[2:03:39] and not pain
[2:03:40] teach me lord teach me lord to weigh in
[2:03:45] every joint supply
[2:03:48] according to the effectual working in
[2:03:51] the measure of every part
[2:03:54] making an increase
[2:03:57] of the body
[2:03:58] unto the edifying that word edifying
[2:04:01] means the building up
[2:04:03] and say nice things to people
[2:04:06] if you see somebody doing something
[2:04:08] wrong don't go around point out the
[2:04:09] wrongs they're doing find out something
[2:04:11] that they're doing right and just
[2:04:12] emphasize that oh sister you got a
[2:04:14] beautiful smile
[2:04:16] don't go tell her all the you pray about
[2:04:19] the things that you see wrong
[2:04:22] in your closet say lord i saw sister
[2:04:25] so-and-so and she was down at walmart
[2:04:27] and
[2:04:28] you know she wasn't quite dressed the
[2:04:30] way that a christian ought to be so
[2:04:32] would you help her lord
[2:04:34] would you help her in your closet you
[2:04:36] pray for
[2:04:37] some of you mothers and the sweetness of
[2:04:39] the spirit put your arm around her and
[2:04:41] go talk to her like she's your daughter
[2:04:44] put some feeling into it
[2:04:46] sister don't you realize that you're
[2:04:49] affecting the whole body of jesus christ
[2:04:52] see and the and brother branham said
[2:04:55] that the new
[2:04:56] birth was a personal revelation of jesus
[2:05:00] christ to you
[2:05:02] individually but then collectively
[2:05:05] all of us an invincible army
[2:05:09] and then we can do a work for the lord
[2:05:15] and this i say therefore
[2:05:17] and testify
[2:05:19] and testify in the lord that you
[2:05:21] henceforth walk
[2:05:22] not as the gentiles in the vanity of
[2:05:26] their minds
[2:05:28] let's skip down now
[2:05:31] down here
[2:05:34] if so be that you've heard of him and
[2:05:36] have been taught of by uh him as the
[2:05:39] truth is in jesus christ
[2:05:41] put off your former conversation
[2:05:44] of of the old man which is corrupt and
[2:05:46] deceitful lust and be renewed in the
[2:05:50] spirit of your mind
[2:05:52] that you might put on the new man that's
[2:05:54] the clothes our brother was talking
[2:05:56] about that they tried to strip off the
[2:05:59] the the the traveler see that created in
[2:06:03] righteousness and in true holiness
[2:06:07] and in true holiness
[2:06:09] 31 31 let all bitterness
[2:06:12] and wrath
[2:06:14] and anger
[2:06:15] and clamor
[2:06:16] and evil speaking
[2:06:18] be put away from you
[2:06:20] with all
[2:06:21] malice
[2:06:23] and
[2:06:24] be
[2:06:25] ye
[2:06:26] kind to one another
[2:06:29] tender hearted
[2:06:31] forgiving
[2:06:33] one another
[2:06:36] people say
[2:06:37] i can forgive but i can't forget
[2:06:42] so i was looking up in the concordance
[2:06:44] one time forgive
[2:06:46] i was looking you don't look up in your
[2:06:48] concord and forgive
[2:06:49] you know what the word above it is
[2:06:52] forget
[2:06:54] so before you can get to forgive you got
[2:06:56] to forgive
[2:07:00] saints i believe
[2:07:02] if we really love somebody
[2:07:05] they can transgress against us
[2:07:09] and
[2:07:10] brother said my bible does your bible
[2:07:12] say this brother sir
[2:07:14] my bible says
[2:07:16] that love
[2:07:17] covers
[2:07:18] a multitude of sins
[2:07:22] so if somebody that i love transgresses
[2:07:26] against me
[2:07:27] i don't even see it
[2:07:29] it's as though they never did it
[2:07:32] there was a preacher i met him over in
[2:07:33] germany he was from canada
[2:07:37] and his name was gunther brother gunther
[2:07:39] a good preacher brother you would like
[2:07:41] to heard him preach
[2:07:45] and he said they were married for 40
[2:07:46] years
[2:07:48] and his wife looked up at him and said
[2:07:49] gunther
[2:07:51] yes sweetheart
[2:07:52] he said she says you got a crooked nose
[2:07:56] he said my nose clubbing he said yeah
[2:07:58] you got a crooked nose
[2:08:00] she said he said there said i did that
[2:08:02] when i played football in high school

[2:08:06] they've been married 42 years and she
[2:08:08] didn't even see it
[2:08:13] you see love is blind
[2:08:17] my friends
[2:08:20] what this church needs
[2:08:23] more
[2:08:25] than anything else
[2:08:29] is perfect love
[2:08:32] with feeling
[2:08:34] when i shake the brother's hand and i
[2:08:37] look into his eyes
[2:08:39] he can feel
[2:08:41] my love
[2:08:43] the day
[2:08:44] of this church of people coming in and

[2:11:05] our stand

[2:11:08] in the beauty of holiness
[2:11:11] without regret

[2:11:51] give the lord a hand again
[2:11:54] [Applause]
[2:11:56] hallelujah
[2:11:58] see that we depend on each other right
[2:12:01] amen
[2:12:03] that's why i'm
[2:12:06] i'm doing everything that i can to put
[2:12:08] the word in your hand
[2:12:10] if you don't have a cod we purchase a
[2:12:12] cod for everybody so when you built
[2:12:15] yourself you built yourself you built
[2:12:16] yourself even if i'm not available you
[2:12:20] can pray for brother lama on the phone
[2:12:22] and god take care of the problem amen
[2:12:25] amen
[2:12:26] i hope you catch the ministry the way
[2:12:28] it's working
[2:12:30] this is not one man
[2:12:32] working and everybody else sitting at
[2:12:34] home and waiting to be fed that's not
[2:12:37] the way it's working amen when you pray
[2:12:41] you pray for me i need your prayer you
[2:12:43] need my prayer amen
[2:12:46] amen you all need to read the bible you
[2:12:49] all need to listen to the message you
[2:12:51] all need to read the message we all need
[2:12:53] one another we all need to grow together
[2:12:57] in the lord amen let's stand
[2:13:00] blessed be the name of the lord standing
[2:13:03] with understanding hallelujah you stand
[2:13:07] with revelation
[2:13:09] you know who you are you know where
[2:13:11] you're standing amen
[2:13:13] not a religion
[2:13:14] anymore hallelujah
[2:13:17] like brother sam say if you come to
[2:13:19] church because you don't want anybody to
[2:13:20] say something about you then you're
[2:13:22] wrong
[2:13:24] and people usually stop there but if you
[2:13:26] stay at home while you should be in
[2:13:28] church you're also wrong one is wrong
[2:13:31] with the wrong spirit one is wrong with
[2:13:33] a religious spirit and both are wrong
[2:13:37] amen because those that struggle have a
[2:13:40] tendency yes amen and no it means you
[2:13:42] need to be in church
[2:13:44] hallelujah you don't stay home and stay
[2:13:47] away from church hallelujah
[2:13:49] amen
[2:13:51] hallelujah
[2:13:52] speaking in tongues
[2:13:54] is a gift of the holy ghost
[2:13:58] but it is not a proof that you have the
[2:14:00] holy ghost but if you have the holy
[2:14:02] ghost brother branham say you will speak
[2:14:04] in tongues
[2:14:05] amen
[2:14:07] so you can't get away from speaking in
[2:14:09] tongues because you don't want to get
[2:14:10] the holy ghost
[2:14:13] did you hear me
[2:14:15] you want me to repeat it
[2:14:16] amen
[2:14:18] you might speak in tongue
[2:14:20] but you don't have the holy ghost
[2:14:22] but somebody who have the holy ghost
[2:14:25] speak in tongues
[2:14:26] and the under and the tendency in the
[2:14:29] message
[2:14:30] is when somebody's speaking in tongues
[2:14:33] somebody might come up with a quote and
[2:14:35] say okay you can speak in tongues and
[2:14:37] you don't have the holy
[2:14:38] ghost no no
[2:14:41] you might have the holy ghost and speak
[2:14:43] in tongue too
[2:14:44] that is the truth in other words strive
[2:14:46] for what is good
[2:14:48] amen get the holy ghost speak in tongue
[2:14:51] that's what we want amen but not you
[2:14:54] don't want to speak in tongues you don't
[2:14:55] want to have the holy ghost that's a
[2:14:56] problem amen so remember we're depending
[2:14:59] on each other
[2:15:01] amen
[2:15:02] i was telling a young man i say you're a
[2:15:04] young man you don't have bills yet you
[2:15:07] don't have a lot of problem in life this
[2:15:09] is the time for you to read the message
[2:15:12] this is the time for you to invest in
[2:15:14] your spiritual work before by the time
[2:15:17] you get married you start working you
[2:15:19] got children you must still read the
[2:15:21] message but it's not going to be in the
[2:15:23] speed
[2:15:24] that you would have done if you did it
[2:15:26] yourself amen
[2:15:28] this is the time for you to sit and
[2:15:30] listen to the tape and read and read and
[2:15:32] read and read because one time it's
[2:15:34] gonna be handy you were needed and when
[2:15:38] you needed you got four kids shouting
[2:15:40] and jumping around you're not gonna be
[2:15:42] sitting there listening to a whole tape
[2:15:44] amen
[2:15:45] so young people i'm insisting you that
[2:15:48] tomorrow if the lord terry invest
[2:15:50] yourself in the lord we preach to you
[2:15:53] brother uh paul says that if a woman is
[2:15:56] a virgin what does she do she give
[2:15:58] herself to who to christ to the lord so
[2:16:02] normally before you get married in this
[2:16:04] church you should be loaded
[2:16:07] everybody here loaded by the sermon
[2:16:09] loaded by what you believe the home what
[2:16:12] you're listening to so when you get into
[2:16:14] marriage your marriage is going to be
[2:16:16] easier than when we started amen
[2:16:19] how can you
[2:16:21] have all that you have now and struggle
[2:16:24] the same way we did struggle when we
[2:16:26] started
[2:16:27] that's not correct
[2:16:28] amen if the old generation struggle and
[2:16:31] start from zero we want you to start a
[2:16:34] seven
[2:16:35] amen
[2:16:36] so you don't have to experience
[2:16:38] everything that we did experience when
[2:16:41] we started you have everything handed to
[2:16:43] you but sometimes human nature when they
[2:16:46] hand them everything that's when they
[2:16:48] get so lazy
[2:16:50] you will think when we're washing our
[2:16:52] clothes with washing machine when we
[2:16:54] have rice cooker and everything it gives
[2:16:57] us more time the less people are reading
[2:16:59] the bible
[2:17:00] the less people are listening to the
[2:17:01] message that's when god sends you trial
[2:17:05] because that's one way to wake you up
[2:17:08] you don't want trials
[2:17:09] do what is right and god will take care
[2:17:11] of the rest
[2:17:12] if you look in the scripture you will
[2:17:14] see the king of israel the bible say and
[2:17:16] god give them peace all around god give
[2:17:19] them rest all around if you notice the
[2:17:21] bible say because they did that which is
[2:17:24] good in the eyes of the lord then the
[2:17:26] lord give them rest if you don't want to
[2:17:29] go into a lot of trouble invest yourself
[2:17:31] amen you want to pass school you need to
[2:17:34] invest yourself you need to stay home
[2:17:36] you got to study and you got to go go
[2:17:39] and get some good grade but you're not
[2:17:40] going to sleep don't do anything and you
[2:17:43] expect to have good grade it's not going
[2:17:44] to work amen
[2:17:47] do what the lord wants you to do amen
[2:17:50] read the scripture even if you don't
[2:17:52] understand it read the scripture one day
[2:17:55] something can come in your way and the
[2:17:58] holy ghost will anoint the scripture and
[2:18:00] bring it back to you and sometimes you
[2:18:02] wonder where was that scripture it feels
[2:18:04] like it was in the bible yes it was in
[2:18:06] the bible you just don't remember
[2:18:08] exactly where it was but the holy spirit
[2:18:10] already registered that and he will give
[2:18:12] it to you and you're going to fight that
[2:18:14] demon amen
[2:18:15] but if you don't listen to it that is
[2:18:17] not good i have seen this tendency i've
[2:18:20] seen it in the message and i've seen it
[2:18:22] and that's why it's a mess amen
[2:18:25] you preach the word on sunday the people
[2:18:27] get out from the church they go to the
[2:18:30] restaurant all they're talking about is
[2:18:32] just fun
[2:18:35] it's just joking
[2:18:36] it's like a jokey spirit

[2:18:58] there the holy spirit will come
[2:19:00] and you will sit there five hours

[2:22:06] you're going to remember you're going to
[2:22:07] realize what i'm telling you
[2:22:09] and all you're doing is just you're
[2:22:11] trying to climb and it it pulls you down
[2:22:13] you're trying to climb and you pause
[2:22:14] your night before you know it
[2:22:16] you just mean hey what is going on you

[2:22:23] you go
[2:22:25] before the the song service star jokes
[2:22:27] such a joke you're breaking the
[2:22:29] anointing
[2:22:30] brother branham said that even
[2:22:33] branham say he was that's the reason why
[2:22:35] he was driving even some time alone
[2:22:37] because he doesn't want to talk to
[2:22:39] anybody before the service because as he
[2:22:42] keep talking talking talking the
[2:22:44] anointing leave
[2:22:46] you a musician you get here get serious
[2:22:51] take that jokey spirit leave it up there
[2:22:54] i don't know why this is coming from you
[2:22:56] get here get serious
[2:22:58] you get in this pulpit get serious
[2:23:01] amen because somebody's depending on
[2:23:04] that song to get a healing
[2:23:07] david sung and the demon left somebody
[2:23:10] so if you want to sing your song can
[2:23:12] deliver somebody before when i get here
[2:23:14] amen so once you get here you start
[2:23:16] joking joking right at the beginning on
[2:23:19] the parking lot joking before you know
[2:23:21] it you're sitting you touching an
[2:23:23] instrument you're playing but there is
[2:23:24] no anointing
[2:23:26] because you just destroy the anointing
[2:23:28] you start with that jokey spirit all the
[2:23:31] time all the time brother branham said
[2:23:33] that's a spirit in america entertainment
[2:23:36] and joking all the time all the time and
[2:23:38] you can't get serious so god have to
[2:23:41] send some hard trial
[2:23:43] then you see somebody serious and you
[2:23:45] see them they want to go to church if
[2:23:47] they if you see them going to church
[2:23:49] just know there is a trouble coming up
[2:23:51] as soon as the trouble is resolved
[2:23:53] you don't see them again
[2:23:55] they're waiting for the next trouble
[2:23:57] everybody here
[2:23:59] church i am not going to get your blood
[2:24:02] in my hand
[2:24:04] it might sound tough difficult
[2:24:06] but i have to tell you everything that
[2:24:10] you need to know if not it's not going
[2:24:12] to work
[2:24:13] i've seen three spirits working together
[2:24:16] and they're very bad
[2:24:18] very very bad
[2:24:20] you want to know them or you want to go
[2:24:21] home
[2:24:22] the first one is a pride spirit
[2:24:26] that's what caused lucifer to go down
[2:24:29] and when you have a combination of a
[2:24:31] proud spirit
[2:24:32] with a stubborn spirit
[2:24:35] then it's a problem again
[2:24:37] and when you add to the stubborn spirit
[2:24:39] a dominating spirit
[2:24:42] amen those three spirits if you got them
[2:24:45] you got in trouble if you get in the
[2:24:47] marriage you're gonna get in trouble
[2:24:49] clear period amen period clear amen and
[2:24:54] if they linger longer
[2:24:56] those spirits create a secondary nature
[2:25:00] when you become manipulative
[2:25:03] back here
[2:25:05] either the the wife have the spirit and
[2:25:08] it's going to be the husband that have
[2:25:10] to suffer and they reach a point where
[2:25:12] they give away
[2:25:14] they just flow with the the
[2:25:17] marriage the way it's going because
[2:25:19] the husband doesn't listen
[2:25:21] amen or either it's on the husband and
[2:25:24] it's the wife that is suffering and
[2:25:26] sometimes you must see the wife trying
[2:25:27] to do something outside like she's
[2:25:30] leaving the scripture truly she's not
[2:25:32] leaving the scripture she has a stubborn
[2:25:34] husband that doesn't listen and she got
[2:25:37] text stuff in charges
[2:25:39] and when she's trying to take stuff in
[2:25:41] charges she's appearing to you like
[2:25:44] she's getting out of line based on the
[2:25:46] message if you're not careful you can
[2:25:48] strike her she's not the problem the
[2:25:50] problem is the husband is not taking his
[2:25:52] position
[2:25:58] i can sit and break this down all over
[2:26:00] and you're going to see
[2:26:02] you got those stuff get them away
[2:26:04] they're not good you can live with those
[2:26:06] kind of spirit because it's a hard
[2:26:08] spirit to make you realize you wrong
[2:26:11] you're always right what you're feeling
[2:26:14] is right what you're talking about is
[2:26:16] right and people have to either
[2:26:18] understand you or not if not they don't
[2:26:20] like you
[2:26:23] amen a very very bad combination of
[2:26:26] spirit
[2:26:27] amen
[2:26:28] and sometimes it's covered by some are
[2:26:30] harsh by nature you will see it coming
[2:26:33] up some are not harsh by nature but they
[2:26:35] kind of sweet those are the very deadly
[2:26:37] ones
[2:26:38] honey and she's she got the street
[2:26:41] behind
[2:26:44] i don't know where that is coming from i
[2:26:45] wish the whole church was here then
[2:26:47] you're gonna hear me amen very sweet but
[2:26:49] dominating very sweet but stubborn very
[2:26:53] sweet but proud
[2:26:55] it's appearing humble by sweetness but
[2:26:57] it's not humble when she stand that's
[2:27:00] what is gonna be done if it's not done
[2:27:02] no peace at home
[2:27:07] hallelujah i've seen all of them my
[2:27:10] brother amen
[2:27:12] this is real stuff
[2:27:15] amen we cannot be in the house of god
[2:27:18] housing demon
[2:27:20] amen there's no way no way and in a
[2:27:23] message we play so long until the people
[2:27:27] were living with demon and they got
[2:27:29] comfortable with demon and when
[2:27:31] something happened this one is outside
[2:27:33] the message and how can you leave the
[2:27:35] message today and tomorrow you flip
[2:27:36] completely
[2:27:38] no no no you were not in a message
[2:27:40] demons were already waiting all they
[2:27:41] were waiting is just for an open door
[2:27:44] do you think it's easy for you to just
[2:27:46] live today and get a beer and drink it
[2:27:48] it would take a while for you to even
[2:27:50] get to that beer over there but how can
[2:27:52] you leave the message today and you got
[2:27:53] a beer and drink something is wrong

[2:31:25] father tonight thanking you for speaking
[2:31:28] to us lord
[2:31:30] father i don't know who needed this
[2:31:33] but i know exactly that there are
[2:31:35] children of god that are in bondage
[2:31:38] not that they are bad but father it's
[2:31:41] just the spirit that have overtaken them
[2:31:44] over the years lord and trying to put
[2:31:46] them in a lukewarm situation that they
[2:31:49] don't know how to move forward
[2:31:52] father some are streaming and probably
[2:31:54] will streamlay the lord that's the
[2:31:57] antichrist and these demonic spirit lord
[2:32:00] are attacking homes
[2:32:02] where father i kinda hurt but as a
[2:32:06] shepherd we bear one another lord when
[2:32:09] we conceive and the decision the people
[2:32:11] are making are no longer even based on
[2:32:14] the word but based on a benefit that is
[2:32:17] all carnal
[2:32:18] father we pray in the name of jesus
[2:32:20] christ that you give a revelation father
