[28:51] um just a quick um testimony um it
[28:54] should I can make it shorter but I'm
[28:55] just kind of going to explain everything
[28:57] just so you guys can understand how
[28:58] everything went um yesterday I had a
[29:01] great day at work woke up that was
[29:03] already a blessing um went to work um I
[29:06] was assigned with you know two kids
[29:08] usually I I normally don't work with two
[29:10] kids but I just took the assignment I
[29:12] was working with them and then
[29:13] unfortunately and unfortunately they had
[29:14] two dogs so as I was at work you know I
[29:18] kind I just didn't want to get stressed
[29:19] out about that um especially when the
[29:22] mom was kind of giving me more
[29:23] instruction about the dogs versus the
[29:25] kids so I just feel like I was coming
[29:26] for the dogs but um overall everything
[29:29] went smoothly um I was able to train
[29:31] them nicely and everything everything
[29:33] went smoothly um it was a relaxing day
[29:36] little girl even went to sleep for like
[29:37] three hours so I was only taking care of
[29:38] one kid so I was just thankful for that
[29:41] um and then you know as the day went um
[29:43] I went to Walmart um last night with
[29:45] sister a actually so um I don't remember
[29:48] exactly where I placed or or how I left
[29:51] my phone on top of the trunk of the car
[29:54] um I think I think I think it was
[29:56] probably when I was holding like um my
[29:57] my my notebook that I kind of had notes
[29:59] of everything I wanted to buy um
[30:01] yesterday so I appar apparently when I
[30:03] picked it up I kind of forgot that my
[30:06] phone was with in my hand or something
[30:07] like that so we went in you know we were
[30:09] just talking fellowshipping she was
[30:10] giving me advice Etc so of course I
[30:12] didn't think about my phone at all until
[30:14] when um we were walking out the store
[30:16] and and then as as I got closer to the
[30:18] car some of my phone was just laying on
[30:19] the top of the trunk and I was like oh
[30:21] my God thank you Lord then nobody stole
[30:23] my phone because and then the first
[30:26] thing she said she was like you better
[30:27] thank God that you know um the devil you
[30:29] know especially you having a good day
[30:30] the devil was trying to mess up your day
[30:32] and then God was right there and told
[30:33] him to move out the way so I just want
[30:34] to give God the glory for protecting my
[30:36] phone um and I was able to get it and it
[30:38] wasn't lost so I thank God for
[30:42] that amen and amen amen we're going to

[1:05:44] three let every word be established amen
[1:05:47] and you know uh being a part of this

[1:05:52] it's even more fit for me to repeat this

[1:05:59] amen we do not celebrate Christmas
[1:06:03] amen and we know there's a reason why we
[1:06:05] don't celebrate Christmas amen because
[1:06:08] our Prophet amen he taught us the
[1:06:10] Revelation that you know Jesus wasn't
[1:06:12] even born in
[1:06:13] December amen that was that is the Pagan
[1:06:16] son God amen amen and because what they
[1:06:19] did was they said you know um uh let's
[1:06:23] have the son of God's birth they on the
[1:06:26] son God's birthday amen so that's what
[1:06:28] they did when they cuz they were already
[1:06:30] full of so many uh uh uh religions when
[1:06:33] they took the Christian religion and
[1:06:34] they tried to push it into their agenda
[1:06:37] amen and um you know I I say our Prophet
[1:06:41] amen because you know he was sent to
[1:06:43] this age amen and that you know I
[1:06:45] identify with this age amen I identify
[1:06:49] with you know the lady seeing age with
[1:06:51] the message that was given amen and
[1:06:54] identify with the bride of this age amen
[1:06:57] and I identify with the Revelation that
[1:06:59] Paul was longing for in this day amen
[1:07:01] that we have amen we have the fullness
[1:07:03] of everything amen and I'm thankful
[1:07:07] because you know we every other age was
[1:07:10] they given reformers amen but we weren't
[1:07:12] given a reformer we were given a
[1:07:13] restorer amen and He restored the the
[1:07:16] hearts of the of um the hearts of the
[1:07:18] children back to the fathers amen and
[1:07:22] and you know uh and through every age
[1:07:24] amen there it can never stick amen
[1:07:26] through every age they grew cold and
[1:07:29] they were formed into denominations amen
[1:07:32] and um I would like to read a quote from
[1:07:34] uh the handwriting on the wall in uh
[1:07:38] 1958 in
[1:07:40] 0618 it reads um and my most beloved
[1:07:43] friends were just at another Junction we
[1:07:46] had, 1500 years in Catholicism Along

[1:07:53] cooled off along come the Baptist and
[1:07:56] cooled off Along come the Pentecost
[1:07:59] cooled off or it never went to a cooling
[1:08:01] off got lukewarm amen but just before
[1:08:04] this great cooling off or lukewarmness
[1:08:06] of the Pentecostal Church there must
[1:08:08] come again on the scene the supernatural
[1:08:10] amen the prophets amen and great
[1:08:13] messages amen and the healing of the
[1:08:16] sick and the raising of the Dead amen
[1:08:18] it's God's signpost amen we're at the
[1:08:21] end time amen the church is lukewarm
[1:08:23] just cooling off and going away it has
[1:08:25] to be that way God said it would be that
[1:08:27] way amen but the warning is to him to
[1:08:31] him that has ears to hear Let Him hear
[1:08:34] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[1:08:36] amen and I would like to get to that
[1:08:38] amen about about the ear amen and um you
[1:08:42] know we were given a prophet that will
[1:08:43] restore all things amen and though all
[1:08:46] things have already been restored amen
[1:08:48] because Revelations 10:7 tells us that
[1:08:50] amen he tells us that but in the days of
[1:08:53] the voice of the seventh seventh angel
[1:08:55] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:08:57] of God should be finished as he have
[1:08:59] declared to his servants the prophets
[1:09:01] amen amen and uh you know and the
[1:09:05] another thing IID like to share is um a
[1:09:08] little testimony that uh that goes along
[1:09:10] with with this scripture of how you know
[1:09:12] all things have already been you know
[1:09:15] all the all the Mysteries have already
[1:09:16] been you know given amen it's just that
[1:09:19] God's word is so infinite that every
[1:09:21] time we open the scripture verse it
[1:09:24] seems like more is coming out of it amen
[1:09:27] and I would like to share a testimony
[1:09:29] that I shared with my parents amen I
[1:09:32] feel like it would help the church as
[1:09:33] well um so I I'm taking a math class in
[1:09:37] school and in my math class uh they the
[1:09:41] teacher you know half the time I can't
[1:09:43] understand what he's saying but when I
[1:09:45] do understand what he's saying is really
[1:09:46] awesome because he she showed us that
[1:09:49] you know um from one number to the next
[1:09:52] number is infinite so from number one to
[1:09:54] two is an Infinity in between that and I
[1:09:58] was like wow that's pretty interesting
[1:09:59] you know how is that possible and he
[1:10:01] explained it of how you can have your
[1:10:03] number one it's number two but between
[1:10:05] one and two you have 1.1 1.9 you have
[1:10:09] 1.99 999 keep on going amen and you can
[1:10:13] technically never reach number two amen
[1:10:15] and I was like wow that's that's pretty
[1:10:17] cool right because because when I'm
[1:10:19] reading my scriptures amen we're told
[1:10:20] that God's word is infinite so how you
[1:10:24] how do you get from one verse verse to
[1:10:25] the next verse amen so how so how can we
[1:10:29] always be stuck on like one verse for
[1:10:32] what 3 months but but it's more is more
[1:10:35] is coming out of it amen because you
[1:10:38] know it's even proven in and you know uh
[1:10:41] it's even proven in math amen that's
[1:10:43] just how God works amen and and you know
[1:10:46] we could be here until the Rapture and
[1:10:47] we still don't have everything here
[1:10:49] that's why he'll say he and fold himself
[1:10:51] throughout eternity so we'll never
[1:10:53] really get everything but we have
[1:10:56] everything here we have the tools to get
[1:10:58] everything but we just don't have time
[1:11:00] to get it
[1:11:03] amen
[1:11:05] so amen and um you know cuz we know uh
[1:11:09] Jesus he wasn't even born in the winter
[1:11:11] amen he was um he was born in Spring
[1:11:13] anden we know that he was born in April
[1:11:16] because that's the time when Lambs are
[1:11:17] born amen and I was doing my research
[1:11:21] and um I even found out that I looked up
[1:11:23] I was curious I said you know we're look
[1:11:25] talking about the bulock when are
[1:11:26] Bullocks born amen and so Bullocks are
[1:11:30] born from February to May so that's
[1:11:32] still spring April is still in there so
[1:11:36] that bulock that was that was slain in
[1:11:39] those seven years could have very well
[1:11:41] been born in April amen so I thought
[1:11:44] that was like a pretty cool thing amen
[1:11:47] and um you know we celebrate Jesus
[1:11:50] Christ just like the song said amen we
[1:11:52] celebrate his death his burial his
[1:11:54] resurrection amen because because of
[1:11:57] death burial and resurrection that that
[1:11:59] is what has given us the right Amen to
[1:12:02] call ourselves sons of God Amen that's
[1:12:04] what's given us the right Amen to take
[1:12:06] part in the promises and in the
[1:12:08] blessings amen and um you know we've
[1:12:11] been we've been given you know the
[1:12:13] revelation of this Bible by our Prophet
[1:12:16] to be able to discern the times we're
[1:12:17] living in amen and um so I would like to
[1:12:20] get to the topic at hand amen for
[1:12:23] tonight the title of tonight's ser
[1:12:26] is the application of the blood and oil
[1:12:28] for the
[1:12:29] priest I was um I was looking at it and
[1:12:32] you know we know what the blood
[1:12:34] represents we know what oil represents
[1:12:36] amen and we know the oil is the Holy
[1:12:38] Ghost amen and we know the blood that's
[1:12:40] the atonement amen and when I was
[1:12:42] reading these scriptures I said okay I
[1:12:45] know what the what what what they're
[1:12:47] using means but why are they putting it
[1:12:50] on their ears on their thumb and on on
[1:12:52] on their great toe amen and so I saw
[1:12:55] started you know um trying to use the
[1:12:57] you know the message apps that we have
[1:12:59] and you know how you press a verse and
[1:13:01] it shows you how many times brother BR
[1:13:03] spoke about it but I couldn't find
[1:13:04] nothing I was like man this is crazy I
[1:13:06] can't find anything on it so um I was
[1:13:09] looking and and I that's when uh the
[1:13:12] Lord touched uh brother stepen to say
[1:13:15] you know we're given all the tools
[1:13:16] necessary anden so I said let me stop
[1:13:18] being so superficial and stop being so
[1:13:21] stuck on just um you know what did he
[1:13:23] say by this exact same verse amen so I
[1:13:26] started looking into you know what does
[1:13:28] the blood mean what does the oil mean
[1:13:30] what does the air mean according to the
[1:13:33] message what does the thumb mean what
[1:13:34] does the right hand mean according to
[1:13:36] the message what does the right foot
[1:13:38] mean according to the message amen so um
[1:13:41] I would like to take this step by step
[1:13:43] amen um we
[1:13:46] we we may not finish it amen this
[1:13:49] service amen but I want to take it step
[1:13:51] by step I went through everything and um
[1:13:54] I don't have the answer but I believe
[1:13:55] the Lord has put me in the direction am
[1:13:58] so um first I like to go on go over the
[1:14:01] blood amen I feel like you can never
[1:14:03] never uh uh not talk about the blood
[1:14:05] especially when it's is brought up in
[1:14:07] the scriptures amen so um we know that
[1:14:09] the blood is a token amen we know that
[1:14:12] the blood is what separates the True
[1:14:13] Believer from the world Amen we know
[1:14:16] that you know you apply the token to
[1:14:18] distinguish yourself from the world Amen
[1:14:20] that's what distinguishes you know
[1:14:23] that's why they even have to do that
[1:14:24] when they were consecrating the priest
[1:14:26] amen because that that is that is the
[1:14:29] the that is what even allows you to
[1:14:31] become a priest because you have to
[1:14:33] recognize the blood of of when see back
[1:14:36] in that day they had an animal amen and
[1:14:38] they would put their hand on the
[1:14:39] animal's head and because they would
[1:14:41] feel the death and they would feel the
[1:14:43] quivering and so they would be
[1:14:44] identified with that amen and we're
[1:14:47] identified with Calvary amen so you see
[1:14:50] because in in the um Jesus he said
[1:14:53] blessed bless is him
[1:14:55] more who didn't even see it amen so so
[1:15:00] we didn't physically see calary amen but
[1:15:04] we believe it amen and we identified
[1:15:06] with that amen so being identified with
[1:15:08] that amen we're already what we're
[1:15:11] already uh um once you identify with the
[1:15:13] bud you're already at on different
[1:15:14] caliber amen and um so we know that um a
[1:15:18] a priest that is consecrated with blood
[1:15:20] and oil is separated from the world and
[1:15:22] separated from the false priest amen
[1:15:25] just like the anointed ones in the end
[1:15:26] time you know brother Bon preached amen
[1:15:29] and um you know that you can't go
[1:15:32] anywhere further with God Amen unless
[1:15:35] you acknowledge the blood amen unless
[1:15:37] you unless you acknowledge that unless
[1:15:40] you acknowledge the cross you can't even
[1:15:42] go further with God and you can't expect
[1:15:44] to go further with God because you can't
[1:15:47] expect the blessings if you haven't if a
[1:15:50] pardon is a pardon unless unless it's
[1:15:53] accepted as a pardon amen so you can't
[1:15:55] be you can't be expecting to to take
[1:15:59] part in those blessings if you don't
[1:16:00] even even believe you know in the person
[1:16:03] who's giv you those blessings amen you
[1:16:04] can't you can't look at the gifts you
[1:16:06] got to look at The Giver of the gifts
[1:16:07] amen and um so uh I would like to also
[1:16:11] say you know people acknowledge the
[1:16:13] blood in Calvary but they refuse to
[1:16:15] acknowledge the oil amen which is the
[1:16:17] Holy Ghost amen see and and what what do
[1:16:20] I mean by that amen so to receive the
[1:16:22] Holy Ghost you must commit a full
[1:16:24] surrender to the Lord Lord amen so what
[1:16:26] I mean by that is we know the prophet
[1:16:28] teaches us that you know uh people they
[1:16:31] they they uh recognize Jesus Christ they
[1:16:34] recognize the blood but they don't want
[1:16:35] to allow him to be Lord over their life
[1:16:38] you know they don't they don't want them
[1:16:39] to be Lord over you know um uh their
[1:16:42] conduct amen their order their Doctrine
[1:16:44] they don't they don't want them to be uh
[1:16:46] Lord over everything amen see because uh
[1:16:48] that's where you know the scripture
[1:16:50] comes in you know um you have a form of
[1:16:52] godliness but you're drinking the power
[1:16:54] thereof amen
[1:16:55] you see and uh uh brother brandham gives
[1:16:58] uh a story about um a man who went to
[1:17:01] the doctor he was sick and the doctor
[1:17:03] had the Cure so the man recognized he
[1:17:06] recognizes the doctor but he goes to the
[1:17:09] doctor's house and he sits on the steps
[1:17:10] amen and he says you know I'm here you
[1:17:13] know uh uh you know this is his job so
[1:17:14] I'm here he'll he'll do his work on me
[1:17:16] well that's not how it works amen you
[1:17:19] have to go in and and and surrender
[1:17:21] yourself to the doctor so he can work on
[1:17:23] you amen and and this man did this
[1:17:26] expecting you know for the God for the
[1:17:28] to the doctor to just work on him but he
[1:17:30] end up dying amen and you can't you
[1:17:32] can't blame the doctor for that amen the
[1:17:35] men didn't get off the steps amen and I
[1:17:37] was sharing that uh
[1:17:39] testimony I was speaking with brother uh
[1:17:41] Dam about it and he gave me a little
[1:17:44] nugget on it you know he said you know
[1:17:45] those steps can mean anything and then
[1:17:47] those steps can be you know your phone
[1:17:49] those steps can be you know wherever
[1:17:51] you're not giving up to the Lord it can
[1:17:53] be your free time you know it can be
[1:17:55] what whatever you're doing that you're
[1:17:57] saying okay I'm a Believer I live a
[1:17:59] consecrated life but there's that one
[1:18:01] thing that you're not giving up to the
[1:18:02] Lord those could be your steps amen and
[1:18:05] and um so I would like to give the um
[1:18:08] the the direct quote of this story amen
[1:18:11] um this is
[1:18:13] in this is in uh 1962 1123 on the way
[1:18:17] back Amen brother Brenham says well
[1:18:20] you've got a certain disease why he's
[1:18:22] got a medicine cabinet full Amen in
[1:18:25] there that will kill that disease it's a
[1:18:28] poison drug that will knock that disease
[1:18:30] out here's others they got healed amen
[1:18:32] look at them and man they had that
[1:18:34] disease and they've got it no more and
[1:18:36] the doctor's got plenty of medicine and
[1:18:38] you sit on the steps and say well I've
[1:18:39] come this far if he wants me to get
[1:18:41] healed he'll come out here and do it
[1:18:43] amen he says brother B says oh no no no
[1:18:46] that's that's not it no you'll die on
[1:18:48] those steps amen he says it won't be the
[1:18:52] doctor's fault neither will it be the
[1:18:53] lack of Medicine amen it is because of
[1:18:56] the own stubborn will of the people amen
[1:18:59] amen that won't take the medicine Amen
[1:19:02] in the church is the same amen we've got
[1:19:05] plenty of scripture amen we've got the
[1:19:07] thing that will straighten the church
[1:19:08] out amen we've got the thing that will
[1:19:10] send send you back to where you was 50
[1:19:13] years ago you um but you've got to want
[1:19:15] to take it amen you've got to want to
[1:19:18] get well a cure of these diseases the
[1:19:20] spiritual diseases must have it amen so
[1:19:24] we see the man acknowledges the doctor
[1:19:26] but refuses to allow the doctor to work
[1:19:27] on him amen and in um the seven Church
[1:19:31] ages book in the Samaran Church age uh
[1:19:34] brother bham says now watch carefully
[1:19:36] and get this Peter said repent and be
[1:19:38] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:19:41] the remission of sins and you shall
[1:19:42] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:19:45] see uh Paul said uh have ye received the
[1:19:48] Holy Ghost s you believe amen this is
[1:19:51] the whole of our problem right here
[1:19:54] people repent of their sins they get
[1:19:56] baptized in water this is in all this
[1:19:58] this whole sentence is in all caps he
[1:20:00] says but they do not go on and receive
[1:20:02] the Holy Ghost amen you believe you
[1:20:04] receive the spirit you believe unto
[1:20:07] receiving the spirit amen Believing on
[1:20:09] Jesus is the step in the right direction
[1:20:12] amen which is toward the Holy Ghost amen
[1:20:15] but people stop there amen I'm pause for
[1:20:17] a second you so you see how how he says
[1:20:20] you know um you believe unto receiving
[1:20:22] the spirit amen so we see how remember
[1:20:24] in our teachings in the Tabernacle amen
[1:20:27] of how you can enter the Tabernacle but
[1:20:29] you can get stuck amen you don't want to
[1:20:31] stay there too long amen once you get uh
[1:20:34] uh in the justification Jus
[1:20:36] justification step I'm sorry you want to
[1:20:38] hurry up and get into sanctification and
[1:20:40] and that's really dangerous because once
[1:20:42] you're stuck in sanctification you know
[1:20:44] that's how you get into
[1:20:45] self-righteousness you think you you
[1:20:46] know um I'm not doing anything wrong you
[1:20:49] know um I'm doing everything you know
[1:20:51] every time I'm in service nothing
[1:20:52] applies to me that he's saying so I'm
[1:20:54] I'm good amen so you just get stuck you
[1:20:56] start getting cold and get that's when
[1:20:58] you get lukewarm amen that's where
[1:21:00] Pentecost messed up they start to get
[1:21:02] lukewarm amen and then and then um those
[1:21:05] who who get into the Holy Ghost and then
[1:21:08] the Hol of holies amen there's another
[1:21:10] step after that because it makes way for
[1:21:12] the Holy Ghost himself amen so once you
[1:21:14] get into the holies of holies amen
[1:21:17] that's when you have the opportunity to
[1:21:19] fully surrender yourself to receive the
[1:21:21] Holy Ghost amen so I want I want you to
[1:21:24] continue it says they go as far as water
[1:21:27] and then stop amen they believe and then
[1:21:29] stop the Bible does not say uh that you
[1:21:32] receive when you believe it is have you
[1:21:35] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:21:36] believe amen that's ex the exact leral
[1:21:40] literal translation is did ye having
[1:21:43] previously believed receive the Holy
[1:21:45] Ghost amen the people believeth and stop
[1:21:48] amen you receive the Holy Ghost when you
[1:21:51] believe unto him having repented you go
[1:21:54] on and receive the Holy Ghost do you see
[1:21:56] it that is what is wrong with our
[1:21:58] fundamentalists they have no power for
[1:22:01] they stop short of Pentecost that's
[1:22:03] right amen now uh that was dealing with
[1:22:06] the blood amen now I would like to go
[1:22:08] into um uh the ear amen with what the
[1:22:11] Lord showed me with the ear amen now um
[1:22:14] with with the ear um uh a scripture hit
[1:22:17] hit my heart it says he that ha an he
[1:22:20] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[1:22:22] SP what the spirit saith unto the CH
[1:22:24] Church
[1:22:25] amen now we know this is mentioned for
[1:22:28] every church every
[1:22:30] age before the Lord goes into the other
[1:22:33] Church age he always says this amen so
[1:22:36] it must be very important amen amen you
[1:22:40] you have to hear what he's saying amen
[1:22:42] that means what he's saying is you have
[1:22:45] to read beyond what you're looking at
[1:22:47] amen you have to see you know when uh
[1:22:50] when brother bam brother bam had that
[1:22:52] vision of him cutting the mountain and
[1:22:54] was white amen when you're reading your
[1:22:56] Bible that white part that you're
[1:22:58] looking at amen that's what you have to
[1:23:00] see amen
[1:23:03] so I I'll just read it says um see in
[1:23:05] the church age book in the Sam in the
[1:23:07] Samaran Church age again uh brother bam
[1:23:10] says it is absolutely impossible for all
[1:23:13] men to hear what the spirit says to the
[1:23:15] different ages amen he says it is most
[1:23:19] evident from these scriptures which I
[1:23:21] get into um that no man of himself
[1:23:25] can hear God Amen that ability has to be
[1:23:28] given him of God Amen it says in uh
[1:23:32] Matthew 16:17 I like to go to that
[1:23:35] scripture
[1:23:37] Amen brother because we see that you
[1:23:40] know it it has to be given him of God
[1:23:42] meaning it's gifted to him amen amen
[1:23:45] meaning you know it's by Grace
[1:23:48] amen we go to uh Matthew uh 16:17 when
[1:23:53] you get there say am amen amen
[1:24:00] amen Matthew
[1:24:02] 167 yes sir it reads and Jesus answered
[1:24:06] and said unto him blessed art thou Simon
[1:24:08] bar Jonah for flesh and blood haveth not
[1:24:11] revealed it unto thee but my Father
[1:24:13] which is in heaven amen that is how we
[1:24:16] get the Revelation as well amen it's not
[1:24:18] given to us of man amen not we're not
[1:24:22] we're not Priests of man or by man we're
[1:24:24] is by God's grace amen not uh not by
[1:24:27] power not by might but by thy Spirit
[1:24:29] sayith the Lord amen that's how we're
[1:24:31] all saved aen that's why we're all saved
[1:24:33] by grace and me that's how when we read
[1:24:35] it that's why you know that we we have
[1:24:37] the saying in the message that the Bible
[1:24:39] is a new booken because we're able to
[1:24:41] see the love message that God put in
[1:24:43] there for his bride amen and only the
[1:24:46] bride can understand it amen amen cuz
[1:24:49] you give it to uh somebody else they'll
[1:24:51] read it they say okay I get what it's
[1:24:52] saying but what is it what does that
[1:24:54] mean for Meen they they don't get the
[1:24:56] same feeling they don't get the same uh
[1:24:59] uh uh deep pulling unto the Deep they
[1:25:01] don't get that same feeling when they
[1:25:02] read it amen amen um so I would like to
[1:25:05] continue it says um see because it's GI
[1:25:08] it to him amen see if you draw n unto
[1:25:10] God God God draws n unto you amen and
[1:25:14] that's in um John 6 uh verse 44 amen I
[1:25:18] like to go to John 6 verse 44 so you you

[1:25:25] Amen in uh John 6:44 when we get there

[1:25:34] hath sent me amen sent me draw him amen
[1:25:38] and I will raise him up in the last day
[1:25:40] amen and I would like to go to uh James
[1:25:43] 4 uh verse
[1:25:46] 8 and I would like to remember that the
[1:25:49] topic we're speaking of Amen is the ear
[1:25:52] amen and what is so important about that
[1:25:56] ear's go to
[1:25:59] James James
[1:26:03] 4:8 you get there say amen amen all
[1:26:07] right V verse eight it reads draw night
[1:26:10] unto God He will draw n unto you cleanse
[1:26:14] cleanse your hands ye Sinners and purify
[1:26:16] your hearts ye double-minded amen see so
[1:26:19] what he says ye double minded and mean
[1:26:20] you can't be you know wanting to serve
[1:26:22] God and man at the same time it doesn't
[1:26:24] work like that amen that's why you have
[1:26:27] to fully surrender amen and um
[1:26:29] continuing uh brother Brenham uh in the
[1:26:31] church age book he continues and speaks
[1:26:33] he says putting these verses together
[1:26:36] the on you just read he said we see that
[1:26:38] there's only one group of people right
[1:26:40] and that a very special group of people
[1:26:42] who are able to hear what the spirit
[1:26:44] says in each age amen that group is of
[1:26:47] God Amen because the group because the
[1:26:50] groups that cannot hear is not of God
[1:26:52] Amen it just that this is how it is amen
[1:26:55] you're not of God if you just can't see
[1:26:57] it you can't see it amen and um I was I
[1:26:59] was uh speaking with uh uh brother Kelly
[1:27:02] uh one afternoon and I was asking I said
[1:27:04] you know um I hear this a lot in the
[1:27:06] message you know theologians this
[1:27:08] theologians that you know what does that
[1:27:10] mean you know cuz you know I thought a
[1:27:12] theologian is someone who just you know
[1:27:13] likes to read their Bible and just you
[1:27:15] know I was like what is that what is
[1:27:16] wrong with that amen and um you know
[1:27:19] that's how I love brother Kelly he said
[1:27:21] just go to uh he said uh just go to I
[1:27:23] believe he told me just go to Matthew 16
[1:27:26] he just read it and I said okay I get it
[1:27:28] you know I get it now you know it's just
[1:27:30] if if you just don't if if it's not
[1:27:33] given you of God to see it you just
[1:27:34] won't see it amen and and so when
[1:27:37] theologians are
[1:27:39] referenc you know from what I understand
[1:27:41] I'm not going to say this is the
[1:27:43] definition of I'm say from what I
[1:27:45] understand so far is that when a
[1:27:46] theologian is is referenced that's just
[1:27:49] somebody who is who is wanting to see it
[1:27:51] but they just not they're just not
[1:27:53] chosen to see it amen they're they're
[1:27:56] looking in the word and they're they're
[1:27:57] in it night and day and they're you know
[1:28:00] they they just may not have revelation
[1:28:02] of you know a prophet amen and because
[1:28:05] of that they're applying their own
[1:28:06] interpretation to the word amen and
[1:28:08] that's why you know the you know uh the
[1:28:10] the scriptures say curse is he that add
[1:28:12] to curse is he that takes away anden and
[1:28:14] what is that saying don't give her own
[1:28:17] interpretation God God has a provided
[1:28:19] way for that amen and that is his
[1:28:21] Prophet am mean uh what is it Amos 3:7
[1:28:23] am mean do nothing except his uh uh uh
[1:28:26] uh through His prophets amen so so we
[1:28:29] have to go through the prophets because
[1:28:31] they they are the mouthpiece of God for
[1:28:32] that time amen and and using the
[1:28:35] prophets that's how you know what God is
[1:28:36] thinking that's that's the mind of God
[1:28:38] for that time amen amen and um I would
[1:28:42] like to go to um John 8 uh John 8 uh
[1:28:46] verse 42-44
[1:28:50] amen John 8
[1:28:55] yes
[1:28:57] sir can we get there say amen
[1:29:10] amen all right John 8 verse 42 it reads
[1:29:16] Jesus said unto them if God were your
[1:29:18] father you would love me for I proceeded
[1:29:21] forth and came from God neither came I
[1:29:24] of myself but he that set me amen why do
[1:29:28] you not understand my speech even
[1:29:30] because this is some answering this is
[1:29:33] him answering you know his question he's
[1:29:36] saying you know why can't you understand
[1:29:38] me amen why is it that I'm here in front
[1:29:40] of you and you guys are Pharisees you
[1:29:43] guys are Sadducees you know your word
[1:29:45] and me so yeah you're Theologian so why
[1:29:47] why can you not understand my speech
[1:29:49] amen and he says he he he he answers the
[1:29:52] question for him he says even because
[1:29:54] you cannot hear my word amen and what is
[1:29:57] the word amen the word of God Amen and
[1:30:00] and ye are of your father the devil Amen
[1:30:02] in the lust of your father he said in in
[1:30:05] in the lust of your father you will do
[1:30:07] he was a murder from the beginning in
[1:30:09] abold from the beginning and ab bold not
[1:30:12] in the truth amen so what what what is
[1:30:13] he saying here he's speaking to
[1:30:15] theologians amen and and um when someone
[1:30:19] is applying their own interpretation to
[1:30:21] a word amen they're killing the
[1:30:23] revelation of that word amen because you
[1:30:26] are you are you are disannulling the the
[1:30:29] the the Vindicated word of the Prophet
[1:30:31] for that age amen so so that's why he is
[1:30:34] saying right here that that he was a
[1:30:36] murder from the beginning in a bod not
[1:30:38] in the truth amen because he's rejecting
[1:30:40] the truth if if if you see um this is a
[1:30:44] revelation I was given to me recently as
[1:30:46] well amen uh humility amen humility is
[1:30:49] when is when you know you you have a
[1:30:52] thought and you're going to your word
[1:30:55] with a preconceived thought of you know
[1:30:56] what it means already and you find
[1:30:59] something else that's against that and
[1:31:02] you are humble enough to let go of the
[1:31:04] thought that you have and accept the
[1:31:06] thought that's there amen so that's
[1:31:09] humility amen and and and and these
[1:31:13] people were not humble enough to do that
[1:31:15] amen and he says that um because there
[1:31:19] is no truth in him when he speaketh a
[1:31:21] lie he speaketh of his own am amen for
[1:31:24] he is a liar and the father of it amen
[1:31:27] and what do we know a lie is amen a lie
[1:31:29] is 99% truth amen we know in the garden
[1:31:32] of edian the lie was one word off amen
[1:31:36] so again on the on theologians when you
[1:31:40] have you know someone who's applying
[1:31:41] their own thoughts amen and you ever
[1:31:43] talk to somebody who knows their Bible
[1:31:45] very well it's like they're right but
[1:31:49] they're missing something amen like like
[1:31:52] like they're missing that one word
[1:31:54] or they're off by a little bit and you
[1:31:58] you agree with them you're you're saying
[1:32:00] amen and you're agreeing with them
[1:32:01] you're saying well look at it this way
[1:32:03] look at it this way but they're just
[1:32:05] they just won't accept the truth because
[1:32:08] they have their own thought in that and
[1:32:10] that thought is one word off and because
[1:32:12] it's one word off you know that they
[1:32:14] believe they're right amen and um I like
[1:32:17] to I like to continue amen uh brother B
[1:32:19] continues he says uh that group that can
[1:32:22] and does not hear
[1:32:24] what what the spirit is saying and
[1:32:26] receive the Revelation thereof is that
[1:32:29] group described in 1 Corinthians 2 uh
[1:32:33] 6-6 amen I like to go to that uh 1
[1:32:36] Corinthians 2
[1:32:39] amen can you get there say amen amen
[1:32:52] amen and I like to
[1:32:54] remind you again of the topic we're on
[1:32:56] Amen we're on the ear and we're talking
[1:32:58] about the ear amen yes sir why was the
[1:33:00] ear so important that the blood the
[1:33:02] blood and the oil you see because we
[1:33:03] went to uh we went
[1:33:06] to Exodus and they went to Leviticus
[1:33:08] Amen in Exodus they had blood on the ear
[1:33:12] on on the finger on on the foot and then
[1:33:14] Leviticus they had oil amen so both of
[1:33:17] those must be applied
[1:33:19] amen so um 1 Corinthians 2:16 through
[1:33:24] six
[1:33:25] amen it reads how be it we speak wisdom
[1:33:28] among them that are perfect yet not the
[1:33:30] wisdom of this world Amen we know
[1:33:32] there's two wisdoms amen nor of the
[1:33:35] princes of this world that come to not
[1:33:37] amen see the the the wisdom of this
[1:33:40] world comes to not it comes to nothing
[1:33:42] amen it um it's vanity it you know you
[1:33:45] why gain the whole world and but you
[1:33:47] lose your soul amen and it says but we
[1:33:50] speak and I like to also mention this as
[1:33:53] well know that wisdom is the the best uh
[1:33:57] Divine gift that you can have amen
[1:34:00] so something else is in here amen that
[1:34:03] you know uh the wisdom of the world Amen
[1:34:06] that's that one word off amen it's it's
[1:34:09] it's a powerful gift to have the wisdom
[1:34:11] of the world the the wisdom of God it's
[1:34:13] powerful but if you're in one word off
[1:34:15] you're still wrong amen that's why you
[1:34:17] gain this whole world that's why if you
[1:34:19] have wisdom in the world you gain the
[1:34:21] whole world because it's a powerful gift
[1:34:23] to have
[1:34:24] amen I just wanted to uh say that amen
[1:34:29] and um verse S it says that we speak the
[1:34:32] wisdom of God in a mystery amen even the
[1:34:35] hidden wisdom which God ordained before
[1:34:38] the world unto our glory amen for our
[1:34:41] glory amen which none of the princes of
[1:34:43] this world knew for they had known it
[1:34:46] they would not they not have crucified
[1:34:48] the Lord of glory amen but as it is
[1:34:51] written I have not seen Nor Ear heard
[1:34:54] amen neither have entered into the heart
[1:34:57] of man the things which God hath
[1:34:59] prepared for them that love him amen but
[1:35:02] God had revealed them to us by his
[1:35:04] spirit amen how could that ear hear how
[1:35:07] could that eye see amen how could it
[1:35:10] enter into the heart of that man because
[1:35:12] of the spirit amen see because there's
[1:35:14] another scripture that says uh um how uh
[1:35:18] uh how can you know the ways of man uh
[1:35:20] except for the spirit the spirit of the
[1:35:21] man knows ways of the man amen and for
[1:35:24] God the spirit of God knows the thing
[1:35:25] things of God Amen and the only way you
[1:35:28] can know the things of God is by the
[1:35:29] spirit of God Amen and and
[1:35:32] um amen and then uh we'll go to uh
[1:35:36] finish verse uh 10 it says but God ha
[1:35:38] revealed them unto us by his spirit for
[1:35:41] the spirit Seth all things they the Deep
[1:35:43] things of God Amen see so it's not just
[1:35:45] you know the uh the The Superficial on
[1:35:48] top you know that everybody knows amen
[1:35:51] he goes into the deep things of God Amen
[1:35:53] and and that's the gold mins amen that
[1:35:56] keep on going that's the that's the
[1:35:58] Infinity of one scripture that keeps on
[1:36:00] going amen the Deep things of God Amen
[1:36:02] for because we're supposed to see Jesus
[1:36:04] Christ in every scripture amen and if
[1:36:06] you see Jesus Christ in every scripture
[1:36:08] if if you don't you got to read it again
[1:36:10] because you miss something amen that's
[1:36:12] why we don't read our Bible like a
[1:36:14] newspaper that's why we that's why we
[1:36:16] don't just um you know we know we're
[1:36:18] supposed to read a scripture at night
[1:36:19] scripture in the morning amen and um you
[1:36:23] know the Prophet also said it you know
[1:36:24] people love sleep amen so um if you're
[1:36:27] if you're wanting to read your Bible
[1:36:29] like a newspaper amen then you'll just
[1:36:31] wake up five minutes for you got to
[1:36:32] leave and read it and say okay ready and
[1:36:34] you keep going amen but if you if you
[1:36:37] wake up a little earlier you're able to
[1:36:38] read your Bible how you're supposed to
[1:36:40] read it sir not have to worry about the
[1:36:42] time amen and if you and if you get
[1:36:44] ready to go to sleep a little earlier
[1:36:46] you know you'll be able to read your
[1:36:47] Bible like you want to you not have to
[1:36:48] worry about time amen amen um continue
[1:36:53] says um verse 11 uh for what man knoweth
[1:36:57] the things of man save the spirit of man
[1:36:59] I amen this is what it was saying uh
[1:37:01] spirit of man which is in him even so
[1:37:03] the things of God knoweth no man but the
[1:37:06] spirit of God Amen now we have received
[1:37:09] not the spirit of the world Amen see
[1:37:11] this he's he's confirming uh verse 11
[1:37:14] amen and now we have received not the
[1:37:17] things of the world the spirit of the
[1:37:18] world but the spirit which is of God
[1:37:21] Amen that we might know the things that
[1:37:23] are freely given to us of God amen amen
[1:37:26] see where uh uh the free freely given
[1:37:29] things which is a gift amen which things
[1:37:32] also we speak not in The Words which
[1:37:34] man's Wisdom teacheth amen but which the
[1:37:38] Holy Ghost teacheth amen comparing
[1:37:40] spiritual things with spiritual amen it
[1:37:43] says um but the natural man receiveth
[1:37:45] not the things of the spirit of God Amen
[1:37:48] because he's natural he's carnal amen
[1:37:50] for they are foolish unto him amen he he
[1:37:52] doesn't see the value in it amen um
[1:37:56] because they are spirit because they
[1:37:58] they are foolish unto him neither can he
[1:38:00] know them see even if he tried even
[1:38:04] neither can he know them even if he
[1:38:05] tried to know them because they are
[1:38:07] spiritually discerned
[1:38:08] amen uh continue uh verse 15 it says but
[1:38:12] he that is spiritual judgeth all things
[1:38:15] yet he himself is judged of no man cuz
[1:38:18] we know he's judge of God Amen only Gods
[1:38:20] can judge Gods amen for who hath known
[1:38:23] the mind of the Lord but he may instruct
[1:38:26] that that he may instruct him but we
[1:38:28] have the mind of Christ amen amen now I
[1:38:31] to um continue brother brother Brandon
[1:38:34] saying in this quote he says they are
[1:38:37] this I'mma go back so we understand what
[1:38:38] he was saying anden he says the group of
[1:38:41] that can and does hear what the spirit
[1:38:44] is saying and receives this the
[1:38:46] Revelation thereof is that group
[1:38:48] described in 1 Corinthians 2616 we just
[1:38:52] read amen and he continues he says they
[1:38:55] are the one they are the one who have
[1:38:58] the spirit of God Amen they are the ones
[1:39:00] that are born of God they are baptized
[1:39:03] into the body of the Lord Jesus Christ

[1:42:26] um therefore speak I to them in Parables
[1:42:29] because they seeing see not in hearing
[1:42:32] they hear not that's right neither do
[1:42:34] they understand amen and in them is
[1:42:36] fulfilled all is fulfilled the prophecy
[1:42:39] of of of Isaiah Isiah which sayith by
[1:42:42] hearing you shall hear and shall not
[1:42:45] understand and seeing ye shall see and
[1:42:47] shall not perceive amen see this is the
[1:42:50] theologians again amen they're they're
[1:42:52] looking they're trying to hear it but
[1:42:53] just won't get it amen for this people's
[1:42:56] heart is waxed gross and their ears are
[1:42:58] dull of hearing amen and their eyes and
[1:43:01] their eyes have closed lest at any time
[1:43:04] they should see with their eyes amen so
[1:43:06] what the Lord is telling is that he did
[1:43:07] this amen that he closed their eyes he
[1:43:10] closed their ears amen he's saying for
[1:43:12] the people's hearts is waxed gross and
[1:43:14] their ears are dull of hearing and their
[1:43:17] eyes have closed lest at any time see so
[1:43:20] lest at any time meaning if they should
[1:43:23] if they should see with their eyes if
[1:43:25] they should hear with their ears you
[1:43:27] know and should understand with their
[1:43:29] heart and should be they then should be
[1:43:31] converted and I should heal them amen
[1:43:34] see and and you can't you can't heal a a
[1:43:38] synagogue of Satan you can't you can't
[1:43:40] save a synagogue of Satan amen that's
[1:43:42] what he's saying amen because if if they
[1:43:45] knew these things then they would be
[1:43:46] saved amen and um I continue it says uh
[1:43:50] but blessed are your eyes amen they see
[1:43:53] in your ears for they hear amen for
[1:43:56] verily I say unto you that many prophets
[1:43:58] and righteous men have desired to see
[1:44:01] these things see many really strong
[1:44:03] theologians have have have wanted to see
[1:44:05] these things amen and have not seen them
[1:44:08] and to hear those things which you hear
[1:44:10] and I've not heard them amen okay um now
[1:44:13] I like to continue in Revelations
[1:44:16] chapter 4 number three at 1961 brother
[1:44:20] brandham uh he says it's not ly great
[1:44:24] big uh it's uh he came to his own see he
[1:44:27] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[1:44:29] spirit say to the churches amen not to
[1:44:32] the outside to the church it's the
[1:44:34] church that get it shaking amen I used
[1:44:37] to think different from till that one
[1:44:39] day he spoke to me see this is Brother
[1:44:41] bam showing us humility in action amen
[1:44:44] he says I used to think different from
[1:44:46] that to one day he spoke to me and he
[1:44:49] made me go back in the word and think of
[1:44:51] how that the prophets all spoke of when
[1:44:53] John came when the high places would be
[1:44:55] made low when the Low Places may be made
[1:44:57] high and how the power of God would work
[1:45:00] and all the mountains would skipped by
[1:45:01] little Rams and the leaves would clap
[1:45:03] their hands well that looked like
[1:45:05] something that really was going to take
[1:45:07] place see amen and when it did what
[1:45:09] happened see people were expecting to
[1:45:11] see that I mean they were expecting to
[1:45:13] see he they were they were they were a a
[1:45:16] superficial looking at just the words
[1:45:18] and and that's why when Jesus came they
[1:45:20] missed him because they were looking at
[1:45:22] you know somebody to come great big on
[1:45:24] the cloud and to where everybody to see
[1:45:27] but he was born in the manger amen and
[1:45:29] they were looking for when John came for
[1:45:32] all these great things happen in nature
[1:45:35] but they didn't understand that you know
[1:45:37] there there's more than one side to a
[1:45:38] scripture amen there's a spiritual side
[1:45:40] there's many layers to the scripture
[1:45:41] amen so they they weren't looking at
[1:45:44] that amen and it continues and says um
[1:45:48] it says and when it did what happened an
[1:45:50] old fellow came out of the W wilderness
[1:45:53] probably a beard grown all out and an
[1:45:55] old piece of sheep skin wrapped around
[1:45:57] him amen there was no conveniences out
[1:45:59] there in the wilderness amen he been
[1:46:01] there since he was 9 years old and he
[1:46:03] was 30 then come walking I'm sorry come
[1:46:06] walking out of the Wilderness stumping
[1:46:08] out preaching repentance standing in mud
[1:46:11] to his knees probably on the banks of
[1:46:13] Jordan and that's when the high places
[1:46:14] were made low and the Low Places made
[1:46:16] High see amen then he says you have to
[1:46:20] have spiritual understanding remember
[1:46:22] God never did and never will on this
[1:46:24] Earth dwell in glamour amen so he's not
[1:46:27] going to come how you expect him to come
[1:46:30] amen he it's not always going to be you
[1:46:32] know uh this great big grandiose thing
[1:46:35] amen it's not always going to be that
[1:46:36] amen cuz that's not how it works amen
[1:46:39] and we know he's the same yesterday
[1:46:40] today and forever so if people miss him
[1:46:43] because they are looking at the great
[1:46:44] big things to happen people are going to
[1:46:46] miss him in this time because of the
[1:46:47] same thing amen and it reads um I'm
[1:46:50] going continue he says God God never did
[1:46:53] and never will on this Earth drawn
[1:46:55] grammar glamour I'm sorry he's against
[1:46:57] it he never uh the great messages never
[1:47:00] will be make great big so and so and so
[1:47:03] and so it it didn't do that way his
[1:47:06] servants don't work in that manner his
[1:47:08] Glamour and glories of above amen
[1:47:11] because that's that's why the scripture
[1:47:12] says you know God's ways are foolish to
[1:47:14] men and men's ways are foolish to God it
[1:47:18] it's not compatible amen how can you
[1:47:20] expect it to be compatible amen you
[1:47:22] can't expect you know a man to man's
[1:47:24] ways to be compatible with God's ways
[1:47:27] because is is God Amen you can't expect
[1:47:29] it to be that way amen and um and
[1:47:33] another uh uh uh scripture hit my heart
[1:47:37] when I was uh looking at the ear which
[1:47:39] was uh you know Faith cometh by hearing
[1:47:40] you know hearing the word of God Amen
[1:47:43] and I would like to um brother Brenham
[1:47:45] speaks on this Amen in the quote in the
[1:47:48] perseverance sir in
[1:47:50] 1963 amen he says if if I told you to go
[1:47:53] out and put your hand on that tree and
[1:47:55] be healed you could doubt that he says
[1:47:58] so why he said we have no background to
[1:48:00] anything amen You' only have my word
[1:48:03] amen and if I told you that washing a
[1:48:05] certain water out here in the valley
[1:48:07] would bring healing to you it would
[1:48:08] depend on how much confidence you had in
[1:48:10] me amen see and Faith cometh by hearing
[1:48:14] hearing what the word of God Amen and he
[1:48:18] said something very key he said that it
[1:48:20] would depend on how much confidence you
[1:48:22] had me amen see that's what it is amen
[1:48:25] you have to have confidence amen and
[1:48:27] what is that confidence amen that
[1:48:29] confidence is Faith amen so so if if if
[1:48:32] you don't have confidence in the word of
[1:48:34] God Amen don't expect anything to happen
[1:48:36] amen don't don't expect anything don't
[1:48:40] don't expect anything from it am me
[1:48:42] because you know you reap what you sow
[1:48:43] mean if you're not reaping Faith don't
[1:48:46] expect anything to come out of you amen
[1:48:49] amen and I want to continue it says um
[1:48:52] therefore this be the word of God and it
[1:48:54] is he says he says what it teaches we
[1:48:57] can rest upon it amen because God cannot
[1:49:00] change amen God must forever remain God
[1:49:04] Amen his word must be as true in this
[1:49:06] age as it ever was in any age amen and
[1:49:09] that's why we can apply the promises in
[1:49:12] the other Church ages to us as well Amen
[1:49:14] to where um I believe it I believe it
[1:49:17] was in the Samaran chch age when he says
[1:49:18] you won't taste of the second death amen
[1:49:21] we can apply that to us us because we
[1:49:23] know that you know we're Bound for a
[1:49:25] Rapture amen we won't taste him the
[1:49:27] second death so that promise applies to
[1:49:29] us as well because he's the same guy as
[1:49:31] he was back then amen and I like to
[1:49:35] continue it says um so why does a priest
[1:49:38] have to worry about his ear amen see a
[1:49:41] priest must watch what he listens to
[1:49:43] amen because it affects your faith amen
[1:49:46] because what you're feeding on it it
[1:49:49] gives you preconceived notions of things
[1:49:51] in your life amen it what you're feeding
[1:49:53] on is what you get comfortable with amen
[1:49:56] and and what you're feeding on ends up
[1:49:58] you know uh going into your conversation
[1:50:02] amen and and we know that we know that a
[1:50:06] priest amen because we know that we are
[1:50:08] priests we know that the word of God
[1:50:10] must always be on our mouth amen we know
[1:50:13] that we always have to be at to teach
[1:50:15] kind am men amen amen and um I want to
[1:50:18] go to Malachi 2 verse 7 amen amen
[1:50:27] Malachi 2 verse
[1:50:30] 7 when you get there say
[1:50:42] Amen Malachi 2 ver7
[1:50:55] all
[1:50:56] right amen it reads for the priest LPS
[1:51:00] should keep knowledge amen and what is
[1:51:02] that knowledge amen that's the knowledge
[1:51:04] of God Amen because if you go to a
[1:51:07] priest and you ask him a question that's
[1:51:09] like me going to brother Stephen and ask
[1:51:10] him a question he says I don't know that
[1:51:12] that just doesn't feel right amen you a
[1:51:15] priest should no amen you know what I'm
[1:51:19] saying amen so that's why so if if
[1:51:23] you're always feeding on the word amen
[1:51:27] then then you you'll know amen and and
[1:51:30] I'm not I'm not saying you may know the
[1:51:32] exact you know specific you very well
[1:51:35] may amen but the Lord will will direct
[1:51:38] you on how to answer the question amen
[1:51:40] because if you're if you're feeding on
[1:51:42] God Amen he'll give you wisdom amen and
[1:51:45] and we know that with wisdom being the
[1:51:48] main gift amen that and the next after
[1:51:51] that is what knowledge right after amen
[1:51:54] and we know that if you have wisdom you
[1:51:56] know how to use the knowledge that you
[1:51:58] have amen and and if you if you have
[1:52:04] that have that wisdom and we know we
[1:52:06] always try to say you know the major
[1:52:09] concern of a Believer is that you know I
[1:52:11] want to save other Souls amen I I want
[1:52:14] to bring other people in amen but what
[1:52:17] what are you saying you're saying that I
[1:52:19] don't have the wisdom to save them I
[1:52:21] don't have the way I don't know how to
[1:52:24] you know do this do that that's what
[1:52:25] you're saying amen and so the Lord says
[1:52:29] you have not because you ask not amen so
[1:52:31] what you want to do amen is is do what
[1:52:34] Solomon did and ask for wisdom amen and
[1:52:37] and what did he do amen he asked for it
[1:52:39] just obediently asked for it and what
[1:52:41] what happened he asked for the main
[1:52:43] thing and the lord gave him everything
[1:52:44] else amen so that's what we want to do
[1:52:47] amen amen so um I don't believe I finish
[1:52:49] reading it I want to go to uh 27 it says
[1:52:52] um verse two chapter 2: 7 it says for
[1:52:56] the priest's lips should keep knowledge
[1:52:59] and they should seek the law at his
[1:53:00] mouth amen so that's the feeding amen
[1:53:03] for he is the messenger of the Lord of
[1:53:05] hosts amen so we know um there's also a
[1:53:09] quote I wasn't able to find it but I
[1:53:12] know for fact it's a quote because I've
[1:53:13] read it amen and brother bam says that
[1:53:16] you know when you're sent out you know
[1:53:18] into the world Amen you Believer by
[1:53:20] yourself individual when you're sent out
[1:53:22] amen you are the preacher to those
[1:53:25] people you are the messenger to those
[1:53:28] people so when you're at work amen you
[1:53:31] are the messenger to those people of the
[1:53:33] of the message of the hour amen because
[1:53:36] how else would they know it amen amen so
[1:53:39] that that's what you are when you go out
[1:53:41] that's why you are the messenger it says
[1:53:44] it it reads you are the messenger of the
[1:53:46] Lord of hosts amen and what do we know
[1:53:49] that what the what does the Lord of
[1:53:50] hosts mean amen that's that's that's
[1:53:52] when uh that's the Lord of uh uh the the
[1:53:55] general of the army that's his army amen
[1:53:57] and we know that when we go out into the
[1:54:00] world Amen we're we're we're not
[1:54:02] fighting flesh amen we're fighting
[1:54:04] powers and principalities amen and power
[1:54:07] rulers in high places amen so so this is
[1:54:10] you know this is a lot lot in this one
[1:54:12] scripture you know it's saying that you
[1:54:14] know we're priests amen and when we go
[1:54:15] out you know we should already be
[1:54:17] equipped amen with with the weapon the
[1:54:19] sword of the word amen to be able to go
[1:54:22] out and you know as a messenger of the
[1:54:24] Lord of Lord of hosts what is saying is
[1:54:26] we're ambassadors amen we are the
[1:54:28] ambassador of the Lord of hosts we're
[1:54:29] ambassador of the Lord's army we go out
[1:54:32] because we're fighting you know powers
[1:54:33] in high places we're fighting these
[1:54:35] demons am me the virtues going out of us
[1:54:38] amen but you know if if if you don't
[1:54:40] have input there's no output to H for it
[1:54:43] to come out amen you know if if you're
[1:54:45] not um feeding amen what you you have no
[1:54:49] strength to do anything amen that that
[1:54:51] that that's simple biology Amen Brother
[1:54:53] D preached that to us amen if you're not
[1:54:55] eating what do you expect to happen amen
[1:54:57] amen and um and I want to continue now
[1:55:01] amen into the um uh uh the hands amen um
[1:55:06] we know that you know a hand signifies
[1:55:09] your Works amen we know uh signifies
[1:55:12] your actions things you do for the Lord
[1:55:14] amen and we know that uh we are not
[1:55:16] saved solely by our works though but you
[1:55:18] do know that still our actions reflect
[1:55:21] what you have faith in amen you know um
[1:55:24] you know your actions reflect you know
[1:55:26] your stand amen you know um you know we
[1:55:28] can't make ourselves saved you know um
[1:55:30] it was decided before the foundation of
[1:55:32] the world Amen but works is Faith
[1:55:35] expressed amen you know if if you you
[1:55:39] know if you're feeding amen and and and
[1:55:41] if you're you know always in the in the
[1:55:44] atmosphere of the Lord amen you know
[1:55:46] your actions will display that amen you
[1:55:49] know that's why you know the dumbest
[1:55:51] thing I've ever heard was when people
[1:55:52] say you know oh you know it's already
[1:55:54] decided anyway so I'm just to live my
[1:55:56] life how I want to that's very stupid
[1:55:58] they mean like what what are you saying
[1:56:00] mean I mean that's like saying that you
[1:56:03] know oh my my parents love me I'm going
[1:56:05] do whatever I want like that that don't
[1:56:07] even make sense I mean while while while
[1:56:09] if you love your parents you know you
[1:56:11] would you would show that you express
[1:56:13] that love to your parents amen so so
[1:56:16] that you know that remark just shows
[1:56:18] where they're stand in the first place
[1:56:19] amen and um I you know um there's also
[1:56:22] you know uh when I was coming up in high
[1:56:24] school amen um there was this this uh
[1:56:27] this quote I saw I believe it like on
[1:56:29] like the uh the hallway and I always
[1:56:32] look at it you know it says that uh your
[1:56:35] your decisions reflect your
[1:56:37] priorities and I always I always kept
[1:56:40] that in the back part of my mind when
[1:56:41] I'm always choosing to do something
[1:56:43] because that has scriptural backing amen
[1:56:46] so if something has scriptural backing
[1:56:48] amen you don't throw it away you know
[1:56:50] you use it amen for your benefit amen so
[1:56:53] every time a major decision was going on
[1:56:55] in my life or you know I'll always go
[1:56:57] back to my decision reflect my
[1:56:59] priorities am so what is my priority my
[1:57:02] priority you know as a Christian is
[1:57:04] first Christ amen and then after that is
[1:57:06] my well-being amen so you know because
[1:57:09] everybody has their you know personal
[1:57:11] morals and things like that amen so I
[1:57:13] would always make sure that my decisions
[1:57:15] reflect my priorities amen and U you
[1:57:18] know cuz you can tell a lot about a
[1:57:19] person by the decisions amen you know
[1:57:22] you can tell a lot about somebody who
[1:57:24] claims to be a Christian but then when
[1:57:26] you get around them and you get behind
[1:57:28] you know that that closed door and you
[1:57:30] know they're not in church no more you
[1:57:32] know their decisions and their actions
[1:57:34] start to they're against the word and
[1:57:36] you say well you know it it doesn't add
[1:57:39] up amen and um that's why you know I
[1:57:42] want to remember go back to our topic
[1:57:44] amen it's the blood and the oil that's
[1:57:46] applied amen see to the hand amen so
[1:57:49] went over the ear now on the hand amen
[1:57:52] now the uh the the uh oil on the hand
[1:57:56] and the blood on the hand amen you know
[1:57:58] you that's applying you know the the
[1:58:00] Holy Ghost amen um so I have to continue
[1:58:05] uh it says uh you know everything we
[1:58:06] must everything we do must be sh
[1:58:09] sanctioned by the Lord amen um because
[1:58:12] it must pass through the inspection amen
[1:58:15] see um because we know that brother bam
[1:58:17] uh taught us that you know there's a
[1:58:19] seal amen and um when you're going
[1:58:21] through inspection you know uh there's
[1:58:23] there's an expector and you know um your
[1:58:26] Works amen they can only be you know
[1:58:28] sanctioned amen if that seal is on it
[1:58:30] amen so what do I mean when I say that
[1:58:33] what I'm saying is you know when you um
[1:58:36] say somebody is um that's telling you a
[1:58:40] story or they're sick or something's
[1:58:42] going on with their family amen and you
[1:58:43] want to pray over them amen so you know
[1:58:46] that um most of the time you know we do
[1:58:48] nothing except the Lord show us in the
[1:58:50] first place amen so
[1:58:53] that's your sanctioning amen that's your
[1:58:55] sanction to act amen so if you don't
[1:58:58] have that sanction to act amen then you
[1:59:00] ought not to act amen you ought not to
[1:59:02] try to do God a service with it without
[1:59:05] with it not being the time to do it amen
[1:59:07] you don't want to go ahead of God amen
[1:59:10] amen so um in closing amen um in in
[1:59:15] closing um I'll have to say you know um
[1:59:17] uh Abraham's Faith was sanctioned by the
[1:59:20] Lord right amen and um because of this
[1:59:23] very fact amen and what I want to uh
[1:59:27] highlight on is you we know the story of
[1:59:29] him sacrificing his son amen and I
[1:59:33] believe it was a burnt offering the Lord
[1:59:35] told him to give amen and if you look at
[1:59:37] a burnt offering you know because of
[1:59:40] time uh because in a burnt offering amen
[1:59:44] you you're supposed to have oil and when
[1:59:46] you have a burnt offering amen and also
[1:59:49] we know blood is is already going to be
[1:59:51] there because because you're killing a
[1:59:53] lamb amen and so because of this you

[1:59:58] him the blood was about to be spilled
[2:00:00] amen and the Lord sanctioned his act

[2:00:41] in in Abraham amen so see now James said
[2:00:46] he's justified by his Works amen and
[2:00:49] Paul Paul said he's justified by faith
[2:00:53] his faith had
[2:00:54] Works see but see Abraham believed God
[2:00:58] that's what God saw in him he believed
[2:01:00] it amen but but then when he went to

[2:01:06] amen because what happened he said he
[2:01:08] said it we'll be back amen amen because
[2:01:11] so amen I'll continue he says he says
[2:01:13] that's what man saw in him amen and it
[2:01:16] continues he says and that's the same as
[2:01:19] it is to us amen because our works
[2:01:21] Express what faith we have amen but if

[2:07:34] Oh Glory to God if I read this scripture
[2:07:38] you will see more than this because I
[2:07:40] saw the scripture and I skip it and I
[2:07:43] left it alone and here he came and
[2:07:46] touched did you notice it's coming from
[2:07:48] Exodus 29 do you remember we touched CH
[2:07:51] so this 29 and I never touch that I skip
[2:07:54] it I deliberately avoid it because I
[2:07:58] know there was something there and here
[2:08:00] the Holy Spirit comes and touch it you
[2:08:02] will see even brother BR Ministry laying
[2:08:04] right
[2:08:07] here amen if I open it you want to go
[2:08:11] home so let me let you go home but it's
[2:08:14] right here you will see even the way
[2:08:16] brother Bram operate in his ministry it
[2:08:19] is locked inside the scripture
[2:08:22] because remember he read Exodus 29 that
[2:08:26] was the
[2:08:27] priest are we together but where he read
[2:08:30] in Leviticus that was not the
[2:08:37] priest
[2:08:39] sorry sister Olivia should I tell
[2:08:42] [Laughter]
[2:08:46] them
[2:08:48] uh open Leviticus 14 before somebody
[2:08:52] starts shooting me text in the
[2:08:55] morning open Leviticus
[2:08:58] 14 oh boy oh boy boy
[2:09:01] boy
[2:09:04] amen he read Exodus 29 Exodus 29 it's
[2:09:09] clearly the consecration of a priest
[2:09:11] when you're consecrating the priest you
[2:09:13] take the blood and the oil you mix it
[2:09:16] together you put it on the ear of the
[2:09:18] priest and you put it on the thumb and
[2:09:19] you put it on the foot that I was the
[2:09:22] priest amen look at Leviticus 14 because
[2:09:25] he read Leviticus 14 down the road but
[2:09:28] go back to verse one I'm going to let
[2:09:30] you
[2:09:32] go amen amen if you dare you can say
[2:09:39] Amen are we together now we
[2:09:43] together verse one and the Lord spake
[2:09:47] unto Moses saying this shall be the law
[2:09:52] of the
[2:09:55] leper in the day of his what so the
[2:09:59] cleansing of a
[2:10:02] leper had the same application as the
[2:10:05] hallowing or the consecration of the
[2:10:10] priest now you see now I just told you
[2:10:13] amen so Exodus 29 was the priesthood
[2:10:17] being anointed amen but the leper
[2:10:21] brother BR say leprosy it's a type of
[2:10:24] sin right so when The Sinner
[2:10:27] comes so the ministry have to be
[2:10:29] anointed
[2:10:30] first
[2:10:32] ah now you start pulling amen the
[2:10:36] ministry have to be anointed first and
[2:10:39] the ministry there is two type of a
[2:10:44] Ministry come on there is a fivefold
[2:10:48] Ministry amen but there is also a priest
[2:10:51] of a messenger of the age yes
[2:10:55] sir sir are we together are we together
[2:10:58] are we together that's why brother Bram
[2:11:00] say the light come through the messenger
[2:11:02] first and then from the messenger the
[2:11:05] light will go through others that have
[2:11:07] been Faithfully taught five for Ministry
[2:11:11] but they must be Faithfully taught am
[2:11:14] amen that's why you have the high priest
[2:11:18] and the priest together that are
[2:11:20] anointed did in the same way and brother
[2:11:23] Bram in one way he said the high priest
[2:11:25] is the
[2:11:29] messenger are we together and God give
[2:11:31] him the access to the Mana brother Bram
[2:11:34] said because the Mana is the food that
[2:11:37] he can feed
[2:11:38] [Applause]
[2:11:41] others have I lost
[2:11:45] you do you have time or
[2:11:48] [Applause]
[2:11:50] not okay somebody don't want it do you
[2:11:52] have time
[2:11:53] [Applause]
[2:11:54] [Music]
[2:11:58] on you blame brother Charles that's
[2:12:03] right are we together are we together
[2:12:08] exod all of these came when I was
[2:12:10] sitting right there listening to
[2:12:13] him amen all right Exodus 29 is the
[2:12:18] consecration of the priest amen yes but
[2:12:21] there is two division in the priest we
[2:12:24] have the high priest amen and we have
[2:12:28] also the priest plural all the high
[2:12:32] priest and the priest both of them are
[2:12:35] we together need to be Anointed with oil
[2:12:39] and with blood and they apply that on
[2:12:42] the ear on the T and on the foot are we
[2:12:46] together so the high priest here is a
[2:12:49] messenger yes to your
[2:12:52] age are we together and the priest here
[2:12:56] is the far for
[2:12:58] Ministry GL are we together are we
[2:13:02] together are we together so no priest
[2:13:04] can preach the gospel without being
[2:13:09] saved I'm going to go slowly because
[2:13:12] these things are coming up now you
[2:13:14] whoever oliv open the pipe or something
[2:13:16] are we together a priest is born a
[2:13:20] priest amen but even though you are born
[2:13:23] a priest you cannot enter the work
[2:13:27] without being consecrated your gift as
[2:13:30] of a Ministry you are born with it but
[2:13:33] before you express or you work or you
[2:13:36] put yourself on the work of the Lord you
[2:13:39] must be saved by the blood and also
[2:13:42] filled by the Holy Spirit you must have
[2:13:45] the blood and the oil applied to you are
[2:13:48] we together because brother Bram was
[2:13:52] and brother Bram was filled with the
[2:13:54] holy spirit so the high priest problem
[2:13:56] was already done the problem is the far
[2:13:59] for Ministry we need to make sure they
[2:14:01] are saved and they are also filled with
[2:14:04] the holy spirit because brother brand
[2:14:07] I'm saying no one can stand behind the
[2:14:09] pulit if you have never met the pillar
[2:14:12] of
[2:14:14] fire are we together are we together are
[2:14:18] we together so the blood
[2:14:23] amen and the oil amen must be applied to
[2:14:27] both the high priest and it must be
[2:14:30] applied also to the priest are we
[2:14:32] together but on Leviticus now 14 it's no
[2:14:37] longer the priest now the priest is
[2:14:41] consecrated the high priest is
[2:14:43] consecrated now the priest and the high
[2:14:45] priest they can now exert the ministry
[2:14:49] to save the leop
[2:14:51] to save The Sinner because let proceed
[2:14:54] sin now they can apply the same faith
[2:14:58] upon the
[2:14:59] sinners now they can bring the same
[2:15:01] gospel to The Sinner which gospel the
[2:15:04] gospel of blood and oil we preaching
[2:15:08] salvation and the baptism of the Holy
[2:15:11] Spirit are we together are we
[2:15:19] together job to verse 25 I'm going to
[2:15:22] let you go home my friend jum to verse
[2:15:24] 25 of Leviticus 14 it's about the leper
[2:15:29] now the leper the leper leprosy tap sin
[2:15:33] we went through this before now this is
[2:15:36] to The Sinner are we together but watch
[2:15:39] The Sinner also is Anointed the same
[2:15:43] way amen the sin also receive blood in
[2:15:46] the ear to him that have an ear so you
[2:15:50] have an ear but that year need to be
[2:15:52] saved and then that year need to be
[2:15:54] anointed by the holy spirit so that you
[2:15:57] can have the hearing of Faith are we
[2:16:00] together are we
[2:16:03] together do you know that the Bible said
[2:16:06] the God have uh prepar us for work do
[2:16:10] you remember in Ephesian that he he
[2:16:13] already predestinated us unto good works
[2:16:16] before the foundation of the world so
[2:16:18] your Works was already there but it need
[2:16:20] to to be anointed you need to be Sav and
[2:16:23] anointed then the anointing activate the
[2:16:26] Divine work of God in your life then
[2:16:29] your work change are we together let's
[2:16:32] go to verse 25 I'm going to let you go
[2:16:34] home if you thereare you can say
[2:16:38] amen and he shall
[2:16:41] kill remember the priest they killed the
[2:16:44] ram look at this and he shall kill the
[2:16:49] lamb both of them are the same right but
[2:16:52] one is a mature
[2:16:53] one and he shall kill the Lamb of the
[2:16:56] trespass offering and the priest shall
[2:17:00] take some of the blood of the trespass
[2:17:03] offering and put it upon the tip of the
[2:17:05] right ear of him that is to be
[2:17:09] cleansed are we together are we
[2:17:13] together let me leave it amen and upon
[2:17:16] the T of his right hand if you notice
[2:17:19] everything goes to the the right hand am
[2:17:22] for some reason because even Jesus when
[2:17:25] he went he went to the right hand of God

[2:18:16] hand had the discernment of brother Bram
[2:18:22] are we together which hand had the
[2:18:25] discernment of brother Bram why did
[2:18:27] Brother Bram discernment was on the left
[2:18:29] hand because the Holy Spirit was using
[2:18:32] the left hand to discern sickness and
[2:18:35] send vibration and the vibration from
[2:18:38] Brother Bram will neutralize the
[2:18:41] sickness and tell you that you were you
[2:18:44] were completely here it was the oil upon

[2:20:44] the true cleansing will cleanse your
[2:20:47] earring you won't hear this gospel the
[2:20:49] same way like before this message will
[2:20:52] become a new music a new tune a new book
[2:20:57] because your ears has been open up why
[2:21:00] because your ear has been saved and now
[2:21:03] you are hearing by Revelation and your
[2:21:06] action your hands is going by Revelation
[2:21:09] and everywhere you going with your foot
[2:21:11] when you put your foot footprint means
[2:21:13] possession you are getting into ground
[2:21:16] everything is working together for good
[2:21:19] are we together are we
[2:21:24] together God richly bless you let's
[2:21:27] stand so we can pray we don't want to go
[2:21:30] too
[2:21:33] far this scripture is powerful my
[2:21:37] friend I don't know how you're going to
[2:21:39] preach this in one sermon
[2:21:43] amen but he did
[2:21:46] good to stop where you got to stop
[2:21:49] because it's absolutely
[2:21:51] impossible to preach this in one day we
[2:21:54] did this quickly but if we sit down and
[2:21:57] we go
[2:21:58] slowly that's
[2:22:00] it you will forget the five Garment of
[2:22:03] Joseph who will be somewhere again deep
[2:22:05] into something amen it's just showing
[2:22:09] you that this work of redemption is
[2:22:12] perfectly in line the enemy is
[2:22:15] multiplying his attack to discredit the
[2:22:19] message to discredit credit brother
[2:22:21] Branham to try to pull young people and
[2:22:24] people away from the message he put
[2:22:27] pressure on Minister not to read the
[2:22:29] quote anymore until preacher are even
[2:22:32] uncomfortable Pastor uncomfortable with
[2:22:35] the message
[2:22:38] amen this message we not following
[2:22:42] caringly devis Fable made by
[2:22:46] men I don't know when people read the
[2:22:49] message what where they read reading
[2:22:51] when I was reading the message I was
[2:22:54] amazed when I was new in the message I
[2:22:57] say how can this man be so accurate with
[2:23:01] the scripture like this that's what the
[2:23:05] me that that's the way the message was
[2:23:07] coming to
[2:23:10] me and the more I read brother BR the
[2:23:13] more I begin to respect my
[2:23:16] Bible I don't even tolerate somebody to
[2:23:19] put a key on the
[2:23:22] Bible because I see people when they
[2:23:24] bring their Bible they put it in a key
[2:23:26] or cell phone is there I don't tolerate
[2:23:28] even that because of what brother
[2:23:30] brandham taught me no one taught me to
[2:23:33] be to to to to to be so in
[2:23:36] love and respect the scripture like
[2:23:38] brother Bram so I don't know what they
[2:23:41] talking
[2:23:44] about but if it was not for
[2:23:48] you if you were not predestined ated for
[2:23:51] it it's not going to work for you but as
[2:23:54] for me and my house
[2:23:57] Hallelujah and this
[2:23:59] church we already signed the contract my
[2:24:02] friend I ain't going

[2:24:16] am brother Bram say this brother Bram
[2:24:18] say this brother Bram want contradict
[2:24:21] himself it is you that contradict
[2:24:24] yourself in your own mind if you let the
[2:24:26] oil of the spirit of God to come into it
[2:24:30] you will see the two Cod
[2:24:32] reconciling together and bringing and
[2:24:34] shedding more light and before you know
[2:24:37] it the message has a continuity
[2:24:39] everything is dove telling and entering
[2:24:42] in the scripture and it's so
[2:24:45] beautiful and I don't see any area in
[2:24:48] our life that the message doesn't affect
[2:24:51] I don't see it I don't see even things
[2:24:54] that I never thought I say how am I
[2:24:56] going to answer this before you know it
[2:24:57] a come before you know it the scripture
[2:25:00] come before you know it here brother

[2:25:03] sometime will say one thing and that one
[2:25:05] thing can be apply to 10 area if you can
[2:25:08] catch the spirit of the
[2:25:15] Lord stop listening to the
[2:25:18] craziness on What's happen
[2:25:21] the craziness

[2:25:26] friend if I ever hear
[2:25:30] you that you left this message or you

[2:25:45] that from the church we left I never
[2:25:48] have any time to go sit and watch the
[2:25:50] Exposition that they gave I don't have
[2:25:52] time my time is so precious that I need
[2:25:56] more time to invest in the Bible in the
[2:25:59] message than to listen to
