[47:21] amen
[47:22] blessed be the name of the lord let's go
[47:24] to our scripture this morning
[47:26] what i have is very loaded
[47:29] so i don't know how far i'm going to go
[47:31] i tried last week i could not even get
[47:34] to a third of the sermon
[47:36] because of the seal evidence and the
[47:38] open evidence but at least somebody
[47:41] really gathered
[47:42] the seal evidence and the open the bible
[47:44] is open is written it's a double bible
[47:48] it's one bible but it's double
[47:50] amen there is a written part of the
[47:53] bible and there is an unwritten part of
[47:55] the rubble
[47:56] amen
[47:57] it is one sword but it's double
[48:00] it's double age amen it's one evidence
[48:03] but it's double
[48:06] amen
[48:07] it is 24 stone it's still 12 12. but the
[48:11] double
[48:12] one have to be inside jordan and the
[48:15] other one outside jordan and before you
[48:17] can take the rapture
[48:20] before elijah take the rapture he must
[48:23] see not the open
[48:25] you need the inside evidence
[48:28] because the inside will give you
[48:30] rapturing faith
[48:33] without that
[48:34] even though the new elijah have to cross
[48:37] elijah have to go yes the lord is taking
[48:39] up elijah but before elijah be taken up
[48:42] he have to see the seal evidence
[48:45] amen when he see the seal evidence then
[48:47] he gives you rupturing faith
[48:49] then on the other side you can go
[48:53] everybody okay
[48:54] glory to god if you miss it you need to
[48:57] go back and sit and review and review
[49:00] and review if you clearly notice you're
[49:03] getting two sermons on sunday
[49:09] i don't know if you already caught that
[49:11] if you think you're getting one sermon
[49:13] you're not
[49:16] [Laughter]
[49:18] genesis chapter 2
[49:20] at least you're doing good even though
[49:22] we're missing some people
[49:24] so i'm happy
[49:25] genesis chapter 2
[49:27] i have to
[49:28] go back again to the same scripture
[49:30] because i can't i could not even touch
[49:32] the surface
[49:34] so hopefully
[49:36] let's see how far we can go
[49:38] i was planning on getting wednesday to
[49:40] push the butt we got brother nikki from
[49:43] south africa it's missionary season
[49:46] there are brother coming up so i have to
[49:48] give a little space
[49:50] so you can enjoy other ministries amen
[49:54] genesis chapter 2 if you dare you can
[49:56] say amen
[49:58] and i will let you sit
[50:02] glory to god
[50:04] genesis chapter 2 verse 20.
[50:08] amen
[50:10] the bible says and adam
[50:12] gave names to all caddo
[50:20] you might be seated that's the problem
[50:22] you start unfolding now
[50:24] amen
[50:27] and adam gave name to all cattle
[50:30] and to the fowl of the air and to every
[50:33] water
[50:36] so adam is the one that called the
[50:38] serpent serpent
[50:41] everybody okay
[50:43] amen amen okay
[50:46] but for adam there was not found a help
[50:50] made for him
[50:52] something that is very suitable for him
[50:54] and the lord god caused a deep
[50:57] sleep to fall upon adam and he slept
[51:01] he didn't die
[51:05] he slept
[51:06] amen and he took one of his ribs not two
[51:14] how many ribs
[51:15] [Music]
[51:19] let me keep moving
[51:21] and close up the flesh instead thereof
[51:24] everybody okay
[51:26] and the rib which the lord god has taken
[51:29] from adam or from man
[51:32] made here
[51:34] not
[51:34] even
[51:36] that's right
[51:37] amen you need to keep your bible today
[51:40] he didn't make eve he made
[51:43] a woman ever care and brought her to the
[51:46] man that's what happened in marriage
[51:48] and adam say this is now born of my
[51:52] bones
[51:53] and flesh of my flesh she shall be
[51:55] called uh
[51:57] who gave the name to all the beast and
[51:59] caddo
[52:00] who gave the name to the woman
[52:02] so every species will name my adam
[52:07] so adam
[52:09] name
[52:10] the beast
[52:12] the caddo and everything
[52:14] and then adam also
[52:17] name
[52:18] his help
[52:20] which is a woman
[52:23] and when we talk about the beast we are
[52:25] specific here because we're dealing with
[52:28] the serpent
[52:29] amen
[52:31] hallelujah
[52:33] because she was taken out of a man out
[52:36] of man we will handle this down the road
[52:40] therefore shall man leave his father
[52:44] and he is
[52:46] who is the father of adam
[52:51] and shall cling to his wife
[52:54] and there shall be
[52:56] one flesh
[52:58] they were both naked and the man and his
[53:00] wife and were not ashamed lord help me
[53:03] to get to that
[53:05] go to chapter three
[53:08] it's beautiful when you navigate this
[53:11] all the scripture lining up together
[53:13] straight from genesis all the way
[53:16] amen amen verse 3 now the serpent
[53:20] was more subtle
[53:22] so according to the scripture
[53:25] the serpent the first characteristic is
[53:28] that the serpent was more subtle
[53:32] what does he mean sado
[53:38] it's more than that
[53:40] amen
[53:41] the serpent was more subtle
[53:45] than any beast
[53:47] more subtle than any beast
[53:51] in other words the category
[53:54] of the serpent
[53:55] is
[53:56] in the category of the beast
[54:00] amen they didn't say he was more sadder
[54:03] than the than the fishes
[54:05] they didn't say he was more sadder than
[54:07] the fowl of the air amen they say he was
[54:11] more subtle
[54:12] than the beast and any beast of the
[54:15] field which the lord god has made
[54:19] and he said to ever
[54:25] so there is a
[54:27] going on something going on
[54:30] between the serpent
[54:32] which was a beast
[54:34] and a woman
[54:39] there is an interaction between the
[54:41] woman and the beast
[54:52] [Applause]
[54:55] for young people beauty and the beast
[54:59] you think they put it up like that
[55:02] for games
[55:06] and he said to the woman
[55:09] yeah has god say you shall not eat of
[55:13] every tree of the garden everybody
[55:16] jump to verse 13
[55:19] one service relax
[55:21] get your bible because we're gonna get
[55:23] deep amen
[55:25] and he's gonna answer a lot of question
[55:28] verse 13 if you're there you can say
[55:30] amen
[55:31] and the lord god say to the woman
[55:35] not eve
[55:36] what is this that you have done
[55:39] and the woman say
[55:41] the serpent begot me everybody
[55:45] and i did eat
[55:48] not the snake
[55:50] the serpent everybody
[55:53] and the lord god said to the serpent
[55:57] because you have done this
[55:59] you are cursed
[56:01] above every water
[56:03] he didn't say above every fowl
[56:06] or above every fishes
[56:09] it's the characteristic of it
[56:11] the serpent is among the animal that is
[56:14] under i'm going like this so our
[56:18] children understand where the serpent
[56:20] seed comes from
[56:22] amen
[56:24] everybody here
[56:25] without any question
[56:27] because there are people in the message
[56:28] for years they don't understand things
[56:30] [Music]
[56:32] amen
[56:34] above all the cuddle and above every
[56:36] what
[56:38] of the
[56:39] you don't see them putting them under
[56:41] the creeping things or with the foul
[56:45] that's the characteristic of the that's
[56:47] the category of the serpent
[56:49] and above every beast of the field
[56:52] upon your belly now it's a different
[56:54] thing
[56:55] so the serpent was not walking upon his
[56:58] belly before so the serpent was an
[57:01] upright creature
[57:02] you cannot put somebody on the belly if
[57:05] they were already on the belly
[57:09] is that okay i'm going clearly so we
[57:12] don't have any question
[57:14] anybody here if somebody is already on
[57:16] the belly how do you put them on the
[57:17] belly
[57:20] for you to drop somebody in the belly
[57:22] that person must have been
[57:24] upright and brother branham when he say
[57:27] these things he never even give
[57:29] scripture he just let you go with it
[57:32] amen
[57:33] that's why the message is perfectly
[57:36] in line with the scripture perfectly
[57:41] not almost
[57:42] perfectly
[57:46] i'm not talking about your grammar
[57:51] [Music]
[58:02] amen
[58:04] he said upon your belly shall you go
[58:07] and that's how you eat all the days of
[58:10] your life so right here we understand
[58:13] that the serpent was an upright creature
[58:20] amen but the curse
[58:23] turn him into a snake
[58:27] that's the curse
[58:30] amen
[58:31] it is clear
[58:32] hallelujah
[58:34] verse 15. and i will put enmity
[58:39] who's going to put in meeting
[58:41] remember that i hope i can get away i'm
[58:44] going to go
[58:45] i will put in metroid
[58:48] between you who who is you
[58:51] the serpent and the water
[58:54] so there is wall from eden
[58:56] [Music]
[58:58] everybody okay
[59:00] everybody okay now
[59:02] everybody okay the word from eden is
[59:05] between the woman and the serpent
[59:10] [Music]
[59:12] okay
[59:13] i wish i can have my time to drop there
[59:17] so there is war
[59:19] that started in eden
[59:21] in genesis
[59:24] so in genesis
[59:27] precisely in eden
[59:30] amen war or enmity
[59:35] amen amen
[59:37] started between the serpent
[59:42] amen
[59:43] and the water
[59:49] we okay now amen
[59:51] if you keep that now you can see it all
[59:53] over the scripture
[59:55] that's right amen
[59:59] everybody okay
[1:00:01] and
[1:00:04] between
[1:00:05] your seed the seed of who
[1:00:10] the seed of who
[1:00:12] so when brother branham says serpent
[1:00:14] seed is that a problem
[1:00:20] it's not a problem
[1:00:22] do you read your bible or not do people
[1:00:25] read the bible
[1:00:27] the serpent has a seed
[1:00:31] i'm not saying brother branham say i'm
[1:00:33] saying the bible say before i put
[1:00:35] brother brother because what branham is
[1:00:37] already lining up with the bible
[1:00:42] gonna put in mitui between you
[1:00:44] and the woman and between your seed and
[1:00:49] so the woman has a seed
[1:00:56] the reason why you're reacting like that
[1:00:58] you are reasoning
[1:01:00] let's repeat what the bible says let's
[1:01:02] go back to the bible
[1:01:04] back to the bible
[1:01:06] back to the bible the bible said the
[1:01:08] woman has a seed
[1:01:11] does a woman ever have a seed
[1:01:16] please repeat with me let's read it
[1:01:17] together
[1:01:20] do you see now
[1:01:22] do you see now
[1:01:25] like i was asking a sister i said what
[1:01:26] do you see she say i'm i'm overthinking
[1:01:28] i said you don't want to accept i just
[1:01:30] say what you see in the scripture
[1:01:33] it's the second oil buddy
[1:01:36] amen let's read it again
[1:01:40] between your seed
[1:01:42] and her
[1:01:44] seed so the woman has a seed
[1:01:48] how can a woman have a seed
[1:02:00] so war is between the serpent
[1:02:03] and between the water and the serpent
[1:02:07] has a seed
[1:02:09] everybody and the woman also has a seed
[1:02:14] but we know women don't have seed
[1:02:22] you see now
[1:02:24] this message
[1:02:26] is beautiful
[1:02:29] and
[1:02:31] you there
[1:02:32] he shall bruise
[1:02:34] your head

[1:02:48] and you'll see the seed of the woman
[1:02:50] will bruise your head
[1:02:54] everybody here
[1:02:56] if you look he say your head
[1:03:11] it's a personal pronoun
[1:03:16] your head
[1:03:18] so this seed of the woman
[1:03:20] when he attacked
[1:03:22] he attacked the head
[1:03:27] amen but here the attack of the seed of
[1:03:30] the woman he always attacked the head
[1:03:36] are we okay
[1:03:38] are we okay
[1:03:39] are we okay
[1:03:41] amen when david met goliath
[1:03:48] we okay now
[1:03:49] when he look at goliath
[1:03:52] he never say i'm gonna catch your arm
[1:03:56] he never said i'm gonna catch your foot
[1:03:59] he said i'm gonna catch you
[1:04:01] why did he always attack the head
[1:04:03] [Music]
[1:04:08] you need to know the origin of david
[1:04:12] amen and when he took the slingshot
[1:04:15] he targeted the head
[1:04:18] because the seed of the woman usually
[1:04:21] attacked the head
[1:04:23] they don't go in the back
[1:04:28] they are not afraid
[1:04:30] they go through head collision
[1:04:33] [Music]
[1:04:39] oh glory to god
[1:04:41] see what i told you i was in honey
[1:04:45] amen
[1:04:46] and
[1:04:47] it shall bruise your head
[1:04:50] and you
[1:04:51] shall bruise his water
[1:04:55] he's here
[1:04:57] so it's a man
[1:05:01] hey please let's go back
[1:05:04] let's go back
[1:05:06] he shall bruise your head and you shall
[1:05:09] bruise water
[1:05:11] so his is who
[1:05:16] the seed of the woman is he is
[1:05:20] so the woman have a male seed
[1:05:25] [Music]
[1:05:26] where did she get it
[1:05:27] [Music]
[1:05:32] this one attacked the water
[1:05:42] amen where was wolf sleeping
[1:05:50] everybody okay
[1:05:51] everybody okay why is he having defeat
[1:05:54] like brass
[1:05:55] [Music]
[1:05:58] but in revelation 10 they are pillars of
[1:06:00] fire
[1:06:04] can a snake touch the fire
[1:06:10] amen
[1:06:12] everybody okay amen
[1:06:13] [Laughter]
[1:06:15] let's go to leviticus 24.
[1:06:20] and i want to remind you on 20 the bible
[1:06:23] called eve the mother of what
[1:06:25] all the living
[1:06:29] amen eve means the mother of what all
[1:06:32] the living
[1:06:33] i love this quote in this point brother
[1:06:36] branham say
[1:06:38] scripture does not play with word
[1:06:42] amen
[1:06:44] amen amen whatever is in the record is
[1:06:48] there for the anointed eye
[1:06:52] to see
[1:06:53] it is there for uh
[1:06:57] genesis 3 20 and adam called his wife
[1:07:00] now or his wife named eve because she
[1:07:03] was the mother of all living but no
[1:07:05] scripture ever said that adam is the
[1:07:08] father of all living why
[1:07:17] let's go to leviticus
[1:07:19] glory to god
[1:07:22] leviticus 24 1
[1:07:24] and the lord spoke to moses saying
[1:07:27] command the children of israel
[1:07:30] that they bring
[1:07:32] to you pure water
[1:07:34] olive oil
[1:07:36] beaten
[1:07:38] for the light
[1:07:41] amen
[1:07:42] to close the lamps
[1:07:47] it's the light
[1:07:48] that light is the candlestick
[1:07:50] and the candlestick have lamps
[1:07:53] that's why brother bottom say the
[1:07:55] correct name should be called lamp stand
[1:07:57] not candlestick it's right here brother
[1:08:00] brother didn't give you that scripture
[1:08:01] it's right here
[1:08:03] amen
[1:08:04] and to cause their lamps remember the
[1:08:07] foolish virgin also had lamps to cause
[1:08:10] the lamps to burn out
[1:08:13] so to the fire that was going on the
[1:08:16] candlestick was coming from the pillar
[1:08:18] of fire
[1:08:19] we know that amen but to keep the fire
[1:08:22] burning it's the uh it's the it's the
[1:08:25] responsibility of the priest to continue
[1:08:28] to put oil all the time everybody here
[1:08:32] verse three outside the veil of the
[1:08:35] testimony or where the ark is which is
[1:08:37] the holy place outside the veil outside
[1:08:40] the holy the holiest now you are in the
[1:08:43] holy place where the candlestick was
[1:08:45] amen outside the veil of the testimony
[1:08:48] the testimony here means the ark
[1:08:51] in the tabernacle of the congregation
[1:08:54] shall aaron order it from the evening
[1:08:57] not from the morning to the evening he
[1:09:00] started from the evening if you go the
[1:09:02] lord created the evening and the morning
[1:09:04] not the morning and the evening
[1:09:06] so the evening have something
[1:09:08] the way you start not morning evening
[1:09:10] you start from the evening tomorrow
[1:09:11] morning
[1:09:13] you will see that in a numbering amen
[1:09:17] from evening to the morning before the
[1:09:19] lord continually
[1:09:21] and it shall be a statute forever
[1:09:25] in your generation
[1:09:27] he shall order their lamps it's plural
[1:09:30] because there is seven lamps
[1:09:32] in one light one candlestick everybody
[1:09:35] okay
[1:09:36] he shall order the lamps upon the pure
[1:09:40] candlestick everybody clear now
[1:09:43] so what you have in the candlestick is
[1:09:45] seven lamps that are combined together
[1:09:49] into one
[1:09:50] light
[1:09:51] everybody here and he shall order the
[1:09:54] lamps upon the pure candlestick before
[1:09:56] the lord how continually in other words
[1:09:59] the responsibility
[1:10:01] to keep the candlestick burning all the
[1:10:04] time
[1:10:05] belongs to the priest
[1:10:07] anybody here
[1:10:09] and if the priests neglect
[1:10:14] to put oil what happened to the lamp
[1:10:18] everybody okay now
[1:10:20] praise god so the going out of the lamp
[1:10:24] is a negligence of the
[1:10:28] priest amen we okay now
[1:10:31] we okay now
[1:10:32] we okay amen let's go to uh
[1:10:36] daniel chapter 12.

[1:11:41] scatter the power of the holy people

[1:13:34] water
[1:13:35] so how can you be white without the
[1:13:38] breaking of the seal
[1:13:40] to unfold the sealed word
[1:13:44] because this word is not
[1:13:46] written it is sealed
[1:13:49] the bible has a written word and the
[1:13:51] word that was now written the word that
[1:13:53] was now written was sealed
[1:13:56] the sealed evidence
[1:13:58] amen
[1:13:59] and made white and do what try
[1:14:03] but the wicked shall do
[1:14:06] wickedly who is the wicked
[1:14:09] and none of the wicked shall

[1:14:26] but here so the one who understand must
[1:14:29] have the second oil

[1:14:38] understand everybody clear
[1:14:40] let's pray heavenly father

[1:14:47] your grace your love your mercy and for

[1:15:00] to unfold and to minister to your
[1:15:02] children father he only take a
[1:15:05] supernatural action of the holy spirit
[1:15:08] father may you move humanity and human

[1:15:26] speak to your brother and father bless
[1:15:29] them this morning as we humbly ask it
[1:15:31] father in the name of jesus christ
[1:15:35] amen
[1:15:36] i'm going to read one more scripture
[1:15:38] quickly it's in revelation 10. the bible
[1:15:40] says and i saw another marty angel came
[1:15:43] down from heaven clove with a cloud do
[1:15:46] you know what it means and a rainbow
[1:15:48] upon his head you know what it means
[1:15:50] but we will come back to this down the
[1:15:52] road and his face was as he wear the sun
[1:15:55] you know what he means
[1:15:56] and his feet
[1:15:58] as pillars of fire
[1:16:01] everybody
[1:16:02] and he had in his hand a little book
[1:16:04] open
[1:16:05] and he set his right foot that looked
[1:16:08] like pillar of fire upon the sea
[1:16:11] and he set his left foot upon the earth
[1:16:15] amen
[1:16:16] number one
[1:16:18] he set the two feet one upon the earth
[1:16:21] one upon the sea
[1:16:22] then he didn't stop there
[1:16:25] anybody okay
[1:16:26] when the two feet are positionally
[1:16:29] placed
[1:16:30] then he releases the thunders
[1:16:35] you can read the scripture over and over
[1:16:37] and he keeps opening up
[1:16:39] here he never spoke the thunders
[1:16:42] until he positionally placed his feet
[1:16:46] a certain way
[1:16:47] amen when he placed his feet
[1:16:50] then he cried then they shout
[1:16:55] comes everybody here
[1:16:57] and with a loud voice as when the lion
[1:16:59] roared and when he cried seven thunders
[1:17:02] under their voices my subject this
[1:17:05] morning
[1:17:06] is what we could not get last sunday
[1:17:09] it is the four faces of roof
[1:17:12] the second oil and the beast
[1:17:15] when we're dealing with the second oil
[1:17:17] we already seen that the virgin
[1:17:20] have two containers there was one
[1:17:22] container that one reservoir that was
[1:17:25] already in the lamp
[1:17:27] and that was already burning with oil
[1:17:30] but the emphasize is not on the first
[1:17:32] reservoir but it's on the refilling oil
[1:17:36] that was kept until the coming of the
[1:17:38] broad group
[1:17:39] everybody okay so far blessed be the
[1:17:42] name of the lord in our tabernacle
[1:17:44] language
[1:17:46] we are on the threshing floor with roof
[1:17:48] and roof is in the holy place
[1:17:51] this is very important
[1:17:53] brother sam gave me this quote but what
[1:17:55] i'm saying
[1:17:57] this story of ruth was written
[1:18:00] and all the old manuscript the old
[1:18:03] testament stories or books
[1:18:05] when they were segregating the bible
[1:18:08] when they were putting the bible
[1:18:09] together
[1:18:10] the holy men
[1:18:12] when they were trying to put it together
[1:18:15] in the old testament
[1:18:17] this book of roof
[1:18:19] was one of the outstanding books
[1:18:22] that they accepted
[1:18:25] so it was not an easy book to put in the
[1:18:27] bible
[1:18:28] [Music]
[1:18:29] when the people were putting the bible
[1:18:32] together when they look at the book of
[1:18:34] roof it seems so strange
[1:18:40] everybody here
[1:18:41] because moses you can easily see god
[1:18:44] coming the law and everything if you
[1:18:46] look in the book of roof there is no
[1:18:49] angel
[1:18:49] [Music]
[1:18:52] anybody here it doesn't say an angel
[1:18:55] came down
[1:18:57] it's like a love story
[1:18:59] but for some reason every time they want

[1:22:23] see today happening in the news
[1:22:26] by god's grace
[1:22:27] [Music]
[1:22:28] it is everyone
[1:22:31] written in water
[1:22:35] where he had its beginning back there
[1:22:39] and it just got another
[1:22:42] so what you might call today something
[1:22:46] in the scripture it is there
[1:22:48] it is only written in a different name
[1:22:52] than what you call it today
[1:22:56] everybody here
[1:22:57] but how do i know it's the same thing
[1:23:01] brother bonham say you watch
[1:23:03] the working of the spirit
[1:23:06] in that day
[1:23:09] in other words every spirit
[1:23:12] is known by each characteristic
[1:23:18] in other words a tree is known by its
[1:23:20] fruit
[1:23:23] anybody okay
[1:23:25] blessed be the name of the lord he said
[1:23:27] you watch
[1:23:29] the working of the spirit in that day
[1:23:31] and watch how it's working today
[1:23:35] amen
[1:23:36] and you shall see it is the very
[1:23:39] in other words when you are looking at
[1:23:41] something you need to pass the name
[1:23:46] amen but here you need to look at the
[1:23:49] manifestation of something
[1:23:52] and you go back to the scripture and you
[1:23:54] look at what happened in the scripture
[1:23:57] even though it is another name
[1:24:00] don't worry about the name
[1:24:03] it is the same thing amen
[1:24:09] amen everybody here amen
[1:24:12] if in the bible
[1:24:15] god was discerning the thoughts of the
[1:24:17] people
[1:24:20] giving the birth to the congregation
[1:24:23] everybody
[1:24:25] he used a body there
[1:24:28] brother brother said he was not the body
[1:24:30] of jesus christ
[1:24:31] because jesus was not born there
[1:24:34] hey back here so god manufacture a body
[1:24:38] that he borrowed over there
[1:24:41] whatever name he gave to that body it is
[1:24:44] not a problem
[1:24:47] anybody here if he called that body
[1:24:51] choice that's no problem
[1:24:53] the problem is what did he do in that
[1:24:56] body
[1:24:59] everybody here
[1:25:00] and what is he doing today
[1:25:03] if the action he did there is the same
[1:25:07] today
[1:25:08] it is telling you it is the same spirit
[1:25:16] you cannot have the spirit of jesus
[1:25:18] christ and you acting like the devil
[1:25:26] let's keep moving
[1:25:28] brother branham say
[1:25:29] you'll be surprised to know that some of
[1:25:32] it
[1:25:33] is in the highest ecclesiastical
[1:25:36] realms everybody okay
[1:25:39] brother branham says this again he said
[1:25:41] everything that there is today
[1:25:44] had its beginning
[1:25:45] and everything that there is begin in
[1:25:49] genesis
[1:25:50] remember life
[1:25:52] began in genesis
[1:25:55] death
[1:25:56] began in genesis
[1:25:58] and all touch
[1:26:04] everybody okay
[1:26:05] begin in
[1:26:07] so when you read genesis there is more
[1:26:10] than what you can see with your eyes
[1:26:14] hallelujah
[1:26:15] he said right and wrong
[1:26:18] oh begin in genesis if you study the
[1:26:21] scripture real closely you shall find
[1:26:24] out that even the ism
[1:26:27] and the courts of today had the
[1:26:29] beginning in
[1:26:32] all them aims
[1:26:33] that we have today beginning genesis now
[1:26:37] today they polish it up
[1:26:40] and make it look like something else
[1:26:44] but
[1:26:45] it is still that all evil spirit
[1:26:49] if you shall watch the nature of it and
[1:26:52] the way he does water
[1:26:55] amen
[1:26:57] so don't tell me
[1:26:58] the name is christian

[1:27:08] operation of jesus christ

[1:27:16] watch the operation
[1:27:18] of that christian music

[1:39:28] everybody okay
[1:39:29] the bible says this he say and samuel
[1:39:32] say what have you done and so say
[1:39:35] because i saw that the people were
[1:39:37] scattered from me and that you came not
[1:39:40] within the days appointed
[1:39:43] and that the philistines gather
[1:39:45] themselves together and make much
[1:39:47] therefore said i
[1:39:49] the first thing will come now upon me to
[1:39:51] yoga and i have not made my simply
[1:39:55] made supplication to the lord i force
[1:39:58] myself therefore and offer the burn

[1:40:06] stop you have done
[1:40:08] do you get it aha you get it you get it
[1:40:12] you get it you acted as a foolish virgin
[1:40:16] that's why saul was saved but he went
[1:40:20] through tribulation
[1:40:26] is it okay son was saved but they have
[1:40:29] to cut his head
[1:40:31] he went through tribulation
[1:40:36] is everybody okay is everybody okay
[1:40:43] let's change this again
[1:40:46] everybody okay
[1:40:48] you have not kept the commandment of the
[1:40:50] lord
[1:40:51] your god which he commanded you for now
[1:40:54] would the lord have established your
[1:40:57] kingdom upon israel forever but now your
[1:41:02] kingdom shall not continue
[1:41:05] the lord has sought him a man after his
[1:41:08] own
[1:41:09] and the lord has commanded him to be
[1:41:12] captain over his people because you have
[1:41:14] not kept that which the lord commanded

[1:47:10] oh you already got it
[1:47:12] you want me to continue
[1:47:16] now a certain man was sick
[1:47:18] named lazarus of bethany
[1:47:21] the town of mary and her sister marta
[1:47:24] and it was that mary was anointed it was
[1:47:28] that mary which anointed the lord with
[1:47:30] ointment
[1:47:31] and wiped his feet with her hair whose
[1:47:33] brother lazarus was sick therefore his
[1:47:36] sister sent to him saying lord behold he
[1:47:41] whom you love
[1:47:43] so they have to put a special code to
[1:47:45] speed jesus
[1:47:47] if they say he's sick remember you love
[1:47:50] him so when they say you love him if
[1:47:53] jesus is working or he's eating a
[1:47:55] hamburger hamburger he dropped the
[1:47:57] hamburger he got to the flight he's
[1:48:00] going straight
[1:48:01] so they put something there remember the
[1:48:03] one that you love is right here in other
[1:48:05] words you need to leave everything
[1:48:07] you're doing and come right now
[1:48:08] emergency

[1:48:16] you think oh my god
[1:48:18] lazarus is dead where is the ticket it
[1:48:20] costs ten thousand dollars i'm gonna pay
[1:48:22] for it
[1:48:24] this is an expensive time because it's
[1:48:26] summer i don't care i need to go that's
[1:48:29] what you think jesus will do because he
[1:48:31] loves lazarus
[1:48:33] let's see what jesus died
[1:48:35] when jesus heard that he says this
[1:48:38] sickness
[1:48:39] is not to death but for the water
[1:48:42] the glory of god that the son of god
[1:48:46] might be water
[1:48:48] thereby
[1:48:49] now jesus loved not only lazarus but he
[1:48:53] loved marta and her sister and lazarus

[1:59:40] from there
[1:59:42] getting the bread together then

[1:59:53] this all to run out
[1:59:56] when this oil run out
[1:59:58] it's gonna show the color of people

[2:01:04] in a hidden
[2:01:06] wisdom even what god which god ordered

[2:01:14] so when you preach jesus christ
[2:01:17] you don't just preach him like jesus
[2:01:18] christ
[2:01:20] you need to preach him in a mystery
[2:01:24] but not an open mystery a hidden mystery

[2:16:41] branham say there is no higher order
[2:16:45] that god have them to reveal his word
[2:16:48] because when he revealed that when you
[2:16:50] heard that that roman centurion say hey
[2:16:54] you don't have to lay hand on me
[2:16:56] go even come to my home
[2:16:58] just
[2:17:00] that's all
[2:17:04] everybody here
[2:17:05] when he spoke the word did he spoke the
[2:17:08] word in the same place the person was
[2:17:09] sick
[2:17:10] so how did that person many mouths got
[2:17:12] sick here
[2:17:21] you have brothers overseas in africa
[2:17:24] you are here in america when you call
[2:17:27] them on the telephone
[2:17:28] when you say hello does it take two to
[2:17:31] two weeks for your hello to be there
[2:17:33] when you say hello what happened there
[2:17:36] they hear you also hello why you are far
[2:17:39] away when you speak you are like you
[2:17:41] speaking close
[2:17:48] everybody okay everybody okay so we
[2:17:51] preach christ
[2:17:52] not jesus jesus did what problem say why
[2:17:55] that's why they holler
[2:17:57] and the life don't change
[2:17:59] the pentecostal keep getting washed
[2:18:02] that's right
[2:18:03] it looks like they can't put they can't
[2:18:05] stop they keep messing up because they
[2:18:08] don't know what is the name of god
[2:18:11] everybody okay we found out that
[2:18:13] according to this
[2:18:15] this oil here
[2:18:17] and the all of the candlestick are the
[2:18:19] same
[2:18:20] because they're using the same part but
[2:18:23] our main thing is in the second oil
[2:18:26] everybody okay now in the second oil
[2:18:28] according to leviticus the candlestick
[2:18:32] have to be refilled
[2:18:34] by the priest
[2:18:37] if the candlestick goes out
[2:18:40] who is responsible for the candlestick
[2:18:42] the priest for the lineage of aaron so
[2:18:46] if the candlestick goes out whose fault
[2:18:48] is it
[2:18:52] you ready
[2:18:53] you ready
[2:18:54] you ready and you recall the priest is
[2:18:57] the office
[2:18:59] of the son of god
[2:19:01] if you keep up with sermon you're going
[2:19:03] to be okay
[2:19:04] anybody care because the prophet is the
[2:19:07] son of man
[2:19:09] anybody here
[2:19:10] and we found out that samuel
[2:19:13] son of man we found out that samuel was
[2:19:15] not a priest
[2:19:17] he was a prophet
[2:19:19] but he operated
[2:19:21] first
[2:19:22] like a priest they gave him an effort
[2:19:24] but he was not delivered
[2:19:27] he worked as a leaver
[2:19:28] but he was not delivered
[2:19:31] at the beginning of his ministry
[2:19:33] he's going to be like a leaver he have
[2:19:35] to work with the candlestick
[2:19:38] [Music]
[2:19:42] did you get me
[2:19:44] if you didn't raise your hand
[2:19:48] when samuel
[2:19:49] normally the way he should operate was
[2:19:52] directly as a prophet
[2:19:55] everybody here but when they bring him
[2:19:58] to the temple his prophetic office was
[2:20:01] quiet
[2:20:02] he could not operate he have to follow
[2:20:04] the priest when he wake up in the
[2:20:06] morning he goes he say ila good morning
[2:20:09] what should i do and illa say you take
[2:20:11] this you take this put the oil and do
[2:20:13] this so he's operating with the light of
[2:20:16] the priest but he's not really the
[2:20:19] priest
[2:20:20] everybody here anybody okay at the
[2:20:23] beginning he have to operate as a priest
[2:20:27] at the beginning brother branham have to
[2:20:30] operate
[2:20:31] as any other preacher
[2:20:34] preaching divine healing preaching
[2:20:37] miracle and ever but that's not really
[2:20:39] his office
[2:20:42] at the beginning he must use the oil
[2:20:46] from the candlestick
[2:20:48] but that was not his ministry his
[2:20:51] ministry was the second oil
[2:20:55] but he must start with the other hole he
[2:20:57] must pick up the pentecostal oil
[2:21:00] [Music]
[2:21:02] and when he pick up the pentecostal he
[2:21:05] has campaign he has healing services he
[2:21:08] goes to the full gospel he was operating
[2:21:11] as a priest
[2:21:13] but that was not his office that's why
[2:21:16] brother branham said not the years of
[2:21:18] preparation not the years i operated as
[2:21:22] a priest but when i begin to sound the
[2:21:25] mystery
[2:21:27] when the seals are open
[2:21:29] [Music]
[2:21:32] are we okay now
[2:21:34] are we okay now
[2:21:35] jesus christ
[2:21:37] the bible says
[2:21:39] minister unto the lord before who
[2:21:43] and the word of the lord was very
[2:21:45] precious means he was rare
[2:21:48] in those days there was water
[2:21:51] there was no open vision but the prophet
[2:21:53] was there
[2:21:54] in other words the prophetic office
[2:21:56] didn't kick on yet
[2:21:58] everybody okay
[2:21:59] what happened
[2:22:01] the bible says this
[2:22:03] that and it came to pass at that time
[2:22:06] when ela was laid down
[2:22:09] in his place
[2:22:11] and his eyes
[2:22:14] got dim
[2:22:20] his eyes
[2:22:22] goddamn
[2:22:24] is that what the bible say
[2:22:28] okay
[2:22:30] every word in the scripture
[2:22:32] is pharaoh
[2:22:34] his eyes begin
[2:22:37] they didn't get them
[2:22:39] they began
[2:22:40] to watch what
[2:22:42] that he could not
[2:22:46] samuel was not totally blind
[2:22:53] ela
[2:22:55] was not totally black the way we think
[2:22:58] we think that ela was blind
[2:23:00] no his eyes
[2:23:02] begin to get dim so he cannot see
[2:23:06] clearly
[2:23:07] if you look at another translation he
[2:23:10] said illah could not see clearly
[2:23:14] he was not completely blind
[2:23:17] he was
[2:23:18] he was just his eyes begin to get messed
[2:23:22] up
[2:23:23] everybody here when the eye of the
[2:23:25] priest
[2:23:27] begin to go out
[2:23:30] anybody here his eyes begin to go out
[2:23:35] something happened in the tabernacle
[2:23:39] everybody okay
[2:23:41] anybody okay
[2:23:42] everybody okay maybe not brought the
[2:23:44] world the oil
[2:23:46] and he was going to the candlestick but
[2:23:49] because he cannot see well this is the
[2:23:51] candlestick he poured the oil here
[2:23:56] and he goes he said we put oil in the
[2:23:59] candlestick
[2:24:00] and then he sat down do you follow me
[2:24:03] and finally the candlestick went out
[2:24:08] am i reading a different bubble
[2:24:11] [Music]
[2:24:12] [Laughter]
[2:24:15] over here because
[2:24:17] the air the lamp of the god did what
[2:24:20] who had the responsibility to put oil
[2:24:24] but if the lamp went out what happened
[2:24:26] to the priest
[2:24:28] he was not water
[2:24:30] he was not pouring all that's why the
[2:24:32] lamp did what
[2:24:34] when the bridegroom terry
[2:24:37] what happened to all the lamp
[2:24:40] everybody okay
[2:24:41] everybody okay
[2:24:42] everybody okay so when the lamp went out
[2:24:46] god now came to speak to samuel
[2:24:48] the prophetic office open up
[2:24:51] which a prophet is a light
[2:24:55] but a different light
[2:24:57] it is a human light because jesus said
[2:24:59] john the baptist was a light
[2:25:03] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:25:05] so when
[2:25:06] that eye
[2:25:08] whine out in other words the prophet
[2:25:11] the priest i
[2:25:12] were not completely blind everybody
[2:25:16] the priest was almost blind
[2:25:20] ever here and the light of the lord went
[2:25:24] out
[2:25:25] everybody here
[2:25:26] and when he went out another office the
[2:25:29] prophet
[2:25:31] kicked in
[2:25:32] and god turned and began to speak to the
[2:25:34] prophet like i'm done with the
[2:25:36] priesthood
[2:25:37] i cannot cooperate with eli anymore now
[2:25:39] i'm dealing with the prophet
[2:25:41] then he begin to call samuel samuel
[2:25:45] they're going out of the lamp
[2:25:50] brother problem saying
[2:25:52] when the lord showed the churches
[2:25:55] in the sky
[2:25:57] there were seven churches
[2:26:00] anybody here
[2:26:02] everybody here seven why the problem
[2:26:04] when he
[2:26:05] described it he said at the beginning it
[2:26:07] was like this
[2:26:08] then it was like this
[2:26:10] right
[2:26:11] then it came like this
[2:26:13] then in tertiary and almost everything
[2:26:16] then over here the light began to come
[2:26:18] out
[2:26:19] then over here but in laodicea what
[2:26:21] happened
[2:26:24] everybody okay and brother branham took
[2:26:27] his pain
[2:26:28] and opened another light to you
[2:26:31] and leave everything here what
[2:26:34] and the bible say that laodicea
[2:26:38] is blind
[2:26:39] [Music]
[2:26:41] [Applause]
[2:26:42] do you know that
[2:26:44] do you know that
[2:26:45] when laodicea goes totally blind
[2:26:49] kicking out christ out of the church
[2:26:52] the prophetic office open
[2:26:54] do you follow me do you follow me
[2:26:57] what is that blindness is now this year
[2:26:59] like
[2:27:04] brother problem says this they were
[2:27:07] blind
[2:27:08] that is a bad way to be
[2:27:10] i don't think these christians were so
[2:27:12] blind as they was nearsighted
[2:27:21] let me continue
[2:27:22] he said i believe they were water
[2:27:26] brother brother say the blindness of
[2:27:28] laodicea doesn't mean that they were
[2:27:31] totally blind
[2:27:33] the blindness of elah doesn't mean that
[2:27:37] elah was totally blind
[2:27:41] brother branham said their blindness was
[2:27:44] near
[2:27:45] sighted
[2:27:46] near-sighted means they cannot see far
[2:27:50] away
[2:27:51] if you need a coach you see me
[2:27:54] i have three of them anybody okay near
[2:27:56] near-sided means if they want to read
[2:27:59] something they have to bring the staff
[2:28:01] closer like this
[2:28:03] everybody okay it is called myopia
[2:28:07] but here they cannot see far away
[2:28:14] but here they can only see things
[2:28:17] that are closer to the eye
[2:28:22] you okay
[2:28:23] they can only see things that are closer
[2:28:27] to the surface
[2:28:32] you didn't get me
[2:28:33] they cannot see deep
[2:28:39] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:28:42] [Music]
[2:28:44] they only think
[2:28:46] the only thing they could look at was
[2:28:48] their big building
[2:28:50] only thing they could look at was their
[2:28:52] big congregation only thing they can
[2:28:54] look at is how well carnage choir with
[2:28:57] all these big robes and things i think
[2:28:59] they were just near sudden they could
[2:29:02] not see over there
[2:29:04] so they can't see beyond what they told
[2:29:07] them
[2:29:08] amen
[2:29:09] i don't think they were blind they were
[2:29:12] just nearsighted
[2:29:14] all they could see was there well you
[2:29:17] know what we belong to so and so their
[2:29:19] big denomination their big crowd many
[2:29:22] members they sunday school they found me
[2:29:24] they cannot see past that layer
[2:29:28] everybody okay so far
[2:29:30] let me help you up again brother brother
[2:29:32] come on
[2:29:33] what i'm saying you are blind and what
[2:29:37] now this is a really desperate how can
[2:29:39] anyone be blind and naked and not
[2:29:41] knowing it
[2:29:42] yet he says that they were blind and
[2:29:44] naked and cannot
[2:29:46] the answer is they were spiritually
[2:29:50] and spiritually
[2:29:52] do you remember when elisha followed me
[2:29:55] carefully
[2:29:56] and giazi was surrendered by the army of
[2:30:00] the syrian
[2:30:02] you recall that elijah smote them water
[2:30:06] by the water
[2:30:07] that blindness
[2:30:09] was blindness to specific things
[2:30:15] everybody okay
[2:30:16] when elijah smoked them blind it didn't
[2:30:20] mean that they were all going like this
[2:30:22] no
[2:30:23] elisha came to them
[2:30:25] and spoke to them
[2:30:27] and said good morning guys
[2:30:29] what do you want they say we are looking
[2:30:31] for elijah but it's elijah talking to
[2:30:34] them and then i shall say you're looking
[2:30:35] for elisha they say yes sir he said let
[2:30:38] me come let me lead you to elisha and
[2:30:41] elisha is leading them
[2:30:44] toward the city but it's a larger that
[2:30:46] they're looking for
[2:30:48] so their blindness
[2:30:50] was not
[2:30:51] to the city
[2:30:54] their blindness was not to the highway
[2:30:57] they were blinded to a larger
[2:31:00] [Music]
[2:31:03] [Applause]
[2:31:12] their eyes were what
[2:31:15] and they could see where they were
[2:31:17] so it's not your kind of blindness
[2:31:20] but here in other words god
[2:31:23] got in their perception and remove
[2:31:27] the id of elisha
[2:31:29] [Music]
[2:31:31] so they can see elisha they would never
[2:31:34] know that italian even if you give them
[2:31:37] the birthday the birth certificate you
[2:31:40] give them the passport you give them the
[2:31:43] the the id from dmv
[2:31:45] they look like this they will tell you
[2:31:47] he doesn't look like it
[2:31:50] [Music]
[2:31:51] because in them
[2:31:53] the decoding of elijah is removed
[2:31:59] do you get me
[2:32:01] this is what i'm trying to say
[2:32:03] their blindness was peculiar in that
[2:32:06] they could see certain things
[2:32:09] but all the certain things
[2:32:12] such as
[2:32:13] ander
[2:32:15] and the camp of israel they could not
[2:32:18] what this army couldn't
[2:32:20] what this army could see did not avail
[2:32:24] for them in other words whatever they
[2:32:27] are seeing
[2:32:29] was not helping them
[2:32:31] do you follow me but what they did not
[2:32:34] see
[2:32:35] what was hidden from them that's what
[2:32:39] brought them to what
[2:32:41] the one they could not recognize is the
[2:32:43] one that put them in the trap
[2:32:46] but everybody that word
[2:32:49] do you get what i'm saying
[2:32:51] you get what i'm saying
[2:32:52] it is a blindness that blinds you to the
[2:32:56] messenger
[2:32:59] [Music]
[2:33:00] amen
[2:33:02] but here
[2:33:03] you are with felicia you are talking
[2:33:05] with elisha but you don't know this is
[2:33:08] elisha
[2:33:09] and the russia can take you and put you
[2:33:11] in a trap
[2:33:13] but here so what you see doesn't help
[2:33:16] you but what is hidden
[2:33:20] if you only recognize the hidden path
[2:33:24] then you will say wait a minute this is
[2:33:26] elijah again
[2:33:28] [Music]
[2:33:32] so that blindness is blindness to the
[2:33:36] hidden things
[2:33:38] [Music]
[2:33:43] under god
[2:33:45] let's make it clear
[2:33:47] in mark chapter 8
[2:33:49] verse 22 the bible says that and he
[2:33:52] become to bedside jesus
[2:33:55] and they bring him a water
[2:33:58] we okay
[2:34:00] unto him and besought him to do what
[2:34:04] good
[2:34:05] and he took the blind man by the hand
[2:34:08] and led him out of the town and when he
[2:34:10] had spit on his eyes
[2:34:15] this is your savior
[2:34:18] this is your savior
[2:34:20] you see now come on now
[2:34:22] amen
[2:34:23] it's insane
[2:34:25] jesus did it
[2:34:28] you see now
[2:34:31] and if it's brother banana brother mary
[2:34:33] branham
[2:34:34] you see what i'm saying
[2:34:36] he said and he spit in his eyes and put
[2:34:39] his hand upon him and asked him if he
[2:34:42] saw what
[2:34:43] in other words jesus touched him
[2:34:47] when he touched him
[2:34:48] he finish
[2:34:51] what do you see
[2:34:52] there is a first touch
[2:34:58] everybody okay
[2:35:00] do you pick up
[2:35:01] do you pick up
[2:35:02] did you pick up
[2:35:05] what do you see in the first stage
[2:35:07] in the first anointing of christ
[2:35:11] what do you see
[2:35:13] when his anointing touch you what do you
[2:35:16] see
[2:35:17] he says
[2:35:18] and he look up and say i see what
[2:35:22] as water
[2:35:23] stop
[2:35:26] if he can recognize men
[2:35:29] i don't know
[2:35:30] so probably he was not born blind
[2:35:33] [Music]
[2:35:35] everybody okay
[2:35:37] everybody okay probably he was not born
[2:35:39] grand because he can say i see men
[2:35:42] he see men as what
[2:35:44] so he knew the difference between a man
[2:35:46] and a tree
[2:35:47] anybody okay anybody okay but this touch
[2:35:51] is giving confusion
[2:35:56] am i reading a different bible
[2:35:58] if you have a problem open your
[2:35:59] scripture
[2:36:01] when he look at the human being
[2:36:04] they look like what
[2:36:06] when he look at tree so they look like
[2:36:09] what
[2:36:12] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:36:14] so this man even though he can see
[2:36:19] he doesn't see clearly
[2:36:24] everybody okay
[2:36:25] even though i can see
[2:36:29] anybody okay he cannot see
[2:36:31] clearly
[2:36:34] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:36:37] and then what happened
[2:36:39] i see men are street doing what
[2:36:42] after that he put his hand what
[2:36:46] which time
[2:36:48] which
[2:36:48] time you have not caught it yet which
[2:36:51] time
[2:36:54] we tried
[2:36:56] what does it do to the young man
[2:37:01] everybody okay
[2:37:02] everybody okay everybody okay so when he
[2:37:05] touched the second time and made him to
[2:37:08] do what
[2:37:09] what happened to his eyes
[2:37:11] and he can see what
[2:37:14] how
[2:37:15] [Music]
[2:37:16] 20 20.
[2:37:20] everybody here
[2:37:21] everybody here
[2:37:22] so the blindness of ira was not totally
[2:37:26] blind
[2:37:27] when the blindness goes like bringing
[2:37:30] confusion it is a time for another touch
[2:37:36] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:37:38] so
[2:37:40] the first blindness
[2:37:43] with the first under the first touch
[2:37:47] under the first anointing of jesus he
[2:37:50] anointed him with his saliva
[2:37:53] everybody okay after that anointing is
[2:37:56] coming from his word
[2:37:58] everybody here you remember the sword
[2:38:00] coming from the mouth when he anointed
[2:38:02] him
[2:38:03] the first anointing he could see
[2:38:07] but
[2:38:08] he was confusing
[2:38:10] between a human being and what
[2:38:16] let me say it again it was confusion
[2:38:18] between human being and
[2:38:22] every word in the bible is waiting for
[2:38:25] uh
[2:38:28] what are you saying pastor
[2:38:30] when you take the bible
[2:38:34] you got it
[2:38:35] and you give to this man
[2:38:38] under the first touch
[2:38:42] when he read
[2:38:44] in the garden of eden there was a tree
[2:38:51] do you follow me
[2:38:53] do you follow me when he sees tree
[2:38:56] he only see a tree
[2:38:59] [Music]
[2:39:07] because there were two trees
[2:39:09] in the garden of eden they were the tree
[2:39:12] of life
[2:39:13] who can give people life
[2:39:16] who give people life
[2:39:18] [Music]
[2:39:19] who can give somebody life
[2:39:22] show me that tree when i go i would say
[2:39:24] tree give me life what is that chewy
[2:39:27] [Music]
[2:39:28] that tree is water
[2:39:30] the tree of life
[2:39:32] is a tree that you go to it it's gonna
[2:39:34] give you life by you own life
[2:39:38] who can give people life
[2:39:40] was he really a tree
[2:39:42] he was there
[2:39:46] [Music]
[2:39:47] he was a person
[2:39:50] that your life was a person
[2:39:53] but under the first anointing
[2:39:56] you can tell them it's a person they
[2:39:58] only see a tree
[2:40:05] [Applause]
[2:40:06] do you follow me you follow me
[2:40:09] you can say the tree of life was not a
[2:40:12] natural tree he was crushed when they
[2:40:15] look they see men they see jesus christ
[2:40:18] but they see him walking as a tree and
[2:40:21] when they draw they're gonna draw you a
[2:40:22] tree with an apple
[2:40:27] [Applause]
[2:40:28] [Music]
[2:40:29] they need the second touch
[2:40:32] when you open up
[2:40:34] when you see you say no it is not a tree
[2:40:37] it was jesus christ
[2:40:42] [Applause]
[2:40:43] because i come that the sheep might have
[2:40:46] life and they can have it abundantly i
[2:40:50] am their way i am the truth and i am
[2:40:52] what
[2:40:58] [Music]
[2:41:00] everybody okay when that blind must kick
[2:41:03] him
[2:41:05] the prophetic anointing open
[2:41:10] i don't know when i'm gonna preach the
[2:41:11] beast
[2:41:12] [Music]
[2:41:14] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:41:20] i'm already past my time
[2:41:22] we have to call this another title again
[2:41:27] everybody okay
[2:41:28] everybody okay we saw
[2:41:31] that
[2:41:32] when the candlestick were put up they
[2:41:34] were put as a rainbow looking up
[2:41:37] and it was only half the rainbow because
[2:41:40] the correct original rainbow of god is a
[2:41:42] circle everybody here and then they were
[2:41:46] only a rainbow and a half anybody care
[2:41:49] that's when paul say
[2:41:53] oh god help me paul say we know how
[2:41:59] we prophesy how
[2:42:00] we are under the candlestick
[2:42:02] ever here but when that which is what
[2:42:06] this is part
[2:42:08] [Music]
[2:42:10] this is what
[2:42:13] perfect or complete
[2:42:15] when that which is perfect is come
[2:42:18] that which is what
[2:42:20] part is what
[2:42:21] because the perfect contender part
[2:42:26] everybody okay
[2:42:27] this is your part
[2:42:30] amen
[2:42:31] the perfect is like easy
[2:42:33] when that which is perfect come
[2:42:35] that which is part is gone away because
[2:42:38] we already have what
[2:42:40] the part and we have the missing part
[2:42:43] it's the missing part that makes
[2:42:46] everything
[2:42:48] it is this one is open
[2:42:51] this one is
[2:42:57] amen so when the seals open
[2:43:01] it tells you that what happened we have
[2:43:03] now though
[2:43:05] [Music]
[2:43:06] then whatever was part
[2:43:08] that's why we don't read luther
[2:43:10] we don't read wesley we don't read the
[2:43:13] messenger anymore
[2:43:15] because everything is now put back in
[2:43:17] order everybody okay and then when it's
[2:43:20] done away
[2:43:21] plus say for i am jealous of you
[2:43:25] with godly water
[2:43:29] are you the husband
[2:43:35] why are you jealous
[2:43:36] it's somebody else's wife
[2:43:41] everybody okay
[2:43:42] and he said for i have what
[2:43:47] paul didn't say i marry you i have water
[2:43:55] amen amen because it was not the time of
[2:43:58] marriage
[2:44:00] everybody here i have despised you in
[2:44:03] other words paul
[2:44:05] i have started with you with all which
[2:44:07] oil
[2:44:11] and because of this
[2:44:13] because of this i have inspired you to
[2:44:18] one husband that i may present you as a
[2:44:21] what
[2:44:24] everybody okay to who
[2:44:26] which is the husband but i do what
[2:44:29] why do you feel
[2:44:34] what do you feel
[2:44:37] what do you feel i feel
[2:44:39] less by what
[2:44:42] ask
[2:44:44] them you see when i started the sermon
[2:44:48] you see when i started the sermon now as
[2:44:50] the serpent did what
[2:44:53] through water
[2:44:55] the serpent in the garden of eden was
[2:44:58] water
[2:45:02] in other words power
[2:45:04] when he started the church
[2:45:08] he was afraid
[2:45:10] afraid of what
[2:45:15] amen his fear
[2:45:18] bring to remember us
[2:45:20] what happened in eden
[2:45:23] [Music]
[2:45:24] amen
[2:45:25] are we okay now are we connecting
[2:45:27] everything now
[2:45:28] paul is saying i'm afraid but for you to
[2:45:31] understand why i'm afraid
[2:45:34] you need to go back
[2:45:36] to eden
[2:45:44] everybody okay now
[2:45:45] he says why because so your mind
[2:45:50] should be what
[2:45:52] from the water
[2:45:55] that is in who
[2:45:56] what is simplicity
[2:46:02] brother branham you okay
[2:46:05] preach a message
[2:46:07] god
[2:46:11] let's go slowly
[2:46:13] god
[2:46:16] let's go slowly
[2:46:18] god
[2:46:19] does two things
[2:46:22] number one he does what
[2:46:25] he hides
[2:46:28] everybody care and he does what
[2:46:33] how
[2:46:38] everybody okay
[2:46:39] so simplicity
[2:46:42] is the way god hides
[2:46:49] everybody here and reveal
[2:46:57] everybody okay
[2:46:58] and paul
[2:46:59] is saying not just the simplicity but
[2:47:02] the simplicity that is where
[2:47:08] in christ
[2:47:10] there is a way that god hides
[2:47:15] and god reveals himself
[2:47:17] and i'm afraid
[2:47:20] you
[2:47:21] will go away from that
[2:47:24] that's why paul say when i preach jesus
[2:47:27] christ i preach him by the
[2:47:31] revelation of the
[2:47:33] mystery i don't want you to get away
[2:47:36] from that way of preaching
[2:47:37] [Music]
[2:47:39] because when you preach jesus christ
[2:47:42] according to the revelation of the
[2:47:43] mysteries you will tell them you will
[2:47:46] show to the people how god hides
[2:47:50] and how he does what
[2:47:55] everybody okay that's why paul could
[2:47:58] take the book of hebrew
[2:48:00] and get into the levitical priesthood
[2:48:03] and put jesus christ out of it
[2:48:06] and say he was the holy place he means
[2:48:08] this the lamb means christ the high
[2:48:10] priest means this he was the high priest
[2:48:12] under my kisser he was going into the
[2:48:14] law
[2:48:15] where christ was hidden
[2:48:17] and he took christ from there and paul
[2:48:20] opened christ
[2:48:22] and gave it to the people he said when
[2:48:24] you want to preach christ
[2:48:26] you must preach him the way he
[2:48:30] and the way he does what
[2:48:33] [Music]
[2:48:35] but i'm afraid
[2:48:36] you're gonna get away from this
[2:48:39] because when you get away from this kind
[2:48:42] of preaching this is what he does
[2:48:48] you ready
[2:48:50] if da if he
[2:48:52] that cometh preaches what
[2:49:00] so jesus can be another jesus
[2:49:02] [Music]
[2:49:05] so when you say jesus i need to know
[2:49:07] which jesus you say
[2:49:09] because there is another jesus
[2:49:13] that's why brother branham said when
[2:49:14] they holler they don't get nothing
[2:49:17] because they're preaching another jesus
[2:49:26] are we preaching
[2:49:27] even in the rank of the message
[2:49:29] [Music]
[2:49:30] what are we preaching
[2:49:32] ever here
[2:49:33] if one cometh preaches water
[2:49:37] whom we
[2:49:38] [Music]
[2:49:42] so paul preach jesus
[2:49:45] those people preach also jesus
[2:49:48] but that jesus is different than the
[2:49:51] jesus of paul
[2:49:54] but the two names are jesus
[2:49:58] because the way paul preached jesus
[2:50:01] he preached jesus
[2:50:03] in the mystery
[2:50:08] amen
[2:50:08] amen
[2:50:11] if you receive another what
[2:50:14] which you have not
[2:50:16] so to jesus
[2:50:18] to spirit another water
[2:50:21] two gospels
[2:50:23] which you have matter
[2:50:25] he might well bear him
[2:50:29] i'm afraid
[2:50:30] paul
[2:50:31] how can you be afraid
[2:50:37] the bible says uh brother branham say
[2:50:41] what opportunity we have
[2:50:43] we have opportunity that simple never
[2:50:45] dream of ever we have opportunity that
[2:50:47] enoch elijah and all of them never had
[2:50:51] the opportunity we have
[2:50:53] what are those opportunities let me head
[2:50:55] to the airport
[2:50:57] i can't get to the service
[2:51:01] brother branham say
[2:51:03] the second
[2:51:05] watcher
[2:51:08] according to what we read
[2:51:10] in the book of genesis
[2:51:12] god created man
[2:51:15] adam was alone
[2:51:17] no help made for him everybody okay
[2:51:20] god looked
[2:51:21] he took adam he put him to sleep
[2:51:24] which we understand through the story of
[2:51:26] lazarus putting somebody to sleep for
[2:51:29] christian is death
[2:51:31] everybody okay they put adam to sleep
[2:51:33] when they put adam to sleep
[2:51:36] god went
[2:51:37] and pierced the side of adam
[2:51:39] and opened and pulled a rib
[2:51:42] eye back here and took the rib and make
[2:51:45] a woman as soon as he made the woman
[2:51:47] genesis chapter he made a woman bring
[2:51:50] her
[2:51:51] put the ceremony marry them as soon as
[2:51:54] he married them
[2:51:56] anybody here
[2:51:58] the serpent comes
[2:52:01] adam
[2:52:02] never knew eve
[2:52:04] because both of them the scriptures say
[2:52:06] they watch one another but they were not
[2:52:07] ashamed
[2:52:08] they were ashamed after
[2:52:11] everybody okay
[2:52:12] everybody okay now now
[2:52:15] when jesus came
[2:52:17] who is the second adam
[2:52:19] god took jesus to the cross
[2:52:22] we okay now
[2:52:23] and put jesus to sleep
[2:52:26] and peace the son of jesus christ
[2:52:28] everybody okay and bring water and bring
[2:52:31] one and that's what the bread came out
[2:52:34] of it
[2:52:35] amen and prayer came
[2:52:38] when paul looked at the bread he said
[2:52:41] which side this bread comes
[2:52:44] they say he comes from the side of
[2:52:47] the second adam paul say ah
[2:52:50] i'm afraid
[2:52:52] because i remember in either
[2:52:56] but here when that happened in eden
[2:53:00] there was somebody the serpent that came
[2:53:03] and he filed this eve
[2:53:06] what are you saying he said the second
[2:53:08] eve watch her
[2:53:10] she was created anew
[2:53:12] like
[2:53:13] he was at the day of water
[2:53:16] filled with water
[2:53:17] there's fresh soil
[2:53:20] the candlestick begins to burn
[2:53:22] anybody okay the church started
[2:53:25] on the day of pentecost anybody okay
[2:53:28] thank god and fed by the water
[2:53:31] amen
[2:53:32] that first church
[2:53:34] that first eve
[2:53:36] which was to be crushed brad
[2:53:39] because paul didn't perform the marriage
[2:53:41] he was to be he only espoused them how
[2:53:44] many can say a man to that
[2:53:47] she was to be
[2:53:49] that's why paul say i just put you as a
[2:53:52] fiance i need to present you amen
[2:53:56] she was born at pentecost
[2:53:58] not in nazia
[2:54:00] she was born on the day of water
[2:54:03] she was peer where she was spirit-filled
[2:54:06] she was spirit-filled the word fed every
[2:54:09] word that proceeded out of the mouth of
[2:54:11] god oh they just had to take everything
[2:54:14] just word by word a real blooming plant
[2:54:17] on god's earth representing him in other
[2:54:20] water
[2:54:21] everything looked perfect in the blood
[2:54:25] god took paul and said paul
[2:54:28] when paul came paul say
[2:54:31] according to the grace of god which is
[2:54:34] given to me as a what
[2:54:37] [Music]
[2:54:39] not a foolish one
[2:54:41] master builder i have done water
[2:54:44] so beside the outpouring of the holy
[2:54:47] spirit paul came and took the foundation
[2:54:50] and laid
[2:54:52] in other words he reinforced the church
[2:54:54] i laid the foundation
[2:54:56] and another build of their own
[2:54:58] but
[2:55:00] let every man take water
[2:55:03] why paul
[2:55:05] the church have the holy ghost
[2:55:07] you lay the foundation why are you
[2:55:09] afraid
[2:55:10] but paul is afraid he said lest every
[2:55:13] man let every man take heed how he does
[2:55:16] what
[2:55:17] for other foundation
[2:55:20] can no man lead
[2:55:22] that is led which is who
[2:55:24] now you understand which jesus is
[2:55:26] talking
[2:55:27] not just jesus jesus jesus jesus
[2:55:30] according to the what revelation of the
[2:55:33] mystery so if paul the church started
[2:55:36] with the holy ghost if the church you
[2:55:38] placed the foundation why are you afraid
[2:55:45] why are you afraid
[2:55:47] let me leave you with this
[2:55:48] then we're going to pick up
[2:55:50] because i don't want to wiggle you
[2:55:52] the bible paul says this
[2:55:55] john says this
[2:55:57] you okay
[2:55:58] little children
[2:56:00] it is the
[2:56:02] was that the last time
[2:56:08] and as ye have heard
[2:56:10] that the antichrist shall what
[2:56:14] even
[2:56:16] so john detected something right at the
[2:56:19] beginning of the church
[2:56:20] he said hey
[2:56:22] wait a minute stop jumping around
[2:56:25] something is going on here
[2:56:27] paul say remember eden
[2:56:30] as soon as the brad was born
[2:56:32] the serpent is coming
[2:56:34] everybody okay
[2:56:35] even now there are many water
[2:56:38] so what seems to be blooming
[2:56:41] behind there
[2:56:44] the antichrist was there
[2:56:49] anybody okay
[2:56:51] whereby we know that it is there
[2:56:54] so paul john when he look he say
[2:56:57] antichrist
[2:56:59] if antichrist come
[2:57:01] so we must be the last time
[2:57:03] it must be the
[2:57:04] last stage so jesus is just about to
[2:57:07] come he didn't have the seals
[2:57:13] everybody here
[2:57:15] but here the seals are not open yet the
[2:57:18] antichrist started everybody here
[2:57:20] and he says they went out from us
[2:57:24] but they were not of water
[2:57:26] for if they had been of us
[2:57:32] i hope you understand
[2:57:34] there would no doubt have what
[2:57:38] disqualification time
[2:57:42] somebody is going out
[2:57:44] there is a reason why they have to go
[2:57:46] everybody here but they want out that
[2:57:49] they might be made what
[2:57:51] that they were not at all
[2:57:55] the separation must happen
[2:57:57] everybody here so now john begin to tell
[2:58:00] us that hey
[2:58:02] the antichrist is here
[2:58:04] we just received the baptism of the holy
[2:58:06] spirit the church is blooming
[2:58:09] wait a minute the antichrist is here so
[2:58:11] this is the last time
[2:58:13] because this antichrist is supposed to
[2:58:14] be coming at the last time
[2:58:17] okay
[2:58:21] paul says
[2:58:22] take heed therefore unto yourself
[2:58:25] and to all the flock
[2:58:27] over which the holy ghost has made you
[2:58:29] overseer to feed the church of god
[2:58:32] which he has purchased with his own
[2:58:35] he called the elders he began to talk to
[2:58:37] them
[2:58:38] he said be careful
[2:58:40] keep the church of the lord
[2:58:42] keep preaching to them the stuff from
[2:58:44] the holy ghost i'm gonna go they're
[2:58:46] gonna kill me in jerusalem
[2:58:48] for i know
[2:58:51] this that after
[2:58:53] my departure
[2:58:55] paul
[2:58:57] shall water
[2:59:01] the bride will not stay like this
[2:59:04] according to what happened in eden
[2:59:07] amen
[2:59:09] the story is going to be repeated again
[2:59:11] but i must go
[2:59:13] amen
[2:59:14] not sparing what
[2:59:16] also of your own
[2:59:19] [Music]
[2:59:20] within the garden
[2:59:22] not outside the garden within the garden
[2:59:25] amen shall water
[2:59:28] speaking water
[2:59:30] to draw away water
[2:59:32] therefore watch and do what
[2:59:35] that of the by the spaces of how many
[2:59:38] years
[2:59:39] i cease not to do water
[2:59:42] how many times
[2:59:44] with water so this a person who placed
[2:59:48] the foundation
[2:59:49] who saw the holy ghost coming down he's
[2:59:52] crying every night why are you crying
[2:59:55] paul and no
[2:59:58] something is happening
[3:00:00] why
[3:00:01] look at what happened in eden when the
[3:00:04] first adam had his wife the serpent came
[3:00:07] this is the second adam his wife open up
[3:00:12] amen
[3:00:13] the serpent is coming up
[3:00:16] let's finish with this take seconds
[3:00:18] thessalonians and we close here
[3:00:24] oh my god
[3:00:29] i don't know if we need to call this
[3:00:31] part one
[3:00:34] it's already part 28.
[3:00:39] let's go to second thessalonians and
[3:00:41] then we stop here
[3:00:44] second thessalonians chapter two verse
[3:00:46] one
[3:00:50] if you dare you can say amen
[3:00:53] you there
[3:00:54] now
[3:00:55] we beseech you brethren
[3:00:57] by the
[3:00:58] coming of our lord jesus christ
[3:01:01] and by our gathering together into whom
[3:01:05] we're talking about the coming of the
[3:01:07] lord and the gathering together in him
[3:01:10] the bridegroom is coming
[3:01:12] what is going on paul
[3:01:14] that you shall you'll be not soon shaken
[3:01:17] in mind
[3:01:18] or be trouble neither by spirit nor by
[3:01:22] word nor by leather as from us
[3:01:25] as the day of christ is water
[3:01:27] in other words
[3:01:29] john came he said wait a minute the
[3:01:32] antichrist is here
[3:01:34] so it's the last time
[3:01:36] john was not the messenger
[3:01:38] [Music]
[3:01:39] you okay
[3:01:40] paul who is the messenger comes
[3:01:43] he said let me stabilize the church
[3:01:46] he said brethren
[3:01:47] i heard that's all of you this is the
[3:01:49] end time this is the end time jesus is
[3:01:51] coming i want you to quieten your nerve
[3:01:54] a little bit okay
[3:01:56] i don't want you to get trouble
[3:01:58] because jesus would not come
[3:02:02] until
[3:02:03] until what
[3:02:05] watch verse 3
[3:02:07] let no man deceive you by any means
[3:02:10] for that day
[3:02:14] we okay
[3:02:15] shall not come
[3:02:17] the coming of the lord jesus will not
[3:02:20] come
[3:02:21] auntie accept
[3:02:23] the calm water
[3:02:26] so if there is not a fall yet
[3:02:30] jesus won't come
[3:02:34] we okay now so paul as a prophet look at
[3:02:37] the church he said no
[3:02:39] don't be afraid
[3:02:42] what you see as a big move here
[3:02:45] it's gonna fall
[3:02:48] hey but here when you see it falling
[3:02:51] then begin to get prepared he's coming
[3:02:54] anybody here
[3:02:55] they will not come except they're
[3:02:58] falling away first and the man of sin
[3:03:04] keep that in mind
[3:03:05] for next sunday
[3:03:07] will be water
[3:03:09] so the man of sin is sealed
[3:03:15] everybody okay paul said that there is a
[3:03:18] man of sin
[3:03:20] he's not revealed yet
[3:03:23] john called him the antichrist but that
[3:03:25] man
[3:03:26] is not to reveal it
[3:03:28] he says it's not revealed the who
[3:03:32] the son of water
[3:03:34] who was the son of tradition
[3:03:36] was judah alive here
[3:03:39] judah was already dead
[3:03:41] buried already
[3:03:43] but why is the
[3:03:45] son of perdition back again
[3:03:48] [Music]
[3:03:49] you okay now you okay now
[3:03:53] who that son of perdition opposes and
[3:03:57] exalt himself above all that is called
[3:04:01] god
[3:04:02] or that is worship so that he as god
[3:04:06] sit in the temple of what
[3:04:09] it's a man of sin so it's a human being
[3:04:13] amen
[3:04:15] showing himself that he is water
[3:04:17] who is the human being
[3:04:21] that make himself god
[3:04:24] we're going sorry are we gonna go
[3:04:26] through eden and drop down like this
[3:04:28] everybody here remember you not
[3:04:31] that when i was yet with you i told you
[3:04:34] these things
[3:04:36] and now you know that what we fall death
[3:04:40] that he might be revealed in his water
[3:04:43] this is not the time of the seals
[3:04:45] there's no way i can tell you the detail
[3:04:48] you gotta wait for the end time amen
[3:04:51] for the mystery
[3:04:55] how are you gonna know him
[3:05:00] by mystery you need a revelation of the
[3:05:03] mystery to know this man so if you don't
[3:05:06] want the mysteries how are you going to
[3:05:07] know how to do how how to perceive that
[3:05:10] this is what they were talking about
[3:05:13] amen
[3:05:15] amen
[3:05:16] everybody that if eve knew
[3:05:19] the mystery she would not have fallen
[3:05:22] in fair because she didn't know the
[3:05:24] mystery they only preached to her by
[3:05:27] adam
[3:05:29] but she didn't have the mystery and paul
[3:05:31] is saying that our preaching part
[3:05:35] the mystery are still closed
[3:05:37] and because the mystery are closed a
[3:05:40] falling away will come
[3:05:42] there is a predicted form
[3:05:44] of the church
[3:05:46] it's predicted it's gonna fall because
[3:05:49] the seals are not revealed
[3:05:51] but you must wait at the end time when
[3:05:54] the city are gonna reveal then you're
[3:05:56] gonna handle
[3:06:01] everybody okay
[3:06:02] he says
[3:06:03] for the mystery of iniquity that's
[3:06:06] already
[3:06:08] he didn't say it will work
[3:06:10] it's already
[3:06:14] you see now

[3:07:28] until the wicked one
[3:07:31] be revealed whom the lord shall do what

[3:07:42] you okay now
[3:07:44] even him who's coming is after the
[3:07:48] working of who
[3:07:50] keep that for next sunday

[3:07:59] book of revelation and you're gonna see
[3:08:01] this clear
[3:08:02] amen
[3:08:03] with all
[3:08:04] deceivableness of unrighteousness in
[3:08:07] them that do what
[3:08:09] why because
[3:08:12] they receive not the water
[3:08:15] [Music]
[3:08:17] the love of water
[3:08:19] that they might be
[3:08:21] and for this cause god shall send them
[3:08:24] water
[3:08:26] that they shall believe the water
[3:08:29] why you don't believe a lie
[3:08:34] that they all may be them who believe
[3:08:37] not there
[3:08:39] but head pleasure in water
[3:08:42] finish here but
[3:08:44] we are bound
[3:08:46] [Music]
[3:08:48] to give thanks
[3:08:50] how many times
[3:08:52] to god for who
[3:08:54] why do you thank god for us
[3:08:57] present
[3:08:58] beloved of the lord why because
[3:09:03] god
[3:09:06] has
[3:09:07] from the
[3:09:09] chosen
[3:09:11] to water
[3:09:13] through the
[3:09:14] water after
[3:09:17] and believing of water
[3:09:19] that's why when they preach the
[3:09:22] mysteries
[3:09:23] something in you
[3:09:25] you cannot help it
[3:09:28] he bypassed your reasoning
[3:09:30] because you were predestinated for that
[3:09:34] truth
[3:09:35] when the truth is unfold
[3:09:37] something in you grasp it and pull it
[3:09:40] aside
[3:09:42] and you shall know the truth
[3:09:45] it is not the knowing of the end
[3:09:48] a knowing of the heart and the truths
[3:09:51] accept you
[3:09:52] that's why the woman of the world when
[3:09:54] she knew the truth the truth did water
[3:10:01] and who the son has set free is what
[3:10:06] let's stand
[3:10:13] remember
[3:10:16] there is a blindness
[3:10:18] amen
[3:10:20] this oil
[3:10:21] disqualifies us
[3:10:23] that by the tearing
[3:10:24] of the broad groom
[3:10:26] he also unfolded the time of the rapture
[3:10:28] because the resurrection is the end
[3:10:31] amen
[3:10:32] but
[3:10:33] there is a second oil that have been
[3:10:35] kept
[3:10:36] all along that have to be used only when

[3:13:33] lord we are for we are
[3:13:37] thanking you father
[3:13:39] for your grace
[3:13:40] for your love
[3:13:42] and for your mercy and for everything
[3:13:44] you have been doing for us
[3:13:47] father thank you for unfolding your word
[3:13:50] to your children
[3:13:52] because now we can see
[3:13:55] not by the intellectual eyes
[3:13:57] but the eyes of the heart
[3:14:00] we can now understand
[3:14:02] what lord your prophet
[3:14:04] was speaking all along lord
[3:14:08] father thank you for this oil
[3:14:12] and thank you for your revelation
[3:14:15] that you have brought through this
[3:14:16] message
[3:14:18] because we could be hollering
[3:14:20] left and right
[3:14:22] and not even knowing the trust
[3:14:25] that we are allowed serving
[3:14:28] like paul who thought
[3:14:30] that he was serving you
[3:14:32] but he came to find
[3:14:35] that he was persecuting you until you
[3:14:38] ask him you say paul
[3:14:41] paul
[3:14:42] why do you persecute me and he thought
[3:14:45] he was doing you a service
[3:14:47] and come to find out he was attacking
[3:14:50] the very person of the almighty god
[3:14:55] lord
[3:14:56] may we go deeper
[3:14:58] than what we can see
[3:15:01] father may you remove every blindness
[3:15:04] spiritual from your children
[3:15:06] that is bringing confusion in the word
[3:15:10] until we cannot see clearly
[3:15:12] we can see men looking like trees
[3:15:15] and we like the detail
[3:15:19] and we like the precision
[3:15:21] and we lack the perception
[3:15:24] and how can we walk
[3:15:26] like you taught the pharisee
[3:15:28] that they were blind
[3:15:30] leaders of the blind
[3:15:32] and both of them will fall into the
[3:15:34] ditch
[3:15:35] but father you spoke in the edge of
[3:15:37] laodicea
[3:15:39] you say come and buy out of myself
[3:15:42] so that you can anoint your eyes so that
[3:15:45] you can see
[3:15:46] father that oil that you are bringing
[3:15:49] through this message to anoint our eyes
[3:15:51] lord that we must see the king and we
[3:15:54] can understand clearly
[3:15:57] like elijah todd russia that if you can
[3:16:00] see me going if you can understand this
[3:16:02] thing
[3:16:03] then it will be granted unto you
[3:16:06] father may you granted to this church
[3:16:08] and may you remember lord father their
[3:16:10] needs
[3:16:11] earthly speaking on this earth lord
[3:16:14] if they came with a certain need in
[3:16:16] their life
[3:16:17] maybe they struggle in the body maybe
[3:16:20] something lord father they're going
[3:16:21] through that they need a solution or an
[3:16:23] answer from thee father we pray lord
[3:16:26] that you minister unto them we thank you
[3:16:29] always for their patience lord for going
[3:16:32] an extra mile to give us time to unfold
[3:16:35] this lord may the holy spirit continue
[3:16:37] to minister to them and to unfold beyond
[3:16:40] what was preached this morning lord so
[3:16:43] that the inside teacher himself can
[3:16:46] grant them more strongly in the
[3:16:48] scripture and in the word of the hour we

[3:16:53] the young people as they will be making
[3:16:55] their way coming back that your blood
[3:16:58] protect them may you remove every spirit
[3:17:01] of accident every day for sickness but
[3:17:04] may you bring them here back safe and
[3:17:06] sound all the way to their respective
[3:17:09] place lord we humbly ask it and commit
[3:17:11] everything unto the hand in the name of
