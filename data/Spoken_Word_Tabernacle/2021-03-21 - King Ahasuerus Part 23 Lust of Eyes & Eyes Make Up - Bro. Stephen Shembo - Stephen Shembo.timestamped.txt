[37:24] comes in like a flood lord and he's
[37:25] coming in like a flood because of the

[39:08] lord god that you might come lord god
[39:11] and sit among your children lord god

[39:14] but lord you teach us to ask for great
[39:16] things heavenly father
[39:17] and there's no greater thing that we can
[39:19] ask for lord god but a greater
[39:21] outpouring of your spirit lord god
[39:23] we ask you these things heavenly father
[39:25] believing lord god that whatsoever we
[39:27] ask in your name we shall have

[39:59] tactics lord god

[51:56] keep forgetting about it
[51:58] i believe if it was uh brother robert
[52:01] was a couple way a couple fridays ago
[52:06] me and brother robert were at the
[52:09] church property there he was waiting on
[52:12] contractors and things like that
[52:15] so we were outside talking with brother
[52:18] robert
[52:20] and suddenly a whirlwind came out
[52:24] you don't believe on it check your bible
[52:28] that was my first time that i was inside
[52:31] the whirlwind
[52:33] so it started swirling around moving
[52:37] around moving around
[52:38] and finally me and brother robert were
[52:41] in the midst of the whirlwind
[52:44] a powerful one then it left me and
[52:47] brother robert
[52:49] and he went straight to the door of the
[52:51] church
[52:52] and opened the door of the church
[53:01] amen god spoke to job in the whirlwind
[53:07] and brother robert rushed and tried to
[53:09] hold the door to pull it back
[53:11] but the whirlwind was so strong that
[53:14] brother robert was unable to pull the
[53:16] door back
[53:17] then he left the door again and come and
[53:19] went straight in the midst of the
[53:21] property
[53:22] and whirled around and went up and that
[53:24] was it
[53:33] [Applause]
[53:36] you know in the scripture elijah and
[53:38] elisha were talking together right
[53:40] until the world won't come up so it's up
[53:43] to you to know what was i talking with
[53:45] brother of it
[53:47] that's a i can't say it on youtube
[53:50] before i get somebody upset thank you
[53:53] very much the musician
[53:54] god reach me bless you
[53:56] [Laughter]
[53:58] amen
[54:03] your church is made out of concrete
[54:06] you know that right you want me say it
[54:10] okay few people so we leave it alone
[54:13] [Laughter]
[54:17] few people so we leave it alone do you
[54:20] want me to say it
[54:22] oh okay so you'll be responsible for it
[54:25] [Laughter]
[54:30] i was uh i believe it was the week
[54:33] before
[54:34] i was with brother tim hayton
[54:39] and he mentioned to me he said brother
[54:40] stephen there is something about this
[54:43] area
[54:44] that the spirit of the lord like
[54:47] he said there used to be an old church
[54:51] of the message
[54:53] in that area he says something happened
[54:57] and the church left the message
[55:00] amen he said then a second church came
[55:04] in
[55:05] in the same area he said for some reason
[55:10] the same scenario again happened he said
[55:14] the lord again took you and brought you
[55:16] in the same area back again
[55:21] i say and he told me say i don't know it
[55:24] seems like there is something in this
[55:26] area
[55:27] that the lord still want to hold the
[55:30] church there
[55:31] regardless of what happened
[55:34] so when i told robert that he said what
[55:36] is stephen i never even thought about it
[55:39] and i said you know the story of the
[55:41] three little pigs
[55:44] [Applause]
[55:46] can you say amen i say if you look at
[55:50] your church
[55:51] it is made out of concrete
[55:55] amen and that story had the big
[55:58] bad wolf and paul in the scriptures say
[56:02] the nicolet and spirit is a spirit of
[56:06] wolf
[56:07] [Music]
[56:08] and the first house was blown
[56:11] by the wolf you remember that
[56:15] and the second house was made out of
[56:17] what
[56:22] the second house was made out of what
[56:24] [Music]
[56:27] made out of water
[56:32] are you there it was made out of wood
[56:37] and the wolf came and blew it up
[56:40] are you there i said the third one
[56:44] is made out of concrete this time
[56:48] this is the last one and this house is
[56:51] not going to fail
[56:56] amen that's why your whirlwind came up
[57:00] [Laughter]
[57:03] are you there then your whirlwind was so
[57:06] happy
[57:07] that we were talking about it and he
[57:10] came
[57:11] as a vindication that this time
[57:15] this is the end that's what
[57:18] [Laughter]
[57:23] that's why your building doesn't give
[57:25] you much room to play
[57:29] the even the door of that building are
[57:32] still
[57:33] you can't temper with it amen
[57:36] this world now doesn't give any room
[57:40] to manipulate again
[57:44] let's go to our bible before we get into
[57:45] something else
[57:48] you made me disclose my secret
[57:54] [Laughter]
[57:58] amen the third house
[58:01] that was the end of the bad wolf amen
[58:05] that house was made out of concrete

[58:15] ambulance
[58:17] genesis chapter 3
[58:21] blessed be the name of the lord
[58:24] how many are on
[58:27] listen to the sermon on wednesday
[58:31] so everybody is in the page nobody
[58:33] behind them
[58:35] praise god genesis
[58:38] chapter 3 if you dare you can say amen
[58:43] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[58:47] lord
[58:48] brother david if you would check please
[58:51] the folks online
[58:52] last wednesday they were worrying about
[58:54] the sound and something like that
[58:57] so just make sure everything is good and
[59:00] connected
[59:01] as a priest working in the sanctuary
[59:05] you have a right to check your text
[59:09] if it's nothing about the sacrifice then
[59:11] you got to go outside
[59:14] you got to stay within the sacrifice
[59:16] then you can do it on the sabbath day
[59:19] if it's not the sacrifice then you gotta
[59:21] respect the sabbath
[59:23] in other words if it's not related to
[59:25] the church you cannot text
[59:29] six if you're there you can say amen
[59:33] hallelujah and when the woman soaked
[59:37] the last of the eyes that the tree was
[59:40] good for food and that it was pleasant
[59:44] to the eyes the last of the earth if you
[59:46] notice you might be seated
[59:48] that the problem with eve is more
[59:51] related
[59:52] to the eyes because the eyes brad
[59:56] branham told us
[59:57] that it's the gate to what it's a gate
[1:00:01] to the soul i love this church
[1:00:03] hallelujah amen and that he was pleasant
[1:00:08] to the eyes
[1:00:09] notice that everything that made it fair
[1:00:13] is related to the eye the look the
[1:00:16] appearance
[1:00:17] everybody clear
[1:00:20] praise the name of the lord and a tree
[1:00:23] to be desired
[1:00:25] so not only was he pleasant enticing
[1:00:29] to the eyes but it was something
[1:00:32] that causes you to last after
[1:00:37] not only was a pleasant to the eye
[1:00:42] but it's something that can cause lust
[1:00:46] are you following me it's something that
[1:00:49] can
[1:00:50] turn the black dog on
[1:00:54] everybody clear if you watch that too
[1:00:57] long
[1:00:58] if you focus your eyes on that
[1:01:02] automatically it would turn the black
[1:01:04] dog on
[1:01:07] it started with a sight but once you get
[1:01:11] past the sight
[1:01:12] it gets into a lust you begin to
[1:01:15] desire it you begin to long for it
[1:01:23] we have a terrible territory this
[1:01:25] morning a tough one
[1:01:27] not even terrible it's it's a terrible
[1:01:29] as far as the black dog
[1:01:32] they treat to be desire to make one what
[1:01:36] wise what kind of wisdom is that
[1:01:40] what kind of wisdom is that
[1:01:43] somebody called it if you go to the book
[1:01:46] of james
[1:01:47] james say there is a wisdom that is
[1:01:49] earthly
[1:01:51] and that wisdom is essential
[1:01:55] if you need that scripture you see me
[1:01:57] it's essential
[1:01:58] it's based on lust right but clear
[1:02:02] she took off the fruit after the last of
[1:02:05] the ice
[1:02:06] and after desiring and begin to last
[1:02:09] after
[1:02:10] remember the two women in uh ezekiel 23
[1:02:13] right
[1:02:14] they were lasting after something after
[1:02:17] lasting after something
[1:02:18] then she ate the fruit so you don't eat
[1:02:21] the fruit
[1:02:22] just like that you remember the
[1:02:25] mechanism of james
[1:02:28] before you get to the eating there is
[1:02:30] the last of the eyes
[1:02:32] that last of the eyes will turn on the
[1:02:34] black dog
[1:02:36] once the black dog is turned on then the
[1:02:39] next thing
[1:02:39] you are doomed to commit adultery or
[1:02:42] fornication
[1:02:43] anybody clear and did eaton gave also to
[1:02:47] her
[1:02:48] husband with her and he did what
[1:02:51] now he moved from one person it became
[1:02:54] contagious now
[1:02:58] you became an agent of satan
[1:03:02] you are now dispatching
[1:03:05] by influence
[1:03:08] you are now influencing somebody else
[1:03:11] you started it on
[1:03:13] now after you committed everything
[1:03:15] outside
[1:03:16] you want to be bold enough to bring it
[1:03:18] to the church
[1:03:21] are you there that's why we've seen in
[1:03:23] the past where we came out
[1:03:25] you will see a young man backsliding
[1:03:28] he's going to go stay away from church
[1:03:30] for so long
[1:03:32] and the next time you meet him coming to
[1:03:34] church you're going to see him bringing
[1:03:36] his girlfriend
[1:03:37] how many seen that you remember in the
[1:03:40] old church
[1:03:41] in other words he got bored enough that
[1:03:44] he's coming in the church
[1:03:46] to show the young people that i can do
[1:03:49] it
[1:03:49] and nothing can be done if you do it
[1:03:53] here
[1:03:53] you're not going to leave this church
[1:03:55] i'll talk to you
[1:03:58] okay if you do it stay away
[1:04:02] if you bold enough to come here i'll
[1:04:04] make sure the d can keep you there
[1:04:06] and i'm gonna talk to you
[1:04:11] okay verse seven
[1:04:14] and the eyes of both of them were water
[1:04:18] they were open after this after they ate
[1:04:21] the fruit
[1:04:22] and they knew that they were water
[1:04:25] so they never when they were under the
[1:04:27] state of innocency
[1:04:29] which is the state of an infant as we
[1:04:32] showed you
[1:04:32] on the drawing there was no worry
[1:04:36] about the outfit everyone
[1:04:39] clear the worry of the outfit
[1:04:43] or the outer appearance
[1:04:48] it is turned on
[1:04:51] with the black dog
[1:04:56] everybody clear in other words it takes
[1:04:59] the turning on of
[1:05:01] the black dog which happened a puberty
[1:05:05] a teenager also turn you to be
[1:05:09] conscious about how you gonna be start
[1:05:12] uh start joining yourself
[1:05:16] everybody clear in other words a young
[1:05:19] man
[1:05:20] can take a you can give them any kind of
[1:05:22] clothes they don't care
[1:05:24] they can wear whether the paint is short
[1:05:26] or whatever
[1:05:27] they can come to church they don't worry
[1:05:29] about it but if you look once you reach
[1:05:31] an age of teenager
[1:05:33] then you begin to worry about your
[1:05:35] appearance
[1:05:36] then you begin to worry even the young
[1:05:38] men they want to look good they want to
[1:05:40] have a tie
[1:05:40] they want to make sure their hair is cut
[1:05:42] a certain way
[1:05:43] they were not worrying about that before
[1:05:46] but they start
[1:05:48] to be worried about it when the black
[1:05:50] dog is
[1:05:51] activated so the activation of the black
[1:05:54] dog
[1:05:55] you don't do you do that you don't
[1:05:57] understand why you're doing it
[1:05:59] but you are doing it because you came to
[1:06:01] the time of love
[1:06:03] that time of love comes with you to be
[1:06:05] conscious
[1:06:06] that hey i need to make myself look good
[1:06:10] and you want to see the same struggle
[1:06:12] what happened in menopause
[1:06:14] when you turned off
[1:06:18] i'm going to show you that amen
[1:06:21] hallelujah have you never seen a woman
[1:06:24] going to menopause how she's
[1:06:28] don't worry we'll go through that and
[1:06:30] we're going gonna give you coat you're
[1:06:32] gonna see
[1:06:34] and the eyes of both of them were open
[1:06:38] and they knew that they were what naked
[1:06:41] and they saw fig leaves together
[1:06:45] and made themselves what apron
[1:06:48] so they begin to be concerned
[1:06:52] about how they should dress
[1:06:55] everybody the concern of the dressing
[1:06:59] comes
[1:07:00] with the turning on or the opening of
[1:07:04] the gate
[1:07:05] to the black dog amen instead of
[1:07:08] relying to god to tell them
[1:07:12] how to dress dead themselves begin to
[1:07:15] dress themselves
[1:07:17] so it's an automatic response
[1:07:20] for a young man or a young woman that
[1:07:24] goes to puberty
[1:07:25] to begin to dress themselves a certain
[1:07:28] way
[1:07:30] your dress code started
[1:07:35] right there when the innocency is broken
[1:07:38] anybody clear verse 8 and they heard the
[1:07:42] voice of the lord
[1:07:44] god walking in the garden in the cool of
[1:07:47] the day
[1:07:49] and adam and his wife did what
[1:07:52] why did they heed themselves when they
[1:07:54] already cover themselves
[1:07:59] are you awake they already
[1:08:02] saw fig leaves they went to walmart
[1:08:06] and they pick up a clothes and they put
[1:08:08] it
[1:08:09] already clear according to their own
[1:08:12] house
[1:08:13] because everything that a man does is
[1:08:15] good in his own eyes
[1:08:17] solomon say so according to their owners
[1:08:21] when they put that clothes on that dress
[1:08:24] when they begin to go out they thought
[1:08:26] they cover
[1:08:27] their nakedness it takes the presence of
[1:08:31] god
[1:08:32] to tell you that the dress
[1:08:37] the skirt they paint
[1:08:40] the shirt that you have is inappropriate
[1:08:46] can you say amen when you are outside
[1:08:50] the presence of god you will think what
[1:08:53] you're wearing is correct
[1:08:55] it takes the presence of the almighty
[1:08:58] god
[1:08:59] to prove to you that no matter what
[1:09:02] you're wearing you think you're looking
[1:09:04] good
[1:09:05] in the eyes of the lord you are still
[1:09:07] naked
[1:09:09] you need a clothing that when god
[1:09:13] look at you god can see you wearing
[1:09:18] clothes
[1:09:22] at the opening of the seven seal
[1:09:25] the bible became a new book
[1:09:29] and adam and his wife did what they hid
[1:09:32] themselves
[1:09:34] from what from the presence of the lord
[1:09:37] among the trees of the garden
[1:09:41] everybody clear and the lord called to
[1:09:44] adam and say where are you
[1:09:46] and he said i heard your voice in the
[1:09:49] garden
[1:09:50] and i was water for the first time
[1:09:54] i was afraid because i was water i
[1:09:57] thought they already have clothes but in
[1:10:01] the presence of
[1:10:02] the lord they could not justify
[1:10:05] their outer appearance they could not
[1:10:09] take their clothing and prove to god
[1:10:11] that we are still clothed
[1:10:14] they sense themselves that that clothes
[1:10:17] was not enough
[1:10:18] to protect them from the presence of the
[1:10:21] lord
[1:10:21] everybody clear i was naked and i did
[1:10:25] water
[1:10:26] i hid myself everybody clear job to
[1:10:29] verse 21st
[1:10:32] to adam this is man achievement
[1:10:37] after the opening of the ice after they
[1:10:39] touch the fruit
[1:10:40] after the black dog is awakened because
[1:10:44] satan could do nothing to them as long
[1:10:47] as their eyes was blind
[1:10:49] that's just like a child nothing their
[1:10:52] eyes is blind
[1:10:53] but once the eyes is open then there
[1:10:56] will be
[1:10:57] an automatic response from you to see a
[1:11:00] young girl
[1:11:01] to begin to fix yourself
[1:11:04] the reason why you want to make yourself
[1:11:06] look beautiful
[1:11:08] it is a signal that the black dog has
[1:11:11] been turned on
[1:11:15] do you follow me the reason why you want
[1:11:18] to look good on a suit on a good time
[1:11:20] it is telling you that your black dog
[1:11:23] was turned on
[1:11:27] [Laughter]
[1:11:30] 21st to adam and to his wife
[1:11:35] did the lord make water not
[1:11:38] fig leaves coat of water god
[1:11:41] have to kill a lamb and take the
[1:11:44] covering of the lamb
[1:11:46] and made clothes
[1:11:49] [Music]
[1:11:50] why is god clothing his children
[1:11:55] because the black dog is turned on
[1:11:58] now god also became conscious
[1:12:02] that i need to preach to you about how
[1:12:05] you should dress
[1:12:09] your dress code comes when
[1:12:13] it's turned on anybody clear
[1:12:17] that's why you can hear people my
[1:12:19] daughter is so little
[1:12:20] i can put pants on and brother branham
[1:12:23] doesn't do a problem
[1:12:25] are you there but once the black dog is
[1:12:28] turned on
[1:12:34] back it up so before when it gets done
[1:12:38] because some people they are turned on
[1:12:40] before even
[1:12:42] 12. so it's up to mama to watch your
[1:12:48] kids
[1:12:50] you there is up to daddy to watch your
[1:12:52] kids
[1:12:55] when they begin to see the first
[1:12:57] menstrual period

[1:13:20] another minister i'm responsible for
[1:13:22] your soul

[1:13:27] and to adam also and to his wife did the
[1:13:31] lord make what
[1:13:32] coats of skin and did what
[1:13:36] look at the word they didn't say that
[1:13:39] god

[1:13:43] cloth of water them the dress god was
[1:13:47] not for adam only
[1:13:49] he was for both adam and who

[1:13:59] we are still on the preparation to the
[1:14:02] second banquet
[1:14:03] we are shooting the black dog territory
[1:14:08] i'm way down into the deep the mid zone

[1:14:27] you can say amen
[1:14:29] verse 8
[1:14:34] for jerusalem is what roon
[1:14:37] and judah is fallen because their tongue
[1:14:41] and their doing
[1:14:43] are against who the lord to provoke the
[1:14:46] eyes of his glory
[1:14:48] verse nine they show off their
[1:14:51] countenance
[1:14:53] that's weakness against them in other
[1:14:55] words
[1:14:56] when you look at their face their face
[1:14:59] is already telling their sin
[1:15:02] everybody and they declare their sin
[1:15:05] as who as sodom they hide it what in
[1:15:10] other words
[1:15:10] people are not ashamed of their sin
[1:15:13] anymore
[1:15:15] it used to be they do certain things and
[1:15:17] they hide it
[1:15:18] but the people in this last day are so
[1:15:21] bold
[1:15:22] until they are expressing their sin plum
[1:15:25] blank and that attitude is an attitude
[1:15:28] that was
[1:15:29] in sodom they can't hide
[1:15:33] it used to be that when people are
[1:15:35] homosexual they will do that
[1:15:37] at night but now they don't care
[1:15:40] whether it's day or night they're going
[1:15:42] to show you clearly that i'm a
[1:15:44] homosexual
[1:15:45] i'm a transgender
[1:15:49] anybody they hide it note
[1:15:52] word to their soul for they have
[1:15:55] rewarded what
[1:15:56] evil to themselves job to verse 16.
[1:16:00] moreover the lord says
[1:16:04] because the daughter of who so these are
[1:16:07] the women
[1:16:08] in the church
[1:16:12] the women that call themselves christian

[1:16:44] or can you see a proud spirit
[1:16:47] do we see on your profile a young lady
[1:16:50] that is humble
[1:16:52] or do we see a young lady that is really
[1:16:55] looking at somebody

[1:17:02] watch what they post
[1:17:04] and you're gonna find out they are
[1:17:08] already
[1:17:09] proud and they work with what
[1:17:13] straightforwardness right here
[1:17:18] when you talk to them they look at you
[1:17:20] like this are you there
[1:17:23] and what wanton eyes do you know what
[1:17:26] wanton means
[1:17:28] seductive eyes

[1:17:49] twisting as they walk i'm going to show
[1:17:52] you that
[1:17:52] messing means twisting i'm going to show
[1:17:54] you what brother branham said
[1:17:56] so when they walk they are twisting
[1:17:58] themselves
[1:18:00] this is not pagan these are the daughter
[1:18:04] of zion a spirit upon the church
[1:18:08] making women behave a certain way
[1:18:15] messing as they go and making water
[1:18:20] a tickling with the water and tinkering
[1:18:23] with the
[1:18:24] feet in other words when they walk there
[1:18:27] is a noise
[1:18:32] what are they wearing
[1:18:36] chill out
[1:18:40] you see now right in the bible
[1:18:43] i hope god will remove a stubborn spirit

[1:19:00] that you're going to look at your shoe
[1:19:02] and you put it in the garbage
[1:19:08] and making a tinkling with their feet
[1:19:12] therefore the lord was smart with a scab
[1:19:16] the crown of their head
[1:19:20] on the head of the daughters of zion
[1:19:24] and the lord will discover the secret
[1:19:26] part
[1:19:27] do you see what is coming to you you
[1:19:30] open a door that you're gonna be
[1:19:34] vulnerable

[1:19:39] you are telling god turn on hell
[1:19:43] on toward me and brother branham said
[1:19:46] that's the reason why
[1:19:48] the boy begin to whistle at you
[1:19:52] because you told god take off the
[1:19:55] protection off

[1:20:35] the bravery
[1:20:37] of their tinkling ornament about their
[1:20:40] feet
[1:20:42] and of their cause and their ron
[1:20:45] tire like the moon their

[1:21:37] and the mantle and the wimples and the
[1:21:40] crispin pins you know what it means
[1:21:42] sister
[1:21:43] and the water
[1:21:47] if you look at that word it means the
[1:21:49] hand mirror
[1:21:52] so what you're doing now is not new it
[1:21:54] was in the bible
[1:21:56] they had a hand mirror over there there

[1:21:59] nothing wrong with having a hand mirror
[1:22:02] in your
[1:22:03] purse in your bag but it's showing you
[1:22:06] the description of these women their
[1:22:09] emphasis
[1:22:10] is more on the outside appearance
[1:22:16] the glasses or the hand mirrors and the
[1:22:19] fine lining
[1:22:21] and the hoods and the veil
[1:22:24] and it shall come to pass that instead
[1:22:27] of sweet smell there

[1:22:34] all of this to beautify to smell good
[1:22:37] to be attractive and all of that god is
[1:22:40] going to turn it
[1:22:41] into something else and instead of a
[1:22:45] girdle a rot
[1:22:47] a rent and instead of a well-set hair
[1:22:50] what's going to happen to your hair
[1:22:52] because you play
[1:22:53] too much with your hair

[1:28:02] saying to me come here
[1:28:04] i will show you the judgment of the
[1:28:06] great hall
[1:28:07] that sits upon many waters we spoke
[1:28:10] about this on wednesday

[1:28:15] king of the earth have committed water
[1:28:18] so there is a spirit of fornication upon
[1:28:21] the catholic church
[1:28:25] you follow me that great hall is the
[1:28:28] catholic church
[1:28:31] if you have a problem you need to read

[1:28:50] and upon her forehead was the name
[1:28:53] written mystery water that's where
[1:28:56] abraham came out now that babylon
[1:29:00] was already destroyed as a city but the
[1:29:03] spirit that was on babylon

[1:29:45] christ
[1:29:48] that's why they can preach as they
[1:29:50] preach
[1:29:51] but still the women don't change
[1:29:54] because the anointing over there came
[1:29:57] from satan down to the catholic

[1:31:16] when we come

[1:31:19] rupturing faith
[1:31:22] amen the lord is taking this time to

[1:32:10] holy spirit and the
[1:32:12] angels lord of glory comes down lord
[1:32:15] father and minister to your children as
[1:32:18] we commit it all
[1:32:19] in the name of jesus christ amen
[1:32:22] god bless you we on part three preparing
[1:32:25] for the second
[1:32:27] banquet everybody clear on wednesday
[1:32:30] if you can go with me to ezekiel 23
[1:32:33] verse 11. we already got 23
[1:32:36] uh verse one all the way to eight where
[1:32:38] we dealt with the first sister
[1:32:40] her name is who a hola
[1:32:43] okay i hope somebody's not sleeping
[1:32:46] anybody clear
[1:32:48] now we're gonna get her second sister
[1:32:49] verse 11.
[1:32:52] and when her sister a holly bar
[1:32:56] saw this everybody clear
[1:32:59] so there was a power of influence
[1:33:03] ahola lived her life and when she lived
[1:33:06] their life
[1:33:07] they both had the weakness that happened
[1:33:10] in egypt
[1:33:11] and when they lived their life she began
[1:33:13] to live an unclean life
[1:33:15] by having a wrong friendship which went
[1:33:18] to you on wednesday
[1:33:19] and we told you that environment brother
[1:33:22] problem explained to us
[1:33:23] is everything ever clear and brother
[1:33:26] pronoun explained to us
[1:33:28] that when you come unto the lord you
[1:33:30] must separate yourself from your worldly
[1:33:33] friends
[1:33:34] you cannot be a believer and your friend
[1:33:37] is the one smoking pots
[1:33:39] you cannot be held you you cannot have a
[1:33:42] friend
[1:33:42] that is a joker why you are a believer
[1:33:45] because according to the scripture
[1:33:47] automatically the longer you linger with
[1:33:50] him
[1:33:51] you're gonna find yourself going back
[1:33:53] again to the same
[1:33:54] uh thing that you came out everybody
[1:33:56] clear then
[1:33:58] paul came in and explained to us that
[1:34:01] not only for the people on the outside
[1:34:04] but
[1:34:04] even in the church that if you see a man
[1:34:08] that is called a brother if you see
[1:34:10] somebody that is called a sister
[1:34:12] that lives under fornication you must
[1:34:15] separate yourself from that person ever
[1:34:18] clear
[1:34:18] because if you don't do that you're
[1:34:20] going to be contaminated
[1:34:22] because as long as they are sinner in
[1:34:25] the church
[1:34:26] they became an agent for satan ever
[1:34:29] clear so far
[1:34:30] we say in jehoshaphat making a mistake
[1:34:32] on wednesday
[1:34:33] he went and tried to help ahab and he
[1:34:36] almost
[1:34:36] lost his life ever clear and that's the
[1:34:40] reason why
[1:34:40] when somebody's living a wrong life you
[1:34:43] need to stay away from them
[1:34:45] because you can find yourself in a car
[1:34:47] accident
[1:34:48] because you were pulling with your
[1:34:50] friend going somewhere on downtown
[1:34:52] or going somewhere to have good time and
[1:34:54] because of their life
[1:34:56] you can risk your own life am i clear
[1:34:59] but praise be to god
[1:35:00] amazing grace jumping and the lord
[1:35:03] rescued jehoshaphat did he listen
[1:35:05] no he went again and start doing
[1:35:07] business again
[1:35:09] and the lord destroyed the business then
[1:35:10] the third time
[1:35:12] he understood that we cannot do this
[1:35:14] ever here
[1:35:15] abraham came out of the land of the
[1:35:17] counties
[1:35:18] when abraham came out of darling he made
[1:35:21] another mistake again he picked up a lot
[1:35:24] with him
[1:35:25] and god have to cause circumstances to
[1:35:28] happen
[1:35:28] to separate abraham from who from lord
[1:35:31] ever clear
[1:35:32] then we found out that even in the
[1:35:34] family of
[1:35:35] david there was david's nephew
[1:35:39] that gave the plan to destroy her own
[1:35:41] cousin
[1:35:42] that's why even in the family you must
[1:35:45] make sure
[1:35:46] where your children are going if they
[1:35:49] are not leaving the world
[1:35:51] you better protect your children than
[1:35:53] try to protect that family
[1:35:55] everybody clear when paul
[1:35:58] i believe john spoke to us again
[1:36:01] that if somebody comes to you and do not
[1:36:05] believe
[1:36:05] doesn't bring you the teaching that
[1:36:07] we're teaching
[1:36:08] you need to tell that person i'm not
[1:36:10] going to receive you because brother
[1:36:12] branham said
[1:36:13] you must you must you must
[1:36:16] associate with people that believe like
[1:36:19] who
[1:36:20] like you does your friend believe the
[1:36:23] message of the hour
[1:36:25] ever here the bible says if somebody is
[1:36:28] living
[1:36:29] uncleanly you cannot even eat with that
[1:36:31] person
[1:36:32] we show it to you on wednesday you
[1:36:34] cannot go in the restaurant with that
[1:36:36] person young people
[1:36:38] you say no we're not talking about
[1:36:40] religion we are just friend
[1:36:42] we can talk you're gonna find yourself
[1:36:45] you open the door
[1:36:46] that's gonna cause you trouble if your
[1:36:48] friend is speeding on brother branham
[1:36:52] people have friends on facebook that
[1:36:55] are posting things against the message
[1:36:58] why do you keep them as your friend
[1:37:03] are you awake are you awake your friend
[1:37:07] that you have friend on facebook
[1:37:10] everything he's posting
[1:37:12] is against the message of the hour why
[1:37:15] do you keep him on the friend list
[1:37:19] block him block him on what's happened
[1:37:23] block him because that a door
[1:37:26] that satan will continue to pump things
[1:37:29] and before you know it you're gonna
[1:37:31] begin to reason
[1:37:33] and cause you trouble with your faith
[1:37:36] if somebody doesn't believe this message
[1:37:39] if somebody is against this message
[1:37:42] if somebody can talk badly about brother
[1:37:45] pranam
[1:37:46] if somebody can spit on this message
[1:37:49] block that relationship
[1:37:52] cut that relationship off don't
[1:37:54] fellowship with them
[1:37:57] if you don't listen that is your problem
[1:38:00] i don't have your blood with you you're
[1:38:02] going to be responsible
[1:38:04] for your own blood because you value
[1:38:07] your relationship more than the word
[1:38:10] you better come from us to keep your
[1:38:12] friend
[1:38:13] even though your friend is against what
[1:38:15] you believe
[1:38:17] paul said if somebody comes to your
[1:38:19] house when he brings you
[1:38:21] a different teaching than this don't
[1:38:23] receive him
[1:38:24] and paul and john even say don't even
[1:38:27] say bye-bye
[1:38:29] i gave you the scripture on wednesday
[1:38:31] when you said bye-bye
[1:38:33] you are also participating on him
[1:38:37] separate yourself everybody clear
[1:38:40] let's go to verse 11 and when her sister
[1:38:44] a hollyba saw this by influence
[1:38:48] she was more corrupt in her inordinate
[1:38:51] love
[1:38:52] sometimes you see a younger that are
[1:38:54] more troubled than the elder
[1:38:58] have you seen that the elders are a
[1:39:00] little bit moderately
[1:39:02] but the other one that is coming down
[1:39:04] the more world
[1:39:06] [Music]
[1:39:07] amen amen
[1:39:11] the elder knows how to behave in front
[1:39:13] of boys
[1:39:14] but the younger one is so bold
[1:39:17] she's more aggressive to men that's
[1:39:24] right
[1:39:26] in her inordinate love then she no in
[1:39:29] other words
[1:39:30] she did more than her sister
[1:39:34] ever clear and in her
[1:39:37] world more than her sister
[1:39:40] in her wardum verse 12 what happened
[1:39:43] again to her
[1:39:45] she did what she died she lasted same
[1:39:48] thing again
[1:39:49] just like eve remember eve was the last
[1:39:53] of the eyes
[1:39:54] then that last produced the desire
[1:39:58] are you following me then the desire
[1:40:00] brought the action
[1:40:02] then the action turned you into certain
[1:40:05] agent
[1:40:06] everybody clear she dotted
[1:40:10] upon the assyrian the same one that
[1:40:13] god killed took abraham off of him her
[1:40:16] neighbor
[1:40:17] captain and rulers clothed with clothes

[1:40:33] deserve
[1:40:33] what young men not old men
[1:40:37] young men young people young men
[1:40:41] then i saw that she was what
[1:40:44] defiled there was a weakness that she
[1:40:46] had from egypt
[1:40:48] from her youth that they took
[1:40:52] both one way verse 14 and that she
[1:40:55] increased her whoredom her prostitution
[1:40:59] how did she increase that prostitution
[1:41:01] what gave her more

[1:52:18] you have also committed water
[1:52:22] with the word a horror committed
[1:52:26] fornication way
[1:52:27] in egypt a only by committed fornication
[1:52:30] where
[1:52:31] in egypt there is a characteristic about
[1:52:35] the egyptian
[1:52:37] what is that characteristic
[1:52:41] you have also committed fornication with
[1:52:44] the egyptian your neighbor
[1:52:46] great of water flesh and have increased
[1:52:50] your wholedom
[1:52:51] to provoke me to utter you committed
[1:52:55] fornication with people that are more
[1:52:59] inclined sexually than you
[1:53:03] go back to ezekiel 23.
[1:53:08] now let's read it again the egyptian
[1:53:10] verse 20
[1:53:11] for she lasted upon her lover
[1:53:15] whose flesh is as the flesh of water
[1:53:19] and whose issue is like the issues of
[1:53:21] what
[1:53:22] in other words when she committed
[1:53:24] adultery
[1:53:26] fornication she did it with people
[1:53:29] that are master phd everything they do
[1:53:33] is just about sex
[1:53:36] and iron she got into the land of egypt
[1:53:39] into the land of canaan she begin to
[1:53:42] play the movie
[1:53:43] of the world back to her mother she
[1:53:46] opened
[1:53:47] her door to pornography of her mind
[1:53:55] let's move on now does the son of god
[1:54:00] mean angels or spirit from heaven the
[1:54:03] sons of god of genesis 6.
[1:54:06] that was the person question all right i
[1:54:09] believe that there was not
[1:54:10] angels see they were beings
[1:54:13] sons of god like the scripture says not
[1:54:16] angel
[1:54:17] they were sons of god and they came
[1:54:20] from heaven to the earth and was put
[1:54:23] into water
[1:54:24] flesh in other words the people that
[1:54:27] watch women
[1:54:28] and then they begin to last after them
[1:54:30] brother branham said he was not
[1:54:32] injured they were human beings but what
[1:54:35] happened
[1:54:35] in those women beings that made them
[1:54:37] last after women
[1:54:40] not press themselves into flesh because
[1:54:43] josephus was saying that
[1:54:45] they were pressing themselves into flesh
[1:54:46] why branham said no because that way you
[1:54:48] commit
[1:54:49] you make satan a creator everybody clear
[1:54:52] i believe hope flesh is born sexual
[1:54:56] outside of jesus christ i believe he is
[1:54:59] the only virgin born
[1:55:00] being there ever was jesus christ i
[1:55:03] don't agree with josephus on that
[1:55:05] and that great historian about they've
[1:55:07] been pressed in the flesh
[1:55:09] but i do believe that they were
[1:55:11] supernatural what
[1:55:13] beings that come down and to cover the
[1:55:16] spirit of water
[1:55:18] so when those men begin to last after
[1:55:21] those women
[1:55:22] it was actually an anointing that came
[1:55:24] and dropped on them
[1:55:26] you following me praise god
[1:55:29] and i believe they are right here yet
[1:55:32] today you follow me
[1:55:37] still walking around in what
[1:55:41] in other words men die but the spirit
[1:55:45] of sexual lust doesn't die
[1:55:48] it's going to hurt somebody else
[1:55:52] you follow me ungodly
[1:55:55] damn same beastly what i'm saying busily
[1:55:59] you saw the description in ezekiel
[1:56:01] lustfully ungodly what spirit
[1:56:05] to live right in human being now someday
[1:56:09] these men will die and if there is
[1:56:12] another generation
[1:56:13] they shall come right down on what on
[1:56:16] them
[1:56:17] brother brother continue there is where
[1:56:20] i think the same question
[1:56:22] can after the nature of the brute
[1:56:26] everybody following me like an animal
[1:56:29] that lived with this woman
[1:56:31] that brought forth this child which was
[1:56:34] half brute and men like a great beagle
[1:56:37] fellow but the problem is saying here
[1:56:40] that the serpent in the garden of eden
[1:56:43] was the master of sex
[1:56:48] he was the phd of sex
[1:56:51] he is the one that thought if sex
[1:56:55] and a holla and a holy br met
[1:56:58] people just like the serpent
[1:57:04] i'm going there and then he went
[1:57:07] out there and his children begin to come
[1:57:10] from him
[1:57:11] and then beast sexual lust
[1:57:14] like the who in the beginning
[1:57:17] that all last beast found
[1:57:20] this water so the same anointing
[1:57:24] that was in the serpent in the garden of
[1:57:28] eden
[1:57:28] that anointing was moving around the
[1:57:31] land
[1:57:32] and found young men watching women
[1:57:35] and that anointing landed there and then
[1:57:38] got
[1:57:39] into those young men and before you know
[1:57:41] it they were acting like
[1:57:43] beasts won't make people
[1:57:46] act like beasts on pornography
[1:57:49] what is the spirit that anoints
[1:57:52] pornography
[1:57:53] for somebody to behave like that knowing
[1:57:56] that they're gonna be recorded
[1:57:58] it is an anointing of the serpent
[1:58:02] [Music]
[1:58:04] i'm gonna go slowly these daughter
[1:58:08] things and took on them and the
[1:58:10] daughters of men
[1:58:12] look away to jesus how many a rich man
[1:58:15] will listen at this table of that temple
[1:58:19] don't have to be always rich in water
[1:58:22] in money no you can be rich in water
[1:58:27] rich in what pleasure of this life
[1:58:33] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:58:36] lord
[1:58:36] brother branham i go to a man's office
[1:58:40] and he says he's a christian peanut
[1:58:44] all around the world remember a holy bar
[1:58:46] on the wall
[1:58:48] are you there that all boogie woogie
[1:58:51] music going on
[1:58:53] i don't care what he says i don't
[1:58:56] believe his testimony
[1:58:57] because his spirit is doing what
[1:59:00] the black dog is feeding on that his
[1:59:04] spirit
[1:59:04] is feeding on damn things off the water
[1:59:08] the black dog is growing if he would
[1:59:11] marry a chorus girl
[1:59:13] or what if he would marry a what
[1:59:16] so that beastly anointing doesn't work
[1:59:20] only on men he also work on women
[1:59:23] you want to find women that are phd
[1:59:27] in sex
[1:59:32] marry a sex queen oh just to pray the
[1:59:34] modern hicken
[1:59:37] he reflects it shows what he has in mind
[1:59:41] of what his future home is going to be
[1:59:44] because he's going
[1:59:45] to look he took her to raise her
[1:59:48] children in other words when you bring a
[1:59:50] woman
[1:59:51] that you want to get married to your
[1:59:53] wife
[1:59:54] is telling people what is in your heart
[1:59:59] you cannot be a brother in the church
[2:00:02] and you wanted to get married to a woman
[2:00:05] in the world
[2:00:07] and when people meet that woman she's
[2:00:10] dressed sexy
[2:00:11] all her breasts outside that is the
[2:00:14] spirit that is on you
[2:00:15] and you gotta be delivered from that
[2:00:17] demon
[2:00:18] [Applause]
[2:00:21] are you there whatever she is
[2:00:24] that's that is the way she shall raise
[2:00:26] those children
[2:00:27] in other words you get married to her
[2:00:29] she's gonna take that program
[2:00:31] and put it in the children why because
[2:00:34] once you get to eating
[2:00:36] she became an agent of satan she's not
[2:00:39] going to work for the kingdom of god
[2:00:41] she's going to work for the kingdom of
[2:00:42] the devil everybody here
[2:00:45] he reflect what is in the man a man
[2:00:48] that takes a woman like that show just
[2:00:51] what he's thinking of his future
[2:00:54] could you imagine a christian doing a
[2:00:56] thing like that
[2:00:57] no sir i couldn't a true christian
[2:01:01] will not look for such beauty queen
[2:01:04] and chorus girl and what sex queen
[2:01:08] he shall look for christian character
[2:01:12] everybody following me praise the name
[2:01:14] of the lord
[2:01:15] john 31 verse 1 to 3 job say
[2:01:18] i made a covenant with my water
[2:01:22] job made a covenant with his eyes
[2:01:25] why job why do you have to sit and make
[2:01:29] a covenant with your eyes
[2:01:31] what was the covenant job he said i made
[2:01:34] a confident with manager
[2:01:37] why should i what about
[2:01:40] what job says that he made a covenant
[2:01:45] with his eyes do you follow me but
[2:01:48] that covenant is not really with the
[2:01:50] natural eyes
[2:01:52] it is about they think that job
[2:01:55] is thinking in his mind because a holy
[2:01:59] boy
[2:02:00] pulls the video in his mind
[2:02:04] you follow me what are you thinking
[2:02:08] what are you meditating on as a man
[2:02:11] thinking in his heart so is the man
[2:02:15] job said i made a confident with my eyes
[2:02:18] but the problem is not the eyes the
[2:02:20] problem is my
[2:02:22] thinking i am checking my thinking
[2:02:26] why do you check your thinking i'm
[2:02:28] checking my
[2:02:29] thinking that the subject of my thinking
[2:02:33] is not about women
[2:02:36] [Music]
[2:02:39] for what portion of god is there from
[2:02:42] above
[2:02:42] in other words if somebody have a
[2:02:45] tendency to
[2:02:46] always think about women what is his
[2:02:48] reward from god
[2:02:52] what portion of god is there from above
[2:02:55] or what inheritance of the almighty from
[2:02:58] on high
[2:02:59] is he not what distraction to the wicked
[2:03:03] in other words
[2:03:04] if your mom is constantly thinking about
[2:03:07] women
[2:03:08] god have a portion for you in heaven but
[2:03:11] that portion is not eternal life
[2:03:13] it is to destroy you
[2:03:17] and a strange punishment to the workers
[2:03:20] of what
[2:03:21] because you know better and you're still
[2:03:23] doing it
[2:03:24] praise the name of the lord psalm 101
[2:03:28] i will behave myself wisely in a perfect
[2:03:31] way this is david
[2:03:33] oh when will that come unto me
[2:03:36] i will walk where not
[2:03:40] outside my house because outside your
[2:03:43] house you can make yourself look
[2:03:44] christian
[2:03:46] but david said when i am in my house
[2:03:49] when there is nobody with me when i am
[2:03:52] alone in my bedroom
[2:03:54] even in my bedroom mama is not there
[2:03:57] that is not there inside my bedroom
[2:04:00] i'm going to behave myself wisely
[2:04:04] are you there because when you are in
[2:04:06] the closed door
[2:04:07] that's when you begin to do things that
[2:04:10] you cannot do outside
[2:04:12] you follow me he said i will walk
[2:04:16] within my house with a what perfect
[2:04:19] heart
[2:04:19] david would you please explain us when
[2:04:22] you get in your house
[2:04:23] when you lock the door when you get in
[2:04:25] your bedroom when you lock the door
[2:04:27] what do you mean by walking with perfect
[2:04:30] eyes
[2:04:31] what do you mean by walking with a
[2:04:32] perfect heart
[2:04:34] what do you mean do you mean that you
[2:04:36] are walking saying perfect perfect
[2:04:38] perfect what are you doing david can you
[2:04:40] give us more
[2:04:41] explanation on what you're doing brother

[2:05:12] telephone

[2:05:17] why david this is psalm 100 and what
[2:05:21] one if you go to psalm 51
[2:05:25] you're gonna see david committed
[2:05:27] adultery
[2:05:28] with bathsheba are you there and he
[2:05:32] repented
[2:05:33] then in psalm 101 50
[2:05:36] some down are you there david now
[2:05:40] learn he said lord i don't want to put
[2:05:43] anything
[2:05:43] wicked in my eyes why is david

[2:05:51] worrying about his house from 51 plus
[2:05:55] 50 give you a 100 on one
[2:05:58] those are the mathematic of the bible
[2:06:00] why is david
[2:06:02] worrying about his eyes let's go to
[2:06:03] first second samuel
[2:06:05] chapter 11
[2:06:09] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[2:06:12] lord
[2:06:15] i'm going very slow
[2:06:18] compared to the speed i thought oh my
[2:06:20] god
[2:06:22] second samuel chapter 11. if you dare
[2:06:24] you can say amen
[2:06:27] few people before you come to church you

[2:06:48] expired
[2:06:50] at the time when kings go forth to
[2:06:52] battle
[2:06:53] that david sent job and his servant with
[2:06:56] him
[2:06:56] and all israel and they destroyed the
[2:06:59] children of ammon

[2:07:04] terry is still at water
[2:07:06] hey jerusalem watch now and we come to
[2:07:10] pass in the evening
[2:07:12] that david arose from his bed david went
[2:07:16] and sat on the table and they gave him
[2:07:18] his meal
[2:07:20] as a king he ate the meal and suddenly
[2:07:23] he got sleepy
[2:07:24] he said i need to go rest a little bit
[2:07:26] the day was a little bit hard today
[2:07:28] and david went and went to bed to rest a
[2:07:30] little bit
[2:07:31] at the evening the innocent david is
[2:07:35] waking up

[2:22:33] me
[2:22:34] god had revealed it to that prophet he
[2:22:38] said david
[2:22:39] there was a rich man live on this side
[2:22:41] of the road
[2:22:42] and had a whole lot of sheep he was a
[2:22:45] rich man
[2:22:46] you can read it dancing very rich
[2:22:50] and one day what a visitor came
[2:22:53] and instead of the rich man taking one
[2:22:55] of his own ship
[2:22:57] and making a what a feast to the visitor
[2:23:00] these are language in the bible and
[2:23:02] we're going to decode them
[2:23:04] well instead of that he went over and
[2:23:07] took the poor man's slave
[2:23:08] and by what force took the lamb and
[2:23:11] slayed it
[2:23:12] go to verse to chapter 12. so you
[2:23:14] understand what he means here
[2:23:18] are you there and the lord said to
[2:23:21] nathan
[2:23:22] said nathan to david and he came to him
[2:23:26] and said to him there was two men in one
[2:23:28] city
[2:23:29] one rich who was the rich man thank you
[2:23:32] and the other poor who is the poor man
[2:23:36] uriah the rich man was exceeding
[2:23:40] many flocks and what in other words he
[2:23:42] have many wives
[2:23:44] 500 but the poor man had nothing saved

[2:27:30] if you want to satisfy according to
[2:27:33] first corinthians 7 let his own man
[2:27:37] has his own wife and let his own wife
[2:27:39] have her own
[2:27:40] husband that's the way you give him the
[2:27:43] feast
[2:27:45] if you satisfy him by fornication
[2:27:48] sin by adultery sin that's why
[2:27:52] brother branham said david should have
[2:27:54] gone to his own
[2:28:00] hallelujah now that was david persians
[2:28:05] he had what 500 wife but when he
[2:28:08] sinned uriah's wife instead of taking
[2:28:12] one of his 500 wife to do what
[2:28:17] to quench the black dog or to
[2:28:21] satisfy his passion he went and took the
[2:28:24] other man's water
[2:28:27] do you follow me what causes it
[2:28:30] by the look of a woman without clothes
[2:28:35] are you following me we can always judge
[2:28:38] the other fellow
[2:28:40] but when it comes to us that is
[2:28:42] different because when they told david
[2:28:44] he got angry are you following me
[2:28:47] david in psalm 119 turn away man eyes
[2:28:51] from beholding water that's why david
[2:28:54] learned he got burned
[2:28:56] pretty bad are you there did he
[2:28:59] learn that i'm not gonna play with his
[2:29:02] eyes
[2:29:03] are you there even when i am in my house
[2:29:07] i'm not gonna open my eye to see
[2:29:09] anything
[2:29:10] because that can cause me trouble like
[2:29:12] he caused a holy by trouble
[2:29:15] to look at things on the wall quicken
[2:29:19] down me
[2:29:19] in that way isaiah 33 verse 15 blessed
[2:29:23] be the name of the lord
[2:29:25] he that walketh what righteously and
[2:29:28] speaketh water
[2:29:31] walking speaking he that despised the
[2:29:33] gain of the oppression
[2:29:35] that shaketh his hand from holding the
[2:29:37] brabs
[2:29:38] that stopped his here from here for
[2:29:41] hearing of blood
[2:29:42] and that do what shatters his eye from
[2:29:46] seeing what
[2:29:47] if this is what you do if you shut your
[2:29:50] eyes from seeing evil
[2:29:52] he shall dwell on what his place of
[2:29:56] defense shall be the munition of the
[2:29:59] the rock of salvation bread shall be
[2:30:01] given to who
[2:30:02] his water shall be watered the night
[2:30:05] shall behold the king in his water

[2:48:23] wear
[2:48:23] a lot of stuff and they don't want
[2:48:25] anybody to tell them
[2:48:26] this is what they use that's the weapon
[2:48:30] for the lord sees not as men what
[2:48:35] for men look from the water
[2:48:38] but the lord looking from the water oh
[2:48:41] my brother
[2:48:42] stop looking at me you can see me like
[2:48:45] this
[2:48:45] god sees my heart it's the scripture
[2:48:49] that people love in the bible when they
[2:48:52] don't want to take paint
[2:48:53] they don't want to take wrong clothes
[2:48:55] they don't want to take all kind of
[2:48:57] stuff when you say
[2:48:58] the lord sees my heart the lord look at
[2:49:00] the heart you can see me like this the
[2:49:02] lord look at the heart
[2:49:03] the lord look at the heart
[2:49:06] let's correct you today
[2:49:10] you ready what god
[2:49:13] was talking about was the face
[2:49:17] and the what god was not talking about
[2:49:21] the cloth
[2:49:25] keep thinking god was not talking about
[2:49:29] the makeups
[2:49:32] keep thinking god was not talking about
[2:49:35] the high heels
[2:49:37] god was not talking about the tight
[2:49:39] dress god was not talking about the
[2:49:42] painting
[2:49:42] god was talking about the choice
[2:49:47] i sent you for choice when i
[2:49:50] sent you for choice don't look at the
[2:49:53] face
[2:49:54] and don't look at the shape
[2:49:59] you follow me from today you are
[2:50:02] disarmed
[2:50:05] are you there you follow me because
[2:50:08] people are quick no no no no no no the
[2:50:09] lord says
[2:50:10] why are you doing this the lord sees
[2:50:12] this young man
[2:50:14] taking her doing all kind of stuff oh no
[2:50:17] no the lord sees my heart
[2:50:19] the lord sees my heart
[2:50:23] in other words the lord is blind to
[2:50:25] everything you can do
[2:50:26] but he only look at your eyes on your
[2:50:29] heart
[2:50:30] world god see
[2:50:36] psalm 22 25 it's a matter of choice
[2:50:40] what man is he that fears the lord him
[2:50:44] shall i do what
[2:50:45] in the way he shall water in other words
[2:50:48] if you want a choice in your life
[2:50:50] you need to go to god that's why
[2:50:54] this was for a choice of the king
[2:50:57] god said don't look don't make choice
[2:51:00] like men
[2:51:01] men look at face at beauty and they look
[2:51:04] at the ship
[2:51:06] and they pick people don't do that i am
[2:51:09] the one who's gonna direct you
[2:51:11] [Music]
[2:51:12] brother steven so if god directs
[2:51:15] the samuel to pick up somebody so that
[2:51:17] person probably is not going to be
[2:51:19] beautiful
[2:51:19] he's going to be ugly that's why because
[2:51:22] men look at beauty so god
[2:51:24] will not pick somebody like that let's
[2:51:25] see what god picks
[2:51:28] and samuel said to jesse i hear all the
[2:51:31] children and he said they remain at
[2:51:33] vietnam
[2:51:34] and behold he keepeth the sheep and
[2:51:37] samuel say unto jesse
[2:51:38] send and fetch him for we will not sit
[2:51:41] down here
[2:51:42] come uh till he comes here done
[2:51:45] and he said and brought him now he was
[2:51:48] what
[2:51:49] right when you look at him
[2:51:53] what is steven you see i told you that's
[2:51:54] the choice of god always the people that
[2:51:56] are now
[2:51:57] attracting me let's see
[2:52:00] now he was ready and we thought of a
[2:52:03] what
[2:52:11] who picked up
[2:52:14] of a beautiful continent and what
[2:52:18] goodly to look on him too
[2:52:21] and the lord said arise and what
[2:52:23] anointing for
[2:52:29] okay we're clear there okay
[2:52:32] samuel and andy ab 17.
[2:52:36] remember elia his eldest brother heard
[2:52:40] when he spoken to the man and ended up
[2:52:43] anger was kingly they guess who
[2:52:46] the one that the prophet taught to pick
[2:52:49] look how he's treating the one that god
[2:52:52] chose
[2:52:54] the one that was supposed to be picked
[2:52:57] by human intellect
[2:52:59] look how he's going to treat the one
[2:53:01] that is chosen by
[2:53:03] divine revelation
[2:53:06] and he said why come here
[2:53:09] and with with whom has that left those
[2:53:12] few sheep in the wilderness
[2:53:14] anoda was david pride
[2:53:19] and the water naughtiness of that heart
[2:53:22] god say that's a man after my own heart
[2:53:26] eliab is calling him he is naughty
[2:53:29] let's see what goliath say about david
[2:53:33] and one day philistine look about and
[2:53:36] saw david
[2:53:36] he did what why he didn't love him
[2:53:42] for the cause that he hated him
[2:53:46] for he was but what
[2:53:49] a youth it's a problem young people they
[2:53:51] therefore don't like you
[2:53:53] and he was water ready and of water
[2:53:57] he didn't like that kind of beauty
[2:54:02] john 7 jesus talking to the pharisees he
[2:54:05] said judge
[2:54:06] not according to the what see brother
[2:54:09] stephen i told you see
[2:54:10] don't judge the appearance jesus also
[2:54:13] say that
[2:54:15] that's fine judge not according to the
[2:54:18] appearance
[2:54:19] but judge righteous judgment john 8 15
[2:54:23] ye judge after the what after the flesh
[2:54:27] human i judge no man
[2:54:31] brother stephen do you look on things
[2:54:34] after the outward what that's human
[2:54:39] john 8 if i judge my judgment is true
[2:54:43] for i am not alone but i and the father
[2:54:46] that what in other words when i
[2:54:49] judge it's the father that will help
[2:54:51] samuel who's judging
[2:54:53] for the father judges no man but has
[2:54:56] committed what
[2:54:58] all judgment time to who and
[2:55:01] he has given him authority to execute
[2:55:04] what
[2:55:05] judgment because he is the son of man
[2:55:09] brother stephen god don't look at people
[2:55:12] on the outside
[2:55:13] fine but he that is what
[2:55:16] spiritual judges what and he himself is
[2:55:20] judged of what
[2:55:22] abstain from all appearance of what
[2:55:26] how can god say don't judge with
[2:55:28] appearance and god say
[2:55:29] abstain from the appearance of evil
[2:55:34] put it together god said don't judge
[2:55:38] but god come he said when you see the
[2:55:40] appearance of evil
[2:55:42] get away from it in other words you're
[2:55:44] judging that
[2:55:45] because a spiritual man judges
[2:55:48] make sense now drop this and then we go
[2:55:52] i always i have been accused of being
[2:55:55] hard on sister
[2:55:57] about wearing bobbed hair and manicure
[2:56:00] all over their face and stuff i have
[2:56:02] been accused of being hard on our sister
[2:56:05] it is not that i got anything against

[2:56:10] woman
