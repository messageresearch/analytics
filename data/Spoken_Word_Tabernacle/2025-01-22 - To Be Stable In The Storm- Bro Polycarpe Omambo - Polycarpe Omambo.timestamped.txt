[0:00] and remember I'm on record for this that
[0:05] any promise of God in the Bible if it's
[0:09] on conditions now just because you
[0:12] believe it's there that don't make it so
[0:14] it'll
[0:15] happen then Pharisees and Sadducees are
[0:18] just as religious with those sacraments
[0:20] as they could be but God said they stink
[0:22] in my
[0:23] nose see there was no sincerity there
[0:27] was nothing to it that should be you've
[0:29] got to come upon basical promise and
[0:33] then upon your mental attitude towards
[0:35] you look at those uh 400 priests that
[0:38] day are prophets Ahab had out there they
[0:41] said ramoth Gilead belongs to us Joshua
[0:44] by the Holy Spirit divided this and the
[0:47] syrians has got it and one Prophet said
[0:51] now look here that's fundamentally right
[0:53] now he was a real Baptist and he said
[0:55] that's exactly right that's the
[0:57] fundamental prop promise that land
[1:00] belongs to us so he made him two big
[1:01] horns and said go up there and take
[1:03] these horns and push sah Plum off that
[1:05] belongs to Israel that's land

[30:47] like Precious Faith father as We Gather
[30:49] Lord in this little place that you've
[30:51] given to us
[30:53] father and Lord just the things you do
[30:57] father and the things that you show us
[30:59] and the things that you tell us is just
[31:02] are like I heard a brother the other day
[31:04] that our human Minds it's hard to wrap
[31:08] those things around us just like you've
[31:11] been telling us we are
[31:13] gods and Lord the human mind may not be
[31:16] able to comprehend that father but you
[31:19] put something in us that goes beyond the
[31:22] human
[31:23] mind you put a faith there father that
[31:26] six sense that we can reach out there
[31:29] and grab that because it's your word
[31:32] father and your word does not return to
[31:35] you
[31:36] void and father as we see Lord the the
[31:40] manifestation father that is taking
[31:42] place in the world and Lord as we're as
[31:47] as we are becoming father what you want

[32:02] back into eternity
[32:04] again and Lord we just thank you for it
[32:08] father we know Lord that that things are
[32:12] are transpiring very rapidly because you
[32:15] told us through your Prophet that things
[32:18] would manifest very rapidly father and
[32:22] Lord as I was sitting here listening to

[41:40] that comes in that provides the honey
[41:41] that he gets from his bees and I
[41:44] overheard him telling one of my
[41:45] co-workers about a week or two ago um
[41:48] when I first started that he I believe
[41:51] it's his uncle he said it was his uncle
[41:54] that over new years's was riding a
[41:56] fourwheeler in fell off and broke his
[41:59] neck or I don't remember what he broke
[42:00] but it completely paralyzed from the

[42:07] said I heard you talking a few weeks ago

[42:20] praying for him I've been praying for
[42:21] your uncle and um he started to walk

[1:01:48] Jesus is in the
[1:01:51] boat you will notice where we
[1:01:54] read Jesus was in the the
[1:01:57] boat and when he was in the
[1:02:00] boat he was
[1:02:03] sleeping if Jesus was
[1:02:08] sleeping that also says that Peter was
[1:02:10] also
[1:02:13] tired Jesus was doing
[1:02:20] sleeping meaning the disciples were also
[1:02:23] tired why was Jesus sleeping
[1:02:28] because they were taking a long
[1:02:31] journey he told them let's go to the
[1:02:33] other
[1:02:34] side and from the other
[1:02:37] side there was a
[1:02:40] fool Not only was this man a
[1:02:45] fool but he was also a pagan a
[1:02:49] heathen but as you already
[1:02:52] know Jesus had already started with the
[1:02:54] Jew
[1:02:56] and then to the
[1:02:58] nation who are us the
[1:03:01] bride and Jesus was with the
[1:03:05] Jew he was with the
[1:03:10] Believers but now he had to go look for
[1:03:12] the
[1:03:13] Heathen this
[1:03:16] fool that's why he said let us go to the
[1:03:19] other side amen
[1:03:21] amen and then Jesus was
[1:03:24] tired says you already know the
[1:03:28] storm the
[1:03:32] storm storms or
[1:03:35] events that
[1:03:38] happens when someone is
[1:03:42] tired when the enemy is
[1:03:44] approaching when the enemy wants to
[1:03:46] attack
[1:03:48] you the enemy won't attack you when you
[1:03:50] have
[1:03:52] strength it's only when you're tired
[1:03:56] it's the time the darkest time of your
[1:03:59] life that the enemy will come to combat
[1:04:01] you and that's what
[1:04:05] happened Jesus was
[1:04:07] sleeping he was with his
[1:04:11] disciples and then water got into the
[1:04:14] boat
[1:04:16] now the disciples weren't scared of the
[1:04:20] water but now when the wind starts to
[1:04:23] blow the storm
[1:04:27] that's when they start being
[1:04:29] scared and Peter
[1:04:31] said we cannot
[1:04:34] perish I have to wake up the master
[1:04:38] amen they said master
[1:04:40] master we're
[1:04:43] perish waking him
[1:04:47] up he was menacing the wind and the
[1:04:51] waters that were
[1:04:54] calm and the
[1:04:56] return and then he told them where is
[1:05:00] your
[1:05:01] faith you will notice
[1:05:04] here Jesus Christ he spoke to the wind
[1:05:08] he spoke to
[1:05:10] the and now he's also speaking to
[1:05:14] Peter he said what did Peter do
[1:05:17] Jesus I'm asking Jesus what did Peter
[1:05:21] do because you said to pray non nonstop
[1:05:27] now Peter was in
[1:05:29] prayer what he did was simply to wake
[1:05:32] you
[1:05:33] up and Jesus reproached
[1:05:37] him what did Jesus reproach
[1:05:42] Peter because Peter had ignored the
[1:05:44] presence of
[1:05:47] Jesus Jesus said let's go to the other
[1:05:50] side just like you this evening I don't
[1:05:54] know what Jesus had told you
[1:05:56] [Music]
[1:05:57] maybe he promised you a job maybe he
[1:06:00] promised you education maybe he promised
[1:06:02] you a
[1:06:05] wedding when he promises
[1:06:07] you it's all the way to the end amen
[1:06:12] amen and Jesus is not in the detail when
[1:06:17] he tells you
[1:06:18] something he's not into the details amen
[1:06:22] amen that's what Jesus had told them
[1:06:25] let's go to the other
[1:06:27] side he did not say that there will be
[1:06:30] storm or or wind amen
[1:06:35] amen and Peter had forgotten the power
[1:06:38] of the presence of Jesus
[1:06:41] [Music]
[1:06:43] Christ Peter was in the middle of the
[1:06:46] performance of
[1:06:51] Christ if Peter had recognized the power
[1:06:54] of His presence
[1:07:03] he would don't realize there's no way
[1:07:05] that Jesus could have
[1:07:08] drowned because Jesus had said
[1:07:14] this I came here so you may have
[1:07:17] life and life in
[1:07:21] abundance and now you're in front of him
[1:07:26] and you have fear for
[1:07:29] death but his word was before that I
[1:07:33] came to give you life and this life in
[1:07:37] abundance then you have to believe in

[1:23:19] soon may God be worshiped
[1:23:29] you need to have water in your
[1:23:32] soul you remember in John chapter 4
[1:23:36] verse 1
[1:23:39] to9 it speaks about the Samaritan
[1:23:43] woman the woman that well was with Jesus
[1:23:45] and you know the
[1:23:46] story when Jesus was talking to her when
[1:23:49] Jesus was talking to her when Jesus was
[1:23:51] talking to her and what had happened
[1:23:56] was she did not draw water from
[1:23:59] somewhere
[1:24:00] else because Jesus had said if you
[1:24:04] believe in
[1:24:05] me there will be rivers of flowing
[1:24:10] [Music]
[1:24:12] water what rivers will not come out of
[1:24:14] your house or from your
[1:24:17] neighborhood no neither from your
[1:24:21] community neither from your surrounding
[1:24:25] but from within you from within
[1:24:29] you meaning you have to arrive at that
[1:24:38] level if you believe like how the Bible
[1:24:41] says rivers of
[1:24:46] water rivers of water will flow in your
[1:24:50] belly not from your
[1:24:52] house not from your surrounding
[1:24:55] but from within
[1:24:57] you may God be
[1:25:02] worshiped but from your very
[1:25:06] essence the soul of human the human soul
[1:25:10] will become a
[1:25:11] rock may God be
[1:25:15] worshiped The Rock had nothing special
[1:25:19] listen our
[1:25:21] Rock he had nothing special
[1:25:24] The Rock has nothing
[1:25:27] special but God who is the Living
[1:25:30] Water who was flowing through the
[1:25:33] rock it's like here in this
[1:25:36] church we have our
[1:25:38] pastor there's nothing special in our
[1:25:41] pastor but God who is the Living
[1:25:44] Water who enters into the pastor and
[1:25:48] when he's
[1:25:49] standing there's Mysteries
[1:25:56] one
[1:25:57] verse can be preached from months and
[1:26:01] months a source
[1:26:05] that a source an unlimited Source
[1:26:08] because there's a source inside there
[1:26:10] because that Source inside there you
[1:26:11] cannot um pull it from your neighborhood
[1:26:14] like I said because it's within
[1:26:19] you may God be worshiped
[1:26:25] there's nothing special in the
[1:26:27] Rock it's
[1:26:29] water it's God who was the living
[1:26:34] water in the um in the
[1:26:37] Rock I will read a bit of the
[1:26:42] Prophet to see something
[1:26:48] here in 1960 Elijah and offering

[1:27:11] lord it's not going to rain or even do
[1:27:15] will
[1:27:18] fall until you call until you call fre
[1:27:21] give it unto into Elijah's mouth to call
[1:27:24] for the
[1:27:25] rain when he when it was
[1:27:28] time but he but he had the keys of
[1:27:32] heaven he could close it or open it he
[1:27:37] said I want you to go up out of the
[1:27:41] Wilderness of this into the
[1:27:44] Wilderness you see it's God who has sent

[1:27:49] Wilderness you find yourself in the
[1:27:52] wilderness you find yourself in in the
[1:27:59] storm and you're trying to find a
[1:28:01] solution
[1:28:02] yourself but look at the person who put
[1:28:04] you in that
[1:28:05] situation stop trying to find the
[1:28:07] solution by

[1:29:19] you're saying it's him who will bless me
[1:29:24] God has a provision in places that are
[1:29:29] unexpected look at how he's nurturing
[1:29:34] feeding through the
[1:29:36] Ravens who made
[1:29:41] food it was God
[1:29:44] himself and the crosss came to him gave
[1:29:48] it to
[1:29:51] him I want to read something else in in
[1:29:54] the
[1:29:58] prophet I can jump certain
[1:30:06] things okay
[1:30:20] [Music]
[1:30:22] continue God can do what he wants to he
[1:30:25] said I've commanded the Ravens and
[1:30:28] they're going to feed you and they
[1:30:30] brought him flesh and
[1:30:32] bread you
[1:30:35] see it wasn't a

[1:31:19] same place that Jesus did when he took
[1:31:22] five five fish five biscuit and two fish
[1:31:26] and fed 5,000 it come from the same
[1:31:29] creative hand of God
[1:31:36] Almighty they brought him fish and
[1:31:42] [Music]
[1:31:51] bread the crow sat down and hand it over
[1:31:54] to Elijah and he ate it and stooped down
[1:31:58] and drank from the fountain God was
[1:32:01] resting his
[1:32:07] Prophet oh I'm so glad that God has a
[1:32:10] way of
[1:32:11] escape and when they thought he was
[1:32:15] crazy that old prophet and old kill Joy
[1:32:26] [Music]
[1:32:28] always trying to take the joy out of
[1:32:30] their of their little happy parties they
[1:32:33] were
[1:32:35] having telling them that there telling
[1:32:38] them that it was
[1:32:41] sin and God dot dot dot
[1:32:44] [Music]
[1:32:51] [Music]
[1:32:55] him following God's commission went into
[1:32:57] the mountains and sat down on the high
[1:33:00] place the drest place in the
[1:33:05] [Music]
[1:33:08] country but God kept the Brook
[1:33:16] running and they were down there knowing
[1:33:19] their their tongue for water
[1:33:30] look how God his servant or
[1:33:33] you somewhere over there in a dry
[1:33:39] place and God is
[1:33:42] capable he has
[1:33:44] resources
[1:33:46] everywhere he can bless you he can do
[1:33:49] everything for
[1:33:51] you he is capable
[1:33:58] we will jump
[1:34:02] something in paragraph 42 the prophet
[1:34:05] says
[1:34:06] this you
[1:34:10] know there we could get a lesson from
[1:34:17] that that if you have prayed and met all
[1:34:20] the requirements that God requires you
[1:34:22] to and he and still he silent he doesn't
[1:34:26] say
[1:34:31] anything and yet you've met the
[1:34:35] requirements now what happens
[1:34:47] then if you know that you have met his
[1:34:50] requirements and you've done all that
[1:34:52] you know to do then Faith doesn't
[1:34:58] waver it just sits still and thinks
[1:35:04] positive Faith takes Everlasting grip
[1:35:07] around the Rock of
[1:35:09] Ages and doesn't
[1:35:12] [Music]
[1:35:14] move that great fellow called
[1:35:19] Faith I've often said Faith got hair on
[1:35:23] the chest
[1:35:25] when he
[1:35:26] speaks everything else shuts
[1:35:29] up when faith says shut up then
[1:35:33] everything
[1:35:34] stops because he's the
[1:35:36] [Music]
[1:35:37] [Applause]
[1:35:43] boss and she had met every
[1:35:47] requirement she had lived clean she had
[1:35:51] lived she lived honorably
[1:35:56] and she had met all of God's
[1:35:59] requirements but look like he was
[1:36:05] silent God does that sometimes to
[1:36:09] T to see what kind of reaction you'll
[1:36:12] have don't forget
[1:36:18] it that's how God had put job in Trials
[1:36:21] amen amen
[1:36:24] he had po job in
[1:36:27] child he offered sacrifices for his
[1:36:30] children for those that are
[1:36:34] prophets it was a
[1:36:38] holocaust but it was everything that God
[1:36:40] had
[1:36:42] asked he ped
[1:36:45] job to see what of reaction he will see
[1:36:48] from
[1:36:51] Jo maybe God can give you a husband or a
[1:36:54] wife or children or something and then
[1:36:57] something
[1:37:00] happens you start thinking maybe it's
[1:37:02] this is this man this husband this wife
[1:37:06] that doesn't have a
[1:37:08] head maybe this person when they were
[1:37:11] engaged with you they didn't have their
[1:37:12] mind they didn't have a
[1:37:18] head meaning he put job into
[1:37:22] trials to see his
[1:37:26] reaction he would find in
[1:37:29] him but when he took his sheep and took
[1:37:32] his ox and took his
[1:37:35] camels and took his children I'll see
[1:37:38] what job says now now listen to the
[1:37:40] answer and he said the lord gave and the
[1:37:44] Lord taken away blessed be the name of
[1:37:47] the
[1:37:48] [Applause]
[1:37:52] Lord God be
[1:38:01] praised will come down a bit
[1:38:04] to
[1:38:09] close as you
[1:38:14] know Jesus Hado reproached
[1:38:21] Peter because in Luke chapter
[1:38:26] 10 verse
[1:38:29] 19 Jesus had
[1:38:31] said I will give you
[1:38:34] power I have given you
[1:38:37] power to walk upon the and
[1:38:42] Scorpion
[1:38:44] and and all the powers of the enemy and
[1:38:47] nothing
[1:38:48] shall and nothing shall by any means
[1:38:51] hurt you Propet
[1:38:55] now the prophet said why was the Holy
[1:38:57] Spirit
[1:38:58] given in paragraph 55 he says
[1:39:03] this he gave them the power against
[1:39:06] unclean
[1:39:08] spirits God had given you power over
[1:39:13] sin any type of abomination God had
[1:39:16] given you power against sin against
[1:39:19] failure against
[1:39:21] sickness against any type of
[1:39:24] situation when you find yourself in
[1:39:26] front of a storm why are you
[1:39:30] panicking just use the
[1:39:33] power just use the
[1:39:36] power refuse rebuke everything that you
[1:39:39] have to
[1:39:42] rebuke rebuke anything that the enemy
[1:39:45] May propose to
[1:39:46] [Music]
[1:39:46] [Applause]
[1:39:49] you and speak to existence anything that
[1:39:51] you can speak to existence
[1:39:54] because God
[1:39:58] said we're in the time like the pastor
[1:40:00] says
[1:40:04] here we're in the time where the Earth
[1:40:08] speaks and then the heaven
[1:40:11] executes he
[1:40:13] said everything that you will tie bound
[1:40:16] on
[1:40:17] Earth it's not the heavens that will
[1:40:19] bind
[1:40:22] it you're just circling
[1:40:25] around just because you're waiting for
[1:40:27] heaven to react for
[1:40:29] you you waiting for heaven to bind it
[1:40:32] for you when he already gave you the
[1:40:35] power he gave men the
[1:40:38] power that we are Gods he said that y
[1:40:42] are
[1:40:44] Gods why are you waiting for Heavens to
[1:40:48] bind
[1:40:49] it while you're waiting for heaven to
[1:40:52] open
[1:40:55] why Heaven is the one waiting for you
[1:40:58] it's saying what is this child why is
[1:41:00] this child does not know his position
[1:41:03] because we're ready to execute heav said
[1:41:06] we're ready to come down we're ready to
[1:41:09] come down we're waiting to come
[1:41:12] down because there's
[1:41:15] power and he said everything that you
[1:41:17] will
[1:41:18] bind without
[1:41:21] exceptions everything that you will
[1:41:24] bind the heavens will say
[1:41:27] amen and the prophet has
[1:41:31] said he had given them power against
[1:41:34] unclean spirits they went
[1:41:37] out he put their names in the Lamb's
[1:41:40] books of
[1:41:42] life and he sent them
[1:41:44] out John or Matthew 10 he gave them the
[1:41:48] power over unclean spirit
[1:41:50] [Music]
[1:41:53] it's where we read recently in Luke
[1:41:56] chapter 10
[1:41:58] 19 casting casting out evil spirits and
[1:42:01] do works and so
[1:42:04] forth and they came and they come back
[1:42:07] rejoicing said even the Devils is
[1:42:11] subject to
[1:42:14] us see God have given
[1:42:17] power and I will
[1:42:21] close God had given us power
[1:42:25] against our
[1:42:26] enemy he said our enemies will be our
[1:42:30] [Music]
[1:42:32] first why do we not want to use that
[1:42:37] power when we returning to say
[1:42:41] Genesis in the
[1:42:47] beginning you notice when Adam and Eve
[1:42:50] had
[1:42:52] fallen Jesus had came
[1:42:54] down God had came
[1:42:57] down and he started calling them he said
[1:43:00] where are
[1:43:02] you and they were
[1:43:05] hidden and they say we have
[1:43:08] sinned and he said who told you that you
[1:43:10] were
[1:43:13] naked he said who had told you that you
[1:43:15] were
[1:43:17] naked and look at
[1:43:19] something together with me in the Bible
[1:43:25] every
[1:43:26] tree when the man had
[1:43:30] sinned every tree had dried
[1:43:33] up every tree was dried
[1:43:35] up but there was a
[1:43:38] tree that had worked with
[1:43:48] men that had given men um leaves to
[1:43:52] cover themselves to make clothes it was
[1:43:54] a fake
[1:43:56] tree every other
[1:43:58] tree when man had sinned it was
[1:44:02] dried
[1:44:03] amen but are you understanding what I'm
[1:44:06] saying and in the New
[1:44:08] Testament when Jesus had came he saw the
[1:44:12] Fig
[1:44:13] Tree he saw the fig tree with the
[1:44:17] leaf it was a rematch amen amen
[1:44:23] God remembered that match that old
[1:44:26] match that you in the Garden of
[1:44:29] Eden when it was not the time to give
[1:44:34] clothes
[1:44:36] you you had provided clothes to my
[1:44:39] children now you shall give me
[1:44:43] fruit season or no season you will give
[1:44:46] me
[1:44:47] fruit and the Bible says it was not even
[1:44:51] the time of the of the season of
[1:44:58] figs and the Fig Tree had ignored that
[1:45:01] Jesus is the season that that a season
[1:45:04] is a
[1:45:05] person where there is the
[1:45:08] sun that's where the fruits
[1:45:10] are that's why Peter had fish all
[1:45:14] night he
[1:45:17] thought probably it was a different
[1:45:19] season a different period but it was not
[1:45:23] the
[1:45:25] period but when the person who's called
[1:45:28] season has stepped in has said throw
[1:45:31] cast out
[1:45:32] your cast out your net and he caught
[1:45:36] fish and now we're returning to the
[1:45:40] Fig and Jesus had
[1:45:43] said you in a
[1:45:47] time before we could have given man
[1:45:50] clothes you had provided them clothes
[1:45:54] now I shall curse
[1:45:55] you that's why he had cursed the Fig
[1:45:59] there was not another tree that Jesus
[1:46:01] had cursed it was only the fake tree
[1:46:03] that he had
[1:46:04] cursed because the fake tree had perit
[1:46:08] himself to serve
[1:46:09] man while every other tree was dried up
[1:46:13] and when Jesus had came he
[1:46:15] said to his
[1:46:17] disciples you had
[1:46:21] seen when he was giving
[1:46:24] recommendation how the world has treated
[1:46:28] me I am the
[1:46:32] tree and y'all are dried up
[1:46:36] tree you have to very be paying
[1:46:40] attention you have to be careful
[1:46:42] wherever you will
[1:46:45] be him who was the Green
[1:46:49] Tree he came to
[1:46:51] save to save
[1:46:54] us who are dried up
[1:46:56] trees that's why what he had
[1:47:01] carried it was just not it
[1:47:04] wasn't it wasn't a ready tree it was a
[1:47:08] dried up
[1:47:10] tree you will notice on the
[1:47:17] cross he was he was put up on a dried
[1:47:21] tree
[1:47:23] because he came to die for
[1:47:25] us we were
[1:47:28] dried when it pierced his
[1:47:31] side blood had came
[1:47:33] out that blood that came
[1:47:36] out it touched the wooden the dried wood
[1:47:40] it touched the
[1:47:42] cross I was looking for if we had a
[1:47:49] cross and then the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:47:55] it was dried up in the
[1:47:58] wood it was dried up from his
[1:48:00] body they had separated
[1:48:03] him from the
[1:48:06] wood they buried
[1:48:09] him three days on the third day on the
[1:48:12] third day he
[1:48:15] resurrected that me the life that was
[1:48:17] out of
[1:48:19] Jesus it was it came back
[1:48:23] that blood that was also in the tree is
[1:48:26] also what gives us life also in his
[1:48:29] resurrection that's why we have life
[1:48:31] that we also have victory that mean also
[1:48:34] this evening we also have
[1:48:36] Victory we also have
[1:48:39] power in every aspect of our life in
[1:48:42] every
[1:48:43] situation in every problem that we have
[1:48:46] we have
[1:48:47] power it's up to us to speak the word
[1:48:51] because the heaven is for us what we
[1:48:54] shall speak what we shall
[1:48:58] bind I don't know about
[1:49:00] you
[1:49:03] but but doesn't matter the storm that
[1:49:06] you're going through the master is in
[1:49:09] the

[1:50:35] congratulation my
[1:50:41] friend amen the Fig Tree provided the
[1:50:45] clothing when it was not time for the
[1:50:47] clothing and God asked the Fig Tree to

[1:51:25] water and he also rebuked his disciple
[1:51:28] and the reason why he rebuked them
[1:51:30] because he already gave them power
