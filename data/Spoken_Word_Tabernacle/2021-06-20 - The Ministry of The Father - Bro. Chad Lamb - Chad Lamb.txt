fulfilled amen blessed be the name of the lord happy father's days to all the father amen blessed be the name of the lord we appreciate everybody especially this church for your support for the wedding and many many special thanks to brother chad lamb and to your family traveling way up there amen coming all the way here i don't know how to express my gratitude but from the bottom of our heart we really thank you for this big great sacrifice i'm a pastor and i usually want to stick with my church and be there amen i was supposed to be maybe somewhere but i'm here this morning amen so i understand when a pastor an established one for a long time can leave the church and travel all the way and come here just to support us god richly bless you for everything and many thanks to you amen amen so as usually we only have one service so no pressure on the minister sooner we're going to get in a building and you're going to have sunday schools and everything else so you got to get used to it a little bit amen you got used to one service one service without sunday school once we get in the building sunday school is included amen because now we have the place to do it so brother chadland will take his liberty brother chad this is not a new church this is home for you amen if you don't have a place to go somewhere just remember there is home in north carolina for you amen always if you don't have anywhere just remember there is home here so you preach like homer there is a boat there you thought your pastor is a teacher you wait [Laughter] amen amen you're gonna hear a true anointed teacher by the grace of god all the glory goes to jesus but we want to acknowledge one another amen brother branham say you don't wait till somebody's passed away before you cast your flower you give it to him when he's alive amen amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and he's one of the special one because he went exactly through what we went every experience we went through he went before it and trust me he's the one who told me things and it happened exactly the way he wanted me he told me i won't call him a prophet before somebody say i call him a prophet anyway a new testament preacher is a prophet [Laughter] if you need a quote on that one i can give it to you amen yes so he knows what we went through he's here standing with us he understand the pain and the suffering and the lord lets the holy spirit take his liberty and let him preach his heart out just like his home amen pull on the gift of the lord and i believe the god who orchestrate everything and who work everything according to the council of his own will knew that today he's going to be with us let's sing only believe [Music] oh lay believe hallelujah [Music] only believe all things are possible but each other only believe it or not thank you [Music] amen praise the lord thank you musicians i just want to say it's a pleasure to be here with you this morning amen we want to greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ my family and i i was privileged to have my wife travel with me and my children at least four of my five our oldest is married now and he's back home but he couldn't make it but they don't usually travel anywhere with me because most of my travels have been overseas so it's been a blessing to have him here we bring you greetings from the home church as well and just want to say thank you for all your hospitality you've treated us really well you've said some kind things that have really encouraged and blessed us we want to thank brother stephen and his wife sharon for their hospitality and their generosity and their blessings and sister lorell for all the good cooking we've been well fed amen i hope we can give a little back this morning amen for you sure fed us good i also want to say happy father's day to all the fathers amen father's day is a it's just a thing that somebody made up along the way but you know what we have a father [Music] and for that we're all grateful amen and we all have the same father and that's what makes us part of the same family [Music] and so the world can say what they want about father's day and do what they want about father's day but i had a father before the foundation of the world before i had an earthly father i had a heavenly father he will always be my father my maker my husband my lover my all in all amen while we're standing if we could turn to the book of genesis and let's just get right into the word the most difficult part of this for me is saying hello and getting started the easiest part is when we go to the word amen and god starts working so i'm always eager to go to the word amen i see some ministers they're so smooth and they're so comfortable greeting people saying hello and i say oh god i can't do that amen i just want to go to the word that's when i'm comfortable so bear with me god bless you all in genesis chapter 3 verse 6. this morning i'd like to preach on the ministry of the father the ministry of the father genesis chapter 3 verse 6. and the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise and she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also into her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself let's just bow our heads and ask the lord's blessing over his word dear lord jesus we thank you for this privilege to be here god god may the gathering of the saints never become a tradition may it never become formalized out of and become a habit may it always be precious to us lord something we value something we set aside our time something we arrange our whole week around because lord this is a opportunity we may not always have but while we have it lord let us take advantage of it and come with a fresh desire with a fresh expectation lord coming to this service as as if it were the last lord that we would have may we receive from you all that you have for us today god i pray you take this vessel in your hand and use it as a tool for the ministry of your word may it be you lord who breaks the bread of life and may our eyes come open at the breaking of the bread and may we recognize it was you lord lord i pray that you would take control of the service and have preeminence that you would be pleased with all that we say in all that we do in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can be seated before we we go any further stay in this scripture because we're going to deal with this scripture for just a little while but you know as uh brother stephen was saying that we've went through some similar things your assembly and our assembly and um we understand you know we're we're far enough down the road that we can look back with a different perspective than we had when we were in the middle of our trouble and we're just a few years further down than you may be but god has brought you down the same path and really when when tragedy struck and we have a pastor who we have confidence in and love not didn't hate the man loved him respected him wanted him to be right we wanted him to be right we wanted him to be our brother but when he left the word we had to stay with the word and we didn't realize as we were sitting under that atmosphere of unbelief we didn't realize what it was doing to us we didn't realize the the lethargy that had come in and the apathy and the compromise and it was like the frog and the kettle you know he goes in and the water's comfortable and keeps turning it up and he's he's dying and he doesn't know it he just becomes accustomed to it and gets used to it but god will not let his bride be manhandled this this is not like any other age this age is different than any age that's been before because god prophesied he will present to himself a bride without spot or wrinkle and you realize that bride has no ability to present herself without spot a wrinkle because she's coming to this life in a fallen condition she's come compromised to begin with and in the flesh in our human spirit and in our mind we're prone to compromise we come a perverted way and we're prone to the perversion and in every age it went the same way god brought a fresh word he gathered the elect to that word amen and then fallen spirits begin to come in and begin to pervert the word and bring the church into formalism and move them away from the word and it happened first age second age third age fourth age fifth age six age it even happened in the seventh age to the pentecostal revival but in this age something was going to change to make sure that never happened again and now the bridegroom himself was going to come and the bridegroom is here and the presence of the bridegroom ensures that this bride will not be manhandled like before she will not fall in the same cycle the cycles broken by the presence of the bridegroom amen the prophet of god told us this message will not denominate but it doesn't mean there's not denominational spirits all around the message but the message is christ and you can't denominate christ [Applause] [Music] so so what we realized happened to us is we were eagles in a cage and we didn't know it our wings had been clipped because when you clip away the word you clip away our power because what was the power that lifts the eagles two great wings the new and the old testament the word of god and we will fly on the word of god amen and as you trim the word you start trimming the power to fly and our and as the word was trimmed here we didn't notice it at first and then another trimming and we did and before we realized that we were back on the post in the barnyard and we thought we were okay because we were still higher than the chickens but we're not supposed to be on the post in the barnyard just a little higher than the chickens we're supposed to be in the heavenlies above the clouds above the storms flying by the power of god in this age where no storm can touch us amen where nothing can happen because we're we're in his presence so what we thought was a a difficult time what we thought was terrible we look back and say it's wonderful it is the best thing that's ever happened to us and we've went through all of the emotions and all of the things that go along with that the the disappointment the grief the separation separation of friendship separation of those that you love the hardship that goes with that we even went through the resentment and the thing is you have to be honest with yourself we even went through the criticism we we became critics of others critics of those who would stay critics of those who would say things critics we became we went through criticism where we were the critics we went through uh anger and frustration and resentment but but we come to a place where we we realize god rescued us and brought us out but we look back almost with disdain and disgust on those who caused us problems and those who who separated from us until we got to the point where we realized the whole time i had 1200 sermons the whole time that was happening the whole time my wings were being clipped the whole time i became a lazy christian i became i fell into compromise i can't blame anybody i had the message i had 1200 books and tapes i could listen amen i i could receive from the source amen i can't blame anybody else it's nobody's fault it's my fault i became lazy it was my fault amen i was in compromise it was my fault amen and when i finally got over the resentment and passed the pain and to the point where i could really repent for my part then that's when god totally set me free amen now there's no more anger no more resentment no hard feelings amen no more pain we're just as free and happy and whole and healed because i realized it was my fault i can't blame anybody else it was me and when i finally come to a repentance and recognized it was me and fell on my face and asked god to forgive me forgive me for letting down on the word forgive me for not following my instincts forgive me for making excuses for others forgive me for getting laxed on the word forgive me for getting laxed in my holiness when i come to repentance god finally broke that chain because if you have resentment and regret and hurt feelings you're still attached to the one who hurt you and they still have a measure of control over you but when you can come to repent and recognize it's not brother so and so it's not this one it's not a form of this it was me god forgive me and then god can break that chain because you can forgive all of them because you realize it wasn't them god was dealing with me he wanted me to go higher he wanted me to be free he wanted me to come to him this was all about god dealing with me and now i can say god bless you you've helped me i'm not angry i'm not hurt not upset no resentment now i'm just happy and i pray god is doing the same for you that you can just be happy happy where you don't have to rehearse the old hurt and go over and over and over don't worry about who's saying this and who's saying that i don't care because my lord's now speaking to me amen that's the only voice i want to hear amen there's critics there's always been critics thank god for the critics [Music] there are those who fall away thank god for those who fall away evil spirits get in among men and begin to pervert and compromise the pureness of this word thank god because if that didn't follow this message this message wouldn't be christ because that followed every true revival of god and every true word of god had spirits that tried to pervert it had people who would fall away had those who had become critics and if it's not here then this isn't christ so the very presence of critics and men falling away and fallen spirits trying to come in and change the word and pervert it amen the very presence of that is evidence to you that this message is true and it is the word of god so instead of being upset about that get really happy about that that's all vindicating that what i believe is the truth there's no reason to be upset when god's on the throne there's no reason to be upset when he orders your steps when he's watched your way when he wants to deal with you bring you through something to open your eyes like they've never been open before bring you through something to lift you up higher than you've ever been before remember there was a storm one time that blew an eagle down brother branham was in colorado and he saw there was a storm and it blew an eagle down and that eagle was down but that eagle didn't stay down and while he was there the chatter of the chipmunk the chatter of the squirrel chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter he just looked he looked over at the hunter and the hunter says i have a gun i can kill you he just looked and brother ben said what makes that eagle so calm said shortly he began to stretch out those wings he began to realize the word is still here the word of god is still here the whole word from genesis to revelation the whole mind of god is still here i still have the power to fly away from the hunter and fly away from the chatter and go back where i was before the storm blew me down [Applause] so all i can say is be happy just be happy thank god amen it's a good day to be alive friends realize you didn't rescue yourself you didn't choose the word the word chose you you're here because the word chose you you only have the capacity to choose the word because the word first chose you because you're part of the word it's not what you've done it's what he did for you no pride can enter in here because we didn't do anything if i had been left to myself i would be in ruin but god didn't leave it to myself the bridegroom was here to make sure he said no more you're coming back praise god so god is good friends we love him for what he's done for us we're thankful for what he's done for you and i just tell you these are the best days to be on this earth there's not been a better time prophets and wise men have longed to see your day but god has chose you don't waste time being upset be happy let's look back here at genesis chapter 3 in genesis chapter 3 verse 6 we know we we all know this so well and i've been going over this so much at home it's almost the scripture i start with almost every time i preach now because brother venom said everything started in genesis everything everything you find for the rest of the bible started in genesis and here god had one commandment for man is not to touch not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the serpent comes along and he begins to beguile the woman and the woman has the commandment of god she has the word of god but he begins to ask questions and everybody always thinks it's safe to ask questions but it depends on the motive of the one asking the question some questions are just they're just deception in disguise and that was the serpent's question to eve it was deception in disguise it wasn't a sincere question he was asking a question to test her to see if there's an open door here that's why brother branham said we don't have to answer the devil's questions when we get under the that that worldly layout to see an anointing thinking that we have to be the answer man to answer every question you're going to get caught in the trap of deception because brother branham said we don't have to answer the devil's questions they come and ask jesus a question one time to lay a trap for him and he says answer my question first was john the baptist was he son of god or of man they couldn't answer the question he says well neither do i answer your question so we don't have to answer the devil's question but but eve got sucked into that trap where she felt like she had to have an answer and she didn't have a good answer so she began to look at the tree before the tree had been there how long the tree had been there i don't know but the tree was there amen that that that opportunity for failure was there amen but up to this time it doesn't it doesn't appear that she had given it consideration because she had the word of god but now the question of the devil causes her to look to that tree and when she looks to the tree now she she looks and she said the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be desired to make one wise god never said that that wasn't true god never said it wasn't pleasant to the eyes all of those things may have been true he just said don't eat it he didn't say it was ugly he didn't say it was bad he didn't say it wasn't good for wisdom what she saw what she saw was true and once she saw she began to reason she began to reason she looked at the tree in her own mind her own reasoning and she couldn't see anything wrong with it it's good for food it's pleasant to the eyes a tree to be desired to make one wise what's wrong with it what's wrong with it is it's contrary to the word [Applause] whether you understand it whether it makes sense whether you can answer the question whether you can look at it and see what's wrong with it it doesn't matter it's contrary to the word and if it's contrary to the word it brings death not life why can't i wear this and why can't i do that and why can't i and everybody wants an answer the answer is it's contrary to the word but i saw this and i don't see what's wrong with that and i don't understand and how can this harm me what's so wrong with it it looks good i see others partake of it and they're not dying it was contrary to the word and so she began by reasoning to consider the tree she wasn't supposed to consider and when she and herself couldn't find anything wrong with it she partook of the tree she gave to her husband also with her and he did also verse seven and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and brother brother banham says in the message conference he said all the hour the tremendous time that we're living when men is told of their error instead of trying to come back and say father i'm wrong forgive me they still hide behind the fig leaves fig leaves is what they sewed together themselves and that the word religion means a covering and they tried to make themselves a handmade covering and man hasn't changed yet what they did now after they partook of this tree we know that they partook of sexuality sexual relations and so what did they make they took a fiddle leaves and they sewed the fig leaves together and they made themselves a covering to cover their nakedness is that right so they're now man is now making his own covering to cover his own sin and this is the foundation of religion religion started right here with adam when adam tried to make his own religion his own covering to cover his sin and he took something that god had made god did god make the fig leaf he took something that god had made and he plucked it off and changed the purpose that god gave it for and brought it into his own purpose and he made a religion out of it and he made a covering for himself made an apron to cover himself with his own idea but listen to verse 8 and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord how did adam know that the presence of the lord was there did he see god no he heard his voice when he heard his voice he recognized his presence amen when he heard his voice walking in the garden in the cool of the evening in the evening time there will be a voice and that voice will mark the presence of god has come back and when the presence of god came back adam realized that his religion was insufficient because because he says it says here he says now adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself listen technically adam was not naked adam had his religion adam was covered in his religion but in the evening time when the voice comes back amen the voice penetrates the religion and adam realized in the presence of god my religion is not sufficient to cover my sin i am still naked and that's what happened to you and i amen we heard the voice in the evening time and we knew in the presence of god amen my baptist religion my pentecostal religion my message religion it's not sufficient amen i've made something myself and i put it on myself but in the presence of god i'm still naked [Applause] that's the grace of god to us to come as a voice [Music] so let's go to verse 21. and then to adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothe them in this day that the father come down he came down as he would normally come down the prophet of god tells us he would come down in the cool of the evening to have fellowship with his children because god's desire from the beginning when he began to create and begin to form himself into creation god wanted to bring his attributes out and then he wanted to have fellowship with his attributes that was god's desire god god's desire was fellowship friends he would come down in the cool of the evening to fellowship with his manifest attributes because that was his desire that's what he wanted and so he enjoyed the fellowship amen and as long as man stayed under the word the fellowship was intact but he came down this day for fellowship but something was different this day now the fellowship was broken because man left the word and when man left the word he broke his fellowship with god but god so desired his attributes he wouldn't let them go he was going to make a way in which he could bring an atonement because under that atonement would provide a covering and under the covering would restore fellowship right here in the beginning of genesis he tells us the story of the whole bible this is the whole bible that man would fall away but god himself would come down with the voice with his word amen he would expose the neckiness of the religion then he would bring a sacrificial lamb for a blood for atonement and then he would take that word that covering of the lamb the word of god and he would now clothe them in the word so he can unite them back to himself you've just read the whole bible in genesis chapter 3 when you get that picture the rest of the bible makes sense [Music] so god wouldn't let it stay there but as a good father he came down but as a good father remember we're preaching on the ministry of the father as a good father he couldn't excuse their sin as a good father he couldn't say it's okay you come here everything's fine that's not a good father the bible says it's not a good father but in a good father he would bring judgment because a good father brings judgment he would bring judgment he would judge his son he would judge his daughter he would judge the serpent but as a good father he would not let them stay in broken fellowship because the ministry of the father must bring judgment but the father who brings judgment is also responsible for reconciliation and so the the children could not reconcile themselves back to god they had nothing with which they could bring themselves to god so god himself would take a lamb the first thing that was ever slain in this creation and in eden nothing had died nothing had been slain until the father himself comes and takes the life of an instant lamb where did he get the skins to clothe him something had to die and he was foreshadowing the coming lamb the lamb of god the father's offering for his family and he slayed the lamb and shed the blood and took the covering off of the lamb and he covered his children in the covering of the lamb listen to what the prophet of god says in the message fellowship he says then god made a remedy for that in closing i might say this in the garden of eden when god saw that his children had sinned and had gone from him god himself who is the supreme judge made a reconciliation so he could restore that fellowship to his creatures by the shed blood of an animal god wanted fellowship man by sin broke fellowship but god as a father come down and judge their sins but in judging their sins he had to make a way back for fellowship so he brought an atonement that would cover their sins he brought a covering so that he could bring them back into fellowship this is the ministry of the father the father provides leadership for his children see without the message we don't even know how to be a father you can't take the the the normal standard of society you can't take what culture and society and and what's normal all around what normal what's normal around us is antichrist what has become normal to the world is counter to scripture so it's antichrist you can't take the ideas of nominal christianity who have sliced and diced the word and altered and watered it down without the message you don't know how to be a father without the message you don't know how to be a mother without the message you don't know how to be a good son because the word of god the restoration back to the word the word shows you how to be a father the word shows you how to be a mother the word shows you how to be a son or a daughter and so you look at father god he's the model father you look at jesus christ he's the model son you look at the bride of christ she's the model wife so now you know how to act if you're a wife act like the bride shows respect to your husband the way the bride shows respect to christ honor him and reverence him and cherish him but if you're a husband be the kind of husband christ is to his wife who sacrificed himself for who gives himself or who loves and cherishes her as his own body if you're a father be a father like god was a father to his children if you're a mother be the same kind of mother new jerusalem as because she's the mother of us all amen if you're worried about how to be a husband the bible tells you how to be a husband if you want to know how to be a father the bible tells you how to be a father don't go read some book in some christian bookstore by somebody who's rejected the word come back to the original source brother branham says we have one book we have no book but the bible no law but love no creed but christ let's come back to what god has restored to us and given us in this day praise god so the ministry of the father brings leadership to his children how does he bring leadership he breaks a seal what is the breaking of a seal the breaking of a seal is revealing the mind of god and revealing the mind of god is bringing leadership to his children right because without the word you have no leadership you only have leadership by the word so when he breaks a seal when he come to adam and he said don't eat of that tree he broke a seal to adam you can eat all of these but don't eat of that he broke the seal that was his mind and then when he broke the seal he gave a warning that's a trumpet because a trumpet is a minor judgment because brother bannon said to the church ages that god would break a seal he'd bring a messenger he'd break a seal bringing a revelation from god the mind of god this is good leadership this is how a father the father operates then when they would begin to get from that word he would bring a thunder a correction don't go that way bring them back a warning judgment and when they wouldn't turn back then he pours the vial out that's how the father operates amen he breaks the seal amen if you have a little son or a little daughter amen you can't go to the vial and bring chastisement amen and bring and bring a correction and begin to bring a rod amen when you've never broke the seal first you have to tell them what's in your mind [Music] i want you to do this i don't want you to do that this is what i expect this is what i i don't expect god never went straight to the vial he he went to the seal first then after he broke the seal and his children starts to get away he brings a voice of thunder to bring correction and then when they reviews the thunder then they go into the vile he brings a judgment so our children get frustrated when we don't follow the pattern god laid out you have a mother or a father amen they don't take the time to break the seal but all they do is thunder thunder thunder thunder thunder but the children don't even know what's expected they don't even know why what am i supposed to do how do you want me to act but every time they do something wrong thunder or worse than that vile vile vile but god showed us how to be a father first thing we do for our children is break the seal the next thing we do is we bring a thunder say no that wasn't what i said that was wrong you come and stand beside me next time it'll be worse and if they push past the thunder then we bring the vile of the rod according to the scriptures but the reason we have children who rebel against their parents is because they haven't taken the model that god has given us because the model that god has given us is just is righteous is holy and is pure if you bring the if you break the seal correctly say you don't need dr dobson you just need the bible [Music] if you break the seal correctly the children now know right and wrong they clearly know what's expected and when they do something different than what you expected they willfully chose to do wrong so then when you bring a thunder to remind them of the rule and to remind them that judgment's coming it's righteous it's holy it's pure and then after that thunder they go further into their own will now it's righteous holy and pure to bring correction and it's actually ungodly not to bring the vile now by letting it go you become antichrist again because you didn't follow the pattern of the word and if we would just take god's pattern to raising our children we'd have children who knows what's expected somebody's taken the time to explain it to them they've given them their mind and now they know what's right or wrong when they come past that they know that they chose to do wrong and they know they deserve punishment they're not wondering why i'm always getting yelled at why is mom always screaming why is dallas yelling why does dad all of a sudden get super angry and come over and chastise me no by the time you get there they know and when you tell them what's going to happen they're like yes [Music] because it's god's pattern it works in churches for church discipline amen it works in businesses if you're a supervisor because god's pattern of leadership works so the ministry of the father is to bring leadership and the ministry of the father is to bring correction and then the ministry of the father is to bring restoration it's the father's responsibility to reconcile with the child let's go to first corinthians first corinthians chapter 11 verse 31 this is the scripture we always read at communion i'd like to look at this in verse 31 for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged if we fail to judge ourselves by the word that's been given to us then the father will judge us he gives us an opportunity by breaking the seal for us to judge ourselves how else would you judge yourself if not by the word but when we are judged we are chastened to the lord that we should not be condemned with the world the reason the father chastens us is so we will not be condemned with the world he doesn't chasten us to chasten us he doesn't chasten us for punishment god's desire for his children is not punishment god's desire for his children is reconciliation god will judge us and bring us to chastisement so that we will not be lost with the world he's got a he's a father he's watching over his children those that aren't his children they can go but you that are his child you get away with nothing amen because he will not let you be lost with the world hebrews chapter 12 let's turn there and look hebrews chapter 12 verse 5. it says and you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou are rebuked of him for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourges every son whom he receiveth if you endure chastening god deals with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if you be without chastisement we're of all our partakers then you are a bastard and not sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much more rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness he said your fathers he's speaking the gentiles amen your fathers before they chastened you after their own pleasure but god chastened you for your own good so that you'll be a partaker of his holiness that's the ministry of the father i'll look at a few more scriptures let's go to proverbs and look at a few scriptures and proverbs this isn't the main thrust of what i want to speak but it lays a good foundation proverbs chapter 13. proverbs 13 he that spareth his rod hateth his son be he that loveth him chasteneth him be times why because the father loves us chapter 29 proverbs 29 chapter 29 verse 17. correct thy son and he shall give thee rest what's the purpose not because you're angry not because you're mad that wasn't god's purpose correct thy son and he shall give thee rest yea he shall give delight unto thy soul paragraph 23 and 12. apply thine heart unto instruction and thine ears to the words of knowledge withhold not correction from thy child for if thou beatest him with the rod he shall not die thou shalt beat him with the rod and shalt deliver his soul from hell my son if thine heart be wise my heart shall rejoice even mine what is the purpose wisdom all the correction was to bring wisdom and he said son if thine heart be wise my heart heart shall rejoice even mine yea my rain shall rejoice when thy lips speak right things oh i would like to say that god has brought a correction in this day through the prophet of god amen that prophet of god came down with a rod of the word and he spanked every denomination amen he spanked the laodicean church age and he brought a great correction a hard correction a firm correction amen because they had switched straight from the word amen they had all gone their own way all the tables had become as vomit he sent a prophet down with the rod of the word and he spanked them for false baptism he spanked them for all the other things that they were after but what was the purpose of the spanking the purpose was reconciliation so that you have wisdom that my heart will delight in your wisdom and my reigns will rejoice when your words speak wise words when you speak of knowledge amen and god has brought his children in this day through the correction from a prophet because a prophet brings correction and through the correction of a prophet he has brought up a people who have been corrected corrected from wrong thinking corrected from wrong dressing corrected from wrong speaking corrected from false doctrines corrected from wrong spirits we have been spanked and spanked and spanked and spanked and he broke the seals and he broke the seals and he broke the seals so that he could have a people that will speak right words that will think right thoughts amen that will bring delight to his heart that will bring joy to his inward parts god is delighted amen when a son begins to act like the father brother ben told us the story in adoption he said the holy ghost was sin as a tutor amen and he got uh he's taking the story of two different signs and one is not the right kind of sign but one is the correct kind of sign and the wrong sign is doing wrong he's not listening to the tutor and the father is displeased but the tutor comes along with the right sign and he says listen i saw him do this and i saw him do that and oh he's just like you that brings delight to the father's hearts that brings joy and pleasure to the heart of our father what does he want what does god want friends he wants fellowship but god cannot have fellowship with sin he cannot fellowship with perversion he cannot have fellowship with something that's polluted amen in order to have the right kind of fellowship he has to bring an atonement and when he brings that atonement there's a washing and with a washing comes a covering and with a covering comes a reconciliation back to fellowship again what did god want in this age not just correct denominations not to just correct dress and doctrine amen that was just the beginning amen what he really wanted to do was bring you his mind amen bring you his understanding so that you would think his thoughts amen so that you would see with eyes that see like god sees so you would read your bible the way god would read his bible so that we could come back the goal was restored fellowship let's take a look at luke chapter 15. luke chapter 15. and let's go to verse 11. and a certain man had two sons and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that followed to me and he divided unto him as living and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in that land and he began to be in one and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into the fields to feed swine and he would have feigned filled his belly with the husk that swine did eat and no man gave unto him and when he come to himself he said how many hired servants of my fathers have bread enough to to spare and i perish with hunger i will arise and go to my father see he came to himself there was a time that we came to ourselves and we were in a far country and we became a servant to the task masters of laodicea and he had long forgotten his heritage who he was who his father was and he had gone out with the life that had been given to him because god had given us a life when we come to this earth and we began to waste our life through riotous living and we got to where our life was falling into poverty and we became a slave to the very system of laodicea so much so that we were willing to eat pigs food at the movie theaters and in the arcades and in the places of entertainment and on netflix and on we were willing to eat pig food but somehow he come to himself said who am i what am i doing here why am i willing to eat pig's food amen i'm a sheep not a pig and he come to himself he said i would rather be a servant in my father's house than be in this condition he was broken amen he come to humility he realized he had failed and he was a failure and he was no good and was not worthy to be called a son of god what a wonderful place to be in he said i will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father i have sinned against heaven and before thee i am no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants what did he do he came in true repentance and true humility true repentance and true humility was well you know i messed up but i'm okay i'm back now god i'm back father i'm back where's my room you keep my room how's where's all my stuff that's not how he came back he came back through true repentance and true humility he knew he was not worthy he knew he didn't even deserve to be a servant but he would be happy just to be a servant in the house of his father than to live in the world another day and he come back through humility and he come back in reverence to his father and he come back with respect and he come back and said i'll just be one of thy hired servants when you see the response of the son it shows you why there was a certain response of the father verse 20 and he arose and he came to his father but when he was yet great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him and the son said unto them father i have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son but the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us be merry amen you see the ministry of the father at work here because the ministry of the father is to bring reconciliation amen he's not to bring punishment amen the boy already served his own punishment he already suffered of his own choices he was already humbled by the correction he was already repentant he already come with respect amen and so now the father doesn't have to bring chastisement there's already been chastisement he's looking at the fruits of chastisement and the fruit of chastisement is true repentance with humility with reverence and respect and when the father said that he said bring the robe bring the shoes bring the ring for my son which is dead is now alive that's why god as a father he's never interested in correction for corrections sake he's always interested in correction for reconciliation sake because the father wants fellowship that's why some people get so angry when the pastor starts bringing correction and say why does he say this and why is he always harping on that amen it's a ministry of a father because the father is not here to bring punishment and chastisement and doesn't enjoy i don't know a good father who enjoys chastisement if he enjoys chastisement he's not got the heart of a good father but chastisement is necessary for reconciliation because breaking the word of god god cannot dwell with perversion on the word he can't dwell when the word is broken the fellowship between god and his children was broken when they left the word and if we're still leaving the word we're breaking fellowship so god will send the ministry along and that ministry is speaking the word of god bringing chastisement because the goal is reconciliation back to the father i've seen people under correction and i don't mean harping on something word correction by the what the prophet has told us matched with the word of god bring a correction and they'll leave the church to go somewhere else where they're not harped on so that they can still be a message believer in their fig leaves because they've taken the message and they've stitched it together in a certain way and they put it as a robe and feel like because i used quotes and i stitched them together and make a robe i'm now covered but i tell you when there's a real anointing of a holy ghost filled minister he'll make that road nakedness it's the voice of god and the presence of god will pierce through the robe of quotes used the wrong way stitched together to serve our own purpose bringing us back to the intention of what the father wanted with that quote because if you if you take the quote and use it differently than the mind of god then you've perverted the very quote that you're using amen but to bring it back to the mind of god and bring it back to the word amen what the prophet has said and why he said it will bring a correction that will bring reconciliation back to the fallen so when god brings correction say thank you because if we would just judge ourselves by the word we wouldn't be judged but when we are judged we are chaste unto the lord so that we will not be lost with the world and if god threw a ministry through a tape through your brother your sister however he brings it if he brings correction to you that brings a chastisement say praise god my father loves me so much he won't let me get lost with the world what does it feel like sometimes the pastor has a camera set up in your room and a listening device in your car why is it sometimes the husband's asking the wife did you call him you look at your kids and like you've been talking to people at church no it's the father it's the ministry of the father the father brings judgment but with the judgment he'll bring an atonement and with the atonement comes a covering and with the covering comes a reconciliation in the message the super sign the prophet of god says adam he tried to make a super religion without an atonement there was no atonement in adam's religion said they're still trying to do it a super religion make a religion so he could live any way he wanted to without an atonement and still have a covering he tried to do it in the beginning and he is still trying to do it but god's provided way was an atonement and it'll never work no other way it has to come back to an atonement i want to look at the word atonement i like this board i watched a service where brother stephen was preaching and i said i like that board we're going to look at the word atonement atonement at 1. what does god want he wants you to be one with him what was the purpose of the atonement to bring back the oneness with god sin separates leaving the word separate but the atonement brings us back the atonement was so that we could be at one with god it was god's idea it was his concept it's his desire it's what he wants amen now listen to this quote in the indictment and that's the one place that he meets with man today is under the shed blood of the sacrifice see he told us in super sign that he wants a super religion without an atonement that was cain's religion because abel caught a revelation and that revelation amen was was uh that revelation was his faith by faith which is a revelation god revealed to him what the proper way of worship was and it was through the atonement through the blood without the shedding of blood there's no atonement there's no forgiveness of sins so abel he had no means to be reconciled to god by his own thinking he had to wait for a revelation from god cain did not wait for a revelation cain started working they knew there was going to be a time to worship god a time to come amen to the gate of eden time to offer a sacrifice and they knew that and they began to work amen and so cain began to labor he began to plant began to till began to pull weeds began to do everything that you would do to bring forth flowers and fruits and vegetables to present the god he couldn't start the day before how long had cain been working to bring the sacrifice and brother brown said he built a beautiful altar carved it out of stone and set everything just right and made it beautiful according to everything he thought god would want but he did it with no revelation it was all wisdom intellect abel comes over here and abel is not working because it's not by works it's by faith abel's got nothing he can do to please god i mean when abel begins to think how can i please god abel can come up with nothing what can i do to make god happy what can i do to please god what can i do how can i give god something he doesn't already have what can i give to god cain thought i'll give him something i made something i worked for something eyebrow i i i i i it's the spirit of lucifer it's the spirit of religion it's the spirit of denomination i'll worship god the way i want i'll believe what i want to believe i'll sing the way i want to sing i'll take the doctrine i want to believe if this church doesn't agree with me i'll go to a church that agrees with me i i i i able just waits can you imagine the conversation where cain he's working he's diligent his garden is beautiful the plants are coming up he's keeping the weeds out he's shoeing the animals away and abel and cain have a conversation cain says what are you going to offer to the lord abel says i'm not sure yet and cain says but we're getting near the time that we offer a sacrifice to the lord and abel says but i'm not sure what to give him he can look over and see all that cain's doing who's working harder who put forth a greater effort where is the beauty he can look over and no doubt abel can have a little self-doubt am i really doing all that i should do i mean look at how look at how kane feeds the poor and he has a homeless shelter they take care of orphans and they build churches but i have nothing and you know the devil is not new and edgy just showed up and landed on your shoulder to begin to talking to you abel is wondering what can i give what can i do what will please the lord cain has his own ideas he doesn't wait on the lord he just moves forward with his own ideas but one day abel is just sitting there he's thinking what does god want what does god want and all sudden forgive me for dramatizing this isn't a quote this is just brother chad break it down he thinks why are we out here anyways why aren't we in the garden what happened why am i on the east side of eden and locked out of the gate what was it mom said [Music] what was it she said that they did something wrong brother branham said both of them heard the same story one of them thought it was fruit so he's going to offer fruit the other one heard fruit but he was saying what kind of fruit what kind of fruit was that he says what was that that dad said god did he killed he took one of the lambs and he killed it and made skins and that's why i'm wearing this today why and all of a sudden as he was walking back bing it drops i know why i'm wearing this garment i know why god killed a lamb why would god who created everything kill why would god slay why would god start bloodshed why would god clothe them in skins why am i wearing this amen why am i outside of the garden all of a sudden in a moment of revelation he understood it all he knew why he was wearing skids he knew why god had slayed a left he knew why he was outside the garden and now just as happy as can be he goes and he gets one of his lambs he says i know what god wants amen i know what will bring the relationship back i know how to please the lord he goes back [Applause] he looks over his lambs [Applause] and i gotta find the perfect one no splot no no blemish nothing wrong so brother ben said he takes a little vine and he ties it around his neck and he comes dragging it dragging it now come over here and look at kane hewnstone beautiful altar he's carrying his vegetables over he's got the fruit laid out and all the flowers in place he's sitting back he goes to this side no no no that's not right i got to get the purple one in front of the pink he's doing it according to his own thinking according to his own understanding he's worshipping god in a way that pleases him not in a way that pleases god [Applause] amen and the fallacy and denominationalism is they worship god in a way that pleases them not in a way that pleases god they want to worship because god man has a god-shaped void and man has a desire to worship man wants to worship so the devil offers him religion with the name of christianity tacked onto it with no word amen just portions enough word to make them think they're christian so that they can continue worship god the way they want to worship god and look down on abel as abel comes dragging his pitiful little lamb and he's got it all arranged just right and he steps back and says that's good god will surely accept me now i've worked for nine months i've labored i've got it just right and he looks over and here comes abel smile on his face he's dragging a little lamb because he now knows what god wants and why god wants it the word has been revealed to him he's got a revelation of the word all the way from eden he knows what to do now he drags this little lamb and brother branham said no beautiful alternative he just flips over a flat [Music] rock he takes that lamb and he wrestles it down sticks his knee on its head his knee in his side and he grabs a sharp rock and he begins to hack at his throat and the thing begins to squall and deplete and the gurgle and he's got mud on him from the feet of the lamb and he's got blood all over him he's sweating with the effort and he stands up and it's hacked to pieces it's dead blood all over mud on him blood on him and god looks down and says that's beautiful to me that's what i want because it's by revelation of my word [Applause] now now you know why cain was so angry because it said cain was roth god how can you look at that it's dirty it smells it's filthy look what he did to that lamb look what i've done with your nature look what i've given and god says i refuse yours because it had none of my mind attached to him but abel by faith offered a more excellent sacrifice than came in it didn't say cain did not offer an excellent sacrifice but abel had a more excellent second cain had an excellent sacrifice because it was the sacrifice of first fruits which would come later in the law he had actually offered something that was good but not by revelation but by his own will abel offered by faith revelation and god accepted his and refused cain and cain became angry after all i've done for you after all i've worked for you after all look at the look at the very nature of lucifer himself in cain but abel had the humility of christ cain offered a sacrifice with no atonement and because there was no atonement there was no reconciliation abel by faith offered a sacrifice according to the word according to a divine revelation of the word and with his sacrifice there was an atonement and with an atonement god accepted him in a sacrifice if we're going to worship god we have to find the atonement we have to come by revelation what's the atonement how do i atone how because i come back in oneness with god what is it he's looking for in my day what is it he wants from me how can i please him amen and we got to come by revelation friends not our efforts our efforts don't mean anything to god he doesn't need our efforts he created all the world by a spoken word he doesn't need anything that you can do for him he's looking for a reconciliation of his manifest attributes he's bringing himself back together and the method for bringing himself back together is by divine revelation he made it by faith so that it could be by grace so that the promise would be sure to the elect because the elect would get it by faith everybody else by intellectualism by wisdom by their own knowledge and own understanding would miss it no matter how close they got they would miss it because you only get it by revelation brother ben said in the message things that are to be you told me to take my time brother right praise god i'll pay the overtime fees amen amen brother branham said a child of god can listen to the word hour after hour after hour i've heard preachers preach 20 minutes and it felt like two hours i've heard him preach two hours and it felt like 20 minutes because the word is eternal and when you go to breaking the word we slip into the eternal friends god is good things that are to be brother branham says but the other one is called my father's house i'll go and prepare a place for you take you out of this pest house and deliver you into my father's house amen there you are take you out of this old earthly pastels he's gone to prepare a place a perfect place where no evil exists no sickness exists no old age exists no death exists it's a perfect place calling you to that perfection and you have to be a perfect you have to be perfect to get there the bible said so jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect it is a perfect kingdom so it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand to be married to a perfect son of god and you must be a perfect bride this is tough friends who wants to try to do that give you your effort so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of god which is the waters of separation that washes us from our sins what is that water that washes us from our sins the word of god amen that's right the blood of jesus christ think of it the dripping bloody word amen the blood the word of god bleeding blood to wash the bride in he's going to wash her in the blood but what did he just say the blood was the blood was the word of god she stands perfect virgin unadulterated she never sent in the first place she was trapped into it there's the father's house that he's gone to prepare in the invisible union of the bride of christ he says what is sin sin is unbelief unbelief in what the word unbelief in god which is the word but unadulterated oh hallelujah leaving soon for the skies amen standing ready think your garments washed by the water of the bleeding word listen friends we are our garments are washed by the water of the bleeding word so that means in this day there must be a bleeding word there must be a fresh blood for a fresh application for a fresh cleansing there's got to be a blood that's flowing today it can't be a blood that flowed another day it's got to be a blood flowing today washed by the water of the bleeding word the word become blood the word bled for you and you are washed in bleeding word the word bleeding the life of god in the word and the word was bled for you that you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes and be clean cleaned and sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and makes your mind and heart stayed on god and on his word so brother brenham is saying being washed in the bleeding bloody word is to be washed by the water of the word so to be washed by the water of the word is to be washed by the blood some people don't like that but i love it and i'll i'll tell you why in a minute because that's my atonement without an atonement i can bring a sacrifice but if i bring a sacrifice with no atonement it'll bring death like it did to cain but sacrifice with an atonement brings life and reconciliation back to god so if we're going to bring a sacrifice of praise if we're going to bring a sacrifice and offer to the lord we must bring a sacrifice with an atonement let's turn to ephesians chapter 5. in verse 25 husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word so why is he gonna wash her with the water of the word what's the only thing that'll make her clean the word how can you bring purity with dirty water if the word has been polluted how can you get clean with polluted water if the word has been doctored altered things added things taken away now there's a corrupt perverted word how can you get clean by a corrupt perverted word you can't wash with dirty water so if he's going to have a pure bride he's got to first break a pure word so that a pure word can wash a bride pure because he cannot be united with anything that's not virgin clean pure holy no perversion so he sent the word so that we can be washed by the water of the word to wash away all the effects of the prostitute spirits through seven ages so that he could be united what was the washing of the water to do washing of the water of the word to do bring us back into union with god this prophet didn't come so we can say god sent a prophet the prophet came as the voice of god in the garden in the cool of the evening so that we would recognize the presence of god and in recognizing the presence of god we would realize we were naked and when realizing we were naked we'd come to god and god would judge us people are afraid of judgment by the word but i say i love judgment by the word because that judgment is the path to my reconciliation brings the judgment then in judgment he brings an atonement and brings a covering and brings a reconciliation so in this day god come down as a voice in the days of the voice of the seventh angel what was it it was the voice of god through that man it recognized so we could recognize the presence of god and the voice exposed the nakedness of creeds and denominations and fig leaves and under that nakedness then now he brings an atonement that will bring a fresh bleeding word a bleeding bloody word that'll be the washing of the water by the word to wash away all the wrong doctrine all the wrong understanding everything that got picked up through seven churches to wash it away so he could do what so he could unite with his bride amen god did not send the prophet so we could say god sent a prophet there was malachi 4 and i'm happy about that god wanted a reconciliation with his attributes he wanted to become one with one flesh with his bride in the end time if we miss that we've missed the seventh seal if we've missed that we've missed the opening of the seals if we missed that we've missed the purpose of the coming of the forerunner what was he for running i want to stay with the forerunner but the forerunner was for running something catch what he four run step into what he four run become the seventh seal become the mystery unveiled which is a bride in the end time [Applause] the prophet came to unite the bride in christ together he come in an eleazar ministry amen to fetch a bride for isaac and how's he going to do it he's got to bring a water of separation that will cleanse and the feast of trumpets prophet of god said in revelations 11 revelations 11 call their ministry will be the ministry of moses and elias calling to israel out of the jewish traditions just as the seventh angels message called the bride out of pentecostal tradition so he's running a parallel moses and elijah is to call israel out of the old atonement of the lamb and sheep and blood and goats and sacrifice to the real living sacrifice the word where is the living sacrifice today it's the word where's the atonement at in the word where's the bleeding word and the revelation of the word it's a fresh blood that's come to cleanse the bride to bring them to the real living sacrifice to the word and the seventh angel's message under the same trumpet same everything exactly the same seals to what call the people the bride out of the pentecostal and world tradition to the genuine atonement are you ready for this this is the prophet of god not brother chad to bring the bride call the bride out of the pentecostal world tradition to the genuine atonement the word what is our atonement this revealed word impersonated in his word here made flesh among us science has proved it by pictures the church knows it the world around we firmly know it for he's never told us one thing and thus saith the lord but what's been the truth did he not say down there in the river as john the baptist was sent so will this message i'm going to draw something because i like this board i don't have one of these at home i'm going to draw something and i just want you to pay close attention to what i'm saying and don't pass any judgment until you hear what we're saying all right going to call this old testament new testament and this line begins at the fall of eden i've got a quote for that we'll see in a minute and this line is the bloodline brother brendan calls it the scarlet thread we know that jesus was the lamb of god and he was the word made flesh and the word made flesh all the word was brought into flesh and that flesh was jesus christ and he come as a man and that man would live the perfect life fulfilled all the law so that he was worthy to be a sacrifice to fulfill all the ordinances of the law all the requirements and he died and he shed his blood to redeem us back to god and free us from the bondage of the law we understand that so we were redeemed at calvary with the shed blood of god's lamb but truthfully he was the lamb slain from before the foundation of the world so before the fallen eden he was already the lamb that was slain is that true so there's been a line of blood and this bloodline goes to calvary and from calvary into eternity adam comes here and now adam needs an atonement adam is here in time adam can't wait to get over here because that won't come for 4 000 years so what's adam going to do how is adam going to be atoned how is adam going to be saved in his day the only thing he can do is get a hold of this bloodline in his day and when he grabs a hold of that bloodline what is the bloodline the word for his day he got a hold of the word for his day and when he got a hold of the word for his day he grabbed a hold of that word and that's the bloodline amen because the life is in the blood it's the life of the word moving through then abel come along and abel couldn't wait to get over here amen for redemption abel had to do something in his day that would that would give him an atonement amen that would bring him to the redemption so the only thing he could do was believe god by faith for his day and when he believed the word for his day he got a hold of this lifeline amen because the bloodline is the lifeline it's the life of the word amen then come noah amen now noah can't go back and grab a hold where abel grabbed a hold of because the bloodline the life is moving on and as the life moves on god is revealing more and now noah can't just he can't just rely on salvation by the shedding of a lamb because there was another word that came for his day and the word that came for his day said i'm going to destroy all the earth but i've prepared an ark go and build the ark and all that come into this revealed word for the hour shall be saved from the destruction of the earth [Applause] noah noah was not contradicting abel noah was not against abel noah was not calling abel an unbeliever but noah couldn't just rely on what abel did when he was presented with the lifeline he had to get a hold of it then come moses do you ever hear brother bennett say moses couldn't come and say let's build an ark and float down the nile to escape this amen moses when moses come he had a different message because he was further down on the lifeline he was further down on the revelation of christ and the bible says of of moses he says moses forsook the treasures of egypt esteeming the reproach of christ that means there was a christ in moses day christ was alive christ was here amen how can he not bear the reproach of christ as there was no christ christ was there because christ is the anointed word and wherever the anointed word is it's christ i'll ask you a question who was that rock that followed them through the wilderness that rock was christ when they drank from the rock they were drinking from christ [Music] moses wasn't calling noah false unbeliever not a child of god but neither could he build an ark that was the word for a previous day but now in order to have salvation there was a fresh word fresh blood fresh life of christ that fresh life of christ in their day was the only path to salvation and they had to get a hold of the lifeline [Applause] when god slayed the lamb here he was foreshadowing a lamb here in time the lamb hadn't come yet but in god's mind the lamb had already been slain god already had blood in his mind he already had redemption in his mind he already knew what was going to happen that's why whenever you grab the hold of the word amen god accounted it to you for righteousness and you were declared righteous with god because that lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and you were holding on to the life of that lamb when moses came along and believed the word those who believed it with him were joshua and caleb what were they doing they were putting their hands on the head of that lamb identifying themselves with that lamb that lamb was not going to be slain for another 2000 years but they were placing their hands on the lamb and that lamb was going to bear their sins and that lamb was going to be a sacrifice for them but they were identifying with the lamb in their day [Applause] they come all the way down till we come to jesus christ jesus christ came what was he he was the word what was this in adam's day the word what was it in abel's day the word what was it noah's day the word moses day the word solomon's day the word jeremiah's day the word so now when the word was made flesh and dwelt along among us everything that they grabbed hold of was inside jesus christ their anchor point man their hand hold where they laid their hands it was now here in a body of flesh and when that flesh bled and died for them amen they were atoned for because they received him in their day so much so that the scripture says when jesus arose everybody attached to this line resurrected with him when he rose amen they weren't here they weren't here to believe that jesus christ was the son of god they weren't able to make their confession in the lamb that died on calvary they could only make their confession and the life of the lamb that was presented to them so when all that life all that word was bottled up all here everything they touched was in here everything they believed was in here amen when he died he died for them they were with him when he died they died with him they paid for their sins with the lamb because they identified with the lamb in their day amen this is the bible friend you can't argue with the bible [Music] when christ went up everybody attached to this line went up too including you because the apostle paul says and you are now seated in heavenly places in christ jesus when god ray when god raised him up when god raised him up when god raised him up he raised you up also when did you get raised up and go to glory when he raised up you raised up [Applause] it wasn't just this side of the line that went up when he went up this side of the line went up too [Applause] that's according to the apostle paul [Music] when he raised him up he raised you up also do you believe that [Applause] but god had one way to make sure that the promise would be attached to the seed he did it by grace which is his love but yet he's a just god and in order being a just god he can't come to the judgment day and somebody say i never had an opportunity you're not fair with me so god gave everybody a chance they all had a chance to hear the word they all had a chance to grab a hold of the lifeline it was presented in every day and every day the word was presented the life that was in the word was coming forth and every day they had an opportunity brother ben says you don't go to hell because you smoke because you drank because you committed adultery he said you go to hell because you refused the lights so when he went up i went up how do you know you're going on a rapture because i already went according to the bible i am now seated in heavenly places in christ jesus because i'm part of that word if that word is in me amen then that word is there i'm linked to the word there the word there in the word here is not two different things it's the word it's the same thing so now the apostle paul comes along the apostle paul comes down as a light and to the gentiles the apostle to the gentiles he's going to people who've never been in jerusalem may never go to jerusalem and he's telling them that they have to receive the gospel message but they can't go back here they can't go back when the scoffers are crying crucify him they can't go back and say i believe lord you're the lord they can't fall at his feet amen like the woman that did with the alabaster box they can't kiss his feet they can't get to him in his body of flesh because that manifestation has already moved on they can't go back and stand at the cross and say i believe it they can't go back and dip their fingers in the blood and apply it to themselves but yet they need an application of the blood everybody has to be atoned by the blood because a sacrifice without atonement brings death all of our worship without atonement and the bleeding bloody word will bring death but the worship with atonement brings life so the father has provided a sacrifice i can't go back and dip my finger in that blood and apply it so how do i get an application of the blood the same way they did back here [Music] [Applause] because the word is eternal he does not change in his purpose he does not change in his order he does not change in his characteristics paul was speaking to gentiles who couldn't go back and get that blood but yet they had to be covered in the blood they had to have a blood atonement they had to come in contact with a fresh bleeding word and paul was bringing them the gospel and by their faith in the gospel they could get a hold of that bloodline then we go into the church ages and we go to lucifer's lucifer luther sorry luther had a fresh word for his age that fresh word brought a fresh blood that word had a life in it the life in that word would bring in atonement and would bring acceptance by god is that what the prophet told us luther by coming to justification hey listen they weren't believing yet in the restoration of the gifts they weren't even believing yet and sanctification they didn't even live holy lives luther swore and smoke and and all of these other things right no holiness but he was only you were only required to grab a hold of the lifeline when it was presented to you in your day and the lutherans when the word came forth they recognized that's god and they got a hold of that now the wesleyans come along and they were further down on the lifeline and the wesleyans couldn't reject luther because the lutherans were sons of god they couldn't call them unbelievers do you see the pattern they couldn't reject them as children of god but neither could they stay in justification only they couldn't just accept what luther brought it was okay that day it's not okay this day now christ is presenting more of himself more of the word is being unfolded more of the life of the word and that word is a bleeding bloody word with a fresh atonement for their day and wesley's day and if they would grab a hold of that word amen they would get the atonement and they would be reconciled back to god then in the pentecostal revival you couldn't stay under wesley's word alone you had to accept it when you came listen when you came here you believed all of this when you came here you believed all of this when you came here you believed all of this [Music] because as christ is revealed those who were with him before the foundation of the world those who were with him when he was crucified they believe all of christ amen they accept it all [Music] but neither can i come here and only believe this because if i believe all of this but reject the bloodline in my day i have rejected christ i have turned god down i have let go of any opportunity at the lifeline till we come to the end then there's a bride under the message and christ is presenting himself in full glory the mighty god unveiled before us amen the unveiling of god christ amen as he's peeled back all the layers of the churches he's opened the seals revealed himself and now in order to get the benefit of this which took place in the mind of god before the foundation of the world you don't have to go back here you can go back to the mind of god and you can grab all of this and say i believe it all [Applause] [Applause] amen listen listen when the pharisees came to this point right here they believed all of this or so they thought they thought they believed it all they believed the law they believed the prophets they believed the psalms they believed they believed it all but jesus says if you believe moses you would believe me for moses spoke of me i am what moses said what moses was i am you know that rock that followed moses that's who i am you know that reproach that moses bore he bore my reproach see really when it comes truthfully down to it when they come here they thought they believed all of that but when they didn't believe this it showed they didn't believe that they only had an intellectual understanding through education that they've been trained in since they were children they were taught to say moses was right they were taught to say jeremiah was right they were taught to say we came out of babylon they were taught to say we're the children of god they were taught to say we're god's elect but it didn't mean they were because when they rejected present day word they rejected all the law all the prophets so when we come to this day there's people here and they say i believe all of this but if you don't believe this you don't believe that [Applause] because all of this is christ and all of this is christ and if you reject christ you reject christ [Applause] now do you see the message now you see the bleeding word now do you see the life that was in the word now can you get a hold of that life can you bring a sacrifice of worship with an atonement and will the atonement bring you a covering of the covering the dresswear the garment of the word and can you now be united with your husband amen this is the day if you reject this you reject this people will fight you on that but it's been that way in every age every age through the bible the plan of salvation was the word for that day the way of escape for pending judgment was always the word for that day it's never changed through god's bible because it hasn't changed in his mind praise god brother branham says in the message the god of this evil age said the word was from the beginning god's plan so what was god's plan from the beginning the word i thought you said a slain lamb a slain lamb's part of the word it's not separate from the word that's the word what's calvary the word what's the redemption by blood the word what's healing the word what's holiness the word what's what's justification in the word what's restoration in the gifts the word it's all the word we believe all the word you can't say i'll take this part of the word and this part of the word and this part of the word and that part of the word but the rest of it i won't take if you reject christ you reject christ the word was from the beginning god's plan but god revealed by revelation the very thing that he vindicated and punctuated that was right not religion not an altar not belonging to church not making sacrifice not being sincere but the revelation of the word of god that was god's plan from the beginning that's what saved abel and that's what saves you that's what saved no one as family that's what saved those who followed moses that's what saved them all was revelation of the word of god brother bam says in the message satan's eden the god of this world today the worship person in this world today is satan and the people are ignorant of worshiping satan but it's satan impersonating himself as the church not in the bar room not the tattoo parlor not the house of prostitution impersonating himself as the church they worship satan thinking they are worshiping god through the church but it's the way satan has done it so how has he done it listen to how satan's done it how has he duped the whole world into worshiping him as the church they think they're worshiping god through the church but they're worshipping satan and brother brown says look at how satan has done it oh you say but wait a minute we preached the word look back here at my text tonight see was satan was the one who preached the word to eve god i said it's that misconstruing that part of the scripture that applies to the day that's how that's how satan is worshipped as the church that's how satan is the worship person of this world is because he's misconstrued the part of the word that applies to today [Music] that's how he's done it it's the misconstruing that part of the scripture that applies to the day he'll let you know all jesus did was perfectly well he'll let you know all that moses did was perfectly well he'll let you believe what jesus did was perfectly wrong you can confess jesus believe in him down on the cross believing in being a son of god according to the prophet and still be worshiping satan and not know it because what has he done he's misconstrued that part of the word that applies today he'll let you know all that jesus did was perfectly well he'll let you know all that moses did was perfectly well but when you take that promise that they gave for this day then that was applied to another age moving the word out of place that's just all he has to do see is to get the people to believe it that way that's all you cannot take one word away from it or add one word to it but that's what he does the anointed ones at the end time the prophet says we notice moses never give them what was noah's time we'll build an ark now because that's the word you know noah built an ark one day no vultures was eating on that [Music] i'm glad he said it so i didn't have to i don't know if i'd have nerve enough to say it but brother branham said him that is a promised word notice for his message he had from god he had the genuine predestinated word of god for that hour neither did jesus serve and moses is left over moses had the word for that or but moses was a prophet here is god himself see he never served them moses is left over but just look at the vultures there and the organization was glutting over it we know we got moses we don't have to have you he said if you'd have known moses you would have known me because moses spake of me listen where the carcass is the eagles will gather eagles the fresh kill of the word the word that's raised up and fattened and been made manifest and give out to food for the children where are the eagles gathered wherever the fresh kill of the word is wherever the word is fresh and wherever the blood is flowing fresh not all been hit on the road months ago or weeks ago but a fresh kill what does a fresh kill have it has fresh blood amen it's the blood what was the blood god took all of this from here to here and he put it in one man and the life of all of this was in that man and the life was in the blood so that when the blood cell was broke the blood life could come out and that life that was down through these ages could atone for every one of us wherever we caught that life in our age and for us we catch the life right here this is why people want to say i just want to preach the cross i just want to preach the cross all i want to do is preach the cross brother the cross is in this word what moses brought is in this word noah's day is in this word justification is in this word sanctification is in this word the gifts of the spirit are in this word everything is in this word i just want to preach the cross i'll accept this but i'll reject this you've cut yourself off from the lifeline the very line that ties you to calvary brother chad how can you say that because this was there it was all bottled up there all that word was in him when he was nailed to the cross and so this word that's here alive today was already there so this word bled for me back there this word atoned for me that there this word i have here was nailed there crucified there bled for me there was my redemption there but i wasn't there i'm here so i have to grab it here to have the effect of what took place there [Applause] which is only the manifestation what took place in the mind of god before the foundation when did i receive the message 1999 2000 2000 no in the mind of god before the foundation of the world i was a message believer [Applause] i was here and i was here and i was here and i was here what the prophet said you are the word all the word was there he said he made me pay for my sins on calvary do you want to see it in the word let's go to colossians [Music] colossians 19 or colossians chapter 1 verse 19 colossians chapter 1 verse 19. for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven and you that were sometimes alienated so he's reconciling you too are you in this verse are you the you that paul's talking about because you have to find yourself in the word i'm right there and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death see where it skips from verse 21 to 22. look at the end of verse 21 where it says reconciled is there a period there is there any punctuation so is that the end of the sentence what's the rest of the sentence the rest of the sentence is the next line you have to read it as one sentence and that one sentence said yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death where were you you were in the body of his flesh that's where you were reconciled man broke the scripture into two but it's one sentence friend where was i reconciled not here i was reconciled there according to colossians [Music] that's what paul says that's why brother branham said i preached what paul preached people want to take a they want to say you say you were there he made you pay for your sins when you were there hey where did brother branham get that he got it from the apostle paul [Music] amen praise god you know people want to try to correct brother branham not here i love you all you just love me anyways people say i want to take the bible and i want to correct brother branham by the bible if you if you can correct brother branham if you can correct this message by the bible then why not get rid of the whole message what you're doing when you say i want to correct brother ben i want to correct the message by the bible what you're saying is my understanding of the bible is perfect look at the pride the pride that says the pride that would say i just want what the bible says they're not the message brother man said this message is christ this bible is christ there's an equal sign right here the message is christ the message is the bible [Applause] because if not if that's not the case the problem and i don't mean listen we're not understand we're not into foolishness says brother ben said seven thousand and seven hundred they're both correct brother bam said himself that was wrong he was a man we're not we're not trying to make every word he said divine but the message he brought is the word the message he brought is the word the bible is the word christ is the word god is the word the message is the word the message is christ the message is the bible it's all the same thing everything he taught come from here [Applause] every time brother ben is preaching he's preaching the bible because remember somebody said to him brother madam you don't know the bible very well you know what they were saying you don't have good intellectual training on the recitation of the bible sometimes you get characters reversed sometimes you get the numbers of people wrong sometimes you word it funny and don't say it exactly like the bible says it yeah and they're saying you don't know your bible very well but brother man said that may be true but i know the author what's he saying i know the one who wrote this and the one who wrote this is the one who revealed this it comes from the same source from the same mind amen it is the mind of god [Applause] so if we have to start correcting the message by the bible how many different men with different understanding of the bible would it take to give us the correct interpretation of the message you know we're going to wind up with 40 000 message denominations by everybody taking their mental understanding of the bible and trying to fix the message with their own mind you're going to have one denomination in the message after another after another because it's repeating the same process that caused the church ages we'll be coming into the mess there are things the prophet said that we haven't understood for decades but in a flash who opened the word and that that he taught is laying right there in the bible that he said there is right there and that's there and that's there [Applause] but you know what brother branham said sometimes he says things in such a way that'll cause them to stumble some to go away some to fall away you say well god thinking do a thing like that he has and he does yet why he made it by faith so that it could be by grace so the promise would be sure to the elect how does the elect get it by the grace of god what did the grace of god give you a seed a predestination in your soul that could say that's nothing but the truth brother adam so he made it by faith so that it could be by grace so the promise would be sure to the elect and so nobody else would get it because his grace was only for his elect so he had to have a way where he could be a just god and give everybody the same chance to grab a hold of the life life and if you grab ahold of the lifeline and don't let go you'll be safe and you'll come up in that resurrection but if you don't grab that lifeline then you weren't in my mind before the foundation of the world and now when god comes to the judgment he's just he's holy he's true because everybody had the same chance to grab the lifeline but god by grace knew there was going to be his seed in the earth that would see that living word in their day and say that's the truth that's nothing but the truth and they would get a hold of it [Applause] and that's why he made it by faith so that it could be by grace so the promise would be sure to the election i remember hearing for years brother banham say when he was on the cross i was in him i'd say okay i don't understand it i don't see how it works and one day i'm reading through colossians and the spirit of god says there's no period there's no period those aren't two different sentences that's one sentence he has reconciled you in the body of his flesh through death [Applause] now if i had taken the doctrine that i have to fix this with this would i have already rejected what now i found out to be true how many things would we have rejected because we didn't see them yet in the bible it doesn't mean it wasn't in the bible but we didn't see them yet because it's taking a while to wash away our denominational understanding of the bible and as he's peeling back layer by layer all of a sudden you're saying there it is there it is there it is there it is where's the seventh seal the seventh seal was all the way back revealed already in genesis when god took a man pulled a woman out of a man united the two together that what was that that was his masterpiece what's his masterpiece his heart purpose what's his heart purpose the seventh seal where do you see the seventh seal in the bible i see it from genesis to revelation i see it in sarah i see it in ruth i see a nestor what's the seventh seal christ male and female united back together as one the oneness of god i'm so glad we don't have to correct the message with our feeble miniscule tiny carnal understanding of the bible but we can just take what he said look at the vindication and our hearts tell us that's the prophet of god to us it's a fresh bleeding word for this day to us it's the fresh kill of the world and the eagles have gathered to the carcass let's turn to job 39 i just want to point out that that scripture where the carcasses the eagles will be gathered is a resurrection scripture because it comes from luke 17 and in luke 17 he said two will be in the field one will be taken two will be laying in the bed and the disciple says where will they be taken and he says where the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered and brother branham attached that scripture to his day meaning this is the resurrection day this is the resurrection system we've been resurrected out of dead denominationalism and brought quicken to newness of life it's a resurrection scripture so it's for today amen job 39 this is where jesus is quoting from job 39 verse 27 that the eagle mount up at thy command and make her nest on high now he's talking about eagles she dwelleth and abideth on the rock upon the crag of the rock in the strong place from thence she seeketh the prey in her eyes behold afar off and her young ones also suck up the blood and where the slain are there is she where are these young eagles mother eagle's been flying over the barnyard screaming come up hither come up hither and the eagles have taken flight where did they go they went to the fresh carcass what are they doing they're sucking up the fresh blood of atonement that's washing and cleaning and purifying them this is the bleeding bloody word of god and the anointed ones at the end time he says now i want you to know this is sure and you that listen to this tape you might have thought today that i was trying to say that about myself being that i was packing this message i have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice and my voice even against my better judgment i wanted to be a trapper but that's the will of my father that i cleared declared to do and i determined to do i wasn't the one that appeared down in the river i was only standing there when he appeared i'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect they are i'm only one that's near when he does it i was only a voice that he used to say it i wasn't what it wasn't what i knew it's what i just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it was the angel his message it was the mystery that god unfolded it's not a man it's god the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is christ he's the one you're feeding on [Applause] where are the eagles gathered fresh kill of the word he's the one you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man if you haven't fed fully on every word to give yourself strength to fly above all these denominations and things of the world will you at this time do it while we pray hallelujah amen brother branham says god always has provided a way of escape for those who want to escape and every generation in every age of the bible he's provided a way of escape for those who want to escape but what was that way of escape the fresh word for their day the word of god coming forth in third day the word may manifest in their day let's go to second thessalonians chapter 2. second thessalonians chapter 2 verse 7 for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth why did they perish they didn't receive the love of the truth it wasn't that they didn't have the truth they didn't love it they had not received the love of the truth that they might be saved they would be saved by love of the truth and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure and unrighteousness but we are bound to give thanks always to god for you brethren beloved of the lord because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth from the beginning he hath chosen you through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth your salvation is resting on believing the truth he had that plan from the beginning that's why brother branham said it was from the beginning the word that was god's plan brother bran is not just saying things he just says it and doesn't give the bible reference but everything he's saying is the bible if you allow the eye salve of the message to come by believing the prophet for this age that i sav will come and get rubbed in your eyes and when you go back and look at the bible you'll say that's what it was there it was all alone i've read that scripture 20 30 40 50 times but now i see [Music] that's exactly what he said so he has chosen you my brethren from the beginning he has chosen you under salvation through sanctification of spirit and belief of the truth what truth the truth that's presented in your age that's the way it's always been you can't change the bible you can't rewrite it friends brother braham said in recognition future home look how all kinds of forms those pharisees had but the word was made manifest they didn't recognize it see and if you are the bride the brightest part of the husband and the only place that you'll ever recognize it is recognize what part of that husband the word you are are we at the feet no are we at the legs the arms the eyes we've come to the full headship to the mind what part of the husband are you we've been given back the mind of christ when we've been given back the word you have to recognize what part of the husband the word you are you can't recognize being the bride how many sees that you have to recognize your position you can't recognize somebody else's what if moses would have come with noah's message no was part of it but it wouldn't have worked jesus would have come with moses message it wouldn't have worked see it was a different age it was a different prophecy a different part of the word had to be fulfilled there they was in another day of the week not tuesday's work can't be done on wednesday and wednesday has got to be done on wednesday saturday has to be saturday's work see and they was recognized oh moses we have moses he said if you'd know moses you'd have known me the lord your god shall raise a prophet like unto me god get the idea oh my see he said in recognizing your day in its message that the reason people in noah's day did not get into the ark because they never recognized the message nor the messenger that's the only reason they perished is because they didn't recognize the hour that they were living the door was open whoever wanted to could go in that door but they did not recognize the hour or the message brother bram says in the message in absolute i don't make any difference what others want to believe to the individual you are tied to it that's your ultimate brother ben and pat's bible that's your ultimate that's the last word and then if he is the word then this must be the last word this must settle it whatever that says that's the scarlet thread that is christ what the word and anything contrary to that i don't know nothing about it that's what we want to know is what this word says for i am tied to christ and christ is the word you get it now and the portion of this word that's lotted for this day his holy spirit is here to manifest that portion of the word just like it was back there at his birth isaiah 9 6 all down through the scriptures everything was spoke of him it was fulfilled over in the book of luke we see that he was the end he was the end of the prophecy too of him he fulfilled that the history the songs everything in the old testament that spoke of him it was fulfilled right there that become the ultimate that become the thai post of the word for that age and the real born-again people of this age that's filled with the holy spirit is the thai post of this scripture that's got to be fulfilled in these last days they are the ultimate it's god's ultimate because it's his word and the word is christ the thai post further down in the same message he says i can see eternity break come down into time since eden he said i can see eternity break and come down into time in eden so in eden eternity broke and come down into time and when it did there come a line of blood all the way up to calvary and from calvary tied with this line and all goes to the thai post jesus and someday when he comes to claim his own everyone that's tied to that ultimate will be raised into eternity why they have they have been in eternity all the time they were predestinated in eternity they were part of god they were in his thinking at the beginning and when that big rope is pulled of the line of blood that token was speaking of when it comes up from the earth everyone that was included in that blood will be dropped right up into eternity again but the only way it will be will be tied to the absolute jesus christ that bloodline's been coming since eternity broke into time and eden been coming all the way to calvary and beyond and you have to be tied to that bloodline how do i get tied to that bloodline by receiving christ in my day brother ben said in the easter seal he said his messianic anointed ones believe that what is the messiah what is the messiah messiah's anointed one and now if he was the messiah by being the anointed one for that day to fulfill the word of god to be the redeemer and the anointed one and god raised up that body his bride is the anointed one for this day it's already raised with him in the resurrection because these two are one see the father the ministry of the father is a ministry of reconciliation back to fellowship now if we want to be a good father we have to be about reconciliation back to fellas could he fellowship with unbelief no he had to judge it but when he judged it he brought an atonement the atonement provided a covering and the covering brought them back into fellowship because now their sins were covered and now in this day the father is still has a ministry of reconciliation he's still a good father he's provided a bleeding word for this day a fresh kill of the word why has he provided a fresh word for this day because he wants reconciliation why did he offer a fresh word in luther's day for reconciliation for an atonement in reconciliation why did he offer a fresh word in wesley's day same pentecost but in this day he's brought a fresh word a fresh bleeding word amen the life of the word is here amen to bring a cleansing to bring an atonement to bring a reconciliation and now revelation 22 17 said in the spirit and the bride say come why because she's the anointed one for this day continuing the ministry of christ and christ had the ministry of the father and what was the ministry of christ to seek and find all the lost sheep and bring them back to the father's fold what was his ministry it was the ministry of the father i am about my father's business i do all the father's works he was here in the ministry of reconciliation to reconcile them back to god and brother branham said the ministry of christ and the ministry of the bride is the same ministry so what is the ministry it's the ministry of reconciliation and the spirit and the bride and the prophet will be saying the same thing and what they will be saying will have already been said in the word come out from among them my people and be separate separate from the worldly separate from the nomination separate and come be united with christ there's a fresh bleeding word here today has he called us to be kings and priests is that later is that now he said now we have a spiritual kingdom spiritual priesthood there will be in the millennium but he said now it's spiritual every priesthood has an order when god started it it was the order of the aaronic priesthood aaron and the sons then after everything got mixed up through babylon it became the levitical priesthood but now god has restored the melchizedek priesthood now brother branham he said who is this melchizedek the high priest is here the priesthood has been restored and if you're going to be a priest you have to be in the priesthood under the head of the priesthood which is the high priest and our high priest is melchizedek and we're part of the melchizedek priesthood which is an eternal priesthood and every priest had to have blood the aaronic priesthood had blood the levitical priesthood had blood but because every priest had blood jesus could not carry beyond the eternal realms the blood of bulls and goats all he could carry was his own blood his own life that had been given and he carried his own blood amen so that the life that was in the blood can come back to the believers so that they can be restored to a melchizedek priesthood not without blood but now they have the life of the blood in their vessel [Applause] we're walking through this life with the blood we have the restored word we have the bleeding word we have the life of the blood the life that was in the blood the life that went out at the shedding of the blood and that life went to cat with went to beyond a tabernacle built with man it went to the tabernacles in heaven to atone for us all to send the life back down so that now we could carry the blood and we have a spiritual priesthood and the spirit and the bride are saying come there's a blood that can atone for you there's a blood that can sanctify you that can wash you there's a bleeding bloody word that's been given in this day and you'll come to this in a lifeline and grab ahold you can be saved just as they were saved and noah's day moses day the day that calvary when jesus was slight you can be just as saved if you'll come to this lifeline now the bride is the anointed one for this day she has the priesthood under the order of melchizedek she has the life of the blood inside of her and now the spirit in her is calling out come come drink of the water of life all who are thirsty come let's look at second corinthians chapter five 2 corinthians chapter 5 verse 18. and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation the same ministry the father had in the garden is the same ministry going on by the same tools the same tools he used there was the blood of an innocent one and a covering the same tools he's using here was the blood of an innocent one and a covering now paul is saying that ministry of reconciliation has been committed to us now then we are ambassadors for christ what's he saying an ambassador is somebody who goes to a foreign land and represents the home country and we are here ambassadors for christ well i just want christ but i'm here representing him the amen is the anointed one for this day we are ambassadors for christ but now we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us i want to hear from god paul was saying this is the same thing as god speaking to you we are ambassadors we are ambassadors of christ as though god did beseech you by us it's god calling to you it's god beseeching you we are ambassadors on behalf of christ and as though god did beseech you by us where is the word in this day what part of the body have we come to what is the manifestation where is the blood where is the life as though let's read it again now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christ stead in the place of christ we are standing in the place of christ under a melchizedek priesthood and we pray you in christ's stead be reconciled to god this is the ministry of the father which became the ministry of christ which is now the ministry of the bride happy father's day god is reconciling his children back to himself through an atonement [Applause] through an atonement and he's provided a covering the prophet said let this be the crowning of my ministry the pride to provide the clothes for the bride that she might be dressed in the word god has brought an atonement in our day a bleeding word the life that's been in this lifeline the bloodline is here where is it i don't see it i'm looking at it that life is contained in earthen vessels it's not the vessel it's the life inside the vest it's not my brother my sister it's christ that's inside there's a priesthood here in flesh standing as ambassadors of christ saying as though god did beseech you by us and now we say in christ's dead if you want god if you want christ listen what i'm saying this is his voice because she will be the final voice and the final day what is she saying what's been said before in that message in the word of god god bless you let's all stand [Applause] let's just pray oh mighty god we love you lord we thank you father for this opportunity to be here to hear things lord that apostles and prophets and men of old have longed to hear god i don't think we could humble ourselves enough i don't think we can be humble enough or sincere enough to ever grab the gravity of what is going on in this day open our eyes give us a fresh dose of the eyes to have so that we can come with sincerity and earnestness to the day we're living in not laughing and joking and half-hearted but may we give our whole selves to this ministry of reconciliation may we recognize our position when we recognize our position as kings and priests on this earth may we lord amen recognize what you've done in this day and what you're given and where the hope of the world lies and lies in this word that the bride has we're carrying with us the blood the bleeding bloody word give us wisdom lord to speak to others to be that voice in the final day calling come come out from among her and be separate come and be reconciled back to the father first the ministry of the father god let us lay everything else aside and forget everything else may this become the most important thing to us this lifeline that you presented in our day and may we extend this lifeline to someone else so that they have an opportunity to grab hold of it god draw your children bring your people god we're here to see the last one brought in and then the rapture will go now we're in that hour may you use this may we humble ourselves under your hand may we not come like cain with our own ideas may we not look at your word like eve with our own reasonings and eyesight and understanding but may we come with humility and reverence respecting the prophet you sent respecting the word that you gave maybe humble ourselves under that and be shaped and molded by that word may we come into your very image reflecting your very characteristics so that others will be drawn to you god we can't do it in ourselves but we're depending on you to do it for we know by your word that this is the hour and we know by revelation we are the people so we're asking you to do the work lord use us make us good ambassadors take over our mouths live through our lives speak through us thorn and may there be many souls reconciled [Music] thank you for being a good father thank you thank you for your judging of our sins to separate us from our sins to reconcile us into fellowship for we long to be with you we long to be united with you but in ourselves we could never do it but you provided away and god we're thankful for that way help us to live with earnestness and sincerity and great love for you for all you're doing in this age in jesus christ's name we pray amen
