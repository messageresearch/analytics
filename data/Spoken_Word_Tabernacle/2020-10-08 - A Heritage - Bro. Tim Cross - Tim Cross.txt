he has is getting people's identity away from them some people don't know what they believe and why they believe what they believe they know anything but when we know who we are and why we believe what we believe what god has made us then when we approach him he pushes back because he he cannot he cannot resist faith amen he can't resist revelation let's fly so high way eagles theirs ay fly so

a distance [Music] between who i am and who i want to be [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is you deliver me [Music] [Applause] mr amen you know that to be true tonight amen praise the lord amen invite you to stand with me at this time if you'd like we'll turn in our bibles to psalm chapter 61 i was kind of leaning another direction but it was a a wonderful atmosphere of worship here this evening and so it just felt like the lord was maybe leading me down a different path so we're going to follow the leadership of the lord but we'll read from uh psalm chapter 61 all eight of these verses and uh just before we do we'll go to the lord once more in prayer amen lord jesus truly lord we are blessed to have this privilege together lord in this place that has been set aside for your children to come and to worship you to invite your presence among us lord and to feed upon your word and lord you are the most welcome guest tonight in our midst and we just want to recognize you lord and give you thanks give you praise lord regardless of how we express it tonight i pray that the heart of every person lord in this service lord can open tonight and just lord begin to pour out to you lord how much we love and appreciate you lord father just like that little woman who slipped into simon's feast and began watching your feet loaded with the tears from her eyes and with the hairs of her head lord as she lord opened up a fountain of praise lord it opened a fountain of forgiveness of salvation lord of healing and lord we know that there is nothing that we could possibly need tonight but what you have lord in your great uh lord and your great wealth that you would give us tonight healing strength deliverance salvation lord encouragement lord correction whatever it may be we just want to just open ourselves tonight and say lord jesus have your way lord in this service and and not just in the service but in my life lord and every person that is gathered in those also lord receiving by the the service online lord with whatever distractions or however difficult it may be lord may just the holy spirit settle right into the place where they are lord god and let them know that you are real lord you are conscious lord of of their situation lord whatever they're going through right at this moment father god may you speak to them father and have your way may you be glorified lifted up and exalted in our midst we ask it in jesus name we pray amen amen psalm chapter 61 will begin reading at verse number one hear my cry o god attend unto my prayer from the end of the earth will i cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than i am for thou hast been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy i will abide in thy tabernacle forever i will trust in the covert of thy wings for thou o god hast heard my vows thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name amen thou will prolong the king's life and his years as many generations he shall abide before god forever all prepare mercy and truth which may preserve him so will i sing praise unto thy name forever that i may daily perform my vows amen may the lord bless the reading of his word and you could be seated tonight there is a verse in this psalm tonight that i want to just focus in on and use it for a thought and for a text verse number five where he says thou o god has heard my vows and then he says this thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name amen what a what a wonderful heritage and of course this was not just for david i believe this is for every son and daughter of god amen i i believe that this is all this is a place where every one of us at some point in our christian journey we come to the same realization david did so i want to speak tonight on our heritage and i'd like to maybe just take a moment that to describe uh what a heritage is there there are a number of definitions but one is property that descends to an heir amen another one is something that is transmitted by or acquired from a predecessor amen someone who has gone before you amen has handed something down to you amen and uh another is a tradition and then the a third definition is something that is possessed as a result of one's natural situation or birth amen a birthright amen is another example of a heritage uh you know my last name is cross and and we've got different ones in here tonight brother shock and uh just different ones i brother foul be different ones uh you all have a last name and that's the name that you go by you probably got that from your father and there there are uh there are traits there are characteristics there are things about you that make you unique uh and it's a blend of things that came from both your father and your mother and so i i'm across tonight and and i want to tell you uh as a member of the cross family there are things about me that are a natural result of the heritage that i was born into amen these are things that i did not have to be taught how to do amen i didn't i didn't have to go to school to learn these things amen in fact if i need to go to school at all to get some of this out of me you understand but but it's something that's in me as a result of my birth i remember when i was just a little boy i was i was visiting my grandmother in her home there my mom's mother and i was walking down the hall and my dad's most people him larry and she was watching me walk down the hall with my back turned to her and she said little larry little larry and oh it made me so proud it made me so proud that she would see something in me that reminded her of my father it was just something about the way i was walking brother carlos that put her in mind of my dad and i thought you know i wasn't even conscious i wasn't thinking about it amen i wasn't trying to do anything i i was just walking down the hall but something about the way i walked reminded her of who my father is and she could see my father walking in me amen and so i i think when that applies to the spiritual amen there's a heritage that comes to each of us as a result of the new birth amen it's not something we didn't learn this because of the message we didn't learn this because of the church that you belong to you didn't learn this because of who your pastor is i mean you didn't learn this because of your skin color or your culture or your race or any even your background amen it's a background that goes higher than your natural background that's for sure but because of the new birth there are certain traits and there are certain tendencies amen that are part of your genetic it's part of your dna amen because of your birth and so david somehow he reached a place in his walk with the lord where he can make this testimony amen he said thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name amen it's a shared heritage amen it's something david did not begin and he was not going to end amen but but he could look back down through history and he could see with moses and the children of israel and and the forefathers before him amen there were some common traits and some common characteristics maybe it was a reaction to a challenge i mean maybe it was the way he handled a situation and maybe it was a test or maybe it was a trial but that particular set of circumstances brought out a a a reaction a behavior amen to a certain uh just a way of dealing with things and they would begin to realize ah that's not me that didn't come from jesse that didn't come from my natural father oh my amen i'm thinking about a time david went down on the battlefield to take some supplies to his brothers amen and there's all of his natural family there's all of his brothers there and they were watching they were reacting to this giant philistine they would come out every morning and make fun of their god and all of david's brothers were afraid now they had the military training they had the uniform they had the weapons amen they had all of the resources but evidently they did not have the same experiences that david had oh my amen they should have been reacting like soldiers but they were reacting like cowards and david had a different reaction oh my because he was connected to another heritage amen that was greater than this soul flesh right here oh my it was greater than flesh and blood oh i want to tell you friends serving god is not a flesh and blood affair doesn't matter who your father is who your mother is who your siblings are i mean it doesn't matter what your neighborhood is it doesn't matter what political party you belong to that has nothing to do with your christian heritage oh my it's a bloodline that comes from the almighty god amen hallelujah oh my friend i pray god will help us tonight to look up our family tree and recognize there's some common traits i mean there's some things we share in common with our forefathers amen one time when i was just a uh eight nine ten years old maybe a little older maybe a 12 or 13 i was going with my dad and his dad and two of my brothers we were all in the car we were going to a fishing trip and we were going down the road and my granddad began to tell a story and he told about a time he was at a family reunion i wasn't there but he was there and and you know at the family reunion everyone's uh just enjoying each other's company they were eating and drinking and and having a good time together the the cross family but he said one of the relatives i believe his name was uncle john he said he was he was uh he was sitting in a wheelchair and someone began to ask him said uncle john said what's wrong what's wrong with you is there something wrong because he was crying they saw tears coming out of his eyes and and one of the other relatives they said oh there's nothing wrong with him he said don't you know said all crosses cry they said when they're when they're happy they cry so there's nothing wrong with him at all he's just enjoying the the fellowship and the company and the atmosphere that he's a part of said all crosses cry when they're happy well i never forgot that story because brother shimbo it helped me to understand something about myself amen because when i would be in church and the holy spirit would be moving some would be shouting some would be dancing some would be running amen some would be speaking in tongues there were all men of reactions but all i could do was cry i wanted to run and i wanted to shout i wanted to express myself some other way but it just all just comes right out in my eyes all the joy and all the all the all the wonderful feeling amen it just comes right out of my eyes and all i can do is crying and wipe my eyes but see understanding the heritage amen understanding where i came from and who i am amen it helped me to no longer be ashamed [Music] when i realized this is just my heritage i mean this runs in my family amen this was before i was even born this trait was already all coming down to me amen and so i inherited this so i don't have to be ashamed of myself because it's who i am oh my i think about of one of our forefathers when he and about 119 other believers came staggering out of the upper room amen the world said what meeteth this and peter said these men are not drunk as you suppose seeing is but the third hour of the day but this is that this is that that was spoken by the prophet joel in the last days i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh amen what was peter doing he was connecting to his heritage amen all only days before he was ashamed to be identified as a disciple of christ i'm not one of them no sir he cursed he swore he denied the lord jesus he denied being one of his chosen but here just days later amen after the holy spirit came and filled him it connected him to his spiritual heritage and he recognized i don't have to be ashamed of this i don't have to apologize for this this is who i am this has been going on since before time began when the morning stars sing together and the sons of god shouted for joy amen peter connected to his spiritual heritage and he identified amen he identified his present-day conduct as a fulfillment of a prophecy i believe that's what the holy ghost does when the holy ghost begins to live through you amen you can you can identify your life by the word amen and you won't have to be ashamed of it you won't have to apologize for it you won't have to try to reinvent yourself because what you realize it's the word living itself out through your members even creating your conduct and enabling you to handle the situations in that way oh my amen so david began to realize he had unusual traits that were different from others he did not run from a challenge amen he did not compromise when pressure was applied he could not bear to hear someone mock the god that he served amen you know something else about david i really love he got happy when he saw the word of god being restored [Music] amen yes he was a king he was the highest leader in the land he had all kinds of royal responsibilities he had he he wore dignified clothes he lived in a dignified home he had all kind of people around him amen and you know a man who is a king tries to conduct himself like a king so he tries to walk a certain way hold himself a certain way greet the people a certain way he just wants to behave like a king but one day david saw something that was even more important than himself he saw the ark coming back to the place amen where it belonged it had been down in the enemy camp and then it had been up at a man's house for years and that man's home was receiving the blessings of that but david was seeing the word amen come back into its rightful place into its rightful position with the blessings of god and david begins shouting david began dancing he began rejoicing amen why because he identified in that word amen there is our victory there is our delivering power there is our overcoming power there is what makes israel the fear of all the other nations and david recognized if it weren't for that word i would be nothing amen oh my so he was happy you know something when you really get caught up in the spirit of god you don't worry about what other people think david threw off his kingly garments and he just danced with all his mind before the lord oh my you know his his uh his wife that was given to him by saul michael i believe was her name or michelle she she said oh david she rebuked him she tried to make him ashamed of his behavior because it embarrassed her it embarrassed her amen but david never backed up oh my god oh if you only understood what you married into this runs uh this runs in my family you ever heard somebody say that he can't help it she can't help it that runs in the family if you knew his father if you knew his uncle if you knew his grandparents if you knew the history of his family you would understand amen he can't even help it he is that way because of his heritage and david said i want to tell you something sweetheart he said if you thought that was something wait till the next time oh my amen wait till the great conqueror comes knocking on the door of paradise to loose the saints of the old testament amen wait till the new testament bride is is resurrected and raptured and we meet him in the skies oh i'm gonna if you're there you will see me dance even more so than i have now amen he didn't he didn't back away he said i'm going to dance more so i'm going to praise the lord with more energy than before with more zeal amen david was not perfect but he was quick to repent [Music] amen it runs in the family no no none of us are perfect but when we realize we've been wrong and the holy spirit brings conviction quickly amen lord jesus i'm sorry please forgive me father god that runs in the family amen david also said this something else that runs in the family i was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord amen it just runs in the family for christians to want to go to church they love together with saints that like precious faith and sing the songs of zion and praise god and hear the word preach the prophet of god said if the love of god is in your heart you can hardly wait for those church doors to open oh my just runs in the family amen david said this one thing have i desired of the lord and that i will seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple you know i believe brother shimbo that is not a a building what david was speaking of was not a natural tabernacle or a physical place but i believe it was a spiritual position it was a place amen david said now prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies you can be in any surrounding you can be in any situation you can be completely entrapped by the enemy and yet you can be in this spiritual place just like our brother was speaking about amen when death was at the door there was peace amen there was a peace there why it's a spiritual place in the time of trouble he shall hide me amen and the secret of his pavilion he shall set me up upon a rock amen all these things that are taking place around us with with the diseases with the plagues with the pestilences whatever it may be amen political pressure amen everything is collapsing in the world around us all it's doing is creating i mean it's it's creating the circumstances it's it's just setting the stage for the bride to be sealed completely amen to be encapsulated when you can't depend on your government and you can't depend on your insurance and you can't depend on your paycheck oh my amen when you get to the place where god is all you have then you recognize he's all i need amen there's a secret place hallelujah he's still jehovah jireh he's still jehovah rapha he's still jehovah he's still jehovah's thinking he's still jehovah was shallow he steal those things hallelujah oh i feel good but you know how he got all those names was when his children got into situations amen and he revealed himself i'm your deliverer i'm your savior i'm your almighty god then they gave him a new name a new title he's my peace he's my salvation amen he's my rapture he's my healing hallelujah he's my victory he's my joy amen it becomes personal then it becomes personal to him hallelujah oh my i don't have to go to church to be in that place i can be at that place in the car on the job at home amen oh in the courtroom wherever the circumstances whatever the surroundings amen i can stay and abide in this temple [Applause] amen our heritage tonight heritage can be lost if it is forgotten and a heritage can be lost if it is abandoned god told israel to mark the places where they crossed jordan with piles of stones as reminders and he said tell it to your children and to their children if we move away from the landmarks we will lose our heritage if we forget the things that god has done for us amen and we forget the path amen that the message came to us and we forget the instruments or the vessels that god has used to make his word available to us amen as satan can get you to abandon those landmarks he will change the course amen he will change your path amen to a destination of destruction so moses commanded the children of israel joshua actually come in and said i want you to make piles of stones in that jordan river amen where you crossed over and where god gave the victory amen and he said i want you to remind your children and remind their children bring them back to these stones bring them back to this place it's a physical marker of something god did for you amen now the children the children were not alive when it happened they weren't there they weren't present to have experienced it he said that doesn't matter you take them back to what god did and when they can begin to see your appreciation for the realities of god in your life it will develop an appreciation with them for the same god and they will lead them to their own personal experience where they too can develop landmarks amen what's your landmark tonight it's a testimony something god has done for you where you know he rolled back the waters of the sea i mean you know that was supernatural you know that was god coming to your rescue amen we'll pile some stones up right there because you're going to come back to that amen sometimes you need to be reminded of that even sometimes you need to recall the things that god has done in your life sometimes we grow discouraged we grow weak amen our faith seems to dwindle we need to go back to all the things god has done for us amen take the devil back there tell the devil that's not just a pile of stones i'm a changed person and right here's where it happened i know what god did for me right here amen and i'm not moving away from it amen i was uh i haven't been able to verify the source of this or the actual whether or not it's actually true so i want to say that before i tell you this tonight but somewhere down through the years i heard someone share a testimony that brother branham had gone in his in his lifetime out to an area he was either the u.s or canada and he came in contact with a tribe of indians and he ministered there but these indians were in a predicament because they had forgotten they had lost their lineage their ancestry they could not trace it and as a result of that they could not make claims to own and to receive like a land grant or to actually be given a a possession by the national government but through the gift of the holy spirit through the gift of discernment the prophet of god was able to help them identify who their ancestors were and it held up in the court of law it was it was absolutely the truth and so they would they took note of the things the prophet of god told them and they went and they completed the documents they completed the documentation submitted it to the government and they were given their inheritance they were given a permanent possession amen because the holy spirit was able to identify their heritage and i thought you know that's wonderful even in the natural but there was something far greater in the spiritually man oh my the prophet of god in the ministry of this hour amen was able to trace our lineage hallelujah all the way back to calgary amen and said you never did it in the first place you never sinned in the first place amen and that property that the devil's been squatting on and trying to keep you off of here is your legal deed here's your abstract title d go possess your land take your healing take your salvation take your family claim your children claim your loved ones amen hallelujah give you the faith and the courage amen devil you can't stand on my property any longer it's mine by the baptism of the holy ghost amen praise the lord amen praise the lord amen it's ours tonight oh my god praise the lord there's so many wonderful things i could say in this atmosphere like this amen oh my is it the lord wonderful you know when you when you have the deed in your hand you don't need the attorney any longer you've got the deed amen you've got the purchase of it hallelujah amen you say oh oh brother tim my my pastor's not here but you got the deed my parents are not here but you got the need oh brother tim the prophet is not here but you've got the need you've got the legal documentation amen it has been given over to you take your deed and occupy what belongs to you hallelujah jesus is here and he's here in the form of the revealed word and if you can accept it by faith that's mine lord hallelujah i receive it in jesus name amen i'll tell you what amen the holy ghost enforcer he's still here amen you say well brother tim what about what about this one's missing look who's here quit worrying about who's missing and look at who's present with us amen oh my friends jesus is here the holy spirit is here victory is here amen we've got the victory tonight amen praise the lord it's our heritage tonight amen it's your heritage tonight amen our heritage is is something that is passed down from a predecessor what what could be more wonderful you know i thought about this and i in in my family there are seven children i have four brothers and two sisters and my dad is not really a wealthy man part of the reason is because he had so many kids and he worked for the post post service and and that has plenty trust me but he's not you know a millionaire or something like that so if my dad ever passes he'll give away his home his vehicles his motorcycles his guns you know whatever those things that he owns will be distributed amongst the children the siblings but you know i'm i might have his very best gun or his very best whatever but you know to have that wouldn't be him and i could enjoy that and say i'm thankful [Music] for something that belonged to him to remember him by but it's not him well on the other hand as sons and daughters of god we've got an inheritance and jesus said it's expedient for you in the physical form a man jesus told his disciples it's expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come but if i go away i'll sin the comforter and when he the holy ghost is come it'll lead you and guide you into all truth so when when jesus gives his children an inheritance he's not giving us something that he used to own or even a a part of his possession but his inheritance to you is himself he's coming in a form and he can be with you and you and you and you and you and all of his children amen have the promise of his abiding presence and power with the believer oh my he gave us something better than his physical presence as much as we would love to see the lord jesus walk into this room tonight with sandals on and a galilean robot and long shoulder-length air and a statue of a man there's something greater you've got something better than that and that is the holy spirit he said it's expedient for you it's better for you and when he left the better king now i long for the day we can worship at his feet but what's going to take you there what is going to lead you and guide you into all truth what is going to lead you and guide you into the full manifestation of the sons and daughters of god the holy spirit where you too will recognize one day my these actions aren't my old this is not the old me this is not the old us you know this is a new this is a new life living on the inside of me as adopted sons and daughters of god you're going to be able to recognize i am the son and daughter of god amen and you you begin connecting with your heritage that's why i say i think peter is such a good example of that because i only know of two things peter said right prior to the day of pentecost and that was to whom shall we go lord for thou alone has the words of eternal life that was good and then he said thou art the christ the son of the living god that's the only two things peter said right and even after he said that jesus had to rebuke him because he said not so lord and peter and jesus said get behind me satan for thou savrus not the things of god but the things of men but after the inheritance came after the heritage was passed down everything peter said god punctuated it with power they came to the lame man at the gate called beautiful amen he said silver and gold how about none but he said look on us look on us amen he wasn't saying looking on me peter you say look look who i've become amen look it's the power it's the life of jesus christ he knew he was sharing an inheritance that he could not he could not uh expend he could not give it all away he could not heal too many people amen there was there was never going to run out of this abundant supply of holy ghost power oh my but such as i have i give unto thee in the name of jesus rise up and walk amen behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us us that we should be called the sons of god now let me tell you something about your family heritage therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not if you are misunderstood by the world welcome to the family that's part of the family heritage so you got to understand amen it didn't recognize him and it's not going to recognize him in the bride form today amen beloved now are we the sons of god and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that hath his hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure we can look up our family tree tonight and we can identify the characteristics of our ancestors and as the royal seat of abraham we've got a lot to be proud of as a cross i i don't have a whole lot to be to brag about but as a son of god i don't have anything to be ashamed of amen men like daniel who prayed when it was illegal when they put a national ban on prayer that you know daniel [Music] he could have handled things a little differently did he did he have to go and throw the windows open [Music] and and really from you know deep within his vocal cords and just as with all the energy praise the lord oh jehovah thank you god for another day amen the bible says daniel prayed as before amen legislation does not impact the believer's connection with god amen because once you realize the source of your victory is the strength of your connection you will not let anything tamper with that connection and daniel said law or no law king or no king legislation or no legislation i'm gonna pray amen and i'm gonna let god handle the results amen oh my friend he just prayed he just prayed uh it didn't matter to him i gotta you say well brother tim it got him thrown in the lion's den but look at the difference the king felt sorry for daniel until after pacing the floor all night long worrying about him he gets up the next morning goes down there and here's o king live forever you know what that king was thinking i wish i had a god like yes the message i was going to preach tonight was a casual christian a costume christian or a contagious christian which one are you daniel was a contagious christian they passed laws against him but when they were done the king said everybody's got to serve their god he had a he amen he had an experience that was contagious and then they were infecting an entire kingdom with their faith because they were standing on their christian principles they were standing on their convictions and god was coming on the scene to confirm it amen i'm glad we got some men like this in our family tree we've got a man like joseph that when potiphar's wife tried to trap him he didn't negotiate the situation he didn't try to figure out what is the most politically correct way for me to remove myself from here and not also offend her no he just took off running lickety-split amen he said leave my coat whatever i'm out of here he got he separated himself from the situation he separated himself from the temptation why that's what the sons of god do that's a family heritage amen you don't have to sit there and try to figure out oh how can i negotiate this just get out of there get away from the situation amen shine the appearance of evil the bible says amen we got a man like elijah who withstood ahab and jezebel i'm thankful for a man with faith like that with boldness like that the hebrew children who refuse to bow shamgar who refused to let the philistines rob his stored up harvest and all the martyrs who gave their lives for christ you know there's a great move in our nation today to tear down the memorials of those who fought for our freedoms but if we let their memorials and their memories be forgotten we will lose our appreciation for the value of the freedoms that they fought and bled and died to preserve so remember the agenda of the adversary is not just to defame the men it's to strip away your liberties their objective is has nothing to do with the men of history it has everything to do with where you stand today as a citizen because if they can make you lose your appreciation for the ones who fought to bring this to you then they can move you away from those liberties and those freedoms and the same thing is happening within the message it's not so much about tearing brother branham down as it is is hindering your faith brother branham has lived his life has gone to his reward amen and stands there beyond the curtain of time amen waiting for you and i so the objective is not so much to defame him but it's to make you lose your confidence it's to move you away amen from your destination and your inheritance but if you can recognize tonight that's my inheritance that's my heritage and i'm not forfeiting it i'm not giving it away and i appreciate what god has done amen amen don't let satan tear down the memorials if you let satan tear down the memorials you will soon become his prisoners that's the truth let me uh read a few statements here tonight from the message uh i believe it's spiritual amnesia i believe is where this was taken out of brother venom says yes if i want to remain a true american citizen now i'll tell you that i am an american i'm an american citizen i i think i'm as patriotic as anybody but i've never been more ashamed now of our nation and the things it no longer stands for and the way it's moved from its christian foundation it's a shame but if you look how the natural here that the prophet god is using types to the spiritual if i want to remain a true american citizen i must remember that i am what my nation is for i'm identified with my nation to forget her uh to fight for her or to die for her or to stand for all she stands for i must stand for it what my nation is i am and he goes and i'm going to skip a lot of this but he says don't you never forget it when you do you've got amnesia sure enough and remember you're no more american citizen when you can't become a part of it you know i'm going to break away from this just for a moment uh recently within the last five years or so russia went down to ukraine and they annexed a part of ukraine back to russia i believe they called it crimea well you know how russia did that they employed soldiers who went into that area and they were greedy they weren't russian and they weren't ukrainian so they were neutral or they appeared to be neutral they removed their identification to give the appearance that they were neutral but now years later after all of this has come to the surface it is learned they were not neutral they were paid russian operatives that were there to blend in among the ukrainians and make them comfortable with a foreign presence and make them feel like they might be okay in back again in a russian sovereign nation and i thought i wonder if the devil isn't doing the same thing now he's got some operatives and they want to take off the brand and they want to blend in and they want to make us comfortable with having them in our midst but they want to be careful how they're identified i want to tell you something as a christian you don't have to be ashamed that you're a christian as a believer of the message you don't have to be ashamed that you're a believer of the message if the enemy can convince you to remove your identification he can compromise you and soon you'll be paying taxes you'll be paying tribute you'll become a citizen of an enemy land isn't that the truth satan is very very shrewd but god is more powerful amen but he says you're no more american citizen when you can't become a part of it you must be what america is you must be also i must be partakers of her this is my nation i must be partakes of her what she is i am what she was i am no matter what she was i still am what she is and he goes on and he says i if i'm a real american citizen he said i landed on plymouth plymouth rock i rode with paul revere he said i crossed the delaware in other words all of the past historical events and characters i identify with them and their experiences so if that is true in the natural that is so much more true in the spiritual amen oh my i was there i was in him when he hung on calvary when my sins were judged even in my atonement i raised with him on that third and glorious morning when he says i am alive and i have the power over death and hell amen praise the lord i was with stone stonewall jackson he said i'm identified he said i i hoisted the flag on guam he said when i heard that they had put the flag up their tears run down my cheeks that was me that was you you say oh brother tim that happened on foreign soil that happened on uh 12 hours away that happened on the other side of the world but i'm tied to it because it preserved my freedom it preserved my liberty i'm connected to that amen all she is i am all her glory is my glory all her shame is my shape now to be a true christian you have to be the same we don't want to forget that all that he was i'm identified with him i'm identified with him notice he is in me and i in him now then every christian that's a real genuine christian was with him when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy before there was a foundation of the world we were identified in the immortal rims with god 10 million years before the world was ever formed i was there i was identified with him oh my we have a god-given heritage tonight don't let it slip away don't forget your piles of rocks don't forget your testimony go back and revisit it take someone with you show someone else amen what god has done in your life amen the new birth comes to give you a true heritage you may say brother tim i have nothing tonight as a mortal i have nothing as a natural man or woman you've got more than you could even begin to comprehend as a son or daughter of god amen brother branham came from a heritage of of liquor moonshine smoking drinking running from the law that was the that was the heritage of our prophet naturally speaking but there was another heritage that was there to prevail and when he was about to take the drink a voice spoke don't ever drink don't smoke don't defile your body because i've got a work for you to do when you grow older he went to smoke that cigarette don't another heritage amen what's coming there amen to protect him to bring him into that higher heritage amen i'm just i'm going to close with this thought tonight in genesis the bible talks about how when god formed adam into a body of flesh he was the only creature walking on the earth that did not have a companion of like specie now adam could watch all of the other animals and the birds and all of the creatures and enjoy all the scenery but he could not enjoy fellowship with an equal who could understand him until the bible says god laid adam in a deep sleep and he took from him a rib and the bible says the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman brought her unto the man and i thought about that brought her unto the man and that just began to just go over and over my mind i thought you know i wonder if god didn't take that portion from adam's side and just go over to another area of the garden and form that into a a body the body of mrs adam we always want to call her eve but she didn't gain another identity until she transgressed so she was just mrs adam but then he he had to to wake her from her deep sleep and perhaps just in a way of dramatizing it he had to lead her through that garden past all of these other wonderful scenes a wondrous beauty all of that perfection and all of these other creatures until he could bring her back to the place where she began and say this is your purpose this is where you began you complete him and he completes you and now you can have fellowship now you can gain an identity now you can understand your heritage since you've been restored back to the side and i thought about that in the spiritual sense how a bride was separated from christ at calvary and just a couple years later she comes up to nicea rome and the world is trying to give the church an identity and all through seven church ages someone or something or some religious system or some world governments are trying to give his church an identity but all the time he's leading her through those ages and through those messengers he's leading her to a revelation of himself and the revelation of who he is enables you to then realize who you are as sons and daughters of god so in this hour he comes in the fullness of the revelation and the seals are open and the son of man is revealed and there's a manifestation on the earth and mrs jesus christ is joined in an invisible union to jesus christ the revealed word of the hour and then another creature comes along yay hath the lord god said he wants to devalue what is a proven and vindicated word to reduce her back to something less than what he has already declared her to be as the bride of jesus christ but i tell you what that ever six thousand years ago she listened but this one does not have the time she's not listening she's already received her heritage amen she's already been sealed into jesus christ she's accepted it she's been joined and nothing nothing nothing can separate her amen what can separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord shall distress or famine or nakedness or peril or sword no in all of these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us tonight that's our heritage tonight do you love him tonight oh isn't he wonderful amen isn't he wonderful wonderful wonderful isn't jesus my lord wonderful eyes have seen ears have heard what's recorded in god's word isn't jesus my lord wonderful isn't he wonderful wonderful isn't jesus my lord wonderful eyes have seen years have heard what's recorded in god's word isn't jesus my lord wonderful amen you love him tonight amen let's see if we can get a key there may be key of g let me hear you there it is i was off just a little bit isn't he wonderful wonderful wonderful isn't jesus my lord wonderful is he wonderful tonight oh eyes have seen here's her what's recorded in god's word is it jesus my lord wonderful oh wonderful wonderful jesus is to me counselor prince of peace mighty god is heating saving me keeping me from all sin and shape wonderful it's my redeemer his name once more oh wonderful wonderful jesus [Music] [Music] one more time wonderful wonderful jesus to me counselor priests of peace mighty god [Music] keeping me from all sin and shame oh wonderful is my redeemer praise his name hallelujah amen blessed be the name of the lord i told you i love brother tim cross we love his ministry my goodness brother tim cross have you listened to what we preach on sunday so it's not me it is not even brother tim cross it is god amen amen amen amen wow blessed be the name of the lord [Music] it seems like the lord spoke to me about this sermon and i didn't catch it at work i was trying to find uh to read a chapter this morning and i fell to john chapter 13. can you take your bible and we're going to be closing john chapter 13 the heritage and your identity two things heritage and your identity i read this before and when i opened it at work something struck me and i didn't know that's the sermon coming up john chapter 13 verse 3. if you dare you can say amen jesus knowing that the father has given him all thanks possession heritage all things into his hand karma identity coming and that he was come from god identity your origin and went to god those two things given me today i work before i even leave hallelujah and then it connects to a scripture in ii corinthians chapter six you there this is the holy spirit working in the body that's a masterpiece amen i felt like paul say and what shall i more say for the time will fail me to tell about this heritage this heritage this heritage this heritage amen he said tom will fail me to talk about gideon about barrack about samsung about this heritage this there is so much so much second corinthians chapter 6 verse 10. i read this twice and can't even touch it uh sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor like he mentioned that the cross we didn't own much we can't brag off too much as poor yet making many rich as having nothing naturally as a cross but spiritually as a child of god and yet possessing i thought jesus was the one that delivered all things now paul is saying we possess all things all that was in god was poor into christ or what all that was in christ was pouring to the that's an heritage more than the physical body the holy spirit melchizedek the possessor of heaven and earth possessing all things hallelujah hallelujah brother tim god richly bless you for giving yourself to this church and blessing the children of god you always welcome and i can't wait you need to tell me when you're going to preach that sermon you give me the date and we work accordingly amen praise the name of the lord everybody happy amen let's pray heavenly father lord it is so odd and peculiar the way the holy spirit is moving with his children lord father your prophet told us that bethlehem was a place where you were moving in a mysterious way father i didn't know what was coming tonight lord you spoke to us on sunday and here you are confirming insisting again on the same thing on our identity heritage and you even reminded us again of that mysterious part of justification to know lord that we never done it to begin with father we thank you for making us stand on your righteousness lord we thank you i spoke i communicated with the brother and i told him you keep coming on my mind you keep coming on my mind and here he came lord father and lord father yielded himself very sensitive to the holy spirit lord and father you came again and struck that same message because it's the hour of adoption he even mentioned lord father you mentioned through him tonight lord father about the adoption of your children about understanding our heritage lord father lord may we never miss this opportunity because time has come that your bride need to prepare to go home father may you bring us again more and more closer in fellowship with you lord the fellowship of the mystery in the holy spirit lord father lord jesus christ may you bless and strengthen my brother lord father remember him lord you know the desire of his heart lord father may you remember and may you granted unto him he's given his all lord father to serve you but father you the god of remembrance you'd only remember our curses but you also remember blessings your prophet told us father may you remember and bless his home lord and lord father bless this church remember each one of us and also sister gene in the hospital father may you protect us again under the blood and may you give us lord if that terror to come another opportunity to gather together around the revealed world of the hour father bless each one the musician every effort they're making coming here on time setting up lord father the instrument may be lord unnoticed by the people but god father you see that micah daily coming here on time all the brother lord father that are preaching in lord to set up this room never even mention brother david lord all the effort he's doing father may you remember them lord father we committed all unto the hand and ask it in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you take the name of jesus with you god bless you amen [Music] foreign [Music] do [Music] you
