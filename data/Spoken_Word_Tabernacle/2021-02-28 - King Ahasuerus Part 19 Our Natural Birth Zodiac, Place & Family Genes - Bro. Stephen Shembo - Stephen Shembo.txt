you musician for everything you're doing for the kingdom of God blessed be the name of the Lord you need your Bible we might we're going to get into some territory so just bear with me it might sounds a little bit strange but we're going to come up all right amen yeah brother Robert reminded me yesterday he said brother stepen remember we have roof serving we have this part that we need to come up I say brother Robert the one driving the Sheep is keeping digging amen the the Holy Spirit keep digging and getting deeper and deeper and deeper I'm just following I'm a co-pilot but the pilot is driving this down and keep moving keep moving keep moving so once we finish we'll come back up on Surface amen let him clean up the house let him clean up the marriages let him clean up the businesses let let him clean up everything amen we don't want to have heavy weight on us that's right Come Ye that are labor and I'm going to give you what clear so you don't want to have any Lage put it on Jesus he's going to take care of it amen Genesis chapter 3 if you dare you can say amen hallelujah verse three but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden you know what a garden means if you don't remember we talk about the book of Song of Solomon Solomon say I'm coming into my garden amen Paul also spoke about the the bride the church which is the Garner of God God has said You shall not eat of it this is not an apple neither shall you touch it this is not an apple because Paul say in 1 Corinthians 7 it is not good for a man to touch a woman that is not this amen lest you die and the serpent said to the woman you shall not surely die for God know that in the day eat you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open so the eyes of Adam and Eve you might be seated were sealed amen go back to the 25th verse on chapter 2 so it makes sense for you chapter 2 verse 25th I just want you pick up that then we get it and they were both what naked the man and his wife and were not what asham there was an innocence that blinded them amen but the one who came to Open the Eyes is not God it's the black dog amen praise the name of the Lord now let's go back where we were for God see for God knows verse five that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open why do you want to open their eyes God blinded them God put a holy Veil on them now you want to Blind them you want to open their eyes why amen the only way you can come back to this state temporarily on this in this world you must be lawfully married remember the quote last week brother random say you can be married 50 years and when God look at you he sees you like you never like you virgins amen if you get in into marriage correctly automatically you back again temporarily in a minor way you back again into Eden amen that's why you and your wife you can talk together and there is nothing amen but don't open your eyes with adultery right that's the black dog amen praise the name of the praise the name of the Lord and when the woman saw it's a perception that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes the last of the flesh the last of the eyes and a tree to be desire to make one wise she took off the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also to her husband with her and he did eight verse 7 and The Eyes of both of them were what open who opened the eyes amen praise the name of the Lord and they knew that they were naked and they saw fig leaves together and made them themselves apron amen when they were under the state of innocency nobody car about the clothing amen amen but when the eyes were open then he opened the door to how you should dress because in the Book of Ezekiel when God saw that woman being a baby God never worry about clothing her until she reached puberty then God begin to be very careful about the way that woman was dressed amen praise praise the name of the Lord hallelujah and they saw fig leaves which is religion a covering together and made thems what apron they want to find a temporary solution jum to verse 10 and he said I heard your voice in the garden this is Adam replying to God and I was afraid for the first time because I was naked and I hid myself and the first time she could he could talk to God and nothing happened don't even realize until the devil open his eyes amen let's go to verse 21 to Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skin so a beast was killed there the first priest in the Bible was God himself amen killing the lamb you say where did he say the lamb where did he say the lamb brother Ram say the lamb where is that lamb I have a scripture for it and I'm going to give it to you amen and Adam call uh verse 21 to Adam also and to his wife did the Lord Co did the Lord God make coats of skin and did what and cloth them so once the Eyes Are Open by a sexual act God is coming straight to clothe the children once that woman in Ezekiel reach puberty amen then the Lord come and begin to take care of the outer appearance so there is something to do with the way we dress amen let's go to the Book of Ruth chapter 3 I hope I'm going to get to that because your slide is pretty loaded Ru chapter 3 verse eight to overcome you must recognize the devil in his tactics the devil play when you ignorant when you don't know the devil will play play play play I have four people that had the same condition and one asked me a question and he didn't even ask me a question about the situation he just ask me a question that I'm going to paraphrase like how can I get focused to meditate amen then I just took some quotes and I say I asked a question I say do you have this this in your life say yes I took maybe six or something seven quotes and ascended and the person replied that that's exactly what is going on and the Lord put somebody else in my heart and I took some of the quote I said and the person say that is exactly my life amen amen and brother brandham even gave a solution how to overcome that amen and then I was talking to her sister and she mentioned she said my sister is suffering with this this this this I say is she having this problem this problem she said yes I say I'm going to send you six or seven quotes you read it and you tell me they read the same quote came back again one was almost crying say thought I had heart condition it was not the heart it was something else and brother Bram describe everything and give even the solution amen and this was going on for years in their life they thought they have blood pressure and heart condition but it was not that it was something else so you must know the devil will play with you with ignorance Ruth chapter 3 four of them and I believe if I open that up I might find more it's a spirit a demon of anxiety and nervousness it will make you think you have hard situation and it's going to affect your belly and you will have constipation and all kind of stuff I will give you quotes rather I'm explaining that and you think something is wrong something is wrong something is wrong it's just an anxiety demon and usually comes in the evening and make you weary let me go back to Ru chapter 3 Hallelujah don't worry we're going to dig that devil [Music] out Ru 3:8 I didn't even pray for none of them they begin to claim their healing amen say I accept the healing the Lord Heal Me I took more scripture and I loaded them I say get the scripture because I know how the devil will come back to fight their mind I loaded them with more scripture I say come back again I didn't pray for any of them four of them nobody you shall know the truth and the truth shall do what without prayer just he come easy roof chapter 3:8 and it came to pass at what and midnight that is the time the Midnight Cry of Matthew 25 the foolish virgin at midnight that the man was afraid this is boas and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who are you and she answered I am rof your handsman spread Therefore your skirt over me why is this woman asking for a skirt to be spread over her she's asking for something for Redemption you're going to see that in Ezekiel chapter 16 spread Therefore your skirt over your handmaid for you are a near what Kinsman she's asking Redemption but that Redemption comes with a marriage amen Redeem Me by marrying me amen let's go to Second Timothy chapter 1 Hallelujah before you get married naturally you must be married to somebody first if you are not married to that person don't engage into marriage I'm going to prove to you so our normal marriage should be our second Hallelujah second Timothy chapter 1 if you dare you can say Amen my goodness don't know why time has been my enemy one of this day is going to be swallowed up in eternity second Timothy chapter 1 verse 5 if you dare you can say Amen this is Paul talking to Timothy he said when I call to remembrance the unan the sincere the genuine the unan faith that is in you so when Paul look at Timothy he found out that Timothy has a gift of faith amen but Paul is a spiritual man that knows had to study genetics amen everybody was talking about Abraham MC Abraham madc when Paul came he looked he said uhuh in the ls of Abraham L was there nobody saw it only Paul amen he could trace a gen and go this way and catch it when I called to remembrance the unan faith that is in you Timothy which DW dwell first in your what grandmother lo How can Paul Trace that Lo have a faith amen and lo is a woman she's not a man but Paul when he look at Timothy he said the gift that you have came from your grandmother yes I'm just reading the Bible dwell first in your grandm Louis and your mother who Unice so Louis give it to Eunice and Eunice hand it to Timothy jeans are you there and your mother un and I am persuaded that in you also so Paul is showing here that there is certain things in the life of Louis the grandmother that by lineage were transfer or handed down all the way to Timothy amen and Timothy ending up having this gift plus the ministry that he had but we can trace it on the mother side and Paul when he spoke about MEC he Trace liver on the father side Paul with melchisedek he traced liver on the father's side so you get stuff from Mama and you get Stu from Papa and What Mama Gave You Came from somebody else and what does somebody else gave somebody else came from somebody else and you cut into a trouble and you don't understand if it's something good like Timothy praise God but most of the time it's trouble they just hand it down and you got to deal with it open Ezekiel chapter 16 then we going to pray these Sharpies are th hope this is going to help we need one with a fat tip probably this will work Ezekiel chapter 16 if you dare you can say Amen blessed be the name of the Lord let's pray then Heavenly Father Lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy father and for everything you are doing for us Lord thank you for giving has another opportunity to meet together around the reveal word of the hour father we did what every human being that have a certain knowledge or knows how to read can do or may do Lord father but this is where we stop and now it is your time may you move me completely out of the way may you come down and speak to your children may father every demonic Spirit every spirit that makes people sleepy or every viruses every anxiety all kind of destructive Spirit Lord father we drive them away from this place to the dry places in the name of Jesus Christ May nothing else be present in the spiritual realm in this house but the Holy Spirit father may you come and speak to us mly anoint us Lord move me completely out of the way and deliver and bless your children father in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you you already been seated we on part 19 of the uh the three Feast of king aeres and the two banquet of Esther we are still in preparation to the second banquet everybody clear now when we sto last week we already spoke about this uh stage of the infancy when you are born when you are born the black dog is there because you born in sin you are shaping iniquity you're coming into the word speaking lies but even though that nature is there you are still under the blood of Jesus Christ and you are covered everybody clear until the age of accountability which is the age of 12 Years everybody clear now the black dog have certain area in your life that are locked or sealed and we explain it to you because no matter what you're going to do there is no as you you are a 2 years old 3 years old you will not have any sexual impulse that will be coming into your life the devil can put everything he want to put there there will be nothing else but molestation because the child doesn't know anything everybody clear so far praise the name of the Lord then we reach the stage of adolescence where you are awake or you are turned on everybody clear and according to brother Bram brother Bram told us that adolesence AG is a dangerous time of life and last week we found out that once you are in that stage the devil attacked you in three things the first one was what smoking everybody clear the second one was what drinking everybody clear and the third one was with what with women a promiscuous life or with men when it comes to a woman and the angel of the Lord told Brother Bram not to do three things not to smoke not to drink not to defy his body with what women and that is the Temptation that you get in ad in adolescence age because you are turned on and once you are turned on we find out that you are turned on by your hormone everybody clear because when you are born you didn't have all your hormone everything was laying dormant amen but that hormone when it's turned on on in your life it is like a dopping it is like they are giving you actually a marijuana amen and once he get into your system you get into a state of trouble you don't know how to handle it everybody clear I'm going to show you a scripture where B Brom say it's doping it's like doping everybody clear then you develop your sex characteristic we already explained it and now we are on Ezekiel 16 now on Ezekiel 16 verse three if you can go with me Hallelujah the Bible say and thus sa the Lord God to who to Jerusalem some people are still turning their Pages you there okay and thus say the Lord God to Jerusalem your what so the first thing God is speaking here God is talking about the birth when you look at the name birth in the Bible there is always a written part of the Bible and there is also a hidden part of the Bible and the hidden part of the Bible has been unveiled through the message of the hour the first thing God uh God is pointing out here number one he's talking about the birth amen when you talk about the birth of a person we are talking about that person being burn birth into a certain date everybody clear and that date also is actually keeping a certain relationship between your makeup and the Zodiac everybody's following me I told you I'm going to dig into certain Avenue everybody clear your birth praise the name of the Lord and let's go back again and say thus save the Lord God to Jerusalem your what birth and your Nativity which is your origin number two we have your origin or your Nativity where you come from everybody clear the origin your Nativity is of the land of what Canaan there is a location that is given there number three we have a location or we have what we call a birth place the place you were born are we together praise the name of the Lord come on your father now the origin is more clear now your father was an Amorite and your mother are height so your origin now that they are giving more clearanc it comes with from your father and your mother it didn't come from father and father it didn't come from Mother and mother it came from a father and a mother we already explained to you that everybody clear and as for your Nativity in the day you were born your NE was not cut neither were you washed in water to supper you you were not salted at all nor swad at all no I you to do any of this to you to have compassion upon you and you were cast out in a what an open field so after this birth happen the Lord is explaining here that after this child was born in a mess in a situation in a hopeless situation this child was cast into aopen field what has a fill mean in the bible keep your finger right here in Ezekiel 16 go to Matthew 13 we're going to come back again to Ezekiel amen we want you to be built upon the word of God Amen keep your finger on 16 because we're going to come back again praise the name of the Lord Matthew 13:36 if you dare you can say Amen few people everybody there then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciple came to him saying declare unto us the parable of the tears of what of the field he answered and said to them he that sth the good seed is the son of man verse 38 everybody with me the field is the what the the field is the world Amen so when you are born here let's go to Ezekiel 16 again you are cast out openly into the world in other words you came down from heaven and suddenly they put you into a hell amen and when they put you into a hell they put you into a bad situation am everybody clear and when you are coming into that bad situation the zodiac is pressing on you everybody clear the father and mother are giving you stuff everybody clear and also the place that you are that you are born is also pressing on you these are territory of the black dog yes sir amen because they are all connected with your body remember your soul is with him but your body is there amen but when you are a child usually you won't see these things working until you hit adolescence then you are turned on and you're going to see what these things are going to do to you everybody clear so far let's go back to verse uh five nor I pity you to do any of these unto you everybody clear to have compassion upon you but you were cast out into the open field into the open word anything into the word is right there everybody clear to the loving of your person you reach a point where you do stuff you don't even like yourself this is what dve people to be to commit suicide everybody clear in the day that you were born and when I passed by you and saw you how polluted in what so there was something about the blood of this woman that brought pollution and when we talk about the blood the blood that you receive comes from your father but that blood is polluted sir sir praise the name of the Lord amen it polluted in your own blood I say to you when you were in your blood live yeah I say to you when you were in your blood do what live everybody clear so when you are born into this condition God comes and just speak life to you because if there is no life that is spoken unto you you'll be dead everybody clear so far then you are living with a polluted blood that's why you are lying without anybody teaching you they ask you a question you just lie polluted under your blood you just can't help it everybody clear so we found out that in Ezekiel now the Lord spoke about the birth and kept quiet then when this child reach adolescence the Lord comes back again and we find the same thing into the life of Jesus Christ the Bible spoke about the birth of Jesus Christ and kept quiet until Jesus reached 12 years old then the Bible open up again everybody clear amen why only around 12 where brother brother already explained to us everybody clear brother Bram says now here he says when you were born everybody clear he start painting a picture now are you remember last week I showed you a chart of a pyramid everybody clear when you are born you are right here then you move on into Adolescence in adolescence it's it's your trans your your transition from your childhood into mature everybody clear then you're going to reach your Peak right here this peak is 25 years old everybody following me I know it's a different territory pay attention then once you cross 25 you begin to go down that's right are you following me then as more the more you go down you going to hit another pick in your life another stage in your life that is called menopause everybody clear and menopause just like the adolescence was a transition between your babyhood all the way to mature menopause is a trans it's your transition between your adulthood into an old age where you are coming back again like a baby amen praise the name of the Lord now brother Bram said that when you was born he started God God when you was born he started painting a picture so when you are in this stage right here you are just born God take something and begin to paint a picture amen you start getting old and when you get up about 25 years the picture is what so the age once you reach 25 years old whatever you look at 25 years old God take a picture of you and that is the way you're going to look for eternity everybody following me if you even if you die a 35 or a 40 when you're going to resurrect you're going to resurrect at 25 he said after you reach 25 all right death the black dog come on now everybody for me first thing you know you wake up on the morning and notice you say m you got wrinkle on you yes Dad on the gray hair coming too what is it Death setting 25 just keep growing you down crowding you down after a while it shall finally take you so slowly you begin to die when you reach 40 45 50 you wake up in the morning everything is aching you can't run like the way you do you are slowly dying amen but not everybody will die amen we will not all die some will be changed in a moment in the tweaking of an eye and they will go into heaven amen that change will come to bring you back to 25 Hallelujah but in the resurrection everything that death done will be what taken away the picture then you shall come back in a resurrection to a what Perfection because the black dog is completely out of your life everybody make understand amen a atom that create a blood cell will make a perfect one without sin can be destroyed never get old again everybody clear brother brandom continue he said it can be done only by the word of God God said you build up from a child when you first when your first leader cell begin to develop until you are about 21 or 22 maybe 25 years old you are at your best you are your best then that's the way God painted the picture the first thing you notice a gray hair comes in mother them beautiful eyes begin to wrinkle beneath look where they are sitting tonight old feeble gray don't worry Dy is death death set in on you after about what 25 years old everybody clear so far now once you reach puberty we explain to you that the love of filo open up everybody clear when he open up he releases the black dog when he releases the black dog god comes in that age and he want to claim you because God want to help you up to move move on with you everybody clear jop down to verse 8 of uh Ezekiel chapter 16 now when I pass by you the second time and look upon you on verse seven we already seen that the woman is growing the breast is form and everything now when I pass by you and look upon you behold your T was the ter of what this is not agape love this is fil your love which is love lower than agap in other words your hormone are shooting up you are now mature you ready for creation you can now multiply everybody clear and I spread my water my skirt over you remember Ru was asking boas for something he said cover me with what with your skirt so when you reach that age of adolescence God comes and claim you for marriage amen God want to enter a covenant with you and I told you if you miss that AG to receive the Holy Ghost then you're going to learn the hard way everybody clear praise the name of the Lord behold your time was the time of love and I spread my skirt over you and cover your what nakedness why because your eyes are turned on your innocency is gone now the lamp God have to come and say Adam Adam where are thou because your eyes are open you begin to be ented about young ladies you begin to be interested about young men God is coming now he says now the Eyes Are Open they know good and evil I need to cover them I need to provide a lamb I need to provide a sacrifice to cover you so I can begin your journey everybody clear I spread my skirt over you and cover your nakedness why God didn't worry about it back then because you were under the state of innocency just like Adam and Eve am everybody clear now i s to you and enter into what into a covenant with you say the Lord and you became what mine why is he important for that everybody clear because when you reach that age brother br explain to us that at the age of accountability once you reach it a spirit also come the devil also come and try to slow you down and say don't get converted don't get into marriage with Christ spend your time enjoy the world first you are too young you don't have to be acting like an old people the only thing that keep me from being Sav was when I was 12 years old because a what a spirit hung over me a what a devil saying what wait a little while longer why that devil didn't talk to you when you were 3 years old why he didn't talk to you when you were 5 years old why did he came when your sexual activity begin to uh being uh uh turned on that's the time he came he said no don't be acting like like old people you are still young you need to go enjoy life everybody there it is the devil trying to deviate you from the plan of God everybody following me Hallelujah that is the reason you are not saved when you become the age of the age of accountability a spirit everybody there and that spirit is who the devil everybody clear so far now on Song of Solomon when you read this Solomon is explain to us that this love burn like fire I don't want you to go there just stay with Ezekiel everybody there that th love burn like fire Solomon said do not awake love until it's satisfied because once you awaken that love there is no way for you to quench it that's why Paul say if you burn Mary because it's a burning desire everybody following me praise the name of the Lord no problem we're going to get there now the first thing when I went to a person and found their what we talk to you that there were three elements that are spoken here number one the birth which which connect you to the Zodiac the Zodiac means you are born under a son everybody clear some are Libra some are scorpio some whatever it is everybody clear the second is your origin which is coming from your blood and you have a part from your father and another part from the mother just like Timothy got his the third one is your location or your birthplace now brother Bram said that when he talk he went to a person he need to find out about their birthplace why everybody clear and what what what sign that they were born under Amen brother have to find about your birthplace everybody following me and the Zodiac son you were born under why do you need that brother brandham let's go by the birthplace go to Daniel go to Daniel chapter 10 if you dare you can say Amen Daniel chapter 10 everybody got their Bible praise God Daniel chapter 10 if you dare you can say Amen verse 12 are you there go back to verse one so it makes sense in the third year of sarus king of what pers Persia a thing was revealed to who was Daniel a mid Oran Daniel was a Jew anybody following me but he was taken into captivity to Babylon and he lived under the Babylonian Empire everybody following me then after a while the Midian came and destroyed Babylon and took over and then the kingdom changed into the kingdom of the Persian amen here he was in the land of Israel he moved from Israel and went into the land of Babylon the land did not change are you following me but the kingdom changed you following me when the kingdom changed the land was still the same but another influence came and took over the kingdom and Daniel was in that specific spot you understand now now jum to verse 12 then said he to me fear not Daniel for from the first day that you did set your heart to understand and to chesten yourself before your God your words were heard and I am come for your words in other words the first time you start praying I already heard you but why you didn't come why did it take so long God for me to receive my answer I pray for 21 days the second third fourth day you don't come it seems like nothing is happening you cannot be praising God or praying unto God like that am when you are breaking a Rock Amen you follow me if you take a hammer if you hit the rock the first time it will look like the rock does not move do you follow me the rock is moving but it's moving in the way that your eyes cannot see there are crack that are happening into the Rock but your eyes are not meant to see it until those crack reach a certain place so when you reach the when you reach the uh U the rock the first time you will he P like nothing if you lazy you're going to stop there if you go the second time P nothing the more you do it the first s you going to hear the sound begin to change the rock that was pain P begin to go boop boop boop amen the crack have been forming all along until the last one when he hit it The Rock will fly into pieces so when you pray and it seems like nothing happened don't stop that is a good sound that is happening you keep pressing and praying you keep pressing and praying you keep pressing and praying after a while that sound of your son will begin to change that sound of your daughter will begin to change after a while we want to come back to church after a while momy I will go back to church with you this morning it is the sound changing don't stop there continue to hit until the child is completely redeemed everybody clear so far now verse 13 but they Prince of what the prince of the kingdom of what soel was in the land of Babylon but because the kingship changed the kingdom changed everybody clear that Spirit took over the land now when Daniel is praying there is somebody that is blocking prayers why your birth place everybody clear verse 13 but the priest of the kingdom of what if you notice they don't call him the king they call him a prince amen this Prince is a demonic Spirit yes sir everybody following me it is a devil everybody following me and they come from the category called principalities that's why you hear principalities and power it is category of Angel amen so under the principalities there are two Kingdom there is the kingdom of Satan and there is the kingdom of God and Satan have his principalities yeah he have Angel under the category of principalities those Angel are called Prince and they are responsible for nation every nation in this world have a demonic angel that is taking influencing that Nation are you following me let's go back to 13 but the prince of the kingdom of what Persia with stod me one and 120 days but L Michael one of the what Michael also is a prince amen that's why in Revelation 10 Michael Christ come [Music] down so there must be a nation yes sir sir there must be a nation that Marco want to stand for Marco usually naturally stand for Israel but the Israel is the briad Redemptive name that's why he Dro first in Revelation 10 before we move to Revelation 11 because there is a gentile nation that is the Bride of Jesus Christ and that means the preach to stand for them Hallelujah and when he jumed down he put one foot on the earth one foot on the water he's blocking the two Beast of Revelation 13 he's blocking Rome and he's blocking America because the brde is [Applause] there Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord but the pray the prince of the Kingdom Michel the prince but he is an archangel and the voice of the Archangel the voice of Michael that's why he was in the book of Jude about Moses amen but the priest of the kingdom of Persia with stod me one and 12 days but L who Michael one of the chief the chief princes so Michael is the top of the PRI that's why brother say Mar was Christ he is above every principalities above every Power above every demon above every name that is named on this world and into the word to come his name is Jesus Hallelujah one of the chief princes came to do what to help me I remain there with the kings of what no problem jum to verse 20 Hallelujah why the birth place you there then say he no you dfor I come to you and now I will return to fight with who the prince of pers that angel that stand there there is a Prince of America there is a prince of Canada there is a prince of Mexico Every Nation have a spirit that's why brother Bram say every nation have a national spirit it's a PRI Germany a PRI FR a PRI in Africa every country have a princess it is a demonic represent that is anointing that place are you there so if you come from a different country and you back in America here there is a spirit you must be careful because you are in the land of America everybody clear then say he no you wherefor I come to you and now I will return to fight with the prince of who and when I'm gone forth Lord the priest of what you see in another Nation they have a demonic power there that's why brother say every Kingdom Under the heaven is under Satan that's why in Matthew 4 Satan Show Jesus the kingdom of the word and he said they all belong to who because he have every representation that is anointing those Kingdom the politics of those Kingdom they are giving report and anointing the devil and anointing the country with a demonic anointing and they're giving report to the devil they are called princes principalities but the name of Jesus is above principalities amen praise the name of the Lord and the prince of Grecia shall come but I will show you that which is noted in the scripture of Truth and there is none that hold with me these things but who so the one when it comes to the Deep Revelation amen you need who that's why he came in Revelation 10 because the mighty angel must come down because the seven angel must reveal the mystery contained into the book and when it comes to Revelation only Michael everybody there but Mar what your prince the prince of the nation of Israel naturally and the bride spiritually everybody clear so far so when the Bible spoke about the location brother Bram say when I talk to you I need to know your birthplace your location your country your nation because there is a demonic influence that is there everybody clear number two and what sign the son that they were born under everybody clear and when I get these two pieces and could tell what what what their birth was once brother Bram have this idea amen and brother Bram understand that you were born under sarius and Libra whatever and Pisces then brother brandham can tell the direction of your life let's go which those two element which way is sets in the natural nature set them into a what into a certain line so when you are born in this world you are born in sin sheap in iniquity coming into the LI into the word speaking lies amen the Zodiac son that you are born under is actually shifting your life to behave a certain way I'm going slowly everybody here and then in that birthplace that nation that you were born the spirit of that nation is also bringing an influence upon you coule with your zodiac Amen in other words somebody is putting a software that you going to be operating under do you follow me amen you will see certain people have a tendency to always follow people amen they cannot take decision on their own am everything they do they must follow somebody since their childhood they are like after somebody always after somebody if that person get in trouble they get in trouble if that person do something they do something that is a makeup everybody clear and if you don't watch you going to get into marriage and your marriage will be guided by somebody else do you follow me do you follow me if sister so and so say this that's what you going to do in your marriage amen if that sister goes to the mall you go to the mall do you follow me if that sister is rude to a husband you copy after her if that sister start working you also start working and sometime you might even find yourself going into her schedule and following even the place she's working you don't understand it is your makeup that is pushing you like that and your home is directed by another man amen God deal with the Gentile individually take a decision of your marriage yourself take the decision of your life yourself don't follow somebody else because the way God want you to go is different than someone else amen we want to copy one another we copy everything you don't understand are you doing that okay sir I want to find a job where do you want to work I want to work where brother so and so say did God see you in that job are you there I'm doing business like brother so and so did God seize you in that business you going to find he's prospering because that is the way God make him up to he is in his position but you are not in your position and you're going to be fighting and he's riding free because your makeup is just to copy copy copy before you take a decision you have to call brother so and so brother so and so and see what they think before you spoke you can speak on yourself messed by the Zodiac are you following me Lord help me which setting their line their natural natur nature I'm sorry setting them in a certain line when they are what reborn reborn again do you follow me why rebirth why do you have to be born again because somebody have to overcome the Zodiac amen amen if you are not born again you won't help amen that's it right you have a difficulty saying things straight you always speak in a political way you see somebody you ask him a question he doesn't want to hurt people's feeling it's a zodiac and then people will perceive you as a compromiser Hallelujah when they are reborn again they are over here into another what because somebody overcome that's everybody clear the son conquered that everybody clear and then when you find into this nature that is the inside in conscience inside conscience the outside conscience move you into what that is your natural birth then they shall make up something and put them what and put them what under a for and put them into a what split condition they don't know what they do they shall say the Lord want me to do this in other words you come up with your own idea and you are putting that yourself uh I believe maybe God want me to do this and then you do you do and finally you are confused because of this stuff everybody CLE so far praise the name of the Lord hallelujah brother ofam say we are nether German come on French come on Belgium come on come on or American or brother Bram say as a Christian you don't belong to none of [Applause] them are you following me are you following me this church is not an African church this church is not an American church this church is not a European church this church is the Church of the Living God are you following me never use

bad Spirit don't bring those Spirit here but what are we what are we we are what I want everybody to say that we are what if you have a problem with a sister go see her personally do you follow me if you have a problem with brother Michael don't include brother Preston do you hear me go deal with brother Preston you and him according to Matthew 18 and say the it and hug one another and let's move

living under your National Spirit which is a demon come out from among them come out my people belong to the kingdom of God we are Christian brothers and [Music] sister some of your brother in the flesh will go to hell what are you going to do with it you going to follow them in Hell the your true brother is the one who's going in the Rapture with you right everybody clear American act like

from Heaven who are you I'm a Christian that's all that's all keep your nationality for the immigration not for the church that is the holy spirit coming from God out of what there is no Nation from here over there Hallelujah and you act like that make you conduct yourself as they do up there because you are from another you are under Michael Hallelujah we are living in what that's true that is the what the black dog you follow me but the soul that is redem that conduct us our character is from what we are in the world but we are not of the world Hallelujah we live from above because we are born from what all Christian comes from what where are you from I'm from [Music] above Hallelujah Jesus say I am not from below I am from above if he was from below my subject will fight for me but my kingdom is from what which kingdom are you in are you there so is every man that is born of the kingdom of God he is from what learn that and avoid trouble with me everybody clear so when you are born your zodiac put you in a certain line when you are born the location your birth place put an imprint of you do you see why God want to help you yes sir do you see why God want to help you now at your birth the origin here can I raise this yes at your birth we know that praise the name of the Lord we are born in sin shaping iniquity coming into the word speaking Lies when you are born we are born by sex amen when you go down into the M macromolecular way Papa Carri the sperm yeah you should not say that brother Steven it's on your board brother Bram say it everybody there Mama carry the egg everybody clear when the when there is a discharge brother Bram spoke about that everybody clear when a sperm is released from Daddy it Trav having a genetic package I'm trying to help you you're going to see things that you do in your life amen that genetic package comes and that blood cell which is called The Germ the blood cell that comes from your father have a limited life you follow me the life that was given to that S is to carry the genetic package from your father and to bring it to you they gave him a tail so that he can move and make it way out are you teaching biology listen here it might be one egg the OV Plum back in the back in the middle of the what sperm will come up I'm now going to put my gloves Democrat speaks things plainly that's right you might think a republican uh-uh don't put me in any of them will come up a germ and go meet it show that some intelligence determine whether it's going to be redheaded blackheaded whether it's going to be a little big male of what female the female by the gene carry the same gene XX everybody clear the daddy carry XY everybody clear so the one who determine the sex of the child is Daddy if Daddy release X mama will always release x x x you have a girl everybody clear if Daddy release y mama always ex then you have a boy everybody clear praise the name of the Lord hallelujah you can't you can't do nothing else about it won't work you can mix them together and everything it won't make a difference God determines it because it's one in a million sometime you thinks it's the first one no sometime you think it's the second one no it might be the very back one that's going to cross everybody and poop that you that's why brother Bram say the natural birth is more mysterious than the Virgin birth are you following me now this father is known it might be you this is a human it's known we know him this mother is known she's human everybody clear whether it is inv anybody following me whether the natural conception happen in the womb of Mama everybody oh whether he happen in vual into a tube and they have to implanted into mama the origin still come from human beings everybody in vual is not a virgin birth because it's coming from a man or for a woman everybody following me but when God created Jesus Christ God never drew the sperm from any man do you follow me he created the sperm and he created the overy and he put them together because Jesus was meis EDC with that father with that mother with that lineage he was God in flesh Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord somebody come and help me here you can fix it praise the name of the Lord go ahead and fix it everybody clear praise the name of the Lord so brother Bram says here after a while one little germ will crawl into that field which is the egg or the ovary and what was a little tail that I just drew up there on there twisting around drop off everybody clear and there start the spine of the baby everybody clear so now we find out in the scripture here you got it no there is a let me help you up here you got it praise the name of the lord always Hallelujah let me get it you got it you got to spin it this way that's it me get it okay that's it let's blast him again everybody clear so when Jesus Christ was born Jesus doesn't have any lineage you cannot come and say the papa of Jesus was so and so or the mama of Jesus was so and so became because he came after MEC without father without mother but me and you whether it's in Vivo or in vual all of them will still carry a baggage somewhere Jesus have a pure body that's why Jesus was not a Jew amen he was not a gentile Jesus was God manifested in human flesh no papa no mama if you take his DNA you Chas it there's nothing because he's mc mc became Jesus Christ everybody so when the two meet and they fuse amen Mama carry her ovy a birth all of them all the number a birth but government they lock the black dog at puberty they begin to go one by one anybody following me what happen with Mama Hallelujah when the over develop into Mama they don't develop fully they develop up to a certain stage and they stop amen it is the sperm from daddy that activate that ovary and bring it to maturity if he misses it he dies both the sperm and the ovary have a limited time everybody feel me but once they fuse life or conception happen when conception happen conception also have a time frame either 8 month or 9 month you got to come out you follow me the Cs will begin to multiply as brother Bram say but you are not there yet this life this life this life is only a life that was given to prepare or to build up your body do you follow me that's why you will see the BR say you the baby is not alive everybody following me that's why you going to see in other place brother Bram say there is life going on there brother brandham does not contradict himself it depends on how you look at when you talking about conception life is there but when you talk about the actual individual life is not there you don't understand the prophet chill out he's not contradicting himself better there when this body is form you are still outside everybody clear when you are born you coming out of Mama the car is ready is coming out from the dealership amen now your body have only few times to remain alive until you enter if you don't enter the body is dead it's a still born everybody clear praise the name of the Lord where are you heading buddy don't worry praise the name of the Lord may not your sin it is either what a direct or indirect it may be you inherited somewh the weakness of your people who sin and he drop down as he said each generation get what and what wiser now in order in redeeming sickness we have to apply sickness as a result of sin sickness is not sometime your sin Direct in other word what you did that's why God is whooping you sometime it's not that's why when you go to the doctor they say give your family history have you ever in in your your family somebody have sugar diabetes somebody have blood pressure amen what you are suffering now you are just you were just handed that down everybody clear praise the name of the Lord now inherited the sin of your parent or your forefather each generation get wiser and weaker and wiser because we inherit differences you see what you inherit and the sickness and the disease of of the body as he keep handing down from what from generation it keep going from one generation to another brother brandham continue he said what brought sickness into the world was sin when men drop away from God's provided way he opened himself to every devil there was to sickness and so forth because he has to keep medicine and spray it's just each generation in breathing into another now you might be a Christian you following me and you and your wife might be a what but the gene of your body the black dog is still the inheritance from what father from your father and your grandfather on down everybody following me so when this conception happen Mama have given you some of the stuff from my family daddy gave you some of the stuff from the family and those stuff has been delivered and built into you and the Zodiac come and build something into you and your nation come and hook something to you you are born in a mess Hallelujah everybody clear praise the name of the Lord where are you heading now my Christian brothers and sisters whoever he may be now most of time when you find people that is got a what a stubborn Spirit it is usually a what comp a complex that caus this yes either they have inherited from mother you follow me from father from Uncle and oh grandfather grandmother somebody like that and if you trace it back down through your life you shall find it just like Timothy receive a gift from his grandmother that passes to the mother all the way to the Tim all the way to Timothy not only good stuff go bad stuff also hang out now I have taken this by experience under discernment because I have met case men met cases on the platform thousands of those that head that Spirit stubborn you speak don't listen speak don't listen speak don't listen speak don't listen the only way to break it is the new birth and the first thing you know as a chase that Spirit right back by discernment and found that there was a granddaddy there was a grandmother there was somebody else back down there and you inherit that by what everybody clear praise the name of the Lord now we getting for instance a few days ago I was called on a scene or a little something going on there was a what is this young boy a bad boy follow me carefully can I raas this praise the name of the Lord did brother brandham say I found a bad boy a fine boy praise God a fine young man very fine boy he was going with a little girl according very fine Le a girl out of a fine family you ready fine boy let me put it down here fine boy fine men young men fine a young lady how was the family fine family are you following me family fine boy fine girl fine where is the trouble coming from amen amen amen Adam a Son of God that's what the Bible say Luke 3:38 everybody clear Eve came

find girl out of a fine family and this boy all of a sudden a fine boys in the church F girl in the church calling one another sweet God bless you God bless you they're thinking about their family suddenly the boy flips what is going on what is going on Amen all of sudden this boy came up with some kind of an idea and he just what the family's fun daddy and mommy are Christian the boy has been raised in the church sitting just like you and me everybody clear he engaged into a relationship because he want to get married suddenly he flips and cut it off and walk away it's a fine boy it's a fine girl what is going on Lord Jesus in Jesus name let's cast this demonic cast this demon cast this demon that's what we do amen came up with some kind of idea and he just walked away he did something wrong to the little girl and much has promised her to do a certain things and didn't do it and instead of coming to the girl and apologizing like a gentleman should do he he just was not in him to what he did something wrong the solution is very simple just go back and say I'm sorry but something in that fine boy is blocking K the boy to say I'm sorry how can me and my husband have a small argument and it's blown it's on Facebook it's all over the world Amen and when you put two people together you talk you don't even find the problem this one say I wanted to do this and this and the small argument turn into a fight that can cause divorce what is going on the black dog territory you ready and the father and the mother that call me to the sin say we will desire to know what is wrong with our our Fanboy now we going to the boys Fanboys the one who called brother Bram was the mother and the father of this boy everybody following me the girl also have her father and her mother

what to ask what or ask what they just won't do it it's not just in them it is in train in the family brother Bram now the what in the father and the mother of this boy no matter how much they are the black dog still Remer that is inter breed out of this boy still remain the flesh therefore the boy has got a complex in him you are converted your wife is converted filled with the Holy Spirit but

you are not you are kind forgiving what is it the Holy Spirit you are no more what you are it is Christ in you say now that same thing have to happen to what in other word will happen to you that change you that's why the Bible say when you are born again you become a new what all the old stuff are what the black dog because Joshua have entered and he's neutralizing the black dog and pushing you toward Redemption that's right hallelujah hallelujah and the father raised up brother bam is explaining the daddy raised up he said no no no no no no brother Bram he said my son went to the altar brother Bram he was baptized correctly in the name of Jesus Christ and what the Baptist mean the PO say I know my son has come to Christ he's arguing with the prophet I say that may be all right all the outward motions he might be identified as a Believer with the believer that's why you seen young people running the altar do stuff pray pray pray pray tomorrow they go a w again and they sit like I thought I pray they told me to do whatever thing I did but why am I still like this are you there but until he's what born again I shall advise the young men to never what marry a woman you cannot get married until you first married with Christ when you are married with Christ as the son of righteousness when he come through your life he conquers your birth he conquer your origin he conquer your birthplace and he make you suitable not to be a hell to somebody are you there but many enter into the marriage with that's why you fought 15 years you felt like I need to come out of it he doesn't behave like my daddy who told you he was your daddy he's not like my mom who told you that is your mama are you there that may be all right but until he's regenerated Born Again advise that young man to never marry a woman he shall make Heaven on Earth for her you see how you play games and you're going to suffer why other the people are enjoying their marriage you the one that's going to suffer with a stubborn wife a starborn husband if you don't do what they do they get moody they block you 1 Corinthians 7 do you want me to read it to you yes sir open First Corinthians 7 I'm a
