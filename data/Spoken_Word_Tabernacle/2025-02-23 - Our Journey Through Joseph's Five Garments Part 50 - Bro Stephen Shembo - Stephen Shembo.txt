we pray God to protect the baby and they are all doing great by God's grace yesterday we had our young sister's meeting 4 hours meeting amen this is the first meeting that we have so many questions like that unbelievable 4 hours meeting so we cover we we we even went back a little bit on courtship and move back and cover everything on engagement I sent to Sister adasa the database all the document of the Court they printed out for free so everybody you go ahead and get those copy and you know exactly what the prophet say about everything that we spoke about amen for those who missed yesterday the copy will be at the deacons so you go visit sister Joan she'll be more than happy to sit with you and you can watch that with sister Joan and make sure you catch up yourself but if you miss I'm going to still hold you responsible for the material that was delivered are we together am so these are very difficult and tough and very tough subject when it comes to vow and everything like I say I am preaching to the young people I don't want to come and deal with a divorce I'm going one time you go there and then we finish with seal it the next day we see you in the Rapture you and your husband and your children over there I'm dealing with the old generation that that didn't have the teaching that you have and I'm even giving you things that me myself as a pastor didn't even know amen I didn't know that brother Bram did a proposal under the tree all of those are in the court over there amen and me have to correct brother Bram about the proposal and tell him you don't put a ring on me until you talk to my parent I got the quote over [Applause] there I got the quote over there amen I gave you all the quotes the quotes are over there amen like I said if a young man was not tou like you you have a responsibility to recalibrate the young man and bring him back again online amen every single quat is over there for free so that has been said amen there is no fcet there is no problem now amen I'm saying this before something comes up because some people wait till there is a problem and they run on the problem and say I'm going to leave the church but they already purpose to leave the church they were waiting for a problem so there is no problem now okay there is no problem now so parent everything that I have been teaching this children they gaed I print out everything and this is the standard that we have for this church am I am not going to lower any standard I am not going to change any standard I am not going to I mean compromise any standard because everything that was brought up came from the Bible and the message of the hour you voted me to preach the Bible according to the message of the hour are we clear so if a child a young man or a young sister in this church go against what has been taught are we together yeah are we together if the parent compromise with it yeah count me out amen amen am brother can you say amen amen count me completely out Amen in other word if you go against everything that we discussed yesterday yes and that I taught you in courtship and whatever amen don't put pressure on me I am not going to bless your marriage you didn't get me well if I have to preach this and go home that's fine let's make sure because there is no problem no sir if an unbeliever is coming from denomination and they don't know anything about the message and they come to me they have been probably leaving as a boyfriend have children and they say brother Stephen we want you to bless the marriage it's a different story I will sit with them I will go through the teaching and everything and make sure everything is clear before I lay my hand that's why when they call me in uh Ohio I have to make sure everything is correct if not I don't lay my hand on you are we together you are not off the street God gave you a best privilege ever that we did in have are we together if you didn't show up that's your problem that's not my problem God gave you the best privilege ever that's true amen we taught you everything before you get in trouble that's true so if you turn around and you go against the word of God that's it let's be clear par I am not going to bless your marriage you need to find another Pastor don't even invite me because I won't be there to support what I know is against the word of God don't put the pressure on brother John to announce your marriage right here don't put the pressure on the song leader to announce your marriage here don't put the pressure on the young people to pull them to the marriage that is contrary to the word of God don't put a pressure on the church to bring people to support you because you're doing something contrary to the word are we together count me out are we together I preach Church order here I preach every single office in the church order here every single of them the copies are there if you want to know it's right there I even invited the whole church to be there so if you don't comply with what has been preached sit down on the Pew I preach about music part one part two part three everything about music is right here if you don't comply as a musician sit down but don't bring any influence right here and don't pull somebody don't put in other word do not put any pressure right here amen we already established everything parent they're going to have the quote you can take the quote from them you can read all the quot we can be on the same page if you want to see the tap Theon have it you go to Theon you canw everything clear are we together so don't put pressure on me I'm not going to bless your wedding I'm not going to even be there because you're going against the word of God there was a young man that came to me I told him I said what you're trying to do is against what brother Bram say he left the church and went marry thank God he didn't even call me because I would not even go are we together so if we get to the point we got to separate let's separate in peace amen there is no problem are we together but as for me and this church I'm going to stay behind the word behind the message of the hour and behind the word are we together amen are we together amen so parents do not make those daughter to compromise because there was a question yesterday we are trying to stand on the ground on the message and the parent are compromising so brother Bram say no dad is saying that's okay you can go ahead and do it momm is saying that's okay you can go ahead and do it that's not correct I taught them I gave them quote even about the gift yesterday when should a man give you a gift all of them are in the court over there all of them are in the court according to brother BR are we together so parent let's stick together I already called you and I told you do not be aggressive toward men that's right young sisters do not be aggressive to men courtship is not marriage Amen in courtship you don't go to the men's house and begin to wash dishes and begin to wash the bathroom and begin to be a a door dash for the young men to bring him and deliver food over there parent when you see things like this chase them away from home tell them don't come home I don't know if you got them I don't know if you get it amen yes we clear it together you are not married you are not a married woman they are cing you amen if your husband is in Mississippi you don't leave here to go to Mississippi I already told you yesterday the husband leave Mississippi and come right here Amen to see you amen you don't leave here and book a hotel to go see your boyfriend don't buy him gift he is the one to win your soul I'm talking some of you are laughing this is not a game this is not a game are we together respect yourself and the young men will respect you give yourself honor you are not sheep you are Daughters of the king you are Gods amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] know where this came up of of young sister begging men like it's the last marriage in the entire world who put you under pressure and parent don't put them under pressure brother Bram say you should not marry a boy because your mother love him that's what brother BR say Amen if you get beaten your mother won't get beaten you'll be the one beat amen so make sure you find the head a true Christian amen are we together amen are we together amen parent are we together in courtship don't beg the young men don't go to their houses and wash dishes and vacuuming their house don't do that are we together are we together so I put Heaven and Earth to be witness between me and you that everything is clear the video at the Deacon the quotes are over there young men once we finish the the finances then we start courtship with them all of them need to be on the same page is it a false vow is it a true V what every answer was answered yesterday with quote after quote after quote after quote so don't come and search for trouble again and say this is this I'm not going to be part of it I'm going to be at home sitting with my family and you have your marriage over there where you going to go to hell that's your problem there was a man it's not in this church a young man who left the message and he was putting pressure on his siblings to leave the message and I was talking to the Father the father told me that I told him you go to hell yourself so don't pull people with you are we together young people watch what you supporting watch what you supporting because what you supporting you'll be held the accountable according to the scripture oh I just want to show a support no no no no if it's contrary to the word do not go amen are we together amen are we together are we together praise God we are not popping balloons right here in the message your pastor is I see all this stuff I'm on I'm I'm I'm not a old pastor and I told somebody you want to be a pastor in this message today you got to you you you need to know you got to get in technology and see what these people are doing your pastor knows all about the popping balloons and everything I already screen all of that so no foolishness in this church are we together amen no foolishness in this church are we together are we together amen come on now let's give the Lord a big clap of [Music] [Music] praise God s you can keep this if somebody come with FES I will call the whole church and say you remember me telling you that day don't put pressure on me amen let's all stand behind the word of God and let's stand for the reading of the scripture amen let's be true message Believers brother Steven preachers the message they begin to preach the message you begin to pick and choose no no no no no no we don't pick and choose we stay right there mama don't want to stay with the message stay with the message daddy don't want to stay with the message stay with the message Pastor don't want to stay with the message you stay with the message regardless of anyone if it's in the word it's about your life at the end of the day you will be the one married and you're going to live with that Rascal and usually they are crows they don't die quickly no they don't no they don't they don't die quickly they will make you suffer they don't die quickly you will be praying God kill him God kill him he won't die quickly and you will be the best preacher in the message about the coming of the Lord may the Lord come quickly because your marriage is bad are we together are we together I'm sparing you a lot of headache you need to ask yourself a question why are the old the one keep saying I wish I knew this I wish I knew this and you are right there and you don't even care you want to go the hard way oh brother stepen I was not there you are responsible to go to the Deacon and listen to it but I'm not going to lower my standard I am not going to lower my standard I was talking to somebody I said this is what I taught in church he's not a member of this church I said this is what I taught in church I'm not changing the standard because what I brought came from the message of the hour and from the Bible I'm not going to back up are we together because the only protection we have is the message that's right when you start playing with the message you are destroying the protection then we're in trouble amen am amen ah you are our honees I gave you the quote so I'm jealous of you amen my baby's in the gospel I'm very jealous of you I gave you you three quotes and so don't search any problem let's go to the Book of Luke H it's a

today Luke 15 very familiar again verse 11 if you there you can say amen amen the Bible says and he said this is Jesus talking a certain man has two sons and they younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that falls to me and he divided to them his living you may be seated and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country you understand this clearly now and there wasted his substance with riotous living which are harlots amen jop to verse uh 17 and when he came to himself he said how many hired servant of my father have bread enough and to spare and I perish with Hunger I will arise and go to my father and will say to him father I have Sinn against heaven and before you and I'm no more worthy to be called your son make me as one of your hired servant and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him and the son said to him father I have Sinn against heaven and in your sight and I'm no more worthy to be called your sons if you notice the father never said that forgave you that's right the father didn't say that the father just HG him kiss him and that was it amen so when he's expressing his repentance the father say in on verse 22 but the father said to his servant bring forth the best Rob and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and bring here the FED calf this is where we pick up the Cal the young Bullock and went to the Book of Leviticus are we together and kill it and let us be merry H let us eat and be merried for this my son was dead and he's alive again he was lost and he's found and they begin to be merry now let's clam my theme this morning is prayer ansers and answer amen amen amen prayer amen incense and answer are we together amen according to Leviticus 4 we found out that when the sacrifice was killed there were three application on the sacrifice the first one they have to apply the Blood on the veil with a finger which is the blood have to go upon the individual that will house deity amen because that was the veil of the uh Badger skin the second one the blood have to be put upon the horns of the golden altar or the altar of incense amen which we are dealing with now which we find that it's a prayer that we were dealing with and the last one the blood have to go at the bottom of the Brazen altar yes which Lord's willing we will see how far we go if not we can pick it up on next Sunday amen now the blood first goes onto the individual the one who's going to be veiling deity and the blood move from there into the horn and to the bottom you cannot apply the blood on the veil without applying the blood on the horn and you you cannot apply the blood on the horn without putting the blood on the bottom of the altar all this goes together whatever affect the first one automatically will affect the second one are we together if God forgive you for your sins automatically God have to hear your prayer are we together amen are we together because God does not hear sinners so if you are forgiven automatically God have to hear your prayer put a finger right there and let's uh climb up a little bit let's go to the book of act and we come back to look let's go to act chapter 9 so we can put some stabilizing screw somewhere amen because as far as being redeemed everybody sure for that I have been for uh forgiven but when it comes to hearing prayer then we are ify there are sometime God hear my prayer and sometime God doesn't hear the prayer but the blood is already put on your altar and the Bible say God doesn't hear sinner you are no longer a sinner so guess what God must heal you if you say are you saved of course are all your prayer being answered ah ah brother Sten I'm going to be honest with you there are some prayer that I never seen God answer me are we together but what I'm telling you if the blood will sprinkled upon you seven time the blood doesn't stop there the same blood that cleans you must also open up the pipe am the same blood must reconnect your telephone with Heaven because sin Calla a telephone Interruption they catch your service but because you pay the price they have to reconnect your service back your phone must work if it doesn't work reboot your phone and your phone must work amen are we together let's go to act 9 verse one if you thereare you can say Amen according to act 1 9 verse1 we talking about Saul or Paul the Bible say and Saul yet breathing out threatenings and Slaughter against the disciple of the Lord we're dealing with a sinner right here amen which Paul say I'm the chiefest one the top of him amen went to the high priest and desire of him led her to Damascus he was so zealous he even went to the high priest he said give me permission amen I'm going to make an example of these people to the synagogue that if I found any of the of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them B to Jerusalem are we together amen we're dealing with a sinner a religious sinner here verse three and as he journeyed this is Paul he came near to Damascus and suddenly there shine run about him a light from heaven and he fell on the earth and heard a voice saying to him Saul SA why persecute you me are we together amen and so and he said who are you Lord and the Lord say I am Jesus whom you persecute it is hard for you to kick against prins amen and Paul say verse 6 and he trembling the Bible say and he trembling and astonished say Lord what will you have me to do and the Lord said to him arise and go into the City and he shall be told you what you must do we don't see any anywhere here where Paul say I'm sorry Lord please put your seat Bel did you see any any sorry here amen Paul just turned around he say when he realized when God brought to him the light about what he was doing and he and who he was persecuting Saul just changed his mind now he say Lord what do you want me to do amen when he asked that question he was a son of a change if I lost you you raise your hand Jesus I I have not read brother Bram yet let me start it again okay amen normally Paul should say Lord Jesus uh-huh I am so sorry about what I have been doing I didn't know I was persecuting you when I was persecuting the disciple now I'm sorry forgive me for everything I say I'm I'm asking you forgiveness for all my sin and everything Paul just say what should I do now Lord that's why brother Bram say repentance is a change hallah you must say with your mouth that forgive me but you don't mean it am you are doing that for formality amen you are doing that because you want to gain something if I don't ask forgiveness then all my benefit have been cut off so I'm just going to make a show like I'm asking forgiveness but truly I don't mean to change Mommy I'm sorry for what I say thank you son but truly he's not he's not even asking for that he knows if he does that Mommy will cut him off amen but they don't mean to repent that's why brother brand say to repent means you change direction are we together are we together so it's not just about word but it goes beyond the word it goes with what is happening in your heart amen I hope we together we trying to know how our prayer must be amen amen are we together and Paul didn't say forgive me but when because he asked a question who are you and God identify himself he say I am Jesus he say now Lord what should I do in other words I realize what I was doing so what should I do are we together because somebody else would have say who is that Jesus that I should obey you that's what Pharaoh say are we together but he changed he said what m in other word tell me now what to do amen that I can change my life it's already a work in the heart follow me carefully my friend are we together did we see Jesus telling him that I forgive you but something already happened to Paul because when Paul is progressing in his ministry amen amen am he's using this experience yes he say I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision he said King agria I was going I remember going in the middle of the day and the light struck me and I fell down so this is an experience that change Paul amen are we together am we were on verse uh uh six the Bible say and he trembling and astonished say Lord what will you have me to do and the Lord said to him arise and go into the City and it shall be told you what you must do in other word we expecting Paul to go somewhere and say the Lord told me now that uh you need to tell me something what are you supposed to tell me okay you need to repent you need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ let's see what happened to Paul are we together Amen jop to verse n and he was three days with sight and neither did he eat did eat no what so he was fasting three days are we together this is a man that was a sinner but changed Direction already by changing direction nobody told him to fast amen are we together automatically the man is on Fast follow me my friend verse 10 and there were was a certain disciple at Damascus named who ananas and to him say the Lord in a vision ananias and he said Bel Lord behold I am healer and the Lord said to him arise and go in the street which is called straet and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of tus for behold he's doing what oh my God are we together amen are we together remember when your sins are forgiven follow me automatically your prayer channel is open amen are we together we found Paul automatically is praying and God saw Paul praying remember God doesn't heal Sinners but God already saw Paul praying in other word Paul has been forgiven [Applause] we going slowly my friend and because he has been forgiven automatically his prayer is going before God are we together verse uh 12 and has seen in a vision who gave Paul the vision God a man named ananas as coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight then an answered he's not really sure about the conversion of Paul are we together the church doesn't know yet that Paul already changed God is coming and talking to ananas you need to go find Paul andah say hey Lord I agree with what you're saying but let me remind you something maybe you don't know who you talking about I hope we getting somewhere I is my Bible different than yours no okay and then anas answered Lord I have heard by many of this man in other word he's informing God but God is telling him that I'm I saw him praying and he have have a vision in other words the connection of Paul is already established because Paul now is a chang man are you following me when God change you God automatically begin to hear your [Applause] [Music] prayer please let's travel slowly because I know what the devil is fighting with you is I have cases that didn't work I'm going to get to that let's clim slowly are we together and I'm going to show you that your case is it doesn't mean it didn't work exactly right amen I'm going to show you amen amen Paul was already changed God already put blood upon the altar of Paul are we together but the church doesn't know it yet amen amen he say Lord I have heard by many of this man how much evil he has done to your Saints at Jerusalem and he here he has Authority from the chief priest to mind all that call on your name I don't know how they learn that amen amen so ananas is telling God father I understand I don't want to disobey you but kindly remember H the one you sending me is a criminal okay you know many stuff that he have done that is wrong ananas didn't realize that Paul was a changement he didn't realize that the blood was put on Paul and the blood was put on the altar of incense of Paul are we together amen are we together amen now God is going to help his servant verse 15 but the Lord say to him I am aware that he was a bad man I'm asking you no no the Lord say unto him ananas I know the bad things that Paul have done are we together it looks like God cannot even mention the bad things that Paul done I'm going slowly that's why brother Bram say God is the only one that forgive and forget am but the people will always remember what you did am Amen in other word ananas is sending a message he's pulling from the database of God to show God that there is something wrong with Paul but when God check his database there is nothing against Paul amen amen are we together this one say he's a bad man God say don't worry let's hear what God is talking about Paul if God is going to say uhhuh I know exactly what he did verse 15 but but means a contradiction my friend in other word God is going to tell him something contrary to everything that he saying but the Lord said to him go your way in other way hey heyy go your way for he is a what do you see anything negative about Paul there why the blood has been applied on Paul are we together he is a what to me to Bear my name yes yes sir before the Gentile uhhuh and Kings uhuh and the children of Israel for I will show him how great thing he must suffer for my name sake that's all God have to say about PA God didn't mention anything that Paul did in the past because everything Paul did in the past was in the sea of God's unfor forgetfulness God already wiped the sin of power and he put the blood upon the altar now that the servant Now understand who Paul is watch the next verse verse 17 and ananas went his way and enter into the house and putting his hand on him he say s The Sinner can you read the Bible with me what did an say he begin to call Paul who brother why is he calling him brother why is he calling him Brother s because he understood that Paul is already converted he's no longer the old Paul the old Paul has been wiped out are we together yes sir he say brother Saul the Lord even Jesus in other word the one you met over there that appeared to you in the way as you came he send me that you may receive your sight and what who preached to Paul repentance who preached to him repentance let me continue Verse 18 and immediately death fell from his eyes as he has been scared and he received sight forth with and he rose and was whated who taught him to be baptized are we together what I'm trying to point out here is when your sins are forgiven when there is a change in heart because God is looking at your heart not your mouth that's the reason why a lot of people come and they alter they go back they don't change by mouth they are confessing but their heart is not with God God so the heart of Paul when God approved Paul automatically God opened the connection are we together now let's go back to Luke 15 and watch the young men the prodal son we talking about a prayer if you there let's go to verse uh 17 we there and when he came to what his so the one that was doing the bad thing was it the boy or this boy because there is two boys amen the Bible say he came to himself let me start this way my friend the boy was a amen then for some reason he flipped he became B amen am then the Bible say he came to himself are we together he came back to a are we together so the boy changed are we together the boy changed he moved from B to a because B was taking him further away from his father even when the condition were bad he went and joined to the citizen of the country be will continue to get you away from God but a will bring you back to God verse six will always bring you back to God but verse seven is the one that's going to take you away from God we have a white dog and a black dog are we together the Bible say he came to himself in other word the one that was doing everything wrong was not him that's correct amen are we together watch when he came to himself the Bible says how many hired servant of my father have bread enough and to spare and I perish with what hunger who taught him this do you see any preacher here no brother Bram say he was the angel of the Lord amen the same one that met Paul now Verse 18 I will arise and go to my father who cast our Devils my friend I'm going slowly should you catch up something usually you struggling with a demon they have to cast a devil but him when he came to himself all the Devil Went Away nobody cast that devil when he came to himself every devil that was connected to him felt an electrical shot and they all off and nothing could block the B to remain in that country anymore he didn't have any preacher just coming back to himself coming back to what he was before he left the father home coming back to his true identity to what you were before you come in this world when you come back to that one you don't fight Devils let me the Bible says I will arise and go to my father and will say to him father I have sin before heaven and before you who taught him repentance I'm asking you a question who taught him repentance and I am no more worthy to be called your son make me as one of your hired servant who what gave this boy an assurance that what he would tell the Father the father will agree that's right are we together because he's speaking with certainty he's speaking with faith he doesn't say I'm going to go to my father I'm trying to help you in your prayer I'm going to go to my father then I will tell him and I will see how daddy will react the boy is not going there the boy is going one way in other word he's not going to come back again he already burned the bridges behind I am going one time and I know when I get to the father I will get what I want I don't know if you understanding me are we together the boy does have no for an answer amen are we together the boy knows for sure that I'm not going to anyone I'm not going to the judge but but I'm going to my father it's important to know who you going to are we together amen I'm not going to anyone I'm going to my father and I'm going to tell my father I have sin against you and against heaven and here is my petition I want you to make me as one of your servant amen who Tau him that his father can hear a sinner are we together are we together what gave him the confidence that when he get there his prayer will be answered that's whatever happened to him that came that changed him to come back to himself already opened the door for the prayer I don't know if you're understanding me that's why when his father saw him he didn't wait for him to repent amen his father went and and welcome him because his sin was already gone amen I know these are different language my friend let's go with brother branam in the message the Revelation uh chapter 4 1961 paragraph 18 180 brother Bram Say by faith we are walking how Grace what God did for you that is right you believe God you believe on God and as soon as you are sorry you you are already forgiven amen am am now let's go slowly what does the prophet say as soon as you are sorry not you ask forgiveness I'm I'm reading brother Bram as soon as you are sorry the Bible say Godly sorrow do it bring repentance amen as soon as you are sorry brother br say you already forgiven amen as soon as Paul was sorry amen Paul was already forgiven amen as soon as this young man was sorry himself far away before he even talked to the father everything was already gone amen let's go my friend brother Bram say as I was speaking to a brother yesterday kind of got a little mix up on it and I said look brother if you say something to hurt your wife feelings I don't know who did that this morning amen if you did something to hurt your wife feeling immedate immediately you feel sorry for her you are sorry you did it you are already repented in your heart that's it amen thank you and brother brandham say that is right mhm but you got to go tell her about it amen are we together even though the prodal son already repented there he must go and tell the father I hope we are going together are we together but he's already forgiven amen amen that's why Daddy doesn't even listen to what he's saying Daddy's turning around and begin to give him stuff the Bible brother Bram say that's right but you got to go tell her AB abouted you got to go and say honey call her honeyone I am sorry I say that then you have what thoroughly repented thoroughly repented now that is the way it is with who God brother pram he say a man that will go and say I hurt her feeling don't make any difference I tell her I'm sorry but I really am not you are a hypocrite amen hypocrite amen are we together that's right that will be that would never be received by God you got to you got to toally be what sorry for your sins then when you know that you are sorry for your sin sin and then do what repentance and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin and you shall receive the Forgiveness receive the what Holy Ghost see just simple God has made it how so simple so before your mouth speak your heart need to be changed amen the main thing is first your heart amen if your heart is not changed God won't heal your prayer amen God heal your prayer based on your heart when your heart is Thoroughly repented then automatically the blood goes upon your altar are we clear together the Bible says in the book of Hebrew 10 and there sins and iniquity will I remember no more no more now where remissions of dis is there is no more offering for what sin ah then there is more no more sin no more iniquity so what happened to you having therefore after you already forgiven having therefore Breen what boldness to enter where the whole by the blood of who Jesus because once you are forgiven automatically the altar of Ence is brought into the presence of God now you have boldness to go before God am what I'm trying to build right here is if you already a Christian there should not be a hindrance to your prayer [Applause] amen are we together when you are a Christian when you approaching God the problem is we are approaching god without faith but Faith cometh by the word of God so I must preach to you something that you must receive first so that when you go pray from today you don't pray like you were praying before because before we are praying by routine we praying the mama taught me how to pray the way God the way the pastor was praying but you not praying by Revelation what am I trying to say brother Greg is right there amen if I say I need uh I need uh a drink and brother Greg have the drink yeah if I'm uncertain I will say okay I will go talk to brother Greg about the drink amen your are certainty will be proven by the way you even talk to brother Greg because when you go to brother Greg you will say brother Greg God bless you are you brother Greg yes brother Greg and before you even speak what you want to speak you will see you begin to take 74 you get on 85 you get on 485 brother Greg how was the day today are you doing okay ah it has been nice I heard that you a good brother ah Brother G do you know it's too hot today do you see how long you taking because you think by multiplying words your prayer will be [Applause] answered I'm going with you slowly so we built this are we together are we together but if you know what who brother Greg is and you have a relationship like brother Steven and brother Greg are when I'm coming to brother Greg I won't go left and right I'm coming with boldness with confidence I said brother Greg can I get a drink because I already know there is a drink there and the way I'm talking brother Greg knows that brother Steven are know him it's about [Applause] relationship are we together are we together that's why Jesus said when you pray say our father don't go just like that no no no remember first that you going to the father am just the way you talking to your father Jesus say if your father knows how to give good gift how about your heavenly father so when you pray push the break cool down say who am I going to talk to because the Bible say the one who comes to God must believe that he is and he is the rewarder I don't know if we're together you must believe that God is a rewarder if you don't believe he's a rewarder you won't get nothing you must believe that as I'm going I'm going to receive if you don't believe that don't pray go to sleep you wasting your [Applause] time are we together are we together are we together even the prayer line brother Bram say you don't have faith don't waste your time here amen don't waste your time here amen when you approach them man you got to know what you're doing but the problem is we have not been trained how to pray amen we are praying by routine we know that if something happen what we need to do is pray and the way we pray shows even what we believe Lord help s and so and so amen you're not really knowing what you doing amen and you are expecting maybe when you say that you expecting they're going to give her medication then she's going to feel good and tomorrow we will have a testimony you already have that in your mind amen and I bet you you don't even expect a miracle amen you are praying so that I know down the road she will get better but you don't go like when I pray something will happen are we together are we together because when Jesus pray he said father I know I know that you always hear me so Jesus have a confidence I'm going to get you that my friend are we together are we together amen are we together so we are entering the holiest not just like that amen you don't enter the holiest trembling no you enter the holiest with boldness amen amen with what the blood of Jesus Christ are we together are we together why the blood brother brandham told us he say so will your prayer go where straight to its destination will it take 485 no will it take 77 no your prayer are going where straight so why do you waste time amen why do you waste time because we learned that from Pentecostal that when you scream aloud oh holy God oh hallelujah oh hallelujah it's like you pushing you pushing prayer you pushing prayer you pushing prayer with your own hand prayer move prayer move prayer you don't move prayer like that prayer is moved by faith amen are we together he say so will your prayer go where straight to its destination because it's offer in the what the blood of Jesus Christ so your faith is not on you your faith is not on your vocabulary your faith is in the blood I don't know if we are together I don't know if we are together yes I'm not approaching God because I know who I I'm approaching God because I'm coming according to his formula are we together I'm having faith in the blood BL if I don't have blood then I can Blu but if I put blood I must have confidence on what I'm doing brother Bram say because it offer in the blood of who Jesus Christ which does what cleanses you the same blood that cleans you is the same blood that goes upon the altar are we together because it's the same blood that open up prayer that is no there is not a sin or a spot on you where nowhere why because of the blood that's right they can be as long as that Clorox which is the blood is between me and what how is he going to see sin because God if you are sinner he won't answer you but if you come under the blood then just to remember in your mind that God doesn't see me a sinner he will change your way of talking am don't worry my friend we found out in Revelation 5 that the blood the that's the prayer of the sent were the incense and according to Revelation 8 after the opening of the seventh seal they took an incense which is the blood and mix it with our prayer so incense and incense mix together and we find that brother according to Malachi 1 the bible say that from the from the rising of the sun even un the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Jew among the who the Gentiles and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name this is a I mean a promise to the Gentile and a pure offering for my name shall be great among the heathen say the Lord of host and Paul say I will therefore that men pray where everywhere lifting up holy hand without WRA and what doubting because if you doubt you're not going to receive anything why are you taking as said brother Bram says this that the incense was the order order Who stuff that they burn with the Bible uh which the Bible said that there was the prayer of the s if there is no sacrifice on the altar then the prayer cannot be received it's only by the blood on the sacrificial Al altar that that let the prayer go through who God so if we are under the blood of Jesus Christ what shows us that our prayer is not going through and why is our prayer not going to amen the Bible says this according to Hebrew when we look at this we find that the blood of Jesus Christ speaks because there is a voice in the blood there is a life in the blood and he speaks first brother Bram say he speaks about Redemption because the blood have to redeem you first I'm just going quickly just a quick review on this then brother Bram say it's not only Redemption he say in the New Testament he speak of redemption the blood must be upon the veil in the New Testament it speak of resurrection and life he speak of what he speaks of what Joy he speak of what power he speaks of what life he speaks of what heav in other word everything that you have need of is already in that life in the blood of the Lamb so when we coule our prayer with the blood we are sending two voices it is your voice mix with the voice of Christ are we together brother Bram say the blood of Christ cover all our sin uh-huh and speak peace and resurrection and power and life and healing and all the Redemptive blessing that the blood was shed for he does what speaks for us so when we take the blood and you put it with your prayer automatically the blood will begin to compensate where you are me where you are lacking are we together are we together yes sir and then brother Bram say when when we pray we must have a token to present with our what our pray in other word you must have the incense to Cle with your prayer amen now don't fail to get that when you pray you must you must have what the token to hold off a what the prayer if you are not keeping keep praying until the token because you are not promised to receive it see you got to have the token first that's the paying price your faith to believe it when you approaching God you must believe that he is are we together glory to God Paul in Ephesians 5 6 says praying always with all prayer and what simplification how spirit in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all the what so you pray with your supplication in the spirit which is the life that is in the blood why because we found out that in Roman 8 likewise the spirit also does what he help our infirmities for we know not what we should pray as we ought but the spirit itself does what for us with growning that cannot be what there is a secret language in the blood of Jesus Christ that will correct your prayer and make your prayer go through amen the spirit does something number one the spirit is helping us amen by making intercession are we together the spirit is correcting amen Cor correcting our error follow me my friend and the Bible say but he say because we don't know what we ought to pray but the spirit itself is making intercession for us with groaning which cannot be other verse 27 and he that searcheth the heart remember not the head the heart knows what is the mind of the spirit because he make intercession for the sent how of according to the will of God so the spirit help you but it doesn't help you just like that the spirit uses the will of God amen amen to help you in other words the life that is in the blood is correcting your prayer according to the will of God the spirit is your lawyer because sometime you don't know the law very well you don't know the will of God very well but the lawyer knows which article to put in your case to make the judge accept your case so the spirit of the Lord knows what will of God should be CLE with your [Applause] [Music] [Applause] prayer if I tell my wife I say whenever you hungry go to a restaurant and eat and send me a bill yes and I told her that if she doesn't go to a restaurant it's no more my problem it is I told her whenever you hungry go whenever you hungry go to a restaurant eat and send me the bill I pay for it and guess what sometimes she doesn't even go she stay home she say I'm hungry I said do you remember what I told you I said whenever you are you hungry go to any restaurant eat just send me the bill amen amen if you come and you are asking me food amen you will say brother Steven I'm hungry would you please help me amen but if you go through my wife amen and you deposit your stuff at my wife my wife will come with with it in a different angle he said you remember you told me that whenever I'm hungry I can go to a restaurant so me and sister are going going somewhere in a restaurant now sister is riding under my wife and getting what she want CLE your prayer with the spirit because the spirit knows the will of God and when you CLE with the will of God the spirit of the Lord knows how to bring your [Applause] prayer have I lost you if I lost you let me know have I lost anyone I'm using the example of my wife to make a point are we together are we together because my wife knows something you don't know and my wife can use her card and pocket and you go so when the Holy Ghost enter our prayer the Holy Ghost knows things you don't know and the Holy Ghost will take your prayer and push your prayer so that your prayer must be granted amen amen are we together are we together have I lost somebody have I lost someone Chief we okay praise God Chief say we good so we good so the spirit help us our prayer and answer how do you pray and get answer are we together yes sir the spirit is helping us he's helping us not just like that according to the will of God that's it amen when you say will of God brother Steven what is going on because according to the scripture Whatever Whenever Jesus pray it happened are we together so when Jesus is going to God Jesus say father I know that you always not I know that you hear me I know that you what always hearing me in other word he's pulling a token he's telling God already you know yes you know my Covenant with you so when I come you know I can't leave here without the solution okay ah now I'm praying for those now that was Jesus yes sir what is the promise for me and you are we together what is our promises these are very simple according to 1 John 5:14 the Bible say and this is the what confidence Jesus has his confidence this confidence is for you this is the confidence that we have where that if we ask [Applause] anything follow me my friend I know you pray I know some of you are louder some of you are quieter but sometime we are praying without Revelation that's let's grab the Revelation and then we go back to praying again are we together are we together before Jesus pray he say father I always know I know that you always hear me are we together in other word I'm not wasting my time here I'm not making a show I know that if I come to you there is I cannot leave and go without any solution you need to have the same confidence because now we are in the third person of the Trinity not the Holy Spirit in Christ by the holy spirit in the church and Jesus already prayed that whatever happened to him and the father must happen to you when do you want that to happen you want to start [Applause] today are we together are we together if I tell you have a confidence you will probably not trust me because it's my word so God gave us the confidence so this confidence is not you it is the confidence God gave you to use for him so let's use it what is the confidence the Bible say and this is the confidence that we have where in him that if we ask certain things no anything please leave your prayer that were not answer in the past leave that follow this today forget your old prayer okay if we ask what anything according to what his will that's why the Holy Spirit when he interceding for you he's interceding according to what his will because there is a key when you use the will of God am I hope you getting what I'm saying he says if we ask anything according to what he does what is this positive or condition or what it is clear in other word when you come before God you must remember this verse you say father I have confidence that when I come in you to ask anything you will hear me if you don't believe that don't pray let me continue my friend he says and if we know this is Jesus talking that he hear us I don't know if you get that it's in red lady you must have confidence in him amen what is the confidence if I ask brother Greg anything brother Greg will hear me and if I know in other word if I have the certainty if I have the assurance that brother Greg will give it to me then whatsoever we

something they get num I know and they still give me and and everything else is falling on the ground leave that alone amen if you did wrong correct it and let's move forward amen remove condemnation and let's go forth amen what is the will of God that we talking about brother brandham say let me give you a touch here how do we pray this is not me this is the authorized mouth peace of God for this age how do we pray we pray how in Jesus name don't we we going to go slowly my friend it down yesen praying praying prayer in in Jesus name because this lesson are very important we are praying in what Jesus name don't we every prayer every amen Amen in Jesus name is in Jesus name or there is not any answer push the break my friend brother poop come my friend if you tired you tell me brother po come my friend I want you to pray normally the way you pray but I want you to pray with four four words and then finish your prayer in four words just use 1 2 3 4 say maybe the Lord do this for me and just the way you pray normal Don't Be Afraid we in church just forward don't go too far just four word maybe three words just say something to the Lord okay think that you're praying yourself to God go ahead my friend don't worry even if it's wrong don't worry let's go okay um Lord mhm help me please mhm in Jesus name amen thank you let's stop right there thank you very much so how did he pray Lord help me please in Jesus name amen whoever told you why you are saying in Jesus name whoever told you the reason why why don't you say Lord help me why do you have to say in Jesus name nobody told you that you only hear and heard and heard and you copy but you never understood why we have to say in Jesus name so we are praying in the air if I tell all of you pray you will say in Jesus name amen so why do we say in Jesus name because you got to understand why if you understand why you have to say in Jesus name then you are praying this if not you are praying just the way everybody's praying or the way the pastor or the way mom is praying or the way I always he preacher praying are we together okay brother brandham how do we pray we pray in Jesus name don't we every prayer is where oh there is not any answer where is brother Bram taking this yet in first John 5:14 we are told this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he hear us and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petition of that we desire of him that's what we just heard now we ask what is the will of God are we together there is only one way to know his will and that is by what the word of God so when you praying search what you want in the word I don't know if you understanding me that's why the when she was in trouble she went in the word the name won't be different but God is the same yesterday today and forever whatever he did for one he must do it for the other I don't know if we together when J is going she said wait a minute I'm a widow where are widows he found one he said I'm a widow there was a widow now he comes to God he said God in your word that's right there was a widow in trouble and you send him Elijah the prophet I am a widow I have a child in trouble where is Elijah the prophet she was praying according to the will of God according to the word of [Applause] God I don't know my friend I'm this is a teaching so you suak this and you know how to be effective amen amen I'm having a question with you what did impress God because she was crying what impressed God do you think God was looking at tars tars TS TS God heard something God look he say who thought this one had to touch like this she's not praying in the air she have confidence in the word and she's praying with the word amen when she's praying with the word god stop everything he was doing in heaven many preacher were praying that day many believer were praying that day but God stop everything and turned to the other one are we together are we together that's why BL B knew what to shoot he said Son of David yes knows why he's saying son of David because as son of David he will block Jesus Christ the SAR Phan say son of David not according to the word when he she say Lord ah then she have corrected then everything is corrected are we together God search Elijah where he he said where is he at the airplane he's going to where a meeting forget about that meeting trouble the W pull him down put him in the hotel close it so your prayer bringing the airplane down changing the weather bringing the prophet to a certain hotel and keeping the m to be male in a state he didn't think just to pull him to the [Applause] neighborhood why praying according to the will God so don't go to prayer empty brother Bram preach his first sermon about Samson and brother Bram begin to use emotion so many in the message because in the message when you preach emotion they say you're a good preacher when you begin to teach then they say oh no no no no no no he's always teaching teaching teaching people love emotion brother Bram went with emotion even bned almost himself like and two ladies begin to cry and say people are crying when I preach I did very good and when he finished they rebuke brother Bram they said that's the worst sermon say what have I done they say you use too much emotion but you didn't use the [Applause] word when you praying use the word [Applause] Hallelujah I bought food for the kids I gave them food in a car they ate and some of them put a little bit of food on the floor I said you know what when I buy food don't eat in the car we get home are we together they all heard going with my body and Isaac coming from the barber shop I was so hungry a whole day running and on and catching up here and I said no no no no we need to buy food I bought food according to the law nobody eat food in the car do you follow me my stomach was rambling so bad do you know what I did do you know what I did I pick up a French five I put it in my mouth I pick up the second five I put it in my mouth I heard the voice is coming there it is not the size of the dog in the fight it is the size of the [Applause] fight do you know what I hear do you know what I heard he said Daddy our ourn not supposed to eat in the car do you know what happened to my hand the french fries was going down because I remember my word I have to when he spoke is's coming with power and authority because he's confident of what I say are we together he didn't say Dy will get mad no it's your word it is your law you breaking your law you say and that's why you that's how you talk to God you say you [Applause] we are good on time my friend how do we pray how do we pray not empty word amen amen that's why I say read your Bible every day listen to the message so you will know the will of God and you can use the will of God again against his own will you say you say hallelujah I'm not venturing I'm coming knowing you say are we together are we together oh glory to God listen to this my friend we talking about praying where in the name Amen brother po pray he say in the name we all do that it is very good congratulation for doing that but why do you do it who Tau you to do that amen if you don't understand the meaning of what you're doing you won't have a confidence why do we do that in John 14 this is Jesus himself talking he said whatsoever ye shall ask in my name I don't know if you're okay that our that what I I will do so from today when you are saying in Jesus name don't just say in Jesus name I'm saying in Jesus name because Jesus told me that whatever I ask the father in my name I will do it amen that will I do that the father may be what glorified in the son if you shall ask a anything thing uh-huh how in my name I will do it so today why do we say in the name of Jesus Christ amen cuz he will do it because we got a promise amen who gave the formula it's him Jesus so if I come and I'm using your name the way you taught me to use your name why am I going to get why why am I not getting an answer so to begin with before I pray I'm coming in the name before I even pray I'm coming in the name I am not praying like me I am praying in the name remember Jacob and Esau you remember Esau was the firstborn he was the one with the beight but the beight was taken from Esau and give to Jacob are we together amen are we together but the one who have to receive the blessing still remain so but the birth right has been transferred are we together are we together because our first begotten of the father is Jesus Christ but he became sinner that we may become the righteousness of God so the righteousness of Christ was given to us yes but when we coming we using his name we coming under the name of Esau let me rephrase it again my friend somebody didn't get it the birthright was already transferred the birthright was no longer under Esau he was under Jacob that's right amen but Jacob is still Jacob yes sir Esau is still Esau but the birth right is already transferred are we together so in order to receive the blessing you must come under the name of Esau that's right that's right sir that's right are we together in order to receive the blessing you don't come under the name of Jacob even if you are I don't know if we together please put your seat belt let's recalibrate this again the first born is Esau he lost his Birthright and the birth right went to the Jacob but Jacob even though he hold the birth right he can't come and tell his father father I have the be right I am Jacob they're not going to give him nothing you have the be right but you still have to come in the [Applause] name I don't know if we together Jesus became sinner he represented you at the cross so that you become the righteousness of God so when you are approaching God you still have to use the [Music] [Applause] name are we together are we together are we together because the father will ask you who are you don't say I'm Jacob say I am Jesus amen [Applause] Have I Lost You Have I Lost You Have I Lost You the father when he has you say I'm Jesus you say wait a minute wait a minute your voice is Charles Hamilton let me feel you let me feel you when he feels you he's feeling the blood he look at the blood he said this is BL amen then God begin to pour the blessing then he said blessed you are you son are we together are we together are we together amen that's why Jesus said whatever you ask the father in my name don't go yourself go with my name amen when you talk you talk you talk tell the father in Jesus name in Jesus name in other word everything I have spoken in Jesus name in other word it's Jesus who say [Applause] that have I lost somebody listen my friend he says and in that day because Jesus thought the disciple I must go and I'm going to send you the Holy Spirit the third person of the trinity in other word God will no longer be among us God will be in you and Jesus say in that day that God now is in you in that day you shall ask me what you need to understand what he say mean there in other word in that day Jesus won't be available on the flesh the disciple won't go again and say master master HH in that day you don't need to look for a physical Jesus that's what he's saying here he said in that day you shall ask me what verily verily I say unto you whatsoever ye ask the father how in my name he will do what give it to you do we have a doubt there nope he too have ye asked nothing in my name you have not done it yet ask and he shall receive that your joy may be helpful God want to be joyful uh-huh but your joy must go to a fullness amen so when you talk to him you say I'm not happy I'm not happy with the situation I'm going through you promise that if I ask you anything you will give me joy and my joy must be full I don't know if we together I don't know if we are together amen Hallelujah father help me up brother Bram say in the second coming let's listen to the prayer of brother Bram our kind loving father we come to thee today in that all sufficient sufficient name of the Lord Jesus knowing this this is Brother Bram that he has promised do you see how brother is praying that whatsoever you ask the father how that will are do and we come presenting him I don't know if you get what I'm saying we are presenting Esau Esau we are presenting teachers how to pray message believer you need to know how to pray we came up with all kind St people going into the mountain and going to sleep in the mountain wearing all kind of stuff in the you're going to be eaten by a [Applause] bear I'm going to show you what the prophet say amen God is not far away God is within you [Applause] amen oh you know what I'm going to take four

place him before us you understand as we go to the hear us Lord as we speak Jesus am I don't know if you hear as we speaking so when you open Jesus who is inside Jesus who is me who is beside Jesus when you open Adam who is beside iside Adam you have a problem are we together have I lost someone listen to brother BR my friend he says Jesus said whatsoever you ask the father how in my name that will I do did you ever realize what that means I'm reading brother Bram what does he mean do you realize if we go before God In The Name of Jesus it is just the same amen please let's start again let's start again I wish I was sitting there and somebody's preaching this I will be the one hollering amen because God is opening my eyes to the things I didn't [Applause] know do you realize if we go before God how in the of Jesus in Jesus name it is just the as Jesus himself [Music] praying it is not me praying anymore if I come in his name and he recognize what his name Jesus say whatever you ask the father how that I do and then if I go to the father in Jesus name it is not me what praying anymore anymore it is who it is his spirit praying through [Music] [Applause] me let's pray push the break we need to know how we trying to pray let's pray he hey Slow Down slow down now I need to know who ah ah now I understand father I come in the name of Jesus Christ when you say that all the doors begin to open all the smoke begin to clear Hallelujah and Jesus prayer is always that's so my prayer must be answer because I come in his name I come under the blood are we together I still have minute my friend are we together amen pray and answer pray and answer h brother Steven brother Steven me I don't know how to pray brother Steven I am new to the message I have read only five ties I heard only five tips I read only 10 books but I'm making any effort so how do I know the will of God to pray glory to God brother Bram say in the message the having a shadow like the little boy down on his knee saying what his ABC and the pastor came by H and say what are you doing Sonny he say I had the good Praying Mother I know she praying I am am an orphan and I didn't know how to pray I just say all the ABCs the what alphab and maybe God will put them together and know what I'm PR praying for [Applause] amen are we together the boy didn't know what to do he said a b c d but his heart he has desire so God is using the desire and making prayer with the [Applause] [Music] alphabet are we together are we together amen young children are we together he says and certainly we depend on what him to do what put it together that is the prayer of sincerity certainly he could not put them together it is not how we pray right in our lips it is the mo of our [Applause] [Music] heart spoken word spoken word spoken word this message came to correct us it is not how we pray in what our Liv because Pharisee prays more than you yeah yeah and they love to play in the public places lifting up [Music] hands so your prayer need to be different than the Pharisees because Jesus said these people honor me with their lips but the heart is not there brother Bram say it is not how we pray in what our lips it is the motive of our heart is what God he he sometime don't hear our lips he heal our intentions what the motive of our hearts father give me this what is in the heart amen what are you trying to show off who you trying to show off on WhatsApp on Facebook that you a big shot no remove the wrong motive bring a clean in the name of Jesus Christ with the name of Jesus Christ then you are sure your prayer will be granted because of the intention is [Applause] right I want to get married because you taught us that man in the beginning was created male and female and your Prophet told us there is a thirst for love and I feel that in my heart yes but I don't want to S father the pastor taugh us this is the way to get pray father I don't know how to search for husband I don't even know how to pick the right one but you know the heart would you please come and enter into this thing this is how you pray and the right husband will come but if you must pray according to the will of God that boy is not in the message leave him alone it is not the will of God not the will of God Amen [Applause] here is a young man he's a message believer my intent is to be to have a true head somebody who be a father to me a father to my children who will bring me more closer to God who will bring me more closer to the Lord when you begin to present that it is no longer about just being married it's not just being marri not not now with refocusing amen hallelujah because James 4 say ye ask and you receive not ah because he ask how am miss that he may consume it upon your what Your L that's why some of your prayer didn't [Applause] work amen you are trying to consume it with a last [Music] yes does God answer that prayer yes God answer it but he answer it with a [Applause] no every prayer you pray is answer but the answer might be yes or no because God doesn't want to lose you with [Applause] foolishness you are you a young man unconverted a young sister unconverted rebellious stubborn and you go to God you say give me a Cadillac 2025 when God look he say of course I can give it to you you came in Jesus name the intention is wrong daughter if I give it to you son if I give it to you I'll lose you yeah I'm going to answer your prayer but my answer is no so God always answer your prayer God always answer your prayer but the answer is either yes oh Hallelujah does God answer your prayer God always answer you oh Father I ask him for something sometime he shake his head and say what no I just Rejoice that's right spoken word this is not joke this is not Elementary you need to grow up now in the Lord I ask him something and he shake his head he says what yes I just Rejoice so much that as I can if he say yes because we always ought to ask how will be done his knows if that is his will it's a whole lot better than his what yes if it is the will of God to do it that is when you really love him [Applause] amen God answered you but he didn't want to give it to you that time because you're not prepared for it because you going to you want you want to consume that in your last amen amen then he says no but no doesn't mean he won't give it to you no because at this time his will is different are we together or what he has is different than what you planning he might have for you and another husband but not the one you are pleading not the one you working for not the one you pushing to Heaven maybe that's not your husband so God is saying no and you get discouraged don't get discouraged be happy because later on you find out he was a rasar so the nose of God was better for you [Applause] my God I know people who went to relationship he didn't work out today they married go ask them do you want to go back to the first one you will hear oh never never never brother that one oh thank you Jesus but at that time they were crying God you don't love me God you don't love me every relationship is not working because it's not yours amen it's not yours so the answer must be no God is protecting you Lord give me a job in Bank of America God wants you to be in a in chase God say no don't get discouraged ask him and say you say no so you must have something better for me would you tell me what is better for me show me the other company so the nose of God is an opportunity for you to ask him and say oh Father maybe I don't know why you don't want me to go this way so if this is not the way would you not show me which way I should go because I want to be in your will spoken word and no I'm not going to sing I'm not going to be be a be a be a technician again I'm not going to preach again I'm not going to church this time the Deon call you look at the phone go God say [Applause] no what about if God open up and say look a criminal he will beat you he will leave the message okay come and get it now you will be the first because I you the thoughts are have for you say the Lord I thought of peace my thought are not your thought my ways are not your ways I have a good plan for [Applause] you tell the devil he always answer me when he says no devil do you know what he means he just saw the Trap you were trying to put me [Applause] in what does the nose of God means the nose of God means I'm going this way take make it right that's what no means that's all it means you look over there there was an accident there that's what no means because the Bible say he would not withhold anything good to his believer if he he withhold him there is a purpose okay let me wind up to the airport my friend amen that's God answer prayer does God answer prayer yes please give me few minute put a seat belt let's landar This Plane brother Bram say now the thing is with the people is the way God Appears many times we want to make a nle out of God there it is brother we ask him to do something and then he must do it just the way that we ask it all we shall say he never answered if you tired we stop here and we pick up next time H because you got to get this material amen you are saying God didn't answer you because it didn't come the way you were expecting to according to you it's tomorrow K $10,000 God answer if $110,000 didn't come that way no but you will miss the raising of salary amen he's raising $5 to you it's I need 10,000 he say if I give it to him he's going to burn it just raise the salary L he will adjust his bill am $5 an hour multiply by the time you work you will see $10,000 came but in a different route are we together amen are we together when we do that we weaken our faith exactly right this year this year this year this year this year this year God say look at your heart look at your heart daughter this year you and your mother bming heads every day if I get you in the hand of a young man he will suffer T you down a little bit the husband is coming he says I don't know who he therefore and he weak and and we weaken our testimonies when we do not take him at his word God always answers I just ask I just ask you that question always answers no one never ask Jesus say ask and you shall receive seek and you shall find everyone that ask will receive everyone that seek shall find everyone that knock it shall be what open now that is the only way that I have always founded that I can get anything from God is take him at his word the will of God and believe it the way he send it the will of God now if we do not take him just the way that we think we built God as an Adam he's got to answer just according to our ways oh well it's not just no good he didn't answer us God answer in many ways he answer in part time and everything is what OD what are you trying to say Pastor from today when you pray sir open up your mind yes sir let God come whichever direction he want to come if he want to use a crow let him use a crow to bring you a sandwich don't question the crow amen don't ask the crow where did he get the sandwich that's not your problem you want food

as a wi transfer or he can come as a cash all that is [Applause] God my friend if I continue we get deeper let's stop right here amen let's stand let's stop right [Music] here because what comes there after this it tells you about the timing that God answer amen how do we pray how do we tell Jesus why do we use the name of Jesus every every time before you pray who are you approaching you must know who he is you must have confidence like I spoke the the the example of brother Greg you must know his will you must coule that with the spirit of the Lord so that why you don't know the spirit will intercede for you according to the will of God when you go to God remember he will always answer you if your heart is condemning you remove the condemnation and when condemnation is gone whatever we ask in his name we shall receive amen when we coming we don't come we coming in the name of Jesus Christ amen he's always on time he answer many ways when you pray open up your mind don't put him in
