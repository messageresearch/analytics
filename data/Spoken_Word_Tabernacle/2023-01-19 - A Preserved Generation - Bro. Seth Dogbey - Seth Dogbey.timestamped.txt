[40:06] message I believe he was on on Monday uh
[40:10] they had a
[40:12] an election in their church and now he's
[40:15] a pastor
[40:20] amen
[40:22] so brother Wayne you know some finally
[40:24] now he's a pastor amen he has been a
[40:27] tremendous help for the Bride of Jesus
[40:30] Christ I say praise the Lord amen but he
[40:33] was moving toward that direction for a
[40:36] while a long long long time until the
[40:39] Lord made his way and everything is good
[40:41] and I'm happy for him because he's a man
[40:43] who's solid in the word of God amen
[40:45] glory to God everybody on board since
[40:49] Sunday
[40:50] the Bible became more and more of a new
[40:53] book
[40:54] amen can we clear now
[40:57] so you continue to pray for me so we
[40:59] pick up again on Sunday and move forward
[41:01] scripture after scripture after
[41:03] scripture after scripture until you
[41:06] understand the deity of Jesus Christ now
[41:10] you begin to understand why Jesus is God
[41:13] it is now clear that Jesus was the word
[41:17] that was made flesh so when we say the
[41:20] Lord Jesus come you need to be specific
[41:23] if not we're going to have a cow
[41:26] eating grass somewhere where the cow is
[41:30] not supposed to be Amen brother Kalima
[41:33] sent me a quote when I put a coat where
[41:35] brother Branham said before the coming
[41:37] of the Lord I believe you saw the quote
[41:39] that California will go down
[41:42] was California down in 1963.
[41:47] you saw me highlighted on the group chat
[41:49] was California down
[41:51] so the Lord didn't come
[41:56] is it a problem
[41:58] there is a quote that people who believe
[42:01] that God the Lord Jesus Christ came on
[42:05] 1962 there is a court that they use it's
[42:08] a it's a popular quote among them but
[42:11] Lord's willing on Sunday I will pull
[42:13] that coat and me and you will read that
[42:16] quote and we'll figure it out what did
[42:18] Brother Branham say it I have ministers
[42:20] all the way from Ghana rejoicing this
[42:25] we we are giving them so much ammunition
[42:28] to be free from this kind of confusion
[42:31] in the message amen
[42:33] it's a minister he said brother Stephen
[42:35] who will have a minute I'll talk to the
[42:37] ministers meeting I mean all the
[42:39] minister there for the meeting to pull
[42:41] you out so you can come down here oh my
[42:43] God Amen I'm already loaded here amen so
[42:47] you keep praying for me I say Lord's
[42:49] willing but you keep me in prayer amen
[42:51] so keep me in prayer everything will be
[42:53] okay we pick up again and we go deeper
[42:55] it's going to stabilize you a lot in
[42:59] your walk in this message and then uh
[43:02] your shutter record everything will be
[43:05] okay the sisters meeting is maintained
[43:08] in just in case you heard something that
[43:10] we were trying to change the date no we
[43:12] did it the day to remained the 25th I
[43:15] was able to tweak a little bit and keep
[43:17] everything the way it is something
[43:19] slipped me up but by God's grace we work
[43:21] our way around so we keep it on the 25th
[43:24] but instead of 2 30 it will be at three
[43:28] o'clock you know the place I'm not gonna
[43:30] say it on YouTube we just meet up there
[43:33] amen I keep it secret it's the seventh
[43:36] seal
[43:37] it's open but it's not open to the
[43:39] public
[43:43] [Applause]
[43:46] when I give those kind of example it
[43:49] will help you catch up even the seventh
[43:51] seal itself
[43:52] that it's open but it's now open to the
[43:55] public so somebody really know what the
[43:57] seven seal is and there is a group that
[43:59] doesn't know amen glory to God I receive
[44:03] couple questions
[44:05] because we have question and answer this
[44:07] Saturday at 2 30 and they will be here
[44:10] in the church amen so remember 230
[44:13] question and answer there are a couple
[44:15] people that put question on the prayer
[44:17] request so it's hard for me to make up
[44:21] the question so if you're streaming
[44:23] tonight or if you hear or you're going
[44:25] to listen later if you can text me
[44:28] directly because there is no name again
[44:30] so it's hard for me to reach out to you
[44:33] directly and know what you what you're
[44:36] trying to ask so the first question is
[44:38] about it's a question on marriage and
[44:40] divorce
[44:42] which is a hard one but it's put on the
[44:45] prayer request
[44:46] so if you put this question on the
[44:49] prayer request please you need to
[44:51] contact me this is pretty deep and I
[44:54] want to know which angle you're coming
[44:55] from and what are you looking at so I
[44:58] know what is going on because it's a
[45:00] hard question I don't even want to read
[45:03] it
[45:04] but you know you who wrote the question
[45:06] about marriage and divorce if I read it
[45:07] you will start thinking twice and being
[45:10] puzzled amen so talk to me so I know
[45:13] what is your question what you're asking
[45:15] where you're coming from so I know how
[45:17] to answer it if not it's going to be
[45:19] hard for me to make up the question the
[45:21] second one is in the glossy prayer
[45:24] request again so somebody wrote on it
[45:27] and some of the writing didn't come up
[45:29] because it's on the glossy paper one of
[45:32] the question was when did The Mating of
[45:34] sibling end so if you wrote that
[45:37] question whatever the remaining is I
[45:39] don't know
[45:40] so write me that it's just a question
[45:45] okay so send me a text I won't call your
[45:48] name just send me a text you say buddy
[45:51] Steven I am the one who asked the
[45:52] question and this is the question and
[45:55] just give me the full question then I
[45:58] know how to answer it there is a
[46:00] Biblical answer to this okay so no
[46:04] problem I don't mind you I asking
[46:06] questions versus you staying with your
[46:07] question and get puzzle and get on the
[46:10] internet and go get off foolishness amen
[46:13] so there are questions on the front and
[46:15] question on the back and it's written in
[46:17] two weeks so I can make it up so if you
[46:20] did it do it in other words the message
[46:22] is we got paper there use the paper that
[46:25] are there write your question there and
[46:29] put your name there so when I have a
[46:31] question I will directly contact you and
[46:34] I know who wrote it everybody clear
[46:38] everybody clear
[46:41] amen glory to God Amen keep me in prayer
[46:47] and just be a little be patient I will
[46:49] tell you when we will have our normal
[46:52] voting for the officer of the church I'm
[46:54] going through a lot of meeting because I
[46:57] need to set things in uh
[46:59] we restructure a lot of things in a
[47:01] different order the Lord is already
[47:03] pleased with the order that we get up
[47:06] here but I want to really set it up
[47:08] pretty tight so when we know we know
[47:10] which direction we're moving and no more
[47:13] guessing of things like that because the
[47:16] Lord doesn't tolerate that anymore so
[47:18] I'm going through one meeting to another
[47:19] to one meeting to another just trying to
[47:22] put things together so you keep me in
[47:23] prayer and you will be updated and from
[47:26] there we go to the voting and loads
[47:28] willing probably toward the end of the
[47:30] month you get the receipt for your taxes
[47:33] and everything I believe it's pretty
[47:35] much set we just need the premiere

[47:40] everything and give it to you amen so be
[47:42] patient with me I am not the one

[48:31] saying he was matching completely what I
[48:33] was doing
[48:34] because when I'm when I'm working on
[48:36] your sermon on the sermon brother
[48:38] Branham is completely playing whichever
[48:40] messages and I can tell you like 90 of
[48:43] the time what comes on the tip it's also
[48:45] right there that's when I know the
[48:47] direction and if something comes up
[48:49] there and say don't do this
[48:51] to you it's don't do this to me it's but
[48:54] God is telling me move to a different
[48:56] direction so he moved it last night so I
[48:59] have to retrieve some quotes and remove
[49:01] it okay

[54:49] I don't know this sometimes the Lord put
[54:52] scripture on your heart and then he has
[54:54] to take you through something and then
[54:56] the scripture becomes living in your
[54:57] life it is no more a dead letter but a
[55:01] living life of the spirit in the word of
[55:03] God
[55:05] amen this morning I sent brother Stephen

[55:49] the Lord is the one who gave me the
[55:51] strength to come to stand here tonight
[55:54] amen of whom shall I be afraid he said
[55:58] when the wicked even my enemies and my
[56:01] thoughts Came Upon me to eat up my flesh
[56:05] they stumbled and fell
[56:09] though and hosts shouldn't come against
[56:11] me my heart shall not fear

[56:19] will I be confident
[56:23] and what will I be confident that the
[56:26] Lord is my life and my is the light it's
[56:29] my light and my salvation he is the
[56:32] strength of my life and this will I be
[56:35] confident amen it's a one thing have I
[56:39] desired of the Lord
[56:40] that will I seek after that I may dwell
[56:44] in the house of the Lord all the days of
[56:48] my life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[56:51] and to inquire in his Temple
[56:55] that is what I have desired in my heart
[56:58] to be in the house of the Lord to be in
[57:01] the temple to inquire in his in his
[57:04] Temple he said for in the time of
[57:07] trouble
[57:08] he shall hide me in his Pavilion
[57:11] in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he
[57:14] hide me
[57:16] he shall set me up upon the rock
[57:20] in the secret of his Tabernacle
[57:23] there's a secret place in the Tabernacle
[57:26] that he hides me there's no eyes can see
[57:30] me
[57:30] but Steven was talking about
[57:33] the the
[57:34] fourth
[57:36] stage right that has to do with
[57:39] rewarding when it gets to that rewarding
[57:42] eyes will not see you
[57:45] amen and and I was I was just
[57:49] sometimes you you you just think about
[57:51] when the prophet was preaching about uh
[57:53] my speech on this message the rapture
[57:57] he was written in psalm 27.
[58:00] so I was like okay so I'm 27 how is this
[58:04] connected to the rapture
[58:06] he's hiding me in that secret place
[58:09] there is a secret place that the eyes
[58:11] cannot see
[58:14] amen
[58:16] amen the Thunders in the word of God
[58:19] amen amen
[58:23] I said for in the time of trouble he
[58:25] shall hide me in his Pavilion in the
[58:28] secret of his shall he hide me he shall
[58:32] set me up upon a rock
[58:35] I said and now shall my head be lifted
[58:39] up you remember Psalm 24
[58:42] lift up your heads all you get
[58:46] amen and now so my head be lifted up
[58:51] above my enemies run about me therefore
[58:54] will I offer in his stabilical
[58:56] sacrifices of Joy I will sing yeah I
[59:01] will sing praises unto the Lord amen and
[59:05] amen
[59:06] amen
[59:08] I
[59:09] as I said
[59:11] the Lord just gave me strength two hours
[59:13] ago to come stand here
[59:15] I wasn't able to walk I wasn't I was
[59:18] just bed reading but
[59:21] um somewhere somehow the lawyers
[59:22] provided the strength just to come
[59:27] to say his word tonight so
[59:30] um we're gonna see what the Lord has for
[59:33] us tonight amen
[59:35] amen
[59:37] he
[59:39] amen
[59:43] we want to see how the Lord is going to
[59:44] take us tonight amen sometimes you have
[59:47] thoughts you have scriptures you have
[59:49] quotes
[59:51] um and you need a lot to line them up
[59:54] amen the Lord must present a message
[59:56] amen
[59:58] the message for tonight is a preserved
[1:00:01] generation
[1:00:03] a preserved generation
[1:00:06] amen
[1:00:08] amen now um
[1:00:11] in um when I was in um fifth grade in in
[1:00:16] Ghana we we do this uh the system we
[1:00:19] call it the primary school
[1:00:22] so uh fifth grade in Ghana
[1:00:25] um we went for a program
[1:00:28] and I was back then in the nomination
[1:00:31] and when I went for this program I
[1:00:35] a good um
[1:00:37] I I sought this um sisters this um young
[1:00:41] girls from a school in Ghana called
[1:00:44] Goshen
[1:00:46] and
[1:00:47] it's it's a school that that was
[1:00:50] established by a message believer is is
[1:00:53] actually a pastor
[1:00:55] so back then uh my first impression that
[1:00:58] I had about Goshen was
[1:01:00] is this peculiar people
[1:01:04] um you see the sisters the kind of
[1:01:06] peculiar
[1:01:08] to the ones that you already know the
[1:01:12] ones you've been exposed to
[1:01:14] the kind of people that looked
[1:01:16] preserved
[1:01:18] the kind of people that look classy the
[1:01:22] kind of people that looked
[1:01:25] I don't know what kind of words to use
[1:01:27] but you could see the glory of the Lord
[1:01:30] you could see the glow and that that
[1:01:33] impression I still have that impression
[1:01:37] to today
[1:01:38] amen so
[1:01:40] it's a way to encourage encourage our
[1:01:43] sisters sometimes you might you might
[1:01:47] you might think that okay things are so
[1:01:49] hard things are so difficult they they
[1:01:52] are I'm expected to do this I'm I'm
[1:01:54] expected to present myself in a certain
[1:01:57] way it is looking like rules and
[1:01:59] regulations but then the impression that
[1:02:03] you are creating out there
[1:02:05] amen it's it's a different kind of
[1:02:08] impression
[1:02:10] it's a classic they glow amen amen I
[1:02:14] still have that impression in my head so
[1:02:16] finally when I got into the message and
[1:02:19] then I heard about the school again then
[1:02:23] that
[1:02:24] open my understanding to why the school
[1:02:26] was called Goshen
[1:02:29] amen I believe we've heard about um
[1:02:32] Goshen in the Bible
[1:02:34] it was a place that the Lord preserved
[1:02:37] his people
[1:02:39] no matter the storms in Egypt whatever
[1:02:42] was going on in Egypt every plague no
[1:02:45] matter how the plagues came in there was
[1:02:47] a preserved place for the people of God
[1:02:51] amen and that's a it's our topic tonight
[1:02:54] A preserved generation
[1:02:57] let's go to John 15.
[1:03:02] I have a lot of codes to read but I want
[1:03:04] to take
[1:03:06] some of the scriptures before we get to
[1:03:08] the quotes and I I prayed
[1:03:12] the Lord give us Grace
[1:03:14] I want to read amen
[1:03:17] John chapter 15 verses 1 to 10.
[1:03:22] the Bible says I am the True Vine
[1:03:25] and my father is the husband man
[1:03:30] every branch in me that buried not fruit
[1:03:35] he take it away
[1:03:37] and every branch that buried fruit he
[1:03:41] perjured it that it may bring forth more
[1:03:45] fruit
[1:03:47] amen every Branch he said I am the True
[1:03:51] Vine
[1:03:53] so the prophet was saying that
[1:03:57] their Vine does not produce fruit
[1:04:00] it is the branch that produce the fruit
[1:04:03] so God needs us to be branches to
[1:04:06] produce fruits
[1:04:08] and they say now when you don't produce
[1:04:11] the fruit he's going to take you off
[1:04:14] but when you're producing the fruit he's
[1:04:16] going to praise you what is purging
[1:04:19] purging is a cleaning up
[1:04:23] amen he's he's taking certain things off
[1:04:27] you so that you produce more fruit
[1:04:30] so when there is something that is in
[1:04:32] your life that is blocking the Holy
[1:04:34] Spirit from producing the fruit he must
[1:04:37] take them off so that he can produce
[1:04:39] more fruit
[1:04:41] amen there are things in our lives amen
[1:04:44] when we got converted or when we gave
[1:04:47] our lives to Christ
[1:04:50] I believe it was not
[1:04:52] um
[1:04:54] you didn't you were not bearing all the
[1:04:56] fruit at the beginning there are certain
[1:04:58] things that were still lingering in your
[1:05:00] life but then Christ must come in and
[1:05:04] preach those things off
[1:05:06] amen so those those days when when you
[1:05:09] when you give your life to Christ there
[1:05:12] are still certain friends that you still
[1:05:13] hang around with a man I I just have a
[1:05:17] little confession tonight amen when I
[1:05:19] got into the message first
[1:05:21] um
[1:05:22] uh you know you still had the
[1:05:25] Presbyterian friends that that were
[1:05:27] still inviting youth for programs amen
[1:05:31] amen and then um
[1:05:34] you would go you go to these programs
[1:05:36] and then um
[1:05:38] they say oh it's been a long time I've
[1:05:40] not seen you um where have you been I'm
[1:05:43] just just around and and
[1:05:48] I've been around you know I've been
[1:05:50] around so
[1:05:52] it's okay we what child do you go to now
[1:05:55] is that go to spoken word
[1:05:57] smoking is this Spoken Word Ministries
[1:06:00] spoken I just go to spoken word amen at
[1:06:03] that time you were not well equipped
[1:06:06] amen you were not equipped enough to
[1:06:09] speak about the message
[1:06:11] amen you still have things in your life
[1:06:14] that the Lord must come to purge you
[1:06:18] amen so when your life is still like the
[1:06:22] beginning when when you are five years
[1:06:24] ten years and your life is still like
[1:06:25] that then it means there's no purging
[1:06:28] that is going on in your life
[1:06:30] Christ is not having enough room to
[1:06:33] operate in your life
[1:06:35] amen
[1:06:38] you come to church you are serving in
[1:06:40] church
[1:06:41] amen you give a little of your time in
[1:06:44] church
[1:06:45] Christ must urge you to serve more
[1:06:49] there must be a president
[1:06:52] amen maybe you sing specials once in a
[1:06:55] while once a year
[1:06:57] amen there must be a president amen yeah
[1:07:01] you move from once a year to five times
[1:07:03] a year to 10 times a year to every week
[1:07:08] that we know the Lord is bearing fruit
[1:07:11] because you are the branch that the Lord
[1:07:13] must bear fruit
[1:07:16] amen
[1:07:18] amen
[1:07:21] now verse three he said now ye are clean
[1:07:24] through the word
[1:07:26] which I have spoken unto you
[1:07:29] so the word of God comes to clean us up
[1:07:32] to purchase so that Christ can bear
[1:07:35] fruit amen he said abide in me
[1:07:39] am I in you as the branch cannot bear
[1:07:42] fruit of itself
[1:07:45] except it abide in the Vine
[1:07:48] no more can ye accept he abide in me
[1:07:52] so it means even though we are the
[1:07:55] branch that we have to bear the fruit we
[1:07:58] can bear the fruit of our own self but
[1:08:01] the vine must bear the fruit through us
[1:08:04] we must be connected to Christ each and
[1:08:08] every day of Our Lives to be able to
[1:08:10] bear this fruit
[1:08:12] amen so when I come here to sing special
[1:08:15] it is not me trying to show that I can
[1:08:18] sing but it is Christ
[1:08:20] amen that is singing and special
[1:08:23] amen when I stand yet to preach it is
[1:08:26] not brother trying to say something but
[1:08:28] it must be Christ that is speaking amen
[1:08:32] amen
[1:08:34] said I am Divine ye are the branches he
[1:08:37] that abided in me
[1:08:40] and I in him the same bringeth forth
[1:08:44] much fruit
[1:08:46] the word is much fruit
[1:08:48] you must be pushed to produce much fruit
[1:08:53] it's not just producing fruit but much
[1:08:56] fruit
[1:08:57] amen so we don't just spend um just a
[1:09:01] few hours you know uh just come to
[1:09:03] church on Sundays and that's it I mean
[1:09:06] when they actually do you go to church
[1:09:08] oh yeah I I do come to church amen and
[1:09:11] and your church going is on on Sundays
[1:09:13] amen when we are bearing much fruit this
[1:09:18] place will be filled up on Wednesday
[1:09:19] night
[1:09:21] amen because Bible says forsake not they
[1:09:24] are sampling of the Saints
[1:09:27] amen the prophet said you can miss work
[1:09:30] but you can miss coming to church you
[1:09:34] can miss it
[1:09:35] amen
[1:09:37] amen so we must bear much fruit
[1:09:41] for except for without me he can do
[1:09:44] nothing
[1:09:45] so bearing of much fruit we must be in
[1:09:48] that vine amen if a man abide not to me
[1:09:52] he is cast forth as a branch
[1:09:56] and it's Wizard and Men gathered them
[1:09:59] and cast them into the fire and they are
[1:10:03] burned
[1:10:04] they are burnt amen if he abide in me
[1:10:08] and my words are bite in you
[1:10:11] you shall ask what you will and it shall
[1:10:15] be done unto you
[1:10:17] if ye abide in me and my words in you
[1:10:21] you shall ask anything and it shall be
[1:10:24] done ask anything for what you are
[1:10:27] asking is a word of God that is in you
[1:10:29] that is asking so you are not going to
[1:10:31] ask and miss you are not going to pray
[1:10:33] and miss you are going to ask best on
[1:10:36] the word of God that is in you
[1:10:40] amen
[1:10:44] hearing is my father glorified ah
[1:10:49] hearing is my father glorified
[1:10:53] that ye bear much fruit
[1:10:56] so shall ye be my disciples
[1:11:00] as the father have loved me so have I
[1:11:04] loved you
[1:11:06] continue ye in my love
[1:11:09] the same love he said if you keep my
[1:11:12] Commandments he shall abide in my love
[1:11:16] even as I have kept my father's
[1:11:19] Commandments and abide in his love
[1:11:23] amen
[1:11:24] so keeping the word of God is so
[1:11:26] important
[1:11:27] in bearing much fruits
[1:11:30] and abiding in the Father's Love
[1:11:33] in order to show the glory of the father
[1:11:36] amen
[1:11:38] now I want to take this quote from the
[1:11:39] prophet I said um perseverance
[1:11:43] preacher 1962
[1:11:46] he said now see the Bible said
[1:11:50] Abraham started not at the promise of
[1:11:53] God through unbelief
[1:11:56] but was strong giving praise to God
[1:12:01] said now if we are in Christ
[1:12:04] we are Abraham's seat
[1:12:07] and I asked with him according to the
[1:12:10] promise
[1:12:11] is that right amen he said then how
[1:12:15] could the true Abraham's seat he see the
[1:12:18] promise of God here and then complain
[1:12:21] about having a tummy ache oh
[1:12:28] amen
[1:12:31] all your hand ain't straightening out
[1:12:33] right yet when God made the promise
[1:12:38] amen
[1:12:42] amen he said if you wait 50 years what
[1:12:46] difference does it make now I was
[1:12:48] listening to
[1:12:50] a message one time the prophet was
[1:12:51] talking about when God gives a promise
[1:12:56] the promise is leaving
[1:13:00] with him he's seen the promise from the
[1:13:04] beginning to the end he's seeing them at
[1:13:07] the same time
[1:13:08] but with us it takes long
[1:13:11] and then he made an illustration
[1:13:14] let's say um we have an aunt
[1:13:17] that is moving from um Gastonia to maybe
[1:13:20] uh
[1:13:22] uh let's say Mint Hill
[1:13:25] meant here
[1:13:28] it's going to take years
[1:13:31] for that ant to get to Mint Hill
[1:13:34] but with us we can just get into a
[1:13:37] vehicle and drive
[1:13:39] within an hour we are there
[1:13:42] and that is how the promises of God are
[1:13:45] leaving it's it's just within a short
[1:13:48] word to God so when God made that
[1:13:51] promise the Fulfillment
[1:13:53] is at the same time God is seeing the
[1:13:56] promise and the Fulfillment at the same
[1:13:58] time but with us we seek to belong we
[1:14:02] see to take several years
[1:14:06] so we come to God and said okay I prayed
[1:14:10] about this I prayed about that I prayed
[1:14:13] about this and it's taking two years
[1:14:15] it's taken three years it's taking five
[1:14:17] years with God he's saying it at the
[1:14:19] same time the same time he gave the
[1:14:20] promise that's the same time he's in the
[1:14:22] Fulfillment
[1:14:23] so when you come to God and say God I
[1:14:25] prayed about this I prayed about this
[1:14:27] five years ten years I'm still not
[1:14:29] seeing it God is like I'm still seeing
[1:14:31] the Fulfillment of the promise
[1:14:33] so when he said you are healed by his
[1:14:36] stripes and you were healed God is
[1:14:39] seeing your healing but because we are
[1:14:42] in this flesh this flesh makes it so
[1:14:45] long
[1:14:46] it becomes so delayed and you're seeing
[1:14:49] it five years ten years 15 years but God
[1:14:52] is seeing the Fulfillment of that
[1:14:53] promise
[1:14:56] amen
[1:14:59] said Abraham was able to achieve the
[1:15:02] title of father of Nations
[1:15:05] and have the child
[1:15:07] because he believed and was perseverant
[1:15:11] with his faith
[1:15:13] he said why he could be persevered
[1:15:17] God had promised it
[1:15:20] he was persuaded fully that God was able
[1:15:23] to perform that what he had said oh my
[1:15:29] how can the Seed of Abraham the Royal
[1:15:31] Seed of Abraham the Church of the Living
[1:15:34] God look upon a promise and then don't
[1:15:38] believe it
[1:15:40] I said God's Eternal Word
[1:15:42] I am Divine ye are the branches see if
[1:15:47] he abide in me and my word in you ask
[1:15:51] what you will and it will be done for
[1:15:54] you see oh what promises he gives us
[1:15:58] we could cut them
[1:16:00] but you can only be perseverant when you
[1:16:03] got a hold of the word
[1:16:06] amen
[1:16:08] when you get a hold of that word
[1:16:11] you can only be perseverant when the
[1:16:14] word is not in there you can't persevere
[1:16:18] when the word is pro is pointing you to
[1:16:22] the to the Fulfillment of that word you
[1:16:25] are looking at the Fulfillment and you
[1:16:27] are going to hold on to the word until
[1:16:29] that fulfillment is done
[1:16:31] so that is going to make you persevere
[1:16:34] amen because the word is abiding in you
[1:16:37] but if there's no word in there
[1:16:40] there's no Focus there's no vision you
[1:16:43] are not looking at an aim you're not
[1:16:45] looking at a fulfillment
[1:16:47] amen so you're going to lose hope
[1:16:51] amen
[1:16:53] amen you can only persevere when you are
[1:16:56] looking at the Fulfillment of that
[1:16:58] vision
[1:17:01] amen
[1:17:03] amen that's yes there's always a Target
[1:17:06] to look at amen
[1:17:12] Lord help me
[1:17:15] amen
[1:17:23] now I want to take um
[1:17:28] I hope I'm within time amen
[1:17:31] this uh from the message God
[1:17:34] commissioning Moses
[1:17:36] preaching 53 he said if we can have
[1:17:40] faith now for healing
[1:17:42] how are we going to have rapturing faith
[1:17:46] brother Brown said hmm
[1:17:48] just like how you say
[1:17:52] he said we've got to have faith for the
[1:17:55] little things first
[1:17:56] before the great things
[1:17:59] we must have faith for Divine Healing we
[1:18:02] must have faith for the Fulfillment of
[1:18:05] every promise of God before we have that
[1:18:07] rapturing faith that is taking us to the
[1:18:09] rapture
[1:18:11] we must have faith for the little things
[1:18:13] first before they create things
[1:18:16] amen you must have faith that the Lord
[1:18:18] is going to pay those bills
[1:18:21] amen you must have faith that the Lord
[1:18:24] is going to provide the food on your
[1:18:27] table amen you must have faith that the
[1:18:30] Lord is going to take care of your kids
[1:18:32] you must have faith that the Lord is
[1:18:34] going to heal your diseases amen before
[1:18:38] we start thinking about the Rapture
[1:18:40] faith that is taking us to the rapture
[1:18:43] amen he said so there will be something
[1:18:49] that will cause he said that's on
[1:18:52] that's in God's Providence
[1:18:54] I do not know but I seen a demonstration
[1:18:59] of it recently and that's what I want to
[1:19:02] tell you about
[1:19:03] then when God sent this little fellow
[1:19:06] Moses talking about Moses he was one
[1:19:08] kind of
[1:19:09] an odd birth
[1:19:12] and in a peculiar time
[1:19:14] it was more like a squeeze you know
[1:19:17] about the story
[1:19:18] amen that they had to go and hide him
[1:19:21] Amen in on the water in the basket amen
[1:19:24] amen and God hid him away
[1:19:27] it was God's election and calling
[1:19:31] Amen to send Moses down there Moses
[1:19:35] couldn't help because he was Moses
[1:19:39] he said Moses couldn't help because he
[1:19:42] was Moses
[1:19:43] amen I am brother said I can't help amen
[1:19:46] because I'm sad amen God has to take
[1:19:50] care of it
[1:19:51] that's how God has has called me that's
[1:19:53] how God has elected me amen and I can't
[1:19:56] help because this is me amen he said but
[1:20:00] how God preserved his life
[1:20:03] it was predestination and fro ordained
[1:20:07] will of God
[1:20:09] and then when he finally got him into
[1:20:12] the desert to her the Sheep of Jethro
[1:20:15] after he had become a murderer
[1:20:18] then one day God spoke to him in a
[1:20:22] burning bush
[1:20:23] God told him to take off his shoes
[1:20:26] amen
[1:20:28] remember Brian Stevens preaching on
[1:20:31] taking off your shoes
[1:20:33] amen that the Lord himself will come and
[1:20:35] step in those shoes
[1:20:37] amen amen said God told him to take off
[1:20:41] his shoes
[1:20:42] for the ground was holy where he stood
[1:20:46] and how that God LED that church in the
[1:20:50] natural it's a perfect type of the
[1:20:52] spiritual he's leading it today
[1:20:56] he brought out Israel the natural by
[1:21:00] signs wonders and miracles he brings out
[1:21:03] the spiritual in this day Saints wonders
[1:21:07] miracles
[1:21:08] God
[1:21:10] has always
[1:21:12] they've always accompanied God
[1:21:15] because God is Supernatural
[1:21:18] he is a creator
[1:21:21] amen if God LED them by signs and
[1:21:24] wonders and miracles in those days he is
[1:21:26] doing the same thing today amen if God
[1:21:29] healed diseases in those days he's doing
[1:21:32] the same thing today
[1:21:34] if God provided for them in those days
[1:21:36] he's doing the same thing today
[1:21:39] amen
[1:21:41] there's nothing impossible to him
[1:21:44] and when a man becomes born again
[1:21:47] of the spirit of God he becomes an
[1:21:50] offspring
[1:21:52] or a son of God Amen
[1:21:56] amen and then he has the same type of of
[1:22:00] mind that God does
[1:22:03] the mind that was in Christ is in US
[1:22:07] and we believe for the Unseen for the
[1:22:12] miraculous
[1:22:14] amen
[1:22:16] amen he said and just anything see
[1:22:20] and then we have the Holy Spirit
[1:22:23] who bring or comes to us and speaks to
[1:22:26] us concerning these things
[1:22:28] the Holy Spirit comes and reminds us
[1:22:31] that he is doing the same thing today
[1:22:34] amen he said and that's the whole
[1:22:36] purpose of these meetings dear Christian
[1:22:39] friend
[1:22:40] it's for no other purpose before God but
[1:22:44] that your faith in God might be
[1:22:46] stimulated to a place to believe him for
[1:22:51] the Salvation of your soul and for the
[1:22:54] healing of your body
[1:22:58] amen
[1:23:01] now this is a question and answers in 52
[1:23:04] he said if you are filled with the Holy
[1:23:06] Ghost this morning or this evening
[1:23:09] and God's power is moving in every fiber
[1:23:12] of your body
[1:23:13] what good would it do for you to stand
[1:23:16] in the judgment
[1:23:18] he said you're already charged
[1:23:21] and been received and filled and already
[1:23:24] translated into Heavenly places with
[1:23:28] Christ Jesus
[1:23:29] there's already an inner translation as
[1:23:32] we learned on Sunday there's already an
[1:23:35] inner translation amen
[1:23:37] which you project to the outward
[1:23:39] translation
[1:23:41] amen
[1:23:42] he said you've already been translated
[1:23:45] into Heavenly places
[1:23:47] we are sitting here in Heavenly places
[1:23:51] with Christ Jesus
[1:23:53] he said not you will be
[1:23:55] said you aren't now right now translated
[1:24:01] amen amen
[1:24:04] Those whom he called he justified Those
[1:24:08] whom he justified he glorified
[1:24:11] and every redeemed person in the world
[1:24:14] this evening that's under the blood of
[1:24:18] Jesus Christ filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:24:21] have everlasting life and can't perish
[1:24:25] and it's already in Heavenly places with
[1:24:29] Christ Jesus and shall never come into
[1:24:32] condemnation
[1:24:34] already redeemed
[1:24:37] isn't that wonderful amen
[1:24:41] amen
[1:24:42] Prophet said isn't that wonderful
[1:24:45] [Music]
[1:24:47] amen it's it's it's just so beautiful
[1:24:49] amen when you're just when you're just
[1:24:52] reading these love letters love stories
[1:24:55] to the bride amen that was brought by
[1:24:58] whom the son of man himself amen giving
[1:25:01] you the love stories amen amen
[1:25:04] amen
[1:25:06] amen so Jesus said that oh the scripture
[1:25:09] says that all the writers poor he said
[1:25:12] Those whom he justified he had already
[1:25:15] glorified
[1:25:16] Those whom he for ordained he
[1:25:19] predestinated Those whom he
[1:25:21] predestinated he justified
[1:25:23] Those whom he justified he has already
[1:25:26] glorified what is it oh my
[1:25:30] said already glorified then if we are

[1:28:13] and that and the doctor says you can't
[1:28:16] get well and so forth that's just the
[1:28:19] natural thing

[1:28:54] them amen I said now you can imagine how
[1:28:57] that Prophet or that gehazi felt the
[1:29:01] servant he looked over at him he said

[1:29:12] I said God open this boy's eyes
[1:29:17] amen
[1:29:19] amen
[1:29:21] and as soon as God did something here it
[1:29:23] is get it when God opened his spiritual
[1:29:27] sight
[1:29:28] all around there the prophet stood
[1:29:32] Chariots of Fire and angels of fire why
[1:29:35] he's seen
[1:29:37] the Chariots of Fire
[1:29:39] outnumbered that Syrian Army by the
[1:29:42] thousands
[1:29:43] the mountains was on fire angels of fire
[1:29:46] horses of fire Chariots of it was on
[1:29:49] fire around him

[1:29:56] would happen if a man here tonight had
[1:29:59] the power to strike across your eyes
[1:30:03] amen you are in distress you are going
[1:30:05] through your own challenges you're going
[1:30:07] to depressions and all that
[1:30:09] the prophet is saying that he wishes
[1:30:12] tonight that a man strike across your
[1:30:16] eyes
[1:30:17] and say look standing around this time
[1:30:19] like tonight you would be a member here
[1:30:22] the rest of your life sure yes sir
[1:30:25] sometimes you can't see it with your
[1:30:28] natural eyes
[1:30:29] but you can feel the impulse of it
[1:30:32] something near a success that denotes
[1:30:36] something is near
[1:30:38] amen sometimes you're going through all
[1:30:41] your challenges your your distress and
[1:30:43] all those things
[1:30:44] but then God will just bring a feeling
[1:30:48] to you
[1:30:50] that Sixth Sense
[1:30:52] that his presence is here
[1:30:55] amen
[1:30:57] amen God help me amen this from the
[1:31:01] message power of transformation
[1:31:03] God likes to be worshiped
[1:31:07] so God likes to be worshiped
[1:31:10] I'll repeat that again
[1:31:13] remember Sunday
[1:31:15] president talks about
[1:31:17] worshiping amen when somebody comes to
[1:31:20] worship
[1:31:21] let us all be in worship amen it it
[1:31:25] shouldn't be just the person saying I
[1:31:28] thank the Lord and I'm singing to thank
[1:31:29] God let us all be in that Spirit of
[1:31:32] worship and we as a United Army
[1:31:36] are thanking God and worshiping God we
[1:31:40] are not just looking at the person
[1:31:41] thanking God but we are thanking God for
[1:31:44] the life of the person
[1:31:46] amen
[1:31:48] when I get healed it's like you getting
[1:31:50] healed
[1:31:51] amen because if if I am not healed I
[1:31:55] can't stand here tonight and we can't
[1:31:58] benefit from what is going on if if the
[1:32:01] pastor is going through something and he
[1:32:04] doesn't
[1:32:04] have the grace of God that comes to him
[1:32:07] we are all going to
[1:32:09] we are going to get affected amen amen
[1:32:13] so so so when when the Lord keeps him it
[1:32:17] is a victory for all of us amen so when
[1:32:20] he comes and he's given a testimony we
[1:32:22] must all share in that testimony amen
[1:32:25] so God likes to be worshiped
[1:32:28] and when you worship Him
[1:32:30] it just isn't exactly singing a song as
[1:32:33] we do
[1:32:38] amen
[1:32:44] it's not
[1:32:46] it isn't exactly singing a song
[1:32:49] as we do but singing it in the spirit of
[1:32:54] worship
[1:32:56] I am singing a song in the spirit of
[1:32:59] worship
[1:33:02] you see I said then you feel the Holy
[1:33:05] Spirit bounce back
[1:33:08] when you're singing in the spirit of
[1:33:10] worship then the Holy Spirit comes in
[1:33:14] amen
[1:33:16] say and I see great big young men here
[1:33:19] just think of the day that group of
[1:33:21] young fellows sitting there young boys
[1:33:24] and their little wives sitting along
[1:33:26] there and big rough men sitting there
[1:33:29] and just cry like little babies
[1:33:32] why look at today they are out there on
[1:33:35] the street living in adultery and filth
[1:33:38] of the world and things
[1:33:40] amen this was in 65. I just wonder how
[1:33:44] how the prophet would have said it in
[1:33:46] this day amen amen
[1:33:50] and and to think that you can come apart
[1:33:53] and gather like this
[1:33:55] whereas the psalmist said behold how
[1:33:59] sweet and pleasant for breathing to
[1:34:01] dwell together in unity
[1:34:03] it's like the anointing oil
[1:34:07] that was on Aaron's beard
[1:34:09] that ran to the hands of His Garment
[1:34:12] amen
[1:34:14] which that anointing oil
[1:34:16] you know what the anointing oil done he
[1:34:20] said he preserved him
[1:34:23] to go in the presence of God
[1:34:27] so when the church is United when the
[1:34:29] church is in the spirit of unity it
[1:34:32] gives the minister an oil of
[1:34:35] preservation to come to the presence of
[1:34:37] God
[1:34:39] wow
[1:34:41] when the Brethren are united in one
[1:34:45] Accord in one Spirit of the word it
[1:34:48] preserved the minister to come to the
[1:34:50] presence of the Lord
[1:34:54] amen
[1:34:56] that is why we fight that Spirit of
[1:34:58] Discord when it comes
[1:35:00] amen we pray against it amen
[1:35:03] amen
[1:35:06] so it's like the anointing oil that was
[1:35:08] on Aaron's beard that ran to the hems of
[1:35:12] His Garment
[1:35:13] which that's anointing oil you know
[1:35:17] what's the anointing oil done it present
[1:35:19] him to go in the presence of God see he
[1:35:21] had to be anointed without oil before he
[1:35:24] went in the presence of God and when
[1:35:27] Brethren can do well together in unity
[1:35:30] it's liking unto that oil
[1:35:34] we then enter into the presence of the
[1:35:36] Lord with that anointing of Brethren
[1:35:39] together in unity
[1:35:41] oil represents the Holy Spirit
[1:35:44] amen we are talking about a preserved
[1:35:48] generation so when Brethren are united
[1:35:51] in one spirit in one Accord it gives the
[1:35:54] minister a preserved oil a preserved the
[1:35:58] minister to come in the presence of the
[1:36:00] Lord
[1:36:02] amen
[1:36:05] now this is the Harvest Time in 64.
[1:36:08] I should be closing very short
[1:36:10] amen it's a nature speaks that this same
[1:36:15] seed went in the ground the same seed
[1:36:18] comes up again
[1:36:20] it's talking about when you put when
[1:36:22] you're planting a seed Amen in the
[1:36:25] ground he said the same seed comes up
[1:36:26] again it says see the same Jesus went
[1:36:31] down
[1:36:32] is the same Jesus come back
[1:36:36] Hallelujah
[1:36:38] and this body when it falls into the
[1:36:41] ground it will not come back a flower or
[1:36:45] something else it will come back a man
[1:36:48] or a woman
[1:36:50] you see it in nature how it does it has
[1:36:54] to go through the cold Winters and rots
[1:36:58] and so forth but the life is preserved
[1:37:02] if there is any life in it
[1:37:05] he said if there is any life in it it is
[1:37:08] preserved amen
[1:37:10] but if if that seed hasn't been
[1:37:14] gemnatized
[1:37:16] it will never raise again
[1:37:18] you don't have that seed that life in it
[1:37:21] it will never rise again it can't race
[1:37:24] there is nothing in it to raise it
[1:37:27] that is why before you get translated in
[1:37:31] this body there must be that life
[1:37:34] already in you
[1:37:38] amen there must be a first translation
[1:37:41] in you before a produced the the natural
[1:37:46] one amen
[1:37:48] amen
[1:37:50] amen
[1:37:52] and if we just become a nominal
[1:37:54] Christian
[1:37:56] he said there is two churches in the
[1:37:58] world
[1:37:59] Church natural Church spiritual
[1:38:03] they are all called Christians
[1:38:07] when you walk out on the streets you see
[1:38:09] a lot of people Everyone is a Christian
[1:38:12] regardless of how they act as long as
[1:38:15] they go to church they are called
[1:38:16] Christians
[1:38:18] the prophet is saying there is two
[1:38:21] churches in the World Church natural
[1:38:22] Church spiritual they are all called
[1:38:25] Christians
[1:38:27] but the church natural cannot raise
[1:38:32] the church natural cannot race because
[1:38:35] translation has not taken place inside
[1:38:38] [Music]
[1:38:40] so each do it's doing it's raising now
[1:38:45] in the word council of churches
[1:38:49] the church natural
[1:38:51] is translating itself or is resurrecting
[1:38:54] itself in the world Council of churches
[1:38:57] it's about a Christian Rises to meet
[1:39:00] Christ
[1:39:01] because it's a bride
[1:39:04] to go to meet him
[1:39:07] there is a difference in them nature
[1:39:10] hold these secrets to us
[1:39:12] and we can see them as we watch them
[1:39:15] and we see the Christ we see that
[1:39:18] Christianity speaks the truth of death
[1:39:20] burial and Resurrection
[1:39:23] amen
[1:39:25] amen
[1:39:28] Lord help me
[1:39:32] I need to read the scripture
[1:39:37] Genesis 45.
[1:39:44] I'm going to close very short
[1:39:46] ly amen
[1:39:56] foreign
[1:40:00] Genesis 45 verses 7 to 13.

[1:40:07] brothers may we know the story about
[1:40:09] Joseph amen go to a time when he now
[1:40:13] um unveiled himself to his brothers amen
[1:40:16] as the prophet said this is a type of
[1:40:20] Christ being revealed to his brothers
[1:40:22] amen we we just want to take a little um
[1:40:28] little insight from this scripture amen
[1:40:31] he said and God sent me before you to
[1:40:34] preserve you a posterity in the earth
[1:40:38] and to save your lives for a great
[1:40:41] Deliverance
[1:40:42] so now it was not you that sent me
[1:40:45] either
[1:40:46] but God
[1:40:48] and he have made me a father to pharaoh
[1:40:52] now when I was looking at this
[1:40:55] a father amen
[1:40:57] everybody
[1:40:59] sometimes you read scripture and when
[1:41:01] the Lord had opened your eyes throughout
[1:41:04] the preaching of the word you look at
[1:41:06] scripture different said the father
[1:41:08] who is the fact the father to Pharaoh I
[1:41:11] would say Joseph was the father of
[1:41:13] pharaoh
[1:41:15] you ask yourself this question did
[1:41:17] Joseph give birth to pharaoh
[1:41:20] so what does the father mean
[1:41:24] amen I'm equal with pharaoh
[1:41:31] amen
[1:41:34] so now it was not you that sent me
[1:41:37] either but God and and he had made me a
[1:41:41] father to pharaoh and Lord of all his
[1:41:44] house and a ruler threw out all the land
[1:41:48] of Egypt amen he said hey see and go up
[1:41:52] to my father and say unto him that said
[1:41:56] that son Joseph God had made me Lord of
[1:42:00] all Egypt come down unto me tearing out
[1:42:04] and thou shall dwell in the land of
[1:42:06] Goshen and thou shall be near unto me
[1:42:10] thou and thy children and their
[1:42:13] children's children and thy flocks and
[1:42:16] thy hurts and all that thou Hast
[1:42:20] and there will I nourish thee
[1:42:24] for yet there are five years of farming
[1:42:27] less doubt and thy household and all
[1:42:30] that thou Hast come to poverty and
[1:42:33] behold your I see
[1:42:36] and the eyes of my brother Benjamin that
[1:42:39] it is my mouth that's speaking unto you
[1:42:41] and he shall tell my father of all my
[1:42:44] glory in Egypt and all that ye have seen
[1:42:47] and he shall haste and bring down my
[1:42:50] father heater
[1:42:51] amen
[1:42:54] the Lord is putting out us in a place
[1:42:57] called Goshen so that we are near to him
[1:43:02] amen a preserved people
[1:43:05] in a place that he is close to us we are
[1:43:09] close to him he has a purpose for our
[1:43:12] lives amen now I just want to um
[1:43:16] say something some few words about what
[1:43:19] preservation is he said the main
[1:43:22] intention of preservation is keeping in
[1:43:24] its original state
[1:43:29] amen when you're preserving something
[1:43:32] it's because you want to keep it in its
[1:43:34] original state
[1:43:36] so when God is preserving Us in this day
[1:43:39] he is keeping us in that original state
[1:43:41] that we were before the foundation of
[1:43:44] the world that is why you must look like
[1:43:46] who you were before the foundation of
[1:43:48] the world
[1:43:50] amen he sends his word to clean us up
[1:43:54] amen so that we look like who we were
[1:43:57] before the foundation of the world
[1:44:00] amen
[1:44:02] amen
[1:44:04] it is kept in a secured environment
[1:44:07] with the covering
[1:44:09] [Music]
[1:44:12] amen
[1:44:13] a secured environment with a covering
[1:44:18] amen if you want to preserve something
[1:44:20] you don't want
[1:44:22] other external forces to come to it
[1:44:26] you are trying to stop those other um
[1:44:29] external factors from coming to to to
[1:44:32] get the thing rotten amen
[1:44:35] so you preserve it in a secured
[1:44:37] environment and you get it covered
[1:44:41] amen
[1:44:42] now when when that is done and the time
[1:44:45] comes for it to be used then you take
[1:44:48] off the covering
[1:44:53] amen
[1:44:54] you take off the covering but then what
[1:44:57] is inside the tin on the can
[1:45:00] it's original amen and we must be in
[1:45:04] that original state where we are meeting
[1:45:07] him in the air
[1:45:12] amen
[1:45:14] the Holy Ghost
[1:45:16] is our preservative
[1:45:20] amen
[1:45:22] amen
[1:45:23] the Holy Ghost is our preservative
[1:45:25] Ephesians 4 30.
[1:45:29] amen
[1:45:30] the Holy Ghost is given to us to
[1:45:33] preserve us
[1:45:35] and seal us in amen
[1:45:38] until the day of your Redemption amen
[1:45:43] and amen amen
[1:45:45] amen
[1:45:47] and you see that that process of
[1:45:49] preserve preservation is intended to
[1:45:52] kill all external influence that cause
[1:45:55] damage
[1:45:56] [Music]
[1:45:58] the intention of preservation is to kill
[1:46:01] all those external forces that will come
[1:46:04] and cause damage to you
[1:46:06] that is what the Lord has sent us his
[1:46:09] message to preserve us from all those
[1:46:12] Creeds and those doctrines that the
[1:46:14] world that the church nominal is
[1:46:17] creating to come across damage to his
[1:46:20] children
[1:46:23] amen
[1:46:25] amen
[1:46:27] amen that bomb of Gilead amen
[1:46:30] amen
[1:46:33] and you see preservation is normally
[1:46:36] done for a future usage
[1:46:38] [Music]
[1:46:40] amen
[1:46:42] amen preservation is normally done for a
[1:46:45] future usage amen so when the Lord is
[1:46:48] preserving us he has an intention he has
[1:46:51] a purpose in our lives that is why he's
[1:46:53] preserving us for you to be a glorious
[1:46:57] Church a church without spot a wrinkle

[1:47:28] Noah went into the ark for safety
[1:47:32] lot came out of Sodom one came out the
[1:47:36] other went in
[1:47:38] what is it the type of when it's
[1:47:41] conglomerated together
[1:47:43] it's the type of the church coming out
[1:47:46] of the world for safety
[1:47:49] and going into the Ark of Christ to go
[1:47:52] to Glory
[1:47:55] we are getting into that preservation of
[1:47:58] Christ to go into Glory
[1:48:01] amen it's a word come out the other went
[1:48:05] in one come out to keep from being

[1:50:45] wayward eaglets are run over the city

[1:50:54] to beat the crust of the world from them
[1:50:57] amen amen that they can enjoy this
[1:51:01] Fellowship by letting of the pressure in
[1:51:04] this day of atomic age when the world is
[1:51:07] scared
[1:51:08] when the world is kept
[1:51:11] a whole lot of depression going on each
[1:51:14] nation is shaking the skies are
[1:51:16] trembling all nature is crying out the
[1:51:19] world itself is trembling because it
[1:51:22] could be brought to Beats
[1:51:24] but we have a kingdom that cannot be
[1:51:27] moved we have a City of Refuge we have a
[1:51:31] gaussian where the sun will never go
[1:51:34] down granted Lord let us come to this
[1:51:37] rock now
[1:51:39] amen
[1:51:42] now this is my last quote and then I'll
[1:51:44] be done amen this from the token
[1:51:47] he said I'm talking about the apply
[1:51:49] token
[1:51:51] the token agrees with every word
[1:51:55] and we know is the talking of the holy
[1:51:57] spirit amen see it's got it it's got to
[1:52:01] amen because it is the word
[1:52:04] it's the life that was in the word my
[1:52:07] words are spiritual their life
[1:52:10] said Jesus see
[1:52:13] my words are spiritual
[1:52:15] I was I was I was talking to my wife um
[1:52:18] some few days back
[1:52:20] I was telling her that the difference
[1:52:23] between
[1:52:25] Rewritten the Bible
[1:52:27] and those in denomination reading the
[1:52:29] Bible is that they have their own
[1:52:32] interpretation
[1:52:34] and the kind of interpretation you have
[1:52:36] of the Bible
[1:52:39] shows in your actions
[1:52:43] those kind of interpretation developed
[1:52:46] the spirit that leads you
[1:52:49] so when you watch them behave the way
[1:52:52] they do it's a kind of interpretation
[1:52:54] that they had that is making them act
[1:52:57] the way they act
[1:52:59] that is not the Holy Ghost
[1:53:02] amen the spirit of the Lord must line up
[1:53:05] with every word when you're acting in a
[1:53:08] certain way it must line up with
[1:53:10] everywhere then you know that your
[1:53:13] interpretation of the word is the
[1:53:15] correct one
[1:53:18] so when Moses begin his ministry in
[1:53:20] Israel with great sights you see Israel
[1:53:24] quickly guarded from all over Egypt to
[1:53:26] Goshen coming back to the home place
[1:53:29] because they know something was fixing
[1:53:31] to happen
[1:53:33] the Lord bringing us together
[1:53:36] we know something is fixing to happen
[1:53:38] amen he said oh what a type
[1:53:41] they come from the East and West they
[1:53:44] come from the lines are far Amen to face

[1:53:51] blessed these pilgrims are beholding his
[1:53:54] hallowed face a glow with love divine
[1:53:57] blessed partakers of his grace as germs
[1:54:00] it is called to shine
[1:54:03] said oh Jesus is coming soon
[1:54:08] our trials will then be all
[1:54:12] oh whatever Lord this moment should come
[1:54:15] for those who are free from sin
[1:54:18] for those who are free from sin
[1:54:21] all day will they bring you Joy or
[1:54:23] sorrow and great despair when our Lord
[1:54:26] in glory comes we'll meet him up in the
[1:54:29] air
[1:54:30] amen
[1:54:32] displaying the talking
[1:54:35] and I'll raise him up in the last days
[1:54:38] certainly we are in the days
[1:54:41] the people gathered into Goshen
[1:54:43] they were ready
[1:54:45] they were ready
[1:54:47] amen they know something was fixing to
[1:54:50] happen
[1:54:52] there was just like
[1:54:54] you take ducks when it's time to for
[1:54:56] swarming you know that's amen when it's
[1:54:59] time for swimming he said they all run
[1:55:02] right together
[1:55:04] amen
[1:55:06] when peace everything else gets ready
[1:55:09] there is some Instinct draws them we can
[1:55:13] see this thing in nature amen
[1:55:16] the Holy Spirit draws the people
[1:55:21] the Holy Spirit draws the people
[1:55:25] amen oh when they come time for the
[1:55:29] great wrath of God to fall
[1:55:31] there come two ducks male and female
[1:55:35] here come two geese male and female here
[1:55:39] come two horses male and female
[1:55:41] something another pulling them
[1:55:44] the predestinated the rest of them
[1:55:48] perished oh the rest of them perished
[1:55:50] but those who felt that to come in
[1:55:55] they know that Ark was prepared it was a
[1:55:59] token that there's coming a ring
[1:56:02] they know that there was coming away no
[1:56:06] matter what the display was and what
[1:56:08] other people thought
[1:56:10] they're not amen there was something
[1:56:13] inside of them said get into there right
[1:56:17] quick get into them because that's the
[1:56:20] only place that's going to be safe
[1:56:22] because God prepared a prophet he said
[1:56:26] they act as a sign
[1:56:28] get in there and the rain was coming and
[1:56:31] they went right in there two by two all
[1:56:35] the animals went in two by two into the
[1:56:37] ark because they had not beneath it no
[1:56:41] matter what they rest amen and all
[1:56:44] outside of that act perished all outside
[1:56:48] the token of the blood perished everyone
[1:56:52] and everyone outside the talking of the
[1:56:55] Holy Ghost will perish
[1:56:58] amen shall we give a clap of rain unto
[1:57:01] the Lord amen amen amen
[1:57:04] a preserved generation
[1:57:07] amen amen amen
[1:57:10] sorry to take the time amen but we thank
[1:57:14] the Lord for this word amen
[1:57:17] and you're going to invite our brother
[1:57:18] Stephen amen amen to take over tonight
[1:57:21] look amen amen amen amen
[1:57:31] amen God richly bless you and preserved
[1:57:36] generation
[1:57:37] amen
[1:57:39] preserve for a future use
[1:57:41] amen preserved so that the factors of
[1:57:45] the outside doesn't influence you and
[1:57:49] you remain original
[1:57:51] if you look at the way the world is
[1:57:54] going now and the way you remain it
[1:57:57] seems like the world is moving on and
[1:57:59] the people on the message are still
[1:58:01] living the same kind of message that
[1:58:03] they preach since 1953. we're still
[1:58:06] trying to live exactly the same message
[1:58:08] we have not changed the message the
[1:58:11] message is still the same amen the
[1:58:14] technology is changing the world is
[1:58:17] changing but the world remains forever
[1:58:20] amen so the word is your best
[1:58:23] preservative
[1:58:24] amen glory to God I didn't want to do
[1:58:29] this but I have to do it in Psalm 27
[1:58:33] that the brother read the Bible say in
[1:58:36] the time of trouble
[1:58:39] he shall hide me in his water
[1:58:42] where is the Pavilion of God
[1:58:46] everybody okay the Bible continue he
[1:58:49] said in the secret place of water
[1:58:53] he's Tabernacle so the Pavilion of God
[1:58:58] is where
[1:59:00] in the Tabernacle and the Tabernacle
[1:59:02] have how many places
[1:59:05] how many places
[1:59:06] and one day Marana fell down from heaven
[1:59:12] I'm giving you time so you can catch up
[1:59:14] quickly everybody okay and God told
[1:59:17] Moses that he wanted to preserve
[1:59:21] a Mana for future
[1:59:24] generation
[1:59:26] so that every high priest that is coming
[1:59:29] on the oncoming generation can go back
[1:59:32] and taste of the original manner that
[1:59:37] manner cannot be changed you have to
[1:59:40] have the same test
[1:59:42] the same color the same culture
[1:59:46] everything must look the same so God
[1:59:49] told Moses that I must find a place
[1:59:52] where I need to preserve the manner
[1:59:56] amen was the manner preserved in the
[2:00:00] other quarter he was subject to the
[2:00:03] outside
[2:00:04] everybody okay everybody okay because
[2:00:08] the other court was opened to the
[2:00:10] outside if it rained outside it's gonna
[2:00:13] rain in the outer court if it's cold
[2:00:16] outside it's going to be called on the
[2:00:18] other code if it's no outside we will
[2:00:21] find snow in the other code so the other
[2:00:24] court was not the appropriate place
[2:00:27] to keep the manner so God move on into
[2:00:30] the holy place and in the Holy place did
[2:00:33] God put the manner there because he was
[2:00:36] still subject to man manipulation
[2:00:39] because the priest could get in the
[2:00:42] first Tabernacle in the other court and
[2:00:44] the priest could go to the second uh in
[2:00:47] the holiest place and manipulate the
[2:00:49] manner but God had a secret place
[2:00:54] and that secret place was the holiest
[2:00:58] the most holy over there was in the
[2:01:01] presence of God when God took the Manna
[2:01:05] and put it in the holiest then the
[2:01:08] manner was preserved
[2:01:12] everybody okay if you want God to
[2:01:16] preserve your marriage
[2:01:18] if you want a God to preserve your life
[2:01:21] if you want a God to preserve your
[2:01:24] children the only place of preservation
[2:01:27] is in the Holy Spirit take your family
[2:01:30] into the holiest take your children into
[2:01:33] the holiest take your business into the
[2:01:36] holiest take your life and every aspect
[2:01:40] of your life and go with them into the
[2:01:43] holiest so God can preserve your
[2:01:46] children he will preserve your husband
[2:01:48] he will preserve your health he will
[2:01:50] preserve your school he will preserve
[2:01:53] even your chair
[2:01:56] that took a chair from Brother Branham
[2:01:58] but when brother Branham went in the
[2:02:01] sixth Dimension he found the chair over
[2:02:04] there he found his dog over there
[2:02:06] whatever you want to preserve in your
[2:02:09] life bring it into the presence of God
[2:02:12] bring it into the presence of almighty
[2:02:15] God that is the best place of
[2:02:17] preservation
[2:02:19] glory to God
[2:02:24] that's why we put a token in our home
[2:02:28] so that our houses will be under the
[2:02:33] preservation amen a house of
[2:02:36] prostitution
[2:02:37] amen was under the token and everything
[2:02:41] else in Jericho fell but their house of
[2:02:45] Rahab was preserved
[2:02:48] out of the entire city the only Memorial
[2:02:51] that was left was where the token was
[2:02:54] and he didn't only preserve the house
[2:02:57] but he preserved the entire family he
[2:03:00] preserved the father he preserved the
[2:03:03] mother he preserved everybody and not
[2:03:06] only did he preserve the family and
[2:03:08] whatever was in the house of rehab
[2:03:12] if Rahab had the chair that chair was
[2:03:16] preserved if she had also a bedroom I
[2:03:20] mean a bed that bed was reserved
[2:03:22] whatever was in the house was preserved
[2:03:26] why because the token the best
[2:03:29] preservative was put in the house
[2:03:34] when you fight the devil show him the
[2:03:36] token
[2:03:38] when he seen the token it's telling the
[2:03:40] devil you cannot cross the bloodline
[2:03:44] everybody okay you cannot cross the
[2:03:47] blood
[2:03:47] amen Oh Glory to God
[2:03:51] hallelujah let me close by this also the
[2:03:55] Bible says in the secret place of his
[2:03:57] word Tabernacle he shall do water
[2:04:01] because that's where you can be
[2:04:03] preserved
[2:04:04] that's why we can never over emphasize
[2:04:07] the need of a holy ghost to a Believer
[2:04:11] if you want to be preserved in this
[2:04:13] generation against every outside forces
[2:04:16] you must be in the holiest but look at
[2:04:20] what is also in that secret place the
[2:04:23] Bible says and in the secret place of
[2:04:25] his Tabernacle shall he hide me
[2:04:28] everybody okay He Shall Set me
[2:04:33] you got your Bible he shall set me up
[2:04:36] upon a rock
[2:04:39] so in the holiest
[2:04:41] David is saying there was a rock
[2:04:44] [Music]
[2:04:46] but if you look at the furniture of the
[2:04:49] Tabernacle and you look on the holiest
[2:04:51] there was no Rock
[2:04:53] it was only the Ark of the Covenant
[2:04:56] so which rock was there
[2:04:59] everybody okay because when Israel was
[2:05:02] going in on the first Exodus there was a
[2:05:06] rock following them
[2:05:08] what happened
[2:05:09] [Applause]

[2:05:28] right
[2:05:29] let's go to Galatians

[2:05:37] if it's not galatian it might be
[2:05:39] quarantine brother Robert you found it
[2:05:44] First Corinthians 10.

[2:06:48] remember in the holiest there was
[2:06:51] already manner there
[2:06:53] that you can eat but you also need some
[2:06:55] drink

[2:07:02] drinking you covered Paul says then we
[2:07:05] are covered amen

[2:07:21] have you ever seen a rock following you
[2:07:25] amen he said that spiritual rock that
[2:07:28] followed them and that rock was hooked
[2:07:33] now David said in the secret place of
[2:07:36] the Tabernacle he will hide me because
[2:07:39] he want me to be preserved
[2:07:42] but not only am I preserved over there
[2:07:44] there is also a rock over there in other
[2:07:48] words in the secret place that is where
[2:07:51] Christ is
[2:07:52] everybody okay and Paul says that we
[2:07:56] need to find our position in

[2:09:05] and Lucifer begin to look
[2:09:08] and he looked he saw Michael he said
[2:09:10] Michael where's the body of Moses Marco

[2:11:59] Hallelujah Hallelujah let's pray
[2:12:03] Heavenly Father
[2:12:04] Lord we are approaching you again humbly
[2:12:08] this evening
[2:12:09] father thanking you for your grace
[2:12:13] for your love and for your mercy
[2:12:18] father when we speak about the message
[2:12:20] being crushed
[2:12:22] we're not talking about the books
[2:12:25] we're not talking about the tips
[2:12:28] but the message is a very living person
[2:12:32] the man that came down
[2:12:35] on Sunset Mountain
[2:12:37] in the form of the word
[2:12:40] because that is what the Rock is
[2:12:44] and if the rock came down
[2:12:47] on this end time
[2:12:49] father it means that not only did you
[2:12:52] make a way on Calvary
[2:12:54] because when you went on Calvary
[2:12:58] you died on the cross
[2:13:00] and when you scream
[2:13:02] the veil of the temple was right
[2:13:05] from the top all the way to the bottom
[2:13:08] and you open completely the holy place
[2:13:12] the holiest to tell us that now we can
[2:13:15] enter in the secret place
[2:13:18] Hallelujah but now father in this end
[2:13:22] time
[2:13:23] not only did we only enter in the secret
[2:13:26] place but the rock came down
[2:13:29] and that crust came down
[2:13:32] now it's not only entering in into the
[2:13:36] holies but sooner we're gonna step in
[2:13:39] the rock
[2:13:41] to be taken out of this world
[2:13:43] Lord may you preserve this church
[2:13:47] from every influence
[2:13:49] of this Modern Age
[2:13:52] that is pressurizing on the young people
[2:13:55] and today it's a confusion because even
