[53:30] unless they put it on youtube quickly

[53:37] i'm going to read the roman chapter 6.
[53:40] i just failed to read this since brother
[53:42] robert was uh
[53:44] singing that song
[53:46] be identified with your sacrifice and
[53:49] talking about justification
[53:51] then sister jerusha bring in the grace
[53:55] his grace justified never done it to
[53:58] begin with that's the thanksgiving
[54:00] message
[54:03] amen
[54:05] oh my
[54:07] roman chapter
[54:09] one day lord's willing if he terry we
[54:11] will we will dig into this through the
[54:13] jordan river
[54:15] amen
[54:16] so maybe somebody will go search it
[54:20] but there is a message already we're
[54:22] just following the gps
[54:24] when he say go left we go left the first
[54:26] three
[54:27] no you're not
[54:29] but
[54:30] just a little bit
[54:31] no ye not
[54:33] i use a bazooka in
[54:35] llama
[54:38] and it works pretty good
[54:40] the microphone start acting up then they
[54:43] brought it to me like they brought jesus
[54:45] the scroll at the temple i was like
[54:48] that's it amen
[54:50] no ye not that so many of us
[54:54] as were baptized into jesus christ were
[54:59] baptized into his death
[55:03] you identify
[55:05] amen with your sacrifice verse 4
[55:08] therefore we are buried with him
[55:11] by baptism into death
[55:14] do we stay there
[55:16] he never stood there
[55:18] he had to come out and what do you think
[55:21] the dead in christ will do what
[55:25] amen
[55:26] that like as christ
[55:28] was raised up from the dead by the glory
[55:31] of the father even so we also should
[55:35] walk in units of life
[55:38] for if we have been planted
[55:40] together identification
[55:43] in the likeness of his death
[55:45] we shall be also in the likeness of his
[55:49] resurrection there is no way you can be
[55:52] identified with his death and not being
[55:54] identified with his resurrection
[55:56] amen if we were identified with his
[55:59] death automatically we are guaranteed
[56:02] that we're going to be identified with
[56:04] his resurrection
[56:06] amen
[56:07] paul continued he said in verse 6
[56:08] knowing this that our old man is
[56:12] crucified with who
[56:14] so when they were crucifying jesus
[56:16] christ guess who was inside them
[56:22] who was in jesus name
[56:25] you see
[56:27] he waited until he say it is finished
[56:32] when he say it is finished
[56:34] that's when they pierce him
[56:38] not before
[56:40] when he say it is finished that's when
[56:43] they pierce him in other words the bride
[56:46] has been living in the groom have seen
[56:49] the groom caster devil walk in the water
[56:52] doing all kinds of things and even go
[56:55] all the way to redemption when he
[56:57] finished paying the price now he's
[56:59] saying now you know what to do right now
[57:01] come out
[57:03] now i can deliver you
[57:05] [Laughter]
[57:08] the problem is spiritual amnesia
[57:10] everything is already built in you
[57:13] all it takes is the quickening power of
[57:16] the holy spirit
[57:18] once he quickens you then the program
[57:21] that christ did when he was here on
[57:23] earth automatically begin to work on you
[57:26] that's why paul said it is no longer me
[57:29] that live the life that i live right now
[57:31] i live it by the faith of the son of god
[57:43] sorry i'm not the one preaching he got
[57:45] it
[57:45] [Laughter]
[57:48] amen verse six knowing this that our old
[57:51] man is crucified with him that the body
[57:55] of sin might be destroyed that
[57:57] henceforth we should not serve sin
[58:01] but robert we free verse 7 for he that
[58:04] is dead is what
[58:06] free from water automatically jump to
[58:09] verse 8 11
[58:10] likewise reckon yourself
[58:13] also where can you also yourself to be
[58:17] dead in other words paul wants you to be
[58:19] conscious
[58:20] to to acknowledge
[58:23] that you are dead
[58:25] dead to what that sin
[58:27] he said reckon he also yourself to be
[58:30] dead indeed unto sin but a love unto god
[58:34] through jesus christ our
[58:36] lord
[58:39] now verse 12 let not water
[58:43] he's talking to who
[58:46] so
[58:47] you can let sin work or you can lock
[58:50] him.
[58:55] i'm reading the same bible right
[58:57] he said let you let not
[59:00] sin
[59:01] rain in your water so you already have
[59:05] power to control the black dog
[59:11] when esther invited haman to the banquet
[59:14] a man didn't have any
[59:16] choice he was obeying esther
[59:20] and the chamberlain were there
[59:22] to make sure him and get into the
[59:25] chariot and be carried over there
[59:27] the enforcer were there
[59:32] this world
[59:34] i don't know what to do my brother amen
[59:36] let not sin therefore when in your
[59:39] mortal body that you should obey it
[59:43] in the last water
[59:45] so you have a right to say no
[59:49] and he have nothing to do
[59:51] he has to negotiate with you
[59:54] but if you say no it means no
[1:00:01] because you are raining
[1:00:03] you are ruling
[1:00:04] you under the species of melchizedek
[1:00:07] those that were you know how you
[1:00:09] understand
[1:00:12] you under the species of melchizedek
[1:00:14] melchizedek is not only priests but he's
[1:00:17] also
[1:00:19] i'm back home

[1:07:07] and i know you are going to preach with
[1:07:09] me tonight lord
[1:07:12] amen amen
[1:07:15] but uh before that i just want to give a
[1:07:17] testimony
[1:07:19] um
[1:07:21] um it's been um i think
[1:07:24] two or three weeks ago my wife was like
[1:07:26] um
[1:07:28] she calls me babe you know
[1:07:32] she's like
[1:07:34] babe
[1:07:35] when was the last time you took your
[1:07:38] inhaler
[1:07:40] and i was like
[1:07:42] um
[1:07:43] i can't remember
[1:07:45] but
[1:07:47] maybe the first week i came to charlotte
[1:07:50] since then
[1:07:51] the lord took away that demon
[1:07:54] called amen
[1:07:58] amen
[1:07:59] so um
[1:08:03] it started way back in ghana when
[1:08:06] anytime i decide to
[1:08:08] stand on my feet to pray
[1:08:11] then this kind of wind gets into my
[1:08:13] truth
[1:08:14] and then it starts to close up my lungs
[1:08:19] so it was so hard it was so difficult
[1:08:22] and i brought it here to the states
[1:08:25] but thanks be to god
[1:08:29] that inhaler that i was taking every
[1:08:31] night
[1:08:32] is no more
[1:08:34] amen amen
[1:08:36] amen i just want to praise the lord
[1:08:39] tonight
[1:08:40] amen
[1:08:42] amen
[1:08:43] amen
[1:08:45] i wanted to talk a little bit about that
[1:08:48] but
[1:08:49] for times sake
[1:08:50] let's just go straight to the wedding
[1:08:52] man
[1:08:53] should we be outstanding even as we take
[1:08:56] uh
[1:09:00] a scripture reading from
[1:09:03] the book of hagai
[1:09:05] haggai chapter 2
[1:09:08] verse 23
[1:09:10] in fact
[1:09:11] it is
[1:09:12] a deep thing to talk about but
[1:09:15] i'm just going to brush the surface amen
[1:09:18] but lord help me tonight amen
[1:09:22] but he said
[1:09:23] the book of hakka 2 23. he said in that
[1:09:27] day said the lord of hosts
[1:09:29] will i take d o zerubbabel my servant
[1:09:33] the son of shear tale saith the lord and
[1:09:36] will make thee as a sickness
[1:09:40] for i have chosen thee said the lord of
[1:09:42] hosts amen
[1:09:44] can we be seated
[1:09:48] um
[1:09:49] my topic for tonight is
[1:09:52] we have responded to your call
[1:09:56] we have responded we are not responding
[1:09:59] but we have responded amen to your call
[1:10:01] amen
[1:10:02] and i i have a sub team the sickness of
[1:10:05] humanity
[1:10:08] the sickness of humanity amen
[1:10:12] i know um
[1:10:13] brad stevens preached on that amen
[1:10:16] and he opened my eyes to something amen
[1:10:20] so um
[1:10:22] before we come to that
[1:10:24] let's go to um the book of job
[1:10:27] job chapter 2
[1:10:36] chapter 2
[1:10:37] verses 1-8
[1:10:39] again there was a day when the sons of
[1:10:41] god came to present themselves before
[1:10:44] the lord
[1:10:45] and satan came also among them to
[1:10:47] present himself before the lord
[1:10:50] so this is the second time that he was
[1:10:52] coming
[1:10:53] and the lord said unto satan from whence
[1:10:56] cometh down
[1:10:57] and satan answered the lord and said
[1:11:00] from going to and fro in the earth and
[1:11:04] from walking up and down in it
[1:11:06] you know i listened to a sermon that
[1:11:07] brought stephen preached he said that
[1:11:10] the devil doesn't have a place to stay
[1:11:13] he's just moving to and fro
[1:11:16] amen of course he was cast he was taken
[1:11:19] out of his place so he doesn't have a
[1:11:22] place
[1:11:23] amen
[1:11:25] and the lord said unto satan has thou
[1:11:28] considered my servant joke this is the
[1:11:30] second time
[1:11:31] that there is none like him in the earth
[1:11:34] a perfect and an upright man
[1:11:37] one that feared god
[1:11:39] and as steward evil
[1:11:41] and still he hold the fastest integrity
[1:11:45] so we know that the first time god took
[1:11:47] away all the things that job had
[1:11:50] so he's saying that
[1:11:51] have you considered him again he said
[1:11:54] after all what i did to him
[1:11:56] he hold that fast his integrity
[1:11:59] although thou moves me against him
[1:12:02] to destroy him with our cross
[1:12:05] now this is the devil who was trying to
[1:12:08] fight god in heaven
[1:12:10] and the lord cast him down to earth
[1:12:12] and he didn't have a place
[1:12:15] now god is telling the devil that
[1:12:18] you the devil you moved me
[1:12:20] against my servant
[1:12:22] so this is a devil who the lord caused
[1:12:25] my enemy
[1:12:27] he calls him an evil one
[1:12:29] but he said you moved me
[1:12:32] if the devil could move god
[1:12:35] against his will how much more you the
[1:12:37] son of god
[1:12:39] that child of god who stand in prayer
[1:12:43] amen and amen
[1:12:45] he said you moved me against
[1:12:47] my servant amen he said and satan
[1:12:51] answered the lord and said
[1:12:52] skin for skin yeah
[1:12:54] all that a man have will will he give
[1:12:57] for his life
[1:12:58] but put forth thine hand now and touch
[1:13:01] his bone and his flesh and he will curse
[1:13:04] thee to that face
[1:13:06] so as
[1:13:08] we learn from
[1:13:09] what stephen preached
[1:13:12] the whole objective
[1:13:14] is for job to curse the
[1:13:16] lord and the lord said unto satan behold
[1:13:20] he is in the hand but save his life
[1:13:24] so when satan fought from the presence
[1:13:26] of the lord and smote joke with saw boys
[1:13:29] from the soul of his foot onto onto his
[1:13:32] crown
[1:13:33] and he took him
[1:13:34] a portrait to scrape himself without
[1:13:38] and he sat down among the ashes
[1:13:42] let's go to verse 11.
[1:13:45] now when job's three friends ahead of
[1:13:48] all this evil
[1:13:50] that was come upon him
[1:13:51] they came everyone from his own place
[1:13:55] elephants the terminites
[1:13:58] and builder the shoe height
[1:14:00] and sofa
[1:14:02] the pneumatics
[1:14:03] for they had made an appointment
[1:14:05] together to come to mourn with him and
[1:14:08] to comfort him
[1:14:10] they had made an appointment to come and
[1:14:12] moan with him and comfort him let's go
[1:14:14] to verse 13.
[1:14:16] so they sat down with him upon the
[1:14:18] ground seven days and seven nights
[1:14:22] and none speak a word unto him
[1:14:25] for they saw that he greet his grief was
[1:14:28] very great
[1:14:30] now let's see what happens in um three
[1:14:32] verse one
[1:14:33] after this opened up his mouth
[1:14:37] and cast his day
[1:14:41] now you have friends in the church
[1:14:45] these are
[1:14:47] let me say believers
[1:14:50] who said oh our friend is
[1:14:53] suffering
[1:14:54] so let's go visit our friends
[1:14:57] but this is the type of believers that
[1:14:59] came to job
[1:15:01] after they sat with him
[1:15:03] seven days
[1:15:06] they were showing
[1:15:08] they're trying to show to him
[1:15:10] the spirit of love
[1:15:13] but i see it as a manufactured love
[1:15:18] because there's no love
[1:15:20] that when it is shown will make somebody
[1:15:23] start to curse
[1:15:28] if a love
[1:15:30] is being shown to somebody
[1:15:32] the next thing that the person will do
[1:15:35] is to praise the name of the lord
[1:15:38] because what i believe love is
[1:15:41] is that spirit of truth
[1:15:44] that reigneth in believers
[1:15:46] so when i see you you have the spirit of
[1:15:49] truth there is a connection
[1:15:53] there is a connection between us amen so
[1:15:57] while we are speaking the next moment we
[1:16:00] are giving praise to the lord amen
[1:16:03] amen and amen
[1:16:05] amen
[1:16:07] so
[1:16:08] let's go to job chapter four amen
[1:16:13] i want to take my time but at the same
[1:16:15] time i'm looking at time
[1:16:18] then elias the terminite answered and
[1:16:22] said
[1:16:23] if we are said to commune with thee
[1:16:26] will thou be grieved
[1:16:29] if if we decide to talk with you we
[1:16:31] decide to give you advice thou be
[1:16:33] grieved
[1:16:34] but who can withhold himself from
[1:16:36] speaking
[1:16:38] now behold that has instructed many
[1:16:41] and that has strengthened the weak hands
[1:16:44] now he is giving a testimony
[1:16:47] of job
[1:16:49] that you see this is the testimony that
[1:16:51] people are giving
[1:16:53] and this testimony went straight to
[1:16:55] heaven
[1:16:57] amen
[1:16:58] and even god gave testimony of job
[1:17:01] he said that was have upholding him that
[1:17:04] was falling
[1:17:06] and thou has strengthened the feeble
[1:17:08] knees
[1:17:09] so they were saying these good things
[1:17:11] about job he life us or eliphaz was
[1:17:14] saying this good thing about job but now
[1:17:16] it has come upon thee
[1:17:19] and our faintest
[1:17:21] it touched thee
[1:17:23] and that are troubled
[1:17:26] so
[1:17:27] if i understand the scripture is saying
[1:17:30] that
[1:17:31] when people are weak
[1:17:34] and they come to your house
[1:17:36] the testimony is that
[1:17:38] they get out with joy praising the lord
[1:17:42] that's a testimony you have job
[1:17:45] but this time this same thing happens to
[1:17:47] you
[1:17:48] and you are feeble
[1:17:53] the spirit of accusation
[1:17:56] it's not this that fear
[1:17:58] thy confidence
[1:18:00] thy hope
[1:18:01] and the uprightness of thy waste
[1:18:04] remember i pray thee whoever perished
[1:18:07] being innocent
[1:18:09] now the spirit of accusation starts job
[1:18:13] who can ever get perished or whoever who
[1:18:16] can perish
[1:18:18] when he's innocent
[1:18:20] or
[1:18:21] where were the righteous cut off
[1:18:25] now i'm bringing you to the bible
[1:18:28] have you seen in the bible
[1:18:30] that somebody
[1:18:32] perished
[1:18:34] that we call a righteous man
[1:18:38] amen even as i have seen
[1:18:42] they'd applaud iniquity and so
[1:18:44] wickedness
[1:18:45] reaped the same
[1:18:47] by the blast of god
[1:18:49] they perish
[1:18:51] and by the breadth of his nostrils are
[1:18:53] they consumed
[1:18:56] he was intellectually
[1:18:58] inclined
[1:19:00] with the word of the lord
[1:19:02] the roaring of the lion and the voice of
[1:19:04] the fierce lion and the teeth of the
[1:19:06] young lions are broken
[1:19:09] all right let's go on
[1:19:11] the old lion perished for lack of prey
[1:19:13] and the start lions wells are scattered
[1:19:17] abroad
[1:19:18] now a thing was secretly brought to me
[1:19:21] okay so now he's telling joke
[1:19:24] that something secretly came to me
[1:19:29] and my ear received a little thereof
[1:19:33] a false vision amen in thoughts from the
[1:19:37] visions of the night
[1:19:39] when deep sleep fallen on men
[1:19:42] fear came upon me and trembling
[1:19:45] which made all my bones to shake
[1:19:49] so he's trying to tell joke that
[1:19:51] he
[1:19:52] he he had a vision
[1:19:55] and and that vision put fear in him
[1:19:59] then a spirit passed before my face
[1:20:03] the air of my flesh stood up
[1:20:07] it stood still but i could not discern
[1:20:10] the form thereof
[1:20:11] an image was before my eyes
[1:20:14] there was silence and i had a voice
[1:20:16] saying shall mortal men
[1:20:19] be more just than god
[1:20:23] shall a man be more pure
[1:20:26] than his maker
[1:20:29] behold all right so that's the question
[1:20:32] he put to job
[1:20:35] shall you a man
[1:20:38] be more pure
[1:20:40] than your maker
[1:20:43] but the lord gave testimony of job
[1:20:46] that he was perfect
[1:20:50] behold now he went on to behold he put
[1:20:53] no trust in his servants
[1:20:55] and his angels he charged with foley
[1:21:00] how much less in them that dwell in
[1:21:02] houses of clay
[1:21:04] now this is the spirit of accusation
[1:21:07] he said whose foundation is in the dust
[1:21:10] which are crushed before the moth
[1:21:14] so he's talking about the fact that
[1:21:17] even the angels
[1:21:19] cannot stand before god
[1:21:22] so how much more you and mortal men
[1:21:26] but this evening we want to remind elias
[1:21:30] that in the book of genesis 1 26 and 27
[1:21:34] he said
[1:21:35] let us make man
[1:21:37] in our own image
[1:21:40] amen so god already had in his mind
[1:21:45] to make man equal with him
[1:21:48] now the spirit of accusation comes
[1:21:51] and says that you man how can you make
[1:21:54] yourself god
[1:22:00] amen
[1:22:04] now i just want us to look at um
[1:22:07] something in genesis 36
[1:22:11] yes
[1:22:12] genesis 36
[1:22:18] but abraham said something
[1:22:20] that the book of job was the first book
[1:22:23] to be written in the bible
[1:22:26] amen
[1:22:29] sometimes
[1:22:31] when the lord does not open your eyes to
[1:22:33] some of these things
[1:22:35] you'll be like
[1:22:36] what is he talking about
[1:22:39] amen
[1:22:40] genesis 36
[1:22:42] 1-4
[1:22:44] now these are the generations of esau
[1:22:47] who is edom
[1:22:49] eso took his wives of the daughters of
[1:22:52] canaan
[1:22:53] ada the daughter of elon the hittites
[1:22:57] and a holy bomber the daughter of anna
[1:23:00] the daughter of zebian
[1:23:02] the hivite
[1:23:04] and bashmat ishmael's daughter sister of
[1:23:08] neighborhood
[1:23:09] another bear to israel elijah's or
[1:23:12] elephants
[1:23:14] now we are looking at elephants
[1:23:16] who came to job
[1:23:20] and bechama bear rail
[1:23:22] all right so let's go to um verse 10 to
[1:23:25] 12.
[1:23:27] these are the names of israel's sons
[1:23:30] elephants the son of ada
[1:23:33] the wife of esau
[1:23:35] wrote the son of
[1:23:37] vaishma the wife of israel and the sons
[1:23:40] of elephants were 10 months
[1:23:42] now when we read
[1:23:44] in the book of job
[1:23:46] chapter four
[1:23:48] the bible says
[1:23:50] elephants
[1:23:52] was a terminate
[1:23:54] now in eleven we see the connection of
[1:23:57] elephants in tehran terma was his son
[1:24:00] so in other words we are tracing
[1:24:03] elephants
[1:24:04] to esau
[1:24:10] we are tracing elephants to israel
[1:24:13] now we want to look at the spirits in
[1:24:15] israel
[1:24:17] let's go to hebrews chapter 12.
[1:24:31] hebrews chapter 12 let's
[1:24:34] start from verse 13.
[1:24:36] he said that make straight paths for
[1:24:38] your feet
[1:24:40] let's that which is
[1:24:41] lame be turned out of the way
[1:24:44] but let it rather be healed
[1:24:46] follow peace with all men and holiness
[1:24:50] without which no man shall see the lord
[1:24:53] looking diligently
[1:24:55] lest any man feel of the grace of god
[1:24:59] lest any root of bitterness
[1:25:02] springing up trouble you
[1:25:04] and thereby many be developed
[1:25:11] the root of bitterness
[1:25:13] defiles men
[1:25:15] now verse 16 said lest there be any
[1:25:18] fornicator
[1:25:20] or profane person
[1:25:21] as eso
[1:25:24] who for one muscle of meat sold his
[1:25:26] birthright
[1:25:29] so paul is saying
[1:25:32] that esau
[1:25:34] is a profane man
[1:25:36] he's a fornicator
[1:25:38] why because the root of bitterness came
[1:25:40] into israel
[1:25:43] and because of that
[1:25:45] he lost his birthright
[1:25:49] now what i believe birthright
[1:25:52] is
[1:25:54] is the inheritance
[1:25:56] of the lord jesus christ
[1:25:59] so in exodus chapter 3 verse 6
[1:26:05] when god was talking to moses
[1:26:09] he started
[1:26:11] the god of abraham
[1:26:13] the god of isaac
[1:26:16] so after isaac we should expect esau
[1:26:20] but who got that inheritance
[1:26:23] jacob
[1:26:25] so esau missed that inheritance and i
[1:26:28] believe that that inheritance is the god
[1:26:32] of jacob
[1:26:34] that esau missed
[1:26:36] amen
[1:26:38] and paul called him a profane man
[1:26:40] because of the root of bitterness
[1:26:43] the spirit of jealousy that comes in the
[1:26:46] people that made them to miss god
[1:26:54] amen
[1:26:57] let's go back
[1:26:59] to her guy
[1:27:01] 223
[1:27:04] our topic for tonight we have responded
[1:27:06] to your call
[1:27:07] the signet of humanity
[1:27:10] haggai 223
[1:27:18] now before that
[1:27:19] i'll read a quote from the prophet
[1:27:22] the super sign
[1:27:28] he said oh god
[1:27:30] if the world could only see that
[1:27:33] that god and man are one
[1:27:37] the super sign was that first man that
[1:27:40] god could come into
[1:27:43] all that god was
[1:27:45] he brought into christ
[1:27:47] and all christ was he poured into the
[1:27:49] church
[1:27:50] super sign
[1:27:52] god and man together
[1:27:54] that was to be the super sign of the
[1:27:57] last day
[1:27:58] when the entire bible was to be
[1:28:00] fulfilled in the last days
[1:28:02] a super sign
[1:28:04] a virgin shall conceive
[1:28:06] and this conception
[1:28:08] when it's brought forth will be god
[1:28:11] manifested in the flesh a super sign
[1:28:15] they still don't believe it
[1:28:17] but a worse anyhow
[1:28:19] it's still a super sign
[1:28:21] notice super sign they've got superman
[1:28:25] today they got fictions of superman all
[1:28:28] these other kind of super things but the
[1:28:31] church has got a super sign
[1:28:33] god back in the church
[1:28:35] manifested in human flesh
[1:28:38] god united with men
[1:28:40] his sure super sign
[1:28:43] amen
[1:28:45] let's go to haggai 223
[1:28:51] so accusation of elaphas or elephants
[1:28:55] was that can you a man
[1:28:58] make yourself
[1:29:00] can you compare yourself to god
[1:29:03] that was accusation
[1:29:09] now i read again from the prophet
[1:29:14] amen
[1:29:18] show us the father
[1:29:20] and it will satisfy us
[1:29:25] he said
[1:29:26] the prophet is saying job begin to
[1:29:29] wonder why that man laid down and he
[1:29:32] didn't rise up
[1:29:33] so job was was thinking why why would a
[1:29:36] man die and will not rise up
[1:29:38] he didn't see him come up in the spring
[1:29:41] but he seen the flower come up in the
[1:29:43] spring
[1:29:44] well then
[1:29:45] when
[1:29:46] elihu came to him
[1:29:48] and began to speak to him
[1:29:51] he said
[1:29:52] now look
[1:29:53] job
[1:29:55] you are accusing god wrong
[1:29:57] he said now look
[1:30:00] that flower has not
[1:30:02] has not sinked
[1:30:04] it stands right in the way that god made
[1:30:06] it
[1:30:07] and it reproduces itself right back from
[1:30:10] there to resurrection
[1:30:11] death to resurrection all right he said
[1:30:14] now but man sinned
[1:30:16] and that separated him from god and
[1:30:18] resurrection so he said but there's
[1:30:21] coming a just one
[1:30:25] this is my point but it's coming at just
[1:30:27] one amen there's coming one who will
[1:30:30] stand in the bridge
[1:30:32] for this sinner that will put his hand
[1:30:36] on a sinful man and a holy god and
[1:30:39] breached away
[1:30:44] he said oh my
[1:30:46] job noticed it he was a prophet
[1:30:49] satan on the ash heap
[1:30:51] he got up
[1:30:53] shook himself
[1:30:54] he'd been scrapping his voice
[1:30:57] and he got up and shook himself and said
[1:30:59] i know my redeemer leave it
[1:31:02] so sometimes certain companies certain
[1:31:05] friends certain church members that
[1:31:07] comes to you they come with a different
[1:31:09] kind of message that will lift you up
[1:31:12] from the from the grave amen
[1:31:16] and who be speaking amen the things of
[1:31:18] the lord
[1:31:20] amen and amen now compare these friends
[1:31:24] those three friends that came to job
[1:31:27] they made him cast that day he was born
[1:31:31] but this one
[1:31:33] the prophet called him a type of christ
[1:31:37] he came amen
[1:31:39] and job was caught up in the spirit of
[1:31:41] resurrection
[1:31:43] [Laughter]
[1:31:46] amen amen
[1:31:49] amen
[1:31:50] amen
[1:31:52] brah stephen said
[1:31:53] in one of his preaching
[1:31:56] that
[1:31:57] depending on how you look at god or what
[1:32:00] connection you have with god
[1:32:02] what you are requesting with god how you
[1:32:04] see him
[1:32:05] whether you you know him to be a god of
[1:32:07] resurrection or
[1:32:09] a healer
[1:32:10] amen
[1:32:11] that is the manifestation that you are
[1:32:13] going to see
[1:32:15] so job was
[1:32:17] almost
[1:32:19] i would say that he was dead amen
[1:32:22] because everything was taken off
[1:32:25] he was down nothing was going on
[1:32:28] but a spirit of truth
[1:32:31] when the spirit of truth cometh
[1:32:33] it comes in the power of resurrection
[1:32:38] amen amen let's go back to haggai 2 23.
[1:32:44] amen
[1:32:46] in that day said the lord of hosts
[1:32:49] will i take d o zerubbabel my servant
[1:32:53] the son of shuttle
[1:32:54] said the lord and will make thee as a
[1:32:57] signet
[1:32:59] for have chosen thee said the lord of
[1:33:01] hosts
[1:33:02] now we understand that signet stands for
[1:33:05] authority
[1:33:08] so god is saying that
[1:33:11] you a human being
[1:33:13] standing right before me
[1:33:15] when people see you they are looking at
[1:33:18] the authority of the most high
[1:33:23] accusation was that
[1:33:26] how can you
[1:33:27] compare yourself
[1:33:29] to god
[1:33:31] but the lord comes down and says
[1:33:34] zerubbabel you a human
[1:33:37] when they see you
[1:33:39] they'll see the authority of the most
[1:33:41] high
[1:33:42] and i understand in this last days that
[1:33:45] there stood a man and said that key
[1:33:48] short fitted
[1:33:50] in my hand
[1:33:55] i hope you are catching it tonight amen
[1:33:59] amen
[1:34:01] so now
[1:34:03] we look at something from
[1:34:07] ha guy
[1:34:08] one verse one
[1:34:11] something happened in our time
[1:34:14] and um
[1:34:16] i just want to talk a little about it
[1:34:18] amen
[1:34:21] hagar one verse one he said in the
[1:34:24] second year of darius the king
[1:34:29] so let's let's keep it in the second
[1:34:32] year of darius
[1:34:33] the king
[1:34:35] so we know it's in the second year
[1:34:38] if i could borrow
[1:34:40] a brother's mark
[1:34:42] [Laughter]
[1:34:47] all right
[1:34:48] in the second year
[1:34:54] all right
[1:34:57] so we go to
[1:35:01] haggai 2 verse 10
[1:35:05] haggai chapter 2 verse 10
[1:35:10] in the fourth and 20th day of the ninth
[1:35:13] month
[1:35:16] so that means the 24th day
[1:35:20] in the ninth month
[1:35:41] 24th day
[1:35:42] in the ninth month
[1:35:45] so in the second year of kendarius
[1:35:48] in the ninth month on the 24th day
[1:35:51] amen so let's go to
[1:35:53] verse 18.
[1:35:57] verse 18 chapter 2 verse 18 it says
[1:36:00] consider now from this day
[1:36:03] and upward
[1:36:04] from the 4th and 20th day of the 9th
[1:36:07] month
[1:36:08] even from the date that the foundation
[1:36:10] of the lord's temple was lit
[1:36:12] consider it
[1:36:15] the lord is saying
[1:36:17] let us consider this day
[1:36:22] back to 23.
[1:36:27] in that day
[1:36:29] said the lord of hosts
[1:36:31] will i pick d o zerubbabel
[1:36:34] my seventh
[1:36:35] the son of shithel
[1:36:37] saith the lord and will make thee as a
[1:36:40] sickness
[1:36:41] for i have chosen thee saith the lord of
[1:36:43] hosts
[1:36:46] so the lord is saying let us consider
[1:36:49] consider a day
[1:36:52] 24th day
[1:36:53] in the ninth month in the second year of
[1:36:56] the reign of darius
[1:36:58] and we see that during the time of
[1:37:00] darius
[1:37:02] sudden things happened
[1:37:04] they wanted to build a temple
[1:37:06] and then um
[1:37:07] before darius came a king came and they
[1:37:10] tried to trouble zerubbabel
[1:37:13] and and the jews
[1:37:16] was we're trying to rebuild the temple
[1:37:18] amen but when darius came
[1:37:21] he went back
[1:37:23] to the decree that was already given by
[1:37:26] king sarios
[1:37:28] cyrus a man
[1:37:29] that
[1:37:31] let this people build this temple unto
[1:37:33] the lord
[1:37:35] amen
[1:37:36] now
[1:37:38] i'm just typing something
[1:37:43] we know
[1:37:48] that israel
[1:37:52] was back in their homeland or it became
[1:37:54] a nation
[1:37:56] in may
[1:37:58] 1948
[1:38:05] is that true
[1:38:06] all right 1948
[1:38:12] so may 1948
[1:38:14] to may
[1:38:17] 1949
[1:38:18] is one year
[1:38:22] now we get to the second year
[1:38:26] so may
[1:38:27] one
[1:38:31] june
[1:38:33] july
[1:38:36] august
[1:38:38] september
[1:38:41] october
[1:38:43] november
[1:38:45] december
[1:38:47] january
[1:38:48] we are in the ninth month
[1:38:53] one two three four five six seven eight
[1:38:55] nine
[1:39:00] so when we get to january
[1:39:03] we are now in which year
[1:39:08] 1950
[1:39:12] 24 january
[1:39:15] 1950
[1:39:19] when there was a controversy
[1:39:23] about the
[1:39:24] preaching of the seventh
[1:39:27] messenger
[1:39:32] they brought the pillar of fire brought
[1:39:34] him to the pulpit
[1:39:37] and we know what happened
[1:39:39] they took the picture
[1:39:43] the bible said
[1:39:44] in this day
[1:39:47] said the lord of hosts
[1:39:49] will i take d or zerubbabel my seven
[1:39:52] the son of shithill
[1:39:54] saith the lord and will make thee as a
[1:39:57] signet
[1:39:58] for our chosen bee see the lord of hosts
[1:40:07] [Music]
[1:40:08] i don't know if you are connecting
[1:40:10] something tonight
[1:40:12] so our message
[1:40:14] in this day
[1:40:16] the lord has vindicated
[1:40:18] that i am calling a bright
[1:40:20] and this bride is going to be my
[1:40:23] authority
[1:40:26] and he vindicated it
[1:40:28] in the leader of the dispensation
[1:40:32] according to what he has said in his own
[1:40:35] word
[1:40:39] steven was preaching last time
[1:40:41] he said zerubbabel
[1:40:44] typed
[1:40:46] the prophet
[1:40:48] but the prophet
[1:40:50] does not move alone he moves with the
[1:40:53] high priest
[1:40:56] so zerubbabel was moving with a high
[1:40:59] priest
[1:41:00] now we have
[1:41:03] in january 24 1950
[1:41:06] a type of zerubbabel
[1:41:08] standing
[1:41:09] and the high priest
[1:41:11] coming down to vindicate that this is my
[1:41:15] authority in this last days and the
[1:41:18] prophet said that the hope is that the
[1:41:21] picture was not taken because of me he
[1:41:23] said the picture was taken because of
[1:41:25] you and i so that we can know who we
[1:41:28] have
[1:41:36] amen
[1:41:40] amen
[1:41:45] thank you lord jesus
[1:41:52] the segment of humanity
[1:41:57] amen
[1:41:59] now we saw in the book of job
[1:42:02] that satan
[1:42:04] went to god
[1:42:08] he went to god
[1:42:10] and moved god
[1:42:12] against his own servant
[1:42:14] now god is saying to us in this last
[1:42:17] days that i have called you as my
[1:42:20] authority now if satan who is the enemy
[1:42:23] of god
[1:42:24] goes to god and move him against his
[1:42:27] perfect one how much more you and i that
[1:42:30] he said you are my authority
[1:42:37] amen amen
[1:42:40] amen
[1:42:42] we bless the name of the lord
[1:42:45] i want to take a reading from the
[1:42:46] prophet
[1:42:48] without a prophet we have no message
[1:42:50] amen
[1:42:52] without the prophet we have no message
[1:42:54] in fact i was blessed with that mystery
[1:42:57] of sea of glass amen
[1:43:00] amen
[1:43:02] we have a sea of glass amen
[1:43:05] that is manifesting
[1:43:07] one two three four five six seven
[1:43:15] when the soviet sea was opened
[1:43:17] amen that was harsh in heaven
[1:43:21] and we came to realize
[1:43:24] that when the servant angel came the
[1:43:27] lord said i have nothing for you when he
[1:43:30] came to his time he said i have nothing
[1:43:31] for you
[1:43:34] amen
[1:43:36] so the question is so what is my message
[1:43:40] he said the message
[1:43:42] is already with you
[1:43:45] so in the seventh message
[1:43:49] it's a combination of one two three four
[1:43:51] five six in actual fact the seven
[1:43:54] message is one
[1:43:56] and all
[1:43:57] right so that is why you will find
[1:44:00] people ministers who try to preach their
[1:44:02] message and they are preaching just
[1:44:04] message one
[1:44:07] they are preaching message two
[1:44:09] they are preaching message three why
[1:44:11] because it is a total of all these
[1:44:14] messages that is put in the seventh
[1:44:17] message
[1:44:20] amen
[1:44:21] amen
[1:44:22] so um i was so blessed amen i was so
[1:44:26] blessed without preaching
[1:44:27] i want to read something here
[1:44:31] the prophet said show us the father and
[1:44:33] it suffices
[1:44:36] it's about notice
[1:44:38] when a man is hungering
[1:44:41] and thirsting for god
[1:44:43] god will draw nigh to the man always
[1:44:47] see he said give up surrender your will
[1:44:51] to god
[1:44:52] so then when his church members came
[1:44:55] he's talking about job
[1:44:56] now when his church members came and
[1:44:58] could not console him
[1:45:00] accuse him to being a secret sinner
[1:45:03] said he is sin before god
[1:45:05] job knew he had not seen
[1:45:07] and he knew he was all right
[1:45:10] but then god sent a young man down by
[1:45:13] the name of elihu
[1:45:15] came down to me job
[1:45:16] perfect type of christ again
[1:45:18] he didn't accuse job of being a secret
[1:45:21] sinner
[1:45:22] he tried to tell him of someone who
[1:45:24] could come and stand in the bridge in
[1:45:28] the last days
[1:45:29] to put his hands upon a sinful man and
[1:45:32] upon the holy god and breach the way
[1:45:37] we have that same god
[1:45:40] that has vindicated
[1:45:42] his message in this last days
[1:45:45] breaching the gap between sinful man
[1:45:48] and the holy god
[1:45:51] so that we can stand before god without
[1:45:54] authority amen
[1:45:55] amen i believe i'm speaking to somebody
[1:45:58] tonight amen
[1:45:59] amen
[1:46:02] without this prophet message we have no
[1:46:04] message amen
[1:46:08] now i'm reading from zechariah chapter
[1:46:10] 14 6 7.
[1:46:18] amen and amen
[1:46:27] when brad steven called me
[1:46:29] he said we want to
[1:46:31] listen to your channel amen
[1:46:33] so this is a new channel amen
[1:46:35] [Laughter]
[1:46:37] this is a new channel we have to get
[1:46:39] used to it amen
[1:46:41] amen
[1:46:43] zechariah 14 6 and 7
[1:46:48] and it shall come to pass in that day
[1:46:51] that the light shall not be cleared nor
[1:46:53] dark
[1:46:55] but it shall be one day we shall be
[1:46:57] known to the lord
[1:46:59] not day nor night
[1:47:02] the spirit of laodicea
[1:47:04] it is not there it is not night
[1:47:07] the lukewarm spirit
[1:47:09] but he said but it shall come to pass
[1:47:12] that at the evening time it shall be
[1:47:15] light we've been promised
[1:47:18] that in this day
[1:47:19] that light of the maker will come back
[1:47:23] to breach
[1:47:25] the sinful man with the holy god
[1:47:30] amen amen
[1:47:31] and that is a promise to you and i
[1:47:33] tonight
[1:47:34] and he said we have responded to your
[1:47:36] call the sickness of humanity
[1:47:42] amen amen
[1:47:45] now let's look at something
[1:47:49] when those three friends of job
[1:47:54] came to him
[1:47:58] they didn't eat right
[1:48:00] they sat with him for seven days they
[1:48:02] didn't eat
[1:48:06] but
[1:48:08] in the book of genesis 18
[1:48:12] we see a difference
[1:48:14] that three people came to
[1:48:16] this same prophet the type of a prophet
[1:48:20] and what did he do he came to eat
[1:48:26] so it means that
[1:48:28] our promise in this last day
[1:48:31] when we still have three people
[1:48:33] coming to a generation
[1:48:36] of darkness a generation that is dead
[1:48:41] he comes with food
[1:48:46] amen amen
[1:48:48] he comes with an open book
[1:48:53] amen amen it is an open book that is
[1:48:57] full to the bride my wife was like when
[1:48:59] we came back from um
[1:49:01] the meetings i don't feel like eating
[1:49:04] because i've been filled
[1:49:06] amen and that's the kind of fruit that
[1:49:09] the lord has brought to us in this last
[1:49:10] days
[1:49:12] to feast with a king
[1:49:14] amen and amen it is not coming to to to
[1:49:18] to fast to to to to grieve our spirit so
[1:49:22] that we start cursing the dead that we
[1:49:24] were born we start casting the time that
[1:49:27] we sinned or we started kissing when we
[1:49:30] were in the world but when he came to us
[1:49:33] he came with an open book
[1:49:35] that we should say
[1:49:37] oh lord we are justified
[1:49:40] thank you lord jesus
[1:49:44] amen amen
[1:49:46] amen
[1:49:47] we bless the name of the lord
[1:49:49] we just want to close with this i know
[1:49:52] i'm not talking ah i don't want to take
[1:49:54] your time man amen and amen

[1:50:27] he said hear o my son
[1:50:30] and receive my sayings
[1:50:32] and the years of their life shall be
[1:50:35] many
[1:50:36] i have taught thee in the way of wisdom
[1:50:40] in fact we have the spirit of wisdom in
[1:50:42] this church
[1:50:44] that the lord is using to teach us
[1:50:48] he said i have thought thee in the way
[1:50:49] of wisdom
[1:50:51] i have led thee in right paths
[1:50:54] when thou growers
[1:50:56] thy steps shall not be straightened
[1:50:59] and when they are runnest
[1:51:01] that shall not stumble
[1:51:03] take fast hold of instruction let her
[1:51:06] not go
[1:51:08] keep her
[1:51:09] for she eats their life
[1:51:12] enter not into the part of the wicked
[1:51:14] and go not in the way of evil men
[1:51:18] enter not into the part of those friends
[1:51:21] that came to job
[1:51:23] said avoid it
[1:51:25] pass not by it turn from it and pass
[1:51:28] away
[1:51:29] for this for the sleep not
[1:51:32] except they have done mischief
[1:51:34] and their sleep is taken away unless
[1:51:37] they cross some to fall
[1:51:40] for they eat the bread of wickedness
[1:51:43] and drink their wine of violence
[1:51:45] but they're part of the just is as the
[1:51:48] shining light
[1:51:49] that shineth more and more onto the
[1:51:51] perfect day
[1:51:52] the part of the just is a shining light
[1:51:55] that shineth more and more it is a
[1:51:58] revelation of a revelation upon
[1:52:00] revelation until we get onto that
[1:52:03] perfect day amen so the way of the
[1:52:06] wicked is as darkness
[1:52:08] they know not at what they stumble
[1:52:11] they know not what they are talking
[1:52:13] about
[1:52:14] they stumble at it they don't know what

[1:53:14] amen
[1:53:15] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:53:18] the three friends of job
[1:53:20] that came first
[1:53:22] they were like they were helping job and
[1:53:24] before that they begin to
[1:53:27] complain
[1:53:28] and bringing even a false vision
[1:53:32] and accusing job not even knowing what
[1:53:35] is going on amen
[1:53:37] but thank god we have illahu he comes
[1:53:40] always a little bit toward the end
[1:53:43] amen and brother brother i'm saying
[1:53:45] was a type of coup
[1:53:47] the top of christ amen
[1:53:50] and i love this scripture that he
[1:53:52] finished with in genesis chapter 4
[1:53:55] in proverbs chapter 4 verse 18 he said
[1:53:58] but the path of the just
[1:54:00] is as the shining light
[1:54:04] that shattereth more and more onto the
[1:54:08] perfect day
[1:54:10] in other words it's a revelation that
[1:54:12] keeps unfolding unfolding unfolding
[1:54:16] until the perfect day when this body is
[1:54:19] going to be changed and will be
[1:54:22] translated from mortal to immortality
[1:54:25] and for those that was under corruption
[1:54:28] to incorruption in other words we have
[1:54:30] we have been changed as we're looking at
[1:54:33] that image we have been changed from
[1:54:35] glory
[1:54:36] to glory from light to light to life
[1:54:38] before you know it one of this day we
[1:54:40] will feel the change coming up
[1:54:43] amen
[1:54:44] blessed be the name of the lord we have
[1:54:47] received a message
[1:54:48] amen and that message is certain
[1:54:52] hallelujah i was uh i mentioned even
[1:54:55] something
[1:54:56] probably i was talking to my wife and i
[1:54:58] mentioned that in ohio i say the devil
[1:55:01] what he did to eve he belittled his
[1:55:03] weapon
[1:55:04] amen
[1:55:06] he just took his weapon and belittled
[1:55:08] him
[1:55:09] until you take your weapon and put it
[1:55:11] down
[1:55:12] amen god told him not to do it that was
[1:55:15] the best weapon ever but the devil
[1:55:18] showed him that that was the wrong one
[1:55:20] he should use a different one
[1:55:22] amen
[1:55:23] there is no way you can switch or flip
[1:55:25] this message if you flip it you do
[1:55:28] because there is nothing that can
[1:55:30] withstand the forces of laudisha
[1:55:33] but the message of brother branham amen
[1:55:35] if somebody depart from it just watch
[1:55:38] their life you're going to see what is
[1:55:39] happening it is telling you that the
[1:55:41] restraint has been taken off before you
[1:55:43] know it back to paint back to high heel
[1:55:46] back to this back to this there's no
[1:55:47] restraint because they have left the
[1:55:50] weapon amen it is our protection
[1:55:53] which is the message of brother branham
[1:55:55] amen
[1:55:56] i'm going to read the maid one of the
[1:55:58] court then we will call brad kelem
[1:56:01] it's on the message uh
[1:56:04] it's in the message for him will i
[1:56:07] accept
[1:56:09] in 1952 on july 18th
[1:56:13] paragraph 19 what about i'm saying that
[1:56:15] is praying one for the other
[1:56:18] the value of prayer
[1:56:20] now this counselor talking about the
[1:56:23] three friends
[1:56:24] he said this counselor that had come
[1:56:27] down and said before job
[1:56:30] that is the oldest book in the bible
[1:56:34] the book of job is the oldest book in
[1:56:37] the bible and brother branham said
[1:56:40] joe believed along the time of nimrod
[1:56:44] and back in there
[1:56:46] somewhere down from seth
[1:56:49] to adam
[1:56:51] amen
[1:56:52] so the genealogy of job goes all the way
[1:56:56] to the time of nimrod
[1:56:58] amen
[1:56:58] so the early phase that was in the book
[1:57:01] of esau that one came later but job was
[1:57:04] way before that amen
[1:57:07] but blessed be the name of the lord we
[1:57:09] got a message
[1:57:10] and you need to have good friends
[1:57:12] friend that can come to you and lift you
[1:57:15] up
[1:57:16] not friend that come to you and put you
[1:57:18] down
[1:57:19] and bring you down like okay this is
[1:57:21] what we told you how can you sit seven
[1:57:23] days with somebody pretending that
[1:57:26] you're feeling them and then before you
[1:57:27] know it you begin to condemn them
[1:57:30] like have you seen anybody suffering
[1:57:32] like you and not being uh having not
[1:57:34] done something wrong toward god that is
[1:57:37] not the case you were not even it was
[1:57:39] even better for you to stay brother
[1:57:41] branham say when you go visit somebody
[1:57:44] who's sick
[1:57:46] do not tell him how bad he is
[1:57:49] you need that coach you tell me
[1:57:51] you ask me brother brandon say when you
[1:57:53] go visit somebody who's sick or somebody
[1:57:55] who's going through a trial don't even
[1:57:57] mention that
[1:57:59] amen
[1:58:00] talk about the things that can lift that
[1:58:02] person up
[1:58:03] because from one company he can curse
[1:58:06] the day that he was born but when
[1:58:08] another company come then he begin to
[1:58:10] see the resurrection
[1:58:12] so when somebody is down you need to
[1:58:14] find someone who can lift you up
[1:58:17] amen
[1:58:18] i thought i was preaching in ohio i say
[1:58:21] and i mentioned something i say
[1:58:23] if you notice jesus
[1:58:25] they hire people
[1:58:28] to tell lies on him
[1:58:30] and the high priest inquired him
[1:58:33] to respond according to the lies and the
[1:58:36] bible says jesus never spoke anything
[1:58:39] in other words when what
[1:58:41] the people are accusing you is not the
[1:58:44] truth
[1:58:45] you don't have to answer anything
[1:58:48] you don't have to post stuff on facebook
[1:58:52] because sometimes people post stuff on
[1:58:54] facebook and you can tell they are in
[1:58:56] war with someone
[1:58:58] you don't have to post stuff on facebook
[1:59:00] like the lord is the one seeing that no
[1:59:04] you don't have to do that
[1:59:06] all i'm caring is my god knows what is
[1:59:09] truth
[1:59:10] i have seen people doing things one one
[1:59:13] thing today and they repent after three
[1:59:15] years
[1:59:16] amen
[1:59:19] and the bible say carefully ask him do
[1:59:21] you respond to this jesus was quiet
[1:59:24] because i don't have to pay attention to
[1:59:25] that but when the high priest asked him
[1:59:28] are you the king of the jews then jesus
[1:59:31] opened his mouth now you asking me about
[1:59:34] the things that belongs to me now i can
[1:59:37] talk to you amen in other words you
[1:59:39] don't have to be answering to people on
[1:59:43] things that are false you false accusing
[1:59:46] you just leave it alone
[1:59:49] remember take god place god between you
[1:59:51] and them
[1:59:52] and keep on your road and keep moving
[1:59:55] you don't have to answer them on
[1:59:57] instagram on facebook on whatsapp leave
[2:00:00] them alone you wasting your time
[2:00:03] amen
[2:00:04] paul one day was uh
[2:00:07] had a shipwreck
[2:00:09] in the island of uh what is the name
[2:00:12] again brother robert
[2:00:14] malta yes
[2:00:16] now a prophet vindicated like paul have
[2:00:19] a shipwreck
[2:00:21] what are you gonna say maybe paul did
[2:00:23] something wrong in his life
[2:00:25] but god already gave him a revelation
[2:00:27] that the sheep will wreck but nobody
[2:00:29] will die you didn't have that portion of
[2:00:31] the revelation all you saw is something
[2:00:34] happened to them an accident happened to
[2:00:36] them you don't know even the
[2:00:38] interpretation of the accident amen
[2:00:41] and what happened paul came out
[2:00:43] was going to get the wood to warm up
[2:00:45] what happened
[2:00:47] a snake bit him
[2:00:48] the bible says the people look and they
[2:00:50] say
[2:00:52] voila
[2:00:53] that's it
[2:00:54] so even though he got spare over there
[2:00:57] still his sin is following him this one
[2:01:00] could be a higher order of a murderer
[2:01:03] that's why he must die and everybody was
[2:01:05] waiting to see him boom then they say
[2:01:08] you see
[2:01:09] he always pay back
[2:01:11] but paul
[2:01:12] knowing
[2:01:13] that they told him he must compare
[2:01:15] before caesar and he knew that the
[2:01:18] accusation was false the jews were moved
[2:01:21] by envy
[2:01:22] he just took that mamba
[2:01:25] that snake
[2:01:27] that snake from facebook
[2:01:30] that snake that is beating you from
[2:01:32] instagram
[2:01:33] just shake it up
[2:01:35] put it in a fire
[2:01:37] and what did he do he never even stopped
[2:01:40] to watch that snake being cooked in the
[2:01:42] fire
[2:01:43] he turned around and continued doing
[2:01:45] what he was doing it was the people that
[2:01:48] changed their testimony after watching
[2:01:51] paul for a while
[2:01:54] they say how did he survive destroyer
[2:01:57] because he told me when i go through the
[2:02:00] water it's not gonna submerge me when i
[2:02:02] go to fire it's not gonna burn me
[2:02:05] regardless of what is coming on my way
[2:02:08] i'm gonna make it all the way
[2:02:14] all the way i am going all the way
[2:02:18] i will see you until the day of my
[2:02:21] redemption
[2:02:25] amen there is nothing that's going to
[2:02:27] stop me
[2:02:29] nothing
[2:02:30] nothing nothing you gotta know what is
[2:02:33] going on
[2:02:35] amen
[2:02:37] i gave a testimony we were looking for a
[2:02:39] luggage
[2:02:40] to carry to ohio
[2:02:42] amen
[2:02:44] we were looking for one and we only have
[2:02:47] one we traveled with that for maybe two
[2:02:49] three years
[2:02:51] and he had a lock with a combination
[2:02:53] we forgot the combination my wife forgot
[2:02:56] it her sister forgot it nobody remember
[2:02:59] we tried for years trying to open that
[2:03:01] log try this one change this one this

[2:03:05] left it alone now we got to go to ohio

[2:03:11] and my wife said try one two three
[2:03:16] before i even go there she gave me the
[2:03:18] code
[2:03:19] she said try this this this
[2:03:22] i just took the cone

[2:03:41] that code
