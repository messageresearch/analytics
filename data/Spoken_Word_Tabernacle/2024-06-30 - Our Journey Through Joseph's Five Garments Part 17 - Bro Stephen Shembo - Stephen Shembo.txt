uh brother set sister Aros reception then we got the children getting ready to go back to school and all of that so we plan to push everything toward uh August so young men meeting August young Sisters Meeting August question and answer will be August the 24th yes today we dealt with a wonderful question I wish everybody was there if you were not there you ask those that were there so we learn how to discipline our children if you are not there yesterday ask those that were there and we clearly stated and uh established the difference between abuse and correction correction is in the word of God abuse is what we don't want that's not in the word of God Amen if you take correction away from a home then you're going to get in trouble I gave you quot after coat after coat of BR Bram yesterday amen usually on our question and answer this is when we give you a report as far as the construction the building fund and what's going on I believe those that were there would clear stated what we going through and we told you about the air conditioning so be patient with us we already bought the whole unit the unit is already in Charlotte a brand new one so we are preparing for the duck which I gave you the amount do you remember the M yesterday who who who remember that how much was it you can say it from there I won't say it here because I'm on YouTube M uhhuh you heard the amount and after the service yesterday somebody offered the full amount [Applause] 3,000 amen so the air conditioning is here the dock is taking care of all I have to work is just work with the one uh with the labor and try to get a brand new unit and then forget about and move on but God has been gracious to us he gave us four years instead of two years now it's time to get everything squared away so just be patient we'll be there and we trying to get you out of here the best that we can but let the Holy Spirit have his way amen I believe I got everything squared away let's go to our scripture glory to God you should be more stronger because I did question an answer yesterday had to go to several places yesterday so you are not the one on the hot spot or hot seat if I can call it that way so you slept well you're good so you need to pull on the word and be stronger than me amen amen amen am glory to God I'm giving you the tle already because I don't know how far we will go with this the spirit of the Lord sometime take us off 885 and we have to follow and obey the SC the spirit of the lord it's the spirit of the Lord in you doing what he wanted to do our journey through Joseph's 5 garment part 17 so you got the title right so let's pray so we don't have to stop and waiting for me to pray and they just s Heavenly Father Lord we approaching you humbly father this morning again Lord we thank you for your grace for your love of your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us Lord this is another day that you have given us such a great privilege and Lord we want to take advantage and Lord enjoy the benefit of Calvary Lord may you move me completely aside may you come and speak and be the one speaking through me and the one interpreting because you are the inside teacher May every Spirit contrary to the divine nature of the Holy Spirit be completely out of this Place May father you stay with us and the Holy Angel be here to minister to your children we thank you for everything and commit everything unto thy hand be the Alpha and the Omega in the name of Jesus Christ amen am everybody can hear me well let's go to Genesis chapter 39 glory to God you know where we are right thank you Jesus these sort of teaching covers everything sometime you're trying to stay on the line and it knocks something away somewhere and correct somebody somewhere and then we come back again and we keep moving amen verse one and Joseph was brought down to Egypt and pipar an officer of pharaoh a military man captain of the Guard an Egyptian bought him of the hands of the Israelite which had brought him down there you might be seated so it's clear that this boy was bought not in a civilian home he was taken into a military home amen amen God kept something going on there until they needed a slave for some reason and God knew that the best home for Joseph for his preparation for his training yes he has to be under a military home amen if you take him in a home different than a military home it's not going to work he needed that home as a preparation for his future position amen amen and the Lord was with Joseph is something ringing and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian and his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper into his hand and Joseph found Grace in the in his sight and he served God he served who he was serving his master praise God he served partar amen he serve his master partar but God was in him but he must serve partar amen amen uh I'm inan verse four he served him and he made him overseer over his house and all that he had he put into his hand are we there drop a little bit to verse S it's not on your reading but let me read something there and it came to pass after these things that his master's Wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and she said lie with me but he refused he refused and say to his master 's wife behold my master knows not what he is with me in the house and he has committed all that he has to my hand there is none greater in this house than I neither has he kept back anything from me but you because you are his wife how then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God so in your training you're going to be challenged and as you challenge the way you react is going to determine your future position are we there because brother brandham says this I'm going to remind you this in the message adoption part three brother brandham say now placing the son first thing after the son was in he become a son but then we found out his behavior amen is what set him to adoption whether he behave right right or not so when you're going on the training somebody's watching you and your behavior will determine your adoption you can dodge it but you're not going to be adopted the way God wants you to be adopted so whenever you go through this training make sure you check your behavior because God is preparing you for something bigger amen let's go to the Book of Joshua chapter one glory to God Joshua chapter 1 verse one very familiar scripture my translator you there okay let's s it amen it's always the devil somehow he love visibility yeah he loves somebody to see that he's there or talk about him that's the problem amen visibility is a is a terrible Spirit he won't keep you sitting on your chair in a public place it's a spirit that will always always push you to be upfront to be known and you're going to get in trouble in other words you are NC you can't be tame it's a visibility spirit amen am if they call you somewhere you sit down you will go this way and go back this way you go this way until the whole party knows who you are [Laughter] visibility amen I don't know why you came all always have to deliver what I have to deliver amen Joshua 1 verse one glory to God if you thereare you can say Amen Jesus say when you go somewhere sit in the back and let the the the chief of the party take you and say ah you don't sit here you go there then everybody look at you they say who's that man but if you put yourself into another seat Jesus said they will come and say I'm sorry sir but this is not reserved for you and you have to bear the shame amen am okay all right let me leave visibility alone let me go to verse one now after the death of Moses the servant of who the lord of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spoke to who Josh his volume is not there and the Lord spoke to Joshua amen the son of none come God's minister no are we together so Joshua was the minister of who Moses Joshua why is he not the minister of God why is Joshua not the minister of God they say Moses the servant of the Lord but when they say josua they didn't say the servant of the Lord the servant of Moses amen amen so before you can become the servant of God amen amen you must be the servant of Moses amen don't worry my friend in Exodus 24:3 the Bible says and Moses rose up and his Minister uhuh who Joshua and Moses went up into the Mount of who of God so Joshua was first Moses Minister am Amen in number 11: 28 the Bible say and Joshua the son of Nan Kama serve the servant of God of Moses am I reading a different Bible no sir so so don't start this way Moses the Joshua the servant of who Moses one of his young men answered and say my Lord Moses forbid them and in judges 2 ver8 the Bible say and Joshua the son of n Kama the servant of the Lord so there was a time that Joshua have to be first the servant of Moses amen then after a while he became the servant of God am but even when he was the servant of Moses he was still the servant of God Amen but he was the servant of God under the jurisdiction of Moses that's why Paul say follow me as I follow Christ amen so he was not really Moses servant he was God's servant through the oaces of Moses before you became the right hand of pharaoh you must be party for servant amen are we together we clear so far let's go back to the scripture now after the death of Moses the boss py the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spoke to Joshua the son of Nan Moses Minister yes saying Moses my servant is dead in other words your mentor yes is dead it is time amen amen Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go over this Jordan you and all these people to the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that they so of your foot no more the foot of Moses amen of your foot shall tread upon that have I given to you as I said to who Moses so the promise came through Moses by the possession through Joshua amen are we together amen are we together amen if you notice here in Exodus chap 24 verse4 the Bible says let me go back to 13 so you grab the concept the Bible says and Moses rose up and his minister josu and Moses went up into the Mount of God Amen and he said unto the elders Terry ye here for who us not for me us for us so Moses was not the only person on the mountain Moses went on the mountain with Joshua we got many thing in trouble because of Jehovah witness's books and because of movies and because of cartoons because some of them stay closer to the Bible some of them are completely of the Bible amen if you notice if you look at Jehovah Witnesses or many books you will see that when Moses met God they usually draw a big mountain like this and then they put a cloud on top of the mountain do you know that that's absolutely wrong okay let's push the break my friend I don't want you to say brother stepen say let's go to Exodus 24 Lord have mercy that's why many denominations idea enter into the message amen and we find ourselves preaching like Baptist amen amen let's go to genes or Exodus 24 don't wait for prayer we already pray Exodus 24 go to verse 15 if you dare you can say amen amen the Bible say and Moses went up into the what the mountain or the mountain and a cloud covered the top of the mountain no it covered the mount I'm I'm I'm asking you a question the cloud cover what the mount so this picture is wrong are you do you follow me so the correct photo picture that you should have should be a mountain amen and God covered the whole Mountain amen amen do you follow me that's the reason why Moses say I don't want Eve God say I don't even want an animal to touch not the top of the mountain the mountain itself if an animal touch it you kill it if a human being touch it you kill it are we there are we closer and Moses was not alone in this mountain the Bible now it's a new book okay the Bible says in verse 20 14 and he says unto the Elder carry ye here for us so in this mountain there were two people we clear it was Moses and who Joshua so Joshua also entered the cloud amen are we together are we together he say wait for Terry ye here for us until we come again to what to you what are you trying to get from here amen job to verse uh we on verse 15 job to verse 16 and the glory of the go of of the Lord a b upon M Sana and declad cover it the whole Mountain not the top of it the whole Mountain he cover it how many days six days and on the seven and the seventh day he called to Moses out of the midst of what the cloud so Moses first enter The Cloud of the mountain and inside that cloud there was another Cloud yes sir are we together there was a cloud that covered the mountain completely are we there amen but inside that cloud God was there am the pillar of fire was there and whoever went into the mountain there were not only one person only it was two people how many days did they stay there let me continue you there amen are we together amen and the sight of the glory of the Lord was like devouring fire on top of the water M so on top right here it looks like a fire amen but the cloud covered the whole thing are we together are we together am and the sight of the glory of the Lord was like devouring fire on top of the mountain in the eyes of the children of who Israel and Moses went into the midst of the cloud and got him up into the what the mountain and Moses was in the M how many days 40 days and how many nights 40 nights how did he eat and remember he was not alone brother Bram says this glory to God brother Bram says in the message even event made clear by prophecy he say did not did not our heart burn within us and does not it burn now to know that we are not in the presence of the resurrected H Jesus Christ to whom be glory and praise how forever more who is in the ex in the express image of the almighty God Who s down in the form of a pillar of fire in the burning bush to attract the attention of the Prophet who descended who had descended upon the mountain that mountain right there and anyone that even touch it was to be how kill beside who Moses and who and Joshua but brother Bram continues here in the message the Mighty God unveiled before us he said notice Moses had to enter this Pillar of Fire how alone no one could go with him so in this mountain here somehow toward the top the pillar of fire that light that you see there was there so Moses had to L the mountain are you following me and enter in the pillar of fire alone so there was a stage that Moses went and there was a stage that Joshua have to stop am are we together so Moses had his level and Joshua also had his level and the congregation had their level are you following me the congregation were around the mountain Joshua and Moses enter but for some reason the only one that entered the pillar of fire is only Moses not Joshua amen hallelujah brother brandham say no one could go with him what does that speak to us that you don't come into this by joining a what Pentecostal grou he never revealed it to a group group he reveal it to what IND and that is the way it is today you say I belong to a church I belong to this but I won't work and for anyone to try to follow who Moses to impersonate that he was how dead so remember your limitation preacher amen don't worry my friend let's go this the Bible say as we read in Exodus 24 he says Moses went up into the mountain a cloud cover the mountain and in Deuteronomy 9:9 the Bible says when I was gone up into the month to receive what the tables of stone even the table of the Covenant which the Lord made with you then I in the month how many days 40 days and what and 40 nights and neither did eat bread nor drink what water if Moses was in the mountain 40 days how many days was Joshua there days so if Moses did not eat what about Joshua did he get food so when you get into this mountain whatever happened to Moses at some extent happened to you am only the level remain different Lord help me up glory to God brother Bram say remember it he was like Manana when Moses went on man what happened thunder and lightning and even if a cow or a calf or a sheep or anyone even touch the mountain he must do what die the Bible says so great was the Quake till even Moses fear take off your shoes your shoes here you are on Holy Ground Joshua the great warrior was to take the children over and divide their inheritance could only come how halfway up the mountain am amen so on the top of the mountain it's Moses halfway is Joshua then down here it is the congregation are we together amen are we together amen this is God's order are we there are we there this is God's order and you have to remember that order am if you try to follow Moses you will die in other words no preacher in this message no minister in this message can reach the level of BR Bram do you follow me do you follow me we can have the same effect of the ministry but don't try to mimic brother brandham in what he's doing brother brandham have no replacement sir Lord are we together amen are we together don't come back and call yourself an e messenger there is no e messenger there were only seven star in the hand am of God there were not a star in the hand only seven star in the hand and the seventh one is William Maran Bram after him there is no more star everybody is aysan five whether you a prophet Ephesian 5 a teacher Ephesian 5 an evangelist Ephesian 5 in other word in this time of the BR no one should be on top of somebody do you follow me the only one we have to repeat in this church is William Maran Bram not another preacher not another Prophet we might have Prophet but they are minor the only men Prophet is William Mar Bram even if brother Bram is dead every other Prophet remain M [Applause] now let's go back to the messenger not back behind people are we together are we together are we together Joshua my friend and the Lord say unto Moses take the H Joshua the son of Nan a man in whom is what the spirit and lay that hand upon him and set him before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation and give him a charge in their sight and that shall put all th honor some of the honor of Moses not all of them do you follow me some of the honor put upon him that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be how obedient and Joshua the son of Nan was full of the spirit of wisdom for Moses has laid his hand upon Who and the children of Israel hearkened unto him and did as the Lord commanded un to who Moses who is Joshua today amen who are Joshua today because that confusion is sometime going on in the message we think there will be somebody who's going to be Joshua then everybody have to follow his ministry no no no no no no no no no no no no sir let's go back to Joshua one then I'm going to get to Joshua who is this Joshua today it looks like people don't want to be free in this message the message came to Freed them they've always trying to put themselves behind somebody amen the word freed you stay behind the word not a person if a man leave the word leave him amen we follow you as long as you repeating the message of the hour when you start playing with the message of the hour our contract is over are we together are we together we on Joshua 1 drop to verse 5 there shall not any man be able to stand before you all the days of your life life as I was with her Moses he have to be trained by Moses first he have to stay under Moses first he have to be Moses Minister first because God knew he's going to replace Moses but you got to be trained by Moses if you're going to replace Moses you need to be trained by Moses to make sure you watch Moses correctly because your job is not an exodus Moses already initiated the Exodus your job is to positionally place people in the promised land that is more dangerous than even pulling people from Exodus are we together am the Bible says in verse 5 there shall no man we there amen be able to stand before you all the days of your life amen as I was with who so I will be with you I will not fail you nor forsake you in other words the same Pillar of Fire have to follow you amen amen amen verse six be strong and of good courage for to this people shall you divide an inheritance the land which are sold to their father to give them this land doesn't belong to Joshua we already know who owned the land right we know their position Joshua is only to bring you there and to tell you you go this way you take over your land that's all are we together verse seven only be strong and very courageous that you may observe to do According to some all all what the LA which Moses Moses my servant commanded you in other words Moses is dead but Moses leave a message are we together and Joshua who's coming in the place of Moses amen must bring not a new message are we together Mo Joshua must stay with the message of Moses am and how do you stick with their message amen amen glory to God glory to God according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded you turn not from it from the message to the right hand or what to the left that you may what Prosper wherever you go so the prosperity of Joshua Ministry uhhuh depend on how accurate amen has straight Joshua will stick to the message of Moses amen if Joshua play a little bit with the message it's going to affect his success so a Joshua Ministry is a Ministry that must stick to the prophet very tight for the prosperity of the ministry and the prosperity of the people amen are we together amen who is this Joshua my friend brother Bram says this in the message as I was with Moses so will I be with thee he said the church organization denomination has fail remember when I say denomination leave the Baptist alone denomination in the message fail this is why we are in the message that we are in the message because denomination in this message Fair we usually call them clicks amen and those click bring bearers between Ministry so and so Ministry I won't communicate with do and so Ministry and before you know it that Spirit get in the congregation and the congregation are completely split because of denomination theage in the message are we together and I have a news for denomination it will always fail amen denomination has fa they shall not take the church how over if you preach this message to build a movement you will never take the people where God intended them to be God are we together amen are we together if you a young Minister Who start preaching try to preach to stay let God be glorified in the life of the people don't trust to build any platform those that did it fair and the people are still hovering Devils amen don't worry my friend brother Bram say they shall not take the church over God will raise up a new what system a inter denomination or what system in other word I don't belong to any clicks I can fellowship with with you by the power of God that will take the church into what the promised land organization and denomination has messed it up each one after their own what theology how many Doctrine pop up in this message return Ministry this one this one this all of each one after their own way of what thinking but God will take his Holy Spirit and he will say his what Joshua plural joshuas that would take the church where to the promise with no denomination of whatam TI where anywhere that's why I'm independent am because when you belong to a click you cannot preach outside the box if you click if you preach against the click you get in trouble all of you must line up the certain way that's not the way a servant of God must be a servant of God must be free from any TI whatever God give you to give the people deliver it amen exactly like God said so regardless of your [Music] acquaintance are we together brother Bram saying without any denominational string where tied anywhere but will take over his what his church had done what fa he was a low griver Joshua was called of Grace and he took the church out on are we together if you want to go under Joshua's not one Joshua they are under Moses whenever you clim you won't reach today Joshua will stay somewhere amen Joshua must stay with with the word amen not his word the word of Moses and do not deviate from the left to the right amen it's not even a big job because they already gave us the word all you have to do is stick to the word and God will bring the prosperity to the people brother Bram says this in Thea Church ages he say in every age we have exactly what same pattern that is why the light come through what some god-given Messengers Moses in a certain area and then from that messenger Moses they spread the light through what the ministry of others Joshua who have been what Faithfully taught so to spread the light correctly you must be Faithfully taught you must spend some time being J Moses Minister the problem is the one that are preaching don't even know what they're preaching about because they were not taught correctly and they don't know how to handle the word I'm reading brother Bram brother Bram say if the light come from a messenger the one who's taking that light to spread it must first be Faithfully taught how are you taught before you start preaching amen how were you taught before you start preaching do you even know what Malachi 4 stand for know do you even know the position of brother Bram goad can you show brother Bram in the Bible Bible can you and if you already got confusion about and they give you a congregation for 30 years for 40 years what will become of that congregation confusion a confusion in the congregation and at the end of the day the minister leave the message himself because he was never convinced of the message and brother Bram say you cannot go any higher than your pastor if your pastor is stuck what do you think will happen to the [Applause] congregation your pastor every Sunday preaches the Full Gospel Jesus love you Jesus save you Jes for 40 years how how can you clam if a father have a small Vision what do you expect of the children how can the congregation come the pastor is stuck somewhere for 40 years no teaching in the church no no no no s no grounding in the church and the people are in the air and we call them message believer before you know it they are wolf in sheep covering biting one another left and right because they were hovering Devils but they were not handled properly before you preach this message do you understand the message yourself do you have a revelation of the message reation amen look where we are look where we are you take a Jehovah Witness you give him a message believe a child he can even FL I mean I mean get the child whoop left and right and pull him down because the child was never been taught brother Bram say when Paul preaches the gospel he will stick with with that person until that person is granted and receive the Holy Ghost what have we done but there is Joshua Ministry rising up where we are taking the people back to the Bible back to the message back to the scripture gring the people now devil come here and even a child will handle you left and right it is written it it is written it is written it is written it is written that's why you built that [Applause] church don't go to that church they are well taught it's a shame you should be even happy why you a message believer you afraid of another church come let Fellowship together and you will see how quickly you're going to be silenced that's the truth before you preach the message you need this mentorship my friend you need to read the word for yourself L you preached the message 40 years you have not even finished the church ages what are you preaching how many sermon have you listen yourself and what no input no output then we begin to copy one another the light come and spread through the light of what the ministry of others who has been how Faithfully taugh but of course all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to what speak only what the what the messenger has spoken the law was in Moses law really where did the law come from he came from almighty God even though we say the law of Moses he was not the law of Moses we call it the law of Moses because the messenger and his message are one but it's not the law of Moses it's the law of God and in Revelation 10 we find a mighty angel coming down with an open book that book didn't come from Jeffersonville I know it's going to shock you that book never came from Jeffersonville that book came from [Applause] Heaven do you follow me and he was giv to Malachi 4 and he preach it through Jeffersonville and what we need to do is get that book and eat the book and then when you eat the book you need to do what how can you preach without eating the book The Bible say John eat the book first then you must do what you yourself don't eat the book how do you preach why you that's why our sermon are and we put stories and stories and stories and stories to fill in the blank and to play with the emotion we don't need emotion you need the medication the bomb of gilia which is the word of God the message of the hour you want a story get a story from Brother Bram not from TD ja not from Joel we got many Parable in the message we don't need CH what is wrong with people I don't know why this came my friend but I have to deliver it remember Paul warn people to say what only what he said First Corinthians 14:37 if what if any man think himself to be what a prophet or what or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I do what I write unto you are what Commandments of the Lord in other word me Paul what I told you it's not from me it is God commandment and if you are spiritual you must remember what Paul say and if you are spiritual in this message mind what Malachi 4 say [Applause] hallelujah what can the word of God had from you or came it only I mean unto you only they do what they add here or they what take away there and soon the message is no longer what pure and the Revival what dies down if it without if a Revival died somewhere it means somebody didn't keep the message pure that's why we are in trouble take the law the way it's given give it exactly the way it's given I am not under commission to change prescription prescription are already established by a pharmaceutical company all I have to do is write you a prescription and you go to the pharmacy to take it I don't fabricate my own medication the medication is already there and when I give it to you take it according to the prescription and before you know it you say that's a good doctor no it's a doctor that know how to stick with the book are we together are we together that's why the Bible say Joshua stick with the word amen don't move to the right don't move to the left if you want to proph stick with the word stay with the message and keep that message pure don't interject your thought you will kill the Revival you will kill somebody Joshua Joshua Joshua Joshua brother Bram say you see after he had been he was getting his position then he was to be the what greatest military man that ever been on the face of the Earth there is never been a general like who like Joshua no time no age nowhere has ever been compared to who with Joshua the word Joshua come from the word of what Jesus which means what Jesus which means Jesus or savior or what deler Joshua himself was a military man yes amen but he have to stay under Authority remember the Roman San was a military man and he recognized the authority of Jesus because he was a man under Authority remember Cornelius was a military man so all the opening of the Gentile pipe started with military man the greatest Faith was recognized by a centurion a military man the Holy Ghost enter into a gentile by a military home Joseph went to Egypt in a military home and Joshua was a mil man are we together are we together are we together listen to brother BR my friend he said I think tonight one of the greatest what general of that America has ever had was who Stonewall Jackson I believe there is never been a general that is like him since Joshua so from Joshua no one can be to the level of Joshua except stwall I'm reading brother Brown my friend amen why was he done that amen he was a what a gall man he was a man of what prayer he closed up what everything even made all his General and everything don't even eat a what breakfast or what or nothing and lay on their face and do what seek God yes sir The Secret of stone world was prayer brother Bram continue he said General Grant was a what a drunk alcohol but Stone W Jackson was a what Christian gentleman and he loved the book of Joshua and he wanted to be like who like Joshua and God give him the desire of his [Applause] heart who do you want to be like I want to be like Jesus and if God can give stone wall his desire how much more youall Hallelujah are we together are we together are we together brother Bram say and one day he was asked why is it Mr Jackson that you can stand in such What opposition so many men how against and you take a what a little handful and stand in other words the army of J of stwall was not a big army amen so the size of the congregation is not what makes the problem [Music] amen the reason why the question came is because when they look at the congregation and they look at the accomplishment they don't see that they don't understand they say how can you be so small and you accomplishing this thing like this and everybody's against you and you are standing in the midst of opposition a Joshua Ministry that doesn't care about opposition as long as what I'm doing is in the will of God I don't care about opposition though my enemy be round about me yet in my I will be confident David say don't an army stand around me it's not a problem the Lord is my help the heart is the strength [Applause] sometime you have to stand alone you have to stand yourself you have to make a stand yourself and you going to say people it's not the majority not Moses was one person but he had God and he took the whole Army and wiped it completely look where God is and stand with God that's what is important s wall how can you be a small group like this and you are standing opposition what is your strength my friend brother Bram say he was a very what little a short fellow kind of blueeyed and Wild dark hair he kick his boot on the dust and he say I never put a glass of water to my mouth without doing what thanking almighty God thanking almighty God there is where he comes from that's right there is where the secret what where is the secret spoken word trusting who God and being led by what the spirit of God not led by men but the spirit of the Lord because those that are children of God are led by the spirit of God if the Lord is leading you even if there is a mountain that mountain will be removed because before the go before God lead you to a mountain he already seen that mountain so if he's moving you to the mountain don't worry he will make [Applause] away how can God take Israel and Lead Israel toward the hero sea was there any Bo there was there a submarine there brother Bram say it looks like God was a bad General but the Red Sea have a two-fold purpose the first purpose is to let Israel cross and the second purpose is to wipe the enemy that mountain that you're going through have a due purpose God will make you pass through but he will also destroy your enemy so whichever way you Le I will follow go I walk in the midst of the Valley of the shadow of death I feel no evil because you are with me your road and your staff they comfort me oh the Lord is my shepher I shall not want glory to [Applause] God we want God leadership not men leadership all I need is God to tell me and that's say that satellite you need your absolute between you and God and you know where you standing in the midst of opposition brother Bram say God speak to what man and man do what hears his voice listen to what brother Bram say my friend he say he was the great General who stone wall who has been my what favorite General since Joshua Stone W Jackson was asked one time how can you stand with just a handful of men when the opposition is how so great that is how he got his [Music] name a wall made out of stone a wall made out of stone not wood not W they can put fire a wall made out of stone amen are we together are we together a stone wall and unmovable wall unshakeable wall because my God is unmovable and he is also unshakeable if you greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world if you can shake me you shake my God but my God is unshakeable he is a unbeatable un ret treatable are we together are we together are we together glory to God my friend you need to know who you are and you need to know where you standing and if you stand on the word stand there [Applause] are we together are we together do you know there was a man of David who fought so much until the sword could not come off from his hand the sword become part of his body I want to fight with this message so much until when you pull the message you pulling me because me and the message become one you see this the me go search that water anymore it become part of Me John take the book and do what when you eat the book you and the book become what if they can destroy the book they will destroy you but that book is the word of God Heaven and Earth will pass away not the word [Applause] brother Kelly I cannot move forward help me move forward glory to God hallelujah he says that is how he got his name of what stone he will not what Joshua don't go to the left don't go to the right do not Purge he know what no retreat in other word in the mind of Stonewall there is no backing up if I have to die I die for this and me and this message I'm already sold out there is no retreat in me I won't back up from this message I won't even BGE from this message I was born for this message predestinated for this message TI for this message seal for this message cook for this [Applause] message glory to God glory to God hallelujah he said what could we accredit a man like that to a man when the Yankees came down by what thousand and he stood there in the what minority but he did what they never move him he stood like a what stone wall all the rest of the Rebel Army had what retreated back Ryan came along and say what's the matter with Jackson why is he not going he say he stand like a what a stone that is where he got what what's the matter with brother Steven I'm standing for this

you after your sister-in-law in other word follow your sister-in-law the sister-in-law could give you one more argument and you would have a hard time dealing with that the argument is in the book of Deuteronomy 23 verse three the Bible say an ammonite are we together and a what shall not what enter into the congregation of the Lord so why B going to Israel if your law already said a moabit cannot enter into the congregation of Israel if an Egyptian if an Israelite is an Abomination to an Egyptian why do you B Joseph to go over there because Egyptian don't even eat with the Hebrews a god of paradox my friend amen showing that the other mental of a moabite had to be taken off from rof because rof was a moabit amen that government have to be taken off amen amen amen we got a coat of many

Moab I become a Jew right now I take a stand for the Jew for their people for their God when Naomi heard that glory to God verse 17 where you die will I die and there will I be what buried in other words don't even bury me back to my home keep my corpse over there but over there there is a promise of the Resurrection whoever is buried over there when Jesus will rise again will rise again that's why Joseph said don't leave my bones here when living take me over there and rof already said take me over there glory to God he says where you die I will die and there will I be buried the Lord do so to me and more also if anything but what Death part you and me like a marriage me and you the day you die that is the separ that would be God's separation in other word there is no way you can you can you can shake me off from youi I came by a covenant forever amen do you have hope no hope amen verse 19 so they went until they came to Bethlehem and he came to pass when they were Come to Bethlehem that all the city was moved about them you know this and they said is this Naomi because they came up in bad shape amen Joseph enter Egypt in bad shape he was not having a mantle of beautiful colors and looking nice with shiny golden shoes no he enter Egypt like a slave maybe he didn't take a shower or all the trip because they don't give you a time probably to to even get a shower you a slave you shut up you follow and move on over there so when he get there it's a disaster all clothing may be torn and everything looking bad build already hanging there didn't have time to shave that's how you enter the place where you supposed to be on top amen is this Naomi he say I went out full and the Lord has brought me home how empty the lost everything verse 21 why then call you me Naomi seeing the Lord has tested ify against me and almighty God has Afflicted him so Naomi and Ruth the moabites her daughter-in-law with her which returned out of the country of Moab and there came to Bethlehem in the beginning of harvest remember these garment are seasons do you follow me these garment are SE season and there are period of time that you're going to go through a stage until you get to the next stage and as rof is entering Bethlehem the scripture gave us the time clock in other words somebody was there and look at the watch and when Ru begin to enter Bethlehem you say they came in at 11:00 that's what the scripture is saying at the beginning of barley in other word rof has entered a period of time the beginning amen of Bley Harvest amen amen if this is a period of time it must also have an end are we together sir are we together let's go to Ru chapter 2 and jump to verse 21 if you dare you can say amen amen the Bible say rof and roof the mo say he say to me also you shall keep fast by the young man my time is good my friend you shall keep fast by the young man until they have done what ended all my heart so rof was assigned to a job from the beginning of the Harvest until the Harvest end until the end of the Harvest there is a period of time what is this period of time marking to us according to Joseph pardon the Bible says in verse 22 and Naomi said to her daughter-in-law it is good my daughter that you go out with his Maiden that they meet you not in another field so she kept fast by the maidens of boas to glean to the end of Bley heart Harvest and of wheat Harvest and dwell with her mother inlaw so she had a period of time that roof has to work amen am amen amen when we went through roof just going to scratch the scri so we can go quickly we found that roof has four phases [Laughter] he was roof deciding and by decision she stri himself amen out from the moabite jacket and put on the Jewish jacket amen amen amen a jacket was taken off from her and another jacket was put on her are we there and the second stage brother Bram said from roof deciding it's roof doing what it's right there my friend you can read it rof doing what so rof mve into a servant are we together and then rof was resting and rof was rewarded are we clear so let's look at rof moving into a servant or a slave yes Ru chapter two you there verse one and Naomi had a Kingsman of her husband a mighty man of wealth of the family of ELC and his name was Boaz amen and rof the mo they say to Naomi Let Me Now go to the field who put her to the field who sent her who
