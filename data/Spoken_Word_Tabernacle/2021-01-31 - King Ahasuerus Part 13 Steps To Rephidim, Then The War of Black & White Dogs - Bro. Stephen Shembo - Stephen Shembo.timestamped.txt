[25:43] everyone doing fine
[25:45] hey amen i just wanted to share this i
[25:48] know uh
[25:48] the pastor mentioned about the uh
[25:51] election
[25:52] or the office next month which this is
[25:55] the final day
[25:56] of january and i know my name
[26:00] would come up as a deacon but i just
[26:03] also
[26:03] wanted to share with you i'm a minister
[26:06] of the gospel
[26:08] that's what god called me to do first
[26:11] and
[26:12] if they do
[26:17] select me there as the deacon
[26:20] i will always do my best you're precious
[26:24] you're too precious and i say that
[26:28] humbly but you're too precious
[26:32] for me to halfway do anything you
[26:34] understand what i'm saying
[26:37] if i see that i cannot feel it
[26:40] i would go to the pastor pastor no one
[26:43] not even my wife knew i was
[26:45] going to come up here i was praying and
[26:46] this was on my heart
[26:50] and even if i
[26:53] can't i will come to you just like i'm
[26:55] coming to you now
[26:57] i truly love the lord but i love his
[27:00] word and more so i love his people
[27:04] because here god is doing great things
[27:09] you know some people i tell them i was
[27:11] telling them we was ministering friday
[27:13] and i was
[27:14] people say nothing's being done
[27:16] nothing's being done
[27:17] that's not true you know why you're
[27:19] looking at it the wrong way this is an
[27:21] individual walk
[27:26] so the elect knows what is going on
[27:31] so i want you to understand i will serve
[27:34] you i will serve you dearly
[27:37] but i'm called by him first
[27:40] okay so i just want to share those
[27:42] things with you
[27:45] and i'll do my best and
[27:48] all that the lord has called me to do
[27:51] and that's the only reason why
[27:53] he's been blessing me because i was i'm
[27:55] in his will
[27:57] i always want to be in his will so i
[28:01] appreciate you
[28:02] we have a great man of god that god has
[28:05] sent
[28:06] us a gift from god
[28:09] so i just want to share those things
[28:11] with you ahead of time
[28:13] okay because i love you dearly
[28:16] and i know how the enemy is see he
[28:19] didn't
[28:20] no one knew i was going to say this but
[28:21] god this morning i was talking to god
[28:23] because i know how the enemy is
[28:25] some of you will go the enemy will send
[28:28] some of you to act
[28:29] six is that right he was saying some of
[28:32] you to timothy three
[28:34] okay so you have to understand
[28:38] looking at things but the pastor
[28:41] has that final voice in here
[28:45] okay it's only one voice
[28:48] okay but i want to share those things
[28:50] with you
[28:51] so you can understand because that's not
[28:54] a a foreign position to me i say it that
[28:58] way
[28:59] some of you understand what i'm saying
[29:01] it's not a foreign position to me
[29:03] but i understand that any of the ones
[29:07] that's going to be
[29:08] selected in that that's the hardest
[29:12] working office in the church
[29:15] it's a deacon's office
[29:19] so we have to realize this is the church
[29:22] of jesus christ
[29:24] and the ministry is the the ministry is
[29:27] sent
[29:28] to present a glorious church
[29:32] a god without a spot ain't that what the
[29:34] lord shared us
[29:35] or without a wrinkle so we know that
[29:38] glorious body that we're going to
[29:41] receive but right now i want to bring
[29:43] because i've seen so many things in the
[29:45] past
[29:46] not done according to his will and
[29:49] that's how things
[29:50] get thrown off so if i
[29:54] am i will uh
[29:57] accept it but i will totally work
[30:00] in that office for god's people some
[30:03] things already being done only the lord
[30:05] and i and the pastor knows
[30:08] things already being done but
[30:11] god's always going to have his church
[30:15] filled in the places where they're
[30:18] supposed to be
[30:19] hear what i'm saying according to his
[30:22] will
[30:23] right
[30:35] and i've said it now i never told you
[30:48] this
[30:57] but i want you to trust
[31:08] and the lord knows
[31:30] is
[31:41] this is the supernatural church
[31:55] [Music]
[31:58] you're too precious
[32:14] [Applause]
[32:22] i think we can all agree we love brother
[32:24] kelly too and we
[32:26] i'm sure i'm sure there's nothing no
[32:28] reason not to have confidence in him
[32:30] i want to um i want to share one little

[34:56] i mean like miracle proportion so let's
[34:59] um
[34:59] let's stand and uh
[35:02] and let's um i want to get somebody to
[35:06] pray over this
[35:08] brother daily do you mind coming up and
[35:09] praying over this prayer these prayer
[35:11] requests and then
[35:12] you can lead the lead that song
[35:14] afterwards
[35:16] let's remember each other any unspoken
[35:18] as well i forget some time to
[35:20] acknowledge unspoken requests
[35:22] um but let's remember each other in this
[35:25] end time and i mean it's close we're
[35:26] close
[35:27] amen god
[35:33] i had a couple more testimonies
[35:37] we went to florida over the christmas
[35:39] and
[35:41] scripture says no weapons fashion or
[35:43] form against the shall prosper
[35:47] and um it didn't
[35:50] but we went to my mother who i haven't
[35:52] seen since february of last year
[35:56] and everything was okay when we left but
[35:58] um
[35:59] by the time we got there we kind of
[36:01] found out that
[36:02] that um bug came with us too
[36:07] so we're then it's on my heart thinking
[36:09] lord
[36:10] the thing is very contagious and
[36:14] i really don't want my mother to
[36:17] contract that
[36:18] and i gave it over to the lord and
[36:21] praise god we were there for almost a
[36:22] week and
[36:24] she didn't contract it so that's one of
[36:26] the most
[36:27] glorious thing i can give god praise for
[36:29] you know
[36:32] and um
[36:37] let's just put our hearts unto the lord
[36:42] most gracious and heavenly father

[45:34] england
[45:35] is that right i went to a zimbabwe
[45:37] church in england
[45:39] and the congregation just sang it and
[45:41] sang it and sang
[45:42] and i'm sure that even just in the few
[45:46] minutes that we sing it
[45:47] the presence that you can feel here
[45:50] would be just so much you know if we
[45:51] could just sing it for half an hour
[45:53] could you imagine amen
[45:56] so let's invite our pastor up if y'all
[45:58] can give me a c
[46:01] hallelujah oh
[46:04] [Music]
[46:12] libya believe
[46:17] all things are possible
[46:22] [Music]
[46:26] only
[46:32] [Music]
[46:40] believe
[46:43] all things are possible
[46:50] [Music]
[46:54] only
[46:57] [Music]
[47:08] lord
[47:10] things are possible
[47:16] lord i believe
[47:24] i believe
[47:30] i believe
[47:34] all things
[47:44] one more time jesus is here jesus
[47:52] [Music]
[47:59] all things are
[48:03] [Music]
[48:04] possible
[48:06] [Music]
[48:12] [Laughter]
[48:18] uh
[48:24] all things are possible
[48:32] jesus
[48:35] amen somebody praise him like you
[48:38] believe
[48:39] jesus is here
[48:40] [Applause]
[48:46] amen
[48:50] and i believe that the rain on the
[48:52] outside
[48:54] did not affect you if you are affected
[48:57] by the outside world then you are living
[49:01] in the other court because the other
[49:04] court was exposed to the light of the
[49:06] zodiac
[49:07] if iran iran there if it's hot it's hard
[49:10] there
[49:11] if it's cold it's called there so
[49:13] regardless of what is going on
[49:15] outside in the world
[49:18] it cannot affect you amen and you cannot
[49:22] even be affected by the light of the
[49:24] second part
[49:26] because that light could be put out you
[49:28] have to be affected by
[49:30] the third spot which is the invisible
[49:33] place of god amen that was the eternal
[49:38] light
[49:38] which first timothy 16 6 say that no man
[49:42] can approach
[49:43] that's where the pillar of fire can be
[49:45] made visible
[49:46] and you can stay there and nobody can
[49:48] put that light out
[49:50] so you want to stay in that position
[49:52] whether it rain
[49:53] whether there is corona or no corona
[49:56] whether it's sickness or no sickness
[49:58] whether things are going tougher or not
[50:00] you're still
[50:01] worshiping the living god amen
[50:04] blessed be the name of the lord
[50:12] last sunday we dealt purely with
[50:14] prophecy
[50:16] so if you think there is more time in
[50:18] this world
[50:19] you're just wasting your time if you
[50:22] even need more time
[50:24] there is more time there is an overtime
[50:29] it is an overtime of three and a half
[50:31] years
[50:32] it's in the tribulation period you're
[50:35] going to stay here for three and a half
[50:37] years
[50:37] and you can fulfill your project over
[50:39] there but i'm not going there
[50:42] i'm going to meet my savior into the air
[50:45] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[50:48] let's go to the scripture
[50:50] genesis chapter 26
[50:53] sunday we were unable to even get to our
[50:56] subject
[50:57] so i'm gonna call today's sermon part 13
[51:01] because that was part 13 but we dealt
[51:04] purely with prophecy
[51:05] to stabilize the church and to show you
[51:08] by
[51:08] the prophet and by the scripture where
[51:12] we are
[51:13] i don't have time to argue on the
[51:15] internet
[51:16] or to be on facebook what this preacher
[51:20] here say what this preacher here say
[51:22] that's their responsibility i give to
[51:24] the church what they need
[51:26] here to stabilize you here
[51:29] if somebody's heard something else
[51:32] that's your problem
[51:34] if you have a new coat you bring it to
[51:36] me but don't bring me
[51:39] pasta so and so say this this no i gave
[51:41] you the prophet
[51:42] i gave you the bible and we go by the
[51:45] bible says
[51:46] and brother branham say and that is for
[51:48] the local church
[51:49] what is going on in europe in
[51:52] south america in africa whatever people
[51:56] are saying
[51:57] this is not the time to argue you don't
[52:00] argue with prophecy
[52:01] prophecy is interpreted by god and there
[52:04] is no argument
[52:05] when mary is pregnant she's pregnant
[52:07] that's it
[52:09] we don't have to do dna tests
[52:12] [Laughter]
[52:16] genesis chapter 26
[52:22] it's like a spirit of argument all the
[52:25] time
[52:26] you can't just take god at his word and
[52:29] that's it
[52:31] still want a reason still want to argue
[52:34] what else do you want
[52:39] what else do you want
[52:42] what else
[52:46] oh my god that's why they tell the young
[52:48] ruler they say
[52:49] if they have moses over there if they
[52:52] don't listen to those
[52:54] even if you brought somebody you bring
[52:56] somebody from the dead
[52:57] they're not gonna listen and jesus rose
[53:00] from the dead did they listen to jesus
[53:05] they were not predestinated for that
[53:11] rest they see and they repented
[53:16] and god forgive them so god
[53:18] intentionally locks that up
[53:23] genesis chapter 26 verse 17 if you dare
[53:27] you can say amen
[53:29] and isaac departed there and pitched his
[53:32] tent in other words he camp in the
[53:34] valley of
[53:35] gerald and dwelt there there is many
[53:38] things
[53:39] in this but i'm gonna try to stay
[53:42] focused with what we're dealing with
[53:45] verse 18 and isaac dug against the wells
[53:48] of
[53:49] of water which they have dug
[53:52] in the days of abraham his father
[53:55] for the philistine had stopped them
[53:57] after death after the death of abraham
[54:00] and he called their names after the
[54:02] names by which his father had called
[54:04] them
[54:05] he didn't change the name he kept the
[54:07] same name
[54:08] he only on choke or uncovered
[54:11] the whales that were already choked by
[54:13] the philistine
[54:15] verse 19 an isaac servant dug
[54:19] in the valley now this is a separate
[54:21] well
[54:22] number one and found there
[54:26] a well of springing water these wells
[54:28] are different than the wells of abraham
[54:30] you might be seated
[54:32] the well of abraham were uncovered no
[54:34] problem
[54:35] but this is a new well that is coming up
[54:38] that is
[54:38] in the valley so when they uncovered
[54:41] this war happened verse 20
[54:43] and the herdsmen of gear did strive in
[54:46] other words
[54:47] the struggle the quarrel
[54:50] it was supposed to be a well of water it
[54:52] turned into argument
[54:59] and the hurts man of gear did strive
[55:02] with
[55:02] isaac's herdman saying the water is ours
[55:06] and he called the name of the well issec
[55:10] which brother branham interpreted as
[55:11] malice because they strove
[55:14] with him he also speak about contention
[55:18] verse 21 and they dug another well
[55:22] and strove for that also so the second
[55:25] world
[55:25] again trouble you taught you sitting
[55:29] here it's peace
[55:30] you get into a fight you move to another
[55:33] you get into a fight
[55:34] again amen and he called the name
[55:38] of it cigna and citna
[55:41] means strath
[55:45] but i'm going to draw your attention to
[55:47] the third well that was number one
[55:48] number two number three
[55:50] verse 22 and he will remove from there
[55:53] and dug another well
[55:57] and for that they strove not
[56:00] in other words the third world have no
[56:04] trouble there was no fighting
[56:07] no quailing no arguing on facebook
[56:11] no arguing on what's up
[56:15] there's no argument with that well amen
[56:19] he said and he called the name of faith
[56:23] riobof that's the third one
[56:26] and he say for now the lord
[56:30] has made room for us in other words
[56:34] there is
[56:34] room for everybody here amen
[56:38] it is not something we have to struggle
[56:41] to quell
[56:42] there is room for everybody anybody that
[56:44] want to come drink there is room for it
[56:47] that's real above amen there is room for
[56:50] all of us
[56:51] and we shall be fruitful in the land
[56:55] so the third world which is the real
[56:58] above well
[56:59] was the world not only that i have room
[57:02] for everybody
[57:03] but it's a world that can make you
[57:05] fruitful
[57:06] do you see that let me read it over
[57:08] again he said and he removed from there
[57:11] and dug another well
[57:13] and for that they strive not number one
[57:15] there is no discussion
[57:16] there is no argument there is no
[57:18] reasoning there is no
[57:20] uh contention there nothing once you
[57:22] reach real about there is no trouble
[57:25] once you reach robot that's the true
[57:27] rest
[57:30] amen if you're in sydney you will be
[57:32] fighting
[57:34] make sense if you in insect you're going
[57:36] to struggle
[57:38] you cannot stay in issec you cannot stay
[57:41] in
[57:42] sydney you need to go all the way to rio
[57:45] both
[57:45] when you reach to rio above there is no
[57:48] more battle
[57:48] there is no more struggle there is no
[57:51] more contention
[57:52] there is room for everybody and not only
[57:55] that
[57:55] you begin to produce fruit
[57:58] amen and he called the name of it real
[58:01] above
[58:02] and he said for now the lord has made
[58:05] room for us
[58:06] and we shall be fruitful in the land
[58:10] so in the first world no fruit
[58:13] second no fruit the third one that's
[58:16] where
[58:16] you can begin to produce fruit because
[58:19] you will gain
[58:20] life over there amen not in the first
[58:23] part
[58:24] not in the second part but you get life
[58:26] into the third one
[58:28] when they took the road of aaron aaron
[58:31] on the first part no life second no lies
[58:35] but on the third
[58:36] part that's where the road that was dry
[58:39] the dry stick battered and brought forth
[58:42] what
[58:43] fruit and by the fruit we could identify
[58:47] that it was an almond
[58:48] at the beginning we didn't know where he
[58:50] came from we didn't know where he came
[58:53] from an oak tree
[58:54] or an apple tree but by the third part
[58:58] you can identify by the fruit
[59:04] exodus chapter 16 blessed be the name of
[59:08] the lord
[59:10] hallelujah you need to keep your bible
[59:13] with you
[59:16] exodus chapter 16 verse 1. if you dare
[59:19] you can say amen
[59:22] and they took their journey
[59:26] from elim and all the congregation of
[59:29] the children of israel
[59:31] came to the wilderness of sin we are
[59:33] there that's what we're dealing with
[59:36] which is between ellen and sana
[59:40] so right here the wilderness of sin
[59:44] which we talk about
[59:49] is a wilderness that is between elim
[59:53] and sana so somehow when you begin to
[59:56] move down
[59:57] sana is around it and we know that sana
[1:00:00] is another name for horrible
[1:00:02] we already proved to you that under in
[1:00:05] the bible
[1:00:07] sana of on the 15th day of the second
[1:00:10] month
[1:00:11] after the departing out of the land of
[1:00:14] what
[1:00:15] egypt so when you reach the wilderness
[1:00:18] of sin you are not
[1:00:19] in horrible yet you are not in monsanto
[1:00:22] yet
[1:00:23] but you just getting into the direction
[1:00:26] let's go to chapter 17.
[1:00:30] this is where we weigh and we're picking
[1:00:33] up now
[1:00:34] and all the congregation of israel verse
[1:00:36] 1
[1:00:38] of the children of israel journey from
[1:00:40] the wilderness of sin
[1:00:42] now we started our part there from the
[1:00:44] wilderness of sin
[1:00:46] after their journey according to the
[1:00:48] commandment of the lord
[1:00:50] and pitched in what referred them and
[1:00:53] there was
[1:00:53] no order for the people to drink so now
[1:00:57] we're going from the wilderness all the
[1:01:00] way
[1:01:00] to refer them
[1:01:04] but in referendum there is no water
[1:01:07] how can god lead you to a place where
[1:01:09] there is no water
[1:01:11] amen let's jump to verse
[1:01:15] five and the lord said to moses
[1:01:19] go on before the people and take with
[1:01:22] you
[1:01:22] or the la the elders of israel because
[1:01:25] it's a work of redemption
[1:01:27] and your road we're going to see it
[1:01:29] where would you smote the river the road
[1:01:31] of judgment the road of death
[1:01:34] take in your hand and go behold i will
[1:01:37] stand before you there upon the rock in
[1:01:40] water
[1:01:41] so this rock is
[1:01:45] a little bit further from referendum
[1:01:50] are you following me they camp
[1:01:53] here no word
[1:01:56] he told moses go outside the temple
[1:02:01] [Music]
[1:02:02] go beyond the camper
[1:02:07] make sense now you need to be listening
[1:02:09] to your prophet
[1:02:11] go beyond the camp when you move a
[1:02:14] little bit beyond
[1:02:16] there is a place called horeb or sana
[1:02:20] in that place there is a rock
[1:02:26] but when you struck this rock the water
[1:02:29] will be flowing all the way
[1:02:32] to the camp you strike it outside
[1:02:36] but it brings water into the camp
[1:02:40] the bible become a new book
[1:02:44] amen behold i will stand
[1:02:48] before you there upon a rock in the

[1:03:01] amen you shall smack the rock and they
[1:03:05] shall come

[1:03:17] that walk down
[1:03:19] that road rock was walking yes

[1:03:55] the elder outside here
[1:03:58] when the struck the water goes into
[1:04:00] rephidim
[1:04:01] amen praise the name of the lord and
[1:04:04] moses did so
[1:04:05] in the sight of the elders of israel he
[1:04:08] took the elders
[1:04:09] out in horeb for the work of redemption
[1:04:12] and from there
[1:04:13] came water flowing all the way to the
[1:04:16] camp
[1:04:16] and the people begin to drink let's go
[1:04:18] to verse eight
[1:04:21] then came amalek and fought with israel
[1:04:24] in
[1:04:25] referendum amalek came after the rock
[1:04:29] you must drink the water from the rock
[1:04:31] first then
[1:04:32] amalek come he didn't come before
[1:04:36] there is a reason why first 9
[1:04:40] and moses said to joshua now moses is
[1:04:43] committing that to joshua
[1:04:44] when he was in horeb it is moses when
[1:04:47] it's
[1:04:48] fighting amalek it is no more moses
[1:04:50] moses take his hand off
[1:04:52] he said joshua now it's your turn
[1:04:56] amen but joshua was under moses
[1:05:01] as i was with so shall
[1:05:04] be with
[1:05:09] verse 9 and moses said to joshua choose
[1:05:12] us out man
[1:05:13] go out and go out fight with family
[1:05:16] tomorrow i will stand on the top of the
[1:05:18] wheel
[1:05:19] hill with the road of god in my hand
[1:05:22] you know the story already we read this
[1:05:24] many times at home

[1:05:28] then we're going to pray
[1:05:30] hebrew 13 you need to keep your bible
[1:05:39] hebrew 13 verse 11
[1:05:42] if you dare you can say amen
[1:05:46] praise god for the bodies
[1:05:50] of those beasts speaking about the old
[1:05:52] testament sacrifice
[1:05:54] whose blood is brought into the
[1:05:57] sanctuary
[1:05:58] by the high priest for sin
[1:06:01] are burned outside the camp
[1:06:06] so the atonement paul is saying was not
[1:06:09] burned
[1:06:10] in the camp the priest was taking the
[1:06:14] sacrifice
[1:06:15] outside the camp and kill it outside the
[1:06:18] camp
[1:06:19] then he take the blood and come with the
[1:06:21] blood back into the camp
[1:06:23] but the work of the killing the slaying
[1:06:27] of the lamb was outside the camp
[1:06:31] outside the camper he was in horrible
[1:06:36] not in referendum make sense now
[1:06:40] verse 12 wherefore who

[1:07:01] sanctify the people with his own blood
[1:07:05] suffered outside the water so he went
[1:07:09] outside the gate and suffered there
[1:07:12] somebody killed him somebody smite him

[1:10:33] brother branham said be as cleanish as
[1:10:36] you can be
[1:10:37] but always with an arm out
[1:10:41] in other words i'm holding my brother in
[1:10:44] spoken word tabernacle
[1:10:46] but my arm is also outside if somebody

[1:10:51] amen to reach out and get someone else
[1:10:54] to bring them
[1:10:55] in always keep that arm out
[1:10:59] but remember this is the one you need to
[1:11:02] stand for
[1:11:02] [Applause]
[1:11:04] amen but in this faith
[1:11:08] it says that we are now preaching
[1:11:11] and earnestly contending for don't you
[1:11:14] move
[1:11:15] one and from it
[1:11:19] don't you move one end from the message
[1:11:25] hallelujah four if you believe me to be
[1:11:30] his servant
[1:11:32] how many people believe brother branham
[1:11:33] to be a servant
[1:11:35] how many people believe brother branham
[1:11:37] to be a true
[1:11:38] prophet amen if you believe me to be his
[1:11:43] servant
[1:11:43] this is the problem of god
[1:11:47] the message is god's program for today
[1:11:52] you want a different program fine
[1:11:55] meet you after tribulation not
[1:11:58] in the millennium after the millennium
[1:12:01] when i'm gonna judge you with jesus
[1:12:03] christ
[1:12:04] then we see if you are good to me and
[1:12:07] then you're gonna get that way
[1:12:09] amen it shall never be in the majority
[1:12:16] that's why people begin to depart
[1:12:19] because the numbers
[1:12:20] need to come down never to be in a
[1:12:23] majority too many people
[1:12:25] it shall always be in the minority
[1:12:29] always has and always will
[1:12:32] be but remember it is written
[1:12:36] fear not regardless of what we
[1:12:39] show you on the prophecy feel not
[1:12:44] little flock not big flock
[1:12:48] it is your father's goodwill to give to
[1:12:50] you the
[1:12:51] kingdom everybody clear so far now
[1:12:55] we started with our story this morning
[1:12:59] picking up back last time and we found
[1:13:02] out
[1:13:02] that when we when the bible says that
[1:13:05] israel's journey from the wilderness of
[1:13:08] sin
[1:13:09] all the way to referendum it was not
[1:13:11] actually going from one place straight
[1:13:14] to another one because according to
[1:13:16] number 33 verse 12 and 14
[1:13:19] the bible says that and they took their
[1:13:22] journey
[1:13:22] out of the wilderness of sin which we
[1:13:25] are right here
[1:13:26] amen if you read according to exodus it
[1:13:29] seems like you're going from deal
[1:13:31] all the way there and that's it but you
[1:13:34] need
[1:13:34] god give more information to help you
[1:13:38] understand and receive it
[1:13:40] so they move from that wilderness of sin
[1:13:42] and in camp
[1:13:43] into dhafka which is right there and
[1:13:46] they deported from davka
[1:13:48] and in camp into alaska which is ready
[1:13:51] and they removed from alice and in camp
[1:13:53] at what
[1:13:54] refered him so before referendum there
[1:13:57] were two other stations
[1:13:58] that israel journey and in referendum
[1:14:01] the same thing there was no order
[1:14:05] for the people to drink now when we are
[1:14:08] talking about israel
[1:14:10] brother branham said i believe that all
[1:14:14] of the all things was a type of the new
[1:14:17] to come
[1:14:18] what israel was in the natural we are in
[1:14:21] the
[1:14:22] spiritual god is leading israel
[1:14:25] naturally
[1:14:26] what was what he is doing for us
[1:14:29] spiritually today so when you look at
[1:14:32] israel naturally in the bible
[1:14:34] you need to convert that in your
[1:14:36] spiritual work
[1:14:37] to see what your what god is doing in
[1:14:40] your life
[1:14:41] because israel is god's redemptive name
[1:14:44] everybody clear so far now when we talk
[1:14:48] about the wilderness of sin
[1:14:50] usually when we mention sin
[1:14:54] we usually refer to somebody who is
[1:14:56] approximated
[1:14:58] somebody who's a drug addict somebody
[1:15:01] who is drinking somebody who's smoking
[1:15:05] somebody who goes to the night club and
[1:15:07] all those kind of stuff
[1:15:09] because we are dealing with the second
[1:15:12] banquet of esther we're just preparing
[1:15:14] you
[1:15:14] so we can enter there the first banquet
[1:15:17] we already seen that it was the
[1:15:18] outpouring
[1:15:19] of the holy spirit on azusa street but
[1:15:22] iron man was comfortable we don't want
[1:15:24] that we don't want the devil comfortable
[1:15:26] in our life
[1:15:27] we want the devil to be in trouble then
[1:15:30] you know that you're going
[1:15:31] on the right path everybody clear now
[1:15:34] when we look at sin usually we look at
[1:15:37] somebody
[1:15:38] who's a sinner somebody who put his
[1:15:40] paint
[1:15:41] down somebody who probably smoking
[1:15:44] or walking naked on the street all kinds
[1:15:46] of stuff
[1:15:47] which is true the bible says in 1st
[1:15:50] peter chapter 4 verse
[1:15:52] 1 that for as much then as christ has
[1:15:55] suffered for us in the flesh
[1:15:58] arm yourself likewise with the same mind
[1:16:01] for he that suffered in the flesh has
[1:16:04] ceased
[1:16:05] from his sin everybody clear
[1:16:08] that he no longer should live the rest
[1:16:12] of his time
[1:16:13] in the flesh to the lust of men but
[1:16:16] to the will of god in other words that
[1:16:18] person is already changed
[1:16:20] he's no longer living for himself now
[1:16:22] he's living
[1:16:23] for the will of god everybody clear now
[1:16:26] paul is saying here peter is saying here
[1:16:28] that
[1:16:29] for the time passed off her life
[1:16:33] us to have wrote in the will of the
[1:16:36] gentile in other words
[1:16:38] in our old life in our past life
[1:16:41] we lived like hidden we were sinners
[1:16:45] we were doing things that were not right
[1:16:47] when we walk in lasciviousness
[1:16:50] in lust in excess of one drinkers
[1:16:55] amen on downtown all the time in the
[1:16:58] night
[1:16:59] reveling we were doing what banqueting
[1:17:03] this banquet is not the banquet of
[1:17:06] esther
[1:17:07] this is a banquet of sin amen
[1:17:10] you were born quitting or you were
[1:17:12] sinning feasting with the world
[1:17:15] amen and abominable idolatries
[1:17:19] so it is true when we talk about sin we
[1:17:22] refer to somebody
[1:17:24] who is living an unclean life who's
[1:17:26] living a promiscuous life
[1:17:28] maybe a prostitute maybe running around
[1:17:31] with different women
[1:17:32] and all kinds of stuff that's what we
[1:17:34] refer to but i'm gonna zero
[1:17:36] in something a little bit different to
[1:17:38] blend in with what brother
[1:17:40] tim cross was preaching amen there was a
[1:17:44] man
[1:17:44] by the name of paul here we see paul
[1:17:48] was given a letter by the high priest
[1:17:51] and we want to check a little bit who is
[1:17:53] paul we're trying to understand
[1:17:55] what is sin amen take acts chapter 22.
[1:18:03] if we approach it with a sunday school
[1:18:04] that's fine
[1:18:06] acts 22 you need your bible
[1:18:13] if you dare you can say amen we're
[1:18:16] talking about a man called paul
[1:18:21] amen let's check paul
[1:18:24] and see because when they say the
[1:18:26] wilderness of sin
[1:18:27] brother stephen i'm not sinning anymore
[1:18:30] i don't drink
[1:18:31] i never prostitute my life i'm now going
[1:18:34] to the nightclub
[1:18:36] i'm not playing around i'm not smoking i
[1:18:38] was born in a message
[1:18:40] i was grown in a message
[1:18:44] so you're not a sinner
[1:18:47] paul acts 22 if you dare you can say
[1:18:50] amen
[1:18:51] verse five as also
[1:18:55] the high priest does bear me witness
[1:18:58] this is paul speaking and all the estate
[1:19:02] of the elders so the entire council
[1:19:05] knows paul
[1:19:06] paul didn't say that the dj
[1:19:09] the nightclub knows me that's what he is
[1:19:13] this is not what he's saying he's saying
[1:19:16] that if you
[1:19:16] check my friend they are always
[1:19:19] religious people
[1:19:22] amen praise the name of the lord
[1:19:25] from whom also i receive letters it's
[1:19:28] right there in the picture
[1:19:31] i received letters to the brethren
[1:19:34] and went to damascus to bring them which
[1:19:37] were there
[1:19:38] bound to jerusalem for to be punished
[1:19:42] everybody clear
[1:19:47] go back to verse three i am verily a man
[1:19:50] which was what so paul was a jew
[1:19:53] he was not a gentile
[1:19:57] thank you let's go
[1:20:00] born in texas a city of cilicia
[1:20:05] yet brought up in this city at the feet
[1:20:08] of who
[1:20:09] gemelia you remember when we talked
[1:20:11] about the keynote
[1:20:12] gamelia was a very very good man
[1:20:15] brought up under gamaliel he didn't say
[1:20:19] my father was a drunker
[1:20:23] that's not what paul said usually we say
[1:20:26] my mom was a jungle
[1:20:28] my my father did this my uncle did this
[1:20:31] i came up with a family we didn't know
[1:20:32] god
[1:20:34] now we are talking about a different
[1:20:36] perspective
[1:20:37] this man is born a jew grown up
[1:20:41] correctly
[1:20:45] amen come on and taught
[1:20:48] according to what the perfect manner
[1:20:51] of the law of our so they taught him
[1:20:55] right according to the word
[1:20:59] can this man be a sinner no
[1:21:03] no brother stephen no you remember the
[1:21:06] young ruler
[1:21:08] you remember him he came to jesus jesus
[1:21:10] said you need to know what the lord said
[1:21:12] he said i did it
[1:21:13] i think these are the this are the these
[1:21:14] are the these i did this and jesus liked
[1:21:17] him
[1:21:18] he ended up in hell
[1:21:22] amen and taught according to the perfect
[1:21:27] manner of the law
[1:21:28] of the father and was zealous toward the
[1:21:32] nightclub
[1:21:33] [Music]
[1:21:36] you see when they said go to church he's
[1:21:39] going to church
[1:21:41] he's helping in the instrument he's
[1:21:43] playing the piano
[1:21:44] he grew up in the church environment
[1:21:48] he grew up in the message
[1:21:55] i need to prepare you so we can leave
[1:21:57] this world
[1:21:59] was zealous toward god as you all
[1:22:02] are this day and are persecuted this way
[1:22:07] to death binding and delivering in
[1:22:10] prison
[1:22:10] both men and women everybody clear
[1:22:14] job to verse 19 and i say lord
[1:22:18] they know that i imprisoned and beat in
[1:22:20] every synagogue
[1:22:22] them that believe on you and when the
[1:22:25] blood
[1:22:26] of the martyr stephen was shed i
[1:22:29] also was standing by and consenting to
[1:22:32] his death
[1:22:33] and kept the remnant of them that slew
[1:22:35] him he grew up in the message
[1:22:39] but his life was a father
[1:22:45] fighting thinking the other man is wrong
[1:22:52] let's go to chapter 23
[1:22:57] if you dare you can say amen verse six
[1:23:01] but one who paul everybody clear
[1:23:05] when paul perceived that the one part
[1:23:08] were sadducees and the other
[1:23:12] pharisee he cried out in the council

[1:28:58] look
[1:28:58] perfect
[1:29:02] blameless in other words when you take

[1:29:28] when we say wilderness of sin you can
[1:29:30] say amen because you're looking at the
[1:29:32] prostitute
[1:29:33] i'm not looking at prostituted now i'm
[1:29:35] looking at you
[1:29:37] especially those that are born in the
[1:29:39] message
[1:29:42] amen
[1:29:46] first timothy chapter one
[1:29:50] paul blameless looking good
[1:29:56] he knows all the doctrine he can sit and
[1:29:59] argue
[1:30:02] zealous about the tradition of the
[1:30:04] preacher
[1:30:06] it depends on which camp he is whether
[1:30:08] he is in a return ministry camp
[1:30:10] or jesus camp or this camp or what camp
[1:30:13] it depends on which camp he is
[1:30:17] whether does that reward the message a
[1:30:19] little bit depending on the camp
[1:30:24] whether you want frank kemp
[1:30:28] first timothy chapter one verse nine are
[1:30:31] you there
[1:30:33] knowing this that the law is not made
[1:30:36] for the righteous man
[1:30:38] but for the loneliness paul said he was
[1:30:42] blameless so paul didn't do this
[1:30:45] but stephen had never done this and
[1:30:48] disobedient oh
[1:30:49] i always listen to mom and dad
[1:30:52] even though you sneaking amen
[1:30:56] for the ungodly and for sinners
[1:31:00] for unholy and profane for murder
[1:31:03] and ever kill somebody for murder of
[1:31:06] fathers
[1:31:07] no i never killed my dad and murderers
[1:31:09] of mother i never killed my mom
[1:31:12] for men slayer i never shoot somebody
[1:31:15] for whole monger i was never a
[1:31:17] prostitute i'm virgin
[1:31:19] for them that defiled themselves with
[1:31:21] mankind in other words homosexual had
[1:31:24] never done it
[1:31:26] for men stealers i never did it for
[1:31:28] liars i'm always
[1:31:30] true for perjured person gnomed me
[1:31:33] and if er if there be
[1:31:36] any other things that is contrary to
[1:31:38] what sound
[1:31:40] doctrine but paul was what blameless
[1:31:44] let's see paul according to the glorious
[1:31:47] gospel of
[1:31:49] the blessed god which was committed to
[1:31:51] my trust
[1:31:52] this is paul verse 1 told you it's paul
[1:31:56] and i thank christ jesus our lord who
[1:31:58] has enabled me
[1:32:00] that he counted me faithful putting me
[1:32:03] into the
[1:32:04] ministry also maybe paul when jesus look
[1:32:07] his life he looks good good good good
[1:32:09] jesus said this one can preach the
[1:32:11] gospel not the other one
[1:32:12] not moses that kills someone
[1:32:16] amen verse 13 who
[1:32:20] was before air blaspheme i thought he
[1:32:23] was blameless
[1:32:27] okay and a persecutor persecuted not
[1:32:31] according to the law
[1:32:32] according to the new way amen
[1:32:36] and injurious they're just a bunch of
[1:32:39] idiots they don't
[1:32:40] understand amen
[1:32:45] but i obtain what mercy
[1:32:49] because i did it what ignorantly in what
[1:32:53] oh my god how can somebody be blameless
[1:32:56] like paul
[1:32:57] and he was living under unbelief and sin
[1:33:01] means what
[1:33:06] so you can be born in a message coming
[1:33:09] in the message church
[1:33:11] mom and dad in the message and you still
[1:33:14] living on the unbelief you are still
[1:33:17] under the wilderness of sin
[1:33:23] we are zeroing differently job now
[1:33:27] to verse 14 and the grace of our lord
[1:33:30] was exceeding abundant with faith and
[1:33:33] love
[1:33:34] which is in christ jesus watch verse 15.
[1:33:39] this is a faithful saying and worthy of
[1:33:42] our
[1:33:42] acceptation that christ jesus came into
[1:33:46] the world to save who
[1:33:48] sinners camera or semicolon of whom i
[1:33:52] am what
[1:33:56] so paul was not only a sinner
[1:34:00] he was a chief sinner a
[1:34:07] yet he never been in a nightclub
[1:34:10] yet he never drunk yet he always wear
[1:34:14] long dresses
[1:34:15] but a chief sinner
[1:34:22] hallelujah so when we talk about sin
[1:34:26] leave the prostitute out they're not
[1:34:29] here to begin with
[1:34:30] they are unbelievers but look at a
[1:34:32] religious man
[1:34:34] who was blameless according to the
[1:34:36] legalistic standpoint
[1:34:38] yet the top sinner
[1:34:42] that's why he was fighting that's why he
[1:34:46] was
[1:34:46] zealous to please the father
[1:34:50] amen let's look at this pharisee
[1:34:53] take matthew 12 and i'm gonna go
[1:34:58] everybody clear
[1:35:01] hallelujah let me shoot that devil out
[1:35:05] of your life
[1:35:07] so you can be free and when they tell
[1:35:10] you jesus is coming
[1:35:12] you not shaking when they tell you jesus
[1:35:16] is coming
[1:35:17] you should be happy you should be like
[1:35:24] hallelujah because the spirit and the
[1:35:27] bread say
[1:35:31] jesus is coming what about my project
[1:35:36] i am not married yet maybe jesus can
[1:35:40] wait till i get married then he comes
[1:35:43] i have not bought my house yet
[1:35:47] i have a project i have not finished my
[1:35:49] school
[1:35:50] you are like paul
[1:35:56] matthew chapter 12
[1:35:59] verse 24 hallelujah
[1:36:04] but when the pharisee heard it
[1:36:07] they say this fellow does not cast out
[1:36:10] devils by the elizabeth
[1:36:12] the prince of the devil
[1:36:16] but by beelzebub verse 25 and jesus knew
[1:36:19] their thought
[1:36:20] and say unto them every kingdom divided
[1:36:23] against itself is brought to desolation
[1:36:25] and every city or house divided against
[1:36:28] itself shall not stand
[1:36:30] and if satan cast out satan
[1:36:33] he is divided against himself how shall
[1:36:37] he
[1:36:37] how shall then his kingdom stand watch
[1:36:40] verse 27
[1:36:42] and if i jesus by beerus a book the
[1:36:45] prince of demon
[1:36:47] cast out devils these are the
[1:36:51] by whom do your children do what
[1:36:54] so the pharisees were also casting
[1:37:04] devils
[1:37:08] this is where preachers miss it
[1:37:14] they think because they have a ministry
[1:37:17] they have the holy ghost
[1:37:19] gift and calling or without repentance
[1:37:23] you can cast that devil and be a judas
[1:37:27] and when the people approach your life
[1:37:29] it is contrary to the message
[1:37:32] and yet many preachers in the message
[1:37:36] and you get along them you are shocked
[1:37:39] you say is this ministering acting like
[1:37:41] this
[1:37:44] pharisee casting out devils are not only
[1:37:48] christian caster devils
[1:37:51] are you there hallelujah let's go to
[1:37:55] chapter 23 of matthew
[1:37:58] the wilderness of sin if you are still
[1:38:02] in that wilderness
[1:38:03] if that is your condition
[1:38:07] i'm gonna give you steps you know they
[1:38:09] come out from there
[1:38:11] amen 23
[1:38:15] matthew if you dare you can say amen
[1:38:18] we're talking about the pharisees they
[1:38:20] were casting out devils
[1:38:21] verse 2 saying the scrub and who
[1:38:25] the pharisees sit in water they
[1:38:29] know the message very well
[1:38:35] hallelujah i am shaking you off
[1:38:39] from where you are because paul said
[1:38:42] examine yourself
[1:38:44] whether you are in the faith
[1:38:47] [Music]
[1:38:48] not because you're coming to church
[1:38:50] you're going into the rapture
[1:38:52] you might be in the church but you are a
[1:38:56] sinner
[1:39:00] verse 3 all therefore whatsoever they
[1:39:03] beat you
[1:39:04] observe because they are preaching from
[1:39:07] the message of brother branham
[1:39:08] take what they give you as long as it
[1:39:11] comes from the message
[1:39:12] do it because it's still the word but
[1:39:15] one thing that observe and do
[1:39:19] but do not do do not you
[1:39:22] after their what for they say and they
[1:39:26] do
[1:39:27] so when you look at their life is
[1:39:29] different than their sermon
[1:39:31] they can tell you they believe brother
[1:39:33] branham but they don't actually believe
[1:39:35] brother branham
[1:39:37] take what they preach but don't follow
[1:39:40] their life
[1:39:42] because this has been a hindrance in the
[1:39:44] message
[1:39:46] you're telling a young man what you're
[1:39:47] doing is wrong preacher so and so he's
[1:39:50] doing that
[1:39:51] sister so-and-so is doing that preacher
[1:39:53] pastor so and so he's doing that
[1:39:55] that is not your example follow me
[1:39:59] as i follow christ brother branham
[1:40:02] pointed you to christ
[1:40:05] [Applause]
[1:40:07] you heard so many bad stories about
[1:40:09] preachers
[1:40:10] and you took that to cover yourself
[1:40:13] oh i saw the deacon wife wearing a dress
[1:40:16] here
[1:40:17] so i think i can wear a dress here
[1:40:20] are you there i saw they trust his wife
[1:40:23] having a tight dress
[1:40:27] follow what they tell you but not follow
[1:40:29] their life
[1:40:30] because there is a discrepancy between
[1:40:33] their life and their sermon
[1:40:40] don't give me excuse of preachers
[1:40:43] you are not responsible for preacher's
[1:40:45] life you are not responsible for the
[1:40:47] pastor's wife
[1:40:49] it is between you and the lord
[1:40:52] [Applause]
[1:40:53] [Music]
[1:40:55] amen job to first
[1:41:00] hallelujah i'm on 23 to two
[1:41:04] job to verse father the pharisee
[1:41:09] but all their what
[1:41:12] they do for to be what everything
[1:41:15] they do is for a show it is a custom
[1:41:20] question
[1:41:25] the humility is for people to see them
[1:41:30] amen but truly they are not humble
[1:41:34] bad the hell they would be rob
[1:41:37] the first in a different direction and
[1:41:40] you're going to see whether they humble
[1:41:43] amen hallelujah
[1:41:48] take matthew 16. go back to chapter 16.
[1:41:52] we on 23. i need to drop something here
[1:41:55] 16 verse 12. i can't go
[1:41:59] faster with this we got a chip chip chip
[1:42:01] chip then when we say the holy spirit
[1:42:03] come down
[1:42:04] he comes because he doesn't come there
[1:42:07] is many things hidden there
[1:42:09] you are looking at your own
[1:42:11] righteousness which is the righteousness
[1:42:13] of the law
[1:42:15] which is the righteousness you built
[1:42:16] yourself
[1:42:18] we always wear dresses you have not
[1:42:21] understood yet
[1:42:22] you need to know why are you wearing a
[1:42:24] dress why are you not wearing paint
[1:42:27] that's the reason why people they leave
[1:42:29] the message as soon as they leave the
[1:42:31] message they repent
[1:42:34] they thought pence means brother branham
[1:42:39] that's what they thought they thought
[1:42:41] paint means water branham
[1:42:43] so when they take body brand amount when
[1:42:46] they take by the brand of mouth earrings
[1:42:47] when they take brother brother on
[1:42:49] lipstick
[1:42:51] [Music]
[1:42:54] miss the mark in the church for years
[1:43:02] matthew 16 verse 12
[1:43:06] hallelujah if you dare you can say amen
[1:43:10] they understood not then understood not
[1:43:14] they
[1:43:14] how that he beat them not be aware in
[1:43:18] other words
[1:43:19] he was not telling them be aware
[1:43:23] of the leaven of bread jesus told his
[1:43:26] disciple
[1:43:27] be aware of the leaven of the pharisee
[1:43:30] and the disciples say oh eleven oh so
[1:43:33] the pharisees have eleven
[1:43:34] so maybe in their kitchen they have a
[1:43:36] different level
[1:43:38] and when jesus talked he said that is
[1:43:40] not what i was saying
[1:43:41] i was not telling you about the leaven
[1:43:43] they put in bread to eat
[1:43:46] this is what it means here then
[1:43:48] understood there
[1:43:49] how that he bid them not be aware of the
[1:43:53] leaven of
[1:43:54] bread i was not talking about the
[1:43:56] natural level
[1:43:58] but of the water doctrine of their
[1:44:02] pharisee and their sadducees so the
[1:44:04] doctrine of the pharisee
[1:44:06] is 11. amen what is that doctrine
[1:44:12] go to luke chapter 12. i'm almost going
[1:44:15] to take off
[1:44:17] go to luke chapter 12.
[1:44:20] keep your bible amen
[1:44:24] in the church we give preeminence to the
[1:44:26] word
[1:44:28] amen luke chapter 12 are you there
[1:44:32] verse 1. pages are still flipping
[1:44:36] everybody there okay
[1:44:39] in the mean time when they were gathered
[1:44:43] together
[1:44:44] an innumerable multitude of people in so
[1:44:47] much that they
[1:44:48] trample one upon another he began to say
[1:44:51] to his disciples first of all
[1:44:54] be aware of the leaven of who
[1:44:57] karma which is what see now
[1:45:03] you see now so the entire way
[1:45:06] the fruit that is coming for the
[1:45:08] ministry it is bringing people to be
[1:45:11] just hypocrite
[1:45:13] just to please one another but in the
[1:45:16] heart
[1:45:16] they are struggling are you there
[1:45:20] but these were pharisees casting out
[1:45:22] devils
[1:45:23] sitting in moses sin brother stephen you
[1:45:26] talking about sinners
[1:45:27] are they sinners really take now john 8
[1:45:31] then we take off
[1:45:33] let's see if the pharisee were sinners
[1:45:36] paul was not even a sinner he was a
[1:45:38] chief one
[1:45:42] amen
[1:45:48] if you're sleepy you can stand up there
[1:45:50] i can see everybody
[1:45:52] so i don't want to call you up john 8
[1:45:56] say he embarrassed me i won't come back
[1:46:02] john 8 verse 13.
[1:46:06] you there you can say amen the pharisee
[1:46:09] therefore said to him you bear record of
[1:46:12] yourself your record is not
[1:46:14] true we're talking about pharisees jump
[1:46:16] to verse 23
[1:46:18] and he said to them who are those them
[1:46:22] pharisees you are from what oh
[1:46:28] i thought somebody who come from hell
[1:46:30] will go straight to the nightclub
[1:46:36] i thought somebody who comes for help
[1:46:38] from hell will automatically manifest
[1:46:41] the devil
[1:46:44] they came from hell this is not me this
[1:46:46] is jesus
[1:46:47] but they went to the church and they
[1:46:50] become preachers
[1:46:51] from hell it is not only the pope
[1:46:57] amen you are from medieval
[1:47:00] i am from what above you are of
[1:47:04] this water the last of the eyes
[1:47:07] the lust of the flesh the proud of life
[1:47:10] amen
[1:47:11] i am not of this world
[1:47:15] i say therefore to you pharisee
[1:47:18] that you should die in your
[1:47:21] thought there were religious people
[1:47:23] casting out devils
[1:47:25] you see now in your sin
[1:47:28] for if you do what believe not unbelief
[1:47:33] that i am he you shall die in what
[1:47:37] in other words these religious people
[1:47:40] jesus is telling them you must be born
[1:47:43] again
[1:47:46] when nicodemus came jesus look at him he
[1:47:50] said
[1:47:51] as righteous as you are you must be
[1:47:54] born again
[1:47:58] in other words you are not born yet with
[1:48:01] all the righteousness that you have

[1:48:06] theology that you know

[1:48:22] this
[1:48:24] what is a pharisee

[1:48:30] paul was a pharisee

[1:48:35] don't use that word very often in
[1:48:37] kentucky

[2:04:44] unto me i'm gonna give you rest it was a
[2:04:47] specific rest for the
[2:04:49] soul but david said not only my soul
[2:04:52] but my body also is thirsting after thee
[2:04:56] are you following me now take hebrew
[2:04:58] chapter three
[2:05:00] you remember i gave you this in the
[2:05:02] reading
[2:05:04] amen
[2:05:07] blessed be the name of the lord hebrew
[2:05:10] chapter 3 verse 7
[2:05:16] if you dare you can say amen
[2:05:19] are you there still looking
[2:05:24] verse 7 wherefore as the holy ghost says
[2:05:28] today
[2:05:28] if you will hear his voice heart and not
[2:05:31] your heart
[2:05:32] as in the provocation in the day of
[2:05:34] temptation in the what
[2:05:36] when your father tempted me prove me and
[2:05:39] saw my work 40 years
[2:05:41] wherefore i was grieved with that
[2:05:44] generation
[2:05:46] that was baptized under moses and said
[2:05:49] they do always
[2:05:50] air in their what and they have not
[2:05:54] known my ways
[2:05:56] i saw in my wrath they shall not enter
[2:05:59] into ma
[2:06:00] so there was a rest somewhere
[2:06:04] are you there i said be the name of the
[2:06:06] lord
[2:06:07] job to verse 30 12. take his brethren
[2:06:12] lest there be in any of you
[2:06:15] any of you in this church an evil heart
[2:06:19] of what paul
[2:06:22] unbeliever pharisee and believer
[2:06:25] the sinner on the street unbelievers
[2:06:29] you just unbeliever under a costume
[2:06:33] be careful that your evil heart of
[2:06:37] unbelief
[2:06:38] in departing from what
[2:06:41] that's why when something happened
[2:06:43] people
[2:06:44] are departing from the message amen
[2:06:48] we have costumed christians that were
[2:06:51] sitting in the message
[2:06:54] amen and when an opportunity opened up
[2:06:58] they just leave the message because all
[2:07:00] this time
[2:07:01] they were like paul
[2:07:06] are you there job to verse 16.
[2:07:10] some for some when they have heard
[2:07:13] did provoke however not all that came
[2:07:17] out of egypt by moses
[2:07:19] hallelujah but with whom was he grieved
[2:07:23] for years
[2:07:24] was he not with them that had seen
[2:07:28] whose carcasses fell in the wilderness
[2:07:32] watch and to whom so he that they should
[2:07:35] not enter into what
[2:07:37] his rest but to them that did what
[2:07:42] believe not unbelief verse 19 so we see
[2:07:46] that they could not enter in because of
[2:07:49] what
[2:07:50] unbelief is the deadly devil
[2:07:56] that is gonna block you from entering
[2:07:59] in your rest the rest i'm talking about
[2:08:03] is a place where christianity is no more
[2:08:06] work christianity becomes
[2:08:10] a life you can't help to be a woman
[2:08:14] because you're just a woman it is the
[2:08:17] girl
[2:08:18] that tried to be like this because he
[2:08:21] was not like that
[2:08:22] and when he remember i need to walk like
[2:08:25] a woman
[2:08:26] because he is forcing me are you there
[2:08:30] we don't want you to force christianity
[2:08:35] we want you to put your car in neutral
[2:08:43] we want you to reach a place where that
[2:08:46] desire to do wrong
[2:08:48] is no longer there
[2:08:55] let's go to chapter four verse one
[2:08:58] let us therefore feel less the promise
[2:09:02] being left of us of entering into what
[2:09:04] his rest
[2:09:06] any of you should seem to come short of
[2:09:08] it we don't want anybody to miss this
[2:09:11] for to us was the work gospel what
[2:09:15] so israel they preach the gospel just
[2:09:18] like i'm preaching to you
[2:09:23] history repeat itself do you remember
[2:09:26] that sunday
[2:09:28] don't be an example in the new testament
[2:09:31] of going to hell are you there
[2:09:34] for to us was the gospel preached as
[2:09:37] well as to
[2:09:38] them but the word preached
[2:09:41] the message they preached to them did
[2:09:44] not profit
[2:09:45] them no being mixed with what
[2:09:49] in them that did what so they were
[2:09:52] hearing the word intellectually
[2:09:57] there's no revelation there is no faith
[2:10:00] job to verse 9
[2:10:02] they remain therefore uh rest
[2:10:05] to the people of god for he
[2:10:09] that is entered into his what
[2:10:12] he has also ceased from his
[2:10:15] own so once you enter into this rest
[2:10:19] automatically your car is defaulting
[2:10:22] neutral
[2:10:26] are you there once you reach this place
[2:10:30] automatically somebody take off in your
[2:10:33] life
[2:10:34] [Music]
[2:10:38] are you there you are saved from your
[2:10:40] own
[2:10:41] work as god did from work
[2:10:44] you reach the place god was
[2:10:51] wake up amen
[2:10:55] verse 11 let us label
[2:10:58] therefore to enter into the rest
[2:11:01] lest any men fall after the
[2:11:05] same example of what the unbelief that
[2:11:08] was in the pharisee
[2:11:10] the unbelief that was in paul don't fall
[2:11:13] in that example
[2:11:15] be desperate you say god
[2:11:19] i need to enter into this rest
[2:11:23] are you there moses went in front of god
[2:11:28] and begged god and god said go
[2:11:32] into horrible go beyond the camp
[2:11:35] go outside the camp amen
[2:11:39] because that's where the sacrifice is
[2:11:41] killed go
[2:11:42] today and i'm gonna give water to israel
[2:11:46] amen moses went and stood
[2:11:50] and struck the rock and water came
[2:11:54] what kind of water is this and what kind
[2:11:56] of rock is this
[2:11:59] first corinthians chapter 10
[2:12:02] and did all drink the same word
[2:12:09] are you there so the water
[2:12:12] that came here was a spiritual water
[2:12:17] are you following me now i'm giving you
[2:12:18] the bible
[2:12:20] amen for the drunk of
[2:12:23] that what so that rock was a spiritual
[2:12:27] rock
[2:12:29] and he brought forth spiritual water
[2:12:33] amen that spiritual rock daddy dwight
[2:12:38] that's the reason why the rock could
[2:12:40] walk
[2:12:44] are you there so when they say rock it
[2:12:46] is not a stone
[2:12:49] that rock was a spiritual rock
[2:12:52] that walk was a living rock
[2:12:56] it was a rock that was breathing
[2:13:01] amen and that rock was who
[2:13:04] [Applause]
[2:13:07] when you read the old testament you
[2:13:09] think it was a strong
[2:13:11] no paul now is telling you when they
[2:13:14] told them go to horeb he was beyond the
[2:13:17] temple
[2:13:18] jesus was outside the camp he was ready
[2:13:21] to be killed
[2:13:23] are you there that they say go ahead and
[2:13:26] strike the judgment on him
[2:13:29] and from his judgment will come what
[2:13:32] water and that their water
[2:13:35] if you drink it it puts you
[2:13:39] into rest are you there
[2:13:43] the order what it is brother branham
[2:13:46] in order to get these people to some
[2:13:49] order
[2:13:50] after they got over there in refugee
[2:13:53] this dry place
[2:13:54] was made a what are you following
[2:13:58] me beyond outside jerusalem
[2:14:01] and there god told moses he say
[2:14:04] take the road and the elders and go
[2:14:07] forth
[2:14:07] and i will stand on the rock before you
[2:14:10] and this rock was what
[2:14:12] did brother branham give you a scripture
[2:14:14] did you see the scripture where it came
[2:14:16] from
[2:14:18] the prophet is always zeroing
[2:14:22] with the bible are you there and moses
[2:14:25] with the road
[2:14:26] that he had brought judgment upon the
[2:14:29] nation of israel
[2:14:30] took this same road and smote the
[2:14:32] judgment of god upon the earth
[2:14:35] see he took the sins of the people
[2:14:38] onto this road which he should have
[2:14:41] smoked the people
[2:14:43] instead of smiting the people he smoked
[2:14:46] there
[2:14:47] and the rock through the work of god
[2:14:50] brought what
[2:14:52] brought what to a perishing
[2:14:55] he brought to a dying
[2:14:59] and that is what god did by
[2:15:02] taking his wand of judgment road
[2:15:05] and winding my sins and your sins
[2:15:09] around this road when it should have
[2:15:12] struck
[2:15:12] us but it struck cross
[2:15:16] that from him came forth what
[2:15:19] which means what
[2:15:25] are you understanding now so the rest we
[2:15:28] are talking about
[2:15:29] is the holy ghost
[2:15:33] paul paul why do you persecuted me
[2:15:37] ananias go lay hand on him so that he
[2:15:40] can receive the
[2:15:42] holy ghost when he did
[2:15:46] he changed camp automatically
[2:15:50] and then when he did amalek pull a sword
[2:15:55] you understand and they begin to chase
[2:15:57] after paul
[2:15:59] they are malacate that were quiet turn
[2:16:02] around
[2:16:02] against paul after the holy ghost
[2:16:06] enter are you there
[2:16:10] which means spirit the holy spirit came
[2:16:13] from from him
[2:16:15] to give us what life now we have
[2:16:18] eternal life that's why isaiah 53 said
[2:16:22] he was stricken by god he was
[2:16:25] smitten the chastisement of your peace
[2:16:28] the
[2:16:28] punishment that bring you peace was upon
[2:16:33] him are you there
[2:16:37] so now we understand that in horeb
[2:16:40] water came from christ
[2:16:43] dying on cavalry for you it is expedient
[2:16:46] for me to go
[2:16:48] and the comforter will i don't want you
[2:16:51] to go leave yourself again
[2:16:53] that's what happened in the old
[2:16:54] testament and they could not
[2:16:56] live my life are you there
[2:17:00] i'm going to orb i'm going to do the
[2:17:02] work of redemption
[2:17:03] and from there water is coming for the
[2:17:05] whole camp
[2:17:07] and then rest was found in referendum
[2:17:10] the rest of rephrasing comes from the
[2:17:12] water from the
[2:17:14] rock are you there so that water brother

[2:40:03] that belief on him should receive for
[2:40:06] the holy ghost was not yet

[2:40:39] is your sabbath the holy ghost
[2:40:42] is our the bible say come unto me
[2:40:46] or ye that label and heavy laden i will
[2:40:49] give you
[2:40:50] sabbath for your soul not a day
[2:40:54] you that keep a day i'm afraid of you
[2:40:56] that's right
[2:40:58] the remain of air rest hebrew four we
[2:41:01] read to the people of god
[2:41:03] a sabbath keeping for we which have
[2:41:06] entered into this rest
[2:41:08] have seized from our own as god did for
[2:41:12] what am i saying the first part god is
[2:41:16] dealing with in your life
[2:41:18] is to bring redemption to your soul
[2:41:22] redemption to your inner man redemption
[2:41:25] to your soul
[2:41:27] so that you can stop working so that you
[2:41:30] don't live a christian life
[2:41:31] out of your own ability so that
[2:41:34] christianity
[2:41:35] is not a burden for you also that
[2:41:39] christianity
[2:41:40] is not a prisoner like you hear people
[2:41:43] we were in the prison in the message
[2:41:45] when we were in the message we were
[2:41:47] in the prison we were in the court the
[2:41:49] reason why they felt like that
[2:41:51] because they never drunk from refuge
[2:41:55] because their soul was still struggling
[2:41:58] if it's a prison in the message
[2:42:00] when you left the message which well did
[2:42:03] you go to jesus
[2:42:04] and after you drunk from that well what
[2:42:07] kind of life
[2:42:08] are you having now a world that you
[2:42:11] drunk
[2:42:12] and became a prostitute with men
[2:42:15] a world that you drunk and begin to make
[2:42:18] you wear a tight
[2:42:19] paint what kind of well was that
[2:42:23] the solution was not to leave reference
[2:42:26] the solution was to find where is the
[2:42:29] rock
[2:42:29] in referendum where is the god
[2:42:33] of the message
[2:42:36] are you there are you there and when
[2:42:40] that water was given and israel took the
[2:42:43] water
[2:42:43] and drunk off the water and when israel
[2:42:46] sat down
[2:42:47] and said thank you jesus now we can sit
[2:42:50] and rest
[2:42:52] amalek rosa that's right
[2:42:55] and i'm going to finish with this why
[2:42:58] did
[2:42:58] malek rose up how many here
[2:43:03] how many red back in deuteronomy 1 where
[2:43:06] the spies
[2:43:07] went right in there and tested off the
[2:43:10] things from canada
[2:43:11] which cannon is not a top of the
[2:43:13] millennium how many knows that
[2:43:16] you mean just one hand juni that's right
[2:43:18] cannon
[2:43:19] is not the top of the millennium because
[2:43:23] they had
[2:43:24] woe are you there
[2:43:28] fightings killing and everything else
[2:43:31] in canada cut that
[2:43:34] tap cannon
[2:43:37] is the top of the water
[2:43:41] so when you receive the holy ghost you
[2:43:44] enter the war zone
[2:43:49] [Applause]
[2:43:51] [Music]
[2:43:53] it is a rest to your soul but is
[2:43:57] entering in in the world zone
[2:44:00] that's why as soon as they drank the
[2:44:04] [Music]
[2:44:09] because the last amalekite is in the
[2:44:11] book of esther
[2:44:14] that's where they lost the malachi today
[2:44:17] amen amen hallelujah

[2:44:30] were
[2:44:30] settled down with their holy ghost

[2:44:39] just get there
[2:44:44] once you drink from rough edema
[2:44:48] expect amalek to rose

[2:53:34] knock at the door father to pull them
[2:53:37] from that wilderness of sin
[2:53:40] and to bring them into the water of life
[2:53:43] further if there are people here
[2:53:46] born in a message grew up in the message
[2:53:50] but never have an experience with you
[2:53:54] where they can put their finger and say
[2:53:57] this
[2:53:57] is it this is where my life changed
[2:54:01] this is where i stopped struggling this
[2:54:04] is where
[2:54:05] i stop sneaking on that because if you
[2:54:08] don't do it
[2:54:09] you'll be chased away from home i'm just
[2:54:12] waiting for 18 years old so that i can
[2:54:14] leave home
[2:54:14] and then i can do my own things because
[2:54:17] living under mummy
[2:54:18] living under daddy seems to be like it's
[2:54:21] a bunch of rules
[2:54:23] if they are here this morning they are
[2:54:26] preparing
[2:54:26] to leave or maybe if i get married when
[2:54:29] i'll go to my husband then i will do
[2:54:31] what i wanted to do
[2:54:32] because when i'm living with that they
[2:54:34] want me to do this way this way
[2:54:35] when i go to my own house i can dress
[2:54:38] like i want
[2:54:38] i can eat like i want i can go any
[2:54:41] places that i want
[2:54:42] nobody can come and talk to me father if
[2:54:45] this is
[2:54:46] there is anybody here that is in that
[2:54:49] situation
[2:54:50] that has been living like paul living
[2:54:53] like pharisee
[2:54:54] living after fighting after the
[2:54:57] tradition of people
[2:54:58] took the message for another religion
[2:55:00] where they can find
[2:55:02] friends they can hang out on the weekend
[2:55:04] hang out on friday
[2:55:06] hang out somewhere just get together and
[2:55:08] just life
[2:55:09] laugh joke joke joke go somewhere play
[2:55:12] play play
[2:55:14] lord before the door
[2:55:17] closes may you be merciful unto them
[2:55:22] to knock very hard at their door
[2:55:26] so that they can respond to your call
[2:55:29] and come on today and drink from them
[2:55:34] to rest from all their labor they have
[2:55:37] been working so hard
[2:55:38] they have been laboring so hard all
[2:55:41] their preoperation
[2:55:43] everything they put first is their job
[2:55:46] because their job provides for their car
[2:55:50] their job provide for the food their job
[2:55:53] paid their uh houses and they put you
[2:55:57] second
[2:55:58] yes never understood that if you put
[2:56:01] them
[2:56:01] in on the bed of the hospital they can
[2:56:04] take the house
[2:56:05] they can take that car they can destroy
[2:56:08] that credit
[2:56:09] and they will find themselves down
[2:56:12] father they're under the imagination of
[2:56:15] their own self
[2:56:16] because your word stated that everything
[2:56:19] that men
[2:56:19] do seems good to their own eyes father
[2:56:22] may do you deliver them for that
[2:56:24] deception that deceitful spirit
[2:56:28] that make them think that what they're
[2:56:29] doing is right
[2:56:31] and neglecting the things of god
[2:56:34] when they talk about being somewhere
[2:56:36] they can be on that time
[2:56:38] every day every place is on time when we
[2:56:40] come to the house of the lord
[2:56:42] this is when we take our time this is
[2:56:44] when we shower for 35 minutes
[2:56:47] but when it's on the job sometimes we
[2:56:49] skip showering
[2:56:50] because we don't want to get pointed yes
[2:56:52] lord may
[2:56:54] you touch your children this is not the
[2:56:56] time of playing
[2:56:57] this is not the charm of being under a
[2:57:00] religious spirit
[2:57:01] this is a time that we must make contact
[2:57:04] with the living god
[2:57:06] with the living christ a real god
[2:57:09] that can come and quench the thirst of
[2:57:12] our soul
[2:57:12] and bring us into a candidate seal us
[2:57:16] with the holy spirit
[2:57:17] until the day of redemption and that
[2:57:20] full redemption that will come with
[2:57:22] adoption
[2:57:22] to bring the redemption of our body
[2:57:25] father
[2:57:26] i commit them unto the hand i am begging
[2:57:29] them lord
[2:57:30] as a shepherd we are knocking lord the
[2:57:32] best that we can do
[2:57:34] as a watchman warning your people to
[2:57:37] flee
[2:57:37] from the wrath that is coming because
[2:57:39] you are coming to take your brother
[2:57:42] father lord may they find their place
[2:57:44] for word
[2:57:45] and uh and refer them because there is
[2:57:47] plenty of spaces
[2:57:49] there is room for all if somebody got
[2:57:51] the holy ghost there is more holy ghost
[2:57:53] available to be filled lord father where
[2:57:56] they are
[2:57:57] if they are crying unto you if they are
[2:57:59] praying if they are testing
[2:58:01] made by the power of the holy spirit you
[2:58:04] drop down in their life
[2:58:06] may you touch them then you feel them
[2:58:09] when you give them a personal experience
[2:58:11] that can change their life that can
[2:58:14] bring them
[2:58:15] to be more concerned to the things of
[2:58:18] god
[2:58:19] may lord you don't let them that are
[2:58:21] still reluctant
[2:58:22] don't let them sleep until they make
[2:58:25] peace with thee
