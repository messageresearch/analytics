prophet taught us that the angel of the Lord he loved that song yes sir and so I believe that It prepares an atmosphere for the Lord to move and to speak to us and I want to have the right atmosphere don't you amen you you've got the atmosphere in a building but you also have the atmosphere of what you carry yes siren as the prophet taught us some people you like to be around some people maybe not so much and it's because you carry an atmosphere I say Lord I I want to have an atmosphere to where when you speak I can say yes Lord that's for me amen we just want to have a prepared heart for the word and uh we just want to go to the Lord in a word of prayer tonight before we look to the word if you have a need upon your heart just lift your hand to him and ask him to speak to you and uh I believe that all things are possible tonight so let's just bow our heads together Lord Jesus we love you with all of our hearts Lord and we thank you for another opportunity to assemble together Lord with Believers of like Precious Faith Lord the songs of Zion have been sung Lord to create an atmosphere here we know the prophet put things in proper order and we know that worship creates an atmosphere that the supernatural can take place Lord that your presence would be welcome and Lord we don't want any Spirit we don't want any attitude or anything to displease the presence of the Holy Spirit Lord I pray if there would be any hindering Spirit here Lord that you'd remove it from this building Lord and may you have total Liberty and preeminence in our midst tonight Lord Lord may you speak to our hearts and our lives Lord if we need encouragement may you encourage us if we need discipline may you discipline us Lord if we need healing may you heal us Lord you know all of our needs no matter what they are Lord and we confess to you we don't have a need That's too great that you can't meet tonight Lord we don't have a problem that is bigger than the god that we serve we just

things that you don't want us to say Lord may you be high and lifted up Lord we give you this service tonight Lord may you have total and complete control we ask you humbly and sincerely in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray amen and the church said amen amen if you have your Bibles uh tonight I want to read in the Book of Genesis and the uh 45th chapter I'm going begin reading at the third verse and while you're turning there we just greet you tonight the name of the Lord and uh certainly count on the great honor and privilege to stand here and speak to you the very uh Queen of Heaven the bride of Christ and man we certainly appreciate your pastor here and a stand on the message and I believe he's a lighthouse in this community and I believe you're blessed with a good pastor amen you ought to pray for him and we certainly appreciate him uh and the invitation to come we greet you tonight also from Brother Josh Bennett our pastor and I wanted to be sure and bring greetings to the church here I'm glad to have my wife and baby here with me also and I appreciate her making the sacrifice to be here it is a sacrifice when you have a little baby to take care of so uh you pray for her that the Lord will strengthen her as we travel and go about it can be stressful at times but we know that God is with us and we know that he's faithful and so may the Lord bless you tonight uh let's read here in Genesis 45 and3 yes sir the Bible says and Joseph said unto his Brethren I am Joseph doth my father yet live and his Brethren could not answer him for they were troubled and at his presence and Joseph said unto his Brethren come near to me I pray you and they came near and he said I am Joseph your brother and mean it amazing they didn't realize who he was at first whom he sold into Egypt now therefore be not grieve nor angry with yourselves that you sold me hither amen this is so so so powerful look at the character of J itself in this he said you s me thither he already knew why for God did send me before you to preserve life now they thought they was the one that did that but actually it was God Amen it was God that did that for God did send me before you to preserve life for these two years hath the famine been in the land and yet there are five years in the which there shall neither be earring nor Harvest and God sent me before you to preserve you of posterity in the Earth Earth and to save your lives by a great Deliverance so now it was not you that sent me hither but God he hath made me Father the Pharaoh and Lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt amen now if we'd also turn into a very familiar scripture in Romans 8:28 these to me tie together so perfectly we know that all things work together amen we know that all all things work together for the good to them that love God to them who are called amen according to his purpose for for whom he did for no yes sir he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son yes sir that he might be the first MN first born among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified amen we just ask that God would bless his word as you can be seated and I want to speak to you on humiliation then glorification glory to God humiliation then glorification yes my brother I think it's very amazing uh how God does things don't you God God does things in such a peculiar way he does things in such a unique way and uh just plainly he does things we would have never done and that's right he moves ways we would have never thought I think a powerful scripture in this is Isaiah 558 and the prophet Isaiah there puts it so beautifully he says for my thoughts are not your thoughts that's right and neither are your ways my ways sayith the Lord so he's directly telling us here the amen the thoughts I have they're not your thoughts and the ways that I have they're not your ways amen then he continues on here and he says for as the heavens are higher than the Earth Earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts so if God's thoughts and God's ways are so high as the heavens are above the Earth don't you think he knows what he's doing amen if his ways and his thoughts are are as high as the Earth is from the heaven then surely God knows what he's doing and God knows amen he he he he knows the end from the beginning and he knows what he's doing and and God has a a powerful way he does things because he does things his way is that right amen let me say it this way if God does it his way it's the best way amen if God does things his way it's a perfect way if God has his way and he does things his way it's the best way that something can be done and so we want to say God Have Your Way amen whatever way you bring about healing I trust you to bring it about in that man whatever way you bring about deliver I trust you in the way you'll bring about Deliverance amen listen friends sometimes healing is a process and sometimes it's a miracle sometimes it's instantaneous and sometimes you're waiting on your healing and you're waiting and waiting amen but don't don't be afraid of the weight but have joy in the weight because God is going to fulfill the thing that he started and the way God is going to bring it to the end is going to be a perfect way now we know God heals in ways we would not have seen God speaks in ways we would not have seen God moves in ways that we don't see sometimes amen sometimes it seems like God's silent but that's when he's moving and working some sometimes it seems how how in the world could this be in the plan of God but yet it be so perfectly in the plan how how could all this bad that's happening and this is happening and this is how can you tell me that's in the plan of God amen listen friends the bad is in God's plan the good is in God's plan the trouble is in God's plan the issues are in God's plan amen the disappointments are in God's plan the discouragement are in God's plan Glory humiliation is in God's plan but glorification is also in God's plan amen let's not judge him foolish but let's judge him faithful let's not judge him foolish because how things are but let's judge God Faithful that the end will be better amen God does things his way we just need to trust him and you'll find many instances throughout the Bible that I think display the ways of God you'll find a lot of instances of humiliation and then God bringing it to a glorification and you know sometimes it takes humiliation to bring God on the scene is that right amen sometimes it takes uh complete humiliation to bring God on you say what how could you say it takes humiliation to bring God on the scene well look when when God came on the scene he poured himself into a body the fullness of the godhead bodily came into his son Jesus Christ brother bandam said the most humiliating thing God could have done he came into a body and he washed the feet of his very own creation brother it was God hidden in humiliation it was God hidden in humility and we must come about the same route of humiliation but if you're willing to if you're willing to humiliate yourself in front of this church in front of your neighbors in front of your peers amen you might just get somewhere with God but listen friends sometimes Pride keeps us it keeps us out of the hand of God I say if I had to shout I will shout if if I've got to cry I will cry if I've got to pray at an altar I will pray at an altar it's humiliation that brings glorification that brings God on the scene amen we have to be willing y'all y'all all know the story The Prophet told about that man he he worked for a man and he said sir I I want the religion you God he he noticed the Holy Ghost in that man y'all know the story he said I want I want that religion you God he said well I tell you what after work or whenever it was you come with me and we'll go out and get this religion I I'll get you this Holy Ghost experience that I've got y y'all know how the prophet talks about it he said the boy came out where and he went back uh bypass the stable there he said well we'll come in here and pray he said no you don't get it here he said so they kept on walking and went by a field he said well we'll just come out here in the field I'm begin to kneel down I'm begin to pray he said no you don't get it in that field and they walked on by the where this there was bit this big uh Pig pin I believe something like that that was just so full of deep of mud and M he said what we got to do is we got to climb in here and then we'll begin to pray amen you got to climb in here and then begin to pray and that man like well I I don't know if I could actually do that now he said well you don't want it bad enough he said well I guess I'll go ahead and and go dip in and go get in there and begin to pray and the man begin to start and he said wait a minute you don't have to get in there that pin and in that muck and in that mire to begin to pray but you do have to be willing to get out there and humiliate yourself to obtain an experience with God now listen friends I'm no scientist but I can see what a prophet saying he's saying the church has got to be willing to humiliate themselves they got to be willing to lose all reputation they've got to be will brother listen if you're wrong you got to be willing to be correct if you have to humiliate yourself you've got to be willing to humiliate yourself and no matter what it is you just have to be willing that's exactly right you find God moves in humiliation God moves in humiliation I think it's powerful you look in the Old Testament Abraham is there and God gives him a promise of a son he he gives him a supernatural promise here and you you just bear with me I don't want to take so much time but I want to build into something here if that's okay okay but Abraham is here in the Old Testament and God gives him a promise of impossible he gives him a promise of impossible and he tells Abraham in old age and Sarah's in old age that you're going to Bear a sign in your old age now listen friends amen he had to battle criticism he had to battle naysayers he had to battle being humil amen could you imagine how humiliating it had to be he's there preparing a nursery he's preparing baby clothes he's preparing all of this and Sarah's getting older and Abraham's getting older and all of this is happening but yet he had the testimony brother and sister he staggered not at the promise of God that he was strong in faith and he kept on giving God praise and thanksgiving listen friends what was he doing he was humiliating himself but listen brother it was worse him to humil humiliate himself and to keep his testimony that I don't know how it's going to happen I don't know when it's going to happen but God made the promise to me it may look foolish to you it may look crazy to you but I'm going to have a son he humiliated himself brother sister not just for one year not just for 2 years not just for 10 years but for 25 years he looked like a fool to the world he looked like a crazy man to the world but oh brother sister when they look at that pregnancy test and turns out that Sarah is pregnant he said listen it used to be humiliation but now you're seeing the glory of God it used to be humiliating but now you're seeing the miracle it used to be humiliating to testify that God has given us a baby am I going to have a baby but through the humiliation God turned it around and he brought a glorification through their life such a powerful thing he used humiliation somebody willing to be humiliated but see what was it it was God preparing the faith of Abraham it was God trying the faith of Abraham and Abraham couldn't understand why am I going through this it has been year after year after year here we are praying and believing and praying and believing and nothing is happening but listen friends all things will work together for the good to them that love God Amen now listen friends the Bible did not say that everything would be good but the Bible did say it would work together for the good oh church he did not say everything would be good but he did say it would work together together for your good amen if I was you I would praise God in the bad times I would praise God when it's hard I would praise God when it's difficult I would look at devil in the face and say devil God is going to turn this around and he's going to get the glory out of it amen God is going to turn it around and it won't just be a test but it'll be a testimony of the glory of God Amen that friend I'm serving a God that can take wrongs and make them right I'm serving a God that can take bad things and make them good that's the God that I serve he can take problems and turn them into testimonies he can take all the bad and turn it into a [Applause] testimony my brother preach preach take your time the truth amen look at Abraham he had to persevere he had to persevere amen let me just say this sometimes you just got to push sometimes you just got to get some grid and got to push that's just the truth sometimes you got to humiliate yourself and say you know what I don't feel like having church I don't feel like praising God I don't feel like being here but I'm persevering and I'm pushing and I'm going anyhow and let me just give you a word of encouragement there is a blessing in pressing how do you know brother sister that tonight could not be your night of healing how do you know that tonight could not be un nighted you wouldn't have known if you didn't press but because you pressed your way to the house of God and you knock on that door and said Lord what do you got for me tonight Hallelujah you got from me tonight if we'd had that attitude we would leave the church service with something in our hand Hallelujah preach my brother preach look at Abraham friends amen he persevered he was humiliated it's so powerful because you find Abraham had to overcome right he plainly he just had to overcome being humiliated I think it's so powerful when you read here in the Book of Genesis because after Abraham returned from the slaughter of the Kings after he returned from a gruesome battle he went up on the hill and here come MDC on the hill and begin to commune with Abraham now listen friends it was not before the battle it was after the battle it was not before the victory it was after the victory it was not before it was after he overcame that he communed with MZ today let me tell you unless you overcome there is no communion with mezc unless you overcome yourself there is no communion with MDC but I say oh brother and sister let us press and let us overcoming let us overcome that we might be able to commune with him amen he suffered humiliation and one of the most powerful testimonies the prophet would preach on Abraham many many many services ain't hardly a sermon that he don't mention the Father Abraham I think it's amazing you look in the Old Testament job had lost everything that he had everything that he had to say he was humiliated ain't even a word to use he lost everything he worked for could you imagine but said you you worked you worked hard for the things you've got and and job was a blessed man and out of nowhere he didn't know why but he lost every everything that's right he did nothing to deserve amen he wasn't sinning he wasn't backsliding we all know the story of job but he was being humiliated could you imagine amen you got a brand new truck and then it gets repoed out of nowhere for no reason you got a million Acres or a 100 acres and then it gets just burned up out of nowhere you got sheep and cattle and auction and they get burned up out of nowhere and then your wife says Curse God and die and then your children get killed brother talk about humiliation talk about being humiliated and he sat on an ash Heap and was scraping his boils with a shell or with a stone but you talk about humiliation but listen through all of the bad job never gave up on the God that he served through all he lost everything he had he lost all that had and he sat on that ass sheet brother amen and the prophet talked about job he said that God came down to job and he gave him a vision he said and what was the vision he said he took him to Jesus Christ that's what he said he said job saw Jesus Christ through a vision but you talk about a glorification he's sitting on and asking why did this happen to me why do all why have I lost lost everything I've had and God shows them my vision and brother something in job's heart changed he said I know that my redeemer lives and if this body be dissolved Amen in my flesh I shall see God hallelujah he suffered humiliation and listen about the God that I serve for a minute you realize he lost everything that he had and what did God knew he doubled everything job had talk about glorification he lost everything and God said I'm not going to leave it that way but because you kept your testimony true and because you stayed positive listen friends humiliated his friends came to him and said sister you're you're just a sinner that's right brother you must have backslid for God to to do this to you amen but job remained in job kept Integrity in his heart amen he kept Integrity in his heart he said I'm not a sinner amen I have made my sacrifice on the altar brother everybody was turned against him he was humiliated but at the end of it God Amen he gave him a double portion of everything that he had that's the kind of God I serve and listen job's testimony was the Lord has given and and the Lord has taken away but blessed be the name of the Lord he gave me this then he took it away and then he gave me double blessed be the name of the Lord amen listen sometimes sometimes God wants to take something away from you so he can give you something [Applause] better sometimes he wants to take something away from you and you're holding on and holding on God don't take this away he said if you just let go of that experience of 10 years ago I will give you something better than you have ever had if you're willing to let go of the past God will give you something fresh Hallelujah he was humiliated and being glorified Hallelujah you realize he didn't get double until the first portion that he had was taken away is that right sometimes you got to lose it all sometimes you got to lose all your reputation you got to lose everything you've got for God to meet you and speak to you and deal with you I say Lord if I got to lose it all to get what you have for me I'm willing to lose it all Hallelujah he came to a revelation Moses had to be humiliated right amen he was the the most studied person in the land of Egypt and he had to forget everything he learned he had to forget everything he learned that's exactly what the prophet taught he had to be humiliated said I don't know anything he was a smart man could you imagine having a PhD and a doctorates degree or master's degree and say I got to forget it all and I don't know nothing what a humiliating thing listen friends he went out in the desert and he met a pillar fire he met a burning bus and the prophet said just a couple minutes in the presence of that burning bush it did more for Moses in the 75 years of training oh friends just a couple moments in the presence of the pillar of fire it can make all the difference [Applause] look what God did for Moses the prophet here in a quote he said let's call Another Man by the name of Moses a very outstanding character of The Bible he said the greatest of all the prophets he was the type of the Lord Jesus Christ the priest and the king and the lawgiver he said he was a very perfect type and never a man talked to God outside of Christ himself like Moses look at Moses so humiliated and yet God was using him and he became the greatest prophet in the Old Testament even Moses himself he said and the Lord your God will raise up a prophet like unto me and he prophesied of the coming Messiah could you imagine imagine a man saying something like that the Lord your God will raise up a prophet like unto me testifying of Christ brother he he he humiliated himself and through that he became the greatest prophet of the Old Testament amen so it's not a mystery that God hides himself in humiliation but we have to be willing to humiliate ourselves before God can bring Glory into our lives and I think it's powerful there in the New Testament the book of Philippians Jay doubtless I count all things this is Paul speaking I count all things but loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and I do count them but D that I may win Christ and we all know the prophet talked about Paul the same way as Moses he said he had to forget everything that he learned and what did Paul say he said I count everything I learn as dung everything I knew was just as dung outside of the Excellency of Jesus Christ everything else is meaningless it's meaningless brother he was so humiliated that he said I don't know anything but Christ and him crucified and say oh God May the Church of the Living God get so humiliated to where she says I know nothing but Christ and him crucified Hallelujah we'll Circle back around here to our text now we see very powerful lessons in the life of Joseph in the Bible right the angel of the Lord the prophet talks about Joseph he said all right Joseph was one of the Patriarchs look at him he was so down into Egypt perfect type of Christ amen betrayed by his Brethren sold for a few pieces of silver then the prophet says about 30 pieces about like Christ was he wore a coat of many colors as Christ was seen in Revelation one setting on a throne and a rainbow over him he said that seven perfect colors representing the seven Church ages another place he said Joseph was a perfect type of Christ he was born amidst his brothers hated of his Brethren but loved of his father Joseph amen we know Joseph was born a Seer he was spiritual he was chosen of God he was all of these things he was a perfect type of Christ amen and he was predestinated to be on the throne he was predestinated to be on the throne I want you to hear me for a minute before he was ever there before he was ever there he he was already predestinated to be there exactly like David David was a boy under the house of Jesse and he was anointed to be king by the prophet Samuel brother it was years before David was king in Israel but he was anointed to be king over Israel you say preacher why wasn't David immediately a king in Israel because God was going to prepare David God had to humiliate David God had to get David to die out a little bit he was predestinated the whole time but yet he had to get training to be king over Israel amen y'all know exactly what I'm saying tonight he was predestinated the whole time but yet he had to be prepared to be king in Israel amen I think Joseph is so powerful God had a plan for Joseph's life did he not amen it's so beautiful because Joseph didn't know God's plan for his life but God knew his plan for his life hallelujah amen Joseph did not know God's plan but God knew God's plan and he knew no matter what happens to you Joseph the end has already been spoken from the beginning Joseph if you could only see right now where you're go where this hit me today I didn't know what to do Joseph is down here in the pit brother he's out here in the pit amen his Brethren cast him in there and they're going back to tell his father that Joseph is dead and he ain't here and he's down there in the pit say what did I do to deserve this I've done nothing wrong I've done nothing wrong and he's setting here looking up saying Jehovah what what is going on brother if God could have came down to him and said Jo I would have like to talk to Joseph brother sister and said listen Joseph one day you're going to be on the right hand of [Applause] pharaoh he would have looked at you like you had three heads he would have looked at you like you're out of you mean I'm going to be on the right hand of pharaoh and here I am in a pit yes Joseph one of these days you're going to be on the right hand of pharaoh right now you've got to be in the pit Hallelujah if you're in the pit Rejoice if you're in the prison Rejoice if you're in the jail cell Rejoice because you're on your way to the throne him that overcometh will sit with me in my father's [Applause] Throne if you're in the pit go ahead and praise God if you're in the prison go ahead and praise God if you've been forsaken praise God [Applause] anyhow hallelujah what if Joseph could have known what if Joseph could have known what if he could have known listen I want to tell you something here tonight you have one up on Joseph because you got a word Prophet that was sent to you in this generation and he said the end of this bride is not defeat the end of this bride is not hell it's not the devil's grave but the end of this bride Hallelujah is eternal life it's the New Jerusalem it is streets of gold listen I don't know what you're going through but it don't last always I don't know the difficulties you're facing but it don't last always there is a end for your life and God knows it preach take your time my brother Hallelujah take your why is this happening why is this happening why is this happening humiliation humiliation and when you find Joseph is sold in the slavery more humiliation they're the customs in Egypt they shave all your hair they shave your hair off and they they put you an Egyptian clothes more humiliation amen some of you that got nice hair could you imagine getting it all shaved off be humiliating wouldn't it I don't want all my hair shaved right now humiliating wouldn't sure it would be Amen brother it was humiliation after humiliation after humiliation and Joseph was probably thinking himself why am I going through this why is this happening to me I go here I'm thrown in a pit then I'm so into slavery and then you find Joseph goes on and it's so beautiful because everywhere Joseph was it prospered right everywhere he was it it didn't matter to the church building he prospered in it it didn't matter if the pews were full he prospered in it anywhere Joseph went because he was called by God he was loved by the father even if he was rejected by his brethren he still prospered anywhere he was and y'all know the prophet ly and the church to Joseph that this church will prosper she will not be a sick an anemic bride if you put us under an oak tree we'll Prosper if the roof is falling off we're going to prosper if the carpet's coming up we're going to prosper if we get sick we're still going to prosper whatever happens to us God is somehow how going to turn it around and will prosper you may have to be in jail for a year or two but at the end of it you're going to prosper you say what is this a motivational speech now it's the word of God listen this will actually happen this will actually happen it's not just some feel good it's not just some motivation it's the word of God and heavens and earth will pass away but the word of God will remain forever preach it preach my brother take time so powerful Joseph was brought to the house or he was brought down to Egypt and Piper an officer of pharaoh captain of the garden an Egyptian brought him to the hands of the Israelites which had brought him down thither and you you find now Joseph is here being prospered he was a prosperous man he was in the house of his master of the Egyptian and here is Joseph now he he's in the house of potier Amen he's here under an officer of pharaoh in the house of potier and here he is doing everything right everything right he ain't here living in sin he ain't here back he's doing what he can in the place that he's in right and here comes Piper's wife we all know the story Piper's wife comes unto Joseph and tries to seduce him says uh uh come on in here with me and he does the right thing he runs out of there and says I'm not having nothing to do with this he did the right thing and then look what happens she goes up the p and says oh he tried to do this to me he tried to rape me he tried to come on to me and look at Joseph now he's thrown in the prison again he did nothing wrong he's looking here I go I'm in prison again I'm in prison sitting here and I did the right thing what was it brother sister it was humiliation it was humiliation why did he go back in the prison why did this happen to him because there was still too much Joseph living in him God there was still too much Joseph living in him he said you got to go back down to the prison for a little bit longer there's still too much of you in there and Joseph is there Hallelujah he's there with the Butler and he's there with the baker we all know the story he's there with the Butler and the baker he said hey we're supposed to go up we're supposed to be judged and and he prophesied over them right one of them was death and one of them was life a perfect type of Christ the two thieves on the cross one eternal life and Paradise and the other one was condemned it's exactly the truth and he said when you get there tell him about Joseph here in prison and brother it was all the plan of God hallelujah it was all the plan of God and then there's a call down to Joseph said come up out of the prison we're going to bring you to the right hand of [Applause] pharaoh talk about glorification I was just in prison and you're putting me on the right hand of pharaoh yes I am are you hearing me tonight you can be in prison today and tomorrow be on the right hand of pharaoh you can be in prison right now but tomorrow is the glorification you may be in humiliation you may be humiliated but glorification is just around the corner hallelujah what was God doing he was mulling and preparing and moaning and preparing what was he doing he was giving him character fit to rule and you're thinking all these things are happening to you and I lost my job and I lost this and I lost this and you think somebody's mad ain't nobody mad at you it's God trying to get you to trust him it's God trying to get you to a place of perfect faith God was humiliating him humiliating him he was crushing all the Joseph out of him listen I can imagine Joseph on that day he he's there in all the Palaces getting ready maybe he looked out that day and heard his Brethren were coming they were bringing back Benjamin he's looking out saying look at where I am today look at this palace look at where I am brother listen they say it was about 13 years or so he was in slavery and in prison is sometimes there ain't a sometimes there's not a way around them 13 years you hearing me tonight sometimes there's not a way around them 13 years sometimes brother and sister he I don't know who this is for but sometimes you just have to go through that [Applause] thing sometimes you just got to go through the prison sometimes you just got to go through the slavery y'all know what I'm talking about hey man we say God remove the thorn God remove the thorn God remove the thorn and what does God say listen my strength is sufficient my grace is sufficient for you and my strength is made perfect in weakness brother this ought to put some this ought to put a praise in your lips no matter what happens tomorrow God is going to work it together for my good if I lose my job God's going to work work it together for my good if this happens God's going to turn it around and work it together for my good now at the end of it you actually see the fruit you see the fruit of Joseph cuz he's been through all of these battles all the humiliation all the humiliation and God puts him he puts him in a place that no man could have put him that's right that's righten and he's there speaking with his Brethren he says now therefore be not grieved don't be angry with yourselves that's right that she sold me sther for God did send me before you to preserve life look at that character so beautiful in him no doubt he could have stood there brother sister said listen look at me now Look look what you did to me that's right you kick me in that pit you sold me to the Egyptians now look at me and look at you who who's the who's the tough guy now he could have done that he could have done but all of Joseph had been listen all of Joseph had been molding and pushed
