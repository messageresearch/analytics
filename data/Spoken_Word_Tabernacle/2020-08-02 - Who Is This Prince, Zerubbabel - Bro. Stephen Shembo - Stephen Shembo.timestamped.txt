[36:11] we need people on the firing line
[36:16] amen i promised last sunday
[36:19] based on there was a
[36:23] a question that was sent to me and it
[36:25] was brother micah daily
[36:27] who asked me the question about the
[36:29] seventh angel of revelation 10
[36:32] and the seventh angel of revelation
[36:35] 11. and i know people are attacking the
[36:38] message through that
[36:39] showing that it's the same angel so i
[36:42] promise to do that today
[36:44] but our boss
[36:47] the lord jesus christ told me before i
[36:51] can teach
[36:52] that i need to speak on something today
[36:56] so if you miss something throughout one
[36:59] all the way to 19
[37:02] this is your summary it's going to pull
[37:05] everything together
[37:07] and put it together for you so if you
[37:09] miss something we sleep something
[37:12] you're gonna get it today so be prepared
[37:14] stay alert
[37:16] shake yourself if you're sleepy and may
[37:19] the holy spirit speak to the church
[37:21] this morning yeah brother mike will even
[37:24] remind me something i say elijah
[37:27] shall come first and i omitted first i
[37:31] say no no
[37:32] elijah shall come first the key is
[37:35] shall we because it's projecting to the
[37:38] future
[37:39] elijah shall it's in the future but
[37:42] raja is already came which is the past
[37:45] so just want to connect that in case
[37:48] somebody's watching
[37:49] on youtube seeking for trouble
[37:54] second king chapter 25
[38:00] i'm glad brother branham says 700 then
[38:03] he said
[38:04] no i meant 7 000. so i sent brother
[38:07] michael uh
[38:08] uh uh a quote brother branham say you
[38:11] take me as the dutchman
[38:13] take me for what i wanted to say
[38:17] amen i love brother micah he's always
[38:20] there watching backing me up it's good
[38:23] to her brothers like that
[38:26] second king chapter 25
[38:30] if you dare you can say amen you really
[38:33] need your bible
[38:35] verse eight and in the fifth month
[38:38] on on the seventh day
[38:42] of the month which is the 19th
[38:45] year of king nebuchadnezzar king of
[38:47] babylon
[38:48] kem nabusarandan captain of the guard
[38:53] a servant of king of the king of babylon
[38:56] unto jerusalem you might be seated
[39:01] so the key here that we're trying
[39:05] to point there is that
[39:08] babylon came to destroy
[39:12] israel that's the key the key is babylon
[39:16] came to destroy israel
[39:20] verse 9 and they burn the house of the
[39:24] lord
[39:25] in other words the temple we know that
[39:28] when we speak when we spoke about the
[39:29] temple
[39:30] we showed the temple of solomon with 120
[39:34] people
[39:35] then when jesus came jesus brought the
[39:38] transition
[39:39] jesus told the disciple he said destroy
[39:42] this temple
[39:43] and i'm going to build it in three days
[39:46] so
[39:47] when they heard him they say wait a
[39:49] minute this temple
[39:51] was built in 46 years
[39:54] brother branham said 49 the bible say
[39:57] 46 brother branham did not make a
[40:00] mistake
[40:01] when we gonna get on the 70 weeks of
[40:04] daniel
[40:05] you're going to see why it's 46 here and
[40:07] why is the prophet saying 49
[40:10] so jesus pointed them that it is not
[40:12] this building
[40:14] and the bible said he was not talking
[40:16] about the building
[40:17] but he was talking about his body
[40:19] because according to
[40:21] malachi 3 the lord will come into his
[40:24] temple
[40:25] and that temple was no longer the temple
[40:27] of solomon
[40:28] but it was the temple of the lord jesus
[40:31] christ
[40:32] but on the day of pentecost we found out
[40:34] that the temple changed
[40:36] from jesus into the bread and we give
[40:39] you scripture
[40:40] after scripture to show you that you are
[40:43] the temple of the lord we are the house
[40:46] of the lord
[40:47] so we found out that this temple of
[40:49] solomon was built but
[40:52] babylon came and when babylon came to
[40:56] jerusalem
[40:57] not only did they destroy the city of
[40:59] jerusalem
[41:01] but they destroyed the temple so the
[41:04] temple
[41:04] that was built by solomon
[41:08] there was a temple by solomon that was
[41:10] built
[41:11] that temple when it was built we found
[41:13] out that there was
[41:15] 120 level there
[41:18] and that temple was doing its own thing
[41:21] worship
[41:22] but somehow in the middle of the road
[41:26] babylon came and babylon
[41:29] destroyed the temple
[41:34] there there was a temple of solomon
[41:39] there was a temple of jesus christ there
[41:42] was a temple of the brother
[41:45] god does not change
[41:49] everybody there and he burned
[41:52] verse 9 the house of the lord and the
[41:55] king's house
[41:56] and all the houses of jerusalem
[42:00] and every great man's house burn
[42:03] here with fire
[42:06] verse 10 and all the army of the
[42:09] caldeans that were with the captain of
[42:11] the guard
[42:12] broke down the walls of jerusalem so not
[42:16] only was the
[42:17] temple destroyed but the city was
[42:20] destroyed
[42:23] now the rest of the people that were
[42:25] left in the city
[42:27] and the fugitive that fell the way to
[42:29] the king of babylon
[42:31] with the remnant of the multitude
[42:34] did nabu surrender the captain of the
[42:36] guard
[42:37] carried away but the captain of the
[42:40] guard
[42:40] left of the poor of the land
[42:44] to be vine dressers and husband men
[42:47] so when this destruction happened there
[42:50] were people that were taken
[42:52] into captivity to babylon
[42:55] everybody clear let's go to the book of
[42:58] ezra
[43:02] if you never heard certain books being
[43:05] preached in the message you're going to
[43:07] hear
[43:08] everything in this church by the grace
[43:11] of god
[43:12] we're going to get in the song of
[43:14] solomon we get to ezra we get to
[43:16] habakkuk
[43:17] we get to all of them because by the
[43:20] opening of the seventh year
[43:22] there is no restriction to any books in
[43:25] the bible
[43:27] the entire word of god has been opened
[43:30] ezra chapter 3 if you dare you can say
[43:34] amen
[43:37] page is still turning ezra
[43:41] chapter 3 verse 1
[43:45] and when the seventh month
[43:48] not the first month not the second not
[43:51] the third bada
[43:52] 7 we found out that at the beginning of
[43:55] the
[43:56] seventh month was the sounding of
[43:58] trumpet
[43:59] and we explained that the seven month
[44:01] was the seven church ages
[44:03] and at the beginning of it where the
[44:05] trumpet sounding bringing israel
[44:08] back to the promised land and when the
[44:10] seventh month
[44:12] was come not on the first not on the
[44:15] sixth on the seventh
[44:17] was come and the children of israel were
[44:20] in the cities
[44:21] the people gathered themselves together
[44:23] as
[44:24] one man to jerusalem so everybody
[44:28] left some people left babylon
[44:32] and they went back to jerusalem but when
[44:35] they went back
[44:36] to jerusalem they gathered together as
[44:38] one man
[44:39] in other words there was a unity it was
[44:43] like in the day of pentecost
[44:45] because in the day of pentecost they
[44:47] were gathered together
[44:48] as one man one thought one accord
[44:51] and we found out that when the people
[44:53] left babylon
[44:54] when they went back to the promised land
[44:56] they gathered together as
[44:58] one man getting ready for a pentecost
[45:02] are you there then stood up joshua
[45:07] i'm gonna show you in another place his
[45:09] name is joshua
[45:11] okay then stood up jeshua or joshua
[45:16] the son of jesus and his brethren
[45:20] the priest so the first man that was
[45:22] spoken here
[45:24] his name is jeshua or
[45:27] joshua which was speaking about jesus
[45:30] christ
[45:31] are you there there is joshua here
[45:34] and joshua was not alone but joshua
[45:37] had preached with him this
[45:40] and uh and his brethren the priest the
[45:43] second
[45:43] man was zerubbabel
[45:49] the second man is the ruba bell
[45:53] the bubble call him sometime zorobabel
[46:01] and his brethren so joshua
[46:05] here has priest
[46:08] i want you to follow me carefully but
[46:11] zorobel
[46:13] has his brethren
[46:19] so the robber bell was a jew but for
[46:22] some reason
[46:23] they put him assad from his brethren
[46:29] praise the lord and
[46:32] built the altar of god of israel
[46:36] they went back to rebuild the temple but
[46:39] instead of starting to rebuild the
[46:41] temple
[46:42] the first thing they rebuilt was the
[46:44] altar
[46:45] there are many altar in the temple but
[46:48] we want to know which one
[46:49] the altar of god of israel to offer
[46:52] burn offering so the first thing joshua
[46:57] and the robber bell did was to rebuild
[47:00] the altar and that altar was the author
[47:03] of the burn offering
[47:05] which is speaking about the brazen order
[47:10] if you need more clarification you see
[47:12] me you already got my number
[47:14] the number of the church officer if you
[47:16] have any question
[47:18] feel free open your cannon
[47:21] give us a call let's talk
[47:25] no hiding stuff and you are struggling
[47:28] if we preach something you need more
[47:30] clarification give us a call
[47:33] okay they built the altar of god of
[47:38] israel to offer burn off in their own
[47:41] the present okay as it is written
[47:44] in the law of moses the man of god
[47:48] so the bible in the old testament was
[47:50] the book of the lord
[47:52] he came in moreover with the mighty
[47:54] angel
[47:55] so jehovah did everything with
[47:59] joshua according to the book
[48:03] according to their bible of their time
[48:07] [Music]
[48:13] but the first thing was the altar
[48:14] everybody there
[48:17] job two verse six from the first day of
[48:21] the
[48:22] seventh month seven churches we are
[48:24] still on the seventh month
[48:26] began dead to offer burnt offerings to
[48:29] the lord
[48:30] but watch carefully the foundation
[48:34] of the temple of the lord was not yet
[48:37] laid
[48:37] so they only work with the altar
[48:41] but the second thing the bible is
[48:43] talking about
[48:44] is the foundation of the temple
[48:49] remember paul says that i later
[48:54] okay verse seven
[48:57] they gave money also to the meson and to
[49:00] the carpenter
[49:01] and meet and drink and all to them of
[49:04] zion
[49:05] and to them of tyre to bring cedar
[49:07] streets from lebanon just like solomon
[49:09] did
[49:11] to the sea of joppa according to the
[49:13] grant
[49:14] that the head of sarri's king of persia
[49:18] watch verse 8. now the second year
[49:21] of the coming of the house of god at
[49:24] jerusalem
[49:25] in the second month begins jeroboam the
[49:28] son
[49:28] zerubbabel the son of celtia and jeshua
[49:31] the son of
[49:33] jose deck and the remnant of the
[49:35] brethren
[49:36] the priest and the levite so there is
[49:39] three category of people here
[49:41] we have joshua we have zerubbabel
[49:45] and we have a remnant of people
[49:48] and that remnant had priest
[49:52] he had levite he had
[49:56] children of israel in another place he
[49:59] also has
[50:00] prophets and these children
[50:04] were not all israel it was only two
[50:07] tribes
[50:08] it was the tribe of judah and the tribe
[50:12] of benjamin
[50:14] i would deal with this when we talk
[50:16] about the
[50:17] two stave of the ark of the covenant
[50:20] are you there the remnant of their
[50:23] brethren the priest and the levite
[50:25] and all day that will come out of
[50:26] captivity to
[50:28] jerusalem so these people came out of
[50:30] captivity of babylon
[50:32] back to jerusalem and appointed they
[50:35] leave out from 20 years old
[50:37] and upward to set forward the work of
[50:40] the house of the
[50:41] lord job to verse 10 very important
[50:45] and when the builder laid the foundation
[50:48] of the temple of the lord
[50:50] the first thing they built the brazen
[50:52] altar
[50:54] according to the law or the order bible
[50:57] the second thing now they are building
[50:59] the foundation
[51:01] everybody there the foundation that was
[51:04] destroyed
[51:05] by babylon now zero bell
[51:09] and joshua are coming back
[51:12] before they put the foundation they
[51:14] started first
[51:16] with the brazen altar to make sure the
[51:18] sacrifice
[51:19] is continually given to god then they
[51:22] rebuilt the foundation of the house of
[51:24] the lord
[51:25] everybody there and when the bill
[51:28] delayed the foundation of the temple of
[51:30] the lord
[51:30] they set the priest in their apparel
[51:32] with the trumpet
[51:34] and they leave out the sons of azer with
[51:36] symbols
[51:37] to praise the lord after the ordinance
[51:40] of david king of israel
[51:42] and they sang together by course of
[51:44] praising and giving thanks to the lord
[51:46] because he's good for his mercy endures
[51:49] forever toward israel
[51:52] and all the people shouted with great
[51:55] shout
[51:56] so when they put the brass an altar no
[51:59] problem
[52:00] but when they laid the foundation
[52:02] shouting begin to
[52:04] start in the house of god something
[52:07] happened
[52:08] with that foundation that when the
[52:10] foundation
[52:11] came back shouting came back
[52:15] are you there shouting when they praised
[52:19] the lord
[52:20] there was presence shouting like the
[52:23] like a pentecost back are you there
[52:27] because the foundation of the house of
[52:29] the lord was
[52:31] laid but many of the priests and leavert
[52:34] and the chief of the father who were
[52:36] ancient men that had seen the first
[52:39] house
[52:40] when the foundation of this house was
[52:42] laid before the eyes
[52:43] they did what wept so when the
[52:46] foundation was placed
[52:48] some people were shouting for joy
[52:53] and other was weeping
[52:57] depending on what the holy spirit does
[52:59] to you
[53:01] when the holy spirit drop her imam makes
[53:04] somebody shout
[53:05] he might make somebody jump and he can
[53:08] make somebody also crying
[53:12] are you there praise the lord
[53:17] and for the foundation of the house was
[53:19] laid before the
[53:20] eyes wept with her loud voice
[53:24] they were not whipping like they were
[53:27] weeping
[53:32] like a pentecost and many did what
[53:37] shouted a lot for joy
[53:41] they were not saying praise the lord
[53:43] they were going out like
[53:45] praise the lord are you there
[53:48] praise the lord verse 13 so that the
[53:51] people could not discern
[53:54] the noise of the shout of joy
[53:57] from the noise of the whipping of the
[53:59] people
[54:00] for the people shattered with a large
[54:03] shout and the nose was heard
[54:05] and far off so when the holy spirit
[54:08] dropped in this place i want you to be
[54:11] free
[54:13] if you need to shout shout if you need
[54:16] to cry
[54:17] cry if you need to jump jump
[54:21] because the people in the hotel must
[54:23] heal your shout
[54:25] out
[54:30] are you there so be free in this church
[54:34] worship god according to the liberty of
[54:37] the holy gods
[54:40] we are not catholic we are not religious
[54:43] here
[54:44] we are free if the holy spirit make you
[54:47] jump
[54:48] jump
[54:51] zechariah chapter 4
[54:58] if you have a trouble with that you
[55:00] listen to the tape of brother branham
[55:03] and you're going to hear noise and
[55:05] shouting and speaking in tongues
[55:07] and interpretation in the message
[55:13] zechariah chapter four
[55:17] if you dare you can say amen
[55:20] and the angel that talked with me verse
[55:23] one came again
[55:24] and worked me as a man that is working
[55:27] out of his sleep
[55:29] and said to me what see you he's talking
[55:32] about the prophet
[55:33] and i said i have looked and behold a
[55:35] candlestick of gold
[55:38] with a ball upon the top of it
[55:41] and with its seven lamps there on and
[55:44] seven pops
[55:45] to the seven lamps which are upon the
[55:47] top thereof
[55:48] so when zechariah is looking
[55:52] what he's seeing he's seeing a
[55:53] candlestick
[55:58] with seven lamps everybody there
[56:02] and there was a ball here on top from
[56:04] where the seven lamps were pulling oil
[56:08] verse three and two olive trees by it
[56:11] we already preached about this one upon
[56:14] the right side of the ball
[56:16] and the other on the left side of the
[56:18] ball so
[56:19] with this there were two trees here
[56:28] one on the right one on the left are you
[56:31] there
[56:33] verse four so i answered and spoke to
[56:36] the angel that talked with him
[56:37] with me saying what are these my lord
[56:41] zechariah is asking a question what does
[56:44] this mean
[56:46] then the angel that talked with me
[56:48] answered and said to me
[56:50] no you know what this be and i say no
[56:53] my lord then he answered and spoke to me
[56:56] saying
[56:58] this is the word of the lord to
[57:01] zerubbabel so when zechariah was
[57:04] looking at the candlestick zechariah
[57:07] said
[57:08] what does this mean instead of the angel
[57:12] answering him and saying
[57:13] it means this this the angel begin to
[57:17] talk to him
[57:17] about zerubbabel
[57:23] in other words the candlestick have
[57:25] something to do
[57:27] with zerubbabel
[57:32] this is the word of the lord to who
[57:35] it is a message specific to
[57:41] not everybody i am talking to
[57:44] zorobabel
[57:48] saying not by might
[57:51] nor by power but my
[57:55] spirit said the lord of hosts in other
[57:58] words
[57:59] the work that are gonna be done here
[58:02] are not gonna be done by the power of
[58:04] men
[58:06] it's gonna be done by the power
[58:09] of the holy ghost in other words zoro
[58:13] babel
[58:14] his first message must speak about
[58:18] the holy ghost
[58:25] holy ghost
[58:28] remind zoro babel that that the first
[58:32] thing of his message
[58:33] must be the holy ghost

[1:02:22] me to you for who has this passed the
[1:02:25] day of small things
[1:02:27] so so babe when he start his ministry
[1:02:31] he's struggling
[1:02:34] i am nazarova bell but i'm just giving
[1:02:38] an example
[1:02:39] so when zoroba best started his ministry
[1:02:42] he didn't have a piano player
[1:02:46] i am not zoro babel
[1:02:50] are you there he was struggling at the
[1:02:53] beginning of his ministry
[1:02:56] when he want to preach his coat as a
[1:03:00] whole
[1:03:04] okay and people look at him
[1:03:09] and they say this is gonna be a garage
[1:03:14] here
[1:03:17] who has dispersed the day of small
[1:03:19] things
[1:03:21] for they shall rejoice and see the
[1:03:25] plummet that word plummet is also called
[1:03:29] a plum line
[1:03:33] when a mason built a house
[1:03:37] they usually have a load of thread like
[1:03:40] this
[1:03:41] that has like a stone over there
[1:03:44] are you there because when you hold the
[1:03:47] thread like this it's not going to keep
[1:03:49] a right line
[1:03:50] so they put a stone for them to measure
[1:03:54] the wall
[1:03:55] and to make sure the wall is straight
[1:03:59] so rubber bear will have that instrument
[1:04:06] the people will rejoice when the hand of
[1:04:10] the robot
[1:04:13] his hand will catch an instrument
[1:04:19] and that instrument is used to measure
[1:04:23] every wall of the temple
[1:04:27] if you are building a house you must go
[1:04:30] by the measure of zorobabel
[1:04:34] that measure struck the hand of the
[1:04:38] robber
[1:04:43] watch and shall see the plummet or the
[1:04:46] plum line
[1:04:47] in the hand of zorobabe with those
[1:04:51] so the plum line that is on zorobabel
[1:04:55] have a stone under and that stone
[1:04:59] have seven something
[1:05:02] relax continue they are the what
[1:05:07] so this stone that's the rubber ball has
[1:05:10] with a thread have seven eyes
[1:05:16] where do you get that go back to verse
[1:05:20] three chapter 3.
[1:05:21] just go back this way i don't want you
[1:05:23] to say brother stephen saying
[1:05:25] you see chapter 3 there job 2 verse 9
[1:05:31] and for behold the stone that i have led
[1:05:34] before who
[1:05:35] joshua upon
[1:05:38] how many stones there is only one stone
[1:05:42] upon one stone shall be what
[1:05:46] so it's one stone but seven eyes
[1:05:50] seven angels one stone
[1:05:56] are you there and when you look at the
[1:05:58] stone of the planet here
[1:06:00] you usually have a shape of a pyramid
[1:06:07] now let's go back to chapter 4 verse 3
[1:06:09] then we're going to pray
[1:06:12] for whoever despised the day of small
[1:06:14] things
[1:06:16] for they shall rejoice and shall see the
[1:06:18] plummet or the prime line
[1:06:20] in the hand of zorobabel with those
[1:06:23] seven
[1:06:24] they are the eyes of the lord which one
[1:06:27] two and four
[1:06:28] uh which run through and four to and fro
[1:06:32] through the whole earth
[1:06:35] as a summary the temple was destroyed
[1:06:39] by babylon that temple needed to be
[1:06:42] restored
[1:06:43] we built back to rebuild that temple
[1:06:47] it took joshua jerobel
[1:06:51] and a group of people that's going to be
[1:06:54] caught up
[1:06:54] into this move that group have priests
[1:06:59] they have leverage in other words they
[1:07:01] have
[1:07:02] preachers there ministers are you there
[1:07:06] they have the simple people from the
[1:07:08] house of judah

[1:08:00] father be the alpha and the omega of
[1:08:02] this service
[1:08:03] in the name of jesus christ amen
[1:08:08] joshua remnant of the people number one
[1:08:12] the rebuild the altar number two we have
[1:08:15] the foundation
[1:08:16] number three we have also the headstone
[1:08:19] my message this morning
[1:08:22] summarizing everything is
[1:08:25] who is this prince zero babel
[1:08:31] who is this prince the rubber bell
[1:08:36] we see a man there that is moving
[1:08:39] and trying to rebuild the temple who is
[1:08:43] this man you ready
[1:08:47] all right if you look at the star
[1:08:51] of david which is the
[1:08:55] flag of israel the flag of
[1:08:59] israel have a specific star
[1:09:02] i want you to stay really tuned have a
[1:09:06] specific star
[1:09:07] that is called the star of david
[1:09:11] sometimes the star is called the six
[1:09:13] point star
[1:09:14] of david because he have six point
[1:09:18] but if you look at this star closely
[1:09:22] with a spiritual eyes
[1:09:24] you'll see that this star have two
[1:09:27] pyramids
[1:09:28] that have merged together
[1:09:32] there is a pyramid that is looking down
[1:09:35] [Music]
[1:09:36] and there is also a pyramid that is
[1:09:39] looking up
[1:09:41] everybody following me and we know
[1:09:44] that when you spoke about the zodiac
[1:09:47] everybody should be comfortable with the
[1:09:49] zodiac now in this church
[1:09:50] the seals and the zodiac if you still
[1:09:52] have a problem you see me
[1:09:54] when we spoke about the zodiac we found
[1:09:57] out that the zodiac have to end
[1:10:00] the zodiac started with the virgin vigo
[1:10:04] and the zodiac end with leo the lion
[1:10:07] are you there and with virgin it was the
[1:10:11] first coming of jesus christ
[1:10:13] and when jesus christ came jesus christ
[1:10:16] came
[1:10:17] under a ministry called the cornerstone
[1:10:21] are you there because when jesus was
[1:10:24] talking to the pharisees
[1:10:25] jesus taught them he said the stone
[1:10:29] that they build rejected in the old
[1:10:32] testament when they were building the
[1:10:34] temple of salomon
[1:10:36] there was a stone that was a little bit
[1:10:39] funny
[1:10:40] there was a stone that was a little bit
[1:10:42] peculiar
[1:10:43] and when the builder look at that stone
[1:10:46] they
[1:10:46] kick that stone away they thought that
[1:10:49] stone was of no importance
[1:10:51] but as the builder continued to build
[1:10:54] the house
[1:10:55] they found out that they got in trouble
[1:10:58] because the progression of the house was
[1:11:00] stopped
[1:11:01] and then they come to find out that the
[1:11:03] stone that they were rejected
[1:11:06] was the main stone of the building
[1:11:09] so when jesus christ came down jesus
[1:11:13] stopped the pharisee
[1:11:14] he said remember the stone that the
[1:11:16] builder rejected
[1:11:18] that same stone became the corner
[1:11:21] stone and that ministry when jesus
[1:11:24] christ came
[1:11:26] if you notice you will find out that the
[1:11:28] pyramid
[1:11:29] is not looking up but the pyramid is
[1:11:32] looking down
[1:11:33] because jesus have to carry a sin
[1:11:37] god have to fall not because
[1:11:40] god sinned but because god took your
[1:11:44] place
[1:11:45] and he must go to hell and from health
[1:11:48] pick up the old testament sen
[1:11:51] and bring them up together are you there
[1:11:54] and then when we finish and jesus christ
[1:11:57] rose and goes back to heaven
[1:11:59] in the end time we found out jesus
[1:12:02] coming down
[1:12:03] according to revelation 10 and mighty
[1:12:06] angel came down
[1:12:08] but this time the pyramid is not coming
[1:12:11] down
[1:12:11] this way but the pyramid is coming down
[1:12:15] looking upward because down on the earth
[1:12:19] there is a church over there and that
[1:12:22] church
[1:12:23] had been building up and that church
[1:12:25] built up as a trapeze
[1:12:28] and that church was missing the
[1:12:30] cornerstone
[1:12:31] so the cornerstone must come down in the
[1:12:34] position of
[1:12:36] departure so as he come down
[1:12:39] he fits the building and once he fits
[1:12:41] the building
[1:12:42] he brings perfection to the building and
[1:12:45] he takes the church into the rapture
[1:12:48] are you there together praise the lord
[1:12:51] so this
[1:12:51] ministry of the end time is called the
[1:12:54] capstone
[1:12:56] or the head stone
[1:12:59] so the star of david put the two
[1:13:02] together
[1:13:03] he put the two hands of the zodiac
[1:13:06] together
[1:13:07] he put the alpha and the omega ministry
[1:13:11] together
[1:13:11] that's why we explained the ministry of
[1:13:14] defects
[1:13:15] which is the head of the women and the
[1:13:18] body of the
[1:13:19] lion are you there everybody good so far
[1:13:23] now as we begin to move
[1:13:26] when jesus left we found that
[1:13:30] parking when pogba came
[1:13:33] paul said that i laid the foundation
[1:13:38] and the foundation paul said was what
[1:13:42] and that cross was duh everybody clear
[1:13:47] you remember we are summarizing
[1:13:49] everything together
[1:13:50] are you there and then last week we
[1:13:53] found out that the church
[1:13:55] was built upon the foundation
[1:13:58] of the apostle and the prophet and jesus
[1:14:02] christ himself the chief
[1:14:05] everybody there so paul raised the
[1:14:08] foundation
[1:14:09] of the cornerstone but that foundation
[1:14:13] was just
[1:14:14] a part
[1:14:19] let's see this dedication the spiritual
[1:14:22] builders today
[1:14:24] and that is why the bride building of
[1:14:27] class
[1:14:28] is not ready for the broad group it's
[1:14:31] because that the builders
[1:14:33] has rejected the what the chief
[1:14:37] cornerstone that was led on the day off
[1:14:41] everybody clear on the day of pentecost
[1:14:44] which is there
[1:14:46] so when paul laid down the foundation
[1:14:50] the foundation that paul lay was what
[1:14:54] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:14:58] and once the rubber bear comes
[1:15:01] because babylon entering
[1:15:05] are you there through the nicoletan
[1:15:07] spirit
[1:15:08] into berlin bellum into jezebel
[1:15:12] when babylon enter in somebody must
[1:15:16] restore the church
[1:15:17] back but the first message of the robber
[1:15:21] bell
[1:15:22] is go back to lay the holy ghost
[1:15:28] we are going slowly paul laid the
[1:15:31] foundation
[1:15:32] that foundation was just a part
[1:15:37] in the end time we found out that we
[1:15:40] have malachi 4.
[1:15:41] i showed you from 1 to 19. you should be
[1:15:45] clear with brother branham now
[1:15:47] malachi 4 malachi 4 had a ministry
[1:15:52] that means we will have the word once
[1:15:55] again
[1:15:56] as he was perfectly given and
[1:15:59] perfectly understood in the days of
[1:16:04] power i will tell you who will heaven
[1:16:08] it will be a prophet paul was
[1:16:11] a prophet jesus was a prophet
[1:16:15] brother branham was a prophet are you
[1:16:18] there
[1:16:19] it will be a prophet as thoroughly
[1:16:22] vindicated or
[1:16:25] even more why more
[1:16:28] totally vindicated because he must go
[1:16:32] higher than john the baptist
[1:16:34] are you there are you there
[1:16:37] thoroughly vindicating there was any
[1:16:40] prophet
[1:16:42] in all the ages from enoch
[1:16:46] to this day why because
[1:16:50] this man will of necessity
[1:16:54] have the capstone prophetic
[1:16:58] ministry everybody
[1:17:04] so when we look at the capstone
[1:17:07] ministry of brother branham we found out
[1:17:10] last week or the week before that we
[1:17:12] have
[1:17:13] two parts we are summarizing everything
[1:17:19] now this messenger of malachi 4
[1:17:23] and revelation 10 7 is going to do what
[1:17:27] two things one according to malachi 4
[1:17:32] he would turn the heart of the children
[1:17:34] to the
[1:17:35] we saw it last week which is bringing
[1:17:38] them to the foundation of
[1:17:40] the cornerstone the foundation of power
[1:17:44] because paul preached in part
[1:17:49] number two he will reveal
[1:17:52] the mystery of the seven thunders paul
[1:17:55] did not do this
[1:17:57] so he goes higher than paul
[1:18:02] in revelation 10 we charge the
[1:18:04] revelation content in the seventh
[1:18:07] seal so when the end time ministry comes
[1:18:12] first we have to bring back the
[1:18:15] foundation
[1:18:17] the foundation the rubber bill
[1:18:21] must bring back first the foundation
[1:18:25] are you there he must first start with
[1:18:28] the foundation he must bring paul
[1:18:31] back
[1:18:35] are you there after that foundation
[1:18:39] the foundation bring us back to what
[1:18:42] paul
[1:18:42] that's why brother branham said i preach
[1:18:45] like
[1:18:46] paul are you there
[1:18:50] that was before the seals but the second
[1:18:53] thing
[1:18:54] the foundation is bringing the holy
[1:18:56] ghost back the second thing
[1:18:58] when we're gonna see brother branham say
[1:19:00] today
[1:19:01] the methodist the baptist in 1953
[1:19:05] the lutheran the pentecostal everywhere
[1:19:08] around
[1:19:09] if you don't watch out friend the real
[1:19:12] what
[1:19:13] you shall rejected and the cornerstone
[1:19:17] in the building of this spiritual house
[1:19:19] is down
[1:19:22] you are afraid of it you are afraid of
[1:19:25] fanaticism
[1:19:27] when the cornerstone comes
[1:19:31] when the foundation is laid
[1:19:34] some people shout some people
[1:19:38] whip some people roll on the floor
[1:19:44] the people the baptists the mentalities
[1:19:47] the pentecostal they don't want to do
[1:19:49] anything with him they said we don't
[1:19:51] want this kind of
[1:19:52] religion in our churches
[1:19:56] they were rejecting the cornerstone
[1:19:59] [Music]
[1:20:02] i know we got a lot of scarecrow and
[1:20:04] mockery
[1:20:05] why if there was not that there would
[1:20:08] not be a real one
[1:20:09] but there is a genuine article of the
[1:20:12] holy spirit
[1:20:13] in the baptism that is true all right
[1:20:16] and now they have rejected say oh
[1:20:20] we can't do that oh well we can't have
[1:20:22] that brother who
[1:20:25] so brother branham we stole back
[1:20:28] the cornerstone and the people
[1:20:32] rejected them praise the lord
[1:20:36] the second ministry is the capstone
[1:20:40] ministry because the hand of the robber
[1:20:43] bear
[1:20:44] brings the foundation and the same hand
[1:20:47] of zero babel
[1:20:49] bring also the headstone everybody clear
[1:20:53] and the headstone was the opening of the
[1:20:55] seventh
[1:20:56] seal now
[1:21:00] let's go to the book of haggai let's see
[1:21:03] who is this is a robber bell
[1:21:06] who is this zoroville
[1:21:15] you want to see how guy you go through
[1:21:17] the prophet
[1:21:19] throughout zechariah toward the end of
[1:21:22] the old testament
[1:21:27] just to help you up
[1:21:32] if you dare you can say amen the book of
[1:21:35] her guy
[1:21:40] chapter one
[1:21:44] thank you brother mike
[1:21:48] in the second year of darius
[1:21:51] the king in the sixth month
[1:21:54] in the first day of the month came the
[1:21:58] word of the lord
[1:21:59] by haggai the prophet to
[1:22:02] zero babel the son of shelter
[1:22:08] what governor of
[1:22:11] judah when we read they only say zero
[1:22:15] babel the robber belt the robber bell
[1:22:17] we don't know who was zero battle now
[1:22:20] it's clear
[1:22:21] the robber bell is who the governor off
[1:22:27] so this man calls the rubber bill
[1:22:30] or zorobabel his name
[1:22:34] zerobabel means born at
[1:22:38] babel
[1:22:42] let me take my time what does babel mean
[1:22:47] now our subject tonight begin
[1:22:50] in babylon and babylon was first located
[1:22:55] which it is in the channel and he was
[1:22:58] first called the gate of god
[1:23:02] what babel
[1:23:06] everybody clear bevel and ladder was
[1:23:10] called
[1:23:11] babylon which means confusion
[1:23:15] so baba means babylon
[1:23:20] in other words zorobabel was not born
[1:23:24] in israel
[1:23:27] so rubber bear was born in babylon
[1:23:32] they were taken captive in babylon
[1:23:36] when they got there zoral babel was born
[1:23:40] under babylon
[1:23:43] take matthew chapter one keep her guy
[1:23:46] because we're gonna go back to her guy
[1:23:47] keep your finger in her guy
[1:23:50] take matthew chapter one
[1:23:54] praise god
[1:23:58] matthew chapter one if you're there you
[1:24:00] can say amen
[1:24:02] a priest of judah not a priest of
[1:24:08] it's uh uh what do you call a issachar
[1:24:12] or naphtali but judah
[1:24:15] and judah that's where christ was coming
[1:24:19] are you there and the tribe of judah was
[1:24:22] the tribe
[1:24:24] that always tempted to marry gentile
[1:24:28] women
[1:24:30] are you there the children of judah went
[1:24:33] and married them
[1:24:35] nobody say anything when they were
[1:24:38] coming down
[1:24:39] to jericho is someone from judah
[1:24:43] mary rahab the prostitute nobody say
[1:24:46] anything
[1:24:48] in the time of roof bowers judah
[1:24:52] mary ruth nobody say anything
[1:24:57] only judah and judah
[1:25:01] was a tribe where the messiah the
[1:25:03] lawgiver
[1:25:04] was coming out the king was coming from
[1:25:07] judah
[1:25:08] but judah was always mingling with the
[1:25:11] gentile
[1:25:12] women not jews
[1:25:16] he doesn't like jewish women he only
[1:25:18] goes to the gentile
[1:25:24] and zoro comes from judah
[1:25:29] matthew chapter 1 verse 12.
[1:25:33] and after they were brought to what
[1:25:37] to babylon jacob and i are father who
[1:25:41] salathiel and salat are father who
[1:25:46] so so rob baby was born in
[1:25:49] in babylon but
[1:25:52] this matthew chapter one is the lineage
[1:25:55] of
[1:25:56] jesus christ look right here
[1:26:00] so the robber bear was off the lineage
[1:26:03] of jesus christ he was of the species
[1:26:09] the blood of christ
[1:26:16] zerubbabel means born a baby
[1:26:19] or born in babylon brother stephen say
[1:26:23] i show you that in the bible now today
[1:26:27] we have babylon
[1:26:31] go to the book of revelation
[1:26:36] keep your hair guy because we're going
[1:26:38] to go back to haggai
[1:26:40] go to revelation chapter 17
[1:26:48] we miss detail and we don't understand
[1:26:51] our ministry
[1:26:53] now we're going down like a microscope
[1:26:58] brother stephen you going there there
[1:27:00] there there
[1:27:01] brother brother i'm saying this i have a
[1:27:03] blindness
[1:27:04] he said that blindness is near saturn
[1:27:08] they don't like details
[1:27:10] [Music]
[1:27:14] revelation 17 and there
[1:27:18] came one of the seventh angel we're
[1:27:20] gonna see that angel down the road
[1:27:23] which had the seventh vow and talk with
[1:27:26] me saying
[1:27:27] to me come here i will show you the
[1:27:30] judgment of the great who
[1:27:32] a prostitute that sits upon many
[1:27:35] waters
[1:27:36] with whom the kings of the earth have
[1:27:38] committed fornication
[1:27:39] and the inhabitant of the earth has been
[1:27:41] made drunk with the wine of her
[1:27:43] fornication
[1:27:44] so he carried me away in the spirit in
[1:27:46] the wilderness
[1:27:47] and i saw her a woman
[1:27:50] seated upon a scarlet color beast full
[1:27:53] of name of blasphemy
[1:27:55] having seven heads and ten horns and the
[1:27:58] woman was a red in purple
[1:28:00] and scarlet color and deck with gold and
[1:28:03] precious stone and pearl
[1:28:04] having a golden cup in his hand full of
[1:28:06] the abomination and filthiness of the
[1:28:08] fornication verse five
[1:28:10] and upon her forehead was a name written
[1:28:13] mr who
[1:28:16] the great the mother of who
[1:28:19] and the abomination of the earth so
[1:28:22] let's go back to our guy now
[1:28:23] so we found out that today we have a
[1:28:26] babylon that babylon
[1:28:28] is a woman called babylon the mother of
[1:28:33] harlot zerubbabel was born
[1:28:37] in babylon
[1:28:42] brother branham i dream that i saw a man
[1:28:47] that was supposed to be my father
[1:28:49] supposed
[1:28:51] though he was a great big man and i saw
[1:28:56] in the book of revelation we found out
[1:28:58] there was a
[1:28:59] woman i saw a woman that was supposed to
[1:29:03] be my mother
[1:29:04] only she didn't look like my mother
[1:29:07] natural mother
[1:29:08] and this man was very mean to his wife
[1:29:12] and he had a three-corner stick where he
[1:29:15] had cleft his wood
[1:29:17] you know and a chop of wood across a log
[1:29:20] you know it makes a three-corner stick
[1:29:23] and every time
[1:29:24] this woman will start to stand up he
[1:29:26] just grab her by the neck
[1:29:28] and hit her on her head and knocks her
[1:29:31] out
[1:29:33] a man with his wife but abusing his wife
[1:29:37] that's the dream brother branham saw
[1:29:39] what does he mean by the brand
[1:29:42] but the problem said he was supposed to
[1:29:44] be his
[1:29:45] mother the woman represent
[1:29:48] the church of the world today
[1:29:52] all the world i was born
[1:29:56] right in this
[1:30:00] so brother branham also was born
[1:30:04] under a mercy woman
[1:30:06] [Applause]
[1:30:10] and here i am she's supposed to be kind
[1:30:14] of my mother
[1:30:15] of a mother she was a
[1:30:18] mother of what
[1:30:22] so brother branham also was born
[1:30:25] in babylon
[1:30:30] but yet i was born right into it
[1:30:34] like zero babel her husband
[1:30:37] is the denomination that ruled over her
[1:30:40] the three cornersticks she that she had
[1:30:44] is a trying baptism in first
[1:30:47] name brother branham the woman
[1:30:51] represented the church of the world i
[1:30:53] was
[1:30:54] born right in this mess the mess
[1:30:57] that is in that she is in she was
[1:31:00] supposed to be kind of a mother
[1:31:03] she was the mother of what
[1:31:06] so cerebral bear was born in babylon
[1:31:10] born in a mess
[1:31:14] but of the lineage of christ
[1:31:18] and brother branham also says
[1:31:21] that god gave him a vision and he was
[1:31:24] born
[1:31:25] under babylon
[1:31:30] so robert bell was a governor
[1:31:34] a governor what does he mean
[1:31:37] take matthew chapter 2.
[1:31:41] i'm sorry keep your bible
[1:31:46] the bible say when the foundation is
[1:31:48] shaken
[1:31:49] what can the righteous do
[1:31:53] that's why we need to make sure the
[1:31:55] foundation is stable
[1:31:57] solid matthew chapter 2
[1:32:00] verse 6 if you dare you can say amen
[1:32:05] and you bethlehem in the land of what
[1:32:10] again judah judah
[1:32:13] are you not the least among the princes
[1:32:16] of who
[1:32:17] judah for all of you shall come uh
[1:32:22] a governor that shall rule mine
[1:32:25] so jesus christ was also a governor
[1:32:32] brother stephen said a government that
[1:32:35] shall
[1:32:36] rule so a governor
[1:32:39] is somebody that rules
[1:32:43] it is somebody that is called a priest
[1:32:47] we following me
[1:32:50] take luke 20 20.
[1:32:57] jesus was a governor
[1:33:00] so robert bell was a governor
[1:33:04] so robert came under the lineage of
[1:33:07] christ
[1:33:09] who was the big governor
[1:33:14] a governor and the governor
[1:33:19] so robert ben was a governor jesus was
[1:33:23] the governor hey governor
[1:33:27] be governor hey son of man
[1:33:30] be son of man
[1:33:35] luke 20 20. if you dare you can say amen
[1:33:39] praise the lord and they watch him
[1:33:42] and send forth spies the pharisee which
[1:33:45] should fan themself
[1:33:47] just men hypocrite that they might take
[1:33:50] hold of his word
[1:33:52] so they were looking to accuse jesus
[1:33:55] that so
[1:33:56] they might deliver him to the
[1:34:00] power everybody see
[1:34:03] and authority of the
[1:34:07] so a governor is somebody that has
[1:34:10] power and authority
[1:34:13] are you following me now that governor
[1:34:16] came from judah
[1:34:20] what does he mean judah
[1:34:23] in revelation 2 9 brother branham is
[1:34:26] interpreting this scripture
[1:34:28] another works in tribulation and poverty
[1:34:31] but they are
[1:34:32] rich and i know the blasphemy of them
[1:34:34] that say they are jews
[1:34:36] and are not but are the synagogue of
[1:34:38] what
[1:34:39] satan to begin with
[1:34:42] the word jew does not describe
[1:34:46] the religion of the jewish people
[1:34:49] he refer only to the people of
[1:34:53] judah and has the same
[1:34:58] precise the same
[1:35:01] priestess meaning
[1:35:04] if i were to say i am
[1:35:07] irish born
[1:35:11] brother branham said the jew the tribe
[1:35:14] of judah
[1:35:15] is the true jews are you there
[1:35:19] and it's the same way that they call me
[1:35:23] i am an irish why did brother branham
[1:35:27] say
[1:35:28] irish close to judah
[1:35:34] when i was a liberal i was irish
[1:35:39] of course my conversion did not change
[1:35:43] that too much
[1:35:45] so when you are born in your country
[1:35:48] you're gonna be born under a certain
[1:35:50] influence
[1:35:52] the influence from your country and the
[1:35:54] influence from your family
[1:35:56] but when the holy ghost comes the holy
[1:36:00] ghost
[1:36:00] doesn't change you completely
[1:36:04] if you are an american you will continue
[1:36:06] to eat pizza
[1:36:08] if you are an african you will continue
[1:36:11] to eat fufu
[1:36:13] but both of you have the holy ghost
[1:36:16] the holy ghost only clean up the part
[1:36:19] that is wrong
[1:36:22] are you there so brother branham say
[1:36:25] he was born irish so there were stuff
[1:36:29] in irish that are very important for the
[1:36:32] ministry of brother branham
[1:36:35] but drinking like irish
[1:36:38] like his father that sad the holy ghost
[1:36:41] clean up and brother branham said that
[1:36:44] my conversion did not change that too
[1:36:48] much
[1:36:49] he kept certain things from the irish
[1:36:52] but he removed others
[1:36:57] i was an irish and my conversion didn't
[1:37:01] change that too much
[1:37:02] someone said do you think there is a
[1:37:05] change for
[1:37:06] a nourishment i said yes
[1:37:10] there is one of them in heaven his name
[1:37:14] is what brother branham said
[1:37:17] the nature of my god lynch ginger
[1:37:21] it is an irish nature
[1:37:30] you're gonna smell the message you're
[1:37:32] gonna think the message
[1:37:34] you're gonna talk the message you're
[1:37:36] gonna leave the message
[1:37:41] are you there no more playing games
[1:37:44] no skim milk in this church solid food
[1:37:52] are you there the nature of michael
[1:37:56] that temple of fighting are you there
[1:37:59] god did the problem to have that
[1:38:08] why did you get a brother branham it is
[1:38:11] from heaven
[1:38:12] there is one called micah and the
[1:38:16] shout at the voice of thee
[1:38:26] second miracle this is the way
[1:38:30] heaven will be they shall be german
[1:38:34] finns italian and even
[1:38:38] irish will be there amen
[1:38:42] i say i know there is one day they call
[1:38:46] him
[1:38:46] michael
[1:38:52] why is the nature of the entire
[1:38:55] messenger
[1:38:56] matches michael and when
[1:39:00] the lord shall descend with a shout
[1:39:03] with a voice of the archangel michael is
[1:39:06] coming down
[1:39:07] because there must be a one
[1:39:11] with the same caliber the same nature
[1:39:15] as michael
[1:39:23] jews are from judah tech roman chapter
[1:39:27] 2.
[1:39:29] who is this zerubbabel
[1:39:35] who is this zerubbabel
[1:39:38] romans 2 chapter 28 if you're there you
[1:39:42] can say amen
[1:39:45] you heard the robot there's a robot
[1:39:47] let's lay it down
[1:39:52] roman 2 are you there verse 28
[1:39:56] for he is not earth which is one of the
[1:40:00] outworldly in other words not somebody
[1:40:03] who's
[1:40:03] by blood jewish is jew this is park
[1:40:07] saying that
[1:40:08] are you there neither is that
[1:40:10] circumcision
[1:40:11] which is outwardly in the flesh but he
[1:40:14] is a jew
[1:40:15] in other words the jew which is what
[1:40:20] are you there and circumcision is that
[1:40:24] of the
[1:40:25] heart in the spirit and not of the
[1:40:27] letter
[1:40:28] whose presence is not of men but of god
[1:40:31] paul is telling us that the true jew
[1:40:34] are not the people of judah in israel
[1:40:38] the true jew are the jews in
[1:40:41] heart are you there
[1:40:45] and we found out that the jews
[1:40:48] were the brethren of jeroboam
[1:40:52] jorah babel was from judah jeroboam was
[1:40:56] a jew
[1:40:58] he has also his other brother jews
[1:41:01] but he was just elevated in a position
[1:41:06] higher than his brother jews
[1:41:10] he's a part of the brother he is your
[1:41:13] brother
[1:41:14] he is your precious brother he only have
[1:41:18] a position of leadership amen
[1:41:27] i have seen her when i seen her this
[1:41:30] time
[1:41:31] she looked the same way and i was
[1:41:34] sitting there on this place
[1:41:35] brother brother i'm talking about the
[1:41:36] vision beyond the curtain of them
[1:41:39] and i said i don't understand this you
[1:41:42] put me up here
[1:41:43] so brother brandon when he went in the
[1:41:45] sixth dimension
[1:41:47] he began to hug people when they asked
[1:41:51] him he said you know what
[1:41:52] if they're gonna judge paul they're
[1:41:55] gonna judge
[1:41:56] me also ah my people will enter
[1:41:59] because i preach like paul that was
[1:42:03] before the opening of the seals
[1:42:06] if you go back in the sixth dimension
[1:42:08] today
[1:42:10] and you ask brother branham that same
[1:42:12] question
[1:42:13] he's gonna answer you differently he's
[1:42:16] gonna tell you
[1:42:17] not only did that preach like paul but i
[1:42:20] also
[1:42:21] opened the seals and brought the book of
[1:42:24] redemption down
[1:42:25] i preach more than power
[1:42:32] not at this time at this time it's more
[1:42:35] than power
[1:42:40] and when he went there brother branham
[1:42:42] hug people
[1:42:43] after a while they pick him up they go
[1:42:46] with him
[1:42:47] into a higher place they're putting them
[1:42:50] on them say wait a minute why do you put
[1:42:52] me in the position
[1:42:54] of a leader why do you put me
[1:42:58] in the position of a governor
[1:43:02] [Music]
[1:43:04] who is this is a robber
[1:43:08] you was a leader
[1:43:11] you were born a leader
[1:43:15] to lead the people i said don't mind
[1:43:19] well this is perfection say this is like
[1:43:22] a patriarch
[1:43:23] when they were gathered with there when
[1:43:26] you die
[1:43:27] you are gathered with your messenger and
[1:43:30] that messenger
[1:43:32] is your governor
[1:43:40] and just then a voice was went to
[1:43:42] talking to me
[1:43:44] i never did see the voice he said you
[1:43:46] have been gathered
[1:43:47] you have been gathered to your people
[1:43:50] and
[1:43:51] so and then some men pick me up
[1:43:54] set me way up on the big
[1:43:58] i think like this i said
[1:44:01] why do you do that said enough
[1:44:05] you was here
[1:44:09] everybody there and we found out in the
[1:44:12] book of hagai
[1:44:14] let's go back now in her guide chapter
[1:44:17] one
[1:44:18] lord help me to finish this
[1:44:21] everybody there go back to her guy
[1:44:24] chapter one
[1:44:25] if you dare you can say amen in the
[1:44:28] second year of the riots
[1:44:29] the king in the sixth month in the first
[1:44:32] day of the month
[1:44:33] came the word of the lord to her guide
[1:44:35] the prophet to who
[1:44:37] jeroboam you begin to get preacher about
[1:44:39] jeroboam
[1:44:40] born in babylon a governor of judah the
[1:44:43] son of sheldon
[1:44:44] governor of judah and to joshua
[1:44:48] everybody see there the son of jose deck
[1:44:51] their high priest
[1:44:55] so joshua is a high priest
[1:44:59] so this ministry of zerubbabel
[1:45:03] is couple it's connected to
[1:45:06] joshua we know that when moses was under
[1:45:11] his ministry
[1:45:12] moses also was connected with joshua
[1:45:17] are you there but joshua entered the
[1:45:20] promised land
[1:45:21] and moses was left out
[1:45:25] but with zoroable both
[1:45:28] joshua and zola babel entered the
[1:45:31] promised land
[1:45:36] joshua the high priest
[1:45:39] joshua who are you joshua was a type of
[1:45:43] who
[1:45:46] so jorah babe is not jesus
[1:45:50] he's a governor jesus is the
[1:45:53] governor but when he worked he worked
[1:45:56] with
[1:45:57] joshua
[1:46:01] joshua was a type of jesus because
[1:46:04] joshua means
[1:46:05] jehovah savior he was a type of
[1:46:09] jesus and as he sat there to begin to
[1:46:13] think
[1:46:14] yes and i remember the great warrior
[1:46:16] joshua
[1:46:17] hi how my mother used to say honey just
[1:46:20] across there
[1:46:22] just at the fourth right down there
[1:46:23] below the city
[1:46:25] joshua the great maori warrior who took
[1:46:27] moses place
[1:46:29] a top officer
[1:46:32] at top of the holy spirit now
[1:46:35] moses didn't bring the children into the
[1:46:37] promised land
[1:46:38] he wants the lord given but didn't bring
[1:46:41] the children in the promised land
[1:46:43] joshua took them over see and the holy
[1:46:46] spirit
[1:46:46] is the one that is taking them over now
[1:46:50] so the robber bear is working
[1:46:53] with joshua
[1:46:56] joshua at the top of the holy spirit
[1:47:00] why is joshua a high priest
[1:47:03] take hebrew
[1:47:08] because the first leadership priesthood
[1:47:11] came from the tribe of aaron
[1:47:15] are you there but when jesus christ died
[1:47:18] that priesthood was destroyed that's why
[1:47:21] when jesus went in front of kfs
[1:47:23] [Music]
[1:47:26] caiaphas took his cross and ripped them
[1:47:29] and once a high priest represents
[1:47:32] he is disqualified because the
[1:47:35] melchizedek
[1:47:36] priesthood was already coming in
[1:47:43] take hebrew seven bear with me give me
[1:47:48] time hebrew chapter 7
[1:47:52] verse 11 if you dare you can say amen
[1:47:55] if therefore perfection were by the
[1:47:58] levitical priesthood
[1:47:59] for under it the people received the law
[1:48:02] what father need was there that another
[1:48:04] priest should rise
[1:48:06] after the order of melchizedek and not
[1:48:08] be called after the order of aaron
[1:48:10] paul is saying that if persuasion was
[1:48:12] under the law
[1:48:13] why do we need grace we need grace
[1:48:16] because perfection was not
[1:48:18] under the law we already preached you
[1:48:20] that
[1:48:22] are you there because the blood of bulls
[1:48:24] and god could not bring the worshiper
[1:48:26] into
[1:48:27] perfection it took the blood of christ a
[1:48:30] high priest under the order of
[1:48:32] melchizedek let's go verse 12.
[1:48:35] for the priesthood being changed there
[1:48:38] is made a necessity of change also of
[1:48:40] the law
[1:48:41] so we got to move from the lord to the
[1:48:42] bible
[1:48:44] the altar must be built according to the
[1:48:47] bible
[1:48:50] okay for all he of whom
[1:48:53] these things spoken pretend to uh
[1:48:56] neither trump the priesthood was coming
[1:48:59] from
[1:49:00] aaron you who are you aaron liver
[1:49:03] aaron liver errol liver but for some
[1:49:06] reason
[1:49:06] when melchizedek comes he doesn't go
[1:49:11] through aaron he choose a different
[1:49:14] trouble
[1:49:19] pretend to a trouble to another tribe
[1:49:22] of which no man gave attendance at the
[1:49:25] altar
[1:49:26] nobody from this tribe was permitted to
[1:49:30] work on the altar which tribe is it
[1:49:33] verse 14 for it is evident that
[1:49:37] our lord sprang out of what
[1:49:41] you understand you understand that
[1:49:45] and zorro babe came also from the tribe
[1:49:48] of
[1:49:49] he's under the lineage of melchizedek
[1:49:58] of which tribe moses spoke
[1:50:01] nothing concerning priesthood he was
[1:50:04] still
[1:50:05] under the seven seals
[1:50:10] and it is yet far more evident for that
[1:50:13] after the simulator of melchizedek
[1:50:17] there rises another priest
[1:50:20] who is made not after the lord of
[1:50:23] colonel's commandment
[1:50:24] but after the power of endless life
[1:50:27] he doesn't die the high priest
[1:50:31] died the high priest died when jesus
[1:50:34] died rose again
[1:50:35] he doesn't die in other words they
[1:50:37] cannot change him
[1:50:38] that's why he's the high priest that can
[1:50:40] be touched by the feeling of our
[1:50:46] the high priest
[1:50:49] brother man i'm saying the unfailing of
[1:50:51] god
[1:50:52] notice that he came first as prophet and
[1:50:55] they crucified him
[1:50:57] when jesus christ came jesus had three
[1:51:00] tattles
[1:51:01] he is called son of man
[1:51:05] he's called son of man
[1:51:08] which means prophet
[1:51:12] he's called son of god
[1:51:15] everybody there which means a priest
[1:51:19] or the priesthood
[1:51:22] and he's called son of david
[1:51:26] which is called he's a king
[1:51:30] melchizedek was priest and
[1:51:34] king are you there so melchizedek
[1:51:38] is the priesthood are you there
[1:51:42] hello so he came first as the prophet
[1:51:45] and they crucified him his own crucify
[1:51:48] him
[1:51:48] he came as the son of man a prophet
[1:51:52] then after the holy spirit came he was
[1:51:54] the
[1:51:55] son of god god is a spirit he was the
[1:51:59] holy ghost
[1:51:59] the holy spirit son of god he lived
[1:52:02] through there
[1:52:03] so throughout the church jesus
[1:52:07] jesus is a high priest he is a high
[1:52:10] priest after
[1:52:12] melchizedek are you there and it is
[1:52:15] under
[1:52:16] the high priest under the seventh church
[1:52:20] ages
[1:52:21] under the dispensation of the gentile
[1:52:23] that
[1:52:24] zoro babyliss boner
[1:52:30] are you there in the millennium he will
[1:52:32] be son of david
[1:52:34] sitting upon the throne of his father
[1:52:36] remember between son of god
[1:52:39] in love this year church
[1:52:42] a priesthood they put him out
[1:52:45] he's outside knocking in luke he said he
[1:52:49] will be revealed
[1:52:50] again as son of man the prophet
[1:52:53] fulfilling the rest of it
[1:52:54] the scripture dies perfectly son of man
[1:52:58] son of god son of david what is it it's
[1:53:01] the same god
[1:53:02] all the time just changing his form
[1:53:06] e more faith
[1:53:12] after his death burial resurrection
[1:53:16] he came on the day of pentecost
[1:53:19] as son of god a priesthood melchizedek
[1:53:23] the spirit in the form the holy ghost
[1:53:27] what was he doing he was changing
[1:53:29] himself
[1:53:30] making himself known to his people in a
[1:53:33] different form
[1:53:35] the holy spirit which is god he came to
[1:53:38] deal
[1:53:38] through the church ages as son of god
[1:53:42] the holy spirit so
[1:53:45] here we find out that joshua the holy
[1:53:48] ghost
[1:53:49] is working with jeroboam
[1:53:53] everybody there under the churches
[1:53:57] help me up that is the reason tonight
[1:54:01] starting this exodus of the church i
[1:54:04] believe that we are
[1:54:05] in there we are in the exodus again i
[1:54:08] believe
[1:54:08] moses being a perfect type of the
[1:54:11] church organization which fell
[1:54:14] moses worked with joshua but
[1:54:18] moses could not take the people to the
[1:54:20] promised land but
[1:54:22] not jorah babel so robert took the
[1:54:25] people
[1:54:26] and with joshua entering to the promised
[1:54:29] land
[1:54:29] without any problem what are you trying
[1:54:32] to say
[1:54:34] joshua took israel across the promised
[1:54:37] land
[1:54:38] perfect if you watch it how that god
[1:54:41] moved back there in the days
[1:54:43] what are you trying to say brother
[1:54:45] stephen like moses
[1:54:48] was the church age that brought them to
[1:54:50] santa to their theology
[1:54:52] of last night moses was not permitted to
[1:54:54] take the children of israel
[1:54:56] over in the promised land because he had
[1:54:58] failed the church organization
[1:55:01] denomination has failed they shall not
[1:55:04] touch the church over god will raise up
[1:55:08] a new system
[1:55:11] not moses another system with joshua
[1:55:15] the system of zero babel are you there
[1:55:19] an interdenominational system
[1:55:23] by the power of god he would take the
[1:55:26] church in the promised land
[1:55:28] organization and denomination has messed
[1:55:30] it up
[1:55:31] each one after their own theology each
[1:55:33] one after their own way of thinking
[1:55:36] but god will take his
[1:55:39] joshua and he will raise his
[1:55:42] joshuas that will take the church
[1:55:46] to the promise with no denomination or
[1:55:49] string
[1:55:49] tied anywhere that will take his church
[1:55:53] over joshua was called
[1:55:57] the capstone comes with what
[1:56:03] what are you trying to say what i'm
[1:56:06] trying to say is this
[1:56:09] every three years a great meeting
[1:56:13] what takes place a denomination but the
[1:56:16] problem says that
[1:56:18] every time god starts something big
[1:56:22] every time god starts a big move
[1:56:25] after three years it becomes a
[1:56:27] denomination
[1:56:29] even moses became a denomination
[1:56:32] but not zoro babel are you there
[1:56:37] this is 20 years no denomination
[1:56:42] dear dying lamb may never do that
[1:56:45] if i go in this generation if i die
[1:56:49] may the people who believe this message
[1:56:52] never stand still for a denomination
[1:56:57] are you there when a preacher begin to
[1:57:00] play around
[1:57:02] don't stand still get out
[1:57:04] [Applause]
[1:57:05] [Music]
[1:57:09] you shall die right in your truck
[1:57:12] remember that the very hour that you
[1:57:14] mentioned denomination among you
[1:57:16] i don't care how sincere you are take a
[1:57:19] man
[1:57:20] for your leader instead of the holy
[1:57:22] spirit to confirm
[1:57:24] this word that is the hour you die
[1:57:28] you don't need a preacher to confirm the
[1:57:31] message
[1:57:34] you don't need the preacher to tell you
[1:57:36] whether the message is
[1:57:38] right or not you need the holy ghost
[1:57:41] to confirm the message
[1:57:48] the day you gonna allow a pastor a
[1:57:51] preacher to confirm to you this message
[1:57:54] you die
[1:57:55] [Applause]
[1:58:00] we play too much
[1:58:03] for there is a new message coming forth
[1:58:06] a new thing try to hold it over
[1:58:10] but that's been the attitude of the
[1:58:12] church a revolver goes forth
[1:58:14] and defense things you know within about
[1:58:16] three years they start an organization
[1:58:18] over
[1:58:19] a denominational style organization but
[1:58:22] have you noticed
[1:58:24] this has been sweeping for 20 years now
[1:58:28] and there is no organization
[1:58:31] and there will never will be
[1:58:36] this is the end
[1:58:38] [Applause]
[1:58:40] you can become a denomination but the
[1:58:43] message will
[1:58:44] never be a denomination
[1:58:48] [Music]
[1:58:50] you can die not the message
[1:58:54] it's up to you to take choice and follow
[1:58:56] the message
[1:58:58] this time moses stay out
[1:59:02] joshua enter but with zola babe there is
[1:59:05] no denomination
[1:59:06] because joshua is always working with
[1:59:09] him
[1:59:11] him and joshua entered the promised land
[1:59:14] no denomination
[1:59:16] nobody left out no children left out no

[2:02:16] land and i will shake our nation
[2:02:19] and the desire of all nations shall come
[2:02:22] and i will
[2:02:22] fill this house with what
[2:02:27] with glowing so in the words of
[2:02:30] a bell restore the temple god is gonna
[2:02:34] fill the house
[2:02:38] are you following me with glory
[2:02:41] the silver is mine and god this man said
[2:02:44] the lord
[2:02:45] watch verse nine the glory of this
[2:02:48] latter house
[2:02:49] shall be greater than of the former
[2:02:53] so once the robber will rebuild the
[2:02:55] temple
[2:02:56] the glory of that tabernacle will be
[2:03:00] greater than the time of solomon
[2:03:03] but we have a problem you ready
[2:03:07] we have a problem brother pranam
[2:03:10] god came into the sanctuary that was to
[2:03:13] be anointed
[2:03:14] and was giving over to him for the
[2:03:16] people to come to worship that
[2:03:17] solomon so to anoint the holy
[2:03:21] but to are not the most holy place and
[2:03:23] we will notice
[2:03:25] that new jerusalem is the most
[2:03:28] holy you're following me god
[2:03:31] spoke that god according to daniel
[2:03:34] he will come and anoint the most holy
[2:03:38] brother brother said the most holy is
[2:03:41] new jerusalem
[2:03:43] and the anointing will be upon the new
[2:03:45] jerusalem
[2:03:46] that descend from god out of heaven
[2:03:49] prepare us a brother dawn for a husband
[2:03:51] remember last sunday when the angels say
[2:03:54] let me show you the brad
[2:03:56] he showed him what a city and we found
[2:03:58] out
[2:03:59] that that city was a woman because
[2:04:01] ephesus is a city
[2:04:03] smyrna is a city permanent is a city
[2:04:06] now this is a city all the church edges
[2:04:09] a city
[2:04:10] but the broad also is a city which is
[2:04:12] called the new
[2:04:14] jerusalem remember that now
[2:04:17] zwanzero babel dedicated his temple
[2:04:20] after he was rebuilt he was not anointed
[2:04:24] again
[2:04:25] god says that once the robber will
[2:04:28] rebuild the temple
[2:04:29] i will anoint it and that anointing will
[2:04:32] be greater
[2:04:34] but when zoroba debuted the temple which
[2:04:37] was the natural
[2:04:38] god did it anointed so which temple
[2:04:42] is zoro babel rebuilding
[2:04:46] are you there because he was already
[2:04:50] being anointed
[2:04:51] and been told that it was just
[2:04:54] instructed again
[2:04:55] the destruction has come to it it's been
[2:04:58] instructed again
[2:04:59] and put up so there was no anointing of
[2:05:01] it anymore
[2:05:02] when he was one time anointed that
[2:05:04] carried through and it goes
[2:05:06] until the very time see
[2:05:10] brother brother the city he goes ahead
[2:05:13] and say which is the new jerusalem
[2:05:16] the new jerusalem i shall put him i
[2:05:19] shall put on him
[2:05:20] the new jerusalem the bride or the
[2:05:23] church is there
[2:05:25] how many knows that the church itself is
[2:05:28] there
[2:05:29] you understand it now are we there
[2:05:32] we're clear now so there is an anointing
[2:05:35] that daniel say
[2:05:37] that must be anointed on the new
[2:05:40] jerusalem
[2:05:41] and when god spoke people thought when
[2:05:44] the natural zero bad comes when he
[2:05:47] rebuilt the temple
[2:05:48] that anointing would drop no anointing
[2:05:51] job but god said i will
[2:05:53] fill the temple of zorobabel who is
[2:05:56] zoro babel are you there
[2:06:00] we have three temples the temple of
[2:06:03] solomon was built
[2:06:05] destroyed by babylon and rebuilt again
[2:06:08] by jeroboam
[2:06:09] are you following me jesus also was the
[2:06:12] temple of god
[2:06:14] and jesus was destroyed by rome
[2:06:18] are you there because jesus said
[2:06:20] destroyed this
[2:06:22] and i would build it in he was talking
[2:06:25] about his death
[2:06:26] and are you there and when jesus
[2:06:30] resurrected the mighty angel came down
[2:06:35] are you there to pull jesus from the
[2:06:38] grave
[2:06:40] you're following me and then the other
[2:06:42] temple
[2:06:43] in the temple of in the book of fate
[2:06:46] on the day of pentecost we found a 120
[2:06:50] temple and what happened babylon
[2:06:53] entering
[2:06:54] through the berkelen the palmer they're
[2:06:57] all the stuff
[2:06:58] and destroyed and we found together the
[2:07:01] mighty angel come down again
[2:07:03] temple destruction of babylon zero baby
[2:07:07] temple destruction of rome babylon
[2:07:10] rebuilding again
[2:07:11] and jesus when he was rebuilding he had
[2:07:13] a glorified
[2:07:15] body a body higher than the first body
[2:07:18] and the blood also was destroyed where
[2:07:22] they started at pentecost
[2:07:23] destroyed but down the road there is a
[2:07:26] restoration
[2:07:28] i will send you elijah the prophet
[2:07:34] in revelation chapter 10 we shall get
[2:07:37] into the 30 minutes
[2:07:39] in the days of the message of the seven
[2:07:41] angel the mystery of god ought to be
[2:07:44] finished here is the question if you
[2:07:47] follow in that line in this hour
[2:07:49] will it be finished will i find faith
[2:07:52] will have fun with malachi 4
[2:07:55] fulfilling this time brother branham
[2:07:57] said when jesus was asking will i find
[2:08:00] faith what he was meaning that faith was
[2:08:02] malachi
[2:08:06] 4.
[2:08:08] the way god has through his churches
[2:08:11] from justification sanctification
[2:08:13] baptism of the holy ghost and now
[2:08:16] the ministry of the spirit which what
[2:08:18] which is what quickened the
[2:08:20] word that ministry in the church will
[2:08:23] have to be just exactly like
[2:08:25] his everybody there we found three
[2:08:28] temple

[2:08:32] destruction restoration
[2:08:34] temple destruction restoration because
[2:08:37] god
[2:08:37] does now are we there
[2:08:41] now let's finish zoro babel you tell me
[2:08:44] why brother john
[2:08:46] i saw you giving me a son okay praise
[2:08:49] the lord so let me be free
[2:08:51] i thought he was giving me a sign are
[2:08:53] you there
[2:08:54] we found out that zoro papa did three
[2:08:56] things
[2:08:58] number one we stored the brazen altar
[2:09:01] number two he restored the foundation
[2:09:04] number three he bring the headstone
[2:09:08] are you there the bride's an altar
[2:09:12] god's brass altar of judgment and you
[2:09:15] want to be born again
[2:09:18] just lay yourself upon there don't
[2:09:20] expect to pick it up again
[2:09:22] you are going to die that's the end of
[2:09:24] you that's all
[2:09:25] if you don't do that if you don't feel
[2:09:27] like it you can
[2:09:29] do that you can do you can do that don't
[2:09:32] don't try it
[2:09:32] it won't work deeply sincerely with
[2:09:36] about 10 pages more of this lesson here
[2:09:38] and more scripture are quit
[2:09:40] but lay yourself on god's brothers and
[2:09:42] altar
[2:09:43] of god's judgment and become just as
[2:09:45] dead
[2:09:46] to the word as christ was i'm gonna
[2:09:48] explain you this
[2:09:50] then we confess our sins before thee
[2:09:54] and land them on that blood as an altar
[2:09:56] of judgment
[2:09:57] and ask that the blood of christ take
[2:10:00] them away
[2:10:01] in the sacrifice that was made so the
[2:10:04] brazen altar
[2:10:05] was the altar where they were killing
[2:10:07] the sacrifice
[2:10:08] he was speaking about the atonement
[2:10:11] which
[2:10:12] happened on calvary so the beginning
[2:10:15] of the ministry of the robber bell he's
[2:10:18] gonna begin to preach
[2:10:20] divine healing because the atonement has
[2:10:23] healing and salvation you will see when
[2:10:26] zoro babel begin to work
[2:10:28] at the beginning of his ministry under
[2:10:31] the first pool
[2:10:32] he's more preaching healing and bringing
[2:10:34] souls to christ
[2:10:36] preaching healing and accepting jesus
[2:10:38] christ as your savior
[2:10:39] preaching healing and accepting jesus
[2:10:41] christ as a servant
[2:10:43] he was the rebuilding of the altar
[2:10:47] you're following me okay vada branham
[2:10:51] there is not a devil in hell that can
[2:10:53] touch you
[2:10:55] if you believe that you are covered by
[2:10:57] the blood you are surrendered by prayer
[2:11:00] ministers of the gospel and messenger of
[2:11:02] the covenant prayer
[2:11:03] every one of you standing here come up
[2:11:06] knowing that you had
[2:11:07] habits fault and things that you were
[2:11:09] ashamed of
[2:11:10] if you now lay them on god's bra as an
[2:11:13] altar of judgment
[2:11:15] and will accept it now as your pardon
[2:11:18] and christ give it to you will you make
[2:11:20] an offer by faith to rise up
[2:11:22] to raise up your hand and say are now
[2:11:25] accepted
[2:11:26] it's gone and from this day i shall
[2:11:28] never do it again
[2:11:29] you are saved by the blood of god so the
[2:11:32] brazen altar
[2:11:34] is the bringing of people to salvation
[2:11:37] that's what brother branham start with
[2:11:39] it first
[2:11:40] are you there then after that we found
[2:11:43] that the foundation was laid
[2:11:46] and brother problem said i laid the
[2:11:48] foundation
[2:11:49] the pentecostal the baptist the
[2:11:51] presbyterian
[2:11:52] don't want to do anything with it
[2:11:54] they're rejecting the
[2:11:56] cornerstone and the foundation was the
[2:11:59] genuine baptism of the holy ghost
[2:12:02] when it comes some people are crying
[2:12:05] some people
[2:12:06] are rejoicing everybody following me
[2:12:09] now brother brother says someone asked
[2:12:11] me to repeat that in hebrew again
[2:12:13] in job chapter 2 28
[2:12:16] where he is picking off the coming of
[2:12:18] the former and lateral
[2:12:21] there is two run that was promising job
[2:12:24] it is the former end and the laddering
[2:12:27] the former reign comes to do something
[2:12:31] but the lagaran comes to bring maturity
[2:12:36] the former wren in hebrew word murray
[2:12:39] murray which means what that's why
[2:12:43] after the healing you will find out that
[2:12:45] brother branham begin to teach more
[2:12:48] what is the holy ghost what was the holy
[2:12:50] ghost giving for
[2:12:51] how you can receive all this teaching
[2:12:54] beginning to come
[2:12:55] it was the pouring of the first rain
[2:12:58] but not the laddering the ladder rain
[2:13:01] have to come with the opening
[2:13:03] of the hills are you there
[2:13:07] it shall be a teaching rain and a
[2:13:08] harvest rain now
[2:13:10] we have had the teaching rain and we are
[2:13:13] ready now for that
[2:13:15] watch he which year 62 and the seals
[2:13:19] were broken in which year
[2:13:22] so he's telling you we had the former
[2:13:24] end
[2:13:25] we are already led the foundation now we
[2:13:28] need the headstone
[2:13:30] are you following me praise the lord you
[2:13:33] know the first rain is when you plant
[2:13:35] the seed
[2:13:36] that starts your crop growing then just
[2:13:40] before we mature
[2:13:41] then come another crop that is what they
[2:13:44] call the harvest rain
[2:13:45] we know that the spring rain and then
[2:13:48] the rain about june
[2:13:49] it makes your crop now the rain we found
[2:13:51] out was what
[2:13:53] so there is they are pouring off the
[2:13:55] spirit to
[2:13:56] put the seed but later on the same holy
[2:13:59] spirit comes
[2:14:00] to unveil the word everybody following
[2:14:02] me
[2:14:03] now we found out that when joabel brings
[2:14:07] the headstone
[2:14:08] in his hand there is a plummet
[2:14:17] the head of zorro babe this planet is
[2:14:20] called also
[2:14:21] the prime line what is it
[2:14:25] what is the cause of this
[2:14:27] misunderstanding
[2:14:29] the answer is what brother branham said
[2:14:33] the trouble
[2:14:34] we have today is because of
[2:14:37] experience ah i have an experience with
[2:14:41] god
[2:14:41] i met the pillar of fire i did this this
[2:14:44] this
[2:14:45] the misunderstanding today we have gone
[2:14:49] by experience
[2:14:51] and not duh tell me your experience
[2:14:56] but your experience much much must
[2:14:59] match the world you cannot
[2:15:02] have an experience today and later on
[2:15:06] you reject the message
[2:15:08] we need to verify your experience
[2:15:14] are you there a way we've experienced us
[2:15:20] measuring are you there
[2:15:23] i have an experience fine let's see your
[2:15:26] life
[2:15:26] matching the world are you there
[2:15:30] i have an experience i met the pillar of
[2:15:32] fire
[2:15:33] and later on you reject that same pillar
[2:15:35] of fire
[2:15:36] check your experience
[2:15:40] are you there there is only one
[2:15:47] you didn't read there is only one
[2:15:51] one plummet one plumb line
[2:15:54] only one and that is the
[2:15:59] so the planet in the hand of
[2:16:03] babel is the word
[2:16:07] are you there and in sabino canyon
[2:16:11] when brother branham was praying he put
[2:16:14] his hand up
[2:16:15] and suddenly the sword hit his hand
[2:16:19] which was the planet
[2:16:24] we are measuring you by the sword
[2:16:27] by the world by the planet
[2:16:31] we are building the church by the sword
[2:16:37] hallelujah brother branham satan you
[2:16:40] lost
[2:16:41] we are coming over now we are marching
[2:16:44] over
[2:16:44] in the promised land because we are
[2:16:47] going zoro babel

[2:17:01] plane
[2:17:02] why is zoro babel destroying you
[2:17:07] with her two age sold
[2:17:11] we shall chop hell to them
[2:17:17] that's why when the devil attacked jesus
[2:17:21] jesus never told the devil i had an
[2:17:24] experience
[2:17:25] in jordan the devil started
[2:17:29] jesus just pull it it is written
