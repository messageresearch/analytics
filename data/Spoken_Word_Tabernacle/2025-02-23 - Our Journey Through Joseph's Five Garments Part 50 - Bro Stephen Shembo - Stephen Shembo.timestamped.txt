[48:51] you
[48:52] responsible for the material that was
[48:55] delivered are we together am so these
[48:58] are very difficult and tough and very
[49:01] tough subject when it comes to vow and
[49:04] everything like I say I am preaching to
[49:06] the young people I don't want to come
[49:08] and deal with a divorce I'm going one
[49:11] time you go there and then we finish
[49:13] with seal it the next day we see you in
[49:16] the Rapture you and your husband and
[49:18] your children over there I'm dealing
[49:19] with the old generation that that didn't
[49:23] have the teaching that you have and I'm
[49:25] even giving you things that me myself as
[49:28] a pastor didn't even know amen I didn't
[49:31] know that brother Bram did a proposal
[49:32] under the tree all of those are in the
[49:35] court over there amen and me have to
[49:38] correct brother Bram about the proposal
[49:40] and tell him you don't put a ring on me
[49:42] until you talk to my parent I got the
[49:44] quote over
[49:45] [Applause]
[49:46] there I got the quote over there amen I
[49:50] gave you all the quotes the quotes are
[49:53] over there amen like I said if a young
[49:56] man was not tou like you you have a
[49:59] responsibility to recalibrate the young
[50:01] man and bring him back again online amen
[50:05] every single quat is over there for free
[50:08] so that has been said amen there is no
[50:13] fcet there is no problem now amen I'm
[50:17] saying this before something comes up
[50:20] because some people wait till there is a
[50:22] problem and they run on the problem and
[50:24] say I'm going to leave the church but
[50:26] they already purpose to leave the church
[50:27] they were waiting for a problem so there
[50:29] is no problem now okay there is no
[50:32] problem now so
[50:34] parent everything that I have been
[50:37] teaching this children they gaed I print
[50:40] out everything and this is the standard
[50:44] that we have for this church am I am not
[50:47] going to lower any standard I am not
[50:50] going to change any standard I am not
[50:53] going to I mean compromise any standard
[50:56] because everything that was brought up
[50:58] came from the Bible and the message of
[51:01] the hour you voted me to preach the
[51:04] Bible according to the message of the
[51:06] hour are we clear so if a child a young
[51:11] man or a young sister in this church go
[51:14] against what has been
[51:17] taught are we together yeah are we
[51:20] together if the parent compromise with
[51:23] it yeah count me out amen
[51:27] amen am brother can you say amen amen
[51:30] count me completely out Amen in other
[51:33] word if you go against everything that
[51:36] we discussed yesterday yes and that I
[51:39] taught you in courtship and whatever
[51:41] amen don't put pressure on me I am not
[51:44] going to bless your
[51:46] marriage you didn't get me
[51:51] well if I have to preach this and go
[51:53] home that's fine let's make sure because
[51:56] there is no problem no sir if an
[51:59] unbeliever is coming from denomination
[52:01] and they don't know anything about the
[52:03] message and they come to me they have
[52:05] been probably leaving as a boyfriend
[52:07] have children and they say brother
[52:09] Stephen we want you to bless the
[52:10] marriage it's a different story I will
[52:13] sit with them I will go through the
[52:15] teaching and everything and make sure
[52:16] everything is clear before I lay my hand
[52:19] that's why when they call me in uh Ohio
[52:22] I have to make sure everything is
[52:24] correct if not I don't lay my hand on
[52:27] you are we together you are not off the
[52:30] street God gave you a best privilege
[52:33] ever that we did in
[52:37] have are we together if you didn't show

[52:42] problem God gave you the best privilege
[52:45] ever that's true amen we taught you
[52:47] everything before you get in trouble
[52:50] that's true so if you turn around and
[52:52] you go against the word of God that's it

[52:57] I am not going to bless your marriage
[52:58] you need to find another

[53:13] to announce your marriage right here
[53:15] don't put the pressure on the song
[53:17] leader to announce your marriage here
[53:19] don't put the pressure on the young
[53:22] people to pull them to the marriage that
[53:25] is contrary to the word of God don't put
[53:28] a pressure on the church to bring people

[1:04:26] Luke chapter
[1:04:29] 15 somebody say yeah so made it too not
[1:04:36] today Luke 15 very familiar
[1:04:42] again verse 11 if you there you can say
[1:04:45] amen amen the Bible says and he said
[1:04:49] this is Jesus talking a certain man has
[1:04:53] two
[1:04:54] sons and they younger of them said to
[1:04:57] his
[1:04:58] father father give me the portion of
[1:05:01] goods that falls to me and he divided to
[1:05:05] them his living you may be
[1:05:08] seated and not many days after the
[1:05:11] younger son gathered all together and
[1:05:14] took his journey into a far country you
[1:05:17] understand this clearly now and there
[1:05:20] wasted his substance with riotous living
[1:05:23] which are harlots amen
[1:05:26] jop to verse uh
[1:05:29] 17 and when he came to
[1:05:33] himself he said how many hired servant
[1:05:38] of my father have bread enough and to
[1:05:41] spare and I perish with
[1:05:45] Hunger I will arise and go to my father
[1:05:49] and will say to him father I have Sinn
[1:05:53] against heaven and before you and I'm no
[1:05:57] more worthy to be called your son make
[1:05:59] me as one of your hired servant and he
[1:06:02] arose and came to his father but when he
[1:06:05] was yet a great way off his father saw
[1:06:08] him and had compassion and ran and fell
[1:06:12] on his neck and kissed him and the son
[1:06:14] said to him father I have Sinn against
[1:06:17] heaven and in your sight and I'm no more
[1:06:20] worthy to be called your sons if you
[1:06:23] notice the father never said that
[1:06:25] forgave
[1:06:28] you that's right the father didn't say
[1:06:31] that the father just HG him kiss him and
[1:06:33] that was it amen so when he's expressing
[1:06:37] his repentance the father say in on
[1:06:40] verse 22 but the father said to his
[1:06:43] servant bring forth the best Rob and put
[1:06:47] it on him and put a ring on his hand and
[1:06:49] shoes on his feet and bring here the FED

[1:06:55] the young Bullock and went to the Book
[1:06:57] of Leviticus are we together and kill it
[1:07:01] and let us be merry H let us eat and be
[1:07:05] merried for this my son was dead and
[1:07:07] he's alive again he was lost and he's
[1:07:10] found and they begin to be merry now
[1:07:15] let's
[1:07:16] clam my theme this morning is
[1:07:21] prayer ansers and answer amen amen
[1:07:26] amen prayer
[1:07:31] amen
[1:07:35] incense and
[1:07:39] answer are we together amen according to

[1:07:46] sacrifice was
[1:07:49] killed there were three application on
[1:07:51] the
[1:07:52] sacrifice the first one they have to
[1:07:54] apply the Blood on the veil with a
[1:07:57] finger which is the blood have to go
[1:07:59] upon the individual that will house
[1:08:03] deity amen because that was the veil of
[1:08:06] the uh Badger skin the second one the
[1:08:10] blood have to be put upon the horns of
[1:08:13] the golden altar or the altar of incense
[1:08:17] amen which we are dealing with now which
[1:08:20] we find that it's a
[1:08:22] prayer that we were dealing with and the
[1:08:24] last one the blood have to go at the
[1:08:27] bottom of the Brazen altar yes which

[1:08:49] you cannot apply the blood on the veil
[1:08:52] without applying the blood on the horn
[1:08:55] and you you cannot apply the blood on
[1:08:56] the horn without putting the blood on
[1:08:58] the bottom of the altar all this goes

[1:23:08] he's a bad man God say don't worry let's
[1:23:10] hear what God is talking about Paul if
[1:23:13] God is going to say uhhuh I know exactly
[1:23:15] what he did verse 15 but but means a
[1:23:18] contradiction my friend in other word
[1:23:21] God is going to tell him something
[1:23:22] contrary to everything that he saying
[1:23:24] but the Lord said to him go your way in
[1:23:29] other way hey heyy go your way for he is
[1:23:33] a
[1:23:38] what do you see anything negative about
[1:23:41] Paul there why the blood has been
[1:23:44] applied on
[1:23:46] Paul are we together he is a
[1:23:50] what to me to Bear my name yes yes sir
[1:23:55] before the Gentile uhhuh and Kings uhuh
[1:23:59] and the children of Israel for I will
[1:24:01] show him how great thing he must suffer
[1:24:05] for my name sake that's all God have to
[1:24:08] say about PA God didn't mention anything
[1:24:13] that Paul did in the past because
[1:24:15] everything Paul did in the past was in
[1:24:18] the sea of God's unfor forgetfulness God
[1:24:22] already wiped the sin of power and he
[1:24:24] put the blood upon the altar now that
[1:24:27] the servant Now understand who Paul is
[1:24:30] watch the next verse verse 17 and ananas
[1:24:34] went his way and enter into the
[1:24:38] house and putting his hand on him he say
[1:24:43] s The
[1:24:46] Sinner can you read the Bible with
[1:24:48] me what did an say he begin to call Paul
[1:24:53] who brother
[1:24:54] why is he calling him
[1:24:56] brother why is he calling him Brother s
[1:24:59] because he understood that Paul is
[1:25:01] already
[1:25:02] converted he's no longer the old Paul
[1:25:05] the old Paul has been wiped out are we
[1:25:08] together yes sir he say brother Saul the
[1:25:13] Lord even Jesus in other word the one
[1:25:15] you met over there that appeared to you
[1:25:18] in the way as you came he send me that
[1:25:21] you may receive your sight and
[1:25:27] what who preached to Paul
[1:25:32] repentance who preached to him
[1:25:35] repentance let me continue Verse 18 and
[1:25:39] immediately death fell from his eyes as
[1:25:42] he has been
[1:25:44] scared and he received sight forth with
[1:25:48] and he rose and was whated who taught
[1:25:52] him to be baptized
[1:25:56] are we together what I'm trying to point
[1:25:58] out here is when your sins are forgiven
[1:26:02] when there is a change in heart because
[1:26:05] God is looking at your heart not your
[1:26:07] mouth that's the reason why a lot of
[1:26:10] people come and they alter they go back
[1:26:11] they don't
[1:26:12] change by mouth they are confessing but
[1:26:16] their heart is not with God God so the
[1:26:18] heart of Paul when God approved Paul
[1:26:22] automatically God opened the connection
[1:26:25] are we together now let's go back to
[1:26:27] Luke 15 and watch the young men the
[1:26:30] prodal
[1:26:33] son we talking about a prayer if you
[1:26:37] there let's go to verse uh
[1:26:41] 17 we there and when he came to what
[1:26:46] his so the one that was doing the bad
[1:26:50] thing was it the boy or this boy
[1:26:55] because there is two boys amen the Bible
[1:26:58] say he came to
[1:27:03] himself let me start this way my
[1:27:07] friend the boy was a amen then for some
[1:27:13] reason he
[1:27:15] flipped he became
[1:27:18] B amen am then the Bible say he came to
[1:27:22] himself
[1:27:25] are we together he came back to
[1:27:29] a are we together so the boy
[1:27:35] changed are we together the boy changed
[1:27:39] he moved from B to a because B was
[1:27:43] taking him further away from his father
[1:27:46] even when the condition were bad he went
[1:27:48] and joined to the citizen of the country
[1:27:51] be will continue to get you away from
[1:27:53] God
[1:27:55] but a will bring you back to God verse
[1:27:58] six will always bring you back to God
[1:28:02] but verse seven is the one that's going
[1:28:04] to take you away from God we have a
[1:28:07] white
[1:28:09] dog and a black
[1:28:12] dog are we together the Bible say he
[1:28:16] came to himself in other word the one
[1:28:18] that was doing everything wrong was not
[1:28:21] him that's correct amen are we together
[1:28:26] watch when he came to himself the Bible
[1:28:28] says how many hired servant of my father
[1:28:32] have bread enough and to spare and I
[1:28:35] perish with what hunger who taught him
[1:28:38] this do you see any preacher here no
[1:28:41] brother Bram say he was the angel of the
[1:28:43] Lord amen the same one that met Paul now
[1:28:47] Verse
[1:28:47] 18 I will
[1:28:51] arise and go to my father
[1:28:56] who cast our
[1:28:59] Devils my friend I'm going slowly should
[1:29:02] you catch up something usually you
[1:29:04] struggling with a demon they have to
[1:29:06] cast a devil but him when he came to
[1:29:09] himself all the Devil Went
[1:29:13] Away nobody cast that devil when he came
[1:29:16] to himself every devil that was
[1:29:19] connected to him felt an electrical shot
[1:29:23] and they all off and nothing could block
[1:29:26] the B to remain in that country
[1:29:30] anymore he didn't have any preacher just
[1:29:33] coming back to
[1:29:36] himself coming back to what he was
[1:29:39] before he left the father home coming
[1:29:43] back to his true identity to what you
[1:29:46] were before you come in this world when
[1:29:48] you come back to that one you don't
[1:29:51] fight
[1:29:52] Devils let me
[1:29:55] the Bible says I will arise and go to my
[1:29:59] father and will say to him father I have
[1:30:03] sin before heaven and before you who
[1:30:06] taught him
[1:30:08] repentance I'm asking you a question who
[1:30:10] taught him
[1:30:12] repentance and I am no more worthy to be
[1:30:15] called your son make me as one of your
[1:30:18] hired servant who what gave this boy an
[1:30:23] assurance
[1:30:24] that what he would tell the Father the
[1:30:27] father will agree that's right are we
[1:30:30] together because he's speaking with
[1:30:33] certainty he's speaking with faith he
[1:30:36] doesn't say I'm going to go to my father
[1:30:39] I'm trying to help you in your prayer
[1:30:41] I'm going to go to my father then I will
[1:30:44] tell him and I will see how daddy will
[1:30:46] react the boy is not going there the boy
[1:30:50] is going one way in other word he's not
[1:30:53] going to come back again he already
[1:30:56] burned the bridges behind I am going one
[1:30:59] time and I know when I get to the father
[1:31:02] I will get what I
[1:31:03] want I don't know if you understanding
[1:31:06] me are we together the boy does have no
[1:31:10] for an answer amen are we together the
[1:31:14] boy knows for sure that I'm not going to
[1:31:20] anyone I'm not going to the judge but
[1:31:23] but I'm going to my father it's
[1:31:26] important to know who you going
[1:31:30] to are we together amen I'm not going to
[1:31:33] anyone I'm going to my father and I'm
[1:31:36] going to tell my father I have sin

[1:31:40] is my petition I want you to make me as
[1:31:43] one of your servant amen who Tau him
[1:31:46] that his father can hear a
[1:31:50] sinner are we together are we together
[1:31:53] what gave him the confidence that when
[1:31:55] he get there his prayer will be answered
[1:31:59] that's whatever happened to him that
[1:32:03] came that changed him to come back to
[1:32:06] himself already opened the door for the
[1:32:10] prayer I don't know if you're
[1:32:12] understanding me that's why when his
[1:32:14] father saw him he didn't wait for him to

[1:35:48] toally be what sorry for your sins then
[1:35:51] when you know that you are sorry for
[1:35:53] your sin sin and then do what repentance
[1:35:56] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:35:58] Christ for the remission of your sin and

[1:36:20] amen God heal your prayer based on your
[1:36:23] heart when your heart is Thoroughly
[1:36:26] repented then automatically the blood
[1:36:29] goes upon your altar are we clear
[1:36:34] together the Bible says in the book of
[1:36:36] Hebrew 10 and there sins and iniquity
[1:36:40] will I remember no more no more now
[1:36:43] where remissions of dis is there is no
[1:36:46] more offering for what sin ah then there
[1:36:49] is more no more sin no more iniquity so
[1:36:52] what happened to you having therefore
[1:36:55] after you already forgiven having
[1:36:57] therefore Breen what boldness to enter
[1:37:00] where the whole by the blood of who
[1:37:03] Jesus because once you are forgiven
[1:37:07] automatically the altar of Ence is
[1:37:10] brought into the presence of God now you
[1:37:12] have boldness to go before God am what
[1:37:15] I'm trying to build right here is if you
[1:37:18] already a Christian there should not be
[1:37:21] a hindrance to your prayer
[1:37:23] [Applause]
[1:37:25] amen are we together when you are a
[1:37:27] Christian when you approaching God the
[1:37:30] problem is we are approaching god
[1:37:32] without
[1:37:33] faith but Faith cometh by the word of
[1:37:36] God so I must preach to you something
[1:37:39] that you must receive first so that when
[1:37:42] you go pray from today you don't pray
[1:37:44] like you were praying
[1:37:46] before because before we are praying by
[1:37:51] routine we praying the mama taught me
[1:37:54] how to pray the way God the way the
[1:37:57] pastor was praying but you not praying
[1:38:00] by
[1:38:02] Revelation what am I trying to say
[1:38:05] brother Greg is right there
[1:38:08] amen if I say I need uh I need uh a
[1:38:13] drink and brother Greg have the drink
[1:38:16] yeah if I'm uncertain I will say okay I
[1:38:18] will go talk to brother Greg about the
[1:38:20] drink amen your are certainty will be
[1:38:24] proven by the way you even talk to
[1:38:25] brother
[1:38:27] Greg because when you go to brother Greg
[1:38:29] you will say brother Greg God bless you
[1:38:32] are you brother Greg yes brother Greg
[1:38:35] and before you even speak what you want
[1:38:37] to speak you will see you begin to take
[1:38:39] 74 you get on 85 you get on 485 brother
[1:38:44] Greg how was the day today are you doing
[1:38:48] okay ah it has been nice I heard that
[1:38:50] you a good
[1:38:52] brother ah Brother G do you know it's
[1:38:55] too hot today do you see how long you
[1:38:58] taking because you think by multiplying
[1:39:01] words your prayer will be
[1:39:04] [Applause]
[1:39:06] answered I'm going with you slowly so we
[1:39:08] built this are we together are we
[1:39:11] together but if you know what who
[1:39:14] brother Greg is and you have a
[1:39:18] relationship like brother Steven and
[1:39:20] brother Greg are when I'm coming to
[1:39:23] brother Greg I won't go left and right
[1:39:26] I'm coming with
[1:39:28] boldness with confidence I said brother
[1:39:32] Greg can I get a drink because I already
[1:39:34] know there is a drink there and the way
[1:39:36] I'm talking brother Greg knows that
[1:39:38] brother Steven are know him it's about
[1:39:43] [Applause]
[1:39:46] relationship are we together are we
[1:39:48] together that's why Jesus said when you
[1:39:50] pray say our father don't go just like
[1:39:54] that no no no remember first that you
[1:39:56] going to the father am just the way you
[1:39:59] talking to your father Jesus say if your
[1:40:01] father knows how to give good gift how
[1:40:04] about your heavenly father so when you
[1:40:07] pray push the break cool down say who am
[1:40:11] I going to talk to because the Bible say
[1:40:14] the one who comes to God must believe
[1:40:17] that he
[1:40:18] is and he is the rewarder
[1:40:23] I don't know if we're together you must
[1:40:25] believe that God is a rewarder if you
[1:40:28] don't believe he's a rewarder you won't
[1:40:30] get
[1:40:32] nothing you must believe that as I'm
[1:40:34] going I'm going to receive if you don't
[1:40:37] believe that don't pray go to sleep you
[1:40:41] wasting your
[1:40:42] [Applause]
[1:40:49] time are we together are we together are
[1:40:53] we together even the prayer line brother
[1:40:55] Bram say you don't have faith don't
[1:40:57] waste your time here amen don't waste
[1:41:00] your time here amen when you approach
[1:41:02] them man you got to know what you're
[1:41:04] doing but the problem is we have not
[1:41:06] been trained how to pray amen we are
[1:41:09] praying by routine we know that if
[1:41:12] something happen what we need to do is
[1:41:14] pray and the way we pray shows even what
[1:41:16] we believe Lord help s and so and so
[1:41:19] amen you're not really knowing what you
[1:41:21] doing amen and you are expecting maybe
[1:41:25] when you say that you expecting they're
[1:41:26] going to give her medication then she's
[1:41:28] going to feel good and tomorrow we will
[1:41:29] have a testimony you already have that
[1:41:31] in your mind amen and I bet you you
[1:41:34] don't even expect a
[1:41:37] miracle amen you are praying so that I
[1:41:40] know down the road she will get better
[1:41:43] but you don't go like when I pray
[1:41:45] something will
[1:41:47] happen are we together are we together
[1:41:50] because when Jesus pray he said father I
[1:41:53] know I know that you always hear
[1:41:57] me so Jesus have a confidence I'm going
[1:42:00] to get you that my friend are we
[1:42:02] together are we together amen are we
[1:42:04] together so we are entering the holiest
[1:42:07] not just like that amen you don't enter
[1:42:10] the holiest trembling no you enter the
[1:42:12] holiest with boldness amen amen with
[1:42:15] what the blood of Jesus Christ are we
[1:42:18] together are we together why the blood
[1:42:21] brother brandham told us
[1:42:24] he say so will your prayer go where
[1:42:27] straight to its destination will it take
[1:42:29] 485 no will it take 77 no your prayer
[1:42:33] are going where straight so why do you
[1:42:35] waste
[1:42:37] time amen why do you waste time because
[1:42:42] we learned that from
[1:42:43] Pentecostal that when you scream aloud
[1:42:45] oh holy God oh hallelujah oh hallelujah
[1:42:48] it's like you pushing you pushing prayer
[1:42:51] you pushing prayer you pushing prayer
[1:42:52] with your own hand prayer move prayer
[1:42:55] move prayer you don't move prayer like
[1:42:57] that prayer is moved by faith amen are
[1:43:00] we together he say so will your prayer
[1:43:03] go where straight to its destination
[1:43:05] because it's offer in the what the blood
[1:43:08] of Jesus Christ so your faith is not on
[1:43:11] you your faith is not on your vocabulary
[1:43:15] your faith is in the
[1:43:17] blood I don't know if we are
[1:43:20] together I don't know if we are together
[1:43:23] yes I'm not approaching God because I
[1:43:26] know who I I'm approaching God because
[1:43:29] I'm coming according to his formula are
[1:43:32] we together I'm having faith in the
[1:43:34] blood BL if I don't have blood then I
[1:43:37] can Blu but if I put blood I must have
[1:43:40] confidence on what I'm
[1:43:42] doing brother Bram say because it offer
[1:43:45] in the blood of who Jesus Christ which
[1:43:48] does what cleanses you the same blood
[1:43:50] that cleans you is the same blood that
[1:43:53] goes upon the altar are we together
[1:43:55] because it's the same blood that open up
[1:43:57] prayer that is no there is not a sin or
[1:44:01] a spot on you where nowhere why because
[1:44:04] of the blood that's right they can be as
[1:44:07] long as that Clorox which is the blood
[1:44:10] is between me and what how is he going
[1:44:13] to see
[1:44:14] sin because God if you are sinner he
[1:44:18] won't answer you but if you come under
[1:44:21] the blood then just to remember in your
[1:44:24] mind that God doesn't see me a sinner he
[1:44:26] will change your way of
[1:44:29] talking am don't worry my friend we
[1:44:33] found out in Revelation 5 that the blood
[1:44:37] the that's the prayer of the sent were
[1:44:39] the incense and according to Revelation
[1:44:41] 8 after the opening of the seventh seal
[1:44:44] they took an incense which is the blood
[1:44:47] and mix it with our prayer so incense
[1:44:49] and incense mix together and we find
[1:44:52] that brother
[1:44:54] according to Malachi 1 the bible say
[1:44:57] that from the from the rising of the sun
[1:45:00] even un the going down of the same my
[1:45:03] name shall be great among the Jew among
[1:45:07] the who the Gentiles and in every place
[1:45:11] incense shall be offered unto my name
[1:45:15] this is a I mean a promise to the
[1:45:17] Gentile and a pure offering for my name
[1:45:21] shall be great among the heathen
[1:45:23] say the Lord of host and Paul say I will
[1:45:27] therefore that men pray where everywhere
[1:45:30] lifting up holy hand without WRA and
[1:45:33] what doubting because if you doubt
[1:45:35] you're not going to receive
[1:45:38] anything why are you taking as said
[1:45:41] brother Bram says this that the incense
[1:45:44] was the order order Who stuff that they
[1:45:47] burn with the Bible uh which the Bible
[1:45:50] said that there was the prayer of the s
[1:45:53] if there is no sacrifice on the altar
[1:45:55] then the prayer cannot be received it's
[1:45:58] only by the blood on the sacrificial Al
[1:46:02] altar that that let the prayer go
[1:46:05] through who God so if we are under the
[1:46:09] blood of Jesus Christ what shows us that
[1:46:12] our prayer is not going
[1:46:14] through and why is our prayer not going
[1:46:17] to
[1:46:18] amen the Bible says this according to
[1:46:21] Hebrew when we look at this we find that
[1:46:23] the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:46:26] speaks because there is a voice in the
[1:46:28] blood there is a life in the blood and
[1:46:31] he speaks first brother Bram say he
[1:46:33] speaks about Redemption because the
[1:46:35] blood have to redeem you first I'm just
[1:46:37] going quickly just a quick review on
[1:46:39] this then brother Bram say it's not only
[1:46:42] Redemption he say in the New Testament
[1:46:45] he speak of redemption the blood must be
[1:46:48] upon the veil in the New Testament it
[1:46:50] speak of resurrection and life
[1:46:53] he speak of what he speaks of what Joy
[1:46:57] he speak of what power he speaks of what
[1:47:00] life he speaks of what heav in other
[1:47:02] word everything that you have need of is
[1:47:05] already in that life in the blood of the
[1:47:08] Lamb so when we coule our prayer with
[1:47:11] the blood we are sending two
[1:47:14] voices it is your voice mix with the
[1:47:17] voice of Christ are we together brother
[1:47:20] Bram say the blood of Christ cover all
[1:47:23] our sin uh-huh and speak peace and
[1:47:26] resurrection and power and life and
[1:47:29] healing and all the Redemptive blessing
[1:47:33] that the blood was shed for he does what
[1:47:37] speaks for us so when we take the blood
[1:47:40] and you put it with your prayer
[1:47:42] automatically the blood will begin to
[1:47:44] compensate where you are me where you
[1:47:46] are lacking are we together are we
[1:47:50] together yes sir and then brother Bram
[1:47:52] say when when we pray we must have a
[1:47:55] token to present with our what our pray
[1:47:58] in other word you must have the incense
[1:48:01] to Cle with your prayer amen now don't
[1:48:04] fail to get that when you pray you must
[1:48:08] you must have what the token to hold off
[1:48:12] a what the prayer if you are not keeping
[1:48:15] keep praying until the token because you
[1:48:18] are not promised to receive it see you
[1:48:21] got to have the token first that's the
[1:48:24] paying price your faith to believe it
[1:48:28] when you approaching God you must
[1:48:29] believe that he is are we together glory
[1:48:33] to God Paul in Ephesians 5 6 says
[1:48:37] praying always with all prayer and what
[1:48:42] simplification how
[1:48:45] spirit in the spirit and watching there
[1:48:49] unto with all perseverance and
[1:48:51] supplication for all the what so you
[1:48:54] pray with your supplication in the
[1:48:57] spirit which is the life that is in the
[1:49:00] blood why because we found out that in
[1:49:03] Roman 8 likewise the spirit also does
[1:49:07] what he help our infirmities for we know
[1:49:11] not what we should pray as we ought but
[1:49:15] the spirit itself does
[1:49:17] what for us with growning that cannot be
[1:49:21] what there is a secret language in the
[1:49:25] blood of Jesus Christ that will correct
[1:49:28] your prayer and make your prayer go
[1:49:31] through
[1:49:35] amen the
[1:49:37] spirit does something number one the
[1:49:41] spirit is helping us amen by making
[1:49:46] intercession are we together the spirit
[1:49:49] is
[1:49:50] correcting amen Cor correcting our error
[1:49:55] follow me my friend and the Bible say
[1:49:58] but he say because we don't know what we
[1:50:01] ought to pray but the spirit itself is
[1:50:03] making intercession for us with groaning
[1:50:06] which cannot be other verse 27 and he
[1:50:10] that searcheth the heart remember not
[1:50:12] the head the heart knows what is the
[1:50:15] mind of the spirit because he make
[1:50:19] intercession for the sent how of
[1:50:22] according to the will of God so the
[1:50:24] spirit help you but it doesn't help you
[1:50:28] just like that the spirit uses the will
[1:50:31] of God
[1:50:33] amen amen to help you in other words the
[1:50:37] life that is in the blood is correcting
[1:50:41] your prayer according to the will of God
[1:50:44] the spirit is your
[1:50:49] lawyer because sometime you don't know
[1:50:52] the law very well you don't know the
[1:50:54] will of God very well but the lawyer
[1:50:57] knows which article to put in your case
[1:51:01] to make the judge accept your case so
[1:51:04] the spirit of the Lord knows what will
[1:51:07] of God should be CLE with your

[1:53:54] because according to the scripture
[1:53:57] Whatever Whenever Jesus pray it happened
[1:54:01] are we together so when Jesus is going
[1:54:03] to God Jesus say
[1:54:06] father I know that you
[1:54:09] always not I know that you hear me I
[1:54:12] know that you what always hearing me in
[1:54:16] other word he's pulling a
[1:54:18] token he's telling God already you know
[1:54:22] yes you know my Covenant with you so
[1:54:24] when I come you know I can't leave here
[1:54:26] without the solution okay ah now I'm
[1:54:30] praying for those now that was Jesus yes
[1:54:33] sir what is the promise for me and
[1:54:36] you are we together what is our
[1:54:40] promises these are very simple according
[1:54:44] to 1 John
[1:54:46] 5:14 the Bible say and this is the what
[1:54:50] confidence Jesus has his
[1:54:54] confidence this
[1:54:55] confidence is for you this is the
[1:54:59] confidence that we have where that if we
[1:55:04] ask
[1:55:05] [Applause]
[1:55:10] anything follow me my friend I know you
[1:55:12] pray I know some of you are louder some
[1:55:15] of you are quieter but sometime we are
[1:55:17] praying without Revelation that's let's
[1:55:19] grab the Revelation and then we go back
[1:55:21] to praying again are we together are we
[1:55:24] together before Jesus pray he say father
[1:55:28] I always know I know that you always
[1:55:31] hear me are we together in other word
[1:55:33] I'm not wasting my time here I'm not
[1:55:35] making a show I know that if I come to
[1:55:38] you there is I cannot leave and go
[1:55:42] without any solution you need to have
[1:55:44] the same confidence because now we are
[1:55:48] in the third person of the Trinity not
[1:55:51] the Holy Spirit in Christ by the holy
[1:55:54] spirit in the church and Jesus already
[1:55:57] prayed that whatever happened to him and
[1:55:59] the father must happen to you when do
[1:56:02] you want that to happen you want to
[1:56:04] start
[1:56:06] [Applause]
[1:56:09] today are we together are we together if
[1:56:13] I tell you have a confidence you will
[1:56:16] probably not trust me because it's my
[1:56:18] word so God gave us the confidence so
[1:56:21] this confidence is not you it is the
[1:56:24] confidence God gave you to use for him
[1:56:27] so let's use it what is the confidence
[1:56:31] the Bible say and this is the confidence
[1:56:34] that we have where in him that if we ask
[1:56:38] certain things no
[1:56:42] anything please leave your prayer that
[1:56:45] were not answer in the past leave that
[1:56:47] follow this today forget your old prayer
[1:56:50] okay if we ask what
[1:56:53] anything according to what his will
[1:56:56] that's why the Holy Spirit when he
[1:56:59] interceding for you he's interceding
[1:57:02] according to what his will because there
[1:57:05] is a key when you use the will of
[1:57:08] God
[1:57:09] am I hope you getting what I'm saying he
[1:57:12] says if we ask anything according to
[1:57:16] what he does what is this positive or
[1:57:21] condition or what it is clear in other
[1:57:25] word when you come before God you must
[1:57:28] remember this
[1:57:30] verse you say father I have
[1:57:33] confidence that when I come in you to
[1:57:37] ask anything you will hear me if you
[1:57:41] don't believe that don't
[1:57:43] pray let me continue my friend he says
[1:57:47] and if we
[1:57:50] know this is Jesus talking that he hear
[1:57:57] us I don't know if you get that it's in
[1:57:59] red lady you must have confidence in him
[1:58:04] amen what is the confidence if I ask
[1:58:07] brother Greg anything brother Greg will
[1:58:10] hear me and if I
[1:58:12] know in other word if I have the
[1:58:15] certainty if I have the
[1:58:18] assurance that brother Greg will give it
[1:58:20] to me then whatsoever we ask we know
[1:58:25] that we have the petition that we desire
[1:58:28] of what so you must believe and know
[1:58:32] that it's going to

[2:08:27] is the confidence that we have in him
[2:08:29] that if we ask anything according to his
[2:08:32] will he hear us and if we know that he
[2:08:34] hear us whatsoever we ask we know that
[2:08:37] we have the petition of that we desire
[2:08:39] of him that's what we just heard now we
[2:08:43] ask what is the will of
[2:08:47] God are we together there is only one
[2:08:50] way to know his will and that is by what
[2:08:55] the word of
[2:08:57] God so when you praying search what you
[2:09:01] want in the
[2:09:05] word I don't know if you understanding
[2:09:09] me that's why
[2:09:12] the when she was in trouble she went in
[2:09:15] the word the name won't be different but
[2:09:19] God is the same yesterday today and
[2:09:22] forever whatever he did for one he must
[2:09:25] do it for the
[2:09:27] other I don't know if we together when J

[2:16:26] that amen if you don't understand the
[2:16:30] meaning of what you're doing you won't
[2:16:32] have a confidence why do we do that in
[2:16:35] John 14 this is Jesus himself talking he
[2:16:39] said whatsoever ye shall ask in my
[2:16:46] name I don't know if you're
[2:16:48] okay that our that what I I will do so
[2:16:53] from today when you are saying in Jesus
[2:16:56] name don't just say in Jesus name I'm
[2:17:00] saying in Jesus name because Jesus told
[2:17:04] me that whatever I ask the father in my
[2:17:11] name I will do it amen that will I do
[2:17:15] that the father may be what glorified in
[2:17:18] the son if you shall ask a anything
[2:17:21] thing uh-huh how in my name I will do
[2:17:27] it so today why do we say in the name of
[2:17:32] Jesus Christ amen cuz he will do it
[2:17:34] because we got a promise amen who gave
[2:17:37] the formula it's him Jesus so if I come

[2:17:43] taught me to use your name why am I
[2:17:45] going to get why why am I not getting an
[2:17:47] answer so to begin with before I pray
[2:17:51] I'm coming in the
[2:17:53] name before I even pray I'm coming in
[2:17:56] the name I am not praying like me I am
[2:18:01] praying in the name remember Jacob and
[2:18:05] Esau you remember Esau was the
[2:18:09] firstborn he was the one with the beight
[2:18:12] but the beight was taken from
[2:18:15] Esau and give to Jacob are we together
[2:18:19] amen are we together
[2:18:21] but the one who have to receive the
[2:18:23] blessing still remain so but the birth
[2:18:26] right has been
[2:18:28] transferred are we together are we
[2:18:30] together because our first begotten of
[2:18:33] the father is Jesus Christ but he became
[2:18:40] sinner that we may become the
[2:18:44] righteousness of God so the
[2:18:46] righteousness of Christ was given to us
[2:18:49] yes but when we coming we using his
[2:18:53] name we coming under the name of
[2:18:58] Esau let me rephrase it again my friend
[2:19:02] somebody didn't get
[2:19:03] it the birthright was already
[2:19:06] transferred the birthright was no longer
[2:19:08] under Esau he was under Jacob that's
[2:19:11] right amen but Jacob is still Jacob yes
[2:19:15] sir Esau is still Esau but the birth
[2:19:17] right is already transferred are we
[2:19:19] together so in order to receive the
[2:19:22] blessing you must come under the name of
[2:19:25] Esau that's right that's right sir
[2:19:28] that's right are we together in order to
[2:19:31] receive the blessing you don't come
[2:19:33] under the name of Jacob even if you
[2:19:37] are I don't know if we together please
[2:19:41] put your seat belt let's recalibrate
[2:19:43] this
[2:19:45] again the first born is Esau he lost his
[2:19:50] Birthright
[2:19:51] and the birth right went to the Jacob
[2:19:54] but Jacob even though he hold the birth
[2:19:57] right he can't come and tell his father
[2:19:59] father I have the be right I am Jacob
[2:20:02] they're not going to give him nothing
[2:20:04] you have the be right but you still have
[2:20:07] to come in the
[2:20:08] [Applause]
[2:20:09] name I don't know if we together Jesus
[2:20:13] became sinner he represented you at the
[2:20:17] cross so that you become the
[2:20:19] righteousness of God
[2:20:21] so when you are approaching God you
[2:20:23] still have to use the
[2:20:25] [Music]

[2:31:44] what to do he said a b c d but his heart
[2:31:51] he has desire so God is using the desire
[2:31:55] and making prayer with the
[2:31:58] [Applause]
[2:31:58] [Music]
[2:32:01] alphabet are we together are we together
[2:32:05] amen young children are we together he
[2:32:08] says and certainly we depend on what him
[2:32:14] to do what put it together that is the
[2:32:17] prayer of sincerity
[2:32:19] certainly he could not put them together
[2:32:22] it is not how we pray right in our lips
[2:32:27] it is the mo of our
[2:32:30] [Applause]
[2:32:32] [Music]
[2:32:34] heart spoken word spoken
[2:32:38] word spoken word this message came to
[2:32:42] correct
[2:32:43] us it is not how we pray in what our Liv
[2:32:47] because Pharisee prays more than you
[2:32:50] yeah
[2:32:50] yeah and they love to play in the public
[2:32:54] places lifting up
[2:32:56] [Music]
[2:32:58] hands so your prayer need to be
[2:33:00] different than the Pharisees because
[2:33:03] Jesus said these people honor me with
[2:33:05] their lips but the heart is not there
[2:33:08] brother Bram say it is not how we pray
[2:33:11] in what our lips it is the motive of our
[2:33:15] heart is what God he he sometime don't
[2:33:19] hear our lips he heal our intentions
[2:33:23] what the motive of our
[2:33:29] hearts father give me this what is in
[2:33:32] the
[2:33:33] heart

[2:33:59] the intention is
[2:34:01] [Applause]

[2:34:11] in the beginning was created male and

[2:36:00] a
[2:36:03] [Applause]
[2:36:06] no every prayer you pray is answer but

[2:36:59] prayer God always answer your prayer but
[2:37:03] the answer is either yes
[2:37:08] oh
[2:37:10] Hallelujah does God answer your prayer
[2:37:13] God always answer
[2:37:16] you oh Father I ask him for something
[2:37:21] sometime he shake his head and say what
[2:37:24] no I just Rejoice that's
[2:37:29] right spoken word this is not joke this
[2:37:33] is not Elementary you need to grow up
[2:37:36] now in the Lord I ask him something and
[2:37:39] he shake his head he says what yes I
[2:37:42] just Rejoice so
[2:37:44] much that as I can if he say yes because
[2:37:49] we always ought to ask how will be done
[2:37:53] his
[2:37:55] knows if that is his will it's a whole
[2:37:59] lot better than his what yes if it is
[2:38:04] the will of God to do it that is when
[2:38:06] you really love him
[2:38:08] [Applause]
[2:38:14] amen God answered you but he didn't want
[2:38:18] to give it to you that time
[2:38:20] because you're not prepared for it
[2:38:22] because you going to you want you want
[2:38:24] to consume that in your
[2:38:26] last amen amen then he says no but no
[2:38:31] doesn't mean he won't give it to you no
[2:38:33] because at this time his will is
[2:38:37] different are we together or what he has
[2:38:41] is different than what you
[2:38:43] planning he might have for you and
[2:38:46] another husband but not the one you are
[2:38:48] pleading
[2:38:51] not the one you working
[2:38:53] for not the one you pushing to Heaven
[2:38:56] maybe that's not your husband so God is
[2:38:59] saying no and you get discouraged don't
[2:39:02] get discouraged be happy because later
[2:39:04] on you find out he was a rasar so the
[2:39:07] nose of God was better for you

[2:39:34] were crying God you don't love me God
[2:39:36] you don't love me every relationship is
[2:39:39] not working because it's not
[2:39:42] yours
[2:39:45] amen it's not yours so the answer must
[2:39:49] be no God is protecting you Lord give me
[2:39:53] a job in Bank of America God wants you
[2:39:56] to be in a in chase God say no don't get

[2:40:19] opportunity for you to ask him and say

[2:40:24] don't want me to go this way so if this
[2:40:26] is not the way would you not show me
