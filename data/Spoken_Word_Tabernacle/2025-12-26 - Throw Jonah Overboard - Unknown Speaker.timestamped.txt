[0:17] Amen. Amen. Amen. Glory to God. Amen.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; Affliction shall not rise up the second
[0:25] time. Amen.
[0:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[0:29] &gt;&gt; This is not the word of a man.
[0:31] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[0:31] &gt;&gt; It was not even the word of brother
[0:33] Polycarp.
[0:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:35] &gt;&gt; It is written in the Bible.
[0:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[0:37] &gt;&gt; How many times did you read the Bible
[0:40] &gt;&gt; and you never pay attention to that
[0:42] statement
[0:43] &gt;&gt; until it's read tonight?
[0:45] &gt;&gt; Many of you read Jonah.
[0:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[0:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:49] &gt;&gt; Many of you read the prophet Naom.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:52] &gt;&gt; But how many remember that it was spoken
[0:54] that affliction would not come? We will
[0:56] not rise up again the second time.
[1:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03] &gt;&gt; If you notice, Jonah was in the boat and
[1:06] he was quietly sleeping.
[1:09] &gt;&gt; And the Bible say he was even sleeping
[1:11] deep fast.
[1:12] &gt;&gt; It's a deep sleep. Amen.
[1:14] &gt;&gt; And you notice people that cause trouble
[1:17] usually are carefree.
[1:22] &gt;&gt; Let's leave it my friend. You will go
[1:24] home. I will not uh get into it. Amen.
[1:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32] &gt;&gt; The one that is in the midst of the
[1:34] storm, that is the author of the storm.
[1:37] He seems like he's not even caring.
[1:40] &gt;&gt; If he doesn't come to church, he's fine.
[1:42] &gt;&gt; If he miss a meeting, that's fine.
[1:45] &gt;&gt; If he doesn't pray, that's fine. He's
[1:47] more comfortable
[1:49] &gt;&gt; than those that around. Those that
[1:51] around are seeking for solution.
[1:54] &gt;&gt; But the one who caused the problem is
[1:56] usually the one who doesn't even seek
[1:57] for solution.
[2:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04] &gt;&gt; You know, I was thinking today about our
[2:07] friendship,
[2:08] &gt;&gt; our associate.
[2:10] Who do we associate with?
[2:14] &gt;&gt; Who hang around with you?
[2:17] &gt;&gt; Who's your body? And tonight, God is
[2:20] bringing Jonah.
[2:25] &gt;&gt; I was thinking about it. Amen.
[2:27] &gt;&gt; You see people deviating, people backs
[2:30] leading. Watch carefully. Watch who's
[2:32] around.
[2:33] &gt;&gt; Watch who's connected to that person.
[2:37] &gt;&gt; Either they have a worldly friend
[2:40] &gt;&gt; that begin to pull on them.
[2:42] &gt;&gt; They have a friend that is taking them
[2:43] to sport. or they have a so-cal message
[2:47] believer friend that does not live the
[2:50] life correctly
[2:51] &gt;&gt; because when I say the world many will
[2:54] rise up. Let me leave the world.
[2:56] &gt;&gt; Let me go in the message.
[2:58] &gt;&gt; Let me go in the message.
[3:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your child is misbehaving all the
[3:05] time.
[3:05] &gt;&gt; Push the brake. Watch who is hanging
[3:08] with your child.
[3:11] &gt;&gt; Uh we will get into this. Amen.
[3:15] &gt;&gt; We will get into this time is already
[3:16] gone. We will get into this. But you
[3:18] need to be careful who you hang out
[3:20] with.
[3:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[3:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:25] &gt;&gt; You can get yourself in big trouble in
[3:28] this message.
[3:30] &gt;&gt; When I'm saying this, you having a hard
[3:31] time to understand.
[3:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown, I'm saying get among
[3:35] preachers.
[3:37] &gt;&gt; H Now, now I shock you with that one
[3:40] &gt;&gt; because you didn't believe that one. Do
[3:42] you need a quote for that one? He said
[3:44] get among a bunch of preacher.
[3:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say and you get in
[3:47] trouble.
[3:49] &gt;&gt; If if if among a bunch of preacher there
[3:52] is trouble, what do you think?
[3:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:58] &gt;&gt; Sit down and examine who hang out with
[4:01] you.
[4:02] &gt;&gt; What is their spiritual life?
[4:04] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it.
[4:06] &gt;&gt; How is their life?
[4:07] &gt;&gt; A man that is already complicated.
[4:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:11] &gt;&gt; A sister complicated. Everything don't
[4:13] work in her life. Everything is
[4:15] blockage. And this is the person you
[4:17] hang out with
[4:19] &gt;&gt; to be the savior.
[4:23] &gt;&gt; Let's leave it alone, my friend. Amen.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[4:29] &gt;&gt; If something your boat is rocking left
[4:32] and right, rocking left and right, storm
[4:35] after storm, you need to push the brake
[4:38] &gt;&gt; and begin and get the light and begin to
[4:42] shine all over your house to see where
[4:45] is the problem coming from. Is it myself
[4:49] who's causing the problem
[4:51] &gt;&gt; or is it somebody in the family or
[4:53] somebody in my surrendering
[4:56] &gt;&gt; that has been the author of all the
[4:59] trouble that I'm going through?
[5:01] &gt;&gt; Because as long as Jonah is not taken
[5:04] care of, you're going to lose the the
[5:06] the where
[5:09] all the merchandise
[5:10] &gt;&gt; that was in the boat was in the sea.
[5:13] Everything that you took to go make
[5:15] business in the sea.
[5:17] You begin to lose after one thing after
[5:20] the other trying to lighten up the boat.
[5:23] &gt;&gt; The problem was not to lighten up the
[5:25] boat. There was only one solution to
[5:27] lighten up the boat. If they would have
[5:29] pick up Jonah quickly, everything else,
[5:32] the merchandise could have been saved.
[5:34] But the longer we take, the more we keep
[5:36] losing. The longer we take, the more we
[5:39] keep losing. The longer I know what I'm
[5:41] saying is strong, but I don't have any
[5:43] choices. Amen. It's impossible for you
[5:46] to be way up here and suddenly boom. No,
[5:49] no, no, no, no. Something is wrong in
[5:51] your life. If you want to pro to
[5:53] progress in your life, seek really true,
[5:56] good Christian, solid people.
[6:00] &gt;&gt; People that would tell you the truth.
[6:02] &gt;&gt; People that would not compromise with
[6:04] you.
[6:05] &gt;&gt; People that would look at you in the
[6:07] face and say, "Brother, dare you were
[6:09] wrong."
[6:10] &gt;&gt; People that would tell you, "Brother,
[6:11] this is time to go to church. We need to
[6:13] quit." Amen.
[6:14] &gt;&gt; People that would tell you, "Hey, I
[6:16] didn't see you in church. We need to go
[6:17] to church. Where were you at?"
[6:20] &gt;&gt; People that would tell you, "Listen, my
[6:21] friend, this is church time. I'm going
[6:24] to church."
[6:25] &gt;&gt; People that would tell you, "The pastor
[6:26] spoke six months about this meeting. I
[6:29] am not going to miss. IF YOU STAY, I'M
[6:31] GOING TO BE THERE." THESE ARE THE people
[6:33] that you hang out with.
[6:36] &gt;&gt; Not people that are pulling you back.
[6:39] &gt;&gt; SINCE YOU GOT THAT FRIENDSHIP, now you
[6:41] drop in your spiritual life. You need to
[6:44] push the BRAKE AND COME OUT QUICKLY.
[6:48] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me.
[6:49] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me.
[6:51] &gt;&gt; You didn't understand me.
[6:53] &gt;&gt; Watch who you trying to associate.
[6:56] &gt;&gt; Watch who you trying to hook.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; Watch who you are hooking with.
[7:02] &gt;&gt; Your new discovery that you love
[7:06] &gt;&gt; that is keeping you on the telephone all
[7:08] the time. that is keeping you busy with
[7:11] others people life
[7:13] &gt;&gt; and never talk about the message of the
[7:15] hour
[7:18] &gt;&gt; take Jonah put the man of water
[7:21] &gt;&gt; ah God will take of the God will take
[7:23] care of them in the water put them in
[7:25] the water
[7:27] &gt;&gt; you didn't get me God will take care of
[7:30] them in the water they will have the
[7:33] conference in THE BELLY OF A WELL
[7:36] &gt;&gt; BUT AS LONG AS YOU HANG OUT YOU GOING TO
[7:38] BE IN TROUBLE
[7:43] You I I I don't I I don't know if you
[7:46] understand what I'm saying.
[7:48] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you understand what I'm
[7:49] saying. You a married woman. Your friend
[7:51] are divorced.
[7:54] &gt;&gt; What? What? What is What do you think
[7:56] you going to do?
[7:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[7:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[8:02] together? You're a married woman and
[8:04] you're going through marital problem. I
[8:07] surrender yourself with people that are
[8:09] strong in marriage.
[8:10] &gt;&gt; So you BEGIN TO SUCK ANOTHER ENERGY.
[8:14] &gt;&gt; You begin to suck a different anointing
[8:16] that will push you through and move on.
[8:19] &gt;&gt; Not some Have you ever seen somebody who
[8:22] is uh who went through a problem? They
[8:25] will usually hang out with a person who
[8:27] went through the same problem and they
[8:29] think they helping each other. No, they
[8:31] have been like uh crabs.
[8:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together? No, they are condoning.
[8:39] They are comforting one another in that
[8:41] level. So whenever you call, it's about
[8:44] the same conversation. Ah, you know how
[8:47] people are. We don't we don't believe
[8:49] anyone. We don't believe church people.
[8:51] I was disappointed and this one say yes
[8:53] I was disappointed. No, God cannot live
[8:57] without a witness. We got to find a true
[9:00] Christian, a true believer, somebody
[9:03] that reflect the word.
[9:05] &gt;&gt; Look at who you are associating with.
[9:09] &gt;&gt; Young sister, look at who you are
[9:11] associating with.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; Young brother, look at who you are
[9:14] associating with.
[9:16] &gt;&gt; Married people, look at who you are
[9:18] associated with.
[9:20] &gt;&gt; Look at which couple are you hanging
[9:22] around with.
[9:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Look at the one that is
[9:27] positive, THAT IS FULL OF ENERGY.
[9:30] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY THAT SISTER, PRAISE a lot, I
[9:32] NEED TO LEARN ABOUT THAT SISTER.
[9:34] &gt;&gt; I NEED TO BE CONNECTED to that sister.
[9:36] &gt;&gt; I must, you must come in my life to
[9:38] bring me up.
[9:40] &gt;&gt; NOT COME IN MY LIFE TO BRING ME DOWN.
[9:43] &gt;&gt; If somebody Oh,
[9:47] &gt;&gt; you don't understand what I'm saying.
[9:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[9:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Surrender yourself with
[9:53] people that are strong.
[9:55] &gt;&gt; You say that a pastor, I will call the
[9:57] pastor. I will ask the pastor question
[9:59] because when I talk to him, he talk to
[10:01] me about God. He talked to me about this
[10:03] one. I'm going to call brother so and so
[10:05] because every time you sit with him,
[10:07] when you come out from his presence, it
[10:09] feels like you are charged. You were
[10:12] talking about this. I learned something
[10:13] I didn't know. Those are the people that
[10:16] you surrender with. The hour is late.
[10:20] He's my friend. Especially young sister.
[10:23] He's my friend. We need to show love.
[10:27] &gt;&gt; You need to show love.
[10:29] &gt;&gt; How many times have you shown love
[10:32] &gt;&gt; with your love? Your love. Your love. We
[10:34] need to show support.
[10:36] &gt;&gt; IF THEY STRUGGLING, BRING THEM TO THE
[10:38] PASTOR.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well. If they
[10:42] struggling, bring them to the deacon.
[10:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[10:48] There was a young man now he's married
[10:50] with children. He was hanging around
[10:53] &gt;&gt; with someone. I said, "What are you
[10:55] doing with that woman?" "Oh no, we are
[10:59] uh I mean witnessing to the woman and
[11:02] everything." I say, "How long are you
[11:04] going to witness to the woman?"
[11:07] &gt;&gt; Because you keep hanging around this
[11:08] woman. If you already told them you are
[11:11] going to church and they know the
[11:12] church, take the woman and turn her to
[11:15] the deacon and let the deacon hang off.
[11:18] I mean take over because you are
[11:19] struggling. He ended up sleeping with
[11:21] the woman.
[11:22] &gt;&gt; See there
[11:24] see
[11:24] &gt;&gt; and now it was A PROBLEM OF PRAYING TO
[11:27] PULL HIM OUT FROM THE woman trying to do
[11:30] things that you don't even know what
[11:31] you're trying to do. If somebody is
[11:34] struggling, hey your love, your sweet
[11:36] sweet love, forget it. Call the deacon.
[11:39] You say, "Please, please see the deacon.
[11:42] Please see somebody that we can pray for
[11:44] you and get this thing out of it."
[11:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. This message is not psychology.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; This is not a psychology to be
[11:53] comforting the people. We need to show
[11:55] support. Everybody left him. No, she got
[11:58] A PASTOR. GO TALK TO YOUR PASTOR.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[12:04] &gt;&gt; You cannot carry your own burden. How
[12:05] are you going to carry 20 people's
[12:07] burden? You are young and before you
[12:09] know it, ah a lot of stuff are going
[12:11] because you carrying stuff that are not
[12:12] yours. YOU TOO YOUNG. FOCUS ON YOUR
[12:14] LIFE.
[12:16] &gt;&gt; PRAY FOR THE SISTER. FOCUS ON YOUR LIFE.
[12:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[12:22] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY,
[12:24] "SHOW ME WHO YOU HANG OUT WITH.
[12:27] &gt;&gt; I will tell you who you are.
[12:31] &gt;&gt; Bird of the same water. They flock. How
[12:36] &gt;&gt; you are spiritual like this? Your friend
[12:38] is low. But
[12:40] &gt;&gt; and you want me to believe you
[12:41] spiritual. Both of you are together.
[12:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[12:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[12:50] &gt;&gt; Examine your life. See what's going on.
[12:53] If you are Jonah, my friend, call for a
[12:56] conference and get everything out before
[12:58] you causing disaster to the family. If
[13:02] somebody is a Jonah say my friend I see
[13:04] that we've been friend for a long time
[13:06] but I believe the problem that you're
[13:08] going through you need a spiritual
[13:10] leader to go handle this problem.
[13:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:13] &gt;&gt; You are not qualified to have a
[13:15] doctorate degree and give prescription.
[13:18] &gt;&gt; So quit giving your prescriptions.
[13:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[13:24] &gt;&gt; I even have sister blocking another
[13:26] sister from going to the pastor. Amen.
[13:29] &gt;&gt; Don't bring your stuff to the pastor. I
[13:31] say no problem. Whatever happened to
[13:33] that sister, you will pay for it
[13:35] &gt;&gt; because you are the psychologist of the
[13:38] message. Where sister will call you to
[13:40] tell you what is wrong.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; You are not there. When a sister come
[13:44] and begin yeah. You say
[13:48] you see brother Steven, he can talk with
[13:50] you 4 hours.
[13:52] &gt;&gt; Me, I will pray for you. But go see
[13:54] brother Steven over there. Go see the
[13:56] deacon over there. Amen. Amen. Because
[13:59] when they go God provided way, God is
[14:01] under obligation
[14:04] to s to to come and surrender. Amen.
[14:07] Amen. Make your job easy in this life.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[14:11] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are not built for it. Don't
[14:15] touch it.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; Don't touch it.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. A complain a complain. You say you
[14:19] see those type of complain you start
[14:21] here, it can cause problem in the
[14:23] church. So before we go forward and
[14:26] tomorrow, brother Stephen call me. Did
[14:27] you hear? You go deal with that person
[14:30] and call the deacon and you pull back
[14:32] and you start praying
[14:34] &gt;&gt; before you find yourself in the middle
[14:36] of a mess that you don't know what
[14:39] you're doing. And that mess cause you
[14:40] problem when you were climbing up
[14:42] spiritually. On Tuesday you pray on

[14:47] you begin to clam with the Lord and
[14:48] suddenly Jonah.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:55] &gt;&gt; Call on for a conference. Examine your
[14:57] life. Well, check your family. Check
[15:00] what is going on. Quit your how you are
[15:03] spiritual. Whatever. Put it down. You
[15:05] say, "Hey, this situation has been going
[15:07] on for a long time. We don't see any
[15:09] problem here getting resolved." What is
[15:11] the problem?
[15:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:17] &gt;&gt; All right. Uh, somebody want to go home?
[15:20] Let's stop here.
[15:24] Amen. I'm just helping you summarize
[15:26] everything and putting together so you
[15:28] understand what the Holy Spirit want to
[15:30] tell you because God cannot speak like
[15:33] this and affliction come back again.
[15:35] Affliction must now rise up again the
[15:38] second time. Whatever you going through
[15:40] will be one shot and you come out of it
[15:42] and you go. Amen. But remember,
[15:45] surrender yourself
[15:47] &gt;&gt; with people that are spiritual,
[15:49] &gt;&gt; people that can help you in life,
[15:51] &gt;&gt; not negative energy under the name of
[15:54] the message.
[15:56] &gt;&gt; I don't care how bad they are. I don't
[15:58] care how they are. I don't care how much
[16:00] message they look outside. If what they
[16:03] producing is not true, just know you're
[16:06] going to work twice to try to build them
[16:08] to your position. And if you try then
[16:11] they cannot come to your level. You will
[16:13] be the one dragging down because they
[16:16] will suck all your energy. Every time
[16:18] you leave them, you have to repent.
[16:20] After you stop the communication with
[16:22] them, you must ask forgiveness because
[16:24] you murder yourself in the things that
[16:26] were not yours. Cast that Jonah into the
[16:30] water. Amen.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, and those that are
[16:35] online and those that miss tonight and
[16:37] those that will listen to this,
[16:40] get Jonah out in the water. Let Jonah go
[16:44] back to Nineveh to preach the gospel
[16:47] over there
[16:50] before you suffer a lot of losses in
[16:53] your life for stubbornness. Trying to
[16:55] work the situation out, trying to work
[16:58] the situation out, try to work the
[17:00] situation out. Who are you to be working
[17:02] the situation out? Do you know the cause
[17:04] of the situation? You are going with
[17:06] what somebody told you.
[17:09] &gt;&gt; Did you Did you listen to the other
[17:11] party?
[17:12] &gt;&gt; Did you listen to the other party?
[17:14] &gt;&gt; You heard on from one mouth and you
