[48:30] wonderful meeting yesterday got into
[48:33] courtship and everything so by God's
[48:36] grace we try to take courtship one step
[48:38] of the time but at least you have a big
[48:40] bulk of it that happened yesterday and
[48:43] everybody should be squared away what to
[48:45] say what to do what not to do when
[48:48] you're in a courtship versus when you
[48:50] are engage all this thing was covered
[48:53] yesterday so they should be ready for

[1:15:11] the Bible say Jesus brother Bram said
[1:15:14] Jesus is giving us this description of
[1:15:18] himself in relation to the last stage
[1:15:22] the days of grace are winding up he has
[1:15:25] looked from the first century right
[1:15:27] through the 20th and told us all things
[1:15:31] concerning these ages before he revealed
[1:15:34] the characteristic of the last age to us
[1:15:37] laisha amen he gave us one phom look at
[1:15:43] his gracious and supreme
[1:15:47] deity what is that look this is the
[1:15:51] Capstone revelation of himself

[1:16:14] of himself that says the who the amen
[1:16:18] Jesus is what the amen of

[1:39:33] message on your lips but the message is
[1:39:36] not in the heart amen your message came

[1:40:01] and the evil spirit answered M we clear
[1:40:05] and say to them what Jesus I know I know
[1:40:08] Jesus come and who Paul I know and no
[1:40:11] William Mar Bram but what who are ye you
[1:40:14] need to know who you are so it's not
[1:40:17] enough being in the message church amen
[1:40:20] it is not enough grow up in the message
[1:40:22] Church the problem is being in Christ
[1:40:25] amen if you in Christ and you and the
[1:40:28] message become one then you can speak
[1:40:32] Jesus Christ according to the revelation
[1:40:35] of the message of the hour and the devil
[1:40:39] must obey you because you got a
[1:40:42] revelation of who Jesus is for this
[1:40:45] present time not the Jesus of
[1:40:48] Luther not the Jesus of Wesley but the
[1:40:52] Jesus of this
[1:40:54] through the ministry of Malachi amen
[1:40:57] which open the seals and unfold a new
[1:41:01] revelation of Jesus Christ allog
[1:41:04] together new but perfectly in line with
[1:41:07] the scripture
[1:41:09] amen are we together amen are we
[1:41:12] together so when you say Jesus what are
[1:41:14] you
[1:41:15] saying which Jesus are you talking about
[1:41:18] a man with a beard okay we believe that
[1:41:21] one but which Jesus are you talking
[1:41:23] about
[1:41:23] what Revelation what understanding do
[1:41:26] you have on that Jesus that you're
[1:41:28] talking about the level of the
[1:41:30] revelation will determine the power
[1:41:33] there it is amen that will back you up
[1:41:35] and back your word based on the
[1:41:38] revelation of Jesus Christ amen and when
[1:41:41] the seals broke brother Bram say a new
[1:41:44] revelation completely new open up that's
[1:41:47] why brother brandham says this he say
[1:41:49] I'm looking for a time of a what a Break
[1:41:52] Forth of that of the what the spirit of
[1:41:55] God in these last days where we are now
[1:41:57] living in for another sege of what the
[1:42:01] Holy Spirit into the what the church the
[1:42:03] Holy Spirit was already in the church
[1:42:06] but you need another search of the Holy
[1:42:08] Spirit you you need a second oil
[1:42:12] am you need a second oil and oil
[1:42:16] different to take you to the bridegroom
[1:42:19] am not the all you started with it amen
[1:42:22] amen
[1:42:24] but the all that was open up by the
[1:42:26] midnight shout amen because it's the
[1:42:29] midnight shout that open the second o it
[1:42:32] is the message of William Mar Bram that
[1:42:35] unfold a new revelation a new anointing
[1:42:39] a new name of God all together new to us
[1:42:43] but perfectly in line with the Bible am
[1:42:46] that's why the message and the Bible i w
[1:42:50] amen am and I search of the what into
[1:42:55] what the church for what a rapturing
[1:42:57] faith so rapturing Faith doesn't come
[1:43:00] with the old church no sir no sir can
[1:43:03] you say Amen the faith to change your
[1:43:06] body in a twinking of an eye need
[1:43:09] another Revelation amen he need another
[1:43:12] surge of the Holy Spirit he need
[1:43:15] something higher than
[1:43:17] Paul higher than Luther amen higher than
[1:43:20] Pentecost amen something in a different
[1:43:23] level a Capstone Revelation amen
[1:43:28] finality
[1:43:30] amen the capping
[1:43:34] Stone of Jesus Christ himself everybody
[1:43:38] okay everybody okay just before he comes
[1:43:41] and everything is sitting how straight
[1:43:43] in order for I believe that we are
[1:43:45] living now at the time that what the
[1:43:48] word should have preeminence what should
[1:43:51] have the preeminence the word
[1:43:55] word which word the word that broke the
[1:43:59] seals amen because that's the word that

[1:44:08] amen and the tund where the Revelation
[1:44:11] under the seal amen so without the T no
[1:44:14] ruring

[1:49:42] when he birth he's not in the throne
[1:49:47] yet are we together amen are we together
[1:49:50] am he has to go through a process
[1:49:54] [Applause]
[1:49:55] before he reached the position that God
[1:49:59] ordained him to be before you were born
[1:50:03] there was already a plan for you that
[1:50:06] plan may be revealed to you before you
[1:50:09] are

[1:59:43] for any question any question the
[1:59:47] footstep of the righteous are ordered by
[1:59:49] who the Lord that have been said Paul
[1:59:52] says this glory to God in Hebrew 1 verse
[1:59:56] one he said God who at SRA times and in
[2:00:02] ders many
[2:00:04] manners spake in the past unto who the
[2:00:07] fathers by who the prophets has in this
[2:00:10] last day spoken to us by who his son his
[2:00:14] this last day he chose the son s o n
[2:00:20] amen whom he had what appointed
[2:00:23] appointed what heir of all things stop
[2:00:27] if you look he didn't say whom he
[2:00:33] has did you see that he didn't say whom
[2:00:36] he has like it's today that God decided
[2:00:40] that okay I'm going to give Jesus Christ
[2:00:42] to be the hair no he was his it's
[2:00:45] something that was done in the past he
[2:00:49] has appointed so Jesus Christ was
[2:00:53] already right in the past appointed
[2:00:57] predestinated amen prepared orain to be
[2:01:01] here
[2:01:03] amen this Jesus that is
[2:01:06] here amen is 100% God
[2:01:13] Amen everybody okay and he's 100%
[2:01:18] Man follow me
[2:01:20] carefully the god of Jesus Christ don't
[2:01:24] learn
[2:01:29] anything the god part of Jesus Christ
[2:01:32] doesn't need
[2:01:36] [Applause]
[2:01:37] training I I wish I can get where I'm
[2:01:40] going but the main part of Jesus Christ
[2:01:44] need to go through Joseph
[2:01:47] [Applause]
[2:01:50] G that's why he behove him to be made
[2:01:54] like one of us amen that's why he was
[2:01:58] made flesh his flesh went through the
[2:02:02] same process that me and you are
[2:02:05] going but God doesn't need training
[2:02:09] because it's God who created everything
[2:02:12] God have no beginning no ending he was
[2:02:15] Elohim the one who existed by himself
[2:02:19] but the son had a beginning
[2:02:24] that's why they could kill Jesus Christ
[2:02:27] but they cannot kill God before they
[2:02:30] killed Jesus Christ God came out of
[2:02:34] Jesus
[2:02:35] [Applause]

[2:02:39] the in the garden of G God removed Jesus

[2:02:50] father why has that what forsaken
[2:02:53] because God came out you cannot kill God
[2:02:56] you can kill the man Jesus Christ that's
[2:02:59] why Jesus is a Kingsman
[2:03:02] Redeemer the perfect one who can
[2:03:06] understand our trouble the high priest

[2:03:11] what
[2:03:13] infirmity any problem so far have I lost

[2:23:00] destiny what a consolation my friend

[2:23:06] understanding the principle of hair
[2:23:09] there is something that goes with hair
[2:23:11] Paul says this he says that a
[2:23:14] hair as long as he's what a child that's
[2:23:18] what nothing from a servant how can you
[2:23:21] take a baby and give him a kingship
[2:23:24] Jesus is born out of Mary he's a baby
[2:23:26] crying and he's born what king of the
[2:23:29] Jews do you take a baby and go on the
[2:23:31] throne and give it to him he doesn't
[2:23:32] even know how to talk a there when he's
[2:23:35] a child he's what not different than a
[2:23:38] slave the word to Servant there means
[2:23:41] slave he's not different than a slave in
[2:23:44] other words when you are born and you
[2:23:46] are
[2:23:48] immature do you follow me God put you in
[2:23:52] the Garment of a slave of a servant amen

[2:24:05] something but God cannot give you that
[2:24:07] thing a
[2:24:10] birth when you ride away you born when
[2:24:13] you growing up God cannot give it to you
[2:24:15] then you're not ready for that yet
[2:24:20] what does God do my friend glory to God
[2:24:23] Paul says he def nothing from what a
[2:24:27] servant though he be what Lord of all so
[2:24:30] even though you are treated as a servant
[2:24:33] it doesn't mean you're not Lord of all
[2:24:35] Amen in other word your present
[2:24:38] condition does not change what God
[2:24:40] already made for you your present
[2:24:44] condition have a time he have a frame of
[2:24:48] time that God is put you through that
[2:24:51] condition but whatever you own still
[2:24:54] remain valid that's right are we
[2:24:57] together and Paul say he deth nothing
[2:25:00] from what a servant though he be what
[2:25:02] Lord of all but is under what tutors and
[2:25:06] what and Governor until the what time
[2:25:09] appointed of the father so God take you
[2:25:13] and put you on the
[2:25:16] tutor he put you on Mentor he put put

[2:42:24] hey and the battler is bringing
[2:42:28] stuff he he was the B he was the baker
[2:42:33] he was the one bringing for he was the
[2:42:35] one that have been ministering unto the
[2:42:37] people because he knew the disciple down
[2:42:40] the road a power is coming on them on
[2:42:43] the day of Pentecost they're going to
[2:42:45] receive a power from onai and they will
[2:42:48] be doing what Jesus was doing so Jesus
[2:42:51] have to mold
[2:42:53] them to train them to understand really
[2:42:57] how to manage the God
[2:43:01] kingdom Joseph your job is Big your
[2:43:05] power is Big whatever you going to
[2:43:07] inherit is big I cannot take you
[2:43:10] straight from Israel and put you on the
[2:43:12] throne it's a
[2:43:14] disaster I cannot take you as a young
[2:43:16] child and put you a king it's a disaster
[2:43:19] you got to grow to a
[2:43:21] process and in that process I'm going to
[2:43:24] Humble you I'm going to put you under a
[2:43:27] tutor I'm going to put you under
[2:43:29] governor and I'm going to show you
[2:43:30] Lord's willing even on your job God uses
[2:43:34] even your job to do this I'm going to

[2:43:40] even somebody and makeon to Mo
[2:43:42] you amen that's true
[2:43:46] amen and most of the time we missed what
[2:43:48] God doing and if you miss that
[2:43:51] opportunity and you dodge it remember
[2:43:54] brother Bram say you're going to come up
[2:43:55] like a butterfly with a wrong Wing
[2:43:58] because you dodge a step you won't know
[2:44:01] how to fly that's why we have a big head
[2:44:03] in this message people you can teach
[2:44:06] nothing you can say nothing you cannot
[2:44:08] change them you cannot teach them
[2:44:10] anything because they already put so
[2:44:12] much in their head they know everything
[2:44:14] they don't learn from nobody God won't
[2:44:17] never put something like that that's
[2:44:19] [Music]
[2:44:20] I will show you even how God molded
[2:44:22] brother
[2:44:23] Bram because he knew the third pool is
[2:44:28] coming God never brought brother Bram
[2:44:30] and gave him the third pool never God
[2:44:33] brought brother Bram and said William
[2:44:35] Bram first Po and he made mistake and
[2:44:38] God Sav second p and he made mistake God
[2:44:41] you see every time I'm telling you not
[2:44:42] to do something you keep doing now the
[2:44:44] third one I will see how you going to
[2:44:46] make mistake I handle it myself you you
[2:44:49] see what I'm saying if he would have
[2:44:50] given brother brandham the third pool
[2:44:52] the first time what would have happened
[2:44:54] that's why God is doing
[2:44:57] that whatever you looking for whatever
[2:45:00] your marriage your what whatever you're
[2:45:01] doing if you understand the training you
[2:45:04] under right now what God is doing right
[2:45:07] now if you just can humble yourself not
[2:45:10] to brother
[2:45:13] Steven to the word if you humble
[2:45:16] yourself you will find out how quick God
[2:45:20] as soon as you pass the stest he move
[2:45:21] you to the next
[2:45:23] step amen and before you know it you're
[2:45:26] going to be a great somebody because
[2:45:28] what you have is bigger what you have is
[2:45:31] dangerous the position you have is
[2:45:33] dangerous if God give it to you right
[2:45:36] now you're going to make a disaster you
[2:45:38] won't listen to Mama you won't listen to
[2:45:40] nobody you will be on the shop and
[2:45:42] before you know it opra is calling you
