[22:59] we welcome you to this marriage ceremony
[23:02] joining brother blessing atle and sister
[23:05] jerusha fby soon to be
[23:11] changing I will now invite you to the
[23:13] reading of the scripture but before we
[23:15] read let's thank the author of the book
[23:19] Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching
[23:22] you humbly again father this evening
[23:25] thanking you for your grace for your
[23:27] love for your Mercy because it's your
[23:30] grace and your love and your mercy that
[23:33] it provided everything that we can see
[23:35] tonight Lord and Lord we are very
[23:38] limited to our own ability and your
[23:41] Prophet taught us to master the human
[23:43] element Lord may you come and move me
[23:46] completely out of the way may you be the
[23:48] one uniting and blessing Lord father
[23:51] this couple be the beginning and the
[23:53] ending of this ceremony as we commit
[23:56] everything unto thy hand in the name
[23:58] name of Jesus Christ amen amen my
[24:02] reading will be in Genesis chapter 1 and
[24:05] verse
[24:07] one the Bible says in the
[24:11] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[24:16] Earth may the Lord add his Blessing to
[24:20] the reading of the word amen you say how
[24:23] can you read such a short
[24:25] scripture and talk about marriage
[24:29] amen the Bible says in the
[24:32] beginning so it's a specific
[24:37] time a specific period of time we don't
[24:41] have to guess whether it's in the end or
[24:43] before the beginning but we know clearly
[24:46] that it's in the beginning and the Bible
[24:49] says in the beginning God singular
[24:53] created the Heaven and Earth this great
[24:56] being here we call him
[24:58] God and What attracted my attention is
[25:02] God is
[25:04] singular and he's the one creating
[25:06] everything if you look at him he look
[25:09] like a light that's right because the
[25:12] Bible says in second Timothy chapter 6
[25:15] verse1 15 that which in his term he
[25:19] shall show who is the blessed and the
[25:22] only pented the king of kings and Lord
[25:26] of lords who only has
[25:29] immortality dwelling in the light which
[25:32] no man can approach whom no man has seen
[25:36] nor can see to whom be honor and power
[25:40] Everlasting amen amen so the beginning
[25:45] give me a connection to another
[25:46] scripture in the Book of John 1 verse
[25:50] one the Bible says in John chap 1 verse
[25:53] one in the beginning again was the word
[25:59] okay now it's no longer God it's the
[26:02] word and the Bible says and the Word was
[26:05] with
[26:06] God if we stop right there it looks like
[26:09] it's two person we got the word and we
[26:13] got God but that's not the case the
[26:15] Bible continue that in the beginning was
[26:19] the word and the Word was with God and
[26:23] the Word was
[26:26] God so the word and God are the same the
[26:30] very same
[26:31] person God who was invisible now is
[26:34] manifested in the light called the word
[26:37] of God or the Theologian use the
[26:40] terminology a theophany or the logos are
[26:44] we together praise God so what I noticed
[26:48] is this God is
[26:50] singular the Bible didn't say Gods the
[26:53] Bible say God the Bible didn't say words
[26:57] the Bible say word it's singular amen
[27:02] and throughout Genesis this God begin to
[27:05] create and the Bible say and God say
[27:09] singular and God made singular and God
[27:13] called singular everything God singular
[27:18] but when we look at what he was creating
[27:21] it doesn't look
[27:25] singular amen we see one being but when
[27:29] he's creating two things
[27:32] appears why is he creating everything by
[27:36] pairs brother Branham says in the
[27:39] message marriage and divorce preached in
[27:42] 1965 in February the 21st in the morning
[27:46] paragraph 91 brother brandham says if
[27:49] Jesus say go back to the beginning there
[27:52] was only one
[27:55] pair of anything on Earth there was one
[27:59] Adam one Eve they were joined together
[28:02] by God Alone one female horse one male
[28:08] one female parrot one male at the
[28:10] beginning as he told us to go back there
[28:14] was only one pair of everything in the
[28:18] beginning a single God when he created
[28:22] two
[28:23] things male female that's right when you
[28:27] look at this zebra two
[28:30] zebra but it's one
[28:32] God he oh Israel the Lord your God is
[28:36] one God but when that God create two
[28:40] elephant when he creates two
[28:43] pigs when he create two tur do
[28:47] everything is two why is he single in
[28:51] appearance but everything he's making is
[28:54] double amen amen Paul in the Book of
[28:58] Romans chapter 1 verse 20 says that for
[29:02] the invisible things or the invisible
[29:05] qualities of him of God from the
[29:08] creation of the world are clearly seen
[29:12] and being understood by the things which
[29:14] are made even his eternal power and
[29:18] godhead so that they are without excuse
[29:21] so Paul is saying that everything that
[29:25] God created is only expressing
[29:28] God in other word if you don't
[29:31] understand this God look at the things
[29:33] that he's created and when you look at
[29:36] everything that he's creating it's
[29:38] double male and female when you turn
[29:41] around it's one entity God or you call
[29:45] him the word or you call him the logos
[29:48] or you call him the theophany but it's
[29:51] still one being why is one being
[29:54] expressing himself in double beings amen
[29:59] amen until when he was about to destroy
[30:02] the anti Delian
[30:04] world he T Noah he said I'm trying to
[30:07] preserve the species by the way you
[30:10] preserve them bring them two by
[30:14] two so that when everything is destroyed
[30:18] the new world that is coming on will
[30:20] have an expression of two and two and
[30:23] the and the scripture say everything
[30:26] that he was creating the say and he was
[30:29] good and he was good and he was good the
[30:32] first day and he was good the second day
[30:35] and he was good the third day and he was
[30:38] good the fourth day and he was good the
[30:40] fifth day until the sixth day amen and
[30:44] if you search the scripture from the
[30:46] first day to the sixth day God always
[30:49] said let let there be let there be let
[30:53] there be let there be but on the sixth
[30:56] day a strange statement escape this
[31:01] God in Genesis 1 verse 26 the Bible say
[31:06] and God
[31:09] say let us
[31:13] Oh I thought that this God is one
[31:18] being I thought that this God is single
[31:22] I thought that this God is only one
[31:24] light but God when he was creating the
[31:27] zebra he never never say let us that's
[31:29] right when he was creating the chicken
[31:32] he never say let us when he was creating
[31:35] the monkey he never say let us he say
[31:38] Let There be let there be let there be
[31:40] but when you look at the expression of
[31:42] his work everything is male female male
[31:46] female then on the sixth day he changed
[31:49] his terminology he said let us oh
[31:54] God here oh Israel the Lord your God is
[31:57] one God but God is saying let
[32:01] us he said let us make
[32:05] man so God was not
[32:09] alone that's right because he didn't say
[32:12] let
[32:13] me make men he said let us so there was
[32:17] someone that's
[32:19] right that was with God and hidden in
[32:23] God and that was creating with God
[32:29] are we together I'm just reading the
[32:31] Bible amen he said let us make
[32:35] men in our image not in my image oh so
[32:41] this light that look like one light is
[32:43] not really one light inside that light
[32:48] it's
[32:49] us and the Bible say let make let us
[32:53] make men in our image that's right amen
[32:57] so everybody stop whoever was cleaning
[33:00] the dishes drop the dishes finally we're
[33:03] going to see an expression of this God
[33:06] finally we're going to see a species
[33:08] that will look exactly like the one that
[33:11] was creating
[33:12] everything okay since it's one light so
[33:16] we assume that when his reflection comes
[33:18] up it's going to be one individual
[33:21] because he didn't say let's create men
[33:24] in plural he said let's create men one m
[33:27] a n one so you see it's one
[33:32] person
[33:33] surprisingly the Bible says and God
[33:37] say let us make man in our image after
[33:42] our likeness in other word whatever is
[33:45] going to be created will look exactly
[33:47] like God that's right or will look
[33:50] exactly like the one who's creating
[33:52] that's right let's see how it looks the
[33:55] Bible say and let them have Domin over
[33:58] the fish of the sea and over the foul of
[34:00] the air and over the cattle and over all
[34:03] the Earth and over every creeping things
[34:06] that creepeth upon the Earth so God
[34:09] singular created man singular in his own
[34:14] image in the image of
[34:17] God created he him
[34:21] singular
[34:24] male and female create Ed he them now we
[34:30] begin to understand let
[34:33] us that God was not alone because his
[34:37] perfect reflection upon the Earth came
[34:39] also as a
[34:41] pair a pair of a male and a female and
[34:45] that was the image of
[34:48] God and it was the likeness of God in
[34:51] other word God is male and female
[34:57] can I have a
[34:59] witness are we together so God is never
[35:05] single I'm letting that soak in my
[35:08] friend amen I'm reading the Holy
[35:11] Scripture he created man not one person
[35:14] he created double person male and female
[35:18] in the Book of Genesis 5 verse one the
[35:21] Bible say this is the book of the
[35:23] generations of Adam in the day that God
[35:27] created man in the likeness of God made
[35:30] he him male and female created he them
[35:36] and blessed them and called their name
[35:41] Adam so when you say Adam is not a name
[35:45] for only a
[35:48] man reading the Bible my friend when you
[35:51] say Adam don't be surprised that two
[35:55] individual appears
[35:58] amen the Bible didn't say
[36:01] Adams but Adam singular so when they say
[36:06] God it doesn't mean one
[36:08] God because according to the scripture 1
[36:11] + 1 equal
[36:13] one that's why in The Book of Revelation
[36:16] when John was taken up to heaven the
[36:18] Bible say and one sat on the throne the
[36:22] Bible never say and one man sat on the
[36:24] throne verify your Bible the Bible say
[36:27] one sat on the throne go ahead why one
[36:30] why not one man because in the Book of
[36:32] Revelation chapter 3 the Bible said to
[36:35] him that
[36:36] Overcomers shall sit with me on my
[36:43] Throne so God is not the only one
[36:46] sitting on the
[36:48] throne he's sitting with somebody God is
[36:52] male and female God have a
[36:55] bride God have a wife
[36:58] the wife of the Lamb that's why the
[37:01] Bible say the wife of the Lamb Behold
[37:03] The Marriage of the Lamb has come even
[37:06] God have a
[37:09] marriage it's called The Marriage of the
[37:11] Lamb that lamb is not an
[37:13] animal because when John look at him he
[37:16] said Behold the Lamb of God he was a
[37:18] human being amen amen so what I'm trying
[37:22] to say is God is male and female amen
[37:27] the Bible says in the book of 2
[37:28] Corinthians chapter
[37:30] 4:4 in whom the God of this world has
[37:33] Blended the minds of them which believe
[37:36] not L the light of the Glorious gospel
[37:39] of
[37:40] Christ who is the image of God should
[37:45] shine unto them so the image of God is
[37:48] Christ yes and Man was created in the
[37:52] image of God
[37:54] yes I'm reading the Bible my friend amen
[37:57] amen so the man that was created was a
[38:01] Christ male and female because God
[38:05] himself is male and female amen when God
[38:10] uh concluded the sixth day God never say
[38:14] it is
[38:15] good but he used something different in
[38:19] Genesis 1 verse uh 31 the Bible say and
[38:23] God
[38:24] s everything that he had made and behold
[38:28] he was very good no longer good very
[38:32] good everything double male female his
[38:37] own reflection male female then God say
[38:40] he was very good if you notice no
[38:44] marriage
[38:45] ceremony was initiated in Genesis 1
[38:51] ahead I let you soak in my friend
[38:54] because they were already
[38:56] connected they were already United they
[39:00] only have one name both male and female
[39:03] they were they could not be
[39:06] separated God created them hook
[39:10] together so when God call
[39:13] Adam it's Adam and Eve coming together
[39:17] when go when God say
[39:21] blessing the break
[39:24] my soon is going to be blessing and
[39:27] someone call
[39:29] [Applause]
[39:35] blessing are we together in Genesis
[39:39] chapter 2 something happened now in
[39:42] verse 7 the bible says and the Lord God
[39:46] form man of the Dust of the ground and
[39:50] breathe into his nostal the breath of
[39:52] life and Man became a living soul
[39:57] Verse 18 and the Lord God say it is not
[40:01] good for the first time when he created
[40:05] everything it is good it is good it is
[40:08] good at the end he say it is very good
[40:11] for the first time God say it is not
[40:14] good what happened why is it not good
[40:19] let the scripture answer and the Lord
[40:21] God say it is not good that man should
[40:26] be alone
[40:29] in Genesis when he created man he was
[40:31] male and female in Genesis 1 but in
[40:35] Genesis 2 when God formed man from the
[40:38] dust of the earth men came up as one
[40:42] individual it was no longer a reflection
[40:45] of
[40:46] God he was no longer the image and the
[40:51] likess of God because the image and the
[40:54] likeness of God from the Animal Kingdom
[40:57] all the way to the human species it's
[40:59] always male and female but now we found
[41:03] one male am no female and God himself
[41:07] who created Adam look he say wait a
[41:09] minute something doesn't look
[41:12] right in Genesis 1 it was a union in the
[41:17] spirit because God is a spirit so Adam
[41:21] and Eve were spiritual being but in
[41:24] Genesis 2 they were no longer spiritual
[41:26] being he was natural being but he
[41:29] appeared to be only one a male and God
[41:34] look he say it is no longer good that
[41:37] Adam remain alone in other word Adam is
[41:41] no longer reflecting me the way I want
[41:44] it to be reflected amen so God found a
[41:48] solution he said you know what I will
[41:50] make him a help me to him to save time
[41:56] amen he put Adam under a general
[42:00] anesthesia amen and never took another
[42:05] ground never never took another piece of
[42:08] dust he went to the very body of
[42:11] Adam and preform a surgery and pull a
[42:15] rib and from that rib God created or
[42:19] form a woman amen and God brought the
[42:22] woman back again to man then at that
[42:26] point
[42:29] what was manifested in flesh sir begin
[42:32] to
[42:33] again reflect what was
[42:36] Heaven in other word
[42:39] marriage on this Earth is only a
[42:45] reflection of the true image of God Amen
[42:49] when you bring a woman and unite her
[42:51] with a man we actually bringing both
[42:55] entities both species both male and
[42:59] emale and female back again to the
[43:02] original position am amen so now today
[43:06] brother blessing you really going to
[43:08] reflect
[43:13] God Amen so marriage is only a bond that
[43:18] unite us back again to our original
[43:21] image and through marriage then we can
[43:24] reflect God because God created
[43:27] everything pair God is male and female
[43:30] and his children brother blessing you're
[43:33] going to be today male and female are we
[43:38] together Paul says this this is the
[43:40] reason he says this in the book of
[43:42] Ephesians he said this is a great
[43:44] mystery but I speak concerning Christ
[43:49] and the church brother Bram says this in
[43:53] the mar uh in the message the marriage
[43:55] of the lamb in
[43:57] 1962 paragraph 63 brother brandham say I
[44:01] like to think of
[44:03] weddings I have had the privilege of
[44:06] marrying quite a few people and I think
[44:09] when I bring a young man like brother
[44:12] blessing and a young woman like sister
[44:16] jerusha down to the Altar and see them
