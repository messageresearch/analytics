mic so you bear with me i just need to get used to it you pull the let's go to our bible amos chapter 3 waiting on the projector 270 slider amos chapter 3. verse 6 as the working on the computer if you're there you can say amen shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid because the trumpet have always a message to it amen shall there be evil in the city and the lord has not done it amen the evil you think him and is doing who gave him the seal amen make sense praise the name of the lord hallelujah amen shall there be evil in the city and the lord has not done it surely it's clear not even a game or a guess surely the lord will do something you might be seated surely the lord will do so there is nothing that god can do nothing this is not my program this is god's program there is nothing nothing shall i hide to abraham nothing amen the lord will do the lord god will do nothing but in other words unless or except he reveal his secret to his servants the teacher to his servant the pastor 37 the evangelist to his servant the apostle to his servant the prophet so if you want to know the secret of god you must get in contact with the prophet without the prophet you are blind amen according to god's program he doesn't do anything but he passes through the prophet god in sandra times and his diverse mother spoke to our father by the door amen praise the name of the lord verse 8 the lion has ruled in revelation 10. who will not fear the lord god has spoken who shall not but again the prophet let's go to second corinthians chapter three amen brother david just give me a little bit more i hope i'm not gonna defend someone but i'm gonna blast the devil amen second corinthians chapter three if you dare you can say amen right it's coming okay verse six who also has made us a minister of the new testament not of the letter but off though you need the attack clear for the letter [Music] you want to play with the bubble you want to play with the bible you want to interpret the bible you need a prophet he will kill you for the letter killeth but the spirit gives life amen verse seven but if the the administration or the ministry of what death written and engraving if you notice the ministration of death that killed here the administration was written amen that's why the letter killed us if the meditation of death written and engraved in stone was glorious he was popular he made such a havoc everybody was troubled because of this ministry because death was on the land everybody was crying in sackcloth you caught it now even more the car tore his clothes because of the letter that killed us amen and that letter was written in the name of the king and seal with the seal of the king but that letter killeth amen so that the children of israel could not set fastly behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away the law put you in jail but that glory have to be done away amen how shall not the ministry the ministration of the spirit be rather in other words not the lord not liver but the tribe of judah is more glorious amen last one revelation chapter 14. amen bear with me i believe you should know the story esther 4 esther 5 as the 6th you should be familiar with it revelation chapter 14 if you dare you can say a man yeah if you knew in the message hang tight verse 6 and i saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach to them that dwell on the earth and to every nation and kindred and tongue and people now we have one angel they already spoke about the 144 thousand at the beginning now the bible opened up with three special angel the first one the bible says that he have an everlasting gospel everybody clear praise the name of the lord the first one just so we can remember the first danger have an everlasting everlasting gospel who is that angel you want to know the secret go to the prophet verse 7 saying with a loud voice fear god verse 7 and give glory to him for the hour of his judgment is come and worship him that made heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of water verse 8 and there follow another angel that's the second one saying babylon is fallen is falling that great city because she made all nation drink of the wine of the wrath of her so the second angel is dealing with uncleanness everybody clear fornication coming from babylon amen verse 9 and the third angel so you can see one two three and the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice if any man worship the beast and his image and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand so the third angel is doing with is dealing with the mark of the beast amen verse 10 the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of god not the wine of babylon which is poured out with that mixture into the cup of his indignation anger and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb so first of all the lord god does nothing but if you want to know his secret you got to go to the prophet without the prophet you are blind that is clear amen because lack of the prophet that's why we had loose end amen praise the name of the lord the letter killeth there is death there it is written it's a letter but the spirit giveth life then on revelation 14 we have three angels the first one have an everlasting gospel the second one is doing dealing with the fornication of babylon uncleanness and the third one is dealing with the mark of the disc let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy father and for everything you're doing for us father thank you for giving us another opportunity to be gathered together while there is still time around the revealed word of the hour lord we are committing this service unto the hand be the alpha and the omega lord may the devil and his army every kind of spirit every spying spirit every demonic spirit whether it's sickness or whatever it is coveted or whatever it is lord father made the be completely sealed out of this place and made nothing but the holy spirit and the holy angel lord be sailed in this place may you give us a clear revelation of your word may you speak to us lord father move me completely out of the way lord and take this service for your glory in the name of jesus christ amen praise the name of the lord let's go to esther chapter four that's where we stop last time everybody ready the king of hazards three fists and esther to banquet part nine brother stephen too many parts if i would have stopped in this sermon and give you all of them in one day you won't get it amen king ahazarest three feasts and esther to banquet praise the name of the lord we found out that in esther chapter four where we were last sunday we introduced a chamberlain that was assigned by the king and the name of the chamberlain was attack which when we decode by the prophet we found out that heartache spoke of the holy spirit because esther wanted to know exactly what was going on with mordecai esther approached mordecai in a corner way and mordecai rejected the government of esther and sent the government back again to western then esther remember that there was a chamberlain that the king has appointed to me he's a chamberlain of communication he's a chamberlain of revelation he's a chamberlain that can decode the word and the son of the prophet he's a chamberlain that if he's not there mordecai will never speak to you and if you want to know the meaning of what mordecai is doing if you want to know the message of mordecai you need to get in contact with the chamberlain core head attack so we found out that a communication opened up between esther and modica through the chamberlain and we explained to you that mordecai is the top of the messenger of the seven church ages and then he is also a type of the message because what branham told us that the message and the messenger are one and the same that's the reason why in the message the rapture brother branham said the shout is the message and you go down the road brother branham said the shout is the messenger brother branham did not contradict himself but the message and the messenger are one and the same you cannot separate the two amen so right here we see three people appearing there the first one we have a high tuck which is a top of the spirit everybody clear the second one we have esther which is a top of the bride amen and the third one we have a prophet mordeca which is our top of the prophet so we have the spirit the bride and the prophet and all three are saying the same thing everybody cleared so far now when we look on verse 7 of esther chapter 4 if you can go with me the bible says everybody there few people amen and mordechai told him toward her attack amen so on first seven here we found out that there is a verbal message of mordecai anybody following me and mordecai told him all that had happened to him amen there was a letter that was written the letter was written in the name of the king and the letter was sealed by the seal of the king so when they take that letter and they hand it to you if you read the letter you're going to say that king ahazarest wrote the letter if you look at the letter your interpretation will be that king ahazarus was the one that wrote the letter he's the one that have concealed everything within it and he's the one that sealed the letter with his own signet amen so if you take that letter the message of that letter was death anybody clear it was a message to kill mordecai it was a message to kill the jews because all have seen and come short of the glory of god everybody clear so when you look at the letter the letter condemn you to death the letter condemned you to be killed the letter condemned you to be separated from the presence of the king amen and if you take that letter the way he was given and you start preaching with that letter you're going to be preaching to the people that listen to me king of hazarus is saying say amen and the people say amen hallelujah king justice is saying that on the 30th day of the month we're going to kill the jews you say amen you're going to kill the women amen you're going to kill their men amen you're going to kill their children amen and you're going to build a church upon a ladder that can kill you everybody clear but that letter have a background story amen that letter have a story behind it but that story was not written in the letter [Applause] are you following me you can read the letter every day of your life and you will never know the dick to decode the letter you will never know why was the letter written what is the thought behind the letter who truly wrote the letter who is truly after the jews but you won't be preaching to the people a false message are we okay praise the name of the lord he says that and he told him all that have happened in other words there is a story two things on verse seven the first one mordecai told him all that has happened that all that happened was not found in the letter anybody follow me amen and of the sum of what the money that haman had promised to pay to the king's treasury for the jews to destroy them so they later have the sum of money and all that happened but when you read the letter it doesn't say nothing about the sum of money when you read the letter it doesn't say nothing about the conflict between mordecai and heaven that letter have nothing but what was written there everybody read it let's go to verse eight and he gave him a the copy the second part is the written message anybody following me there is a verbal message and there is a written message the verb the written message everybody have it he was sent throughout the entire kingdom of king a hazard everybody can show you the written message everybody in the entire world have the written message but they don't have the verbal or the spoken message let's go to verse 8. also he gave him the copy of the written of the decree that was given as tuition to destroy them so over there it's a copy of the riding let's see a little bit what happened go back to esther chapter 3 hallelujah everybody connected praise the name of the lord esther chapter 3 verse 6. everybody there and he taught scorn speaking of mordecai to lay hand on mordechai alone he doesn't want to kill mordechai alone for they have showed him the people of mordecai wherefore heaven sought to destroy all the jews this is now this is your background everybody there that were throughout the whole kingdom of hazaras even the people of who we already explained to you the people of mordecai verse 9 if he please the king let it be written that they may be destroyed and i will pay ten thousand of talent of silver to the hand of those that have charge of the business to bring it into the king treasury everything here happened in secret this conversation of money happened in the secret between the king and between emman mordecai was not there are you following me so the background or the first verbal message was a message that gives you the true story behind the letter everybody clear praise the name of the lord job to verse 13 let's look at the written copy everybody there and the what the letter now the copy of the letter the letter was sent by post into what everybody all the king's provinces to do what to destroy to kill we already seen this last sunday and to cause to perish all the jews both young and old little children and women in one day even upon the 13th day of the 12th month which is the month header and to take the spoil of them forever pray that's all that the letter is saying here the letter does not tell you that there was a conflict between mordechai and heaven the letter doesn't not tell you that there was money that was given behind the back ever here but for you to know that background you need to get in contact with the prophet everybody here you need not only the written message but you need the spoken message [Applause] is everybody following me amen because that leader was sealed with the kingship do you need somebody who can decode the kingship amen because we have the bible that was also sealed with the king's hill and people were preaching with a seal book amen they were giving people what was written in the message in the bible are you there but they lack the revelation of what was in the back part man of god hallelujah they can tell you about abraham they can tell you about jacob they can tell you about isaac but when a prophet comes he goes before the beginning he goes back in the mind of god he gets in the mind of god he watches the man of god then the prophet come and give you the spoken word the spoken message are you following me the verbal message and the written message i won are you following me you can never separate i'm gonna say it again you can never separate the verbal or the spoken message with the written message are you there they are both one one is just hidden and another one is handed to everybody are you there so the spoken word is actually the original seed are you there are you following me the spoken word developer message that was given by monika is the original story are you following me if you want to know the original story you need the spoken word are you there and it's written between the line but what you're gonna be doing with the copy you just gonna kill people because the message of the copy killeth the copy condemns you the copy condemns your children the copy condemns your wife their coffee condemn your business their copy condemn everything that you have but to go around that copy you need the spoken word message hallelujah this one is unwritten the first the second one is written are you there so your bible was healed and this is the reason why we are in trouble with not more than 900 different denominations because the bible was healed and it takes a prophet to give you the background of the bible are you there you can never separate the message from the bible the message and the bible are one the message is actually the story of the background that was hidden in the bible [Applause] amen so when they give you the story of mordecai when you get the copy you're not going to be preaching like everybody are you there when everybody's saying they're going to kill your children when you come there you say nobody will kill your children because you are a queen you are in contact with the king are you there your way of preaching will be different and that preaching you must be in contact with mordecai when you get the background of mordecai the way you preaching that is different if they ask you you say no there is nothing about the death it is just a plot there is a man by the name of mordecai are you there and there is a man by the name of haman who is the prime minister brother where is that written at him [Applause] are you following me was the story of modern car lie was that story written in the copy [Music] are you there you don't take the written word to challenge the spoken word [Applause] are you following me you take the spoken word and the spoken word will make you understand the written word are you there when mordecai comes and he say you know what i see herman he was giving ten thousand talent of money and somebody come to you he said where is that it show me ten thousand here show me ten thousand on here there's no ten thousand your message is false are you there if you are rejecting the spoken word you are rejecting your mercy [Applause] are you following me because the mercy of the jews came by the message of mordechai you need to get instruction for mordecai in order to overcome heaven if you don't get destruction from all the cow you're gonna get killed [Applause] amen if maldika says that i was going out and everybody was bowing down and nobody want to bow i mean nobody would have stood i was alone are you going to believe mordechai show me the proof show me the proof amen everything is written in the book amen and if you notice the king himself never gave any detail to the queen are you there the king never called esther to tell esther esther you know what something is going on yeah my prime minister came today and he explained me about a certain people in the country no the king hushed the king closed his mouth if you go to the king his silence but to break the silence of the king to break the silence of the seven seal you need the prophet are you there because the lord will do except he reveal his secret to mordechai are you there if you notice the king never disclosed the secret but the king has another in that order he have to go liver the prophet now you have the spirit the bride and the prophet brother branham in the days of the seventh messenger in the days of the lord this energy its messenger will reveal the mysteries of god as revealed to paul he will what spoken word amen and those who receive that prophet in his own name we receive the the beneficent effect of that prophet and they that he him will be what and become part of what of the last so to be part of the product of the last day you must listen to brother branham amen you must listen to william marion branham who are mentioned in revelation 22 17. the what heartache and uh esther say what the corn of wheat the bread with that fell into the ground at night here has come back up to the original word grand again praise god forever yes listen to the authenticated prophet of god who appeared in the last day what he says from who where did mordecai learn that when the king was speaking about the ten thousand mordecai was not there who taught mother called the story [Applause] amen the lord does nothing except he reveal his secret to his monica can tell you that me and hyman have a conflict that one you can say yeah yeah yeah that one i believe i believe that one everybody knows because we have weakness when heaven leaves the palace and we see mordecai standing there he doesn't bow down what about the king giving money amen was modica there was he there before the foundation of the world hallelujah what he says from god the blood will what the high-tech and uh mordecai and esther will be saying that and what they will say will have already been said in the in the copy everybody clear as we progress anyways our staff let's go to verse 8 again and also he gave him a copy of the writing of the decree that was given as sushan to destroy them so the first part they uncover the ministry of the antichrist amen there were four cavalry four horses that were bundled up into one by the color so the first thing they uncovered the fourth sales anybody there now number two to what to show it to esther this is a hater to show it to esther and to declare or to explain are you following me the one who shows you and the one who explained to you is the holy spirit amen to show it to esther and to declare or explain to esther and to what so this spirit this man have first to show and declare or explain and then he have to put you in charge not just giving you the mystery but that spirit will put you into action amen and to put and to charge her that she should go into the the king to make what supplication to him and to make a request before him and her people now let's go to first corinthians chapter two keep esther chapter four praise the name of the lord everybody good let's go to first corinthians chapter two we are still dealing with hatak hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord first corinthian chapter 2 verse 7 but we speak what the wisdom of god anybody knows what the wisdom of god is are you there everybody know what the wisdom of god is okay do you see first corinthians chapter one go back to verse 24 first corinthians chapter one just the first chapter before chapter two i want you to see it in your bible everybody there but to them which are called both jews and greek gentiles who everybody clear christ christ the what the power of god karma and so the wisdom of god is who let's go back to second corinthians chapter seven we clear now you can't sleep now first corinthians chapter 2 verse 7 but we speak there in other words we speak who are we okay now we speak christ in the air how can you preach christ without a mystery we need to preach christ we need to preach christ paul said that he preached christ in a mystery [Music] we need to preach the copy we need to preach the copy you preach the copy in the mystery you preach the copy with the background of mordecai [Music] a mystery brother branham by the mystery require what o never becomes amen the lord does nothing except by death mordecai are you there but that mystery requires heart attack or it will never become everybody clear let's go back now but we speak the wisdom of god christ in a mystery we need the spirit even the what you remember not the written one the hidden one you see the mystery the hidden wisdom which was which god ordained before the world 2 hour so that was before even yo before they wrote the letter by heaven there was already a mystery [Music] but when they put the letter they omitted those mysteries you need the seventh chamberlain to bring you the seven unknown thunders let's go down which none of the places of this world no that's why jesus said the world will see me no more which none of the princes of this world knew forehead they know it everybody following me if they have a glass of this mystery if they understood the mystery if they knew the mystery come on they will not have crucified the lord of glory but to know the mystery you need the spirit so when someone crucify the word when someone rejects the word when someone crucify christ which is the message amen the consequence the cause of it is they never knew or understand their mystery and a lack of understanding the mystery is a lack of the holy ghost the holy ghost can get onto your flesh he can get into your spirit make you do stuff but you're going to miss the revelation judah did it amen but he missed pentecost let's go verse 9 but as it is written eyes have nothing if you look at the copy you don't see it this is the copy where is the ten thousand brother branham said that but where is that in the bible eyes have nothing are you okay this foundation is crushed amen no here have what so when they give you the story you say where did you get that because your ear never heard your ear only heard the message of heaven not the background eyes have not seen written no he taps are you there that's why the message is email here hearing form and as have not seen not here it is in your bible anybody there neither have what into the you see where it goes not in the head everybody understand when you read it or when you listen to the tape it gets get to get into there you understand now neither enter into the heart of man the what things which god had prepared for them that for esther are you there there is a love between the king and nest but god has revealed them to who by his by attack everybody following me are we clear by his spirit for their search of everybody clear attack knows how to get the entire story amen when you send him when he comes he gives you the copy he gives you the background he gives you everything and he pull everything to you are you there for the spirit searching for all things yeah the what you want to know the deep friends of god you need god and that spirit must be connected to her hallelujah verse 11 for what man knows the spirit of a man save the spirit of a man which is inna how can you know the thought of brother kalima except the spirit which is in brother kalima so for you to know the thought of barack obama brother karim i have to give you his spirit are you there even so the things of god know us but god have a way to know his secret the prophet of old when moved by there you understand clear now that's why rejecting a prophet is deadly even the things of god knows no man by the spirit of god now we have received not the spirit of the world because we're going to crucify the messiah but the spirit which is of god that we met the things that are given unto that's the reason why the king appointed attack the king appointed attack to esther so esther can know the things that the king have given freely to esther are you there as long as you don't engage as long as you don't depend as long as you don't connect with high-tech you will not get access to the things that are freely given to you by god that's why you must be born again you must have the holy ghost [Music] if not you're going to struggle with the message you're going to be sending garment you will try to protect him and you will try to hold on to the message you will try to protect the message yeah i still believe brother branham even though i'm doubting this i'm doubting this out dante unless a reference drop if somebody just shake you like this you out amen but if you have the revelation where they understand it oh i don't understand where they are saw it i don't so i still believe it amen before you can understand the message i already believe in you how can you explain it how can i explain you why i love my wife [Applause] how can i explain to you [Applause] how can i explain to you why i love my wife oh because she's beautiful i can tell you that one i can tell you the second one there will come a part where i can explain them [Applause] amen that part is the key [Applause] amen if i say beautiful they can show you somebody pretty if i say she walk good they can show you a miss america if i say this is what is going on they can show you the she just go they can show you this but there is something that cannot show me you must be me to understand that [Applause] why do you love her i don't know i was just going and something said boom what is boom i don't know it's a thunder it is a thunder it is the thunder that check the devil [Applause] she get mad and still love it [Applause] why do you love it look at the way she's getting mad i don't know hallelujah i don't know if i'm going to move here amen verse 13 which thinks also we speak not in the world which means wisdom teaches by which the high tech teaches comparing what with spiritual not corner things with spiritual are you there but the natural man the first part of a man that spirit the natural man receives not think softer so when you come you say attack say that there was a conspiracy there was this this going on the natural men said this is your own story that you make up me i still believe the copy a natural man put him in contact with attack then he said oh i never seen this before amen the natural men receive not the things of the spirit for they are what foolishness that's why the message sounds not logical you understand now amen foolishness to him neither can he know them because they are what spiritually discern press the name of the lord go to second corinthians chapter four hallelujah everybody still happy praise the name of the lord second corinthians chapter four verse 3. but if our gospel be what so what we preach is hidden when we preach we're going to tell you that there was a conspiracy we're gonna tell you that there was ten thousand of shaker that was given our gospel is hidden it is not easily seen in the scripture are you there it is hidden it is hidden to them i'm reading the bible amen in whom the god of this world has done what you see why people rejected blinded the mind of them which believe it's a matter of faith revelation lest the light of the glorious gospel of what that gospel is preached in mystery not just plain gospel you're going to bring death are you there the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine upon them verse 5 for we preach not ourselves but who the wisdom of god in a mystery request jesus the lord and ourself your servant for jesus sake look at hebrew i have it here on board for you for it is what for those who are worse and have tested not eaten tested they just it's good are you there they have just tested after heavenly gift and were made partake of the and half what of the gold word of what they tested the message and the power of the world to come if they shout i'm reading you to this to do what unto what there is no coming back seeing the heaven to themself dog afresh and put him into her you need the holy spirit let's go to esther chapter four anybody clear esther chapter four verse eight you see one verse how long it takes and also gave him the copy of the riding of the decree that was given a shushan to destroy them to show it to esther and to declare to him and to charge her that she should go into the king the second part is they are pulling esther into a charge a charge is what to go to the king to do what to make supplication to him and to make what before him of her people if you go in philippians 4 i have it on the board for you the bible says be careful for in other words be not anxious for anything but in everything that happened in your life by what and what go make what everybody there by prayer and supplication with we talk about the last time last sunday let your be made unto and then the peace of god which passes all shall keep you and mind into christ mother can say attack say go to the king go fulfill philippians 4. go make a request to the king amen let's jump to verse nine let me put it there an attack came and told esther the word of mordecai against the spoke to attack and give him commandment to mordecai in other words he sent a reply all the king's servants and the people of the king provinces we touched on this before do know that whatsoever where the man or woman shall go to the king into the inner court the holy of holiest everybody clear who is not what because in the old testament for you to go into the holy of holies you must be a levert and you must be called to be the high priest everybody clear the holy of holies there is only one law we are dealing with the law two of his to put him to what he was deaf to go into the holy of holies that's the reason why when the high priest went there they have to put banks in case he died nobody get there to pick him up you're gonna die they just pull him from the van and he comes out esther is saying something she's still struggling with the law you know mordecai if i get there i can get killed amen accept such to whom the king shall hold out there we explain to you this that he may leave so now when they gave her commission fear pop up you know what if i get there i'm gonna be killed how can you be killed being the queen hebrew for we have not er not the old testament which cannot be touched by the feeling of our infirmities but was in so there is no temptation that jesus didn't receive in all point tempted like as we are yet without if you want to overcome go tell jesus give me the virtue that you overcome such and such and such temptation are you there jesus will open his briefcase and he said what are you struggling with this is the way i overcome this is the prescription take a moxi ceiling take 500 milligrams take clander massive take 300 milligram are you there let us therefore come what ester go to the king godly we are not under levitical priests we are under the priesthood of judah come broadly unto them you see for her it is a throne of grace for everybody else when they enter there they're going to get killed but when as they come they can't put the golden set showing that it is the throne of grace for my queen esther did not know she's still uncertain about the love of god she doesn't know yes he chose me but i don't know if he's angry with me if he loves me or not monica said let's deal with this go ahead attack begin to push her go ahead and you want to discover that he loves you more than you think what you think is the throne of judgment it is actually a turn of grace that we may obtain what the god accepted and found to help in the time of what you are in need somebody's threatening for your life and you want to sit down under fear you need to move boldly before god and talk to god as your queen not get in prayer and say you know father no when you get there you say i am your wife go ask a sister how do they ask their stuff hebrews 10 having therefore brethren what to enter into the by the blood of who yesterday according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in jesus our lord in whom we have what and what with what by defense of what you cannot be scared of your husband because perfect love cast out what [Applause] are you there i don't know if i need to put my hand around my husband something is wrong if it's your husband you come and you put it like this and nothing happened you must have the right blessing [Applause] are you there heaven therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus christ brother i'm explaining think of it what that is the greatest word there is in the christian church today is what and the reason they are afraid is because they are not that's why we are teaching the reason why they are afraid because they are not taught right and settle right on there that's why you are sure the man that you talk to is not a higher man like that he's not the heir he's a person he has feelings and he can be touched by your feelings when you hurt he hurt him when he hurt you he understand don't talk to him as a god that's your problem talk to him as a man demand jesus christ are you there he was a man because god was made flesh in the beginning was and the word was with and the word was and the word was made what it is a man when you say ouch he remember when they whip him amen it is not a god that doesn't bleed it is a bleeding lamber he was bleeding he was crying he said my father my father why have they forsaken me father if it's your your will can you please get away with this temptation so when your temptation is stronger and you want to deviate he knows that he did it himself hallelujah let's go to verse 11. where am i at praise god hallelujah praise god anybody there hallelujah let's go to verse uh verse 11 all the king servant and the people of the king provinces do know that whatsoever whether man or woman shall come into the inner court the holy of holies who is not called if you are not a leaver we are not on the levitical priesthood we are under melchizedek now there is only one law of his to put him to death except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden septum that he may leave but i have not been called to come into the king for this what why did the king stop calling esther are you there not two days not three days not four days but 30 days perfection and your eternity which is a circle which is number eight because number eight take two circles that's why your marriage you got two rings are you there because it's a mate from eternity your wife put one and you put one when you join them together number eight we start with you honey we're going with you back to eternity [Music] hallelujah hallelujah you need a perfection you need number three connected with number zero are you there why did the king stop calling him the king used to sit and say call me queen este the king said ah so she doesn't come except i call her are you there if i don't call her she's not interested hallelujah hallelujah i am the one that is like if people look at me it looks like i am the one forcing this relationship you read between the line right it's a pastoral message are you there i remember i am the only one that brings flower i am the only one that brings a gift she is just thank you thank you thank you the king said stop hallelujah let me see if she loves me hallelujah esther said 30 days for some reason mordecai you know what 30 days i wonder this king he seems like does he have another wife for what let me see your phone call who are you texting today who are you texting nowadays yeah you didn't see me hallelujah when they were giving you compliment you didn't appreciate it you take it you took it for granted now they stop it hallelujah then you are trouble who are you talking to give me your passcode i want to know he's not talking to anybody matter of fact when he's at work he's still thinking about you but when he gets home are you there jesus one day was with the disciple on the road to a medicine he talked to them as they get closer to the town jesus said bye-bye i'm going are you there but the love that they have begin to burn like where are you going no no no no no no no no no no come and stay with us stay with us at night okay you'll kill you it's too late come come come come come why did he act like he was going are you there he never came straight he said i'm going to abraham house he was kind of passing abraham abraham said pass me not a gentle savior hello he said i have a trouble here my wife is barren she cannot have a child come on here are you there madaka 30 days by the way 30 days he's not calling me i don't know what i mean so how can i do that hallelujah and as david depresses said to me today no no if these lazy pentecostal people would get up to do something instead of trying to take a ring sad seat and watch god do it get used to god doing it the church won't be moving on i think that is right get up and move god is expecting you you are the branches your hand is his hand your lips is his lips your thought is his thought as i said last night nathan said to david do all that is in your heart for god is with you god is with his people in his people guarding you the hope of glory see guarding his people he is tabernacle if i take this money and i buy him a cake he will say why did you touch this money buy that cake let's see and i want you to listen then out of the word of natan he said oh don't fail to get this now get between the line david do all that is in your heart for god is with you oh my when i think of that david do all that is in your heart for god is with you why cry to me why do you always wait for me to come to you god is with you speak and go forward god has anointed you you don't have to be waiting for me all the time [Applause] you don't understand who you are when the bride will recognize who she's hello can i drive your car hallelujah i am hungry can i swap that credit card to to buy some all this garden you don't know who you are if he gives you trouble come and see me god is with you speak and go forward god has anointed you move on talk him how around say this or that or the other should i believe god should i trust him for this trust him for every breath that you draw [Applause] that's why he stopped because you got used to feeling him you got used to i feel something yeah yeah yeah he's with me he stopped all of that are you going to believe that i'm still with you till the end of the week oh you still want me to bring you the sensation [Applause] that's why i cut you off for 30 days are you there hallelujah let's drop down and they talked to mordechai's the word then mordecai commanded the answer esther think not you with yourself that you shall escape in the king's house more than all the jews for if you all together hold your peace you skip with the attitude you are still waiting waiting waiting amen then shout their enlargement and deliverance arrives to the jews from another place but you and your i thought her father was dead i thought her mother was dead there were only two human mordechai in other words me and you are gonna be dead i'm not going down myself i just want to tell you if i go down you go down are you there but i cannot act this is the this is not revelation 10 1 to 7 10 1 2 2 2 7 that's my ministry now this is revelation 10 8 2 11. that is not me anymore i cannot touch that part that part belongs to you but if you don't do that part i'm not gonna get resurrected my tomb is in jeffersonville you must get back to your position hallelujah shall be destroyed and who knows whether only her attack can give you this who knows whether you are come to the kingdom for such a time as in other words you don't know let me explain to you the reason why you were chosen and placed in that position is not for you to play games it was because there was something coming up and it will require you to do something are you there then now the revelation comes they dealt with the fear that's why brother brother i'm preaching not free no you're not afraid you're not afraid you're not afraid are you there and then esther beat them return give them the answer mordecai decency go gather together all the jews that are present in susha i'm still good at choosing amen and do what fast you for me and neither eat no drink how many days night oh whatever you saw why you say that you say why you say that amen do not eat fast for how many days three days night time if you look at this language it is a language that was spoken by jonah are you okay check yourself now amen jonah enter into the belly of the well how many days and what and the miracle of jonah spoke up the resurrection are you there that's why in john in matthew chapter 12 verse 40 they say what they say as jonah was what three days and three nights in there so the son of man must be what three days and three now but if you notice jesus never was three days and three nights [Music] you ready esther have to fight for how many days and three nights and then do what go to the king in other words day one fasting day two fasting day three fasting day four going to the king right one two three then go to the king you ready wake up take chapter five this is your answer take chapter five are you there let's see first one now he came to pass on there stop ready how do you see this stuff brother stephen are you there you need a prophet are you there according to the copy you must wait day one day two day three and day four you go to the king that's the copy are you there and the people begin to believe because jesus died on friday friday saturday sunday he rose again which is not three days because he wrote sunday earlier and the people that rejected the message and begin to play with the copy to justify for three days they say you know what jesus died on thursday i'm not gonna call name where did you get it because you want to justify the copy if you come to the prophet the prophet will help you up based on what we read on verse 16 he says three days then i will go to the king it says one two three four to the king but on verse chapter five verse one we found out that she fasted she fasted here she broke the fast [Music] she went to see the king not on the fourth day as you can read with your intellectual. she goes to the king under [Music] jonah three days jesus three days that's what matthew 12 40 say we got to justify it brother branham questioned an answer in matthew 12 40 it says as jonah was three days and three nights in the west bayley so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth how can it be that day so i say today that they say he was put in the tomb on friday i don't know where they get thursday former rejecting the message on friday evening and rose on sunday morning friday saturday sunday not today morning evening then the whole day then earlier so it's like you put this almost two days one day half half are you there okay he was put on the tomb on friday evening and wrote sunday morning making it what two days and one day what i mean now if you notice he say us you need a prophet because god revealed nothing but by the way you see in the days when jonah was in the in the belly three days and three nights it's within i want to see the scripture i want to see the scripture brother stephen that that's brother brother let me see the scripture within three days and three nights within that three days and three nights because you can make the scripture lie the prophet said i will not suffer my only one to see what neither will i leave his soul in hell and corruption set in human body in what which is three days and three nine sometime within that three days and three nights that he must come forward from there so being three days and three nights though he has to be when esther said three days and three nights it doesn't mean exactly like that [Applause] you need a prophet it is sometime within that three days and three nights he had to come forth because the prophecy cannot be broken he could not see corruption and he would have corrupted if he stays exactly that time that's brother's brother explanation i want to see it in the bible you ready let me bring the vaccine are you are you there john chapter 2 jesus answered and said to them destroy what i'm going slowly god branham didn't give you that but i saw it through brother branham it's a channel of inspiration destroy what what is the temple destroy this temple and in not after three days i'm giving you vaccine i'm giving you vaccine now so when they send you a text or when they go on facebook after listening to me and begin to give you i'm giving you vaccine amen and what in not after three days i'm reading to verify in your bible verify i don't want you to say brother steven say and in not after i will what rest what who is it the temple then save the jews 46 years colonel connor was this temple built they are looking oh this was built 46 years the seven weeks of daniel i had already let me leave it alone and will that we read up in what even the jews understood but when you reject the message you lose even that but he speak of the temple of what oh so the temple means his body bear with me in three days when therefore he was risen from the dead his disciple remember that he said this unto them and they believe the written part and are written apart are we okay are we okay i have not finished my injection is still going are you there mark chapter 14 and there arose certain and bear what ah brother stephen this is a false witness so you're gonna use the scripture of a false witness this is let me keep it it's a false witness so what he says is false against him saying we have heard him say i won't destroy this temple that is made with him and what the false witness is saying with him but stephen you cannot use this scripture because this is a false witness three days i will build another one made without hand it is true my friend you who gonna listen to me after all who sneak in at this time it is true it's a false witness but let me help you up and so deceiving is the wrong thing now a lie if it's just right out in real life then anyone can detect it but that lie that has got about 99 truth in it that is the one that is so it should i have how many percentages relax i'm still going with the injection oh errol has what the biggest lie was ever told head nandy we already know percent truth in it they like that set and talk to who so this this man is lying if he's lying there is a part of a truth in what is lying now remind me what john 2 says destroy what that's what john said that was the word of jesus christ let's see his lie and let's see the part of the truth if you notice there is a blue color over there let's see we heard him say jesus i will stop did jesus say i will he never say jesus said destroy this temple that's the blue that's the truth we are pulling the true father life are you following me are you following me is everybody saying that so i will is a lie jesus didn't say i will destroy jesus said destroy this temple this is truth this is lie everybody clear let's move on that is made with hand did jesus say that that's a lie are we clear and jesus said that yes in three days with him you see that within three days that is the truth i will build another the temple jesus was speaking was what brother branham say resurrection is not replacement replacement means another temple but resurrection is the same temple that went it's the same one that come out so another is a lie you follow me so another is a lie made with that hand is a lie so the truth on this first witness my friend who's gonna watch me later and who's sneaking it now destroy this temple and within what the scripture don't lie let me help you up i'm almost finishing i'm going to pull the needle now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the chief priest and the what came together into parliament saying sir we remember that deceiver say why he was here to love what everybody clear after what i will what watch watch watch this now command therefore that disciple can be made sure ah why not until the fourth day the third pilot they say this deceiver say in the fourth day i'm gonna rise up but make sure the tomb is sealed until there because jesus said within we clear now within three days the jews know that the pharisees knew that when they say after three days you see brother stephen three days go back down they're worrying more about the esther went to the king under jesus rose under everybody clear just as sure let me head now i don't know if i'm going to get to the banquet just as sure as he wears jesus out of the grave under what you understand now under what now we begin to go oh what he's going to rest do it what so the church started on the day of pentecost and the holy ghost got into it and babylon came and destroyed the church and put the church into the dark ages but god said i will restore but to restore the church in what it's three days there is a separation between me and the king esther have to work three days to go back into the presence of the king everybody clear notice now to restore the first perfect tree in three days after it's what the dark ages after the first tree death he restored him that was jesus now the bride the tree is going to be restored in what in within in not after you see in three stages rather three stages it shall be restored what one two everybody clear there was a lot of time where there is no more communication with the king are you there but it take what 30 days it takes what three steps to eternity three steps to everybody clear let me jump now in revelation chapter 14. are you still okay or we can stop you we're good there is three angels the first one have an everlasting gospel the second one spoke about fornication on cleanness the third one right here spoke about the mark of the beast who are those angels i'd like you to write down revelation 14 6-12 that is the word three last angel three angel after the seven last day angel there where what three special angel comforts did you notice that and now i want you to notice them three last danger the first that is revelation 14 6-12 the first danger has sanded the trumpet of the gospel and had the everlasting gospel to preach to the world the second kind of preach a holiness gospel i'm going by the prophet see because he said that the church has committed what everybody clear now and the third angel roar out revelation 10 to escape the mark of what watch the first angel at the reformation what is his name esther begin to get back to the kingdom the first day anybody okay preach the gospel second nature who the second day sanctification the fornication he straightened up the church of it but the third message that's why yesterday went into the third day you follow me but the third message the pentecostal message should be the true messenger warning them to escape the mark of the beast saying whoever received the mark of the beast the same will drink of the wrath of god pour it out with that mixture into the cup offending nation be poured out to the people upon the people that is the very message what the third the third the last the lutheran message of what the wesley message of water and the pentecostal message of what everybody clear after this last night it is in your hand he that will disbelieve it willfully after he has received the knowledge of the truth seen the angel of the lord coming proving everything at the last day seeing the everlasting gospel preach to be be preached by who seeing sanctification to be preached by who and now the gospel in here warning you against what the this is the third angel message to the world the third angel message is going forth one in this this is the flying a flying of there so based on the decode of the message these are your three angels are you there there is three special angels they are special because their step is the step god used to actually redeem an individual you must be justified sanctified then fill with the holy ghost water blood life that's why they are special everybody clear the three step of grace justification sanctification baptism of the holy spirit on the day of pentecost the lord came into his temple that temple was destroyed by babylon but in three days in three dispensations justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost then you get in the presence of the kingdom [Music] and when you get in the presence of the king you open the banquet are you following me the problem is the last dispensation is a trouble everybody there what is going on take out the chapter now yeah probably i don't know if i'm gonna cross this everybody clear let's go to actually chapter nine keep esther chapter five don't worry uh with time act chapter 9 if you dare you can say amen you there verse three and as he journey this is speaking about paul when he met the pillar of fire as he journeyed he came near damascus and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven we know that and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying to him so so why persecute that me so saul was completely under a different anointing persecuting the church the message of the hour and he said who are you lord and the lord said i am jesus yes whom you persecute it is hard for you to kick against the pricks and he trembling and astonished say lord what will you have me to do there is a calling of paul here the first thing they're calling and we already understood that when the lord pick a vessel are you there and pick it up it is called what i'm happy with this church everybody there watch closely justification anybody clear arise and go into the city and it shall be told you what you must do verse 8 and saul arose from the earth and when his eyes were opened he saw no man but they led him by the hand and brought him into damascus so after the encounter with the pillar of fire souls become blind something happened to his eyes the blindness of soul was the blindness of the heart that's why he was persecuting the church i'm going to correct you something here are you there everybody clear but when he got in contact with the pillar of fire that blindness that was within him in his heart showed up and blinded his eyes everybody clear everybody clear now it was invisible now it's visible everybody clear hallelujah job two verse nine and he was what god put him into a fast like jonah they put him into a fast like esther you see that and he was three days without sight and neither did he what or what everybody clear they put him in a fast like esther got into the fast i can open fast here but i will keep it for our house meeting if somebody have a question on it because it's a different channel are you there and he was three days without sight and neither did he eat nor drink three days a barbecue and there was a certain disciple in damascus named ananias and to him say the lord in a vision ananias he said be lord i am he i am here lord and the lord said to him arise and go into the street which is called what an inquirer in the house of what why the house of judas somebody cut it jesus have 12 disciple okay you got it and jesus said one of you is what a devil he was speaking of who [Music] everybody clear and jesus was dead and the disciple where eleven number twelve so when they gather together as men they say you know what judah this is act chapter one brother roberts follow me are you there they got to uh after chapter one they said you know what we used to be 12. 12 is a good number it's a number of worship now we are 11. we need to replace number 12 and they begin to cast a lot like heaven are you there when they cast lot they pulled my tires and brother branham said he never done anything i know you were taught that matthias heavy pistol no he never done nothing are you there everybody clear then god want to replace judas you understand now he took paul and put him in the house of who in other words this is your replacement of judas anybody clear hallelujah inquire in the house of who for one couple of tells us for behold he does what he's not bad anymore he has been chosen are you there now it seems like he's sanctifying his life yes yes yes are you there he's in a three days process we okay he prays verse 12 and he has sinned in a what the gift begin to operate you following me justification sanctification restoration of a gift does he have the holy ghost yet they taught you that he was having the holy ghost [Music] are you there then ananias answered lord i have heard by many that this man how much evil he has done in other words this is a bad man watch something job to verse 15 but the lord said to him go your way for he is a what they pick him up justification he is a chosen vessel because paul told us there is two kind of vessels there is the first sense of honor and there is vessel of this honor so god is telling ananias this is a vessel of honor everybody there to me to bear my name before the gentile the king and the children of israel the message of the entire age for i will show him how much how great things he must suffer for my name's sake verse 17. and ananias went his way and entered into the and putting his hand on him say he didn't call him brother because he have the holy ghost as you were taught where we came out he called him brother because they told him he is uh anybody here not because he have the holy ghost are you there your brother so lord the lord even jesus deity ready that appeared to you in the way as you came has sent me that you might receive your and what with the you see now justification sanctification restoration of the gift number four the holy ghost himself are we okay are we okay and immediately they fell from his what the prophetic eye is open and he as he had been scared and he received sight forthwith and arose and was baptized and when he had received what he broke the fast you saw now the first was broken on the fourth day everybody clear he broke the fast now he can move on where are you going brother stephen hallelujah let me hit this and i believe yeah few minutes the holy ghost by what justification you tired the holy ghost by what just a light first day shadow of him the holy ghost by what a little deeper shadow often the holy ghost by what paul began to see vision a deeper shadow now the holy ghost by of it's very being in what we okay now as my hand against the wall will make a shadow more that shadow get deeper and deeper and deeper closer my hand get after while the shadow in my hand becomes the church started in martin luther's time under justification first day of esther on the wesley through sanctification second day getting closer to the king and now in the baptism of the holy spirit with the peste costa the restoration of what paul begin to see vision and out of that pentecostal people he's pulling that remnant up here to show who reflect his life just the same as yesterday today and exactly when the evening light to do what everybody clear now i'm gonna stop here everybody clear go to ester five and we're gonna stop here it's almost yeah seven minutes two thirty and we stop everybody there esther chapter 5 so don't worry for those who has been having that burden your burden has been cast to hell about the time my time is mastered amen chapter 5 now we came to pass under what so esther broke her fast on the third day because when you get hungry your fast is finished because on the third day he made the banquet so he starts she started getting hungry you see that between the liner that's why she make a banquet i thought she was fasting for three days then on the fourth day on the third day she's approaching the king already everybody there on the third day she broke the fast now it came to pass on the third day that esther put on her what she put on a horror up here approaching who the king if you remember when esther was chosen esther was dressed by hagen you remember that he gave a choice if a woman can get go get what you want to dress go to the king the only one that got there and say stop playing games again i am not going to pick anything you know the king you know what the king's like you dress me and i'm gonna go to the king with the dress you put on me hey they say no wonder i choose you from the first day amen she was dressed by hege and went before the king when she went before the king the king picked her up directly now during her fasting she took away her dress because the jews fasted with soft cloth now on the third day she broke the fast she put on the what royal appeal all right on the third day royal appear what is going on with that and we're going to stop here the church is a whole lot like it was in the days of who esther didn't take the perfuming of the women she adorned herself with the modest appeal the hidden men of the and the king said put the crown on her esther was the top of the church today those who are ready to come out and adorn themselves with what of the holy spirit not the perfuming and dressing of the world try to compare with them but the hidden men of what that's the one second message like esther when esther wants to be what we're talking about hey gay to stand before the king she didn't adorn herself with all the things but she had done herself with what make that is what the brad is adorning herself with we fought the what what are the fruit of the spirit joy peace long suffering all of them that's why we taught you last week when you go into the presence of the king you don't put sackcloth you're gonna stand out like modica you must approach him with what thanksgiving with what praises and then when you get there the king door will be open enter into his gate with what thanksgiving that was the first garment esther god right but here they say a royal apparel amen what is going on i am trusting remember when esther is getting into the king she's getting under the commandment of her attack she's going for a petition amen but first you must change your government you must bring the government of prison and put that garment but you need a second garment on you because you are entering for petition notice i am trusting in him someday i don't know when for a what of my ministry i hope he will climb my ministry of this what brother of letting me take the word you follow me close up the world and do what are you there she's going under the commandment of mordecai at the beginning she entered by the commandment of heggie now she is going by the command of mordechai are you there and mordecai must give you uh dress his brother in the clothes of the world and for his righteousness i hope he will crown me let me stand on that day and say behold the lamb of the god that take away the sin of god second quote as we commit ourselves with our offering of the church this morning to you for service for the latter days light for the evening times lights that we might bring consolation and faith to the wedding people that is waiting on what they're coming off the bathroom to do what to dress abroad in what of what preaching mystery everybody christ for the lord jesus too so jesus will receive the people that are dressed by the gospel of christ that's why esther put on the royal apparel because only that one will you be accepted are you there what is the message there and we stop here quite a reading when i was first converted i was ordained in the baptist church i had a good old teacher by the name of who dr roe davis he was a what why did brother branham god allow him to be put under a lawyer he should be under a priest he should be born under a mighty preacher maybe he should be in the church of billy graham but god put him under a lawyer your life is not a hazard they step you going in your life god knows exactly what you need to put you where he wants you to be are you there he was a lawyer before his conversion and he took everything from a legal legal standpoint in the bible her deficit is like yes and god took brother branham and put him under someone who's like back to the bible back to the bible but i want to move back to the bible roy davis i say back to the bible are you there i remember my first sermon i preached they give brother bran of the pulpit first minister when i'm getting on the pulpit i preach on something and grinding for the enemy when i went over and had my own hand tied to the post but rather begin to preach he had somebody tied in his head and brother by them is preaching some son tied like this roy davis is sitting he's just doing this amen and oh i went through what every emotion that i guess that i thought the preacher could go through but the problem is going then some oh my god it hurt all day this is just room and when i notice old dr davis sitting there with his finger up to his mouth just watching me we're talking about esther being dressed with the garment of praise and with the word and after the service was over i had made my altar call but when i'm finished come those who need jesus a lord of old brothers so he played with the emotions on the pulpit and he caught the women imagine something then the mother oh poor oh dear oh it's so touchy come to the altar the mothers i had my uncle a lot of mother was walking up padding me on the shoulder oh they say billy that was wonderful and dr david said i want to see you in my study and i said yes sir he said that was just about he get there dr david look at him that was just about as ridiculous as i ever heard in my life oh it really took the cell off of me by the bottom was coming every sister said was wonderful whatever i'm saying oh my god roy davis when i get there he put a stamp like this is my boy when he get there they say ridiculous oh he will took the cell off of me so i said well what's the matter dr davis you want to continue he said one time i was a practicing law me davison i went and i heard few cases tried so he went to the court and dr davis was sitting watching her other lawyers are getting their case done i said when i heard the case i watched her instead of roy davis watching what how the case has been presented dr roy davis was took by the emotion of the lawyer how they move how they do this and do this i watched the emotion of the attorneys the attorneys went through i said when i tried my first case after i was sewn to the bench he said i took off my coat dr davis first case just like brother brother took off his coat he remembered the emotions and the judge is sitting watching him and it was a lady i was defending another lady and say i pondered on the desk you need to all hear this they are just watching him i cried hello this lady i walked back and forth and i said i thought i had the case whipped that is all there was to it and said the old judge sat there after a while he wrapped the bench and said george your honor in other words hey hey stop stop how much more of these ridiculous things can you code can they coach them oh i thought i got everybody stared up the judge said stop that foolishness well then i felt that i felt like i was just whipped i walked out to defeat it i went home and said well i study something else i never make a lawyer the first case i'm done said after one somebody knock on the door and who was it the old attorney he came home that's why they put brother brother under roy davis he heard open the door yes sir what does he want again and he come down he said well i was watching you and he said you know discord say the reason i did that i want you to be a real lawyer i know it is in you to be a lawyer but this court does not make its decision upon your mental emotion you had a lot of mental emotion but you had no law in defense are you following me and i think that is very good this is brother branham i said dr davis i thank you he said billy all of your emotions and going on and tying samsung to the post and whipping him and putting his eyes out you didn't get very much scripture men are not served by emotions and no delete a sad story you tell you read the book bring it to the booth read the book bring it to the puppet read the book bring it to the puppet you leave the message people stay with you man says served by the word of god that certainly fixed me up since then i have decided this that god does not judge us upon our emotion or upon our affiliation with the church he judges by death heaven enough shall pass away but man shall never pass away now in the day that we are living and the time that we are living in i think it behooves us to check up with them and see where we are living and the hour we are living in this is where i finish i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with what let me give you a thought here how do you pray we pray in jesus name don't we every prayer is in the name in his name or there is not any answer yet in first john 5 14 word we are told this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to what he hears us and if we know that he heals us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petition that we desire now we ask what is the will of god there is only one way to know his will and that is by what lamentation 337 who is he that's safe and he cometh to pass when the lord commanded in other words if the lord have not commanded it's not going to come to pass there it is if it's not the word you can't have it so we can't ask unless it is in there and we kept it and we can petition or ask until it is in his there it is again jesus the name is the word will you can't separate god in his word that's the reason why when esther approaches the king first she approaches the king with praises but you don't impress god with emotion you impress god by the word when you're going in the presence of god bring him the word like a lawyer don't pray jesus that doesn't impress god when you pray when you enter in the presence of god after thanksgiving begin to give him his word father you say in the word father you say in the word father you say in the word father you say in the word i am asking because this is what you say i am asking because this is what you say i am asking because this is what you say that's how you approach the king let's stand [Applause] amen he's not impressed by emotion that's pentecostalism you get that he's just watching you queen esther what do you want esther didn't get there no she get bolded because when you enter the throne of grace you're coming with what boldness are you there with the word after thanksgiving you put on the word and you begin father i have this issue you spoke in your word nobody will be buried father i have the financial trouble you the one that sent peter to fish and to open the mouth of the fish and to pour money i need money father you did it for that woman over there i needed this i did the reason why the airplane job was not because of the emotion because the woman told god i see a raja i see the shoulder man i am a weird woman i have a child there must be elijah somewhere she brought the word and god switched around and said bring that prophet down impress him by the word impress him by the scripture you need to read your bible and pray every day so you know the promises the promises that are freely given unto us so they are reminded you by the holy spirit like he said in his word ask anything anything means anything let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace we thank you for your love we thank you for your mercy and we thank you for speaking to us this morning father the devil who has played a lot with your children under the name of religion where we do things in religion religiously thinking that we're going to impress you by our emotion father there is one thing that impresses you that is your word lord if it's your word whether the emotion are connected or in agreement with the word or not that's not our problem you spoke in your word that if we repented if we have done something wrong if our life are not where it should be as long as we repented no matter how much memories the devil can bring back no matter how much trouble the devil can bring back we need to understand that we are standing in the world as long as we have done what the words say it doesn't matter how many people knows that it has a mother who saw me getting upset or not it has a mother who saw me falling down as long as i have done what the world said that's what will impress you father may you help this church get into the depths of god which is so simple because you hide yourself and you reveal yourself always in simplicity it is not complicated it is religion when you call adam he already figured out with the fig leaves with his own religion what to bring it unto you you never accepted that father you took a lamb and you clothed them with a name may we leave all our denominational idea our idea of sensation of feelings of whether people like us or not lord but may we rely upon the provided land that was given this day to clothe the bride and that provided lamb they killed them the bloody word was the message of the hour we started as lord father in second chronicles 2020 to believe in your prophet and we shall prosper may you help us stay standard with the word touch your children lord remember each one of them lord we thank you for everything and commit all unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you church we love you [Applause] oh yes [Music] my savior or if ever i love thee my jesus

glory and in [Music] [Music] so bright i'll sing with the glittering crown on my [Music] my jesus tears amen amen all hearts and minds clear this afternoon brother elijah do you mind coming up and dismissing us this afternoon praise the lord let us pray dear heavenly father we thank you we bless your holy name for the word that you have given us today o god we pray that we may have the word in our soul may your spirit dwell within us of god fill each heart that's here oh god may you protect us as we're living here be with us oh god as we head into our homes oh god bless us oh lord protect
