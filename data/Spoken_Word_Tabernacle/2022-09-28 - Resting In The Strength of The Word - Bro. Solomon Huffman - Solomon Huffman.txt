can't hardly wait for these times to get here and I do have a praise report I've been praying for a little far because driving back and forth in the price of gas we could hardly afford it and the price of cars are like a roof and we don't like car payments we just don't like them I mean if we have to pay them we pay them but we don't like them I recommend that you don't get involved in them if you possibly can the Lord provided us a small card exactly what we needed good gas mileage and we paid cash and it wasn't a crazy price and if if I had time I'd tell you all the circumstances but it was just amazing the way it all just worked out very grateful to the Lord I'm so thankful for the word Lord that you've been sharing with us Lord it just illuminates our life it puts a skip in her step a smile on our face Lord to know that you love us enough father that you would come down in this end time and you would fulfill your word Lord and send us teachers and pastors and and apostles and all everything that we need Lord for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry until we all come in the unity of the faith and we're here tonight Lord because we know that faith comes by hearing hearing by the word how can we hear without a preacher and how can he preach except they be sin so we pray that you'll anoint the speaker tonight we pray that you'll anoint our ears that we can hear that our faith can be built up Lord Jesus Oh father and that our relationship to you will become stronger and stronger that our house will will uh will will will what am I thinking that that we will become less and that you'll become more thank you Father and Lord Jesus we just pray father for the for the victims down there of this hurricane coming up the coming up the coast Lord Jesus I I heard a report that there's many even now trapped in their homes and the emergency people can't get to them so Lord we know that you can walk on water you can still walk through the storms there's nothing too difficult for you as long as you're in the boat we're okay so be with these are our our friends down there Lord any that are in the Faith Lord let your angels be about them keep them perfectly and safe Lord for any unspoken request in the building tonight father if there's a burden in our heart Enlighten it if there's a need of healing heal them Lord touch them Father the old father lift up the feeble hands the hang down lord Jesus strengthen the feeble knees Lord oh Lord Jesus we lift up praise to you may it be acceptable to you may it be worthy of the king of kings father and without you we know we're nothing we need now bless the remainder of this service bless the offering the tithes thus those who have and those who have not Lord and bless those who have not so they will have and will be very grateful in Jesus name amen amen amen amen foreign [Music] from the pulpit this song came up um between Michael and I on Sunday that there is a race that we must run and there are victories to be worn so we are asking the Lord to give us power every hour to be true to his word amen [Music] keep me true Lord Jesus Keep Me true keep me true Lord Jesus Keep

[Music] [Music] Jesus my Savior forever [Music] amen [Music] glory to God Amen what a powerful song he plunged me to Victory beneath why only the blood to his Power in the Blood amen there is a strong Power in the Blood amen that's the Clorox of God amen if we really grab the revelation of the blood you will be free from a lot of stuff amen glory to God amen amen amen amen I don't know how they presented the blood to the people but the blood is more powerful than people think you cannot even have Fellowship without the blood no Fellowship you cannot approach god without the blood amen amen but the blood is not just only for Fellowship it does something in your life until you can stand in front of God's spotless like you've never done anything to begin with how can you imagine that only the blood of Jesus Christ can do it amen amen glory to God I know why I'm saying the blood because I got part two of pretense [Laughter] [Music] I move around and he comes I move around and he comes and I keep putting that down and I can just say my goodness it is the blood it is the blood amen amen when you stand here you see me already sweating because the anointing is already amen I need to get out of here quick amen my God Brother David is this the new suffering it looks great with that background it's like we're soaring in eternity amen amen I love the background it looks pretty good amen all righty blessed be the name of the Lord I hope those that have not done the reading that you're catching up on the reading God was merciful to you on Sunday he held me 25 miles an hour so somebody can catch up so remember it's the mercy of God if you have not read go ahead and read it again amen if you read or you read it after you can go back to Revelation 17 Revelation 13 Revelation 12 with the sermon you'll see everything coming up clear there is even more stuff than that that are hidden there amen amen but because it's a compound the the scripture have a compound meaning amen that's why the Bible say the seven heads are seven Kings and the Bible says the seven heads are Seven Hills you see that amen do you know that amen amen it's written in Revelation 17. if you look you would say say the beasts have seven somebody's looking up in your Bible I don't want you to say brother Stephen say I see somebody lost open your Bible please I don't want you to say brother Stephen say amen Oh Glory to God amen amen Hallelujah revelation 17. today verse 9. everything we went through you should be in love with your Bible every car I drive has a Bible every car I drive I purchase bubble I put it there when I stopped somewhere I can just poop and I'm reading my Bible it's the message of the hour that made me love the Bible like that amen amen amen amen first man and here is the mind which has wisdom and we know wisdom comes from the second oil amen only those that have the second oil will have this mind and the wisdom of God Paul told us that it was Christ so the mind I have wisdom it means the mind of Christ amen makes sense because Christ is the wisdom of God so the mind I have wisdom is the mind of Christ let the mind this mind be in you the mind of Christ being you if you have the mind of Christ then you're going to understand the things of God verse 9 he say and here is the mind which has wisdom the seven heads are seven water mountains on which the woman seated the first stand and there are seven what so you see why brother Branham keeps saying every scripture you have a compound meaning so you can take seven mountain and you can change again and take seven Kings but we went with the mountain we never went with the Kings so there is more to it go home and read and read and read the Holy Spirit Will unfold more and more amen amen so if you're behind go ahead and do it because Lord's willing on Sunday we're back on the military airplane okay I don't know how long we're going to stay in this airplane so stay alert amen good to see buddy John back in the family on October 1st which was this Saturday we canceled the family days because of the the rain that we will be having based on what's going on in Florida and remember the scent in Florida so that the Lord will protect them but the same mouths already pray about it but just keep them in mind knowing that somebody up there is probably going through a rough way there amen so on the weekend we can be outside because of the rain amen so that gives you some extra time to spend time in prayer and read and catch up on what you got to catch up amen glory to God tonight brother Solomon Huffman who will be preaching you know brother Solomon I told him back there I say this is your second home church let me put it that way so you're not a visitor people know you we know you go ahead preach like home feel free sister Gabriel is there welcome sister thank you for bringing him here so let's pull on the gift of the Lord and hear from Heaven tonight amen let's give him a clap of him glory to God amen everything will be all right all the shaking going on is just a Deliverance [Music] amen we don't like your life a life of pretense is a hard life to live you gotta work all the time to keep that image up it's not natural but the natural life you just leave it you don't tell a lamb but how to manufacture wool he just walk eat dance jump run and before you know it will keep coming out he doesn't even know how well coming up because he doesn't have anything to do with all but if you're not a lamb whole body every morning you gotta wake up and then you gotta get some glue amen you will have a hairpiece every morning you gotta work on it I didn't want to go that route I know the devil will try to put somebody there no problem with that but I'm just saying that if you don't have it you're gonna suffer all along because you're trying to put up an image you don't want to do that if you do that your Christian life is hard it is heavy it is discouraging it is troublesome and it's always keep you alert upset like what am I doing that is wrong no when the plans you beneath the flood [Music] of that Crimson blood that say amen amen you just leave the way God created you to be amen God knows who you are amen you don't have to put up for nothing it's a lot of work it's a lot of work and a whole lot of work because every morning you gotta remember everything that you already created in your life and say it's like an engine they have to check in every every morning before you crack the engine you got to go to one two three four five six and you put it up because if you miss something you're gonna leak out your true identity to the public why suffering like that what I'm doing at home is what I'm doing outside that's why I brought the brand I'm saying preach on the pulpit the way you talk on the street that's what brother I'm saying you don't get on the pulpit and start you know pretty much you're wasting your time you're wasting your time it's gonna show up one day because if somebody's seeing you on the street they'll be like wait a minute is this the same preacher that is there then you give him confusion but if you talk the way you talk on the street the way you talk to your people everything will be fun they can even recognize you they say who's there that's brother Stephen talking there I can tell it's him up there praise God easy you got part 0 point something amen let's call Brother Solomon [Music] um yes [Music] and Jesus is here [Music] yes Jesus [Music] Jesus [Music] Jesus [Music] and amen you believe he's here and let's give the Lord a hand clap of praise tonight [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I tell you we 've been on church services hundreds and thousands of times but I've never got tired of being in the presence of God almighty amen I'm glad that God has given us a dedicated place that we can come together and we can assemble ourselves together in the presence of God and tell you we're just honored to be in his presence tonight and I mean we just want to invite the Lord by word of prayer tonight uh as we look to the word and maybe if you have a need or anything upon your heart if you'd like to lift your hand to the Lord as we would go to the Lord in prayer and and we're just looking to the Lord amen try a different microphone you love the Lord remember let's just create an atmosphere for the Lord to speak to us tonight and I don't know about you but I want to have a sincere heart before God and I want God to speak to my heart and my life amen and this building is the house of God and this is where God speaks to us this is where God heals us it's where God delivers us that's where God encourages us it's where he refills us with the Holy Ghost amen we just want to dedicate it to the Lord tonight Lord Jesus we're so honored to stand in your presence tonight Lord to realize Lord that we're in the presence of not just another man the Lord to know with all a surety that we're in the presence of the God of this Bible and Lord we're so glad tonight that we're serving a resurrected Lord Jesus we're not here Lord serving a dead God we're not serving a history story Lord we're not serving words on a page but we're serving a God that's alive and that's well and Lord Jesus we just want to invite your presence into this meeting tonight father Lord we're we're such a needy people Lord we have needs in our lives and on our hearts but we have needs in our families we have needs in our spiritual Walk with You Lord there's Believers Lord that are that are mourning loss of loved ones in our home church or we're asking that you would just Grace them Lord and give them Comfort tonight Lord there's Believers in Florida that Suffering From The Storm there Lord we're asking at your grace and mercy would just be with him Lord and keep your children safe Lord and tonight you've given us an opportunity that we could come Behind These doors and Lord in a midweek service Lord we're so glad to know that you're a God that doesn't change and the same God that moves in our Sunday morning services our special meetings the same God that meets us in our prayer closet and meets us in our living room Lord You're the same God tonight and we're just inviting you to meet with us here tonight Lord as the songs of Zion has been sung Lord to welcome your presence Lord now as we come to your word we're asking Lord that you would just take your word and may you anoint it Lord and may you send it forth in the power and demonstration of the spirit of God lord and I pray that your word will find a resting place in our hearts tonight Lord we commit this service to you Lord we give it unto your hands we'll be sure to give you all the glory the honor and the praise it's in the Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ we pray and the church said amen and amen may God bless you if you have your Bibles with you I will invite you to turn in the Book of Luke in the first chapter I mean I'd like to say it's certainly an honor and privilege to be here with you again and we thoroughly enjoyed the last time being here amen and the blessings of God and so we just kind of the honor to be with you here again amen and to see one another and our different friends and loved ones that's here but most of all we're glad to be in his presence and I'm glad to have my wife here with me she's a warrior and a trooper she does a lot of my driving so just pray that God will bless her especially tonight but just a couple of things here that God's laid on our hearts and I found it a good thing to just obey the Lord and so that's what we'll do tonight and here in the Book of Luke in the first chapter we'll begin reading in the 26th verse where we down to the 38th the Bible would read this and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin a spouse to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hell thou that are highly favored the Lord is with thee and blessed art thou among women when she saw him she was troubled at his sayings and casting her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God Amen could you imagine an angel telling you that for thou has found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no wind and then send Mary unto the angel how shall this be amen now this scripture here she's not so much as questioning what the angel is telling her but she's questioning how is this going to happen how is this impossible thing how is this going to take place saying I know not a man the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee and therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called Baron notice this is still the angel continuing on with this message of her for with God nothing shall be impossible amen now this would be the reason that the angel Gabriel would be sent from God unto Mary instead of all the other women and Mary said behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her we ask that God will bless his word as you can be seated and just for a couple minutes of time tonight we don't plan to hold you long being a midweek service amen but I want to speak to you by the help of God tonight on the subject of resting in the strength of the word amen resting in the strength of the word and I found in my life that the word of God it's a word like none other amen God's word it's nothing like the word of a man amen by God's word has power to change lives God's word has power to deliver God's word has power to do the impossible amen God's word has such a creative power behind it amen that whenever God has done anything God has used the strength of his own word amen God has used the power of His word amen you'll find any time God will go to do something God uses his word when he wanted when he wanted to create this Earth what he used he used his word amen when he wanted to create human amen humankind what did he do he used the power of His word amen so we can say tonight amen that God's word it's a powerful word and there's a strength behind that word amen and just to build a little foundation in this tonight by the help of God I I want you to notice as the angel would have a message amen and come to Mary amen now this message was not the message of Gabriel the Angel but this message was a message from God that He gave unto the angel Gabriel and he sent Gabriel down to Mary so in other words we could say this way this was God's message unto Mary amen this was not Gabriel's message but this was God's message as he would come down to Mary now now it's very amazing in this because I want you to notice amen how impossible this word that God gave Mary to amen that God gave Mary to keep in other words we could say that way amen God came unto Mary and said behold or the angel came to Mary rather and said Yemen you're a virgin you're going to conceive and you're going to Bear a sign and you're going to call his name Jesus now I don't know about you but being a virgin amen that seems like a very impossible word amen how is this going to happen seeing I don't know a man amen and this Angel gives Mary such a amen such an impossible word by saying you shall bear a sign amen and yet remain a virgin while you bear the sign Amen to no doubt in the Heart of Mary she's got all of these questions thinking how in the world can this be how is this going to be possible but I want you to notice the word of God God makes his word so impossible for us to be able to do it he makes it so impossible for us to be able to keep it amen and you say what brother son why does God do it that way amen because God wants to keep his word through your life amen God's not looking for you to do it that's why God came to Mary and gave her such an impossible word because he didn't want Mary to manufacture the life he didn't want Mary to put on the life but God said I want to put the life in you amen I'm gonna bring to life you're not going to have to manufacture it you're not going to have to produce but amen the Holy Ghost will overshadow you I'll be the one doing it I'll be the one doing the word Hallelujah amen I want you to notice God was not interested in Mary's ability God was not interested in Mary's strengths God was not interested in marriage amen her physical ability to do anything God bypassed all of her ability because he knew she could not do it Hallelujah I said he knew she could not do it so I said I I don't want your strength Mary I don't want your ability Mary I don't want what you got to offer all I wanted your heart I want your heart Mary I want your surrenderance Mary and she said be it unto me according to your word and I want to tell you tonight God ain't looking for your ability God ain't looking for your strength God ain't looking for what you got to offer amen God wants to keep his word through your life by the power of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah why would God ask me to do something so impossible why would God do that amen the most impossible situation the most impossible thing a human I mean it's so far out impossible amen Behold a virgin shall conceive amen so impossible I mean how could it happen how could it be and this is how God works he makes his word so impossible for a man to do that the only hope we got is to get the Holy Ghost the only holy God is to have the life of God overshadow us and live in our lives Hallelujah I know why would God give us a word and a commandment so perfect and I don't know about you but have you have you ever studied the law amen Leviticus and all the laws throughout the Bible amen that seems like such an impossible thing ain't such an impossible word God was proving all the time you abilities aren't going to get you nowhere your abilities aren't going to save you your abilities are not going to keep you amen can I just preach you for a moment might as well amen God Amen is not dependent on my ability amen God is not dependent on my ability he said what's God dependent on brother he's depending on the strengths he's depending on the strength of his word amen Isaiah the prophet prophesied he said behold a virgin shall conceive amen and that was God's word circling the earth you could not stop that oh God I said you could not stop that word because God said so but amen the Virgin Mary could not help but bear a son whose name amen Amen brother amen her greatest failures couldn't stop it her greatest problems couldn't stop it the church trouble couldn't stop it the family trouble couldn't stop it the critics couldn't stop it amen there was not a power that was able to stop it because God said so God said that a virgin is going to conceive God's hand there's got to be a bride there's gonna be an overcomer there's gonna be a bride this is God's word God said so it's Unstoppable the devil said it ain't gonna happen but God said so the devil said I I'll tell you what I don't know about Mary Mary's Mary's got this problem Mary's got this problem and Mary's got this issue Mary's got this sin but what do the Angels say Mary you're highly favored you're highly favored among all the women was there better women than Mary share their world with some better women than Mary shall they were but God didn't favor all the other women God's favorite Mary I say bastard are you bride God is favored the bride of Christ your favorite among the church World your favorite among the denomination God has favored the bride [Music] he said why did he favor us because he wanted to why did he pay for Mary because he wanted to why did he favor you brother because he wanted to is it because you're better it's not because you're better is it because you're greater it's not because you're greater it's because God predestinated you by far knowledge he knew what you would say being under me according to your word and you're highly favored of God Hallelujah hey man Mary Mary question a little bit the Bible said she was troubled at the salutation that's how you take it's a greeting oh God she was troubled at what the angel told her and when the angel said bless her all out Mary I'm at Hail Mary you're highly favored you're highly favored of God Amen and the scripture said that she was troubled to hear that oh God I began pondering on the I thought why in the world would she be troubled to hear what this Angel messenger had to say I thought you know what it was probably her shamanity she thought me me why am I favored why am I favored why did God pick me why did God choose me the angel said that she was favored that did not matter the circumstances it did not matter what she thought God said your favor I want to tell you I don't care what the world thinks about you I don't care what your neighbor thinks about you if God said you're favored then that means your favor if God said you're blessed then that means you're blessed Hallelujah I'm troubled of this how can he say this about me come on somebody you ever felt that way you ever felt that way come on let's be real for a moment amen how could I mean how could the messenger say this about me why would he why would I be favored why would I be chosen of God listen it's the unmerited grace of almighty God that he would favor us I want to tell you this you don't deserve it you didn't earn it I mean you could not pay it it was God rich and mercy that blessed is church he didn't deserve these blessings you didn't deserve what God has done but God who is rich in Mercy has blessed you [Music] I gotta get a witness tonight how many is blessed how many is last a couple some of you we're all blessed hey man come on participation tonight how many is blessed we are blessed can you just thank God for a moment right now God thank you for blessing me thank you for blessing me I didn't deserve it I didn't think I was worse I don't know why you did it but God we thank you for blessing us we thank you for favoring us there's nothing we can do to earn it and we sure don't deserve it but we worship you and we thank you for your blessings tonight [Music] hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah amen God was not interested in her ability that's why he made the word so impossible to tell her listen I don't need your help I do not need your help some of y'all saying that God needs your help but listen he don't some of y'all think you got something to do in this and that your good works are going to help you it will not amen God don't need your good works God don't need your righteousness I don't need your Purity can I just say this for a moment amen the very best righteousness you got the very best Purity in his Blackness and the sight of God so why don't you grab that thought and throw it out the window when you think you got something to do in this it is the grace of almighty God he does not need your ability I know sometimes we feel that way but God don't need our strengths he don't need no ability can I ask you a question tonight what is it that held you when you got as low as low could get when you got as weak as we could get when you woke up in the morning and you felt the pressure of every devil Out of Hell laying on your chest laying on your mind amen amen you ever been there some days I'll wake up in the morning I mean I'll have all kinds of thoughts hitting my mind I think here's the devil here's my battle and here's what I found if I try to fight that battle brother Stephen and get up and said never love you could never love you I'll lose that battle I'll lose that battle I'll lose it really quick brother mom said you keep rebuking that saying he said all you're doing is hitting the snake with a stick is that the truth he said what do you do when your mind is so full of thoughts and soul full of battles amen I go to the word now rest in the strength of God's word he said what do you do I get on the word and I rest in the strange of God's word because I wanna I'm in God's word I can't fail amen God's word ain't able to fail amen so when you rest in the shrink of the word you're resting amen something that is not able to fail amen something that's not able to lose something that's not able to go defeated I would to God that we would stop resting in our abilities stop resting in our strength but rest in the strength of the word of God [Music] hallelujah amen God is teaching us this amen God's been teaching says for a long time amen and us as humans amen weak roam within ourselves when we see that we can't keep the word we grow within ourselves amen Paul was the same way in the Bible amen Paul had a thorn in his flesh did he not hey buddy that's something that always bothered him always got under his skin amen something that he couldn't get rid of in the South but he always prayed God remembers of thorn God removes his horn God remembers the sword but we don't have any Scripture that said God removed the thorn God was teaching Paul Paul I don't need to remove this horn for you to rest I don't need to remove the thorn for you to rest in my word amen I want to say this God don't gotta remove your son for you to rest in the word God needs you to come to his word and say God I'm tired of fighting the sword I'm tired of fighting the problem I'm tired of fighting to lose a battle but I want to rest in the strength of your word mm-hmm Hallelujah amen the Bible never said that God removed it is that right amen I just want public to say tonight amen I'm thankful for every trial I've ever had I'm thankful for everybody that I've ever had that I could not overcome but I'm fat I just want to thank God for a moment I want to thank God for every mind battle that I could not overcome in my flesh I want to thank God for every trial every situation every problem that I ever had you say why in the world you want to thank God for that because every time I had it it sent me running back to God I said every battle every struggle every problem it made me run to the word it made me run unto my strengths Hallelujah and the devil's saying what in the world I thought Christ made them weaker devil you're wrong you're wrong devil you've been giving us trials thinking it's going to make us weaker but it's making us run to the word and we're drawing streaks we're trying strings off of the word of God Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah [Music] I said I thank God for my trials I thank God for my problems I thank God for my mind battles amen because every time I've had it it sent me back to the word amen and it made me get my strength from the word Hallelujah do you say preacher how are we going to make it how are we gonna amen how are we going to do this thing all right bro we've got this trouble we've got this problem we've got this issue and our young people's got this problem and I shall preach to the young people for a minute is this okay amen I don't care your problems I don't care your issues I don't care your mistakes they will not stop God's word saw me I was thinking they're gonna stop God's word but they won't Sammy I was thinking your issues and your problems are going to stop God's word but they will Notch amen amen no amount of issues are able to stop God's word from coming to pass Hallelujah I said hallelujah amen nothing will stop God's word [Music] glory to God amen we see the issues of our life we see the sticky nature as brother Branham taught us amen you see that man in the mirror and you see those stones on the side amen you see all of those sayings amen and you get like Mary and you think how can this be [Music] have you ever been there how can this be how can this be but the angel wasn't done we'll read it again amen the angel was not done talking amen she said how can this be amen the angel spoke and said with God nothing notice how the angel word of this with God with God he said it's a simple I know it's simple but it's simply the truth that'll help you I know it was God nothing's going to be impossible so whenever the question comes to your mind well Solomon how can this be how is this going to happen maybe we're supposed to be a bride spotless and adorned amen priming to the bridegroom we're supposed to be Overcomers we're supposed to be victorious we're supposed to be all these things and we ever been there how can this be I mean how can this be it's because of God's word that's how amen it's because of God's word that is how it's possible [Music] amen she knew it was completely impossible Amazon speaks on that for a moment and here you hear him he says why no man can keep that law I mean the law was given to Israel because they required it they said give us something to do amen give us some good words give us we want our ability to be mixed in this amen Damon give us some law to keep let us let us have some good works let us let us have something to offer and so God did God gave him all the law amen God said you want something to do I'll give it to you and he made it so impossible amen God made us so impossible and they shut them thought why in the world did we ask God for something to do this is so impossible why do we ask for God something to do I'm so thankful I don't know about you but this guy's thankful I'm thankful amen for the grace of almighty God and because Grace can do what law cannotch even Grace can do what law cannot do Hallelujah amen God does not want our ability God wants our surrenderance amen speaks on that game about human ability and perfect shrink turns 61 it covers it he says well there's one thing we've got to master and I need all ears just for a moment please there is one thing we've got to master if we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life he said we have to master the thought of human ability aim of the human ability and this is why we get so defeated sometimes because when this human ability does not hold up we say well my God I guess I'm not bride I guess I'm not this and I guess I'm not this I'm not are you amazed that human ability fails you are you amazed brother that human ability fails you I'm not amazed in it amen it's rotten it's stinking it's dead it's got no strings in it I'm not amazed that human ability fails me it has always failed and it always will foreign teaches us we must Master the thought of human ability and if we ever get to a spot where we sang that we can do it with our own intelligence and our own abilities he says we've got to master it in such a way to where we get rid of that thing and then lay it aside so God can use us that's right I used to speaking to somebody tonight amen when we can get that human ability and lay it aside and say God I know that it's human ability is not going to get me in I know that this human ability I'm not gonna make it and by the way I'm saying master that thought of laying human ability to the side and then surrender unto God I mean he says why make a complete and total surrender he says we cannot use one ability we got to make a complete surrender and come to God and surrender both soul body and spirit everything we've got has to be surrendered to God in order for amen for him to be able to work his will in you and me I mean how important that is I say God tonight help me master the thought of my own ability help me master the thought of my own strengths help me master I'm at the thought of my knowledge the thought of what I can do and what I can offer I mean God help me master that Hallelujah [Music] I mean we'll get back to Mary here just for a moment I'm mindful of the time y'all pulling you make it a little hard to stay with something Hallelujah I remember I'm speaking on Mary here amen amen coming here and reading the Scrolls he said about Mary she steps back into the house picks up a scroll and then they have their Sunday afternoon Bible study amen that day they brought forth The Scroll of Isaiah amen the reading that Isaiah 9 and 6 where it says unto us a child is giving unto us a son is Born the government shall be upon his shoulders his name Shall be Called counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God Amen I just love how brother the man would say this he said and while he was reading that he heard a sign and he looked sideways and that little sweetheart of his her little face had flashed up her eyes were glittering like the stars of the night and she said read that again dear and he read it again and she's made me she must have said oh I wonder who

the other churches and to all the other ones he said he sent them to you you labored and rest of God Hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord nothing can stop it hallelujah amen nothing can stop it how can this be brother how can this be because God said so amen I want to drive this home in your hearts and because amen I know we're going to face battles this church is going to have battles they're going to have struggles you're going to have problems we all do I know we're going to have all of these things but see no matter all of these things it will not stop God's word it will not stop what God has said amen what do we do when they cry amen when the issues come what do we do we rest in the strength of his word when the problems come what do we do we rest in the strength of his word amen I need you to preach with me just for a moment we'll close and we'll we'll take it to an end here amen tell your neighbor rest in the strength of his word [Music] but rest in the strength of his word Amen to rest and the strength of his word and when I make a mistake what do I do go and rest in the strength of his word when this happens what do I do go rest in the strength of his word what about marriage Trouble When It Happens go rest in the strength of his word amen the the prophet taught us he said what did Jesus do Jesus gave us our example amen could have called Legions of angels out of heaven but he did not what did he use he used the power of the word amen said Satan it is written amen he used the word amen you guys here tonight the same word that you've got it's the same word that Christ used I want to say this the same word he used back then it defeated the devil then and it will defeat the Devil today and tomorrow yes sir amen and we'll defeat him today to feed him tomorrow he said how long will the work keep working God's word is eternal his word is ever more it'll always work Hallelujah praise the Lord how can this be the Holy Ghost will always Shadow you it's the word of God be it unto me according to Thy word amen right up in Judea I remember the realm continues on and speaking about it amen she said you know I'm going to have a baby before she felt anything it's because the word had already been set there so notice before any and before any feeling before any emotion before anything she didn't need any of that the word was spoken amen the word was spoken amen of Virgin shall conceive and as I said there'll be nothing that can stop that word amen that Angel's message the Angel's message that came under her and gave her those words sent from God but nothing could stop it and I want to say this God has sent an angel in the age you and I live in amen and he rung up the words there will be a bride amen there will be a bride ask her the question amen the same God that spoke to Gabriel it's the same God I spoke to William Branham it's the same word it's an Unstoppable word it's an Unstoppable Force I want you to realize something just for a moment the Reason God Amen has put his word behind you is because God is determined to have a bride is that right the Reason God is using the power of His word is because God is determined to have a bride he said what do you mean God's word is Unstoppable amen as the women as the prophecy of Isaiah was spoken Amen in a time and circle the world foreign until it found the vessel that was ordained to that word amen that word got behind Mary amen and it caused her to produce a son it was the word of God item that caused her to produce a little life of Jesus Christ and God has sent the message and the age you and I live in and the creative power is behind the world and the word is behind you [Music] I feel like shouting here for a minute amen you're supposed to I can't do it luckily you can't because God's word is behind you you say oh my God I just I just can't do it you see you cannot stop prophecy is that correct you can't stop prophecy right failures won't stop prophecy issues won't stop prophecy nothing could stop prophecy so when God prophesies our sermon God prophesies there is going to be an overcomer there's gonna be a bride Damon Rapture not allowed to see ya when God prophesies it there is nothing that can stop that from happening Hallelujah I'm going to illustrate just for a moment here's a believer now it's prophesied that this chair is going to make it all the way across the side of this room Solomon Huffman has given a prophecy this chair is going to make it all the way over there foreign ER than this chair I'm a lot greater than this chair compared to me this chair is nothing it's got no strength it's got no ability it's got nothing that can offer it's got no good works it's got no strength in it it's got no life in it so the life of Solomon Huffman Gets behind the chair Hallelujah It Gets behind the chair and the prophecy is fulfilled and God and God is behind the bride brother God's behind the bride [Music] shanas through every battle through every trial through every chest through every problem God's pushing us he said why is he pushing us to all the way back home oh wow Hallelujah why don't you question us to all the way back home can I ask you a question amen whose strength is greater gods are yours whose abilities greater gods are yours God's his amen so the next time you say God can't do it you just remember and Solomon can push a chair that God is surely strong enough aiming to push me God is strong enough to keep me Hallelujah musicians come take that devil take that devil take that devil the devil wants to point out my flaws and your flaws I say devil take this God said this about me Amen brother Branham talked about Mary there he said the devil came to Mary and said all that can't happen that's not gonna happen Mary Amen brother mom said she just shook that away from her and she rested in the word she rested in the strength of the word I stand to our feet so the next time you think you can't the next time you think you can't do it I want you to remember God's power and remember God's word God said you can I'm a lesson your word ain't on the stake your ability is not on the stake this is God's word [Applause] I I want this anger in your heart God does not need your strength to keep his word amen amen amen Sarah in the Bible thought God needed her strengths Sarah said God needed her help I need to help God keep his promise so Sarah said Abraham take Hagar and you have the child but God said that's not what I said I said through Sarah through that womb through thy womb I'm gonna give you a child amen some alignments sometimes we down we say well I'll tell you what this message is for somebody else it ain't for me God said through that womb God says through you I'll tell you why somebody else is going to make the Rapture I don't know about me God says you would amen God said the bridewood amen not another but you will Hallelujah amen God does not need our help keeping his

in heaven amen right alongside glory to God you see that ham were hooked to the m that's the only part that God was looking for in Abraham amen amen you focusing on this four which is the number of the Earth and this is God in human flesh right God in human flesh you're focusing about these four this is what you see all the time amen he's not looking at that he's looking at number 13. and he's a

Ephesians chapter 2 glory to God Amen if you dare you can say Amen if you see what this message unfold you will just quit fighting [Music] you won't have to scream too much the devil will know who that is amen amen oh God abrahamic miracle was impossible too why did God made it impossible and they call Abraham the father of our faith those faithful things that are impossible amen amen verse 4 but God who is rich in Mercy for his great water where if he water did he love you now or that loved was already in the past so God already loved you it's not today because you got saved that God love you he already loved you amen verse 5 even when we were dead in sin Paul is very specific so God loves you when you were dancing in a nightclub do you understand what I'm saying amen that's why Paul say I am what I am amen because God sees the mess that you're gonna do but his love is not the way you think you love somebody when they do good God's love is elective that's what God love is I love Jacob I hated was Jacob born no no was he so born why do you hate to eat so when he's not born the Bible said he have not even done something good or bad because what God was looking was the letter m when he just look at Esau there is nothing he opened he saw nothing he opened Jacob led to him he said I love Jacob and we expect if God love you if Jacob is born he's going to be the most beautiful humble obedience child you ever seen because God loved him before he was born as a matter of fact when they are born the one God didn't love the one God hated was the good one I'm speaking to predestined this evening now you mature way enough to understand this language and the one that God loved was the messy one amen amen let me continue even when we were dead in sin has he quickened us together with who so your quickening was not done in you first do you understand what I'm saying if you're tired I stop and we go home everybody care amen this is Christ this is Christ he says you right here everybody okay amen amen instead of God coming and working on you God doesn't work in you you want to give me a few minutes amen you can be seated God doesn't work in you amen amen amen God is working in Christ you follow me God doesn't come and Quicken you here he comes to Christ and inside of Christ he quickened you here anybody okay amen amen so your punishment is done here amen do you follow me your whooping is done here amen anybody here all your sin that you've done he put it here that's what sent Jesus to hell so if somebody already went to hell for you do you think you want to go to hell no do you qualify for her if they take you to the hell Embassy they won't give you a Visa [Music] I'm saying that so you understand you will never qualify even if you say I'm Gonna Leave This message you trying to go something will pull you back and you see somebody else living but you cannot go because you don't qualify for hell everybody okay so when God Quicken you here you are dead amen God doesn't come here to Quicken you he goes to Jesus Christ he quickens you in Jesus Christ that's why Jesus say it is amen he finished the work let me help you again so you get it did you ever seen Boaz redeeming Ruth whose Boaz redeeming roof when he went to the Elder he was speaking to the Elder that I came here to redeem roof he was redeeming who was he really looking for Naomi was the Boaz interested to marry Naomi what was he hiding in Naomi [Music] so when he's talking Naomi he was thinking he's talking about now oh yes they are Keen folks they are family member so he want to get whatever Mary I mean he want to get uh Naomi that's what you think the speech of Boaz speak of Naomi the work he's doing looks now on me everything he's discussing is about Naomi but behind Naomi today amen when Naomi passed when Naomi passed it was a package when they passed when they scare Naomi people Naomi pass whatever was inside there was qualified when the package of Naomi pass he opened the package he pulled roof and he left Naomi alone amen do you understand what I'm saying do you understand what I'm saying so God put everything that belonged to you in Jesus Christ and he had to either approve the offering of Jesus Christ or reject the offering of Jesus Christ do you know that because when Jesus resurrected Mary want to touch him he said no no no no no no no you cannot touch me now because my offering need to be approved but that often have me and you so when God made when Jesus went to heaven they look at the offering they say approved then Jesus came back to the disciple he said now you can touch me [Music] there is in me is approved amen what does that have to do with you what does that have to do with what you've done [Music] buddy I have a weapon that can pick up complex and break it down who told you because Moses killed somebody he's not going to be a messenger no I'm asking you there is a lot of stuff coming up right now I'm gonna cut it off so we can go home who told you because Moses killed somebody he cannot be a messenger who told you that do you know that God was begging Moses am I reading a different Bible do you know that God was begging Moses he was even bargaining Moses let me help you up God was bidding Moses he said Moses I put this because he said no no no I don't qualify he said no no you gotta go no no no no no I don't quite do you know how many times God begged Gideon hey man do you know how many times you don't say I'm not gonna go there before I go you do this God goes and do it don't come back again do another one do you read the same Bible I read it I can show you my version of the Bible anybody okay and he don't come again and say he do this and God said go to the and then he here again they say God why why that Bergen because God have nobody else amen amen amen amen amen if you don't do the job he's gonna fail amen do you understand what I'm saying because he already booked you with admission he said Mission a it's gonna be sister daddy now Mission a is coming it's already predestinated for sisters if sister said he don't go Mission AFL then God fell what is God gonna do to Sisters chase her where she is why because Mission a must be fulfilled that's why when you do bad stuff it's not yummy he makes a video predestinate the seed when they do things wrong they go back they get sorrow it's God who does it because you would like evil mm-hmm why were you drinking and and then after drunk you wake up and everything and you begin to feel sorry for yourself and and your friend is like we're gonna go next Saturday again do you amen what do you want me to explain you why is one of the fifth understanding Jesus Christ and the other fifth doesn't understand Jesus Christ both of them did the same thing why was the other one saying no no no we did bad stuff these men didn't do anything wrong and the other one was doing the same thing the Pharisees done to Jesus Christ yet both of both three are dying but one before he goes something else kicking when Jesus stopped he said this language look familiar where did you come from he look inside he said oh God gracious I was about just about to lose you but I will lose none can I continue accept the Son of Perdition with his child here so that the scripture might be what did I help somebody did I help somebody let's continue verse 5. even when we were dead in sins has quickened us together with hope so when they were quickening Jesus Christ before you were even born they were doing your work amen amen by water are you safe because you didn't do anything they were beating somebody else you were just sitting there in Jesus Christ sleeping enjoying why Jesus is is crying my father my father amen verse 6 and has raised as what together and made us sit together in water in who are you going to make yourself sit there you have a ticket buddy it was purchased verse 7 why did Jesus do this that in the ages to come he may what the exceeding water of his water and his who toward who through home he will begin to explain verse 8 for by are you through water and that not of yourself it is the water what do you have to do verse 9 note of what less any man should water the last one verse 10 for we are his water I hope you're getting that Kama created in who and to water stop they created you for what you have a software for good work [Music] amen why do you want to buy another software [Music] amen we were created for good words which God has before done what or then die we should water so who ordained the things that you're doing today that's why Christian life is not painful you can go through trial but it's not painful because you would take the heat of the child in the oven but you don't get burned when people look at you they say really you're going through everything like this but you don't even look like somebody who's going through problems are you sure all of this are happening to you yes they're all happening to you why are you so happy because normally if you go through the normal trial it should we should see the expression in your face see you sad coming to church tired so everybody can tell something is going on in that family or her husband was mad about her oh his wife doesn't love him anymore or whatever but despite everything that happened to you you must tell somebody the story for somebody to begin to see the trial what gives you that strength how did you learn learn to do it how did you learn how to do it I'm going to give you one scripture and we finish Hebrew chapter one and just giving you a summary so you get it you there Hebrew chapter 1 verse 3 if you dare we read then we're done you there who Jesus Christ being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his water in other words Jesus Is God they express image of his person and upholding or sustaining or supporting upholding all things not certain things All Things by what the word of water God uphold everything by the work of Israel by the by the word of his power that's what you heard tonight everything is sustained by the word of his power Ascend my word to heal them that word will never return void to God it will accomplish that which it has been sent everything God is sustaining that by the word it is written it is written it is written it is as long as it came out from the lips of God that's it that said amen amen amen so if God said there will be a bread why do you worry listen to the messenger he Vindicated the messenger and the Bible says if the prophet says something it happened he'll hear him that's it he Vindicated the messenger we're just listening to the instruction go left I go left go right I'll go right I don't have to worry about it because I know I am assured that I'm working toward the destination amen pressure is coming up things are going to get tight but if you rest on his word there is a man that can take the pressure off amen amen that's the place you can let off the pressure amen no matter how hard he gets her difficulty get just know you were prepared for this don't be afraid of laodicea before they make laodisha they look at you first amen everybody okay before God put laodisha he looked at the Mount of devil he looked her head will come on Earth he look at women walking naked he look at everything then God came to you and he begin to make you become in in position based on what he's looking at he said the temperature is 100 put them in 200. amen amen so when they were sending you this word he looked he said Paul not in age or polite that no no no no no no no not that area no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no which one laudisha yeah that's where she needs to go do over there yes don't worry she already have something that can take care of the temperature go there amen how can a woman wear a dress for a whole year in what we see here what makes you wear a dress you think it's you you think it's you go tell a woman that you cannot walk with a parent she will look at you like you crazy but you're doing that and you even enjoy it amen it becomes like a nature what makes you think different because you are 200. amen is 100. so the F the the the influence of laodicea doesn't even do anything that's why you walk the way you walk that's why you're a Christian the way you condition because you are built for this age amen and not only for this age we are built to make it home let's stand glory to God Amen amen so do not get discouraged always encourage yourself in the word because heaven and earth will pass away but his word would never pass away you didn't start this the one who started is the author he's what the author so who started him who finished where are you in the picture he is the author and he's also the where are
