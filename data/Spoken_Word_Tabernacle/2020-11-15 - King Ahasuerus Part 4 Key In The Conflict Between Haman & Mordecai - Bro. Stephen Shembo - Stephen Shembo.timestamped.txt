[33:04] bless you
[33:06] amen
[33:11] we mentioned something last week
[33:13] [Music]
[33:15] and i say i don't want anybody to be
[33:19] to feel like they are left out
[33:22] amen
[33:24] and i say that if you left up it's your
[33:26] fault
[33:28] what truly we want to mean is
[33:30] we don't want anybody being neglected
[33:34] amen
[33:35] sometime we pick what is going on with
[33:38] you
[33:38] sometime we can
[33:40] so if something is going on you need any
[33:42] help
[33:43] anything
[33:44] don't hesitate to reach out to me to
[33:46] reach out to the deacon and to everybody
[33:49] it's going to hurt me if i know that
[33:51] someone is in the hospital and we were
[33:53] not aware of
[33:55] it's going to hurt me if i know that you
[33:58] didn't have any money to
[34:01] buy gas to come to the church and you
[34:03] didn't even reach out to your brother
[34:06] not only the pastor to your brother and
[34:08] your sister to express like hey i'm
[34:10] going through something in other words
[34:12] let's be open
[34:13] as a family let's talk as a family
[34:16] making sure we back one another app
[34:19] amen
[34:21] and the second thing
[34:23] i have to mention this because we
[34:26] might we need to be considerate
[34:29] sometimes the service on sunday are
[34:31] longer
[34:32] than the service
[34:34] on wednesday not even sometime the
[34:37] majority of the time
[34:38] amen
[34:40] we don't have sunday service sunday
[34:42] school
[34:44] we don't have sunday night service
[34:46] amen
[34:48] if we have sunday school we have sunday
[34:50] night it's going to be a different story
[34:52] we only have two services
[34:54] because of the hotel here
[34:57] other churches are already having sunday
[34:59] morning sunday night but it's difficult
[35:01] for us with what we pay in the hotel to
[35:04] come back here sunday night again that's
[35:06] going to be a lot on us but we only have
[35:09] one service on sunday no sunday school
[35:12] no sunday night so if please
[35:16] we can make a little sacrifice
[35:18] and let's make sure we are grounded in
[35:22] the world
[35:23] the hour is late
[35:27] the president is shooting for a shutdown
[35:31] if they shut down
[35:33] you won't even have to worry about being
[35:34] here
[35:36] you're going to be at home probably you
[35:38] have to listen to your own tape
[35:40] amen
[35:41] so while the hour is here something is
[35:44] burning
[35:45] yearning within me
[35:47] to do the best that i can
[35:49] to redeem the time it's on one service
[35:53] you can please bear with us
[35:56] making sure
[35:57] we're going to be mindful but we don't
[35:59] want to
[36:00] do 30 minutes and we go home you need to
[36:03] be grounded
[36:05] we came out from something that was big
[36:08] we thought everybody was in a message
[36:10] we thought all the young people were in
[36:12] the message
[36:13] and come to find out
[36:16] there were people that were not even in
[36:19] the message
[36:20] they have people that i have even a lot
[36:22] of questions didn't even were not even
[36:25] grounded in the scripture
[36:27] somebody can take the scripture and
[36:28] twist it just a little bit and they are
[36:31] lost
[36:32] can't even think
[36:33] so that really hurt me
[36:36] that's why i say young people you got
[36:38] cell phone get yourself unhooked
[36:40] make sure when we send the reading you
[36:42] are reading those
[36:44] those verses those message thing because
[36:47] we don't want to go through what we went
[36:49] again
[36:50] we don't want anybody lagging behind
[36:53] amen we don't want to pretend like we
[36:55] know the message and we found out we
[36:58] don't even know
[36:59] and no matter how much scripture you're
[37:01] giving somebody doesn't want to
[37:02] understand
[37:04] i don't want to play game again it's a
[37:07] bada war
[37:08] it's a battleground we are in the war
[37:12] amen
[37:13] so if we go a little bit up
[37:15] i'm just trying to redeem the time
[37:18] we only have one service amen
[37:21] we don't have sunday school we don't
[37:22] have sunday night we want to be
[37:23] considerate i just don't want to be like
[37:26] i'm not paying attention to your time
[37:29] it's just
[37:30] something is burning
[37:32] let's be grounded in the word amen
[37:36] because we don't know which wave is
[37:38] coming up again
[37:40] it might come up again within our own
[37:42] frame
[37:43] in a message what are you going to do
[37:46] are you going to try to figure it out
[37:47] again where the brother branham is
[37:49] malachi 4 or not that's a problem
[37:52] amen
[37:54] we're going to bring it in the word
[37:56] until you sit down you say this message
[37:59] is nothing but the truth amen and god
[38:02] might hello allow another wind to come
[38:04] back again to check if you are grounded
[38:09] amen
[38:10] so
[38:11] take this time
[38:12] we don't know what biden is coming with
[38:14] amen
[38:16] praise the name of the lord exodus
[38:17] chapter 17
[38:20] love you church we don't want to
[38:23] overburden you but
[38:25] i have a responsibility before god
[38:29] and i must make sure i do what is
[38:32] necessary
[38:34] amen
[38:37] exodus chapter 17 verse 18.

[39:25] something happened with pharaoh and by
[39:27] the grace of god god delivered them they
[39:30] came out crossed the red sea the enemy
[39:32] was destroyed
[39:34] and it seems like everything was fine
[39:37] they were they are heading straight on
[39:39] the highway toward the promised land the
[39:42] first nation
[39:45] the first enemy
[39:47] that attacked israel after
[39:51] the battle after the victory over
[39:53] pharaoh
[39:54] the first nation the first enemy that
[39:58] attacked israel after leaving egypt
[40:01] his name is amalek
[40:08] where are you going with amalek
[40:13] amen
[40:14] tomorrow i will stand on the top of the
[40:17] hill
[40:19] with the road of god
[40:21] i thought it was the road of moses
[40:24] with the road of god in my hand
[40:27] so to fight amalek
[40:32] the battle is with amalek
[40:35] to fight
[40:36] amalek moses must first climb into the
[40:40] hill
[40:43] amen
[40:44] you don't fight tama like any kind of
[40:46] ways
[40:49] verse 10
[40:51] hallelujah
[40:52] so joshua yeah it's coming it's coming
[40:55] amen
[40:57] so joshua did as moses have said to him
[41:01] notice moses never thought the bible
[41:04] because moses is the type of christ
[41:07] amen
[41:08] the one who engaged in nevada is joshua
[41:11] this is the first time joshua is
[41:13] appearing on the scene
[41:16] and joshua
[41:18] did as moses had said
[41:21] to him and fought with amalek
[41:24] and moses aaron
[41:26] and er
[41:27] went up to the top of the hill so to the
[41:30] top of this hill we have moses there
[41:34] we have aaron
[41:36] [Music]
[41:37] which is delivered
[41:40] amen
[41:41] which represented the levitical
[41:44] priesthood
[41:46] you already know that
[41:48] and we have somebody there called er
[41:51] yes
[41:52] a stranger
[41:54] amen
[41:55] [Music]
[41:57] and he came to pass verse 11 when moses
[42:00] held up his hand
[42:02] so when moses climbed on the top of the
[42:05] hill he was not standing like this
[42:07] he had to put his hand like that
[42:12] with the road of god
[42:14] and brother branham told us that that
[42:16] road was the judgment road
[42:20] so moses went on top of the hill with a
[42:23] judgment stick
[42:27] amen
[42:28] it's coming hallelujah
[42:30] and it came to pass when moses held up
[42:32] his hand
[42:34] that israel prevailed
[42:37] and when he let down his hand
[42:40] amalek prevailed
[42:42] so amalek is not a game
[42:45] amen
[42:46] it depends on what moses is doing
[42:49] amen
[42:50] if moses dropped his hand amalek is
[42:53] wiping you
[42:55] amen
[42:56] so we must make sure the hand of moses
[42:58] are up
[42:59] for you to overcome amalek
[43:04] what is stephen we're talking about este
[43:07] what is wrong with amalek
[43:10] amen
[43:13] verse
[43:14] 12 but moses hand were heavy he got
[43:17] tired
[43:18] and they took a stone and put it under
[43:21] him
[43:22] and he sat there on and aaron and earth
[43:25] stay up his hand
[43:27] so when moses hand got heavy
[43:30] aaron stood and
[43:32] hold one hand and er on the other side
[43:36] we will find we will find out who's here
[43:38] amen
[43:40] throne and aaron and earth stayed up his
[43:43] hand the one on the one side and the
[43:45] other on the other side
[43:47] and his hand were steady until the going
[43:51] down of the sun
[43:53] so air
[43:55] and
[43:57] aaron
[43:58] help the hand of moses to stay up like
[44:01] this
[44:02] amen
[44:04] it seems like the nail of the hand of
[44:06] moses came from aaron and earth
[44:10] come on
[44:15] it's jumping
[44:17] what is the name of the lord
[44:19] verse 13
[44:20] and joshua disconfited amalek
[44:23] and his people with the age of the sword
[44:26] the word
[44:28] 14 and the lord said to moses
[44:31] write this for a memorial
[44:34] there was something about this battle
[44:37] that god said listen
[44:39] joshua fought this battle
[44:41] i want you to make sure you put this
[44:45] this battle into the law
[44:49] are you there when you are writing the
[44:51] law
[44:52] make sure joshua's story with amalek is
[44:56] written in the law
[45:00] as a memorial
[45:02] i want all israel as the time progress
[45:06] to refer to this battle as a memorial
[45:12] amen
[45:14] write this for a memorial in a book
[45:17] and he hears it in the ears of who
[45:21] he was showing you that joshua already
[45:23] will replace moses
[45:25] right there
[45:26] in the ear of joshua
[45:29] just like esther was put in the best
[45:31] place
[45:32] already showing you she was the queen
[45:35] for i will orderly put out the
[45:38] remembrance of amalek from under heaven
[45:42] so there is something that amalek did to
[45:45] israel
[45:46] that when god look
[45:49] god say put that in the book
[45:51] i will make sure i wipe completely the
[45:55] seed of amalek
[45:57] from undead
[45:58] earth what is inaudible
[46:01] that god hated them so much
[46:04] until god want to make sure no amaleka
[46:07] to remain on earth
[46:11] verse 15
[46:12] and moses built an altar
[46:15] and called the name jehovah
[46:18] so jehovah nisi speak about amalek
[46:24] among the seven redemptive name of
[46:28] jehovah
[46:29] one of that name contains amalek
[46:37] verse 16
[46:38] for he said
[46:40] because the lord has sown
[46:43] that the lord
[46:45] not moses
[46:47] not joshua
[46:49] not israel
[46:51] but god
[46:53] the lord
[46:55] will have woe
[46:59] when you look at this world it looks
[47:01] like it's joshua fighting
[47:04] amen
[47:05] against amalek
[47:07] but god is saying that this is not the
[47:10] battle of joshua
[47:12] this is not the battle of moses
[47:15] this is not the battle of israel
[47:18] this is my battle
[47:20] meet the lord
[47:22] the battle is not yours
[47:25] the battle is the lord
[47:28] [Music]
[47:29] amen
[47:31] god is engaged in the battle
[47:34] like david said on wednesday i'm coming
[47:38] in the name of the lord
[47:40] actually it is not david it is god
[47:44] amen
[47:45] because when david threw the stone
[47:48] the jehovah pick up the stone and make
[47:52] sure he drove the stone into the line
[47:57] [Music]
[47:58] put your car in neutral
[48:01] amendment
[48:03] because the lord has sown that the lord
[48:07] not moses
[48:08] will have war with who
[48:12] so this war on generation is gonna be a
[48:16] war between amalek
[48:18] and god
[48:22] amen
[48:25] from what
[48:27] generation to
[48:30] show perpetually
[48:33] generation after generation god will war
[48:37] with amalek
[48:39] until he makes sure amalek is completely
[48:44] wiped out
[48:46] let's go to roman chapter 15
[48:51] i gave you exodus 17 on the reading
[48:54] so you should be good

[54:33] amen
[54:34] god richly bless you we are continuing
[54:38] with
[54:39] the king king ahazaris
[54:41] three fists and esther to banquet
[54:44] we spoke about the first feast everybody
[54:47] should know what it is
[54:48] we spoke about the second feast and we
[54:51] finished it up last sunday and we keep
[54:54] we picked up the
[54:56] for uh the third one
[54:58] someone asked me a question this week
[55:00] and i felt led
[55:02] by the holy spirit that i need to stress
[55:05] into something it seems like somebody
[55:07] missed something
[55:09] before we get into that question brother
[55:12] branham say in the hand writing on the
[55:14] wall
[55:15] he says any bible reader here
[55:18] knows that all scripture
[55:20] has a compound meaning
[55:23] every prophecy so not only a scripture
[55:26] but a prophecy
[55:28] some most all of it
[55:30] has a duo
[55:32] a time there or two times or more that
[55:35] it will be answered as a revolving of
[55:38] history in other words history repeat
[55:42] itself
[55:43] what happened in the time of queen
[55:45] vashta happened again today
[55:48] over there they sent seven chamberlain
[55:51] on this time they sent seven angels amen
[55:54] there was a memo there there is a
[55:56] brother branham here history is
[55:59] repeating itself because the old
[56:02] testament is a shadow of the new
[56:04] testament amen
[56:07] history always
[56:09] repeat itself
[56:11] and scripture has a compound meaning to
[56:13] it and a compound revelation everybody
[56:17] clear
[56:18] last sunday when we finished it up with
[56:21] the second feast of king ahazaris we
[56:24] ended up with esther
[56:26] in the house or the custody of hedging
[56:30] and we found out that if you miss the
[56:32] custody of hege which was the top of the
[56:35] holy spirit you're going to go into the
[56:37] tribulation period under the custody of
[56:41] chess gas everybody clear
[56:43] now up here a revelation unfolded of the
[56:47] book of life
[56:48] but before we get into that and stress
[56:51] that a little bit and enter into our
[56:53] subject this morning i want to recall
[56:57] that esther brother david asked me this
[56:59] question and i felt that it's the lord
[57:02] esther first of all was an orphan
[57:06] she was separated from her mother
[57:09] and she also was separated from her
[57:12] father
[57:13] and we know that when we come in this
[57:15] world god uses mom and dad in order to
[57:19] bring you forth in this world
[57:21] so mom and dad represented your natural
[57:23] birth
[57:25] amen but even though you are born from
[57:27] mom and dad no matter how christian they
[57:30] are brother branham explained to us that
[57:32] we are all born in sin
[57:36] shape in iniquity
[57:38] coming into the word speaking lies
[57:41] that's why our children in the message
[57:44] must be born again
[57:46] even though daddy have the holy spirit
[57:49] even though
[57:49] [Music]
[57:52] mama have family believe the message but
[57:54] they must have their own personal
[57:57] experience with jesus christ
[57:59] and jesus when he met nicodemus he told
[58:02] nicodemus you must be born again
[58:06] and nicodemus said wait a minute should
[58:08] i go back again to the womb of my mother
[58:11] or in the womb or oh in the womb of man
[58:14] for nine months again to be reborn jesus
[58:17] said that's not what i'm talking about
[58:19] what i'm talking about is the new birth
[58:22] your father and your mother that birth
[58:25] you that birth was a mess and you must
[58:28] be separated from that birth
[58:31] and be reborn again
[58:33] that's why her father and mother must be
[58:36] separated from her
[58:38] she must be first separated from that
[58:41] first influence
[58:44] that came from her family
[58:46] in the power of transformation brother
[58:48] barnum says sometime
[58:50] you have to separate from everything
[58:53] that is dear on earth
[58:56] her mother was dear to her
[58:58] her father was dear to her but she must
[59:01] separate it from them
[59:02] amen to you to take your position that
[59:07] god has called you to
[59:09] she had to be separated from mom and dad
[59:12] and be transferred under the custody of
[59:15] mordecai which is brother barnum
[59:20] you must be separated from the custody
[59:24] of your natural breath
[59:26] and come under the influence of the
[59:29] messenger of your time because to that
[59:33] messenger was given the message for your
[59:36] day
[59:37] amen
[59:39] sometime
[59:41] the very dearest person on earth
[59:43] you have to shake hand with them and
[59:46] take your position with christ to where
[59:48] god has called you
[59:50] but what is god doing
[59:53] why did he allow mom to die
[59:55] why did he allow papa to die
[59:58] he's transforming you to what she was
[1:00:02] maybe a daughter or a son
[1:00:05] or whatever it is from a lovely family
[1:00:08] sometime like esther
[1:00:10] but they have to take her away from that
[1:00:13] family
[1:00:14] amen like joseph god had a purpose for
[1:00:18] joseph
[1:00:19] joseph was loved by his father but god
[1:00:22] must cause something to happen and to
[1:00:25] remove joseph from that comfort zone
[1:00:28] because god have a purpose for joseph
[1:00:32] amen
[1:00:33] from a lovely family sometime
[1:00:36] he blesses you somewhere else
[1:00:38] because it's the way it's his way of
[1:00:41] doing it by the renewing of your
[1:00:45] to obey the word of god regardless of
[1:00:49] what the price is
[1:00:51] rebecca have to be separated from mom
[1:00:54] and dad to go to a husband that she
[1:00:58] never even saw
[1:01:00] amen mom and dad want to keep praying
[1:01:02] for 10 days but rebecca said no don't
[1:01:06] keep me here i must go i must go to a
[1:01:09] man that i never seen
[1:01:11] a man she had to be separated from her
[1:01:14] family
[1:01:15] esther have to be separated from her
[1:01:17] parent
[1:01:18] sometimes
[1:01:20] god lets the very props
[1:01:23] be knocked from andreas
[1:01:26] the people you are leaning upon
[1:01:29] the people you have like a backup
[1:01:32] the people that have your influence more
[1:01:36] than the word of god that preacher that
[1:01:38] pastor that you love above the word of
[1:01:41] god god sometimes removes those crutches
[1:01:45] because he wants you to be somewhere
[1:01:49] amen
[1:01:50] sometimes god let the very prop be
[1:01:54] knocked from under us
[1:01:55] sometimes he let sickness struck us
[1:01:59] he let disappointment heard the
[1:02:01] extractors
[1:02:03] sometimes he does that
[1:02:05] to get you where you will be influenced
[1:02:08] by the
[1:02:10] people i have to catch it
[1:02:14] don't be stupid enough to walk away from
[1:02:17] it
[1:02:18] amen i didn't use that word stupid it's
[1:02:22] a pro word but random music
[1:02:25] amen
[1:02:26] be wise enough
[1:02:28] and understand what god is trying to
[1:02:30] achieve in your life
[1:02:32] why did god bring that chaos
[1:02:35] because you have that chaos as your
[1:02:38] crutches
[1:02:39] and god knock off the crutches so you
[1:02:42] might lean upon himself
[1:02:44] amen
[1:02:46] so from the house
[1:02:48] of the of the custody of a guy
[1:02:51] we found out that there was a house
[1:02:53] called the house of women
[1:02:55] and there was a mystery to the house
[1:02:58] because that house was divided in two
[1:03:00] parts
[1:03:01] one part was the best part
[1:03:03] and the other
[1:03:05] part was the regular part
[1:03:07] and we found out that esther was placed
[1:03:10] on the best part
[1:03:11] and every other virgin even though they
[1:03:15] were virgins they were placed on the
[1:03:18] regular party
[1:03:19] and that when that part or the house of
[1:03:22] the woman was based upon a record
[1:03:26] when you come
[1:03:27] your name have to be written when you
[1:03:30] come your name have to be written but
[1:03:32] your name is written according to your
[1:03:35] compartment whether you are in room 20
[1:03:38] room 245
[1:03:40] room number 20
[1:03:42] 5 room number 38 but there was one room
[1:03:46] amen that was a special room
[1:03:49] and that room was given to esther that's
[1:03:51] where we unfolded the book of life
[1:03:55] and i gave you the reading because the
[1:03:57] book of life contained name
[1:04:00] amen
[1:04:01] and based on the category you are in
[1:04:05] it's gonna orient your life
[1:04:08] amen
[1:04:09] the life that you are living right now
[1:04:12] is all connected under the mystery of
[1:04:16] your neighbor
[1:04:17] i will unfold that mystery not unfold
[1:04:20] but repeat brother branham under that
[1:04:23] mystery later on amen
[1:04:25] and we found that that section that was
[1:04:28] the best part was the lamb's book of
[1:04:32] life
[1:04:33] amen
[1:04:34] thus he gave us four category of people
[1:04:38] amen the first category
[1:04:41] was a bread which is the lamb that
[1:04:44] sheared herself
[1:04:46] amen
[1:04:47] and being that the la uh the bread goes
[1:04:51] into the presence of the king as a bride
[1:04:53] she's gonna be picked
[1:04:55] and because the bride is picked she will
[1:04:59] never go into the house of shaskas
[1:05:02] that's why brother branham keeps saying
[1:05:05] and the scripture said that the bride
[1:05:07] will not go into the tribulation period
[1:05:12] you are picked and you go into the house
[1:05:15] of the king
[1:05:16] amen
[1:05:17] and when esther was picked we found out
[1:05:20] that a feast was organized
[1:05:22] which was the third fist of king a
[1:05:25] hazaris i'm just stressing this for
[1:05:27] somebody who missed it
[1:05:29] amen and that feast was called esther's
[1:05:32] fist because it's all about the bread
[1:05:36] which was speaking about the marriage
[1:05:38] supper of the bread amen after that
[1:05:42] virgin were called again which we saw
[1:05:45] was the jews the 144 000 amen the second
[1:05:50] category was the foolish virgin
[1:05:54] the foolish virgin will go into the
[1:05:56] tribulation period
[1:05:58] but they're gonna be saved
[1:06:00] they're gonna be safe they're gonna be
[1:06:01] caught man
[1:06:03] going to be called by name
[1:06:05] because the king delighted on them but
[1:06:09] they're not going to be the bride
[1:06:12] the third part was the mix multitude
[1:06:15] that their name was on the record
[1:06:18] so now when we say that the name
[1:06:22] is the ways on the book of life
[1:06:24] it doesn't mean that they take
[1:06:26] uh
[1:06:27] an eraser and they erase it
[1:06:30] the name being erased in the book of
[1:06:32] life means that your name is gonna be
[1:06:35] spoken
[1:06:36] in the history of christianity
[1:06:40] but there will come a time
[1:06:42] when it's time to save the people
[1:06:44] you're going to be missing there
[1:06:47] amen there is a record of the history of
[1:06:52] christianity
[1:06:53] and there is a record of the saved
[1:06:56] people
[1:06:57] your name can be here
[1:07:00] but if your name is not here that's a
[1:07:03] problem
[1:07:04] so the foolish virgin their name are
[1:07:07] here and they are there
[1:07:09] the name of the bread is here and they
[1:07:12] are there but the name of the mixed
[1:07:14] marketed is right here
[1:07:16] like judah
[1:07:18] but when you check the book of life
[1:07:21] where it's speaking about who's going to
[1:07:23] be saved
[1:07:24] judah is missing
[1:07:26] amen because before pentecost judah
[1:07:29] killed himself
[1:07:30] he never could make it to pentecost
[1:07:33] because pentecost gives them eternal
[1:07:36] life
[1:07:36] and eternal life was given to them that
[1:07:39] was ordained before the foundation of
[1:07:43] the world to be saved
[1:07:46] does that have the love of the truth
[1:07:50] amen
[1:07:51] if you die you are not there it means
[1:07:53] your name was in the book but your name
[1:07:57] was erased
[1:08:00] everybody clear
[1:08:02] so those will go into the hearts of
[1:08:06] chess guys and never to be called by the
[1:08:08] king
[1:08:09] the story is finished they remain
[1:08:11] conquer man forever
[1:08:13] and there was another group that we saw
[1:08:16] that was never even selected
[1:08:19] their name was not even written in the
[1:08:22] book of life
[1:08:24] that's why the bible says all those that
[1:08:27] will worship the beast
[1:08:29] because under the history of
[1:08:31] christianity they have nothing to do
[1:08:34] with religion
[1:08:36] that's why i gave an example you will
[1:08:38] see somebody
[1:08:40] born
[1:08:41] initiated into voodoo
[1:08:44] or initiated into free medicine or
[1:08:47] whatever and they get more deeper into
[1:08:50] it and they become magician and they die
[1:08:53] magician
[1:08:54] they've never been in a church
[1:08:56] they have nothing to do with a church
[1:08:58] they don't want to go to church their
[1:09:00] name was not even written in the book of
[1:09:04] life amen
[1:09:07] so when you go back again into those uh
[1:09:11] the house of the women you're gonna find
[1:09:13] that esther is put on the lem's book of
[1:09:15] life
[1:09:16] never to be raised
[1:09:18] the foolish virgin is in the book of
[1:09:20] life
[1:09:21] the mixed multitude is in the book of
[1:09:24] life they're going to speak about them
[1:09:25] but after a while their name will be
[1:09:27] removed
[1:09:28] they're not going to call them again
[1:09:30] amen and then there is another category
[1:09:33] that will never even been involved under
[1:09:37] choosing amen when god called god will
[1:09:40] never call them
[1:09:42] amen some of them they're going to be
[1:09:45] called and they're going to depart with
[1:09:47] a falling away
[1:09:49] everybody clear
[1:09:50] if somebody missed that one that was
[1:09:52] your part
[1:09:54] so let's go to esther chapter three
[1:10:02] if you need more clarification i gave
[1:10:04] you the reading in the book of the
[1:10:06] church in the church book
[1:10:09] you can review that
[1:10:10] and lord willing down the road if we
[1:10:13] have time we will preach on the book of
[1:10:15] life
[1:10:16] itself
[1:10:20] esther chapter 3 if you dare you can say
[1:10:23] amen
[1:10:26] few people
[1:10:28] you there praise the name of the lord
[1:10:31] now let's buckle up
[1:10:35] after these things
[1:10:38] did king ahazarus promote him
[1:10:41] the son of hamedata
[1:10:43] the
[1:10:44] agar guide we already explained to you
[1:10:47] who herman is
[1:10:49] the right hand of the king like lucifer
[1:10:51] we gave you scripture from esther
[1:10:54] the scripture here is calling him and a
[1:10:58] naga guide
[1:11:04] thank you jesus
[1:11:05] amen
[1:11:08] and advance him
[1:11:10] and set his seat above all the presses
[1:11:12] that were with him that's lucifer above
[1:11:15] right
[1:11:17] and all the king's servants
[1:11:19] that were in the king's gate bowed
[1:11:23] and reverenced him
[1:11:25] for the king had so commanded
[1:11:29] so the commandment
[1:11:31] to fall down
[1:11:33] to worship heaven
[1:11:35] came from the king
[1:11:38] brother stephen i thought you said that
[1:11:39] king represented the lord
[1:11:43] amen
[1:11:44] okay
[1:11:47] but mordecai bow not
[1:11:52] even though it seems like
[1:11:54] the lord permitted that
[1:11:58] but mordecai said no
[1:12:03] there is a great temptation coming up
[1:12:07] upon the people of the earth
[1:12:10] begin together
[1:12:12] okay
[1:12:13] then
[1:12:15] the king's servant which were in the
[1:12:17] king's gate said to mordechai
[1:12:20] why
[1:12:21] transgress you the king's commandment
[1:12:27] it is written in the bible
[1:12:33] amen
[1:12:34] why you don't do it
[1:12:39] hallelujah
[1:12:42] praise the name of the lord
[1:12:45] verse 4
[1:12:46] now we came to pass
[1:12:49] i gave you three and four but this book
[1:12:51] is
[1:12:52] unfolding
[1:12:55] i don't even know what to do
[1:12:58] now he came to pass
[1:13:00] when they spoke daily to him
[1:13:02] somebody begin to put pressure on
[1:13:05] mordecai
[1:13:07] why is mordecai
[1:13:10] not trying to bow down
[1:13:12] or maybe he hated
[1:13:15] him
[1:13:16] no no it's a problem heyman is persian
[1:13:19] he's a jew so he has a prejudice problem
[1:13:22] it is not about that
[1:13:26] amen
[1:13:27] now he came to pass when they spoke
[1:13:30] daily and how can not to them
[1:13:32] that they told him
[1:13:34] to see where the mordecai's mother would
[1:13:37] stand in other words let's go tell it
[1:13:39] with him and we're going to see where
[1:13:41] he's going to stand with his decision
[1:13:43] whether he's going to stick to his
[1:13:45] decision or he's going to give away
[1:13:47] there is a great temptation coming upon
[1:13:51] all the people of the earth
[1:13:54] i'm preparing you
[1:13:56] you better get this
[1:13:58] we don't know what is coming up ahead
[1:14:00] amen
[1:14:02] four
[1:14:03] he had told them that he was huh
[1:14:08] so the problem
[1:14:10] with mordechai
[1:14:12] is not
[1:14:13] mordecai
[1:14:18] i send you reading you remember
[1:14:21] i told you to read the jew right
[1:14:24] the jew means what
[1:14:26] who is a jew
[1:14:32] amen
[1:14:33] because the jews were the people of
[1:14:35] judah
[1:14:36] amen
[1:14:38] but paul says that the jew is not the
[1:14:40] one outwardly it's the one
[1:14:45] it is not those that are of the flesh
[1:14:47] that are children of war
[1:14:49] so paul begin to explain to us that the
[1:14:52] true jew
[1:14:54] are christian
[1:14:57] amen
[1:14:58] so the problem with mordecai is not a
[1:15:02] feeling problem
[1:15:04] it is not a personality problem it is
[1:15:08] not a prejudice problem
[1:15:10] the reason why he is resisting a man
[1:15:14] is because he is jew
[1:15:20] everybody is bowing
[1:15:28] is a jew a jew in the scripture it's a
[1:15:32] genuine christian i send you all
[1:15:35] scripture
[1:15:36] amen
[1:15:38] brother brother
[1:15:40] and the scripture says
[1:15:42] when we are dead in christ
[1:15:44] we became our abraham seed
[1:15:47] paul speak of it
[1:15:49] and that which is june
[1:15:51] is not you what
[1:15:54] it's not about the country now
[1:15:56] that by jews
[1:15:58] inwardly therefore
[1:16:01] if you are born of the spirit of god
[1:16:04] you are abraham and hell with abraham
[1:16:07] according to the promise
[1:16:09] therefore every promise that god gave
[1:16:12] abraham is what
[1:16:14] because spiritually you are abraham
[1:16:18] we are going slowly i'm still
[1:16:21] moving the airplane up we already left
[1:16:23] the airport
[1:16:25] you are more of a jew
[1:16:29] than you would be if you were born in
[1:16:31] the
[1:16:33] in other words as a christian you have
[1:16:36] more right than the jewish that are in
[1:16:39] israel
[1:16:43] because you are of the royal seed of
[1:16:46] abraham
[1:16:47] [Music]
[1:16:49] amen
[1:16:50] you are more of a jew because you are a
[1:16:54] jew that is what
[1:16:55] born of a promise from
[1:16:58] which god gave abraham and abraham
[1:17:01] accepted it by
[1:17:03] and that is what made him what he
[1:17:06] so you also by faith
[1:17:08] you are identified with abraham
[1:17:12] that's why the jews say we are abraham's
[1:17:16] seed
[1:17:17] abraham our father says
[1:17:19] jesus said if you were abraham's seed
[1:17:23] you would have liked me too
[1:17:25] because abraham desired to see me
[1:17:29] but you are hurting me
[1:17:31] that means you are not children of who
[1:17:34] because every seed must reproduce
[1:17:37] according to its own kind
[1:17:40] you are of your father there
[1:17:43] he was a murderer that's why you're
[1:17:46] gonna kill me on the cross
[1:17:50] after all
[1:17:51] a jew is just
[1:17:53] separation and crossover hebrew and so
[1:17:57] forth like that
[1:17:59] now it seems like
[1:18:01] the state
[1:18:03] is backing up
[1:18:05] this commandment
[1:18:09] combined meaning
[1:18:11] it seems like
[1:18:12] king hazares is the one backing up the
[1:18:16] worship of heaven
[1:18:19] brother stephen so you mean god
[1:18:22] is pushing us into this
[1:18:25] take detroit number 13
[1:18:32] we're going slowly
[1:18:35] amen
[1:18:37] deuteronomy 13 verse one
[1:18:40] always bring your bible whether in the
[1:18:42] ipad i poured i what just bring your
[1:18:45] bible
[1:18:52] deuteronomy 13 verse 1.
[1:18:55] everybody ready
[1:18:56] [Music]
[1:18:58] if they rise among you
[1:19:02] or a dreamers of dreams
[1:19:04] and give you a sign and a wonder
[1:19:07] somebody do miracle
[1:19:10] and the sun or wonder come to pass
[1:19:14] in other words somebody stand here and
[1:19:16] prophesy tomorrow this this happened and
[1:19:18] tomorrow it happened
[1:19:20] people have a tendency whoa the
[1:19:22] scriptures say if a prophet says
[1:19:24] something and what he said comes to pass
[1:19:26] you must what listen to this prophet
[1:19:29] but let's relax here
[1:19:31] amen
[1:19:32] and the son and the wonder come to pass
[1:19:35] where of he spoke to you saying
[1:19:38] let us go
[1:19:39] after other gods
[1:19:42] which you have not known
[1:19:44] and let us serve them
[1:19:46] so no matter how much
[1:19:49] miracle
[1:19:50] this prophet is doing
[1:19:53] watch him on the word
[1:19:57] amen
[1:19:59] watch him on the word
[1:20:01] if his miracle happened
[1:20:04] but
[1:20:05] his teaching
[1:20:06] is deviating you from god into something
[1:20:11] else
[1:20:13] what does he mean
[1:20:17] verse 3
[1:20:19] you shall
[1:20:20] listen to the word of that prophet
[1:20:27] i thought god say if a prophet speak
[1:20:30] something happened listen to him
[1:20:34] you shall not
[1:20:36] hearken to the word of that prophet
[1:20:39] oh that dreamer of dreams
[1:20:42] for who
[1:20:44] not satan
[1:20:48] i'm going slowly
[1:20:50] the commandment came from king a hazard
[1:20:53] okay
[1:20:54] for the lord your god prove you
[1:21:01] you okay now
[1:21:03] stay with the message
[1:21:05] stay with the world
[1:21:08] [Music]
[1:21:10] no matter how good the pastor is
[1:21:13] how good the preacher is
[1:21:15] if his preaching is not according to the
[1:21:18] message watch out
[1:21:24] because it's god proving you
[1:21:32] it is the lord your god proves you
[1:21:36] to know
[1:21:37] whether you
[1:21:39] love the lord your god we for you
[1:21:42] and we follow you
[1:21:44] everybody clear there
[1:21:48] we clear there
[1:21:50] so the pressure that comes upon you god
[1:21:53] permitted
[1:21:59] but it's a test
[1:22:01] amen
[1:22:03] but mordecai
[1:22:05] you don't follow the king's commandment
[1:22:09] mordecai said no
[1:22:17] brother stephen
[1:22:18] you mean god is doing something like
[1:22:20] this
[1:22:21] go to matthew chapter 4.
[1:22:24] we are traveling now
[1:22:26] you can unbuckle because i got the
[1:22:28] altitude
[1:22:33] the plane is now stable we are not like
[1:22:35] this now
[1:22:36] amen
[1:22:38] matthew chapter four verse one if you're
[1:22:41] there you can say amen
[1:22:45] this is jesus the son of god
[1:22:49] then was jesus
[1:22:51] led up of the devil
[1:22:54] [Music]
[1:22:57] who was leading jesus christ
[1:23:00] oh so the spirit of god
[1:23:03] david said he's gonna lead me to green
[1:23:05] pasture
[1:23:06] he's going to lead me to steal water
[1:23:09] that's what david said
[1:23:11] so if the spirit of god is leading jesus
[1:23:14] christ it's going to lead him to steal
[1:23:16] water he's going to lead him to green
[1:23:19] pasture
[1:23:26] then once jesus led up of the
[1:23:29] the holy ghost
[1:23:30] into the
[1:23:32] to be what of who
[1:23:36] the holy ghost pushing jesus christ
[1:23:38] toward the devil
[1:23:42] amen
[1:23:44] amen
[1:23:45] jesus can say ah it's not me it's the
[1:23:48] holy ghost that brought me here
[1:23:51] amen
[1:23:52] but when the devil came
[1:23:54] instead of jesus god saying well because
[1:23:57] the holy ghost brought me here i must
[1:23:59] leave it alone
[1:24:01] when the devil came jesus pulled the
[1:24:03] sword
[1:24:04] it is written it is written it is
[1:24:07] written it is
[1:24:12] [Applause]
[1:24:15] to written that every christian
[1:24:18] when you take god and his word
[1:24:22] you can defeat the devil anywhere
[1:24:25] anytime under any circumstances
[1:24:33] why didn't jesus say oh
[1:24:36] i am led by the spirit so it means that
[1:24:39] i'm gonna let it go
[1:24:41] amen

[1:25:43] people to do

[1:27:11] wants to show the people of pleasure
[1:27:14] that i have

[1:27:21] mordecai was going to walmart
[1:27:24] nobody knew him

[1:27:29] nobody knew his religion
[1:27:32] people saw him like a good man
[1:27:34] a good neighbor a good co-worker but
[1:27:38] when pressure comes

[1:27:42] religion of
[1:27:44] mordechai no more the name of more the

[1:29:02] he could turn the church against you he
[1:29:05] can do most anything it's god's will for
[1:29:09] him to do it we are taught that these
[1:29:12] that it is more precious than god to us
[1:29:16] but stephen
[1:29:18] in a message who is this mercy
[1:29:21] see we have bypassed that
[1:29:24] brother wanna explain that when jesus
[1:29:26] was born jesus came from the thought of
[1:29:28] god
[1:29:30] into the logos
[1:29:31] and from the logos in flesh
[1:29:34] brother branham called this the regular
[1:29:36] line
[1:29:37] he said but when me and you we came
[1:29:40] we bypassed our teopany
[1:29:43] we left from the thought to flesh
[1:29:47] that's why we forgot our identity
[1:29:50] so for god to bring your identity out
[1:29:55] amen
[1:29:56] he brings a love
[1:29:58] to bring the true you out
[1:30:03] [Laughter]

[1:30:12] like adam but when testing of duh
[1:30:16] it is not your testing
[1:30:22] they are not testing you
[1:30:24] they are testing the message in you
[1:30:32] hallelujah
[1:30:35] then we are taken up to this body that
[1:30:38] we are prepared
[1:30:40] that was prepared for us before the
[1:30:42] foundation of the world it is the word
[1:30:45] there that we skip
[1:30:47] to come right around
[1:30:49] down here to be tempted and
[1:30:53] ah my god
[1:30:55] take first corinthians chapter 10

[1:31:32] right here
[1:31:34] in other words all temptation
[1:31:36] there is no temptation
[1:31:39] taking you
[1:31:40] but such as common to men
[1:31:43] but god is what
[1:31:46] who will not suffer you
[1:31:48] to be tempted above
[1:31:51] that you are
[1:31:53] so when that pressure comes on you
[1:31:57] just remember

[1:39:03] fall down
[1:39:05] and worship that he should be cast into
[1:39:07] the midst of the fiery furnace

[1:48:00] i am coming
[1:48:05] oh my god
[1:48:08] the gear is so tight
[1:48:10] that i don't know if i need to turn to
[1:48:12] the airport
[1:48:14] amen
[1:48:15] so the batter is about a religion
[1:48:19] not the man
[1:48:20] your faith is put to test
[1:48:25] but
[1:48:27] agag
[1:48:28] we found out that
[1:48:30] haman is a nega guide
[1:48:32] we understand the jew now
[1:48:34] what is the negative what do we have to
[1:48:37] do with this
[1:48:38] take first samia
[1:48:43] if somebody's failed you shout and we
[1:48:45] stop and we continue again
[1:48:47] amen
[1:48:54] i want you to say whoa
[1:48:56] he preached three hours
[1:49:00] didn't preach three hours it's included
[1:49:02] your music
[1:49:05] and your song and your song special
[1:49:08] [Music]
[1:49:09] take that man it's minus minus then you
[1:49:11] see
[1:49:17] your pastor is something
[1:49:18] [Laughter]
[1:49:23] first samuel chapter 15
[1:49:26] verse 1.
[1:49:29] buckle up here
[1:49:32] samuel also said to saul
[1:49:34] the lord sent me to anoint you to be
[1:49:36] king over his people
[1:49:38] over israel now therefore how can you to
[1:49:41] the voice of the word of the lord
[1:49:45] can you close that i don't know why is
[1:49:47] that popping up no no no not the script
[1:49:50] oh brother david can you close the
[1:49:53] screen
[1:49:56] go ahead and click that uh-huh
[1:49:58] not the second one yes
[1:50:01] the devil is wasting his time
[1:50:04] amen
[1:50:06] that says the lord
[1:50:08] i remember
[1:50:09] that which who
[1:50:12] we okay
[1:50:14] the first bad i was with who
[1:50:16] so when saul came god remember amalek
[1:50:20] because he said put it in the book
[1:50:23] now i remember malek
[1:50:26] hallelujah
[1:50:28] did to israel
[1:50:30] how he laid
[1:50:31] wait
[1:50:32] for him in the way when he came up from
[1:50:36] egypt
[1:50:37] so amalek
[1:50:39] is a spirit
[1:50:40] that always lays in weight
[1:50:47] it's important
[1:50:50] when israel came out of egypt
[1:50:53] so when you're coming from a trial
[1:50:56] listen very carefully
[1:50:58] you need to be taught this
[1:51:00] when you're coming from a battle
[1:51:02] when you're coming from a hard situation
[1:51:07] be careful
[1:51:09] amalek always lay weight
[1:51:12] for you
[1:51:14] why
[1:51:15] does amalek wait for you after a battle
[1:51:20] amalek always wait for you to be going
[1:51:24] through a hard situation
[1:51:26] when you come out from that battle
[1:51:30] you are tired
[1:51:32] that's when amalek approaches
[1:51:35] be careful
[1:51:38] jump down
[1:51:39] to verse three now go
[1:51:42] and smite the malek
[1:51:44] and elderly destroy
[1:51:47] i thought the lord said it was his
[1:51:49] battle
[1:51:50] why is he sending soul
[1:51:54] you see now
[1:51:56] smite
[1:51:57] and destroy all that they have
[1:52:00] and spare not
[1:52:03] if you notice here
[1:52:06] god say not only do you destroy a malek
[1:52:10] but destroy everything that belongs to
[1:52:14] amalek
[1:52:15] in other words amalek
[1:52:18] and his belongings are cursed
[1:52:22] do me a favor keep your finger right
[1:52:25] here
[1:52:26] okay
[1:52:27] keep your finger right there it's
[1:52:29] important
[1:52:30] go to esther chapter now we're going to
[1:52:32] come back here
[1:52:34] go to esther chapter 9
[1:52:36] keep your finger right there
[1:52:38] you need to understand this thing
[1:52:42] because something is coming up
[1:52:46] you there
[1:52:48] esther chapter nine keep uh first
[1:52:51] samuel chapter 15. let's go to esther
[1:52:54] chapter nine
[1:52:55] are you there
[1:52:57] take the first five
[1:52:59] somebody's still flipping pages
[1:53:02] you okay
[1:53:03] roof we okay
[1:53:05] are you alive
[1:53:08] you okay
[1:53:09] okay
[1:53:10] thus
[1:53:11] the jews
[1:53:13] smote all the enemies
[1:53:16] with the stroke of the sword
[1:53:18] and slaughter
[1:53:20] and destruction and did what they would
[1:53:23] to those that hated them everybody clear
[1:53:26] job two verse 10
[1:53:28] the ten sons of heaven the son of
[1:53:31] hamadeta the enemy of the jews
[1:53:34] saluted but under
[1:53:38] laid not there
[1:53:40] so when they kill
[1:53:42] the son of a man
[1:53:44] they don't touch their belonging
[1:53:46] i'm going slowly
[1:53:48] why
[1:53:50] go to verse 15.
[1:53:52] for the jew that were in shushan
[1:53:56] gathered themselves together on the 14th
[1:53:58] day also of the martha
[1:54:00] and slew 300 men at shushan but under
[1:54:05] prey they laid not there
[1:54:08] everybody clear
[1:54:10] jump to verse 16.
[1:54:12] but the other jews
[1:54:14] that were in the king's province
[1:54:16] gathered themselves together and stood
[1:54:19] for their life and had rest from their
[1:54:22] enemy and slew off their foes 75 000 but
[1:54:26] they lay not their hand on there
[1:54:29] why the jews in the time of esther
[1:54:33] when they are killing the enemy they
[1:54:36] don't touch their
[1:54:38] stuff
[1:54:41] are you there now let's go back to
[1:54:43] saying
[1:54:47] i'll give you a test of the future
[1:54:51] so you remember
[1:54:53] first samuel chapter 17 verse 3 15 verse
[1:54:56] 3
[1:54:57] now go and smite him like and not only
[1:55:00] destroy what
[1:55:02] so the staff of amalek are cursed
[1:55:06] and that they have and spared them not
[1:55:10] but slave of what
[1:55:12] and woman infant and
[1:55:14] oxen
[1:55:16] and camel and destroy everything
[1:55:21] everybody there
[1:55:22] verse five
[1:55:23] and saul came to a city of amalek
[1:55:26] and laid in the valley why is seoul in
[1:55:30] the valley
[1:55:33] drop down to verse seven
[1:55:35] and so smart they are malacat from
[1:55:37] havilah
[1:55:39] until you come to sure that is opposite
[1:55:42] egypt
[1:55:43] and he took
[1:55:44] who
[1:55:49] he took ag king of what
[1:55:56] heaven was who
[1:56:03] are we okay now
[1:56:04] are we okay now
[1:56:06] the very king
[1:56:08] of amalek
[1:56:10] the title of the king of amalek is a gag
[1:56:16] amen
[1:56:18] but do you know that the jews
[1:56:20] are the royal seed of israel
[1:56:26] you got that agag is the royal seed of
[1:56:31] amalek
[1:56:31] [Music]
[1:56:35] we okay now
[1:56:37] now the battle of amalek
[1:56:41] started with joshua
[1:56:44] god said i'm going to have war with
[1:56:46] amalek from generation to generation
[1:56:50] that brother open up with mordechai
[1:56:56] are we okay now
[1:56:57] so it is not mordecai and emma is hiding
[1:57:05] are you there
[1:57:06] it is god and i am elect fighting
[1:57:14] praise the name of the lord
[1:57:17] edgard the king of emma like so it's
[1:57:20] royal seed striking
[1:57:22] here his name of the king of amalek
[1:57:27] let's go to
[1:57:28] chapter 18.
[1:57:30] i'm skipping certain things here
[1:57:33] if you watch the video down you can read
[1:57:35] it at home
[1:57:37] chapter 18 verse 15
[1:57:39] then probably
[1:57:40] i'm gonna head to the airport so you
[1:57:42] suck what you have
[1:57:44] amen
[1:57:47] verse 15
[1:57:49] samuel is dead
[1:57:51] soul is in
[1:57:53] the prophet nobody speaks so he pulled
[1:57:55] samuel out
[1:57:57] the reason why they pulled samuel out
[1:57:59] because he was under the blood of bugs
[1:58:02] and goat
[1:58:03] if somebody today is pulled
[1:58:06] by a witch
[1:58:08] that person is not saved
[1:58:11] he is in hell
[1:58:13] once the blood of jesus christ was poor
[1:58:16] the devil had no access to believing
[1:58:23] so you got that caviar let's go to verse
[1:58:25] 15
[1:58:27] and then samuel came up and began to
[1:58:29] speak to saul
[1:58:31] he said wherefore when so saw they
[1:58:34] behaved
[1:58:35] himself wisely
[1:58:36] he was afraid of him
[1:58:38] i'm trying to see where am i
[1:58:42] maybe i got the wrong scripture
[1:58:45] brother micah daly
[1:58:47] if he's there usually
[1:58:50] he gets me the good scripture
[1:58:54] amen
[1:58:57] i might have to give it to you later on
[1:58:59] but what happened
[1:59:00] is
[1:59:01] when
[1:59:03] when samuel came out
[1:59:06] samuel when he came out he reminded so
[1:59:10] that what you did that was wrong
[1:59:12] was god told you to destroy amalek
[1:59:16] and instead of destroying amalek you
[1:59:19] preserve america
[1:59:21] amen because david had to face them at
[1:59:24] the amalekite again
[1:59:26] you thought seoul destroyed them he did
[1:59:28] it
[1:59:29] amen
[1:59:30] now god is against you because of amalek
[1:59:35] so god hated amalek so much
[1:59:41] what is in amalek
[1:59:44] god hates him
[1:59:45] brother branham help me
[1:59:48] when joshua enter in the land of canaan
[1:59:51] don't you let he say don't you let one
[1:59:54] of them leave
[1:59:55] if it's a cute little baby a little what
[2:00:00] oh and i'm all right kill it
[2:00:03] you remember
[2:00:04] he shall go to beer namalika
[2:00:07] he shall pollute the camp
[2:00:10] and when those little things come back
[2:00:12] like that
[2:00:14] disagreeing with the
[2:00:17] get rid of that
[2:00:18] we're trying to figure out what is
[2:00:20] amalek
[2:00:22] i don't care what denomination it
[2:00:24] belongs
[2:00:25] if they are contrary to that word get
[2:00:28] the thing out of you it is air
[2:00:34] growing little malachite
[2:00:37] looks cute
[2:00:38] looks innocent looks like it's all right
[2:00:41] brother micah deli
[2:00:43] but don't you have anything to do with
[2:00:45] it
[2:00:46] you stay away from it
[2:00:49] you just remember an amalekite come on
[2:00:53] anything that does what
[2:00:58] are we clear now
[2:01:00] we clear now
[2:01:01] that's why god said destroy amalek
[2:01:08] stay away from it
[2:01:10] had nothing to do with it at all
[2:01:12] how many beliefs that's the truth
[2:01:15] sure it is see stay away from it
[2:01:19] if it denies the word what is it you are
[2:01:22] of the devil your father for he is the
[2:01:26] one that what
[2:01:30] you okay now
[2:01:34] amalek
[2:01:35] lucifer
[2:01:36] if whatever it takes to begin with
[2:01:39] and whatever god gives them to begin
[2:01:42] with that's what he ever remains
[2:01:44] and the tactics of reasoning is what
[2:01:47] satan used that's what he ever use is
[2:01:50] reasoning
[2:01:51] any enemy that written against or any
[2:01:54] person
[2:01:55] any church
[2:01:57] any organization any individual that was
[2:02:00] that reason against one
[2:02:02] punctuation not the word one punctuation
[2:02:07] of god's word is yours
[2:02:09] it takes the word
[2:02:11] to defeat there
[2:02:13] amalek denies the word
[2:02:20] because anything that is against christ
[2:02:23] is what
[2:02:24] and anything that is against the word is
[2:02:26] against
[2:02:27] because christ is though
[2:02:30] i don't care what it is if it's against
[2:02:32] god's words be a guest
[2:02:35] that's you all
[2:02:36] anything that is against the world is
[2:02:38] yours
[2:02:39] our luck is your enemy
[2:02:46] remember for he said because the lord
[2:02:49] has sown
[2:02:50] that their lord will have war with who
[2:02:54] from generation two
[2:02:56] so amalek spoke about the devil
[2:03:00] who incarnated heaven
[2:03:03] are you there
[2:03:04] so the battle is not about mordecai
[2:03:08] and heaven
[2:03:10] the battle is between god and the devil
[2:03:16] that's why brother branham preached
[2:03:22] in the book of faith
[2:03:26] brother preach conflict between who
[2:03:30] and who
[2:03:31] that's the battle
[2:03:35] hallelujah
[2:03:36] [Music]
[2:03:37] but do you realize that there is only
[2:03:40] two powers in the old universe
[2:03:43] of all our differences between nation
[2:03:45] are differences between each other and
[2:03:47] everything it's all mount up two
[2:03:51] there is only
[2:03:52] there is only
[2:03:54] two powers and two kingdoms and those
[2:03:57] power is what
[2:03:58] god's power and
[2:04:01] every world
[2:04:03] every disorder
[2:04:05] everything that comes along it is
[2:04:07] controlled by god's power all
[2:04:11] because that is the only true power
[2:04:14] there is
[2:04:19] amen
[2:04:21] this word is not standing in the grip of
[2:04:24] two great spiritual forces
[2:04:26] and they are both religious forces
[2:04:29] and i believe that these great forces
[2:04:31] are soon coming to ah
[2:04:35] both of these great forces were
[2:04:36] represented in the two sons of who
[2:04:40] keep that in mind because i'm heading to
[2:04:41] the airport
[2:04:43] people who follow the pillar of fire
[2:04:46] will certainly have ah
[2:04:49] don't worry it's not to be above you
[2:04:53] but they are ready for that
[2:04:56] so when that rough time is coming
[2:04:58] translation also is coming
[2:05:05] and that damn that's right
[2:05:07] just ready to go
[2:05:09] for the lamb overcame them
[2:05:12] and them that follow him because they
[2:05:15] were called chosen to the faithful the
[2:05:17] elected of god
[2:05:19] the spirit of the world hates
[2:05:22] the spirit of god
[2:05:24] and because he can overcome the spirit
[2:05:26] of the lord
[2:05:28] he tries to do what
[2:05:31] destroy mordechai
[2:05:35] okay
[2:05:36] destroy mordechai in whom the spirit of
[2:05:40] the truth
[2:05:42] because monica is a jew a jew is one who
[2:05:45] is born again
[2:05:48] persecution
[2:05:50] and trials are what
[2:05:52] put your car in neutral
[2:05:55] normal part of christian life
[2:05:57] there is only one thing you can do about
[2:05:59] them
[2:06:00] committed them all to
[2:06:03] judge not and live there out working and
[2:06:06] final judgment to who
[2:06:08] put your car in neutral when it comes
[2:06:11] are you there
[2:06:12] i will also keep this from the hour of
[2:06:15] what
[2:06:16] which shall come upon all the world to
[2:06:19] try them that dwell upon the world the
[2:06:21] earth
[2:06:22] this verse is not declaration
[2:06:26] that the true church will go into the
[2:06:28] tribulation
[2:06:30] if it meant that he would have said that
[2:06:33] but he said i will keep thee from the
[2:06:36] hour of work
[2:06:38] this temptation is exactly
[2:06:41] like the temptation is needed
[2:06:44] it will be a very inviting proposition
[2:06:49] held up in direct opposition
[2:06:53] to god's commandment
[2:06:55] commanded world
[2:06:56] because according to the jews you cannot
[2:06:59] bow before anyone
[2:07:00] except god
[2:07:02] amen
[2:07:03] and yet
[2:07:05] it seems like it's the king that said it
[2:07:09] and yet from the standpoint of what
[2:07:13] human reasoning it will be very
[2:07:16] it is king of hazards that saved it
[2:07:22] you see now
[2:07:24] so enlightening
[2:07:26] and life-giving
[2:07:28] asked to fool the world
[2:07:31] it is coming
[2:07:33] they want to tell you don't go to church
[2:07:37] oh no no no it makes sense it makes
[2:07:38] sense you see they're just trying to do
[2:07:40] this this god is testing you
[2:07:46] only the very left
[2:07:48] will not be full
[2:07:50] the temptation will come as follows at
[2:07:53] the bottom
[2:07:55] the ecumenical move
[2:07:57] that has started on what seems such a
[2:08:00] beautiful and blessed principle
[2:08:03] fulfilling christ's prayer
[2:08:06] that all might be one religious
[2:08:09] become so strong politically
[2:08:13] it's getting a momentum already
[2:08:15] until america
[2:08:17] that she bear pressure upon the
[2:08:21] government to cause us to join
[2:08:24] with her either directly or through a
[2:08:27] difference to the principle enough in
[2:08:30] law
[2:08:32] uh uh daniel all of them under the law
[2:08:35] shadrach so that no people will be
[2:08:38] recognized as actual churches
[2:08:41] unless
[2:08:42] under direct or indirect domination of
[2:08:46] this what
[2:08:47] it seems like it's a good proposition
[2:08:51] as this pressure increase
[2:08:54] abraham taken to the corner
[2:08:56] daniel taking to the corner
[2:08:59] shadrach meshach abednego taking to the
[2:09:01] corner
[2:09:02] are you there
[2:09:03] as this pressure increases
[2:09:06] and it will
[2:09:08] i'm just telling you
[2:09:10] it will be harder to resist
[2:09:13] god is pushing you to the corner but i'm
[2:09:16] coming quickly are you there for to
[2:09:19] resist this to lose what
[2:09:22] and so many will be what
[2:09:25] to go along
[2:09:27] it comes from king of hazards
[2:09:30] for the feel
[2:09:32] it is better to serve god
[2:09:35] in the framework of this organization
[2:09:38] than not to serve god at all
[2:09:42] but they
[2:09:43] but they want
[2:09:45] to believe the devil's lies is to serve
[2:09:48] satan
[2:09:49] even though you may want to call him
[2:09:51] jehovah
[2:09:52] but the elect will not be what
[2:09:55] it's going to be a pressure that appear
[2:09:58] good

[2:10:21] we later

[2:11:16] land the plane that's it i got it
[2:11:18] okay
[2:11:20] now
[2:11:21] the
[2:11:22] amalekite and the canaanite dwelt in
[2:11:25] there
[2:11:27] do you remember me telling you that saul
[2:11:29] was in the valley
[2:11:31] when he was attacking the amalekite
[2:11:33] because the american dwell in there
[2:11:37] remember
[2:11:38] amalek
[2:11:40] lay wait
[2:11:41] when you come out of a battle
[2:11:44] are you there
[2:11:46] when you just went through a hard
[2:11:48] situation
[2:11:49] a hard experience
[2:11:51] when you are still in the valley
[2:11:55] you okay now
[2:11:56] that's when amalek ambushes you
[2:12:02] lord help me jump to verse 45
[2:12:06] hallelujah jump to verse 45
[2:12:13] 14 45
[2:12:18] go to verse 40
[2:12:23] verse 40. and they rose up early in the
[2:12:26] morning and got them into the top of the
[2:12:29] mountain saying lo
[2:12:31] we'll be here and we'll go up to the
[2:12:33] place which the lord had promised for we
[2:12:35] have seen
[2:12:36] a background
[2:12:38] israel murmur
[2:12:40] you can read this chapter at home
[2:12:42] god told israel that moses all the
[2:12:44] people that murmur
[2:12:46] novel none of them will enter to the
[2:12:47] promised land and because the murmur i'm
[2:12:50] going to leave them into the desert for
[2:12:52] 40 years and i'm going to kill all of
[2:12:54] them except joshua and caleb
[2:12:57] are you there
[2:12:58] the sin that's why israel say we sin
[2:13:02] so israel woke up he said ah we sin but
[2:13:06] lord we're gonna go to the promised land
[2:13:08] regardless we're gonna go to the
[2:13:10] promised land
[2:13:11] watch carefully
[2:13:14] verse 41 and moses says
[2:13:17] wherefore now do you transgress the
[2:13:19] commandment of the lord
[2:13:21] but he shall not what
[2:13:23] the lord already rejected you
[2:13:26] don't try to go in the promised land
[2:13:29] because you already do not to god
[2:13:32] verse 42
[2:13:33] god not up
[2:13:36] why father
[2:13:38] is not among you
[2:13:41] what now
[2:13:42] that you might you'll be not smitten
[2:13:45] before you are
[2:13:46] remember on verse 25 there are malachite
[2:13:50] wars in that valley
[2:13:53] israel sin
[2:13:55] and israel's presumed
[2:13:58] brother branham use this for presumption
[2:14:00] like i'm going to go regardless moses
[2:14:03] said don't go because your relationship
[2:14:06] with god is bad
[2:14:10] god is not in your life
[2:14:12] don't go
[2:14:14] let's go to verse 43 why moses
[2:14:17] for they are malachi you see that
[2:14:20] and the canaanites are there before
[2:14:24] and you shall fall by them
[2:14:28] because you are not
[2:14:29] you are turned away from the lord
[2:14:32] therefore the lord will not be with
[2:14:36] but they did what
[2:14:39] a venture without authority
[2:14:42] they presume to go up to the hilltop
[2:14:46] nevertheless there are
[2:14:49] the ark of the covenant of the lord
[2:14:52] and
[2:14:53] departed not out of there
[2:14:56] so when israel went to this battle he
[2:14:59] was lacking three things and i'm gonna
[2:15:01] land the plane
[2:15:03] the first thing he lacked god with it
[2:15:08] you there
[2:15:09] the second thing
[2:15:10] he lacked the ark of the covenant
[2:15:15] are you there
[2:15:17] which is the word
[2:15:19] your
[2:15:20] bible are you there
[2:15:23] the third thing he lacked moses
[2:15:28] which is the prophet
[2:15:31] your message
[2:15:34] you need god you need the bible says and
[2:15:38] you need blood random things
[2:15:42] are we okay
[2:15:44] israel adventure without god without the
[2:15:48] scripture without the prophet
[2:15:53] amalek said i got it
[2:16:00] watch verse 45 and i land the plane
[2:16:05] then the amalekite
[2:16:07] came down
[2:16:08] and the canaanite which dwelt in the
[2:16:11] hill and smoicked them and disconfeded
[2:16:14] them even to what
[2:16:17] you cannot attack amalek
[2:16:20] without this element
[2:16:24] are you there
[2:16:25] don't fight amalek
[2:16:28] if god your relationship with god is
[2:16:31] messed up you must come back to the
[2:16:33] altar and renew your relationship with
[2:16:36] god
[2:16:37] you must reconsequent your life again
[2:16:40] if you want to resist alex
[2:16:43] you must come back to the world and you
[2:16:45] must come back to the message if you
[2:16:48] want to fight amalek
[2:16:50] god bless you yet stand here
[2:16:58] yep 32
