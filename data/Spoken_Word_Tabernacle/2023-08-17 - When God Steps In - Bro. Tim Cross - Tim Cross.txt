to choose between the two either you believe this man that have been educated by the society do you know that the whole system of this world was designed by the devil amen that's why you heard brother Branham say civilization come of the devil so the devil train you for so long now God is trying to initiate you back and train you the other way that's where the battle starred in us where brother

tonight God is on the throne he's in full control all things work together for the good to them that love the Lord and even the things that we're going through are positioning us and conditioning us for what God has in store ahead amen so we know this to be true tonight and I was hearing a brother testify recently he said I've lived this and so I can say that I've lived this and know God's word

brother yesterday I said I'm preaching to brother shimbo's tomorrow I said I'm already hydrating now amen because we're gonna we're gonna have a good time in the Lord tonight amen y'all y'all are the kind of church that when you come to church you come to have church and so uh it's wonderful amen we're the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty amen we want to read tonight in Saint Luke chapter 17 beginning in verse number 22 again appreciate brother shimbo and the open door and the invitation and each of you that have come this evening to feed upon the word of the Lord and brother shimo was saying people are watching in looking in listening in or feeding on this maybe across the world so we pray the Lord I'll just speak to our hearts tonight uh we can read from the words on the pages but it takes him to come and Quicken it into our lives into our hearts so let's just approach him tonight in prayer just before we read his word Heavenly Father we are grateful tonight Lord that we have a place to come and gather Lord that you would place it upon the hearts Lord of your children to come and worship you tonight and Lord we appreciate Lord what you have done within this body of Believers Lord and as the words of the song say through many dangers talls and snares Lord we have all come but Lord Your Grace has brought us this far and will will take us on Lord and we ask you tonight as the the word is read and as we express father what you've placed upon our hearts May the Holy Spirit father guide this service every word that is spoken Lord give both speaking and hearing Lord that when it's all done and said Lord that the people would see you Lord you would be high and lifted up no man would be visible Lord or remembered but Lord this service would be remembered for What You Do Lord in our midst and and may Lord we as the disciples who walked with you on the Emmaus Road Lord two thousand years ago Lord when they when they even before they knew who you really were Lord they were already asking you to abide with them Lord and to go Lord into a into a place that was set aside and when the doors were closed then you broke the bread and their eyes were open and so Lord that's our desire Lord is for you just to draw Lord near to us tonight Lord your presence be revealed with us Lord that we could take you Lord when we leave this service and Lord as we go to our homes and our jobs and our our respective places Lord that you would continue Lord to reveal yourself to his father God hallelujah we thank you Lord for what you have done in the day and hour that we live Lord there's never been a day like this day Lord there's never been a light that shines Lord and we're walking Lord not only walking in that light but we are actually becoming that light father God As We join to it so Lord may you join yourself to us now Lord and come Lord and do what only you can do we ask it in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen Saint Luke 17 verse 22 and he said unto the disciples the days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and ye shall not see it and they shall say to you see here or see there go not after them nor follow them for as the lightning that lightneth out of the one part under Heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day but first he must suffer many things and be rejected of this generation and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man so he's giving them this as it was so shall it be amen they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drink they bought they sold they planted they built it but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it reigned fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day the day when the son of man is revealed may the Lord bless the reading of his word we could dismiss the service right there amen because amen there's never been a day like this day because we don't look at this scripture now as something off in the future but it's something that we have lived to see the very fulfillment of amen and I want to say this tonight regardless of what Satan might have done amen with the truths that have been revealed in this hour amen there are still they are key foundational principles amen that have been restored to us Amen to join us into a perfect relationship with Jesus Christ the revealed word of the hour and so the revealing of the son of man is to me amen one of the greatest keys to recognizing what God did amen 2000 years ago what God has done in this generation through the ministry of Malachi 4 and the Fulfillment of Saint Luke 17 30 but not only that but what God is doing even now and today now you remember I believe it's in Matthew 16 where Jesus called his disciples and he said whom do men say that I am and then he said whom do you say that I am and Peter spoke those words Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus said blessed art thou Simon barjona flesh and blood not even my own person not even my own presence with you has revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven and Upon This Rock upon this basis I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it so it is that principle it is that rock of Revelation amen that every man woman or child amen that is Born Into the kingdom of God is born under that same basis amen there's a revelation given to them by the Holy Spirit of who Jesus Christ is the revealed word of the hour not of a previous age not of a future age but right here right now and that revelation took Peter to the upper room in obedience to Jesus words until the prophecy that Jesus gave him expressed itself and then Peter himself amen became an extension of Jesus own Ministry his own body manifested here in the Earth amen so if you miss this you can see it all you can you can believe it all carnally or intellectually but you will still wind up in idolatry you will either be worshiping the vessel that the son of man was revealed in much like Nebuchadnezzar was doing in his day amen or you will fail to see what God has done which will bring amen a reproach amen amen it will actually be looking off for something to happen out in the future amen when God has already fulfilled it amen so it'll take the emphasis away from Christ and put it off on something else amen so I I've been listening to the message the Masterpiece and if you hear Brother Branham he's talking about amen how he got the inspiration for this he had gone out to I believe the the Angelus Temple had seen the uh replica of the the Masterpiece of Michelangelo the sculptor Moses with the the part of his knee missing there and he said I believe the flaw is what made it a masterpiece amen but he said notice the flaw is what was removed from the original amen and so then he talks about how God had a masterpiece family in Eden amen which was the expression of himself in humanity I mean every other creature even the animal kingdom amen it was not a complete revelation of God until he had a son standing on the Earth First in a spirit being and then God formed him into a body of flesh made out of the 16 elements of the earth and God breathed into him the breath of life and Earth had a god Earth had a a man over it with dominion over every sphere of the Earth God had a son in His image amen who could express the thoughts of God and could speak creation Amen to call the Animals by their names could place them could restore the order to the Garden that's exactly right amen and so then God wasn't finished revealing his mystery because that manifested attribute was lonely he was looking for a way to extend his life that's right to reproduce his life and when God made Adam amen into a a second fold amen or a further expression he did not go reach back into the Earth no sir he did not reach into the Earth he reached into Adam Hallelujah showing you who the bride is made of she is not made up of pollen substance she is made from him yes sir she is the further part the further revelation of who Christ is which enables him to multiply himself in a mini-membered body on the Earth preach my brother but after that Masterpiece fell God set out to build another masterpiece and so he talked about the prophets Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph right and then he said he come over to the prophets and I'm picking this up in paragraph 70 of the Masterpiece he said all the prophets had flaws all the ones was a portion but speaking of Christ but here at last coming up through that right finally comes the Masterpiece amen the perfect one no fault in him at all he's so perfect reflected of the Builder himself his own image was reflected in his work amen God and Christ were one that's it in so much until he put his own Spirit into him amen and then even the image in the Builder become one so there was no difference between God and Christ because God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself even if and if I may just elaborate on that he was not reconciling the cosmos he was not reconciling pilate or Herod or Pharisees or Sadducees but he was reconciling the portions of the earth that had the book not been forfeited by Adam Adam would have called those names from the earth as the expressed attributes of God's family so the second Adam is coming to reconcile or redeem back those attributes those names that were in the Lamb's Book of Life for the foundation of the world amen amen so even the image and the Builder became one amen God in his sculpture work his masterpiece when Moses was in the work of of Michelangelo a sculpture work that was dead because it had been made out of stone but here and I'm titling this message tonight when God stepped in amen amen when God stepped in because he says here when the master builder when he got his handiwork perfected right he stepped into it hey man Michelangelo is so inspired when he saw what was in his mind born before his very eyes he struck the image and he said speak but the image couldn't answer the image couldn't respond amen but he said when this master builder even had something in his own very image he stepped into it amen so perfected a redeemer of man yes yes so perfect so Godly yet there was no Beauty we should desire it amen I've preached on that before he was saving that for Mrs Jesus Christ that's right you know in every other creature of the male was the most beautiful but in the one that God Made In His Image the more beautiful expression was contained as a mystery until she was birthed fourth amen amen when this virgin born son of the Living God became so perfect and humble and in the image of god Till The Great Master who had brought his life up through the prophets and he would see the fulfilling of all the prophets he was so perfect until God's seeing this he smote him amen he smoked him at Calvary he smote him and he cried out speak amen as Michelangelo did speak amen now here's just a few illustrations of this because we had a pre-figure yes sir of this when a man by the name of uh Abram got a call from God one day a heathen worshiper a root worshiper an idol amen just like all of his ancestors but God spoke to him said Abraham I have purposed and determined Amen to bring you to this expected End Amen I have called you amen separate yourself from your Kindred get you out from this country unto a land that I will show thee amen amen and to prove that this was representation that God had placed into Abraham by for ordination Abraham obeyed him see that's the proof it's not in the hearing but in the obey and being compelled by this voice that is speaking Hallelujah yes Abraham set out on a journey amen amen and God told him as you obey me and as You Follow Me I'm gonna unfold these promises and these blessings in your life in spite of yourself Amen in spite of your weaknesses in spite of the lies you tell or how backslane you become I have already determined it and if you can just have faith in who I am yes I will perform this in your life amen so here's Abraham decades later and it's him and Sarah in what 90 some year old bodies way up here on the back side of the desert there's been all these separations and things and lots down there in the well-watered plains of Sodom and so one day a man after many years of conditioning you see that's what people Miss that's right God don't just pour blessings on you he conditions you [Applause] Prince he conditions you to prepare you amen for royalty and divine attributes to be expressed in your life amen so Abraham and Sarah were separated they were segregated back on the back side of the desert amen seemed like no Prosperity amen everything was hard everything was difficult lot was down there amen of Sodom amen he was accepted he was beloved amen he was in the Inner Circle he had the favor amen but Abraham got a visit one day Hallelujah because God yes yes Jehovah yes came down from The Eternity yes and he took 16 elements and blew three bodies three bodies and then he took one of those bodies and he stepped into it yes my brother Hallelujah and went Elohim when Melchizedek yes stepped into a body of Flesh yes my brother he did not go to Sodom Hallelujah he did not go to the World Council of churches he did not preach repentance without the baptism of the Holy Ghost he did not preach Prosperity he did not go to the nerve centers in the main channels his message was to a call out yes Abraham and Sarah yes I have come to perform the promise in your life amen hallelujah God stepped into a body of Flesh amen the revealing of the son of man yes my brother he turned his back to the title yes why did Sarah laugh Hallelujah yes sir giving us a sign showing us again that just before Sodom Burns amen there's going to change Hallelujah yes my brother and the permissive yes it's gonna be transformed into the perfect yes without that in a moment in a twinkling of an eye yes we will be changed and joined to meet him in the air amen oh we could have church in here tonight amen amen and then there was a time amen when Nebuchadnezzar with his Heathen mind had decided God had incarnated himself in a prophet messenger and Nebuchadnezzar said I will I I I believe this God well why wouldn't you believe it after all he had suffered I believe this God and now everybody's going to bow to him and I'm going to erect an an idol in the image of the prophet and force everybody to Bow and worship and it was going over so good with only three exceptions [Music] the man who knew Daniel the best refused to worship Him because they didn't just know Daniel they knew that God of Daniel and they said we will not bow amen it doesn't matter what you say what you threaten what you try to do we will not bow amen we would rather face the threat of death then bow and he said and you know and I've preached on this before he said well you know fellas we'll give you a second chance we'll give you a second chance we'll do this all again tomorrow and and then and they said no we don't need a second chance it doesn't matter how many times it happens we ain't gonna do it and he said well I'm gonna throw you in the fire furnaces well you you you know what you got to do we know what we gotta do we need power and God was so impressed yes my brother with the stand and the conviction yes and the result yes sir of these three men yes that when Gabriel and Michael and wormwood and all these Mighty Angels stepped up to the throne and said we'll go down God we'll blow out the fire we'll we'll we'll uh we'll extinguish the fire we'll do all these things we'll we'll you know we'll intervene God said no you won't they didn't stand for y'all standing for me amen and then God stepped in [Applause] Hallelujah friend don't you turn around don't you go back don't you be scared of what lies ahead of you you just keep on walking and watch those chains fell off watch those bonds fall off of you even your tormentors will die yes sir but God will meet you in the fire amen he stepped in amen when 120 believers obeyed his instructions and carried in the upper room until they were endued right with power from on high he stepped in that's it now there's a body that has been formed from 16 elements yes sir that are tearing in the upper room until he steps in amen this is the revealing of the son of man not in one man but in many members that's it that's it so much so you've heard me preach on it before Saul Saul why persecute us thou me never had met Jesus in the flesh but the voice said you're persecuting me because he was now incarnate yes in the Spirit-filled believer amen when the Holy Ghost is come yes to speak against it will never be forgiven in this life amen oh my when the church was being compromised by men trying to make the word of God of none effect by forming Creeds and dogmas based on traditions and carnal interpretations of his word right he stepped in amen and he said if an angel from heaven right preach any other thing amen then that which I have preached amen let him be a curse amen was that a man or was that God pray tonight was that a man or was that God was he just another religious scholar or was Christ amen personifying himself in a prophet messenger that's it that's it in the latter days he was a prophet I don't care what any unbeliever says that man had a prophetic Ministry amen but you see a prophetic Ministry can only attract the attention of a prophetic class yes my brother of people and they are drawn to that prophetic Ministry like a magnet where they not only believe the prophecy but they become they become a fulfillment of that prophetic Ministry amen we see it in Revelation Seven Stars in the right hand of Jehovah light Hallelujah to each of the ages oh my arise and shine for thy light has come you don't just receive light you become light amen amen you become a prism and the light is expressing itself through Hallelujah yes sir amen yes my brother Hallelujah so in each age in each of these seven distinct ages he appointed a mouthpiece amen see he struck the image and said speak right you're not just there to look pretty you're there to do something you there to manifest the desires of the sculptor amen he formed you a man to Pur to to to do something to express something to fulfill something yes and so here he is in each of the ages yes giving his word amen amen because God's spoken word is one of the greatest expressions of his power amen amen amen amen Jesus Jesus himself we read it tonight we read it in Saint Luke 17 prophesied prophesied a return of his very person yes my brother the revealing of the son of man right before the end of the Fallen World Order yes Satan's Eden I'm just as Satan crept into godzine and defiled it God has crept into Satan's Eden and restored his very Kingdom amen Hallelujah see before a fallen Eden yes could be restored a fallen Adam had to be restored because Eden didn't fall until Adam failed that's exactly right so Eden cannot be restored amen until Adam comes back amen to his original position amen and when a manifested son and daughter of God yes come back amen into their position that's everything else will fall into order amen amen everything else will recognize there's a manifested son there's a manifested daughter amen Satan will have to dispatch three to do what one used to could do because that's a manifested son they're in their position yes sir there is nothing beyond their reach because they become the very extension of God's power his thoughts his Dominion everything is channeling right through that predestinated believer amen because they're standing right there in their position and Satan cannot budge them and their position brother and sister is behind the revealed word of the hour that's it which is their fortification yes which is their protection which is what Eve stepped out from behind but now the believer won't budge if they have to change churches they'll change churches but they're not departing from that revealed word amen change pastors change friends change jobs whatever it takes amen they recognize I must stay in this position amen amen else I become captive I become subject to Satan's power amen same thing Jesus did it's also written Satan yes sir amen he didn't have to use his his powers he just used the word that's it because every time Satan brings the words out of context that's exactly right that's exactly right because Satan cannot have a revelation he only has carnal understanding that's which he tries to twist to his own benefit but when the full context of the word is given in Revelation amen it puts Satan in his place Hallelujah so a restored Eden will follow a restored Adam is there is there is there disorder in the home there's an atom out of his place [Music] there's a Mrs Adam preacher out of place when there's chaos when there's disorder somebody's not in their position amen somebody's preached forfeited their prayer life that's right amen somebody has put their job over the house of God that's it amen somebody has put the the bills over the tithes that's it something that's out of position yes and so the kingdom is crumbling that's right but when everything is back in its place yes sir God wraps his protection around that hope that marriage that family Hallelujah and it is an end defensible Fortress Satan cannot put a child amen amen amen oh if the church only knew its position one day it will and then the Rapture will go Hallelujah [Music] could not have oh my can't have a restored Eden without a restored Adam hey hey you can't have a restored Adam without a restored Eve one will follow the other [Applause] and we've had a restored Adam for 2 000 years do you know the prophet of God says in many places everything that the first Adam forfeited that's the second Adam restored that's exactly right the problem is Satan keeps displacing the believer God call him back to the word and then Satan will pushed him away until Masterpiece time yes yes my brother so I want to say this tonight amen the revealing of the son of man yes is not to exalt or lift up the man but is to display Christ en redeemed attributes amen the very expression of God's life amen in an Earthly family amen the extension of God or the expansion of his kingdom amen amen amen through his first restored Adam Christ amen we know who that is right you've been taught well he redeemed and resurrected his family amen we had a resurrection when the first Adam raised he didn't rise alone no his Mrs Adam raised with him amen amen Abraham raised with him Sarah raised with me job raised with him amen Joseph raised with him all of that Old Testament bride rose with Adam Amen to be recognized in the resurrection showing that I mean he is the head and all of the attention is on him that's right but he came amen not for his own Redemption but for the Redemption of its attributes amen amen so if he had raised without them it would have been an empty Resurrection it would not have actually been the validation or the Vindication of his ministry because the Vindication wasn't just his own Resurrection but it was what job saw it was what David were told it was what Isaiah he raised those prophets with him to say they had the saith the Lord amen no I had thus saith the Lord amen and every believer who received that prophet's message yes sir is recognized with him amen [Applause] yes my brother yes brother yes why are we shouting because this is not a 2 000 year old event it is a present-day rapture if I be lifted up I will draw all men into myself Hallelujah you are not feeding on a man you are feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man yes sir Hallelujah Hallelujah they're recognizing it you talk about a woke you talk about an Awakening brother Brennan's day you talking about coming out of the closet time for the True Believer to come out of the closet and declare themselves we'd have anything to be ashamed of amen amen amen amen recognized yes sir with him amen so oh y'all are following y'all are following y'all are following a man yes you're following uh of a false prophet they only knew we're we're not just following him we're following what he was following that's it Moses was following the pillar of fire amen and the pillar of fire didn't leave when Moses was taken off the scene the pillar of fire continued amen and the joshuas and the calebs continue to follow amen the pillar of fire amen amen if if Moses was the focal point then you would form a circle around the grave [Music] or or let me say this where Moses was last known to be looking for his return no no but if you were following what Moses was following you would know that Moses message and Ministry amen was to complete a phase of The Exodus but the FED The Exodus wasn't over at Moses departure The Exodus was going on amen amen now personified is a different leader yes but with followers amen Abu had been born in the wilderness and were determined Amen to go all the way amen so the revealing of the son of man is to display Christ amen redeemed attributes oh my I just just lost my place there somehow talking about you know Satan the the greatest the greatest thing a Believer can come to is a revelation of who they are that's exactly what the Holy Spirit just brought it back to me in brother branham's day the voice of healing newsletter magazine fast pray fast pray God send us a prophet and brother Ben said they fail to see they fail to recognize the Awakening of the Bride amen amen amen amen that's what we're shouting about amen amen amen so through his first restored Adam Christ he redeemed and resurrected his family through the Omega revealing let's see yeah we're told Raul that's not that revealing that's exactly right of the same son of man Ministry amen but it would be later yes sir it would be in the future yes sir and I'm calling it The Omega because it is a repeat of the alpha but it is not in infancy no no it is not an infant Acts 2 38 Pentecostal baby although it is born the same way Upon This Rock he never changes the way but this church is born now in the latter H amen as the Capstone amen hallelujah yes the last level of the pyramid yes sir to perfectly match yes my brother the Masterpiece amen Christ amen hallelujah you can see what I'm saying and so through the Omega revealing he'll raise up his new testament body amen and return to Earth yes sir to Rapture them amen my amen I'm almost done we can shout for a while listen to this the anointed ones at the end time yes July 25th 1965. yes sir end of the message paragraph 365. you might have thought today that I was trying to say that about myself being that I was packing this message I have no more to do with it I then nothing no more than just a voice that's it that's it sounds to me like somebody smote the masterpiece and said speak I have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice yes sir and my voice against my better judgment I want it to be a Trapper but it's the will of my father that's it that I declare to do and I am determined to do amen amen and I want to say that tonight amen by the grace of God I don't care what anybody says about it or thinks about it it is the will of my father that I am determined to do I will cross any sea on any Desert any mountain or any Valley When God says go I'm going that's it when God says speak I'm speaking amen if they should hold their peace the rocks will cry out but when you recognize that his King Messiah coming down that mountain you begin to praise you begin to cry out you begin to recognize my healing that's my salvation that's my body change that's my Rapture you are recognizing your headship the revealed word of the hour Hallelujah it's the countdown for the bride the countdown before liftoff oh my I I could preach here for just a moment I I love flight I love Aviation I I've flown planes I've got about eight hours uh flying a Cessna I love it I just can't afford it it's very expensive but my dad when I was a child he would subscribe to the air in space magazine from the Smithsonian and every once in a while they would have a magazine and they would feature the space shuttle now this back years ago you know they have the Challenger and and the discovery and they had all these space shuttles but they would show the cockpit the cockpit or the command center inside the the shuttle as it was standing on the launch pad in Cape Canaveral amen hours before the launch or days before the launch and inside I mean there's all kinds of buttons and screens and levers and straps and all these things but there's also these these things with the big a big long red marker like a tag hanging off of it you know it would say remove before flight before that thing leaves the path there's going to be some things that have to come off oh brother amen you're predestinated to launch you're predestinated for another sphere you're predestinated to break from the Earth's orbits and go into the heavenlies but there's some things that you gotta remove before flight amen it's not safe to try to go up there that's those things hanging on there may be some unforgiveness or maybe a grudge there may be some words I mean there may be some family traits personal habits some things that was handed down some things that served a purpose for a Time Hallelujah but now it's time for this song it's time to remove those things Hallelujah I'm amen losing those things yes forgetting those things yes you're behind me press toward the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus praise God God Hallelujah maybe there were some people hanging around the message I had a tag on them country move yes sir before flight they're just gonna drag the bride down there's too much unbelief there for the bride to lift off the shack has to pull away yes [Applause] forgive me forgive me but Judas had a tag on him remove before Pentecost remove before the resurrection remove before the revealing you're the son of man yes my brother Hallelujah Hallelujah praise God glory to God I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfectly as they are I'm only one that's near when he does it I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it's what I just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it wasn't me it wasn't the seventh angel shows you the revealing of the son of man is another element to the seventh Angels Ministry many recognize his prophetic role in the scriptures but they missed who he introduced [Music] in other words they would cling cling to John after Christ was introduced amen but those who were truly predestinated left John and followed Christ to the crucifixion through the resurrection and under Pentecost and afterwards hallelujah hallelujah they appreciated what John did but what John did was fulfilled in Christ they heard what John said and they followed the voice Hallelujah I believe there's some people in here recognizing tonight recognizing tonight what you're magnetized to is not a man or a Ministry or a movement you're magnetized because you're made of the same substance you heard you heard a like creature you heard a light creature Shout you heard an eagle because you are an eagle and you recognize I too am an eagle and I'm not stand here Hallelujah I'm not a chicken I'm not a barnyard I'm not bound to a diet of bugs and manure I can eat fresh meat amen and I can digest it amen hallelujah you know something I could eat the same Foods Muhammad Ali fought ate and still not fight like him I don't have the DNA I don't have the genetic structure I don't even have the potential preach even if I did eat like he ate and work out like he worked out it's not in me to manifest a champion fighter but the sons of God are led by the spirit of God and they feed upon the word of God which produces the life of God and they can't help it they're just manifesting what was lying in their genes all along Hallelujah praise God praise God it wasn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God amen amen Angel the angel was not the son of man amen he was a messenger from the Son of Man Eliezer was not Isaac but he was an agent there was something I said to Rebecca to bring Mrs Isaac back to Isaiah amen so you recognize Eleazar you're actually recognizing Isaac medicine Amen to take you from where you were to where he is and to remove the difference to remove the separation to remove everything that used to be between you and him Elise are letter through all of that and she didn't stop until she was joined back to her predestinated husband amen amen you're going back to where you originated from you didn't come from the Earth I was not the son of Charles at Ella Brandon I'm not the son of Larry and dalen cross you are not the son of Mr and Mrs Kelly you are a son of God Amen you were birthed into this Earth by a permissive will Union but within you was a predestinated attribute of God hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God praise God yes it's the old time Holy Spirit and the devil can't come near it that's the reason people fear it but it's good enough for me by the label amen it's not a man it's God God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ oh he's Revelation 10 1. he comes to Revelation 10 7 to Quicken Revelation 10 8. Christ is the mighty angel that came to the Earthly Angel to release the seals to the predest today and she's the only one that'll hear it she's the only one that'll recognize the call of the bridegroom calling to his mates the call of the king to the queen come to the throne amen come take your position amen joint heirs royalty equal shared Dominion yes my brother co-equality what Adam and Eve fell from restored now before the millennium before the eighth day before the new Heaven and new earth right here right now speaking squirrels into it yes my brother speaking cancers yes speaking salvation Hallelujah he smote the image and said speak yes sir in my name they shall cast out Devils yes they shall heal the sick they shall speak with you tongues and if they touch any deadly thing it shall not harm them glory to God by this shall all men know you're my disciples when you have love one for the other as it was so shall it be when the conditions of the end time match the conditions of 4 000 years ago God comes on the scene again Hallelujah a repeat a repeat of the original three Ministries three Messengers two go to bind the sheaves two go to bind the tares and bundle them into the World Council of churches even Protestant churches will be bound and bundled right and gathers right in with Roman Catholicism that's right and we seek it to see it taking place right now and then lot who's a type of the make-believer it's down there on the fence trying to be the mayor of Sodom I mean and extinguishing the conviction in his heart and he lost his family as a result of his unbelief where are we Church took the well-watered plains of Solomon you know I heard Brothers say this the other day said look how Micaiah when he gave his prophecy go up but you'll be slaughtered and and hen and I come up said the Lord has given it to us he made the horns made the iron you know we had a great fundamental message but brother Ben said look what he was focused on the material he wasn't looking at the spiritual the true Prophet was looking at the spirit amen because the the material is a derivative of the spiritual the spiritual has got to be right before the material will follow he goes first seek ye first ah the kingdom of God and all of these other things we'll be at it [Applause] get that lined up everything else will have to lie ah man preach amen amen oh yes Abraham the predestinated called out destined for a change destined for a rearrangement of his body to produce the promise amen a masterpiece formed from the original the final commission to the bride yes is revealing amen is revealing the groom multiply and replenish him amen speak eternal life eternal life given through the bride amen amen the seed has to go through the body is that right amen so the final commission to the bride revealing yes see this is the groom revealing in a bride form amen amen and it's an Elisha double portion oh your Master's going to be taken today didn't face Elisha amen he wasn't even calling for the return of Elijah he said where's the God Amen amen the Elisha double portion speak the word glory amen prepare to close tonight they were telling me I saw that this is spoken word Tabernacle is that right is that the name of this church yes sir yes spoken word Tabernacle when he stepped in spoken word Tabernacle yes my brother that's not this building that's the vessel it's a tabernacle for the spoken word to find betting grounds for God to step into that vessel and manifest himself amen Hallelujah we just had a brother visiting from India he lives up in the northeast corner of India close to uh Nepal I believe it is the mountainous region and and he's a a message Pastor brother Roshan and brother Roshan was telling me he said brother Tim you know in India the culture of the of the India the people of they have these castes which is like an order and if you're born into a cast I don't believe you can even graduate to the next you can't marry I mean this it's a very strict uh segregation if you will but he said brother Tim in the highest cast all of this is idolatry all this is Hedonism but you see Satan is a perverted of the real and there Satan don't have one original idea all his ideas are a twist but in the highest cast of these Indian families they believe that they are the are the products of the spoken words of their God they are an order of priests every one of them as soon as they are born is a priest because of a family that they were born into it so what is a priest he's a link between a higher power and something else ain't in trying to be rejoined yes so they believe as the highest caste that they are the result of the spoken word of their God and a priesthood but they are wrong the prophetic class amen is not a family it's not a world order it's not a nation it's not a race it's not a color it's not a culture amen it is the holy spirit amen the kingdom of God cometh without observation [Music] [Applause] as it was so shall it be as it was in Eden so shall it be as it was in the first amend of the flood in the first cataclysmic so shall it be as it was so shall it be when those conditions repeat in the end time God manifests himself again oh my Hallelujah I just got lost amen they believe oh yes they are a prophetic class of people they are the product of the spoken word they had it close in India but we got it amen and you're not just hearing a prophecy you're not just believing prophecy you're not just acknowledging that's the truth but you become you see God told Ezekiel prophesy son of man you see all these dismembered bones you prophesy and you will call them back to the original order and they'll stand up and March a mighty Army just like they did before when God stepped in I want to tell you something he's here his presence is here his power is here his word is here his people are here and Jehovah is here to lead us all the way into the Fulfillment of the promise amen always say brother Bradham is not here well he's coming back but first we got to get in our position Jehovah is here God is here amen and we're his people oh that's it that's it even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed in that day he which shall be upon the Housetop and his stuff in the house let him not come down and take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back remember Lot's wife the son of man was being revealed up on the hill and she was too busy watching Sodom careful friends we don't take our cues from the modern Church we don't borrow from their worship we don't borrow from anything preach in my project keep your eyes amen you shouldn't even be looking in that direction look at the revealing amen remember whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it I tell you that in that night there shall be two men in one bed for one shall be taken and the other shall be left it's so close two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken and the other two men shall be in the field the one shall be taken in the other left and the answer that said unto him where Lord where Lord where will this take place and he said at the fifth wheresoever the body is you're not feeding on a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man where the body is where the word is amazing amen where the message is preeminent amen where the revealed word of the hours you can't keep the Eagles away because they are drawn yes my brother because that's what fulfills the ego potentials so when they hear there's Eagle food being served fresh by a pastor in a local assembly I'm going there because that's the only way I can manifest what's down on the inside with orsoever the body is with the Eagles be gathered together oh don't you love the Lord this evening there's never been a day like this day let's stand tonight to

wife and my they put on a big shindig a Big Show and all those girls danced with him and had a great time but he he eventually realized there's no difference between them and the ones back in Chicago

his visitation they didn't hear what she heard she heard a future home she heard I'm leaving here and I'm going where I belong and she went and began preparing and watching for his return see they all got something but she got something that put her in motion and you know he left an agent there to make sure she had everything she needed to ready her for his return that agency is the Holy Spirit and he's established a Ministry to ensure the bride has everything she needs but the way you know the bride has heard him is her preparation for his return amen oh it's so wonderful amen soon and very
