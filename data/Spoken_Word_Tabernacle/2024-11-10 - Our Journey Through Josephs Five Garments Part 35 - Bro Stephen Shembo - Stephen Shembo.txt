service so take the pressure of going off and Gathering I know it's a wedding We Gather we have all day together but let me deliver the material yes sir are we together praise God you should have slept good if you know the time I go to sleep you are fine you are privilege amen amen my subject this morning is our journey through Joseph's five garment part 35 so I'm going to give you the theme when we finish amen praise God let's go to our scripture I'm waiting on my computer this thing is loaded I preach instead of quot going down quot keep coming climbing back up again told brother Robert I say I don't know what I'm going to do and how far I'm going to go so by God's grace let's see how we can go amen let's go to Psalm 82 one scripture and we've been reading this scripture for more than two month amen am amen amen let's see where we are Psalm 82 praise God Amen I'm just waiting on this guy right here usually when the devil start like this you know what is going on right who Okay praise God all will be well it's loaded and my battery is 7 hour 21 [Laughter] minute amen Oh Glory to God let me see how it's responding it's loaded with something there we go you doom because I'm flying with B52 today okay I got a special Mission so please bule up and uh keep your seat belt we okay I'm flying a B52 today okay I got a special Miss there is a lot of ammunition I need to drop so keep your seat belt stay tight if you want to holler amen say Amen everything will be okay we clear flight attended prepare for take off let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father we thank you for your grace for your love for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us Lord this is as far as I can go as human being with the ability that you have given me but when it comes to speak to your people to interpret your word it is not a work of a man it takes only the Holy Spirit to do it Lord may you be the one Speaking the one listening the one hearing the one interpreting the one translating Lord father May me and the audience move completely out of the way but may your blessing come down in a special way upon this church we seal the devil completely out in his army father May the Holy Spirit and the elect Angel only stay in this building Lord to minister to your children we commit everything unto their hand in the name of Jesus Christ amen Psalm 82 verse one the Bible says that God now we clear with this scripture now stands in the congregation of the mighty you might be seated and he God you remember last Sunday he's the judge amen he God judges among the gods so God is among Gods amen remember on on the short sermon that we have on uh on the wedding day we found out that when he comes to the term that God have to make men he say let us not let me make Men Let us make men in our own image amen are you the one starting I was trying to move on Amen we know that there was a light and I gave you the scripture in Timothy and in Psalm 1004 the bible say that God cover himself with light as a garment amen when this light was speaking in Genesis this light only say God say God singular say and he didn't say little God he say God like this and God sa and God made and God called and everything amen and everything that was creating was not in the image of God because an elephant doesn't look like God Amen animal don't look like God that's why I'm say God doesn't even enter animal that's what he said if you need a coat you see me my friend that's what he said God doesn't look like a bird the Holy Spirit took on the form like a bird amen but God is not a bird God look like this he looks like a human being amen amen so when he was creating everything he said God say God say God say Let There be this this but when he comes to man because man was a complete reflection of God man was made in the image and the likeness of God because when he was creating everything was male and female male and female but when it comes to man he said let us break it down so at that point we understand that God the God that was creating was not alone that's right he was not a him but a US you want to read it in the Bible or we so this God was a as so there was God and somebody else but the Bible say in the beginning was the word amen and the Word was with God and the Word was God so the ass is not only God but the as is also the word amen and everything that existed was created by this being but this being was not alone he was us and he created a man in his own image and man came up as a male and what meaning that in this entity of us we also have a male and a female and both of them are God yes sir the male God is right here it's the man Jesus Christ and the female God because it's a multiplication are called the gods and because he was the creation started by this entity right here that's why children of God have the ability to create amen so God Is Not the Only Creator God and his children create [Applause] amen amen amen a baby a baby a girl has the ability of a mother even though she's a baby everything that Mama has is already there but he still dormant he only take the process of time until he reach a certain maturity then mama will be expressed that's the same thing that happened to you you are gods and all he was taking was time in the process of time when time will come the godship in you will Express itself that's why Jesus said when you say to this mountain not him but when you say because you our gods are we together are we together you're doing good right now so I'm so happy let's go to verse seven my friend glory to God Amen if you thereare you can say amen amen jum to verse six I'm sorry he say I have said who's talking who's talking who's talking God who's talking God which report would you believe yes sir yes sir I'm asking you a question which report will you believe as for me and my house we shall believe the report of the Lord and the report of the Lord say ye are [Applause] God and all of you are children of the most high [Applause] we found out those record right those report amen those records amen we got a Divine One amen amen and we got an Earthly one amen the Divine is clean and the Divine is powerful because the Divine speak of our deity that's right amen and this one shows our failure our flaws but they the flaws of Grace are we together he says but verse seven you shall die like what and fall like one of the what Prin in other word God is telling you even though you're going to go through fall through difficulty through trial just remember you are God in other word do not let the circumstances of your Earthly Journey amen blur who you truly [Applause] are amen even if you fall it's a God that have fallen [Laughter] come on brother Elijah come on come on right here come on glory to God who is this brother Elijah what is he doing here he's standing it's Elijah standing right sit down my friend it's Elijah sitting it's still Elijah amen he just change position but it's still Elijah can you sit on the ground it's still Elijah amen so sitting on the floor on the chair or standing doesn't change his nature it doesn't change who he is he's still Elijah thank you my friend so your fa doesn't change the fact that you are [Applause] God your fall is a fall of God that's why to rescue you you need a God Not a Human Being Only God Can rescue [Applause] God you see the 18 wheeler truck that carry stuff from one state to another if one break down have you seen the truck that tow them sir he look like them you cannot take a small Towing in Tru to to that one so if you in trouble to to you you need something that look like you only God can thow [Laughter] God are we together you are Gods my friend whether you like it or not ye are gods and my report is the report of the Lord and that report say you are [Applause] Gods let's go to Luke 15 Oh Glory to God it's getting juicy here amen glory glory glory Luke 15 we read this scripture for more than two month and every time we read something new we read something new because it's the power of the seals amen put your seat belt my friend yes you there amen let's go to verse 11 let's pick up from there then we see how far we can go amen am Oh Glory to God you there nobody have to fall changed from a human being to a chicken You always remain a human being you already me amen you don't change because you fell and then you become a goat you're still a human being amen and if God Falls and usually God doesn't fail God fell voluntarily he himself laid [Applause] down don't worry my friend Luke 15:1 if you dare you can say amen amen the Bible say and he said a certain man has two sons you remember this now now we are clear with who are these two sons right what is the first one the Jews Israel we already established this my friend and the second one is what Gentiles gentiles amen this is where he's pulling his brde amen two sons Israel is the elder it's written in verse 31 and this is the younger that's how the scripture called them amen amen in other words it's going to be born later on the Bible says a certain man had two sons amen and the younger of them say to his father father give me the portion of good that falls to me amen remember father is not dead yet right this boy is asking for inheritance before death amen because normally the father must die I already gave you the scripture we went through this you only receive the will is enforced only at the death of the one who made the will that's what Paul say but this boy doesn't wait for the death no and we describe him as the Roman Centurion you remember that one you remember they don't wait for the Gentile time and the SAR phenician woman amen they didn't wait for Jesus to die and go to the Gentile to receive what they needed when Jesus was alive they approached Jesus Christ and Jesus say I'm not sent to you I'm sent to Israel that's not their problem they poke the door they open open the door and got what they needed and both of them receed something without a touch both of them Jesus never lay on anyone never lay hand on anyone he came by the spoken word and Jesus said that top of faith is never in Israel amen and the younger one which is a top of the Gentile right here is asking for an inheritance before even father is dead and we know that according to the to the book of Deuteronomy the Elder only get a double portion you remember that one I gave you the scripture last Sunday and the younger one get a third amen the Bible says amen verse 12 and the younger of them said to his father father give me a portion of the goods that fall to me and he divided to them his what living so the remaining of the living remember he belongs to the elder brother we clear he belongs to the Jews but watch what's going to happen amen verse 13 and not many days after after the younger son gather all together and took his journey into a what a far country he went into a far country let me make sure I got the scripture correct he went into a far country amen so he was far away from the father amen so the one who was closer to the father is the elder the son was far away and over there he got himself in trouble verse uh 13 and not many days after that the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riers living and we found out that he was among harlots it's written in the Bible right there my friend if you jump down down to verse uh I'm trying to do this to save somebody so we can pick you up before I go I move far amen it is uh written um verse 30 yes verse 30 it's right there on verse 30 he destroy his inheritance with the Harlot amen now Backle up and let's go amen glory to God the Bible says this in the book of Exodus 4: 22 and thou shall say unto Pharaoh amen thus sayth the Lord Israel is my son we clear even my who my firstborn so the firstborn are the Jews and brother Bram in the revelation of Jesus Christ he say what from the Jews come on which are what the oldest the oldest and the what the first the first chosen of God through the cross come the blessing back to what the Gentiles so the cross took the blessing of the Jews and bring that back to the Gentile as we saw Jacob crossing the hand before the children of Joseph and brother brother say to get the bread blessing come through the cross from the Jew to the Gentile rejected they rejected the cross therefore he got the Gentile bread everybody clear so far and then in Ephesians chapter 2: 10 the Bible say for we are his workmanship you understand this now created in Christ not by Christ not outside of Christ we were created in Christ am remember at the beginning we were already in the eyes right here somebody also live with God in Christ are we together he said unto good works which God has before ordained that we should walk in them this work you don't do anything to them amen these work are ordained or pred destinated for you you automatically will do it all it takes is for that record to be activated amen all it takes for a young girls is for her to reach a teenage then the package that was in her begin to unfold amen are we together that package was there until the time of love we already went to this in the hotel my friend and when the time come then everything is triggered and then the system begin to work are we together Paul continue he say which he has ordained that we should walk in them according to John 15:1 16 the Bible say ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordain you that ye should go and bring forth what fruit so these fruits are ordained that your fruit should What Remain that whatsoever he ask of the father in my name he may do What give it to you what you ask of the father I'm reading the Bible what you ask where of the father in what in my name it belongs to who to you it belongs to you he may give it to you and Paul continue in verse 11 he said wherefore remember that ye being in time P to who gentille In the Flesh remember In the Flesh amen who are called on circumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by what because the Jews were circumstan and not the Gentile verse 12 that at that time ye were without Christ we were far away being alien in another country far away from the Commonwealth of Israel come on and stranger from the Covenant of Promise having no hope like the younger child and with God in the world but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometime were where far off remember the younger boy went to a far away country are we together we who are some come far off and made nigh by the blood of who Christ so it takes the blood to bring us back again to God are we together glory to God brother Bram says this in the deity of Jesus Christ he said now there is a picture of the Gentile Church coming into Christ because we were once aliens away from God only the Jews was the one to be saved but we being dead in Christ take on what Abraham's seed and our air according to the promise and Christ got a gentile bre that is exactly right so this father doesn't deal with one child but he's dealing with two sons one are the Jews and the other one are the gentille Paul in Romans 3: 29 and 30 says is is he the god of the Jews only is he not also the of the Gentile and Paul answer he say yes of the Gentile also seeing it is one Goden which shall justify the circumcision the Jews by faith and the uncircumcision the Gentile through faith are we together but the problem is this in Roman 9:30 Paul say what shall we say then that the Gentile which follow not after righteousness we were not looking for God we were running away from God we were running away from the father we pack everything and went away from the father and live a promiscous life amen which follow not after righteousness have attain to righteousness in other word the one who was not even caring for it Hallelujah the one who was not even looking for it is the one who found [Applause] it don't worry my friend he says which follow not after righteousness have attend to what righteousness even the righteousness which is of what faith so the way we attain in righteousness is by faith are we together hold on my friend but Israel which follow after the law of righteousness they had the law they were living by the law the old the son that say that I follow all your commandment jum to the Bible so we can get this clear my friend jum to verse 29 the Bible say and he answered say to his father what L these many years do I what serve thee who was serving God the Jews or the Gentiles the Jews okay neither transgress I at any time your commandment and yet you never gave me a kid that I may make Mary with my friends keep that in mind amen remember even the Rich Young Ruler he follow everything to the letter but he miss eternal life amen why did he miss eternal life the Bible says that Israel which follow after the law of righteousness has not attained to the law of righteousness wherefore in other word why because they s it not by what faith but as he were a what by The Works of the law for they stumble and The Stumbling what stone Israel thought with what they doing they will be entitled to receive righteousness let's go to the Book of Romans keep your finger where we are let's go to Romans so we can drive this my friend we moving very good it's going to kill the legalistic amen let's go to Roman 4 my friend it's a B52 amen after a while you will begin to hear bomb dropping left and right amen Roman 4 if you dare you can say amen amen Roman 4 let's start by verse two the Bible say for if we clear If Abraham were just jusy by works he has wherefore to do what to glory in other word he can glory and say you know what I did this that's the reason why I got this amen I work over time that's the reason why I got a pay so my pay goes with over time the more I work the more I get paid amen If Abraham receive it that way he would have Glory the Bible says for Abraham were just for If Abraham were justified by works he has wherefore whereof to Glory but not before who God God doesn't want you to Glory before him let continue my friend verse three for what says the scripture Abraham beli God not did something for God sir he was based on faith amen Abraham just believe not do anything just believe only believe he believe God Amen and he was counted to him for what righteous so as soon as he believ God Associated righteousness with Abraham so that Faith doesn't have anything about what you have done that's why the Bible say before the children were born even have not done good good and evil God say I love Jacob and when Jacob came he was doing bad works so if you go by words you're going to disqualify Jacob and qualify Esau but God was not looking at Works he was looking at Faith are we together are we together verse four now to him that works amen Amen to him that clock in and out to him that work is the reward not Recon of what gra but of what if you work they don't pay you you go back to the supervisor you say I need my paycheck because it they owe you for what you work God doesn't want it like that amen God give it to you when you didn't do anything amen so that everything you receive is Grace but not on work amen are we together amen are we together there is nothing that the young man have done to deserve a best robe actually he messed up he took the inheritance of the father and destroy it he deserved the bad robe but Grace provided the best robe so that child can never boast that I was a good child and that the reason why I'm wearing a best robe the older child can do that he said father I followed you I serve you I did everything I never broken your commandment therefore I deserve a best robe that's now the way he works with God the best Rob goes to the [Applause] worst those that were ad worship the Gentile we are the one receiving the best robe and the Jews who follow after the law and walking after the law and doing everything even the diet was according to the law we were eating pigs but praise be to God with my pop chop I receive what the Jews [Applause] do are we together my friend are we together this type of uh sermon you the seed of the devil I'm helping you to go to hell quickly amen the seed of the devil will say so let me go sin now are you going to hell quickly the seed of God say if the Lord love me so much like this why should I see why should I betray somebody like this why should I betray a husband that love me so much he giving me everything when I didn't even ask him I found a bouquet I found a new car I found a new dress a husband like that oh I will fish for him I will fish first and cook for him because he's everything to me amen amen where are we at my friend verse four verse four amen the Bible says for now to him that works is a reward not Reon of what Grace but of what but to him that works not are we I'm reading the Bible amen you fight you fight the scripture amen but to him that work not but does what believe it on him that's why brother Bram said the the the the the song only believe the angel of the Lord LED that song only believe believe what all things are possible only [Applause] believe are we together are we together he says but for to him that works not but do what believeth on him Believing on him that do what justify not just believing of him You Must Believe on him that justifies in other word You Must Believe on the justif because to justify means you have done something guilty first and then you need a justifier to expande you so that he can remove the record and bring you like you never done it I'm going to shock you but I don't have any choice the Elder son say father I followed you I serve you I follow every commandment off you and I never broken what one do you justify somebody like that what does he need justification for and I told you I'm going to shock you what does he need justification for because he's guilty of nothing you justify the guilty [Music] oh goodness I was guilty that's the one you justify it's the one that have meres but God said that you are God and I know that you're going to get in trouble and because you're going to have failure I must present myself as the justifier the justifier was a reserve to remove the unclean [Applause] record are we together are we together don't worry my friend where am I at verse 5 verse 5 but to him that work not but believe on him that does what justify the you just believe on him that justifi the what ungodly not The Godly when Jesus came he told the Pharisee he said you say you heal yeah me I didn't come for those who are healed I came for those who are sick and because you say you heal you will die on your sin are we together he justifies not The Godly because The Godly have nothing to be justified he's justifying the ungodly amen amen so this medication work when you ungodly when you ungodly that's when the medication is very effective don't worry my friend he says who justify the what ungodly his faith not his work his faith is counted for what righteous that's why when we give our life to Jesus Christ we need to understand what we are doing if not the devil will hunt you to keep reminding you of everything you in your life so when we call people in the altar we need to know what we doing in this message that's why young people keep struggling go back to the altar go back to the altar because of improper teaching when you come to the altar to give your life to Jesus Christ make sure you pack everything don't leave nothing pack everything what you need 1947 packet come with that big trash can and stop right there and you use one Faith to kill [Applause] everything do you follow me do you follow me and when the devil come you say hey you didn't remember that day you want to find your your your your stuff go back to the altar you going to find it there I pack it everything and I put it together God have seven name of compound name Jehovah jar Jehovah ni how many God are we going to pray to when there is only one God God made us a favor he took Jehovah Jara put him in the basket and he took Jehovah n and put him there and mix and took Jehovah Chen and mix it together and came up with one name which is the name of Jesus Christ and when I use Jesus Christ I got the full package [Applause] Jesus Jesus is a medication when he enter in he begin to search if it's a problem he moved to Jehovah oh Jehovah shalom it's just one pill that you put on your body and that's forever everything is taken care of because everything is wrapped up in one name that's why they never say John the Baptist I pray for you in Jesus name move from your mother womb uhuh they just say Jesus Jesus and Jesus came and examined the situation and said this situation need a resurrection because his life he provided life and today he's going to go to your problem individ joury and found what is g and provided [Applause] everything are we together I hear Pentecost of people you need to pray you need to pray you need to pray you me to

heart amen even as David also did what describeth the blessedness of the blessedness of a man to whom God what imputeth righteousness without what work in other word David look and say ah you are blessed Israel have to suffer every day a cow a sheep sheep you you don't kill nothing you don't need a sheep for your sin to be forgiven and David look he say ah I wish I was like you Gentile because

God does what imputeth righteousness he does God transfer credit righteousness without what words saying what blessed are they whose iniquity whose iniquity are what forgiven and whose sin are what are covered blessed is the man to whom the Lord will what not impute sin so there are men that God cannot credit sin [Applause] amen you remember that Sunday when you sin your sin goes to the devil he can get all the credit he want for it but when they bring it to you they cannot associate you with sin because you got a clean record amen who can convince me of sin who can charge God's elect it is

coming down off the constellation and going to the marriage there is a period of time hallah but the shout is already delivered the voice is already delivered the Trump is already delivered but the Fulfillment of the Trump will take [Music] time if I lost you again raise your hand are we together are we together because they must kill the C and they must cook it boil it and spice it and everything put a medium rare rare well done and everything and put it right there amen so there is a period of time when that son is probably telling the story of redemption [Applause] maybe we he's with Mama he said Mama you don't know what I went through but they're still cooking over there until they started are we together are we together I'm going to start getting on my sermon now are we together are we together if you notice the oldest son is not home now I'm getting into my message Hallelujah now I'm getting into my message now I begin to get into my message if you fool you let me know because I can't drop this material like this are we together are we together are we together so how do we know amen there is a period of time amen between the meeting of the father amen and the feast because the feast need to be prepared amen but the instru of the feast the instruction of the feast was already given at the meeting at the appearing of the father amen but the Fulfillment of the feast will take place a little bit later so how do I know that I'm getting closer to go to the table to eat I am Sovereign hallelujah amen and I don't have a bishop yes because every church is Sovereign amen and I'm talking to this church amen put your seat belt amen when the election went Shake somebody wake everybody who I'm sorry you reach a point of no return so I have to go with the flight amen when the election started how many were there when I preached the vision in the hotel how many were there how many were there I got this I I got the message and I was advised to remove the message because he was very sensitive and it could cause trouble that's why I remove it but I still have the copy of the message amen I preached that message when Camala and Joe Biden were elected how many remember that how many remember that and I show that there were two prophecies amen the first prophecy brother Bram say we have a Catholic President and we will have another one so Joe Biden Jo [Laughter] [Applause] Biden Jo Biden fulfill that prophecy are we together are we together and the second prophecy because Joe Biden was a Catholic President which was reflecting John Kennedy [Applause] and brother say when Kennedy enter it was the Catholic Church behind [Applause] him are we together are we together then at the same time not a different time a woman appear a pretty woman well dressed but cruel in the heart because she love killing [Applause] babies I'm flying a B52 I'm flying a B52 I'm flying a B52 she want to deform our children to make them homosexual when the image and the likeness of God is male and female I'm flying a B52 my friend it is moving like are we together are we together and when she appear follow me carefully she was dressed how in purple in purple amen and by origin she's half Indian and brother brand also was half Indian [Applause] it's a B52 my friend are we together and then she'll dress in in purer and fulfill another prophecy brother brother say a president or a vice president a president or a what vice president I'm saying this because people in the message love debate at this time they are debating debating debating as a Shepherd let me stabilize my [Applause] [Music] church are we together are we together brother Micky we together ah brother Mick is saying it's already fulfilled so he's on board ah can I continue he said a president of what oh Vice what question why did Brother say president or what president because the two prophecy came in Sandwich one already took the office of a president which office is left so what do you expect Cala to pick I I hope it's soing the President office was already picked fulfilling a prophecy and the vice president and office is picked by who by who wearing what amen listen to brother Bram hold on my I can't go back even if you want I can't go back brother Bram say now this what prophecy of course like what all other prophecy how many prophecy has a what a compound meaning a prophecy sometime has a what meaning then he has a what a spiritual meaning how many times brother Bram say it's going to be a woman or the Catholic Church why do we argue a court don't fight another [Applause] court if two court cannot come together leave them alone maybe you're not the person to preach it you will confuse God children [Music] [Applause] are we together are we together are we together so in the natural realm amen Cala displayed the Catholic Church follow me because in Revelation 17 amen the Catholic church in Revelation 17 were the purple are we together and brother Bram say be careful of the purple [Applause] curtain amen but Pastor you were purple today I have a [Applause] message there is two side to col did this purposely brother Bram say red is a color of danger and brother Bram say red is also a color of redemption it depends on how you are [Applause] applying are we together are we together if purple represent the Catholic Church do we have another interpretation of yes we do hold on my friend yes we do hold on my friend let me read this then I get you my friend brother Bram saying he said now any what Bible reader he knows what that all scripture has a compound meaning and every what prophecy some or what most all of it has a what a dual time there a oh my he Oh Glory to God a what a do a time there or what two time more that it shall be what answer as a what revolving of History so it should be a woman and a Catholic church it's a do in Prophecy but what is purple glory to God brother Bram say now when this boy became of age and when he was ready then his ready then what for his adoption and he had proved by the children had T the father that this boy was what eligible for adoption eligible for what adoption eligible for what adoption he was taken out where into a public place and there he was what Rob with a Rob on a perhaps what purple [Applause] brother Steven brother BR I'm say perhaps I know how I deal with message believer let me nail you Hallelujah in the message at that word brother say back go ahead my friend when the boy proved to be a right boy uhuh and the tutor uhhuh which in our case is the holy spirit continue that takes word to the father and gives a report of what we do then if we be found faithful for so long like a child was then he was what taken out in the public square and a what a purple Road was put was what put on him and there was a law of what adoption purple is the color of [Applause] adoption a color of adoption [Applause] not only a color of the Catholic church but a color of what adoption are we together are we together are we together let me ask you a question wow are we together are we together which number was President Biden in the President List can I raise this I'm flying a B52 my friend the people in the message argue argue argue that Prophecy of the woman rising up was already fulfilled by Cala showing you in the natur that the Catholic Church have entered into a cabinet so what you see naturally have a meaning spiritually Cal is an indicator that behind here jazeel is already there that's why the president is a Catholic Jo Biden a Catholic it's a prophecy fulfilled and people in the message are waiting Kamal is going to be now the president Kamal is going to be the president and she's going to fulfill the prophecy the prophecy was already fulfilled and guess what Cala didn't win where are you now [Applause] if you need the message I have the message kept it was like three or four years ago when I preached that that that prophecy was fulfilled and the people were waiting for president Cala didn't pass what are you going to do and who pass again who who pass again who pass again follow me carefully I'm only a B52 before Biden who
