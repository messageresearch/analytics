morning do you love him today amen we greet you in the name of the lord if you have your bibles this morning while you're standing you can be turning with us to the book of psalms of the 16th chapter and while you're turning there this morning we sure want to say god bless you and we sure counted an honor and a privilege to be here with you this morning and i thank the lord for the word of god and the message of the hour in this generation amen be identified with this word and we sure thank the lord for what he's done here and for the church here we say god bless you this morning the pastor brother stephen we sure appreciate the invitation to come and be with you this morning a kind of an interesting way when brother stephen asked us to come we was actually on our way home several months ago from south carolina and got about gastonia here and stopped to get a room and i actually stopped here at this hotel and i was upstairs that morning and i woke up and had a text from brother stephen did it go off that turned myself off can you hear me okay we stopped to get a room up there and i woke up and had a text i didn't know the number but it was from brother steve and he said we'd like to have you come minister for some time and then my wife had told me uh the next morning that's the place they're having church here in this hotel so i tell you the lord he works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform and we do thank the lord this morning for what god has done here for you and just before we read the word can we buy our hearts together this morning for a word of prayer and just ask the lord to come and to speak to us in a supernatural way heavenly father lord as you believe in children have gathered themselves together here this morning father as believers we know that you come where you are invited but lord you'll only stay where you're made welcome and lord i believe there's been a lot of effort put in this morning to invite you here lord of building has been set aside and been consecrated to you for a place that your children could come and meet and lord to hear lord the word that you have sent in this hour now father i pray this morning that we would make you welcome lord i pray that you would just come in this place today father may you overshadow us with your mercies overshadow us with your grace lord i pray for those this morning that would be discouraged lord would need an encouragement this morning i pray lord you would send the angels of god into this building this morning father as we have sung the songs of zion lord we know that an atmosphere is so important lord i believe that there is an atmosphere here this morning lord i believe there is a charged atmosphere now lord as we take your word this morning i pray that you would send lord the spirit of god in the building today lord may you help us to get ourselves out of the way help us to move ourselves aside father and lord if there would be one spirit lord that would be hanging on your people or one spirit you would be trying to hinder lord this meeting one attitude father one thing o god that would not be pleasing to you i pray this morning lord that you would derive it out of the building lord and may liberty come father lord may power come may rejoice and come in the hearts of your children for those who would be sick this morning i pray you would said healing to him lord for those who would be bound i pray you would send deliverance to him god father for those o god that would not have the baptism of the holy ghost i pray this morning lord that you would send the holy ghost into their souls this morning father for those who would be getting cold or into a into a formal or dry condition i pray this morning god that you would send a refreshing from the presence of god and lord may revival fire burst in every heart and every life this morning and lord we'll be sure to stand back and give you all the praise and all the glory and all the honor for it's in the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believers said amen and amen and may god bless you this one in the book of psalms the 16th chapter and we want to look here in the fifth verse david here writing says the lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup and thou maintaineth my lot david says thy lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places yea i have a goodly heritage amen my my the lines are falling into me in pleasant places yay i have a goodly heritage in the book of matthew the third chapter i have a few places i'd like to read this morning if that'd be okay in matthew the third chapter and we want to look in the 10th verse matthew chapter 3 and verse 10. there's there's one thing we have learned that when the devil fights god's got a blessing amen in matthew the third chapter in the tenth verse the bible here says now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees therefore every tree which bringeth forth not good fruit is shown down and cast into the fire i indeed baptize you with water under repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear for he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand he will thoroughly purge his floor gather his wheat into the gardener but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire and then cometh jesus from galilee unto john to be baptized of him but john forbade him saying i have need to baptize of thee to be baptized of thee and cometh now to me and jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now for thus i love this for thus it becometh us let's say that together it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him jesus which he was baptized went up straight way out of the water and lo the heavens were open unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending amen out of heaven the heavens were opened a spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him and low a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased the rem says or whom i'm pleased to dwell in and if we could look at one more place this morning in ephesians chapter six i have a few readings here on my heart this morning but i trust that's okay in ephesians this chapter ephesians the sixth chapter and i want to look in the 13th verse a very very familiar scripture here this morning ephesians 6 and verse 13 paul here writing he's dressing the christian soldier how many soldiers have we got here today paul dressing the christian soldier he says wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day the man picks this up and says that's this day having done all to stand stand therefore having done all to stand just stand there for having your loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness amen we ask the lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you may have your seats here this morning for just a few moments from those scriptures i would like to by the help of the lord just to speak to you here and if i would title this today i want to talk to you for a few moments on it becometh us to stand it becometh us to stand and here in the book of ephesians the sixth chapter paul they're writing he says now wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand he says stand therefore now you look at that word stand it actually means to set to establish to stand still it means to be to stand by to set up in the presence of others in the midst before judges before members of the sanhedrin to place wherever but you're going to stand to uphold or to sustain authority or force of something now another place it means to stand in movable amen to stand firm it says speaking of the foundation of a building it means to stand safe and sound now i love this one it means to be of a steadfast mind amen it means of equality and another one it means of one who does not hesitate amen or one who does not waver now amen to think today that we have all heard the same amen if you don't stand for something then you will fall for anything we've all we've all heard that and it's really a reality in this hour that if you don't stand for something amen then you'll fall for anything and to think today in the world there are actually two positions that the people are in today and then they'll find themselves either standing or they will find themselves bowing they will either find themselves standing amen for something and against something amen and having a backbone not to move from it amen or they'll just give into the pressure and they'll bow down and they'll hesitate and they'll waver amen but i don't believe i'm speaking to a bunch of wavering people this morning and then i don't believe i'm talking to a people amen that is hesitant about what they believe that is that it's got questions about what they believe and i believe with all of my heart this morning amen that there are believers here today amen amen there are holy ghost believers here amen that are not bowing to the pressures of this age but as a matter of fact amen they are standing upon the promises of god's word i i think of how today that this is amen this is not a church full of unbelievers amen this is not a group of name believers this morning but this is a group of experienced believers amen amen men and women and boys and girls it knows what it's like amen amen to stand against the devil to stand against the pressure amen to stand against spirits but to know amen that has come before you amen then who can be against you and to think this morning amen that there are experienced believers here that know what it's like to have to stand amen the bible said amen the prophet of god said the greatest experience i've ever had amen is to come up and get something that i couldn't get over it i couldn't get under it he said but just stand there amen and watch god make a way through it amen that's the way to do it just move he said keep moving press your nose against it just keep moving on and god will make a way amen see that is an experienced believer amen that knows when i can't get over it amen when i can't get around it when i can't get under it then the god that called me and it will come down on the scene and he will make a way and i'll go through it amen i don't know about you this morning but let me announce to you the time is at hand amen to make a stand and then the time is at hand to stand brother if you're never going to make a stand for god he says make it now this is the time and then now's the time we need it now is the time when the church has weighed in the balance and found morning after all these great miracles and signs and wonders that god has sent men across the country ain't been doing and yet the church is in the poorest condition and he said backslidden state i've ever run up in years that's right he said i'm preaching to the pentecostals now think of this and that a prophet of god is speaking amen to a pentecostal church and he's saying it's a poor it's a backslidden it's in a confusion amen but at the same time that a prophet is announcing the condition of that church he is calling a bride by the word oh to thank this morning church amen that we are not just a church amen we are not just a group of people amen but a prophet has called us the bride amen of jesus christ in the hour in which we're living amen the message of the hour didn't come to leave us in confusion it come to call us out it didn't come to give us questions it come to be the answer amen to every question the church would have and to think this morning that we are not here as a bunch of inexperienced people but we are here amen as the bride of jesus christ amen as the church amen that has made us stand against the confusion ah this this bride stand and then it's not marching up and down the streets holding signs and that this bride's stand is not going up and trying to change politics and change governments amen but the bride's stand is coming out of babylon into the revealed word of the hour of the age that she is living in i when i begin to think of this and i'll say it like this amen we stand for jesus christ amen we stand for jesus christ we stand for jesus christ and his righteousness amen says it this way he says i want to go on record in heaven tonight that in this audience here in this great city of chicago in this high school auditorium i want to go on record that i stand amen for jesus christ and his righteousness and i wonder if we could bring that here to gastonia this morning amen amen can we bring it right here in this building amen is there anybody here today that wants to go on record and say i stand for jesus christ i stand for his righteousness i stand for the holy ghost i stand for the supernatural i stand for the message of the hour amen i stand for the prophet of god i stand for the witness amen that jesus christ it's not dead but he's alive and he's here this morning and he's moving he meant by many signs many wonders and infallible proofs my to think this morning that we stand somebody look at somebody and say we stand amen we stand this morning we stand for jesus christ we stand for holiness we stand for righteousness we stand for purity we stand for the supernatural we stand for the manifestation of our holy ghost in this generation we stand for it this morning it's the power of the holy ghost and we stand for it ah to thank this morning we go on record today let it be known in heaven we stand let it be known on the earth we stand let it be known in hell we stand let it be known in the countries we stand amen for jesus christ ah we stand brother we stand for it it's who we are it's what we believe it's the reason we're breathing it's the reason we're here and we're not ashamed of it but we stand for jesus christ and then to think the problem of god would say it's going to take courage to make a stand my bible tells me in second peter chapter 1 verse 21 for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of god or by the will of man amen but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost and then see the holy men of god and then spoke as the holy ghost moved upon them remember says it this way courage god don't want cowards amen no he wants gallop men he says that's the kind that he has to move with it's not cowards amen but but but gal at men see it takes it takes men of god amen they've got to have courage by the holy spirit now think of this the bible says that men of god amen were moved by the holy ghost amen to write the word and that the word could not be written had the holy ghost not moved upon him but let's preach this morning amen the same holy ghost that moved upon them to write it it's the same holy ghost that's got to move upon the church amen to manifest what has been written then to think this morning the word is a fault expressed see so the prophet amen was waiting for god's thoughts and when god revealed his thoughts to him he expressed it in word as thus saith the lord see then the prophet's message is thus saith the lord amen amen a message coming from god is thus saith the lord see and when you receive the saith the lord then it releases a courage in you that those men could defy kingdoms and then they could defy church ages amen because they were bold why they were moved by the holy ghost see and that's why they become bold and then now let me say this morning church you say well but andrew if the holy ghost moves it's going to make me shout or if the holy ghost moves it's going to make me dance or if the holy ghost moves i'll i'll have some type of emotion amen that very well could be the truth amen but what we need today is more than an emotion and it is more than a sensation amen is more than a feeling amen but what we need is the holy ghost amen to move upon the church and to release a boldness in us like it released in the 120 in the upper room amen let that same holy ghost move in this church this morning and release the same boldness upon every believer here today [Applause] [Music] ah the holy ghost moves somebody say the holy ghost moved and then now what you notice here what happened is when the holy ghost moved it actually brought a transformation when the holy ghost moved it moved them amen from being a coward amen to being bold witnesses of god now think of this revelation romans 8 11 says amen if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead amen dwell in you he that raised the christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies see then the same quickening power that raised jesus from the dead is the same quickening power that filled the upper room and moved those 120 witnesses amen from being cowards to being bold sons and daughters of god it's the same holy ghost that is in this building this morning to move you from where your eyes ain't into where god wants you to go to ah the prophet said let's know this pentecost how they acted see amen if they were quickened by the quickening power that we're talking about on the day of pentecost they were all walking up there in themselves they were afraid the jews was just going to go amen they got scared but what happened when this quickening power fell from heaven amen remember it says there was a bravery that set in upon them when the quickening power removed from heaven into the upper room he meant a bravery came and he said a bravery sent in upon them he said there was something in it an understanding where they wasn't too sure of it amen a few hours before amen but they know he had died and then they know he had risen they had talked to him and then they had seen him but here on the day of pentecost they met the holy spirit and then the abstract fell upon the believers that made them a part of his resurrection it made him a part of his fellowship the holy spirit come and confirmed to them that they was already raised see because amen can i preach this morning because they were potentially raised amen from cowards to brave men that's a direct quote when the holy ghost fell and that it was a sign that when they were raised from being cowards to brave men he said then that's the same token to apply to the resurrection that if he was raised in you'll be raised now if you're raised now you'll be raised oh i'm trying to behave myself this morning but i don't know if you can see it or not but the holy ghost has come in this age amen to do more than just make us shout you want me to use this the holy ghost has come in this age to do more than just make us dance and run the isles but the holy ghost has come in this age amen to release a witnessing power upon the church now the prophet said this way he said and the quickening took place he said then they wasn't afraid to make a witness of the message he said see that they believed it and knowed it to be the truth see they had walked with the message they had talked to the message they had fellowship with the message which was jesus amen but they were still cowards but after pentecost when the holy ghost fell upon them they were no more just witnesses of flesh amen but there was something in them that was bearing witness with what they were walking with oh can i just take the breaks off and preach here this morning i believe i'm talking to some people today that you have walked to the message amen you have heard the message you have talked about the message you have claimed the message amen but something is moved in the depths of your soul that it's more than something you've walked with it's more than something you've talked about but the god of this message has come into your heart by the holy ghost and it has released the power in you to stand ah i'm persuaded to wonder amen the prophet god said if there's somebody amen that won't stand for jesus christ they won't stand for his word they won't stand for truth he said i'm afraid to say something fell on them but it wasn't the holy ghost [Music] he said now let me ask you are you a part of his resurrection amen or are you a worshiper of a bunch of creeds and then i'll see a worshiper of a bunch of creeds will fall amen they will bow they will give in at the least bit of pressure amen but somebody that is a part of his resurrection somebody that is a part of his resurrection will stand as a witness of the full word of god let me say it this way we don't just stand against something amen but we actually stand for amen there is a standing against and then then there is a standing four remember it says now remember that this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how the antichrist spirit would come in the church and defile it making it lukewarm amen formal and powerless it exposes satan amen revealing his works the attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is now notice here and not what she stands against amen but what she stands for amen see amen pentecost was standing against stuff they stood against hair they stood against pants they stood against television they stood against all kinds of things but when they refused to go on with the revealed word amen they lost the courage to stand and what they stood against has now come in their very ranks what they preached against they now say it's okay they meant because they didn't stand for nothing see you you can't just stand against something ain't that because there's no courage there's no power there's no anointing and just standing against something amen but when you stand for something then you're not drawing strength from something you're standing against amen but you're drawing strength from something you're standing for see i stand against sin but i don't draw strength from sin i stand for the faith of jesus christ that i draw strength from the faith of jesus christ i stand against denomination and i don't draw those streets from them but i stand for the message of the hour and i draw strength amen from what a prophet is taught in this generation ah the thing this morning that we can't just talk about what we stand against we've got to remember we stand for something amen we stand for something see that she can do amen the greater work seek not standing against something will not release the power to do the greater works but when you stand for something that releases the power to do the greater works my then i'll say this way the prophet said if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit amen discern and withstand they discern and withstand the antichrist spirit then satan will be powerless before her now do you catch something here there's actually two things you've got to do you've got to discern amen but then you've got to withstand and then you've got to discern but then you've got to withstand see that discerning is one thing amen but with standing is another you realize david is a prime example amen of a man who discerned and withstood my bible says in first samuel 17 26 that david spoke to the men that stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that killeth this philistine and taketh away the reproach from israel for who is this uncircumcised philistine that he should defy amen the armies of the living god see right there david discerned him and then david said he's a he's he's an uncircumcised philistine amen he's a he's a boaster without a brag amen he's a big old and can i just preach to you this morning he told me to make myself at home okay i'm just a country hillbilly amen he's a big old bag of wind amen but he ain't got no talk with him amen and david discerned him but david went a step further and said he took his staff in his hand and he chose him five smooth stones see david said something's got to be done about this amen and when he said that he discerned goliath amen but brother kelly when he walked over and he picked up five smooth stones amen he moved from just discerning amen to withstanding and he said this goliath amen this giant has got to fall and i say this morning church there's some giants in the land today there's some goliaths in the land today there's some voices in the land today that's got to fall but can i tell you what david's not here to do it amen since it's not here to do it amen then who is here today ain't meant to slay these uncircumcised blessings you are here today by the baptism of the holy ghost and fire that has come into you since you've been to pentecost you are here today to cut the devil's head off [Music] he has raised you up he has anointed you he has put a sword in your hand the pillar of fire has descended in this generation and it's not come ain't meant informalism and lukewarmness but it's coming power to withstand this enemy no i'm not a crazy man i'm a warrior this morning amen i'm not a crazy man i'm a fighter today ain't no devil gonna stop me ain't no never gonna set us up if we gotta fight by ourselves we'll gather in a hotel room and we'll sling rocks until every giant falls until every demon is defeated and the holy ghost amen has the right of way in the church to move the church to equip the church to heal the church to save the church oh somebody's got to cut his head off you've been anointed to do it david david's not coming back to do your job spoken word tabernacle god's not raising up david amen to cut goliath's head off he's raising a pew to do it ah amen to think this morning that he went over and got him five smooth stones amen the problem of god said david look down there and he saw goliath let's just study the day but he said goliath was down there miles away from david said he had body armor on all over he said david only had one place to hit you know david didn't have a big target he had one place to hit which was right above the head just a little hole there in the head armor just just one place brother marie said that rock could go amen but david knew if i'll just stand here and preach the message if i'll just stand here and stand for jesus christ if i'll just stand here and do my part and start swinging the slingshot and i'll just start swinging the slingshot then when i get ready i'll let that rock go and it was not up to david amen to get the rock to the giant it was up to god to get the rock to the child and if you'll just stand here and sling the slingshot if you'll just stand here and swing the promises of god if you'll just stand here and dig and untapped resources and find you some smooth stones and just start swinging them just start slinging them before long brother that old devil's gonna come down because god will not let his church be overcome ah the rest of them seen it now come on church amen can i preach to you this morning it took a david to step out and make a stand it took a david and then with some courage to say who is this uncircumcised philistine amen now listen church david didn't have no help amen david didn't have no support the whole army was against him amen but when they seen it could be done when they seen it could be done when they seen that that giant could come down when they seen that goliath would not overcome the church the prophet of god said it released the faith in the camp and the rest of them raised up and said if david did it then so can i and i don't know what you see in this message i don't know what you hear on those tapes but when i hear a prophet of god say satan in the name of jesus christ come out of the people for the glory of god i say if we and random said it then there's a bride on the earth today that can say the same thing by the same anointing by the same inspiration by the same power if david done it so can i if brother branham did it so can i if paul did it so can i if samson did it so can i if goliath come down so will depression come down so will complexes come down so will every devil that withstands the army of the living god oh somebody just give him some praise [Music] that giant's coming down church david's not here but you are amen sams is not here but you are amen goliath is here amen but there's a david here too my to thank david amen didn't have no support amen he didn't have no packing he didn't have nobody stand there saying david you can do it david you can do it as a matter of fact everybody was telling him not to do it everybody was telling me he was crazy everybody was telling me he lost his mind but the difference in david was amen that the spirit of christ was upon david and david said this falls my lot it becometh me to take this goliath down my to think that's the same man amen that wrote in psalm 16 and said the lord is the portion of mind and heritage and of my cup david said thou maintaineth my lot see what david is saying here is the lord he is my portion amen the lord is my portion now when you look at that word portion you'll find the word portion actually means territory so what david here is saying is the lord is my territory amen another place what he's saying is he is all i have and because of him all i have i have see amen he is all i have and all i have is because of him see david knew that a man didn't give it to him oh god can i preach this morning amen david knew that a man didn't do it for him david knew that if i've got it the only reason i've got it is because the lord was on my side if the only reason i've got it it's not because of who i am it's not because of how i preach it's not because how good i can sing if i've got anything it's because the lord done it i'll tell you spoken word tabernacle if there's a reason why this church is here it's nothing you've done it's nothing a man done but what the lord has done and it is marvelous in our sight david said look here you all can sit there and make fun of if you want to but i can't sit still because the lord gave this to me see the lord give me my family amen the lord give me my church amen the lord give me my joy and then the lord give me my peace the lord give me my anointing the lord give me my revelation amen the lord give me my understanding everything i have is because of him and because of him i have everything i need oh glory to god now i'm just going to tell you david wasn't a coward neither david was a brave man david was a warrior he didn't look like a warrior but he was a warrior and you know what david did brother clean but they went out there and he said look this is mine this is mine this is mine this is mine this is mine spoken words is the original seed this is mine why we are not the denomination this is mine things that are to be this is mine the rapture this is mine future home this is mine seven seals this is mine first pool this is mine second pool this is my third pool this is mine theophany this is mine sunset mountain this is mine sabino canyon this is mine oh glory to god david said everything i have is because of the lord brother stephen david went out there and he marked off his territory he said listen i'm not going to patch you you can do what you want to do over there but when you step on this when you step on this territory you're not stepping on my territory you're not stepping on a church's territory if you step on this you're stepping on the lord's territory amen because i didn't do this amen a preacher didn't do this amen but jesus christ the son of god amen give me this territory he give me this ah david said listen amen as long as you stay over there there'll be no fight amen but when you cross the line amen when you get on what god give me that i am under obligation to fight for it are you hearing me i am under an anointing amen to protect what my father gave me and i'll just tell you this amen the three hebrew boys were good boys until you touched the message amen daniel was a good boy until you crossed him on the message and we're a nice church until you cross us on the message of the hour and there's a fight raises up because we were born for this this is our territory are y'all hearing me the reason we're in church with our family is because of this message the reason we've got our right mind is because of this message the reason we're not strung out on dope is because of this message then if you touch this you've touched the lord ah the lord the lord is my portion i'll fight for my lord i'll stand for my there's some people here this morning if you had to stand by yourself you would stand because you know all i have come from the lord the lord is my portion now y'all hear me this way you say but andrew you're just up there preaching because somebody talked to you no you're looking at a 24 year old boy this morning that had everything against him i didn't have a home life i didn't have much aim in broken homes aiming all kinds of things but the reason i'm here this morning is because i heard amen an eagle scream and out of that voice amen released an overcomer on the inside of me and that same voice is here this morning it's not here to scare you it's not here to condemn you it's here to remind you the only reason why you're here is because of the lord david said goliath can stand down there and do what he wants to but to mean it he defies my god is the man and he steps on my territory it's the minute i draw my sword oh it's a spiritual warfare it's not a flesh and blood battle it's a spiritual warfare it's a warfare going on in other realms you don't even know about but david never lost this the lord is my portion when he saw the bear the lord is my portion when he saw goliath the lord is my portion what i like about this is he says the lord is my portion therefore saith the lord will i hope in him now do you remember we we really can't talk about portion aim without speaking about oral roberts remember that when brother brown came out of oral roberts university and he saw all that nice stuff in the office and he saw them big old hands and that marble desk he saw all kinds of nice stuff and the product of god said he looked at that and he said lord he said that man's ministry came off of mine he said maybe you can't trust me with this he said but then a voice come and a voice it but look up see but look up he said then i looked up and he said the same voice said i am your portion i am your territory i am your boundary i am your lot amen i am your portion now brother brother stephen something struck me the other day is brother banham stood there and he looked at oral roberts university and he saw that beautiful building he saw all that nice stuff and he said lord maybe you can't trust me this he said now see what an inheritance is is actually a portion see it's an inheritance now notice here amen remember i said i looked there and i said god maybe you can't trust me with this he said but then all of a sudden the lord said look up amen for i am your portion now i want you to think about something amen because in just a few moments of time amen a fire could burn down or robert's building in in a few moments of time amen a flood could come through there and wash all them nice desk away in a few moments of time amen a tornadica strike and what was a beautiful building could be a rubbish heap in just a few moments of time see but a prophet of god said he told me to look up see oral robbers had an inheritance but it was a corruptible inheritance it was an inheritance it could burn away it was an inheritance that could wash away amen but william branham's inheritance was rosella griffin william branham's inheritance was hattie wright's two boys william branham's inheritance was an incorruptible inheritance and i come to tell you this morning church quit looking at corruptable inheritances in just a few moments of time it could be called amen but if you're laying up treasures on the other side amen if you're laying up treasures where thieves and rust and malls do not break through and steal amen that is an incorruptible inheritance oh we have an heritage it is a goodly heritage it is a spiritual heritage it is the word of god and for that we will stand we see whether you believe it or not we're actually this morning under divine instructions to stand in romans 12 1 paul said i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice amen holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service see be not conformed to this world amen to this corruptible inheritance amen but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is good acceptable and perfect will of god now that word beseech it means to encourage it means to instruct it means to move now remember the holy ghost moved them amen from cowards to being brave men amen the spirit of christ moved david amen from being just a shepherd boy into being a warrior amen and that same spirit of god actually paul comes and says has got to move the church amen said see we are transformed by the word now what does it mean to be transformed it means to be made different than what it was see it's been its character and everything has been changed see when the spirit of god moves oh my amen i'm just i'm just going to preach here today amen when the spirit of god moves it will literally transform amen something from chaos into beauty are you hearing me that same spirit i'm preaching about this morning brother i wish i had time to preach on the trail of the spirit amen we've heard about the troll of the serpent amen let's talk about the trail of the spirit here for a minute and then the same spirit that moved in genesis 1 is the same spirit that moved on the jordan river is the same spirit amen that moved in the upper room it's the same spirit amen that moved out of the grave amen into hell and led captivity captive it's the same spirit that ascended amen and gave gifts unto men is the same spirit amen that was on malachi 4 is the same spirit that went to luke 17 30. it's the same spirit that come to first thessalonians 4 is the same spirit that went to revelation 3 it's the same spirit that went to revelation 10 1. it's the same spirit with revelation 10 7. it's the same spirit that went back to revelation 5 and then come to revelation 22 and call a pride amen from this confusion back to the garden of eden oh brother i don't know if you know it or not but that didn't come from me that just came from him amen it's the same spirit and the same spirit that was there when adam and eve left the garden it's the same spirit that was in we invented when he said there's going to be a threefold purpose he's going to reveal himself he's going to take revelation by the preeminence and then by the preeminence of the revelation of himself he's going to lead amen a warrior he's going to lead an army he's going to lead a bride back to the garden of eden see it's the same spirit then the spirit that moved in genesis is the spirit that's moving here this morning that is here to transform us in proving his word 1964 he proves all of his words all of his words just think of it all of his words and you were his word are y'all hearing me and you were his word ah he was the word and you were a part of his word and that's the reason you're sent here you were there you was a part of it that's why you're here because you're a part of it if you were there you'll be here and if you're here you'll be there are y'all hear me this morning if you're a part of it but if you're not a part of it then you weren't there and if you weren't there you won't be here and if you aren't here you won't be back there but if you were back there then you're here this morning and if you're here this morning then you'll be over there on that great getting up morning ah devil get out of here we are not a bunch of hybrids we are not a bunch of cowards i don't know what you think about yourself this morning but if i was the devil i'd be scared to death right now amen because there's an anointing in this building that the devil don't stand a chance there's anointing in this building that says i'm a part of this it's who i am it's a gene on me inside of me are you hearing me see you're a part of it when you're a part of it you can't leave it when you're a part of it you cannot deny it you know what i heard robin say this morning upstairs in my room i heard him say this he said i could more easily deny myself than i could god because i'm a part of him see when you're a part of it it actually makes you happy when you're a part of it brother maurice it actually excites you when you're a part of it you can't sit in your seat when you're a part of it when you begin to hear it it begins to draw you it begins to pull you it begins to move it begins to lift you it begins to encourage you and i don't know about you this morning but when i hear this message it moves me it encourages me it stirs me it renews me it refreshes me oh but if you're not a part of it you'll argue with it you'll fuss with it but let me just go and tell you why you're arguing with it we're going to dance with it while you're arguing with it we're going to shout about it while you're confused by it we're going to rejoice in it because it's who we are [Music] are y'all hearing me it's who we are i'm a part of it brother you're a part of a young man you're a part of it this morning sister you're a part of it this morning brother you're a brother clean you're a part of it we preached in several meetings together i've seen you act this way in other churches you know why because you're a part of it you know what you put us in a roman catholic church and you read malachi 4 and we'll shout amen you put us in the devil's dungeon and you say god sent a prophet and we'll kick cut dust off the floor because we're part of it brother kelly you didn't get to where you're at this morning by just being a coward amen but you was a man of god amen that took a stand for this brother stephen you took a stand for this and you had to fight through devils amen but come on church we got some room this morning we're not in the shut this morning we got some shot room the seed has come back to seed again we're a part of it [Music] can i preach this morning we're a part of it you know when i when i me and my wife first got married one of the first trips we took down interstate 81 down through tennessee that's where i grew up i'm just gonna be honest with you where i grew up was in the hills of tennessee as i said before i'm just a country boy so forgive me okay amen i'm not very smart and i i got out of high school thank god for open book test but i made it out amen but but when we when first trip we went through there we drove down interstate 81. you know what i looked at my wife i said hey look there's that look over there there's that then we took a tour around you know we looked all these things and i was moved by you know why because i was a part of it i said look here honey and she wasn't rude she just looked at it and smile and said amen but it didn't move her like it moved me you know why because she didn't walk there i mean she didn't experience it amen she was only hearing my story she was only hearing what i had to say about it she was only here and why i why i why that place had any significance to me amen but you know why am i sisters how do you know why it moved me because i was a part of it i walked there amen i played there i talked there oh and there's some people today you can preach this message and it won't move them a bit more than the fuzz off of a peach but there's some other people when you begin talking about sabino canyon when you begin talking about colorado storms when you begin talking and then about three pools and a little fish getting its life back again when you begin talking about seven angels picking up william branham in a consolation and saying go back and open them seven seals when you begin talking about a sword appearing out of the invisible into the visible realm when you begin talking about it it begins to move something in you know why because they're a part of it we're a part of this word we're a part of this ah that's the reason why we're here is because we're a part of it he said and if you're here you're here to confirm your place in life [Music] [Applause] [Music] belander what's wrong with you melanie why are you up there swinging a wide handkerchief through the air let me just let you in a little secret okay i heard a proud of god the other day he said right now he said their souls getting saved he said demons are getting defeated sicknesses are being healed and he said right here in this building i see the devil waving his black flag of defeat he said but at the same time in heaven i see the angels of god and they're waving the white flags of victory [Music] they're waving the white flags of victory he and now let me just say this if the angels amen are so excited in heaven when they see a sinner get saved when they see a demon get defeated when they see a cancer leave a body when they see redemption come upon a part of god's body that they pick up white flags and they begin to wave them if the angels can rejoice at the victory that they're not even a part of they're not even receiving they're not even experiencing it then what about the redeemed sons and daughters of god this morning we're a part of it victory is not coming victory is here this morning redemption is not coming redemption is here this morning salvation is not coming salvation is here this morning oh ring it in the heavens let it be heard we got victory this morning the lord is our portion this is our inheritance i am redeemed i am sanctified i am justified i am holy ghost field i'm a message believer i'm a part of the bride [Music] oh i'm trying to get to my message but it become of us to stand we're a part of it any man would stand for his family because they're a part of him any father would stand for his children because they're a part of him any real husband would stand for their wife because she's a part of him we're a part of it quite a god said there will be a resurrection of the dead there'll be a rapture of the church there'll be a millennium there'll be a new heavens and a new earth and only the righteous will be there only the ones that's been made part of this word see will be their part and their position in this word for their age will be the only one will be there and that and what is a woman the image of a man what is the church the image of the word only the true believers in his word know this and can believe it see there's some that know it but they can't believe it there's some that's heard it but they can't believe it but why are you here this morning why do you still have joy in your heart because you believe it you're a part of it my see then the marriage is the oldest institution in the world today marriage was first established in the garden of eden now the plot of god said this now i know a lot of devils don't like this quote but i'm gonna read it anyhow if that's okay because i'm not a not a i don't i don't fear the devil you don't want me to read a quote i'll read it twice for it i study the other day brother maurice said something come to me said people's tired of hearing that quote but then you need to quit reading that and you know what i entertained that fault for a few minutes and then i realized no that's the devil tired of hearing it ain't the people tired of hearing it the devil's tired of hearing it amen but i'm going to read it for him that's all right he said now how he shall appear in the last days is to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband her mate the revealed word of the hour see that by that you are washed by the water of the word the prophet would say cleanse us this morning for this is our reasonable service see then what is a washing amen a washing is a bath and what does a bath do a bath separates you from the dirt that you're carrying and you don't carry it no more now let me just go and tell you you come in from work and you're all dirty and stinky and got stuff under your fingernails and and your wife's got a nice table prepared with some with some beautiful food and good and you want to go in there and sit down and say how about a bath first how about a shower for amen you know why because that dirt don't belong at the table you've got to be washed to that dirt then you sit at the table and that's why people don't want to fully preach this message it's because they still want their pentecostal dirt they still want their bad disturbance they still want their denominational dirt but you can't see it at the seven course meal of the king with the denominational dirt on you there's got to be a washing there's got to be a cleansing and i'll tell you what brother you'll step in the bath carrying the dirt but if it's a real water if it's a real clorox bleach if it's a real power of soap that dirt is not more powerful than the water that dirt will stay in the water and you'll walk out of there clean [Music] why are we shouting this morning because we were dirty brother we were filthy we stunk we were covered in all kinds of things but god sent a prophet with a word to lead us to the shower and say get in there and wash your godhead teachings wash your water baptism teachings wash your predestination teach it wash the evidence of the holy ghost teaching and get rid of all that dirt and come out clean our bath is the waters of separation am i holding too long our bath is the waters of separation see then why did jesus come to john and say john baptize me when john said i have need to be baptized of you but what it was was the example christ was putting forth is that a sacrifice has to be washed before service see then that example here goes back to the high priest that could not be anointed until he had been washed see they go you can read that i want to read it for the sake of time but you can read it in exodus 29 how that aaron the high priest before he could ever be anointed he had to be washed with water so the bible said jesus was anointed with the holy ghost and went about doing good things see in this morning church we are not going to be kings we are not going to be priests but revelation 1 5 comes from exodus 29 and says you are now washed amen in the blood of jesus christ which that word for the kelly washed actually you know it actually means loosed amen so what he done is he loosed you you were bound but he loosed you to manifest your spot in life god i i wish there was an x-ray machine in here this morning there's signals coming off of this i'm not a crazy man these are coming from a supernatural dimension the holy ghost is here today what's he here to do he's here to wash you he's here to loose you he's sure to loose you from your past amen to loose you from condemnation we're able to loose you from everything that will allow you to come into service oh god can i preach this morning y'all remember matthew 21 where there was a donkey tied up you remember that donkey and the bible said jesus come in and said go loose the colt i have need of it amen you realize that you lose that colt they brought it down there he got on it and he wrote it into town do you realize what happened they were throwing palm branches down they were shouting hosanna hosanna in the name of cometh in the name of the lord remember that remember how they were rejoicing at jesus coming into town you realize now there's a story like this that the next day that donkey went back to the barn it was in there and there was about three other donkeys in there with it now this next day all three donkeys were eaten but this one donkey was real depressed he was he was real sad he was real tore up and another donkey come over there and said said what's wrong with you what's wrong with you today man you need to get yourself together get up man he said i can't he said cause today's not just quite like yesterday he said you don't realize yesterday i went from being just another donkey in the barn eating the same grass you're picking around the same i went from being that ain't until they put they put a man on me and as he got on me he rode me into town and they were shouting hosanna hosanna he said you don't realize they were throwing palm branches at my feet he said you know there were people rejoicing around me they were having a good time and today none of that's going on what what's different about me today and that other donkey looked at him and said well let me tell you the difference yesterday the anointed word was on you but today it's not [Music] when the anointed word is on you you're more than a man you're more than a church you're more than a prophet you're more than a singer you're more than a preacher you're more than a deacon you're more than a young person you're more than a musician when the anointed word comes on you you are the triumphal capstone of the age that you're living in but you put the anointed word aside you're just another donkey in the brother andrew what are you saying if you lay this message aside it'll be another church with another preacher and another musician but if this message comes in and sits down upon the church it'll be an invincible army it'll be a powerful church it'll be more than an organization it will be a powerhouse oh jesus got on that he got on and it separated see amen so what does this message do this message separates you this message looses you to be more than a church member well i hope this is okay brother man now can i can i take a few moments here brother brother branham rehearse is a beautiful conversation between jesus and john the baptist he said now suffer this to be so john that's right in other words john you are a mighty man you are a great mighty prophet your revelation of me is exactly the truth you know who i am you know because your ministry didn't come from man your ministry came from god see your territory your lot your portion he said see you never learned it of a man you wasn't taught this in a seminary but at the age of nine years old you went into the wilderness because you were born an odd peculiar child and from your very birth god began to deal with you and even before your birth the prophet saw you and you are a light of this day you know who i am jesus speaking because god in the wilderness told you there'd be a sign following me and you've already bore witnessed it and you know it and we know who each other are we know each other and it is true john that you need to be baptized to me but let's set for that to be so for john if we are the lights of this day i i'll tell you man brother claim when i read this a prophet of god literally takes us back to a conversation between jesus and john and says if we are the lights of this day then we must fulfill all righteousness see all god's word must be fulfilled by us for this day for it is becoming to us it is behooving it's becoming it's like us oh god help me it's like us it's who we are it fits us for if we are the true witnesses of god today then john listen john we are the lights of this age that i say this morning the same god that talked to john is in this building this morning [Music] in the form of his word his word is here speaking today so can i just talk here for a minute brother stephen we are the lights of this age brother kelly we are the lights of this age brother john we are the lights of this age brother brother

don't know what to do and he looks at john he says if we're the light of this h he says john you're not fulfilling your commission sitting there and the prophet said this if we are the lights of this age there's so much scripture that's got to be fulfilled to be fulfilled during this age now listen here and it's up to us [Music] it's up to us so john's sitting there god sent a prophet that's right amen it's up to us john's sitting there and jesus begins preaching the word to him and the more jesus preaches to him the more john begins to get stirred inside and john says that's right jesus that's right that's right somebody's going to be baptized somebody's going to baptize you yes that's right jesus that's exactly right and jesus drops the question and says you're the light of the age you've got to baptize me me me who's got all these faults me that's got all these failures me that didn't come from a perfect home me that didn't come from a come from a a perfect family me and jesus said

same bible that speaks of matthew mark luke and john it's the same bible that speaks of paul same bible that speaks of peter same bible speaks of william branham same bible that speaks of andrew glover put your name there this morning that same bible speaks of you then what did jesus say to john suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness what does that word

christ if you're tired from working for the lord that's one thing but if you're tired from working and trying to do something that don't follow your lot that's a whole different thing but remember this morning your reason for being is to fulfill the word of this age [Music] you are the light of this age [Music] we must know our position and we must know our day what are you saying with andrew i'm saying this this message is more than just gathering in these four walls running these aisles shouting back and forth this is christ [Applause] the same christ that walked the shores of galilee [Applause] returned in this age to be manifested again so can we manifest forgiveness like he did [Applause] can we manifest love like he did can we manifest peace like he did can we manifest brotherly kindness like he did over lander now you're talking about compromising no no no no no no no no no you can stand jesus made a stand and love people when he ran him out of the mouth of the temple with whips but he made a stand i remember i'll just share this with you i just come on my heart to share it cause we're never too tired to do something for the lord right a few months ago when i was traveling through here coming home from from south carolina and i stopped here i would been down and somewhere in south carolina i can't remember anyhow it was a couple hours away from here and we got out got out there and we left and i left it's about i don't know it's about 2 30 3 34 about four o'clock in the morning when we come i come through here and i just said i can't make it the rest

witness of jesus christ and you know what i did i picked up the phone and i called that lady and i said ma'am i don't know you and you don't know me but i am a christian and i want you to know i didn't conduct myself like a christian should and i said i want to ask you to forgive me i'm sorry i said i was tired i've been traveling but that's no excuse she said sir i really appreciate that she said i receive that in jesus name i said i just couldn't go to sleep until i i called you and said i'm i'm sorry i said i pray you forgive me i said i didn't leave a good impression on the lord last night i come downstairs to get something from the from the counter and as i round the corner i heard a woman say you have a good night i'll see you tomorrow in the morning shift another one behind the counter said i received that in jesus name and i rounded the corner and she said oh i remember you she said how can i forget you you left an impression on me last time you was here [Applause] i don't

morning it becometh us it falls our lot you say berliner did you tell that for yourself no i told it to say this brother i didn't know brother claim i didn't open one spoken word book to that woman out there i didn't i didn't read one quote off of my ipad brother maurice i didn't tie one scripture and quote together but this has got to become flesh that when they see this they see this it becometh us to stand it becometh us to stand it behooveth us it is becoming to us that we fulfill all righteousness brother braham says like noah that we stand in this hour of trial he says brother stephen and pound away at the ark of the lord do you love him this morning has it ever dawned on you that noah stood there building the ark with families up on the hill bring in their let's put it this way they would bring their families up there on the hill for broadband said and what is the attraction on the mountain he said for a good laugh noah was the modern day driving show then and they would park up downhill and noah will be down there pounding away at the ark and they would be up there laughing at him laughing at him imagine imagine when them fathers looked their boy said look there boy that old preacher crazy preacher down there look at him get look how big that ark is he's crazy he oh god i'm preaching now he's crazy look at him and the son would begin to laugh and then maybe the mama would speak up and say look at that and noah never one time turned around and got an argument match with him he just kept on pounding away bored by board you know why because what is becoming to the believer is unbecoming to the critic and what is becoming to the critic is unbecoming to the believer how many can say today lord help me from this day forward help me to stand out in this hour of trial as the light not as a walking talking quote book but as the light the manifested light of this age do you love him this morning it is becoming to the critic to criticize but it is becoming to the believer to believe it is becoming to the scoffers to scoff but brother kelly it is becoming the enoch to walk wall cradled into a body change do you love him this morning let's bow our hearts together today is there a david here this morning that can say lord i want to stand lord i want to stand here today it was becoming the daniel to stand for the word in the face of idolatry it was becoming to him that he fulfilled all righteousness that he worshipped no other god or entangled himself with with the world only to god only so he just throwed back the shutters and threw up the sash and opened up the curtains looked out towards the east and prayed three times a day just like he always did why not slip off somewhere and hide to do it but he opened up the windows let anybody see that he wants to he wasn't ashamed of his religion how many christians do we have here today by the raising of your hand you could witness lord i'm a christian hands up all over the building but can i tell you it's unbecoming of a christian to be ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ not ashamed of the gospel it's the thing that holds us in the hours when the ship is a rock and it never stars out of sight and the moon and stars and storms are blowing it still holds for it's the gospel of jesus christ [Music] it was becoming of abraham to separate from unbelief it is becoming to any believer today to separate yourself from unbelief and when you see the hand of god moving power just as abraham did then it's time to step out and move [Music] old branham tabernacle it would be okay today can i put your name there oh spoken word tabernacle what kind of a word will we give at the day of judgment when we've seen his mighty hand we've seen his power we've watched his glory we've seen what he said it never fails we've seen his person the great pillar of fire a lot hanging in the room here we've seen it yonder science has taken the pictures of it and everything and hear the messages go forth write straight on the line separate yourself from them don't associate with anything of unbelief it's becoming to us that we fulfill all righteousness heavenly father lord we could go on and on today of your goodness and your mercies but lord i believe in this building and this meeting today lord there has been a outpouring of the holy ghost lord i believe as the prophet

moderately and lord here stands a group of believers here today father lord that are that have been through trials they've stood lord in the hour of trial lord just as as noah stood there that day and pounded away at the ark your prophet said noah went there and stood that day when it began to rain he stood in the ark store in the doorway lord there was nothing that got on the ark but what went through noah lord there was nothing that climbed upon that ark but what passed by noah the messenger to get on that ark and lord as we come here today father we're standing lord in the door of this message we're standing here screaming get on the ark get on the ark get in the ark of safety lord the world has fallen apart politics are gone lord corruption is sent in from the white house on down
