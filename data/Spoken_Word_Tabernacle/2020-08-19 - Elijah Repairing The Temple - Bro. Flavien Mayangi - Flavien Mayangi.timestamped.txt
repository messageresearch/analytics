[22:01] [Music]
[22:10] amen amen
[22:12] [Music]
[22:17] praise the lord
[22:21] you know the other uh the other sunday i
[22:23] don't know if
[22:24] y'all were here if you heard it or not
[22:26] but um a couple things brother shango
[22:28] said that just uh
[22:30] was really really touched my heart and
[22:32] one of the one of them was just so
[22:33] simple but
[22:34] i heard a message preacher one time
[22:36] trying uh
[22:38] he was talking about how um brother
[22:40] branham said that the city
[22:42] was was a pyramid and he described as a
[22:44] pyramid through the drawing that he did
[22:46] y'all are familiar with it
[22:47] and uh when john looked up he said he
[22:50] saw it as the shape of a square brother
[22:51] shango was talking about this on sunday
[22:54] and i heard a minister say that he was
[22:56] trying to make excuses for brother
[22:58] branham saying
[22:59] you know they're men they make mistakes
[23:02] he didn't know the answer to it like and
[23:03] it's god in simplicity but he's like
[23:06] you know john might have said it was a
[23:08] square and brother bram i said it's
[23:10] a pyramid but it doesn't matter it's
[23:11] just a city it's just a city
[23:13] but it was so it was such a blessing to
[23:15] me to hear how simple god is and how
[23:17] when john looked up he saw it as a
[23:19] square because he saw the bottom of the
[23:20] pyramid
[23:21] so it was a square and it was a pyramid
[23:24] so people
[23:25] try to find any way they can to diminish
[23:27] the
[23:28] the the work of god but god is true god
[23:30] is the same
[23:31] he's real and uh also as brother shango
[23:34] was saying how uh there has to be
[23:37] than people that worship the man just as
[23:39] there was in scripture
[23:40] there has to be people that will worship
[23:43] the man y'all could be seated y'all
[23:44] could be seated sorry to keep you
[23:45] standing
[23:47] and it's just it was that
[23:50] that was so real to me too because we
[23:52] see that so much we've seen
[23:54] in the past people worshiping the man
[23:55] william branham and even more now
[23:57] and then there's a lot of turning away
[23:59] because of the brother branham
[24:00] worshipers
[24:01] and even we this church has been accused
[24:04] of being brother branham worshipers
[24:05] because you know we believe the prophet
[24:07] in malachi 4 in revelations 10 7.
[24:09] so it's like it's so much of a split
[24:11] some to the left some to the right and
[24:13] it's very hard to see a church stay
[24:14] right down the middle of the road and i
[24:16] believe god's
[24:17] blessed us with a pastor and a church
[24:18] here it's not just the pastor's work you
[24:20] know it's the church
[24:21] keeping the pastor true too and uh i'm
[24:24] just grateful to be in this church where
[24:26] we see our pastor staying right down the
[24:28] straight and narrow and
[24:29] the church keeping him there and and uh
[24:32] um it's just a blessing to me to
[24:34] see it i'm super grateful let's just
[24:36] give the lord a round of applause
[24:43] um we'll just invite our pastor to come
[24:45] as we sing only beliefs this evening
[25:03] all things
[25:14] [Music]
[25:25] only believe
[25:30] all things are
[25:33] possible
[25:37] only believe
[25:41] amen god bless you tonight
[25:44] good to see everybody in the house of
[25:46] the lord
[25:47] i got my family my sister there i know
[25:51] that
[25:51] everybody here is a family
[25:53] [Laughter]
[25:54] but praise god we have one that is in
[25:57] the message and my brother-in-law
[25:59] we have uh i won't call him a visitor
[26:02] preacher i call them a brother
[26:07] it's just to show that we have
[26:09] fellowship with the churches around here
[26:12] some know him some i know he might not
[26:14] know him
[26:15] his name is brother mayang i know him
[26:18] for
[26:19] years he's a wonderful brother
[26:22] if you have uh any knowledge of brother
[26:25] al raven church
[26:27] i used to be in moon hill brother
[26:30] al passed away and he went to be with
[26:33] the lord and
[26:34] he was the one that was elected and he
[26:36] kept uh
[26:38] he's there as a shepherd for that flock
[26:41] up there so
[26:42] you don't hear much of him but he's a
[26:44] wonderful
[26:45] wonderful brother and not only a
[26:47] wonderful brother but a wonderful
[26:49] preacher
[26:50] so if we have some thomas tonight which
[26:53] i don't think
[26:54] you wait till you hear him then you will
[26:57] say brother stephen was right
[27:00] he believed the message he stand for the
[27:02] message and just like we
[27:04] stated this pulpit is for the preaching
[27:07] of the messenger
[27:09] we don't preach tj jakes here or joel
[27:11] austin here
[27:12] or psychology here we preach the end
[27:15] time
[27:16] message of brother branham
[27:21] so if you have a problem with the
[27:23] message this is probably not the place
[27:25] you should be
[27:27] we're going to preach the pure full
[27:29] message
[27:30] i'm sorry we got a small room today the
[27:34] hotel is having two events there so they
[27:36] just can't apologize and
[27:38] at least we are still space with social
[27:41] distance so lord's failing on sunday
[27:45] we'll resume back to our double room and
[27:48] things like that
[27:48] so we won't take too much time we're
[27:51] going to sing only believe again
[27:52] and i'm going to call brother miangi
[27:54] he's coming straight from work
[27:57] he could not go home and pick up his
[27:59] family so this is a big sacrifice
[28:02] for me so maybe next time lord willing
[28:05] you will see his family
[28:06] so the brother was working coming
[28:08] straight and he want to give his heart
[28:10] for the kingdom of the lord and i send
[28:12] his wife the link and hopefully she will
[28:14] be
[28:16] streaming just like the other brothers
[28:18] and
[28:19] we all can enjoy the word of god tonight
[28:21] so brother mayangi
[28:23] this is not a new church this is not
[28:27] another church this is the church of the
[28:30] living god

[32:07] i wanted to read something from what
[32:10] house will you build me amen
[32:15] just in a way of encouragement
[32:21] amen praise be the name of the lord
[32:25] the prophet says this
[32:28] he was speaking about brother
[32:33] uh by the green in texas
[32:38] actually he took some he moved to texan
[32:41] he says this
[32:44] i'm on paragraph 22 he says i believe
[32:47] today that the inspiration
[32:50] that's come to body green to move here
[32:54] him and sister green giving up
[32:57] the place back in east also
[33:01] back in texas to come here
[33:04] to start with nothing
[33:09] just simply by an inspiration
[33:12] feeling that they should do it
[33:16] and i appreciate the man that will
[33:19] follow
[33:20] the leading of christ regardless of
[33:24] what the cost is to them
[33:29] though the world may be your best
[33:32] friends
[33:34] think that you are wrong
[33:37] but it's not wrong to you
[33:39] [Music]
[33:40] amen as
[33:43] long as you feel there there's something
[33:46] behind it
[33:48] it's a god moving you it's never
[33:52] long it will always
[33:56] pan out light amen
[34:00] he says
[34:03] i realize that years ago i was called
[34:06] into the ministry
[34:08] i've never made a successful pastor this
[34:11] is what ubanam
[34:13] because i got a warming rambling spirit
[34:17] i can't be satisfied anywhere
[34:20] just wherever the spirit moves
[34:24] i've got to move with it because
[34:27] i've got a message and jesus said
[34:31] i must preach in the other town
[34:34] also how many believe that message
[34:38] that's the reason we're here otherwise
[34:41] we'll not be here
[34:43] amen but there are those who are
[34:47] shepherds that watch the flock
[34:51] i'm so grateful that brother perry
[34:54] followed the leading of the holy spirit
[34:57] and today
[34:58] we have a tabernacle
[35:02] it's a small one that's just good enough
[35:05] to start with
[35:07] to see what the holy spirit
[35:10] not knowing just move
[35:13] step by step now i believe
[35:17] if god has spoken brother
[35:21] sister green to come here and has
[35:25] opened up a place where our children
[35:28] instead of sunday morning one
[35:31] running or riding the bicycles
[35:35] and on the streets running around
[35:38] they have a place to come to worship
[35:42] amen instead of
[35:45] us sitting around and listening to
[35:48] something like
[35:49] that we have heard on a radio
[35:53] which is all right but we as
[35:56] this group of people we
[35:59] have a message for this day
[36:04] amen we we believe that the
[36:08] god has given us a message and brother
[36:12] green
[36:13] i will say buddy stephen now
[36:17] amen i don't want to call him my
[36:20] associate
[36:22] well it is also my associate
[36:25] we are together in this message amen
[36:29] but the green preaches the same thing
[36:33] and the message that i believe in
[36:36] he has left his home left his people
[36:40] left his church and i believe he was
[36:43] a district superintendent or something
[36:47] one of the of the organizations
[36:50] and give the whole thing up
[36:53] when he heard this
[36:57] let everything that was due to him
[37:00] also to come to the desert
[37:03] just to support what god has given us
[37:07] now amen you know
[37:11] the enemy would like to see the flock
[37:14] scattered all over the places
[37:18] because the bible says smite the
[37:21] shepherd
[37:22] and the sheep were scattered together
[37:25] around but god brings
[37:28] the little ones together amen
[37:32] so i would like to thank the pastor for
[37:34] his hospitality
[37:36] to allow us to come and share a little
[37:38] bit from the lord
[37:40] and glad to see brothers modest and his
[37:44] wife
[37:46] coming from concord also and glad to see
[37:48] each one of you
[37:50] so let's stand quickly and go into the
[37:53] scriptures
[37:55] praise be the name of the lord so like
[37:59] brother
[37:59] stephen say i am brother my angie
[38:03] and serving the lord in concord
[38:05] somewhere
[38:07] keep just pressing on
[38:10] amen but before we read the bible let's
[38:16] pray
[38:20] gracious heavenly father
[38:25] this is the moment when
[38:28] we need you the most
[38:32] we are aware that nothing we can do
[38:35] of our own that will help you people
[38:41] you are the only one that was found
[38:44] worthy lord when it comes to
[38:48] the redemption of the lost
[38:52] ways of adam and today
[38:55] we're calling upon you lord to move on
[38:58] the scene
[38:59] and take us out of the way
[39:03] and take over and speak to your children
[39:06] for whom you have given yourself
[39:09] father opened the scriptures to us
[39:13] may the spirit of god just bring the
[39:16] revelation the inspiration
[39:19] and all that we need to make this
[39:22] portion of the service
[39:24] beneficial for the kingdom of god all
[39:27] the glory
[39:28] will be given to you in jesus christ's
[39:31] name we pray
[39:32] amen
[39:35] thank you jesus let's turn to first
[39:38] kings
[39:38] chapter 18 little
[39:42] thoughts we have been sharing back home
[39:46] and trust it will help somebody
[39:51] first kings chapter
[40:08] eighteen
[40:11] and let's start from first
[40:16] maybe let's see here 32
[40:25] i mean uh let's start from 29
[40:29] it says first kings
[40:33] 18 verse 29
[40:36] the bible says and it came to pass
[40:39] when midday was passed and they
[40:42] prophesied until the time of the
[40:45] offering
[40:46] of the evening sacrifice that there was
[40:50] neither voice nor any to answer
[40:53] no any that regarded
[40:56] and elijah said unto all the people
[41:00] come near unto me and all the people
[41:04] came near unto him and he repaired
[41:08] the altar of the lord that was broken
[41:11] down
[41:13] and elijah took 12 stones according to
[41:16] the number of the tribes of the sons of
[41:18] jacob
[41:20] unto whom the word of the lord came
[41:22] saying
[41:23] israel shall be thy name
[41:26] and with the stones he built an altar
[41:30] in the name of the lord and he made a
[41:34] trench about the altar as great
[41:37] as the wool contained two measures of
[41:41] seed
[41:42] may the lord add a blessing to the
[41:44] reading of his word you may be seated
[41:47] amen once again i greet you all in the
[41:50] name of the lord jesus christ
[41:53] it's an honor for us to
[41:56] have this opportunity of fellowship with
[42:00] you
[42:00] and share a little bit from the world
[42:05] we are familiar with the scripture we
[42:07] just read
[42:10] talking about elijah
[42:13] elijah is the top of a man
[42:18] the tishbite actually he came
[42:21] out of nowhere and
[42:26] he does not say who his father his
[42:29] mother were his family they just said
[42:33] the tishbite
[42:35] but he was kind of a strange man
[42:39] he lived in the wilderness by himself
[42:43] i would say with god amen
[42:47] he did not go to a school
[42:50] of modern day
[42:54] church order he was a a man who was
[42:59] alone in the presence of god
[43:03] and out of nowhere
[43:07] they saw a man walking to the palace
[43:11] with the message and his message was
[43:17] accept i call for when
[43:20] there will not be when coming down
[43:25] even not do
[43:28] that was strange can you imagine
[43:32] uh a man woke up to the white house
[43:36] and give such a message as that
[43:40] the king probably heard elijah speaking
[43:43] and he said
[43:44] well i don't know where he comes from
[43:47] maybe he lost his mind and he took it
[43:51] just lightly
[43:52] and he forgot about it but
[43:57] a month passed six months
[44:02] one year no drop
[44:05] of rain now is that
[44:08] drawing attention of the people
[44:12] you say well there was a fanatic
[44:15] came here and said exactly what is
[44:19] happening here
[44:22] a year and a half nothing happened
[44:25] no rain no dew
[44:30] no crop and
[44:33] ricardo start dying people start
[44:37] dying no food
[44:40] and then people have to do something
[44:44] amen that's why when we go
[44:48] to verse i think 17 the same verse the
[44:50] same chapter
[44:57] now after we know the story we don't
[45:01] have much time to go to the details so
[45:04] after elijah spoke the word we know how
[45:07] god
[45:07] took him to a place of a refuge where
[45:11] he fed him and he took care of him
[45:15] and then after the king realized that
[45:19] we have to do something and then god
[45:22] spoke to elijah to go meet with
[45:24] uh ahab verse 17 he says
[45:28] and it came to pass when ahab
[45:32] so elijah that ahab said unto him
[45:37] or thou he that troubled
[45:40] israel
[45:43] and he answered i have not
[45:47] troubled israel but thou
[45:51] and thy father's house
[45:54] in that ye have forsaken
[45:58] the commandment of the lord
[46:02] that's the trouble amen
[46:06] and the thou has followed balaam
[46:11] israel is the people of god
[46:18] god singled out that nation for a
[46:21] purpose
[46:23] that was the only nation that knew
[46:27] god the ways of the people
[46:30] are called hidden
[46:33] pagans idolaters
[46:37] and all these things we know
[46:41] but it happened that they were living in
[46:44] such a time that the nation was
[46:49] carried away into idolatry
[46:53] amen so god cannot
[46:56] let the sin go unpunished
[47:00] amen so he had a man
[47:03] up on the earth for that generation
[47:08] imagine in in chapter 7
[47:11] verse 1 i mean i mean 17
[47:15] where elijah came and spoke to ahab
[47:18] the elijah said it was like this he says
[47:23] elijah the tishbite who was in
[47:26] the of the inhabitants of david
[47:29] said unto ahab as
[47:32] the lord the god of israel
[47:36] liveth amen
[47:40] no matter how many bars they had
[47:44] the lord the god was alive
[47:47] no mother they could not see
[47:51] the manifestation of god
[47:54] to show that he was alive in the midst
[47:58] but he was living sin
[48:02] is what actually
[48:05] blind god away from the people
[48:10] and that's what was happening so elijah
[48:13] said as the lord the god of
[48:15] israel live it before
[48:19] whom i stand
[48:22] amen he stood in the presence of god
[48:27] and the word that he spoke to that
[48:30] generation
[48:32] came straight from god a man
[48:36] a prophet of that
[48:41] stand like elijah they don't come
[48:45] with some man-made theology
[48:48] they stand in the presence of god
[48:52] when they say something it's a god who
[48:56] speaks to them and you choose if you
[48:59] want to believe and
[49:01] follow or you want to reject and
[49:04] you know what's going to happen so
[49:07] elijah stood in the presence of god
[49:11] so his message to ahab
[49:14] it was trouble
[49:18] so when he came about ahab came to
[49:21] elijah
[49:23] and he said are you the one troubling
[49:26] israel
[49:29] elijah said no i have not troubled
[49:33] israel but you have trouble israel
[49:36] because this is a people of god
[49:39] and you have taken them away from the
[49:42] message
[49:44] away from the world
[49:48] amen that's what draws
[49:51] judgment over any generation that goes
[49:56] away from god
[49:59] so right away elijah said
[50:02] let's prove and find out who is god
[50:06] because you see when you go when you
[50:10] turn a god down you
[50:13] have to get you a substitute
[50:18] amen when you turn down the message
[50:22] you're gonna have to pick up something
[50:24] else
[50:26] amen so in this case
[50:29] they had valium
[50:33] their church services continued
[50:36] but not in the will of god
[50:40] amen so the message of the hour
[50:43] came to judge that generation praise be
[50:47] the name of the lord
[50:49] so elijah challenged them because he was
[50:53] alone and the rest of the church
[50:57] of that time was way
[51:00] way great in number
[51:04] in so much people look to say oh he does
[51:07] not have god
[51:08] he just he's just him by himself
[51:12] in fact his church is in the wilderness
[51:15] look at the church we have here we have
[51:18] the king
[51:20] on our side even the queen
[51:23] it does not mean a thing to god amen
[51:28] praise be the name of the lord
[51:31] so elijah called them to
[51:34] that great showdown the scripture we
[51:38] just
[51:38] read i think it was uh
[51:44] verse 29 of first
[51:47] kings 18 but my thought
[51:50] here is elijah
[51:54] repairing with building the altar
[51:58] amen so
[52:02] we know the story how elijah said now
[52:06] you are 400 of you just
[52:10] go ahead and uh get your sacrifice
[52:13] and offer to your god
[52:16] and if he is god let him
[52:19] answer by fire amen
[52:23] what a challenge what a showdown
[52:27] and elijah said i will get also a
[52:30] sacrifice
[52:31] and i will call on the name of the lord
[52:36] and let him that is god answer by
[52:40] fire praise be the name of the lord
[52:43] but elijah let them do their
[52:47] uh church uh religious
[52:50] rituals and do their sermons and
[52:54] everything but not a life
[52:57] change amen where's be the name of the
[53:02] lord
[53:03] they had some services they had
[53:05] everything
[53:06] you can imagine in what the world called
[53:09] church amen the church
[53:13] is the presence of god in
[53:16] in the midst of his people the spirit of
[53:20] god will take a hold of a man
[53:23] and through his lips will preach the
[53:26] message
[53:27] that will catch the hearts of the people
[53:30] and turn them back to god
[53:33] amen that's the church of the living god
[53:36] where god manifests his promised word
[53:39] for that day where we see
[53:42] jesus christ alive the same
[53:45] yesterday today and forever
[53:49] that's the church of the living god
[53:52] but the devil comes and defiles that
[53:55] group
[53:56] and makes them look warm and makes them
[53:59] just like the west of the churches amen
[54:04] but we see here elijah let them do their
[54:07] rituals
[54:09] he even mocked them
[54:13] he said but what a god do you guys serve
[54:18] you have been praying preaching and all
[54:21] this time
[54:23] nothing happened and you need to
[54:26] to scream louder maybe your god
[54:29] went to a trip or something amen
[54:33] that's the spirit of elijah amen so when
[54:37] you see elijah speaking
[54:39] you have to have a spiritual
[54:42] understanding
[54:43] to see that this is god otherwise you'll
[54:47] take him like
[54:48] any other man and make fun of his
[54:51] message
[54:52] read the bible elijah said your god went
[54:56] to a trip
[54:58] foreign of the lord
[55:01] but at the evening time amen
[55:07] oh my the second
[55:10] scripture i should have read was malachi
[55:12] chapter 4
[55:14] because that's today
[55:17] amen so first kings 18
[55:21] is just like a background because we
[55:24] cannot talk about
[55:26] elijah today and understand his
[55:29] ministry his nature and
[55:32] and the way the lord uses him if you
[55:35] miss to see the first elijah amen
[55:39] because that's the same spirit
[55:42] praise be the name of the lord in fact
[55:46] god sends that spirit when the people
[55:50] have gone astray from god
[55:53] because the ministry of elijah is a
[55:56] ministry of restoration
[55:59] is to bring something that has fallen
[56:03] and we store it back to its position
[56:07] that's what is happening today where is
[56:10] be the name of the law
[56:13] but you see elijah did not
[56:17] call for fire
[56:21] before repairing first the altar
[56:27] amen that's very important
[56:31] before i continue let me read something
[56:34] the prophet says here
[56:38] in the message
[56:41] uh exposition of the seven church ages
[56:45] this is the south sadism church age
[56:49] he says talking about the messengers
[56:54] in each church age he says here
[56:59] in for in each age
[57:03] the church goes astray
[57:07] and it is not just the laity
[57:12] but the clergy group
[57:16] shepherds are wrong as
[57:19] well as sheep amen
[57:24] amen so
[57:26] when elijah came it was the clergy
[57:34] it was the ministers the preachers
[57:39] those who had the responsibility
[57:42] to lead the people to god amen
[57:46] they get astray and lead the people with
[57:49] them
[57:51] amen so when god sees that condition
[57:56] on the earth he sends a messenger
[58:01] praise be the name of the lord
[58:04] so in this case here is elijah
[58:09] praise be the name of the lord listen
[58:12] what he says
[58:17] the the prophet actually
[58:21] he he longed
[58:24] to see the church of the living god in
[58:28] godly order because
[58:32] when he he was a sent
[58:35] he came into laodicean condition of the
[58:38] church
[58:39] where nothing good was
[58:42] said about the church age exactly
[58:46] the same way it happened in a time of
[58:49] elijah
[58:50] there was nothing good there was a woman
[58:55] called jesse bell the prophetess
[58:59] he had him her she had a group of
[59:04] ministers that were actually
[59:07] eating from his or her table
[59:12] how how can you expect
[59:16] such a minister to go and
[59:19] challenge the queen amen
[59:23] or the king because
[59:27] your paycheck depends on her on him
[59:32] so if you push the message you're not
[59:35] going to get paid
[59:38] amen so you have to preach
[59:41] and say things that pleases
[59:44] his or her ears but elijah was not of
[59:49] that type
[59:50] he stood in the presence of god
[59:54] his message came straight from god
[59:58] amen no matter who will believe it
[1:00:01] who will not believe it he preached a
[1:00:04] message
[1:00:06] it was such a chaos that elijah
[1:00:10] thought he was the only one left
[1:00:13] because laodicean condition
[1:00:17] it's terrible
[1:00:21] the people who say the church who says
[1:00:23] we don't have need of you god
[1:00:27] they kicked him out of the church
[1:00:31] we are rich we have
[1:00:34] increased in wages
[1:00:37] but when god diagnoses that age
[1:00:41] he said you don't know that you are
[1:00:44] blind wretched
[1:00:47] miserable amen praise be the name of the
[1:00:52] lord
[1:00:53] so elijah came to call you out of that
[1:00:56] condition
[1:00:58] so that your eyes with the eye serve you
[1:01:01] can
[1:01:01] see what is happening come on
[1:01:05] come over my people where is be the name
[1:01:08] of the lord
[1:01:10] god had a little handful 7 000
[1:01:14] that did not bow before
[1:01:17] that god of that evil age
[1:01:22] so we can even take the example of
[1:01:28] john the baptist he had the spirit of
[1:01:31] elijah
[1:01:33] on him amen
[1:01:36] so the bible says
[1:01:39] he had the spirit of elijah
[1:01:43] in order to restore the hearts
[1:01:46] of the fathers to the children
[1:01:50] amen as elijah
[1:01:54] his ministry was to restore the hearts
[1:01:58] of the fathers
[1:02:00] back to the children
[1:02:04] amen oh it was such a quiet i thought
[1:02:07] maybe
[1:02:08] i was saying things here
[1:02:13] william barnum is to restore the hearts
[1:02:16] of the
[1:02:16] children back to the fathers
[1:02:20] john the baptist was to take the
[1:02:23] patriarchs
[1:02:26] amen bring them to believe
[1:02:29] the faith of the children when
[1:02:32] jesus was there because
[1:02:36] the patriarch they
[1:02:39] actually gave them under moses
[1:02:43] the law you have to sacrifice uh
[1:02:49] maybe a lame natural lamb and uh
[1:02:52] turtle dove and all those
[1:02:56] natural sacrifices and they're depending
[1:02:59] on
[1:03:00] that for so long until
[1:03:04] it has become a tradition
[1:03:07] they have become pharisees solicits
[1:03:11] and all that under the law of moses
[1:03:17] but the messiah could not be received in
[1:03:20] that condition
[1:03:22] so god has to send the spirit of elijah
[1:03:27] to take them from that for those
[1:03:30] traditions to come and believe
[1:03:33] the genuine sacrifice
[1:03:37] amen but he could not
[1:03:40] come and introduce the messiah
[1:03:44] before we build in the altar
[1:03:48] because you see if the altar is not in
[1:03:52] order
[1:03:53] your sacrifice will not be accepted
[1:03:58] you think the prophets of baals
[1:04:01] did not sacrifice they did sacrifice
[1:04:06] they did have an altar but it was
[1:04:10] not according to the order of god for
[1:04:12] that day
[1:04:14] praise be in the name of the lord
[1:04:18] john i mean elijah he did not
[1:04:21] pick up anything from everywhere
[1:04:25] he stood in the presence of god
[1:04:28] and god told him what it takes
[1:04:32] in order to please him he
[1:04:36] went and took 12 stones
[1:04:40] not 30 not 14 not
[1:04:43] 50 12.
[1:04:46] amen after the names
[1:04:49] of the tribes of israel
[1:04:54] because he has to restore that people
[1:04:56] back to god
[1:05:00] he will prepare the altar he will build
[1:05:04] the altar
[1:05:06] if you read the bible says even the
[1:05:08] words
[1:05:10] was set in order upon that altar
[1:05:14] and then he laid down the sacrifice
[1:05:18] oh the fire was obligated to come down
[1:05:23] praise be the name of the lord john the
[1:05:26] baptist when he came
[1:05:29] let's read a little bit of that do you
[1:05:32] mind
[1:05:34] praise be the name of the lord so
[1:05:42] matthew chapter 3
[1:05:48] this is the forerunner of the messiah
[1:05:59] verse 403.
[1:06:04] well
[1:06:11] let's give us one he said in those days
[1:06:15] came with john the baptist preaching in
[1:06:18] the the wilderness of judea
[1:06:20] and saying repent for the kingdom of
[1:06:24] heaven is at hand
[1:06:26] for this is the heat that was spoken of
[1:06:29] by the prophet isaiah saying
[1:06:32] the voice of one crying in the
[1:06:35] wilderness
[1:06:37] prepare ye the way of the lord
[1:06:41] make his path straight
[1:06:47] you cannot straighten out something that
[1:06:49] was not
[1:06:53] amen are you getting it you have to get
[1:06:57] the thing straight
[1:07:00] praise be the name of the lord you
[1:07:03] cannot
[1:07:05] just do something i mean prepare
[1:07:07] something that was not unprepared
[1:07:12] so that was the ministry of elijah
[1:07:17] verse 4 and the same
[1:07:20] john had his remnant of
[1:07:24] camel's hair that's elijah
[1:07:28] and a lead and girl
[1:07:32] about his loins his meat was locked
[1:07:37] in wild honey
[1:07:42] many puppets would not let him come
[1:07:45] preach
[1:07:47] he was rugged
[1:07:50] he was tough amen
[1:07:58] verse 6 verse 5 then when out of him
[1:08:03] to him jerusalem and all judea all the
[1:08:06] regions learned about jordan
[1:08:08] and we're baptized of him in jordan
[1:08:12] confessing those sins
[1:08:15] the prophet says people
[1:08:18] the religious people they said
[1:08:22] where these men come from
[1:08:28] remember the pharisees even sent the
[1:08:30] people to ask
[1:08:31] who are they are you the christ
[1:08:35] no are you the elijah
[1:08:38] no are you the prophet
[1:08:42] no puzzled
[1:08:46] tell us who are you so we will bring
[1:08:50] word to those who sent us
[1:08:53] amen he had a prophecy
[1:08:58] about his ministry it was
[1:09:01] up to them to believe it or not
[1:09:04] amen listen
[1:09:10] uh i was saying that the prophet said it
[1:09:12] was strange for them to see a man
[1:09:14] drowning people into water
[1:09:18] never seen before what a religion is
[1:09:21] this drawing people
[1:09:25] in the water but god told him to do that
[1:09:30] amen so when you see elijah preaching
[1:09:34] things
[1:09:36] you have to be from the lord in order to
[1:09:39] receive it
[1:09:41] the rest of the people will go to the
[1:09:44] bible they won't found it
[1:09:46] it was not for them amen
[1:09:50] praise be the name of the lord it says
[1:09:57] seven but when he saw many of the
[1:10:00] pharisees and the services come to his
[1:10:03] baptism
[1:10:04] he said unto them oh
[1:10:08] generation of vipers
[1:10:11] is that how you speak to the religious
[1:10:14] leaders that's the spirit of elijah
[1:10:18] amen amen prayers be the name of the
[1:10:22] lord
[1:10:23] who hath wants you to flee
[1:10:26] from the world to come we
[1:10:30] thought therefore the foods
[1:10:33] meet for repentance
[1:10:38] and think not to say within yourself
[1:10:42] we are christians we have the holy ghost
[1:10:45] we are ministers no
[1:10:49] he says think not to say within yourself
[1:10:53] we have abraham o our father to our
[1:10:56] father
[1:10:58] for i say unto you
[1:11:01] that the god is able of
[1:11:04] these stones to raise up children to
[1:11:07] abraham
[1:11:09] amen praise be the name of the lord
[1:11:19] and in that same baptism to save time
[1:11:24] the soldiers came he said
[1:11:27] what should we do now
[1:11:31] don't take from people what you're not
[1:11:34] supposed to take
[1:11:35] the tax gathered they came and said what
[1:11:39] shall we do
[1:11:41] he told them what they must live
[1:11:42] straight
[1:11:44] before he introduced the sacrifice
[1:11:49] the altar the hearts of the people have
[1:11:53] to get right
[1:11:55] before they receive the messiah
[1:12:00] amen he told them everyone what they
[1:12:04] were supposed to do
[1:12:06] but to the minister he told them don't
[1:12:10] you consider yourself to be of
[1:12:12] god when your life proved contrary
[1:12:16] [Music]
[1:12:17] amen it was
[1:12:21] in that baptism then
[1:12:24] jesus just made his way
[1:12:27] amen you know what john the baptist said
[1:12:33] he said there is one
[1:12:36] in your midst i do not know him
[1:12:41] but the very reason why
[1:12:44] i am baptizing is to make a way for him
[1:12:50] because the one who sent
[1:12:54] me to do this so drawing
[1:12:57] people into the water god told him to do
[1:13:00] that
[1:13:01] amen it was a new enforced
[1:13:05] doctrine to the church but it was the
[1:13:08] word of god the message for the hour
[1:13:12] praise be the name of the lord
[1:13:17] the one who sent me to baptize
[1:13:20] told me the
[1:13:23] man up on whom i see
[1:13:27] the pillow of fire coming down
[1:13:31] amen that's
[1:13:35] the one he will baptize you with the
[1:13:38] holy ghost
[1:13:40] amen and here comes the pill of fire
[1:13:44] only john was allowed to say it
[1:13:49] and you must believe john's testimony
[1:13:53] amen if you want to believe what the
[1:13:57] scientists
[1:13:58] say about it you go ahead but
[1:14:01] john had a testimony that the pill of
[1:14:05] fire
[1:14:06] came down he heard the voice
[1:14:10] the rest of the people it was not given
[1:14:13] to them
[1:14:15] you must read the bible as a love
[1:14:19] letter not like a newspaper and come out
[1:14:24] try to condemn
[1:14:26] your messenger no
[1:14:29] you would not get a thing if you
[1:14:30] approach it that way
[1:14:34] the bible says the paul heard the voice
[1:14:38] he saw the sound the the pillow fire the
[1:14:42] rest of the people didn't
[1:14:45] so when the prophet give a
[1:14:48] testimony believe it
[1:14:52] because the god has validated that man
[1:14:56] please be the name of the lord amen so
[1:15:00] john told them you need to forget
[1:15:04] about your cuddles your your lambs your
[1:15:08] pigeons your your your sacrifices
[1:15:12] so-called you got from moses
[1:15:15] behold the lamb of god
[1:15:19] amen behold the man
[1:15:24] the father have to come down
[1:15:27] those valleys have to go low believe
[1:15:31] that simplicity of god
[1:15:35] amen behold the lamb of god who takes
[1:15:39] away the sins of the world
[1:15:43] but you see
[1:15:48] in this last days let's see the prophet
[1:15:52] says something here
[1:15:58] you know in the message the feast of the
[1:16:01] trumpet
[1:16:05] he says this i'm on paragraph
[1:16:09] 274 this was preached july the 19th
[1:16:13] 1964 in the morning he says
[1:16:18] he is making reference to another elijah
[1:16:20] here
[1:16:21] amen because we know the spirit of
[1:16:25] elijah comes
[1:16:27] how many times five times
[1:16:31] so he's making reference to the elijah
[1:16:33] to come and moses he says
[1:16:37] in reference i mean i'm sorry in
[1:16:39] revelation 11
[1:16:41] call the ministry will be the ministry
[1:16:45] of moses and elijah
[1:16:48] calling to israel
[1:16:53] out of the jewish traditions
[1:17:00] just as the seventh angel's
[1:17:04] message called
[1:17:08] the bride out of the pentecostal
[1:17:14] tradition
[1:17:16] amen because when
[1:17:19] elijah of malachi 4 comes to laodicea
[1:17:24] the church was in the pentecostal
[1:17:28] edge pentecost
[1:17:32] called a pentecostal age that laodicea
[1:17:35] that's the latest revival we have in the
[1:17:38] denominations
[1:17:41] that's the church that kicked out jesus
[1:17:43] christ
[1:17:45] from the candlesticks
[1:17:48] from the church he was knocking the door
[1:17:52] to get to you
[1:17:55] amen so elijah's
[1:17:58] ministry today
[1:18:02] is to call the bride
[1:18:06] out of the tradition
[1:18:10] of laodicea
[1:18:13] before he laid down
[1:18:18] the sacrifice before he calls
[1:18:22] down the fire
[1:18:26] because the fire will not come down
[1:18:30] as long as the altar is
[1:18:34] in this array
[1:18:38] so he says
[1:18:44] so their ministry will be the ministry
[1:18:47] of moses and elijah
[1:18:49] calling to israel out of the
[1:18:53] jewish traditions just
[1:18:56] as the seventh angel's message
[1:19:00] called the bird out of the pentecostal
[1:19:03] tradition amen
[1:19:07] remember moses and elijah
[1:19:11] is to call israel out
[1:19:14] of the all atonement of lamb
[1:19:19] and sheep and blood
[1:19:22] and goats and sacrifice
[1:19:25] to the real living
[1:19:29] sacrifice to the world
[1:19:34] amen so you see that's what john the
[1:19:38] baptist did
[1:19:40] he was calling the the patriarchs
[1:19:44] the fathers out of those
[1:19:47] sacrifices to introduce them
[1:19:52] to the word jesus christ the lamb
[1:19:56] who takes away the sins of the world but
[1:19:59] did they receive that
[1:20:02] no they had to reject that
[1:20:06] so that you the god will receive it in
[1:20:09] your day
[1:20:11] because they have rejected the sacrifice
[1:20:14] god is sending moses and elijah back to
[1:20:18] them for that very purpose
[1:20:23] but elijah must rebuild the altar first
[1:20:28] praise be the name of the lord
[1:20:31] thank you jesus and he says that
[1:20:35] very much all over the places here in
[1:20:37] this message
[1:20:41] thank you jesus
[1:20:44] so we see
[1:20:49] when the prophet came to this age
[1:20:53] he found a church in the condition where
[1:20:57] there was nowhere where to start
[1:21:01] he tells us he was pastor
[1:21:06] deacon trusting
[1:21:09] everything himself
[1:21:14] he said i think i've got it here
[1:21:18] let me see it says this
[1:21:23] this is in the church age
[1:21:27] i mean in the church order of 1963
[1:21:33] he says this
[1:21:40] page 5 he says now when
[1:21:43] we dedicated the church i told you
[1:21:47] a little later i had
[1:21:51] something to talk to you about this is
[1:21:56] 1963.
[1:21:57] so he's making a reference to the
[1:22:00] previous
[1:22:01] dedication they had the old tabernacle
[1:22:06] how to set this thing in order
[1:22:10] the way it should be one
[1:22:15] because the theology of the church of
[1:22:19] that day
[1:22:20] it was loud decent condition
[1:22:25] it was not fit for the boy
[1:22:30] he says
[1:22:35] and you started off after living here
[1:22:40] we had ministers and so forth
[1:22:46] you see when the prophet when the lord
[1:22:50] called the prophet to the ministry
[1:22:53] and not long after he told him to do the
[1:22:57] work of an evangelist
[1:23:00] so he could not continue to pasture
[1:23:04] so he had to go and take the message
[1:23:08] out but the church bottom tabernacle
[1:23:12] continue
[1:23:13] as a church as a local church that's
[1:23:15] what he's talking about
[1:23:17] he says when you started off
[1:23:21] after living here we had
[1:23:24] ministers and so forth but
[1:23:27] now by the never being just a young
[1:23:30] among us
[1:23:32] come among us i thought it would be
[1:23:35] better for uh brother neville to get
[1:23:39] better established in the faith
[1:23:43] before i presented such
[1:23:46] things as i'm about to do now
[1:23:50] amen so for so many years
[1:23:56] he was rebuilding the altar
[1:24:01] same message paired with 150 he says
[1:24:08] look the way we used to do it years ago
[1:24:12] sister gertie was the pianist
[1:24:16] when i pastored here
[1:24:19] i had to be pastor deacon
[1:24:23] trustee everything else at once
[1:24:29] amen why he had to do that
[1:24:32] 17 years
[1:24:36] there was no one qualified to be deacon
[1:24:40] the altar was torn down
[1:24:44] laodicea will make deacon double
[1:24:48] triple made with people they will make
[1:24:51] minister divorce men and things like
[1:24:54] that
[1:24:55] it was a chaos
[1:24:58] but he had to rebuild the altar
[1:25:02] before laying down the sacrifice
[1:25:09] and he says but i had to do it
[1:25:14] now you don't have to do it that way
[1:25:19] see because you got men
[1:25:23] to carry this out
[1:25:26] amen so we are not rebuilding the altar
[1:25:31] the lord has already rebuilt the altar
[1:25:35] but to show you the condition of the
[1:25:38] edge
[1:25:40] women preachers
[1:25:43] you can cut your hair women wear
[1:25:48] a man's garment and sing in a car
[1:25:51] and put put the uh well uh
[1:25:55] make up and all those things
[1:25:58] that was not the condition for the blood
[1:26:01] of the lord
[1:26:02] jesus christ
[1:26:06] that was in the church when you go
[1:26:07] outside the same thing
[1:26:10] the women in the age have lost their
[1:26:13] position
[1:26:14] as a woman no wonder they call
[1:26:19] him to be women it
[1:26:22] no he was elijah he was trying to tell
[1:26:25] the people to get
[1:26:27] back in the line before he laid
[1:26:31] down the sacrifice
[1:26:35] the church was in such a condition
[1:26:40] the prophet was to be all that
[1:26:44] but after things start coming together
[1:26:48] and then he says now
[1:26:52] let's talk about that order amen
[1:26:56] not when the preacher is preaching and
[1:26:59] the sister gets up and speaking tongue
[1:27:04] because he's got the holy ghost she's
[1:27:06] got the holy ghost
[1:27:08] the church was in such a confusion
[1:27:12] this was just loud this year
[1:27:16] but you see many people
[1:27:20] thought that was the message
[1:27:24] the message was to come
[1:27:28] amen but the message will come
[1:27:33] oh my i don't know my tongue here
[1:27:37] let me read something here
[1:27:46] uh i'm in the message
[1:27:58] the
[1:28:07] i think it's though
[1:28:17] the anointed ones at the end time
[1:28:22] i'm gonna make it short here i know
[1:28:24] we're running against time here
[1:28:29] he's talking about the spirit that goes
[1:28:33] against the message
[1:28:37] the anointed word of the day matthew 24
[1:28:41] 24.
[1:28:43] and now he gets on saying paper of 258
[1:28:46] he says
[1:28:47] notice
[1:28:50] compare
[1:28:53] them together
[1:28:59] now when you get home notice matthew 24
[1:29:03] 24
[1:29:04] jesus speaking paul ii
[1:29:07] timothy 3 8 many orders
[1:29:11] and now compare that
[1:29:16] that's the spirit we see today
[1:29:20] second timothy 3 says
[1:29:24] men of reprobate mind
[1:29:27] they always go against
[1:29:31] the world ever learning
[1:29:36] never will come to the knowledge
[1:29:39] of the truth
[1:29:42] that's the edge we are living in he says
[1:29:47] uh page 2 59 he says and then
[1:29:51] after quoting matthew 24 24
[1:29:54] uh 2nd timothy 3 8 he says and then
[1:29:58] put another scripture
[1:30:01] luke 17 30.
[1:30:04] malachi 4
[1:30:08] as a genus and james with stood moses
[1:30:13] the anointed word of the hour
[1:30:18] so will these men
[1:30:22] it says not men singular but
[1:30:25] men plural
[1:30:29] anointed ones
[1:30:32] will resist the truth
[1:30:36] they will not resist the body bonham
[1:30:39] they will try to
[1:30:40] challenge the message by doing so they
[1:30:44] are challenging jesus christ
[1:30:47] the word
[1:30:50] 260. he says
[1:30:55] maybe i need to speak for this
[1:31:05] wow so many things he says in the very
[1:31:09] day that the son of man is revealed
[1:31:13] revelation 10 1 to 7
[1:31:17] we read it when you get home
[1:31:22] let me skip here it says
[1:31:26] and in that day janice and jambos
[1:31:29] will withstand anointed ones
[1:31:34] make believers and unbelievers the
[1:31:37] church formal and the pentecostals
[1:31:41] stand up against the true
[1:31:44] grain
[1:31:48] you know what the bible says let them
[1:31:51] alone
[1:31:53] their fully will be made
[1:31:56] manifest as theirs
[1:32:00] was see you understand
[1:32:04] now
[1:32:10] 260 and 261
[1:32:15] he says revelation 10
[1:32:19] said in the days of the sounding of the
[1:32:22] seventh angel
[1:32:24] now remember
[1:32:27] seventh laodicea
[1:32:30] church edge the sounding
[1:32:34] of that angel
[1:32:38] when that church edge is done
[1:32:41] denominated and become
[1:32:44] a church edge when it's
[1:32:48] done it's in its pentecostal
[1:32:52] organization will send the messenger
[1:32:56] to that now
[1:32:59] listen he says
[1:33:03] what was each messenger
[1:33:07] what was martin luther
[1:33:11] a rebuke to the catholic right
[1:33:15] what was wesley a rebuke to the lutheran
[1:33:20] what was the pentecost a rebuke to them
[1:33:24] orders
[1:33:26] where has their life gone now
[1:33:34] amen
[1:33:37] away from an organization
[1:33:41] no more shock it's grain
[1:33:46] what is it a rebuke to the pentecost see
[1:33:51] to fulfill the scripture
[1:33:54] of this hour
[1:33:59] notice 262
[1:34:02] though very day
[1:34:05] when this messenger
[1:34:09] not when he starts on
[1:34:14] but when he begins
[1:34:17] to declare his message
[1:34:22] amen so
[1:34:25] before he declares the message
[1:34:29] there was a work being done
[1:34:33] according to the bible he has to gather
[1:34:37] the loose ends
[1:34:41] what will left through the edges
[1:34:47] so when luther came
[1:34:50] he was the messenger he was anointed
[1:34:54] to do a work of reformation
[1:34:58] he was not in that
[1:35:01] uh ministry to
[1:35:04] catch the mysteries hidden mysteries
[1:35:09] he just did enough for the people of
[1:35:12] that age
[1:35:13] because there was coming in elijah
[1:35:18] whose ministry according to revelation
[1:35:21] 10 is to reveal the hidden truth
[1:35:28] amen so he's staying here not
[1:35:32] when he starts on but
[1:35:35] when he begins to declare
[1:35:38] his message see
[1:35:42] the first pool healing
[1:35:47] some people grab that call it the
[1:35:50] message
[1:35:52] yes it's part of the message don't get
[1:35:54] me wrong
[1:35:56] amen it's part of the message
[1:36:01] but the altar was being rebuilt
[1:36:05] there was such a confusion in the in in
[1:36:08] the church a
[1:36:10] work was to be done
[1:36:13] second paul prophesying
[1:36:18] third paul the opening
[1:36:21] of the word the mysteries
[1:36:25] reveal
[1:36:29] because the word opened
[1:36:34] the anointed of the pill of fire on that
[1:36:37] word
[1:36:39] that what draws the bite
[1:36:42] that's what catches the bar that's
[1:36:46] what keeps the bite amen
[1:36:49] because she must be the word
[1:36:54] because of course the groom is the word
[1:36:59] the word must unite with the word
[1:37:03] it's not any word is the
[1:37:06] anointed word for the day
[1:37:10] the rest of the church will continue
[1:37:14] in the traditions
[1:37:17] in the church traditions
[1:37:20] in the name of the message in the name
[1:37:23] of christianity
[1:37:28] oh my god so today
[1:37:32] many have become legalists
[1:37:37] and all they have grabbed
[1:37:41] was you have to wear a long skirt
[1:37:46] don't cut your hair that's good
[1:37:50] pentecostal do that but
[1:37:53] when the word of god has taken its abode
[1:37:56] in your heart it's going to display
[1:38:00] the character of jesus christ
[1:38:04] it will teach you wife
[1:38:07] to be submissive to your husband
[1:38:11] amen amen husband love your wife
[1:38:16] and set every
[1:38:20] play everything in the right position
[1:38:23] [Music]
[1:38:27] the prophet said i'm close i see the
[1:38:29] time is gone
[1:38:31] it says
[1:38:35] how people were saying to to him that
[1:38:40] why you keep rebuking the ministers
[1:38:43] women don't teach them
[1:38:46] deep things you know how to to
[1:38:50] get in the spirit and
[1:38:53] you say how can i lay down
[1:38:56] the sacrifice when the altar is
[1:38:59] destroyed
[1:39:01] i must rebuild the altar first
[1:39:05] amen you must learn
[1:39:09] abc's first
[1:39:14] always believe
[1:39:17] christ when you get to that position
[1:39:21] where you can believe
[1:39:23] everything then you are in the position
[1:39:28] for the sacrifice to be laid down for
[1:39:30] the pill of fire to
[1:39:32] lick that the kindle that those wood
[1:39:38] praise be the name of the lord
[1:39:41] that's why god has
[1:39:45] kept that message that sacrifice
[1:39:49] so secret that no man will
[1:39:54] will know about it
[1:39:57] that third poll is between the bride
[1:40:02] and the groom nobody in between
[1:40:06] amen
[1:40:10] oh my my my but you see
[1:40:14] the word of god that has been quickened
[1:40:18] when it's revealed to your heart it's
[1:40:21] going to set you on fire
[1:40:24] nobody will be able to stop you
[1:40:28] not the preacher not the church not
[1:40:31] nothing because you have come on fire
[1:40:35] with the reality of of the
[1:40:38] genuine pentacles
[1:40:42] pentecost is not a denomination
[1:40:46] amen pentecost is a god in a man
[1:40:51] the pill of fire in your heart
[1:40:56] that's pentecost amen
[1:40:59] praise be the name of the lord
[1:41:04] but today
[1:41:08] we see the condition of the church
[1:41:11] we see laodicea showing its color
[1:41:17] maybe i sure with this as my last quote
[1:41:20] here
[1:41:21] i got something i would like to close
[1:41:22] with
[1:41:24] the prophet says this talking about
[1:41:27] elijah if i can found that
[1:41:31] i'm not well organized than my
[1:41:35] my pastor back there
[1:41:39] i wish i had this coat
[1:41:43] ready and we could read it together
[1:41:46] but didn't have much time for that but
[1:41:49] i think you trust me amen
[1:41:52] so let me go ahead and read something
[1:41:55] here and then we'll close
[1:42:00] my my my thank you jesus
[1:42:06] the prophet says in the church age
[1:42:09] let's see uh may not have it on me
[1:42:13] here well
[1:42:17] this is what the prophet says he says
[1:42:22] elijah the tishbite
[1:42:26] he preached for the showdown
[1:42:29] of mount carmon
[1:42:34] amen and john the baptist
[1:42:38] i sure have it and read it the way he
[1:42:40] says it let's see
[1:42:43] he says he came to the
[1:42:46] showdown of
[1:42:50] mount transfiguration
[1:42:53] and elijah of the last days
[1:42:57] amen his showdown is for the mount
[1:43:02] zion
[1:43:05] you see people can say anything they
[1:43:08] want to
[1:43:09] but there is a time when the showdown
[1:43:12] will be here
[1:43:14] for elijah the tishbite it was
[1:43:17] fire came down and approved who was
[1:43:21] white for john the baptist
[1:43:25] it was the mount transfiguration
[1:43:29] because john came and preached and
[1:43:32] introduced
[1:43:33] people said it was his cousin that's a
[1:43:37] family thing you see
[1:43:40] but it was the word of god
[1:43:44] god came down from heaven
[1:43:47] in the skies and here
[1:43:50] jesus with
[1:43:53] moses and elijah to his side
[1:43:58] and a voice it was not john's voice
[1:44:01] it was from heaven to prove
[1:44:04] that what john introduced
[1:44:07] was the truth
[1:44:10] amen behold my beloved
[1:44:14] son in whom
[1:44:18] i have pleasure to dwell
[1:44:21] in and stay
[1:44:25] heal ye him
[1:44:29] that was a god speaking
[1:44:33] back in john the baptist the
[1:44:36] pharisees may have argued all
[1:44:40] along all the ages but
[1:44:43] god came and spoke and vindicated him
[1:44:48] today it seems that everybody has
[1:44:51] something to say
[1:44:53] but there is a mount
[1:44:56] zion showdown coming
[1:44:59] where you are preaching the rupture i'm
[1:45:02] preaching the rapture
[1:45:03] who's going to go to the rupture that's
[1:45:06] what will tell and then you'll know
[1:45:09] oh that elijah was white
[1:45:12] that's the showdown miracle everybody's
[1:45:16] doing it
[1:45:17] amen even jesus said you will
[1:45:20] come in the last day and say i have
[1:45:23] preached
[1:45:24] i have moved the mountains i have
[1:45:27] prophesied
[1:45:28] i brought people to christ they say
[1:45:32] god help me i never knew you
[1:45:35] that's not a showdown the showdown
[1:45:39] is who is gonna go
[1:45:42] amen and
[1:45:45] the thing to get the people ready
[1:45:50] it's here that's the sacrifice
[1:45:55] jesus christ the same way
[1:45:58] john the baptist said behold the lamb
[1:46:01] of god who takes away the sins of the
[1:46:04] world
[1:46:05] there is another john amen
[1:46:09] is to introduce the messiah to this
[1:46:12] age the word of god
[1:46:15] amen jesus christ
[1:46:18] amen and then we'll know who's going to
[1:46:22] go
[1:46:24] god bless you i think i'll stop right
[1:46:26] here as i turn the

[1:53:30] [Music]
[1:53:35] [Applause]
[1:53:38] amen
[1:53:41] [Music]
[1:53:42] we just heard brother shane go mention
[1:53:44] on uh on sunday by challenging the
[1:53:46] message
[1:53:47] they're challenging the word he said
[1:53:49] those words exactly i believe i believe
[1:53:51] you said that exactly
[1:53:52] and we just heard our brother say it
[1:53:53] this evening i thought that was pretty
[1:53:55] pretty neat you see the lord said the
[1:53:57] same thing sunday and wednesday back to
[1:53:59] back
[1:53:59] um also i love how um
[1:54:04] god always makes things hard to see
[1:54:07] sometimes
[1:54:08] so the elect will catch it and others
[1:54:09] won't and our brother brought something
[1:54:11] out about that this evening
[1:54:13] how john the baptist imagine i mean we
[1:54:15] know what baptism is
[1:54:16] because we've been practicing it for
[1:54:18] years but imagine no one knowing what it
[1:54:20] is but just seeing a man
[1:54:22] dump people in the water back up they
[1:54:24] didn't have an understanding of it some
[1:54:25] did
[1:54:26] not all and some just did it because it
[1:54:27] was the right thing to do
[1:54:30] but and also jesus even in the bible he
[1:54:32] said drink my flesh
[1:54:33] eat my flesh and drink my blood and it's
[1:54:35] just these sayings would be so hard for
[1:54:37] the human ear to hear
[1:54:39] and some of what brother branham taught
[1:54:40] is so hard for the human ear to hear
[1:54:42] but it's the it's the word within us the
[1:54:44] word within the bride that's able to
[1:54:46] reach out and catch it
[1:54:47] and i'm so thankful for that
[1:54:50] it's going home time we're justified by
[1:54:55] faith
[1:54:57] it's going on time we're sanctified by
[1:55:01] the blood
[1:55:03] going old time we're full of the holy
[1:55:07] ghost
[1:55:09] it's going home time and the bride has
[1:55:13] rapturing fit
[1:55:15] oh it's going home
[1:55:17] [Music]
[1:55:28] it's going on time we're
[1:55:33] [Music]
[1:55:53] it's going on time
[1:56:04] amen how many enjoy the word tonight
[1:56:09] praise the lord amen
[1:56:13] brother my angel let me ask you a
[1:56:14] question how many of my sermons
[1:56:17] not my sermon but the sermon the holy
[1:56:19] ghost
[1:56:20] preached through me how many of them
[1:56:22] have you listened to
[1:56:27] the one i preached in brother matambas
[1:56:29] and here have you ever have a chance to
[1:56:31] listen to any
[1:56:37] okay long long long time ago and i
[1:56:41] didn't talk to him
[1:56:43] so you know what it means right
[1:56:46] right you know what it means right so
[1:56:49] that was not a man
[1:56:50] he was the holy ghost in simplicity
[1:56:53] picking up
[1:56:54] everything we preach here for 19 sermon
[1:56:58] 19 sermon and the holy ghost was
[1:57:00] catching catch and catching catching
[1:57:02] and putting them together again and
[1:57:05] presented to you
[1:57:06] just like it happened with brother
[1:57:07] mcgary
[1:57:09] so god is saying something
[1:57:12] he's with us amen
[1:57:15] you know brother abel asked me a
[1:57:17] question like probably
[1:57:19] a month or a couple months ago he
[1:57:22] mentioned that people has been
[1:57:23] challenging brother branham they say
[1:57:25] that uh because i tattle the theory
[1:57:29] the unchanging pattern of god
[1:57:32] god does not change and they say well
[1:57:36] elijah did not get married
[1:57:40] they say elisha did not get married john
[1:57:43] the baptist
[1:57:44] did not get married and elijah going to
[1:57:47] the jews who won't get married
[1:57:49] so brother brother got married so that
[1:57:52] means
[1:57:52] brother branham did not follow the
[1:57:54] pattern
[1:57:56] and they are mocking saying the
[1:57:58] unchanging pattern of god
[1:58:01] and i let it go i answer him personally
[1:58:05] but he came back again somebody sent it
[1:58:09] to someone from this church saying the
[1:58:10] unchanging
[1:58:11] pattern of god elijah got married elijah
[1:58:14] got married and this this
[1:58:16] i say well i believe i need to talk to
[1:58:18] my church
[1:58:20] and the people online that are for this
[1:58:22] church
[1:58:24] the bible says that elijah did miracle
[1:58:29] amen the bible says that elisha
[1:58:32] did miracle amen
[1:58:36] elijah going to the jews will do miracle
[1:58:39] but the bible said john the baptist did
[1:58:43] no miracle zero
[1:58:46] he broke the pattern but jesus christ
[1:58:49] came
[1:58:49] and said john the baptist he's elijah
[1:58:53] what are you gonna do with it
[1:58:57] are you gonna tell me because elijah
[1:59:00] because john the baptist did not do what
[1:59:02] the other did
[1:59:04] he is not qualified to be elijah
[1:59:09] brother branham said their argument is
[1:59:12] thinner like a broth
[1:59:16] that is made out of the shadow
[1:59:19] of a chicken starved to death
[1:59:25] it's not me i'm giving you a coat i can
[1:59:27] give you maybe 15 of them
[1:59:29] that's what brother branham say in other
[1:59:31] words it is very
[1:59:33] very unstable idea
[1:59:36] very unstable argument
[1:59:39] all you have to do is humble before the
[1:59:41] scripture
[1:59:43] rumble before the message just receive
[1:59:46] the message
[1:59:47] accepted and the holy ghost will back
[1:59:49] you up
[1:59:50] and lead you through don't try to take
[1:59:54] the word and challenge the revealed word
[1:59:56] you don't do that go back to the reveal
[1:59:59] word
[2:00:00] and it's going to show you your position
[2:00:02] in the written
[2:00:04] word that's what the pharisee did
[2:00:07] what are you going to do with it
[2:00:11] so since john the baptist did not follow
[2:00:13] what the other did
[2:00:14] let's throw out the bible you see now
[2:00:18] what about if i sit with you and i'll
[2:00:20] show you one scripture going this way
[2:00:22] another scripture going the other way
[2:00:24] what are you gonna do
[2:00:26] the bible says it's jeremiah that spoke
[2:00:29] you go there jeremiah didn't speak it i
[2:00:32] have it
[2:00:33] what are you gonna do
[2:00:36] whether jeremiah spoke or not i believe
[2:00:38] both
[2:00:41] this message is the truth there is no
[2:00:44] argument
[2:00:45] you can bring against this message
[2:00:47] because this message was
[2:00:49] perfectly line up with the scripture
[2:00:52] there is no message that is so
[2:00:55] thoroughly
[2:00:56] lined up with the bible like the message
[2:00:59] of brother branham
[2:01:00] none of them if you don't see it yet it
[2:01:03] doesn't mean it's the other
[2:01:05] maybe the holy spirit knows what he's
[2:01:06] doing he might bring a minister
[2:01:08] and the minister will catch it and
[2:01:10] explain it to you are you there
[2:01:13] praise the lord i'm not going to preach
[2:01:14] let's stand and we will be praying
[2:01:16] so i thought to mention that to the
[2:01:18] church those that are not here
[2:01:20] especially the young people because you
[2:01:23] have been attacked
[2:01:24] on facebook whatsapp bombarded like a
[2:01:28] war
[2:01:28] we're not in war we are here to prepare
[2:01:32] the people
[2:01:32] to the rupture if you don't believe it
[2:01:36] leave us alone respect our position
[2:01:41] i don't understand why is it hard we
[2:01:43] have friends that are baptist
[2:01:46] we have people we work with it that are
[2:01:48] methodists
[2:01:49] we don't argue they don't get here to
[2:01:52] find our fault
[2:01:54] we shake hands how are you doing how is
[2:01:56] your family doing that's fun
[2:01:58] they respect what we stand and we
[2:02:00] respect what they stand
[2:02:02] if the lord open up their eyes praise
[2:02:04] the lord but what we stand here
[2:02:06] is the message of malachi 4
[2:02:10] from kevor to caver are you there
[2:02:14] where he said karma we say comma you're
[2:02:17] a fanatic
[2:02:18] yes let's pray
[2:02:23] heavenly father lord we thank you for
[2:02:26] your grace for your love your mercy
[2:02:27] father
