the name of the Lord today is Wednesday if you would let's turn to our Bible Lord's willing brother Shan Martin will be with us this Sunday suay amen amen so you pray for the service and be under a great expectation am for the Lord to speak to us amen I believe you got the scripture for the seven battles with amalik amen praise the name of the Lord I tried to move with Esther and something came up I forc it he came up I said you know what I'm going to take it and preach it another time I went to work came back up again so I had to go home and put it back up again so if you are new to the message if you are new to this message just try to pay attention amen amen okay something that the Lord keep putting back putting back putting back and I believe somebody's in need of it yeah there could be somebody who watched something and he's in trouble and the Lord want to help you tonight amen Genesis chapter 47 those online if you're new in the message you can review this T three four times give me a call let's sit if you have question and we're going to go over over it I have quot I have scriptures but we're going to travel a little bit different amen amen Genesis chapter 47 can everybody see this board brother can you help me let's pull it up here my wife told me when you move back you're wasting minute so am so I want to make sure it's closed amen sorry honey thank you very much for the phone call the texes all the birthday wishes God richly bless you Genesis 47 verse 20 if you there you can say amen and Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh you might be seated so the entire land of Egypt was bought by Joseph can you forget somebody like Joseph brother Robert always betray me amen Joseph he bought the entire land of Egypt if somebody bought the entire United stat for the president are you going to forget someone like that will you after 20 years 40 years you going to forget somebody like that okay and Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh for the Egyptian sold every man his filled because the famine the famine Prevail over them so the land becames pharaohs so the entire land of Egypt belonged to Pharaoh may God grant you Grace to stay awake and as for the people this going to help you for Lifetime until the Rapture if you strugg go with the message and as for the people he removed them to the city from one end to the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof how can you forget somebody who's doing something like this only the land of the priest bought he not for the priest had a portion as sign them of pharaoh and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them wherefore they sold not their lands just like the priest in the Sanctuary they could uh transgress the Sabbath but nothing happened to them then Joseph said to the people behold I have bought you this day and your land for pharoh L here is seed for you and you shall swow the land and it shall come to pass in the increase that you shall give the fifth part to pharaoh and the fourth part shall be oned for seed of the field and for your food and for them of your household and for food for your little one in other word every time you have something that the the harvest the fif belong to Pharaoh so every single Pharaoh that's going to come in Egypt will benefit a tth because of Joseph can a president forget someone like that you receive a paycheck every day amen and when you receive that paycheck you say why do they always pay me this money they say they pay you this money because of Joseph that's right amen verse 25 and they say you have saved Our Lives let find Grace in the sight of my Lord and we will be Pharaoh servant and Joseph made it a law if it's a law that a thief be given to Pharaoh a fief be given to pharaoh and it's a law every rule that come in Egypt will always remember that law because it goes to his pocket amen over the land of Egypt to this day that Pharaoh should have the fifth part except the land of the priest only which became not pharaohs everybody clear Genesis chapter 50 where are you going Genesis 50: 24 everybody ready amen and Jose jph said to his Brethren I die and God will surely visit you and bring you out of this land to the land which he s to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob and Joseph took a oath of the children of Israel saying God will surely visit you and you shall carry up my bone from here this happened on The Exodus that's right if you need the scripture you see me when Moses was leaving the land of Egypt they took the bonds of Joseph in other word not only do we have a souvenir a memorial that Pharaoh receive a fifth part of uh the Harvest to his own money treasury we have a law in Egypt about Joseph who did some great might Works in Egypt but apart from that there was also a ccle AG in other word a casket in Egypt that was laying there of the body of Joseph and that casket brother Bram say was a memorial to the Jews that every time they going through suffering when they look at that casket they remember there is a promise that one of this day we're going to leave Egypt okay who can forget someone like that let's go to act chapter 177 everybody ready amen you didn't read EST we see when are we going to get there act 7:1 17 if you dare you can say Amen but when the time of the promise Drew n when it was time for God to fulfill his word that he promised to Abraham amen amen when the time of the promise Drew n which God has sown to Abraham the people grew and multiply in Egypt until another king arose another Pharaoh which knew not who how can you be a Pharaoh in Egypt and you don't know Joseph amen Joseph did this he brought the entire land to pharaoh Pharaoh is receiving a paycheck every day because of Joseph and it was a law in Egypt because of Joseph and we had a tomb as a memorial in Egypt because of Joseph but despite all these evidence yet someone arose that doesn't know Joseph amen how can you have all this evidence and you still deny Joseph amen the fact that Pharaoh did not know Joseph did not an know these evidence amen you can tell that Pharaoh we have a casket for Joseph he won't believe you amen you can tell that Pharaoh you receiving a paycheck because of Joseph the Pharaoh W not believe you you can tell that Pharaoh that Joseph bought the entire Land There is is a law in Egypt despite all of this all the souvenir all the memorial everything of the ministry of Joseph seems like it is completely denied no matter how many proof you can bring this Pharaoh will never acknowledge Joseph not because the message of Joseph is wrong not because what Joseph accomplished was not true but because someone just deliberately tooken his heart to reject the word and it happened because the time of the promise is near amen now if you talk to Pharaoh Pharaoh say I don't know Joseph who are you going to believe are you there are you going to believe Pharaoh no he's the king of Egypt what he said saying is the truth amen Pharaoh say no it never happened Pharaoh say I don't even know the man Joseph they say Pharaoh there is a tomb over there what are you going to do which evidence are you going to believe are you going to take Pharaoh amen are you going to take Pharaoh because there is a tomb in Jeffersonville let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you're doing for us father we thank you for giving us another opportunity to insist into these things and the power and the need and the necessity of the Holy Spirit Lord we are committing everything unto their hand may you seal the ever completely out of this place whether he's online under spying or whatever he's doing may you seal him completely out father may only the Holy Spirit be completely sealed in May you move me completely out of the way may you speak to your children tonight as we commit it all unto their hand in the name of Jesus Christ amen we are under the king as hes three feast and Esther two banquet part eight last Sunday on Sunday we spoke about hatack that's where we stop over there showing you that attack was the holy spirit because Esther had some difficulty decoding morai the first time he decoded morai as a mortal and morai refused and rejected the government until he used heart attack and when hatack came then morai unfold more his word his message message to Esther and Esther understood exactly what was going on so before we go back to her attack tonight if the Lord will give us Grace take second Peter chapter one I want you to pay attention amen second Peter I say first but it should be second second Peter chapter 1 I'm going to read the first time and I'm going to read the second time everybody ready second Peter chapter 1 verse one Simon Peter not first Peter second Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith so Peter here is talking to the believer that have received the baptism of the holy spirit because they have the the same Faith as Peter Peter was baptized with the holy spirit so Peter is speaking to Believers Believers that have the Holy Ghost yes sir amen amen everybody clear he's not talking to Pagan we fast through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ everybody clear job to verse 5 and beside this give all diligence the M BR message give all diligence add to your what so this believer had Faith amen if you go to the stature of a perfect man or Blasphemous name you will find that this firstam say it is what get you into the kingdom by a new birth amen because add to your faith this this this you must first be born again by the faith of Jesus Christ so the point I'm driving here is that Peter is talking to the believer that are baptized with the Holy Ghost the believer that already have the personal relationship the personal revelation of Jesus Christ everybody clear now let's go to verse 16 for we have not follow cunningly devised Fable in other word we have not follow stories that are fabricated we have not followed story that are made up that's what Peter is saying I'm going to read quickly and then we're going to come back for we have not followed cunningly devis Fable when we made known to you the power of and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but we were eye witness of his majesty for he received from God the Father honor and Glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased this is speaking about the mo Transfiguration everybody clear and this voice which came from heaven we heard we were with him in the Holy Mount we also we have also a more sure word of Prophecy where unto you do well that you take heed as to a light that shine in dark place until the day down and the day star or the Morning Star AR rise in your heart everybody clear now let's go back to verse 16 now and Backle up for we have not followed caringly devis Fable Peter is talking to the believer here and Peter is telling them what we have preached to you it is not something that was fabricated by someone it is not something that somebody made up it is not a story that someone just came up or conjur uh conjure up that story in his mind and came up and begin to tell you story we are not preaching fables no we are preaching the word of God Amen and Peter continue you he say when we made known to you the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but we were I witness of his majesty in other word Peter is saying we were there when those things happened we are witness of what we are preaching unto you we are not preaching unto you fabricated story we don't bring you a message that is wrong we bring you a message of a living Jesus Christ that came down and we were part of that message amen praise the name of the Lord number one Peter what are you trying to say for he receive from God the Father honor and Glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased so Peter is talking to the believer and he's telling them before he introduced something he say what we are preaching to you is not a fa and Peter begin first with the experience of more Transfiguration amen and we know that in more Transfiguration that's when the cloud came down and met the Lord Jesus Christ and Jesus when we ascended on Mon Transfiguration before even mon Transfiguration Jesus Jesus was born he preached his message but there came a time when Jesus have to go to a mountain and in that mountain that was the adoption of Jesus Christ so Peter is is rehearsing to us the adoption of Jesus Christ the part of the ministry when Jesus was adopted and it happened upon a mountain and in that mountain there was also a cloud and Not only was there a cloud in that mountain but Jesus Took with him three witness he took Peter he took John and he took also James everybody clear everybody clear so far praise the name of the Lord when you look at the scriptures superficially you're going to come up with a superficial understanding let's go to verse 18 and this voice which came from heaven he's talking about month Transfiguration we heard when we were with him in the holy month I was there that's the first element Peter is showing now the second element is this one what are you bringing up Peter everybody clear verse 19 we have also so Peter is saying in addition to this yes amen we have something beside this we had the experience on Mon Transfiguration where the cloud came down and it was the third po Ministry of Jesus Christ for Jesus to open the seals amen after this experience I want you to remember that something else also came out everybody clear what did come out we have also a more sure word of what in the word we have also a prophetic message that follow amen everybody clear number one you are not following that's the introduction caringly Fable first of all an experience happen on the mountain a cloud came down and there were three witness that were there when the cloud came down and that was the adoption or the coronation of the ministry of Jesus Christ after that experience there is also a prophetic message everybody following me praise the name of the Lord where un until you do well that you take heed everybody clear so you are paying attention to that message as to a light that shine in a dark place so there is Darkness somewhere and the prophetic message is the light amen you are holding onto the message like unto the light that is chining when everything is dark in loud aition amen but that message came before after there was an experience in the mountain everybody clear praise the name of the Lord as to a light that shine in a dark place until the day down until the end this message you have to hold on to that message until the day down until the darkness is finished until the coming of the Lord everybody there we clear so far number one there is an experience on the mountain number two there is a message that follow that message is your light you need to cling to that message just like the light for your Darkness everybody clear and you have to get stick to that message until the day down until Lisha is over until you see Jesus in the air everybody clear if you lose the message if you lose the prophetic message you are losing your light everybody clear amen until the day down and the what the day star or the Morning Star because when it's dark the start working but before the coming of the sun there is a um a bright star called the bright and the morning star that star usually tells you that the sun is coming up are you there so you hold on to the message all the way until the day break all the way until the coming of the Lord is coming are you there and when it's going to be the time of the coming of the Lord amen the day star or the Morning Star We rise everybody clear the day star or the Morning Star will rise in what in your heart now when you look at this scripture you must say well the rising of the Morning Star is when people receive the Holy Ghost no because Peter was already talking to the people that have the Holy Ghost amen Peter already was talking to the people that had Faith but he was telling them that an experience happened after the experience there is a prophetic message after a prophetic message before the coming of the Lord there will be a day star rising in your heart everybody understand me there will be a revelation that will come amen before the coming of the Lord Jesus am amen an experience happen in the mountain a message will follow that experience but there is an element that still have to run that element won't rise until the coming of the Lord is near everybody canar now we know that the seven Seal have a three-fold mystery to it okay that's why I say you need to pay attention Amen brother Bram said the six Seal have a three-fold mystery the six Purge the Earth remember the six seal purged the foolish virgin and the six seal also purged the 144,000 everybody clear brother Bram said that the seven seal also have a threefold mystery everybody clear brother Bram say the first mystery of the seven seal is called the seven tunders amen Amen brother Bram said the second mystery of the seventh seal is is called the third pool if you need coach you see me I'm trying to stay on the surface and the third mystery of the seven seal is called the coming of the Lord everybody tell whenever brother Bram speak about the seven Thunder he will tell you that the seven seal is revealed when brother Bram speak about the third pool he will tell you that the seven seal is revealed and every time brother Bram said that the seven seal is not revealed if you check those code Brother Bram always refer to the coming of the Lord amen so the seven seal is now revealed it's the coming of the Lord Brother Bram say because nobody is supposed to know the hour and the time that Jesus Christ is coming the message is always perfect with the Bible amen and brother bam say I reveal to you the seven Thunder I reveal to you the third pool but there is one element that I cannot tell you amen now let's start with the first element that is called the Thunder brother Bram says this but in the message Christ The Mystery of God R you brother Bram said but in the last day the reason there was such a tremendous things that he spoke by spoke about it off it here and show those what and what so the picture of the cloud that you see on Luke magazine brother Bram called that picture the seven tunders everybody clear Life Magazine then pack that Circle of a cloud and a light there that they could not understand and don't want to know it yet Amen Let Me continue again brother Bram the Life Magazine Park an article a Mystic light a Mystic circle of light goes up into the air above tuon and Phoenix in the same way that I told you near a year before he happened brother Bram prophesy about this cloud in 196 2 in the message sir what time it is so it is not something that was fabricated it is not something that was manufactured we have tips that are talking before the event happened but no matter how much proof you going to give there will be a pharaoh that would not recognize Joseph everybody clear no matter how many proof you going to show there won't be a pharaoh that will not recognize Joseph there will be a pharaoh that will deliberately ignore the evidence of Joseph everybody [Music] clear praise the name of the Lord in the same way that I told you near a year before it happened how it will be and like a triangle a pyramid the picture hangs in the church down there you that took that magazine heit just exactly if brother Bram never spoke about this before then you can say brother Bram is trying to claim something but brother Bram already prophesied and when he preached what is the attraction on the mountain B B I'm say Revelation 1017 now is a history it was a prophecy when I told you now that prophecy was fulfilled on sent Mountain it is no longer a prophecy it is now a history but our history is true it is not a fable it is a history that happen everybody C he appear they don't understand yet what happened he appeared mysteriously and went away mysteriously amen watch see brother who number one brother Fred S man brother who J Norman number two and number three standing there how many witness like he took on top of M everybody clear brother say we were three witness in the mountain just like Jesus took three witness on my Transfiguration hallelujah amen three Witness like he took up on the top of the mount Peter James and who to give witness stood there and watch it when it happened and seen it what were you there on Mon Transfiguration what is the proof that you have that it happened amen the proof of the cloud is more than even more Transfiguration because more Transfiguration you only see that in the Bible what is the picture of that clowd amen praise the name of the Lord so right here we find out that the coming of the seven Angel the coming of the cloud brother bam referred to that coming as the seven Thunder which is the experience on the mountain which is the adoption of brother Bram that absortion goes with the cloud and that absoption goes with the three witness following that what happened a prophetic message hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord notice the very same day when this messenger not when he start on but when he begin to do what declare his message see the first p what you need to preach with me the second pull what the third pull the what opening of the word the opening of the word the mystery revealed everybody clear the third pool was the opening of them seven to reveal the hidden truth that has been seal in the what is the attraction on the mountain so I got my man set on this water that is the what so the message is the third po after the Thunder follow the third po after the month experience follow a sure word of Prophecy or a prophetic message Peter was giving you the three element of the seven seal everybody clear let that soak we can r with this but remember all this time Noah was in the ark the bride is sealing with Christ the last member has been revealed the six seal has produced itself the seven seal do as what bring him back to what so we found out that seal bring the Thunder that seal bring the third pool and that seal bring us so what the coming of the Lord the lamb come and took the book out of the right hand of him and sat down and claim what he own what he had with him that's right it's always been that third pool now do you notice on the opening of this seven seal it is also a three-fold mystery this one I have the Thunder will speak and have spoke that is the mystery of the seven Thunder the seven thunder in heaven will unfold this mystery watch it shall be what right there the coming of what Christ say no one knew what will everybody clear so even though the seven seal broke and brought the seventh thund and brought the third pool the opening of the word there is still an element that is still lingering yes sir that element won't open until at the coming of the Lord to tell you when the Lord is coming amen if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you going to know when the Rapture will take place amen but that element won unold until the time come this one is unfold to you this one is UNF to you but the Morning Star have still to rise later to give you the revelation of the time the Messiah is coming to pick you up Hallelujah hallu but to the church the bride the Rapture is what yes the third element the morning star or the day star will rise in your heart when the day down everybody there then there will be a revelation that will be given to you that Jesus Christ is coming that's when the last element of the seven seal open up to take us into the [Music] air Hallelujah to the brde the Rapture is a revelation to her it is revealed to her that the Revelation the True Blood of Christ will be what we are waiting because the Morning Star will rise one day you follow [Music] now we be what waiting for the of the what that's your third element here so Peter gave you the first element of the the first mystery of the seventh SE the second mystery of the seventh SE and the third mystery of the seven H Hallelujah here it is total inhalation is coming to the whole world but before that the inhalation take place the Church of Jesus Christ will go in the to meet the what is the Morning Star to do why is the morning start rising up in your heart what makes the star so bright at that time it is the approaching of the the Morning Star is reflecting the light of the everybody everybody so when it's going to come time that the Rapture will come there will be a revelation that will begin to Break Forth in your heart amen the word will become more clear and clear and clear until suddenly you going to begin to see your loved one amen all the men made theology all the cold formal indifferences were dried up but that Watchman who is that Watchman sitting Yonder on the tower Mori brother Bram with the Morning Star he has the seven seal will we ref the true message of the Lord Jesus Christ soon to what to approach because he brother and brother all the time as the sun begin to what to as the Lord begin to come something will happen in Your Heart A Day star will open up in your heart to give you the last element of the seven seal amen blessed be the name of the Lord that is is exactly what is coming to pass now it's just before day the morning star has come out to do what so when you have that Revelation automatically it's telling you Jesus is coming amen it is a signal for you that Jesus is coming we have to preach these things so you expect them amen and the Holy Spirit showing its light it's coming a Time when the light and the Darkness we have to be what separ brother able separating time one from the other church and its order will take the order of the day and Christ and his light word promise will go into the that is the only thing that is that is the only thing that is for them to do it's a day today it is the the dawn of new day for many who are looking for his amen I spoke to you about the picture of the $1 brother Bram never say look at the $5 bill he never say look at $100 bill he say look at $1 bill if you look at $1 bill I told you I'm shooting differently amen they all two sons here there is a pyramid on the east side on the west side with an eye and a Capstone over there and on the Easter side I spoke about this just touch it a little bit there is a eagle on the other side everybody clear when you look over there it is showing brother bam called this the Great Seal and it's called in the United States the Great Seal and We Know by the message of the hour that the Great Seal is speaking about the seventh seal which is bringing the Capstone and that Capstone in the shape of a pyramid is the constellation of the seven Angel which is called the seven Thunders everybody clear everybody so far praise the name of the Lord now in that image of there there is a light because the message coming is the evening light remember there is a prophetic message that is the light you need to hold on to it in the darkness of laia until Jesus come until the revelation of the Rapture unfold to you then we going into the Rapture everybody clear so it's the evening light that eye brother bam say that it's the eye of God and we know in the Book of Revelation that the lamb have seven eyes everybody clear which is speaking about the spirit of God everybody clear if you look down here there is a uh Enlighten phrase here that say novel or seclorum which mean new world order so when the Capstone is coming the Capstone is coming to establish a new world order because the seven seal will also AER the Millennium if you remember the image of Daniel when the stone came the stone never hit the head the stone hit the feet which is the Roman Empire that is not under Pagan Rome but unto peer Ro and he destroys the image and this Stone begin to grow and take over bringing the New Order of the world everybody clear bringing the Eternal Kingdom but when you go on the other side you going to see that there is an ego that ego have a scroll that is open because on Sunset Mountain it is the Fulfillment of Revelation 10 and in Revelation 10 when the mighty Angel come down he come with an open book an open scroll everybody clear then they gave the scroll to brother Bram they told him go back east the event happened on the west side but the preaching the scroll in the mouth of the Prophet will be preached on the east side a Jeffersonville would Pharaoh believe this one amen the scroll which speak about the open scroll or the open book on the scroll there is also a saying that say PR it means out of many one so the message of this ego is not a specific message follow me carefully we told you that Paul preaching part AR preaching part and we told you that the reason why the seven Chamberlain are sent because every angel that work with the messenger must be there to bring the left over of Paul the left over of arenus the left over of colba the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun and the light of that sun will be like the light of how many days so it's a message that pick up many and make one out of many out of seven Angel come one message [Applause] brother R help me this great warrior has come on the scene such as arenus and Martin St Martin and polycarp and the different ones and Luther and Wesley all of them as how they have come and just live long enough to kind of bring the light and shment but they left many things what in darkness Along come the Pentecostal age like the Lutheran age and they run out on lims but still all right don't say they was not right brother Bram acknowledge that the message of Luther the message of wesle the message of all other people that preach their message are right but they left some loose end brother Bram could not reject the message because you was still the Holy Ghost you need to refocus how you understand the message amen but still all right don't say they was not right they were in other word I acknowledge them I acknowledge nox I acknowledge fin I acknowledge this one okay but there is loose end left that can be explained but then why the seals has been broke to thoroughly reveal what these things are in other words my message of the seven seal pick up the L end and bring one message out of many comes one everybody clear brother Bram now you see I'm not just making that up it's not a fable it is that save the Lord I shall read it to you out of the book The Sing of the seven Angel message the mystery of God should be finished that's been declared by his holy prophet that is the prophet who has wrote the word and the sing of the seven Angel seven Church AG the last Church AG all the what losing that through these ages has been what brother bam say this mystery were probed they were preached by people and it will be War up together out of many comes one the lamb was breaking the seals and God's seal was not going to reveal it he was left for the last day we had Syble and we were prob at that so before brother bam come God already left the Book of Revelation in sble so any preacher can come look it up and the Holy Spirit can show you something and you preach but you're not going to preach the entire truth everybody say he said and they done what brother Bram didn't say they did bad they done very good sometime but we know it's moving right on but now in the last day we can look back and see where he has been and that is supposed to be done that at the end of the church age just before the Rapture so what brother Bram is telling you here that there were people that preached before him and brother bam acknowledge that those people were right sometime but they just have loose end and my Ministry is to pick up those Len and correct them and give you a full word let me read galatian 2 you can read it at home verse 1 and two this is Paul Paul met the pillar of fire Paul went into Arabia he preached uh he stayed there three years he came back and Paul begin to preach the gospel everybody here now when Paul was preaching the gospel they begin to record the gospel of Paul when Paul preach in celissia Leo and G are there they are recording the message of Paul everybody clear when Paul preach in Arizona somebody will call the message of Paul when Paul preach in North Carolina somebody record the message of Paul so after 14 years after follow me very good I went up to what so Paul after preaching 14 years he said you know what I heard that there are some believer over there I just need to go meet with the big guys that preach the gospel before me everybody there and I went up by Revelation and communicated unto them I spoke with them I met nox I met finny I met sanki I met Luther I met Wesley and I begin to talk to them everybody there that gospel which I preach among the so Paul heard the gospel he was preaching but when Paul went after 14 years to Jerusalem the those in Jerusalem were also preaching the gospel but they never seen each other in jerus they recorded Peter they recorded bemy they recorded Thomas you follow me but privately to them which were of what the big preacher of Jerusalem I preach 14 years I don't know what Peter is preaching Peter also is preaching he doesn't know what Paul is preaching now Paul and Peter [Music] Peter have his steps Paul has his steps Peter have his books Paul has his books Let's by any mean I should run and head run in V Paul preach preach preach preach he say wait a minute let me check the guys that started before me make sure that we are still ling up together everybody clear everybody clear no no no no no no no no those guys have their message and Paul has his message so Paul message and the message logically it must be different we don't want anybody to copy one another are you there I don't know why the Holy Spirit wants somebody to be re adjusted if you watch crazy stuff but one of those who seems to be somewhat the big one amen whatsoever they were he makes no matter to me Paul is arrogant so he mean none of those preacher Peter say he should have said I remember Peter with respect oh James oh John you were the one sleeping with Jesus Oh John he say no matter who they are I'm reading to you the Bible okay God accepted no man's person for they who seems to be somewhat in conference added what so when Paul went to Jerusalem after 14 years if you take the sermon of Paul you following me and you take the sermon of Peter Paul was the biggest plist there is let me repeat it again are you there when you go to Jerusalem they give you the message of John they give you the message of James they give you the message of Peter you begin to read the book of Peter and if you go take the sermon of Paul and you put them together it seems like Paul was repeating them away with the message of Paul Paul was a plist Paul was copying other the people message uhhuh that's right okay right okay if you are there and you listen to PA 14 years you listen to the tape of Paul you listen to the book of Paul you read the book of Paul then let their on someone come from Jerusalem and say sister the brid your PO he's a copy cat he was already speaking Peter preached this 20 years before him look at the book you open what Paul preached and what P pre same [Music] thing you know what Paul say what I preach I receive them by what now who are you to say that the revelation of Paul was a copy of [Music] you see now brother Bram was copying people that we have books that are word to word what bam say he receive a revelation we go we find someone who preach word for word what Paul preach was word for word what Peter preach amen amen are you there that's not Corona vaccine it's a different vaccine amen and now the things I want you to notice what taking place if you listen to the tape of what time it is Sir you will notice that one Angel was very notable to me the rest of them the the worst of them just seem what why were they ordinary Paul preached 14 years Paul went to Jerusalem they bring him the sermon of the Apostle nothing word that the Apostle had could add something to Paul matter of fact Paul corrected Peter am everybody here now when brother Bram enter into the constellation brother Bram seen seven Angel the angel that work with Paul the angel that work with arus the angel that work with Columba the angel that work with Luther the angel that work with Wesley brother Bram goes through the first one he said this is the one Paul preach he look nothing new that's right arus nothing new Hallelujah Columba nothing new who's it Martin nothing new Luther nothing new who else the Pentecostal nothing new there was only one who had his chest up that brother Bram attention was given to him that was the message of brother Bram those things Luther did not have them are you there that's why Paul say I went to Jerusalem nothing new no good news yes we were preaching the same thing amen but Peter say that Paul is preaching certain things that are difficult to understand Hallelujah are you there when brother enter the constellation he said nothing is new but when he preach his sound is different V Bram did a plagarism go away with Paul everybody clear you look at that eag has a b Eagle which is the white the Supreme I'm going to move quickly now we found out that from the West toward the East the West that's where the tunder happen toward the East that where the preaching happened of the message of the seven seal and the angel told him go east and preach the seven SE so your dollar bill was telling you about the cloud and your dollar bill was telling you about the preaching in Jeffersonville but we have the cloud we have the preaching in Jeffersonville your doll Bill cannot tell you this because that is always a secret Amen in God we do what how many God do we see [Applause] there are you there are you [Applause] there it is constantly unrolling itself from the very things happen to the picture being Jesus standing looking at us the cloud and now exactly on Sunset what and the sunset the evening light has come God have vindicating himself what is it it is the fact that God and Christ are what your Cloud speak about the de of Jesus Christ in God we trust how many God one here oh Israel the Lord your God is what all of this must be in $1 bill [Applause] Hallelujah despite all of this we Pharaoh recognize Joseph are you there the seven Thunders are there the third pool the opening of the word but the dollar bill cannot tell you about the coming of the Lord he have to be omitted Hallelujah they experience on the mountain the prophetic message and the day star we don't know we got to wait till the rapture the seventh Thunder the third pool opening the seven seal the coming of the lord we got to wait until it happen the dollar B unfold this unfold that he cannot unfold that one because it's a secret of the seven SE your two one were open but not the third one this one this one this one all line up together like this amen am what time is it hallelujah praise the name of the Lord amen I don't know let me touch something then we got to go because it's Wednesday when we spoke about Esther let's go back to First Peter uh second Peter chapter 1 I thought I'm going to get into this if you hear somebody coming with crazy things he copies somebody word by word Paul was the most greatest plist is you calling the holy spirit pluris amen that's the spirit sometime that came upon the Apostle Jesus preached somebody heard him he goes He begin to cast out devil and the Apostle say uhuh he's not with us in other word the Revelation must come this way not over there Jesus say if he is for me how can he be against me how can I reject what lther preach how can I reject what w preach how do you expect me to say what he preach is wrong the only problem is Luther could preach justification but he was smoking that's right when I come and preach that cigarette must come out that's right that's the difference that's amen second Peter chapter 2 1:2 we were on verse 19 we have also a more sure word of Prophecy where unto you you do well that you take heed as to a light that shine in a dark place until the day down and the day star arise in your heart the Revelation for the rupture now this is where we getting with hat knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any prate what why is not of a Propet interpretation verse 21 for the prophecy came not in no time by the will of who but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by what if the prophet were speaking by the Holy Ghost for you to understand the prophet you need to get in contact with the Holy Ghost it is the lack of holy ghost that we see happening in the message amen you don't understand the prophet because you don't have the Holy Ghost amen Esther first L at Modi and he thought there was something natural until he sent this man by the word by the name of hatak which was the spirit of Truth and we refer to you that mod sometime it's the messenger and sometime is also the message the messenger and the message brother Bram we found out that when a man comes sent from God ordained of God with the truth that say the Lord the message and the messenger are one and the because he said to represent th the Lord word by word so he and his message is the same thing then when a man comes with that say of the Lord he and his message is one when Elijah come with that say of the Lord he and his message become one just as Jesus when he come he was the word St John one so the word of God and the messenger of the age was the S same thing all the time that is what right I'm going to skip this for the sake of time are you there so attack we seen it on Sunday that he was to of the Holy Spirit brother what I'm saying the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be over iniz amen Revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize lack of revelation will make you reject the message oh yeah will make you reject the prophetic message but the prophetic message is your light in darkness amen now I'm not talking about this book of Revelation and you I'm talking about all the Revelation it is tremendously important to the church that's why we need the Holy Ghost he that have near let him hear what the spirit say unto the churches it may be that what we hear this what word the message and do what you going to hear the T and read the message but how many will pay heed to them are you there that we do not know but he who learned his ear and want to know the word of what the message will find the what attack enlightening if your ear is open to the word the spirit of God will make the word now that is the work of the can teach you the truth but if you don't open your ear to hear it and your hard to receive it you won't get the that's why you can listen to tap for years and never have the Revelation you can preach intellectually and never have the Revelation are you there brother randam say let me skip something quickly oh my God all right I believe the church is beginning to hear the message and beginning to understand we got to lay in the presence of the son we got to be ring our faith is now up intellectually we are hearing the message that God gave us and seeing the son that he showed and proving it by the Bible it's there how the church need to lay in the until he tenders up you know and get sweet in the spirit so he can bir down but when the church once gets it the elect is called out and separated then in the presence of God I know it shall be something like the people was there when it takes it what Rapture you can receive the message intellectually but you need to be there brother bam say there is two church one of them was born in AA and the other was born in Pentecost one has always been against the other we have come through the church ages to prove it one is against the other one of them is a fine dignified intellectual church with fine scholar the other is a class of a bunch of holy rolling one of them is what scient scientific I want to prove the other one is what one is scientific Arrangement the other one is spiritual discernment of the word that's the two take John chapter one uh chapter 20 I'm going to go quickly and finish have to skip a lot take John chapter 20 everybody okay yes John chapter 21 verse 24 if you dare you can say Amen John chapter 20 let's go to 20 John 20 verse 25 let me go there everybody there the other disciple therefore said to him we have seen the Lord go back to 24 that was John 20 24 but Thomas one of the 12 called Theus was not with them when Jesus came the other disciple therefore said to him we have seen the Lord but he said to them except as see what in his hand the what the prin of the nail he always look for proof okay they told him it happen uhuh I need to see proof the nail and TR my hand in hiside I will not what and after 8 days again his disciple were within and Thomas with them then came Jesus and the door being shut and stood in the midst and said peace be with you then say he to Thomas which here your finger and behold my hand and which here your hand and Trust in trust it in to myad and be not faithless by what believe and Thomas answer and said to him my Lord and my he now have the revelation of the deity verse 29 Jesus said to him Thomas because you have what seen me seen me you have believed blessed are they that have not what but they do [Music] what amen you want to proof you want to proof you want to proof let's go to Matthew 21 28 and let's shake you up a little bit and you go home everybody there verse two and behold there was the earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and roll back the Stone from the door and start upon it everybody clear his countenance was like lightning and his Remnant white as snow everybody clear verse four and for fear of him the keeper which was the god did shake and became as what everybody clear so far Jesus resurrected the soldiers saw it they fell dead and they woke up everybody clear job to verse 11 watch now now when they were going behold some of the watch came into the city the soldier and show to the chief priest all things that were done what did they tell the chief priest the angel came down and Jesus resurrected okay they were witness they saw it jum to verse 12 and when they were assembly with the Elder and they had taken Cel they gave what large money to the soldier saying say you his disciple came by night and stole him away while we slept do you know why they gave that saying because the open womb tomb was still there yes so to bring doubt to the tomb they have to make a story that the soldier the disciple stole him because if you go to this the disciple you say did Jesus rise the disciple say yes show me the proof the empty tomb yeah the FY understood they say let's give another version to the empty tomb and say when they show you the empty tomb bring another story that they disciple stole it how many proof do you need Pharaoh will not accept it jump now to verse uh to verse 15 so they took the money and did as were taught and this saying is what reported among the Jews until what let me ask you a question which version then will you believe amen the disciple the proof is all is only one we only have one tomb for Jesus do you follow me let me take a little bit of your time we only have one Tomb of Jesus but two version of the one tomb yes the first virgin Jesus is risen the second virgin the Jesus never rose again he was the disciple that stole his body if you were in Israel what will you believe we have one picture in Life Magazine watch it's only the military are you there someone say it is the seven angel that came to visit me somebody El say it is the air force that shoot the rocket who are you going to believe who are you going to believe who are you going to believe brother Steven he gave a different version here then here brother bam say something different then here brother bam say something different it is not consistent no problem no problem no problem let's go to Matthew 28 verse1 verse one in the end of the Sabbath as he begin to down toward the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the seil let me see Lord help me and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from Heaven how many Angel descended from [Music] Heaven just give me a few minutes so we can knock this devil out amen amen I was not intending going this rout but the Holy Spirit keep bringing back to me maybe somebody was struggling according to Matthew how many Angel was in the Tomb one Angel who was the angel of the Lord that's what the Bible say right amen the angel of the Lord that's Matthew's version okay young people get it Rob back his countenance was like like me and his wom white as right verse 5 and the angel answered and said to the women fear not you for fear not you for I know that you seek Jesus which was what crucified how many angels spoke to the women one Angel and that was only the one angel that spoke to the women that is the first version of Matthew everybody clear let's go to Mark let's see what Mark say Mark brother stepen brother Bram say he thisam say here this it is not the same thing it is not logical that's right let's go to Mark 16 bear with me I got to kill this devil and I don't have to come back on this foolishness let's go to Mark Mark 16 everybody there verse one and when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene same story and Mary the mother of James and Solomon has brought sweet uh sweet spices that they M come and anoint him everybody there and very early in the morning first day of the week they came to the Seer the rising of the Sun and they said among themselves who shall roll away the Stone from the door of the Seer and when they look they saw that the stone was wed away for he was very great so far we good verse 5 and entering into the in Matthew did Mary did the women enter in the SE the Bible say the angel was outside sing it must be consistent logical thank you Lord okay okay now it end in into the sep not outside they saw a what young young man sitting on the Matthew say outside sitting on the stone Mark say inside a young man sitting on the right side one young man one young man sitting on the right side it must be logical it must be consistent go to Luke 24 Luke 24:1 if you dare you can say amen amen amen now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning same thing they came to the Seer bringing this passes which had which he had prepared and certain had with them and they found the stone roll away from the seil thing and they enter in oh yes this quote is close to mark because this one enter but the quote of Matthew uh that might be a human mistake that might be human uh part the human part of Matthew right let's go and it came to pass as they were much perpect this is uh verse four about this behold what according to Luke there were how many men why do you still believe the Bible why do you still believe the Bible now who's saying the truth what should I preach to the people should I preach to them the version of Matthew should I preach to them the version of Mark or should I preach to them the version of Luke which version do you want me to preach it is not logical it is not consistent I cannot put my faith on something that is not logical give me Grace let me let me put even a a tombstone on this devil let's go to John 20 John tell us what you think now we John John did Matthew have the Holy Ghost Mark have the Holy Ghost Luke have the Holy Ghost John had the Holy Ghost were they all disciple did they all walk with Jesus Christ where is this discrepancy coming from because it was the Holy Ghost that inspired them that's right [Music] so do you want to say the Holy Ghost was making mistake no no no no no no the Bible is have some human part now who are you to show me which part is human and which part is not human it was not meant to wias it was meant to believe John chapter 1 20 verse 1 the first day of the week come Mary Magdalene early when he was yet dark to the SE oh when he was yet dark they say over there the rising of the Sun and SE the stone taken away from the sep yes this one this quote work this quote work then she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and said to them they have taken away the Lord out of the sep what did Mary say Mary see they don't say anything here so Mary went to the tomb she didn't see the body she goes out but somebody say they saw the angel of the Lord this one say they saw a young man this one say they saw two men John [Music] say let's go to verse 11 amen but Mary stood outside of the sep weeping and as she wept she stoop down and look into the sep and she sees what what are you going to believe what are you going to believe according to John Mary went into the tomb saw nothing run back and came back again saw two Angel according to Mark when they went they saw someone oh yeah according to look when they enter they saw two people who are you going to believe who are you going to believe go to act chapter 9 and you finish I'm sorry I took my time I just want to nail [Music] this you think the pattern of the message will be different am do you think the message will be different and do you expect to be different I can I can sit with you at home and give you this and give you this until your head spin act 9:3 are you there that's right brother Robert he got it already and as he Journey he came near Damascus and suddenly there shine R about him a light from what now let me jop down to verse 8 to save time and so arose from the earth and when he his eyes were open he saw no man but they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus let me see I'm trying to get it okay let me drop let me go back to verse four and he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying so so to him so so why persecute that me and he say who are th Lord and the Lord say I am Jesus whom you persecute it is hard for you to kick against the Pricks and he trembling and a ston say Lord what will you have me to do and the Lord said to him arise and go into the City and he shall be told you what you must do watch verse 7 and the man which Journey with him stood what hearing what but seeing what according to Paul saying to us they explaining as according to act n the man heard the voice right yes but see [Music] what do you believe Paul have the Holy Ghost Paul is talking about the experience between him and Jesus that's right okay the experience between him and the pillar of Fire when he tell about that experience Paul says that the man heard the voice but they saw no man the one that were with him the Bible say Paul was filled with the spirit and Paul say if anybody preaches something different than me call him a curse you ready yes let's go to act 22 and then we finish act 22 verse 6 this is Paul giving his testimony before King agria if I'm not mistaken everybody there verse 6 and it came to pass that as I made my journey and was come near to the Mascus about noon suddenly they Shone from Heaven a great light around about me and I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me what so so what persecute me you me and I answer who are you Lord and he said to me I am Jesus of Nazareth whom you persecute thank you brother Steven you see this one line up this one is perfect with what Paul Paul say here Paul say here it is consistent chill out let's continue verse n and they that were with me so indeed what act 22 they saw what Saw the Light here they saw what okay they heard the voice they saw here they saw something okay and they that were with me so indeed delight and were afraid but they heard what can you read with me can you read loud but they heard not the voice of him that do you believe Paul why do you believe somebody who cannot give his testimony [Music] right I'm asking you a question do you believe Paul do you think this is a contradiction you need the Holy Ghost you see Paul give a testimony there keep the testimony there let's just believe him that is the death stroke to Satan when a man takes God at his word brother that shall kill Satan every time that is the hardest hitting that Satan can get when a man will take God at his word let's [Applause] stand you cannot follow God with your brain you cannot follow this message with your brain you cannot even believe the Bible with your brain what I showed you that doesn't mean there is a contradiction there is no contradiction everything is lined up perfectly when the Holy Ghost come then he begin to show you why is moreai behaving this way why is moreai doing this way you need a ATT attack you need a contact with the Holy Ghost then the message won't be intellectual the message will be a revelation if I show somebody that I showed you here they're going to be rejecting the Bible why do you still believe the Bible there is many of stuff like this David the seven David the eight what are you going to do why is not the Bible consistent amen what do you need Church stop watching all kind of stuff on the internet yes sir and bringing question and question amen amen if somebody don't believe the message don't even waste your time don't go trouble your mind and trouble your faith the hour is late watch what you watching on YouTube there are many good message preacher in YouTube you can listen and be encouraged but stop watching foolishness because the wisdom of God is foolishness to the world stop watching whatever you watch the eye is the gate to the soul don't open your eyes or your ear to whatever don't be too curious you already got the message you already got the Bible stay with the [Music] message amen if you go put yourself in trouble you are responsible for it as a shepherd stay I am commending you to the Bible and the [Music] prophet I am commending you to the Bible and the prophet Heavenly Father Lord I'm sorry I took a little bit the time but father you impress this so hard I don't know who watch what I don't know who was struggling somewhere I don't know who needed to be stabilized in a certain area because the enemy attack in a different way trying to bring intellectualism in the message Lord father you spoke to us in your Prophet that this word is not to be reason out this word is to be believed to be taken just as it is and to move on Lord father how can we follow a God that re Mana from Heaven how can we follow follow a God that open the Red Sea and we have to believe that the Red Sea actually ped together and the people walk in dry gland how can a human man receive that how can a human man conceive that a virgin can give birth how can a human man conceive that a leper can be cleansed and have a skin like a baby how can a human Bond believe that you can take bread and multiply that how can we how how can we even Phantom that in our mind if it not by Revelation Hebrews chapter 11 you say by Revelation by Revelation by Revelation by Revelation and you spoke to us tonight Lord that Revelation is a work of the Holy Spirit father May the Holy Spirit drop down to each member each family of this church everybody listening Lord father under this voice may you granted unto them Grace Lord to be connected with the Holy Spirit to have their own personal revelation their own personal post post anchor in their soul that they can rest despite the wave despite the difficulty despite every doubt the devil is trying to S to send Lord because you say that Lord father it will be so close to deceive the elect if it were possible father we commit this church unto the hand Lord father may you bless them Father help them Lord father and direct everything and we commit the uncoming service unto their hand and we thank you for everything in the name of Jesus Christ amen thank you for your time God bless you Church [Applause] [Music] amen amen I had a scripture here I was going to read and brother Stephen I want you to listen because if I'm wrong I want you to you to correct me but in uh Matthew 12:40 uh Jesus said for as Jonah was in the as Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth but then Through the Bible talks about how Jesus was died on the evening before the Sabbath and was raised on Resurrection Sunday morning so that is not three days three nights so I might not have an understanding of that but I don't need an understanding of that you know what I mean we'll understand these things better by and by I'm not going to let that pull me away from believing the Bible I'm not going to let the other things that seem to be a discrepancy keep me from believing the Bible just the same as I'm not going to let these things that seem to be conpany keep me from believing the message if I have a problem like if I'm going to believe that in the Bible God spoke through a donkey to one of his prophets how much how is it hard to believe in the cloud it's these things I I tell you what like it's the same God is the same yesterday today and forever the way he was back then he's the same now he's going to leave these confusing things because it's for the elect it's for a chosen people and we can look past and we might not have a clear understanding but we can look around that and look to God cuz we know that it's the word it's the word his word doesn't change so I might not have an answer for Matthew 12:40 and brother Stephen I don't know if you do or not but if you do I would love to hear it but I don't need an answer for it I don't need an answer if it was three days three nights if it was two and a half days if it was one and a half day it doesn't matter cuz you know what Christ Rose that's all that matters so we don't want to get hung up on the mistakes of a man as far as William brandom but we just want to believe the truth the word that comes through it so I mean that's that's enough for me brother Stephen I appreciate this evening that was that was a masterpiece and we'll just sing the song as y'all are dismissed this night tonight oh so I'm casting all my cares on you all my cares oh I know you love me oh yes you love me Redemption by Blood amen by his blood that's the greatest of story thank you Lord oh when for restoration for Redemption that's what seven angels in the testify my redeemer is no longer dead he's risen he's alive and he's coming back for you and me just cast all your cares on him oh so I'm casting all my cares on you oh I know you love me amen thank you Lord and it's Redemption by Blood Redemption by his blood that's the greatest of story amen thank you Lord and it's for restoration for Redemption that's what seven angels in the cloud testify my redeemer's no longer dead he's risen he's alive and he's coming back for you and me y'all are dismissed this evening one more time and so I'm casting all my cares on you on you Lord
