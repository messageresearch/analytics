[26:00] boaz commanded his young man
[26:03] saying let her glean even among the
[26:06] sheaves
[26:07] and reproach her

[26:16] and late fall also some of the handful
[26:20] of purpose for her so she's not the only

[26:24] but god is working through the reapers
[26:27] and leave them that she may glean them
[26:30] and rebuke her not

[27:42] verse 25 if you dare you can say amen

[27:50] when they have found him
[27:52] on the other side of the sea

[27:57] when when
[27:59] came you here amen
[28:01] jesus answered and said verily verily i
[28:04] say unto you you seek me
[28:06] not because you saw the miracles because
[28:10] the miracles were for a purpose
[28:12] but because you did it
[28:15] of the loaves and where
[28:17] fell
[28:18] amen
[28:19] that was natural food
[28:22] verse 27
[28:24] lab or not
[28:25] you understand roof laboring now
[28:28] labor not for the meat which perishes
[28:31] but for the meat which endureth
[28:34] unto everlasting life so roof has to
[28:37] work she has to labor for food
[28:40] amen
[28:41] which is a type of eternal life amen
[28:44] which the son of man this food is given
[28:47] by the son of man
[28:50] and we know boaz
[28:51] is a type of christ
[28:54] and christ is the son of man
[28:58] amen
[28:59] blessed be the name of lord which the
[29:02] son of man

[29:17] roof go ahead and glean
[29:20] you the reapers give her food but you

[29:27] work for it
[29:28] amen
[29:30] hallelujah
[29:31] for him has the father sealed
[29:36] then say dead to him
[29:38] if you want to know where the seal of
[29:39] the father is you got to go through the
[29:41] son of man
[29:43] then say day to him what shall we do
[29:46] that we might work the works of god
[29:50] amen jesus answered and say to them this
[29:54] is the work of god singular that you do
[29:56] what
[29:57] on whom on him whom he has water so
[30:01] everything the best is the foundation of
[30:04] everything is faith
[30:08] if the foundation the beginning is wrong
[30:10] everything else is going to be out of
[30:12] place amen let's go to philippians
[30:14] chapter 2.
[30:17] few wins the folks out don't know where
[30:19] they are
[30:25] philippians 2
[30:27] if you dare you can say amen verse 12
[30:32] wherefore my beloved
[30:34] as you have always done what
[30:38] everybody care
[30:40] not as in my presence only i don't want
[30:43] hypocrisy
[30:44] but now much more in my absence
[30:47] everybody here
[30:48] paul is speaking uh
[30:50] he's talking about the obedience when
[30:53] he's not around
[30:55] because they want to test the obedience
[30:57] of roof
[30:59] anybody care
[31:01] when boaz is not iran
[31:06] everybody care
[31:08] in the absence of boaz what do you do
[31:11] amen
[31:14] but now much more in my absence work out
[31:19] again your salvation i thought salvation
[31:22] is free yes it's free
[31:25] when you hit the praise and alter it's
[31:27] free
[31:28] but when you begin to move forward
[31:30] you gotta work amen at the present altar
[31:33] you don't have to die for your sin you
[31:35] don't have to do anything everything you
[31:36] have to do accept jesus christ deal done
[31:40] but as you're progressing there's no
[31:42] lazy people in the kingdom of god
[31:44] anybody care you got to do some work you
[31:47] got to wake up you got to go to church
[31:49] got to do some work amen
[31:51] work out your own salvation not the
[31:54] salvation of somebody else your own
[31:56] salvation how with fear in other words
[32:00] with respect who are you respecting when
[32:02] you're working
[32:05] with fear and water
[32:07] trembling
[32:10] with fear when you're working when
[32:12] you're laboring you must have respect
[32:16] and
[32:17] trembling

[32:21] the gentile he said you do you need to
[32:23] be careful if the original branch
[32:26] uh israel
[32:28] was plugged out
[32:30] because of what they did you got to be

[35:32] you must have a new spirit
[35:34] amen
[35:36] and then the holy ghost will get there
[35:39] everybody care
[35:41] the new heart you understand that
[35:42] clearly the new spirit we already
[35:45] explained halfway
[35:46] about here
[35:48] and we need to know what's going on
[35:49] because the new heart
[35:51] is actually happening under
[35:53] justification
[35:55] everybody okay and the new spirit is
[35:58] happening under sanctification
[36:01] amen
[36:02] and the holy spirit here is when you are
[36:05] baptized or when you are converted or
[36:08] when you are born again
[36:11] all those things are speaking about the
[36:13] same thing it's just different
[36:15] terminology you need to understand the
[36:17] prophet differently amen
[36:19] brother brown i'm under legalistic he
[36:21] said roof under sanctification which is
[36:24] the second stage is laboring which we
[36:27] talked about it on sunday and roof
[36:29] laboring means roof legalist
[36:33] how can you labor and be a legalist
[36:36] everybody okay and brother bottom say
[36:38] roof resting waiting for boaz to return
[36:41] from the finish work we're not there yet
[36:43] amen
[36:44] we found under this serving here that
[36:47] roof now has been given full access into
[36:51] the field of boas
[36:53] she have been given some grace that the
[36:56] reapers have instruction every time
[36:58] she's laboring they need to add more
[37:01] food amen and at the end we found out
[37:04] that there is an expected end roof is
[37:07] going home with a nifa of food
[37:11] if you don't understand what a nifa of
[37:13] food is let me kind of help you up let's
[37:16] go to exodus chapter 16 so you
[37:19] understand what it means
[37:23] because this bible
[37:26] is hidden
[37:28] let's go to exodus chapter 16. so you
[37:30] understand when to say anifa of
[37:36] barley
[37:37] what else enifa means
[37:40] everybody okay
[37:41] exodus chapter 16
[37:44] verse
[37:46] 16.
[37:50] if you there you can say amen
[37:55] let me start from 14 so you get a
[37:57] background
[37:59] okay we good
[38:01] and when they do
[38:03] that lay
[38:04] was gone up in other words there was a
[38:07] dude that was coming up
[38:08] in the camp of israel
[38:11] and when they do left
[38:13] behold upon the face of the wilderness
[38:16] their
[38:17] a small round thing
[38:20] as small as the whole frost on the
[38:23] ground so when israel woke up they see a
[38:25] lot of things on the ground in other
[38:27] words the whole ground is covered with a
[38:30] lot of small grain
[38:31] verse 15 and when the children of israel
[38:34] saw it
[38:35] they say one to another it is water
[38:39] it is manna
[38:41] for they knew not
[38:43] what it was
[38:44] and moses said to them this is the water
[38:48] so mana is a bread you already
[38:51] understand this
[38:53] mana
[38:54] is a bread
[38:56] amen
[38:57] and we know that roof came back from
[39:00] moab because they heard that there was
[39:02] water
[39:03] bred in israel everybody okay so far
[39:06] okay
[39:08] stay tuned
[39:11] verse
[39:12] 15 and when the children of israel saw
[39:14] it they say one to another it is manna
[39:18] for they knew not what it was
[39:20] and moses said to them this is the bread
[39:23] which the lord has done water
[39:26] so it's a given bread
[39:29] amen from the lord to eat amen
[39:32] everybody here but even though the bread
[39:35] is given you must work
[39:37] remember the manner you got to pick it
[39:39] up and you got to work on it and cook it
[39:42] before you eat
[39:44] just like roof
[39:45] everybody okay
[39:46] verse 16
[39:48] this is the thing which the lord has
[39:50] commanded
[39:52] gather of it of the manner
[39:55] every man according to his eating
[39:58] and water
[40:00] so the measurement that was given for
[40:02] mana
[40:04] is called a number
[40:06] amen
[40:07] and a normal was a measurement that fit
[40:10] one person
[40:13] amen back here so when mana is falling
[40:16] on the ground if you pick up one armor
[40:19] don't worry you are covered for the
[40:20] whole day
[40:23] god knows how to measure amen
[40:26] gather of it every man according to his
[40:29] eating
[40:30] an armor for every man
[40:32] not two hormones just one
[40:34] one is sufficient for the whole day if
[40:37] you wake up you get one hour of mana you
[40:40] done for the day you can go the whole
[40:42] day without any more food amen
[40:46] the bible continue and say according to
[40:49] the number of your person
[40:51] take you every man for them which are in
[40:54] his tent so if you're a family of five
[40:57] we expected you to have five homers
[41:00] if you're a family of two you take two
[41:02] homers if you're a family of ten you
[41:04] take ten homer you don't take more than
[41:06] 10.
[41:07] god doesn't want wastage
[41:11] everybody okay
[41:13] if you need that's the reason why when
[41:14] he multiplied the bread and the bread
[41:16] was left he told the people gather up
[41:19] the bread because god does not want
[41:21] wasting
[41:23] amen you need the code you see me amen
[41:26] and
[41:27] in verse 17 and the children of israel
[41:30] did so and gather some
[41:33] more some
[41:35] according to the size of your family
[41:38] and when they did meet in other words
[41:40] when they measure
[41:42] when they did meet it when they measure
[41:44] it with phenomena he that gathereth much
[41:49] had nothing over
[41:51] and he the gathered leader has no luck
[41:54] they gather every man according to his
[41:57] water
[41:58] so if you have five armor it doesn't
[42:01] mean that you have more food than me
[42:05] it means you are five people in your
[42:07] house if i have two armor and then you
[42:10] have ten armors we have no difference
[42:12] because
[42:14] no matter how much how many armor you
[42:16] have in your house it will be only for
[42:18] one person so you cannot come out of
[42:21] your house and brag at me that i have
[42:23] more food than you
[42:26] nobody lacked anything nobody was
[42:29] starving everybody was in good health
[42:33] just with one measure
[42:35] i wish we can find that measure and give
[42:38] it to everybody so we don't have to
[42:40] worry about it
[42:41] anybody care so you don't have to worry
[42:43] about who's eating two hamburgers and
[42:45] one is eating one hamburger this is one
[42:48] measure for everybody
[42:50] anybody okay
[42:52] and then verse 19 and moses say
[42:55] let no man leave of feet until there
[42:58] so we found out that every person in
[43:01] israel
[43:02] fitted one measure and that measure was
[43:05] a number
[43:07] everybody okay so far
[43:09] job to verse
[43:10] uh 36
[43:16] you know what let's go by uh verse
[43:20] 32 if you dare you can say amen
[43:23] and moses say
[43:25] this is the thing which the lord
[43:27] commands god gave a new commandment
[43:30] fill a water
[43:32] anybody okay a number
[43:34] of it to be kept for your generations
[43:39] you understand now everybody one of them
[43:42] god said take a number of them in other
[43:45] in other words take the capacity of one
[43:48] man
[43:49] because the one who enter in the holiest
[43:52] is only one
[43:55] no two people only the high priest
[43:58] everybody okay and take only one measure
[44:02] and take it to the most holy place
[44:05] and put it over there and that manner
[44:08] never
[44:09] never never never can have any trouble
[44:13] amen so when the high priest entered
[44:16] there the high priest can eat and be
[44:18] surpassed
[44:20] without any problem
[44:21] and leave
[44:22] if the second person enter you're gonna
[44:24] find another ombre again
[44:27] amen and the way to the holiest was
[44:30] blocked
[44:32] only the high priest could enter but
[44:34] with the death of jesus christ the way
[44:36] open up so now we can go one by one and
[44:40] we can get everybody a number everybody
[44:43] will be filled with the holy spirit and
[44:46] nobody will like the holy ghost
[44:50] you say how does it happen do you
[44:52] remember jesus multiplying the bread he
[44:55] only had one in his hand when he cut the
[44:58] bread what happened to the other bread
[45:00] back again
[45:01] until everybody was filled because he's
[45:03] the fountain of living water
[45:06] amen you don't take water out any
[45:09] decrees the more you take the more he
[45:10] comes up anybody okay so far so he says
[45:14] phil and norma verse 32
[45:16] of it to be kept for your generation
[45:19] that they may see
[45:21] the bread wherewith i have fed you in
[45:24] the wilderness when i brought you forth
[45:27] from the land of egypt
[45:29] and moses said to aaron take a part and
[45:32] put a normal fool which is the capacity
[45:34] of one man full of mana darwin and laid
[45:37] it up before the lord and be kept for
[45:40] your generation anybody okay
[45:43] as the lord commanded moses so aaron
[45:45] laid it up before the testimony to be
[45:48] kept
[45:49] and the children of israel did eat mana
[45:52] 40 years until they came to the land
[45:54] inhabited they did eat mana until they
[45:57] came to the borders of the land of
[46:00] canaan again remember
[46:02] one armor is a measure for one person
[46:05] everybody okay
[46:07] watch now now verse 36 now and number
[46:12] is the water
[46:14] is the taff
[46:22] anybody okay
[46:23] a normal is the third part of water so
[46:28] for you to have one ifa
[46:31] you need ten armors
[46:34] ten armors equal one ifa
[46:38] anybody here
[46:39] an armor was a food for one day
[46:45] anybody here and roof work one day
[46:50] it's okay now
[46:51] and produce a neefer
[46:55] [Music]
[46:57] everybody here in other words one
[47:00] working day of roof
[47:02] made a food for ten days
[47:06] amen
[47:08] amen
[47:09] am i reading a different scripture
[47:11] a different bible everybody here and how
[47:14] many people were there at home

[47:24] everybody okay
[47:26] what does five means
[47:28] grace for naomi and greg for who
[47:31] any question so far
[47:35] everybody okay so when they say we never
[47:38] for your own salvation it is for your
[47:41] good.
[47:44] how can one person work one day and
[47:47] produce the food for 10 days
[47:51] because the portion of other food was
[47:54] coming from boast
[47:57] he was adding the surplus
[47:59] and but here he was multiplying the food
[48:05] [Music]
[48:06] everybody okay so far so when you are
[48:09] engaging the work of god you are
[48:11] automatically under the shower of god
[48:15] you must expect some increase
[48:18] that you cannot explain where it
[48:20] happened
[48:21] [Applause]
[48:23] [Music]
[48:25] everybody here you can check your bank

[51:09] going to miss it i'm not going to miss
[51:10] it praise the lord for giving me that
[51:13] deal
[51:13] [Applause]
[51:14] [Laughter]
[51:17] everybody here
[51:19] brother branham said because the bible
[51:21] say believe his prophet
[51:23] and you shall do whatever
[51:27] brother branham said you believe you are
[51:30] saved you need to do whatever.
[51:33] when you testify you are acting also
[51:38] everybody here i think like you are
[51:40] saved and what you do as well
[51:43] you associate
[51:46] with the people
[51:49] everybody here
[51:51] you associate with the people of like
[51:54] precious faith
[52:00] you don't need to be surrendered
[52:03] by pessimists
[52:10] did he help you
[52:11] never surrender yourself with negative
[52:15] people
[52:18] [Music]
[52:20] associate with people that believe big
[52:22] things
[52:26] they have big dreams
[52:29] everybody okay so far
[52:31] if you feel that somebody's trying to
[52:33] block you on the faith
[52:35] move him away
[52:37] if you can't help me don't try to block
[52:40] me move out of my way
[52:44] everybody here so you associate with the
[52:48] people that believe like you because
[52:50] they will encourage you and they will
[52:52] tell you about their experience and
[52:55] their testimony and what god did for
[52:58] them
[52:59] [Applause]
[53:02] that is the law that happened and
[53:04] brother branham said when you do that it
[53:07] will work out for salvation
[53:09] the same thing will take place for
[53:11] divine healing you believe you are
[53:13] healed you act like you are healed
[53:17] you say you are here

[53:42] you can confess
[53:44] god is able to do it
[53:46] anything that you confess he has water
[53:53] not everything that god will do
[53:57] [Music]

[54:21] if you receive something do you pray for
[54:23] it
[54:27] make sense now so when you receive it by
[54:30] faith
[54:31] brother branham said it is as much real
[54:34] as the thing itself
[54:36] so you are praising god because he's
[54:38] already finished it
[54:41] and when you do that
[54:43] god will step on the scene
[54:46] because you're now working and god will
[54:49] work also and when he work then you're
[54:52] going to get result

[54:57] believe you are safe
[54:59] setting on your seat
[55:01] wherever you are you accept it and begin
[55:05] to confess and tell the people you were
[55:10] well
[55:11] you kept on saying i am water
[55:14] even though you don't look like you
[55:16] saved
[55:19] the people say there ain't no difference
[55:22] in you
[55:23] but you believe there was is that right
[55:25] and you keep and you kept with your
[55:28] confession and after a while
[55:31] it will work out whatever
[55:33] all your neighbor and everybody knows
[55:36] you are
[55:37] because you believe it you confess it
[55:40] why

[59:20] a commandment was given to go to the law
[59:25] it's two ways
[59:26] either you do it or you don't do it
[59:29] anybody care
[59:30] watch it
[59:31] and it came to pass
[59:34] that
[59:35] as they arrive at the priest
[59:42] everybody okay
[59:44] is that what the bible says
[59:46] as the water
[59:48] so because they obey the commandment
[59:54] everybody okay and they believe the
[59:57] commandment
[59:58] and they begin to act upon the
[1:00:01] commandment
[1:00:02] before they even reach their priest
[1:00:07] amen
[1:00:08] amen god takes over
[1:00:12] everybody here and remove all the
[1:00:14] leprosy
[1:00:16] until when you meet them you cannot have
[1:00:19] any trace that they were lepers before
[1:00:22] in other words when you see them you
[1:00:24] would never believe this man was a
[1:00:26] gangster
[1:00:28] amen you will never believe this man was
[1:00:30] a smoker
[1:00:31] he doesn't even look like one
[1:00:34] anybody okay and as they were as they
[1:00:37] kept as he came to pass that as they
[1:00:40] went they were water
[1:00:42] they were cleaned they were cleansed not
[1:00:44] when they arrived but because they were
[1:00:47] obedience to the commandment to go unto
[1:00:51] the priests as they begin to act upon it
[1:00:54] automatically the second law kick in and
[1:00:58] take over anybody care
[1:01:01] amen
[1:01:02] by the bottom say what happened what
[1:01:04] changed you he's the high priest of your
[1:01:07] confession
[1:01:09] setting at the right hand of the father
[1:01:11] making good what you are confessing what
[1:01:14] are you confessing
[1:01:16] that is the same thing it is by healing
[1:01:19] you accept him as your healer
[1:01:22] you renounce your water
[1:01:24] your symptom it is not by feeling it is
[1:01:27] by water
[1:01:29] faith you are healed say you are here
[1:01:32] believe you are here

[1:02:16] second one and the third one and the
[1:02:17] fourth one

[1:03:12] so how does this law here
[1:03:15] applied to the legalistic level
[1:03:18] of ruth how because there is a key to

[1:03:27] according to the full knowledge of god
[1:03:29] the father he started from your origin
[1:03:32] through the sanctification of the spirit
[1:03:35] how does the sanctification of the
[1:03:37] spirit happen come on the sanctification
[1:03:41] of the spirit
[1:03:42] how does it happen unto obedience
[1:03:46] you obeying the commandment of jesus

[1:04:51] saying
[1:04:52] in heaven now is come salvation and
[1:04:56] strength and the kingdom of our god and

[1:06:34] everybody here that's all everybody here
[1:06:37] they overcome him by the word of the
[1:06:40] testimony and they love not their water
[1:06:48] what is the greatest commandment
[1:06:52] you shall love the lord
[1:06:54] above
[1:06:56] with all your
[1:06:58] all your
[1:06:59] in other words the love
[1:07:02] your love toward him
[1:07:04] is greater than yourself
[1:07:08] in other words when they say they're
[1:07:09] gonna kill you because of this message

[1:07:16] anybody here you are esteeming your life
[1:07:19] above i mean your your his life above

[1:07:30] the first place in your life
[1:07:33] apply the blood of the lamb in your life
[1:07:36] and give the word of the testimony there
[1:07:39] is no devil that's going to stand on
[1:07:42] your way
[1:07:43] is he complicated
[1:07:44] [Applause]
[1:07:48] is he complicated
[1:07:50] is he complicated
[1:07:52] roof brother branham say the next thing
[1:07:54] she had to do she had to do autumn
[1:07:58] she had to work
[1:07:59] she had to label and when she work she
[1:08:02] becomes a
[1:08:04] legalist
[1:08:05] how can you work and become a legalist
[1:08:08] amen
[1:08:09] she had to work out her own salvation
[1:08:13] with fear and trembling like you did
[1:08:17] she went out into the field that isn't
[1:08:19] working and put her clothes upon her and
[1:08:23] went out into the field and cleaned
[1:08:25] behind the maiden in order to get
[1:08:28] sustaining food for the day
[1:08:32] and one day produced 10 days one day 10
[1:08:34] days she can even open a store is that
[1:08:38] right
[1:08:39] what was she doing she was trying to
[1:08:42] find favor
[1:08:45] with boas
[1:08:46] so she worked
[1:08:48] her way through the stage of
[1:08:50] legalism
[1:08:52] what does it mean the stage of
[1:08:55] legalistic
[1:08:56] anybody care
[1:08:58] this stage
[1:09:00] anybody care
[1:09:01] remember the law was good
[1:09:05] but the problem with israel the law was
[1:09:08] not combined by faith
[1:09:12] that's why they missed god because their
[1:09:14] law was intended to bring you to christ
[1:09:19] remember because jesus said if you would
[1:09:22] have believed moses the lord you would
[1:09:25] believe me
[1:09:26] but the reason why you don't believe me
[1:09:29] is because you never even have faith in
[1:09:32] the lord
[1:09:35] everybody okay so far
[1:09:36] so
[1:09:37] this stage of legalistic
[1:09:41] when it is not combined by faith
[1:09:45] or
[1:09:46] revelation
[1:09:48] everybody here it is usually
[1:09:52] a burden for a believer
[1:09:57] everybody okay
[1:09:58] this stage
[1:10:00] is a stage if you don't have a
[1:10:03] revelation of what god is doing in your
[1:10:06] life you will think that god is removing
[1:10:10] every fun out of your life
[1:10:14] [Music]
[1:10:16] everybody here
[1:10:18] because when they pick up the glass it's
[1:10:21] dirty there's no problem
[1:10:23] but when you come to the sanctification
[1:10:26] they gotta put you in the boiling water
[1:10:29] they got to put some clorox they got to
[1:10:31] put some soap when they're doing that
[1:10:33] you think god is turning you upside down
[1:10:37] until you don't want to come to church
[1:10:39] anymore
[1:10:40] until you feel like you want to run away
[1:10:44] ever here because it looks like god is
[1:10:48] blocking you everywhere
[1:10:50] because roof was free
[1:10:53] she entered the field of boys as soon as
[1:10:56] she met boys boaz put a restriction to
[1:10:59] her
[1:11:00] you cannot go to any other field
[1:11:03] no matter how good that field look
[1:11:07] no matter how appealing that field look
[1:11:10] you have to stay on a certain field
[1:11:13] because of a purpose
[1:11:17] here so your liberty is no more like you
[1:11:21] used to be
[1:11:24] in the other court
[1:11:27] anybody here
[1:11:29] in the other court you can go anywhere
[1:11:32] here
[1:11:33] and you're playing around
[1:11:35] anybody here but once you enter here you
[1:11:38] become restricted with the space
[1:11:41] you can only move much
[1:11:46] ever here and if you don't understand
[1:11:49] what god is doing
[1:11:51] everything you will see it's like they
[1:11:54] put you into a prison
[1:11:57] that's why you heard people saying we
[1:11:59] were in the prison in the message
[1:12:01] you were not in the prison in the
[1:12:03] message you were entering a different
[1:12:06] stage of christianity
[1:12:08] [Applause]
[1:12:10] ever here so far
[1:12:12] this stage
[1:12:14] is an opportunity for you
[1:12:20] are we okay
[1:12:22] to show god
[1:12:24] an appreciation
[1:12:28] for what god did for you in the other
[1:12:32] country
[1:12:34] [Music]
[1:12:38] everybody here
[1:12:40] you are doing that in order to please
[1:12:44] god
[1:12:46] because he has been good to you
[1:12:49] if somebody like i gave you an example
[1:12:51] before has been good to you when you see
[1:12:54] that person come around what do you want
[1:12:55] to do

[1:13:01] that hey
[1:13:02] i'm good towards you because you have
[1:13:05] been good to me everybody okay so this
[1:13:08] stage here is a stage of work but that
[1:13:12] work is an appreciation
[1:13:15] to show to god that i'm thanking you for
[1:13:19] what you did for me on calvary
[1:13:25] are we okay so far
[1:13:27] blessed be the name of the lord this
[1:13:29] stage
[1:13:31] is a stage where god tests your
[1:13:34] obedience
[1:13:42] it's a test of your
[1:13:44] obedience everybody here
[1:13:47] and they pissed off your response back
[1:13:50] to god
[1:13:54] in
[1:13:57] love amen
[1:14:00] what am i trying to say there
[1:14:02] amen
[1:14:04] god

[1:14:23] and if if it's meal time go eat for free
[1:14:26] we don't have to pay anything matter of
[1:14:28] fact you reapers when she's doing
[1:14:30] something jumping
[1:14:31] and ruth is going and at the beginning
[1:14:34] she was going and no reaper look at her
[1:14:37] but at this time when she's working she
[1:14:39] see constantly one ripper
[1:14:43] another one
[1:14:44] now she doesn't he says
[1:14:46] why are you giving me all of this
[1:14:48] it is not the reaper
[1:14:50] but here
[1:14:51] it is boaz
[1:14:53] expressing something towards you
[1:14:56] but here you are now in the second stage
[1:14:59] here you are approaching him closely
[1:15:02] but here he is expressing something
[1:15:04] towards you and in the in response to
[1:15:08] his love in other words he's projecting
[1:15:11] love
[1:15:12] and he's seen he's watching your
[1:15:15] reaction
[1:15:18] if you really love him too
[1:15:20] in other words boys is saying i love you
[1:15:27] and he's wanting to see if you're gonna
[1:15:29] say i love you too
[1:15:33] but the way you say i love you too
[1:15:37] is by keeping his commandment
[1:15:40] [Applause]
[1:15:41] [Music]
[1:15:44] everybody okay if you love me do what
[1:15:47] keep my commandment
[1:15:49] so when you begin to obey his
[1:15:51] commandment he is interpreting that

[1:15:56] she loves me
[1:15:59] [Music]
[1:16:02] i wish the whole church was here
[1:16:05] everybody okay

[1:16:13] that's why naomi said
[1:16:15] make sure you don't move
[1:16:18] to another place
[1:16:20] in other words when you move to another
[1:16:22] place you're giving him a different
[1:16:24] response
[1:16:25] like
[1:16:26] she's still probably
[1:16:28] flirting after
[1:16:30] other young men
[1:16:31] do you want me to show you that
[1:16:33] let's go to the book of roof

[1:17:23] i saw your kindness at the beginning
[1:17:25] we are still in the other court let me
[1:17:27] pull a little bit forward and put
[1:17:29] restriction
[1:17:31] everybody here it's like a young man you
[1:17:33] start coding and before you know it
[1:17:36] who's that boy

[1:17:40] usually talk to him we play do you know
[1:17:42] what he's going to tell you
[1:17:43] i don't like it
[1:17:47] right
[1:17:48] i don't want you to talk to that boy
[1:17:49] anymore i understand you in the church
[1:17:51] you grew up together but i'm not
[1:17:54] pleased with the way you talk to him
[1:17:56] it's too way to do if you love him
[1:18:00] what do you do
[1:18:04] is he complicated
[1:18:07] anybody okay
[1:18:09] verse 10 so you have showed more can
[1:18:12] kindness in the latter end than at the
[1:18:14] beginning
[1:18:15] in as much as you follow
[1:18:19] not what
[1:18:21] where the water
[1:18:23] or what
[1:18:24] do you see what boaz was watching roof
[1:18:27] do you see
[1:18:28] i want to see where your heart is if you
[1:18:31] after money
[1:18:32] or you after what let me see
[1:18:35] stay here and i'm gonna see so it's a
[1:18:37] stage that god tests your obedience
[1:18:42] in response to the love he sent towards
[1:18:45] you
[1:18:46] amen and the way you respond back to him
[1:18:49] that you love him is by keeping his
[1:18:51] commandment
[1:18:52] if you keep his commandment so you love
[1:18:54] me me and my father will come and we
[1:18:57] will manifest ourself to you and we will
[1:19:01] abide to you i cannot abide in you if
[1:19:04] you still loving somebody

[1:19:11] i have a lot i cannot invest my stuff in
[1:19:14] a woman who doesn't love me
[1:19:16] i want to see your test
[1:19:18] why is boaz doing this number one it's a
[1:19:22] state that
[1:19:24] is the law
[1:19:25] must be mixed by revelation so you
[1:19:28] understand what god is doing for you
[1:19:30] number two it's an opportunity for you
[1:19:33] to show appreciation for everything he
[1:19:36] has done for you
[1:19:38] come and eat at the table come and drink
[1:19:40] give her food whatever she wants don't
[1:19:42] go anywhere there's so much he has done
[1:19:44] for you
[1:19:46] what do you do in return to him it's a
[1:19:48] test of obedience when i gave the
[1:19:50] commandment is she obeying yes or no
[1:19:53] if she obeys she loves me anybody okay
[1:19:57] this
[1:19:58] stage here is a stage all of this boaz
[1:20:02] is doing this in order to
[1:20:07] open
[1:20:09] anybody okay
[1:20:11] the door of your heart
[1:20:16] anybody clear
[1:20:18] that door is called self-will
[1:20:26] lord help me
[1:20:28] what are you saying brother
[1:20:31] amen the bible says love not the world
[1:20:38] neither the faiths that are in the water
[1:20:42] if any man love the world
[1:20:44] the love of the father is not what
[1:20:48] roof if you begin to go outside
[1:20:51] you don't love me
[1:20:52] no matter how much you can say you love
[1:20:54] me
[1:20:55] by your action
[1:20:57] i can tell whether you love me or not if

[1:52:00] mordecai her uncle was raising her and
[1:52:02] she had to go to qualify
[1:52:05] justification and what so and
[1:52:08] and so what did what they did they had
[1:52:11] to take these girls in for water
[1:52:15] for so many months
[1:52:17] they had to perfume them and do all kind
[1:52:19] of adorning and fix them all up so they
[1:52:22] could go before there
[1:52:24] you understand this now
[1:52:26] but
[1:52:27] go ahead esther
[1:52:29] was to become a brother so she didn't
[1:52:32] want none of the adorning of the
[1:52:36] if you love the world
[1:52:38] and the things of the world the love of
[1:52:40] god is not even in water

[2:07:00] looks he said hey go remove it
[2:07:03] because when he put you on the head
[2:07:06] he is protecting you
[2:07:08] heger usually are unique
[2:07:11] they cannot do anything to women that's
[2:07:13] why when groove entered
[2:07:15] boaz went and blocked the reapers
[2:07:18] because the esther must be protected and
[2:07:21] the men that are there but cannot touch
[2:07:24] them reapers that are there but cannot
[2:07:26] touch roof
[2:07:27] stay with the maiden follow the maiden

[2:07:37] to the left associate with the people
[2:07:40] that believe like you

[2:07:44] laws yet but i have my maiden that
[2:07:47] already know my law associate with them

[2:07:57] them that already knew what to do you

[2:08:04] open up your door into boaz let's stand
[2:08:07] there
[2:08:10] [Applause]
[2:08:18] if i rob you the wrong way praise
[2:08:20] god but at least
[2:08:23] whoever didn't follow this need to
[2:08:25] follow her
[2:08:27] i won't have your blood in my hand
[2:08:30] this message is not a legalistic
[2:08:32] according to what you heard legalistic
[2:08:34] like prison it is not like that
[2:08:37] it is only a channel
[2:08:39] a time of purification
[2:08:42] everybody here
[2:08:43] a time of purification that god wants to
[2:08:46] take the world out of you so that you
[2:08:49] can meet him because you cannot enter
[2:08:52] into the imagine the holy place is
[2:08:54] called already holy place
[2:08:57] that where god is is called the holiest
[2:09:00] now in the holy place you're not clean
[2:09:02] how are you going to enter the holiest
[2:09:05] where the the the because over there you
[2:09:08] have the caribbean and the caribbean
[2:09:10] cannot even look at god
[2:09:13] and they never seen in their life they
[2:09:15] have to cover their face cover their
[2:09:17] feet cover everything
[2:09:19] just to see the holiness of god how
[2:09:22] about you coming up with all kinds of
[2:09:24] dirty stuff and trying to get into the
[2:09:27] holiest you're going to get killed
[2:09:30] that's why the high priest himself when
[2:09:32] he was entering he was trembling
[2:09:34] because if he play game and something is
[2:09:37] not covered the high priest is dead and
[2:09:39] nobody even entered to take him off you
[2:09:42] got to pull him from there outside and
[2:09:44] get him off
[2:09:47] how are you going to enter there but the
[2:09:49] blood of jesus christ
[2:09:51] already ripped the veil and made the way
[2:09:54] for you to enter all that he said he's
[2:09:57] telling you to do the sanctification of
[2:09:59] the spirit by obedience into the
[2:10:02] sprinkling of the water man take your
[2:10:05] bracelet off we already preached to you
[2:10:07] after that

[2:10:12] clean up your life
[2:10:15] you want to get the holy ghost clean up
[2:10:17] your life because sanctification means
[2:10:19] to clean and set aside for the feeling
[2:10:22] to be used in service
[2:10:24] i want the holy ghost i want the holy
[2:10:26] ghost but you don't want to let go you
[2:10:27] want the holy ghost and continue the way

[2:10:34] friends you got to give away your
[2:10:36] association you got to give away all
[2:10:38] your facebook sometimes you got to close

[2:11:37] children
[2:11:38] especially the young
[2:11:41] understand
[2:11:43] and get the revelation on what you are
[2:11:45] trying to tell them
[2:11:48] father this world
[2:11:50] is gone insane
[2:11:52] [Music]
[2:11:53] until
[2:11:54] parent
[2:11:55] would leave their children to go to
[2:11:57] school
[2:11:59] and the next phone calls
[2:12:01] they're calling them to come and pick up
[2:12:03] dead bodies
[2:12:05] nonsense that was shoot
[2:12:09] they were shot
[2:12:10] they didn't even know what they did
[2:12:13] and father sometimes you speaking to
[2:12:16] your children
[2:12:17] and we walk out like we're gonna stay
[2:12:19] here
[2:12:20] for a thousand years again
[2:12:22] not even knowing
[2:12:24] when is the next time you're gonna call
[2:12:26] us
[2:12:27] you keep knocking at the door
[2:12:30] and we're coming out of the church and
[2:12:32] continue to behave continue smoking
[2:12:36] continue drinking
[2:12:38] continue tempering with that girlfriend
[2:12:40] of the world
[2:12:42] continue in that stubbornness way do not
[2:12:44] want to listen
[2:12:46] continue with that reasoning i don't see
[2:12:48] anything wrong with this
[2:12:50] continue with this thing that is that
[2:12:53] are keeping you away from the church
[2:12:56] and before you know it people are
[2:12:57] cooling off
[2:13:00] they miss one service they miss two
[2:13:02] services they miss three services before
[2:13:04] you know it it's month before you know
[2:13:06] it it's a year
[2:13:09] accumulating all the things of this
[2:13:11] world and neglecting their soul
[2:13:14] while all the symptoms the war of russia
[2:13:17] that we thought in three days or four
[2:13:19] days could be finished now the war is
[2:13:22] driving
[2:13:23] until united states is suffering to even
[2:13:26] have baby formula milk
[2:13:28] who would have thought
[2:13:30] we will come in a time that inflation
[2:13:33] will rise up in this nation like this
[2:13:35] who would have thought we will reach a
[2:13:38] place where we have to pay
[2:13:40] the gas for our car in the pricing that
[2:13:43] we paint
[2:13:44] and despite all this sign
[2:13:47] some are still stubborn
[2:13:50] until you spoke you say stubbornness is
[2:13:53] like idolatry
[2:13:55] stubbornness
[2:13:56] [Music]
[2:13:58] it's like iniquity
[2:14:00] iniquity because somebody is still
[2:14:02] esteeming something higher
[2:14:06] than you
[2:14:07] somebody's still giving preeminence
[2:14:10] to whatever they want to cling to above
[2:14:13] what your word is saying
[2:14:16] they want to gain the material of this
[2:14:19] world
[2:14:20] they want to fulfill their dream first
[2:14:22] before they start coming to church and
[2:14:25] they don't know what tomorrow will be
[2:14:27] those children that were shot
[2:14:29] those two men that were shot did not
[2:14:31] know that was their last day to attend
[2:14:33] school
[2:14:34] father
[2:14:36] may your children wake up make those
[2:14:38] that are streaming online wake up make
[2:14:41] those that one listen to this sermon
[2:14:43] wake up
[2:14:44] and remember that the calling of the
[2:14:46] master is calling for the last call so
[2:14:49] that we can enter in
[2:14:51] and surrender and obey and be filled
[2:14:55] with the holy spirit and be ready to go
[2:14:57] into the rapture
[2:14:58] lord may you be merciful to us may you
[2:15:01] give enough grace so that the revelation
[2:15:04] will be unfolded that they can catch
[2:15:06] their vision and realize this is not a
[2:15:08] man talking
[2:15:10] this is the very mercies of god calling
[2:15:14] and asking to surrender
[2:15:16] not for prison
[2:15:18] but you just want to see an obedience
[2:15:21] because the purpose that you have is to
[2:15:23] bless them
[2:15:24] is to see them and to give them an
[2:15:27] expected end because the thoughts you
[2:15:29] have for them are not talks of evil but
[2:15:32] it's taught to kill to do them good
[2:15:34] to bless them to deliver them to give
[2:15:37] them a wonderful marriage to give them a
[2:15:39] wonderful job to bless them but how can
[2:15:42] you do that when they don't give you
[2:15:43] preeminence may they surrender that
[2:15:46] stubborn self-will
[2:15:48] that is always on the way don't want to
[2:15:50] go to church don't want to go to prayer
[2:15:52] service don't want to go to the things
[2:15:54] that belong to kingdom don't want to go
[2:15:56] to the question and answer oh they want
[2:15:58] to go is in different places
[2:16:00] father
[2:16:06] i'm pleading as a shepherd
[2:16:09] that father you'll be merciful and may
[2:16:12] you help your children
[2:16:13] there is enough an abundance of holy
[2:16:16] ghost that you want to fill them
[2:16:18] father the door has been already open
[2:16:21] and it's a simple instruction
[2:16:23] just obey
[2:16:26] and the holy spirit will come
[2:16:28] lord we commit them unto the hand
[2:16:30] may you continue to reveal your word
[2:16:32] unto them
[2:16:34] and may you continue to work and and
[2:16:36] further strengthen them
[2:16:38] and may you take the remaining of the
[2:16:40] weak unto the hand
[2:16:41] and father this oncoming service that is
[2:16:43] coming up on the weekend with brother
[2:16:45] abraham that he might be surrendering
[2:16:47] himself and moving out of the way and
[2:16:50] may you speak again and bless your
[2:16:51] children
[2:16:52] we commit them unto the hand and we
[2:16:54] thank you in the name of jesus christ
[2:16:58] amen
[2:16:59] god bless you church we love you but
[2:17:03] [Music]
[2:17:25] thou be
[2:17:27] [Music]
[2:17:27] [Applause]
