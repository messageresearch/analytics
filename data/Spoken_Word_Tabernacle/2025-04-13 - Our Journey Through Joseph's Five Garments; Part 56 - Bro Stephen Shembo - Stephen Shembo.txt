We greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, both visible and invisible audience. Amen. Any family members here? God richly bless you. Brother Samma, God bless you. And sister Teresa, oh my God bless you. Welcome. Welcome again. And good to see you this morning. Let's give the Lord a big What a what a surprise. He made it without telling me. So it's a way to dodge preaching. Because if I knew before, I would just sit there and enjoy and I say, "You know what? You go ahead and take the ball because I believe in passing the ball and I have the quote for it." So, I will pass the ball and I sit there like we did last Sunday and then me also enjoying the sermon and it's so good on Sunday. Nobody told me about that. So wonderful. When I was sitting there, I say, "My God, wonderful." So here he come and he's sleep in. So I didn't even see you. God bless you. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Amen. Maybe at the end of the service, brother set, you can just remind me. He can come up and then dismiss the audience. Amen. We just want to appreciate and honor the gift of God. He is he's a minister still working for the kingdom of God. So we want to honor the gift of God. Amen. I believe we are up to date with the sermon and I believe we're reading our Bible twice a day. our cood our church ages 70 weeks of Daniel the seals adoption or somebody is listening or reading the message of the hour. Amen. So you have no excuse when you get in heaven somehow somebody is listening to the message of the hour. Amen. We appreciate everyone that was there in our appreciation dinner. Again, God bless you for your labor and for everything you're doing for the church. I extended my gratitude yesterday and I'm doing that again in front of all the church and our invisible audience on YouTube all over the world. We appreciate whatever you're doing for the kingdom. If everything is working, the sound is good, the atmosphere is prepared, all of that takes the congregation, the musician, the deacon, the trustees, the treasurer, everybody put together. So spoken word, congratulation. God bless you. Amen. Lord's willing, on April the 26, that will be our second quarterly question and answer. And then on May 10th, this is married couple meeting part six. The young man, I'm not sure. I send a message. I'm waiting to hear from the deacon to have a uh a clear date on it. The young sister was still waiting. Brother John Porter sent me a message. Everything went well with Sister Lily. All is well by God's grace. Amen. We thank God for everything. Amen. For those who need to catch up on the meeting, so please just be patient. We already got all the computer 24 in. They are loading up everything. So what I ask the technician is to make sure all the question and answer all the youngs men the young sisters meeting they can load them to every single computer and hand them up to the deacon. So if you miss something, you pick whichever deacon you want to go through or for some time if I have time then you can pick the pastor or you will spend time with sister Sharon going over stuff there because sister Sharon will be always available especially young sisters love that part over there. So sister Sharon also will be available. You can handle that when I will be upstairs doing my own thing or listening to brother brand or minding my own business. Are we together? Amen. So, just be patient. They're loading up everything so we make sure it's there. Unfortunately, a technical issue happened with part one of the married couple meeting and that one got in trouble. Everything else is there. That's why it's very important to be there because now whoever misses it, you miss part one. So, it's there. I mean something happened when they were transferring the data but it's there. So I know what it means. You got all the material whoever is coming up with married couple. If you all get married here and you stay here then I have to maybe make up on part one for you. Oh my god. But if you're traveling then it's a different issue. But if you're staying here and all of you are still here then I'll say you know what let's catch up on that part one and then try to load you. But I always try to recap a little bit and pick up somewhere. But the main thing I was looking for is the quotes that were given there. It's more the word, the quote and the scripture that brother Brandham gave. So you have them and then we move on. Amen. I believe brother Glenn and brother Kelly, brother Tony, everything is clear. I don't think I've forgotten something. Amen. So praise God. So let's go to our scripture this morning. and flight attendant, you prepare for takeoff. Amen. Praise God. You will need your Bible today. We need to go from verse to verse to verse verse. Amen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is a different route and it's a route that the devil trouble God's children a lot. We'll try to dig into it slowly. I will try to go 35 miles an hour. Which one is school zone? 35. Yeah, 35. I will try to go 35 miles an hour. So, this soaking pretty good. Amen. We still with the blood upon the horn of the altar. You see how deep we are? You already forgot about that. We are We are way We are way way way deep. So once we finish with the blood upon the horn of the altar, then we come back up again and we pick up on the blood under the brazen altar. Then we move from that blood and try to come up from P4 house all the way and keep climbing up to the surface and move to the second garment. Brother Sam told me it will be interesting how you going to come out from there. Amen. So we try by the grace of God. So we still dealing with the same thing in prayer. Amen. We already explained three element here that we're dealing with. We're dealing with uh we already dealt with time. It's three element. One of them is time. You know that right? One of them is season. You know that what these two we already touched. The problem is on the purpose. This is where we have not touched it yet. Amen. So my subject this morning, amen, is our life journey through Joseph's five garment part 56. And my theme is purpose. I was trying to knock all three of them. The Holy Spirit would not let me in. So I have to go slowly, one by one. Amen. So stay tight. I'm going to go school zone because this is very important. Without understanding these three element, you will be jumping up like a Pentecostal or a Baptist. We got a lot of them in the message where we we don't know what we're doing. We are just moving by faith. And what we call faith is imaginary stuff. It's like we playing lottery with God. Amen. We're playing numbers. No hoping that one of this day one number will work then when we work but we don't know why it work and why did the other one didn't work that's the problem so let's pray heavenly father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning father we thank you for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything you're doing for this church and the bride all over the world Lord Father in ourself we are insufficient and we are very limited And your prophet told us to master the human element, Lord. Father, may you come down again, Lord. Father, in the power of resurrection, may you speak to our soul and move me completely out of the way. May you be the one speaking, the one teaching, the one interpreting, and the one doing everything so that at the end of the day, may all the glory be returned back unto the Lord. Father, be the Alpha and the Omega. speak to our soul, both those that are visible and invisible, and those that will catch up later. Lord, we commit it all and seal the devil completely out of this place and every demon spirit in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Let's go to Psalm 82. I'm going to read couple verses there. Glory to God. I hope that you slept well because you always have a chance to sleep more than me. Amen. Psalm 82. If you dare, you can say amen. The Bible say, I have said, this is God talking that ye are God's. God didn't wait for the Holy Ghost to come in human being to call them God. Amen. I hope we are together because when Jesus came Jesus say I and my father we are one and the Jews pick up the stone. Amen. And they want to stone him. And Jesus say, "Wait a minute. You might be sitted." Jesus say, "Wait a minute. Why do you want to stone me?" They say, "Uh-uh. For good work. We stone you not." In other words, we love the miracle. We love the healing. We love all this good stuff. But we got one problem with you. The problem is you. Amen. Amen. The one we saw being birthed at Carolina Medical Center. In atrium over there in Noven. We were there. When your mother was pushing, we were there. You not even born in a hospital [Music] in a stable. Even animal were witness. Amen. Amen. Now you calling yourself God. [Laughter] Hallelujah. Amen. Jesus say well well. So why does your law call those to whom the word of God came? God called them gods. So if the word of God is coming to you, sir, is my Bible different than your Bible? If the word of God comes to you, You are who? God. Do you believe it? Amen. Because God doesn't send his word for nothing. No sir. When God sent his word, there is somebody there to receive the word. Amen. And only God receive the word. Amen. [Music] Are we together? Are we together? Are we together? Amen. So God when Jesus pointed to them, Jesus pointed to them back to the Old Testament when the Holy Spirit was not yet inside human being. Amen. Take your time. God called them gods without the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. I thought Peter walk on the water without the Holy Ghost. [Music] He did what Jesus did. Jesus was God. And Peter also went and walked on the water. He did exactly what God did. Amen. But you have a problem believing Peter. Your problem is only Jesus Christ. Don't worry my friend. Let's continue. I have said you are who? Gods. And all of you are who? Children of the most high. It's clear a child of God is what? God. Is that a problem? No, sir. You're calling me I'm a child of God. Then when I tell you I'm God, you have a problem with me. So you don't even believe I'm a child of God. So why do you call me a child of God? A child of God is God. Wow. Amen. When you come out from something, you pick up the genetic material. Perfect. Amen. And we have the genetic material of God. It is called the predestinated seed. Are we together? Amen. Are we together? Amen. Verse seven. But ye shall die like who? Men. And fall like what? One of the princes. So it's our dual part. We are gods. I put this in little G. So he will help you up. Amen. And I'm going to put the other one man in a capital N. Because that one you can touch it. You can feel it. You can see it. Then you believe it. That's a problem right there. Amen. We clear on that one. Everybody clear? Amen. Let's go to Jeremiah 29. Amen. Amen. I'm going school zone because if I rush with this, you miss it and the devil will continue to trouble you. Our prayer got problem with time. Amen. It got problem with season. Now it got problem with purpose. If you don't understand these three thing, you will be frustrated all your Christian life like we always has been. Amen. Because when our faith goes sometime up, we say it's going to happen. It's going to happen. Then it doesn't happen. Then we lose faith because we didn't check the time element. Amen. Amen. We lose faith because we didn't check the season element. The season doesn't even depend on you. Amen. How many pray for flower to b in the spring? How many pray for that? Does the does nature follow you? So nature is following somebody. They don't care about you. Whenever it spring in the internal clock, nature begin to change your Bermuda grass. I mean grass that used to be funny, it begin to change again and become green. You didn't do anything. But when it's on the floor, you can put as much water as you want. Correct. It's not working. Amen. The problem is the season. When the season come, whether you spray water or not, everything life is coming back up. Everything is changing and turning green again. Praise God. In other words, when a season happen, it's painless. It is a faultless. What you were working too much on the fall in spring, you don't do anything. In the fall, you were watering, watering, watering. In the spring, you don't water. It still come up. [Music] Are we together? Are we together? We in the fog. Lord, Lord, I want this grass to turn green. Lord, Lord, I want this grass to turn green. You go outside. Oh, I feel the presence of the Lord. You go outside, the grass is still looking at you. I don't think God answer my prayer. I need to go to minister so and so they can lay me hand. Maybe I don't have the Holy Ghost. Wow. Wow. Then when you begin to forget about it and you don't even pay attention to it [Music] and suddenly it's here. It's allergy. Ah the season has come. That's it. Now go pray for the grass to be green. Amen. You don't have faith anymore. Wow. Beautiful. Let's go pray now for the grass to be green. Oh God, I pray for the grass to be green. Of course, it's going to be green. You think it's your prayer? No, sir. It is the [Applause] season. Are we together? Jeremiah 29. If you start like this, I'm not going to move. So don't hold me like you did, brother Chicozi. He touched a different line. So I'm your pastor. We know one another. Okay, let's move on. Normal. Okay. Jeremiah 29. I told him I say I knew they going to wear you down. When I tell you it feel good here. Some of you don't understand. And now you heard it from somebody else. Jeremiah 29 verse 11. If you dare, you can say amen. Amen. Amen. You there? Amen. Very familiar. We all love this. Put your seat belt, my friend. Amen. For I know who knows. I know God. Who knows? God. For I know. Amen. Are we together? Amen. The thoughts [Music] that I think toward you. In other words, there is somebody that knows. And there is somebody that is ignorant. Glory to God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Take your time or Uh-huh. That's it. That's it. Amen. Yes, sir. Somebody knows. Yes. Somebody's ignorant. Yes. And because of the ignorance, there is a problem between the two individual. Glory, glory, glory, glory. Are we together? And the one who knows, tell the one who ignorant that I know. Yes. In other way, just do what I tell you to do. I know. That's it. That's it. Amen. Just trust me. I know. Amen. Glory. Glory. Glory. What I'm thinking toward you. Amen. Amen. I know the thoughts that I think toward you. Says who? The Lord. If we say touch thoughts, it's vague. Amen. Amen. Amen. It's vague. Vague. What kind of thought? Because thoughts can be good thoughts or bad thoughts. So God didn't want to leave you wondering on the limbo trying to figure out okay uh you have a thought for me. So which thought do you have for me? And because some people go to hell, some go to heaven. And you told me you are thinking about me. Oh, I need to know what you're thinking about me because whatever you think will happen. Amen. What kind of thoughts do you have? So God is now narrowing everything down to remove any shadow of doubt. Amen. Amen. Or confusion from our mind. Which thought does God say? The Bible say verse uh uh 11 says the Lord thoughts of what?

And the Bible is saying here eyes has not seen your eyes has not seen it. Your eyes did not see this church. Yes sir. Hallelujah. Six years ago, your eye did not see this church. But this church was already here. Now your eyes are seeing this church. Are we together? Amen. Eyes has not what seen. No what? Ear heard. It's a natural ear. Are we together? Amen.

The Bible say the things that God has prepared for who? Those that love him. In other words, there are certain things that belong to you that you're not aware of. You are completely ignorant of that. That's why God say, "I know I know what I already have prepared for you. You are just ignorant until I tell you that since your childhood Amen. I have a bank account for you that I was saving $200. [Music] You didn't know about it until I told you. So when I tell you don't worry, you say, "Daddy, I will go to college. How am I going to pay for my college?" I say, "Don't worry. I know." But daddy, I'm applying for scholarship. I know. I'm saying I know based on what I already prepared. [Applause] In other words, I already have the solution to handle that. Amen. That's right. Amen.

The woman with a blood issue spoke how? How? In her heart. So who was talking? who was talking herself. And why did she came up with that idea? She didn't say, "I'm going to go there so he can pray for me. I'm going to go there so he can lay hand on me." For some reason, she say, "You know what? If I can just touch the hem of his and when she did, it worked." Right. Right. [Applause] It looked like he was heard talking. [Music] And Jesus called that faith revelation. I don't know if we together. Are we together? Hallelujah. Verse uh uh 10. 10. But God has done what? Revealed them to us by what? His spirit. For the spirit does what? searchth all things. Amen. There are so many things in God. And the spirit of the Lord is the one that get inside God. Yes, sir. I'm saying this so you understand. Yes, sir. And begin to search your file. That's right. That's right. That's exactly right. That's exactly. And say, who am I dealing with? Brother Tony Thompson. And the and the Holy Ghost goes and then the spirit searches what? All things. Yeah. The what? Deep things. Amen. Come on. Not the superficial thing. No sir. The superficial everybody knows but the deep things of God. Amen. The things that you don't know. Amen. You are completely ignorant. Amen. The only one who can go there together is the Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. In other words, the Holy Ghost get there and say, "Who am I dealing with?" Elijah. And the Holy Ghost say, "Wait a minute." And he goes into God. That's right. And he goes, he say, "Elijah is right here with the father." Hey boy. And the Holy Spirit comes and say, "Elijah, you want to know what it is? Amen. No, I will get to that. Let me continue. Can I continue? Amen. Can I continue? The Bible says yet the water the deep things of God. So these things are deep deep. Amen. Jesus. Amen. Amen. You know they are superficial stuff and they are deep stuff. You know I have a bank account. You know that. Do you know my pin number? Do you know how much money I know? Those are the deep stuff. If you get access to the deep stuff, [Applause] sir, you can you can make a damage. I don't know if we together. If you get access to the deep stuff, it is dangerous. Yes, sir. because you can reap my bank account. That's why when the seven seal open God kept the seven seal quiet [Applause] brother say there's the reason why the ser was kept quiet because if the devil will catch one thing he will make a lot of damage. So the things deep of God are only talked in secret. Jesus from lip to ear. Yes sir. Yes sir. Amen. Glory. Glory. Glory. Are we together? Amen. Are we together? Amen. There is a code to enter this church. Do you know it? So if you never been in this church, you would tell us about the church outside. How beautifully it look outside, how it's it's this and the parking lot is this. It's superficial stuff. But for you to get the deep things, the inside of the church, yes, sir, you need to have access. And the deep things belong to God. And the spirit of the Lord goes to search the deep things of you. Things that surprises the devil. Yes, sir. [Applause] Yes sir. [Applause] In other words, it's something that when it happen in your life, even Satan say this one, I never thought this one can end up like this. It was hidden because if the devil knew that he would have killed you but God hid it and you are dancing in the night crap and the devil think you are nobody. But if the devil knew you going to be a preacher, that will bring souls to Christ. [Applause] Those things are hidden in God. [Applause] Are we together? Are we together? There are some of us our family member thought you were stupid. Thank you. Our family member thought you are intelligent because you flank out of school. They say this one won't go farther until you reach God and God begin to open the deep princes. Then you are the better of your entire family. Now your family depend on you. [Applause] Are we together? Are we together? Are we together? Are we together? Oh, Jesus. Amen. Have you seen a woman that people say she's ugly? And the people say, "Ah." And we use a fancy word. She's not too attractive. It's a fancy way to say ugly. Ugly to you. Ugly to you. And usually they get the husband that are handsome. And when the people look they say, "Ah, this one really with this boat." What happened to this B? God surprises the devil. [Applause] Can I continue? Can I continue? Where are we at? I told you. Yes, sir. Let's move on. Where are we at? Verse 11. Verse 11. Mhm. Oh, okay. For what man? What knoweth the things of a man? Uhhuh. Save what? The spirit of man which is in him. In other words, the only way you can know what is in a man, you must make a contact with the spirit of a man. That's why brother Brown, I'm under discernment. [Applause] Have to contact your spirit. Because the Bible say that the spirit is the light of the body. So once your spirit is contacted, they use that as a flashlight to begin to pull the deep things that no one knows. That brother Brham doesn't know. But brother Brham can even tell you the doctor and the appointment and where you were. He can go back toward the past and even go to the future. Amen. Because he made contact with your spirit. What about if you make contact to the spirit of God? Then what do you know? Then what do you know? The deep things of God. Are we together? Amen. That's why we can never overemphasize to the need of the Holy Ghost. That's right. That's right, brother. That's right, brother. For the believer, the Holy Ghost is everything. Everything is everything. Yes, sir. Are we together? Are we together? Oh, glory to God. Where are we at, my friend? Verse 11. Uh-huh. And even so, the things of who? God. Knows who? No man. How many men are here? That that word men's means human. How many human beings are here? We don't know the things of God. Come on. But the water spirit of God. So to get access to the things of God, you need to be connected to who? The spirit of God. Are we together? Amen. Jump to verse 12. Now we have received what? Not the spirit of the world. Uhhuh. Because you would know what mean stuff. But the spirit of what? Which is of God. Uhhuh. That we might know the things that are freely given to us. We might know. It's the purpose, the reason why the spirit of God is coming. The reason why the Holy Ghost is coming to you is because God have thoughts. God has things prepared for you. God has deep things prepared for you that you are completely ignorant of. And God is sending the Holy Spirit so that the Holy Spirit may make you know or reveal to you the things that were given to you how freely. How? Freely. Did you pay for it? It is given to you how? Freely. That's why they are painless. [Applause] Amen. The things that you have given to you. out freely. So these thoughts are free. Glory be to God. Freebies. God in his sovereign will. Uhhuh. He say, "Brother Lammo, one, two, three, four." And God put the package and seal it. Amen. When we say, "Brother Lamont, this I'm unworthy." [Applause] insulting the one who thought that you were worthy. He say you are worthy. John, go get the book. Am I worthy? God is telling me to get the book. I don't think twice because he judged me worthy. That book in heaven, no one was worthy. But when the book come on the earth, it's no longer over there. It is my property here now. I am ready. I won't even f I'm going straight ahead and say, "Hey, give it to me." You don't have to pay anything. It's freely. That's why the angel did this. [Music] But do you know, John, give me the book. After they told you go get it, you still come. You say, "Give it to me." And the angel repeated again. He say, "You take it." [Applause] Amen. And do with it what? If you eat something and you digested it become bitter and everything, will you ever discover that thing again? No. So we you you see in uh in Eden, Adam was having the book like this. I'm just giving an illustration. Adam was having a book like this. See, stop. Stop. Okay. Lion come here. He comes. When the trouble came. Amen. God came and say that's right. Amen. Are we together? But after the blood of Calvary, the book came again in the hand. God said, "Don't make the mistake of Adam. Adam didn't eat of the tree of life." Hallelujah. Today, when you see the tree of life, don't waste time. Take the tree of life first so that you can eat it and remain eternal. No matter how you struggle, you are already eternal. No matter what can happen, the book is in you. It will never go back to God. [Music] [Applause] Glory. Are we to God? Are we together? Are we together? Don't keep the message in your hand. No, sir. Put the message in you. [Applause] Are we together? Where are we at, my friend? Verse 13. Verse 13 says what? Which things also we speak. No, no, no, no. Let's keep verse 13. Drop to verse uh 16. Uhhuh. I'm still reading this scripture. Amen. Let's go in verse 16. For who hath known the mind of the Lord to do what? that he may instruct him. Stop. Who have known it? In other words, Job, where were you? Where were you when I was planning all of this? Where were you? But Paul didn't stop there. Continue, my friend. He says what? But we have the mind of Christ. But we have what? The mind of Christ. The mind of Christ is the Holy Ghost. [Applause] I have I have quote after quote. That's why brother Brandham said the mind of Christ is brought to you by the Holy Ghost because it's the Holy Ghost that searches the things of God and bring them to you. And Paul is saying like hey over there nobody was there to tell God anything but now we have that mind. Amen. Amen. Are we together? Amen. In other words, we are no longer ignorant. Amen. We clear. What are you trying to say today, pastor? As we climbing, brother Brham says here in the God who's rich in mercy, he says, I ask him for what? Something sometime. Please keep your seat belt. Okay. 35 miles an hour. And then what? He shakes his head. No. When did you see God shaking his head? You have to see him physically. So shaking his head means what? He might be quiet. He might not answer you. It's a way to say continue. He shake his head and say what? No. Brother Brandham say I just rejoice so much about it as I can if he says what yes in other words God answer whether with a no or a what? Yes. The no is what we don't like. Amen. Let's be honest. We don't like the no. We want when we go we push the button we get it. We push the button we get it. That's right. Brother Brandham said when he says no, I will rejoice the same as water. Yes. Follow me my friend because the reason we always ought to ask what thy will be done. Amen. I will get to this maybe next Sunday or the Sunday that will follow. He's knows just is just if that is what his will. It is. So the knows of God goes with his will. [Applause] Are we together? The knows of God. The knows of God are connected to his will. Are we together? Amen. And then he says that is a whole lot better than his yeses. Amen. In other word, we together. Amen. The knows of God that are in line with his will. Are better than the yeses of God. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Break it down. I don't know if you getting me. Yes, sir. If the not of God is in line with the will of God, come on. For your life, brother. Come on, brother. Amen. Thank you, Lord. Are we together? Amen. It is better than what? His yeses. Because these yeses here are the yeses that are contrary. That's right. Yes, sir. To his will. [Applause] I don't know if we together. I don't know if we together. When a yes is contrary to his will, he put us in a permissive will. [Applause] I told you I'm going slowly with this. Amen. Yes, sir. Amen. Amen. You say what? I rather I'm suffering too much. Please, I know it's your permissive. Will you just give it to me? Can I continue? Can I continue? What God, what makes God answer no is because what you asking is not in his thoughts. [Music] [Applause] Are we together? It is not prepared for you. It is not among the deep things of you. Lord, there is an offer of job in California. I'm going to make a lot of money there. It's $180,000 a year. [Applause] [Music] The spirit of the Lord goes to your foul s and the spirit of the Lord open your f and he said he doesn't see California. [Applause] Do you follow me? Yes sir. What the spirit of the Lord remembered about California is either it will go down in the ocean. And California is a preacher graveyard and the spirit of the Lord come and say no. No. Because it's contrary to his plan for you. Because his plan is a plan of peace. It is not an evil. You're trying to go a different route that will cause you problem. His nose are better. [Applause] Amen. I thought this relationship will work. [Music] I thought that relationship will work. I love him. He's a sweet. He looks good. a wolf in sheep clothing. Very sweet and humble. [Applause] God said, "What is your name?" And the Holy Spirit open your father. He said the name of your husband is this. That one is not your husband. God come and say no. I have a curse in my family. You not under curse. No sir. No sir. There is no curse in your family. Glory to God. [Applause] I know some are PhD in demonology. They see the devil everywhere but they don't see God everywhere. If something happened, I believe it's a curse in my family. My mother suffered that. My uncle suffered that. You a different breed. You are God. [Applause] Adam died. Sat die. Abel died. Enoch came up under the same limit. But Enoch never die. Who told you you're going to go through the same thing? [Music] Can I continue? Can we continue? Hallelujah. Brother Brham say that is a whole lot what better than his yeses. If it is what his will to do it that is when we really do what love. [Applause] [Music] Ecclesiastes 3:1 do everything there is what a season and a purpose and a time to what? Every purpose under the heaven. Under the heaven. Where? under heaven. Who's in heaven? Everybody is under heaven. So under heaven there are laws. Amen. There is a law of time. There is a law of season and there is a law that drive the purpose. So remember that. Are we together? Are we clear together? When it comes to time with God, brother Brham says this. He says, "As I told you before, well, what many times, time and sight is what? The worst enemies that God has God has a problem with sight and time. God has a problem with that. Sight and time, time and sight. You look at water." Neither one of them declares anything about God because God is in eternity. You understand this? Now sir when he looked at Thomas he said you saw that's the reason why you believe but blessed are those because whatever is existing today was not visible. No sir. The Bible say the visible came from the invisible. So God is more in the invisible than the visible. God is in the back part. There is there is there is there is you know the teller that you go at the bank and you talk to the teller and they take your money they put they withdraw the money they give it to you. Do you know the manager of the bank? Those are not really the bank. Those are the visible bank. The true bank, the one that kick you with overdraft. It's not those people. They are on the back. You don't see them. You don't go there. They don't give you access to that. They only give you access to the branches. Those are the one that work the true deal. Amen. The one who's talking to you about the loan is not the one deciding the underrered that you don't see. This is the one that's saying yes or no to the loan. Are we together? Are we together? We fall in love with the banker because he's sweet. But when you are sleeping at night, that's when banker are changing stuff. Yes sir. When you wake up in the morning, your deposit is showing up. Yes sir. Can I continue? Yes sir. Brother say you want it done. How? Spontaneously. When God does what? Takes his time about things. God take his time. In other words, God is not uh somebody that you can uh I mean uh uh trigger or or or or frustrate quickly and he say God doesn't do that. He take his time because he knows amen. Are we together? And on our end the Bible says that brother Brandham say let's remember why we are doing what? Obeying the spirit the one who bring us stuff. One great lesson that we want to learn is what? Never be hastily. Everybody's married, getting married. Never be hastily. Everybody's buying houses. Never be hasty. You going to get into a high interest. Because it's not your time. We are not in competition. No sir. No sir. Amen. Are you Are we together? Even twins get married different. You want to get married the same time. See, take your time. Take your time. I'm reading brother Brandham. Brother Brandham says what? Take your time. And do what? Have faith. If we have asked God for what? Anything. Remember God does what? Answers prayer. He does it when in his time the way it is how best and make it work just right for what us according to your own plan [Applause] father Steven we talking about purpose brother Braham says Jesus here was speaking he says what father what the time has come now there is season for what everything do you believe that yes you sow when in a certain season and you reap when in a certain season and there is season when the time come that is right for things to what happen so there are time that are wrong for things to happen it's not just the time right are we together amen are we together amen are we together amen sir now back up very well we talking about purpose purposemen Amen. We understand time. We understand season. We are talking about purpose. A purpose is a name. A I am or a goal. Yes, sir. Or a desired result. Amen. Amen. or a reason for something to be created. Amen. Or a reason that something is existing. Amen. That is what a purpose is. Amen. Are we together? The Bible says, follow me my friend in John 1:1 that in the beginning was what? The word. And the word was with who? God. So God was before the word. Exactly. I told you follow me. In the beginning was what? The word. And the word was with what? God. So here is the beginning. Yes, sir. Before the beginning, there was who? God. Are we together? In the beginning was what? The word. The word was with who? God. And the word was who? God. Are we together? Amen. And the word was made how? Flesh. The word become human. Amen. And when the word was made flesh, he was called Emmanuel. [Applause] Which means what? In the beginning was what? The word. And the word was with who? God. And the word was what? God. And when the word was made flesh, he was called what? God. Emmanuel, which means what? God with us. So the word made flesh was God. Mhm. And the word was God. Amen. And God was God. [Applause] If I lost you, raise your hand. Are we together? In other word, the nature of this being never change. Amen. Despite the various form this being is taking he's just changing form changing mask immort. But if you look on the inside it's the same person. Are we together? This word here is called theophani. Amen. It is a form of God. Are we together? It is also called the pillar of fire. Are we together? This one, the Hebrew call him Elohim. Are we together? But this word, the Bible say everything that existed. That's right. That's right, brother. Amen. Do you follow me? Amen. One, two, three. The Bible say everything that was that existed never was created by one. It's if if you don't say amen, we open the Bible. Do you know where it is? Do you know where it is? Open John one. Don't like people to stay ignorant. of the things that were freely given to them. Amen. Amen. Let's go to verse one. John 1:1. In the beginning was what? The word. Please follow me. I'm begging you. And the word was what? With God. And the word was what? God. The same was in the beginning with who? God. Watch verse three. How many things? All things were made by who? By him. And without water? Him was not anything made that was what made. So God created everything by the second form. Yes sir. I don't know if you talk you understanding me. That's right. When I say shows, it's a word. That's right. Yes. But that word is not just word. It has a meaning. It's speaking about a person that is called Charles. Are we together? So the word got a touch if I tell you Joshua in your mind, you know what I'm talking about. You even have an image. So Joshua is just not a word. It's a thought. And as a matter of fact, it's a person and it's a person talking. But before he become Joshua talking and a person and whatever you know about him, he was first a taught. Glory to God. Are we together? Are we together? Are we together? So the word here is the pe the divine package. Follow me my friend of the thoughts of God. Amen. Amen. Amen. So every every thought that was in God, God poured them all in the word. Follow me, my friend. Follow me, my friend. And God enter the word and begin to use the software of the word to create everything. [Applause] And there is nothing that existed That was not created by the word. Amen. That word is called theophony. It is called the pill of fire. It is called the logos. [Music] [Applause] [Music] So the logos is the one that have every thoughts of God inside him. Amen. If you want to know things about God, make a contact to the logos. [Applause] Amen. Amen. If you want to know the thoughts of God, contact the light, [Applause] contact the pillar of fire, contact the theophony. That's why before brother Brham start the discernment he must wait for the pillar of fire. Are we together? As soon as the pillar of fire enter brother say I take every spirit under my control because the master has come. The supreme intelligence came. In other words, brother Brandham become a knowing all. He can be here and say you that are over there because the pillar of fire is delivering the thoughts. Yes sir. my Amen. Amen. Are we together? Amen. Until brother can even turn the house and tell you who you are. Yes sir. Yes sir. He was not William my young brother. He was the pillar of fire. He was God the pillar of fire. Yes sir.

[Applause] Are we together? I am still at the beginning. Now, where are you going with this pastor? Because of this, we lost our knowledge. That's correct. Amen. Because of this, sir, we are not aware of the free thoughts of the things God prepared for us. Of the deep things of God. So God now have to send the Holy Ghost. That's right. That's right. to connect you back to that knowledge. Amen. I don't know if we together. The reason why the reason that because of bypassing our theophony, he created a gap. Amen. Amen.

[Applause] Amen. Are we together? Are we together? You can read the Bible and when you connect to the theophony, you begin to see that scripture differently because the theophony begin to teach you. He's using the preacher and you say, "Oh my god, I see it now." That's why the Bible says this. It is your theony proceeding. Amen. And you talk to somebody, he say, "How did you know this?" Yeah, it's in the Bible. How do you know this? How do you know it? Did you go to school to know it? How do you know it? Somebody's teaching you. Somebody who knows the word.

[Music] Because that person knows the mind of God. Amen. And if you ask anything according to his will, his mind, [Applause] you won't receive no I don't know if we together because of this situation here. A big chunk of our life is mysterious. And a big chunk of our life is filled with questions. Yes. Why? Why? That's right. Why did this happen? Why didn't I avoid this? Why did I end up here? Why did I go through this? Why shouldn't I even have listened to my mother? What makes me move here? I wish I would have known this a long time ago. Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? All type of why. Oh my god. Bear with me my friend.

They were not supposed to be pastor. They became pastor by circumstances. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Amen. Don't say amen. Because God's sheep must be fed. They must be open. They must be taught. They must know the will of God for their life. [Applause] I cannot sit in the church where I don't see progression. I must progress spiritually. I must be a growth. [Applause] Are we together?

You want to give the testimony so the whole world will understand. You will know and will be encouraged. You go somewhere. I can give my testimony among young sister, among young brothers. You forgot how you were crying. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you humbly this afternoon. Father, we thank you for your grace for your love and for your mercy and for this message that have opened up completely and tore down the mysterious part of our life so that now we begin to understand many things. That's why David said that though I walk in the midst of a valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. David understood that even if everything is dark, there is a shadow following him. There is a God that is there. He's not only the God of the mountain, he's also the God of the valley. He already planned everything and there is no places that we go through that you cannot go. You even went to the place that we will never go. You went to hell and we will never go to hell. We are doomed straight to go to the rapture. Father, what else can we say but thank you. Thank you Jesus. May you remove this anxiety, this pressure, every frustration that is coming, all the questioning in our mind. Today we understood that there is a big chunk of our life that we have bypassed. There is a big chunk of our life that is a mystery. But that mystery, the end of it is expected. The end is a good hand. It's a hopeful hand. You have a future for us. You have a plan of peace, Lord. Father, may you bless this congregation. I went a little bit over, but Father, may everything that was spoken, may the spirit of the Lord take it and go deep again and unfold more than what was spoken here. Lord, Lord, I spoke about the pulpit and the pastor, not to make myself like the only pebble on the beach. We are many, but Lord, Father, the hour has come where wrong have to be called out because your children are suffering for these type of things, Lord. But Lord, Father, I pray that you provide adequate food, Lord. because you say that the field is there but you ask us to pray for the labor so that they can go work on your vineyard Lord.
