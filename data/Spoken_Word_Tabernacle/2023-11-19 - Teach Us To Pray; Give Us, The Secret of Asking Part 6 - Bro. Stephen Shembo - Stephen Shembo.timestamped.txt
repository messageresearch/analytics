[0:00] oh when man sinned he crossed a great
[0:03] Chasm but put between him and God
[0:06] leaving his way back none and then God
[0:09] took a substitute offered a substitute
[0:12] and accepted it then if man would accept
[0:14] this substitute for his place then he
[0:16] could cross back into fellowship with
[0:18] God as it said at the beginning and then
[0:20] man for years went about through the
[0:22] blood of goats and sheep and animals
[0:25] they could never take away sin it only
[0:27] covered sin but then what happened
[0:30] what happened one day there comes
[0:32] something that could remit sin the blood
[0:35] of his own son and he remitted sin now
[0:38] here not long ago I won't know there may
[0:40] be scientists that here I'm going to
[0:42] make a remark and I'm just going to call
[0:43] it something it doesn't mean that at all
[0:45] but I'm going to say we used to we get
[0:48] like one little simple drop of ink God
[0:50] can hide himself in that see if it's a
[0:53] drop of ink it had to be something
[0:55] before it was a drop of ink let's see
[0:57] what it is the first it's a drop of ink
[0:59] what is it it's chem chemicals we break
[1:01] it back where did it come from well you
[1:03] say then from uh it's water that's H2O a
[1:06] farmer that's part of it then it's got a
[1:08] chemical in it of color where did the
[1:10] color come from now there's only one
[1:12] original color and that's white we know
[1:13] that all other colors are made off of
[1:15] white so then we find out how did it

[1:03:55] tomorrow you're going to believe it if
[1:03:58] they tell you that come tomorrow you're
[1:03:59] going to have a body change then you
[1:04:02] begin to search court in the morning all
[1:04:04] the time to make sure where is this
[1:04:05] coming
[1:04:07] from amen amen it's human being amen
[1:04:12] amen verse
[1:04:13] 26 the Bible say behold the fou of the
[1:04:18] for they do what s not neither do they
[1:04:21] what reap nor what gather into B have a
[1:04:24] bank account yet your heavenly father do
[1:04:28] what Feth
[1:04:31] them are you not much better than
[1:04:35] they because they don't have a
[1:04:38] soul they are not even created in the
[1:04:41] image of God but you are created in the
[1:04:44] image and the likeness of God why you
[1:04:51] wored foul don't have blood pressure
[1:04:55] that's right Bird don't have blood
[1:04:57] pressure because they don't worry they
[1:04:59] learn to just depend on
[1:05:02] God amen amen verse uh 27 which of You
[1:05:08] by taking thoughts or worry can add one
[1:05:12] cubit to his statue since you worry how
[1:05:15] many inches did you
[1:05:19] gain how many trouble did you bring to
[1:05:22] yourself how many weight did you
[1:05:25] lose since you start
[1:05:28] worrying so it doesn't do you no good
[1:05:32] amen amen you don't understand what I go
[1:05:34] through brother Steven and why take you
[1:05:37] thought for
[1:05:38] Remnant consider the lies of the field
[1:05:42] how they grow they to not neither do
[1:05:45] they spin and yet I say to you that even
[1:05:49] Solomon
[1:05:51] artificial in all his glory men M Glory
[1:05:55] was not a ray like one of
[1:05:58] these in other word their clothing is
[1:06:01] original we
[1:06:03] clear wherefore if God so clothe the
[1:06:07] grass of the field which today is and
[1:06:10] tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he
[1:06:14] not much more cloth you oh you of what
[1:06:17] little faith we went through this amen
[1:06:20] therefore what is the lesson take take
[1:06:23] no thoughts go ahead my brother saying
[1:06:25] what shall we eat clear or what shall we
[1:06:28] drink or or wherewith shall we be
[1:06:31] clothed for after all these things do
[1:06:34] the who gentille
[1:06:37] seek so when you start worrying about
[1:06:40] this thing you begin to act like a
[1:06:44] heathen like somebody who doesn't have
[1:06:47] faith you know different than a heathen
[1:06:51] amen amen for your heavenly father
[1:06:54] father knows that you have need of what
[1:06:57] all these
[1:06:59] things so God again knows that we need
[1:07:04] all of these thing how can God say give
[1:07:08] us this day our daily bread when he
[1:07:12] already knows he say do not worry about
[1:07:15] it I know you have need of then the same
[1:07:19] God comes and say when you talk to me
[1:07:22] ask me give me bread
[1:07:27] why do we need to ask if he knows if we
[1:07:31] don't have to worry about it let's go to
[1:07:33] Luke chapter
[1:07:40] 11 if not we will repeat these uh these
[1:07:44] things like Catholic

[1:08:14] to him Lord teach us to pray as John
[1:08:17] also taught his disciple we clear and he

[1:08:38] word every day not just one day every
[1:08:42] single day day by day you have to ask

[1:08:50] when you already know what we
[1:08:52] need and we have to ask not once day by

[1:19:26] you're talking about praying asking what
[1:19:29] is the secret of asking let's go to the
[1:19:32] Book of
[1:19:34] Genesis we know that last Sunday when we
[1:19:38] talk in the Book of Genesis we found out
[1:19:41] that in Genesis chapter 1 verse
[1:19:45] 29 amen amen God gave man his future uh
[1:19:51] food right you remember that amen
[1:19:53] because the Bible used the word sh
[1:19:55] because man was still in the spirit amen
[1:19:59] and in verse 30 he gave the
[1:20:02] animal the F yeah and the creeping
[1:20:06] things their
[1:20:08] diet amen amen now let's go to Genesis
[1:20:12] 2: 7 follow me carefully please if you
[1:20:17] there you can say amen amen Genesis 2ter
[1:20:20] 7 now man is is no longer a
[1:20:25] spirit man move from a spirit into a
[1:20:29] body we clear amen now it's no longer
[1:20:33] you shall eat now men need to eat we
[1:20:37] clear verse uh seven the Bible says
[1:20:42] this that and the Lord God form men of
[1:20:47] the Dust of the ground this is your body
[1:20:50] your clothing your garment which only
[1:20:52] God can give you and God breathed into
[1:20:56] his nostril the breath of life and Man
[1:21:00] became a what living Soul For the First
[1:21:03] Time the name
[1:21:05] Soul appear in the
[1:21:09] scripture everybody okay amen at the
[1:21:11] beginning we have a spirit now for the
[1:21:15] first time the word Soul appear in the
[1:21:19] in the scripture in other words God is
[1:21:21] highlighting something we clear amen now
[1:21:25] man is now a two du is a dual
[1:21:31] being now man is a
[1:21:35] natural or physical being that came from
[1:21:39] the dust of the Earth right are we there
[1:21:43] and there is a part of man that is
[1:21:46] spiritual amen amen by that we have his
[1:21:50] spirit and we have his soul
[1:21:54] we clear we
[1:21:56] clear job to verse 8 and the Lord
[1:22:00] planted a garden Eastward in Eden and
[1:22:05] there he put the man whom he had
[1:22:09] formed and out of the ground we clear
[1:22:13] made the Lord
[1:22:15] grow made the Lord God to grow every
[1:22:19] tree that is how pleasant to the sight
[1:22:23] and what good for food because men need
[1:22:25] food we clear so God as a provider begin
[1:22:31] to provide for the food of his child
[1:22:35] quickly because the baby is
[1:22:37] born he's born on the Earth Adam now is
[1:22:40] Born the only problem he doesn't have
[1:22:43] the belly
[1:22:46] button because Adam was delivered not
[1:22:49] from a woman amen no belly Buton the
[1:22:51] only one who did it in heaven Adam
[1:22:54] amen we clear are we clear amen so God
[1:22:58] begin to bring the food of Adam and he
[1:23:00] bring the food from Every Good Tree in
[1:23:03] other word god begin to
[1:23:06] supply the natural food from the
[1:23:10] tree we
[1:23:12] clear verse uh n and a good for food the
[1:23:18] tree of life
[1:23:21] also and everybody okay how can man eat
[1:23:28] life can you take life and say oh this
[1:23:30] is life and you begin to eat life but
[1:23:33] God Among the food he introduced another
[1:23:37] food which is called the tree of
[1:23:40] life because man is
[1:23:45] doer are we together man is double
[1:23:50] amen amen so God God as a provider must
[1:23:54] provide natural food and also spiritual
[1:23:58] food are we together amen are we claming
[1:24:01] together so the spiritual food is what
[1:24:05] the tree of
[1:24:07] [Applause]
[1:24:07] [Music]
[1:24:10] lifeall Glory to God amen amen come on
[1:24:14] and the tree and the tree of what
[1:24:17] knowledge of Good and Evil and the tree
[1:24:20] of knowledge of good and what evil stop
[1:24:23] who eat good and evil you say this is
[1:24:25] good and evil okay and you start eating
[1:24:27] it it is a spiritual food
[1:24:30] also but it's pretty bad amen it's a
[1:24:34] food that is
[1:24:36] mixed are we together amen so God is
[1:24:40] bringing to one many several natural
[1:24:44] food and he also bring two spiritual
[1:24:48] food one is called the tree of life and
[1:24:51] another one is called the tree of what
[1:24:53] knowledge of Good and Evil knowledge of
[1:24:55] good and what evil and
[1:24:58] evil amen amen so if man eat from the
[1:25:03] fruit his body is
[1:25:05] healthy we clear amen but his Spirit
[1:25:08] cannot eat fruit his spirit either will
[1:25:12] eat from the Tree of Life or the spirit
[1:25:15] will eat for the tree of the knowledge
[1:25:16] of Good and
[1:25:18] Evil we need to know first before we
[1:25:21] continue what the result of every tree
[1:25:26] amen are we together are we together
[1:25:30] amen we are there drop a little bit to
[1:25:32] verse
[1:25:33] 22 and then we're going to go back again
[1:25:36] if you there you can say amen
[1:25:40] amen uh job to verse 17 I'm sorry you
[1:25:44] there amen but of the tree of the
[1:25:47] knowledge of Good and Evil you shall not
[1:25:50] what eat of it so you need to eat it's
[1:25:52] something you can eat
[1:25:54] comestible but not in the natural can I
[1:25:57] continue you shall not eat of it for in
[1:26:01] the day that you eat thereof you shall
[1:26:03] what surely die so this fruit this tree
[1:26:07] when you eat it you get
[1:26:11] death everybody okay we need to know
[1:26:14] what happened when you get also the Tree
[1:26:16] of

[1:26:26] 22 you there amen and the Lord God say
[1:26:30] behold the man is become as what one of
[1:26:33] us to know good and what evil and now
[1:26:35] let he put forth his hand and take also
[1:26:38] of the tree of what life and do what eat
[1:26:42] and live how forever let's go back where
[1:26:44] we are amen so if you take the tree of
[1:26:47] life you live how
[1:26:50] forever if you you take the tree of the
[1:26:53] knowledge of Good and Evil what happen
[1:26:55] death so God is supplying the food
[1:26:58] because the baby's born amen are we
[1:27:01] clear are we clear all of this is
[1:27:05] food food how naturally and how
[1:27:10] spiritual but his boy needs something to
[1:27:19] drink natural bread plus what
[1:27:22] no water we clear so Adam need water he
[1:27:26] cannot be eating eating eating without
[1:27:33] drinking who who's who's eating a home
[1:27:36] and doesn't
[1:27:39] drink we clear am let me show you your
[1:27:43] God our God you there you there amen go
[1:27:47] back to verse 10 because we finish verse

[1:40:01] woman am I reading a different Bible no
[1:40:04] let's read it
[1:40:06] together let's read it together let's
[1:40:10] read let's go to verse 22 go my friend
[1:40:12] go my friend and the rib which the Lord
[1:40:15] God had taken from manh made he a woman
[1:40:18] and did what and brought her unto the
[1:40:20] land Adam said what this is now bone he
[1:40:23] never even say this is what I was
[1:40:27] missing because God is supplying
[1:40:31] everything he never said this is what I
[1:40:34] was missing no as soon hey and another
[1:40:39] spee this is a woman you came from me

[1:41:11] Adam but Adam never seen the the the
[1:41:15] part he was missing he never seen what
[1:41:18] he was missing that's the reason why

[1:42:33] that gave it to me the woman you
[1:42:34] remember the woman that you gave
[1:42:40] me can I continue can I continue amen
[1:42:44] can I continue Amen in other word
[1:42:46] everything for Adam is taken for
[1:42:49] granted
[1:42:50] [Applause]
[1:42:55] listen to brother Bram here brother Bram
[1:42:57] say he was born in this great we wheat
[1:43:00] belt which when whe comes for it is what
[1:43:04] the basic principles of life and he was
[1:43:07] the bread of what life I am the bread of
[1:43:09] life he that eats my flesh and drink my
[1:43:11] blood has what eternal life and shall
[1:43:13] never die or come into what condemnation
[1:43:16] but has passed from Death unto what life
[1:43:18] bread is the basic principles of life
[1:43:22] amen God Supply it watch again brother
[1:43:26] Bram says this oh don't you see the
[1:43:29] connection between the man he promised
[1:43:32] our what bread and water is sure we
[1:43:35] clear amen our bread our food and our
[1:43:40] what water is what sure and God will do
[1:43:43] it just as certain as we are setting the
[1:43:47] and every Divine promise he has made his
[1:43:50] is obligated to what do it so God
[1:43:53] supplied the food and the water and once
[1:43:57] he did it Adam got
[1:44:02] come he became
[1:44:04] comfortable because there is no worry
[1:44:07] amen listen to this in 1 Corinthians
[1:44:10] chapter 10:3 when Israel was going out
[1:44:13] of Egypt Paul says and did all and and
[1:44:17] did all and did all eat the same what
[1:44:21] spiritual meat and did all drink the
[1:44:23] same water spiritual drink so God
[1:44:25] provided the meat and the
[1:44:28] drink and they drunk of the spiritual
[1:44:31] rock that followed them and that rock
[1:44:32] was who Christ so God gave the food and
[1:44:35] the drink together amen because it's the
[1:44:38] basic principle of life we clear listen
[1:44:43] to this that is why he was born in
[1:44:46] Bethlehem of Judea he credle him and my
[1:44:50] brother the place he want to be created
[1:44:52] today is in your own being your own
[1:44:55] water heart that he might display from
[1:44:57] you the water Waters of life to a
[1:45:00] perishing people and the water bread of
[1:45:02] life to a starving people he is the
[1:45:05] water bread and water of life which is
[1:45:08] the two what essential things to a man's
[1:45:11] living the two essential thing to a man
[1:45:14] living is what bread and water and it's
[1:45:17] promised how for sure so God provided
[1:45:21] the water and the bread for Adam for
[1:45:24] sure and Adam got
[1:45:27] complacent and he didn't realize that he
[1:45:30] needed something else and when God
[1:45:32] brought him what he needed for what he
[1:45:36] lacked because Adam was incomplete
[1:45:38] without Eve when they created him in
[1:45:41] Genesis 1 he was man and female when
[1:45:44] they put him in Genesis 2 he lacked
[1:45:46] something but he didn't realize that he
[1:45:49] was missing something and God brought
[1:45:51] him the missing part and when trouble
[1:45:53] come he say hey you know the missing
[1:45:56] part that you brought me you know the
[1:45:58] woman that you gave it to me she's the
[1:46:00] one that caused this thing in other word
[1:46:02] it was God
[1:46:04] Waring but not
[1:46:07] Adam are we together are we together are
[1:46:11] we together there is a principle that
[1:46:14] I'm going to say here Paul says John
[1:46:17] says this John answered and said a man
[1:46:21] can receive what
[1:46:23] nothing come out
[1:46:27] except except what except he be given
[1:46:31] him from what heaven so anything that
[1:46:33] you have must come from where Heaven
[1:46:36] everything that you have comes from
[1:46:37] Heaven 1 Corinthians chap 4:7 the Bible
[1:46:42] says this for who made the to to die
[1:46:46] from another and was and what has that
[1:46:50] that that did not receive in other word
[1:46:53] everything that we have we receive it
[1:46:56] now if that did
[1:46:58] receive why do you
[1:47:00] glory as if you had not received in
[1:47:04] other word everything that we have God
[1:47:07] Supply it if you understand that it's
[1:47:10] coming from God you should not be proud
[1:47:14] because what do you have that you did
[1:47:16] not receive the call you have God Gave
[1:47:19] You amen they have you have God Gave You
[1:47:21] amen the shoes you have God Gave You am
[1:47:24] this church came from God Amen this pit
[1:47:27] come from God Amen so he bring us to
[1:47:30] humility to realize that we depend from
[1:47:34] everything from
[1:47:36] God in other word if you see somebody
[1:47:40] that is proud they don't understand
[1:47:43] proud because they think they did it but
[1:47:47] if you realize that I didn't do it it is
[1:47:50] God that did it he bring humility in
[1:47:53] your life
[1:47:54] [Applause]

[2:39:44] given
[2:39:46] father help me I am a 40% my friend let
[2:39:50] me try to see if I can move Amen brother
[2:39:53] stepen I ask but nothing
[2:39:55] happened I ask nothing happened what
[2:39:58] happened James say this if any of you
[2:40:02] lack what
[2:40:04] wisdom what does he have to do ask of
[2:40:08] God is that complicated no ask of God
[2:40:13] that do what and that giveth to all men
[2:40:17] liberally if he give to all men
[2:40:19] liberally why do we have to ask
[2:40:21] him ask him ask him that give to all men
[2:40:25] what liberally and do what upth now we
[2:40:28] already explained you this and it shall
[2:40:30] be what given him forget about the word
[2:40:32] in the green let's go to the word in
[2:40:34] pink let him ask of God and he shall be
[2:40:38] what given him do you see that in other
[2:40:40] words if you lack something do never
[2:40:43] hesitate go straight to God ask for him
[2:40:47] God already knows that you lack wisdom
[2:40:51] but he wants you to
[2:40:55] ask verse six go ahead my friend but let
[2:40:57] him ask in faith nothing
[2:41:01] wavering how do you ask in faith the
[2:41:04] problem is ask how in faith ask in faith
[2:41:07] not what wavering not wavering for he
[2:41:09] that what waver is like a what a wave of
[2:41:12] the sea driven with the wind and toss
[2:41:15] for let that man think that he shall
[2:41:18] receive what anything of the Lord in
[2:41:20] other word the problem is when you
[2:41:22] approaching him you don't trust
[2:41:25] him that's why it doesn't work you
[2:41:28] trying to figure it out how he's going
[2:41:30] to do God don't want you to figure it
[2:41:32] out remember Satan remember the devil
[2:41:36] remember C they didn't stop and think
[2:41:39] twice they knew who God was you go
[2:41:42] straight with faith because he's the
[2:41:44] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[2:41:47] after him amen listen from uh verse
[2:41:50] James 4 from where cometh War and what
[2:41:53] fighting among you cometh not H even to
[2:41:56] your own what lust that was in what your
[2:41:59] members ye lust and ye have not you kill
[2:42:02] you desire to have and you what can
[2:42:05] cannot you cannot obtain you fight and
[2:42:07] War you have what not why because he ask
[2:42:11] not so the majority of your trouble you
[2:42:15] the one that cause it because you never
[2:42:18] ask for
[2:42:20] help everybody okay he says ye ask and
[2:42:24] do what receive not why because he ask a
[2:42:28] miss that you may what consume it upon
[2:42:30] your lust so when you asking make sure
[2:42:33] you cross two things make sure you
[2:42:35] asking with faith and make sure you
[2:42:38] don't ask for your last in other words
[2:42:41] you got to check your
[2:42:43] motive and your objective amen if your
[2:42:47] motive and your objective is right God
[2:42:50] is under obligation to give you what you
[2:42:53] want am I'm going to skip some of them
