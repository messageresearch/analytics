Lord God the hours has come for you to speak so may you speak Lord God I Abend everything else unto you and this sermon unto you in Jesus Christ's name I pray amen amen um if we could go to the scripture reading this evening first king Chapter 19 Verse 5 to10 if you're dare can you say Amen now first king chapter 19:5 says this and as he lay and slept under a Jenifer tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat and he looked and behold there was a cake bacing on the cold and a cruise of water at his head and he did eat and drink and laid him down again and the angel of the Lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee and he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of the meat 40 days and 40 nights onto the herb the Mount of God and he came thether unto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the Lord came to him and he said unto him what do what doest thou here Elijah and he said I have been very jealous for the Lord God of of hosts for the children of Israel have forsaken thy Covenant drwn down thy Altar and slain thy prophets with the sword and I even I alone am left and they seek my life to take it away may the Lord God bless the reading of his word you may be seated now the thing that I wanted you that I want to attract you from the scriptures the fact that the Lord God when Elijah because the prophet of God said this was after Elijah had done great wonders brought down the rain and stopped the rain rather and brought down the fire and the moment when Jezebel had threatened his life Elijah had ran away the prophet of God say he got out of the inspiration of God and when he went he ran away God had came to um Elijah and when God came to Elijah God started waking him up and feeding him and waking him up and feeding him and Elijah had to be sensitive to the spirit of God to know when God came so he may wake up and feed upon the word that God was giving unto him because the prophet of God also said after he was after Elijah fed upon the word after he was done eating and he went on that Journey for 40 days and 40 night the prophet of God said that he was wandering Elijah was wandering as he was walking until when he came unto a cave he had came to himself the prophet of God said he came to himself and when he came to himself there was winds that were blowing and Thunders that were blowing but he stayed still until a calm still voice had came see Elijah had to stayed still so he can detect the voice of God coming to him and if you and if you would take um Luke chapter 8 verse 43 chapter 8 verse 43 with me now in Luke chapter 8 verse 43- 48 it says and a woman having an issue of blood 12 years which had spent all her living upon Physicians neither neither could be healed of any came behind him and touched the border of His Garment and immediately her issues of blood St standard stened and Jesus said who touched me when all denied Peter and they that were with him said Master the multitude thred thee and pray thee and sayest thou who touched thee who touched me and Jesus said somebody have touched me for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me and and when the woman saw that she was not ahead she came trembling and fell falling down before him she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately and he said unto her daughter be of good Comfort thy faith have made thee whole go in peace now I want for my subject tonight I'm want to speak about reens resensitization to the Spirit by the word resensitization by resensitization to the Spirit by the word now the word resensitization if we had a first break it down the word sensitization which means to be sensitive by the by the definition of it being sensitive means to be quick to detect or respond to a signal or to a issue now we find out over here Jesus Christ as he was walking and after that he sensed someone touch me he sensed virtue leave out of him because Jesus says I perceive perceive means to be aware of and the prophet of God has said that Jesus Christ because Jesus said he does nothing unless if the father has showed him to do so and the prophet of God said in this specific Instinct Jesus had didn't see any vision from the father Jesus had not seen anything but as he was walking because Jesus Christ is God himself the spirit of God full bodily is inside Jesus Christ that mean he's constantly sensitive to the spirit and he's conly sensitive to also the spirits around him that mean the moment somebody had touched him and Jesus Christ felt that connection of someone touching him in a specific type of way with a specific intention Jesus felt virtue leave him and the prophet of God said that Jesus Christ felt a little bit weaker and that's that's being sensitive now resensitization means to go back to to be connected again in in another way now as we see the Prophet Elijah he used to be connected to God as he was walking that's why he stopped he could stop the rain that's why he could bring the fire down he was connected to God but when um Jezebel had came in and after threatened his life he started he got out of the inspiration of God and after he left the the sensitivity of God he he stopped being connected to him till he had to go back inside the cave until he had to come back to himself to be connected to be connected um with God again which which is kind of the type of the human being when when we were created when God had created us he had created us he made us bypass our theophany and we automatically by default were subjected to the five senses and the five senses is something that you cannot connect God With God you cannot sense you cannot be sensitive to the spirit with the five senses brother brandom even say you cannot be sensitive to the five Spirit by the senses in um 1951 faith is the substance brother brandom says but when men was put in human flesh then God gave him five senses to to contact not God but his Earthly home these things the senses of the body is only to declare or to contact Earthly things here on Earth not Heavenly things and then your inward man is the spirit which has two senses faith and unbelief you see and in the pillar of fire of 1953 paragraph 17 brother BR says now the world's without form and void and water was upon the Deep where where in Genesis 1 now see then he made all the plants live then after a while he made man in his own image that was the spirit man and if he made man in his own image he had to make him him something on the order of that supernatural being that's right when there was no man to tell the soil Genesis 2 then he made out of the Dust of the earth not in His image but Out of the Dust of the earth he might he might give him a hand like a monkey and a foot like a bear I don't know what he give him but he pull him in five senses to contact the Earth home see our five senses are was given to us to contact the Earth to contact the stuff of the earth that's why it's easier for us to sympathize with the desires of the world sometimes it's easier for us but that six sense when he comes he puts all the five sense into a subjective two way you see and in faith is the Sixth Sense brother Brenham says paragraph 6 1960 he says if we could only be spiritual and use the six sense we how many things we could bypass how many things would know if the church was in order where the spirits and the gifts of the church would be operating would have ananas and safaris laying all over everywhere that's right sin would be out of the church but we become so Earth bounded with our senses so just so well if I can't see it if I can't and then them senses the devil gets into those senses and he will let you see something your eyes and then disbelief it anyhow because many times you've kept your eyes closed so long until you're blind now brother Brenham also says in 1959 of here is th Elijah he says that and when we find him now in the cave way back pulled up in the cave and God wanted to talk to him and the Bible said that there was a great Mighty Wind went by and then the earthquake and then the great tearing up and shaking but Elijah just sat sat still and after a while there was a still Small Voice spoke and Elijah recognized that to be God and he put the manle over his face and walked out to meet him I would I wonder if we the church wasn't Listen to Too Much rushing wind and and thunder and blood and lightning until we fell to hear that's still small voice and it's time to come back to it now you see when I was reading this see there's a story that comes um in mind to this too which is the story of King soul I had asked several people like what do you know about King soul and most of the time it's negative when I went back to read the story of soul soul from a young age he was actually a pretty good boy from the start his father had told so so like his father had lost three donkeys and his father told so so go find the donkeys that we lost take a servant with you and sa was obedient because he took the servant with him and he went looking for the he went looking for the three donkeys now sa was someone that was sensitive to both God and his father and the reason why I see he was sensitive to his father is because on his way as the day went by and the days were was going to go past so had told servant let us not t let us hurry up so we can go back before our father leaves the other flocks of donkeys and start worrying about us and start thinking about us see he was being considered he was since so was living with his father for a certain period of time he KN he knew how his father would act he knew how his father would respond because he was sensitive to his father now when so um when so had when he was on his way back to go back he heard that there was a man of God in the City nearby and the thought came to so he was like let us stop by the man of God and as I was reading the Scripture it thought came to me he was like seek you first the king of the God and all shall follow and at at the time I didn't know what I didn't know why God had given me that but then we we found out when Soul came to Samuel the prophet Samuel God had actually revealed to Samuel before Soul came that Soul was going to come because the prophet Samuel was also a man that was sensitive to the spirit of God now when Soul came to Samuel Samuel had told him oh I was expecting you I was expecting you to come in fact the three donkeys that you were looking for you don't need to look for them anymore because they already found the Lord God already found it then in my mind I was like ah that now I know why God had given me the thought the Revelation that oh at this place when Soul was going to seek for the man of God that he was seeking the kingdom and once he arrived to the man of God as arriving at the Kingdom everything followed them everything he was looking for was so now he stayed with the prophet of God and the prophet of God was talking to him and as he was talking to him he was basically feeding on the word with him and when when they were done so got up and went back home and when he went back home it was another day and his father had already left the three donkeys and he was already worried showing that so since he grew up with with his father and he was sensitive to his father he knew how his father would react and the fact that his father reacted how he had how he sensed he would react that shows that so was sensitive to his father now the thing about Saul is when he stayed with the prophet as in when he stayed with the word he received a new heart and when he received a new heart he he became more sensitive to God to the point where God had came down in inside soul the spirit of God came inside so which is a type of receiving the Holy Ghost he came inside so and he started prophesying that people started asking so you're are you one of the prophets and even other people that knew him they were like is this the same soul that we knew that's prophesying but the issue with soul was when he got into the word he got he ended up straying away by the five senses by by he ended up straying away by the um by he ended up straying away by the desires of the World by being a people pleaser and by him being a people pleaser he deviated from the word of God the first time he deviated was when he didn't um follow the order of waiting for Samuel so Samuel can give a sacrifice and the second time he deviated he deviated by not killing all the amalekites and here's the thing since so after he fell the first time he already got desensitized away from God that mean he wasn't sensitive to God anymore and the proof of that is the fact that after he killed the amalekites and he left the king and left certain um herbs he came to so he came to Samuel and he started telling Samuel look I have obeyed the Commandments of the Lord see he was so desensitized he couldn't even recognized that he was not obeying the Commandment of the Lord and after the prophet Samuel had to come and after he told him what you're doing what you did was not obeying the Commandment of the Lord and so still told Samuel yes I did see he was so desensitized to the word of God that even when the prophet of God was telling him he could not even see that he wasn't being obedient until the prophet of God God told him again that's when Soul came to himself and he was like oh I see I have sinned and and he tried to plead the prophet of God so the prophet of God can do something interess for him but the prophet of God left because the moment because the word of God is sensitive and the prophet said Samuel was the top of the Holy Spirit the top of the Holy Ghost and the moment Soul deved away from God Samuel backed away because the Holy Spirit cannot be in connection with someone that's that's against the word now in 1960 the unchangeable god brother Brenham says when he pulled back in the cave there come an earthquake outside that shook the cave where he was sitting there come a mighty rushing wind there come Thunders lightning and bows and boeings it was all it was all God but it didn't attract the prophet it didn't touch him somehow he know what God power was he know God has shook the mountains he had he had had rushing winds and so forth he sent fire out of heaven but he waited and way down inside of him come a still little voice that attracted the prophet which was which is the top of the super sense which I fa to say earlier which is like my sub subject for today the super sense that attracted the prophet there was something he'd seen his power to do things but this time he felt his presence and he still and is still small voice speaking into his into his heart then the prophet raised up and went out went out to the end of the cave you see when when um when the Prophet Elijah came to himself and took the time to stay collected to try to resensitize himself to the word that's when God came in and when God saw him that he was calm that was ready to receive the word again God came back it's like brother Brenham said when someone has the Holy Spirit and he SS he SS um he says the holy spirit is like a little Dove that will fly to a branch a far off then it would wait for you to repent when you repent then the holy spirit will come back that's the same thing over here when so when um Elijah had came to himself and was calm and that's when the Holy Spirit came back and started speaking to him again now the prophet says sometimes we ask for things get something vice versa we make God something that we want to make him after the way we think he ought to answer see on this thing where people where the Prophet says that we make him ought to be something he had to answer as in people have this fairy tale imagination of God because they think God is someone that's far off that's beyond our grasp but by the by the preaching of the word we we're learning that that God is somewhere that's near us if we could just be connected with God if we could just be sensitive to God we would find out that God is right next to us that he's not somewhere that's far off people expect God to come down in a mighty way that's why even the um Israelite children have fell to receive God when he came in flesh because they expected God to come down with the whole Kingdom with a bunch of horses and everything and everybody bowing before them with light resonating everything that's why people expect God to come that's how people expect God to come they expect God to come how when the president comes down to Charlotte and there's a bunch of cars coming with him and they block every road that's how God that's how people expect God to come with all these attraction but now when God decides to come in his own manner people fail to detect God people fail to be sensitive and connect to God and that's where people fell at now in 1963 God hiding hiding himself in Simplicity the prophet says not the great glamorous things glamorous things that we think about but it's the simple things that God is so real in simplicity so it pleases God to reveal himself and then hide himself then hide himself and reveal himself in in simple things little things it's it's p over the top of of head the top of the head of man because if if you say why would a just God do do that is because that man was made up in the beginning not to try to shift for himself and man was made to rely completely on upon God that's the reason we're likened onto lamps or sheep a sheep cannot lead himself he has to have a leader and the Holy Spirit is supposed to to lead us so man is made that way see we when we were created in Genesis um when we were created in Genesis 2:7 we we had the five senses which kept us grounded see and we weren't supposed to lead oursel with the five senses because the five senses will bring us to destruction we were supposed to be led by the Holy Spirit we were supposed to be connected with the Holy Spirit in everything that we do we're supposed to be connected with the Holy Spirit now in heing him God says the BR brother bandam says that and God made all of his works so simple that the simple could understanding and God makes himself simple with this simple in order in order to be understood by the simple in other words he says in Isaiah 35 I believe he said though a fool should not error their end it's so simple and we know that God is so great till we expect it to be some great something and we miss the simple thing we stumble over Simplicity that's how we miss God Is by stumbling over Simplicity and God is so simple until Scholars of these days and all days miss him a million miles because in their intellects they know that there is nothing like him so great but in his Revelation he makes it so simple to go plump over the top of a a message see even even people outside in the world they know they know when you when you give them the name God you give them the title God they think God is somewhat somewhat big but because of the way God has revealed himself people start saying well that's not God your God is not true because they don't understand they're not they're not connected with that Revelation they're not connected with that so they can't understand the grasp they they want God to be some fairy tale imagination that's why when you look even in TVs and stuffff that are being projected when they project the image of God usually unless if they're Christian but even people that are Christian still tend to project God as someone that's far off that you can't even come in contact with him that you can't even come and see him and talk to him one to one you see and the prophet says miss him by the way that he reveals himself for he is so great yet hides himself self in Simplicity to make himself known to the least see don't try to get the great because he goes over the top of it but listen to the Simplicity of God and then he finds and then you find God right here in in in the simple way high polished worldly wisdom educated always miss it always misses it but what it is the people has so placed so much upon that still they're even in the Ser seminaries and so forth they are missing the very thing that God has put before them excuse me sorry um now for now High minded high polish worldly wisdom education the reason because when brother BR was talking about this he also managed he didn't say that oh you don't need to go to school to be educated because you still need to go to school to be educated in fact he had some teachers in the meeting with him that were there and brother brandom say I'm not telling y'all um to not be educated or that education is bad but he said that because God had revealed himself in Simplicity you can't just use big words because if you start using big words people of lower standard they're they're not going to comprehend you that mean when you start saying certain things it just going to go fly past them and they won't be able to detect what you're saying and when you start using broken words that are so below they won't be able to understand you either because now they have to try to code what you're trying to say you see now in in um God hiding himself in Simplicity the the then revealing himself in the same paragraph 249 brother BR said the Methodist says when we shout we had it but they didn't the Nazar said when they lived holy they had it but they didn't the Pentecost said we speak in tongues we got it but they didn't see God unfolding himself not in Sensation that that Sensations yet is with it you see the place it gets it so humble till anybody can see can see it if if you don't try to P inject inject your own mind to it see and your own thoughts to it which this remind me of um a story actually brother Brandon had used it was a young man or brother Brian called him an Infidel that love to debate and he was seeing people that were being under the anointing and that he was like those are just Sensations and that there were a young man that was eating um or I believe a young girl was eating an apple as she was walking she wanted to ask that man just one question one separate question and as she came to the man and asked him um they the man asked him what do you want he was like I want to ask you is this apple that I have is it sweet or sour that that he said I I don't know I'd have to taste it after that he said all right that mean you you don't know if it's like because people tend to say it's sensation because there's two extremist there's people that are that act that act too sensitive to the Holy Spirit and there are people that are not sensitive enough and that they be like they'll be like oh when you're doing something they're like that's that's that's nothing Supernatural that's that's that can be explained that's just the five senses that's just emotion you see but you can't say that if you never felt it you can't say that if you were never if you are never sensitive to God you're not you you're not going to understand and know what those people are feeling you'd have to be there to know because brother Brandon was even saying um about I believe it was brother BR was saying about Lucifer he was like Lucifer for him to get to you he'd have to be baptized and he'd have to become a brother he had he'd have to be converted you you see he'd have to be converted and by then he won't touch you anymore meaning those people that are always saying that those are Sensations those are feelings those are emotion because they never felt it because if they would have felt it they weren't going to say that if they would have felt those Sensation that they call sensation if they would have felt the holy spirit in them if they would have been able to detect God in their life they weren't going to say that they weren't going to say that at all now in the super sense brother brandham says and the super sense is the Holy Spirit the faith of God that dwells in you and if you let the five senses be yielded to the six sense it'll guide you and bring out the other five senses under control of that super sense for it's so far above the natural senses as the spiritual man is above the natural it's as far as as high as the heaven is above the natural man and and his five senses it makes you believe things that you cannot see it makes you act where you do not think the five senses would would ever think about it the devil can get into these five senses and lie to you but you cannot touch that super sense that's far beyond his touch that come from God it's called faith faith is that great sense see that super sence the prophet of God said it's faith and that's God that comes from God Only God can detect God you see so you need God in your life to detect God that's why when we see in Adam in Genesis 1:27 Adam when he was a spirit man he was constantly in connection with God cuz he was constantly sensitive to God and he could feel God in all things but but when he had came and he was given the five senses which all Med was in is being introduced through the five senses first when they're being introduced through the five senses they for them to be connected with God they have to come through a new birth they have to come through resensitization that's the only way for them to be connected with God in any form in any shape now the prophet God says in super sense paragraph um 59 he says now in giving this illustration of the senses the natural man is born with these senses so they are natur they are nature given senses and that's really only thing he'll ever know about it in his intellectual thinking he can only think as a man he can see as a man he can understand as a man he can hear as a man but when he comes governed or regenerated or resensitized or we would call it born again then that six that six Super sense takes a hold of him in doing so that super sense raises him up into a spot to where he has Sai to believe things that he that he could not hear things that he could not see understand things that he could not understand he believes it anyhow because he's governed by that success that super sense and how marvelous it is and to think how simple it is to believe see being governed by that super sense it makes you because when when Abraham when Abraham got in contact with that super sense when Abraham got in contact with God he started speaking things into existence that wasn't there he started because the Bible says faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of things unseen see for you to be in contact for you to see the things unseen you need Faith you need that super sense you for you to be sensitive to it you need that super sense and if you remember the title was to be sensitized by to the Spirit by the word in other words to be resensitized to God by God that's the only way for you to be resensitized because you can't be resensitized any other way now brother brand oer says in 19 in 1959 the super he says paragraph 60 now you cannot believe it until you are regenerated the Bible said that no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost we went went through that this last week it's been such a stumbling block especially to the Pentecostal believing people when they hear me say that Jesus said in St John 5:24 he that heareth my word and believe it on on him that sent me has eternal life eternal life come from God alone and no man can say Jesus is Christ only by the holy the Holy Ghost and in this day and age the only way for men to receive the Holy Ghost is by the m of the hour and we already went through that if you're going through the Tabernacle when you're walking through the Tabernacle there's a certain step until you get to before you get to the holiest of holy there's the um the holy place where you have to where the Candlestick are shining the light up the table of the shoe bread we have to eat the word and we found out that in each age a messenger came and gave their word they gave their portion but when their time was over it was time to go to a different state to a different and brother BR said the only way for you receive the holy spirit is through this word no man is going to be raptured unless if they're inside the message because the message is where you find the Holy [Applause] Ghost now brother brandham says it's something about a a man that stays right with the word every time that he sees the word he punctuates it with an amen no matter what the other people say what what was it the six sense catching it the six sense that and the Holy Spirit was standing side by side the Holy Spirit was speaking the six sense was saying amen and there it is something something has to happen and brother Brenham was going around brother Brenham even gave um gave a testimony of a of two girls of two women one she was sick she came to brother Brenham and brother Brenham discerned her thoughts and told her about her issues and she believed and she got healed now there was another woman that came in who had an ulcer and she came into to brother Brenham and she was all happy brother Brandon was like why you brother Brandon was like why you happy but since brother Brandon sens her to the spirit the spirit told him she's happy because she saw her sister get healed meaning when she come in she's under expectation to also get healed you see now when she was T when brother brandham saw that brother BR started sing he said that do you believe you're healed and she said yes I believe she went home confessing that she was believed that she was healed every day she went by saying I am healed I am healed that sixcess in her that six sense in her that said amen to the word of God kept telling her that I am healed I am healed her neighbors would even asking her sister are you still eating normally she said no I'm not she said are you still able to eat she said no I'm not able to eat what I want to but I know that I am healed she kept confessing it until one until one night that aler was just removed she woke up and after that she started she felt hungry so she cooked the little eggs and after that she was like I'mma just eat this then she at it she still felt hungry then she started eating a lot eating eating eating and after she was like I'mma wait for it to come in and you know they all started to come in and kick in but she found out nothing happened and she was completely healed and and later on another man another man had came to brother brandom it was a blind and he had came I believe his name was John John Ryan he had came to brother brandham his people brought him to brother brandham and brother brandham had told him because he heard the stories of how other people got healed their discernment and they got healed now after he came to brother brandham brother brandham told him do you believe that you're healed he said yes I believe that I'm Healed and after that he brother BR said go and you're healed he went now his friends noticed that he wasn't healed Al he kept confessing he was his friend noticed that he wasn't healed so his friend brought him back to brother brandham and after brother brand when brother brand saw him he told Brother brandham I thought you said that I was healed and brother brand responded said I thought you say that you believe see now then he told Brother B yes I do believe then after that he left and he started confessing every day that he believed that six sense started working brother B said cuz he was a Catholic he didn't know how to trigger that six sense so he had to trigger it by confessing it repeatedly he had to confess it repeatedly till that sixcess was trigger da now one time he was um getting a haircut and and and he was getting a haircut as he was getting a haircut the barber was kind of like teasing him saying oh are you healed I thought you were healed I thought you went to that one um preacher over there that always does Miracles and then as as that man was talking he said yes I am healed until his eyes open after he ran out of the barber shop running cuz he was healed Hallelujah now in 1953 seeking after Jesus Jes the brother bam saying Jesus said verily verily I said unto you the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father do for whato whatsoever things the father doeth that he do doeth the son likewise and he he'll show you greater things greater than he greater than this that ye that ye might Marvel the father worketh and I worketh fether watch audience Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever Jesus didn't claim to be a Divine healer he claimed to to be God's son and that's what he was and and said he he could do he could do nothing until the father showed him what to do and the little while the word seees me no more yet you'll see me for for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world now watch the things that I do say Jesus St John 12 St John 14:12 the things that I do shall you also and greater than this for I go to my father is that is that true if ye abide in me and my word in you ask what you may and it will be given that's it either right or wrong it's right you see now if Jesus standing was standing here wearing my suit tonight my shoes he couldn't heal brother BR say he couldn't heal he couldn't heal except he he would stay the same he would do the exact same thing you see if you're sens because based on those testimonies that brother bam gave those people were sensitive to the Holy Spirit and they the holy spirit in them reacted said amen to the Holy Spirit you see now God the brother brother B says God doesn't change he's the same yesterday today and forever that mean the presence of God being here tonight if you're capable of sensing the presence of God and you're able to feel that and connect with that presence of God that mean whatever issue you may have whatever problems you may have in your life all you have to do is just connect with God and touch God and it will come to pass God is not going to heal you unless if you try to connect with him with the Faith with that connection of of the faith amen of the super sense because the super sense was given to bring men in connection with God because the five sense the five senses were incapable of connecting with God but that super sense is the only thing that brings God that brings men to God to connect with to connect with God now this uh I'm Prett some of you may not be able to see it but this thing is like a coding engine you see my I had shared a copy of it with my brother and my brother was like I don't know how you're going to use this for your sermon but anyways this is a coding engine and the coding engine you type a a certain amount of script and when you tap the certain amount of script and you execute the script the commands that are implanted inside the coding engine it will run it now the thing about the coding engine is if there's even one letter that's out of cadence if there's even one letter one space out of order the thing will not execute the program will not run see the holy spirit is only is so sensitive that it cannot run when when that's why when Soul when King Soul had deviated away from God the prophet the prophet of God Samuel because brother BR say Samuel was the top of the Holy Ghost the prophet of God Samuel also had to back away from um Soul because the the the word of God the Holy Spirit cannot deviate just as the coding language even if one letter is out of cadence the word of God will not run the word of God will not stay and res di with you he will not run with that you see but when everything is perfect everything is there after you you execute it you're going to get the command you're going to get the word of God come out you going to get um when you going to get the word of God come out and be so be it you see and the same thing that Believers have to be today because many people if you go out and you're doing certain things people might be like well you're being a bit too extreme you see but the thing is they're not being extreme enough they're not being sensitive they're not sensitive to the spirit that's why they're calling it extreme because there's many times when you do certain things like when you dress a certain way and the people are saying y' people y message believers y' do too much y do too much y the way you're dressed the way you're wear um perfectly and everything y just do too much and Y just want to stay with the word the word the word you're just doing too much and you're being legalistic but in reality it's not that we're being regular it's just that we're sensitive to the spirit of God the word of God came to us and the word of God made us sensitive see the word of God came and made us sensitive to the word of God that we we cannot deviate just as the the Holy Spirit cannot deviate we also cannot deviate outside of the word you see because Jesus Christ has said let this mind be in you as let this Spirit be in you because that spirit of God is inside you you're just going to repeat what God has done you're just going to do what he done and Jesus Christ the holy spirit being so sensitive since he can't dwell in error he can't dwell in a place where it's outside the word of God you see since he can't dwell in that why why are there certain Believers that they find themselves in certain groups that people are not following the word you can clearly see they're not following the word but you find yourself in that in that environment but if you had the holy spirit in you if you were truly sensitized if you truly sensitive to the spirit of God you would not be in those environment you would not be in those circumstances and you would not be doing certain things that you would be doing because the prophet of God came in and he spoke about he spoke about high heels he spoke about how you're supposed to wear he spoke about how men should not wear shirts he spoke about all those spirits that come in with sports and stuff like that people are still posting those people are still being connected with those type of clicks and having debates of those type of manners you see instead of just being connected with God being sensitive to God and letting God rule their lives now in 1960 the rejection of the king the Christian robe is not made up of the church made theology right the Christian robe is made up of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and nothing less than that and the life to follow that baptism of the Holy Ghost makes you live right do right act right and talk right live right that is true you see because people don't know how to act people don't know how to live because they're not connected with God they're not connect they don't have the Holy Spirit they're not sensitive to the word because if we could go to um 1 Samuel chapter chapter one because in first I want to show you how how the Holy Spirit when you have the Holy Spirit how it would make you live right do right and just be right because if you have the Holy Spirit it's supposed to make you sensitive to all spirit because the prophet God himself when he was giving discernment he was sensitive to all Spirit to the point where when he's Discerning he would tell people don't don't talk because the spirit is sensitive because he needs to hear to all he needs to hear all the spirits all around you see and the Holy Spirit when you're sensitive to the word is supposed to make you sensitive in every Department of your life as a father as a mother as a son as a as a friend in all department now in 1 Samuel in 1st Samuel chapter 1 as I was reading this the Bible says now there was a certain man of Rim Zim of ephra and his name was Elan the son of jeram the son of eliu the son of of toou and the son of Z and and ephra and ephra and he had two two wives the the name of one was Hannah and the name of the other was panana and panana had children but panana had no had no children I mean Hannah had no children Hannah had no children and and this and this man went up on went excuse me and this man went up out of his of his City yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord of host in Shilo and the two sons of Eli of fenny and and F fena the priest of the Lord were there and when the time was that Alana offered he gave panana his wife and all his sons and his daughters portions but unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion for he loved Hannah but the Lord has shot her womb and her adversary also provoked her sore for to make her freets because the Lord had shot her womb and as he did so year by year when she went up to the house of the Lord so she provoked her therefore she wept and did not eat now I want you to pay attention then said Alana her husband to her to to her Han Hannah why weepest thou and why eatest thou not and why is thy heart grieved am am not I better to to the then 10 10 Sons so Hannah rose up after they had eaten in in Shiloh and after they had drank now Eli the priest set upon the seat by a post of the Temple of the Lord now in this story of Hannah and Alana if you would notice Hannah was going through some trials were going through some issues and she was mourning she was Grievous but Alana didn't just leave Hanah just Dem um live by herself he didn't just let her be he was sensitive to her accus to the fact that he went and cons consulted her I mean now I don't know what it means like what he meant by a husband's better than 10 uh Sons I'm not a husband so I wouldn't know but he went and conforted and conforted her and after he had been sensitive to her to go and warm her up if you would notice after they had talked Hanah went back to eating you see At first she wasn't eating but then she went back to eating only after Alana went to um talk to her you see now brother brenman had also given um other scenarios where there was a young man that he thought his wife was possessed by demons and he tried praying praying praying and brother Brandon was like what's the issue he was like oh I think my my wife is possessed by demons she doesn't like to do this this this and thir and brother brand was like you know all you could do is just give her a candy and all that would go away right all you have to do is just her and all that would go away go away and brother Bram also gave another knowledge where he was like he would sometime buy candies for his wife or sometime wash the dishes to help her out see brother brandham was sensitive to his wife's cues brother brandham was because when you're when you're a Christian you're supposed to be the best husband to your wife you see when you're a Christian you're supposed to be able to sense those type of connection and brother Brandon was senstive to his wife that he would help out from time to time although other he even said other minister might might make fun of him other minister might laugh at him from time to time but he didn't care because that's his wife and if you were the same thing with God you would try to be sensitive to God and try to please God more you see and there was also another story in particular that brother brandham gave about a late Paul Paul Raider the man every um there was something happening his wife wanted to go somewhere do something and his wife told him and he said no I don't feel like doing that and since he didn't feel like doing that she was hurt she was hurt and she was like she was hurt and she was weeping they say tears came down she was hurt and then he started saying well since since she's hurt let her be Hur see and but every morning she would kiss him and wave goodbye as he went to work now one day because a Christian needs to be sensitive to the spirit and when you're sensitive to the spirit the spirit will make you sensitive to every other Spirit you see now one day as he was walking he was walking to work halfway through the street or whatever he a thought guy had given him a thought he was like What if I go to work and I couldn't make it back to her what if I go to work and on my way back something had happened to her and she could have make it back to me see as he kept walking his heart felt heavy and heavy and heavy until he had her turn around and go back to her and the prophet of God said when he went back to her he didn't even apologize he didn't do anything he just opened the door when he opened the door he saw she was weeping she was crying because he was being ignorant he was being ignorant to her emotions he couldn't he wasn't being sens sensitive to to her emotions but now when she saw when he saw she was weeping what he did was grabbed her and kissed her and when he kissed her he went back out that thing he he went to the game he was like bye-bye and she was like bye-bye and the prophet said this time it was better this time he had a feeling into way it had emotion into it you see when you're when you're a Christian a Christian of God when you're when you're a child of God and you're connected with the Holy Spirit and you're sensitive to the spirit the holy spirit will make you sensitive to your neighbors it will make you sensitive to your brothers your fathers you will teach you how to be a better son it will teach you how to be a better wife a better husband [Applause] and and the spirit and brother Bram says and brother BR says and the first time that the church L their leaders take over the the lead take over to lead the people the Holy Spirit gets right away from them and very first the very first time that you go being led by Men by amen instead of God the holy spirit will get away from you will get away from you too let the Holy Spirit lead that's what we need is leadership and God gave us a leader and we don't hear it you see that's what we need in this time we need in this age that's what we need in this age is to be led by the Holy Spirit to be reconnected by the Holy Spirit reconnected to God you see we need to be Rec reconnected with God we need to we we need to be resensitized with God and let God just lead us in all things now brother BR has said and how that Elijah stood there bold with thus sayth the Lord oh God give us men like that he wasn't afraid to tell Jezebel about her condition he wasn't scared of Ahab he wasn't afraid that that he was mistaken he stood with boldness and walked up to Ahab and said not even do will fall till I call for it amen you see he didn't care what anybody else said he didn't care what anybody else's criticism was but he stayed with God and the prophet of God said he he prayed to God saying that give us men like that give us men that would stay with the word that would preach the word and not deviate away from the word that will preach the word and keep the word as pure as it is you see and brother br says what was what was he a sign to that sinful generation did Israel see it no they laugh at him made made fun of him he predicted that there would be a drought that there would be there would be trouble hunger starvation and prophesied boldly standing by himself with th say the Lord said Lord they killed all the TR of they've killed them all off I'm the only one is left that's standing with your word what was the trouble about the word of God Elijah wanted to stay with the word he was a real Prophet see the word the problem here wasn't oh Elijah what Elijah was doing or anything that the problem is people had issue with the word you see people could not be sensitive to the word and whenever the word came they felt like it hurt them so they just backed away they they couldn't connect with God they couldn't sensitize with God they they were under spiritual Amnesia kind of like this La Dean churches you see in this age the um the Bible says that they're blind and they're naked you see the Blind and the naked they can't they can't really see and they're the only church between the church ages that's that started by responding back to God they're acting like if they know and if you remember earlier brother Brandon was talking about how we get so lost people nowaday they get so lost in their intellect they get so lost in their way of thinking that they want God to be some big thing and when he's not this big thing they go elsewhere see even the Israelites in their time they have failed many times whenever Israel was supposed to be sensitive to God but every single time they look at God and after they look what other people have they're like we want to be like them we want to be like them instead of being sensitive to God what God is giv them they want to be like all the thing they expect they're they want a fairy tale type of God in their life you see they wanted they wanted an imaginary God that they can that they think that can that's beyond their connection that's beyond them that's not there with them they were afraid of the word because the word came to job they were afraid of that they were afraid of God because the word of God is God now in 1954 do you know do you now believe brother Brenham says in paragraph 16 he says and one day I'll try to close you know to Wednesday night and one day there was a man came up to him he knew his name he said your name is Simon but you will be called Peter from henceforth a woman one time pressed through the crowd touched His Garment went her way back out into the crowd but Jesus had a way of knowing he looked around and saw the woman then had the blood that had the blood blood issue thy faith has saved thee that's what he did he found out the that he found out that the Father revealed to him what he wanted him to do he submitted himself himself to the father listed not to the world but he done only as the father showed him these things Jesus did then as Jesus Jesus then as Jesus of ad33 the Jesus of 1954 does the same thing for he is the resurrected one he believes he raised from the dead you believe he raised from the dead he lives tonight he isn't dead he's living right here among us tonight well then if he is the same yesterday today and forever he has the hands of the church for his his eyes the eyes of the church for his and he operates through the church to prove his resurrection you see if Jes because brother brandham has had took Jesus from the 33 and after he tapped it to the 1954 and now now I want to take that Jes from 1954 and put it in 2024 you see if Jesus Christ is the same today as he was back then in brother Bam's time as he was in his own time that mean tonight and in this instance whenever when you feel that presence of God just heal yourself to that presence of God just if you had deviated away from it just reconnect yourself with that presence of God reconnecting yourself with that presence of God because God does not change the Bible says that God does not change God is Not greater or less than his word God does not change his word is absolute his word does not return to any void and if God is the same and you have that mind of God in you you have that holy spirit of God in you that mean tonight if you're sick if you feel some type of if you still some type of way you have some type of sensation that's that's holding you back that's being a stumbling block for you just pray to God just touch God and connect with God the prophet of God has said also in the fundamental he said if I come in his name and he recognize his name and Jesus said whatever you ask the father in my name that I do and then I go to the father in Jesus name it isn't me praying anymore it's Jesus it's his spirit praying through me you see and then I've got to receive what I asked for for he he said it and it's God's Own word it can't it can't do nothing else but produce just what it was you see and and led by the spirit of 1950 brother Brenham says but the greatest thing I have found in Christians life is letting the Holy Spirit lead you and guide you and his work is marvelous how many how many in here he has ever been led by the spirit let's see your hand oh my what's wonderful led by the spirit of God there's no there's no there's no one would lead you to the altar but the spirit of God there's no one would bring you here tonight lest it was the spirit of God is that right he moves in mysterious ways he's want he his wonders to perform many times many times in the Le in the leading since I was a little boy Sunday a week I if we get to stay that long I wish to tell my my life story Sunday a week and the afternoon service to let you know just what what tears and blood has been along the road someone might think it's all all roses but that isn't so friend now many times the only time that I can ever be able to say anything to people about their diseases and so forth is when being definitely led by the spirit I have to let him do it if I would say something with myself within myself it would certainly be a mistake many times it confuses me when there's so many the best way when the best way when I have the patient to myself individually taking talking to them to contact them personally when it's sometimes when it's it's a mixed audience like this it's kind of hard to feel just what it is and and to know what it what it is but you have to you have to be very sensitive to the spirit now we realize and everyone knows there is a there is Spirits then if there is Spirits there is bound to be a master of that spirit because it changes the nature of Sinners into Christians and there's bound to be a master or head there somewhere and that's God and he sent his son on earth made in likeness of sinful flesh and he died that we might be redeemed and brought back to God to to be Sons and Daughters of God to walk with him again that Missing Link from Garden of Eden that Adam lost Christ restored again see through Jesus Christ God has resensitized us back to himself and through the message of the hour God has brought us even closer to to himself so it's so it behooves us to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit and just hurting to him and just be in connection with him because if you're in connection with him you would be heal in all your diseases and if you're if you're fail if you're facing a trial and you know the holy spirit is there you know the holy spirit is already in the message you know God already Vindicated the message you know God already Vindicated to the pill of fire and to the to the clouds you already know that now since God is the same thing and you already know that the holy spirit is inside the message all you have to do is just be sensitive to God Al the AL the symptoms may still be there Al the symptoms may still appear in the surface just keep confessing as that lady kept confessing just kept confessing as that as that old man kept confessing and the Holy Spirit would do his thing now if the M if the musician could come forward just just keep just keep being just keep being with the word just keep being residing the word feeding on the word the more the more you dwell in the word the more sensitive you become with the word because even Moses when he went up in the mountain when he went up in the mountain he was feeding on the word when he came down his face was resonating and even his emotions were Godly emotion because when he saw Israel sinning he automatically got angry and toss it that wasn't just a human anger that was a Godly anger because he saw the deviate away from the word so just be sensitive with the word the more you resign with the word the more you'll become like like Moses you you'll be able to sense what God sense you'll be able to feel what God feels the more you reside with the word the more sensitive you become as Enoch was till he even until he until he even translated because he was so sensitive to God so he became like God because he was feeding on the word until he translated the more you feed on the word the more sensitive you become to the word the more you become like God as the word has been preached now if we could go in prayer let us bow our heart
