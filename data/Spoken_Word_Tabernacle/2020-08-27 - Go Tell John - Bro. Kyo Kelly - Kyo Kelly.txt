is so that we would know jesus the reason he said elijah and so we would know jesus the reason why the reason that we'll be married to him is because we should know jesus how did you lord i don't pray you see this tonight saying hallelujah there's no one like jesus tonight how do you deal with god the bible says see he said there would be an invisible you and he said before we get there it must take place first healing and so that you may know him and the power of his hallelujah lord god that you see my brother to know him his life tonight hallelujah i just i just said i just greet your name on jesus christ i said lord i said i said lord just please leave me i just wanted to share some testimonies with the saints amen and just say lord it's good to have fellowship this is to have fellowship with him amen so before we do so i just want to read a little bit of the word to you amen so as you're standing amen let's just turn over to to uh let's just say matthew matthew 11. and um and matter of fact uh let's kind of jump around a little bit matter of fact let's first let's turn to revelations i'll read this and then we'll jump back to matthew when i say lord let's say which scripture i just want to read to you before i just let you have your seats 12 and 11 and then we'll jump back amen to matthew so just look at this here amen tonight and the bible said i started verse 10. it said and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ why for the accuser of our brother is cast down and so now when satan is cast down now you can get victory you see now he said i heard a brother sing a song and say hallelujah anyhow he said he don't belong to your right he don't belong to your left satan don't belong in front of you but he belongs under your feet so here he's telling us the accuser has been cast down now tonight it's already a finished work and he says which accused them before our god day and night so he's always got an accusation for you just think about this but in the bible in verse 11 and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony each and every person's own testimony and he said and they love not their lives unto death can you say amen amen let's just turn back to matthew 11. amen in matthew 11 it says uh i'll just i'll just drop down to verse 4 and it says and jesus answered and said unto them go and show john again those things which ye do hear and see let us pray oh lord gracious heavenly father lord anyone can turn the pages of this book lord god but heavenly father it takes you lord the author to come lord and break the bread of eternal life to our hearts lord lord with nothing here tonight lord but we just have need that you pass by this way lord you know the needs heavenly father of your children lord you know heavenly father lord their ups their downs with all they have need of and lord even tonight lord we ask you the heavenly father come and speak to our hearts for your glory in jesus christ's name lord we say amen amen yes lord amen you know as you just have your seats tonight we just greet your name of jesus christ you know i'm a i'm from columbia south carolina my parents moved further north and i guess i moved further west so i don't know maybe some god will bring us we meet in the middle somewhere you know but but now we live in alabama and to come down and i was thinking i had a chance to it was maybe almost a month ago um my mother-in-law had been diagnosed with kovid she's an assistant living she's like maybe 75 or something so she had dementia at all times just struck her early so we were going to go down there and we said well laura how can we do this so we um but by the time we got here we couldn't go there so we came to my parents and i got a chance to come visit and i said uh lord i said now um all the wonderful ministers and i said boy awesome i said my so i said lord what can i say amen with such astounding teaching and preaching that you all have been hearing i said lord i said maybe i just share you know a testimony to encourage your faith tonight amen and i say you know from my heart um you know brother branham he said teaching establishes the people and you say it's a lot of things that you know you you grow and as you as you said you might you hear the gospel preach and it's the net that's cast out and brings all kind of stuff in but then now along your way you need to be settled and god gives you a way to sell you and i say lord i say so may he do that this amen and continue to do that amongst you all to see amen and i say um so i i say i mean to start to tell you i just i just want to share um if we'll come back to this i want to share something brother brandon uh he read i was going to read let me see here i have it it was on i think victory day and i want you to realize you know in this journey there are many ups and downs and god allows it brother carl loves us he say brother i will serve him even if there's no reward you know amen hallelujah see him amen um and he said this he says uh brother brown he said this this is victory day and he says god lets disappointments happen to show victory now you know you don't really know how to win until you've taken a loss before the law stings when you take a loss nobody takes likes to take a loss and you see in my current job you know i so i trade energy right and every day we get graded on did you make money or lose money that's all we care about we want to see green and we don't want to see a loss right and so i was thinking i said now he said but god allows you to suffer losses along the way because he wants to show his might he wants to show his strength he wants to show what victory really is and he says oh if we could only see that he said if we could see that he said you see you only see that these things that seem to be burying you that seem to be upsetting you along this way he said they're only trials now a trial is something you go through but the trial is not the judgment you see going to the prison there's many people that are locked up they've already been to court they already know they're sentenced they know they're fine so now they're serving time and i want you to know you see when i went to the prison started in alabama it's like it changed the bible looks a little different to me because you see when jesus said he said no man would make it none of us would make it as much as you say you love god none of us would make it unless jesus shortened the time now look at this now my brother so you are what you are by grace and you are saved by grace what he said now we love him and his faith operating by love in this hour that's bringing us unto him and jesus had to shorten the time so you see everybody that's sitting in prison they're doing different bids they're doing different amount of time and some guys that say i've been there 22 years i got 10 more to go he said one guy said i've been there five years i can't barely make it but he says you have to learn how to do your time you have to learn how to go through the trials and he says now remember it's only he said don't count these trials that you go through as nothing but he told us it says count him he said more precious than gold that's been tried by a fire you see i remember when i was at brother tony's we was in atlanta so i was living there for many years and you know we have people there from the congo and from cultivoir and ivory coast and ghana and we would enjoy food and pepper soup and oh rice jello off all kinds of great dishes and fellowship but the one thing you know you would see is that you know it's something to see that people are going through different trials someone have husbands or wives that are overseas they're waiting on the lottery they're in prayer they're bringing the kids to church you know they're waiting they're waiting on god to make a move they're going through trials oh i pray you see me and so when somebody now would come and join the fellowship my brother oh it would be a good time because you would see that god had moved over those prayers at night he had moved over the family he had brought joy into the whole opera he brought joy why because he said this is now nothing that we're going through is not eternal it's only temple it's holy temple so god remember he likes to sit back sometimes and see what you will do in the midst of your child he wants to see what you would do remember god he told by the burden he said that you're sitting there and he went to go pray for a little boy little ricky and he said he said he went in there and he saw his tongue was sticking out and how he had they had to put a hole because it was cancer in the mouth and he was sitting there and he said lord he said god you mean to tell me that you get joy out of seeing this he said then the lord spoke to him and he said i've given the power to the church he said now i want to see what you're doing [Applause] he said i want to see what you do with what i've given you in the midst of your trial [Applause] hallelujah you see some people lose hope in the midst of their child some people lose joy in the midst of their child somebody will lose their faith in the midst of the trial and it shows because you can't stop praising god just because you're going through a trial hallelujah hallelujah you see it shows do you really believe my brother it shows if you believe if your bridegroom has come and spoke to you it shows that you believe that he told you that he's going to be there it shows that you believe that he said he's going to come and pick you up so it's time to get your dress ready it's time to get your hair back it's time to fix your tie because the bride guru is coming my brother hallelujah hallelujah i pray you see my brother hallelujah is what he said he said these things he said what you should do is stand still he said just stand and focus your glasses on the word of god hallelujah lord god focus your glasses because it's easy sometimes will stop getting your eye it's hard you forget where you're going but remember the gps is guiding you the gps is guiding you he's comforting you he's keeping you he's leading you and guiding you into all truth hallelujah and when it comes it brings rejoicing my brother it brings joystick you see we first started the church was in atlanta it was a little church and it was maybe this big and i was playing the drums and the drum is right next to the bathroom door and you had to walk around the preacher and the drum just to get to the bathroom man this is nice tonight this is real they say that was country this is nice this is real nice you see so you see here this is something there was no air conditioning my brother it was a fan the preacher was yelling out with a fan but god something said go there go there i said i'm thinking okay and i've seen god hallelujah i've seen god begin to move i say with brother samuel tanking and brother jim and miche and all the brothers would come to but the team different all these people look hear me they would come and god was moving and blessing the people as we saw the boat get pushed out the warehouse and we saw the people begin to pray and people god was saying black people and african and chinese hallelujah spanish what was it it was god doing a work in the city of atlanta now i want to tell you something when you see that you say lord what are you doing one night we're sitting there praying for the air conditioner and brother james he came by and god had touched me praying said lord then we need about three thousand dollars for the air conditioning and god came by he touched brother thank you anybody nobody james but the parents brother he touched them to sow a seed and i said lord why would you have this man drive all the way from over town and he said just to plant a seed but he wasn't in prayer that night he wasn't there with the other brothers and all whoever wanted to come sisters included he wasn't there when we were praying saying lord we have a need and when you see god move over the knee it gives you faith to know that through the child god is still what he still cares about his people hallelujah my brother they said man what kyle you know why are you here i said lord i'm just being led by god and you learn how to pray you learn how to fast you know god shout he takes you to something so you can learn something hallelujah to learn because you don't know what's ahead and look what he said i just kind of keep reading when you focus your glasses on the word when you go to the optometrist right all they're trying to do is get corrected what you already have they can't put light in your body right they can't do anything if you get lasik they can change the lens they can change the contour of your eye but what they cannot do is make you see [Applause] so when god shines the light with you on the word and he gives you the glasses the eye sounds they'll point to your eyes to be able to see in this hour what god is doing do you see how blessed you are even though the glasses got a little foggy they just got a little foggy and that happens along the way i just call hallelujahs keep reading so what he said is speak the word and then just walk forward that's all you have to do speak the word and walk forward in it believe in him who sent you who called you who's keeping you believing and then he said he said we get to a time we say god i don't know what to do i'm up against it speak the word lord i believe just start walking forward god does the opening up of the sea you just keep walking you see it's something you know when i was i was thinking about this this evening down in the prison it's such a dark environment and the person that come to my heart look at john the baptist now we know by the birth of john you could say naturally he was a cousin of jesus born of six months apart you know and and we know john the bible says that john wasn't just anybody john was a man sent from god he was born by sex but sent from god and john had a miraculous ministry john the bible said thank you my brother the bible tells us that john was to come in malachi 3 it tells us that he was the messenger that he said behold i said before what my face so he was come to prepare the way of jesus christ and he came in the power of spirit of elijah and he did everything and guess what the people missed him because he did no miracles because he didn't i said oh hold on how could this be if he was elijah if he had the same spirit that he's supposed to be doing miracles but what could be greater than john the baptist as he took all the rebuke from zacharias and understanding that his father was a priest but god took him on the back side of the desert and wanted to use john as what to show that now i'm not going to bring you up to a denomination i'm going to have you on the backside to call you out because i want to use you in a special way to bring what to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children i gotta bring them back i gotta deal with some of those religious demons hallelujah i gotta get them to start seeing how they went and got my people to go in the era so you see they came out everybody was getting baptized they rolling around in the dirt dirt in their ears dirty water in their nose and they say oh we're getting baptized in dirty joy i'm repenting and god loves me he said why did god sit into that almost nastiest little little place brother brown remember he said he said sometimes this is that little mission corner that you drive by and you say ain't nobody no hotel serving god we're just going to keep driving he said that's a little place where god is right there he said i went into that little place he said it was a it's a church that used to be a saloon and he said i remember in that old donkey he said an eagle at that he said he came into my face and he said sir have you received the holy ghost since you believe and he said i looked at that colored black man i looked his head huh i didn't and he said even with my friends didn't want to go he said i knew what they had is what i needed i knew that's what i that's what i needed oh i pray you hear me tonight brother go tell john go tell you you see as great as his ministry was he introduced the messiah you know the story he's standing there on the banks john didn't know who he was he said there's one among you but he said but one day he said with the spirit of god he showed me he had to who you see the spirit of god descend and remain he said that is him so it's not enough for you just to get the holy ghost and start your journey but the holy ghost when it falls on you it must remain it must remain you know hallelujah greed not the holy ghost whereby you've been sealed to the day of redemption so you see don't grieve it don't grieve it but remember he wants to abide and remain hallelujah so he begins walking and i want you to see one day he looks up he didn't know but he saw him and he said behold the lamb of god who come to take away all the sins of the world now maybe everybody couldn't see but you see the bible doesn't say the spirit like a dove it says the bible said the spirit of god like adult it wasn't anything but god himself coming down on the prophet hallelujah that's why brother burnham he could say he said he wasn't one he said this was your whole pain as a baby this was him growing up pomona but he said he wasn't what anointed until he came and got baptized [Applause] he's hallelujah that's every believer must come to money joy every believer and when he said the spirit of god descended like a dog as he told that's how oh i pray not not the third person not the second person not the first or maybe two and a half it was god himself and it's so like a dog the lamb and the dove coming one and as he's there in the water now the bible says then straightway and being full of the holy ghost now the holy ghost leads him into the wilderness john shaw all of that he said i must decrease so he can increase he can increase he said i'm not that light i'm just here to testify of that life so here's john he goes on he you say man john is mighty he had people following him he had a wonderful ministry but everybody couldn't go on with jesus some were blinded by john they were blinded by the lesser light some of you have been blinded because they got stuck on brother branham but they can't see the revelation of who brother browning was introducing you to [Applause] they get stuck on the man it's always been that way it's always been that way so it's not new but what we can see a bride is only she cares about seeing her husband i pray you see esther she listen to hey yeah she angry i told her what to wear she had a choice she could wear anything she wanted but for some reason it was something predestinated in esther to say i'm only going to do what i'm only going to put on what the king's chamberlain told me to wear [Music] i pray you see so she had to make a choice she could go into the house of just gas she could be like all the other concubines or she could have fellowship with her lord for some reason she took him at his word she took him at his word if all the king's life is this a little long hair if long he wants me to get out of them high heels that's fine if he wants me to take up all this makeup that's fine if i don't need no bling or no blouse to please him that's fine but if what you say just please the king i'll take you at your word i pray you see my brother i pray so that's what she did she took him at his word and i pray tonight you and i have to do the same thing you and i have to do the same thing [Applause] you see along the journey sometimes you will get weak sometimes you'll go through ups and downs and i'll think about as john his ministry decreased we know that a woman rises up she had a spirit like jezebel alona and she wanted she had her her daughter danced before the king and you can imagine it's probably some kind of provocative type of dance and when she did the king was so moved he said he said assistant i'll give you up to half of my kingdom tell me what you want and she runs back to her mother oh we don't have time but she runs back to her mother and her mother said ask for one thing the head of john the baptist that's all that's all just bring it to me on a platter get a charge and just bring it to me all i want to see is head and you see here she knew now the person that was bringing rebuke it was god because of what she was doing and the king he said you can't it's unlawful for you to marry her he was telling he said look i'm i hate that guy that same spirit of jezebel i hate that guy i hate him i can't stand him so bring me what the head of him on the planet and that's what happened john didn't know that when he started out he didn't know that when he was in prison he had a feeling that it'd be maybe this will happen and that but he didn't know that oh thank you brother so what happened before all of that john was in prison and he got weak one day and he got so weak can you imagine there wasn't no electricity there wasn't no tv there wasn't no concession there wasn't somebody putting money on the books there wasn't no we're gonna give you this parole day it wasn't none of that give him the blood the brain of affliction don't even talk to him that's not that's i say so john was in prison suffering and as he was there maybe some two disciples would come around every now and then say john how you doing john sometime in your life god made sense just somebody give you a little encouragement how you doing bro sister is everything going okay we still believe god with you [Laughter] we still believe god with you we we can see god is still with you but this one day it says john was so low he said james james i got a question for you whatever you need me he said whatever you need what he said just didn't say let's just ask him he said ask him so john he says peter james i'm just i got this question go ask him and you know who him is go ask him is he the one or shouldn't we look for now [Music] oh how could you how could he ask this question you know brother bram said he was honest [Applause] he said he was honest he just wanted to know he said sometimes down in the valley remember the eagle gets scales over his eye [Music] he's still an eagle but he got scales time and he's sitting there he got a little weak he said just go ask him is he the one or should we look for somebody else now notice john didn't say ask him he's my cousin tell him to come get me out of jail [Music] tell him to bust his face down no he didn't need that he's he didn't mind being in his situation he knew that all things worked together for the good for them that loved the lord and there's no way that he was there in prison unless god allowed it so he never asked him to bust him out of jail but he said just reveal to me are you the one all he wanted to know was are you the one you see along this christian journey you will have to know you're going to come to a place is he the one did brother branham introduce you to him is he the one there are many other jesuses jesus different denominations but have you been introduced to him [Music] ask him how do you ask him and he says he's sitting here and now he says go ask him they said okay john we're going to do this for you we know in your situation we know how tough it is just hold right there maybe take home let's go ask jesus we got a question for jesus let's see what jesus said about this let's go to the word let's see what the word says let's see it doesn't answer in the word because john we know he's a prophet and he always point us to nothing but the word let's go ask jesus so he comes and he gets there brother and he said jesus we got a problem with y'all john's got a question for you john just want to know something he's down to prison and he ain't blaming you for not coming to see him he don't need you to put no money on the book he said you could just stay where you at he said you ain't gotta do nothing for ah elizabeth you ain't gotta do enough for uncles that say zacchaeus you don't gotta do nothing for uncle zachariah you ain't gonna do nothing like that all i wanna know he just wants to know are you the one so jesus i got can i just read to you matthew 11. i gotta just read it jesus says he says now look go and show going to get go and show john again those things which she do here and see he didn't give john just a book he didn't give him just a seven seals he didn't give him just a church change he didn't give him just a letter he said i want you to go tell john about the manifestation of god in your day hallelujah i want you to go tell john about the manifestation of god in your day i want you to go tell john about the manifestation of god in your day that's what i want you to go tell them he said what you hear and what you see my brother hallelujah what good would a historical god do you a historical god will do you no good but shooting a god a present help in a time of trouble that's what you need that's what he introduced to us and he says this he said hallelujah he says the john the blind receive this he says john go tell the lame the ones that couldn't walk now they can walk he said he said now look the lepers are cleansed you mean leprosy my brother no more knots no more phalanges or your fingers falling off no they're healed okay you got that write that down brother make sure you don't forget tell cause we gotta make sure we tell john august so he says he says and he said the death they hear he said go tell us people that can't hear nothing now they can hear just go tell him you got that he said okay i got that one too he said the dead hold on hold on oh the dead you mean the damn people damn in their trespasses and in their sins that they don't have life they hardly find it hard to clap in church you mean the people that don't want to go to church the people that are struggling you mean the people that ain't been quick and dead yeah them people tell them the ones that are dead are now made alive again they're allowed again my brother they're rejoicing now they are so hallelujah go tell john go tell john hallelujah and he said here and he said now and the poor of all things the poor have the gospel preached unto you everybody's hearing the word of god everything is moving by the power of god it says the poor and the bible says and blessing is he whosoever shall not be offended in me tell them go tell john man and the bible said as they departed jesus began to say to the multitude jesus began to ask them what did you go out in the wilderness to see what did you go out to see do y'all really know who john was so jesus is dealing with the people that are not locked up he's dealing with those people on the outside who want to hear the truth everybody didn't want to hear jesus maybe he's 31 32 at this time and they may not want to hear everything this 31 32 year old guy that the city that in the synagogue the pharisees saggies have not approved of they don't want to hear everything he got to say because they say he believes that william branham he believes that john the baptist ministry stuff he how can he believe all of that he said you know has he i mean he didn't do no what miracles did he do you say did he really fulfill all the scripture he said no well you know what let's talk about his prophecy he said he was going to introduce the messiah you believe he the messiah but jesus is there standing through the midst of the trial he's staying to the midst of the trial meanwhile the disciples are running back of john to go give the news now look they were supposed to listen to jesus but john still need to hear a word from god as john is still in his trial as john is still in his hold the bible tells us that all they did was depart but you know if no one stopped those brothers they went straight to the prison and they went straight to go tell john let me tell you what jesus said let me tell you what jesus said and they could say hold on right there the dead are raised john [Applause] the lepers you got the lepers are cleansed john john hold on for a second john i got so many pages here john there's so many people to report let me tell you he said now the blind eyes are open john john the poor have the gospel priesthood hold on the poor john said the poor by this time john is standing up in his prison can you tell me some more [Applause] can you tell me some more do you got anything more is there anything more that you can tell me about him hallelujah hallelujah it didn't matter then it didn't matter about the child it didn't matter about the up on that down all that mattered is now he knew his lord now he knew that he was blessed because jesus said the last thing he said blessed is he who is not offended in me oh thank hallelujah hallelujah now you see why god wants your praise do you see why god wants your life you see why god wants you because the bible said let the redeemed of the lord say so let them say so you see going down to the prison i shared a testimony once i shared again when i first went down there you see i was told i was asked to go by a gentleman at my job and it was a white brother and he said to me dirk he said kyle you ever done prison ministry i said no brother i said but i'm sat in a prison with my dad before when i was young and i said man where's the broadway road maximum security prison and we go sit down you go through the door and boom and boom now remember just all i remember is sitting next i remember one thing stood out to me i was sitting next to a tall old white gentleman and he sat down sitting next to him he looked down and he said son you'll never want to be here you'll never want to be here and i said i just remember that all my life seeing friends my dad know people that come over the house different ones been shot and killed over the years and and and we have heard the truth heard the word and i said i remember that all my life he said son you don't want to be here and i told him i said the guy at work i said well i'll go with you he said where you supposed to go he said well i'm supposed to go to birmingham alabama and i was living in atlanta then i said uh so he wasn't going for a weekend he said yeah go for a weekend we're going to talk to him about the lord and then we're just going to come back i said okay so time went on it wouldn't have happened uh my job moved me to alabama and i said lord i said how did i get in alabama and the house that we chose where we ended up being it was an hour to the church and an hour to the prison i didn't know this and here we are and the day comes up to go and i said i'm for something i kept that little thing that goes on it was a local church to go to and get the orientation of it so i said okay i went and i was thinking should i go low should i go and so i'm just like i go so i went that night and they had like in the basement this bill glass foundation they said we're gonna save souls for jesus and they had the motorcycles on there and guys had the ponytails and they were smoking the cigarettes in the parking lot and said we're going to be saving some souls for jesus and the guy had the bikers hitting the bikes and this and had on the leather and everything like man what in the world is this and we had the church and the guy's in the basement he said man go ahead and get you some spaghetti and garlic bread he said he said man we're gonna do a little james brown for jesus so ain't no they been doing look james brown said what is this a baptist church i was like lord maybe i i ain't supposed to mess with this stuff so i go home and next morning i was supposed to leave the next morning so i'm like lord i go go and i didn't hear a voice someone just my heart this feeling go okay so i get up here about six in the morning i go down there about an hour from where was it so i go down there have my bible this bible first thing i said oh no you can't take that bible in that bible was too big you know we walk up to somebody going to be scared when you come with a bible that big brother where'd you get that from you know what i said okay so i had a little they gave me a manila envelope and on it had a guy with a sleeve and tattooed all the way up here and it had some scriptures which you could read to somebody to get them converted get a decision and then now you read it and then in there i said that thing i said why would they make something like that and then in it i said well you know i had a something my bible was a the statue of a perfect man i said well lord man if i come in here i can just give it to somebody you know get graces i can give to somebody by going there was going around just sharing sharing the word the first guy came to sitting there talking and uh and i know how big the guy was he was sitting down on his bump and they closed the door boom you know you're in maybe about this big you're in a place and i'm just telling about the lord and he said he said you say you're from south carolina he's kind of quiet he stood up he was probably six foot five you know two fifty oh lord that's a big bro you know hey i said it's a big brother and he's and he reached on his bed and he grabbed the cot and he grabbed some pictures and he said when you save south carolina he said my mother died while i was locked up and he said because she's out of state they wouldn't let me go and i want to show you the pictures i said this is something and so he said i you know like i i sure i wasn't getting all the but i saw him after the years went on he kept coming to hear the word and he got transferred and he's a real nice brother but real soft spoken but big so i'm saying well lord maybe you want me just to keep going around sharing the word so we did that day and the last two guys i met was in the prison yard and it was standing around about six guys and they said well let's just um as we finish uh something came in my heart to just start telling them about that message brother brian preach a prisoner i tell them how all of us have to be prisoners you're a prisoner to somebody or you're somebody's fool and i was telling as he said as a prisoner they tell you when to wake up they tell you when to go to sleep they tell you what to eat they tell you what to do and you give up all your rights you have to do what somebody tells you to and i want you to see here i know you guys know what it's like to be inmates but i'm a prisoner too and i remember this guy he starts crying and he asks brother he was spam he said let's can we pray and we started singing amazing grace and we sung amazing grace we began to pray and you just feel like it's just a sweet spirit we're in the middle of prison y'all or something and so then we left the group we walked across maybe about 50 yards across the prison yard and i remember as a black guy white guy standing by the basketball court and i began telling him about the lord and the guy wasn't saying nothing to me he was really slow he was just kind of listening and i asked him i said i'm gonna ask you to say yo you seem like you just um you ain't saying much he said but kyle i'm just listening to you he said he said i was wondering kind of how old you were and he just kind of said i was wondering you know well what you believe and he said i want to tell you you said i believe acts 2 38. i said i said brother i talked to a couple of people today and i i heard nobody quote that scripture to me acts 2 3 i said yes brother i believe that he said i believe you got to be you got to repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of hope i said brother i believe that he said he said i want to tell you he said these preachers they come in here they tell you all you got to do is believe with your heart confess with your mouth that you love god and this and i just believe there's more to that i said brother it it is more that's all you need to do but there is some more and he says to me he says you know he said i'll tell you this he said bro kyle he said these preachers that come in here they they don't say what william branham said i said brother i said he said william brown so i open up the little brown manila envelope and i pull out the little book i said brother do you mean this guy right here and the white boy said yay man yay that's the guy he said i've been telling this guy for weeks that this guy preached nothing but the truth oh hallelujah hallelujah i said what that's all i won't forget i'm in a prison brother i said why brother he said yeah i said brother do you want this book he said oh nobody said we got the seven church ages we got the seven seals he said no that's fine we can hold it we can get it i said what the hell is that i said lord isn't this something and i told him you don't want to touch me i said now isn't it something he said he said but kyle he said okay he said god sent you here just to confirm that this is nothing but the truth and he said i said can we pray for you that god bless you and be with you i said brother let's pray hallelujah i can say hallelujah my brother and you say what well kaizen why you tell us that because you see it was i didn't go there with that in my heart but you see along the way god just shows you he drops a little handful of barley in your field just to show you that he's with you just to show you that he's walking with you and i can tell you you see driving the highway has been like i leave work i go there after work it takes about an hour to get there and i was saying things my brother i remember we were talking about how baptism is in the name of jesus christ and one of the brothers he was just so moved by they had a baptism and i couldn't they had it early and i didn't get off in time to be there and the chaplain there he said i'm church of god he said he said my faith he told me i think my dad one time talked to him he came down and visit he said my faith will not allow me to baptize the name of jesus christ and two of the brothers have been coming he said they were gone they had a baptism and everybody was getting baptized the father son of holy ghost filed some holy ghost and the brother told me he said brother god i just walked up to him i asked him i said will you baptize me in the name of jesus christ and he said come on brother i'm baptized and he told me later to the pastor the chaplain he said he's the pastor of a church he said that for some strange reason that morning he said just a a peace came upon that i could baptize in the name of jesus christ and you know i said you know lord he said god will give you and do exceedingly and abundantly above all you can ask or even think according to your faith according to your faith and they said the brother said of all people that got baptized they were the only two god that that got baptized by a man that said he wouldn't even do it in the name of jesus christ and i say i said lord this is something it's something to see that god still has children anyway we had a brother that got out of that got out of prison and basically i had asked a pastor but at home i asked him he baptized him and he said he would and this and he got sick and that suddenly he wasn't there and he said brother kyle you can baptize me and what happened the guy he it was a drug thing he ended up going to prison and so now it was like march or something it was a sunny morning it was so cold i knew it was icing that box out back and not only did he come he said he said macau i got out and i started going to my home church and he said i asked him would you baptize me in the name of jesus christ and he said he said they said we couldn't do and he said someone just i should call you and see if i can come down i said well come on brother talk to the pastor we can come on see and get you baptized so then the sunday morning he was sick and this and say well come on not only did he come he said his wife came his eleven-year-old daughter came and he said they got through that got in that water and let me tell you they're gonna shake you i said oh lord they were shaking and i said lord isn't this something that if god touches someone's heart if he touches your heart do you realize what god will do for you if you only believe if you only believe i wish i had time to go through all the testimony but what touched me in it is that it was a brother he's a brother in there you would think look at him real dark guy gold teeth he was sad he was there and he said how he said i started coming he said something it's something about what you're saying and he said he he asked his brother he said you ever heard of this william branham guy and his brother's a street preacher down in uh that back home mobile and he said he told me he said he said no brother brown he said watch you where you hear that from he said this guy that come from to come to the prison he said you should listen to that guy he knows what he's talking about and he said now here's a prisoner he said his he said he said my dad asked me my dad asked me can you send me some of the books you've been reading in prison i said lord in this something that you say hey my brother one thing i i just realized if i go to jail i'm still going to hear about brother brad [Laughter] [Applause] if if i get locked up i'm still going to hear about brother brad so the question is you free right now you have a choice the question is do you really believe you see because you see the old text is everywhere people hear these prophecies see you can't put everything in the bible together people that call themselves christian don't have the whole bible put together and if you know everything but the brethren say you better run from that man and i want you to see here you see you see when you look at prophecy it's the oldest trick of the devil you're trying to come and try to put together prophecy something that even if it's a personal prophecy or testimony to you god didn't even tell you to look at that but that may be for you to share and if we believe it's a blessing but you see when when isaiah was there and he was talking to the king and he was sitting there and he said to the king he says king i want you to ask a sign from god and he said give me a sign and he said okay he said i don't want to bother god he said i don't want to i don't want to bother god you know he said but you asked people to do this you guys will do this but now you want to play the game or you don't want to ask god he said i'm going to tell you something anyway so isaiah looked at the king and he said i'll tell you what he said a virgin shall conceive and he said god himself will show you a sign that king never saw jesus that king never met man isaiah died and they said isaiah went to the tomb of a false prophet they said hold on where is it show us bring it through yeah and show me you would be sitting there if you believe brother brendan's fault you'll be reading your bible and you will stumble at the very same thing you better be careful how you listen to a prophecy but i'll tell you something i love what brother branham preached he said when you receive the holy ghost it'll lead and guide you into all truth when you get the holy ghost you don't know if it's a lie now you'll nervous alive now when you get the holy ghost when you get the holy ghost hallelujah god himself can't lie i want you to see something hallelujah just say hallelujah just as we just code we won't want to keep you you see what touched me is god himself if the sister was singing the song he's going to have a breath and you see sister the bride she's going to be beautiful she'll have no spots paul said i'll present to you a chase verge he said we've kept ourselves he says wow in the word of god he said what to bring you until what the very image the very thing of what god has been destined to be can i read something to you i'm gonna read this be finished it says this is jeremiah jeremiah he said in verse one chapter three they say if a man put away his wife and she go from him and become another man's shall he return to her again shall not that lamb be greatly polluted but thou has played the harlot with many lovers yet return again to me said the lord what kind of god do we serve yet return unto me hallelujah i always wanted to have brother bram in the prayer lines he always dealt with that woman after will and you think about we know the story he had to go by psycho the end he had to go by check him and he goes by this place by this whale about midday and brother brown will always talk about how he said before the prayer line you hear him always talking about this and he's sitting there and as he's as he's sitting there he's waiting on this woman to come and he would always use that for some reason to contact the spirit to contact the spirit this woman he's sitting there said come and give me something to drink who you who you think you are dealing with each other why are you even talking to me and he says hold on he said woman if you knew who it was he says that you would have asked me to give you something he said you mean that he said what do you mean he said sir the well is deep it's a very deep well and i don't see no bucket where is your bucket sir where is your bucket to get water what kind of water is this you talking about anyway everlasting water life you're saying that why bring you this water you have everlasting life what kind of what are you talking about and the woman he says he looks he says a woman he said if you only knew who was speaking to you he says look he said look i know i don't have no bucket but you think that the god of your father and of jacob you think because i i well you don't you don't believe me yet yes i gave them that well he didn't reveal it all to at once he's talking to a contact in the spirit trying to give her something better than what she thought she had caught she thought what she had carly and what she needed was all she needed she thought that was good but jesus wanted to give her something better this word that we have in this hour is for the bride it's for the bride it's not for the unbeliever it's for the bride and you see it was it's a special word because she knows and she appreciates everything that her lord has done for her she knows that she will be lost without it she knows that she'd be finished without so she doesn't run when she hears something that seems a little weird but once she does she says uh faith always says the word of god is right she sits there a little long he said lord i'll just sit and chew on it so maybe you'll explain it to me so she sits there and he says woman the wealth the water i got for you you ain't never had water like this she said sir i'm tired of coming to this well i'm tired of coming to get this natural water you said i want if you got water like you said you got let me have some of that one let me have it i would love to have it let me see what you got so she stopped and and now he don't just give it to him he has to paul he contact he said he looks in her life he says woman go get your husband before god can move first he's got to deal with the sin in your life before god can give you all that he wants to give you he's got to deal with where you are at right now he has to and that's what he did he contacted her spirit and he told her he said go get your husband say hey he said whatever you he said oh he said i ain't got no husband he said woman you had five the man you went right now is not yours and so then he says and i want you to say this just as we close i want you to just hear this he says he's saying he said right now i've got something for you but let me deal with your life so he goes past the front door the living room and he comes into the bedroom of your heart and he says do will you really allow me to have fellowship and this woman she stops and she says how how in the world could this man notice about me because he was the lord because he was the lord tonight i want to tell you this just in closing he contacted her spirit because he wanted to now enter in he wanted to give her something that she never had before so that she would know what a real man was like so she would know who her true father was how she would know what real joy was like how she would really know what it's all like to be called a bride that's what he was doing for he said woman you don't even know what you're worshiping yes they say you can go here and there in that time going they said your father they said you said go in the mountain my father said go worship here he said you say go worship in jerusalem but he says to he says her woman you don't even know what you're worshiping right you don't even know he don't call her name he calls who she is and he says i want you to catch it as we close he says he's contacting her spirit tonight if you want god to do something for you you have to let god enter in and deal with your spirit and as he deal with your spirit he looks down in your heart he looks down in your life and you say lord remove all the unbelief lord god help me to see cast off all the cares of this life and let me say oh hallelujah lord use me for your glory and lord i'll do whatever you have me do lord i'll go tell john she says here he began to talk to he said god is a spirit and those that worship god that come to a hotel a church in a prison they must worship god in spirit and in truth for the father seeking such to worship him so he says here he says and the woman said but when the messiah has come he said he should tell us all things and jesus said it is he who's speaking with thee [Music] oh ah ah you need to tell me and something inside she didn't go to her matthew concordance she didn't go all in her book in her libraries she didn't go to her pastor she didn't go hallelujah i pray you see it was something deep down inside that quickened the word of god to her to her you can't explain why sometimes you believe what you believe all you can say god said it that sells it i believe it hallelujah can you say that tonight i believe it lord and i'll tell you this in closing when he told her that you know what she did she the bible said she dropped her water pot she said get out of here hallelujah that means she left her denominational thinking she left all the old things and she came to say come see a man come see a man as we stand tonight just come see a man come see a man the man is called christ jesus that's why there is a man that can turn the lights tonight my brother my sister hallelujah tonight hallelujah as we just say lord god and we just as we invite the pastor of pastor but stephen he comes let's sing that song it says just pass me not old gentle savior if you just love him tonight can you just thank god for what he's done for you don't just get fat on the word but go tell john go tell john you know there's many people you have loved ones you have co-workers you know
