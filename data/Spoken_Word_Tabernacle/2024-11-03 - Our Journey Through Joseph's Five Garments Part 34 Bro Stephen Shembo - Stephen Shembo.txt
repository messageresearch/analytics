warms your heart to hear it doesn't it amen amen amen I'm going to let brother Greg come up here he has a spoken praise report this morning and uh we're going to let him come up and tell this and then uh we do have a we have a couple of specials you keeping your eyes on the light um yeah I sent this to Brother John just as a spoken praise report but then it just came on my heart I just need to speak this so um about a month I guess month and a half ago went to have my regular checkup everything was good except for my PSA it was 53 54 I think it was well he scheduled me to go see a urologist well they called sent me appointment about a week and a half two weeks out and and they called and said well he has to be in surgery that day so he need to reschedule and uh that was another two three weeks down the road and the whole time the devil's telling me you know this is going to go up it's going to get worse you know and I've been I was having some discomfort okay and I just kept I said Satan I said you can't touch me you know Jesus covered this when he said it's finished [Applause] so I finally made it to the urologist this is about a month and a half later I think it was and um he uh he checked my prostrate he said your prostrate is fine he drew some more blood to do a PSA check and he called me a day or two after that and said your PSA has dropped to to four and he said I'll see you in six months am that's that can get scary them numbers but God's a numerologist amen he got an answer for it we got a text from a neighbor uh of ours um she she has a daughter that's really really really got autism really bad so she we chat with her occasionally but she has people coming over to help her um you know caregive for the for the daughter and uh one of them uh just had a grandbaby and apparently when they were the little guy's name is Leo so apparently when they were when they were giving birth or the mama was giving birth um I'm not sure how it works but the doctors kind of help with something to get it out and they nicked his head in the back nicked it so um they you know they were trying to get it tested help me out if I'm wrong on this they were they were testing it but theyve concluded that it's uh menitis that was that it's developed into menitis in the little sword yeah just kind of blowing it yeah to Charlotte to line so yeah he's a week old so they've asked us to bring his name up that God can take care of it you know um um so his little his his name is Leo he's just a little guy and um you know I think that's probably a a common practice is it not um sister Rosemary about helping yeah we don't know that yeah it's just kind of sad that they would try to you know that's her opinion you know that they're trying to just kind of blow it off and minimize it and I I mean I can understand that but let's stand this morning we're going to go to the Lord this morning I'm going to get an extra microphone and ask brother um isari brother

we are further down in the in Piper's house so we will see if this month will allow us to move forward then in December we'll begin to come back up toward the surface and pick up where we were amen glory to God Amen if you there you can say amen amen you should be even coming to service and they already have so many too on right there amen glory to God verse one we already prayed so flight attendant prepare for take off the Bible say in PM 82 a Psalm of aav he say God stand in the congregation of the mighty you might be seated so there is a congregation call the congregation of the mighty sister Lily God loves you so much you won't understand but usually I receive questions from believer and she sent me a wonderful question when I look at that I thought it was uh simple and when we begin to chat with quot back in for after a while the question got really deep I said wait a minute this should be a question and answer box so I answer the best to the best that I can and last night around 1:00 a.m. in the morning the boss begin to give me again stuff about your question I say sister Lily so you're the one talking to the boss to give me all of this now I have to change the sermon again amen so there is a congregation in heaven yes call the congregation of the might amen so whoever is in this congregation is not [Laughter] feeble if you belong to this congregation mighty man you must be a might amen if you notice they didn't say m men or woman they just say m come on man they didn't say m man they didn't say Mary woman they say the congregation of who so whoever is there whether it's a man or a woman they are what are we together who is in that congregation there brother TR men who is there amen it's a Congregation of the mighty are we together and the Bible say God stand [Applause] there in word if you need to find God you need to find that congregation where the congregation is that's where God [Applause] is amen amen [Laughter] am and in that congregation amen he God does what judg among so no one can judge anybody in that congregation beside God himself it is only God himself amen that judges over there amen the Bible says and he judges among the who God so these m m Are Who gods so it's a Divine congregation CH is a Divine amen these people are Mighty and they are Gods let the weak say I am strong are we together where is this congregation because sister L's question was brother Steven the Bible says in the Book of Job I'm already taking off so you're going to hear I'm just moving the airplane I'm following there is like a traffic the first airplane have to go the second the third then uh finally we will take off okay so just keep looking at the airport and everything everything will be okay all right so sister Lily asked me a question she said brother Stephen in the Book of Job the Bible said the sons of God Amen gathered together and the devil also came that's right that's right and she asked the question who are those sons of God that's good question amen are they Angels or they are sons of God human being hard to get this stuff Amen in the book of Hebrew chter 12 verse 22 oh my I'm going 25 M the Bible say but ye are come unto m [Music] you're thinking about the mountain in Jerusalem right right right so we all need to take a flight and go to Israel there's war there where is that mon Zion the Bible say but year come unto mon Zion we all came to mon Zion some of the stuff in this message we need to clarify stuff because we have Pentecostal or denomination or idea amen he say we you come unto mon Zion Kama unto the city of the Living God right that's right not the city of men of a living God if you want to find a living God you go in that City where is that City because MC was king of Salem amen amen but that Salem was not the right here because Abraham would have gone to that City and go ahead and get in that City but the Bible say Abraham was looking for a city who's what Builder is not what is not man but it's God himself so that city is not here and the Bible say you came to M Zion you came to the city of the Living God come on the Heavenly what Jerusalem so this Jerusalem is not Earthly it is a Jerusalem where Heavenly okay God stand in the congregation of what the mighty ah the bible say that you came to the Heavenly Jerusalem come on let me put here we have a Heavenly Jerusalem a Heavenly Jerusalem amen we need to know who is in this Jerusalem the Bible says come and to the innumerable company of who Angels so in this city when you get there angels are there are we together Amen in this city we got Angels so who are the sons of God that sister Lily was asking are the angel push the break verse 23 the Bible say to the general you came let's go brother Ben go read uh 22 you came to what to you came you ared you AR arrived the GPS say you have arrived you have arrived where in M amen amen in that M there is a city now we begin to break it down okay so you arrive in mon you see a city and that city is called Jerusalem amen amen and in Jerusalem Angel are singing and everything amen but now in verse 23 to the general assembly it's an assembly that is General amen and there is not a c and the church and church so this assembly is a church are we together it's a church of the first born yes sir sir if you notice the Bible didn't say the Church of first borns I hope you guys are learning how to read your Bible amen when I teach my daughter Ma I say you read math as Daddy read is his Bible that's how you get math amen he says and the Church of the firstborn are we together how many firstborn are there one it's not a firstborn uhhuh but the Church of who the first born so the first born have a [Applause] church amen amen there is a church whose Pastor yes sir is the firstborn so when you get there you say where is the pastor they say the pastor is the first born are we together amen so there is a church there is an assembly an assembly there is a tabernacle there is a church there is an assembly amen amen there is a Tabernacle in heaven and the Tabernacle belongs to somebody or the Tabernacle has a pastor and the pastor of that Tabernacle the head is called the firstborn that's right amen amen we clear he said to the general assembly and the Church of the firstborn which are written where in heaven so In Heaven There is a church are we together amen and in that church they got names written there what I'm trying to say is you didn't start church [Music] here you didn't start going to church [Applause] here you already going to church somewhere else that's why you love coming to [Applause] church as long as the first born is [Applause] there are we together have I lost somebody the Bible said to the general assembly and the Church of the firstborn which are written where in heaven and to God do you see that the what judge of all ah so in that church God is the church but the Bible say in Psalm 82 that in the congregation of the M God is the judge are we together are we together and we got Angels over there but now not only Angel watch what is coming out the Bible say andto God the judge of all come and to the What Spirit of who just men made how can you make a just man Perfect come on take your time brother amen it means that just man will have something that's exactly but even though they have something they have to make that just man perfect so to begin with you just and you will be made perfect later on yes sir you see this shell here is bad you see this person inside here amen he's good amen amen this person is just but on the outside he's bad that's why they need to make him perfect are we together the Bible say and to the spirits plural of just men made how perfect so this church got angels and men not men in the body the spirits of men amen not the spirit of animals and not any kind of man the just men are we together so your spirit was already in the Church of God are we together am before you start church here so you existed somewhere don't worry my friend you going to catch it Roman 8 verse 29 the Bible say for whom he did what for know where did he know you for know so before you were you already be known he said to whom he did what for know he also did what predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he the son may be the what first born among what many Brethren the Church of the first born so the first born is the son amen amen amen am and God want all the brothers he have many Brethren he's the first born among many what in other word he was not the only one that came out from that womb are we together but whoever came from that womb need to be confirmed or match him that's exactly amen because in the beginning he was the first one that was created as the logos that's right Amen in the beginning was the word and the Word was with who and the Word was what God so God gave birth to himself but God never stopped that birth right there he birth other Sons that's right but the first one that came was Christ and after Christ there are brothers that follow Christ and Christ and all the brothers are one church and Christ is the [Applause] pastor he's the firstborn among many Brethren so he's your brother that's right amen I'm reading the Bible he is your brother amen don't worry Colossians 1 verse1 15 the Bible say who Jesus Christ is the image of what the invisible God the first born you see that again of what every creature so before God create any of us he created himself first that's right God created himself God became a son the son is not different than the Father the Son is another manifestation of the Father the father lower himself to become a son in other word we are fragments of God I have a question what happened in the app room what happened in the Apper room the pillar of fire came and did what and chop himself why was he chopping himself up because those are are Pillar of Fire make sense he chop himself in other words from the pillar of fire were coming out some pillars of fire because those Pillar of Fire were already in eternity so when he's coming in the upper room he have a list of the Church of the first born the Church of the firstborn in heaven God name that are written if your name is over there God will find your God part and dispatch it and release it so your Pillar of Fire is different than my Pillar of Fire but it's the same material amen so when we bring all the pillar of fire together then we begin to get God back again like he was in the [Applause] original that's why it's not good for God to be alone because he's missing part of himself he's missing a rib and that rib need to be brought back again through marriage amen are we together amen so God stand in the congregation of the might it is a congregation it it is a church it is an assembly it is a tabernacle where God is the pastor amen and then everybody else is gods are we together amen are we together amen let's go to verse six god brother Bram say before we were born our bodies were on Earth since since Genesis when they created the Earth your body was already there job bypassed the theophany that's why God took him like job where were you in other word look up there you're going to find yourself over there do you see yourself clapping hand there you were already there somewhere in that how how can we shout for joy and clap hand over there was a church that's why a church cannot be [Applause] quiet when you go to a church people are quiet like this that's not the congregation of the Mar in the congregation of the might there is power there is noise there is hallelujah glory to God blessed be the name of the Lord somebody's crapping somebody stud that is the Church of the Living God [Applause] am brother I'm saying wherever Jesus is there is noise am so don't give me a quiet message [Applause] church let people be free let them sing like bird in the morning because we are free indeed the son has made us free amen let us rejoice [Applause] amen you get you singing you standing like a robot not in this church we sing we do this that's how we were doing in heaven and that's why I'm going to do that in heaven [Applause] again it's a Congregation of the let me preach my friend let's go to verse six go ahead my brother I have said ye are Gods we become so formal till we are dead amen so dead and you find a whole Pew of people sleeping no fire no fire how can you be in the presence of God and be [Applause] quiet do you know what the presence of God does to you it might even affect your body until you begin to feel some cold CHS coming up because God is present [Applause] yes and you can't wait to go to church because you're going to go in the congregation of the might when we get there everybody strong let the weak say I am strong in other way don't confess your weakness remember you are [Applause] Mighty Oh Glory to God W where are we at my friend verse six okay verse six amen I

somebody left Heaven an angel left [Applause] Heaven are we together in Revelation in he was Christ himself you don't go to heaven so you must meet him first somewhere and see the face of a father before he get you back home it is the rising of the Sun what happened William Mar brh he said if you turn the picture like this and do what you can probably see it from what the audience it is who it's Christ see he see what his eyes looking here looking here just as perfectly as what it could be wearing the what white way of what Supreme deity and judge who judges among the mighty that's why he came like a mighty [Applause] angel in other words the judge himself Has Come Oh God he says the judge of what all heavens and earth can you see what his ey and what no and what amen congregation say what amen just turn the picture from this the way what they had it this way and the way it's supposed what to be can you see it amen he is what Supreme judge there is none other but who him and that is a a perfect identification again a Vindication that this message is what the truth this is what the truth it is what truth making him not the third person but what the only person with the white you see you see the dark his face with what his beard and what his eye notice are you ready are you ready notice from him comes what this light doing what shining on the right hand side to which he's looking to remember this boy was guilty he needed somebody to sanction his verdict somebody to justify him and only the daddy can leave home amen not to kill him but to embrace him and to kiss him and remove everything away from [Applause] [Music] himall let's go to look again drop to verse [Laughter] uh amen amen amen amen jum to verse 20 let's go my friend and he arose amen he rose and what and came to his father and came to his father but when he was what yet a great way off so he was a great distance far away from the home from the house from Heaven amen amen amen amen amen amen he way from off his father did what saw him and and and had what compassion continue my friend and ran and ran and did what and fell on his neck and and did what and kissed him watch carefully so the father is no longer here are we together the father is now here and the Bible said this distance here was far off am amen amen so you can holler here and somebody here doesn't get you really clearly are we together jum to verse uh uh 21 and the son said to him what father uhhuh I have what sinned against Heaven coming from the harot from denomination and in your sight I'm no more what worthy to be called thy son but the father say to who his servant stop where is the Son and the father are they here or there are they here or there they are here and the father when he had the son here turned around and speak to the servant so the father didn't leave [Applause] [Music] [Applause] himself are we together so when the father was running servant was also running when the cloud came that's why he came with more than one Angel not one Angel seven Angel it got to be a cloud coming are we together amen this message is perfectly mind with the Bible together are we together are we together so he came not himself he came with seven angels but one of them was the most important the one that had a chest like this because he's the one that got a message he was the seven here every other were familiar brother I'm saying but there was one that was peculiar and that was Christ are we together are we together when he comes he embrace the child and kiss him brother Bram said removing all sins and Care in other words justifying the child amen he never even pay attention he say servant give him the best Rob in other word he never done anything to begin with because the judge is the lawyer he's the one that is let's read brother Bram are we together Are You full okay brother Bram say and on the cross that is where he did what he looked brother Bram say as the cloud comes when you flip the cloud Jesus look on the right side yes sir and brother Bram say that is the way he was looking at the cross yes sir sir amen amen that is the way he looked to what the right where he did what Pardon The Sinner amen so God when he's coming down remember the cross we got two crosses amen one was a child of the devil are we together one was a child of God but bad on the outside yes with a bad record are we together and Jesus Lo to the right he look here amen because Judah had to pick up this one and when he look here brother Bram say he Pon remember the book to the right and brother Bram say when he's coming down as a judge he's not coming to condemn he's coming looking again at the right hand to find that criminal the one that were guilty in order to pardon the guilty one so the coming of the cloud is a Grace of Pardon toward the elect seed of God this Cloud came to remove your record to remove your history to remove everything bad that you [Applause] did listen to me my friend listen to me my friend if you go to the court Hallelujah okay you go to the court you see the judge they judge your case the first day and they say you need to come the next day you come the next day they say you come three until you begin to know the judge and you know the face of the judge and you know even the name of the judge and you know even the nose of the judge you can look at the face of the judge and say this is the judge that judges me amen and later on you receive a letter in the mail amen and the letter say that your case has been dismissed how are you going to be a home how are you going to be a home after how many already spend the money to a lawyer ah suppose you already spent $115,000 and they dismiss your case so no more income for the lawyer but now let me ask you a question what about if you H your doorbell ring are we together are we together and you open the door and you see the judge he said I came myself to deliver your dismission who are you that the judge can come to your home so the judge coming to your home it means that your case is very special you must be more important than you think that the judge of Heaven and Earth the Supreme judge have to move down to dismiss your case so when we looking at the cloud we looking at love we looking at pardon we looking at Resurrection we looking at our case is dismissed the J is he didn't send
