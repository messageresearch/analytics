visitors God richly bless you and welcome to spoken word Tabernacle and we trust it to be a blessing amen you might be seated a few minute as I'm going straight toward my announcement I believe everybody is up to date with the sermon I believe we're reading our Bible twice a day two chapters amen uh you know job had to make sure that his children were doing the right thing amen and he had to put up a sacrifice every morning just to make sure all kids are protected so I need to make sure you all doing the right thing and you are protect protected under the blood amen so the Bible twice a day Cod Church ages 70 weeks of Daniel the seals adoption or somebody is listening or reading the message of the hour amen yesterday we have a Young's men meeting and we talked about the priorities and depths so hopefully by the grace of God I don't want anybody to be in depth in this church so the young people should be free from that and Lord's next time we will talk to them about how to get out of depth if you already in trouble amen so they know what it is they know the principle of the Bible because every time you take a depth you actually hiring yourself yeah ask the young people who tell you approve them by the scripture every time you take a depth you hire yourself to work for somebody that's right approved to them by the scripture that's right you ask them they will tell you the secret amen so brother abble please you work with me on the next day and we get them squared away amen Lord's willing on March the 23rd this is our question and answer and our young Sisters Meeting will be on April the 20th amen I mentioned about friendship last Sunday and I back it up with the quotes of brother Bram I believe I give you I don't know three or four quot or two quotes about friendship and also what I spoke on Wednesday about whatever you're doing look at the coming of the Lord by keep working I gave you four quot to back up everything so whoever is in there you should receive those quot and keep it for yourself amen we have some wonderful singing going on I'm sitting there and I was thinking because God is doing great things in this church and elsewhere I have powerful testimony I even have images of them before and after so maybe one day brother Kelly we'll find maybe a Wednesday where we pray get some testimonies first and then some good singing and we pray the testimony will boost your faith and you see the before and after what God is doing is in people's life it will Amaze you completely God is alive amen I didn't prepare that but maybe one of this day if it's uh the person will let me do it I'll put it up on the screen and you will see what God is doing in people's life how God is transforming that power that resurrect power of the Holy Spirit you see what he's doing in people's body amen so I don't see any problem in your life that the Lord cannot tackle whatever is going on God is more than able to do it amen so we ready for part three let's go ahead and climb up and see where we are with Joseph and the quat of Many Colors amen glory to God God gave me Grace I finished the young men meeting one point and I dropped to give support to brother Leon who lost the little the young fellow in a skateboard and we were there and express our uh condolences to the family on behalf also of spoken word Tabernacle am so continue to pray for the mother continue to pray for the family so the Lord will strengthen them amen am glory to God let's go straight to our scripture in Genesis chapter 15 yes sir the mic is up too high praise God better better better don't worry we already got a plan for this it's working how do you do all this thing how do you go to the young men meeting and then you leave and you go do all of these and you come back and you have to preach in the morning I taught the young people the young sisters and the young Brothers the first principle in finances you need to know how to budget your time if you budget your time well you will accomplish many things we all have 24 hours that's it it some in 24 hours they only do one thing some will do 10 know how you budgeting your time poverty link directly if not knowing how to budget your time sleep too much trouble Sleepless trouble you got to balance it up amen let's go to Genesis chapter 15 praise God if you thereare you can say amen amen Genesis 15 don't worry about this sound you'll be okay that's if you want me to remove this you let me know and then I get another one I just like my hand to be free amen Genesis 15 verse 13 if you dare you can say amen amen and he said to Abraham know of assurity that your seed shall Sur in a Strange Land in a land shall be a stranger I'm sorry in a land thank you very much I love your spoken word know of shity that your seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years you can read this two ways you might be seated you can read what you see and what you see is God is telling uh Abraham that your seed your children will be Stranger in a land and they will afflict them for 400 years that's all you can see depending on how you digging but this scripture or this prophecy has the name of Joseph in amen but it's it's there amen but you cannot read it with your eyes read it you need to he it to read it with a spiritual eyes how did you find Joseph here how did you find this prophecy contain many people many people's life are written in this prophecy but if you look you don't see their name depending on how you reading let's read it over again verse 13 and he said to Abraham know of of assurity that your seed the Seed of Abraham is like the sand that is on the seashore so everybody that is the Seed of Abraham is included right here amen amen amen you don't need to see your name written like the way your parent give you that is to identify you with your uncle or your grandma or your family this is a different family and the Bible says and your seed shall be a stranger in the land that is not theirs the question you need to ask yourself how are they going to be stranger how are they going to move from The Promised Land all the way to a Strange Land of Egypt yes so when you begin to answer that question you will see Joseph is hidden right there because Joseph is the one that caus Israel to leave and to go to the uh to Egypt but if you look you don't see Joseph but Joseph is there so the life of Joseph was already wrapped up amen in the prophecy of Abraham so whatever Joseph is doing is connected to something am that's why everything work together for good amen verse 14 and also that nation which is Egypt whom they Shall Serve will I judge and I afterward shall they come up with a great what substance now you can read with me differently you can see Moses right here amen hallelujah you need these things are written in the tunders they are in the Bible but you cannot see them with your hand they are not outside the Bible they're written in the Bible but they are hidden so right here chapter verse uh 13 you got Joseph and on verse 14 you got Moses how did they came out it was Moses that's right so when God is coming he say I remember my promises that I made unto Abraham that's that's why I have come down to deliver my people he's already telling Moses you were included in that prophecy amen I just hid you so that the devil would not decode you that's right all of these are hidden under the seven seal amen so the life of Joseph way before he even come on the scene was already written locked up in a prophecy your life also is locked up in a prophecy am because the Bible say I will send you who is you I will send you who Elijah the prophet so that prophecy that you is many people but as for me and my house am they send me William Mar BR so when you look in that prophecy depends on what you looking at my name is written there amen your name is written there and how do you know that your name is written there look at the way you respond to William Mar BR in other way you cannot take brother brandham out of the picture without taking me out amen God you cannot put brother Bram in the heaven without having me and if I'm not there this message is not doing what it's supposed to be doing because it's me they send me me am are we together amen let's go to Isaiah 14 praise the Lord glory to God I'm showing you way way way way way before you were born something was already there hallu amen glory to God Isaiah 14 verse 24 if you dare you can say Amen the Bible says that the Lord of host has swor if God swear it's that say you in trouble he had Sor saying surely as I have taught God so shall it come what to pass so before because a word is a thought Express so even the thoughts of God are already accomplished when God think about something it's already done am whatever God taught about you amen it's fin now amen it will come to pass whether you like it or not even if you refuse it yourself am it will come to pass amen amen he said surely I have thought so shall he come to pass and as I have done what purpose so shall he what stand if God Tau it purpose it no matter what's going to happen it will happen amen that word purpose let's go to Isaiah 46 we read this together so you should be good with Isaiah 46 now glory to God Amen Isaiah 46 verse 9 if you dare you can say amen amen remember the former things of old for I am God and there is who none else and I am who God and there is what none like me why when he think about something it's done when he purpose something it's done that's why he can speak something before it happen because he already have the movie amen every okay amen declaring the what end from the beginning because I already know everything that end is according to God's purpose it's according to God's plan he knows the end from the beginning and from ancient time the things that are not yet done saying my what counil shall stand and I will do my own what my pleasure he thought am he's counsel he is purpose he is pleasure is f amen amen amen that's why don't fight God Amen do you know when I say don't fight God you're looking at this right come on when I say don't fight God you're looking at this man which is God that's not what I'm saying I'm saying don't fight [Applause] [Music] God did you get what I'm saying don't fight God [Applause] because whatever is in his life will happen whether you agree with it or not it will happen amen you will have a heart attack for nothing because your wishes your your wishes won't come true they will only come true if they are matching God wishes for me amen wish me good my friend wish me good hallelujah amen verse 11 calling a what a ravenous bird from what the East you know that now the man that execute what my counsel from what a far country he will move things all the way why yeah I have what spoken it and I also will do what bring it to pass I have what purposed it and I will also what do it what he has spoken F what he desire F what he plans FAL what he purpose final what he think finall amen why do we trouble ourself in life amen amen amen amen let's go to First Peter chapter 1 and then we'll be getting ready to pray glory to God hallelujah amen amen First Peter chapter 1 very familiar scripture amen the Bible says in verse six wherein you greatly Rejoice amen amen though now for a what season if need be what he means here if you look at another translation God is saying here that sometime it is necessary for a certain season to go through trouble let's just pray because you start claming too high now let's go Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly again this morning Father we thank you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us thank you for this great opportunity to gather together with the scent of like Precious Faith father me myself I am unworthy to be standing before the brde and to be speaking to them about the Holy Oracles of God lord you have given me the privilege to even read the scripture but I pray that you move me completely out of the way so that you speak to us all Lord and bless us and transform our life and those that are streaming and be the beginning and the ending of this service in the name of Jesus Christ amen Paul is saying here that wherein you greatly Rejoice you are rejoicing though now for a season for a period of time if need be it's necessary for this season you are in what heaviness through man through what manifold Temptation so there are certain season that are not good but they necessary for your growth am amen amen amen it's a season it is a period of time amen amen and this period of time is painful amen amen but it is necessary it is necessary but it is necessary amen amen it is necessary it need to be it is necessary necessary why it is necessary for your growth amen amen amen so sometime in our life God uses season and the good thing is is a season it is not [Applause] Eternal a season mean he has a beginning and whatever has a beginning must is under obligation to have an end in other word god frame it God give him a time frame sir a limit somewhere where he start and he finish but there is a purpose behind that season hallelujah amen and that season for your information won't kill you because it's a necessary season if he ever kill you just know there is a resurrection [Music] am maybe might kill you for three days amen because you need to visit hir for three days and then after three days whether they put a big Stone on the tomb the mighty angel will come down roll on the stone and pull you up and the people would know that you're not the same way you went in when you went in you were feeble but when you come out nobody can touch you amen you come out more powerful than the way you went [Applause] in are we together are we together glory to God verse six wherein he greatly Rejoice do now for what season if it need be you are what in heaviness through what manold Temptation many various Temptation various testing verse seven that the what trial of your faith Hallelujah so there is a faith you understand this now amen there is is a faith this Faith lay dormant but this Faith need to be challenged because a faith need a challenge amen so the trial of your faith being how much more precious than of gold that do what perishes oh Jesus so you cannot even it's Priceless amen that trial is priceless it is more than than anything that perishes here though he be try with what fire might be found to the what praise and honor and and what and Glory at the what appearing of Jesus Christ in other word whatever that season bringing at the end the result will be always good am the result will be For Your Glory it will be for your praise it will be for your honor even though it looks like it's disqualifying you the result will be what my friend for the praise and what and glory and honor sorry honor and what and Glory don't you remember in the Book of Revelation they say glory and honor and Praises he came to Jesus Christ after he rose from the dead but when he was on the cross he was naked no honor no Praises no glory but when he rise up honor praises and glory amen don't worry about your reputation am this period of time buil your reputation amen don't worry my friend yes sir so there is a time that is necessary God use it he has a beginning he has an end it is necessary for something for your growth let's go to uh First Peter chapter 5 we already prayed here we have a beginning of this season and we also have an ending of the season so you will get in the season you cry and everything then after a while you come out of the Season we clear uh 1 Peter 5:10 if you dare you can say amen amen but the god of what all Grace who has done what called us to his eternal what Glory that's the purpose by who Christ Jesus after amen not before after that you have what suffered a while if you notice that suffering is a while amen it is a suffering for a period am it is a suffering for a season amen after now Peter the same Peter who was talking about the trial of your faith now you going into a period now Peter comes back again he say when you hit the end of that season of that trouble period after a while amen amen verse 10 after a while after you have after that you have suffered make you how perfect thank you Jesus amen so all the suffering is to perfect you amen am as much as he doesn't look like it's perfecting you because the way you look usually it's destructive you will think it's bringing you down it is not bringing you down it is actually perfecting [Applause] you in other word God is fixing something in your life to make sure people understand you [Music] better because some don't have a clear vision of who you are some have tested you to see if you are really who you say you are so God will allow something to come and when you come out of it they say truly this is a lion amen amen are we together amen he says I didn't plan this sermon man I'm just deliverer I'm just the Amazon guy okay I'm delivering here and I take a picture and I go home okay praise God God after what make you how perfect come and how do you know what it means stabilized so after your trial than you are coming up perfect and more stabilized amen amen establish come and how streng and how so when they send a problem toward your path just know God is already wearing a mask amen and he already have surgical tools you going through a surgery God is working when he finish the surgery you stable am you more stronger than before you more established than before you understand things better amen amen amen sometime they say well after trial we need to go back the same way we were no no P say we changes am there got to be some changes and you will see me a little bit [Applause] different because I'm more stable amen God removes certain things that were supposed to be removed quickly and correct everything and bring me in more Perfection if not you didn't go through a good trial the trial bring you up in other word God is trying to move you from here to here he's using certain things here and when you finish you are here you can no longer be here am if you hear something is wrong you have to be here if you look behind you say praise the Lord I'm glad now this happened because now my eyes can see more clear you're no longer 155 you 2020 Vision amen amen amen so there is a time where your trouble start and it's a period that is necessary but after it is finished just know it will be for your praise MH for your honor For Your Glory you will be more settle you will be established you will be perfect you will be even strengthen am that's why brother Bram say when a tree goes through many trial that's when the root begin to go way deeper and it stabilizes the tree more so the shaking that you see here in the invisible part something there is a growth even though you don't see I am [Applause] growing Hallelujah are we together are we together my subject this morning is our life Journey again through Joseph five garment part three now you understand when Paul is saying that we know that what all things work together all things work together for what good to them that do what love God and to them who are what called according to what his purpose how many are here this morning that are called according to God's purpose amen am amen amen if you are called according to God purpose all things am in other word we amen this is the outcome or this is the result amen amen amen amen here we got things things can be good all things can be bad amen amen so between these things and the result of the outome God put a filter he puts a transforming filter this filter careless what is coming through it are we together this filter have only one objective to make sure whatever input he get the output

Lord came how mightily upon and he rent him as what he would have rent a [Applause] kid Samson didn't kill the lion like a lion he killed the lion like he was killing a goat so the spirit of the Lord transformed the lion unto a goat unto a baby goat [Applause] that Tri that you think is bigger it is just small wait for God to come down wait for the spirit of the Lord when he comes down then you are growing like a big [Applause] giant gol was a big man a tall man sir come on come [Music] on Oh Glory to God the Bible says this Hallelujah he says that what he rent him as he would have rent what

that you think you are the most vulnerable when Jesus is weak after fasting hungry that is when he is even more powerful when the devil tested him it is [Applause] written he says he had nothing in what his hand but he told not his who father or what his mother what he has what done everybody clear am that trial came was he good for Samson was he good when the lion was rowing when you grow to a trial after a period of time what happened good result whatever comes a lion bad but if he goes through the filter W must come out of that lion who must come out of that lion as bad as the lion have

we don't want tribulation how can you glory in Tribulation you have to remove every claim of the devil in your life every claim every Power you giv to the devil stripping the devil doesn't mean you go you say Satan stand here take your shirt off take your pant off that doesn't mean what he means you must strip the devil of all the authority you put on him because you look at the Devil like somebody who come and then everything Begin to Fall Away no no no no you're the one that gave him that power by watching too much movie now you need to change your conception the Bible say the day we will look at the devil people will say that is this the man that was troubling all of us it's written in the Bible the day you will see the devil you will say h you if I knew this is you I don't know why I was crying because he's a bluff he doesn't have no Sting the sting was taken at the cross death where is your sting gra where is your Victory the Devil is a blast he have a he have a but there is no Arrow

WIll begin to train you and say the contraction you begin to feel like this that's why the pastor train you that's why the pastor train you that when your blessing is about to come you will begin to see things moving out the TR remember and get ready to push a baby must be born the hour has [Applause] come everybody okay a pregnancy come from a seed seed and the word of God is a seed everybody

what have sorrow why because her hour is come but as what soon as she is delivered of the child as soon as she's delivered of the child what happened she remembers no more the anguish she remember what no more why for joy that a man is born she's more interested in the new blessing she doesn't remember the delivery room anymore she don't even remember the name of the nurse that help her hallah because now it's the baby the baby's crying the baby diaper the baby the baby God have moved you from a pregnant woman onto a true mother so your Tri move you from one step to [Applause] another before you were pregnant woman now you're not a pregnant woman you have a you a woman with a baby [Applause] [Music] are we together amen are we together am that's why all things all things do what work together good based on that this is why brother Bram says this remember reminding you God go ahead my friend and God sets a time and a what and has a purpose for what for everything that he does there is a time there is a season and there is a purpose that is connected to that season when the time come birth pain must happen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen glory to God if you need some

I won't stop you from pushing you continue to push so the baby comes out you learn OBGYN technique my friend it's a spiritual OBG YN can I continue it says and God set a time and a purpose for what everything that he does there is what nothing happens just how accidentally to those who what love the Lord and our called how according to his calling we are what predestinated and everything work just right just right even though you think it's not right it is just right in other word God is not surprised you the one that say oh my God God say just right just right for that because he cannot lie continue my friend and he said that was so uh-huh that everything has its time he has its time he has what it season he has what it way and God is behind what every move that lion God was there am that lion that was coming God was there am that birth pain God was there that tribulation God was there am Hallelujah to make sure you don't burn out can I continue he said God is behind what every move and sometime you think that everything is going how wrong it is up to who us those things are put upon us what are they trials and what and wondering it is what testing to see how we will what react on an action we will react on an action coming back to our Joseph amen am we found last Sunday that the trouble of Joseph was based on the quality you remember that different quality different caliber bring trouble brother Bram say so is a what a real believer today he is of a what a different quality they shall do what separate themselves they don't what understanding it's what Copper from Silver listen to brother Braham in this brother Braham say all this Believers as we could go on for hours all these were like a bunch of what change out of your pocket in what God's hand brother Bram say Believers are like change in God's Pocket I'm reading William May BR penni n Diamond 50 some are $1 some are $5 some are 5050 some are $1100 bill can you say Amen you pull out a bunch of what CH there is what pennies and what nickel what dime what quarter what half of dollars what dollar all in what coins that is what the world is in God's hand amen I'm letting you soak that in amen because in this message we say we all the same we all the same we all the same we all the same we all the same we not the same you are not brother Bram I cannot be brother Bram brother Bram is the prophet of the age I am a local pastor we are [Applause] different so don't try to do what brother Bram did because we are different brother Bram say that is what the world is in what God's hand there is some people that you just can't have a what pen worth of it and God can only use them for what in a penny way they don't have more than a penny you you you you you deal with it yourself he says and God canot only use them in a what a pen way that's all they can do what so don't expect your friend to believe what you believe in am because maybe his faith is a penny your faith is a dollar God is pushing you to get a dollar value you are blocked with your penis friend and usually when a penny don't reach something he doesn't want anybody else to reach it and if you try to reach it then he will say oh you trying to show off no my caliber is a dalar you are a penny that's why brother BR say I cannot stand in the way of somebody who want to take God in his way a because we have different level am God deals with the genter as individual are we together am are we together listen to what he says he says that God can only use them in a what a penny way that's all they can do what don't reject them if they can't believe the what real truth don't turn them down don't kick them out and say they are not in there because God uses what pennies sometimes lot was just a what penny can you say amen amen Abraham was a what silver dollar so he taken what 100 lots to make who Abraham aund what carnal Believers will never stand in the presence of a what a genuine Christian that is how separated from the what the carnal things of the world living where in Christ Jesus where the word can what flow through him Hallelujah he is the god of [Applause] variety are we together are we together that's why you can find among the singers all the singer have beautiful voices but they have different tone [Music] y beautiful voices jerusa beautiful voices Lily beautiful voice zad beautiful voice uh who sister beautiful voice whoever I didn't have time to call beautiful voices but your voices are different when we are in a choir we need to know which one to give the ball sometime it is your she

mov with what envy and they did what sold him Envy when you don't want to accept God's way the way he want things to run in word you have your agenda different than God agenda God agenda say brother Benjamin you say no I want brother Charles Hamilton that's when Envy begin amen everybody okay amen he says and sold him why they do the same thing when today they sold him for what Envy do you know that Jesus was sold for Envy listen to this my friend in act 7:9 the Bible said the who the patriarch move with what With Envy do you see why the message is perfectly in line with the Bible brother Bram Say by Envy did he give you a scripture no sir he said they move by what with envy and sold Joseph into what Egypt but God was what with him let me continue my friend but pilot answered them saying will ye that I released unto you the king of the Jews for what he knew that the who the chief priest had delivered him for what enies different Cal different quality but the chief priest moved the what people that they should rather release who people with Envy usually don't stop with it at themselves they usually must find disciple that they can spread that en am amen are we together are we together are we together amen amen don't worry let me continue the Bible says brother Bram say what he really was they say he was for what jealousy for jealousy it was for jealousy they didn't want to what break down because that the quality in what them were not the quality that was where in him and because of it they were how jealous because they were how pennies and he was a what a dollar amen are we together are we together let's go to Genesis 37 [Music] now a very bad things call Envy you there let's go to Genesis 37 let me see where we are I'm good in time my friend very very good in time indeed if you dare you can say amen amen Genesis 37 put your seat belt here my friend we claming again amen amen ah glory to God verse six if you there you can say amen amen in my paper I'm here so I'm here we still have to travel okay all of this I'm still here so hang on okay verse six we there amen the Bible says this and he said to them here I pray you this dream which I have dreamed follow me carefully spoken word for behold we were doing what binding she in the water the field which job was higher than than the other all of them were doing what all of them were doing the same thing are you following me there is something that is uh you know when you have a gun when you shoot the next bullet goes up and then get into so I'm feeling the next bullet is coming up already and loading I don't want to shoot it yet okay the next one is coming up are we together amen he says and behold we were all binding what she in the field and lo my shei did what arose stop so apparently right here all those shei were dorment amen sir am I reading something different and they were all binding their shei they took the shei they were binding the shei Joseph didn't say that I took my sheath and I made a stand Joseph say the she did what who made that sheep to arose we need to go in detail now who did it because brother Bram this is the bullet that was loading spoke about slave in America that were all doing the same work and the buyer came but the buyer found one of them that was different amen when everybody was going this way that man has his chest up amen chest up in the message we call that proud in the message rank when you stand up like this we say you are proud but when the seven Angel met brother he was standing up like [Applause] this amen so there was something different about that slave than anyone one else and he put that St that slave in an attitude that is different than anyone until his owner never even understood him he said wait a minute what is wrong with this slave he's eating the same food doing the same food sleeping in the same place but when he react he always react different because in the slave was a revelation right the slave knew where he came from are we together in this dream all the chief were laying down they were all each person ruin here Zulan here naftali here Asha here all of them were pulling their staff together suddenly Joseph she Rose and stood we clear let's read it and behold your Chiefs did what they did what verse verse seven for behold we were banding sheeps in the field and L my she did what AR they fill this also the world that's what the scripture says amen and stood what upright who put the shei to stand upright God J look there Joseph didn't do it the she itself stood up there was a power that came and selected Joseph shei and that power made that shi stand upright but that power didn't stop there follow me carefully that power went and begin to collect other ships we clear we clear and behold your shei did what your Chiefs did what stood round about and made what Obe in other words they bow down to who my who made the shift to bow down Hallelujah are we together the same power that erected the Sheep of Joseph GL to God is the same power that took the other sheep ER wrecked them and made them bent that's why don't fight God the same power that is rising Jesus from the dead is the same power that will make every me to bow down before Jesus Christ amen amen when God selected somebody whether you like it or not God will bring you to understand his own language you may fight brother Bram but at the end of the day God will show you that brother Bram was his servant the same power that is rising up Joseph is the same power that is taking you and making you bent so you recognize because that standing of Joseph come from God and that bowing down come from God am are we together have I lost somebody have I lost somebody look at his brother verse six and his Brethren said to him eight shall you indeed re over us that's all they can see because they always look at the big picture they don't see the details if they would have asked a question wait a minute how did your shift stood they would be probably thinking twice but all they see ah so you mean you're going to be the chief and we your worker you start playing games amen oh you shall indeed have dominion over us and they hated him yet the what the more what why for his dreams for his dream and for his what his words verse n and he dreamed yet another dream and told it to his Brethren and say behold I have dreamed a what a dream more Joseph life has many things okay his life is Joseph will be born his father will love him he will have a coat of many colors okay he will go to Egypt and he will be a big b and when he's going to be a big man he will be next to pharaoh and when he's going to be next to Pharaoh he will be so rich until he will own the land of Goan and in the land of Goan all his family will have million dollars houses there you everybody that hate him you will have a portion of a beautiful houses you will have servant in Egypt everybody that hates him everybody that hate him you will have servant in Egypt you will have work coming and washing your dishes and Egyptian will be fearing you because of Joseph and when the famine will come all of this is the life of Joseph God hid all of that and God went and Cho a little part from the life of Joseph and that part say Joseph King everybody bowing down and God pulled that come on now if God would have pull that Ash you will have a beautiful house in go Zebulon you will have beautiful house in go and after you will have beautiful Chariot in Goan nobody would have sold him they would say hey let's support him quickly so we can go to Egypt and we're going to be rich God said no God left that mystery he took the one that's going to make them angry am amen amen have I said something wrong brother Bram said Jesus was saying things to decrease to F down the crowd not to bring them back to him no so God chop only this portion and say Joseph this is the Revelation and Joseph as a prophet he can't help her he just woke up in the morning I saw a dream all of you were bowing down which portion why did didn't God take the portion when they're going to be all in Egypt they're going to be the most privileged people because of Joseph why didn't God take that portion and give it to them so everything will be peaceful you need to understand how God work we clear now we clear now listen now verse n and he dreamed yet another dream and told it to who his Brethren look at another portion that is compatible to the first one it's just another version that was a 2023 this is a 2024 version of it and said behold I have dream what a dream more and behold the who the sun and the what the moon and the what the 11 stars made what Obe to me we have the sun we have the moon we have how now we not more in we are no more in the earth we went to the zodiac amen so it's confirming the earth now it's confirming the Zodiac in other word it must happen amen but lacking the detail of this dream got them in trouble yes sir amen because his father interpret the dream his father said the son is me that's what his father said if you look at the next verse he said the Moon is your mother and the 11th star as these are your brother that as far as they can go but let me see how Paul interpreted this dream Paul say in 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse 41 he says what there is only what one glory for the what of the Sun and what another glory for the what of the Moon in other words the glory of the sun is different than the glory of the Moon amen that's are we together and another what glory of the Stars so the glory of the sun is different than the glory of the moon and the glory of the Moon is different than the glory of the star but Paul didn't stop there we there Paul says that for one what star that fell from what another star how in glory [Applause] break it down break it down in other word the sun is special the Moon is special and as much as we all stars still among the star one is different than the other one is a penny one is a silver dollar one it's a god of variety even though we star we not the same that's right amen they miss that portion all they see is this man is going to be boss over us listen to this my friend William Maran Branham brother Bram say we know how that the patriarch sold Joseph which was what a perfect type of Christ how that he being love of what the father hated of who the brothers well he was what Christ in Joseph so they were fighting who Christ in Joseph amen and he says and they hated him how Without a Cause because he was what spiritual he was born how a SE and he seen Vision dream dream and interpret them he was he he were more what spiritual than the rest of his brothers and they hated him how Without a Cause follow me carefully they ought to have loved him more because the first that God was what with him amen when you see God working with somebody you need to be careful how you handling that person you can get yourself in trouble for attacking a sister not Discerning the Lord's body a brother Bram say you just do what favor for those that God is what with and watch how you do what Prosper amen say amen amen you see God good in somebody else life do those people favor and God will make you prosper am my friend let's read it over again because when we do favor oh no you going to make him a big shot you're going to make him a big head you don't have to show him favor say show him [Music] favor can you say amen amen this quote I didn't write them please it's not me I have just a a commission to repeat to them you see a sister that has been blessed do them more favor and God will bless you in other words your Prosperity is connected to them as much you don't want to accept it sometime you are killing your own Prosperity that person will be a supervisor and because of him they will hire you and you kill him that person today you don't know tomorrow he will be in a company you going to make an application and he will be the one sanctioning your application but we want to be out I mean attacking each other not understanding that God is working his own purpose and God is always with his son who Christ Jesus you know that so just do him what favor and see how you do what Prosper brother Bram continue my friend Joseph a perfect example that was who Christ in Joseph he says why you notice he was loved of what his father despise of who his brothers because he was a what SE they hated him without a what cause the man could not help what he was and the other brother did what hated him a very good typ of what all ages every ages confirmed to be the same typ what are you trying to come out now with this coat of many colors last Sunday you say it was the Holy Spirit that got into Joseph the coat of many color what do you have today that you promis to us on Sunday this is William Maran Bram follow me carefully notice again when he was born his father loved him and he made him a coat of what many colors now there is only seven colors in all colors that's a teaching my friend all other are made off of these colors and the coat perhaps had color in it or seven different color straps or color into the coat that the father made if you notice maybe who Jacob Jacob didn't understand at that time but that signify a what promised one the coat of many colors brother brandham say it is an indication that that person is the promised one yes sir amen that was natural now it's done in a spiritual he says when God gave Noah the rainbow son the seven color it was the what promise or a what Covenant one a promised one or a what a covenant one what does he mean a covenant one Amen brother Bram continue he said God had made a covenant that he would destroy the world no more with water water so brother Bram is saying when they gave Joseph a coat of many colors God was indicating that among the children of Jacob the one that I chose the one that is the promise the one that me God have a covenant with him is Joseph in other word the court of many has a message hang tight my friend listen to this how Moses went down into Egypt brought them out before they got out how they got down there had Joseph a perfect typ of who Christ how he was born in amidst his brother hated of his who Brothers love of his what father quat of what many colors which means what distinction God made the distinction right by G sir by giving the coat of many color among many brothers as much as we grow up together as much as we are all in this together God Will Make A Distinction on someone for a [Applause] purpose what is a distinction a distinction is a difference it is a contrast between similar things or similar people we all look alike we all are human being yet there will be something in particular that will separate one person from another yes sir are we together this distinction house or hide a message this distinction is a bait God uses to attract the [Music] devil so that the devil can activate God's plan in your life towards your destination that's why everything work together for good at the beginning nobody knew Joseph was wearing the same clothing but when the father took the coat and put upon him now with obv you you can't hide that no more everybody knows that you the favorite of the father now the devil can't take it no more do you follow me do you follow me this distinction is a bait that God uses to Mark something and to attract the devil most most of the time this Mark these indicators these signs of Distinction are misunderstood among your brothers and they usually misunderstand them for Pride let's go to the book of 1 Samuel chapter 17 let's go to the book of my friend let's clim quickly because my time is pushing quickly you there 1st Samuel chapter 17 if you dare you can say Amen verse 12 if you thereare you can say Amen time is running now I got to run with the clock now David was the son of that who ephra ephra of Bethlehem Judah whose

three eldest son did what followed but David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem and the Philistine Drew near Jun morning and evening and presented himself 40 days and

is coming making a brag amen a golad by the name out of the army of the Philistine and spoke according to the same word and David did what heard them brother Bram say when David heard those word he did something to David that's right amen so God knew what to put in the ears of David to activate him and he only take an enemy to activate that am can I continue am he says and the men of Israel when they saw the man they did what fled from him and were how sore afraid and the men of Israel say have you seen this man that is come up that is come up surely to defy Israel is he come up and it shall

of David she had a garment of Many Colors everybody okay a garment of Many Colors upon who for with such robe were the what King's Daughters how virgins apparel so the government have a message it tells you it's the king and it tells you she's not just a daughter she is also virgin amen because a woman can be virgin but she's not from the Royal lineage so the Garment of many color it's a garment that speak about a royal lineage of God there it is and The Virginity of your [Music] womb father help me up listen to brother Bram and when his bride comes she shall be the same product that

at us a brood like a brood of serpent listen to this my friend the Bible say in the Book of Amos that they drink what wine in Bow and anoints with the what the chief but they are not grieve with the Affliction of Joseph in other way it doesn't care how much a sister is crying how much a brother is being hurt whatever they did to the brother it doesn't matter they are living their own life they

indicator there someone to direct him to the correct terminal are we there and when they move him into do as soon as they sat down they begin to eat what happened a flight is coming going where egpt his ride was coming his ride was not a sh his ride was in God already prepare a ride prepare a fish to pick up Jonah prepare a ride to pick up Joseph his ride must be IND that's why he moved them from shikim to do they were not moving by themselves it was God moving them am because Joseph must go to Egypt yes sir but it takes a tribulation it takes a crime it takes jealousy it takes mvy all of that when they are mixed together they form oil and when those garbages form oil this is when you can get your gasoline and God using that as a gasoline put that in the car so they can take you to your destination amen amen amen why is it that the ishmaelite were not going to another place they were going to Egypt the first flight that show up Egypt and Judah came because he's in he's a lion Judah

the very crime the very trial the very tribulation the very atrocity that is coming up toward you there is a transforming filter that will flip that toward your good and I'm going to show you who did this who was orchestrating all of this that's why the Bible say all things work together for good remember don't look at the pain don't look at the one causing you trouble don't look at the one bringing the trial just understand that there is a mission ahead of me there is a blessing ahead of me so God is using this one to bring me where I'm going don't worry about the one causing the headache don't mind the one causing the trouble don't mind that supervisor that hate you leave them alone all of them are supervised by God Amen they won't do no more than what God allowed them to do am they won't go no further in your life than what God allowed them to be if their time is up their time is up you need to move to another the [Music] stage the trial of your faith is more precious Jacob himself didn't know that that was the last time he's going to see his son for a long time that's right God didn't prepare Joseph that today is your your your flight we don't plan trial my friend

your life so you can see God in a very load of thing and you will understand that everything that happened to you the family that you were born the childhood you went through the difficulty you went through the advantages people took over you the mistreatment you went through High School everything everything he was needed for a season but after that God will stabilize you God you sometimes sit you say I wish I knew all of this I would not have had this high blood pressure that's right I wish I knew all of this I would have saved myself a lot of crying at night that's right I wish I understood all of this years ago I would not have gone through many trials like this God knows what he's doing there is nothing that is Adat there is nothing that he's not supervising as cruel as you look as painful as it is as hard as it is where you sit and you wonder you say what have I done to deserve this after everything that I done this is the way I'm treated this is the way I'm handled
